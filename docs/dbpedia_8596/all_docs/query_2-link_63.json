        "text": "The Premier League’s ruling to dock Everton 10 points has come just as The Toffees appeared to have got their act together. After starting the season with three successive league defeats and five matches without a win, Sean Dyche’s side had moved out of trouble and towards mid-table after taking 10 points from the last 15 available.\n\nThe English top flight’s decision to deduct those points has, however, sent them spiralling back down the standings and they now find themselves back where they were a couple of months ago, in penultimate spot, although they are only two points from safety.\n\nA statement revealed the club was “both shocked and disappointed” to have been found guilty of breaking the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, calling the punishment “wholly disproportionate and unjust”.\n\nThe competition has come down hard on Everton after they posted financial losses for a fifth consecutive year, with the decision leading to much speculation about a potential sanction for Manchester City, who were charged with 115 rule breaches in February. The Toffees even made reference to the champions’ case in their statement, saying “the club will also monitor with great interest the decisions made in any other cases concerning the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules.”\n\nWhich teams have had Premier League points deductions?\n\nLook away now, Everton fans. The Merseysiders are the third club in the Premier League era to be hit with a points deduction, with both prior victims suffering relegation at the end of the season.\n\nMiddlesbrough fail to fulfil fixture\n\nMiddlesbrough were hit with a three-point penalty in 1996-97 for “failing to fulfil a fixture”. In the run-up to their December 1996 match away to Blackburn Rovers, the club board decided to call off the game because 23 players were reportedly either ill or injured, without receiving the full approval of the Premier League. As a result, Boro finished 19th rather than 14th and somehow went down despite having Champions League winner Fabrizio Ravanelli and Brazil international Juninho on their roster.\n\nPortsmouth go into administration\n\nIn 2009-10, 2008 FA Cup winners Portsmouth went into administration as they were unable to pay off their outstanding debts. They became the first club to do so while being a member of the Premier League and were docked nine points in February, eventually having their relegation sealed in April. Pompey ultimately finished bottom of the standings, 16 points from safety, and have not been back in the English top division since. They even dropped as four down as League Two, the fourth tier, between 2013 and 2017.\n\nManchester United and Arsenal punished for Old Trafford brawl"
