        "text": "Man City have been hit with more than 100 charges of alleged breaches of financial rules, which could lead to a points deduction or even expulsion from the Premier League.\n\nIt follows a four-year investigation by the Premier League into the finances of the Manchester club.\n\nThe Premier League released a statement on Monday morning, with the allegations dating back to the 2009/10 season right through to the 2017/18 campaign.\n\nA range of penalties could be levied at Man City should they be found guilty of the charges, including a points penalty or even expulsion.\n\nThe club issued a robust statement in the wake of the charges.\n\nIt read: \"Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.\n\n\"The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent Commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.\n\n\"As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.\"\n\nCity are alleged to have breached league rules requiring provision 'in utmost good faith' of 'accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club's financial position'.\n\nThe Premier League says the accurate financial information required related to 'revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs'.\n\nThe second set of breaches relate to alleged breaking of rules 'requiring a member club to include full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager'. This is related to seasons 2009/10 to 2012/13, when Roberto Mancini was in charge.\n\nThese breaches also refers to requirements for a club to include full details of player remuneration within the relevant contracts, for the seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16 inclusive.\n\nThere are also alleged breaches that relate to failure to comply with UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations, which relates from 2013/14 to 2017/18.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned a two-year UEFA competition ban in July following alleged breaches in FFP regulations\n\nThe fourth set of alleged breaches relates to the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules in seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18 inclusive.\n\nThe club are also alleged to have breached league rules requiring member clubs to co-operate with and assist the Premier League with its investigations, from December 2018 to date.\n\nThe Premier League statement concluded: \"The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission's final award will be published on the Premier League's website.\n\n\"This confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.\"\n\nAccording to The Times' Martyn Ziegler, City would not be able to appeal any sanction to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nReacting to the news, former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan told talkSPORT: “One must remember these are charges and they have to be answered by Manchester City.\n\n“Pep started sowing the seeds, as they obviously knew this was coming, by suggesting there were X amount of clubs in the Premier League that wanted Man City banned.\n\n“When we heard Pep saying that last week we were wondering ‘why were you bringing this up’, now this is the reason why.\n\n“Man City have these allegations and charges to answer. I didn’t think the Premier League would have the balls to do this and having the balls to make it stick is another matter.\n\n“I have always maintained they have significant questions to answer and this idea that people are xenophobic or have an issue because the ownership model is not one people like because of its ethnicity or persuasion is nonsense.\n\n“It’s about the idea that there is an element of financial doping. By that I mean they have been using businesses they own to artificially inflate sponsorship deals that have given them an opportunity to fall within that confines of Financial Fair Play.\n\n“There are a lot of allegations here.\"\n\nSeveral Premier League clubs now want the defending champions to be removed from the league, while the EFL wouldn't have to accept City if they are found guilty."
