        "text": "Manchester City face a nervous wait after Everton were struck with a record points deduction for breaching Financial Fair Play rules.\n\nThe Toffees were hit with a 10-point penalty after an independent commission found the club guilty of breaching financial regulations, in the biggest points deduction in Premier League history, which now leaves Sean Dyche's side fighting for their safety in the division.\n\nWith City facing their own FFP charges, the sanctions will have been watched keenly by the decision-makers at the Etihad. In February, the Premier League directed 115 charges at City, which relate to a series of alleged breaches of financial rules between the 2009-10 and 2017-18 seasons, during which they won the title three times - City have strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nEverton, while announcing they will appeal the decision, have stated they will be watching with interest how other clubs are treated in the future. That was a clear dig at City, and potentially Chelsea, who are facing an investigation.\n\nIn an explosive statement, Everton said: \"Everton maintains that it has been open and transparent in the information it has provided to the Premier League and that it has always respected the integrity of the process. The Club does not recognise the finding that it failed to act with the utmost good faith and it does not understand this to have been an allegation made by the Premier League during the course of proceedings.\n\n\"Both the harshness and severity of the sanction imposed by the Commission are neither a fair nor a reasonable reflection of the evidence submitted. The Club will also monitor with great interest the decisions made in any other cases concerning the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules.\"\n\nAre you concerned about any sanctions involving City? Take part in our poll above and have your say on Everton's punishment and FFP in general, plus City's potential role."
