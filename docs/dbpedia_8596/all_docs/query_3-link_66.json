        "text": "Manchester City are looking forward to a week where they finally get their hands on the Premier League trophy .\n\nAnd this season has been one to look back on for Pep Guardiola and his men with a huge grin - because it has been extraordinary.\n\nBut it is not done yet. Despite three records already broken this season, there are still seven more to go to make it a perfect 10.\n\nWith three games remaining, there could be at least a few more records in the bag before the end of the season - and if things go well against Huddersfield at the weekend, by the end of the week.\n\nSpeaking after the win against West Ham, Fernandinho said: \"It is important, after we confirmed the title and we have the chance to break some records so we go for that. We start today and we score some more goals.\n\n\"I think we made the same record wins as Chelsea, so we have three games to go and we have a chance to do that.\n\n\"We have these chances, clear chances, and we have to go for that. Of course [we want] to keep playing the same way we have so far the whole season.\"\n\nHere, we take a look at the records already achieved - and what's yet to come!\n\nRecords already achieved\n\nEarliest title win: City missed out on a new record with defeat to Manchester United but matched their neighbours' previous mark from 2000-01 by winning the league with five games to go.\n\nConsecutive victories: City's 18-game winning run from August to December was the longest ever in the English top flight, pre-dating even the Premier League era. Along the way, they amassed a record-equalling 11 successive away wins, a feat previously achieved by Chelsea in 2008.\n\nManager of the month: Guardiola was named the Premier League's top boss in September, October, November and December, the first man ever to win four successive manager of the month awards.\n\nPossible records\n\nPoints in a season: Chelsea hold the record with 95 in the 2004-05 season. City are on 93 so one win from their remaining three games will take them to a new mark. The first ever 100-point haul remains possible with two wins and a draw.\n\nWinning margin: Manchester United won the 1999-2000 title by a record 18 points with 91 to Arsenal's 73. City currently lead by 16.\n\nGoals in a season: Again the record belongs to Chelsea, this time the 2009-10 title winners who scored 103 goals. City are on 102 after Sunday's four against West Ham so need just two in three games to break the record. Only three teams have passed 100, with City and Liverpool scoring 102 and 101 respectively in 2013-14, so City are the first club to achieve the feat twice.\n\nGoal difference: At +76, City are on track to beat the goal difference record of +71 set by Chelsea in that same 2009-10 season.\n\nWins in a season: Chelsea's record of 30 wins last season may last only a year if City can add another one to their current 30. If they win their remaining away game, at Southampton on May 13, they will surpass the Blues' 2004-05 record of 15 wins on the road.\n\nAssists in a season: Thierry Henry, for Arsenal in 2002-03, is the only player to reach 20 assists in a Premier League season. While it may be a long shot, Kevin De Bruyne is five adrift at this stage. David Silva, Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling are also in double figures meaning they are the first team ever with four players at that mark."
