        "text": "Former Liverpool defender Daniel Agger has been appointed as the asssistant coach of the Denmark men’s national team.\n\nThe former Denmark international was a Liverpool favourite during his near eight-year stay at Anfield.\n\nHe made 232 appearances and scored 14 times for Liverpool, including a superb screamer from 30 yards out against Blackburn during the 2009/10 season.\n\nAn elegant left-footer defender who formed formidable partnership with Martin Skrtel, and was vice-captain at the club, the 39-year-old once revealed he rejected a big money move to Manchester City during his time at Anfield.\n\nHe captained his country as a player and totalled 75 senior international matches during his career.\n\nAfter retiring in 2016, Agger took up coaching and had a spell as head coach of HB Koge.\n\nBut he left the role by mutual consent in 2023 but is now stepping back into a coaching role.\n\nA new role for Daniel Agger\n\nThe Dane has been appointed by the Danish FA as an assistant to the interim coach Morten Wieghorst.\n\n“It’s great, I’ve missed the national team, and I’m really looking forward to getting started,” Agger said to the national team’s official website.\n\n“But I didn’t get into this just to be involved.\n\n“I’m here to be able to give something to the players and make a difference.\n\n“It’s about being able to contribute, and I’m sure that with my experience and my skills I have a lot to give to the team.”\n\nIn stepping into his new role, th 39-year-old has replaced former Reds teammate Christian Poulsen.\n\nPoulsen stepped down from the assistant role of “his own accord” after three years with the national side, and Agger will look to pick up from where he left off, with more success."
