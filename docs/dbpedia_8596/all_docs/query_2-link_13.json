        "text": "Everton has been hit with a second points deduction of the season for another FFP breach. The Premier League had set out to ensure that all investigations, except the most 'exceptional cases' were dealt with within the current campaign.\n\nEverton received a 10-point deduction, which was later reduced to six, earlier this season relating to breaches of Profit and Sustainability rules (weâ€™ll use the informal â€˜FFPâ€™ shorthand) in the previous accounting period. That it was only applied this season partly gave rise to the Premier Leagueâ€™s commitment to faster resolutions: the penalty would have been enough to see the Toffees relegated last season, leaving the clubs who did go down to the Championship less than impressed.\n\nOn Monday, Everton was hit with a further two point deduction for the period ending in 2022/23 and is now two points off the relegation zone. It comes after Nottingham Forest was also hit with a four-point penalty for a FFP breach.\n\nREAD MORE: JÃ¼rgen Klopp prediction could come true following Liverpool exit as new contract signed\n\nREAD MORE: Why new Everton penalty differs from Man City as Liverpool awaits FFP verdict\n\nAt the other end of the table, Liverpool is in something of a similar position to those aggrieved clubs. The charges against Manchester City are the definition of â€˜exceptionalâ€™: the Premier League has 115 to wade through, rather than just one in the cases of Everton and Forest. But with the investigation opened almost five years ago, the position gets more uncomfortable with each passing season.\n\nIn 2019 and then again in 2022, Liverpool finished as runner-up to Manchester City while the shadow of the investigation loomed. Pep Guardiolaâ€™s side has since been awarded a title while formally under the 115 charges. Again, thereâ€™s no easy fix for the Premier League, but the optics are bad â€” made worse, if anything, by swift FFP resolutions against Everton and Forest.\n\nIn terms of the period the charges span, that begins well over a decade ago. Indeed, Liverpool could have a grievance over a third season, dating back to 2013/14: that falls squarely within the period where Manchester City is accused of breaking the rules.\n\nFor the 2018/19 and 2021/22 seasons, the only charges Manchester City is facing relate to the rules surrounding cooperation with the Premier League investigation. The league broke down all 115 charges â€” all denied â€” when the club was charged:\n\nIn accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has referred a number of alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules by Manchester City Football Club (Club) to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4.\n\nDetails of the Premier League Rules that the Club is alleged to have breached are as follows:\n\n1. In respect of each of Seasons 2009/10 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those seasons that required provision by a member club to the Premier League, in the utmost good faith, of accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the clubâ€™s financial position, in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2009/10, Premier League Rules B.13, C.71, C.72, C.75 (amended to C.79 from 10 September 2009 for the remainder of Season 2009/10) and C.80;(b) for Season 2010/11, Premier League Rules B.13, C.78, C.79, C.86 and C.87;(c) for Season 2011/12, Premier League Rules B.13, E.3, 4, E.11 and E.12;(d) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules 16, E.3, E.4, E.11 and E.12;(e) for Season 2013/14, Premier League Rules 15, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.49;(f) for Season 2014/15, Premier League Rules 16, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.50;(g) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules 16, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.50;(h) for Season 2016/17, Premier League Rules16, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.51; and(i) for Season 2017/18, Premier League Rules B.16, 3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.51.\n\n2. In respect of:(a) each of Seasons 2009/10 to 2012/13 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to include full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager, namely:\n\n(1) for Seasons 2009/10 to 2011/12 inclusive, Premier League Rules Q.7 and Q.8; and(2) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules P.7 and P.8; and(b) each of Seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to include full details of player remuneration in its relevant contracts with its players, namely:\n\n(1) for Seasons 2010/11 and 2011/12, Premier League Rules K.12 and K.20;(2) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules T.12 and T.20;(3) for Seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15, Premier League Rules T.12 and T.19; and(4) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules T.13 and T.20.\n\n3. In respect of each of Seasons 2013/14 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to comply with UEFAâ€™s regulations, including UEFAâ€™s Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2013/14, Premier League Rule B.14.6; and(b) for Seasons 2014/15 to 2017/18 inclusive, Premier League Rule B.15.6.\n\n4. In respect of each of the Seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons on Profitability and Sustainability, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules E.52 to E.60; and(b) for Seasons 2016/17 and 2017/18, Premier League Rules E.53 to E.60.\n\n5. In respect of the period from December 2018 to date, the Premier League Rules applicable in the relevant Seasons requiring a member club to cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations, including by providing documents and information to the Premier League in the utmost good faith, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2018/19, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;(b) for Season 2019/20, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;(c) for Season 2020/21, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;(d) for Season 2021/22, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16; and(e) for Season 2022/23, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16.\n\nIn summary, Manchester City faces what would commonly be called 'FFP' charges for every season from 2009/10 through to 2017/18. It's little wonder that the Premier League is having to take its time.\n\nBut therein lies the paradox. Given the scale of cheating alleged, and the significant time span over which it is alleged to have happened, the Premier League brand is more damaged by every season where this goes unresolved. In fairness, the Manchester City brand is also tarnished, and it must also surely welcome a definitive resolution as it continues to defend its position.\n\nThe Everton and Nottingham Forest cases are small fry in comparison, and even they could have big consequences, with the Blues already hit by one points deduction. Yet the FFP verdict Liverpool and others will be watching for closely could still be years away, as the Premier League grapples with a truly exceptional case."
