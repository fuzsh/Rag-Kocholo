        "text": "In football, where every move and statistic matters, the number of handballs committed by players can be a fascinating insight into their playing styles. As we look into the Premier League‘s rich history since the 2009-10 season, we unveil the top eight players who have left a mark on the field, not for their goals or assists, but for the unlawful use of hands during the game.\n\nHere are the eight footballers with the most handballs committed in the English Premier League since the 2009-10 season (stats via Opta).\n\n5. James Milner, Michail Antonio, Sadio Mané – A Trio Tied at 30 Handballs\n\nOur journey begins with a trio of remarkable players, each having committed 30 handballs since the 2009/10 season. James Milner, known for his versatility and precision on the field, finds himself in unexpected company with Michail Antonio and Sadio Mané. This unique trinity contributes to the handball statistic, leaving fans stunned beyond the typical goal-scoring celebrations.\n\n4. Raheem Sterling – 31\n\nBreaking into the top four, we encounter Raheem Sterling, a player celebrated for his electrifying pace and agility. However, it’s not just his swift runs and goal-scoring skills that define him. Sterling’s tally of 31 handballs adds a layer of complexity and a dark spot to his Premier League career.\n\nTop five most valuable squads in football\n\nTop 10 players with biggest rating upgrade in EA FC 24\n\nRanking the favourites to win Best FIFA Men’s Player Award 2023\n\nTop five favourites to win Serie A 2023-24 based on odds\n\nTop 10 footballers who were banned for doping\n\n3. Ashley Barnes and Christian Benteke – A Joint Venture with 34 Handballs\n\nIn the list of handball stats, a surprising collaboration emerges as Ashley Barnes and Christian Benteke share the third spot with 34 handballs each. Barnes, known for his tenacity, and Benteke, a towering presence in the box, bring a unique dynamic to this statistical category. Their consistent performances over the years have etched their names into the Premier League’s handball history. However, this time around they are in a completely unwanted list.\n\n2. Marouane Fellaini – 38 Handballs\n\nAs we ascend the handball hierarchy, Marouane Fellaini’s towering presence looms large. With 38 handballs to his name, the Belgian midfielder’s physicality and aerial dominance have often translated into inadvertent handball incidents.\n\nHis standout performances at Everton caught the attention of top clubs, leading to a transfer to Manchester United in 2013, where he played under manager David Moyes, who had also managed him at Everton. During his time at Manchester United, Fellaini became known for his effectiveness in aerial duels and his knack for scoring crucial goals, often utilizing his height and strength in set-piece situations. He played a key role in the team’s successes, including winning the FA Cup in the 2015-2016 season under manager Louis van Gaal.\n\n1. Jermain Defoe – 41 Incidents\n\nAt the summit of our exploration stands Jermain Defoe, the unrivaled handball maestro of the Premier League since 2009-10. With an astounding 41 handball incidents, he is at the top of this unwanted list. While known for his goal-scoring skills, this statistic adds a captivating layer to Defoe’s legacy.\n\nDefoe began his professional career with West Ham United in 1999, showcasing his goal-scoring prowess early on. However, it was during his time at Tottenham Hotspur that he truly established himself as one of the Premier League’s most lethal strikers. Defoe enjoyed two separate spells with Spurs, scoring consistently and earning a reputation for his clinical finishing."
