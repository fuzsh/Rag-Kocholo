        "text": "Everton's record 10-point deduction for breaching Premier League financial rules may be a first of its kind, but it's not the only time English clubs have been hit with such a penalty.\n\nIndeed, you can go back more than 100 years for one of the first incidents, while the punishment is a drop in the ocean compared to the 30 points Luton Town - now in the Premier League - were hit with back in 2008 that ultimately saw them drop out of the Football League.\n\nBBC Sport has tracked a number of examples of incidents both on and off the pitch that have resulted in clubs having points deducted, often with severe consequences.\n\nDerby County went into administration in September 2021 and were hit with a 12-point deduction, dropping them to the foot of the Championship.\n\nJust two months later, a further nine points were deducted from the Rams' total, due to financial mismanagement under former owner Mel Morris.\n\nThey had initially been cleared of wrongdoing by an independent tribunal in 2020, but the EFL won its appeal against the ruling and Derby's relegation - with then manager Wayne Rooney at the helm - to League One was confirmed in April 2022.\n\nOn 18 July 2019, it was confirmed that Bury would begin the 2019-12 League One season with a 12-point deduction after the club entered a voluntary arrangement to secure their future.\n\nHaving been promoted from League Two just months prior, the Shakers were subject of a winding-up petition over unpaid debts, which was heard in the high court.\n\nAfter continued financial struggles - including a collapsed takeover bid from C&N Sporting Risk - they were expelled from the EFL in August 2019, becoming the first team to drop out of the EFL since Maidstone's liquidation in 1992.\n\nIn the 2009-10 season, Portsmouth fell into deep financial trouble, failing to pay players and staff for a number of months, and the club had changed ownership three times before February.\n\nHaving not found a new buyer by the 25 February deadline, the club prepared to go into administration, with the Premier League announcing they were set to be deducted nine points - on a date yet to be decided.\n\nOn 17 March 2010, Portsmouth were issued the nine-point deduction with immediate effect, which all but confirmed their relegation into the Championship.\n\nThe start of the 2008-09 season was when Luton Town - now in the Premier League - were hit with deductions totalling 30 points.\n\nThey were docked 20 points by the EFL for leaving administration without having made a company voluntary agreement with creditors, before a further 10 were taken away by the FA for financial misconduct relating to transfers.\n\nLuton were relegated from the EFL for the first time in 89 years - and also won the Football League Trophy that season too.\n\nIn the same season as Luton's points deduction, Bournemouth - also now in the Premier League - were docked 17 points for entering administration, while Rotherham were issued the same punishment.\n\nBoth sides managed to escape the drop, while Darlington became the fourth side in the division to be given a deduction (10 points) that season in January for also going into administration.\n\nSwindon Town beat Sunderland 1-0 in the play-off final at Wembley and celebrated what they thought was promotion to the First Division.\n\nBut 10 days later, Swindon were found guilty on 35 counts of illegal player payments and Sunderland were promoted instead. Swindon were originally dropped into the third tier as punishment, but on appeal that was reduced to just being back in the second tier where they started.\n\nTeams being deducted points is nothing new. Indeed you have to go all the way back 133 years for the first example of an English top-flight side being penalised.\n\nScotland international goalkeeper Ned Doig played for Sunderland, but he had not been registered with the club for the required seven days, and therefore was still effectively a Blackburn player. Sunderland lost two points, which dropped them from fifth to seventh at the end of the season."
