I look forward to welcoming a trade delegation to the UK later this year to raise awareness of opportunities in Djibouti.\n\n“I also commended the Prime Minister on Djibouti’s active role in regional security including their important participation in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).”\n\nCooperation between the UK and Djibouti has increased over the last few years, with close working in many areas of shared interest, including piracy and regional security."
