These garments are sold in the capital’s colourful central market.\n\nCountry Facts\n\nCapital, Population, Government...\n\nCountry Facts\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Djibouti\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Ismail Omar Guelleh, assisted by Prime Minister: Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 1,052,000\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nmultiparty republic with one legislative house (National Assembly [65])1\n\nOfficial Languages:\n\nArabic; French\n\nThe cuisine of Djibouti mingles African and French influences to produce meals that might include roast lamb with a delicate yogurt sauce, lentil stew, flatbread, and cucumber salad, served with mineral water and fruit juice. The souk (marketplace) of Djibouti city is famed for its spicy oven-baked fish. The capital also houses several high-quality Vietnamese, Chinese, and Lebanese restaurants, making it a somewhat remote but altogether fascinating destination for gourmands.\n\nMuslim feasts and holidays, including ʿĪd al-Fiṭr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā, which marks the culmination of the hajj, are celebrated by Djibouti’s predominant Muslim population. In addition to these, other major holidays in the country include Independence Day, which is celebrated on June 27.\n\nThe arts and cultural institutions\n\nAmong students of literature, Djibouti is best known for having been the sometime home of the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, who lived in Djibouti for several years. Rimbaud lends his name to a cultural centre housing a small library and museum, on the grounds of which an annual music festival takes place. This festival draws performers from all over the country, and live recordings of headliner acts have proved popular with international audiences. Among the best-known performers are the Soukouss Vibration Band, Dinkara, Aïdarous, Père Robert, and Passengers—the last a Rastafarian group that performs reggae tunes by Bob Marley and other Jamaican artists, with lyrics translated into the Somali language. The government sponsors several organizations dedicated to the preservation of traditional culture and dance.\n\nSports and recreation\n\nAthletics is a major component of Djiboutian society. The most popular sport in Djibouti is running, and during the 1980s Djiboutian runners enjoyed a considerable amount of success. Ahmed Salah, the most accomplished Djiboutian marathoner, won several international events, including the first world marathon championship in 1985.\n\nFootball (soccer) has long been popular as a spectator sport. The Djiboutian national team participated in its first international competition in 1998. Tennis is developing a following, although access to tennis courts and equipment remains limited. Pétanque is also extremely popular. Similar to bocci ball, the game features players who take turns rolling a ball as close as possible to a target ball. Every night around the city, groups of Djiboutians play pétanque under the streetlights. Other sports favoured in Djibouti include volleyball, handball, basketball, and judo. Volleyball and handball each have active leagues, but basketball is less organized, largely because of the lack of suitable courts.\n\nDjibouti made its first Olympic appearance at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. Its runners have had strong showings, and, at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, Salah won the country’s first medal, a bronze in the men’s marathon.\n\nMedia and publishing\n\nDjibouti’s only television and radio broadcast company, which offers programming in French, Arabic, Afar, and Somali, is state-run, as is the daily French-language newspaper, La Nation. Independent publications include La Renouveau and La République, which are both weeklies.\n\nCatherine C. Cutbill Peter J. Schraeder\n\nHistory\n\nThis discussion focuses on Djibouti since independence. For a more detailed treatment of earlier periods and of the country in its regional context, see eastern Africa, history of.\n\nIndependence and the Gouled presidency (1977–99)\n\nBalancing ethnic tensions\n\nOn June 27, 1977, the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became independent, taking the name Djibouti, with Hassan Gouled Aptidon as president. On the eve of independence, Djibouti’s viability as a sovereign state was questionable. However, fears that the Afar and the Issa Somali would become pawns in a struggle between the republic’s rival neighbours, Ethiopia and Somalia, did not materialize. No Djiboutian political leader, either Afar or Somali, ever condoned unification with either of the larger states. Indeed, Djibouti established a peaceful international profile through a policy of strict neutrality in regional affairs. In keeping with friendship treaties with both Somalia and Ethiopia, the government refused to support armed groups opposing the neighbouring regimes, and it hosted negotiations between Somalia’s and Ethiopia’s leaders that resulted in a series of accords in 1988.\n\nDjibouti’s balanced posture in external relations was reflected in its internal politics. Gouled, an Issa Somali, was elected to two consecutive terms as president in 1981 and 1987. Barkat Gourad Hamadou, an Afar serving as prime minister since 1978, was reappointed in 1987. Power appeared to be shared, with ministry appointments following a formula designed to maintain ethnic balance.\n\nIn the first years of self-government, though, ethnic tensions were evident. By 1978 the state had experienced two cabinet crises and changes of prime minister. Those ousted were Afars accused of fomenting ethnic strife. After opposition parties were banned in 1981, ethnic conflict in the political arena was for the most part minimal. However, Issa predominance in the civil service, the armed forces, and the Popular Assembly for Progress (Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progrès; RPP)—now the only legally recognized political party—was only slightly masked, and occasional tremors of social unrest disturbed Djibouti’s superficial calm.\n\nUrban development and challenges\n\nChallenges to Djibouti’s stability could not be reduced to traditional Afar and Issa enmity; signs of the serious problems facing the young nation were also to be found in the urban demography of its capital. On the outskirts of the city, an expansive squatter community known as Balbala, which originally developed just beyond the barbed-wire boundary erected by the French colonial administration to prevent migration to the capital, tripled in size within a decade after independence. In 1987 it was officially incorporated into the city, with the promise of development of basic water and sanitary services. Its growth continued because of a high birth rate, rural migration, and displacement of persons from the urban core.\n\nConditions in some of the densely populated quarters of Djibouti city were only marginally better than in Balbala. Structures were limited to wood and corrugated iron by colonial, and later national, restrictions on the construction and location of permanent dwellings. Distinct ethnic enclaves were identifiable: the retail centre surrounding the main mosque (Hamoudi Mosque) and the former caravan terminus (Harbi Square), housing the Arab community; the neighbourhoods radiating beyond this area, settled by the Isaaq, Gadaboursi, and Issa Somali; and the quarter known as Arhiba, built by the French to house the Afar dockworkers recruited from the north of the colony in the 1960s.\n\nAs the urban infrastructure was developed, and as government-subsidized housing was realized through international aid programs, conditions in the old districts of the city improved. Yet the needs remained immense, and progress was accompanied by perceptions of ethnic favouritism. Discontent was also fostered by a high cost of living, unemployment, and a widening gap in living conditions between the majority of the population and the new urban elite."
