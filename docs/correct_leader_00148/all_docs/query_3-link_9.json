In the subsequent multiparty presidential election held the following year, Gouled emerged victorious over opposition candidates by a wide margin of victory.  Meanwhile, the country’s ethnic tensions had continued to simmer, and in late 1991 the Afar Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (Front pour la Restauration de l’Unité et de la Démocratie; FRUD) took up arms against the Issa-dominated government; the conflict",

        "text": "Djibouti under Guelleh\n\nIn 1999 Gouled announced that he would not stand in the presidential election scheduled for April, and the RPP nominated Ismail Omar Guelleh, a former cabinet secretary and Gouled’s nephew, as its candidate. Guelleh easily beat his opponent, Moussa Ahmed Idriss, who represented a small coalition of opposition parties. In 2001 the long-serving prime minister Hamadou resigned for health reasons, and Guelleh named Dileita Muhammad Dileita, an accomplished public servant, to the post. Dileita, like his predecessor, was an Afar, and Guelleh’s appointment of him to the post maintained the balance of power between the Afars and Somali Issas that Gouled had established after independence.\n\nIn 2002 the previous restriction on the number of political parties was lifted, which allowed for the creation of many new legally recognized political parties and offered the potential for change in Djibouti’s political landscape. One such change was the creation of the Union for the Presidential Majority (Union pour la Majorité Présidentielle; UMP) coalition, which included both the RPP and FRUD and was formed in preparation for the 2003 legislative elections.\n\nDespite the problems affecting Djiboutians at the time, including a serious drought and food shortage, it was the presence of U.S. troops in the country that appeared to be the dominant campaign issue. U.S. troops had been in Djibouti since 2002 to utilize the country’s strategic location during the U.S.-led global campaign against terrorism. The opposition argued against the government’s decision to allow the troops in the country, saying it could provoke acts of terrorism against Djiboutians. Despite the argument, the UMP prevailed in the election, taking all parliamentary seats. Although Guelleh continued to cultivate diplomatic ties with the United States, he was openly critical of its role in the Iraq War that began in 2003, citing the lack of UN approval for the operation, and he did not allow the U.S. to launch any attacks from Djibouti. Whether the presence of U.S. troops would be an issue in future elections was not immediately known. The next scheduled election—the 2005 presidential poll—was boycotted by the opposition, who cited the need for greater transparency and electoral change. As a result, Guelleh was the only candidate, and he won 100 percent of the vote.\n\nDjibouti’s somewhat acrimonious relationship with neighbouring Eritrea (a former Ethiopian province that had gained independence in 1993) worsened in April 2008 when Eritrea amassed troops along the Ras Doumeira border area of Djibouti; this action resulted in border skirmishes that in June led to the deaths of more than 30 people and injuries to many more. Eritrea’s actions were widely criticized, notably by the African Union, the United Nations Security Council, and the Arab League, and the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea in 2009. Eritrean troops eventually left Djibouti in June 2010. Eritrea remained under UN sanctions until November 2018, when the Security Council agreed to lift them. This came on the heels of a September 2018 agreement between Djibouti and Eritrea to restore relations and was one of several rapprochements that occurred in 2018 among the various Horn of Africa countries, inspiring hope for a future of greater regional stability.\n\nMeanwhile, Guelleh’s desire to remain in office was strengthened when a constitutional amendment that abolished term limits was passed in April 2010, thus allowing him to run for a third term in 2011. The 2011 poll was also boycotted by the opposition, though Guelleh was challenged by one candidate, Mohamed Warsama Ragueh, who ran as an independent. Guelleh still won a decisive victory, garnering some 80 percent of the vote.\n\nParliamentary elections held in February 2013, in which Guelleh’s UMP coalition won some two-thirds of the seats, generated protests and the arrest of several opposition leaders. The political climate remained tense into the next year, with the detention of opposition members, sometimes followed by arrests of journalists covering the situation.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential election approached, Guelleh, who was one of six candidates, seemed assured of another victory. The country’s opposition coalition was in discord, with some of the parties boycotting the election and others fielding two candidates to challenge the incumbent. Guelleh was declared the winner of the April 8, 2016, election, reportedly receiving about 87 percent of the vote. Several opposition leaders disputed the results, alleging fraud. The opposition boycott was repeated in the parliamentary elections held on February 23, 2018. Unsurprisingly, Guelleh’s UMP coalition won more than four-fifths of the seats.\n\nCatherine C. Cutbill"
