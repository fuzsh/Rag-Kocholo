        "text": "During the mission, the team visited different hospitals and research institutions and also met several partner organizations. “This visit was an opportunity to focus not only on what the IAEA can bring to cancer patients in Djibouti,” said Adeline Djeutie, Programme Management Officer at the IAEA, “but also to explore synergies with other cancer fighting organizations in the country.”\n\nStaff in the WHO regional and country office are presently working on a governance roadmap for noncommunicable diseases (NCD). “In order to achieve the best health outcomes for Djiboutians, cancer care efforts need to be integrated within a broader NCD agenda and framework,” said Lamia Mahmoud, Regional Advisor for the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. The team also met the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) – currently carrying out a breast and cervical cancer screening programme in the country – and the Djibouti National Scientific Research Centre (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), which provides screening services for women for cervical and breast cancer.\n\n“Each individual organization brings its own strengths when it comes to supporting the Djibouti Ministry of Health in its battle against cancer,” said Lisa Stevens, Director of the IAEA’s Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy, “but it is only together that we can hope to win this fight.”"
