        "text": "On the afternoon of January 23, 2024, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) Zhao Leji held talks with President of the National Assembly of Djibouti Dileita Mohamed Dileita at the Great Hall of the People.\n\nZhao Leji said, under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Ismail Omar Guelleh, China and Djibouti have deepened political mutual trust, steadily advanced practical cooperation and made fruitful people-to-people exchanges. This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Djibouti. China is willing to work with Djibouti to jointly push for the constant development of the China-Djibouti strategic partnership under the guidance of implementing the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state.\n\nZhao Leji pointed out that China always viewed and developed its relations with Djibouti from a long-term and strategic perspective. China appreciates Djibouti for its valuable support on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and human rights, among others. China will continue to support Djibouti in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and stability, independently exploring a development path suited to its national conditions, and playing a greater role in international and regional affairs. China is ready to deepen Belt and Road cooperation, strengthen the synergy of strategies, and expand cooperation in such fields as ports, free trade parks, investment and infrastructure development. China appreciates Djibouti's support for the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping. China is ready to make new contributions to the effective implementation of the three initiatives in Djibouti and the building of a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future.\n\nZhao Leji said, exchanges and cooperation between legislative institutions play an important role in promoting the development of state-to-state relations. The NPC of China stands ready to work with the National Assembly of Djibouti to strengthen cooperation between senior legislators, special committees, bilateral friendship groups, and deputies of the NPC and the National Assembly of Djibouti, deepen the exchange of experience in legislation and supervision work, and jointly enhance the ability to perform duties. The two sides should promote cooperation in such fields as education, culture, and health, and at the sub-national level, encourage all sectors of society, especially the young generation, to enhance mutual understanding and constantly consolidate public support for bilateral relations.\n\nZhao Leji introduced China's system of people's congresses. He said that on the basis of mutual respect for each other's choice of development path and system model, China is willing to strengthen the exchange of experience in governance, better serve the economic and social development of each country, and jointly safeguard greater democracy in international relations.\n\nDileita said that Djibouti and China are strategic partners. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 45 years ago, cooperation in various fields such as politics, economy, people's livelihoods and culture has yielded fruitful results. Djibouti has always adhered firmly to the one-China principle. The Djiboutian National Assembly is willing to strengthen friendly exchanges with the NPC of China, share legislative experience, and make positive legislative contributions to promoting the in-depth development of bilateral relations and deepening the friendship between the two peoples.\n\nShohrat Zakir attended the talks."
