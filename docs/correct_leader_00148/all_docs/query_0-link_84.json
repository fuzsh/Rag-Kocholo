        "text": "Djiboutians sang and danced as Djiboutian, French and U.S. Dignitaries arrived for the dedication ceremony of a new naval pier facility in Obock on January 14, 2009. This $14 million project was funded by the U.S. government in coordination with Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), part of U.S. Africa command.\n\n\"This project is part of the greater whole,\" U.S. Ambassador to Djibouti James Swan said. \"If you look along the pier you will see two 17-meter patrol boats provided to the Djiboutian Navy through another security cooperation program in 2007. Further down the coast, is the Ras Bir lighthouse, which will eventually support a radar receiver as part of the Regional Maritime Awareness Capability. These three programs, taken together, will greatly enhance Djibouti's ability to protect its maritime borders, leading to greater protection of the Port of Djibouti, and reducing the threat of piracy, human trafficking, smuggling and illegal fishing.\"\n\nThe pier is divided into two structures--a civil portion and a military portion. The civil portion includes a small pier, boat ramp, classroom and a fully-equipped ice house. The military portion includes a 90-meter maritime platform, a head office, an administrative and berthing structure, fully-automated gas and firefighting systems as well as water and fuel storage facilities.\n\n\"It is extremely rare to combine military and civilian facilities in a single project and the fact that we did so highlights our commitment to facilitate economic possibilities,\" Swan said during the ceremony.\n\nRear Admiral Philip Greene, CJTF-HOA commander, addressed the crowd, speaking on the important relationship between Djibouti and the United States.\n\n\"The partnerships between United States government personnel and the people of Djibouti are critical in ensuring peace, security and stability which in turn disrupt the effort of extremist,\" Greene said.\n\nPrime Minister of Djibouti Dileita Mohamed Dileita was also in attendance.\n\n\"The Obock pier project, funded by the U.S. military and managed by U.S. Liaison Office, is the most significant program of its kind ever undertaken in sub-Saharan Africa,\" Dileita said. \"I feel great satisfaction at the inauguration of the joint Obock pier as it is the prelude to the development of an important civil and military port.\""
