        "text": "On June 28, 2024, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhao Leji met with Peruvian President Dina Ercilia Boluarte Zegarra in Beijing.\n\nZhao Leji said that since China and Peru established a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013, the political mutual trust between the two sides has become more solid and practical cooperation has been increasingly expanding. The Congress of Peru adopted a decision recently, designating February 1 of every year as the \"Peru-China Fraternity Day\", which once again shows that it is the consensus of all sectors of Peru to enhance China-Peru friendship. China is willing to work with Peru to firmly support each other and deepen cooperation to promote the in-depth development of China-Peru and China-Latin America relations. The National People's Congress of China is ready to work with the Congress of Peru to implement the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state, increase exchanges at all levels, carry out exchanges on governance and legislative experience, and create a sound legal environment for bilateral cooperation.\n\nDina Ercilia Boluarte Zegarra said that Peru and China enjoy a long history of friendship and Chinese people are an important part of Peru's diversified society. Peru is willing to strengthen exchanges between the legislative bodies of both sides, provide a sound legal environment for bilateral practical cooperation, and continuously push forward the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.\n\nWu Weihua was present at the meeting."
