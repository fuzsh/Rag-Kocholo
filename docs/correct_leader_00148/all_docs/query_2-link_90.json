        "text": "COMPANY REGISTRATION\n\nThe registration of a business or a company with the competent authorities constitutes the gateway to the sphere of formal and structured commercial and industrial activities. This means that your investment obtains a legal status, which also facilitates access to banking services (bank loans, L / C, transfer & transfer etc.); as well as opportunities such as tenders in public and private markets .\n\nThe one-stop shop is the institution in charge of business registration in the Republic of Djibouti. It is an entity placed under the supervision of the National Agency for the Promotion of Investments which was created by Decree No 2013-114 / PR / MDCC on the attribution, operation and organization of the National Agency for the Promotion of Investments under the supervision of the Ministry in charge of Investment at the Presidency.\n\nThis window brings together several branches representing public and parapublic institutions involved in the registration and creation of businesses.\n\nThe aim of this counter is to facilitate administrative procedures for national and foreign promoters and to remove all obstacles likely to hinder the creation and launch of a business.\n\nTo materialize this objective, the 3 P rule prevails at the one-stop shop:\n\nOne payment for promoter invoices.\n\nA single process for processing files.\n\nA single front door for requests.\n\nThis counter has also set up an integral information system that manages and coordinates the entire process and the time required to create a business, estimated at 3 days, subject to completing all the necessary documents.\n\nTo date, the Single Window operates in Djibouti city, but in the context of decentralization, the will of the Government and the ANPI is to extend the services of the single window to the interior regions.\n\nIn the Republic of Djibouti, three partners are involved in the business creation process:\n\nThe ODPIC (Djibouti Office of Industrial and Commercial Property) for registration in the Trade Register ;\n\nThe Directorate General of Taxes (DGI) for tax registration ;\n\nThe CNSS (National Social Security Fund) for registration with Social Security .\n\nIn my information with these partner institutions for business creation, I found that women promoters have the same services during registration and support in the formalities of creation. Among the promoters questioned, the female promoters declared that they had not suffered any form of discrimination and specific procedures.\n\nIn this report, we will present to you the institutions involved in business creation, the roles and responsibilities of the partners, the business creation procedures in force, the main legal forms registered, the list of regulated professions as well as advantages granted by the State to promoters.\n\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTNERS\n\nThe mission of the ODPIC is to:\n\n1 . Issue negative certificates, a mechanism that allows trade names and brands to be protected, as well as the registration of trade names and brands;\n\n2 . Proceed with the registration of natural and legal persons in the trade and companies register as well as the publication of legal announcements;\n\n3 . Disseminate to the public all information necessary for the registration of traders in the commercial register as well as the commitment to any awareness-raising and training action in this area.\n\nThe DGI is responsible for:\n\n1 . Register the articles of association of companies;\n\n2 . Register commercial leases;\n\n3 . Assign the Tax Identification Number to natural and legal persons with the exception of those established in the Free Zone;\n\n4 . Issue the activity license for the start of the activity of the company and the natural person;\n\n5 . Collection from the receiver of the Single Window revenue office, the costs of registration of the articles of association and stamp duties as well as all of the administrative costs for the other formalities;\n\nThe CNSS has the task of:\n\n1 . Proceed with the affiliation of a professional employer and the registration of all its employees in accordance with the legislative provisions in force;\n\n2 . Issue the registration notification.\n\nTHE MAIN LEGAL FORMS OF COMPANY CREATION\n\nAt the one-stop shop, the main types of company registered are:\n\nIndividual business\n\nSole Proprietorship with Limited Liability (EURL)\n\nLimited liability company (SARL)\n\nPublic limited company (SA)\n\nSimplified joint stock company (SAS)\n\nThe foreign investor does not need a Djiboutian partner to start a business in Djibouti except for certain regulated activities.\n\nREGULATED PROFESSIONS\n\nSource: ANPI\n\nBENEFITS GRANTED BY THE STATE TO PROMOTERS:\n\nThese advantages granted are:\n\nExemption from the business license ( from class 5 to class 8) for the first 3 years.\n\nThe reduction of capital registration fees to 10,000 FDJ ($57)\n\nAffiliation to the CNSS : No staff list required at the beginning of the creation of the company.\n\nThe cost of setting up a business has fallen from DJF 173,500 ($978) to just DJF 23,000 ($130).\n\nTHE COMPANY CREATION PROCESS\n\nAs part of improving the business climate with the World Bank quotdoing businessquot, the Republic of Djibouti has undertaken reforms in business creation. In 2018, Djibouti recorded an increase of 55 ranks in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business global ranking. In 2019, Djibouti ranked among the top 100 economies, ranked 99th in the world. The country is one of the 10 economies that improved the most in three or more areas measured by Doing Business. Over the past year, Djibouti has seen 6 reforms in the areas measured by the report: starting a business, transferring property, protecting minority investors, obtaining loans, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency.\n\nBusiness creation has been facilitated by the establishment of a one-stop shop for new businesses."
