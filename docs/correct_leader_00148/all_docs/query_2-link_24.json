        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in 1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among the Afar minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 with a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Somali Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first multiparty presidential election resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH as president; he was reelected to a second term in 2005 and extended his tenure in office via a constitutional amendment, which allowed him to serve a third term in 2011 and begin a fourth term in 2016. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the intersection of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Its ports handle 95% of Ethiopia’s trade. Djibouti’s ports also service transshipments between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The government holds longstanding ties to France, which maintains a military presence in the country, as does the US, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, and China.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nEastern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, between Eritrea and Somalia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n11 30 N, 43 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 23,200 sq km\n\nland: 23,180 sq km\n\nwater: 20 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 151\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than New Jersey\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 528 km\n\nborder countries (3): Eritrea 125 km, Ethiopia 342 km, Somalia 61 km\n\nCoastline\n\n314 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\nClimate\n\ndesert; torrid, dry\n\nTerrain\n\ncoastal plain and plateau separated by central mountains\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 430 m\n\nlowest point: Lac Assal -155 m\n\nhighest point: Moussa Ali 2,021 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npotential geothermal power, gold, clay, granite, limestone, marble, salt, diatomite, gypsum, pumice, petroleum\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 73.4% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 0.1% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 0% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 73.3% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 0.2% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 26.4% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n10 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmost densely populated areas are in the east; the largest city is Djibouti, with a population over 600,000; no other city in the country has a total population over 50,000\n\nNatural hazards\n\nearthquakes; droughts; occasional cyclonic disturbances from the Indian Ocean bring heavy rains and flash floods volcanism: experiences limited volcanic activity; Ardoukoba (298 m) last erupted in 1978; Manda-Inakir, located along the Ethiopian border, is also historically active\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\ninadequate supplies of potable water; water pollution; limited arable land; deforestation (forests threatened by agriculture and the use of wood for fuel); desertification; endangered species\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\nstrategic location near world's busiest shipping lanes and close to Arabian oilfields; terminus of rail traffic into Ethiopia; mostly wasteland; Lac Assal (Lake Assal) is the lowest point in Africa and the saltiest lake in the world\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n884,017 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 162\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Djiboutian(s)\n\nadjective: Djiboutian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nSomali 60%, Afar 35%, other 5% (mostly Yemeni Arab, also French, Ethiopian, and Italian)\n\nLanguages\n\nFrench (official), Arabic (official), Somali, Afar\n\nReligions\n\nSunni Muslim 94% (nearly all Djiboutians), Christian 6% (mainly foreign-born residents)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nDjibouti is a poor, predominantly urban country, characterized by high rates of illiteracy, unemployment, and childhood malnutrition. More than 75% of the population lives in cities and towns (predominantly in the capital, Djibouti). The rural population subsists primarily on nomadic herding. Prone to droughts and floods, the country has few natural resources and must import more than 80% of its food from neighboring countries or Europe. Health care, particularly outside the capital, is limited by poor infrastructure, shortages of equipment and supplies, and a lack of qualified personnel. More than a third of health care recipients are migrants because the services are still better than those available in their neighboring home countries. The nearly universal practice of female genital cutting reflects Djibouti’s lack of gender equality and is a major contributor to obstetrical complications and its high rates of maternal and infant mortality. A 1995 law prohibiting the practice has never been enforced.Because of its political stability and its strategic location at the confluence of East Africa and the Gulf States along the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, Djibouti is a key transit point for migrants and asylum seekers heading for the Gulf States and beyond. Each year some hundred thousand people, mainly Ethiopians and some Somalis, journey through Djibouti, usually to the port of Obock, to attempt a dangerous sea crossing to Yemen. However, with the escalation of the ongoing Yemen conflict, Yemenis began fleeing to Djibouti in March 2015, with almost 20,000 arriving by August 2017. Most Yemenis remain unregistered and head for Djibouti City rather than seeking asylum at one of Djibouti’s three spartan refugee camps. Djibouti has been hosting refugees and asylum seekers, predominantly Somalis and lesser numbers of Ethiopians and Eritreans, at camps for 20 years, despite lacking potable water, food shortages, and unemployment.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 30.71%(male 136,191 /female 135,263)\n\n15-24 years: 21.01%(male 87,520 /female 98,239)\n\n25-54 years: 39.63%(male 145,427 /female 204,927)\n\n55-64 years: 4.82%(male 18,967 /female 23,639)\n\n65 years and over: 3.83%(male 15,136 /female 18,708) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 56.5 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 50.1 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 6.4 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 15.6 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 24.2 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 22.4 years\n\nfemale: 25.7 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 165\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.13% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 42\n\nBirth rate\n\n23.3 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 59\n\nDeath rate\n\n7.5 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 109\n\nNet migration rate\n\n5.5 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 21\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmost densely populated areas are in the east;

Three-fourths of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scant rainfall and less than 4% arable land limits crop production to small quantities of fruits and vegetables, and most food must be imported.Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. Imports, exports, and reexports represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal. Reexports consist primarily of coffee from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An official unemployment rate of nearly 40% - with youth unemployment near 80% - continues to be a major problem. Inflation was a modest 3% in 2014-2017, due to low international food prices and a decline in electricity tariffs.Djibouti’s reliance on diesel-generated electricity and imported food and water leave average consumers vulnerable to global price shocks, though in mid-2015 Djibouti passed new legislation to liberalize the energy sector. The government has emphasized infrastructure development for transportation and energy and Djibouti – with the help of foreign partners, particularly China – has begun to increase and modernize its port capacity. In 2017, Djibouti opened two of the largest projects in its history, the Doraleh Port and Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway, funded by China as part of the \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" which will increase the country’s ability to capitalize on its strategic location.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$3.64 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$3.411 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$3.203 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 183\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$2.029 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n6.7% (2017 est.)\n\n6.5% (2016 est.)\n\n6.5% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 26\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$3,600 (2017 est.)\n\n$3,400 (2016 est.)\n\n$3,300 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 185\n\nGross national saving\n\n22.3% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n38.1% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n19% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 81\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 56.5% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 29.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 41.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0.3% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 38.6% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -66.4% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 2.4% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 17.3% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 80.2% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nfruits, vegetables;

Djibouti is one of the few remaining countries in which the national telco, Djibouti Telecom (DT), has a monopoly on all telecom services, including fixed lines, mobile, Internet and broadband; the lack of competition has meant that the market has not lived up to its potential (2018)\n\ndomestic: Djibouti Telecom (DT) is the sole provider of telecommunications services and utilizes mostly a microwave radio relay network; fiber-optic cable is installed in the capital; rural areas connected via wireless local loop radio systems; mobile cellular coverage is primarily limited to the area in and around Djibouti city; 4 per 100 fixed-line, 43 per 100 moblie-cellular (2018)\n\ninternational: country code - 253; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 & 5, EASSy, Aden-Djibouti, Africa-1, DARE-1, EIG, MENA, Bridge International, PEACE Cable, and SEACOM fiber-optic submarine cable systems providing links to Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia and Africa; satellite earth stations - 2 (1 Intelsat - Indian Ocean and 1 Arabsat) (2019)\n\nBroadcast media\n\nstate-owned Radiodiffusion-Television de Djibouti operates the sole terrestrial TV station, as well as the only 2 domestic radio networks; no private TV or radio stations; transmissions of several international broadcasters are available (2019)\n\nInternet country code\n\n.dj\n\nInternet users\n\ntotal: 111,212\n\npercent of population: 13.1% (July 2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 175\n\nBroadband - fixed subscriptions\n\ntotal: 24,389\n\nsubscriptions per 100 inhabitants: 3 (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 147\n\nMilitary and Security\n\nMilitary and Security\n\nMilitary and Security\n\nMilitary and security forces\n\nDjibouti Armed Forces (FAD): Djibouti National Army (includes Navy, Djiboutian Air Force, National Gendarmerie); Djibouti Coast Guard (2019)\n\nMilitary service age and obligation\n\n18 years of age for voluntary military service; 16-25 years of age for voluntary military training; no conscription (2012)\n\nMaritime threats\n\nthe International Maritime Bureau reports offshore waters in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden remain a high risk for piracy; the presence of several naval task forces in the Gulf of Aden and additional anti-piracy measures on the part of ship operators, including the use of on-board armed security teams, contributed to the drop in incidents; there was one incident in the Gulf of Aden and none in the Red Sea in 2018; Operation Ocean Shield, the NATO/EUNAVFOR naval task force established in 2009 to combat Somali piracy, concluded its operations in December 2016 as a result of the drop in reported incidents over the last few years; the EU naval mission, Operation ATALANTA, continues its operations in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean through 2020; naval units from Japan, India, and China also operate in conjunction with EU forces; China has established a logistical base in Djibouti to support its deployed naval units in the Horn of Africa\n\nTransportation\n\nTransportation\n\nTransportation\n\nNational air transport system\n\nnumber of registered air carriers: 2 (2015)\n\ninventory of registered aircraft operated by air carriers: 4 (2015)\n\nCivil aircraft registration country code prefix\n\nJ2 (2016)\n\nAirports\n\n13 (2013)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 151\n\nAirports - with paved runways\n\ntotal: 3 (2017)\n\nover 3,047 m: 1 (2017)\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 1 (2017)\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 1 (2017)\n\nAirports - with unpaved runways\n\ntotal: 10 (2013)\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 1 (2013)\n\n914 to 1,523 m: 7 (2013)\n\nunder 914 m: 2 (2013)\n\nRailways\n\ntotal: 97 km(Djibouti segment of the 756 km Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway) (2017)\n\nstandard gauge: 97 km1.435-m gauge (2017)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 127\n\nRoadways\n\ntotal: 2,893 km (2013)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 159\n\nMerchant marine\n\ntotal: 15\n\nby type: other 15 (2018)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 144\n\nPorts and terminals\n\nmajor seaport(s): Djibouti\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorist groups - foreign based\n\nal-Shabaab: aim(s): punish Djibouti for participating in the African Union Mission in Somalia;

Kuwait is chief investor in the 2008 restoration and upgrade of the Ethiopian-Djibouti rail link; in 2008, Eritrean troops moved across the border on Ras Doumera peninsula and occupied Doumera Island with undefined sovereignty in the Red Sea\n\nRefugees and internally displaced persons\n\nrefugees (country of origin): 13,242 (Somalia) (2019)\n\nTrafficking in persons\n\ncurrent situation: Djibouti is a transit, source, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; economic migrants from East Africa en route to Yemen and other Middle East locations are vulnerable to exploitation in Djibouti; some women and girls may be forced into domestic servitude or prostitution after reaching Djibouti City, the Ethiopia-Djibouti trucking corridor, or Obock – the main crossing point into Yemen; Djiboutian and foreign children may be forced to beg, to work as domestic servants, or to commit theft and other petty crimes\n\ntier rating: Tier 2 Watch List – Djibouti does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, Djibouti was granted a waiver from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3 because its government has a written plan that, if implemented would constitute making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; one forced labor trafficker was convicted in 2014 but received a suspended sentence inadequate to deter trafficking; authorities did not investigate or prosecute any other forced labor crimes, any sex trafficking offenses, or any officials complicit in human trafficking, and remained limited in their ability to recognize or protect trafficking victims; official round-ups, detentions, and deportations of non-Djiboutian residents, including children without screening for trafficking victims remained routine; the government did not provide care to victims but supported local NGOs operating centers that assisted victims (2015)\n\nFlag of Djibouti\n\nFlag of Djibouti\n\nFlag of Djibouti"
