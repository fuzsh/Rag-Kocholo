        "text": "header2 Key Developments in 2021\n\nPresident Guelleh was elected to a fifth term in April with over 97 percent of the vote, according to the Interior Ministry. The main opposition parties boycotted the poll, claiming that the election administration would be neither free nor fair. The African Union (AU) observation mission reported the poll was run competently with no noted misconduct.\n\nIn August, intercommunal fighting broke out between people from the ethnic Afar minority group and people from the majority Issa group in Djibouti City. At least a dozen people were killed—mainly Afar individuals—several others were injured, and houses were set on fire. The Djiboutian Human Rights League (LDDH) alleged that security forces waged a “coordinated attack” against Afar civilians, claiming both plainclothes police and uniformed officers took part in the violence.\n\nIn November, Fouad Youssouf Ali, a former air force pilot who was arrested in 2020, was referred to a criminal court and convicted of attempting to incite a coup and of attempted theft of military property. The court sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment with an additional fine of 300,000 Djiboutian francs ($1,700). Ali’s 2020 arrest and alleged torture had sparked nationwide protests."
