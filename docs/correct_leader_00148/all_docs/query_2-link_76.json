        "text": "General Information\n\nDjibouti is a developing nation classified as lower middle income. Located in eastern Africa along the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea (north of Somalia), the climate is classified as predominantly dry (arid).\n\nVaccinations\n\nYellow Fever\n\nSee also: Library article for Yellow Fever\n\nAlthough yellow fever does not occur in Djibouti, an official yellow fever vaccination certificate may be required depending on your itinerary.\n\nRequirement: A certificate proving yellow fever vaccination is required for travelers aged ≥ 1 year coming from countries with risk of YF transmission. This also applies to airport transit stops (no exit through immigration checkpoint) longer than 12 hours in risk countries.\n\nOther Vaccines\n\nDepending on your itinerary, your personal risk factors, and the length of your visit, your health care provider may offer you vaccination against COVID-19, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, or typhoid fever. Routine immunizations, such as those that prevent tetanus/diphtheria or \"childhood\" diseases, should be reviewed and updated as needed.\n\nMalaria\n\nSee also: Library article for Malaria\n\nThe following is current information as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC):\n\nWHO—International Travel and Health (current online update, Country List)\n\n(2021) Malaria risk due predominantly to P. falciparum exists throughout the year in the entire country.\n\nRecommended prevention: C – Risk of P. falciparum malaria, in combination with reported chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. Mosquito bite prevention plus atovaquone–proguanil or doxycycline or mefloquine chemoprophylaxis (select according to reported side effects and contraindications) a\n\naAlternatively, for travel to rural areas with low risk of malaria infection, mosquito bite prevention can be combined with stand–by emergency treatment (SBET).\n\nWHO Country List footnote: When available, the date of the most recent update or confirmation is indicated in parentheses in the country list. If no date is indicated, the most recent update or confirmation was provided before 2013.\n\nCDC—Health Information for International Travel (current online edition)\n\nAreas with malaria: All.\n\nDrug resistance3 : Chloroquine.\n\nMalaria species: P. falciparum 90%, P. vivax 5%–10%.\n\nRecommended chemoprophylaxis: Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine, or tafenoquine.4\n\n3 Refers to P. falciparum malaria unless otherwise noted.\n\n4 Primaquine and tafenoquine can cause hemolytic anemia in people with G6PD deficiency. Patients must be screened for G6PD deficiency before starting primaquine or tafenoquine. See Tafenoquine Approved for Malaria Prophylaxis and Treatment for more information.\n\nOther Concerns\n\nTravelers' Diarrhea\n\nSee also: Library article for Travelers' Diarrhea\n\nHigh risk exists throughout the country, including in deluxe accommodations. Community sanitation and food safety measures are generally inadequate. Some itineraries (e.g., remote destinations, austere accommodations) and activities (e.g., ecotourism, eating street or local-market food) further increase risk.\n\nTravelers should observe food and beverage precautions, which reduce the likelihood of illness.\n\nTravelers should carry loperamide for self-treatment of diarrhea and, if risk is moderate to high, an antibiotic to add if diarrhea is severe. Consult a knowledgeable health care provider regarding which antibiotic is appropriate for you and most effective for your destination.\n\nOther Food-Borne Illnesses\n\nPrecautions to prevent brucellosis, seafood poisoning may be needed.\n\nInsect- and Arthropod-Borne Diseases\n\nChikungunya, dengue, leishmaniasis, West Nile virus may pose a risk. Personal protective measures are important.\n\nOther Disease and Health Risks\n\nAdditional concerns include Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, helminths, leptospirosis, marine hazards, schistosomiasis, sexually transmitted infections, snakebites, tuberculosis.\n\nConsular Advice\n\nConsular Travel Advice\n\nDue to military conflict, Australia (DFAT) advises avoiding travel to within 10 km (6.2 mi) of the border with Eritrea and 10 km (6.2 mi) of the border with Somalia. UK (FCO) and Canada (GAC) have more limited warnings. US (DOS) has no current warning.\n\nTerrorism Risk\n\nRisk of attack by transnational terrorist groups exists throughout the country. Targets may include domestic and international organizations and businesses; public places and events, including those frequented by tourists; and transportation systems.\n\nCrime\n\nNegligible risk of violent crime exists throughout the country.\n\nModerate risk of petty crime exists throughout the country, especially in isolated locations, including Dorale and Khor Ambado beaches.\n\nCivil Unrest\n\nProtests and demonstrations may infrequently occur and have the potential to turn violent without warning. Bystanders are at risk of harm from violence or from the response by authorities. Disruption to transportation, free movement, or the ability to carry out daily activities may occur.\n\nUnsafe Areas\n\nArmed conflict and territorial disputes may occur in areas bordering Eritrea. Landmines and other unexploded ordnance are present in areas bordering Ethiopia and Somalia. Unmarked boundaries exist in border areas. Piracy (involving commercial and private leisure vessels) may occur in coastal and international waters.\n\nWater Safety\n\nRent water sports equipment from reputable operators. Scuba dive only with personnel certified by PADI or NAUI, and use equipment only from PADI- or NAUI-certified dive operators.\n\nTransportation Safety\n\nNational incidence data on traffic-related injury or death are not available.\n\nNatural Disasters\n\nExtreme heat (which can lead to heat-related illness) occurs from May through October.\n\nSeismic and volcanic activity frequently occurs.\n\nConsular Information\n\nSelected Embassies or Consulates in Djibouti\n\nUnited States: [+253] 21-45-30-00; dj.usembassy.gov\n\nCanada: [+253] 21-35-59-50; travel.gc.ca/assistance/embassies-consulates/djibouti\n\nUnited Kingdom: U.K. does not have an embassy or consulate in Djibouti.\n\nAustralia: [+253] 21-35-38-44\n\nDjibouti's Embassies or Consulates in Selected Countries\n\nIn the U.S.: www.djiboutiembassyus.org\n\nIn Canada: Djibouti does not have an embassy or consulate in Canada.\n\nIn the U.K.: Djibouti does not have an embassy or consulate in the U.K.\n\nIn Australia: Djibouti does not have an embassy or consulate in Australia.\n\nVisa/HIV Testing\n\nHIV testing is not required to obtain a tourist, work, or residence visa."
