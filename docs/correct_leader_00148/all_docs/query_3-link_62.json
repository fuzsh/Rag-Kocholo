        "text": "R 070053Z MAR 01\n\nFM AMEMBASSY DJIBOUTI\n\nTO SECSTATE WASHDC 1476\n\nINFO IGAD COLLECTIVE\n\nAMEMBASSY SANAA\n\nUSCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL//CCJ4/7/CCJ5//\n\nUNCLAS DJIBOUTI 000401\n\nDEPT FOR AF/E\n\nCENTCOM ALSO FOR POLAD\n\nE.O. 12958: N/A\n\nTAGS: PGOV PREL DJ\n\nSUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: NEW PRIME MINISTER NAMED\n\nREF: DJIBOUTI 00265\n\n1. PRESIDENT ISMAIL OMAR GUELLEH ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 4\n\nTHE APPOINTMENT OF DILEITA MOHAMED DILEITA AS PRIME\n\nMINISTER. DILEITA IS AN AFAR, AND IS PRESENTLY\n\nDJIBOUTIAN AMBASSADOR TO ETHIOPIA. THE PREVIOUS PRIME\n\nMINISTER, BARKAT GOURAD HAMADOU, RESIGNED FEBRUARY 6\n\nBECAUSE OF POOR HEALTH, REF A. SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN\n\n1977 THE PRESIDENT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN AN ISSA AND\n\nTHE PRIME MINISTER AN AFAR. THERE IS SPECULATION,\n\nINCLUDING BY THE GOVERNMENT NEWS AGENCY, THAT\n\nDILEITA'S APPOINTMENT IS THE BEGINNING OF A CABINET\n\nRESHUFFLE. THE POSITION OF PRIME MINISTER IS LARGELY\n\nCEREMONIAL, WIELDING LITTLE POWER.\n\n2. THE APPOINTMENT IS AN INTERESTING COMPROMISE,\n\nBECAUSE DILEITA IS NOT A PARTY MEMBER OF EITHER THE\n\nRULING RPP, OR THE OPPOSITION FRUD. HE IS KNOWN TO BE\n\nCLOSE TO THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER. MOST PEOPLE HAD\n\nPREDICTED THAT ONE OF THE PROMINENT AFARS IN THE RPP\n\nWHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET WOULD GET THE NOD, SUCH\n\nAS ALI GUELLEH ABOUBAKER, PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF;\n\nMOHAMED DINI FARAH, MINISTER OF HEALTH; OR ALI MOHAMED\n\nDAOUD, MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE.\n\n3. DILEITA MOHAMED DILEITA WAS BORN MARCH 12, 1958 IN\n\nTADJOURAH, DJIBOUTI TO AN INFLUENTIAL FAMILY. HE WENT\n\nTO HIGH SCHOOL IN CAIRO, EGYPT AND RHEIMS, FRANCE, AND\n\nRECEIVED A DEGREE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS FROM A COLLEGE IN\n\nMEDEA, ALGERIA IN 1981. THE NEXT YEAR HE BEGAN A\n\nDIPLOMATIC CAREER IN THE DJIBOUTIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY.\n\nBY 1985 HE HAD THE RANK OF EMBASSY COUNSELOR, BUT\n\nREMAINED IN DJIBOUTI. IN 1986 HE TRAINED IN THE\n\nFRENCH MINISTRIES OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\nIN 1988 HE BECAME DEPUTY HEAD OF PROTOCOL IN THE\n\nPRESIDENT'S OFFICE. IN 1993 HE BECAME COUNSELOR FOR\n\nCONSULAR AFFAIRS AT THE DJIBOUTAN EMBASSY IN PARIS,\n\nWHERE HE REMAINED UNTIL BEING APPOINTED AMBASSADOR TO\n\nETHIOPIA IN 1996. HE IS DIVORCED WITH ONE CHILD.\n\n4. BARKAT, AGE 70, HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER FOR 22\n\nYEARS. FOLLOWING A STROKE MARCH 11, 2000, HE SPENT\n\nSIX MONTHS IN A PARIS HOSPITAL. HE RETURNED TO\n\nDJIBOUTI OCTOBER 2, PARTLY PARALYZED. MANY PEOPLE HAD\n\nTHOUGHT THAT BARKAT'S LEAVING THE JOB WAS AN OPENING\n\nFOR PROGRESS IN THE POWER-SHARING NEGOTIATIONS WITH\n\nTHE FRUD. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED WING OF THE\n\nFRUD SIGNED A PEACE ACCORD FEBRUARY 7, 2000 THAT ENDED\n\nSIX YEARS OF OCCASIONALLY VIOLENT CLASHES, AND HAVE\n\nBEEN NEGOTIATING EVER SINCE. THE ARMED WING OF THE\n\nFRUD IS LED BY AHMED DINI AHMED WHO SERVED BRIEFLY AS\n\nPRIME MINISTER JUST AFTER INDEPENDENCE. THE\n\nNEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN GOING WELL LATELY, AND IT\n\nWAS THOUGHT THAT THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP MIGHT BE A\n\nBARGAINING CHIP WITH THE FRUD.\n\n5. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME OUT\n\nOF THE COUNTRY RECENTLY. HE HAS BEEN BACK IN DJIBOUTI\n\nFOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING TRIPS TO KHARTOUM AND\n\nASMARA, AND HE LEAVES FOR BEIJING IN THE NEXT COUPLE\n\nOF DAYS. THE PRESIDENT DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE\n\nAFRICAN SUMMIT ON AFRICAN UNION IN SIRTE, LIBYA,\n\nAPPARENTLY PREFERRING TO WORK ON DOMESTIC POLITICS.\n\nBECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER'S JOB IS LARGELY\n\nCEREMONIAL, IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT\n\nMISS THE SIRTE CONFERENCE JUST TO SELECT SOMEONE FOR\n\nTHIS ONE POSITION, AND MORE CABINET CHANGES WILL BE\n\nMADE SOON. HOWEVER, PREDICTING WHOLESALE CABINET\n\nCHANGES HAS BEEN POPULAR SPORT EVER SINCE ISMAIL OMAR\n\nGUELLEH CAME TO POWER IN APRIL 1999, YET THE ONLY\n\nCHANGE HE HAS MADE SO FAR IS TO NAME A NEW PRIME\n\nMINISTER.\n\nYAMAMOTO"
