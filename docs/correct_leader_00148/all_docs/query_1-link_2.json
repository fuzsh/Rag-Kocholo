The African Studies Centre in Leiden (ASC), the Institute of African Affairs in Hamburg (IAA) and the Nordic Africa Institute in Uppsala (NAI) – all very active AEGIS centres sharing similar profiles – accepted this challenge and their joint efforts first bore fruit in the initial volume of the series in 2004. In 2007, the Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation in Uppsala (DHF) joined this international project, while the NAI ended its involvement with the fifth volume published in 2009. For this current volume Rolf Hofmeier once again joined us as sub-editor for the Eastern Africa section. The country-specific articles cover domestic politics, foreign affairs and socioeconomic developments in the states of sub-Saharan Africa during the calendar year under review. While we recognise the impossibility of finding fully objective indicators for the relative importance of each of the states covered by the Yearbook, the length of the country-specific articles aims to reflect the approximate weight of each country. The four sub-regions are also introduced by means of an overview article. Further overviews summarise general continental developments, European-African relations and the United Nations and Africa. The Yearbook is based on scholarly work, but oriented towards a wider target readership, including students, politicians, diplomats, administrators, journalists, teachers, practitioners in the sphere of development cooperation and business people. Without forcing the individual contributions too much into a straitjacket, the volume is primarily concerned with providing factual (though not necessarily neutral) information. Each issue, in focusing almost exclusively on developments during the particular calendar year, provides a completely fresh annual overview of events and thereby adds to the cumulative record of ongoing developments. We wish to express our gratitude to all the contributors for their collaboration in this endeavour and to the partner institutions in AEGIS for encouraging us to embark on this ambitious project. With this volume, the Yearbook has entered a new phase and left behind the initial “probation period” of five years. Carol Rowe as language editor and Bas van der Mije as coordinator have joined the team. We thank them for their solid support,\n\nviii • Preface as well as Brill Publishers for their continued commitment. Last but not least, we note with appreciation and gratitude the ongoing support of our three institutions, remaining loyal to turning the original idea into reality.

Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nThe effects of the global financial crisis, resulting in the slow down of most economies in the industrialised countries, continued to have a negative impact, especially on the resource-rich economies in the region. Most countries registered a marked decline in their economic growth rates, albeit still managing to maintain modest economic growth. Low oil prices and dramatically lower world market prices for copper, diamonds and other primary export commodities left their mark on trade balances. The emerging economies of China, as well as India and Brazil, managed to use this to create new opportunities by consolidating their ties with African countries and extending their economic relations. The regional interim EPAs the EU sought to impose on African partner countries remained contested and provoked massive dissent and resistance. Continental policies were confronted with new calls for conflict mediation in countries such as Madagascar and remained occupied with matters concerning Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania and Zimbabwe as some of the more prominent hot spots. The ICC indictment of Sudanese President al-Bashir initially met with a seemingly united front against what was declared to be selective external interference in African affairs, but it soon became obvious that Africa did not speak with one voice. Similarly, differences also emerged in response to the continued initiatives of the Libyan leader Kadhafi with regard to his Pan-African visions and ambitions. A series of elections in eight countries brought no political changes but reinforced the trend towards dominant party systems, which consolidated and further entrenched the political control of specific elites running parties and states. The further decline in the relevance of NEPAD indicated that what had originally been considered a new chapter in African collective responsibility and political enlightenment was in fact more of the same, despite several further efforts to maintain the APRM as a new tool enhancing best practice.\n\nAfrica in the Global Economy Gloom over the world economic downturn led to pessimistic forecasts about Africa’s ability to weather the storm. While fears were expressed that Western countries would cut development spending, African governments called on both Western and Asian powers to allocate portions of their economic stimulus measures to poorer countries. The World\n\n2 • Sub-Saharan Africa Economic Forum on Africa, held in Cape Town on 10–12 June, added demands for better terms of trade and enhanced market access (not encouraged by the US-EU moratorium on such concessions introduced the previous year after the collapse of the WTO’s Doha round). The World Bank and IMF warned at their spring meetings that 55 to 90 m more people in the world might become trapped in poverty and a total 1 bn could face hunger, with Africans disproportionately represented in both cases. Assessments about the effects of the global economic downturn nevertheless varied, with the IMF predicting overall output growth for Africa at 1% (down from 3%). This still amounted to a 1% per capita decline, and fears that the earlier advances in reducing poverty could be reversed were not put at rest. Indeed, figures published during the first quarter of 2010 showed that average economic growth in Africa plummeted to 2.5% according to the OECD, as compared with an overall growth figure of 5.9% the previous year. Petroleum exporting countries were hard hit, as oil prices fell to $ 34 a barrel (though then climbing back to around $ 59 at mid year). Countries that felt the downturn more than others were those better linked to the world financial system, such as Kenya and Ghana, and Southern Africa experienced the strongest effects because of the importance of the mining sector. Copper prices halved as compared with the previous year (causing unemployment in Zambia and DRC), diamond sales were down (hurting mainly the economies of Namibia and Botswana), and asset prices on the Johannesburg stock exchange fell. In early 2010, the IMF said there had been a 16.4% drop in 2009 trade volume/value. The World Bank warned that private capital flows were drying up, and in a preliminary estimate the OECD reported that foreign direct investment fell by more than a third in 2009. As Africans in the diaspora faced salary and job cuts, remittances decreased by 6.6% according to a World Bank study published in the spring of 2010. Surprisingly, official development assistance (ODA) remained more or less at pre-crisis levels and countries, such as Italy, that cut back on development spending were the exception. In contrast to the overall gloomy picture, the IMF expected Africa to rebound to ca. 4% growth in 2010. Domestic prices for rice, maize, millet and sorghum in sub-Saharan Africa were by April still significantly higher than in the previous year. The WFP estimated that food prices were above the five-year average in 19 out of the 20 countries studied. Eastern Africa in particular faced food insecurity. The EU released some € 394 m from its food facility, created in the wake of the 2008 African food riots and to be disbursed to numerous countries in and outside Africa. The FAO called on donor countries to devote 17% of ODA to agriculture. With 80% of African smallholdings confined to 2 hectares or less and fertiliser use limited to 13 kg a hectare (against 73 kg in the Middle East and 190 kg in east Asia), a lot remained to be done, not least in the area of transport. Thirty per cent of Africans were said to be suffering from chronic hunger and malnutrition. Numerous countries continued to be net food importers (though countries such as Malawi and Rwanda had undergone remarkable ‘green revolutions’, which made them bread baskets\n\nSub-Saharan Africa • 3 in the sub-regions). Thus, there was enough food for talk at the World Food Security Summit in Rome, 16–18 November, boycotted by Western countries due to the attendance of Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe. For their part, Asian countries complicated the picture by continuing the purchase of land for commercial agriculture in countries such as Madagascar and Tanzania. The Rome summit resolved to renew efforts to achieve the first MDG (halving hunger by 2015). African initiatives in the field of food security involved, among other things, a new partnership between NEPAD and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. Demographic developments showed the importance of the issue, with the population of sub-Saharan Africa this year estimated to have exceeded 1 bn. With an overall population growth of 3% during the previous two decades, Africans were deemed to be poorer than in the mid 1970s. Most GDP growth rates have been below the 6%-8% mark needed to diminish poverty. Thus, migration to Europe remained an option for many, marred by incidents such as the drowning of more than 300 Africans who were trying to reach Italy from Libya at the end of March, and the flight of more than 900 immigrants from a southern Italian town in January after mafia-led vigilante violence against African farm workers. Italy, like Spain, the UK and other industrialised countries, cut foreign worker quotas in response to the downturn. With rich countries $ 20 bn behind on their 2005 Gleneagles aid pledges, the results of this year’s G8 summit proved less of an earthquake than the one that had rocked the conference’s venue (the Italian town of L’Aquila). World leaders said they would commit $ 20 bn in farm aid over three years as part of a Food Security Initiative. It was unclear, however, how much of this money was new. The World Bank sought to fast-track $ 42 bn of its 2008 $ 100 bn bailout package for developing countries and to channel this in the form of IDA grants and interest-free loans to Africa. The Bank’s director lobbied rich countries for a vulnerability fund to be fed by 0.7% of their fiscal stimulus spending, but the response from the North was poor. The IMF disbursed more aid from its Exogenous Shocks Facility. A new framework for loans was announced for the poorest countries, involving resources that would boost concessional lending to $ 17 bn until 2014. The Fund was also more flexible about African governments boosting budget spending in response to the crisis. In February, the Bank agreed that Africa should get a third seat on its Executive Board. While this still left the region under-represented, the Committee on IMF Governance Reform agreed that 12 out of the 20 seats on the IMF Council would be reserved for developing countries. IMF quotas were to be reviewed but, with European countries standing to lose most out of this, results were not likely to come fast. African finance ministers created a new institution, the African Investment Bank (AIB), with Nigeria, South Africa and North African countries owning 50% of the shares. To be based in Tripoli, Libya, it was to complement the activities of the AfDB with a projected capital base of $ 4 bn. The G20 summit in London (2 April), preceded by a high-level con-\n\n4 • Sub-Saharan Africa ference of African development ministers in Dar es Salaam on 10–11 March, promised an increase in lending to poor countries of $ 100 bn by multilateral development banks. Meeting on 24–25 September in Pittsburgh, the group of leading and emerging economies (including South Africa) reiterated calls for institutional reform of the IMF. China made it clear that the economic crisis was a particularly Western phenomenon, pledging that it would not cut aid or backtrack on past debt waivers. During a four-nation tour in January, President Hu Jintao laid the foundation stone of a bridge in Senegal, and also granted $ 22 m in aid to Tanzania, besides visiting Mali and Mauritius. At a meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt (8–9 November), the Chinese offered Africa $ 10 bn in concessional lending over the next three years. They also promised to improve market access to China (zero tariffs for 95% of goods from the least developed African states, beginning with 60% by 2010), cancellation of debt and increased social responsibility on the part of Chinese companies active in Africa. African delegates responded enthusiastically and China’s economic weight was underlined by the fact that, for the first time, the country became the continent’s prime trading partner, surpassing the US – the value of whose imports from Africa plummeted as a result of the collapse in oil prices. India expected that its trade with Africa would reach the value of $ 100 bn in the next five years, identifying mining, chemicals, infrastructure, information technology and agriculture as the principal areas for expansion. Several of these issues were discussed at the India-Africa Business Partnership summit in New Delhi (21 January), attended by 14 African leaders. At the 4th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD, at ministerial level), on 21–22 March, Japan announced $ 500 m in new aid, on top of an older pledge to double aid to Africa. Most of the new money would be spent on food assistance and fighting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Japan’s motivations were influenced by concern over Chinese dominance of African trade and the desire to secure a seat at a reformed UN Security Council. South-South cooperation led, among other things, to a summit of African and Latin American countries in Lomé, Togo (27 September), where it was decided to establish a ‘Bank of the South’. The bank, with a start-up capital of $ 200 bn, would finance joint projects. The annual United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum, held under the AGOA, took place in Nairobi on 4–6 August, attended by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Discussions focused on an extension of the Act, affording African nations preferential access to US markets beyond the expiry date of 2015. The conference also recommended the US scale down subsidies, notably to its own cotton farmers, which heavily damaged cotton producers in West Africa. While more than 6,400 products could enter the US duty-free under the AGOA, a report of the Brookings Institution made clear that the Act principally benefited oil exporting countries, such as Angola and Nigeria. Energy-related products accounted for some 96% of AGOA-covered African exports to\n\nSub-Saharan Africa • 5 the US. As a result of the economic downturn, US imports of non-oil products fell by 22%. At year’s end President Obama ended trade benefits for Guinea, Madagascar and Niger – all three embroiled in political crises – for not meeting AGOA demands on good governance and the rule of law. By contrast, Mauritania was reinstated in the programme and Kenyan exporters were given an extension, although the US was still not satisfied with Kenyan reforms.\n\nAfrican Union At the first summit, held in Addis Ababa from 1 to 4 February, Libya’s leader Kadhafi was elected to the chairmanship of the Assembly, a post that had eluded him in the past. Kadhafi entered the conference hall accompanied by a retinue of chiefly rulers from various countries, who formed part of the ‘Forum of Kings, Sultans, Princes, Sheikhs and Customary Chiefs’ established by Libya the previous year and who had bestowed on Kadhafi the title of ‘king of kings’. The heads of state bore the spectacle with patience, although Uganda’s President Museveni threatened to arrest traditional leaders who spoke in Kadhafi’s name – he had already cancelled a forum of traditional leaders in Kampala that was financed by Libya. Libya’s leader retorted that he would destroy Museveni ‘like he had destroyed Mbeki’. Having set the tone, the Union got embroiled in the perennial debate on institutional reform. AU Commission President Ping tried to limit discussion of Kadhafi’s new plan for a ‘United States of Africa’, but the maverick leader re-launched the issue during the summit’s last day. His plan had already led to heated exchanges, with several countries, notably in Southern Africa, having opposed his election to the Assembly chair – in vain, because it was North Africa’s turn and Libya, as one of the Union’s principal funders, could not be ignored. So-called ‘gradualist’ countries (Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, South Africa, Namibia) pointed out that peace and security issues had to precede the immediate continental government Kadhafi was said to be craving and that the sub-regional communities were stepping stones in this process. Uganda dismissed Kadhafi’s ideas as impractical. South Africa largely agreed with Museveni, who extracted the concession that the AU should not dispatch the Libyan leader to the G20 summit in London on his own but that he should be accompanied by his predecessor, President Kikwete of Tanzania, and Museveni himself. Libya’s plans were supported by Déby of Chad and President Wade of Senegal, although the latter also presented an alternative plan in which 20 countries (mainly from West and North Africa) would commence the project of continental integration. Wade explained to Kadhafi that he could not have his way and the debate ended in the compromise decision that the Commission would become the AU’s ‘Authority’, of which Ping would continue to be the president but with the current Commissioners renamed cabinet\n\n6 • Sub-Saharan Africa ‘secretaries’, responsible for ‘areas of shared competence’. Kikwete emphasised that the new ‘secretaries’ would receive portfolios different from those they had held before to make the change more real. He spoke in generalities without setting any time schedule. Moreover, it was agreed that the Authority would not be introduced until the next summit and Ethiopia, Uganda and South Africa managed to impose the condition that the reform could only be introduced by a modification of the Constitutive Act, requiring ratification by all member states. The Executive Council met in extraordinary session on 15–16 April in Tripoli in an effort to make the institutional reform more tangible. However, many of these issues remained matters of dispute and, in typical AU fashion, were deferred to the next summit (1–3 July), which again became the scene of heated exchanges. With the venue changed from Antananarivo to Sirte in Libya because of the unconstitutional takeover in Madagascar, Kadhafi presented a text on the Authority that differed completely from what had been discussed in Tripoli. He tried to rush it through, but the diplomatic Ping openly expressed disapproval. Nigeria became involved in a sharp exchange with the Libyans, and Tanzania and Ethiopia refused to discuss the revised text. Angola was also vehemently opposed (Uganda’s Mueseveni had refused to attend the summit altogether). An insulted Kadhafi left the conference hall for his mid-day prayer and, when he was urged to come back by the presidents of Mali and Gambia, the heads of state hammered out a compromise, which involved, among other things, the decision that the Authority would have a defence coordinator, in addition to the nine secretaries, president and vice-president. However, the institution’s new ‘powers’ still depended on an explicit mandate from the member states and the changes would still have to be ratified. Kadhafi typically presented the outcome as a success – raising the possibility of putting the idea of continental government to a referendum in all member countries. Other institutional matters concerned the Pan-African Parliament (PAP), which asked the Addis summit for an increase in its budget but saw its funding cut from $ 12.9 m to $ 9.5 m. There was dissatisfaction about the expenses of MPs and the cut in funds meant that the PAP would have to reduce its election missions to member states, one of its prime areas of work. On 29 May, it elected the Chadian Idriss Ndele Moussa to succeed the parliament’s chairperson Gertrude Mongella, whose performance in the role had not helped the institution. Four new vice-presidents were elected and it was hoped this would ameliorate relations between the PAP, headquartered in South Africa, and the overall Union. Several conflicts were on the summit agendas, including the perennial conflagration in Somalia, the Darfur mission and several unconstitutional takeovers (Guinea, Madagascar, Niger). On 2 February, the EU and the AU signed the new Africa Peace Facility, involving European funding to a value of € 300 m for the period up to 2010 and the development of an early response mechanism. The AU’s peacekeepers (AU Mission in Somalia – AMISOM) were still not at full strength (4,300 at the start of the year instead of the maximum\n\nSub-Saharan Africa • 7 8,000), although Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Malawi made new troop offers. In order to emphasise its support for the official president, the Somali head of state was invited to participate in the Union’s first summit, which also called on the UN to impose a sea blockade and no-fly zone on Eritrea for its help to Somalia’s insurgent forces. In July, the AU accepted a recommendation by IGAD to beef up the mandate of the Union peacekeepers and lift the ban on peacekeepers from neighbouring countries. A special summit in Tripoli on 31 August–1 September discussed a range of conflicts, including the political turmoil in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and the Great Lakes area. The leaders once more threatened Madagascar with sanctions if its new leader would not come to a transition arrangement with other political forces. The response to developments in Mauritania was weakened by Kadhafi’s support for its coup leader, which complicated the role of Commission President Ping. The problems in Guinea were tackled by way of a special PSC meeting on 8 July, among other measures. On 19–23 October, the AU convened a special summit in Kampala, sponsored by the UNHCR, where member states adopted a convention on IDPs. Member states’ commitment to the international legal order was marred by selective political attitudes. Senegal continued backtracking on the AU-sponsored trial of the former Chadian dictator, Habré. The Senegalese representative at the Addis summit claimed his country required some CFAfr 18 bn (more than € 27 m) to pursue the case. The ICC’s case against Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir for his role in Darfur continued to produce disagreement with Western powers. The Sirte summit refused to act on the arrest warrant against Bashir and complained that the AU’s request to the Court to defer the indictment had been ignored. Although around 30 African countries are party to the ICC statute, many felt the Court’s prosecutor was biased towards pursuing African cases. Exceptionally, Botswana did not agree with this majority opinion, which risked tarnishing the Union’s image in the same way as that of its predecessor, the OAU.\n\nGovernance The 20th summit of the NEPAD Heads of State and Government Implementation Committee (HSGIC) was held on 31 January at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa ahead of the 12th AU summit. It dealt mainly with the integration of NEPAD into the structures and processes of the AU and the appointment of the new chief executive for the NEPAD secretariat. In his opening address, Ethiopian head of state Meles Zenawi emphasised the need to further eliminate dysfunctionality and to embrace change. He urged the implementation of the decision already taken at the AU’s 10th ordinary session a year earlier to integrate NEPAD into AU structures. AU Commission President Ping noted that significant strides had been made towards the integration of NEPAD. The initiative’s only remaining autonomy was confined to the continued physical location of its secretariat in the South\n\n8 • Sub-Saharan Africa African city of Midrand (between Pretoria and Johannesburg) with the status of an AU office outside headquarters. With Ibrahim Hassan Mayaki from Niger, NEPAD had a new CEO whose task was to finalise the integration of NEPAD into AU structures and processes and to implement NEPAD as a programme of the AU. The remaining issue to be solved was the future financing of the NEPAD secretariat, whose budget of $ 6 m a year was never met. Ping therefore identified the need for the HSGIC to secure its financing. The year basically brought an end to the once highly applauded initiative, which had been seen as an alternative and innovative way to promote good governance and NEPAD was effectively demoted to become an economic agency integrated into the AU headquarters. Nonetheless, the APRM continued to be considered as the NEPAD flagship, although no further countries joined the queue of those registered for the review process during the year. Cape Verde will become the 30th country to have signed up once formalities are completed. Three APRM missions were undertaken during the year: in Mali, Mozambique and Lesotho. In mid-year the APRM secretariat launched a project to “streamline and fasttrack” the APRM. According to its annual report, bi- and multilateral partners had contributed almost $ 13 m at continental level between 2003 and 2009, compared with $ 20.5 m contributed by member states. Algeria, Nigeria and South Africa paid more than half of this amount, while many countries remained in arrears on their minimum annual contribution of $ 100,000. In January, Nigeria’s elder statesman and experienced international civil servant Adebayo Adedeji was re-confirmed in the rotating chairmanship for another full year. This decision by AU chairperson Meles Zenawi raised eyebrows over the lack of respect for constitutional principles. For most of the year, the APRM secretariat was as negatively affected as the overstretched NEPAD secretariat, and was mainly preoccupied with internal power struggles, bickering and other destructive in-fighting (including controversies over the appointment of the members of the panel of eminent persons and efforts to compromise their autonomous role), and intensified efforts by governments to discredit the legitimacy of the peer review process and its results by manipulating the reports. As a result, inefficiency and delays in delivery of reports increased and the APRM was as paralysed as the NEPAD secretariat. Even the supportive ‘APRM Monitor’, published by the Partnership Africa Canada, noted with concern in its June issue: “The slow pace of renewal of the membership of the Panel of Eminent Persons and of the staff at the APRM Secretariat, and the lack of transparency of both processes, does a disservice to the APRM. Moreover, the fact that the APRM Secretariat chooses not to have an efficient and open communications strategy only compounds the problem.” The year provided a new development with regard to the ranking of African countries on their governance performance, when a split occurred between the Mo Ibrahim Foundation and a team from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, previously tasked to compile the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance. Rival reports were presented, on 1 October in Johannesburg by the latter, and by the former on 5 October in\n\nSub-Saharan Africa • 9 Cape Town. The controversies seemed to be over ownership and control of the compilation, which highlighted the partly political nature of such assessments. In substance, however, few differences were visible in the rankings. Somalia remained the worst-governed country in terms of human rights, with Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya and Sudan close behind and the CAR competing for bottom place with regard to health, education and freedom from poverty with Zimbabwe, and Chad not far after. Southern Africa was the sub-region with the most positive aggregate figure and had six countries among the top ten performers, while Central Africa was the worst average scoring of the sub-regions. According to Mo Ibrahim, some 26 to 27 countries on the continent had improved in general governance. As the regional office of the International Federation of Journalists warned in its annual report for the year, however, press freedom had never been so threatened on the continent, adding that elections did “not necessarily guarantee that the political protagonists and stakeholders do respect press freedom”.\n\nElections The year provided for some crucial elections and referendums. Not a single election could be considered as a breakthrough on the path to democracy. It became rather clear that the many hybrid and authoritarian regimes were about to stabilise their rule. Frequently, results produced between a two-thirds and a three-quarters majority (whether elections were openly manipulated or not). An established pattern of easy wins for former liberation movements was in train in Southern Africa. Arguably most international attention was paid to legislative elections in the Republic of South Africa. The result was a disappointment for all those who had expected that the defections from the ruling African National Congress (ANC) would alter its position of dominance. The 65.9% of votes it gained also permitted the indirect election in parliament of Jacob Zuma as the new president to succeed Thabo Mbeki. The similarly dominant position of the South West African People’s Organisation (SWAPO) in Namibia was also not challenged in presidential and parliamentary elections, with the ruling party and presidential candidate Hifikepunye Pohamba receiving more than 74% and 75% of the votes respectively. Likewise, elections in Mozambique produced “more of the same”. President Guebuza received a slightly higher percentage of votes in the presidential elections (76%) than his ruling Frelimo (75%) in parliamentary elections. Democratic standards were arguably higher in Botswana and Malawi, although without bringing about change in the ballot box. In Malawi, Bingu Wa Mutharika, who was accused of becoming increasingly authoritarian, could rely on his solid popularity with the poor in his country and won elections with 66.2% of the votes against John Tembo with 30.5% (which was well below expectations, particularly in his stronghold) and five competitors who received less than 1% each. Tembo refused to accept the results and challenged them in court, while EU election\n\n10 • Sub-Saharan Africa observers gave an overall positive judgement on the quality of the voting process. Bingu’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) received a smaller share of the vote in the parallel legislative elections (58.9%), but this still led to a comfortable majority in the National Assembly (113 out 192 seats), with independents taking 32 seats, ahead of the 27 won by Tembo’s Malawi Congress Party (MCP). In Botswana’s legislative election, the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) was able to augment its lead from 51.7% to 53.3% of the vote, while the two main competing parties, the Botswana National Front (BNF) and the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) fared differently, the former losing 4.1% (21.9% in total), and the latter boosting its votes by 2.5% (to 19.1%). This was translated into small gains in seats for BDP and BCP and a damaging loss of six seats for the BNP. Botswana confirmed its role as one of the best established democracies on the continent. In Central African politics, there was equally no major change: In Congo (Brazzaville), after contested results, Denis Sassou Nguesso again emerged as the winner of the presidential elections with 78.6% of the votes. Even less competitive presidential elections were held in Equatorial Guinea, with results that could have been forecast: 95.8% for President Obiang Nguema. After the death of Omar Bongo Ondimba, a kind of dynastic succession was engineered in Gabon, with Bongo’s son Ali winning his first election with 41.7% of the vote (a relative majority in one round of elections being sufficient). Comoros’ parliamentary elections confirmed the rule of Union president Abdallah Sambi, with his Baobab coalition securing 19 out of 24 seats. An earlier referendum with a particularly low turnout of about 50% permitted changes to the constitution favouring the union government over the individual islands’ administrations. Sambi and the presidents of Grande Comore and Mohéli increasingly appeared to be on a collision course. In March, a referendum in the only French possession in the Archipelago produced an overwhelming vote of 95% in favour of becoming France’s fifth overseas department in 2011 (from its former status as overseas collectivity).\n\nCoups and Unconstitutional Rule Extra-constitutional changes of government, as well as extra-constitutional governmental behaviour, occurred more frequently than in previous years. West Africa saw a number of problematic developments that had repercussions in the electoral field. Coup leader Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz in Mauritania was elected president by a slight margin (52.6%). Niger’s increasingly authoritarian leader, Mamadou Tandja, instigated a constitutional referendum to allow him to extend his mandate. Described by his opponents as a “coup from above”, Tandja’s move to change the country’s constitution set the stage for him to continue his rule and subsequently run for new full terms. The existing constitution had expressly banned him from doing so. Tandja organised a referendum in August, which was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court. Tandja therefore dissolved the\n\nSub-Saharan Africa • 11 Court, and held the referendum, which showed an overwhelming majority in favour of his plans but threw the entire polity into a deep crisis. In October, parliamentary elections were held – boycotted, like the referendum, by the opposition, which allowed Tandja’s MNSD to take 76 out of 113 seats. Tandja was of course not the only African president bending the rules, but this was probably the most visible case. Elections in Côte d’Ivoire were further postponed, President Gbagbo was about to extend his rule to an entire second five-year term without being elected since 2000. However, heads of state could also be victims of political murder: in Guinea Bissau President Vieira was shot by soldiers seeking revenge for the killing of the army’s chief of staff in a bomb explosion only hours before. In an apparent quick return to constitutional rule, the speaker of the National Assembly, Raimundo Pereira, was sworn in as interim head of state only three days later, and new elections were announced. Political violence marred the pre-election phase with further political assassinations. In the second round, the candidate of the ruling ‘Partido Africano da Independência da Guinea e Cabo Verde’ (PAIGC), Malam Bacai Sanhá, won a clear victory (63.3% to 36.7%) over former president Kumba Yala of the ‘Partido da Renovação Social’ (PRS). At least no further incidents had overshadowed the election of Sanhá. Madagascar’s President Marc Ravalomanana was overthrown in a coup after weeks of popular protest in the capital Antananarivo. His main challenger and mayor of the capital, Andry Rajoelina, was sworn in immediately. Ravalomanana resigned when he realised that he had lost the support of the military hierarchy, but did not renounce his ambitions. International mediators brokered a power-sharing deal to end a long period of violence, but a sustainable consensus between the main actors was not tangible at year’s end. Even more dramatic was a series of political crises following the coup d’etat by Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara in Guinea in 2008. Initial popular support faded when Camara showed keen interest to stay in power instead of returning to the barracks as initially announced. A major opposition demonstration ended with the massacre of scores of opposition supporters by junta soldiers in a Conakry stadium in September. In December Camara was shot in the head by one of his own bodyguards, who had apparently been designated to take responsibility for the stadium killings. While Camara’s injuries were being treated in a Moroccan hospital, more moderate officers seized the opportunity to take control. It soon became clear that they did not want Camara to resume power, so that their action was effectively a new coup d’etat.\n\nPeace and War Overall, the level of violence in on-going armed conflicts was lower than before, with Somalia the obvious exception. Nevertheless, the need to keep peacekeeping missions in place was as strongly resented as ever, pointing to the on-going risk of re-escalation in\n\n12 • Sub-Saharan Africa most former arenas of war. Six UN missions (DRC, Chad/CAR, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and Sudan, plus Western Sahara) and the hybrid AU/UN mission in Sudan were maintained on African soil. The AU mission in Somalia, the CEEAC mission in the CAR and the EU forces in Chad and the CAR (until March) had to be added, plus the 1,800 French soldiers deployed in Côte d’Ivoire under the ‘operation Licorne’ label – a total of nearly 66,000 troops. As fragile as ever, the CAR witnessed new attacks by rebel movements in the north and the east throughout the year, while the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) attacked villages in the south-east. Ugandan government forces intervened with limited success. Neighbouring Chad saw further serious rebel activity, but repulsed a rebel attack on Goz Beida in early May. In spite of this, the country looked more stable than in many previous years. The newly formed alliance between the governments of the DRC and Rwanda was taken as good news for peace in an unstable sub-region and allowed for a joint operation against rebel movements in North Kivu, although this failed to halt the violence. In fact, new scores of civilians were forced to leave their villages. In comparison with previous years, Sudan’s Darfur province saw also fewer confrontations, except in the month of May. Several rounds of peace talks were, however, inconclusive. When the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) held discussion rounds with the government facilitated by the government of Qatar in Doha, the second important rebel movement, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) chose not to participate. Libya hosted further talks in October, aimed at bringing a number of smaller factions together. The associated tensions between the governments of Chad and Sudan continued, despite fresh rounds of talks starting in May. In parallel, tensions grew in Southern Sudan ahead of the referendum for independence scheduled for 2011, but appeared to be mostly ethnically tainted violence between groups in the south. An estimated 2,500 people were killed in various clashes, with the epicentre located in the major town of Malakal (Upper Nile). In the nearby state of Jonglei, armed Murle, Bor Dinka and Lou Nuer militias engaged in fresh fighting. In addition, two branches of the Nuer group fought each other. And, in October, forces loyal to Paulino Matip (Nuer) and the Dinka-dominated SPLA forces battled in the oil-producing area of Bentiu, necessitating intervention by the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS). The mixture of local land disputes and cattle raids, sometimes intensified by the return of demobilised soldiers and displaced people, plus the prospect of new oil discoveries, again turned the south into a powderkeg. Somalia was the only country at war in Africa with more or less unchanged high levels of violence, including terror attacks perpetrated by al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam that led to the killing of several top members of the transitional government. One attack targeted the AU peacekeeping mission’s compound, killing almost a dozen people, including the Burundian deputy force commander. In May, a new battle for Mogadishu led to the conquest of a greater share of urban territory by al-Shabaab. Suicide bombings and reports of\n\nSub-Saharan Africa • 13 foreigners and diaspora Somalis participating in terror missions again drew international attention to the conflict. Shifting alliances between members and leaders of the warring groups characterised the year in southern Somalia. Somaliland, while on the whole peaceful, also experienced violent incidents. In November, a top military commander was shot and killed. The low-intensity border conflict in the Sanaag-Sool and eastern Togdheer regions between Puntland and Somaliland saw no major change.\n\nTerrorism and Piracy Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) significantly raised the level and intensity of its activity in Mauritania, as well as in Mali. On 22 January, AQIM operatives abducted four Europeans along the Mali-Niger border and demanded ransoms plus the release of a Palestinian cleric held in the United Kingdom. A British tourist in this group was killed when the demands were not met. A US citizen and NGO worker was later shot in Mauritania. A suicide bombing near the French embassy in Nouakchott was a further signal of AQIM vitality in this country. Finally, on 29 November, three Spanish aid workers were kidnapped. In Mali, an army convoy was attacked by AQIM-related fighters in July and several soldiers were killed. In Niger, three Saudi tourists were killed in late December. The US military presence on the continent, very much related to the self-assigned mission to combat terrorism, was more indirectly felt than directly seen. The decision on whether to move the Africa command (AFRICOM) from Stuttgart (Germany) to Africa was postponed until 2012, officially to allow the command to gain greater understanding of its long-term operational requirements. In reality, few African governments were eager to host a large US military installation within their borders and SADC had even publicly denounced AFRICOM. The South African government said it would not tolerate the presence of an American military structure on its soil. Nigeria, Libya and Botswana made similar statements. The US administration had internal discussions about the obvious failure to create sympathy for AFRICOM in African capitals. In the Sahel, the Obama administration sought increased funding for the Trans-Saharan Counter-Terrorism Program ($ 20 m in 2010) and begun a special security assistance programme for Mali to provide the country with all-terrain vehicles and communications equipment worth $ 5 m, and 300 special forces advisers carried out training exercises with the Malian army. In addition, the administration requested an extra $ 60 m in the 2010 financial year to pay for the operations of the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), as well as $ 249 m to pay for the operation of the 500-acre base at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti, plus $ 41.8 m for major improvement construction projects at the base. CJTF-HOA, operating under the aegis of AFRICOM, provided logistical support and supplies to the French-led training of 500 soldiers of the official, but weak, Transitional Federal Government in Somalia. The meteorological (and oceanographic) department of\n\n14 • Sub-Saharan Africa the task force was deployed to Uganda from 28 September to 3 October in preparation for the humanitarian exercise “Natural Fire”. More importantly, the CJTF-HOA was expanding its range to include Comoros, Mauritius and Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. In January, the US Navy inaugurated a Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151), and on 3 May handed over the command to Turkey. CTF-151 was primarily meant to combat piracy and free CTF-150, operating since 2002 and currently under French command, to combat terrorism, its original task. Together with NATO and the European naval operation Atalanta, the vessels at the disposal of the two CTFs made up for an impressive armada. They were able to report some success, but did not manage to halt pirate activities. In fact, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reported that there were 406 reported incidents of piracy and armed attacks on the high seas during the year, the highest level in six years, and that attacks were becoming more frequent and violent: 217 attacks on vessels were recorded with 47 of them successful. Attacks remained concentrated in the Gulf of Aden between Yemen and the northern cost of Somalia and along Somalia’s eastern coastline. The threat from piracy in the Indian Ocean arguably increased because additional resources were being committed to piracy by Somali and Yemeni ‘investors’ and because of the increasing sophistication of the tactics and technology available. Pirates operating off the coast of Somalia also expanded their forays into an area stretching to the Seychelles and even Madagascar. The business of piracy flourished with seaborne gangs seizing several cargo ships and demanding millions of dollars in ransom. Among the most spectacular acts was the hijacking in January of a German-owned tanker carrying liquefied petroleum gas in the Gulf of Aden. In April, Somali pirates also seized a US-flagged container ship with 20 American crewmembers on board. The ship’s cargo was 400 containers of food aid, including 232 containers belonging to the World Food Program and destined for Somalia and Uganda. On 19 October, a Chinese coal carrier with 25 Chinese crewmembers aboard was kidnapped. A US super tanker, carrying crude oil from Saudi Arabia to the United States worth more than $ 20 m, was also seized. But West Africa’s coasts became increasingly dangerous, too. On 24 November, pirates attacked a German-owned oil tanker off the coast of Benin, robbing the tanker and killing a Ukrainian officer onboard. However, most attacks occurred along the Nigerian coastline. The Nigerian authorities recorded more than 40 pirate attacks on tankers, barges, oil-industry back-up vessels and oil platforms involving robbery, damage to vessels, and the injury and kidnapping of ships’ crews, as well as the hijacking of vessels. According to the IMB, the waters of Nigeria became the second most dangerous in the world, after Somalia. Attacks were also recorded all along the Gulf of Guinea in the waters stretching from Angola in the south to Guinea in the west. Equipped with new technology, seaborne rebels and pirates also continued to operate in coastal towns. In February, pirates attacked Equatorial Guinea’s island capital, where they tried to storm the country’s presidential palace. Motivations were not always clear as some groups carrying out attacks in the Gulf\n\nSub-Saharan Africa • 15 of Guinea described themselves as freedom fighters, while others were clearly nothing but well organised criminal gangs.\n\nEpidemics and Disasters People continued to suffer from natural disasters. Heavy seasonal rainfall caused floods in many parts of West Africa and Chad (July-August). Among the rivers that broke their banks and caused destruction were the Niger, Volta and Senegal rivers. About 1 m people were affected by the consequences of torrential rainfall in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone; about 200 people died. In Burkina Faso alone, about 150,000 people had to take shelter. Despite the floods, irregular rainfall in parts of northern Nigeria and Niger shortened the crop season and led to malnutrition in certain areas. Earlier, floods had hit Southern Africa (March-May) with Namibia, Zambia and Botswana most affected. The Zambezi carried enormous quantities of water, raising its level to unprecedented heights in many places. Despite the loss of crops, food security in Southern Africa improved compared with previous years. The effects of global climate change were most visible in Eastern Africa where Kenya experienced another very dry year. The severe cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe continued, with 55 out of 62 districts in all ten provinces affected. The infection rate declined slowly between February and May, but Mozambique and Zambia became equally heavily affected during the year. The WHO World Malaria Report 2009 recorded progress in the containment of malaria in the endemic countries, despite massive shortfalls in international disbursements to these countries. In 2008, 80% of external funds were targeted at the African region. Figures on the HIV/AIDS pandemic did not differ much from previous years. According to UNAIDS figures based on data for 2008, sub-Saharan Africa remained most heavily affected, with 67% of all people with HIV and 72% of AIDS-related deaths. It accounted for an estimated 1.9 m or 68% of new infections among adults and 91% among children. More than 14 m children had lost one or both parents to AIDS. The number of new infections on the continent decreased over time, but the number of people living with HIV increased, partly because of better treatment leading to longer life expectancy: 44% of those in need of antiretroviral therapy had access to treatment (in contrast to only 2% five years earlier). Significant variations in infection rates between countries and sub-regions continued, with most rates having stabilised, though at very high levels, especially in parts of Southern Africa. Women and girls remained disproportionally affected, with 60% of all infections. Andreas Mehler, Henning Melber & Klaas van Walraven\n\nII. United Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nThe work by the UN and the AU concerning the norm of a global ‘Responsibility to Protect’ (R2P) was in the spotlight during the year. On 21 July, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon presented his January report entitled ‘Implementing the Responsibility to Protect’ to the UN General Assembly (UNGA). Following this, an unprecedented UNGA plenary debate on the R2P took place (23–24 and 28 July). African state leaders, but also the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (UNSC), spoke in support of the R2P. African states called for a global consensus on R2P because of the prevalence of wars in sub-Saharan Africa. Their support also sprang from the fact that African institutions in this area are at the forefront of normative and institutional developments. This global meeting of 92 governments offered African states a rare occasion for positive attention: they upheld the continent’s contributions in adopting strong provisions for the prevention and halting of mass atrocity crimes and, in turn, received promises regarding assistance and capacity-building.\n\nAfrica in the UN African states earned recognition at the highest levels for the importance of their assistance in ongoing efforts to protect African civilians. Eighteen African states spoke at the July UNGA debate on the R2P. Among the stronger supportive voices were Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda and Sierra Leone, but also previous R2P sceptics, such as Algeria and South Africa. Sudan failed to convince other states that the purpose of the debate was to renegotiate the R2P. However, African states together helped ensure a continued important role for the UNGA in considering the norm and its implementation. This was to counter what some states, such as Sudan, consider a politicised Security Council control over the agenda, which might enable violations of sovereignty principles. On 14 September, the UNGA adopted by consensus a first-ever resolution on this topic, ensuring that body’s continued consideration of the R2P. Prominent Africans, such as Mohamed Sahnoun, Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan and Ngugi wa Thiong’o, spoke in favour of the norm throughout the year, as did African parliamentarians and representatives from African civil society. There was a critical sub-Saharan response to the indictment of Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The process\n\n18 • United Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa was officially initiated in April by Chief ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo. The AU, at its July Summit in Sirte, Libya, regretted that the UNSC had not acted on the AU’s request to defer the indictment of al-Bashir, which had been made on the grounds that the case against the Sudanese leader might undermine the delicate peace process underway in Sudan. In Sirte, African leaders decided to refuse to extradite al-Bashir to stand trial, pursuant to the provisions of Article 98 of the Rome Statute of the ICC relating to immunities of state officials. The only country to disagree with the decision was Botswana, while Chad “expressed reservations”. Nonetheless, representatives of South African civil society recalled that, as a State Party to the Rome Statute, South Africa was obliged to cooperate fully with the ICC in the arrest and transfer of al-Bashir to the ICC. The decision to refuse stood in conflict with South Africa’s constitution and laws. While African leaders did not achieve a deferral of the indictment process, a debate began at the highest levels to examine the ICC’s role in relation to Africa. It raised strong concerns with the “abuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction”, despite the existence of immunity for state officials. However, despite the AU’s defiant position, the organisation was at pains to stress its commitment to combating impunity and promoting democracy and the rule of law throughout Africa. In this context, it condemned the gross violations of human rights in Darfur and appointed an AU High-Level Panel on Darfur (AUPD). This investigatory panel symbolised the African view of Darfur as a case where the efforts of the AU, in cooperation with the UN, should be allowed to bear fruit and where peace talks and reconciliation (preferably indigenous) might produce a better result than penal justice as understood and carried out by a Court based outside of the continent. The AUPD’s intense efforts between March and October were endorsed at the AU Peace and Security Council meeting on 29 October. The AU initiated the implementation, through the existing AU-UN meditation framework and Chief Joint Darfur Mediator Djibril Bassolé, of a ‘roadmap’ towards a Global Political Agreement (GPA) for Sudan. A rare show of force and unity in global negotiations by African countries, together with other developing countries, helped mark the world summit on climate change in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. The Copenhagen Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended in chagrin. A non-binding accord was ultimately brokered by the US, China, India, South Africa, Brazil and the EU. It put in place a ‘pledge-and-review’ process, in which individual nations make voluntary commitments on emission cuts, to be verified by an international mechanism to be developed by the UNFCCC secretariat. This was unsatisfactory from a sub-Saharan African viewpoint. The African position on climate change built on the Nairobi Declaration from the Special Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), in collaboration with UNEP, in May. The African delegation pushed a ‘carbon justice’ agenda, demanding compensation for the damage to its economies caused by global warming on the grounds that Africa had contributing virtually nothing to it, and ensuring that the resource flow to Africa was not reduced. The Africa group, supported\n\nUnited Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa • 19 by the Group of 77 and China, walked out of negotiations in protest at what they saw as a move by developed countries away from commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, and away from binding stipulations for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and penalties for defaulters. This brought about a serious stalemate in negotiations, and put the focus on the lack of political will among richer states. Africa wanted carbon emission cuts to be raised to 40% by 2020 and developed countries to strengthen the institutional capacity of developing countries to adapt to the impact of climate change. AU Climate Negotiator, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, controversially asked for $ 10 bn a year in global short-term finance, with 40% of this for Africa, and long-term financing that would reach $ 50 bn by 2015 and $ 100 bn by 2020. He was criticised from within the African delegation, as his proposal did not press developed countries to commit themselves to capping greenhouse gas emissions. South Africa was also unhappy with Zenawi’s request, considering that at least double the amount of finance would be appropriate.\n\nPeace and Security A stronger AU-UN partnership was promoted by the UN Secretary General and his Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, Alain Le Roy, as well as the AU and the African Group in New York. Ban Ki-moon issued a report on 18 September about support to UN-authorised AU peacekeeping operations. It included a detailed assessment of the recommendations of the ‘Prodi panel’ (headed by former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi), released on 31 December the previous year. Ban Ki-moon’s report bore signs of intense consultation between the UN Secretariat and the AU Commission and relayed the AU’s request for the UNSC to discuss the Prodi report and to consider ways to ensure predictable, sustainable and flexible funding for AU-led peacekeeping operations. And, specifically, to examine, within the context of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, the possibility of funding, through the UN’s assessed contributions, peacekeeping operations undertaken by the AU or under its authority. The Secretary General noted that using UN-assessed funding for AU-led and UN-authorised peacekeeping operations on a caseby-case basis (for up to six months, to be provided mainly in kind, and when there was an intention to transition the mission to a UN peacekeeping operation) would underline the political support of the UNSC for peacekeeping operations at the regional level. However, such a proposal as a general rule remained sensitive. In a presidential statement in October, the UNSC merely agreed to consider all options. It recognised the AU’s view that, in deploying UN-authorised peacekeeping operations, the AU was contributing towards maintenance of international peace and security. Even so, some UN member states were concerned that UN-funded regional operations could dangerously put the the UN’s credibility at risk unless the AU implemented ‘appropriate’ political and security objectives. The UNSC called upon the AU to speedily develop a comprehensive capacity-building road map in consultation with the UN and other international partners. In addition, the\n\n20 • United Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa UN Security Council welcomed the intention of the UN Secretariat and the AU Commission to set up a joint task force on peace and security to review immediate and long-term strategic and operational issues. The UNSC also reiterated the importance of establishing a more effective strategic relationship with the AU Peace and Security Council, and between the UN Secretariat and the AU Commission, as had also been expressed in an AU-UN joint communiqué in May. Under the auspices of the 2006 AU-UN ten-year capacity-building programme, the UN Departments of Political Affairs, Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support worked with Africa on a number of initiatives, including capacity-building in mediation, elections, conflict resolution, early-warning, peacekeeping planning and operations, rule of law and security sector reform. Plans were made to better integrate the UN Secretariat presence in Addis Ababa. In order to more effectively engage the UN Secretariat and member states on the African peace and security issues on the UNSC agenda, the AU Commission also agreed to enhance the capacity of the Office of the Permanent Observer of the AU to the UN. On several occasions, the UNSC chose to defer to regional initiatives on specific situations. One example was ECOWAS’s response plan to the increasing drug trafficking and organised crime in West Africa. The AU Commission, in collaboration with the UN and its Specialised Agency on Drug Control (UNODC), as well as ECOWAS and other Regional Economic Communities (RECs), agreed to intensify the fight against drug trafficking in Africa, particularly in West Africa. The issue was raised during the year by Ugandan Ambassador Ruhakana Rugunda, chair of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa, by UN Special Representative and head of the UN Office for West Africa (UNOWA), Said Djinnit, as well as by UNODC. Another example was that the UN Security Council supported the actions taken by the AU and ECOWAS, and the mediation undertaken by Burkina Faso’s President Blaise Compaore with regard to political instability in Guinea. The UNSC and ECOWAS agreed to establish an international commission of inquiry to investigate the events that saw members of the army open fire on civilians attending a rally. The UNSC noted the decision by the AU Peace and Security Council to impose targeted sanctions against the president of the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD) and other individuals, and the decision of ECOWAS to impose an arms embargo on Guinea. Adding weight to the issue, the UN Security Council determined that Guinea might pose a risk to regional peace and security following the killings that occurred in Conakry on 28 September. Moreover, in a May presidential statement, the UNSC articulated its support for the AU’s condemnation of the resurgence of coups d’état. This built on a Ugandan draft presidential statement which had been circulated to support the AU’s February decision to condemn the coups that took place in Mauritania in August 2008 and Guinea in December 2008, and the attempted coup in Guinea-Bissau in August 2008. However, the UNSC chose not to comment specifically on the AU’s sanctions on countries such as Mauritania.\n\nUnited Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa • 21 At the end of the year, it decided to impose arms sanctions and an asset freeze on Eritrea for its rejection of the Djibouti Agreement and for its actions undermining peace and reconciliation in Somalia. This action had been requested at the July AU Summit. Additionally, Djibouti’s Permanent Representative to the UN had warned at the UNGA against ‘appeasing’ Eritrea’s ‘dangerous regime’. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) had six out of a total of 15 peacekeeping missions and one out of two political missions deployed in sub-Saharan Africa. 2009 marked the tenth year of the deployment of the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC). The mission endeavoured to protect civilians and to assist DRC government armed forces in their struggle against foreign armed groups, notably the Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda (FDLR) and the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), as well as home-grown militias. MONUC was severely criticised for its joint operations with government armed forces in taking on the FDLR. The ‘Kimia II’ campaign, launched in North and South Kivu, led to grave humanitarian consequences, such as reprisal attacks against civilians. Elements within the army were also involved in attacks on civilians. Such outcomes made MONUC a case in point as the UN Security Council reinvigorated its commitment to the protection of civilians and to the promotion of respect for the principles of international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law, in a November resolution – a timely decision, since it was the tenth anniversary of the theme ‘protection of civilians in armed conflict’ as a distinct consideration by the UNSC. The resolution made a clear link to African contributions, taking note of the AU’s adoption of the AU Convention for the Protection and Assistance of IDPs. The AU-UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) was the years’ costliest and the second largest in terms of personnel. The mission encouraged greater dialogue between local Sudanese authorities and IDPs and provided round-the-clock security patrols at IDP camps. UNAMID tried to enhance the capacity of the government and police to address human rights violations and inadequacies in the local judicial services, and it set up a gender crimes special investigation unit. The security situation remained volatile and the political process complex. Kidnappings, tribal clashes, banditry and attacks against peacekeepers complicated the mission’s work. Nine peacekeepers were killed in hostile actions. The humanitarian obstacles worsened following the ICC indictment of President al-Bashir: Sudan expelled 13 international NGOs from the country and shut down many national NGOs. By the close of 2009, the mission still lacked the requested 18 utility and five tactical helicopters, two surveillance aircraft and two heavy transport units. In response to an unusually violent and politically unstable year in southern Sudan, the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) undertook a proactive approach to peacekeeping. It defused tensions in the aftermath of violent clashes in several hotspots in the area of deployment through ‘robust patrols’ and by airlifting in leading members of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM). As inter-tribal turmoil escalated, the mission implemented a stabilisation programme in Jonglei State to curtail the fighting. Some\n\n22 • United Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa progress was achieved towards implementing the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in areas such as voter registration, police training and child protection, and on the issue of the disputed boundaries of the oil-rich area of Abyei. The National Congress Party (NCP) and the SPLM accepted the 22 July ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague on the Abyei boundary dispute. UNMIS helped launch the Sudan disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme. Marauding bands of gunmen belonging to the LRA continued terrorising communities living near southern Sudan’s border with the DRC and the Central African Republic (CAR). The UN Mission in the CAR and Chad (MINURCAT) was endowed with a military component as it assumed responsibilities from the EU force (EUFOR) on 15 March. The UNSC had authorised the deployment of 5,200 troops in January, tasking the mission to help create conditions conducive to a voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees (263,000 from neighbouring Darfur) and 180,000 IDPs encamped in eastern Chad at the start of the year. In mid-January, clashes between rebel factions and the CAR government resulted in a new influx of refugees from north eastern CAR into the Salamat region of Chad. The UNHCR estimated that approximately 16,000 new refugees arrived, bringing the total number of refugees receiving humanitarian aid in Chad to approximately 320,000. However, MINURCAT struggled to consolidate its presence, with just over 2,000 troops deployed. Force Commander Major-General Elhadji Mouhamedou Kandji (Senegal) directed the troops to advise and deploy the special Chadian security force, the Détachement Intégré de Sécurité (DIS) of around 820 men and women, to maintain law and order in refugee camps, IDP sites and surrounding towns. A new addition to field operations was the UN Support Office for the AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), dubbed UNSOA. This unique operation was headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, since Mogadishu remained at security level 5 for the UN (meaning no international staff can live there). In Nairobi, UNSOA and AMISOM cooperated and liaised with the UN Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) and the UN country team. UNSOA began implementing its mandate to deliver support packages to AMISOM similar to those of a traditional UN peacekeeping mission. Such logistical support was part of the UN’s ‘three-phase plan’ in Somalia: to strengthen the security sector of the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG), to create a ‘light footprint’ for the UN and, when conditions allow, to transition from AMISOM to a UN peacekeeping operation, pending SC approval. The AU has pushed strongly for such a transition, but the year merely saw continued discussions on bringing AMISOM’s force levels of just over 5,000 troops from Burundi and Uganda up to the mandated strength of 8,000. By the end of February, a newly elected government relocated to Mogadishu. AMISOM helped in holding strategic positions and government installations against threats from Somali extremists, aided and abetted by foreign fighters. One of the worst security incidents occurred on 17 September, when Al-Shabaab insurgents attacked the AMISOM force headquarters, killing 21 people including four Somali civilians and five Ugandan and 12 Burundian peacekeepers.\n\nUnited Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa • 23 Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, head of UNPOS, urged world leaders to provide AMISOM and the TFG with stronger diplomatic support and increased financial backing. In April, donors pledged around $ 200 m at a UN-EU sponsored conference in Brussels in support of AMISOM and Somali security institutions. Later in the year, over two-thirds of pledges had been collected. The UN Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) assisted the process leading up to national elections, which had been postponed but were expected for early 2010. It lent its boats, helicopters and land vehicles to carry equipment for use in a population identification and voter registration operation, reaching difficult to access localities. More than 6 m people registered throughout the country during the operation, which lasted from September 2008 to June. The UNSC and the Secretariat continued the process of a phased downsizing and demilitarisation of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). In September, the mission was extended for one more year, which is hoped to be the last. Liberia officially ended its DDR programme on 15 July. In less than five years, some 101,000 ex-combatants were disarmed and demobilised. The UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), Fund and Support Office were active in Burundi, CAR, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone. The Fund also supported peacebuilding projects in Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, the DRC, Kenya, Comoros and Somalia. The UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) worked with the government on implementing its Agenda for Change and the supporting UN joint vision for Sierra Leone. The PBC engagement in Sierra Leone was bolstered by approximately $ 37 m from the Peacebuilding Fund. Political missions in CAR (BONUCA) and GuineaBissau (UNOGBIS) are expected to transform into integrated peacebuilding offices in early 2010. Guinea-Bissau’s Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr. told the UNGA in September that his government deemed it essential to determine who was responsible for a series of assassinations of senior political and military figures earlier in the year, which had been condemned by the UNSC and the AU. He pledged on behalf of his government, which he said had come to power in recent elections that had been deemed free, fair and transparent by international observers, to facilitate the work of the committee tasked with finding out who carried out the killings. The UN Integrated Office in Burundi (BINUB) focussed on DDR activities and on assisting in the country’s preparations for elections next year. During Uganda’s presidency of the UNSC in July, a debate was held at ministerial level on post-conflict peacebuilding. The debate resulted in a presidential statement, reiterating the UNSC’s commitment to more effective and efficient peacebuilding, and sustainable development in post-conflict situations.\n\nEconomic Performance and Development In May, the Economic Report on Africa by the AU Commission and the ECA outlined the impact of the global economic crisis on African nations. The report set out the year’s\n\n24 • United Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa priorities for sub-Saharan Africa: modernising agriculture for development and industrialisation in Africa, ensuring food security, sustained poverty reduction, and integration of Africa into the global economy. It noted that Africa was heavily dependent on the agricultural sector for providing employment, generating economic growth, foreign exchange earnings and tax revenue. Though Africa was the continent with the largest agricultural potential per hectare and per capita, it remained a net food importer. To address these priorities, the report recommended working through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), adopted by the AU in 2003. Similarly, the theme of the AU Summit in July was ‘investing in agriculture for economic growth and food security’. African leaders re-enforced the 2003 Maputo Declaration commitment, to set aside 10% of their annual budgets for the agriculture sector, which has to date seen uneven implementation. They stated that the principal way to tackle the global food crisis was to offer assistance to small farmers. African states grew more outspoken on world economic affairs after the G8 Summit on 8–10 July, to which they were invited, revealed that the world’s richest nations were failing to meet their landmark pledge, made at the 2005 Gleneagles summit, to double to $ 50 bn a year by 2010 their aid to the poorest countries. The US and Britain were on course to meet their target shares, but Italy and France were falling short. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was perceived as failing to give a lead on aid at the L’Aquila summit. The meeting resulted in G8 leaders merely ‘reaffirming’ their Gleneagles promises. They agreed to review in 2010 the progress they had made towards meeting the MDGs by the 2015 deadline. With regard to food security, G8 leaders did agree to a food security initiative: a $ 20 bn package to tackle world hunger, including a switch from emergency relief to long-term agricultural projects. This was $ 5 bn more than planned, some of it ‘new’ money. African leaders wanted a follow-up and implementation of the G8 Summit decisions on Africa, but welcomed the food security initiative and the commitment of the UN High Level Task Force on Food Security to strengthen CAADP and to operationalise agricultural investment through it. The 64th UNGA centred on themes pertinent to sub-Saharan Africa, namely climate change, the MDGs and guiding principles of international cooperation, especially equity and democracy. At the UNGA annual high-level debate (23–30 September), African states including Lesotho and Benin urged donor countries to deliver on past pledges for official development assistance (ODA). They argued that this was even more necessary than before, given the context of a global financial crisis, which had had adverse effects in Africa, such as increased poverty and acute hunger, especially since the crisis was hitting hardest those who had no part in causing it. Using the same argument, Ban Ki-moon urged the simultaneous G20 meeting in Pittsburgh on 24–25 September to fulfill their aid pledges, beginning with the $ 50 bn for the poorest, pledged by the G20 summit in 2008. Earlier in the year, the G20 had pledged a $ 1.1 tr stimulus package for the world\n\nUnited Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa • 25 economy, the bulk of which was for developing countries. They had also agreed to give emerging and developing economies a greater voice and representation in international financial institutions. This was partly a result of efforts by South Africa, being the only country from sub-Saharan Africa with a seat on the G20 gathering. South Africa argued at the UNGA that the major international financial and institutions, including the World Bank and the IMF, needed reform so as to include representatives of the developing world in the process of forging a more equitable and stable global economic system. Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, the only representative from Africa outside of the G20, in his capacity as chair of NEPAD, asked for special funds to be made available for Africa immediately. Several African countries argued in the UNGA that the global trade system should be rectified to remove hindrances to poor nations’ participation in the global economy, and that G20 ‘commitment’ should translate into action on finalising the Doha Development Round of world trade talks. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, supported by AU and SADC, strongly condemned the ‘illegal’ sanctions against Zimbabwe by the US and the EU, adding that they were especially harmful in the midst of the current global economic crisis. In November, UN Deputy-SG Asha-Rose Migiro reiterated at a meeting of the ECA Regional Coordination Mechanism (RCM) that Africa’s efforts to meet the MDGs by 2015 were threatened by the impact of the global financial crisis. Participants examined how the UN system, international donors and African states might collaborate to implement the recommendations issued in July 2008 by the MDG Africa Steering Group chaired by Ban Ki-moon. The Group, once again, called for investments in agriculture, reforms of the global trade regime and short-term funds from donors to help the continent meet short-term needs that have arisen as a result of soaring food prices. It also urged African governments to work with global partners to launch a Green Revolution on the continent. Earlier in the year, UNCTAD had also recommended African states to build more resilient economies through deepening regional integration. Its report released in June, ‘Economic Development in Africa 2009: Strengthening regional economic integration for Africa’s development’, said that better links between countries, ranging from paved roads to banking cooperation, were needed to spur mutual economic growth, because weak physical and institutional infrastructure constituted key obstacles to increasing intra-African trade and investment. Towards the end of the year, agriculture and the food crisis were high on the global agenda. At a High-Level Expert Forum in October on How to Feed the World in 2050, FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf called on governments to ensure enhanced agricultural productivity if it were to feed a growing world population as well as respond to the environmental challenges ahead. He said the combined effects of climate change could reduce potential agricultural output by up to 30%. Recommendations relevant to Africa included a special focus on smallholder farmers, women and rural households, and their\n\n26 • United Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa access to land, water and high quality seeds and other modern inputs, increasing yield growth and improving cropping intensity by turning to organic agriculture rather than farming more land, despite the fact that there are still ample land resources with potential for cultivation in sub-Saharan Africa. The attention to these issues culminated at the World Summit on Food Security on 16–18 November in Rome. The FAO unveiled a $ 60 m five-year programme to encourage sustainable low-emission agriculture in developing countries. The FAO found that, while agriculture is responsible for 14% of greenhouse gas emissions, the sector has the potential to slash output by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Methods such as smallholder agriculture, conservation, organic agriculture, no or low tillage and use of compost or mulch, may account for almost 90% of agriculture’s potential to curb or remove emissions from the atmosphere. In addition, a $ 1 bn agreement was signed in Rome by the FAO, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and a leading Brazilian university. The agreement covers funding for agricultural development in 26 least-developed countries that are members of both the Bank and the FAO. The total investment in the IDB-FAO programme amounts to $ 5 bn by 2012. The guiding insight is that sustained investment in agriculture – especially smallholder agriculture – is acknowledged as the key to food security. This came as the FAO was warning that critical food insecurity was affecting 31 countries, the situation being particularly acute in East Africa, but also serious in West Africa. After the continuous attention on food security throughout the year, it was a disappointment that the more than 60 world leaders meeting at the food summit in Rome, agreed on a declaration without measurable targets or specific deadlines for eradicating world hunger. The summit unanimously adopted a declaration ‘renewing a commitment’ to eradicate hunger sustainably and at the earliest date. It did not go along with the FAO proposal to set a target of 2025 for total eradication of hunger from the face of the earth and increasing ODA to agriculture to $ 44 bn per year for investment in developing-country agriculture and rural infrastructure. It did, however, sign up to a ‘Global Partnership for Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition’, committed to renewed efforts to achieve the first MDG of halving hunger by 2015, improved international coordination through broadened participation by the public and private sector, international funding for agriculture in developing countries, and new investments in agricultural production there. To mitigate the impact of high food prices, the WFP launched an Emergency Market Mitigation Account initiative and allocated a total of $ 181 m to 18 priority countries in Africa alone to assist governments to meet the urgent call for high food price assistance through new and enhanced social safety nets.\n\nGovernance/Human Rights The African group in New York, and particularly South Africa, participated actively in the Durban Review Conference in Geneva, Switzerland (20–24 April). This was a follow-up meeting to the 2001 UN World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimi-\n\nUnited Nations and Sub-Saharan Africa • 27 nation, Xenophobia and Related Intolerances. African states were content that the meeting resulted in the adoption by consensus, by 182 states, of an outcome document that reaffirmed the political commitment to the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action (DDPA) of 2001. The document highlighted the continued existence of victims of many different sorts of racism and intolerance; it reaffirmed the positive role of freedom of expression in the fight against racism, while also deploring derogatory stereotyping and stigmatisation of people based on their religion or belief; and it launched a process to examine how the prohibition of incitement to hatred, as reflected in Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has been implemented in various parts of the world.

The AU welcomed the resolution passed by the US Senate in which it apologised for the slave trade and the racism that evolved from it. But this apology did not stop the AU from keeping the door open for reparative claims, a priority set, for example, by the expert group meeting on slavery in Banjul, Gambia, in June of the previous year. The AU deplored the boycott of the meeting by states such as Israel and the US. A related and positive surprise was that the US for the first time sought and achieved a seat for a three-year term on the UN Human Rights Council. Botswana and Namibia were leading in the process of getting the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People adopted by the UNGA in 2007. It was therefore significant that Botswana was one of the first countries to be reviewed by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedom of indigenous people. In March, the Rapporteur disclosed that Botswana’s indigenous peoples still struggle to gain access to health services, education and employment opportunities, despite national efforts"
