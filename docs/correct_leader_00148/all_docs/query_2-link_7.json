        "text": "One of the main strategic shifts of the Thirteenth General Programme of Work focused on driving public health impact in every country. For the programme budget 2020-2021, strengthening the capacity of WHO to deliver in countries, was one of the major areas for increased investment. This infusion of resources allowed country and regional offices to strengthen technical expertise in key areas to provide increased support and technical advice for countries.\n\nThis commitment was articulated through priority-setting at country level. As a result, the outcomes classified as high priority were allocated 87% of the total budget and received 86% of the total available funding. At a more granular level, 50% of these priority outcomes reached over 75% financing, which evidences the long-standing challenge of chronically underfunded priorities.\n\nThroughout the biennium, 57% of the total financing available was allocated to country level. Country offices received US$ 1.1 billion (32%) more financing in 2020-2021 than in 2018-2019 across all budget segments. 58% of the total implementation took place at country level.\n\nEnriched country-level information such as budget, financing and implementation, presented by strategic priority, global outcome and output can be visualized using the below link"
