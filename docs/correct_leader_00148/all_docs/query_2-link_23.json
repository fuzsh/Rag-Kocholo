        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nPresent-day Djibouti was the site of the medieval Ifat and Adal Sultanates. In the late 19th century, the Afar sultans signed treaties with the French that allowed the latter to establish the colony of French Somaliland in 1862. The French signed additional treaties with the ethnic Somali in 1885.\n\nTension between the ethnic Afar and Somali populations increased over time, as the ethnic Somalis perceived that the French unfairly favored the Afar and gave them disproportionate influence in local governance. In 1958, the French held a referendum that provided residents of French Somaliland the option to either continue their association with France or to join neighboring Somalia as it established its independence. Ethnic Somali protested the vote, because French colonial leaders did not recognize many Somali as residents, which gave the Afar outsized influence in the decision to uphold ties with France. After a second referendum in 1967, the French changed the territoryâs name to the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas, in part to underscore their relationship with the ethnic Afar and downplay the significance of the ethnic Somalis. A final referendum in 1977 established Djibouti as an independent nation and granted ethnic Somalis Djiboutian nationality, formally resetting the balance of power between the majority ethnic Somalis and minority ethnic Afar residents. Upon independence, the country was named after its capital city of Djibouti. Hassan Gouled APTIDON, an ethnic Somali leader, installed an authoritarian one-party state and served as president until 1999. Unrest between the Afar minority and Somali majority culminated in a civil war during the 1990s that ended in 2001 with a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Somali Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first multiparty presidential election resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH as president; he was reelected to a second term in 2005 and extended his tenure in office via a constitutional amendment, which allowed him to serve his third and fourth terms, and to begin a fifth term in 2021.\n\nDjibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the intersection of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Its ports handle 95% of Ethiopiaâs trade. Djiboutiâs ports also service transshipments between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The government has longstanding ties to France, which maintains a military presence in the country, as do the US, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, and China.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nEastern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, between Eritrea and Somalia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n11 30 N, 43 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 23,200 sq km\n\nland: 23,180 sq km\n\nwater: 20 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 150\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than New Jersey\n\nArea comparison map :\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 528 km\n\nborder countries (3): Eritrea 125 km; Ethiopia 342 km; Somalia 61 km\n\nCoastline\n\n314 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\nClimate\n\ndesert; torrid, dry\n\nTerrain\n\ncoastal plain and plateau separated by central mountains\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Moussa Ali 2,021 m\n\nlowest point: Lac Assal -155 m\n\nmean elevation: 430 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npotential geothermal power, gold, clay, granite, limestone, marble, salt, diatomite, gypsum, pumice, petroleum\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 73.4% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 0.1% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 73.3% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 0.2% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 26.4% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n10 sq km (2012)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nsalt water lake(s): Abhe Bad/Abhe Bid Hayk (shared with Ethiopia) - 780 sq km\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmost densely populated areas are in the east; the largest city is Djibouti, with a population over 600,000; no other city in the country has a total population over 50,000 as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nearthquakes; droughts; occasional cyclonic disturbances from the Indian Ocean bring heavy rains and flash floods\n\nvolcanism: experiences limited volcanic activity; Ardoukoba (298 m) last erupted in 1978; Manda-Inakir, located along the Ethiopian border, is also historically active\n\nGeography - note\n\nstrategic location near world's busiest shipping lanes and close to Arabian oilfields; terminus of rail traffic into Ethiopia; mostly wasteland; Lac Assal (Lake Assal) is the lowest point in Africa and the saltiest lake in the world\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 994,974\n\nmale: 450,796\n\nfemale: 544,178 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 162; male 164; total 162\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Djiboutian(s)\n\nadjective: Djiboutian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nSomali 60%, Afar 35%, other 5% (mostly Yemeni Arab, also French, Ethiopian, and Italian)\n\nLanguages\n\nFrench (official), Arabic (official), Somali, Afar\n\nReligions\n\nSunni Muslim 94% (nearly all Djiboutians), other 6% (mainly foreign-born residents - Shia Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Baha'i, and atheist)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nDjibouti is a poor, predominantly urban country, characterized by high rates of illiteracy, unemployment, and childhood malnutrition. Approximately 70% of the population lives in cities and towns (predominantly in the capital, Djibouti). The rural population subsists primarily on nomadic herding. Prone to droughts and floods, the country has few natural resources and must import more than 80% of its food from neighboring countries or Europe. Health care, particularly outside the capital, is limited by poor infrastructure, shortages of equipment and supplies, and a lack of qualified personnel. More than a third of health care recipients are migrants because the services are still better than those available in their neighboring home countries. The nearly universal practice of female genital cutting reflects Djiboutiâs lack of gender equality and is a major contributor to obstetrical complications and its high rates of maternal and infant mortality. A 1995 law prohibiting the practice has never been enforced.\n\nBecause of its political stability and its strategic location at the confluence of East Africa and the Gulf States along the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, Djibouti is a key transit point for migrants and asylum seekers heading for the Gulf States and beyond. Each year some 100,000 people, mainly Ethiopians and some Somalis, journey through Djibouti, usually to the port of Obock, to attempt a dangerous sea crossing to Yemen. However, with the escalation of the ongoing Yemen conflict, Yemenis began fleeing to Djibouti in March 2015, with almost 20,000 arriving by August 2017. Most Yemenis remain unregistered and head for Djibouti City rather than seeking asylum at one of Djiboutiâs three spartan refugee camps. Djibouti has been hosting refugees and asylum seekers, predominantly Somalis and lesser numbers of Ethiopians and Eritreans, at camps for 20 years, despite lacking potable water, food shortages, and unemployment.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 28.4% (male 141,829/female 140,696)\n\n15-64 years: 67.4% (male 290,654/female 379,778)\n\n65 years and over: 4.2% (2024 est.)

despite the country benefiting from its location as a hub for international submarine cables, prices for telecom services remain relatively high, and out of reach for a number of customers, weighing on market advancement; the Djibouti government is aiming to sell a minority stake in the incumbent telco (retaining some control of decisions) while securing the financial backing and the management acumen of a foreign operator; this is part of a larger plan to modernize the countryâs economy more generally; the state expects to conduct a sale of up to 40% of the company to an international investor (2023)\n\ndomestic: about 2 per 100 fixed-line teledensity and nearly 44 per 100 mobile-cellular (2021)\n\ninternational: country code - 253; landing points for the SEA-ME-WE-3 & 5, EASSy, Aden-Djibouti, Africa-1, DARE-1, EIG, MENA, Bridge International, PEACE Cable, and SEACOMÂ fiber-optic submarine cable systems providing links to Asia, the Middle East, Europe,Â Southeast Asia, AustraliaÂ and Africa; satellite earth stations - 2 (1 Intelsat - Indian Ocean and 1 Arabsat) (2019)\n\nBroadcast media\n\nstate-owned Radiodiffusion-Television de Djibouti operates the sole terrestrial TV station, as well as the only 2 domestic radio networks; no private TV or radio stations; transmissions of several international broadcasters are available (2019)\n\nInternet country code\n\n.dj\n\nInternet users\n\ntotal: 759,000 (2021 est.)\n\npercent of population: 69% (2021 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 157\n\nBroadband - fixed subscriptions\n\ntotal: 25,053 (2020 est.)\n\nsubscriptions per 100 inhabitants: 3 (2020 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 159\n\nMilitary and Security\n\nMilitary and security forces\n\nDjibouti Armed Forces (Forces ArmÃ©es Djiboutiennes or FAD): Army, Navy, Air Force; Djibouti Coast Guard\n\nMinistry of Interior: National Police (2024)\n\nnote: the National Police is responsible for security within Djibouti City and has primary control over immigration and customs procedures for all land border-crossing points, while the National Gendarmerie, which reports to the Ministry of Defense, is responsible for all security outside of Djibouti City, as well as for protecting critical infrastructure within the city, such as the international airport\n\nMilitary and security service personnel strengths\n\napproximately 10,000 active-duty military personnel; approximately 2,000 Gendarmerie (2023)\n\nMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitions\n\nthe FAD's inventory includes mostly older French and Soviet-era weapons systems, although in recent years it has received limited amounts of more modern, but largely secondhand equipment from a variety of other countries, including China, the Netherlands, and the US (2023)\n\nMilitary service age and obligation\n\n18 years of age for voluntary military service for men and women; 16-25 years of age for voluntary military training; no conscription (2023)\n\nMilitary deployments\n\napproximately 950 Somalia (ATMIS; note - ATMIS troop contingents are drawing down towards a final exit in December 2024); Djibouti has about 200 police deployed to the Central African Republic under MINUSCA (2024)\n\nMilitary - note\n\nDjibouti's military forces are largely focused on border, coastal, and internal security duties, such as counterterrorism; China, France, Italy, Japan, and the US maintain bases in Djibouti for regional military missions, including counter-terrorism, counter-piracy, crisis response, and security assistance (note â France has multiple bases and hosts troop contingents from Germany and Spain); the EU and NATO also maintain a presence to support multinational naval counter-piracy operations and maritime training efforts (2023)\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorist group(s)\n\nTerrorist group(s): al-Shabaab\n\nnote: details about the history, aims, leadership, organization, areas of operation, tactics, targets, weapons, size, and sources of support of the group(s) appear(s) in Appendix-T\n\nTransnational Issues\n\nRefugees and internally displaced persons\n\nrefugees (country of origin): 6,518 (Yemen) (mid-year 2022); 13,467 (Somalia) (2024)\n\nTrafficking in persons\n\ntier rating: Tier 3 â Djibouti does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; therefore, Djibouti was downgraded to Tier 3; the government took some steps to address trafficking, including partnering with international organizations to establish a shelter and provide services to victims, and directing creation of a national coordinating body to combat trafficking; however, officials did not report investigating or prosecuting any cases and did not convict any traffickers for the sixth consecutive year; prosecutors dropped trafficking charges or reclassified cases as other crimes with lower penalties, and judges did not incorporate provisions from the 2016 anti-trafficking law; no victims were identified for the fourth consecutive year, and protection services remained limited; the government lacked coordinated anti-trafficking efforts and did not draft a new National Action Plan to replace the expired plan; some officials continued to deny the existence of sex and labor trafficking in Djibouti (2023)"
