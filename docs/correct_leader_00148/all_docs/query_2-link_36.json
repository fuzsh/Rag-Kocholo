        "text": "The last Article IV Executive Board Consultation was on March 22, 2024. Listed below are items related to Djibouti.\n\nOn March 22, 2024 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2024 Article IV consultation with Djibouti and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal. Under Article IV of its Articles of Agreement, the IMF has a mandate to exercise surveillance over the economic, financial and exchange rate policies of its members in order to ensure the effective operation of the international monetary system. The IMF’s appraisal of such policies involves a comprehensive analysis of the general economic situation and policy strategy of each member country. IMF economists visit the member country, usually once a year, to collect and analyze data and hold discussions with government and central bank officials. Upon its return, the staff submits a report to the IMF’s Executive Board for discussion. The Board’s views are subsequently summarized and transmitted to the country authorities.\n\nThe authorities need more time to consider publication of the staff report and the related press release."
