        "text": "Attachments\n\nDownload Report (PDF | 2.23 MB)\n\nNATIONAL SOCIETY PROFILE\n\nThe Red Crescent Society of Djibouti was established in 1977 when Djibouti gained its independence and was admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in 1986. A note of recognition, signed by the President’s Office in October 1977, established a legal framework for the Djibouti Red Crescent. This recognizes the Djibouti Red Crescent as a voluntary organization with financial and administrative autonomy in the pursuit of its objectives, and as an auxiliary to public authorities.\n\nThe Red Crescent Society of Djibouti has a team of 41 (15 female and 26 male) employees, 14 of whom are based at the national headquarters with skills in disaster management, logistics, communication, finance, and management.\n\nFor several years, the Red Crescent Society of Djibouti has focused on supporting populations affected by disasters by distributing food and non-food items (NFIs). In the early 2000s, the Red Crescent Society of Djibouti extended its action by introducing interventions in the fields of health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and social protection for refugees from neighbouring countries who had requested asylum in Djibouti. In 2012, the National Society established a presence in Ali Addeh refugee camp by helping the asylum seekers maintain contact with family members who remained in their countries of origin. At the same time, it worked on strengthening the existing refugee resettlement programme.\n\nIt has systematically raised awareness of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement and worked to promote International Humanitarian Law (IHL).\n\nJOINT SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe Republic of Djibouti, covering an area of 23,200 kilometres, is in the Horn of Africa, at the junction of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, on the Gulf of Aden. It has 520 kilometres of continental borders and 372 kilometres of coastline. This gives it a strategic geographical position on one of the world’s main shipping routes and is a natural outlet for the region’s landlocked countries. In addition to the capital city of Djibouti, the country has five regions, namely Obock, Tadjourah, Dikhil and Ali-Sabieh.\n\nThe country’s population is estimated to be 1,136,455 according to the latest United Nations data. More than 75 per cent of the population live in urban areas and 65 per cent of the population consist of people under the age of 35.\n\nDjibouti is a highly arid country with little arable soil. Nearly 90 per cent of the country is classified as desert, with approximately nine per cent considered as pasture and about one per cent as forest. The vegetation terrain is comprised of arid lands scattered with shrubs throughout the country’s plateaus, plains, volcanic formations, and mountain ranges, some reaching 2,000 metres in height. Across the country, altitude varies from 155 metres below sea level at Lake Assal to over 2,000 metres at Mount Moussa Ali. The eastern region is dominated by high ridges and relatively deep ravines.\n\nWestern zones are comprised of regularly deepening plains and depressions marked by fracturing. The coastal plains, in the north of the country, include cliffs falling directly to the sea and pebble and sandy beaches.\n\nDjibouti is considered resource-scarce and is prone to natural disasters which can be further exacerbated by water scarcity, poor water management and poor land-use planning. With no permanent rivers for surface water and inadequate underground potential, the country faces challenges regarding access to clean and safe water. The water scarcity contributes to climate effects such as droughts.\n\nDjibouti is one of the most politically stable countries in the region with a low level of violence. In July 2023, 21,573 migratory movements were observed at flow monitoring points (FMPs) in Djibouti, with a daily average of 719 migratory movements. Of these, 4,621 (21 per cent) were observed in the Obock region where migrants cross the Gulf of Aden towards the Arabian Peninsula."
