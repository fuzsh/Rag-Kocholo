        "text": "(Adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China onâJuly 18, 2024)\n\nIn order to implement the strategic plans made at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the 20th CPC Central Committee studied the issue of further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization at its third plenary session. On this basis, it adopted this resolution.\n\nI. Great Significance and Overall Requirements\n\n(1) Importance and necessity\n\nReform and opening up have been crucial to theâcause of the Party and the people, enabling us to catch up with the times in great strides. The third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was a landmark event that ushered in a new period: one of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee was also of epoch-making significance. It marked the start of a new journey of comprehensively deepening reform in the new era with systematic and holistic plans, thus paving the way for a brand new stage in Chinaâs reform and opening up endeavors.\n\nThe Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has, with great historical initiative, tremendous political courage, and a strong sense of mission, united and led the entire Party, the military, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups in unshackling their thinking and breaking down the barriers erected by vested interests. We have dared to brave uncharted waters, grapple with tough problems, and navigate potential dangers and have worked resolutely to remove institutional obstacles in all areas. As a result, reform has evolved from a varietyâof trials and breakthroughs limited to certain areas into an integrated drive being advanced across the board. Foundational institutional frameworks have been basically put in place in all sectors, and historic, systemic, and holistic transformations have been achieved in many fields. Overall, we have accomplished the reform tasks set at the third plenary session of the 18th Central Committee and attained our objective of achieving marked results in making all institutions more mature and better-defined by the time of the Partyâs centennial in 2021. All this has provided strong institutional support for completing the First Centenary Goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and set China on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects.\n\nThe present and the near future constitute a critical period for our endeavor to build a great country and moveâtoward national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernization.âAs Chinese modernization has been advanced continuously through reform and opening up, it will surely embrace broader horizons through further reform and opening up. To deal with complex developments both at home and abroad, adapt to the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and live up to the new expectations of our people, it is vital that we continue to advance reform. Advancing reform is essential for upholding and improving the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernizing Chinaâs system and capacity for governance, for putting the new development philosophy into practice and better adapting to the evolution in the principal contradiction in Chinese society, and for adhering to a people-centered approach to see that the gains of modernization benefit all our people fairly. It is also crucial for responding to major risks and challenges and ensuring steady and sustained progress in the cause of the Party and the country, for promoting the development of a human community with a shared future and winning the strategic initiative amid accelerating global changes of a like not seen in a century, and for further advancing the great new project of Party building in the new era and making our Marxist party stronger. Reform and opening up are an ongoing endeavor rather than a task to be completed. All of us in the Party must consciouslyâgive more prominence to reform and further deepen reform comprehensivelyâwith a view to advancing Chinese modernization.\n\n(2) Guiding philosophy\n\nWe must stay committed to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development and fully implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We must thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinpingâs new ideas, viewpoints, and conclusions on comprehensively deepening reform and fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts. We must adhere to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability and continue to free our minds, seek truth from facts, move with the times, and take a realistic and pragmatic approach, as we work to further unleash and develop the productive forces and tap into and boost the vitality of our society. Keeping in mind both domestic and international imperatives, we will ensure coordinated implementation of the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy.âRegarding economic structural reform as the spearhead and greater social fairness and justice and increased wellbeing of the people as our ultimate objectives, we will channel greater energy into making our reforms integrated, focused, and effective. We will work to better adapt the relations of production to the productive forces, the superstructure to the economic base, and national governance to social development so as to provide strong impetusâand institutional support for Chinese modernization.\n\n(3) Overall objectives\n\nWe will continue to improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize Chinaâs system and capacity for governance. By 2035, we will have finished building a high-standard socialist market economy in all respects, further improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, generally modernized our system and capacity for governance, and basically realized socialist modernization. All of this will lay a solid foundation for building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of this century. In particular, we will focus on achieving the following objectives:\n\nâBuilding a high-standard socialist market economy. We will see that the market plays the decisive role in resource allocation and that the government better fulfills its role. We will uphold and improve Chinaâs basic socialist economic systems, achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and promote high-standard opening up. We will build a modernized economy, move faster to create a new pattern of development, and promote high-quality development.\n\nâAdvancing whole-process peopleâs democracy. We will uphold the unity between leadership by the Party, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance. We will improve the institutions through which the people run the country, promote extensive, multilevel, and institutionalized development of consultative democracy, and refine the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. We will move to a higher stage in building a socialist country under the rule of law.\n\nâDeveloping a strong socialist culture in China. We will uphold the foundational system for ensuring the guiding role of Marxism in the ideological domain and improve the institutions and mechanisms for developing cultural programs and industries. We will promote cultural prosperity, enrich the intellectual and cultural lives of our people, and enhance Chinaâs cultural soft power and the appeal of Chinese culture.\n\nâImproving the peopleâs quality of life. We will refine the income distribution, employment, and social security systems, make basic public services more balanced and accessible, and facilitate more notable, substantive progress in promoting peopleâs well-rounded development and common prosperity for all.\n\nâBuilding a Beautiful China. We will ramp up the green transition in all areas of economic and social development and improve the environmental governance system. We will prioritize ecological protection, conserve resources and use them efficiently, and pursue green and low-carbon development, with a view to promoting harmony between humanity and nature.\n\nâAdvancing the Peaceful China Initiative to a higher level. We will strengthen the national security system, enhance integration between national strategies, and improve our capacity to safeguard national security. We will create new institutions, mechanisms, and methods for social governance and buildâa newâsecurity architecture.\n\nâImproving the Partyâs capacity for leadership and long-term governance. We will develop new and improved ways of exercising leadership and governance, deepen institutional reforms related to Party building, and improve the system for exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance.\n\nThe reform tasks laid out in this resolution shall be completed by the time the Peopleâs Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029.\n\n(4) Guiding principles\n\nOn the basis of reviewing and applying the valuable experience we have gained since the launch of reform and opening up, particularly from our endeavorâto comprehensively deepen reform in the new era, we will implement the following principles:\n\nâUpholdingâthe Partyâs overall leadership. We must firmly upholdâthe Central Committeeâs authority and its centralized, unified leadership and ensure that the Party fulfills its core role of exercising overall leadership and coordinating the efforts of all sides. We mustâensureâthat Party leadership is exercisedâin every aspect and throughout the entire process of reform so that it always advances in the correct political direction.\n\nâAdhering to a people-centered approach. We must respect the principal position and pioneering spiritâof the people and make our reform measures highly responsive to the call of the people, so as to ensure that reform is for the peopleâand by the people and that its fruits are shared amongâthe people.â\n\nâUpholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground. Staying committed to socialism with Chinese characteristics, we mustâkeep pace with the times, adapt to the evolution of practice, and takeâa problem-oriented approach, so that from a new starting point, we can promote innovations in theory and practice, in our institutions and culture, and in all other aspects.\n\nâStrengthening institutional buildingâas our main task.âWe must strengthen top-level design and overall planning, always establishing new systems before abolishing old ones while attaching equal importance to efforts in both respects. We must consolidate foundational systems, refineâbasic systems, and innovateâimportant systems.\n\nâStaying committedâto law-based governance on all fronts.âWe must deepen reform and advance Chinese modernization under the rule of law and ensure unity between reform and the rule of law, seeingâthat all major reforms have a solid legal basis and that reform achievementsâare elevated to lawâin a timely manner.\n\nâApplyingâsystems thinking. We mustâproperly handle the major relationships between the economy and society, betweenâthe government and the market, between efficiency and fairness, between vitality and order, and between development and security, thusâpursuingâreform in a more systematic, holistic, and coordinated manner.\n\nII. Building a High-Standard Socialist Market Economy\n\nAâhigh-standard socialist market economy provides an important guarantee for Chinese modernization. We mustâbetter leverage theârole of the market, foster a fairer and more dynamic market environment, and make resource allocation as efficient and productive as possible. We need to lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation and strive to better maintain order in the market and remedy market failures. By doing so, we will ensure smooth flows in the national economy and unleash the internal driving forces and creativityâof the whole of society.\n\n(5) Upholding and fulfilling the commitments to the public and non-public sectors\n\nWe will stay committed to unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector and unswervingly encouraging, supporting, and guiding the development of the non-public sector. We will ensure that economic entities under all forms of ownership have equal access to factors of production in accordance with the law, compete in the market on an equal footing, and are protected by the law as equals, thus enabling them to complement each other and develop side by side.\n\nWe will deepen reform of state capital and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), improving the institutions and mechanisms for management and oversight, strengthening strategic coordinationâbetween relevantâadministrative departments, and working toârefine the layout of the state-owned sector and adjust its structure. All this will help state capital and SOEs get stronger, do better, and grow bigger,âwithâtheir core functionsâand core competitiveness enhanced.âWe will clearly define the functions of different types of SOEs, improve the management of their primary responsibilities and core business, and identify the key areas and orientationsâfor state capital investment. State capital will be steered toward major industries and key fields that are vital to national securityâand serve as the lifeblood of the national economy, toward sectors such as public services, emergency response, and public welfare, which concern our countryâs prosperityâand our peopleâs wellbeing, and toward forward-looking and strategic emerging industries. The institutional framework under which SOEs pursue original innovationâwill be improved, and the reform of state capital investment and operationâcompaniesâwill be continued. We will establish a system to assess SOEsââperformance in fulfilling their strategic missions, refine the category-based SOE evaluation system, and introduce value-added accounting in the state-owned sector. While promotingâindependent operation of natural monopoly businesses in sectorsâsuch as energy, railway, telecommunications, water conservancy, and public utilities, we willâadvanceâmarket-oriented reforms in the competitive areas of these sectorsâand improve regulatory institutionsâand mechanisms.\n\nWe will continue to implement principles and policies that help foster a favorable environmentâand create more opportunitiesâfor the development of the non-public sector. We will formulate a private sector promotion law. We will do more to remove barriers to market access, work to see that the competitive areas of infrastructure are open to market entities in a fair manner, and improve the long-term mechanismâby which private enterprises participate in major national projects. We will support capable private enterprises in leading national initiatives to make breakthroughs in major technologies and provide privateâenterprises with greater access to major national scientific researchâinfrastructure. We will refine financing support policies and systems for private enterprises to resolve the difficulties they face in accessing affordable financing. We will improve the legal framework for the long-term regulation of charges levied on enterprisesâand for clearing overdue payments owedâto them. We will move faster to set up a system for comprehensively evaluating private enterprisesâ credit status and refine the credit enhancement system for small and medium private enterprises. We will support and guide private enterprises in improving their governance structures and management systems, building up compliance capacity, and better preventing corruption-related risks. We will strengthen ongoing and ex post oversightâand regulate administrative inspections on private enterprises.\n\nWe will refine the modern corporate system with distinctive Chinese featuresâandâpromote entrepreneurial spirit. We willâsupport and guide enterprises of all types as they work to use resources and production factors more efficiently, improve their operation and management, and fulfill their social responsibilities. Efforts will be accelerated to foster a greater number of world-class enterprises.\n\n(6) Buildingâa unified national market\n\nWe will work to see that the underlying institutions and rules of the marketâare unified, that market regulation is exercised in an impartial and unified manner, and that connectivityâbetween market facilities is built to high standards. We will enhanceâthe binding force of fair competition review, take stronger action against monopolies and unfair competition, and reviewâand abolish regulations and practices that impede the development of a unified national market and fair competition. We will bring local regulations and institutions for attractingâinvestmentâunder regulation andâstrictly prohibitâpolicy incentivesâin breach of laws andâregulations. We will establishâsound, unified, and well-regulated public resourceâtrading platforms that facilitate information sharing. Such platforms will cover public bidding as well asâprocurementâby the government, public institutions, and SOEs and ensure full transparency throughout theâproject managementâprocess.âOverall market regulation capabilitiesâwill be enhanced. We will refine the nationalâsystem of standards and deepen reform of local systems for standards management.\n\nThe institutions and rules for productionâfactor markets will be improved to facilitate the smooth flow of production factors, the efficientâallocation of all types of resources, and the full realization of market potential. We will develop a unified market for urban and ruralâland designated for construction. We will refine the underlying systems for promoting well-regulated development of the capital market and foster an integrated national market for technology and data. By refining the mechanisms whereby productionâfactors are priced primarily based on market supplyâand demand, we will prevent improper government interference in pricing. We will also develop better mechanisms to ensure the contributions of productionâfactors, such asâlabor, capital, land, knowledge, technology, management, and data, are determined by the market and rewarded accordingly. Pricing reforms will be continued in sectors such as water, energy, and transportation, and the tiered pricing mechanisms for household water, electricity, and natural gas consumptionâwill be improved, as will the pricing mechanism for refined petroleum products.\n\nWe will improve the commodity distribution system, speed up the development of the Internet of Things, and further refine the integrated framework of distributionârules and standards to cut logisticsâcostsâthroughout society. We will deepen reform of the energy management system, build a unified national electricity market, and improve the operation and coordination mechanismsâfor oil and gas pipelines.\n\nWe will step up efforts to develop a complete domestic demand system. To this end, we will set up long-term government investment mechanisms to support the development of major projects that are of fundamentalâand far-reaching importance and serve the public interest; refine the institutions and mechanisms that enable governmentâinvestment to effectively drive nongovernmental investment; further reform the investment review and approval system; improve the mechanisms for stimulating and facilitating nongovernmental investment; and create aâmarket-drivenâmechanism for ensuring self-sustaining growthâof effective investment.âWe will refine long-term mechanisms for expanding consumption, reduce relevantârestrictions, boost public spending as necessary, and actively promote the debut economy.\n\n(7) Refiningâthe systems underpinning the market economy\n\nWe will improve the property rights system to ensureâlaw-based, equitable protection of the property rights of economic entities under all forms of ownershipâon a long-term basis and establish an efficient system for the comprehensive management of intellectual property rights. We will refine the market information disclosure system and put in place a commercial secrets protection system. All economic entities,âregardless of their form of ownership, will be treated as equals when their property rights and legal interests are infringed upon or they infringe upon the property rights and legal interests of others. We will also refine the punitive compensationâsystem. We will work to bolster law enforcementâand justice administration to protect property rights, prevent and rectify administrativeâand criminal interference in economic disputes, and refine the mechanisms for identifying and redressing wrongly adjudicated casesâinvolvingâenterprises in accordance with the law.\n\nWe will refine the market accessâsystem to ensure greater accessibility for new forms of business and new sectors. We will deepen reform of the business registration system based onâsubscribed registered capitalâand ensure that subscriptions are paid on time as stipulated by law. We will refine the enterprise bankruptcyâmechanism, explore the establishmentâof a bankruptcyâsystem for individual persons, move ahead with integrated reforms concerning the deregistrationâof enterprises, and improve the market exit system. We will also improve the social credit systemâand related oversight institutions.\n\nIII. Promoting High-Quality Economic Development\n\nHigh-quality development is our primary task in building China into a modern socialist country in all respects. It is essential that we apply the new development philosophy to steer reformâandâground ourâefforts in the new stage of development. We mustâdeepen supply-side structural reform, improve incentive and constraint mechanismsâfor promoting high-quality development, and strive to create new growth drivers and strengths.\n\n(8)âImproving the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions\n\nWe will work to facilitate revolutionary breakthroughs in technology, innovative allocation of productionâfactors, in-depth industrial transformation and upgrading, andâthe optimal combinationâof laborers, means of labor, and subjects of labor as well as their renewal and upgrading. All this will give rise to new industries, newâbusiness models,âandânewâgrowth drivers and promote the developmentâofâproductive forcesâthat are characterized by high technology, high performance, and high quality. A stronger push will be made to pursue innovation in key generic technologies, cutting-edge technologies, modern engineering technologies, and disruptive technologies, and institutional supplyâwill be boosted in new areas and arenas. We will establish aâmechanism for ensuring fundingâincreases for industriesâof the future, improve the policy and governance systems for promoting the development of strategic industries such as next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, aviation and aerospace, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, biomedicine, and quantum technology, and steer emerging industries toward sound and orderlyâdevelopment. National standards will be elevated to guide the upgrading of traditional industries, and enterprises will also be encouraged to apply digital, intelligent, and green technologies to transform and upgrade these sectors. We will impose tighter institutional constraints for environmental protectionâand safety.\n\nRelevant rules and policies will be improved to accelerate theâformation of relations of productionâthat are more compatible with new quality productive forces, and to channel various types of advanced production factors toward the development of new quality productive forces. These steps will help realize a significant increase in total factor productivity. We will encourageâand regulate the development of angel investment, venture capital, and private equity investment, better leverage the role of government investmentâfunds, and work to promoteâthe development of patient capital.\n\n(9) Improving the systems for promoting full integration between the real economy and the digital economy\n\nWe will move faster to advanceânew industrialization, promote the growthâand expansion of advanced manufacturing clusters, and make the manufacturingâsectorâhigher-end, smarter, and more eco-friendly. We will set up a number ofâindustrial generic technology platforms, accelerate the transformation of industrial models and organizational forms of enterprises, and refine the institutions and mechanisms for enhancing our leading position in industries where we excel. We will establish better operationâand oversight mechanismsâforâmajor industrial investment fundsâto ensure that capital is channeled toward our countryâs strategic needs. We will put in place a funding mechanism to see that the share of manufacturing in the national economy remains at a desirable level. We will also realize a reasonableâreduction in overall costsâand tax and feeâburdensâin the manufacturing sector.\n\nWe will move faster to establish institutions and mechanisms for promoting the development of the digital economyâand refine the policy system for developingâthe digital industryâandâtransformingâtraditional industries with digital technologies. We will promote faster application of next-generation information technologyâat all stages and in all dimensions, developâthe Industrial Internet, and build digital industry clustersâwith international competitiveness.âWe will push forward the innovativeâdevelopment of the platformâeconomyâwhile improving the system for its routine regulation. We will build and put into operation national data infrastructure to promote data sharing. We will work faster to set up a system for data property rightsâconcerningâownership determination, market transaction, proceeds distribution, and interests protection. We willâboost our governance and regulatory capabilitiesâin relation to data securityâand put in place a mechanism to ensure efficient, convenient, and safeâcross-border data flows.\n\n(10) Refining the institutions and mechanisms for developing the service sector\n\nWe will refine the policy system for supporting the development of the service sector, improve financial accounting, and promote standardization in this sector. With a focus on key links, we will propel high-quality development of producer services on a sector-by-sector basis, invigorate industrial internetâplatforms, remove administrative barriersâthat impede trans-regional business operations, and promote the integrated development of producer services. The mechanisms for accelerating the diversified development of consumer services will be improved. We will refine the system of rules and regulations for intermediary serviceâagenciesâto ensureâthat they operate in an honest and trustworthy way and fulfill their responsibilities in accordanceâwith the law.\n\n(11) Improving the institutions and mechanisms forâmodernizingâinfrastructure\n\nWe will build a planning and standards system for new types of infrastructure and improve the mechanisms for integrated utilization of such infrastructure. We will advance the digitalization of traditional infrastructure, diversify investment and financing channels, and refine the coordination mechanisms for major infrastructure construction projects. We will further reform the integrated transportation system, advancing reform of the railway system, developing general aviation and the low-altitude economy, and optimizing the policy on toll highways. We will raise the underwriting capacity of shipping insurers, help them provide better global services, and introduce new systems and rules on the arbitrationâof marine affairs. We will improve the mechanisms for the construction, operation, and management of major water conservancyâprojects.\n\n(12) Improving the systems for enhancing the resilience and security of industrial and supplyâchains\n\nWe will move faster to build industrial and supply chains that are self-supporting and risk-controllable, improve the institutions and mechanisms for bolstering key industrial chains such as integrated circuits, industrial machine tools, medical equipment, instruments, basic software,âindustrial software, and advanced materials, and strive to secure more technological breakthroughs that can be applied across entire industrial and supply chains. A mechanism will be put in place to assess and respond to industrial andâsupply chain risks. We will improve the coordination mechanism for industries to be relocated domestically in a progressiveâandâorderly manner and promote interest sharing between regions of origin and destination. We will develop Chinaâs strategic hinterlandâand ensureâbackup plans for key industries. Accelerated moves will be made to improve the system for national reserves. We will refine the overall planning and linkage systems for the exploration,âproduction, supply,âstorage, and sale ofâstrategic mineral resources.\n\nIV. Supporting All-Around Innovation\n\nEducation, science and technology, and talent function as basic and strategic underpinnings for Chinese modernization. We must fully implement the strategy ofâinvigorating China through science and education, the strategy of developing a quality workforce, and the innovation-driven development strategy, make coordinated efforts to promote integrated reformâof institutions and mechanisms pertaining to education, science and technology, and talent, and improve the new system for mobilizing resources nationwide, so as to boost the overall performance of our countryâs innovation system.\n\n(13) Deepening comprehensive reform in education\n\nWe willâwork faster to build a high-quality education systemâand advance coordinatedâreforms in student training methods, school operation models, managementâsystems,âand support mechanisms. We will improve the mechanisms forâfostering virtue through education, introduce integrated reforms and new approaches in the political education curriculum at all levels, from elementary school to university, and refine the systems for nurturing capable young people with sound moral grounding, intellectual ability, physical vigor, aesthetic sensibility, and work skills. We will increase the ability of teachers to impart knowledge and bring out the best in studentsâand improveâthe long-term mechanisms for enhancing theirâprofessional integrityâandâconduct. In addition, we will further educational assessment reforms. We will improve the layout of higher education and work faster to develop world-class universities and strong disciplines with Chinese features. We will advance reforms of higher education institutionsâon a categorized basisâand develop discipline adjustment mechanisms and talent training models to meet the needs of Chinaâs scientific and technological development and national strategies. This will see us making extraordinary moves to plan for disciplinesâand majors that are in urgent demand. We will also redouble efforts to develop basic disciplines, emerging disciplines, and interdisciplinary subjectsâand work harder to cultivate top talent, with a strong emphasisâon fostering innovative capacity. We will refine the mechanismsâfor facilitating scientific and technological innovation in universities and ensureâmore efficient application of advances. Scientific and technologicalâeducation and humanitiesâeducation will be better coordinated. Weâwill work faster to build a vocationalâeducationâsystemâthat is well-integratedâwith both general education and industryâand improve the mechanisms for studentâinternships and work experience. We will better guide and regulate the development of private schools.âWe will promote high-standard opening upâin the education sector, and encourage first-rate foreign universities of science andâengineeringâto develop partner schools and programs in China.â\n\nWith a view to optimizing the allocation ofâeducational resourcesâacross regions, we will establish mechanisms for aligning the supply of basicâpublic education servicesâwith demographic changes. We will improve the mechanisms for promoting high-quality, balanced development of compulsory educationâand explore avenues for gradually expanding the coverage of free education. The support mechanismsâforâpreschool education, special needs education, and specialized educationâwill be improved. We will also pursue the digitalization of educationâto facilitate theâbuilding of a learning societyâand provide greater support for lifelongâeducation.\n\n(14) Deepeningâscientificâand technological structuralâreform\n\nTargetingâthe global frontiers of science and technology, the development of the economy, the major needs of the country, and the health and safety of our people, weâwill refine the mechanisms under which major scientiï¬c and technological innovationâprojects are organized in order to mount a concerted push for breakthroughs in core technologies in keyâfields. Weâwill see that the development of innovative capabilities, allocationâof innovation factors, and ranks of innovators become more systematic, well-organized, and coordinated. To boost Chinaâs strength in strategic science and technology,âwe will refine the system of national laboratoriesâand better define the roles and layout of our national research institutions, advanced-levelâresearch universities, and leading high-tech enterprises.âWe will promoteâcloser collaboration between the central and local levels, work for coordinated developmentâof technological innovationâplatforms of various kinds, and encourage and regulate the development of new types of R&D institutions. Giving play to the guiding role of Chinaâs enormous market, we will see that innovation resources are more effectively allocated and that our innovative capabilities are better organized, with a view to promoting integrated advancements in technological and industrial innovation.âWe will establish risk monitoring,âearly warning, and responseâsystemsâto safeguard science and technology security, and ensure self-sufficiency in scientific and technological infrastructure. The management system for science and technology-related socialâgroups will be refined.âWe will expand international science and technology exchanges and cooperation, encourageâthe establishment of international science and technology organizationsâin China, andâimprove the management mechanisms whereby Chinaâs universities, research institutes, and science and technology-related socialâgroups engage in specialized exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts.\n\nWe will improve the management of science and technology plansâto ensureâthat they are forward-lookingâand play a guiding role in basic research, interdisciplinary frontier areas, and key fields. We will see that basic researchâis conducted in a better organized way, raise the share of total science and technologyâexpenditureâthat goes toward basic research, and improve the basic research investment mechanisms to ensure support on both a competitive and ongoing basis. Regions, enterprises, social organizations, and individualsâwith the resources to support basic researchâwill be encouraged to do so. We will also support researchers in diversifying their subjects for study and encourage high-risk, high-reward basic research. We will advance reform of the science and technology evaluation system, ensure that ethical standardsâare adhered to, and rectify academic misconduct.\n\nReinforcing the principal role of enterprises in innovation,âwe will establish mechanisms for fostering leading high-tech enterprisesâandâstrengthen enterprise-led collaboration between industries, universities, and research institutes. We will set upâa reserve fund system for corporate R&Dâand back enterprisesâthat volunteerâto leadâor participate in major national science andâtechnologyâprograms.âMechanisms will be rolled out to promote the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that use specialized and sophisticated technologies to produce novel and unique products. To encourage sci-tech SMEs to boost their R&D spending, we will raise the rate of additional tax deductions for their R&D expenses.âWe will encourage and guide higher education institutions and research institutesâin authorizing the use of their proprietary scientific and technological advancesâby micro,âsmall, and medium enterprisesâon a âuse first, pay laterââbasis.\n\nWe will refine the mechanisms for allocation, management, and utilizationâof central government research fundsâand improve the institutionsâfor the implementation ofâcentral government-funded science andâtechnology programs and their management by specialized agencies.âWe will expand application of the contract systemâfor government-funded research projects andâgrant scientists a greater say inâdeciding on technologyâroadmaps, spending funds, and allocating resources.âWe will establish a mechanism for adopting non-consensus projectsâbased on real-name recommendations by experts. Public institutionsâengaged in scientific research will be allowed to implement a more flexible management system as compared to general public institutions, so that they can explore approachesâto instituting corporateâmanagement.\n\nWe will further reform the mechanisms for applying scientific and technological advances. We will enhance the national technologyâtransfer system, move faster to planâand build a number ofâproof-of-concept andâpilot-scale testing platforms, refine the policies for the initial application ofânewly-developed equipment, materials, and software, andâincreaseâgovernment procurement of independently innovatedâproducts. The pool of technology managersâwill be expanded.â\n\nScientists and engineers will haveâa greater sayâin the distribution of gains fromâthe transfer of their scientific and technological advances. We will establish a system to place scientific and technological outputs produced on theâjob under separate managementâandâdeepen reforms to grant researchers corresponding rights over theseâoutputs. We will push ahead with the income distribution reform for universities and research institutes. A greater number of eligible SOEs will be permitted to provide diverseâmedium- and long-term incentives to encourage innovation and creativity among their research personnel.\n\nWe will develop a financial system for scientiï¬c and technological innovationâto provide greater support for major national science andâtechnology programs andâsci-tech SMEs. We will refine policies for supporting the investment of long-term capitalâinâprojects at the earlyâstages, in small enterprises, over long time horizons, and in advancedâand core technologies. We will improve the mechanismsâfor spreading the risks associatedâwith the developmentâof major technologiesâand introduce a policy system for technologyâinsurance. We will facilitate foreign equity investmentâand venture capital investment in China.\n\n(15) Deepening institutional reforms for talent development\n\nOur policies on talent will become more proactive, open, and effective. To improve the mechanisms for nurturing talent here at home, we will work faster to develop national hubs for high-caliber personnel and platforms for attracting and pooling talent. We will step up efforts to build a contingent of personnel with expertise of strategic importance, with a focus on cultivating science strategists, top-notch scientists and innovation teams, outstanding engineers, master craftsmen, and highly-skilled workers, while also working to improve the performance of all types of talent. We will develop a first-rate industrial technical workforce. We will improve the mechanisms for enabling orderly flows of talent to promote a more rational distribution across regions and foster closer personnel collaborationâbetween the eastern, central, and western regions. We will also enhance theâmechanisms for identifying, selecting, and training young innovators and ensure better pay and benefits for our young scientists and engineers. Relevant systems will be refined to ensure that researchers can concentrate on research.\n\nWe will enhance the incentive mechanisms for talent, granting more say to employers and creating a more accommodating environment for talent development. We will put in place a personnel assessment system based on innovation-related capability, performance, outcomes, and contributions. We will open up channels to enable flows of personnel between universities and research institutes on the one hand and enterprises on the other. We will improve the support mechanisms for recruiting talent from overseas and create internationally competitive personnel systems. We will also explore avenues for establishing an immigration system for highly-skilled personnel.\n\nV. Improving Macroeconomic Governance\n\nSound macro regulation, along with effective governance by the government, is essential for ensuring that we can fully leverage the institutional strengths of our socialist market economy. It is, therefore, vital that we improve our macro regulation systems. We must pursue coordinated reforms in the fiscal, tax, financial, and other major sectors and work to enhance the consistency of macro policy orientation.\n\n(16) Improving the national strategic planning system and policy coordination mechanisms\n\nWe will develop mechanisms for formulating and executing nationalâstrategies and make a stronger push to fully integrate all major strategies, so that they can provide better macro guidance and overall coordination. The systems for national economic and social development planning will be improved. This will see us enhancing the mechanisms for the alignment and implementation of plans, better harnessing the strategic guiding roleâof national development plans, bolstering the basic role of territorial space plans, and reinforcing the supporting roleâof subject-specific plans and regional plans. We will also improve the system by which experts participate in decision-making on public issues.\n\nTo promote the implementation of national development plans and major strategies, we will foster greater synergy between our fiscal, monetary, industrial, pricing, and employment policies, improving the allocation of newly acquired resources and adjusting the mix of existing resources. We will explore the introduction of national macro balance sheet management. Both economic and non-economic policies will be evaluated to ensure that they are consistent with the macro policy orientation. The expectations management mechanism will be improved. We will refine the statistical indicators accounting system to better support high-quality development, expanding the coverage of statistics to include more new forms of economy and new sectors. We will promote the development of statistical infrastructure for industrial entities, optimize statistical methods for both headquarters and branches, and gradually work toward compiling statistics based on the places where market entities conduct their business activities. Steps will be taken to improve the mechanisms for international coordinationâon macro policies.\n\n(17) Deepening reform of the fiscal and tax systems\n\nWe will further improve the budget system and strengthen unified management of all fiscal resources and budgets. All revenues generatedâon the basis of the exercise of administrative power, government credit, and state-owned resources and assets will be placed under government budget management. We will improve the budgetingâand performance assessment systems for state capital operations and strengthen fiscal support for major national strategic tasks and basic public wellbeing. We will enhance macro guidance on budgeting and fiscal policies. We will strengthen performance management for public services, withâa focus on conducting ex anteâevaluations of their functions. Reforms for zero-based budgeting will be advanced. We will unify budget allocation powers, make budget management more unified and standardized, and take steps to boost budget transparency and enhance budget oversight. We will improve the system for comprehensive governmentâfinancial reporting based on accrual accounting.\n\nThe tax structure will be improvedâto make taxation systemsâmore conducive to high-quality development, social fairness, and the building of a unified market. We will also look into approaches for better adapting these systems to new forms of business. Fully implementing the principle of legality of taxation, we will regulate policies on tax breaks and improve the support mechanisms for key sectors and links. We will refine the system of direct taxes, improve the personal income tax system which is based on both adjusted gross income and specificâincome types, regulate taxation policies on incomes generated from business operations, capital, and property, and unify tax rates for incomes earned through work. Reform of the tax collection and administration system will be deepened.\n\nWe will establish a fiscal relationship between the central and local governments that features well-defined powers and responsibilities and the appropriateâallocation of resources, with an optimumâbalance between regions. To place more fiscal resources at the disposalâof localâgovernments, we will expand the sources of tax revenue at the local level and grant greater authority for tax management to local governments as appropriate. To improve the system of transferâpayments, we will overhaul special transfer payments and increase the scaleâof general transfer payments. These will help ensure that the fiscal resources of prefecture- and county-level governments are commensurateâwith their powers. We will establish incentive and constraint mechanisms through transfer payments to promote high-quality development. We will take steps to move excise tax collection further down the production-to-consumption chain, with the power of collection steadily being passed to local governments. We will improve the value-added tax credit refund policy and free up the channels for making tax deductions. The ratio for taxes shared between the central and local governments will be optimized. We will look into rolling the urban maintenance and construction tax, education surcharges, and local education surcharges into one single local surtax. Local governments will have the authorityâto set the rate for this tax within a predetermined range. We will appropriatelyâexpand the scope of use for funds raised from the sale ofâlocal government special-purpose bonds, permitting a greater share of such funds to be used as capital in more sectors and on a larger scale. The systems for managing government debt will be improved. We will establishâa system for monitoring and regulating all local government debt as well as long-term mechanisms for preventing and defusing hidden debt risks. We will move faster to reform and transform local government financing platforms. In regulating the managementâof non-tax revenue, we will delegate, as appropriate, some management authority to local governments and allow them to tailor theirâpractices to local conditions.\n\nThe central government will hold more fiscal powers as appropriateâand raise the proportion of central government expenditure accordingly. In principle, the expenditures commensurateâwith such powers should be allocated from the central government, and such powers to be delegated to local governments should be reduced. No requirements for supporting funds from local governments in violation of regulations shall be made. When it is necessary to delegate fiscal powers to local governments, the relevant funds should be arranged through special transfer payments.\n\n(18) Deepening reform of the financial system\n\nWe will move faster to improve the central bank system and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We will actively develop technology finance, green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance, and digital financeâand work to ensure quality financial services for major strategies, key fields, and weak links. We will refine the role and governance of financial institutions and the incentive and constraint mechanisms for ensuring that they serve the real economy. We will diversify equity financing, step up the development of multilevel bond markets, and increase the proportion of direct financing. We will optimize the state-owned financial capital management system.\n\nWe will improveâthe functions of the capital marketâto give balanced weight to investment and financing. We will prevent risks and tighten regulation to promote the sound and stable developmentâof the capital market. We will facilitate the entry of long-term capital into the market. We will improve the overall quality of listed companies, strengthen relevant regulation and delisting systems, and establish long-term mechanisms to enhance the underlying stability of the capital market. We will improve the mechanisms for regulating and constraining the behaviors of major shareholders and actualâcontrollers. We will optimize dividend incentive and constraint mechanisms for listed companies and improve the mechanisms for protecting investors. We will encourage regional equity markets to align their rules and implement unified standards.\n\nA financial lawâwill beâformulated. We will improve the financial regulatory systemâto ensure that all financial activities are placed under regulation in accordance with the law, strengthen regulatory responsibility and accountabilityâsystems, and improve regulatoryâcoordination between the central and local levels. We will build secure and efficient financial infrastructure, unify the rules and systems for registration, custody, settlement, and liquidation for the financial market, establish binding constraints for defusing risks at an early stage, and build a robust system to effectively fend off and control systemic risks and ensureâfinancial stability. We will improve the mechanisms for protecting financial consumers and crackingâdown on illegal financial activitiesâand establishâa firewall for industrial and financial capital. We will promote high-standard opening up of the financial sector, steadily and prudently advance the internationalization of the RMB, and develop offshore RMB markets. We will make steady progress in the R&D and application of digital RMB and move faster to build Shanghai into an international financial center.\n\nWe will improve the management model based on pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative listâand support qualifiedâforeign capital institutions in participating in our financial service trials. We will expand the connectivity betweenâdomestic and overseas financial markets in a steady and prudent way and improve the qualified foreign institutional investor system. We will push forward the development of a homegrown, controllable cross-border payment system and strengthen financial security mechanisms as we open our doors wider to the outside world. We will establish aâsystem for the unified monitoring and oversight of all foreignâdebt. We will actively participate in international financial governance.\n\n(19) Improving mechanisms for implementing the coordinated regional development strategy\n\nWe will develop a regional economic layout and a territorial space system characterized by complementarity between different regions and territorial spaces.âWe will improve the institutional and policy frameworks for opening up a new vistaâin the large-scale development of the western region, achievingânew breakthroughs in the full revitalization of the Northeast, acceleratingâthe rise of the central region, and encouragingâthe eastern region to modernize more quickly. We will enable regions like the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,âthe Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Areaâto better play their roles as engines of high-quality development and improve the mechanisms for the development of the Yangtze Economic Beltâand the ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River basin. We will move forward with the high-standard and high-quality development of the Xiongâan New Area. We will push for solidâprogress in developingâthe Chengdu-Chongqing economic zone. We will improve the system of institutions for functional zoningâand strengthen mechanisms to support optimal development of territorial spaces. We will improve integrated regional development mechanisms, build new mechanisms for cooperative development across administrative divisions, and deepen industrial collaboration between the eastern, central, and western regions. The institutions and mechanisms for promoting the development of the marine economy will be enhanced.\n\nVI. Promoting Integrated Urban-Rural Development\n\nIntegrated urbanâand rural developmentâis essential to Chinese modernization. We must pursue coordinated progress in new industrialization, new urbanization, and all-around rural revitalization, facilitateâgreater urban-rural integration in planning, development, and governance across the board, and promote equal exchanges and two-way flows of production factors between urban and rural areas, so as to narrow the disparities between theâtwo and promote their shared prosperity and development.\n\n(20) Improving the institutions and mechanisms for advancingânew urbanization\n\nWe will put in place mechanisms to foster positive interactionsâbetween the processes of industrial upgrading, population concentration, and urban development. We will implement the systems for allowingâpeople to obtainâhousehold registration and access basic public services in their place of permanent residence. We will push to see that eligibleâpeople who have movedâto cities from rural areasâenjoy the same rights as registered local residents with regard to social insurance, housing support, and access to compulsory education for their children living with them. The process of grantingâpermanent urban residency to these people will also be accelerated. We will protectâthe lawful land rights and interests of former rural residents who now hold permanent urban residency, protect, in accordance with the law,âtheir rights to contract rural land, to use their rural residential land, and to share in the proceeds from rural collective undertakings, and explore avenues to facilitate voluntary, paid transfers of these rights.\n\nWe will continue to follow the principle that cities shouldâbe built by the people and for the people. We will improve urban planning to see that cities of different sizes and small towns develop in coordination with each other to form efficientâand closely knitâlayouts. We will deepen reform of the urban development, operation, and governance systems and step up efforts to change the development models of cities. We will work to create new systems for smart and efficient governance in super-large and mega citiesâand establish institutions and mechanisms for the highly-integrated development of citiesâin metropolitan areas. We will deepen reforms to grant super-large towns economic and social management rights that are commensurate with their populations and economic sizes. We will develop sustainable urban renewalâmodels, along with relevant policies and regulations, and strengthen the building of underground utility tunnelsâand the upgrading of old pipelines. These efforts will help make our cities safer and more resilient.\n\n(21) Consolidating and improving the basic rural operation system\n\nWe will move forward with well-organized trials to extend rural landâcontracts byâanother 30 years upon the expirationâof the second-round contracts, deepen the reform to separate the ownership rights, contract rights, and management rightsâof contracted land, and develop appropriately scaled agricultural operations. We will improve the framework for agricultural operations and refine the pricing mechanism for the transfer of contracted land management rights. We will encourage farmers to engage in cooperative operations and see that our policies for supporting new types of agribusinessâserve to increase rural incomes. We will develop a system of convenientâand efficientâcommercial agricultural services. We will develop new types of rural collective economies, establish related operating mechanisms featuring clearly defined property rights and rational income distribution, and ensure that farmers enjoy moreâadequate property rightsâand interests.\n\n(22) Improving supporting systems to strengthenâagriculture, benefit farmers, and enrichârural areas\n\nContinuing to prioritize agricultural and rural development, we will improve the investment mechanisms for rural revitalization. We will work to expand county industries that benefit local people, buildâa diversified food supply system, and foster new industries and new forms of businessâin rural areas. We will optimize the system of agricultural subsidy policiesâand develop multi-tiered agricultural insurance schemes. We will refine the regular mechanisms for preventing rural residents from lapsing or relapsing into poverty and establish a system of multi-tiered and categorized support for low-income rural residents and underdeveloped areas. We will improve the long-term mechanisms for managing assets formed with government inputs in the process of poverty alleviation.âApplyingâthe experience gained from the Green Rural Revival Program in Zhejiang Province, we will refine the long-term mechanisms for promoting all-around rural revitalization.\n\nWe will work faster to improve the mechanisms for ensuring the incomes of grain growersâand see that the prices of grain and other major agricultural productsâremain at a reasonable level. We will coordinate efforts to establish an inter-provincial mechanism for major grain-purchasing areas to compensate major grain-producing areasâso as to make substantiveâheadway in incentivizingâthe latter. We will make coordinated progress in reforming the institutions and mechanisms related to the purchase and sale of grain and the management of grain reserves and develop new regulatory models in this regard. The long-term mechanisms for conserving grain and other types of food will be improved.\n\n(23) Deepening reform of the land system\n\nWe will reform and refine the system for offsetting cultivated land that has been put to other uses, manage all types of arable landâoccupation in a unified manner, and improve the acceptance inspectionâmechanism to make sure that newly-added arable landâis of an equivalent quantity and quality. We will improve the mechanisms for developing, verifying, managing, and protecting high-standard cropland. We will refineâthe managementâsystem for ensuring that arable land is used for planting basic crops. We will allow rural households to put houses under their legal ownership to good use by leasing them out, contributing them in the form of shares, and engaging in cooperative ventures. We will promote orderly reforms for market-based transfers of rural collective land designated for business construction and improve the mechanisms for distributingâreturns realized from the appreciation of land.\n\nWe will optimize land management, refining relevant systems so that they are efficiently aligned with macro policies and regional development needs. We will give priority to the reasonable land needs of leading industries and major projects, with a view to creating greater development space for regions with competitiveâedge. We will establish a coordination mechanism to link increases in urban constructionâland quotas for cities with the growth of their permanent residents. We will explore mechanisms for using contiguous land that has been reclaimed and upgraded by the governmentâto offset arable land being used byâspecific projects and regions. We will optimize land use for urban industry and commerceâand accelerate the development of the secondary marketâfor construction land. We will promote mixed land development and use and allow for changes in land use purposes when appropriate, ensuring that idle and inefficientlyâused land can be put to better use. Targeted steps will be taken to address land use problems in various types of industrial parks. Policies will be formulated for extending land use rights for industrial and commercial purposes and for renewing them upon expiration.\n\nVII. Pursuing High-Standard Opening Up\n\nOpening up is a defining feature of Chinese modernization. We must remain committed to the basic state policy of opening to the outside worldâand continue to promote reform through opening up. Leveragingâthe strengths of Chinaâs enormousâmarket, we will enhance our capacity for opening up while expanding international cooperation and develop new institutionsâfor a higher-standard open economy.\n\n(24) Steadily expanding institutional opening up\n\nWe will promote alignment with high-standard international economic and trade rulesâand harmonize rules, regulations, management, and standards relating to property rights protection, industrialâsubsidies, environmental standards, labor protection, government procurement, e-commerce, the financial sector, and other areas, in an effort to create an institutional environment that is transparent, stable, and predictable. We will seize the initiative by opening Chinaâs commodity, services, capital, and labor markets wider to the outside world in an orderly manner and unilaterallyâopening our doors wider to the worldâs least developed countries. We will further reform institutions and mechanisms for foreign aid to realize full-chain management.\n\nWe will safeguard the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, actively participate in the reform of global economic governance, and provide more global public goods. We will expand our globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas, establish compliance mechanisms that are aligned with prevailing international rules, and optimize the environment for opening up and cooperation.\n\n(25) Deepening the foreign trade structuralâreform\n\nWe will better coordinate trade policies with fiscal, tax, financial, and industrial policies, create a set of systems and policies to support efforts to build China into a strong trading nation, step up reforms to integrate domestic and foreign trade, and actively respond to the trends of digital and green trade. We will develop new regulatory approaches for customs clearance, taxation, and foreign exchange and foster an institutional environment that is conducive to the development of new models and formsâof trade. We will develop digital trade in an innovative manner and promote the development of integrated pilot zonesâfor cross-border e-commerce. We will build commodity trading centers and global distribution centers, support various types of entities in developing logistics facilities overseas in a well-ordered way, and facilitate theâdevelopment of international logistics hubs, as well as hubs for the distribution of commodities and resources, in areas where conditions allow. The mechanisms for preventing and controlling trade risks will be improved, and our export control framework and trade remedyâsystem will be refined.\n\nWe will adopt innovative measures to boost trade in services and fullyâapply the negative list for cross-border trade in services. We will promote comprehensive trials and demonstrations for expanding opening up of the service sectorâand encourage specialized service organizations to enhance their capacity for providing international services. We will work faster to promote offshore trade and develop new types of transactions in offshore international trade. We will set up sound systems for cross-border financial services and diversify the supply of financial products and services.\n\n(26) Further reforming the management systems for inward and outward investment\n\nWe will foster a first-rateâbusiness environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalizedâand protect the rights and interests of foreign investors in accordance with the law. We will expand the catalog of encouraged industries for foreign investment,âappropriately shortenâthe negative list for foreign investment, remove all market access restrictions in theâmanufacturingâsector, and promote wider opening with regard to telecommunications, the internet, education, culture, medical services, and other sectors in a well-conceived way. We will further reform the institutions and mechanisms for promoting foreign investment, ensure national treatment for foreign-funded enterprises in terms of access to factors of production, license application, standards setting, and government procurement, and support them in collaborating with upstreamâand downstreamâenterprises in industrial chains. We will improve relevant measures to make it more convenient for people from outside the mainland to live, receive medical services, and make payments on the mainland. We will refine the institutions and mechanisms for promoting and protecting Chinese investment abroad, improve the management and service systems for outward investment, and facilitate international cooperation in industrial and supply chains.\n\n(27) Optimizing the layout for regional opening up\n\nWe will consolidate the leading role of eastern coastal areas in our opening up endeavors,âpromote further openingâup in the central, western, and northeastern regions, and move faster toward all-around opening up through links running eastward and westward, across land,âand over sea.âTo leverage the strengths of areas along the coasts, borders, rivers, and major transportation routes, we will optimize the division of functions for opening up among different regions in order to develop a diverse array of pacesetters for opening up. We will implement the strategy for upgradingâpilot free trade zonesâand encourage these zones to engage in pioneering and integrated explorations. The development of the Hainan Free Trade Portâwill be accelerated.\n\nHarnessing the institutional strengths of theâOne Country, Two Systems policy, we will work to consolidate and enhance Hong Kongâs status as an international financial, shipping, and trade center, support Hong Kong and Macao in building themselves into international hubs for high-caliber talent, and improve relevant mechanisms to see the two regions playing a greater role in Chinaâs opening to the outside world. We will encourage cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao in the Greater Bay Area by promotingâcloser alignment of rules and mechanisms. We will improve relevant institutions and policies to promote economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-Strait development.\n\n(28) Improving the mechanisms for high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative\n\nWe will continue to implement the Belt and Road Science, Technology, and Innovation Cooperation Action Plan and redouble efforts to develop multilateral platforms for cooperation in green development, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, energy, taxation, finance, disaster mitigation, and other areas. We will work to improve the integrated framework for land, sea, air, and cyberspaceâconnectivityâand build a multidimensionalânetwork to connect countries along the Belt and Road. We will make coordinated efforts to advance both major signatureâprojects and âsmall but beautifulââpublic welfare projects.\n\nVIII. Advancing Whole-Process Peopleâs Democracy\n\nDeveloping whole-process peopleâs democracyâis integral to Chinese modernization. We must firmly stay on the path of socialistâpolitical advancement with Chinese characteristics and uphold and improve our countryâs foundational, basic, and important political systems. We will develop diverse forms of democracy at all levels and ensure that the principle of the people running the country is manifested in concrete and visible ways in all aspects of Chinaâs politicalâand social activities.\n\n(29) Strengthening the institutions through which the people run the country\n\nWe must uphold, improve, and implementâthe system of peopleâs congressesâto good effect. We will improve the systemsâunder which the peopleâs congresses conduct oversight of the administrative, supervisory, adjudicatory, and procuratorial organs, refine the Law on the Oversight by the Standing Committees of Peopleâs Congressesâat All Levels and the mechanisms for its implementation, and strengthenâthe examination and oversight of government budgets and final accountsâby peopleâs congresses as well as their oversight of state-owned asset and government debt management. We will improve the rules of procedure for peopleâs congresses and their debate, assessment, discussion, and hearing systems. We will see that deputies to peopleâs congresses reach out to the public on a greater variety of issues and in more diverseâwaysâand enhance the working mechanisms for drawing on public opinion and pooling the wisdom of the people. Theâroles of peopleâs organizations,âsuch as trade unions, Chinese Communist Youth League organizations, and womenâs federations, will be brought into play in connecting with and serving the people.\n\n(30) Improving the mechanisms for consultative democracy\n\nWe will give play to the role of the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as a specialized consultative body. We will refine the mechanisms that enable in-depth consultations and interactions, the full expression of opinions, and the formation of broad consensus. We will strengthen the mechanisms through which theâCPPCC reports on social conditions and public opinions, stays in contact with theâpeople, and provides them with services. Moves will also be made to refine the mechanisms that facilitate democratic oversight by theâCPPCC.\n\nThe system of consultative democracy will be improved, with the introduction of more diverse forms of consultation. We will enhance the institutional platforms through which consultations are carried out by political parties, peopleâs congresses, government departments, CPPCC committees, peopleâs organizations, communities, and social organizations, and strengthen coordination between the various channels of consultation. We will improve the mechanisms for conductingâconsultations prior to decision making and during the implementationâof decisions. Improvements will also be made to the mechanisms for adopting, implementing, and providing feedback on the consultationâoutcomes.\n\n(31) Enhancing democracy at theâprimary level\n\nWe will improve the mechanismsâfor conductingâcommunity-level self-governance under the leadership of Party organizationsâat the primary level. We willârefine the institutional and working systems for primary-level democracyâand create more channels to allow for the well-ordered participationâof various primary-level organizations and local people in the governance of their communities. We will enhance the institutions for keeping the public informed. We will improve the democratic management systems in enterprises and public institutions, which generally take the form of workersâ congresses. In addition, more effective ways will be developed to ensure that enterprise employees can participate in management.\n\n(32) Building a broad united front\n\nWe will improve the policies and measures for facilitating the united frontâs political role in rallying the support of the people and pooling their strength. We will uphold, develop, and improve Chinaâs new type of political party system.

A law on promoting ethnic solidarity and progress will be formulated, and we will take steps to improve the institutions and mechanisms for forging a strong sense of community for theâChinese nation so as to further strengthenâour national cohesion. We will make systematicâefforts to ensure that religions in China are Chinese in orientationâand establish a more solid legal footing for the governance of religious affairs. We will improve the mechanisms for providing political guidance to non-CPC intellectuals and people from emerging social groups. We willâcontinue working to cultivate a cordial and clean relationship between government and business across the board and improve the working mechanisms for facilitatingâthe healthy development of the non-public sector and those working inâit.âWe will refine the mechanisms for work related to Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese affairs.\n\nIX. Promoting Socialist Rule of Law with Chinese Characteristics\n\nThe rule of law providesâan important guarantee forâChinese modernization. We must ensure full implementation ofâthe Constitution andâuphold its authority, coordinate the reforms to promote sound legislation, law enforcement, administration of justice, and observance of the law, and improve the mechanisms for ensuring that all are equal before the law, so as to promote socialist rule of law, uphold social fairness and justice, and see that all work of the state is carried out under the rule of law.\n\n(33) Deepening reforms inâlegislation\n\nThe socialist legal system with Chinese characteristicsâcentered on the Constitution will be improved. We will refineâthe systems for ensuring full implementation ofâthe Constitutionâand establish a systemâfor reporting on its implementation. We will improve the legislative framework under which Party committees exercise leadership, peopleâs congresses play a principal role, government departments provide support, and various sectors of society get involved. We will make sure that steps to enact, revise, abolish, interpret, and codify lawsâare well-coordinated and work to bolster legislation in key, emerging, and foreign-related areas. Weâwill improveâboth the constitutional review system and the record and review system for normative documents. These efforts will ensure that the quality of legislation further improves.

Improvements will be made to the systemâfor coordinating administrative and criminal penalties, the institutions and mechanisms for administrativeâreconsideration,âandâthe administrative adjudicationâsystem. We will refine both the vertical management system and the tiered management system at the local levelâto promote closer coordination and collaboration between institutions under verticalâmanagement and local governments. Prudent steps will be taken to optimize the institutions in counties with small populations. We will further reform the management system in development zones. We will improve the structure and layout of public institutions to ensure that they better serve the public interest.\n\n(35) Improving the institutions and mechanisms for impartial law enforcement and administrationâof justice\n\nWe willârefineâthe institutions and mechanisms for ensuring thatâsupervisory organs, public security organs, procuratorates,âcourts,âandâadministrative departments for justice all fulfill their respective functions and that powers of supervision, investigation, procuratorate, adjudication, and enforcement complement and constrain each other. This will ensure that law enforcement and judicial activities are subject to effectiveâchecks and oversight at every link and stage in the process. We will deepen the reforms to separate adjudicatory and enforcement powers, improve the national system for law enforcement, and see that the parties concerned, the procuratorates, and the public exercise oversight throughout the process of enforcement activities. We will improve the system for providing legal remedies and protection during the course of law enforcement and judicial activities as well as the system for granting state compensation.

We will develop institutions and mechanisms for coordinated, efficient policing, advance the reform of staffing management in public security organs at the local level, and continue to reform the management systems in the civil aviation public security organs and the anti-smuggling departments of customs authorities. We will standardize the management of policeâauxiliaries.\n\nAdhering to the correct outlook on human rights, we will provide more effective human rights protection through law enforcement and administration of justice. We will improve the working mechanisms for ex ante review, ongoing oversight, and ex post redress and refine the system for coercive measures that concern the personal rights of citizensâas well as the sealing, sequestering,âandâfreezingâof assets. We will investigate and prosecute, in accordance with the law, the abuse of power to bend the law for personal gain, illegal detention, the use of torture to extortâconfessions, and other similar offences. We will see that lawyer defense is provided in all criminal cases and introduce a system to seal records for minor offences.\n\n(36) Improving the mechanisms for building a law-based society\n\nWe will improve the public legal services system covering both urban and rural populations and further reform the systems related to lawyers, notarization, arbitration, mediation, and forensic evidenceâmanagement.

We will improve the arbitration and mediation system for international commercial disputes and cultivate world-class arbitration organizations and law firms. We will actively participate in the formulation of international rules.\n\nX. Deepening Reform in the Cultural Sector\n\nChinese modernization is the modernization of material and cultural-ethical advancement. We must boost our cultural confidence and work to developâadvanced socialist culture, promoteârevolutionary culture, and carry forward fine traditional Chinese culture. We must move faster to stay abreast of new dramatic developments in information technology, cultivate a vast pool of talented personnel in the field of culture, and igniteâthe cultural creativity of the entire nation.\n\n(38) Improving the responsibility system for ideological work\n\nWe will refine the working systems for arming all Party members, educating the people, and guiding our practice with the Partyâs new theories. We will improveâthe system under which the theoretical study groupsâofâParty committees (leading Party members groups)âhold regular study sessions, as well as the system for theoretical and political work. We will develop new approaches in the project to study and develop Marxist theoryâand promote innovation in philosophy and social sciences with a view to building a Chineseâintellectual systemâin this field.âWe will improve the spokesperson system, develop content production and communication mechanisms as well as assessment systems for all forms of media, and promote a systemic transformation in mainstream media. We will improve the mechanisms for guiding public opinion and coordinating responses to public opinion incidents.\n\nActivities to foster ideals and convictionsâwill be carried out on a regular and institutionalized basis. We will enhance the systems and mechanisms for cultivatingâand practicingâthe core socialist values.

We will launch projects to enhance social etiquette and civility in rural areas. We will refine the mechanisms for publicizingâheroes and role models and encouragingâpeople to learn from them and work to develop new mechanisms for promoting patriotism and organizing themedâpublic activities, in an effort to create a socialâatmosphere in which people look up to heroes, pay tributeâto martyrs, and strive to become pioneers. We will establishâa system for carryingâforward traditional Chineseâvirtuesâand improve the institutions and mechanisms for cultivatingâsocial morality, work ethics, family values, and personal integrity. We will refine the long-term mechanismsâfor promoting integrity and credibilityâand provide public education and guidance so that all members of society readily abideâby the lawâand respect public orderâand moral standards. We will take firm steps to oppose money worship, hedonism,âegocentricity,âand historical nihilism. We will develop mechanisms to provide online theoretical and ethical education in a differentiated and targeted manner. We will establish better mechanisms for addressing serious ethical problemsâin a coordinated way and improve the long-termâmechanismsâfor combatingâpornographyâand illegalâpublications.\n\n(39) Refiningâthe mechanisms for supplyingâcultural services and products\n\nWe willâimprove the system of public cultural services, establishing mechanisms for channeling quality cultural resources directly to the community level, improving the mechanisms through which nongovernmental actors participate in the supply of public cultural services, and advancing reforms to separate the ownership and use rights for public cultural facilities. In the cultural sector, we will continue with the reform ofâstate capital and SOEs, deepen the internal reform of public institutionsâon a categorized basis, and improveâthe mechanisms for developing theater troupes.\n\nWe will remain committed toâpeople-centered cultural creation and stay focused on both literary and artistic production and talent cultivation, and on both producing fine works and fostering a favorable environment for creation. On this basis, we will improve the working mechanisms for serving, guiding, and organizing literary and artistic creationâand production. We will refineâthe systems for cultural industries and marketsâas well asâeconomic policiesâconcerning the development of the cultural sector. We will explore effective mechanisms for integratingâculture with science and technologyâand step up our efforts to fosterânew forms of cultural business. We will further reform the systems for culture-related government reviewâandâapproval and recordâkeepingâso as to strengthen ongoing and exâpostâoversight. Comprehensive governance of the cultural and recreational industriesâwill be advanced.\n\nWe will establish coordination agencies for preserving and passing down our cultural heritage and put in place anâinspectionâsystem forâcultural heritage protection to facilitate systematic protection and unified supervision. We will institute a system of the defining symbols of Chinese culture and refine institutions and mechanisms for promoting the full integration of culture and tourism. We will improve the public fitness servicesâsystemâand carry out reforms toârefine the management systems and operating mechanisms forâcompetitive sports.\n\n(40) Improvingâthe system for comprehensive cyberspace governance\n\nWeâwill deepen reform of the internet managementâsystem, combine the functions of online content development and management, and promote integrated management of media communication and online public opinion.

We will step up the law-based governanceâof cyberspace, improve the long-term governance mechanisms for the online environment, and refine the system for protecting minors in cyberspace.\n\n(41) Establishing aâmore effective international communication system\n\nWe will move ahead with restructuring Chinaâs international communicationâframework and deepen the reform and innovation of our mainstream mediaâs international communicationâmechanisms in a bidâto accelerate the development of a multi-channel and multi-dimensional architecture.âWe will move faster to develop Chinaâs discourse and narrative systems with a view to making our international communication more effective. Mechanisms for promoting the implementationâof the Global CivilizationâInitiative will be established. We will work to facilitateâboth outbound and inbound visits to promote broader international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation.\n\nXI. Ensuring and Improving the Peopleâs Wellbeing\n\nEnsuringâand enhancing theâpeopleâs wellbeing in the course of developmentâis one of the major tasks of Chinese modernization. In line with the principle of doing everything within our means, we will refine the systemsâof basic public services, with the focus on providingâinclusive services, meetingâessential needs, and providing a cushion for those most in need. We will strive to resolve the most practical problems that are of the greatest and most direct concern to the people so as to meet peopleâs aspirations for a better life.\n\n(42) Improvingâthe income distribution system\n\nWe will build an institutional framework under which primaryâdistribution, redistribution, and tertiary distribution are well coordinated and mutually complementary.âWe will work to raise the share of personal income in the distribution ofânational income and give more weight to work remuneration in primary distribution.âWe will improveâthe mechanisms for determining wages, ensuring that they are increased at a reasonableârate and that they are paid in full, and refineâthe policy system for distribution based on factors of production. We will improve the redistribution mechanisms such as taxation, social security, and transfer payments. We will support the development of public interest activities and charities.\n\nWe will keep income distribution and the means of accumulating wealth well-regulated, open more avenues for urban and rural residentsâto increase theirâproperty incomes, and put in place systems to effectively boost the incomes of low-incomeâearners, steadily expand the size of the middle-income group, and properly regulateâexcessive incomes. We will further reform the salary-setting mechanism for SOEs and rationally determine and strictly regulate the remuneration standards, allowances, and benefits for SOE executivesâat all levels.\n\n(43) Improving the employment-first policy\n\nWe will develop soundâmechanisms for promoting high-qualityâandâfull employment, refine the related public services system, and workâhard to tackle structuralâunemployment.âWeâwill improve the system of employment supportâfor key groupsâsuch as college graduates,ârural migrant workers, andâex-service membersâand the system of lifelong vocational skills training. We will coordinate urban and rural employment policies,âsimultaneously advance service reforms related to household registration, human resources, and personnel records, improve the policy environment to boost employment by encouraging business startups, and support and regulate the development of new forms of employment. We will improve the systems and mechanisms for promoting equality of opportunityâand see that the channels for social mobility are unimpeded. We will refine the mechanisms for labor relationâconsultationsâand mediation and do more to safeguard workersâârights and interests.\n\n(44) Improving the social security system\n\nWe will improveâthe system for unified national management of basic old-age insurance funds and the uniï¬edânationalâplatform for social insurance public services. We will develop sound systems for ensuring that social security funds are kept safe through supervision and theirâvalue is maintained and increased over time. We will refine the mechanisms for financing basic old-age insurance and basic medical insuranceâand for adjusting the benefits of both as appropriate. Basic pensionâbenefits for rural and non-working urban residentsâunder the basic old-age insurance scheme will be raised gradually. Weâwill build a sound social security system to serve peopleâin flexible employment, rural migrant workers, and those in new forms of employment and expand the coverage of unemployment insurance, workersââcompensation,âandâchildbirthâinsurance programs. We will see to it that all restrictions preventing people from accessing social security in the places where they work but do not hold permanent residency are lifted and that policies for transferring social security accounts are improved. We will move faster to develop a multi-tiered, multi-pillar old-age insurance system, expand the coverage of the annuity system, and promote the implementation of private pension schemes. We will leverage various commercial insurance schemes as a supplementary support. We will work toward provincial-level unified management ofâbasic medical insuranceâfunds, further reform medical insurance paymentâmodels, improve major disease insurance and medical assistanceâschemes, and tightenâoversight over medical insurance funds. We will improve the social assistance system, the system for protectingâthe lawfulârights and interests of women and children, and the social security and service systems for people with disabilities.\n\nWe will moveâfaster to establish a housing system that supports both housing rentals and purchases and foster a new development model for the real estate sector. We will scale upâthe building and supply of government-subsidized housing to meet the essential need of salaried people forâa home to live in. We will also work to support the diverse needs of urban and rural residents for betterâhousing. Municipal governments will be given greater decision-making powers to regulate the real estate market, and based on local conditions, some cities will be permittedâto abolish or reduceârestrictions on housing purchasesâand to scrap relevant standards for ordinary and non-ordinary housing. We will carry out reforms to change the way real estate development is financed and to improve the advance purchase system for commodity housing. Improvements will also be made to the taxation system in the real estate sector.\n\n(45) Further reforming theâmedical and healthcare systems\n\nWe will implement a health-first strategy. We will improve the public health system, promoting public participationâas well as collaborationâand integration between hospitals and disease prevention and control institutions and boosting capacities for disease monitoring and early warning, risk assessment, epidemiological investigation, testing and inspection, emergency response, and medical treatment. We will supportâcoordinated development and governanceâof medical services, medical insurance, and pharmaceuticals. We will do more to increaseâthe availability of quality medical resourcesâand see thatâsuch resources are channeledâtoward the community level and more evenly distributed among regions. We will move faster to develop the tiered diagnosis and treatmentâsystem,âpropel the development of tightly knit medical consortia, and upgrade the services of community-level medical and healthcare institutions. We will deepen the reform of public hospitals to see that they better serve the public interest, establish mechanisms whereby medical expenses are primarily based on medical services, improve the remuneration system, and set up a mechanism for making dynamic staffing adjustments. We will guide and better regulate the development of private hospitals and introduce new approachesâin the supervisionâof medical and healthcare services. We will improve the mechanisms for supporting the development of innovative drugs and medical equipment and for promoting the preservation and innovative development of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n(46) Improving the systemsâfor supporting population developmentâand providing related services\n\nWe will improve the population development strategyâin response to population agingâand the declining birth rate. A sound system will be instituted to provide full life-cycleâpopulation services to all in order to promote high-quality population development. We will refineâthe policy system and incentive mechanisms for boostingâthe birth rateâandâstrive to build a childbirth-friendly society. We will work to bring down the costsâof childbirth, parenting, and education, refine parental leave policies,âintroduce a system of childbirth subsidies, improve basic public services for childbirth and pediatric medical care, and further raise the childcare-related deduction for personal income tax. We will make greater efforts to develop a public-benefitâchildcareâservice system and provide support for employer-run nurseries, communityâchildcare facilities, and home-based childcare. Based on the general patterns underlying population flows, we will see that public services follow the movement of populations and facilitate the reasonable concentrationâof people in and their orderlyâflow between urban and rural areas and different regions.\n\nTo activelyârespondâto population aging, we will refine the policies and mechanisms for developing elderly care programs and industries. We will develop the silver economyâand support the creation of diverse jobs tailored to elderly people. In line with the principle of voluntaryâparticipation with appropriate flexibility, we will advance reform to gradually raise the statutory retirementâage in a prudent and orderly manner. To boost the supply of basic elderly careâservices, we will develop community-based facilities, improveâthe operation mechanisms for public-run institutions, encourage and guide the participation of enterprises and other non-governmental actors in service provision, and promote mutual-aid elderly care and the integration of medical care and elderlyâcare. We will workâfaster to shore up weaknesses inârural elderly care services. We will also see to it that better services are provided for elderly people with special difficultiesâincluding those whoâliveâalone, have disabilities, or suffer from physical impairment, andâaccelerate theâintroduction ofâinsurance schemesâforâlong-term care.\n\nXII. Deepening Reform in Ecological Conservation\n\nChinese modernization is the modernization of harmony between humanity and nature. We must work to improve ecological conservation systems and make concerted efforts to cut carbon emissions, reduce pollution, pursue green development, and boost economic growth. We must activelyârespondâto climate change and move faster to improve the institutions and mechanisms for applying the principle that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.\n\n(47)âImproving the basic systems for ecological conservation\n\nWe will implement region-specific environmental management systemsâfeaturing differentiated, targeted regulation and improve the systems for environmental monitoring and assessment. We will establish sound, united, well-aligned systems for regulating the use of territorial space of all types across the country and for approving territorial space plans. To improve the property rights andâmanagement systems for natural resourceâassets, we will refine theâmechanism for the delegation of ownership over public-owned natural resource assets and establishâsystems for assessing and supervising performance in terms of protecting the environment, protecting and utilizing natural resources, and ensuring that natural resource assets hold theirâvalue and appreciate. We will improve the coordination mechanism for ensuring national ecological security. An environmental code will be compiled.\n\n(48)âImprovingâenvironmental governance systems\n\nWe will develop responsibility, oversight, and market systems as well as laws, regulations, andâpolicies to improve environmental governance"
