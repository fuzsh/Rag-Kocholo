The successful completion and operation of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway has significantly enhanced trade and fostered closer ties between the two nations,\" Sime said.\n\nHe said that the vital railway infrastructure has facilitated efficient transportation of goods under the Chinese management contractor, resulting in reduced costs and opening up new avenues for economic growth and development in both countries.\n\nPassengers chat in the dining cabin of a train in Ethiopia on Sept. 9, 2023.

The Ethiopia-Djibouti trade corridor serves as the primary gateway for Ethiopia, with approximately 90 percent of its imports and exports passing through it."
