Human rights defenders were harassed and intimidated by the authorities.\n\nBackground\n\nUnemployment remained high. The global rise in food prices contributed to an increase in malnutrition among the poor. Eritrea maintained a troop presence in the disputed Ras Doumeira area and Doumeira Island.\n\nFreedom of expression\n\nFreedom of expression was limited. Journalists exercised self-censorship to avoid harassment by the authorities. The government imposed restrictions on the independent press. Human rights defenders’ work was scrutinized by government authorities to harass and intimidate them from carrying out lawful activities.\n\nOn 2 July, poet Ahmed Darar Robleh was arrested for writing poetry critical of the President. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment on 19 July.\n\nFreedom of association\n\nThe government reportedly disrupted trade union activity.\n\nOn 13 October, police prevented the Union of Djibouti Workers (Union Djiboutienne du Travail, UDT) from holding a seminar at the People’s Palace in Djibouti following instructions from the Office of the Prime Minister.\n\nSecurity forces"
