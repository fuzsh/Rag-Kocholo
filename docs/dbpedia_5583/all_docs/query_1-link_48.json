        "text": "The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City is celebrating a big anniversary this month. The museum was officially created 150 years ago on April 6âalmost exactly one year before another New York museum, the Met, was incorporated. What started out as the brainchild of a 19th-century naturalist named Albert Smith Bickmore has gone on to become a major hub of education, research, and innovation. Here are 13 facts you might not know about this beloved institution.\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History used to be located in Central Park.\n\nBickmoreâs vision of establishing a natural history museum in New York City was realized in 1869, when the governor signed off on the idea. (It also helped that he had the support of several influential people, including J.P. Morgan and Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., the father of the future president.) The first exhibit opened in the Central Park Arsenal in 1871, but the museum's collection quickly outgrew the building. Three years later, the foundation of the museumâs first permanent building was built along West 77th Street.\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History has been sending research expeditions around the world since 1881.\n\nEach year, the museum organizes more than 100 research expeditions that visit destinations around the world. This globetrotting tradition dates back to the late 19th century, when Morris K. Jesup became president of the museum. During his tenure from 1880 to 1908, museum ambassadors explored the North Pole, Siberia, Outer Mongolia, Congo, and more.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt hunted animals on the museumâs behalf.\n\nIf you head to the museum's Akeley Hall of African Mammals, youâll see a cluster of elephants. One of them was shot in 1909 by former President Theodore Roosevelt during a specimen-collecting trip to Africa, which was arranged by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. During this trip, Roosevelt, his son Kermit, and naturalist Carl Akeley hunted and donated thousands of African animals to the Smithsonian's network of museums, some of which ended up at AMNH. The trip was labeled a conservation mission, but as Vox notes, the rules surrounding big-game hunting in Africa were a lot different in the early 20th century.\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History has more than 33 million pieces in its collection.\n\nOnly about 3 percent of museum's millions of specimens and cultural artifacts are on public display. Some of the pieces you wonât see include a giant squid beak, a 20-million-year-old butterfly, and a 21,000-carat light blue topaz. According to the museum, its collections grow by 90,000 specimens each year.\n\nThe man who discovered T. Rex worked for the museum.\n\nFossil hunter Barnum Brownâa.k.a. \"the greatest dinosaur collector of all time\"âjoined the museum in 1897 as a field assistant, working his way up to become curator of the department of vertebrate paleontology. He uncovered the first Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton in Hell Creek, Montana, in 1902, and in 1908, he found a near-complete skeleton in Big Dry Creek, Montana. The skeleton came back to the museum, was given the identifier AMNH 5027, and can now be seen in the Hall of Saurischian Dinosaurs.Â According to Mark Norell, chair of the Division of Paleontology, most of the dinosaur specimens on display in the museum were collected by Brown.\n\nMore than $400,000 worth of jewels were stolen from the museum in 1964.\n\nAfter darkness fell on October 29, 1964, a 27-year-old surfer dude from Miami named Jack Murphy, a.k.a. âMurf the Surf,â broke into the museumâs Morgan Memorial Hall (then called the J. P. Morgan Hall of Gems and Minerals) with two accomplices. They climbed a fence, then a fire escape, and attached a rope to a pillar above an open window leading to the hall of jewels. After swinging their way inside, they used a glass cutter and a squeegee to break into cases and grabbed the worldâs biggest sapphire, a 100-carat ruby, and other precious jewels. Murf had been inspired to commit the crime after seeing the movie Topkapi, which featured the robbery of Istanbul's TopkapiÂ Palace Museum.\n\nThe men were later caught and imprisoned, but some of the stones were never recovered, including the 14-carat Eagle Diamond, which was the largest one ever found in the U.S. at that time.\n\nThe pronghorn diorama contains real poop.\n\nSome of the animal exhibits are shockingly lifelike, and that can be attributed to the thought and planning that goes into each display. When the pronghorn diorama was updated in 2012, little pellets of poop were added to the ground for authenticity. The feces had been collected from a ranch in Montana, then freeze-dried and plopped into place using a coffee scoop.\n\nIt takes three days to clean the museumâs blue whale model.\n\nThe blue whale is the largest animal to ever live on Earth, so itâs only fitting that the museumâs replica is true to size, at 94 feet long. Suspended from the ceiling in the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life, the whale model is cleaned once a year with vacuums and long-handled brushes. From head to tail, the cleaning process takes three days to complete.\n\nOne of its directors may have been an inspiration for Indiana Jones.\n\nBefore he was director of the museumâa role he held from 1935 to 1942âRoy Chapman Andrews was an explorer who went to sea to research whales and led expeditions to the Gobi Desert, where his team discovered the first-ever nest of dinosaur eggs. \"I wanted to go everywhere,\" he once wrote. \"I would have started on a dayâs notice for the North Pole or the South, to the jungle or the desert. It made not the slightest difference to me.â According to the Roy Chapman Andrews Society, \"Andrewsâfor whom adventure and narrow escapes from death were a staple of exploringâis said to have served as inspiration for the Hollywood character Indiana Jones.â (George Lucas, it should be noted, has never confirmed this.)\n\nIt has appeared in a handful of movies.\n\nEven if you havenât personally visited the museum, youâve probably seen it in a movie at some point. Most famously, the outside of the building and some interior shots were shown in Night at the Museum (2006) starring Ben Stiller. It has also appeared in The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Wonderstruck (2017), Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), and Malcolm X (1992).\n\nYou can spend the night inside the museum ...\n\nFor an unforgettable slumber party, kids between the ages of 6 and 13 can explore the museum by flashlight. Once they get sleepy, they can set up their sleeping bags in one of four halls: Ocean Life, African Mammals, North American Mammals, or Planet Earth. Grown-ups arenât entirely left out, though. Adults-only sleepovers (ages 21 and up) are occasionally arranged, and those include a buffet dinner, champagne reception, and jazz performance.\n\nâ¦ And get married there, too.\n\nHistory buffs with an ample wedding budget might want to tie the knot beneath the museumâs blue whale or beside aÂ Barosaurus. Several of the museumâs rooms, including the Rose Center for Earth and Space and Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda, can be booked for social events.\n\nThe museum recently updated a controversial diorama."
