        "text": "After the Revolution, the collections were exhibited at the Palais Saint-Pierre before being transferred to the Jardin des Plantes. At the instigation of Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert, academic, doctor, botanist, and mayor of Lyon in 1793, the collections of the first museum in Lyon underwent unprecedented expansion. He added his extensive collection, followed by those of Soubry and La Tourette, as well as multiple dispatches from the Muséum de Paris. In just a few years, it became the biggest natural history museum outside Paris.\n\nBack at the Palais Saint-Pierre from 1819, the museum boomed again in the 1830s, becoming the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle de Lyon (i.e. Lyon natural history museum), featuring a geological and mineralogical gallery and a zoological gallery. An anthropological and ethnographical gallery was added in 1879.\n\nAt the same time in 1879, the Lyon-based industrialist Émile Guimet, who was passionate about Asia following his travels and stays in Japan, created a museum of religions in a building that he conceived and commissioned the design of for this use on Boulevard des Belges in Lyon’s 6th district. In 1884, Émile Guimet decided to open a new museum in Paris dedicated to Asian arts in a building based on the same plans as the museum in Lyon, which he closed.\n\nIn 1913, the Museum’s collections were transferred to a building on Boulevard des Belges, which has been vacated, where they joined Émile Guimet’s collections that he brought back to Lyon to open his second museum in the city. So natural history and Asia were the themes of these two separate museums located on the same site.\n\nIn 1927, at the instigation of the mayor, Édouard Herriot, new collections from the French colonial empire were set up in new rooms. In 1978, the two museums merged, adopting the name Musée Guimet d’Histoire Naturelle (i.e. Guimet natural history museum). In 1979, a large collection of artefacts from Asia, Oceania, Africa, and the Americas put together by missionaries from Lyon’s Society for the Propagation of the Faith was deposited at the museum. Over the following years, the museum added zoological collections from the Musée d’Art et d’Industrie de Saint-Étienne (i.e. Saint-Étienne museum of art and industry), the Marist brothers, and the Lyon Linnean Society.\n\nIn 1991, the Rhône department, which had by was managing the Musée Guimet d’Histoire Naturelle, decided on an ambitious project designed to promote its outstandingly varied and large collections. To do so, it decided to erect a new building symbolically located at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers. A symbolic site for an intellectual and architectural project designed to examine the origins, organisation, and future of humanity. In preparation for the opening of the Musée des Confluences, an ambitious acquisition policy led to the creation of new collections such as contemporary creation of native populations."
