        "text": "We at the Smithsonian like to say that the Hope Diamond is priceless. Its size, color, and eventful history, as well as its long tenure at the heart of the Smithsonian's gem collection, make it a true American treasure. In any case, it's not for sale!\n\nWhat can we say about the value of a gem like the Hope, if we're not going to commit to a specific number? A large part of a gem's value comes from its physical properties: color, clarity, cut, and carat weight. But other, less tangible factors can also increase the value of a gem. For example, as Pierre Cartier recognized a hundred years ago, an eventful, well-documented history is important, as are the tastes and means of an individual buyer. The price of an individual stone reflects the confluence of these and other factors.\n\nBlue diamonds like the Hope are very rare, and the money being spent to purchase them is enormous. Several large blue diamonds have fetched tens of millions of dollars at auction in recent years. In 2008, the 35.56-ct Wittelsbach-Graff diamond sold for $24.3M.In 2014, the 9.75-ct Zoe diamond sold for $32.6M and the 13.22-ct Winston Blue diamond sold for $24.2M. Less well-documented private sales of famous stones such as the Heart of Eternity and the Wittelsbach-Graff may have fetched even higher prices.\n\nGemologists from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) visited the Smithsonian in 1988 to grade the Hope Diamond. They observed that the gem showed evidence of wear, that it had a remarkably strong phosphorescence, and that its clarity was slightly affected by a whitish graining that is common to blue diamonds. They described its color as fancy dark grayish-blue and its clarity as VS1 (Crowningshield 1989).\n\nIn 1996, the Hope Diamond necklace was sent to Harry Winston, Inc. for cleaning and minor restoration work. The diamond was removed from its setting and re-examined by the GIA. In this report, the Hope's color was described as a a natural fancy deep grayish-blue (reflecting a change in GIA's nomenclature for grading, not a change in the assessment of the diamond)."
