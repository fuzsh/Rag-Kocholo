In case of loss or stealing, the Museum cannot be hold for responsible.\n\nCan I access every room with a pushchair?\n\nThe Museum was built in 1875, even if renovations are frequently made; it still not totally fits up the twenty-first century’s standard.\n\nFor security reasons, pushchairs are not allowed in the vivarium, the ground floor’s temporary exhibition and the peristyle.\n\nNote that you can access the first floor but the lift is reserved to people who need it for medical reasons and won’t be offered to families with a pushchair. To ease your visit, we encourage you to leave your pushchair in the reception hall, in exchange; we can lend you a baby carrier\n\nIs there some content in English?\n\nYes, you will find some in the temporary exhibitions as well as in both our permanent rooms (the gallery of Zoology and the gallery of Earth and Universe sciences).\n\nCan I leave the museum and comeback with my ticket later on?\n\nOf course you can, as your ticket is valid for the day. Nonetheless, having a ticket won’t prevent you to wait in the line if necessary.\n\n! No entry after 5:30 pm. !\n\nWhat are the museum’s opening hours?\n\nThe museum is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm, except on Tuesdays on daily basis. During Le Voyage à Nantes, it opens from 10 am to 7 pm, even on Tuesdays.\n\nWhich way should I go?\n\nThere is no imposed way. Indeed, the Museum is made of two floors and five exhibition areas – the two temporary exhibition rooms, the gallery of Zoology, the gallery of Earth and Universe sciences, and the vivarium – it is up to you to visit them in the order you want.\n\nIs there a lift?\n\nYes but its access is restricted. It is reserved for people with mobility difficulties. Please enquire the staff about it.\n\nCan I take photos?\n\nOf course you can, but they have to be taken without flash.\n\nDo not hesitate to share them on social networks with the #museumnantes\n\nCan I touch?\n\nExceptionally, you can touch some stones in the gallery of Earth and Universe sciences when the pictogram is green – if it is red, you are not allowed to.\n\nAre there children activities?\n\nYes there are as we thought the Museum to be accessible and attractive to children. Discover all the activities for children here\n\nWhy do I have to wait before visiting the vivarium?\n\nFor security reasons, only 19 visitors can simultaneously be in this room. If any medical condition prevents you from standing still, please let the staff know.\n\nAre there restrooms? Where can I find them?\n\nOutside the Museum you can find toilets near the entrances and exits of the building. Inside, toilets are located in the reception hall. If you have any questions, you can contact the reception team.\n\nUseful tip: In French “Where are the restrooms please?” is translated “Où sont les toilettes s’il vous plaît ?.”\n\nCan I eat inside the Museum?\n\nNo food or drinks are allowed in the exhibition rooms. Snacks are tolerated in some areas that the staff would be pleased to indicate you if you ask.\n\nCan I breastfeed my baby?\n\nOf course! If you need anything like a quiet place, please ask the staff.\n\nIs there a souvenir shop?\n\nThe museum does not own a souvenir shop but you can buy catalogues and postcards at the information/reception desk.\n\nAre the exhibited animals real?\n\nYes, most of our naturalised animals are real specimens – if not, you will see the indication “moulage” [casting] on the labels.\n\nThe Museum’s collections expanded along the decades. Nowadays, only a few new specimens are acquired, and the legislation is strictly observed to insure the animal and wilderness protection. Most of the time, they come from zoos or farms where they died of natural causes. These new acquisitions are a way to replace damaged items or to fill a gap in our collections.\n\nCan I leave a review somewhere?\n\nYou can leave your opinion on Google Maps, as well as on our social networks (Instagram, Facebook ou Tik Tok).\n\nFinally, you can however send us your feedback by email (sylvie.le-berre@nantesmetropole.fr)\n\nWe regularly check feedbacks and suggestions.\n\nIs there an offer to lower my visit’s price?\n\nAccording to your situation, buying a pass can be profitable.\n\nIf you visit Nantes’ museums more than once a year, do not hesitate to take the \"Pass musées\"\n\nIf you only are in Nantes for some days and want to visit several museums, Nantes tourisme (facing the Château des Ducs de Bretagne) sells passes that gives you access to different sites and to public transportation for 24, 48 or 72 hours.\n\nGood to know: Nantes’ museums are always free for people under 18 as well as for everyone on the first Sunday of the month (except during Le voyage à Nantes).\n\nLearn more here"
