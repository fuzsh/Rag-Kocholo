        "text": "Star of India\n\nThe spectacular Star of India is just over 563 carats, making it the largest gem-quality star sapphire known. It is celebrated for its well-defined star, which is visible on both sides.\n\nCity of Gems\n\nRatnapura, Sri Lanka, known as the “City of Gems,” has been a hub for the gem trade for more than 2,000 years. Early on, nearby miners supplied local Sinhalese traders with famously fine sapphires and rubies.\n\nThose mines have been supplanted by newer sources, so traders today often travel to East Africa and Australia instead. But Sri Lanka is still renowned for its rough sapphires, especially the popular but rare pink-orange padparadscha (“lotus-colored”) sapphire.\n\nDeLong Star Ruby\n\nThis magnificent ruby, known for its strong star and unusually large size, comes from Mogok, Myanmar, a famed source of the finest rubies.\n\nThe star, or asterism, displayed both here and in the Star of India sapphire, is caused by needle-like inclusions within the gem, an effect best displayed in a rounded cabochon cut.\n\nRedder than Red Rubies\n\nWhy do some rubies have such intense color?\n\nBecause they also fluoresce. When illuminated by ultraviolet (UV) rays, the chromium in rubies causes them to absorb this invisible light and then emit it as a glowing red.\n\nUV in daylight make fine rubies glow redder than red. In sunlight, rubies appear super red.\n\nEmerald is the intense green variety of the mineral beryl, which comes in many colors.\n\nTypically, emeralds are heavily flawed, with cracks and inclusions of fluids and mineral fragments from the rocks in which they grew. When these flaws resemble branches and leaves within the emerald, they are referred to as jardin, French for “garden.”\n\nThe Brazilian Princess Topaz\n\nIn the 1950s, a 75-pound (34 kg) light-blue, gem-quality crystal was discovered in Brazil.\n\nThe technology for cutting such a large stone did not exist, so it was put into storage. Twenty years later, the stone was fashioned into what was, at the time, the largest cut gem in the world—the Brazilian Princess, weighing 9.5 pounds (4.5 kg).\n\nColorless Crystals\n\nDiscarded by Brazilian tin miners in the 1950s, colorless and pale blue topaz crystals—less valuable than tin ore—accumulated in piles of debris.\n\nDecades later, the crystals were rescued from dumps when it was discovered that irradiation and heat turned the colorless topaz blue and deepened the color of pale topaz.\n\nIrradiation followed by heat transforms colorless topaz into an attractive blue. This artificial process is essentially identical to the natural process that creates blue topaz, just much faster.\n\nBest Bling\n\nDoes this stunning diamond necklace look familiar?\n\nRihanna wore the 110-carat diamond Organdie necklace designed by Michelle Ong for Carnet on the cover of Essence magazine in February 2021. Now part of the Museum's permanent collection, the necklace is on view in the Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals.\n\nA Spectrum of Colorful Diamonds\n\nWhile people usually think of diamonds as colorless, most are actually yellowish. Some come in “fancy” colors like pink, blue, purple, and red. Only colorless diamonds reflect white light into the full rainbow spectrum.\n\nPinwheels in Amethyst\n\nA typical quartz is a six-sided prism topped by a six-sided pyramid. Alternating pyramid faces have different surface properties and, as a result, two faces next to each other can display different colors.\n\nThe result is a three-bladed pinwheel effect in some amethysts.\n\nCrystals Named for Mountains\n\nCairngorm is a variety of yellow-brown to orange-brown gemstone quartz named after the Cairngorm Mountains of the Scottish Highlands.\n\nFor the past three centuries, locals and tourists, including Queen Victoria, have searched the mountains of these crystals by digging or by collecting them from the surface.\n\nA Pearl is Born\n\nA pearl forms when a foreign body lodges in the mantle tissue within the shell of a living mollusk, typically an oyster.\n\nUnable to remove the irritant, the mollusk secretes thin, concentric layers of nacre to coat it, creating a pearl.\n\nDiving for Pearls\n\nBefore modern diving gear, pearls were harvested by specialized free divers worldwide. In Japan, ama, or “ocean women” have been gathering pearls for centuries.\n\nThe ama appeared in the first collection of Japanese poetry, dated to AD 750. To this day, ama perform diving demonstrations at the Mikimoto Pearl Island Museum in Japan.\n\nFormed from Tree Sap\n\nAmber is fossilized resin, such as sap from conifer trees.\n\nThough hard enough to be drilled and carved, these resins were once sticky and fluid enough to trap insects and other small animals, which can still be found inside some amber gems."
