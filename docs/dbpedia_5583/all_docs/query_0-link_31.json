Located in the heart of the Jardin des Plantes botanical gardens, it has dinosaur and whale skeletons, a stuffed rhinoceros dated from Louis XVI's reign, minerals and giant crystals, numerous insects, and everything you could ever want to know about the history of the botanical world. The centerpiece, the Grande Galerie de l'Evolution, is a source of vital information about the evolution of different species, the relationship between man and nature and problems related to over-population and pollution. The Gallery of Palaeontology and Comparative Anatomy and Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology are also very informative.",
