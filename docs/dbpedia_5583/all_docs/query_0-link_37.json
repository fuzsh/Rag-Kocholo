        "text": "And it was just one year after opening that a menagerie of different animals taken from fairs and royal domains was then set up as well.\n\nSituated not far from the Bastille in the 5th Arrondissement, the Jardin des Plantes as it is known, became the botanical garden of Paris. Now it includes a small zoo plus the palaeontology museum and the natural history museum and is a fantastic place for all of the family to visit.\n\nThere are several different halls within the museum and three different galleries. The first of these galleries is called the Grande Galerie de l'Evolution, which opened in 1994 after major renovation work and the exhibits portray the evolution of different species, and the relationship between man and nature.\n\nMany say that the most impressive section of the Museum National d Histoire Naturelle, is the Grande Galerie de l'Evolution which is dominated by a life sized procession of African animals, led by elephants as it crosses the ground floor of this museum. And, as you can no doubt appreciate, numerous tours and school parties are always booking to visit this incredible place, so it can become rather crowded at times, even though it is such a large space.\n\nAnother of the galleries is called the Galerie de Paléontologie et d'Anatomie Comparée, where you can get to see things such as dinosaur skeletons, along with the comparative anatomy hall devoted to the vertebrates.\n\nThe third gallery is called the Galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie and provides some absolutely fantastic displays of minerals and crystals and a huge exhibition of meteorites.\n\nThere are other halls such as paleobotany hall, which is designed to trace the history of the plant world and the entomology hall, which is devoted to insects.\n\nPlus the Jardin des Plantes will take the visitor on a walk through the many different garden areas, such as the rose garden, the iris garden, the alpine garden and the maze, along with the Botany school section.\n\nThe information signs are generally in French although there are some that have been translated into English.\n\nAnd whether you are thinking of visiting for the cultural, educational or scientific aspects, with its spectacular exhibits which retrace the evolution of nature, this well established museum has something for everyone to enjoy no matter what the age!\n\nThe Museum also regularly features visual projections as part of temporary exhibitions on very diverse subjects, which extend and add a final touch to the permanent exhibitions.\n\nYou will also be pleased to know that you are allowed to take photographs and videos but you must not use any flashes and if you book in advance, you can also arrange specific guided tours and tours for large groups.\n\nAnd although this is classified as one museum, technically they are separate as the different galleries are in separate buildings with different entrances, so below you will find the details of these.\n\nAddress & Contact Details:\n\nGrande Galerie de L'Evolution\n\nAddress:\n\nJardin des Plantes\n\n36 Rue Geoffroy Saint Hilaire\n\n75005\n\nParis\n\nTelephone: 01 40 79 54 79\n\nOpen every day except a Tuesday from 10am to 6pm and this particular part of the museum also has a boutique, cafe and a restaurant.\n\nGaleries de Paleontologie et d'Anatomie comparee\n\nAddress:\n\nJardin des Plantes\n\n2 Rue Buffon\n\nParis\n\nFrance\n\nTelephone: 1 40 79 56 01\n\nAgain this is closed on a Tuesday but is open Wednesday through to Monday from 10am to 5pm.\n\nGalerie de Mineralogie et de Geologie\n\nAddress:\n\nJardin des Plantes\n\n36 Rue Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire\n\n75005\n\nParis\n\nTelephone: 1 40 79 56 01\n\nOnce again it is open every day except a Tuesday from 10am to 5pm\n\nJardin des Plantes\n\nAddress:\n\nRue Cuvier / Rue Buffon / Rue Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire\n\nPlace Valhubert\n\nParis\n\nTelephone: 1 40 79 56 01 / 54 79\n\nThis has free entry and is open every day from 8am through to 5.30pm\n\nMenagerie du Jardin des Plantes\n\nAddress:\n\nRue Cuvier / Rue Buffon / Rue Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire\n\nPlace Valhubert\n\nParis\n\nTelephone: 1 40 79 37 94\n\nThis is open every day from 9am to 5pm"
