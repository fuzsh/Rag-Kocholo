        "text": "Living collections\n\nThey are estimated at 2.5 million specimens and objects. The collections held by the Museum cover a wide range of fields and continue to be enriched. They are loaned for exhibition or study, are regularly consulted and also contribute to the development of knowledge. In addition, the conservation, management, promotion and preparation of these collections are all part of the professional know-how cultivated by the Museum.\n\nThere have been seven generations of taxidermists at the Museum. Each has developed and passed on innovative techniques that have made the Toulouse Museum a benchmark in the field.\n\nAt the heart of the world\n\nThe Museum aims to be a conduit for knowledge in the service of scientific and social issues. Exhibitions, loans, conferences, etc. are all opportunities to compare the collections with current knowledge and topical issues, particularly those relating to the environment, biodiversity and climate change.\n\nThe design and preparation of exhibitions can also provide an opportunity to study collections in a new light or using new techniques (genetics, dating, etc.), and to observe the evolution of scientific knowledge.\n\nEvolution observatory\n\nThe constant enrichment of the collections brings new specimens or reference objects, new subjects for study, which will in turn bear witness to the richness and evolution of biodiversity, whether in the region or on the other side of the world. These items can then be compared with those in past and future collections.\n\nMuseum staff are also involved in scientific campaigns. For example, they are taking part in a survey of the riparian fauna and flora of the Garonne (specific to the river banks) and their evolution, or documenting indigenous cultures in Amazonia.\n\nOpen access to science\n\nToday, collections are also promoted and research shared via digital networks. The Museum’s collections are currently being digitalised. Some of the resources (documentary archives, photos, library catalogue, etc.) are already freely available on websites for the general public, such as Wikimedia and Flickr, and specialist sites such as Joconde and eRecolnat.\n\nThe Toulouse Museum has been awarded the Bronze level Charte Libre label by Wikimedia.\n\nIn line with its objectives of raising awareness and supporting cultural institutions, and in order to highlight the work of cultural institutions that are committed to implementing free digital distribution policies that are accessible to all, Wikimédia France has created the Free Culture in 2022 label and associated visual identity.\n\nThe Culture Libre label assesses a cultural institution such as a library, museum or archive that integrates open content (re-use, including commercial re-use, of cultural content, documents and digitised works) into its digital practices.\n\nWinning the Culture Libre label testifies to the quality of the approaches, strategies and actions put in place, which, from the choice of licence to the use of digital tools, express the convergence of the operational needs of cultural institutions and the changing uses of the general public.\n\nThe Culture Libre label implies a prior commitment by the institution or its supervisory body to the 6 principles described in the Charter of Commitment for the accessibility, openness and distribution of free content by cultural institutions: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/WMFr_Label-Culture-Libre_Charte.pdf\n\nFree content accessible to as many people as possible\n\nFocus on the people\n\nAdapting to collaborative practices\n\nAccess to reliable sources and quality content\n\nEncouraging the sharing and emergence of new forms of knowledge and artistic practice\n\nA policy of developing professional practices"
