        "text": "Do you feel like you know the feline species? Many of us would be tempted to answer this question in the affirmative, as these wild beautiful beasts, both powerful and graceful, mysterious and familiar, captivate our imagination. Given that there are only 38 species in total, far from the 1,200 species of murids (mice, rats, voles), it's not impossible that you may feel like you have an understanding of them.\n\nNow try to name them. The lion, the cat, the tiger, of course, three of the 10 favorite animal species of the French. The cheetah, the leopard, the jaguar, the lynx, the puma... That's eight (11, actually, because there are four species of lynx). One more try and perhaps you'll be able to come up with the snow leopard or even the ocelot. And, unless you are a fan or a scholar, that's as far as you'll go. Unless you know the oncilla, or the margay? The fishing cat, the flat-headed cat? The manul, the colocolo opossum?\n\n\"It's in particular to help people discover this little-known diversity that we have designed this exhibition for the general public,\" said its project manager, Sophie Grisolia. From March 22 to January 7, 2024, the Grande Galerie de l'Evolution of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle will offer visitors access to the large family of felids. They will have an opportunity to explore the diversity, beyond the three species existing in France (domestic cat, wildcat, lynx), and discover their ancestor – the proailurus (and not the famous \"saber-toothed tiger,\" from which no current feline descends).\n\n9,000 years of love\n\nAbove all, visitors will dive into the amazing biology of these fantastic \"hypercarnivore\" predators, kings of stalking, as patient in waiting as they are quick to pounce, even if their success rate in hunting rarely exceeds 20%. They have good hearing, night vision, a delicate touch and a coat of fur that allows them to camouflage. Throughout the exhibition, giant scenes, made thanks to the work of the museum's taxidermy workshop, are placed next to videos and explanatory displays: here retractable claws, raspy tongue – valuable both for scouring the bones and for removing parasites from its own coat – and that mystery that allows cats to fall back on their paws.\n\nRead more Subscribers only The common cat has become an 'environmental scourge'\n\nThe cat, as the only feline that has been successfully domesticated, gives a rhythm to the whole exhibition. Certainly, humans have cohabited with lions, making them into demigods and partners in circus acts. Others have tried to hunt with cheetahs as auxiliaries – without doing a convincing job. With the domestic cat, on the other hand, the love story began at least 9,000 years ago, in the Near East – the oldest known tomb shared by a human skeleton and that of a cat is reconstructed here. And Christianity has long mistreated tomcats, especially the black ones. However since the 19th century, the nobility and independence of the animal have conauered the human species. In France, the number of cats even surpassed that of dogs in 2010, reaching 16 million at the last census. As of 2021; there are 600 million cats in the world. Only fledglings and bats complain about it. But whose fault is it, the cat's or the human being's?"
