The celebrations commenced on June 21 with a reception of the delegates by the director and the professors of the Museum, but the most impressive part of the various ceremonies was the seance solennelle, which was held in a special marquee erected in the Jardin des Plantes on the afternoon of June 25. This ceremony was attended by about 570 French and foreign delegates, representing 35 academies, 71 universities, 117 scientific institutions and 110 scientific societies, and was honoured by the presence of M. Albert Lebrun, the President of the Republic. The Minister of Education, M. Mario Roustan, presided, and the delegates presented their addresses at the commencement of the seance.",
