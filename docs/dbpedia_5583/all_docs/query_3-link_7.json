        "text": "What's the story behind this one?Part curio cabinet, part institution of higher learning—it's part of the Sorbonne—the National Museum of Natural History is filled with exhibitions that inspire awe in visitors of all ages. The museum was founded during the French Revolution, but its collections have roots dating back to the 17th century.\n\nTell us more about the collection. What can we expect from it?The museum consists of 14 locations across France, but the Grande Galerie d'Evolution on the Left Bank is the showstopper all its own, with interiors that pay homage to Art Nouveau Paris through elegant wrought iron railings and soaring glass windows. It's a stark contrast to the main gallery's menagerie of articulated skeletons, taxidermies, and lifelike replications, which are illuminated by a 1,000-square-meter glass ceiling.\n\nAny standout temporary exhibits?The main attraction—especially for kids—is the permanent display of life-size elephants and giraffes, but the temporary exhibitions are also good. Galerie des Enfants hosts hands-on exhibitions targeted toward children; keep an eye out for the gorgeous displays of mounted butterflies, as well—nobody taxidermies and preserves things like the French.\n\nWho's in the crowd?You're as likely to see families with young children as you are solo travelers coming to admire the architecture.\n\nHow easy is it to get around?The museum has packed things in pretty tightly, so can see a lot seeing a lot without necessarily walking miles."
