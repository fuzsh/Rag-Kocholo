Of these, approximately 6,800 were killed in battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while prisoners of war of the British, mostly in the prison ships in New York Harbor. Many of the Veteran's or their faMilitiaes were awarded Government Land Grants in these frontier states. These pioneer settlers led the way to Statehood in Ohio (1803), IN (1816), IL (1818), MI (1837) , Wisconsin (1848) and Minnesota (1858).

Charlestown, Clark Co., IN; b. 20 Apr 1755 in Camden, Camen Co., NJ. While in the Revolutionary War, Armstrong survived several historic battles, including Stoney Point, Monmouth and the Battle of Yorktown. He also made the famous Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware River, which probably changed the course of the war. Although the highest rank he achieved in the Continental Army was captain--he later earned colonel in the Ohio Militiatia--Armstrong earned his stripes. The army was very tiny. There wasn't much room for upper-level officers. Despite his low rank, Armstrong rubbed elbows with the likes of \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne, the Marquise de Lafayette and George Rogers Clark. Following disbandment of the Continental Army in 1784, Armstrong joined the First U.S. Regiment, where he secretly explored land west of the Mississippi. His travels took him no further than the St. Louis area, but the mission laid the foundation for future discoveries In many ways, his excursion across the Mississippi was the precursor of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Upon his retirement from the army, Armstrong owned a general store near Cincinnati, Ohio from 1793-ca. 1807. He married Tabitha Goforth 27 January, 1793 in Columbia, Hamilton, Ohio.He served as justice of the peace for Hamilton County, Ohio from 1796-1797, was treasurer for the Northwest Territory from 1796-1802, and was an officer in the Hamilton County Militiatia from 1796-ca. 1811. Armstrong was also a land speculator in PPA, Ohio, and Indiana. He lived in Clark County, Indiana from 1814 until his death in February, 1816. Inscribed on his tombstone: \"Sacred To the Memory of Col. John Armstrong, who was born April 20, 1755, and Died February 4, 1816\" \"He entered the Army of United States at the commencement of the Revolutionary War, and served his Country seventeen years as a soldier and an Officer.\" [Photo]\n\nARMSTRONG, JOHN, CAPT.
