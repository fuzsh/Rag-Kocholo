He was born September 11, 1927, in Henry County, the son of Frank and Beulah (Adkins) Abney. Howard was diagnosed with untreatable cancer in early June. He is survived by his wife Wilma Jean. Howard and Wilma lived in the Clinton area throughout their lives with many years spent on the family farm southwest of Clinton on Old Pioneer Trail. In 1972 Howard and Wilma moved to Clinton. Howard began a second career of over-the-road truck driving, working for several different companies over the next 15 years. Many trips were taken with Wilma by his side as his copilot. One of the great characteristics of their marriage was their sweet companionship. In fact, Howard and Wilma were far more than husband and wife, they were best friends. Throughout the years, whether raising their family, raising crops on the farm or raising a dust cloud on their motorcycle, they were always together. Rarely would you see one without the other. Howard and Wilma invested their lives in their family and friends. Surviving children include Gary and his wife Debbie, from Huntsville, Alabama; Tom and his wife Brenda, from Marlin, Texas; Marvin and his wife Helen, living on the homeplace on Pioneer Trail, and Susan (Carter) and her husband Duane, living just south of Clinton. Two additional sons, Larry and Allan, died at childbirth. There are seven grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. In celebration of Howard and Wilma's 60th wedding anniversary on June 11, 2009, the entire family gathered to rejoice and to hear Wilma tell of her first blind date with Howard. A special place in Howard's upbringing and heart was filled by his grandparents, Fred \"Grannie\" and Mary \"Mamma\" Adkins. Howard served briefly in the United States Army following World War II, enjoyed fishing and in later years being on his Honda Goldwing, blazing a trail with Wilma across America. Howard and Wilma joined the Christian Motorcyclists Association in September 1990 and built friendships throughout 41 states and portions of Canada as they traveled in the intervening years. While Howard was a lifelong member of the Deepwater Church of the Brethern, he found great joy and spiritual depth in the CMA. Bound together by a love for motorcycles and Jesus Christ, Howard became more and more vocal concerning his faith in Christ as his Savior and Lord in recent years. For the last 10 years, Howard and Wilma have volunteered at the Clinton Senior Center where they have many good friends. Howard was remarkable in many ways as a devoted husband, a good father and an honorable man. He carried a reputation for his values. He stood for honesty, fair play, loyalty, hard work and for doing what is right. Howard leaves a respected name and big shoes to fill for his family. We are proud to call him husband, dad, grandpa, great-grandpa and friend. Our lives are richer for having known him. He will be missed and will always be admired.

She continued to bolster up her family and friends to the very end. a few years ago she had learned some sign language in order to converse with a friend. After suffering a paralyzing stroke in her last week, she was able to move her right hand enough to communicate with her parents telling them, \"I love you.\" Through the two years of ups and downs, she never once blamed God for her illness.

She had returned to the General Hospital 15 weeks ago when her condition became even more grave, and there the end came quietly. Mary Cecilia, daughter of Joseph and Otillia Fisher Langhammer, both German immigrants, who came to find their fortunes in the rich farming country near Manchester, Ia., was born Dec. 25, 1891. She was born on Christmas Day and, according to the old legend, she was vested by that coincidence, with graces and gentleness of spirit and heart that destined her to be a loyal, unselfish character. She grew up near Manchester and there attended school. Early in the 1900's she came with her family to Leonard, Mo., and then in 1912 to Montrose, where her father, a stone mason as well as a farmer, did all of the interior of the Immaculate Conception Church and other buildings, long a part of the community. In February of 1912, she became the wife of William Bichsel and it was in November of the same year that they attended the wedding of Paul Abraham, whose bride was a cousin of Mr. Bichsel. It was less than five years later that she was a widow with two small children and Mr. Abraham had lost his wife and had three little folks to care for. Two years later Mrs. Bichsel and Mr. Abraham were married and the children, already distant cousins, became stepsisters and brothers and were so richly surrounded by love that they scarcely felt the loss of an own father or mother. In God's good time three boys were given to Mr. and Mrs. Abraham, splendid sons who completed their happiness. Mr. Abraham had been living at Andover, S. D., when he was married and he took his wife back there following the wedding in Clinton, performed by Rev. Downey. It was not until 1933 that the Abrahams moved to Henry County where they have since resided. Mrs. Abraham was devoted to her church, family and home and the arts of the housewife were both her pleasure and her task.
