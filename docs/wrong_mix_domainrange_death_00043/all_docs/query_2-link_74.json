Incorporating past approaches that have served as the foundation for the science, this cutting-edge book also explores emerging approaches that will shape its future. Divided into six parts,it covers:â¢ the domain of nursing science;â¢ measurement â classical test theory, IRT, clinimetrics, behavioral observation, biophysical measurement;â¢ models for prediction and explanation â SEM, general growth mixture models, hierarchical models, analysis of dynamic systems;â¢ intervention research â theory-based interventions, causality, third variables, pilot studies, quasi-experimental design, joint models for longitudinal data and time to event;â¢ e-science â DIKW paradigm, big data, data mining, omics, fMRI;â¢ special topics â comparative effectiveness and meta-analysis, patient safety, economics research in nursing, mixed methods, global research dissemination. Written by a distinguished group of international nursing scientists, scientists from relatedï¬elds, and methodologists, the Handbook is the ideal reference for everyone involved in nurs-ing science, whether they are graduate students, academics, editors and reviewers, or clinicalinvestigators.Susan J.

Expertise in quantitative methodologiesis essential for framing research questions and hypotheses, appropriate designs, and analyticalmethods that focus on topics of interest to nursing scientists ranging from measurement ofsymptoms, behavior, and patient-reported outcomes using new technologies and tools; basic andclinical research on the mechanisms that underlie health, behavior and behavior change, andtreatment responses; effectiveness of different interventions to identify best practices at improvinghealth with the least harm; use of approaches that assess health systems, quality of care, and cost-effectiveness of interventions; and translation of interventions for widespread implementationand adoption. In addition, emerging areas of science in the omics and microbiome, biophysicalmeasurement and imaging, informatics technology, and big data are offering new opportuni-ties for nursing scientists and require the use of cutting-edge analytical methods. Todayâs nurs-ing scientists require knowledge and skill in a broad range of quantitative methodologies thatinvolve data mining and visualization techniques, complex mathematical modeling for patternsin biopsychosocial health and longitudinal processes, and innovative computational methods inorder to address critical questions in the science of health. This ï¬rst edition of the Routledge International Handbook for Advanced Quantitative Methods inNursing Science, edited by Susan J. Henly, PhD, RN, FAAN, is a transformative contribution toadvancing global nursing science at this point in its evolution. It offers the ï¬rst in-depth resourceof quantitative methods for nursing research that integrates theory, design, and statistical methods.It includes both traditional and cutting-edge approaches addressing measurement; multilevel andlongitudinal modeling techniques;research designs for observational and randomized trials;e-sciencemethods incorporating big data techniques, omics, and imaging approaches; comparative effec-tiveness research methods; and economic evaluations. Susan Henly is ideally qualiï¬ed to serve as editor of this important handbook. She bringsher scientiï¬c training as a psychometrician with expertise in measurement problems in nurs-ing research and longitudinal methods, and experience as Methods Director for the innovativeCenter for Health Trajectory Research at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing. Asthe former long-term Associate Editor overseeing statistical reviews of manuscripts in NursingResearch and now its Editor, she brings a wealth of knowledge regarding quantitative nursingresearch. The chapters in the Routledge International Handbook for Advanced Quantitative Methods xxiii\n\nP:25\n\nForewordin Nursing Research are co-authored by renowned scientists and methodologists from nursingand related disciplines who have unique capability in the topics of their respective chapters. Herdeliberate selection of international scientists to author chapters enriches this text and broadensthe perspectives related to quantitative methodologies. The topics discussed are widely applicableto addressing research issues within nursing and advancing global nursing science. From my own work in teaching graduate students who are at the forefront of addressingquantitative questions in the domain of nursing, I have been challenged to ï¬nd a comprehensivetext that goes beyond the basics of nursing research design and incorporates contemporary andadvanced methods. The Routledge International Handbook for Advanced Quantitative Methods inNursing Research will serve as the authoritative reference for advanced PhD students, active nurs-ing scientists, journal editors, and policy makers on advanced quantitative research designs andmethods that includes classical and cutting-edge approaches. Considering the changes in nursing research over the past two decades, the Routledge Inter-national Handbook of Advanced Quantitative Methods in Nursing Research is a timely and signiï¬cantcontribution to global nursing science. The legacy of this handbook will be to shape nursingresearch and its discoveries leading to new knowledge and advances in the science of health. Jean F.

Describing, predicting, explaining, and controllinghealth processes and outcomes focuses on persons as individuals or as groups; is inherently multi-variate and multiscale in scope; involves idiographic (person-speciï¬c) and nomological (general)law-ï¬nding; and has roots in the life sciences, physical sciences, and behavioral sciences. Follow-ing a long developmental phase in the 20th century, nursing science is now a maturing science âand in need of an authoritative source for methodological foundations of nursing research. Methodology for nursing science was rooted in the research traditions of psychometrics andthe social sciences and arose secondarily from epidemiological and biostatistical perspectives.Recently, mixed methods research appeared as a rapprochement to the long and overly quarrel-some debate about the relative usefulness of qualitative and quantitative approaches in nursingresearch. Information science analytics and data mining are fast becoming new ways to generateknowledge in nursing research. The contents of the Handbook are wide-ranging. Past methodological approaches that haveserved basic and clinical/translational nursing scientists well are included along with emergingapproaches that will shape its future. Methods are described in integration with research ques-tions relevant to the domain of nursing science, from the cellular and molecular levels of biologyto wide social systems. Because health and illness are complex phenomena, multivariate meth-ods are emphasized. Technical presentation of models and methods necessarily involves use ofmathematics, but at the same time, contributors have created text that provides an engaging andaccessible reading experience. Selection of theory-based methods respects the longstanding pref-erence in nursing for theory-based research and ï¬ts comfortably with advances in methodologythat view quantitative methods as a way to link theory, design, and statistical model when posing,exploring, and answering research questions. The Routledge Handbook of Advanced Quantitative Methods in Nursing Research is intended for aglobal readership of active nursing researchers engaged in advancing nursing science; PhD stu-dents in nursing science; scientiï¬c staff of agencies that fund nursing research, including the peerreviewers of proposals submitted to sponsors; and editors and peer reviewers of journals dissem-inating nursing research results. It also provides essential methodological background for policymakers and clinicians evaluating research results for application in practice. The level of presentation assumes a ï¬rm grasp of basic research methods and classical measure-ment methods. A working knowledge of basic descriptive and inferential statistics equivalent to xxv\n\nP:27\n\nPrefacetwo semesters of graduate level study is needed. Mastery of mathematics through college algebrais essential; completion of the ï¬rst course in calculus and an introduction to linear algebra arehelpful. The book should be suitable for PhD-level courses that integrate nursing inquiry withstudy of multivariate observational design; multivariate quasi-experimental and experimentaldesign; and methods for analyzing big data. The Handbook may also be of interest to advancedgraduate students and researchers in health psychology and allied health disciplines.

McIlvaneNurses have an increasingly central role in the healthcare system. Changing demographics, anaging population, cultural and racial diversity, increased health disparities, and the explosion oftechnology are all impacting health and healthcare. In the United States, passage of the PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased focus on prevention. These forcessynergize to underscore key roles of the nurse. Nurses constitute the largest component of thehealthcare workforce, responsible for the healthcare of individuals, families, and communitiesaround the globe. They interact with patients and families around health and healthcare, andhelp them to navigate often confusing healthcare systems. As scientists, nurses conduct researchto improve health. At a time of increasingly complex societal, economic, and health issues, nursesand nurse scientists are well-positioned to identify pressing research questions, lead the way todiscovery of innovative solutions, and translate scientiï¬c ï¬ndings to improve health, healthcare,and quality of life. This chapter discusses the domain of nursing science; elucidates links between nursing science,practice, and policy; and considers future challenges and opportunities. While not meant to beexhaustive, we consider many areas that comprise the domain of nursing science, as well as majorinitiatives and societal trends shaping its current and future state. The domain of nursing scienceis far-reaching, addressing the needs and improving the health of diverse individuals, families,and communities. The foundational motivation for nursing science is to establish the scientiï¬cbasis for clinical practice through basic, clinical, and translational research, with the ultimate goalof improving health and healthcare. Areas of focusFrom bench to bedside, from clinic to community, nurse scientists conduct research address-ing a broad range of issues with real-world health implications. Nurse scientists are leaders inbiobehavioral research, focusing on symptom management. They investigate multiple healthdeterminants including genomic, physiologic, psychological, familial, cultural, and environmen-tal factors. They use a variety of methods and approaches including basic lab research; clinicalintervention studies; translational, implementation, and comparative effectiveness research; andanalyses of cost, outcomes, and quality of care. 3\n\nP:31\n\nPatricia A. Grady and Jessica M. McIlvane Health promotion, disease prevention, and improving quality of life in health and illnessare the cornerstones of nursing science. Nurse scientists conduct research to promote positiveoutcomes across the lifespan. They design coping-skills interventions for parents with prema-ture infants; community-based interventions to reduce sexually transmitted infections in ado-lescents; psychosocial interventions for informal caregivers; and interventions to help familieswith decision-making in palliative and end-of-life care. They focus on improving symptommanagement in clinical settings and optimizing self-management of symptoms. They emphasizethe active role of patients and families in their own healthcare. Along with an emphasis on developing and testing behavioral interventions to promotehealth, nursing science maintains a strong foundation in basic research. Nurse scientists seek toexpand knowledge of underlying biological systems, including genetic contributions to symp-toms, and to health conditions such as obesity and sleep disorders. Nursing science emphasizesbasic behavioral and social science research in determining the predictors of illness and identify-ing interventions for at-risk groups and the population at large (Rose, 1992). Nurse scientists play an integral role in transforming the healthcare system. They are on theleading edge of research into patient-centered care, personalized medicine, and genomics, areasof research that will allow treatments and interventions to be tailored to individuals. Todayâshealthcare system must cope with an increase in multiple chronic conditions and long-term careneeds, requiring a greater emphasis on patient care coordination and transitional care to supportindividuals from hospital to home. Nurse scientists are on the forefront of developing, testing,and implementing new models of care. With an increasing emphasis on providing quality carewhile reducing unnecessary tests, treatments, and costs, nurse scientists are working to identify themost effective clinical treatments and behavioral interventions through comparative effectivenessresearch. Communicating science to key stakeholders is critical. Nurse scientists translate, disseminate,and implement research ï¬ndings into evidence-based practice; communicate science to practic-ing nurses, other healthcare practitioners, patients, communities, and policy makers; and informhealth policy. Table 1.1 summarizes the areas of focus, populations studied, and methods used inthe domain of nursing science. Guiding initiativesMany factors shape the state of nursing science. Research priorities set forth by the United StatesNational Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), along with other national and global initiatives,are some of the driving forces behind nursing. These initiatives provide guidance in the currentand emerging content, scope, and domain of nursing science, as well as strategies for transform-ing healthcare. NINRâs strategic plan (2011) reï¬ects priorities developed in collaboration withscientists across the globe; its key focal point is âthe science of health.â To advance the science ofhealth, NINR focuses on: (a) enhancing health promotion and disease prevention; (b) improvingquality of life by managing symptoms of acute and chronic illness; (c) improving palliative andend-of-life care; (d) enhancing innovation in science and practice; and (e) developing the nextgeneration of nurse scientists. NINR supports research to improve health across the lifespan, withan emphasis on underserved populations. NINR is committed to promoting health equity andeliminating health disparities by emphasizing culturally appropriate interventions that incorpo-rate views of diverse communities. In 2010, Sigma Theta Tau (the Honor Society of Nursing) created a global initiative in com-memoration of the centennial of Florence Nightingaleâs death (Beck, Dossey, & Rushton, 2010).Research priorities for this initiative include: promotion of healthy communities through health 4\n\nP:32\n\nThe domain of nursing scienceTable 1.1 The domain of nursing scienceAreas of Focus Populations Methodsâ¢ Biobehavioral/Biopsychosocial â¢ Individuals â¢ Interventionâ¢ Symptom Management (e.g., Pain, Fatigue) â¢ Families â¢ Translationâ¢ Acute and Chronic Illness â¢ Communities â¢ Disseminationâ¢ Genetics and Genomics â¢ Vulnerable Groups â¢ Implementationâ¢ Infant & Maternal Health â¢ Diverse Groups â¢ Randomizedâ¢ Palliative and End-of-Life Careâ¢ Health Promotion & Disease Prevention (inclusive of sex, Controlled Trialsâ¢ Self-Management race/ethnicity, â¢ Comparativeâ¢ Caregiving socioeconomicâ¢ Quality of Life status, age, urban/ Effectiveness Researchâ¢ Obesity rural, sexual â¢ Cost Analysesâ¢ Communicable & Non-Communicable Diseases orientation) â¢ Community-Basedâ¢ Health Disparities/Health Inequities â¢ Global Populationsâ¢ Global Health Participatory Researchâ¢ Person-Centered/Personalized Careâ¢ Decision-Making/Risk Behaviorsâ¢ Evidence-Based Practiceâ¢ Behavioral and Social Sciencesâ¢ Technology and Innovationâ¢ Interdisciplinary/Interprofessional/Team Scienceâ¢ Research Methodology/Measurementâ¢ Ethicsâ¢ Policy (Local, State, Federal)â¢ Training Nurse Scientists/Clinicianspromotion and disease prevention; implementation of evidence-based practice; targeting needs ofvulnerable populations; and research capacity development. The Global Health Initiative (GHI),launched by the Obama administration in 2009, seeks to improve global maternal, newborn,child, and family health (KFF, 2012). The GHI sets speciï¬c targets for 2014 related to: maternalhealth; child health; HIV/AIDS; malaria; TB; nutrition; family planning/reproductive health;neglected tropical diseases; and strengthening the health system. The GHI emphasizes resolvingglobal health disparities and achieving health equity. Common to these initiatives is a focus on health promotion and disease prevention; healthinequities, health disparities, and vulnerable populations; and the importance of evidence-basedpractice and training nurse scientists. These initiatives will continue to inï¬uence nurse scientistsas they develop their research programs. Societal trendsThe issues emphasized by any science are shaped, in part, by societal trends, demographic shifts,economic circumstances, and political factors. It is within this context that nurse scientists con-duct research and affect change. Increasing racial/ethnic diversity coupled with persistent ineq-uities in health call for development, dissemination, and implementation of culturally appropriateinterventions for diverse groups. 5\n\nP:33\n\nPatricia A. Grady and Jessica M. McIlvane Populations across the globe are aging rapidly (CDC, 2003; NIA, 2007). Worldwide, the num-ber of people age 65 and older is projected to increase from 500 million in 2006 to one billion in2030; by 2030, projected increases of up to 140% are anticipated in developing countries (NIA,2007). Increased numbers of older adults with multiple, chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease,arthritis) will need care that adds signiï¬cant costs to healthcare systems (NIA, 2007). Burden oninformal caregivers will rise (IOM, 2008), as will burden on developing countries with limitedresources for basic public health concerns (e.g., maternal and infant health; CDC, 2003). Challenges in preventable conditions will inï¬uence the provision of care and necessitate newways to intervene. Obesity threatens to increase healthcare costs and decreases quality of life.In 2008, over 1.4 billion adults worldwide were overweight, of whom 500 million were obese(WHO, 2012a). Worldwide, an estimated 34 million people were infected with HIV in 2010,68% of whom lived in sub-Saharan Africa (The Global Fund, 2012). Prevention of HIV/AIDSwill continue to be a global priority. In the United States, these changes are occurring against the backdrop of an evolving health-care system. The ACA is stimulating dramatic shifts in healthcare. Expected changes include morepeople with health insurance; greater emphasis on prevention and wellness; and implementation ofnew models of care. New technologies (e.g., genetic testing, electronic health records) may improvehealth outcomes, but healthcare providers must learn to use them, and unforeseen ethical issues inpatient care may arise. Disseminating new technologies in developing countries that lack health-care, economic resources, and infrastructure for research and program delivery is a serious challenge. This convergence of worldwide trends presents challenges and opportunities as nursing sci-ence moves forward in the 21st century. Nurse scientists will continue to play a vital role inhealth promotion and disease prevention efforts for diverse populations; address pressing issuesin evolving healthcare systems; and develop interventions to improve quality of life for everyone. Multifaceted nature of nursing scienceNursing science is multifaceted in both its domain and methods of research. First, nursing sci-ence integrates research questions across biological, psychological/behavioral, and social realms.Second, nursing science addresses research questions across the spectrum of basic, clinical, andtranslational research. Great strides have been made in establishing a strong foundation of basicand clinical biobehavioral research and in translating ï¬ndings to inform practice; the followingrepresent some remaining challenges. Biopsychosocial approachesIntegration of behavior and biology is one of the most central and inï¬uential principles of nurs-ing science (Grady, 2006). Nurse scientists have long examined interactions among biological,psychological, and social aspects of health while also considering the sociocultural contexts inwhich people live. To better understand, prevent, and address complex health problems, such asthe co-occurrence of chronic obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, continued emphasis on multipleperspectives and disciplines will be more likely to result in solutions and better patient outcomes(Grey & Connolly, 2008). A thorough understanding of the complex dynamic relationships between biopsycho-social variables and health requires interprofessional collaborations and a team scienceapproach. Team science can take various forms of collaboration across disciplines includ-ing: multidisciplinary â research coordinated among scientists from different disciplines;interdisciplinary â research by a group of scientists on issues that fall on the boundaries of 6\n\nP:34\n\nThe domain of nursing sciencevarious disciplines; and transdisciplinary â researchers from different disciplines workingtowards a common scientific goal involving information exchange and the integration andmodification of scientific approaches (Grady, 2010). Each has benefits and ways of operat-ing that need to be navigated by the research group. Interdisciplinary collaborations provide a richness of theoretical perspectives, interventionstrategies, and application of innovative technologies that would not be possible with one disci-pline (Bindler, Richardson, Daratha, & Wordell, 2012; Grey & Connolly, 2008). Such collabora-tions increase understanding of complicated issues and increase chances of changing practice andpolicy. However, interdisciplinary research can be time consuming, expensive, and labor inten-sive. It can be difï¬cult to integrate varying terminologies, theoretical perspectives, and researchmethods across disciplines and may present challenges for scientists to obtain funding and publishin traditional venues. Varying cultural norms, practices, and regulations across institutions maypresent additional barriers (Grey & Connolly, 2008). Yet, interdisciplinary collaborations providegreat potential to improve patient outcomes, and researchers can reap the rewards of such col-laborations with careful planning, agreement on shared and independent responsibilities, clearcommunication, and building trust within the research team (Bennett & Gadlin, 2012; Bindleret al., 2012). There are many examples of integrated biopsychosocial perspectives in research. Dr. PamelaMitchell and colleagues designed an intervention that taught people recovering from stroke torecognize depression as observable and modiï¬able, and to increase the level of pleasant events toimprove mood. In an efï¬cacy RCT over the year following a stroke event, they found a signiï¬-cant difference at 12 months in reduction of depressive symptom severity in those receiving theexperimental treatment and antidepressants, compared with those receiving usual care and anti-depressants (Mitchell et al., 2009). This work on post-stroke depression illustrates links betweenpsychological/behavioral factors and physical illness and the important role clinicians play infacilitating recovery from stroke. Numerous examples of biobehavioral nursing science arise from the rapidly growing area ofgenomics. Millions of Americans of all ages suffer from pain, fatigue, and other distressing symp-toms. Such symptoms are often not well understood, and few effective treatments are available.NINR intramural researchers are seeking to uncover biological causes, and develop the best diag-nostic tools and treatments for these distressing symptoms. Dr. Xiao Min Wangâs research founda correlation between pain intensity in oral surgery patients and gene expression of cytokinesand chemokines at the site of inï¬ammation (Wang et al., 2009). Dr. Leo Saliganâs researchgroup is examining molecular-genetic mechanisms of cancer-related fatigue in patients receiv-ing radiation therapy. They found a relationship between changes in expression of eight genesand increased self-reported, cancer-treatment-related fatigue over time (Hsiao, Wang, Kaushal, &Saligan, 2013). In genomic studies such as these, a better understanding of potential chemicalâtargetsâ in the body could enhance understanding of biobehavioral inï¬uences on health, leadthe way to new drug and behavioral treatments, and potentially identify individuals at risk forcertain conditions that might beneï¬t from early intervention. Translational scienceIdentifying relationships among biological, psychological, and social factors in basic and clinicalresearch is a necessary ï¬rst step. Translational research then builds the bridge from âbench tobedsideâ that transforms ï¬ndings from research into new clinical tools, processes, or applications(Grady, 2010). Nurse scientists have been on the leading edge in bringing person-centered,translational research to the forefront of the health sciences. 7\n\nP:35\n\nPatricia A. Grady and Jessica M. McIlvane Nursing science has built a strong foundation in basic and clinical research that serves to sup-port the early stages of translational research. However, efforts to translate ï¬ndings into effective,generalizable interventions that can be implemented across various settings have been less suc-cessful (IOM, 2001). For example, much of the work in genomics has been basic laboratory-basedresearch, providing a greater foundation for understanding complex biopsychosocial interactionsand health outcomes. A greater emphasis is needed on translating basic science ï¬ndings toimprove health (Calzone & Jenkins, 2011; Conley & Tinkle, 2007). The clinical expertise of nurses enlightens and enriches translation efforts. Sharon Morris,an operating room nurse, recognized that retained objects in patients following surgery was acontinuing hazard. Morris partnered with colleagues to develop a prototype system that taggedsurgical sponges with radio frequency identiï¬cation (RFID) chips that could be detected witha handheld device in real-time in the operating room (Macario, Morris, & Morris, 2006). Thehandheld wand device proved to accurately and rapidly detect RFID-tagged sponges and resultedin the FDA-approved SmartSponge SystemÂ® manufactured by ClearCount Medical Solutions.The SmartSponge SystemÂ® is helping to improve patient safety and save lives in operating roomsthroughout the United States. In this example, Morris saw a critical need in clinical practice,worked with an interdisciplinary team to identify a novel solution, and devised a tool with real-world applications in reducing preventable medical errors. Another example of translating basic nursing science into clinically relevant applications isfound in research on wound healing. Chronic wounds are a serious clinical problem affectingpeople across the lifespan, including children suffering trauma, veterans with combat injuries, anddiabetics with non-healing ulcers. From her prior experiences working as a pediatric nurse in aburn unit, Dr. Marjana Tomic-Canic brought a unique perspective to basic, clinical, and transla-tional research on wound healing. Tomic-Canic and colleagues have explored the developmentof a technique using genetic markers in the skin that could serve as biomarkers for guiding thetreatment of wounds in real-time (Tomic-Canic et al., 2008). This technique, which producesdata that look like colored product âbar codes,â could be used to better deï¬ne wound margins,identify non-healing edges, and serve as clinical tools to guide wound debridement. This basicscience research has the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Thisexample demonstrates how nurse scientists may identify a need in the clinical setting and designa research study testing novel solutions for real-world problems to improve patient care. Linking science with practice and policy Clinical practice and nursing scienceOne of the hallmarks of nursing science is its potential to change clinical practice to improve patientoutcomes. Nursing science informs and inï¬uences practice in three ways:(a) at the point of care,(b) atthe system level, and (c) through dissemination and implementation. Alone and in interaction, theyare key to the ultimate goal of moving basic, clinical, and translational research into the practice arena. Point of careNursing science informs practice at the point of care when nurses use scientiï¬c evidence to informtheir decisions in treating individual patients or groups of patients. As such, evidence-based prac-tice involves making treatment decisions by combining the best scientiï¬c evidence with clin-ical expertise, while also considering patient wishes and preferences (Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray,Haynes, & Richardson, 1996). 8\n\nP:36\n\nThe domain of nursing science Evidence-based practice has potential to improve outcomes and reduce costs, however, imple-menting it is not without challenges (Melnyk, Fineout-Overholt, Gallagher-Ford, & Kaplan,2012). For instance, how do practicing nurses access and use the most current, valid scientiï¬cinformation? How do they address conï¬icting research ï¬ndings? Are there educational or organ-izational barriers? Scientists should consider these issues early in the research process to facilitateidentiï¬cation of the most relevant information for practicing nurses and the most effective waysto communicate scientiï¬c ï¬ndings. One challenge is the lack of consensus on what constitutes âvalidâinformation in evidence-basedpractice. Traditionally, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has been consideredthe gold standard. However, RCTs are not always possible or appropriate to answer a particularresearch question and other research methods (e.g., quasi-experimental, qualitative) may providevaluable information for evidence-based practice. A study of over 1,000 nurses from across the United States revealed generally positive per-ceptions about, and willingness to use, evidence-based practice (Melnyk et al., 2012). However,barriers were identiï¬ed, including lack of time, mentors, and organizational support, as well as theneed for more training and a clearinghouse of information and research ï¬ndings. An additionalbarrier may be that some educational programs focus on teaching rigorous research methodswhile neglecting instruction on how to apply research evidence in patient care. System levelNursing science informs practice when a new or revised practice (e.g., pain management guide-lines) is implemented in a particular institution, organization, or setting (e.g., Magnet hospital).The challenge is to ï¬gure out how best to implement the new practice in light of the organiza-tional culture, structure, leadership, and attitudes about the new or revised practice. Introducingand implementing new or revised evidence-based practices at the system level can be difï¬cult.Raising awareness and promoting positive attitudes about the changes need to be addressed beforefocusing on changing behavior and integrating new behaviors into daily practice (Cullen &Adams, 2012). Such strategies must consider the organizational culture and potential barriers tochange. While there is a growing body of knowledge in this area, there are few RCTs that haveexamined implementation of new practices across various healthcare settings. Dissemination and implementationOnce there is evidence that an intervention is effective, how does one let healthcare providersknow about it (dissemination) and how does one integrate the intervention into standard prac-tice (implementation)? Dissemination research addresses the questions: âhow, when, by whom,and under what circumstances research evidence spreads throughout the agencies, organizations,and front line workers providing public health and clinical servicesâ (NIH, 2009). Implementa-tion research is âthe scientiï¬c study of methods to promote the integration of research ï¬ndingsand evidence-based interventions into healthcare policy and practice. It seeks to understandthe behavior of healthcare professionals and support staff, healthcare organizations, healthcareconsumers and family members, and policymakers in context as key variables in the sustainableadoption, implementation and uptake of evidence-based interventionsâ (NIH, 2009). One important consideration for dissemination is to involve community members andstakeholders in the early stages of research. Community-based participatory research (CBPR)incorporates the ideas of community members at all points in the research process, from earlyidentiï¬cation of research questions, to study design, to intervention implementation (OBSSR, 9\n\nP:37\n\nPatricia A. Grady and Jessica M. McIlvane2012). Part of the CBPR strategy is to get âbuy-inâ from community leaders, to involve themin identifying challenges, and to get their input in designing the research/intervention to addressthose challenges. This helps ensure that interventions are culturally relevant to the communitieswhere they will be implemented. Implementation often involves striking a balance between demonstrating that âcore com-ponentsâ of the intervention were implemented as intended while at the same time allowingfor ï¬exibility in âadaptingâ some components to match the needs of a particular setting (Rabinet al., 2008; Damschroder et al., 2009). In the early stages of research planning, it may be help-ful to think about how an intervention can be implemented across diverse settings and whataspects can be altered to ï¬t the needs of a particular setting while still maintaining the integrityof the intervention. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations are needed, includingreliance on stakeholders in clinical and community settings, as well as consumers and familymembers. Key variables that determine whether the intervention will be successfully dissemi-nated and implemented include: characteristics of the intervention (e.g., ease of administration,cost); characteristics of the adopters (e.g., individuals/nurses, organizations, communities); andcontextual factors (e.g., political, organizational, leadership factors) (Damschroder et al., 2009).Keeping these factors in mind in the initial stages of intervention design may facilitate thelater successful dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions in real-worldsettings. Policy and nursing scienceJust as nursing science and practice synergize, science and policy have a reciprocal relationship.On the one hand, policy decisions can have a profound impact on healthcare and clinical practice(e.g., Medicare, ACA). On the other hand, nurses and nurse scientists have the opportunity toinform or even change health policy by communicating their clinical experiences and scientiï¬cï¬ndings to policymakers. Nurse scientists are currently doing research that informs and changeshealth policy at the local level (e.g., health insurance and hospital policies), the state level (e.g.,state policies on patient-nurse ratios in hospitals), the community level (e.g., school-based phys-ical activity programs), and the federal level (e.g., ACA). Several characteristics of nursing research make the information it generates particularly use-able by policymakers: nursing research addresses public health issues; focuses on people, families,and communities; and draws upon the richness of perspectives from multiple disciplines througha team science approach (Hinshaw, 2011). To do the research alone will not affect change. Tochange clinical practice and policy, nurse scientists must also ensure that research ï¬ndings reachthe intended audiences. On occasion, research will inï¬uence policy in a spontaneous way because ï¬ndings arerelevant to an issue that is âhotâ or in the national spotlight; such ï¬ndings will be of interestto policymakers at that moment in time. More often, nurse scientists need to plan long-termfor how their research might inform policy. Identifying a gap and using rigorous methods areonly the ï¬rst steps; researchers must keep policy implications in mind when they design theirstudy (Grady, 2011). A research project might be successful and produce important, practicalresults. However, if the intervention is too complicated, costly, or difï¬cult to implement (e.g.,unreasonable limits on lifestyle, side effects), then it is unlikely to be amenable to widespreadimplementation. Nurse scientists must think ahead about the policy issues that might bearound the corner, design studies that will have widespread inï¬uence, involve importantstakeholders early in the process, and clearly communicate research ï¬ndings in useable waysto policymakers. 10\n\nP:38\n\nThe domain of nursing science The following research examples demonstrate the integral relationships among research, prac-tice, and policy, and illustrate how successful long-term programs of research can inform practiceand policy in settings including hospital, home, and community. As part of a long-term researchprogram addressing nursing workforce issues, Dr. Linda Aikenâs research team (2010) reportedan association between legislatively mandated nurse stafï¬ng, nurse job satisfaction, and patientmortality. Policymakers heard a powerful message: adequate hospital nurse stafï¬ng improves qual-ity of care and saves lives. Aikenâs research has inï¬uenced nurse stafï¬ng policies in the UnitedStates and abroad. Dr. Mary Naylorâs long-term program of research established the effectivenessof nurse-managed transitional care in reducing rehospitalizations, improving patient outcomes,and reducing costs (e.g., Naylor et al., 2004). Policy implications were explicated (Naylor &Kurtzman, 2011) and disseminated to clinicians, insurers, and policy leaders; now, the ACA con-tains provisions for transitional and coordinated services. Dr. Loretta Sweet Jemmottâs interventionresearch documented that culturally appropriate interventions reduce risky behaviors associatedwith HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases in African American and Latino adolescents (e.g.,Jemmott, Jemmott, Braverman, & Fong, 2005; Jemmott, Jemmott, Fong, & Morales, 2010). Herinterventions were subsequently identiï¬ed as âbest-evidence interventionsâ by the U.S. Centersfor Disease Control; strong collaborative community engagement throughout the research processcontributed to implementation and acceptance by communities, neighborhoods, and families. Nursing science and global healthGlobalization presents challenges, and also new opportunities to form international researchcollaborations with the potential to strengthen the worldwide impact of scientiï¬c discoveriesfor improved health. Nurse scientists can lead the way in developing international researchcollaborations; creating the evidence base for practice; developing low cost, easily administeredinterventions with broad application; and disseminating and implementing interventions acrossdiverse communities. Developed nations with varied health systems and values face common issues such as needingto reduce chronic illness burden, providing quality healthcare at lower costs, eliminating healthdisparities, and integrating new technologies. Nurse scientists will need to adapt and adjustresearch questions and solutions based on the context and pressing issues of each nation; interna-tional collaboration requires an awareness and respect for the uniqueness of how science is donein different settings. Developing countries face unique and often urgent public health issues. While developedcountries experienced an epidemiological shift from infectious to chronic disease as the mainthreats to health, poor, developing countries are seeing a âtriple burdenâ of communicable disease(e.g., TB, HIV/AIDS), non-communicable disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease), and sociobehav-ioral illness (e.g., depression) (WHO, 2012b). This poses new challenges for nurse scientists andrequires an examination of new approaches to intervention. Again, scientiï¬c endeavors couldbeneï¬t from a CBPR approach involving community stakeholders early in the research pro-cess, integrating the wisdom of local communities, and eliciting local input at every step of theresearch process (OBSSR, 2012). As an example, Dr. Samuel Sia and colleagues (Chin et al., 2011), supported in part by theNINR, developed and tested a portable, point-of-care, âlab-on-a-chipâ diagnostic device todetect HIV and associated co-infections. This battery-powered, disposable, highly accurate, creditcard-sized diagnostic device can produce blood-based diagnoses within minutes in practicallyany healthcare setting; it could be invaluable to HIV prevention efforts in developing countries,or in underserved areas across the world. 11\n\nP:39\n\nPatricia A. Grady and Jessica M. McIlvane Future of nursing scienceNurse scientists are poised to lead the way in transforming the healthcare system; working in andleading interdisciplinary teams; translating, disseminating, and implementing science to informpractice and policy; and ultimately improving patient outcomes. As we look to the future, itbehooves us to reï¬ect on priorities for research and training, as well as ways nurse scientists canbe prepared as savvy researchers in rapidly changing healthcare and global landscapes. Multifaceted nursing scienceNurse scientists will face challenges and opportunities as they continue to be leaders in biobehav-ioral research. Here are some suggestions for how to prepare for the research challenges of thefuture: The complexity of issues studied by nurse scientists calls for rigorous research training and acomprehensive, varied toolbox of multivariate statistical and research methods. This handbook isa good starting point in building the toolbox as it provides in-depth information on quantitativemethods to prepare nurse scientists for the future. Pre- and post-doctoral programs will need toprepare nurse scientists with the skills needed to address future health problems. Nurse scientists should seek training opportunities to learn new methods and technologies.Examples are NINRâs Summer Genetics Institute and their methodology boot camp focusing onsymptom science. Nurse scientists at all levels should continue to build interdisciplinary and transdisciplinaryresearch teams to address multifaceted and complex health problems (Grey & Connolly, 2008). Academic and research cultures should change to better support junior scientists takingon interdisciplinary research projects that are time consuming, expensive, and require sharedresources. Such efforts should be valued in tenure decisions, publishing, and grant funding. Informing practice and policyOne of the biggest challenges for nursing and health research is to transition from merely col-lecting data to positively changing clinical practice, health policy, quality of care, and ultimatelyhealth outcomes. Areas to consider as we move the ï¬eld forward are: Junior scientists need to think several steps ahead when they develop a program of research.Strategies to translate, disseminate, and implement interventions and inform evidence-based prac-tice, as well as anticipation of barriers and opportunities, need to be considered early in theresearch process. They may not be personally engaged in each of these steps, but their planningwill be important in facilitating the steps. The above suggestion also applies to policy. Nurse scientists need to think through policyimplications of their work, and even develop research speciï¬cally to inform policy. It will bebeneï¬cial to invest in relationships with policymakers at all levels (e.g., hospital, state, federal) andcommunicate scientiï¬c ï¬ndings in clear, meaningful ways. Publishing research ï¬ndings in scientiï¬c journals is necessary but not sufï¬cient. Long-termprograms of research should also aim for translating, disseminating, and implementing ï¬ndingsto inform practice and policy and optimize patient care. As a ï¬eld, nursing science must invest in todayâs students and tomorrowâs leaders in scienceand policy and open new doors for partnerships at the local, state, federal, and international levels(Grady, 2011). Understanding the different ways in which science informs practice (e.g., at pointof care and system levels) should be a key aspect of training. 12\n\nP:40\n\nThe domain of nursing science Nurse scientists should seek out additional resources available to scientists in general (e.g.,Baron, 2010) and nurse scientists in particular (e.g., Hinshaw & Grady, 2011) on how to com-municate science in meaningful ways to policymakers. The International Handbook of Advanced Quantitative Methods for Nursing Research is timely inthat it provides nurse scientists with valuable research and statistical skills that will serve themwell as they study complex issues, develop interventions to promote health and prevent disease,and mentor the next generation of nurse scientists in a rapidly changing world and healthcarelandscape. We hope this broad overview of nursing science sets the stage for the eloquent dis-cussions of research and statistical methods in the remainder of the book, and that it providesuseful information to junior and senior scientists in their career development and research efforts.

HenlyEfforts to develop nursing theory proceeded with collective self-awareness amidst vigorousdebate from which metatheory (Fawcett, 1984), grand theory (Marriner-Tomey & Alligood,2002) and middle range theory (Smith & Liehr, 2008) emerged. Foundational papers document-ing this largely philosophical endeavor were collected in Nicholl (1986); continued relevance forthe discipline and practice of nursing was argued in Chinn and Kramer (2011); and a remappingof the philosophical orientation for contemporary nursing was proposed by Risjord (2010). Fromthese efforts, theory has come to a valued and privileged position in the heritage of nursing asan academic discipline. The focus of this chapter is theorizing in contemporary nursing science. The concept map inFigure 2.1 depicts theorizing as an iterative process of integrating nursing inquiry with classicaland e-science methods used to investigate nursing phenomena; it reï¬ects the three pillars ofcontemporary science (theory, modeling, and computation; Presidentâs Information TechnologyAdvisory Committee, 2005). The perspective is pragmatic, emphasizing theorizing as it is actu-ally done in the day-to-day work of scientists (cf., Blum, 2014; Hoffmann, 2003). The nursingmetaparadigm (health, person, environment, nurse, time) is central. Person-centered idiographictheory and general law-focused nomothetic theory are distinguished. Expressing scientiï¬c the-ory as a statistical model that can be estimated and evaluated and knowledge-building using bigdata-based e-science approaches are addressed. The ï¬nal stage of nursing research â translationof ï¬ndings to clinical practices (Grady, 2010) â optimizes processes and outcomes of care andreveals directions for future research. Nursing science is the science of healthNursing science is the science of health (Donaldson, 2003; Grady & McIlvane, this volume;NINR, 2011). Nursing science focuses on health and illness in individuals, families, and commu-nities, in ecological context and over time across lifetimes and generations. Design and evaluationof self-care and nursing interventions constitute an area of unique emphasis; intervention goalsare aimed at health promotion, disease prevention, symptom mitigation, and provision of compas-sion at end of life. Nursing intervention research includes articulation of mechanisms that createeffects. Further, understanding the impact of variations in nursing systems on quality, safety,economics of care and care systems, and implementation science are integral to nursing research. 15\n\nP:43\n\nRelationships has Concepts informs that link Wisdom Nurse influences about influences Person affects affects performs inform performs Environment for Intervention Self-Care protectsdescribe promotes restores represented by Health over Time Measurement Error about Volume VelocityDeterministic Functions have Variety Veracity Visual generate Analytic with Value is Computational Design structures Data havelinked with Models predict define explain Variation/Covariation Similarity/Pattern reveals Exploration estimated forProbability Assumptions Populations creates Information Knowledgedefine inferred from Samples Health Outcomes are aboutDiscrete CountableOrdered Continuous may be Status, Events, TrajectoriesFigure 2.1 Concept map: theorizing in nursing science. The concept map is designed to answer the focus question, âWhat is scientiï¬cnursing theorizing about?â Concepts (labels for perceived regularities in the events and objects of scientiï¬c nursing theorizing) are shownin boxes, some of which are nested, and arise from regularities in substantive and methodological objects and events (activities of science),respectively. The concepts within and across substantive and methodological domains are linked by propositions that create semantic units(units of meaning). The concept map demonstrates how the methods of classical science and the knowledge discovery processes of e-scienceare enmeshed with substantive content and mutually codependent. Concept maps are described in Novak & CaÃ±as (2008).\n\nP:44\n\nTheorizing in nursing science Nursing metaparadigm and knowledgescapeThe metaparadigm of person, environment, health, and nursing (Fawcett, 1984; Gortner, 1983)has been the central organizing structure for nursing theory for over 30 years. Time was addedto the metaparadigm (Henly, Wyman, & Findorff, 2011) because it is essential to understandinghealth and illness, especially the processes by which changes in health status are effected (Don-aldson & Crowley, 1978; Gottlieb & Feeley, 1995; Hyman & Corbin, 2001). Inclusion of timeallows a person-centered perspective (cf., Molenaar, 2004) in nursing science consistent withpractice values (Henly, 2007). As in related disciplines, environment as context is fundamental tounderstanding the functioning of human beings, individually and in groups, in health and illnessacross a wide range of spatiotemporal scales (cf., Cairns, Elder, & Costello, 1996; Cohen, 2004;Krieger, 2001; Webster & Ward, 2011). ConceptsIn classical science, concepts are understood as the building blocks of theory (Polit & Hungler,1999, pp. 24â25, 106â107) arising in concert from substantive phenomena and the methods usedto obtain, manipulate, and interpret data. In e-science, the notion of concept is nuanced but canbe regarded as a basic unit of thought underlying human intelligence and communication (Yao,2004) and arising from human knowledge and information at hand (Guergachi, 2003, p. 229). The person metaconcept (as an individual or group,from molecules to populations) is composedof integrated biological, psychological, biobehavioral, social, and spiritual characteristics (Shaver,1985) that bear on health and illness at any one point in time and over time and inï¬uence differencesamong persons in health status, health events experienced, and health trajectory (Henly, Wyman, &Findorff, 2011). Persons are viewed holistically, but without disallowing the interacting scales ofsystems,from molecular to experiential,of which they are composed (i.e.,acknowledging the realityof multiple scales is not equivalent to being reductionistic, but is realistic; Founds, 2009; also seeDada & Mendes, 2011). Environment as context for health includes social, biological, and physicalqualities experienced in multiscale built and naturally occurring settings; the totality of exposuresarising from the environment is now referred to as the exposome (Louis & Sundaram, 2012; Rapa-port, 2012). From the time of Nightingale (1860/1969), environmental manipulation has beenrecognized as a fundamental intervention focus in nursing. Self-care and nursing interventions areactions taken to improve or promote health or prevent disease and constitute the special class of var-iables that are deliberately manipulated to reach a health-related goal (Melnyk & Morrison-Beedy,2012; Sidani & Fleury, this volume). Time and the measurement of time reï¬ect clock/calendar,biological/social, perceived time and transcendence dimensions (Henly, Kallas, Klatt, & Swenson,2003; McGrath & Tschan, 2004). Events and transitions are core occasions in time in the science ofhealth (Chinn, 2012) often associated with critical life situations (Donaldson & Crowley, 1978) orturning points in health/illness trajectories (Wheaton & Gotlib, 1997). Events and transitions marktime, whether as explanatory factor or outcome itself (cf., Singer & Willett, 2003). RelationshipsClassical scientiï¬c theory is concerned with relationships among concepts in an interlocking sys-tem of laws, or ânomological networkâ (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955) that includes observables andsupports explication of mechanisms creating links among substantive concepts. The e-scienceperspective emphasizes description, integration, and prediction particularly in complex systemswhose characteristics are discovered using big data (Cios & Nguyen, this volume; Guergachi, 17\n\nP:45\n\nSusan J. Henly2003). Statements about cause and effect involve both effects of causes (such as the effects ofnursing interventions) and causes of effects (such as causes of patient falls), now viewed in light ofthe potential outcomes framework (Coffman, this volume; Rubin & Zell, this volume). Both thepotential outcomes framework (that deï¬nes cause at the level of the individual) and the e-scienceperspective accommodate emphasis on the individual case, which is essential if nursing scienceis to be consistent with and relevant to practice and provide evidence for personalized care (e.g.,Horowitz, Cullen, Abell, & Christian, 2013; Nardini, Annoni, & Schiavone, 2012). The value for person-centered nursing care arises from intuitive recognition that health-illness experiences of individual persons and groups are unique. In the past, the idiographicscience needed to undergird the practice imperative for person-centered care was generallyset aside in favor of research focused on nomothetics (discovery of general laws). Now, it isunderstood that individual processes (idiographic science) emphasizing unique experiences aremore fundamental (Boker, Molenaar, & Nesselroade, 2009; Henly, Wyman, & Findorff, 2011;e.g., Docherty, Sandelowski, & Preisser, 2006). Models for the individual serve as the basis fordiscovery of more widely applicable âlawsâ of health, which are linked but not necessarily sim-ilar in functional form or parameters (Molenaar, 2004). Understanding both idiographic andnomothetic processes is essential to nursing science. The research question/the interrogation of dataFramed by theory, gaps in knowledge about health and illness motivate the research question. Thenursing research question reï¬ects the subject matter (Grady & McIlvane, Table 1.1, this volume; Hin-shaw, Feetham, & Shaver, 1999; National Institute of Nursing Research, 2011), methods of research,and models used to formalize theoretical propositions. Theory becomes established as it withstandsrepeated encounters with data.
