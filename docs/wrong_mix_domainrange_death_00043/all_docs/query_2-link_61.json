Abnormalities of the skeletal system, heart, central nervous system, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract may also be observed. Intellectual disability, early motor milestones and speech delay are sometimes present; however, there are a considerable number of individuals with normal intelligence.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nMagini, Pamela; Palombo, Flavia; Boito, Simona; Lanzoni, Giulia; Mongelli, Patrizia; Rizzuti, Tommaso; Baccarin, Marco; Pippucci, Tommaso; Seri, Marco; Lalatta, Faustina\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSimpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is an overgrowth syndrome and it is usually diagnosed postnatally, on the basis of phenotype. Prenatal ultrasonography may show fetal alterations, but they are not pathognomonic and most of them are frequently detectable only from the 20th week of gestation. Nevertheless, early diagnosis is important to avoid neonatal complications and make timely and informed decisions about the pregnancy. We report on four fetuses from two unrelated families, in whom the application of whole exome sequencing and array-CGH allowed the identification of GPC3 alterations causing SGBS. The careful follow up of pregnancies and more sophisticated analysis of ultrasound findings led to the identification of early prenatal alterations, which will improve the antenatal diagnosis of SGBS.

The physical characteristics of SGBS have been well documented; however there is a lack of description regarding the behavioral phenotype. We report the case of a 6-year-old boy, with confirmed deletion of 6-8 exons of the glypican-3 gene (GPC3) who presents three distinctive findings: the persistence of the craniopharyngeal canal, an immune-allergic specificity, and a scarcely behavioral phenotype consisting in the association of Austim Spectrum Disorder with accompanying mild intellectual disability and language impairments. He also fulfilled the criteria of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder according to DSM 5 criteria. The specificities of the case are discussed in the light of recent pathophysiological data.

CASE REPORT We present a case of a male infant with SGBS. Abnormal prenatal ultrasound (including congenital diaphragmatic hernia) prompted microarray testing of amniotic fluid cells, which showed deletion on chromosome Xq26.2 affecting the glypican-3 gene consistent with SGBS type I. The infant died six hours after birth and at autopsy showed features of SGBS, including macrosomia, organomegaly, diaphragmatic hernia with consequent pulmonary hypoplasia, cleft palate, large tongue with a midline groove, a supernumerary nipple, Meckel's diverticulum, and abnormal phalanges. Additionally, we observed features that have previously not been described in SGBS, including testes with hyperplastic seminiferous tubules and Mullerian remnants, and placenta with incipient fetal thrombotic vasculopathy. CONCLUSIONS While most patients with SGBS type I survive into childhood or even adulthood, the severe course in our patient was ascribed to pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to the bilateral diaphragmatic hernia.\n\nTwenty-one years to the right diagnosis - clinical overlap of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nKnopp, C; Rudnik-SchÃ¶neborn, S; Zerres, K; Gencik, M; Spengler, S; Eggermann, T\n\n2015-01-01\n\nClinical overlap makes the diagnosis of overgrowth syndromes challenging. Clinical overlap exists between Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) which share pre- and postnatal overgrowth, macroglossia, umbilical hernia, organomegaly, ear lobe creases, and occurrence of embryonal tumors as characteristic features. Based on the clinical history of a patient, who was diagnosed with BWS shortly after birth and reassessed and rediagnosed with SGBS at age 21 years, particular attention should be paid to developing facial dysmorphia. In addition, we delineate further clinical findings that may allow differentiation between both conditions.

This paper represented a seminal work at the time of publication as it not only reported a new family with a disorder that had been called the âgigantism-dysplasia syndromeâ, but also suggested naming the condition the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. This eponym has clearly stood âthe test of timeâ, and that designation is now widely accepted. This paper is graciously republished by Wiley-Blackwell in the Special Festschrift issue honoring Professor Neri. We report on another family with the so-called \"gigantism-dysplasia syndrome\", an X-linked condition characterized by pre-and postnatal overgrowth, characteristic face with apparent coarseness, dysplastic changes in several tissues, and mild intellectual impairment. This condition has been called the Golabi-Rosen syndrome; however, we agree that is the same entity as that described, in a milder form, by Simpson et al. in 1975 and by Behmel et al. in 1984. Therefore, we suggest that this entity be designated the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. The manifestations in affected individuals suggest that this condition represents an X-linked encephalo-tropho-schisis syndrome.

Affected patients present a variable phenotype with pre- and post-natal macrosomia, distinctive facial dysmorphism, organomegaly, and multiple congenital anomalies. Intellectual disability is not constant. About 10% of patients have an increased risk of developing embryonic tumors in early childhood. Only one case of biliary disease has been described so far. GPC3 is localized on Xq26. It encodes for glypican 3, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which among its different known roles, negatively regulates liver regeneration and hepatocyte proliferation. This report concerns a male with a SGBS1, carrier of a GPC3 pathogenic mutation, and neonatal liver disease, who developed an early biliary cirrhosis. Together with the associated risk of cancer and developmental delay, liver transplantation was discussed and then successfully performed at the age of 19 months. A hypothesis on the role of GPC3 in the patient's liver disease is also proposed.

Conversely, there is little information regarding affected females, with very few reported cases, and a clinical definition of this phenotype is still lacking. In the present report we describe an additional case, the first to receive a primary molecular diagnosis based on strong clinical suspicion. Possible explanations for full clinical expression of X-linked recessive conditions in females include several mechanisms, such as skewed X inactivation or homozygosity/compound heterozygosity of the causal mutation. Both of these were excluded in our case. Given that the possibility of full expression of SGBS in females is now firmly established, we recommend that GPC3 analysis be performed in all suggestive female cases.

The patient was born with multiple anomalies not entirely typical of SGBS patients, including penoscrotal hypospadias, a large prostatic utricle, and left coronal craniosynostosis. In addition, he demonstrated endocrine anomalies including a low random cortisol level suspicious for adrenal insufficiency and low testosterone level. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a prostatic utricle in SGBS and the second report of craniosynostosis. The unique disease-causing mutation likely arose de novo in the mother. It is a deletion-insertion that leads to a frameshift at the p.p. S359 [corrected] residue of GPC3 and a premature stop codon after five more amino acids. p. S359 [corrected] is the same residue that is normally cleaved by the Furin convertase, although the significance of this novel mutation with respect to the patient's multiple anomalies is unknown. We present this case as the perinatal course of a patient with unique features of SGBS and a confirmed molecular diagnosis.

The aim of our study is to describe the prenatal sonographic features as well as the genetic work-up. Retrospective analysis of four cases with a pre- or postnatal diagnosis of SGBS in a single tertiary referral center within a period of 4âyears. In the study period, four male fetuses with SGBS were detected. The final diagnosis was made prenatally in three cases. In all cases the second trimester anomaly scan revealed left sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) with additional anomalies; three fetuses with SGBS type 1 showed fetal overgrowth. In two of these, whole exome sequencing showed a possible frameshift mutation and a point mutation in the gene GPC3, respectively. In the third case, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) revealed a hemizygous duplication of exon 3-7 in the gene GPC3. In the fourth case, SGBS type 2 was confirmed by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of amniotic fluid cells showing a deletion of the gene OFD1. We could demonstrate, that in the presence of a CDH, syndromes of the fetus can be increasingly differentiated by detailed sonography followed by a selective and graded molecular diagnostic using microarray techniques and whole exome sequencing.

GPC3 is a proteoglycan localized to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor. To further elucidate the GPC3 function(s), we have screened various cell lines for proteins that interact with GPC3, resulting in the isolation of a 115 kDa protein, identified as CD26. The interaction occurred with both the glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of GPC3 and led to the inhibition of CD26 peptidase activity. Moreover, introduction of CD26 into Cos-1 cells was accompanied by the up-regulation of cell growth, while inclusion of recombinant GPC3 in the media reduced the growth of CD26 transfected Cos-1 cells, drastically. Furthermore, HepG2 C3A cells containing CD26 underwent apoptosis in the presence of recombinant GPC3 in both concentration and time-dependant manner. In light of the fact that inhibition of CD26 reduces the rate of cell proliferation, we propose that a number of physical findings observed in SGBS patients may be a consequence of a direct interaction of GPC3 with CD26. Furthermore, GPC3 without the GPI anchor is capable of inducing apoptosis indicating that neither the GPI anchor nor the membrane attachment is required for apoptosis induction.\n\nPrenatal findings and the genetic diagnosis of fetal overgrowth disorders: Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Chih-Ping\n\n2012-06-01\n\nWith the advent of prenatal sonography, fetal overgrowth can be easily detected. Prenatal-onset overgrowth can be secondary to normal variants of familial tall stature, familial rapid maturation, diabetic macrosomia, and congenital nesidioblastosis, or prenatal-onset overgrowth can be primary due to pathological overgrowth disorders. This article provides a comprehensive review of the prenatal findings and the genetic diagnosis of some of the pathological prenatal-onset overgrowth disorders, such as Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

All had pre- and postnatal overgrowth with 2 adult males attaining heights over 195 cm. Other features included \"coarse\" face with hypertelorism, broad nasal root, cleft palate, full lips with a midline groove of the lower lip, grooved tongue with tongue tie, prominent mandible, congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, supernumerary nipples, splenomegaly, large dysplastic kidneys, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, skeletal abnormalities and postaxial hexadactyly. All affected individuals were of normal intelligence. One boy died at age 19 months of a neuroblastoma. The putative origin of the gene in this family was the maternal great grandmother of the propositus. Eight carrier females, who showed varying manifestations of the gene, have been identified. Anthropometric analysis has identified preliminary characteristic craniofacial dimensions in this syndrome. Molecular studies have shown a maximal lod score of 2.81 with no recombinants observed for the SGB-DXYS68 pairing, mapping the disorder to Xqcen-Xq21.3.\n\nThe SGBS cell strain as a model for the in vitro study of obesity and cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllott, Emma H; Oliver, Elizabeth; Lysaght, Joanne; Gray, Steven G; Reynolds, John V; Roche, Helen M; Pidgeon, Graham P\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe murine adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 is well characterised and used widely, while the human pre-adipocyte cell strain, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS), requires validation for use in human studies. Obesity is currently estimated to account for up to 41 % of the worldwide cancer burden. A human in vitro model system is required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for this poorly understood association. This work investigates the relevance of the SGBS cell strain for obesity and cancer research in humans. Pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 and SGBS were differentiated according to standard protocols. Morphology was assessed by Oil Red O staining. Adipocyte-specific gene expression was measured by qPCR and biochemical function was assessed by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity. Differential gene expression in oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE33 following co-culture with SGBS or primary omental human adipocytes was investigated using Human Cancer Profiler qPCR arrays. During the process of differentiation, SGBS expressed higher levels of adipocyte-specific transcripts and fully differentiated SGBS expressed more similar morphology, transcript levels and biochemical function to primary omental adipocytes, relative to 3T3-L1. Co-culture with SGBS or primary omental adipocytes induced differential expression of genes involved in adhesion (ITGB3), angiogenesis (IGF1, TEK, TNF, VEGFA), apoptosis (GZMA, TERT) and invasion and metastasis (MMP9, TIMP3) in OE33 tumour cells. Comparable adipocyte-specific gene expression, biochemical function and a shared induced gene signature in co-cultured OE33 cells indicate that SGBS is a relevant in vitro model for obesity and cancer research in humans.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTerespolsky, D.; Siegel-Bartelt, J.; Weksberg, R.\n\nSimpson-Golabi Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal macrosomia, minor facial anomalies, and variable visceral, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. Since its first description by Simpson et al., a wide clinical range of cases has been reported. There is great variability in severity, ranging from a mild form associated with long-term survival to an early lethal form with multiple congenital anomalies and severe mental retardation. In 8 reported families, affected individuals died in infancy. Here we present 4 maternally related, male cousins with a severe variant of SGBS. One of these males was aborted therapeutically atmoreÂ Â» 19 weeks of gestation following the detection of multicystic kidneys on ultrasound. The 3 liveborn males were hydropic at birth with a combination of craniofacial anomalies including macrocephaly; apparently low-set, posteriorly angulated ears; hypertelorism; short, broad nose with anteverted nares; large mouth with thin upper vermilion border; prominent philtrum; high-arched or cleft palate; short neck; redundant skin; hypoplastic nails; skeletal defects involving upper and lower limbs; gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies. All 3 patients were hypotonic and neurologically impaired from birth. With the exception of a trilobate left lung in one patient, the cardiorespiratory system was structurally normal. All patients died within the first 8 weeks of life of multiple complications including pneumonia and sepsis. Two SGBS kindreds, with moderate expression of the condition, have been mapped to Xq27. It is not known whether severe, familiar cases, such as ours, are genetically distinct from and map to another locus. Final resolution of the genetic basis of the phenotypic variability in SGBS must await cloning and mutation analysis of the SGBS gene(s). 21 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nHypoxia induces a HIF-1Î± dependent signaling cascade to make a complex metabolic switch in SGBS-adipocytesâ\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeiherer, Andreas; Geiger, Kathrin; Muendlein, Axel; Drexel, Heinz\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo elucidate the complex impact of hypoxia on adipose tissue, resulting in biased metabolism, insulin resistance and finally diabetes we used mature adipocytes derived from a Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome patient for microarray analysis. We found a significantly increased transcription rate of genes involved in glycolysis and a striking association between the pattern of upregulated genes and disease biomarkers for diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. Although their upregulation turned out to be HIF-1Î±-dependent, we identified further transcription factors mainly AP-1 components to play also an important role in hypoxia response. Analyzing the regulatory network of mentioned transcription factors and glycolysis targets we revealed a clear hint for directing glycolysis to glutathione and glycogen synthesis. This metabolic switch in adipocytes enables the cell to prevent oxidative damage in the short term but might induce lipogenesis and establish systemic metabolic disorders in the long run.

Because previous focus has been on upregulated myokines, we screened for downregulated myokines and identified myostatin. We studied the expression of myostatin in relation to exercise and dysglycaemia in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and plasma. We further examined some effects of myostatin on energy metabolism in primary human muscle cells and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes. Sedentary men with or without dysglycaemia underwent a 45-min acute bicycle test before and after 12 weeks of combined endurance and strength training. Blood samples and biopsies from m. vastus lateralis and adipose tissue were collected. Myostatin mRNA expression was reduced in skeletal muscle after acute as well as long-term exercise and was even further downregulated by acute exercise on top of 12-week training. Furthermore, the expression of myostatin at baseline correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity. Myostatin expression in the adipose tissue increased after 12 weeks of training and correlated positively with insulin sensitivity markers. In cultured muscle cells but not in SGBS cells, myostatin promoted an insulin-independent increase in glucose uptake. Furthermore, muscle cells incubated with myostatin had an enhanced rate of glucose oxidation and lactate production. Myostatin was differentially expressed in the muscle and adipose tissue in relation to physical activity and dysglycaemia. Recombinant myostatin increased the consumption of glucose in human skeletal muscle cells, suggesting a complex regulatory role of myostatin in skeletal muscle homeostasis.

To explore this, human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) preadipocytes were differentiated to adipocytes in the presence of 0, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mM of fructose added to a medium containing 5 mM of glucose representing the normal blood glucose concentration. Targeted tracer [1,2-13C2]-d-glucose fate association approach was employed to examine the influence of fructose on the intermediary metabolism of glucose. Increasing concentrations of fructose robustly increased the oxidation of [1,2-13C2]-d-glucose to 13CO2 (p < 0.000001). However, glucose-derived 13CO2 negatively correlated with 13C labeled glutamate, 13C palmitate, and M+1 labeled lactate. These are strong markers of limited tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid synthesis, pentose cycle fluxes, substrate turnover and NAD+/NADP+ or ATP production from glucose via complete oxidation, indicating diminished mitochondrial energy metabolism. Contrarily, a positive correlation was observed between glucose-derived 13CO2 formed and 13C oleate and doses of fructose which indicate the elongation and desaturation of palmitate to oleate for storage. Collectively, these results suggest that fructose preferentially drives glucose through serine oxidation glycine cleavage (SOGC pathway) one-carbon cycle for NAD+/NADP+ production that is utilized in fructose-induced lipogenesis and storage in adipocytes.

We observed that clozapine but not six other antipsychotic drugs reprogrammed the gene expression pattern of differentiating human adipocytes ex vivo, leading to an elevated expression of the browning marker gene UCP1, more and smaller lipid droplets and more mitochondrial DNA than in the untreated white adipocytes. Laser scanning cytometry showed that up to 40% of the differentiating single primary and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes had the characteristic morphological features of browning cells. Furthermore, clozapine significantly upregulated ELOVL3, CIDEA, CYC1, PGC1A and TBX1 genes but not ZIC1 suggesting induction of the beige-like and not the classical brown phenotype. When we tested whether browning induced by clozapine can be explained by its known pharmacological effect of antagonizing serotonin (5HT) receptors, it was found that browning cells expressed 5HT receptors 2A, 1D, 7 and the upregulation of browning markers was diminished in the presence of exogenous 5HT. Undifferentiated progenitors or completely differentiated beige or white adipocytes did not respond to clozapine administration. The clozapine-induced beige cells displayed increased basal and oligomycin-inhibited (proton leak) oxygen consumption, but these cells showed a lower response to cAMP stimulus as compared with control beige adipocytes indicating that they are less capable to respond to natural thermogenic anti-obesity cues. Our data altogether suggest that novel pharmacological stimulation of these masked beige adipocytes can be a future therapeutic target for the treatment of SGA-induced weight gain.\n\nRedundant roles of the phosphatidate phosphatase family in triacylglycerol synthesis in human adipocytes.\n\nPubMed\n\nTemprano, Ana; Sembongi, Hiroshi; Han, Gil-Soo; SebastiÃ¡n, David; Capellades, Jordi; Moreno, CristÃ³bal; Guardiola, Juan; Wabitsch, Martin; Richart, CristÃ³bal; Yanes, Oscar; Zorzano, Antonio; Carman, George M; Siniossoglou, Symeon; Miranda, Merce\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn mammals, the evolutionary conserved family of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases (PAP1), involved in phospholipid and triacylglycerol synthesis, consists of lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3. While mutations in the murine Lpin1 gene cause lipodystrophy and its knockdown in mouse 3T3-L1 cells impairs adipogenesis, deleterious mutations of human LPIN1 do not affect adipose tissue distribution. However, reduced LPIN1 and PAP1 activity has been described in participants with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to characterise the roles of all lipin family members in human adipose tissue and adipogenesis. The expression of the lipin family was analysed in adipose tissue in a cross-sectional study. Moreover, the effects of lipin small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion on in vitro human adipogenesis were assessed. Adipose tissue gene expression of the lipin family is altered in type 2 diabetes. Depletion of every lipin family member in a human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell line, alters expression levels of adipogenic transcription factors and lipid biosynthesis genes in early stages of differentiation. Lipin-1 knockdown alone causes a 95% depletion of PAP1 activity. Despite the reduced PAP1 activity and alterations in early adipogenesis, lipin-silenced cells differentiate and accumulate neutral lipids. Even combinatorial knockdown of lipins shows mild effects on triacylglycerol accumulation in mature adipocytes. Overall, our data support the hypothesis of alternative pathways for triacylglycerol synthesis in human adipocytes under conditions of repressed lipin expression. We propose that induction of alternative lipid phosphate phosphatases, along with the inhibition of lipid hydrolysis, contributes to the maintenance of triacylglycerol content to near normal levels.\n\nAnkyloglossia with cleft lip: A rare case report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJangid, Kritika; Alexander, Aurelian Jovita; Jayakumar, Nadathur Doraiswamy; Varghese, Sheeja; Ramani, Pratibha\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAnkyloglossia or tongue-tie is a congenital anomaly affecting the tongue, which is characterized by thick, short lingual frenulum. This condition causes many difficulties such as limited tongue protrusion, breastfeeding difficulties, speech impairment and lack of self-confidence. It is very rarely associated with any other congenital craniofacial disorders such as cleft lip, X-linked cleft palate, Van der Woude syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Orofacial digital syndrome, Beckwith Weidman syndrome or Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. This article presents a rare case of ankyloglossia associated with cleft lip treated with diode laser in a 12-year-old Indian boy who had undergone surgical correction of associated cleft lip soon after birth. Correction of ankyloglossia at a young age would lead to enhanced phonetics, improved oral hygiene, and overall personality development.

Our aim was to compare SSAO and monoamine oxidase (MAO) expression during in vitro differentiation of human preadipocytes and in adipose and stroma-vascular fractions of human fat depots. A human preadipocyte cell strain from a patient with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome was first used to follow amine oxidase expression during in vitro differentiation. Then, human preadipocytes isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues were cultured under conditions promoting ex vivo adipose differentiation and tested for MAO and SSAO expression. Lastly, human adipose tissue was separated into mature adipocyte and stroma-vascular fractions for analyses of MAO and SSAO at mRNA, protein and activity levels. Both SSAO and MAO were increased from undifferentiated preadipocytes to lipid-laden cells in all the models: 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 murine lineages, human SGBS cell strain or human preadipocytes in primary culture. In human subcutaneous adipose tissue, the adipocyte-enriched fraction exhibited seven-fold higher amine oxidase activity and contained three- to seven-fold higher levels of mRNAs encoded by MAO-A, MAO-B, AOC3 and AOC2 genes than the stroma-vascular fraction. MAO-A and AOC3 genes accounted for the majority of their respective MAO and SSAO activities in human adipose tissue. Most of the SSAO and MAO found in adipose tissue originated from mature adipocytes. Although the mechanism and role of adipogenesis-related increase in amine oxidase expression remain to be established, the resulting elevated levels of amine oxidase activities found in human adipocytes may be of potential interest for therapeutic intervention in obesity.\n\n78 FR 15053 - Simpson Lumber Company, LLC, Shelton, Washington; Simpson Lumber Company, LLC, Tacoma, Washington...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-03-08\n\n...,372B] Simpson Lumber Company, LLC, Shelton, Washington; Simpson Lumber Company, LLC, Tacoma, Washington; Simpson Lumber Company, LLC, Longview, Washington; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On...

Advanced glycation end products are increased in adipose tissue and have been associated with insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation of adipose tissue. Here, we report that delayed intervention with pyridoxamine (PM), a vitamin B6 analog that has been identified as an antiglycating agent, protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia, compared with mice that were not treated. In both HFD-induced and db/db obese mice, impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance were prevented by PM supplementation. PM inhibited the expansion of adipose tissue and adipocyte hypertrophy in mice. In addition, adipogenesis of murine 3T3-L1 and human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome preadipocytes was dose- and time-dependently reduced by PM, as demonstrated by Oil Red O staining and reduced expression of adipogenic differentiation genes. No ectopic fat deposition was found in the liver of HFD mice. The high expression of proinflammatory genes in visceral adipose tissue of the HFD group was significantly attenuated by PM. Treatment with PM partially prevented HFD-induced mild vascular dysfunction. Altogether, these findings highlight the potential of PM to serve as an intervention strategy in obesity.

Content analysis (performed from January to October 2008) of instances of smoking that appeared in the first 18 seasons of The Simpsons television show, which aired from 1989 to 2007. Frequency, impact (positive, negative, neutral) of instances of smoking; and frequency associated with age (child or adolescent versus adult characters), sex and types of characters on the show. There were 795 instances of smoking in the 400 episodes observed. Most (498; 63%) involved male characters. Only 8% of instances of smoking (63) involved child or adolescent characters. Just over a third of instances of smoking (275; 35%) reflected smoking in a negative way, compared with the majority, which reflected smoking in a neutral way (504; 63%) and the minority, which reflected smoking in a positive way (16; 2%). Child and adolescent characters were much more likely to be involved in instances of smoking reflected in a negative way compared with adult characters (odds ratio, 44.93; 95% CI, 16.15-172.18). There are a large number of instances of smoking in The Simpsons television show. Child and adolescent characters are much more likely to be portrayed in instances of smoking reflected in a negative way than adult characters. Viewing The Simpsons characters smoking may prompt children to consider smoking at an early age.\n\n2.

A new understanding of the aquifer flow system was developed as part of the Arbuckle-Simpson Hydrology Study, done in 2003 through 2008 as a collaborative research project between the State of Oklahoma and the Federal government. The U.S. Geological Survey collected 36 water samples from 32 wells and springs in the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer in 2004 through 2006 for geochemical analyses of major ions, trace elements, isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, dissolved gases, and dating tracers. The geochemical analyses were used to characterize the water quality in the aquifer, to describe the origin and movement of ground water from recharge areas to discharge at wells and springs, and to determine the age of water in the aquifer.\n\nThe Cartoon Society: Using \"The Simpsons\" To Teach and Learn Sociology.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nScanlan, Stephen J.; Feinberg, Seth L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nPresents the animated television series \"The Simpsons\" as a tool to reach undergraduate students by using popular culture to teach sociology.

When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretationsâpotentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encounteredâincluding a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.

Excessive growth can be present in a variety of medical conditions as result of abnormal fetal metabolism (i.e., maternal gestational diabetes) or of an overgrowth syndrome. Within this latter group of diseases, a LGA newborn requires a complex differential diagnosis encompassing several syndromes, such as Beckwith-Wiedemman, Sotos, Weaver, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel, Perlman, and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba. Partial or global overgrowth, other dysmorphisms, abdominal organs anomalies, as well as benign and malignant tumors are the common issues to examine for the diagnosis and the monitoring of all these disorders. The molecular bases of these conditions, even if partially known so far, can help in explaining the clinical features and prognosis. The diagnostic course, the genetic investigations and the follow-up of a LGA patient will be presented during the seminar. A wide clinical spectrum from esophageal atresia to VACTERL association. Oesophageal atresia (OA) occurs approximately in 1 in 3000 live births. It can be clinically divided into isolated and syndromic, when associated with other features. The aetiology is largely unknown and is likely to be multifactorial, however, various clues have been uncovered in animal experiments particularly defects in the expression of the gene Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The vast majority of cases are sporadic and the recurrence risk for siblings is 1%. Survival is directly related to birth weight and to the presence of a major cardiac defect. The VACTERL association refers to anomalies of the bony spinal column (V), atresias in the gastrointestinal tract (A), congenital heart lesions (C), tracheoesophageal defects (TE), renal and distal urinary tract anomalies (R) and limb lesions (L). The overall phenotype of a series of newborn patients we observed may vary widely, reflecting the aetiologic heterogeneity of this group of conditions.

The Joins, not known to produce hydrocarbons in central Oklahoma, is frequently overlooked by those more interested in the productive Simpson formations above and the Arbuckle carbonates below. In a study of the lower Simpson to upper Arbuckle interval in northwestern Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, the Joins Formation was found to be present. The central Oklahoma section consists of interbedded gray, olive gray and green splintery moderately waxy shale, cream to light gray homogeneous microcrystallin dolomite, and microcrystalline to finemoreÂ Â» crystalline fossiliferous slightly glauconitic well cemented sandstones are also noted. The entire Joins Formation is moderately to very fossiliferous; primarily consisting of crinoids, ostracods, brachiopods, and trilobites. The ostracod fauna closely resembles and correlates with the Arbuckle Mountain section, which has been extensively studied over the years by such authors as Taff, Ulrich and Harris. Beneath the Joins in this area is a normal section of Arbuckle dolomites. Due to the absence of a basal sand in the Joins the separation of the Joins and Arbuckle, utilizing electric logs only, is frequently tenuous. In comparison with the Arbuckle, the Joins tends to have higher gamma ray and S.P. values. Other tools, such as resistivity, bulk density and photoelectric (PE), are frequently inconclusive. For geologists studying the Simpson-Arbuckle contact in central Oklahoma, the presence or absence of the Joins Formation is best determined through conventional lithologic and palenontologic sample identification techniques. Once this has been done, correlation of electric logs with this type log is possible for the local area.Â«Â less\n\nThree-dimensional geologic model of the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer, south-central Oklahoma\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFaith, Jason R.; Blome, Charles D.; Pantea, Michael P.; Puckette, James O.; Halihan, Todd; Osborn, Noel; Christenson, Scott; Pack, Skip\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer of south-central Oklahoma encompasses more than 850 square kilometers and is the principal water resource for south-central Oklahoma. Rock units comprising the aquifer are characterized by limestone, dolomite, and sandstones assigned to two lower Paleozoic units: the Arbuckle and Simpson Groups. Also considered to be part of the aquifer is the underlying Cambrian-age Timbered Hills Group that contains limestone and sandstone. The highly faulted and fractured nature of the Arbuckle-Simpson units and the variable thickness (600 to 2,750 meters) increases the complexity in determining the subsurface geologic framework of this aquifer. A three-dimensional EarthVision (Trademark) geologic framework model was constructed to quantify the geometric relationships of the rock units of the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer in the Hunton anticline area. This 3-D EarthVision (Trademark) geologic framework model incorporates 54 faults and four modeled units: basement, Arbuckle-Timbered Hills Group, Simpson Group, and post-Simpson. Primary data used to define the model's 54 faults and four modeled surfaces were obtained from geophysical logs, cores, and cuttings from 126 water and petroleum wells. The 3-D framework model both depicts the volumetric extent of the aquifer and provides the stratigraphic layer thickness and elevation data used to construct a MODFLOW version 2000 regional groundwater-flow model.\n\nMaking the Road While Walking It: A Conversation with Richard Simpson\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZabel, Robert H.; Kaff, Marilyn; Teagarden, James\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRichard Simpson is professor of special education at the University of Kansas (KU).

The exact prevalence remains unknown but hundreds of cases have been reported. The diagnosis is usually suspected after birth because of excessive height and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC), advanced bone age, neonatal complications including hypotonia and feeding difficulties, and facial gestalt. Other inconstant clinical abnormalities include scoliosis, cardiac and genitourinary anomalies, seizures and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Variable delays in cognitive and motor development are also observed. The syndrome may also be associated with an increased risk of tumors. Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene (located at chromosome 5q35 and coding for a histone methyltransferase implicated in transcriptional regulation) are responsible for more than 75% of cases. FISH analysis, MLPA or multiplex quantitative PCR allow the detection of total/partial NSD1 deletions, and direct sequencing allows detection of NSD1 mutations. The large majority of NSD1 abnormalities occur de novo and there are very few familial cases. Although most cases are sporadic, several reports of autosomal dominant inheritance have been described. Germline mosaicism has never been reported and the recurrence risk for normal parents is very low (<1%). The main differential diagnoses are Weaver syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome and 22qter deletion syndrome. Management is multidisciplinary. During the neonatal period, therapies are mostly symptomatic, including phototherapy in case of jaundice, treatment of the feeding difficulties and gastroesophageal reflux, and detection and treatment of hypoglycemia.

A.; Morss, R. E.; PaiMazumder, D.; Silvis, V.; Towler, E.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe Arbuckle-Simpson Aquifer in south-central Oklahoma, situated in the heart of the Chickasaw Nation, is the state's only sole-source groundwater basin and sustains the Blue River, the state's only freeflowing river. The recent comprehensive hydrological studies of the aquifer indicate the need for sustainable management of the amount of water extracted. However, the question of how to deal with that management in the face of increasing drought vulnerability, diverse demands, and climate variability and change remains. Water management carries a further imperative to be inclusive of tribal and non-tribal interests. To address these issues, this interdisciplinary project takes an integrated approach to understanding risk perceptions and water decisions for sustainability of the Arbuckle-Simpson Aquifer. Our interdisciplinary research asks: How do stakeholders in the Arbuckle-Simpson Aquifer perceive drought risks across weather and climate scales, and how do these perceptions guide water management decisions given (i) diverse cultural beliefs, (ii) valued hydrologic services, (iii) past drought experience, and (iv) uncertainties in future projection of precipitation and drought? We will use ethnographic methods to diagnose how cultural values and beliefs inform risk perceptions, and how this in turn guides decision making or ignites conflict across different sectors and stakeholder groups. Further, the characterization of drought risk will be examined in the context of historic meteorological and hydrologic events, as well as climate variability and change. This will identify which risks are prioritized, and under what conditions, in regional decision making or water-related conflicts.\n\nLate Holocene sedimentation in a high Arctic coastal setting: Simpson Lagoon and Colville Delta, Alaska\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHanna, Andrea J. M.; Allison, Mead A.; Bianchi, Thomas S.; Marcantonio, Franco; Goff, John A.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nArctic coastal environments near major river outfalls, like Simpson Lagoon, Alaska and the adjacent Colville River Delta, potentially contain high-resolution sediment records useful in elucidating late Holocene Arctic sediment transport pathways and coupled terrestrial-ocean evidence of paleoclimate variability. This study utilizes a multi-tracer geochronology approach (137Cs, 239,240Pu, and 14C) tailored for high-latitude environments to determine the age models for cores collected from Simpson Lagoon, and to date seismic boundaries in shallow acoustic reflection data (CHIRP) to examine late Holocene infill patterns. Modern (~100 y) sediment accumulation rates range from <0.02 to 0.46Â±0.04 cm y-1, with a primary depocenter in western Simpson Lagoon adjacent to the Colville Delta and a secondary depocenter in eastern Simpson Lagoon. CHIRP reflectors, age-constrained by 14C analysis, reveal rapid late Holocene (0-3500 y BP) transgression consistent with high modern shoreline retreat rates. The western depocenter contains >5 m of late Holocene interbedded sediments, likely derived primarily from the Colville River, with onset of accumulation occurring prior to ~3500 y BP. A paleo-high in central Simpson Lagoon, separating the two depocenters, was subaerially exposed prior to ~600 y BP. The millimeters-per-year sedimentation rates across the lagoon, coupled with the undisturbed, interbedded sediment record, indicate that these settings hold great potential to develop new Arctic paleoenvironmental records.\n\nAchievement Data in IEA Studies and Simpson's Paradox\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZuzovsky, Ruth; Steinberg, David M.; Libman, Zipi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper is meant to highlight the occurrence of Simpson's Paradox when using aggregated data obtained from two IEA studies in Israel, while ignoring the effect of a powerful intervening variable in the local context--the ethnicity factor.

However, though readers are able to recalculate examples from hypothetical as well as real data, they may have problems to easily figure where it emerges from. Method First, two kinds of plots are proposed to illustrate the phenomenon graphically, a scatter plot and a line graph. Subsequently, these can be overlaid, resulting in a overlay plot. The plots are applied to the recent large meta-analysis of adverse effects of rosiglitazone on myocardial infarction and to an example from the literature. A large set of meta-analyses is screened for further examples. Results As noted earlier by others, occurrence of Simpson's paradox in the meta-analytic setting, if present, is associated with imbalance of treatment arm size. This is well illustrated by the proposed plots. The rosiglitazone meta-analysis shows an effect reversion if all trials are pooled. In a sample of 157 meta-analyses, nine showed an effect reversion after pooling, though non-significant in all cases. Conclusion The plots give insight on how the imbalance of trial arm size works as a confounder, thus producing Simpson's paradox. Readers can see why meta-analytic methods must be used and what is wrong with simple pooling.

In two experiments, subjects were taught to associate human faces with characters they knew (from the TV show The Simpsons) or characters they did not (novel names). In each experiment, knowledge of the character predicted performance in a recognition memory test, relying only on old/new confidence ratings. In experiment 1, we established the technique and showed that there is a face-learning advantage for known people, even when face items are counterbalanced for familiarity across the experiment. In experiment 2 we replicated the effect in a setting which discouraged subjects from attending more to known than unknown people, and eliminated any visual association between face stimuli and a character from The Simpsons. We conclude that prior knowledge about a person can enhance learning of a new face.\n\nInductive reasoning and judgment interference: experiments on Simpson's paradox.\n\nPubMed\n\nFiedler, Klaus; Walther, Eva; Freytag, Peter; Nickel, Stefanie\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn a series of experiments on inductive reasoning, participants assessed the relationship between gender, success, and a covariate in a situation akin to Simpson's paradox: Although women were less successful then men according to overall statistics, they actually fared better then men at either of two universities. Understanding trivariate relationships of this kind requires cognitive routines similar to analysis of covariance. Across the first five experiments, however, participants generalized the disadvantage of women at the aggregate level to judgments referring to the different levels of the covariate, even when motivation was high and appropriate mental models were activated. The remaining three experiments demonstrated that Simpson's paradox could be mastered when the salience of the covariate was increased and when the salience of gender was decreased by the inclusion of temporal cues that disambiguate the causal status of the covariate.

A current scholarship exists that investigates the ways that the \"aged\" are seen, catered to, advertised at, seemingly marginalized, and represented in the larger context of the mass media. Relying primarily on the theoretical musings of Frederic Jameson and Linda Hutcheon, the article constructs a bridge that places The Simpsons squarely within a postmodern aesthetic and, using this rubric, shows how the inherent political nature of parodic irony can help to create an inversion of meaning.\n\nJohn A.

Dr. Simpson's major areas of scientific research involved the \"hot tower\" hypothesis and its role in hurricanes, structure and maintenance of trade winds, air-sea interaction, and observations and the mechanism for hurricanes and waterspouts. She was also a pioneer in cloud modeling with the first one-dimensional model and had the first cumulus model on a computer. She also played a major role in planning and leading observational experiments on convective cloud systems. The launch of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, a joint U.S.-Japan project, in November of 1997 made it possible for quantitative measurements of tropical rainfall to be obtained on a continuous basis over the entire global tropics. Dr. Simpson was the TRAM Project Scientist from 1986 until its launch in 1997. Her efforts during this crucial period ensured that the mission was both well planned scientifically and well engineered as well as within budget. In this paper, Dr. J. Simpson's nine specific accomplishments during her fifty-year career: (1) hot tower hypothesis, (2) hurricanes, (3) airflow and clouds over heated islands, (4) cloud models, (5) trade winds and their role in cumulus development, (6) air-sea interaction, (7) cloud-cloud interactions and mergers, (8) waterspouts, and (9) TRMM science, will be described and discussed.\n\n\"Old People Are Useless:\" Representations of Aging on \"The Simpsons\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBlakeborough, Darren\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis article looks at how \"The Simpsons'\" representations of aging, considered ageist and stereotypical by some, can be viewed as a positive look at the elderly that attempts to subvert the same stereotypes that it seemingly employs.

IntroducciÃ³n: En 1957 Simpson estandarizÃ³ 5 grados de resecciÃ³n quirÃºrgica para los meningiomas intracraneanos y el porcentaje de recurrencia relacionado con cada uno, estableciendo el paradigma de que la remociÃ³n agresiva de estos tumores junto con fragmentos durales y Ã³seos era necesario para alcanzar la curaciÃ³n. Los avances principalmente en Resonancia MagnÃ©tica, anatomÃ­a patolÃ³gica y tÃ©cnica microqurÃºrgica nos llevan a plantear la relevancia actual de dicha clasificaciÃ³n. MÃ©todos: Se realizÃ³ una revisiÃ³n retrospectiva de los pacientes operados de meningiomas grado I entre Febrero de 2006 y Diciembre de 2015. Se analizaron las imÃ¡genes pre y postoperatorias y la anatomÃ­a patolÃ³gica. Las variables se relacionaron mediante un anÃ¡lisis estadÃ­stico multivariado estableciendo como estadÃ­sticamente significativo una P < 0.05. Resultados: No se objetivÃ³ una diferencia estadÃ­sticamente significativa entre el nÃºmero de recidivas y el grado de resecciÃ³n tumoral segÃºn Simpson I, II, III o IV (P = 0,3117). Esto puede afirmarse para los grados Simpson I y II en donde el nÃºmero de pacientes incluidos en la muestra (n) fue alto. Al analizar como factor de recurrencia la localizaciÃ³n tumoral tampoco se encontrÃ³ una diferencia significativa en cuanto al porcentaje de recidivas entre aquellos tumores localizados en la convexidad, base de crÃ¡neo y parasagitales (P = 0,2203). ConclusiÃ³n: Para los meningiomas grado I la exÃ©resis Simpson I no presenta diferencias significativas con la Simpson II en cuanto a la recurrencia tumoral, por lo que aumentar la morbilidad del procedimiento no tendrÃ­a justificaciÃ³n.

He showed considerable interest in local medicinal practices and plants used by the natives, mainly the Algerian Berbers. He left notes, letters and publications about traditional medicine which were screened for relevant information about medicinal plant use. His reports were compared with current knowledge and recent study results. Many plants described by Hilton-Simpson as therapeutically relevant could prove their efficacy in current studies which again shows that historical sources may exert some reliability. The study, however, unveiled a couple of plants reported as traditionally used, but neglected by modern science so far. These, including Marrubium supinum, Cynoglossum pictum (= C. creticum), Sonchus maritimus, and two Erodium species, are strongly recommended to be further studied. Foresightedly, this approach was already intended by Hilton-Simpson himself.\n\nCortisol and somatization.\n\nPubMed\n\nRief, W; Auer, C\n\n2000-05-01\n\nSomatization symptoms are frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and feelings of distress. These features interact with the activity of the HPA-axis. Therefore we investigated relationships between somatization symptoms and cortisol. Seventy-seven participants were classified into three groups: somatization syndrome (at least eight physical symptoms from the DSM-IV somatization disorder list), somatization syndrome combined with major depression, and healthy controls. The following data were collected: salivary cortisol at three time points (morning, afternoon, evening), nighttime urinary cortisol, serum cortisol after the dexamethasone suppression test (DST), and psychological variables such as depression, anxiety, somatization, and hypochondriasis. Salivary cortisol showed typical diurnal variations. However, the groups did not differ on any of the cortisol variables. A possible explanation may be counteracting effects of somatization and depression. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that associations between cortisol and psychopathological variables were time-dependent. DST results correlated with psychological aspects of somatization, but not with the number of somatoform symptoms per se.\n\nVisualizing Statistical Mix Effects and Simpson's Paradox.\n\nPubMed\n\nArmstrong, Zan; Wattenberg, Martin\n\n2014-12-01\n\nWe discuss how \"mix effects\" can surprise users of visualizations and potentially lead them to incorrect conclusions. This statistical issue (also known as \"omitted variable bias\" or, in extreme cases, as \"Simpson's paradox\") is widespread and can affect any visualization in which the quantity of interest is an aggregated value such as a weighted sum or average. Our first contribution is to document how mix effects can be a serious issue for visualizations, and we analyze how mix effects can cause problems in a variety of popular visualization techniques, from bar charts to treemaps. Our second contribution is a new technique, the \"comet chart,\" that is meant to ameliorate some of these issues.\n\nSerializing Racial Subjects: The Stagnation and Suspense of the O. J.

Such simulations may involve large spin systems, multiple-parameter fitting of experimental spectra, or multiple-pulse experiment design using parameter scan, non-linear optimization, or optimal control procedures. To efficiently accommodate such simulations, we here present an improved version of the widely distributed open-source SIMPSON NMR simulation software package adapted to contemporary high performance hardware setups. The software is optimized for fast performance on standard stand-alone computers, multi-core processors, and large clusters of identical nodes. We describe the novel features for fast computation including internal matrix manipulations, propagator setups and acquisition strategies. For efficient calculation of powder averages, we implemented interpolation method of Alderman, Solum, and Grant, as well as recently introduced fast Wigner transform interpolation technique. The potential of the optimal control toolbox is greatly enhanced by higher precision gradients in combination with the efficient optimization algorithm known as limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno. In addition, advanced parallelization can be used in all types of calculations, providing significant time reductions. SIMPSON is thus reflecting current knowledge in the field of numerical simulations of solid-state NMR experiments. The efficiency and novel features are demonstrated on the representative simulations. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Both groups showed a qualitatively similar pattern of psychopathological comorbidity and had elevated scores on measures of depression, hypochondriasis, and anxiety. A good discrimination between mild and severe forms of somatization was found by using the SSI criterion. SSI use accounted for a substantial amount of comorbidity variance, with rates of 15%-20% for depression, 16% for hypochondriasis, and 13% for anxiety. The results provide further evidence for the validity of the SSI concept, which reflects the clinical relevance of somatization in addition to the narrow definition of somatization disorder.\n\nGeochemical Investigation of the Arbuckle-Simpson Aquifer, South-Central Oklahoma, 2004-06\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nChristenson, Scott; Hunt, Andrew G.; Parkhurst, David L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA geochemical reconnaissance investigation of the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer in south-central Oklahoma was initiated in 2004 to characterize the ground-water quality at an aquifer scale, to describe the chemical evolution of ground water as it flows from recharge areas to discharge in wells and springs, and to determine the residence time of ground water in the aquifer. Thirty-six water samples were collected from 32 wells and springs distributed across the aquifer for chemical analysis of major ions, trace elements, isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, dissolved gases, and age-dating tracers. In general, the waters from wells and springs in the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer are chemically suitable for all regulated uses, such as public supplies. Dissolved solids concentrations are low, with a median of 347 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Two domestic wells produced water with nitrate concentrations that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's nitrate maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg/L. Samples from two wells in the confined part of the aquifer exceeded the secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) for chloride of 250 mg/L and the SMCL of 500 mg/L for dissolved solids. Water samples from these two wells are not representative of water samples from the other wells and springs completed in the unconfined part of the aquifer. No other water samples from the Arbuckle-Simpson geochemical reconnaissance exceeded MCLs or SMCLs, although not every chemical constituent for which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established a MCL or SMCL was analyzed as part of the Arbuckle-Simpson geochemical investigation. The major ion chemistry of 34 of the 36 samples indicates the water is a calcium bicarbonate or calcium magnesium bicarbonate water type. Calcium bicarbonate water type is found in the western part of the aquifer, which is predominantly limestone. Calcium magnesium bicarbonate water is found in the eastern part of the aquifer, which is predominantly a\n\nIs somatic comorbidity associated with more somatic symptoms, mental distress, or unhealthy lifestyle in elderly cancer survivors?\n\nPubMed\n\nGrov, Ellen Karine; FossÃ¥, Sophie D; Dahl, Alv A\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThe associations of lifestyle factors, somatic symptoms, mental distress, and somatic comorbidity in elderly cancer survivors have not been well studied. This study examines these associations among elderly cancer survivors (age >or=65 years) in a population-based sample. A cross-sectional comparative study of Norwegian elderly cancer survivors. Combining information from The Norwegian Cancer Registry, and by self-reporting, 972 elderly cancer survivors were identified, of whom 632 (65%) had somatic comorbidity and 340 did not. Elderly cancer survivors with somatic comorbidity had significantly higher BMI, more performed minimal physical activity, had more somatic symptoms, used more medication, and had more frequently seen a medical doctor than survivors without somatic comorbidity. In multivariable analyses, unhealthy lifestyle and higher somatic symptoms scores were significantly associated with cancer cases with somatic comorbidity. In univariate analyses those with somatic comorbidity were significantly older, had lower levels of education, higher proportions of BMI >or= 30, less physical activity, poorer self-rated health, higher somatic symptoms score, more mental distress, had more frequently seen a medical doctor last year, and more frequently used daily medication. Our outcome measures of lifestyle, somatic symptoms and mental distress were all significantly associated with somatic comorbidity in elderly cancer survivors, however only lifestyle and somatic symptoms were significant in multivariable analyses. In elderly cancer survivors not only cancer, but also somatic comorbidity, deserve attention. Such comorbidity is associated with unhealthy lifestyles, more somatic symptoms and mental distress which should be evaluated and eventually treated.\n\nResearch on Somatization and Somatic Symptom Disorders: Ars longa, vita brevis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDimsdale, Joel E\n\nThe new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition defines somatic symptom and related disorders as long-standing somatic symptoms that are associated with disproportionate thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, irrespective of whether or not a medical cause for these symptoms can be determined.

C., on 4 March 2010, just a few weeks short of her 87th birthday. She was a longtime member and Fellow (1994) of AGU and a world-renowned atmospheric scientist. She began her research career at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and continued at such distinguished institutions as University of California, Los Angeles; the Experimental Meteorology Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in Miami, Fla.; University of Virginia, Charlottesville; and finally as chief scientist for meteorology at NASA Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres, Greenbelt, Md. Joanne was born in Boston, Mass., and as a result of her early exposure to the ocean and atmosphere and her love for sailing and flying, she began her undergraduate work at University of Chicago in astrophysics. The advent of World War II, however, drew her into training programs in meteorology and ultimately to graduate degrees in meteorology under Carl Rossby (M.S.), and Herbert Riehl (Ph.D.). In 1949 she became the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in meteorology. These early interests focused her attention on the disparate time and space scales of motion that connect and distribute the Sun's energy to power the Earth's atmosphere. In her early research with Riehl, Joanne saw deep penetrating clouds as the conduits or âhot towersâ that connect the surface to the high atmosphere. These clouds represented the âfireboxâ of the atmospheric heat engine and coupled the tropics to the poles.\n\nSimpson's Paradox and Confounding Factors in University Rankings: A Demonstration Using QS 2011-12 Data\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSoh, Kay Cheng\n\n2012-01-01\n\nUniversity ranking has become ritualistic in higher education.

Higher somatization scores in mothers and fathers were associated with higher somatization scores in RAP patients, but not in organic or well patients. Contrary to the findings of Ernst, Routh, and Harper (1984), chronicity of abdominal pain in RAP patients was not significantly associated with their level of somatization symptoms.

A recent proposal was made by rapidly expanding municipalities in central Oklahoma to begin transferring groundwater from the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer, a sensitive sole-source aquifer in south-central Oklahoma. Concerned citizens and municipalities living on and getting their drinking water from the Arbuckle-Simpson lobbied the legislature to pass a temporary moratorium on groundwater transfer to allow for a comprehensive study of the aquifer and its ecosystems. We conducted an instream flow assessment using Physical Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) on springs and streams with four spring-dependent species: two minnows, southern redbelly dace (Phoxinus erthyrogaster) and redspot chub (Nocomis asper); and two darters, least darter (Etheostoma microperca) and orangethroat darter (Etheostoma spectabile). Spring habitats are unique compared to other river habitats because they have constant flow and temperature, small and isolated habitat patches, and a general lack of predators. Our"
