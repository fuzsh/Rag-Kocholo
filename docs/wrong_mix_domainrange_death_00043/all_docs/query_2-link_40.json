Clinical Staging with the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) Shows a Remarkably Uniform Pattern of Temporal Change Over 2 Years in Healthy Older Persons with Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI) in Accord with Prior Estimates and Observations Indicating a Stage of 15 Years Duration\n\nBarry Reisberg*, Carol Torossian, Francoise Guillo-Ben Arous, Isabel Monteiro, Melanie Shulman, Ricardo Osorio, Khurram Janjua, Umang Shah, Romi Shah, Maria Cuartero-Toledo, Amandeep Bhandal, Tanzeel Shah, Sandra Veigne, Jinfeng Xu\n\nFisher Alzheimer's Program & Clinical Core/New York University Alzheimer's Center, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: There is increasing recognition that clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begin many years, even decades, prior to the onset of manifest mild dementia. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (Reisberg, et al., Am J Psychiatry, 1982) identifies 3 pre-dementia stages. The first of these (GDS stage 3) is a stage of subtle, but observable, cognitive deficits. The terminology “Mild Cognitive Impairment,” (MCI) was coined for this GDS 3 stage in 1988 (Reisberg, et al., Drug Dev Res, 1988), and this entity has subsequently been widely studied. We initially estimated that the MCI stage lasts a mean of ∼7 years prior to the advent of the mild dementia of AD (Reisberg, Geriatrics, 1986). Subsequent studies in memory clinic populations have supported this temporal estimate (see Bruscoli and Lovestone, Int Psychogeriatr, 2004, for a review). The GDS also identifies a second pre-dementia stage, the pre-MCI stage in which older persons have subjective symptoms of cognitive deficit only and perform normally on psychometric and other measures. This GDS 2 stage is defined succinctly with the scale as: “Subjective complaints of memory deficit, most frequently in the following areas: (a) forgetting where one has placed familiar objects; (b) forgetting names one formerly knew well.” The scale also notes that in this GDS 2 stage there is, “no objective evidence of memory deficit on clinical interview,” and “no objective deficit in employment or social situations.” It is also noted that there is “appropriate concern with respect to symptomology.” We suggested the terminology “Subjective Cognitive Impairment,” (SCI) for this GDS 2 stage and estimated in 1986 that it lasts a mean of ∼15 years prior to the onset of MCI (Reisberg, Geriatrics, 1986). An 8.9 year longitudinal study in healthy subjects at baseline strongly supported this temporal estimate (Prichep, et al., Neurobiol Aging, 2006; Reisberg and Gauthier, Int Psychogeriatr, 2008). Assuming a uniformly distributed baseline subject population, and a stage lasting precisely 15 years, with uniform progression rates within the stage, then 6.667% of subjects should progress annually to MCI or dementia. On an annual basis, the difference between the 1986 estimated rate of progression and the observed percentage of subjects who advanced was only 0.23% per annum. In another investigation, a 7 year longitudinal study in healthy older persons at baseline, it was found that the hazard ratio for decline was 4.5 for SCI persons in comparison with matched GDS stage 1 persons with No Cognitive Impairment (NCI), the third pre-dementia stage (Reisberg, et al., Alzheimers Dement, 2010). This 4.5 hazard ratio was obtained after controlling for baseline demographic variables and follow-up time. Herein, we report changes in SCI (GDS stage 2) persons over a 2 year interval, a time interval of relevance for future pharmacologic trials endeavoring to slow cognitive deterioration in SCI persons.\n\nMethods: Healthy subjects with SCI (GDS stage 2) from our published 7 year longitudinal study, with follow-ups between 1.5 and 3.0 years were selected. This resulted in a 98 subject cohort followed over 2.13 ± 0.30 years (63 women, 35 men). Baseline subject characteristics included a mean age of 67.12 ± 8.75 years (range 40 to 87 years) and a mean of 15.55 ± 2.60 years of formal education (range 8 to 21 years). The mean baseline Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE, Folstein, et al., J Psychiatr Res, 1975) score was 28.92 ± 1.23 (range 25 to 30). To calculate the change in GDS stage, the following a priori assumptions were posited: (1) a reversion to a prior stage (i.e., improvement to NCI) = -1; (2) no stage change = 0; and (3) progression to MCI or dementia = +1.\n\nResults: The Wilcoxon test was used for all analyses. The GDS stage changed from 2.00 at baseline to a mean of 2.16 ± 0.59 at follow-up (P < 0.01). More specifically, at follow-up, 8 subjects (8.16%) remitted to a GDS stage of 1 (NCI), 68 subjects (69.39%) remained at GDS stage 2 (SCI), 20 subjects (20.41%) declined to GDS stage 3 (MCI), and 2 subjects (2.04%) had mild dementia at follow-up. Using the methodology described above, for a uniformly distributed baseline population, the estimated annual progression rate for a stage lasting precisely 15 years (i.e., 6.667% of subjects progressing to MCI or dementia per annum), and the observed annual progression rate of GDS stage 2 subjects of 6.707%, differed by only 0.04%. Subject age was strongly positively associated with GDS change (P = 0.002). There was no association between subject gender or years of education and the GDS stage at follow-up in this predominantly well-educated cohort. After adjusting for baseline subject age, GDS progression at follow-up remained significant (P < 0.01).\n\nConclusions: In this healthy subject population with SCI, the GDS scale identifies a subject population which progresses at a remarkably consistent rate of ∼6.67% per annum towards MCI or, in a few cases, dementia, over a 2 year period. These results are consistent with our prior 8.9 year published longitudinal study findings. They are also consistent with a recent meta-analysis of 11 studies (including 2 of ours), of “older people with subjective memory complaints” which found an annual conversion rate to MCI of 6.67% (95% CI = 4.70 – 8.95%) (Mitchell, et al., Acta Psychiatr Scand, 2014). These results are of immediate relevance for the selection of both subject populations and outcome measures for pharmacologic and other prevention trials which are being undertaken in efforts to prevent decline in the pre-MCI, SCI stage of eventual AD.\n\nKeywords: Subjective Cognitive Impairment, Prevention of Alzheimer's disease, Global Deterioration Scale, Treatment Outcome Prediction, Preclinical Trial Methodology\n\nDisclosures: I am the author and copyright holder of the assessment measure which is described in this research study.

Cognitive Aging and the Anterior Cingulate: Amyloid and Vascular Risk Factors\n\nJose V. Pardo*, Joel T. Lee\n\nUniversity of Minnesota / VA Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States\n\nBackground: The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays important roles in attention and memory. It is the principal locus of brain activation during the conflict condition of the Stroop color/word test and is the principal locus of declining metabolism during normal aging. ACC hypometabolism, detectable by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), correlates with age-associated decline in executive function, e.g., verbal fluency (Pardo et al. 2007. Neuroimage 35:1231). ACC hypometabolism cannot be completely accounted for by loss of grey matter (Vaidya et al. 2007. Neuroimage 37:1346); in fact, some studies suggest the ACC remains unchanged or even hypertrophies with age. ACC hypometabolism occurs at least by age 40 years. In contrast, hypometabolism is first seen in FDG PET scans of patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; Minoshima et al. 1994. Lancet 344:895) and begins typically after 65 years of age. There is evidence that declining executive function (e.g., Stroop errors) predicts those healthy elders that will convert to MCI/AD 12 years later (Balota et al 2010). Stroop errors are also correlated with declining functional connectivity in the ACC within the salience resting state network (Duchek 2013. Neuropsychology 27:516). This relationship is not modified by the level of CSF abeta42, suggesting amyloid deposition is not driving these correlations. This study revisits ACC function in normal aging and explores potential mechanisms of its dysfunction.\n\nMethods: Data were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) at the LONI archive. Protocols and procedures are detailed on the ADNI website. Older healthy adults (> 55 years) were of principal interest. Data included demographics, rating scales, neuropsychological test results, MRI, and FDG and amyloid PET scans. Because data were examined semiquantitatively (relative to a constant factor), the effects of various normalization parameters were analyzed. Subsets of subjects were sorted based on years of follow-up, amyloid positivity, and vascular risk factors (Hachinski score = 0; H0). Voxel-wise correlations between a parameter and age were calculated. Thresholds were adjusted based on the number of resels. Neurostat (courtesy Satoshi Minsohima, U. Washington) was used on the ADNI data to replicate previous work (Pardo et al 2007). New analyses on the ADNI data used FSL (Oxford) and Freesurfer (MGH).\n\nResults: The previously reported results (Pardo et al 2007) were replicated with the normative ADNI dataset. In particular, the correlation of glucose uptake (whole brain normalization) and age was significantly negative in the ACC [Talairach (3,17,36)]: all normals, r = -0.50, r2 = 0.255, t2(209) = -8.43, p = 0.0; for normals @ 2 year follow-up with H0: r = -0.66, r2 = 0.44, t2(29) = -4.79, p < 4E-5. For all patient subgroups, the correlation of amyloid deposition (cerebellar normalization) with age in the ACC was not significant: all normals, r = 0.048, r2 = 0.002, t2(209) = 0.69, p < 0.48. The large region of age-associated ACC hypometabolism persists even after selecting for only those without vascular risk factors or amyloid deposition.\n\nConclusions: The principal locus of hypometabolism with normal aging localizes to the ACC confirming with the large ADNI dataset previous reports. These analyses provide evidence against two prominent hypotheses regarding age-associated ACC dysfunction: amyloid deposition and vascular disease. Further research is underway examining FLAIR data to probe vascular disease as a possible etiology. At this time, the pathophysiology of age-associated ACC dysfunction and its relation to AD remain to be clarified.\n\nKeywords: anterior cingulate cortex, Amyloid, executive function, cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease\n\nDisclosures: None.

Sex-dependent Modulation of Age-related Cognitive Decline by the L-type Calcium Channel Gene Cacna1c (Cav1.2)\n\nPanos Zanos*, Shambhu Bhat, Chantelle Terrillion, Robert Smith, Leonardo Tonelli, Todd Gould\n\nUniversity of Maryland Medical School, Baltimore, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Evidence correlates increased calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCC) to underlie age-related memory declines. The L-VGCC family consists of four distinct channels referred to as Cav1.1-Cav1.4. While Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 are the most prevalent L-VGCCs in the rodent brain, Cav1.2 accounts for about 80% of these channels. In the present study we sought to assess the specific role of Cacna1c (which encodes Cav1.2) in the regulation of age-related memory dysfunction.\n\nMethods: Short-term, spatial, and contextual/emotional memory was evaluated in young (4-5 months) and aged (17-18 months), wild-type as well as mice with one functional copy of Cacna1c (haploinsufficient), using the novel object recognition, Y-maze, and passive avoidance tasks respectively. Hippocampal expression of Cacna1c mRNA was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).\n\nResults: Aging was associated with object recognition and contextual/emotional memory deficits and a significant increase in hippocampal Cacna1c mRNA expression. Cacna1c haploinsufficient young and aged mice had decreased Cacna1c mRNA expression, as well as an absence of age-related increases in expression of this gene. Behaviorally, Cacna1c haploinsufficiency prevented object recognition deficits during aging in both male and female mice. A significant correlation between higher Cacna1c levels and decreased object recognition performance was observed in both sexes and within groups. A sex-dependent protective role of decreased Cacna1c levels in contextual/emotional memory loss, specifically in male mice, was observed.\n\nConclusions: These data provide further evidence for an association between increased hippocampal Cacna1c expression and age-related cognitive decline. Additionally, they indicate an interaction between the Cacna1c gene and sex in the modulation of age-related contextual memory declines.\n\nKeywords: Aging, Cognition, Memory, Sex differences, CACNA1C\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT4. Tryptophan 2,3-Dioxygenase Gene Prolongs Preimaginal Development in Vermilion Drosophila Melanogaster Mutants: Implications for Aging-associated Neurodegenerative Disorders and Aging\n\nGregory Oxenkrug*, Valeriya Navrotskaya, Paul Summergrad\n\nTufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Up-regulation of kynurenine (KYN) pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism was suggested as one of the mechanisms of aging and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders (AAND)[1]. The rate-limiting enzyme of TRP conversion into KYN, TRP 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), is an evolutionarily conserved ortholog of human TDO. In insects TDO is encoded by a Vermilion gene. TDO activity is impaired in Vermilion mutants of Drosophila melanogaster. We observed prolongation of life span of TDO deficient vermilion mutants [2]. There are four distinct stages in the life of Drosophila melanogaster: egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Considering that TDO becomes active during larvae stage and that longevity genes might impact the speed of preimaginal development in Drosophila, we aimed to evaluate preimaginal development of vermilion mutants.\n\nMethods: We compared the length of larvae stage (time of emergency of pupae from larvae) and body weight of vermilion mutants and wild type (Oregon) flies.\n\nResults: Time of emergency of pupae from larvae was longer (176.5+27.42 hrs) and body weight of imago was higher (10.7+0.58 mg) in vermilion mutants in comparison with wild-type Oregon flies (151.2+27.41 hrs and 9.9+0.58 mg, p<0.002).\n\nConclusions: Present finding of prolongation of larvae stage and our previous reports of prolonged life span of vermilion mutants suggest that the impact of TDO gene on adult life span begins during preimaginal period. TDO-deficiency–induced increased levels of upstream KYN metabolite, TRP, and decreased levels of downstream KYN metabolites might contribute to antiaging and neuroprotective effects of down-regulation of TRP – KYN metabolism reported in drosophila, yeasts, worms and mammals. Modulation of TDO activity might be a new target of prevention and treatment of AAND\n\nKeywords: kynurenine, aging, development\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.

Anxiety Disorders Underlie the Familial Transmission of Suicide Attempts\n\nElizabeth Ballard*, Lihong Cui, Rodrigo Machado-Vieira, Carlos Zarate, Kathleen Merikangas\n\nNational Institute of Mental Heath, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Although there is abundant evidence that suicidal behavior is familial, the specific mechanisms of transmission are complex. Investigation of familial patterns of suicidal behavior may highlight specific social and biologic correlates of suicide risk as well as inform prevention approaches for individuals at high familial risk for suicide. The objective of this analysis was to investigate patterns of familial transmission of suicide attempts and psychopathological correlates in a clinically enriched community sample of probands and their first-degree relatives.\n\nMethods: The sample included a total of directly interviewed 474 probands and 565 first-degree relatives who were characterized for the full range of mental disorders based on semi-structured diagnostic interviews and family history information using best estimate diagnostic procedures. The primary outcome was a lifetime suicide attempt either self-reported by the proband, or reported by a first degree relative of the index participant. Temperament and personality characteristics, including positive and negative affect, impulsivity and aggression were also evaluated by standard self-reported assessments in probands and their relatives.\n\nResults: Of the 474 probands, 64 (14%) had made a lifetime suicide attempt. Though not significant, unadjusted analyses indicated that there was a three-fold greater rate of suicide attempts in the adult first-degree relatives of probands with a lifetime history of suicide attempt compared to those without such a history. Mixed effects logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex and comorbid mood and anxiety yielded significant within-individual association between suicide attempts and Bipolar I disorder. Familial transmission of lifetime suicide attempts was primarily attributable to proband anxiety disorder disorders, specifically Panic Disorder, GAD and Social Phobia, rather than mood disorders. A significant association was found between negative affectivity and suicide attempts in relatives when controlling for the proband negative affect and relative age and sex.\n\nConclusions: Findings confirm the association between anxiety and suicide attempts from previous community and family studies, and suggest that anxiety disorders may be important components of the familial diathesis underlying suicidal behavior. Results underscore the importance of future research on the neurobiology of anxiety in the development and maintenance of suicide risk. Familial anxiety disorders, along with an individual history of Bipolar I disorder, may serve as important targets for suicide prevention.\n\nKeywords: suicide, epidemiology, familial risk\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT6. Sexually Divergent Expression of Active and Passive Conditioned Fear Responses\n\nTina Gruene, Katelyn Flick, Alexis Stefano, Stephen Shea, Rebecca Shansky*\n\nNortheastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: In Pavlovian fear conditioning, successful associative learning is traditionally measured by assessing time spent freezing to the conditioned stimulus, but the possibility that animals may engage active fear behaviors as well is rarely considered. In particular, it is not known whether males and females employ identical response strategies as learning occurs, an omission that could lead to misinterpretation of sex-dependent outcomes.\n\nMethods: We evaluated locomotor activity in videos of gonadally intact adult male (n=56) and female (n=58) Sprague Dawley rats as they were trained and tested in auditory fear conditioning (5 habituation CS followed by 7 CS-US pairs), extinction (20 CS), and extinction retention (3 CS) across 3 days. In some animals, we observed a rapid “darting” behavior during fear conditioning that suggested an escape-like response. To quantify these responses, we used Ethovision software to record each animal’s velocity across all sessions, and calculated darting rates in both males and females.\n\nResults: Females were 4 times as likely as males to exhibit darting behavior in response to the conditioned stimulus. In females only, darting frequency increased with CS-US pair presentations and was correlated with shock response velocity. Darting during fear conditioning corresponded to reduced freezing across fear conditioning, extinction, and extinction retrieval tests.\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that females employ multiple response strategies in the expression of learned fear. Importantly, the expression of active darting responses does not simply compete with freezing, but appears to induce lasting changes in freezing behavior, even in the absence of darting itself. Overall, our findings have major implications for the interpretation of fear conditioning and extinction studies, suggesting that freezing alone may not be a complete measure of learned fear in female subjects.\n\nKeywords: Sex differences, Fear conditioning, Fear extinction, individual differences\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT7. Genetic Predictors of Dysmaturation of the Brain’s Intrinsic Network Architecture: Relation to ADHD and Attention Dysfunction\n\nChandra Sripada*, Yu Fang, Srijan Sen, Michael Angstadt, Daniel Kessler\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nBackground: The human brain is organized into several large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), which exhibit massive maturation from childhood to young adulthood. There is mounting evidence that the maturational trajectories of ICNs are perturbed in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with alterations in these ICNs playing a central pathophysiological role in the attention deficits seen in the disorder. ADHD is highly heritable (roughly 76% heritability), and this raises an intriguing hypothesis that specific genes are predictive of the disrupted patterns of ICN maturation reliably found in ADHD.\n\nMethods: Participants (n=519, ages 8.6-22.6) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) underwent 5.2-minute resting state scans, and cross-correlation matrices (\"connectomes\") were produced from 1068 ROIs, with motion scrubbing and second-level regression used to minimize motion artifact (verified by inspection of QC-RSFC plots). In previous studies, we linked dysmaturation of the connectome to attention dysfunction using a novel “network growth charting” methodology. In brief, we first produced maturational growth charts for six major components of the connectome (which we labeled “A” through “F”) using joint independent component analysis, an unsupervised machine learning method. For each subject, we calculated “maturational deviation scores” that reflect differences in expression of the six connectomic components relative to the neurotypical profile. We showed that downward scores—reflecting underexpression of components relative to age—are robust predictors of worse attention functioning [F(6, 512) = 26.89, p < 2.2 * 10e-16; R2 = 0.2396]. In the present study, we used genome-wide association data for these same participants from the PNC dataset. Analysis was restricted to three of the six platforms (Human610_Quadv1_B, HumanHap550v3.0, and HumanOmniExpress; all from Illumina) representing 92% (n=481) of the participants. The genomic data was recoded, quality checked, and filtered (variant missing call rate < 0.05, sample missing call rate < 0.1, minor allele frequency > 0.005, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium exact test p-value < 10e-6), yielding 476 subjects included in the analysis set. The data was then phased by SHAPEIT and imputed by minimac3 through the Michigan Imputation Server with the reference panel 1000G Phase3 v5. A genome-wide association analysis was next conducted with EPACTS on the imputed dosage data. Quantitative score tests were used to identify genes that predict relative underexpression of connectomic components relative to age (i.e., the component-specific maturational deviation scores calculated in the previous paragraph). Age and sex were added as covariates, as well as the top 10 principle components to account for population stratification.\n\nResults: In preliminary analysis, 45 loci reached the genome-wide significance threshold (p < 5 * 10e-8). Loci that predicted underexpression of components B, E, and F were particularly common. Component B involves interconnections between default mode network (involved in internally-directed mentation and mind wandering) and frontoparietal network (involved in cognitive control and executive functions). Component E involves connections between visual network and major regulatory networks, in particular frontoparietal network and ventral attention network. Component F involves connections linking “ventral stream” language regions in superior and middle temporal gyrus. Gene network analyses are currently being undertaken to identify families of genes overrepresented among the significant loci.\n\nConclusions: In our previous studies, we used “network growth charting” methodology to show that: (1) ADHD involves disrupted patterns of maturation of major components of the functional connectome; and (2) Underexpression of these components relative to age robustly predicts worse attention performance. In this study, we link dysmaturation of the brain’s network architecture to genes. In particular, we provide first time evidence of numerous genetic loci that directly predict underexpression relative to age of major components of the functional connectome. It is notable that despite the high heritability of ADHD, previous studies failed to find loci predictive of ADHD at genome-wide significance thresholds. Dysmaturation of specific components of the functional connectome might thus constitute a more homogenous, and thus more readily detectible, intermediate phenotype for the purposes of genetic investigations. More broadly, the novel “network growth charting” methodology used in this study could potentially be fruitfully applied to identify candidate genes for other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, that are known to involve neurodevelopmental network disturbances.\n\nKeywords: Large Scale Networks, ADHD, neurodevelopment, fMRI/imaging genetics\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT8. Integrative Systems Analysis Associates Blood Glucocorticoid Receptor Dependent Immune Response with PTSD Diagnosis and Treatment Response\n\nNikolaos Daskalakis*, Hagit Cohen, Rasha Hammamieh, Janine Flory, Marti Jett, Charles Marmar, Joseph Buxbaum, Bin Zhang, Rachel Yehuda\n\nMount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Delineating the molecular basis of individual differences in the stress response is critical to understand the pathophysiology of post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD), with the ultimate goal of identifying biomarkers that predict recovery from PTSD and associate with treatment response to psychotherapy.\n\nMethods: Data: Blood molecular data (expression arrays and RNA-seq) and functional endocrine data will be presented from a cross-sectional biomarker study (n=68 with PTSD, n=68 without PTSD) and a longitudinal psychotherapy trial (n=50) in combat veterans with PTSD. In addition, gene expression data in blood and brain (amygdala and hippocampus) of a PTSD rat model will be presented, in which resilient and vulnerable phenotypes are identified according to the long-term behavioral response to predator scent stress (PSS).\n\nAnalyses: Analyses of the human and animal data were performed separately, and then compared and integrated with the use of gene network analyses: (a) differential gene expression; (b) weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA); (c) comparative network analysis; (d) module-trait correlations; and (e) key driver analysis.\n\nResults: Differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified in blood of veterans with PTSD in comparison with veterans without PTSD. DE genes associated with PTSD were consistent with downregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-signaling and upregulation of proinflammatory signaling. These findings were replicated by the DE-signatures identified in rat blood and brain, in association with exposure-related individual differences. Interestingly, even though the across-tissue overlap in rat DE-signatures was small at the individual gene level (6%), there was a high conservation at the upstream transcription factor (TF) or cytokine level (36% and 63%, respectively).\n\nGene co-expression networks were also identified. Among the most promising networks, there was a large (>100 genes) PTSD co-expression module showing a high level of dysregulation (compared to controls modular differential connectivity >50) and conservation in the blood and brain of PTSD-like rats. Functionally, this module is associated with innate immune response (p<0.001), and correlated with plasma cortisol decline in dexamethasone suppression test (p<0.001) and the lymphocyte lysozyme inhibition (p<0.05) by dexamethasone. Identified DE genes, pathways and networks predicted treatment response. Several key network drivers changed over time in association with treatment response in both combat veterans with PTSD. Finally, GR agonist administration in rats shortly after PSS prevented PTSD-like phenotypes by reversing the vulnerability-associated transcription patterns.\n\nConclusions: We identified genes, pathways and gene co-expression networks in the blood of combat veterans with PTSD and key network drivers’ activity changes over time in association with treatment response. Blood-based biomarkers can predict aspects of brain signaling. GR-dependent immune pathways are associated with trauma-related individual differences in blood and brain, and can be the basis of treatment strategies for PTSD.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, biomarkers, gene expression, animal model, humans\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT9. Methylphenidate Decreases Anxiety-Induced Impairment of Working Memory Performance in Healthy Subjects\n\nMonique Ernst*, Andrew Davis, Christian Grillon\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: A large literature documents the influence of anxiety on cognition, and reciprocally the influence of cognition on anxiety- the latter being exploited for the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is well documented that anxiety can impair cognition, and that cognitive strategies can be used to decrease anxiety. For instance, one effective way to reduce anxiety is to immerse oneself in a cognitive task, specifically a difficult or effortful task. Tasks that involve working memory (WM) appear to be especially efficient at down-regulating anxiety, probably because of competition for attentional resources. However, the underlying mechanisms that mediate the interaction between anxiety and cognition remain unclear. This study is a first step towards clarifying this question using a pharmacological approach, through the distinct pharmacological manipulation of either cognitive function via Methylphenidate (MPH), or state anxiety via Propanolol (PRO). Hypotheses are that, compared to placebo (PLA), (1) MPH, a dopamine agonist that improves executive function, will improve memory performance and potentially decrease anxiety, and (2) PRO, a beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent used to reduce physiological arousal, will reduce anxiety and potentially improve performance.\n\nMethods: The basic design of the study involves (1) the within-subjects induction of anxiety through the application of unpredictable electrical shocks, (2) the quantification of anxiety level by using a well-established translational method that provides a physiological measure of anxiety via EMG measures of anxiety-potentiated startle (APS) (Davis et al., 2010; Grillon, 2008), (3) the use of a working memory task (WM: n-back task,1-, 2-, and 3-back), which we have shown to be reliably impaired by induced-anxiety (Vytal et al., 2012; Vytal et al., 2013), and (4) the double-blind administration of either PLA, PRO (40 g) or MPH (20 mg) in a parallel group design. Three groups of 20 healthy participants (N=60 total) completed one experimental session, during which they performed the WM task under the threat of shock (anticipating unpleasant electric shocks) or safety (no shock). Each group received one drug challenge, either PLA, PRO (40 g) or MPH (20 mg). Outcome measures (performance and startle variables) were analyzed using 3-way ANOVAs with Condition (threat, safety) and Load (1-back, 2-back, 3-back) as within-subject factors, and treatment (PLA, MPH, PRO) as a between-subject factor.\n\nResults: Results are presented for WM accuracy and then for APS. Regarding accuracy, overall, the experimental paradigm showed the expected effects of load and condition on performance, i.e., decreased accuracy with higher load and with threat vs. safe. Most important, the 3-way interaction of Condition by Load by Treatment was significant. Two follow-up analyses examined PRO vs. PLA and MPH vs. PLA on accuracy. PRO did not differ from PLA, i.e., PRO did not influence performance differently than PLA under threat (Condition by Load By Treatment: NS). However, MPH influenced performance differently from PLA under threat (Condition by Load By Treatment F(2,76)=5.2, p=.008, GG-ɛ =.90). Specifically, MPH compared to PLA revealed better performance on the 3-back load during threat vs. safe, exhibiting a unique interaction of load by condition. Regarding startle, the analysis of baseline startle (without WM) showed no effects of treatment (Condition by Treatment: NS). Similarly, the analysis of startle during WM showed no effect of treatment (Condition by Load by Treatment: NS). Taken together, these results indicate a unique beneficial effect of MPH on WM accuracy during threat and the most difficult task (3-back), but no effects on anxiety. However, PRO did not influence either the anxiety startle measure or WM performance compared to PLA. Additional analyses on the effects of Treatment on other anxiety measures will also be presented.\n\nConclusions: Findings provide three take-home messages. First, performance under threat was uniquely modulated by MPH, while physiological anxiety was not. This suggests a dissociation of the effects of MPH on the modulation of cognition by threat and on anxiety per se. This needs to be further examined at the neural level to identify potential mechanisms underlying MPH action on cognition and anxiety. Second, in contrast to expectation, PRO did not differ from PLA. Conceivably, a higher dose, like 60 mg, could have been more powerful to detect an effect. Third, this approach to manipulate the interactions between anxiety and cognitive processes is promising and needs to be followed up in 2 ways: one that extends the present findings into neural mechanisms, and the other that tests potentially more effective doses, drug regimens or different drugs.\n\nKeywords: Threat of Shock, Working Memory Capacity, stimulant, anxiety state, propanolol\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT10. DICER1 and MicroRNA Regulation in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n\nAliza Wingo*, Lynn Almli, Jennifer Stevens, Torsten Klengel, Monica Uddin, Yujing Li, Angela Bustamante, Adriana Lori, Nastassja Koen, Dan Stein, Allison Aiello, Alicia Smith, Derek Wildman, Sandro Galea, Karestan Koenen, Bekh Bradley, Elisabeth Binder, Greg Gibson, Peng Jin, Kerry Ressler\n\nEmory University/Atlanta VA Medical Center, Atlanta, Georgia, United States\n\nBackground: Our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying PTSD and depression is still incomplete. PTSD with comorbid depression (referred to as PTSD&Dep from here on) is highly prevalent among susceptible individuals following traumatic life experiences and likely represents an extreme phenotype for PTSD. In this study, we aimed to increase our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD using an extreme phenotype design, since an enrichment of extreme cases and controls in such design can improve our statistical power toward uncovering biological mechanisms.\n\nMethods: Using PTSD&Dep following trauma exposure as an extreme phenotype for PTSD, we surveyed genome-wide differential gene expression profiles in blood in 184 cases of PTSD&Dep and controls with no PTSD and no depression. Our hypothesis was that genes differentially expressed in PTSD&Dep inform biological pathways underlying this psychiatric phenotype. We followed up on our genome-wide gene expression finding of DICER1 with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis and functional imaging study. Moreover, since DICER1 cleaves precursor microRNAs (miRNAs) into mature microRNAs, which regulate expression of thousands of genes post-transcriptionally, we surveyed genome-wide differential expression profiles of miRNAs in blood in a subset of PTSD&Dep cases and controls.\n\nResults: Expression of DICER1 was significantly reduced in cases of PTSD&Dep relative to controls at genome-wide FDR<0.05 (p=7.93E-06, adjusted p=0.040) after gender, age, population substructure were adjusted for, and this finding was replicated in two independent cohorts. Our follow-up studies found a DICER1 eQTL, rs10144436, located in its 3’UTR, significantly associated with PTSD&Dep (OR=1.32, p=0.012, Bonferroni-adjusted p=0.024) and replicated this finding in another cohort. Additionally, we found that lower blood DICER1 expression was significantly associated with increased activation of the amygdala to threat stimuli, a neural correlate of PTSD, in a functional MRI study. Lastly, at genome-wide FDR<0.05, two miRNAs were significantly down regulated in the PTSD&Dep cases compared to controls after sex, age, and population substructure were controlled for: miR-212-3p (p=4.48E-05, adjusted p=0.048) and miR-3130-5p (p=4.97E-05, adjusted p=0.048). Each of these two miRNAs had a target mRNA that was significantly upregulated in PTSD&Dep cases at FDR<0.1 in our original genome-wide differential gene expression analysis.\n\nConclusions: Taken together, our novel data suggest that DICER1 and miRNAs are involved in molecular mechanisms of PTSD&Dep via the DICER1/miRNA regulation pathway. This stress-related DICER1/miRNA regulation in blood is paralleled by published findings of DICER1/miRNA regulation in brain of stressed mice, as mediated by β-catenin. Studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between blood and brain DICER1/miRNA regulation, as well as mechanisms underlying the connection between blood DICER1/miRNA regulation and stress-related psychiatric disorders to contribute to their prevention and treatment efforts.\n\nKeywords: Gene expression, molecular mechanisms, PTSD, MicroRNA, Depression\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT11. Androgen Regulation of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Steroid Receptors in the Noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus (NE LC) of Male Macaques\n\nYelena Belikova, Kenny Phu, Judy Cameron*, Cynthia Bethea\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: The NE LC plays a pivotal role in vigilance in macaques, and it has also been implicated in aggression. Moreover, TH protein expression in the NE LC increases with stress. We questioned the effect of testosterone (T) on TH protein expression and on the expression of androgen receptors (AR) and estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, in the LC of male macaques. T is metabolized to estradiol (E) by action of aromatase; and T is metabolized to an androgen, dihydro-testosterone (DHT), which cannot be acted upon by aromatase. Therefore, treatment with DHT plus an aromatase inhibitor was included to distinguish androgen versus estrogen action. In addition, we questioned whether the steroid receptors were located in NE neurons.\n\nMethods: Castrated male macaques were treated with AR agonists (T, DHT) and an antagonist, flutamide (FLUT), with and without aromatase inhibition (ATD) to manipulate AR and ER activity (n=5/group). Treatments included T, placebo, DHT+ATD and FLUT+ATD for 3 months (n=5/group). Therefore, the brain was expected to have the following receptor activation: +AR+ER; -AR+ER(low); +AR-ER; and -AR-ER, respectively. The placebo group was expected to have low E in the brain from de novo synthesis. Single and double immunohistochemistry for TH, AR, ERα and ERβ was performed on the NE LC of the midbrain in all animals. Photography (Zeiss), image analysis (Image J) and statistical tests (GraphPad) were conducted.\n\nResults: TH immunostaining in the dendritic halo of the LC reflects overall TH synthesis and NE production. The positive pixel area of the TH immunostaining in the NE LC was significantly higher in the T group than in the placebo and FLUT+ATD groups (ANOVA p=0.018; posthoc p<0.05). DHT+ATD was not different from T alone. AR positive pixel area was significantly higher in the T group than in the FLUT+ATD group (ANOVA p=0.016; posthoc p<0.05). AR pixel area was not different between T and DHT+ATD, or between placebo and FLUT+ATD. Neither ERα nor ERβ positive pixel area was different between the groups (no regulation observed). AR positive nuclei were not located in NE neurons. Rather, AR positive nuclei were in neighboring neurons. ERα and ERβ positive nuclei were located within a large percentage of NE neurons in the LC.\n\nConclusions: TH expression was elevated in both T and DHT+ATD groups compared to placebo or FLUT+ATD. This observation indicates that T increased TH expression in the NE LC via AR in the presence or absence of aromatase or E activity. Furthermore, T or DHT+ATD increased expression of AR, indicating androgens act via AR to increase expression of AR in the presence or absence of aromatase or E activity. None of the treatments affected ERα or ERβ expression, suggesting that these receptors may be constitutively expressed in the LC population of NE neurons. Finally, in spite of the marked effects of AR activation on TH and AR expression in the LC, the NE neurons per se lacked AR. Therefore, androgens regulate NE LC neurons indirectly via other AR-positive neurons.\n\nKeywords: testosterone, norepinephrine, estrogen receptor\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT12. Neural Mechanisms of Psychotherapy for PTSD: Emotional Reactivity and Regulation\n\nGregory Fonzo*, Madeleine Goodkind, Desmond Oathes, Yevgeniya Zaiko, Meredith Harvey, Kathy Peng, Elizabeth Weiss, Allison Thompson, Sanno Zack, Bruce Arnow, Barbara Rothbaum, Amit Etkin\n\nStanford University, Stanford, California, United States\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become increasingly prevalent in recent years and is a substantial burden on both an individual and societal level. Trauma-focused exposure therapies such as prolonged exposure (PE) are the most efficacious interventions for the disorder, but our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying their efficacy is nearly nonexistent. This knowledge gap is due partly to a lack of well-controlled imaging studies that facilitate isolation of neural effects related to the therapy itself from those arising from repeated assessments and non-specific changes over time. As trauma-focused psychotherapy is the first-line intervention for PTSD and only a minority of individuals undergoing this treatment will demonstrate clinical remission, it is imperative to characterize the effects of trauma-focused treatments on brain function and how such effects relate to changes in symptomatology. Such studies are ultimately needed to: a) identify neural changes that serve as mechanisms for symptom improvement following psychotherapy; b) parse neural abnormalities that are sensitive to interventions vs. those that are enduring and may reflect risk factors and/or confer treatment resistance; and c) identify relevant brain mechanisms that can be augmented to promote greater efficacy of future novel and/or modified interventions. Here, we report initial results from a two-arm, randomized imaging intervention study in PTSD investigating the mechanisms underlying efficacy of PE therapy. We focused specifically on tasks that capture constructs theoretically relevant to the neuropathophysiology of PTSD as well as exposure-based psychotherapy—emotional reactivity and regulation. As such, we investigated therapeutic effects of PE on prefrontal and limbic brain function using a waitlist (WL) control condition in patients to control for changes in brain function non-specific to treatment.\n\nMethods: Fifty individuals meeting criteria for PTSD were randomized to 9-12 sessions of PE treatment (N=24) or WL (N=26) for a comparable time period. Individuals completed a clinical assessment and battery of functional imaging tasks before and after PE or WL. Here, we focus on an emotional reactivity paradigm (processing of fearful and neutral faces) and an emotion regulation paradigm (cognitive reappraisal and passive processing of negative and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System) to assess therapeutic effects on limbic and prefrontal brain responses. We utilized a repeated-measures framework to isolate group (PE vs. WL) x time interaction effects, i.e. changes across time that were significantly different for PE vs. WL. We also assessed the relationship of putative therapeutic neural changes isolated as above to changes in PTSD symptom dimensions.\n\nResults: Clinically, individuals receiving PE demonstrated significantly better improvement in PTSD symptoms relative to those on WL from pre-to-post time points. On imaging measures, we observed prominent prefrontal changes from pre-to-post treatment that were greater in individuals undergoing PE vs. WL, with no significant treatment-related changes observed in limbic regions implicated in PTSD neurocircuitry models, i.e. amygdala and insula. Prefrontal PE-related changes were characterized by two dissociable processes: 1) decreased recruitment of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during emotional reactivity across two tasks (fear vs. neutral face processing, negative vs. neutral passive IAPS picture viewing); and 2) increased recruitment of the rostral/dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during emotion regulation (reappraisal vs. passive viewing of negative IAPS pictures). Furthermore, within the PE group greater reductions in vmPFC activation to negative vs. neutral passive picture viewing were associated with greater reductions in PTSD re-experiencing symptoms, while greater increases in dorsal/rostral anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal activation to reappraisal vs. passive viewing of negative pictures were associated with greater improvement in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms.\n\nConclusions: Using a well-controlled study design, these findings provide initial evidence that therapeutic mechanisms underlying efficacy of trauma-focused exposure therapies such as PE involve prominent changes in prefrontal circuitry with little-to-no effect on limbic circuitry during emotional reactivity and regulation. Moreover, trauma-focused exposure treatment in PTSD appears to promote greater engagement of prefrontal structures involved in salience signaling and top-down engagement during explicit attempts at regulating emotions while also decreasing ostensibly implicit regulatory processes in ventromedial prefrontal regions during emotional reactivity. Taken together, the current findings provide timely new information regarding mechanisms underlying trauma-focused exposure therapy in PTSD and suggest that the efficacy of such treatments is conveyed mechanistically primarily via strengthening compensatory prefrontal emotional regulatory processes, rather than attenuating exaggerated limbic reactivity.\n\nKeywords: Posttraumatic stress disorder, BOLD imaging, Psychotherapy, emotion processing, emotion regulation\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT13. Acute Methylphenidate Improves Performance on a Change Detection Task: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial in Healthy Males\n\nJonathon Howlett*, He Huang, Murray Stein, Martin Paulus\n\nUniversity of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, United States\n\nBackground: Change detection has been identified as a key cognitive process underlying effective decision making in noisy, volatile environments. Converging evidence indicates that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) signal unexpected environmental change, prompting both allocation of attention to unexpected stimuli and new learning. Recent evidence indicates that individuals with high trait anxiety exhibit impaired change detection and abnormal pupillary responses to unexpected events. Dysfunctional change detection may represent a target for treatments that modulate noradrenergic neurons in the LC. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of pharmacologic manipulation on change detection has not previously been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of methylphenidate (MPH), which inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and modulates LC activity, on change detection in healthy adult males. We hypothesized that MPH would improve both overall performance and learning (improvement in performance across the first block) on a change detection task.\n\nMethods: 19 healthy males were randomized to receive under double-blind conditions either an acute dose of MPH 40 mg (10 subjects) or placebo (9 subjects). Subjects completed a change detection decision making task with 180 total trials across 3 blocks. On each trial, subjects attempted to predict the location of a target stimulus out of 3 possible locations. Stimulus location was determined by a probability distribution in which one location was most likely to contain the target. At random intervals, the most likely target location changed. Performance was calculated based on how often a subject chose the most likely target location. Performance was compared between subjects receiving MPH and placebo using both a t-test and a mixed effects logistic regression model. Learning was also assessed by examining improvement in performance across the first block. Improvement in performance was compared between groups by testing a group-by-time interaction in a mixed effects logistic regression model across the first block.\n\nResults: Subjects receiving MPH chose the most likely stimulus location significantly more often than subjects receiving placebo (p<0.05). Subjects receiving methylphenidate also improved in performance more quickly across the first block (p<0.05).\n\nConclusions: The results suggest that subjects receiving MPH more quickly adjusted to the environmental statistics (volatility) in the task, resulting in improved overall decision making performance. Medications such as MPH which improve change detection performance should be investigated as potential treatments targeting impaired change detection in psychiatric disorders.\n\nKeywords: Decision Making, Methylphenidate, Anxiety\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT14. A Cardiorespiratory Non-Chemosensory Interoceptive Pathway to Panic Anxiety Independent of the Amgydala\n\nSahib Khalsa*, Justin Feinstein, Wei Li, Jamie Feusner, Ralph Adolphs, Rene Hurlemann\n\nLaureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States\n\nBackground: The role of the amygdala in the acquisition, maintenance and extinction of fear learning in animal models is well defined. However, two reports of fear and panic in humans with bilateral amygdala damage have suggested that amygdala dysfunction alone may be insufficient to prevent these aversive emotional experiences in humans. One of these studies demonstrated that inhalation of 35% carbon dioxide (CO2) produced clinically significant panic attacks that included palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, trembling, derealization, and fear of dying. We hypothesized that induction of a subset of these symptoms (principally palpitations and dyspnea) using isoproterenol, a rapidly acting beta adrenergic agonist without the pH altering properties of CO2, would be sufficient to elicit anxiety and panic in a pair of monozygotic twins with bilateral amygdala damage due to Urbach-Wiethe Disease who had previously undergone the CO2 inhalation challenge. We also hypothesized that these patients would demonstrate impaired cardiorespiratory interoceptive awareness of the sensations induced by isoproterenol.\n\nMethods: 2 monozygotic twin sisters with bilateral amygdala damage were compared to two separate groups of healthy comparisons (n = 16 and n = 15). Participants rated their affective and sensory experiences following bolus intravenous infusions of isoproterenol and saline during two conditions: panic provocation, and assessment of cardiorespiratory interoceptive awareness (IA). During the panic provocation condition participants completed a panic symptom rating scale following each of 7 bolus intravenous infusions, administered in a single blinded, fixed order (0.1 mcg, saline, 4 mcg, saline, 1 mcg, 2 mcg, saline). During IA assessment randomized and double blinded infusions of isoproterenol (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mcg) and saline were administered while participants rotated a dial to track their momentary experience of heartbeat and respiratory sensation intensity.\n\nResults: Isoproterenol infusions were sufficient to induce anxiety in both twins with amygdala damage, and panic in one twin. The twin who did not panic displayed impaired IA as evidenced by significantly poorer interoceptive accuracy with the dial t(5) = -3.9, p = .006, attenuated palpitation t(8) = -1.90, p = .047, and attenuated dyspnea ratings t(8) = -1.85, p = .051, all at the highest dose. Furthermore, this twin demonstrated a complete lack of dyspnea sensation across both conditions, suggestive of impaired respiratory interoception. Mean heart rate responses to isoproterenol did not statistically differ between samples at the 2 mcg dose (BG [t(16) = .55, p = .59, AM [t(16) = .79, p = .44) or at the 4 mcg dose (BG [t(16) = 1.61, p = .13], AM [t(16) = -.83, p = .42]).\n\nConclusions: These findings provide further evidence that the amygdala is not required for experience of anxiety and panic in humans, suggesting that additional neural circuits beyond the amygdala must be involved in the observed fear and anxiety responses. They also suggest that damage to the amygdala can impair cardiorespiratory interoceptive awareness. Characterizing the respiratory pathways involved in interoceptive processing and identification of the neural circuits associated with compensatory processing of interoceptive sensations in patients with amygdala damage is warranted.\n\nKeywords: Amygdala, Anxiety, panic, fear, interoception\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT15. Heart Rate Variability Predicts Vulnerability for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Active-Duty Marines\n\nArpi Minassian, Adam Maihofer, Dewleen Baker, Caroline Nievergelt, Mark Geyer, Victoria Risbrough*\n\nUniversity of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States\n\nBackground: Disrupted autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure plays a role in risk for development of PTSD. Here we tested the hypothesis that reduced HRV before trauma exposure may be a risk factor for development of PTSD.\n\nMethods: To test our hypothesis we analyzed HRV data from the Marine Resiliency Study, a prospective, longitudinal study of behavioral and biological risk factors for development of PTSD in Active Duty Marines. After consent, participants were assessed using psychiatric, psychosocial, physical and laboratory measures in a 4 hr assessment period 1-2 months prior to a combat deployment and again three to six months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD post-deployment. The second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD post-deployment. Heart rate was measured via finger plethysmography (1000 Hz) during a five-minute period of rest, and frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. PTSD diagnosis was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Marines were categorized as either not meeting or meeting criteria for PTSD for each of the two time points using CAPS responses (Criteria were derived from the DSM-IV: at least 1 “B” symptom, 3 “C” symptoms, and 2 “D” symptoms. Marines that met PTSD diagnosis at the pre-deployment assessment were not included in the analysis. Combat trauma during deployment was measured via the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory and used as an additional predictor of post-deployment PTSD in the model.\n\nResults: After accounting for deployment-related trauma exposure, lower HRV at pre-deployment as measured by increased low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio predicted the risk of PTSD diagnosis post-deployment (combined MRSI/II cohort meta-analysis odds ratio=1.48, p= 0.01). The pattern of results did not change when controlling for additional factors of deployment history or pre-deployment PTSD symptoms.\n\nConclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that an altered “state” of ANS functioning before trauma may contribute to PTSD vulnerability. If these findings are replicated, interventions that change ANS function in at risk populations such as rescue and military personnel may open new opportunities for treatment and prevention.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, heart rate variability, at-risk, combat, psychophysiology\n\nDisclosures: This work was supported by a grant from Navy BUMED.

Deconstructing Ventral Hippocampal Control of Anxiety-Related Behavior and Learned Fear\n\nJessica Jimenez*, Alexander Goldberg, Gokhan Ordek, Stephanie Pena, Katy Su, Rene Hen, Mazen Kheirbek\n\nCollege of Physicians & Surgeons/Columbia University, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Understanding the distributed neural circuits that mediate normal, adaptive anxiety-related behavior may provide insight into how they may be disrupted in anxiety disorders. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) has become appreciated for its role in anxiety-related behaviors, serving as a circuit hub that connects cognitive association regions with limbic structures that directly regulate mood. Although some studies have observed vHPC activity changes during anxiety-related behaviors, it is still not understood if this activity is specific to innately aversive tasks, if vHPC can directly modulate anxiety behavior, and through which downstream limbic structures these effects on behavior are mediated.\n\nMethods: We have used cell-type specific calcium imaging in vivo in freely behaving mice using miniaturized microscopes to visualize vHPC activity during anxiety-related behaviors. We expressed GCaMP6f in vHPC, and a gradient index lens was implanted above vCA1. We imaged the activity patterns of the same population of vCA1 neurons across multiple behavioral dimensions, including innately anxiogenic tasks (Open Field Test (OFT), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and Elevated Zero Maze (EZM)), innately rewarding tasks (novel object exploration and sucrose pellet consumption), and learned fear tasks (contextual fear conditioning (CFC)). For optogenetic manipulations, we virally expressed Arch or ChR2 opsins in vHPC and implanted a fiber optic either directly in vHPC or at vHPC terminal fields in the Basomedial Amygdala (BMA) or Lateral Hypothalamus (LHA).\n\nResults: In our imaging experiments, we found that vHPC neurons increase their activity in innately anxiogenic environments, including the center of the Open Field test and the open arms of the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Zero Maze, but not to exploration of a novel object. Alternatively, in CFC, re-exposure to a previously conditioned environment decreases activity within vHPC, suggesting a differential processing of learned versus innately fearful environments. To understand how these activity changes are generated within the local vHPC circuit, we imaged calcium activity in local inhibitory interneurons (VGAT+ neurons) and found a reduction in inhibitory interneuron activity in innately anxiogenic environments, such as the open arms of the EPM. This points to a local circuit mechanism by which the vHPC is engaged during exploration of anxiogenic environments. To understand how the vHPC may modulate anxiety-related behavior, we employed optogenetic techniques within vHPC and at downstream terminal fields in two subcortical nuclei implicated in anxiety, fear, and behavioral responses to stress, the BMA and LHA. Our results indicate that direct vHPC silencing disrupts the formation of a contextual fear memory. Further, modulation of vHPC-LHA terminals impacts innate anxiety and aversion, but not contextual fear conditioning, while vHPC-BMA terminal modulation impacts contextual fear memory but not innate anxiety behavior. Ongoing studies are aimed at understanding the interplay between behavioral state and activity within vHPC, utilizing pharmacological and behavioral manipulations to modulate anxiety levels of mice during exploration of the EZM while recording local population dynamics.\n\nConclusions: Our findings demonstrate a unique population-level activity signature for anxiogenic environments within vHPC. Further, the varying activity changes between innate and learned fear behaviors suggest diverse circuit mechanisms for processing exploration of an innately anxiogenic environment and previously conditioned fearful environments. Our results also reveal a potential circuit mechanism for increased population activity during innate anxiety behaviors, possibly through disinhibition of the local vCA1 circuit. The specificity of vHPC-LHA and vHPC-BMA terminal modulation effects on innate and learned fear behavior suggests a projection specific segregation in vHPC function, possibly mediated through projection-specific cell populations within the vHPC. This study provides a functional map of the cell-types and long-range circuits that underlie the vHPC contribution to innate and learned anxiety-related behavior.\n\nKeywords: ventral hippocampus, calcium imaging, anxiety disorders, amygdala, hypothalamus\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT17. Attention Bias Modification Alters Amygdala-Cortical Functional Connectivity\n\nJennifer C. Britton*, Travis C. Evans, Nathan A. Fox, Daniel S. Pine, Yair Bar-Haim\n\nUniversity of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: Novel cognitive treatments have been emerging. For example, attention bias modification (ABM) aims to reduce attentional threat bias and reduce anxiety symptoms (Hakamata et al., 2010). Understanding the neural correlates associated these changes in symptoms may help refine therapeutic strategies. Previous reports have indicated changes in amygdala activation with acute and extended ABM training, and that baseline amygdala activation and active ABM relative to placebo yield greater symptom reductions (Britton et al., 2015); however, changes in functional connectivity have yet to be examined. This study characterizes the functional connectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following ABM training relative to placebo training.\n\nMethods: Socially anxious adults (18-30 years old, Liebowitz social anxiety scale ≥50) were randomized to receive either active ABM training or placebo training. Fifteen individuals in each group completed both acute (i.e., single session training) and extended training (i.e., twice weekly over a 4-week period). During all sessions, individuals indicated the probe (E or F) that appeared in one of two locations following threat-neutral or neutral-neutral face pairs. The placebo training involved the standard dot-probe task, where there was an equal likelihood of probes occurring in the location previously occupied by the threat face (i.e., congruent) or the neutral face (i.e., incongruent) across the task. The active ABM training task was designed to train participants to attend away from threat; therefore, all threat-neutral trials were incongruent. Using different face stimuli, attention biases were measured in the scanner before and after acute training and after extended training. Previously, Britton et al. (2015) reported results from analyses regarding changes in task-related activation. The current analyses of data from this prior report use an anatomical seed region to implement generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis. This analysis tested whole-brain Group (active, placebo) × Time(pre-training, following acute training, following extended training) × Condition(congruent, incongruent, neutral) interactions. The search territory was restricted to the prefrontal cortex using p<0.005 and cluster size of 27 voxels, which corrects for multiple comparisons within the PFC.\n\nResults: Group differences in functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex were detected across time and condition [(-1, 36, -6), 29 voxels, F(4,112)=3.99, p<0.05 corrected]. To understand these differences, conditions used to calculate threat bias (i.e., incongruent vs. congruent) were compared. Before training, no group differences in connectivity were noted [both ps>0.8]. After acute training, a group difference in amygdala-PFC connectivity to the incongruent relative to the congruent condition was noted [p<0.04], with the active and placebo groups showing opposite patterns of connectivity. Within the attention bias contrast, the active group exhibited stronger amygdala-PFC connectivity to the incongruent condition [p<0.05] and the placebo group exhibited a trend toward a stronger connectivity to the congruent condition [p<0.07]. Following extended training, this pattern was reversed [p<0.008]. Within the bias contrast, the active group exhibited stronger connectivity to the congruent condition [p<0.2], while the placebo group exhibited a trend toward a stronger connectivity to the incongruent condition [p<0.06].\n\nConclusions: In these preliminary analyses, acute and extended training alter the amygdala-PFC connectivity in different ways. Following acute training, the amygdala and PFC are more positively correlated in the incongruent relative to the congruent condition in the active group, while following extended training they are more negatively correlated. These results provide insight into mechanisms of change associated with ABM.\n\nKeywords: fMRI, threat, anxiety\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT18. Increased Within-Network and Cross-Network Functional Connectivity in Returning Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\n\nIsrael Liberzon, Rebecca Sripada, Joseph Heffernan, Sean Ma, Sheila Rauch*, PROGrESS Study Team\n\nUniversity of Michigan/VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by disruptions in arousal/interoception, executive function, and sense of self. These functions are subserved by intrinsic brain connectivity networks, which are distributed, functionally coherent regions that interact to coordinate complex behavior and cognitive functions. The three key networks that coordinate the functions disrupted by PTSD are the salience network, the central executive network, and the default mode network. The salience network (anchored in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and anterior insula) is responsible for detecting and orienting to salient stimuli. The central executive network (anchored in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex) is associated with goal-directed behavior and high level cognitive function, including planning, decision-making, and working memory. The default mode network (anchored in medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus) is associated with stimulus-independent, internally-focused thought and autobiographical memory. The salience network mediates between the central executive network and default mode network to maintain an adaptive balance between internal mentation and externally-oriented focus and task execution. PTSD symptoms have been linked to alterations in each of these networks. However, the interplay between these three critical networks has not yet been examined in patients with PTSD. Thus, the current study was designed to investigate patterns of connectivity within and between these three central intrinsic connectivity networks.\n\nMethods: 19 OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans with chronic PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Score ≥ 50) and 14 combat-exposed healthy control veterans underwent 3T fMRI prior to initiating PTSD treatment as part of a comparative outcomes study for PTSD. A standard series of processing steps was performed using statistical parametric mapping. Based on previous research with the triple-network model, seed regions for salience network were anatomical anterior insula and amygdala. The seed region for the central executive network was a 10-mm-radius sphere placed in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (MNI: 46, 6, 34). The seed regions for the default mode network were 10-mm-radius spheres placed in medial prefrontal cortex (-2, 48, -4) and posterior cingulate cortex (0, -56, 20). Functional connectivity analysis was performed using the ConnTool package. We extracted the spatially averaged time series from seed regions for each participant. Next, linear detrending was performed, followed by nuisance regression with motion regressors and five principal components of the BOLD time series extracted from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks. The residuals from this regression were then retained for further analysis. Since resting-state functional connectivity measures low-frequency spontaneous BOLD oscillations (.01–.10 Hz band), the time-course for each voxel was band-pass filtered in this range. Next, motion scrubbing was performed. Participants with more than 60% of their frames removed by scrubbing were excluded from further analysis. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between average time courses in the seed regions of interest (ROIs) and all other voxels of the brain, resulting in a 3-dimensional correlation coefficient image (r-image). These r-images were then transformed to z-scores using the Fisher r-to-z transformation. Z-score images from the individual activation maps were entered into second-level random-effects analyses implemented in SPM8.\n\nResults: Veterans with PTSD demonstrated greater within-network salience network connectivity, as well as greater cross-network connectivity between central executive network seeds and salience network regions and between default mode network seeds and salience network regions. Specifically, the PTSD group demonstrated stronger connectivity than the control group between anterior insula (salience network) and anterior cingulate cortex (-3, 15, 28; Z = 3.69)(salience network), between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (central executive network) and right amygdala (30, 5, -20; Z = 4.44)(salience network), between medial prefrontal cortex (default mode network) and anterior cingulate cortex (-9, 26, 25; Z = 3.55)(salience network), and between posterior cingulate cortex (default mode network) and anterior cingulate cortex (-15, 23, 25; Z = 4.51)(salience network).\n\nConclusions: Here we replicate previous findings in PTSD of increased within-network salience network connectivity and increased cross-network connectivity between salience network and default mode network. We extend these findings by demonstrating additional cross-network connectivity or desegregation between salience network and central executive network. Desegregation between these intrinsic connectivity networks may reflect sustained and likely inappropriate activation of salience network, which may negatively impact the adaptive balance between networks that is needed for appropriate cognitive resource allocation. This finding may reflect or help to explain sustained hypervigilance and hyperarousal in PTSD patients. These aberrant neural circuits may serve as targets for examination of change with treatment and future development of therapeutic interventions for PTSD.\n\nKeywords: Posttraumatic stress disorder, Human Neuroimaging, Connectivity, Resting state, salience network\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT19. Dentate Gyrus Controls Extinction of Contextual Fear Memory\n\nBrian Bernier, Adam Ayoub, Boris Zemelman, Michael Drew*\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States\n\nBackground: Traumatic experiences produce long-lasting fear memories that can form the basis of anxiety disorders. The primary method for attenuating learned fear is extinction, a procedure in which the subject is re-exposed to conditioned stimuli in a safe environment. Much of the previous research about extinction learning has focused on simple fear conditioning paradigms involving tone-shock pairings, which mainly recruit subcortical learning mechanisms. Humans and other mammals, however, can acquire more complex fear memories using cortical mechanisms, but very little is known about how these more complex fear memories are extinguished. To study extinction of cortical fear memories, we used contextual fear conditioning, a hippocampus-dependent form of conditioning that occurs when an animal is placed into a distinctive environment (or context) and given a footshock. Here we use optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods to assess the neuroanatomical substrates of context fear acquisition, expression and extinction. Our studies focus on dentate gyrus (DG) because of previous work implicating DG in acquisition of context fear memory.\n\nMethods: Fear conditioning was produced by placing mice into a conditioning chamber and administering a single footshock. Context fear memory was assessed by quantifying freezing behavior when mice were re-exposed to the chamber. To rapidly and reversibly manipulate neural activity during distinct phases of training, adeno-associated virus (AAV) was used to express optogenetic or pharmacogenetic neural actuators in the DG cell populations. The light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) was used for optogenetic inhibition, and the GPCR Gs DREADD (rM3Ds) was used for pharmacogenetic excitation. Activation of rM3Ds via systemic injection of its ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) stimulates cAMP production, leading to increased activation of dentate granule cells (DGCs). Neural activity in DG was silenced or enhanced (with eNpHR or rM3Ds, respectively) during acquisition, expression or extinction of context fear.\n\nResults: Optogenetic inhibition of the dorsal DG during the context-shock pairing impaired context fear acquisition. Silencing the DG during repeated re-exposures to the context in the absence of shock did not alter fear expression but attenuated fear extinction, suggesting that neural activity in DG is required for acquisition and extinction of context fear but not for its expression. Increasing activity of DGCs during context-shock pairing impaired acquisition of context fear, similarly to DG inhibition. Increasing excitability of DGCs during context re-exposure after acquisition had no effect on expression of the fear memory but led to a significant reduction in freezing during a subsequent drug-free context test, suggesting enhanced extinction or impaired consolidation.\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that extinction of context fear recruits neural circuits that are distinct from those controlling extinction of simple tone-shock associations. Whereas extinction of tone-shock pairings is mediated by plasticity in amygdala and prefrontal cortex, our studies identify DG as a critical locus for context fear extinction. Our data indicate that DG controls acquisition and extinction of context fear memory, but is not required for expression of learned fear or fear extinction. DG may provide a teaching signal that enables fear memory coding in a downstream structure such as CA3. In addition, our data suggest that enhancing activation of DG granule cells can facilitate the attenuation of learned context fear, either by enhancing extinction or preventing fear memory consolidation. In a clinical context, modulation of neural activity in DG may provide a strategy for facilitating extinction or preventing the consolidation of traumatic memories. In summary, our data identify the dorsal DG as a critical component of the neural circuitry mediating context fear extinction and as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of emotional disorders related to aberrant fear learning.\n\nKeywords: Fear extinction, dentate gyrus, Memory Consolidation and Extinction, Hippocampus, optogenetics\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT20. PACAP Effect on Fertility in Female Mice is Relayed through Leptin Receptor Expressing Neurons of the Ventral Premammillary Nucleus and Central Ventromedial Nucleus of the Hypothalamus\n\nRachel Ross*, Caroline Maguire, Anne Verstegen, Kong Dong, Ursula Kaiser, Bradford Lowell, Navarro Victor\n\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center & Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Leptin is known to play a critical role in control of metabolism and reproduction, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet understood. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuromodulator implicated in human anxiety, feeding and reproductive behavior. Though the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is known to be important in the control of fertility and reproduction, the role of PACAP in this circuit has only been investigated through whole body manipulations, where PACAP knock out animals display decreased rates of reproduction. PACAP has been described to stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) release directly at the level of the gonadotrophs in the pituitary and increase sensitivity to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), but the origin of the neuropeptide is not known. Centrally, high expression of PACAP is found in the ventral premamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus (PMV) and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) both regions known to be involved in leptin-related control of puberty and fertility, though the role of PACAP has not been investigated there. We harness genetic tools that focus on PACAP neurocircuitry in leptin responsive neurons to investigate the role that central PACAP plays in leptin-driven metabolism and reproduction.\n\nMethods: Taking advantage of cre-lox technology we created lox-PACAP mice that possess loxP sites flanking the 2nd exon of the PACAP gene, allowing for deletion of functional PACAP in the presence of cre-recombinase. The PACAP-lox mice were bred with LepRb-cre mice, which express cre-recombinase under control of the promoter for the long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb), which is restricted to the brain. We used dual-fluorescent immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to confirm co-localization of PACAP and LepRb. Mice were subjected to assays for energy homeostasis and fertility, and compared to littermate controls (PACAPfl/fl) using ANOVA.\n\nResults: Conditional knock out females lacking PACAP in LepRb-expressing neurons show slight protection against body weight gain seen in control animals when subjected to high fat diet. They have significantly delayed puberty onset determined by vaginal opening, with a trend toward delayed first estrus as well. Females show irregular estrous cycles with longer alternating periods in diestrus and estrus and decreased litter size. There is no change in male body weight, onset of puberty, or fertility. Combined ISH/IHC shows LepR activity co-localizes with PACAP expression in the ventral premammillary nucleus and the central part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n\nConclusions: Deletion of PACAP from leptin receptor expressing neurons of the hypothalamus in female mice leads to similar fertility-related dysregulation seen in whole body PACAP knockouts, yet these changes are due to deletion of PACAP from two discrete regions of the hypothalamus known to be involved in HPG axis regulation. While previous work has shown that the effect of leptin on both metabolism and fertility is through GABAergic signaling, PACAP neurons are glutamatergic. These findings propose a new role for the PACAP-containing leptin-responsive neurons of the hypothalamus in signaling nutritional state for reproductive status, indicating that a subset of glutamatergic neurons may be involved in fine tuning leptin’s action on reproductive function\n\nKeywords: metabolism, reproduction, PACAP, Leptin\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT21. Adolescent Caffeine Consumption Enhances Anxiety-Related Behavior and Disrupts Neuroendocrine Signaling\n\nCasey O'Neill, Ryan Newsom, Jacob Stafford, Talia Scott, Solana Archuleta, Sophia Levis, Robert Spencer, Serge Campeau, Ryan Bachtell*\n\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado, United States\n\nBackground: Caffeine is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide, and consumption by children and adolescents has risen dramatically in recent years. Recent studies have found associations between energy drink use and anxiety in young adult males. Here, we examine the effects of adolescent caffeine consumption on anxiety-related behaviors and several neuroendocrine measures.\n\nMethods: Beginning on postnatal day 28 (P28), Sprague-Dawley rats consumed caffeine (0.3 g/L) for 28 days (P28-55). Age-matched control rats consumed water. Following 28 days of caffeine consumption, the caffeine solution was replaced with water for the remainder of the experiment. Behavioral testing for anxiety-related behavior commenced at least 7 days after removal of caffeine (P62). Blood plasma levels of corticosterone (CORT) levels were assessed throughout the caffeine consumption procedure and at 24 hr and 7 days withdrawal from caffeine. Brain tissue was collected at 7 days withdrawal from caffeine to assess changes in basal and stress-induced c-fos and corticosterone releasing factor (CRF) mRNA expression throughout stress- and anxiety-related brain structures.\n\nResults: Caffeine consumption in adolescent rats enhanced anxiety-related behavior as indicated by decreased center exploration in an open field, decreased social interaction with age-matched conspecifics, and decreased open arm exploration on an elevated plus maze. Analogous studies conducted in adults suggest that caffeine consumption in adulthood does not enhance anxiety-related behavior. Caffeine consumption increased plasma CORT after 24 hrs of caffeine consumption. Plasma CORT levels normalized after 14 and 28 days of chronic caffeine consumption suggesting the development of tolerance. Twenty-four hrs after the removal of caffeine, animals had elevated plasma CORT that remained elevated for 7 days. Exposure to an elevated pedestal (a mild stressor) elevated plasma CORT levels in control animals, but this was significantly blunted in animals that consumed caffeine during adolescence. Blunted CORT release to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (1mg/kg, ip) was also observed in animals that consumed caffeine during adolescence. Adolescent caffeine consumption increased basal c-fos mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Stress increased c-fos mRNA in various stress reactive brain regions, but caffeine consumption had no effect on these stress-induced changes. Caffeine consumption during adolescence also produced a significant increase in CRF mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala, but no effects of stress or caffeine consumption were observed on CRF mRNA expression in other brain regions analyzed.\n\nConclusions: Together these findings suggest that adolescent caffeine consumption may increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including anxiety-related disorders, and this vulnerability may result from dysregulation of the neuroendocrine stress response system.\n\nKeywords: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis, Vulnerability, Adolescent Development, Adolescent Stress\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT22. Fear Conditioning and Extinction in Pediatric Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\n\nDaniel A. Geller*, Joseph F. McGuire, Scott P. Orr, Brent J. Small, Angelina F. Gomez, Tanya Murphy, Sabine Wilhelm, Daniel Pine, Eric A. Storch\n\nHarvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Fear acquisition and extinction are central constructs in the cognitive-behavioral model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Fear acquisition refers to the process by which a neutral stimulus (CS; e.g. a door handle) is associated with an aversive stimulus (US; e.g. the belief that the door handle is contaminated and will cause severe illness); this association leads to a conditioned fear response upon repeated exposure to the CS. Conversely, fear extinction is the process by which an individual decreases their emotional response to the CS by creating a new, positive association with that stimulus. Fear extinction is the foundation of first-line behavioral treatments for OCD, namely exposure with response prevention (ERP). Despite the centrality of fear learning processes in the acquisition, maintenance, and treatment of OCD, there have only been two studies of fear learning among adults with OCD, and none in youth with OCD. Studies comparing youth with anxiety disorders and healthy controls suggest that fear conditioning produces comparable fear learning in anxious and non-anxious youth during acquisition; however, results for fear extinction are less definitive. Behavioral and neurobiological research indicates that youth exhibit differential fear learning processes relative to adults. Furthermore, given that OCD typically onsets in childhood, and that a considerable number of youth with OCD exhibit inadequate or incomplete response to CBT, an examination of fear acquisition and extinction processes in youth with OCD is clinically relevant. The present study examined fear conditioning and extinction in youth with OCD and healthy controls using a novel computer-administered differential conditioning task. We hypothesized that, similar to findings from the adult OCD and child anxiety literature, youth with OCD would exhibit comparable physiological fear responsivity to healthy controls during the fear acquisition phase. However, we hypothesized that youth with OCD would exhibit poorer fear extinction compared to healthy controls.\n\nMethods: Eighty youth (39 OCD, 41 healthy controls) completed a battery of clinical interviews, rating scales, and a differential conditioning task. In this fear conditioning paradigm, participants learned to associate an aversive stimulus (US; a 95 decibel scream) with the paired conditioned stimulus (CS+), but not the unpaired conditioned stimulus (CS-). Two female faces served as the conditioned stimuli. The paradigm included three stages: habituation (4 presentations of each face without the US); acquisition (5 presentations of each face, with the US presented five seconds after the CS+); and extinction (8 presentations of each face without the US). Skin conductance response (SCR) to the presentation of stimuli was the primary dependent measure of fear.\n\nResults: During habituation, participants with OCD produced significantly larger SC responses relative to HC participants and significantly higher orienting SC responses to initial stimulus presentation. During acquisition, despite a trend, there was no significant difference between youth with OCD and healthy controls in the acquisition of a fear-conditioned SCR and differential fear conditioning was observed for both groups as evidenced by larger SCRs to the CS+ compared to CS-. The absolute magnitude of the unconditioned fear response was significantly greater in youth with OCD compared to HC participants. During extinction, a three-way interaction test showed that youth with OCD had a different pattern of SCR over extinction trials, compared to the control group.\n\nConclusions: The present study is the first examination of fear conditioning and extinction in youth with OCD. During the acquisition phase, there were no significant group differences in fear-conditioned SCR; there was a trend towards overall larger SCRs in the OCD group, but this group difference did not reach statistical significance. During extinction, however, significant group difference were found such that healthy controls showed decreased SC over successive extinction trials, whereas youth with OCD showed no reduction in absolute SC responses at the end of the extinction phase. As hypothesized, these results indicate that youth with OCD and community controls are similar in their acquisition of a conditioned fear response, but differ in patterns of fear extinction. This poor extinction response suggests that youth with OCD may have deficits in inhibitory learning, which carries important implications for the success of ERP-CBT. While initial CBT models emphasize within-and-between session habituation as the central mechanism for therapeutic change, research suggests that inhibitory learning may be a key therapeutic component. Indeed, within-and-between session habituation in CBT has not been found to predict treatment outcome for youth with OCD. An inhibitory learning deficit may explain disparate exposure-based CBT outcomes among youth with OCD and offers preliminary support for consideration of CBT protocols that optimize inhibitory learning. Given these important clinical implications, it is crucial that research continue to explore the psychophysiological patterns of fear response among both youth and adults with OCD.\n\nKeywords: OCD, Fear extinction, Fear conditioning, pediatric, CBT\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nT23. Post-Traumatic Stress Avoidance is Attenuated by Corticosterone and Associated with Brain Levels of Steroid Receptor Co-Activator-1 in Rats\n\nAnnie Whitaker*, Scott Edwards, Nicholas Gilpin\n\nLouisiana State University Health Science Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States\n\nBackground: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) manifests in a subset of individuals exposed to a traumatic stressor and is often accompanied by dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. Individuals with PTSD exhibit blunted HPA activity immediately after the traumatic event. Our laboratory has established a rodent model of stress that mimics the avoidance symptom cluster of PTSD. Animals are classified as ‘Avoiders’ or ‘Non-Avoiders’ post-stress based on avoidance of a predator-odor paired context. While the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is essential for appropriate initiation and termination of the stress response, the limbic system can also influence the HPA axis. Limbic forebrain structures such as the central amygdala (CeA) and ventral hippocampus (VH) regulate HPA responses to emotional stress. Like the PVN, the CeA and VH are rich in glucocorticoid receptors (GR). The purpose of these studies was to 1) examine whether Avoider rats exhibited HPA hypofunction at the time of stress, 2) determine whether the HPA hypofunction is the result of inability to mount an HPA response or enhanced negative feedback, and 3) measure the expression of GR elements in the brains of Avoider rats because altered corticosterone levels may affect HPA feedback processes. We hypothesized that corticosterone levels are blunted in Avoider rats post-stress and administration of corticosterone prior to stress would increase HPA activity at the moment of the stressor and decrease the magnitude and incidence of avoidance of a predator odor-paired chamber. Furthermore, we hypothesized that predator odor stress would alter expression and/or phosphorylation of GR machinery such as FK506 binding protein (BP) 51 and steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 in a brain region-specific manner in Avoiders relative to Non-Avoiders and unstressed Controls.\n\nMethods: To test these hypotheses, male Wistar rats (300g) underwent a place conditioning procedure to assess avoidance of an odor-paired chamber. Rats were exposed to a neutral environment one day or to predator odor (bobcat urine) the next day paired with two distinct environments. Rats were indexed for avoidance of the predator odor-paired 24 hours post-stress and classified as ‘Avoiders’ or ‘Non-Avoiders’. In experiment 1 (n=15), a blood sample was obtained at baseline, at the end of neutral conditioning and at the end of predator odor exposure to examine circulating adrenocorticosterone hormone (ACTH) levels. In experiment 2 (n=16), rats received a subcutaneous injection of either vehicle (normal saline) or corticosterone (25 mg/kg) one hour prior to predator odor exposure. In experiment 3 (n=24), rats were sacrificed at 48 hours post-stress for Western blot analysis of total GR, phosphorylated GR (pGR), FKBP51, and SRC-1 levels in the PVN, CeA, and VH.\n\nResults: Rats that exhibit persistent (>6 weeks) avoidance of a predator odor-paired context exhibit significantly attenuated corticosterone levels immediately following traumatic stress and low corticosterone at the time of stress was highly predictive of later avoidance suggesting that HPA dysregulation may play a role in the subsequent emergence of PTSD symptoms. A lower percentage (25%) of rats pre-treated with corticosterone prior to stress were classified as Avoiders, relative to saline-treated rats (75% Avoiders). In the PVN, there were no differences in GR, pGR, or FKBP51 protein levels. There was also a trend (p=0.06) toward a decrease in SRC-1 in Avoiders when compared to Non-Avoiders. PVN SRC-1 was strongly and negatively correlated with avoidance in all stressed rats. In the CeA, there were no differences in GR or pGR protein levels. There was a significant decrease in FKBP51 and SRC-1 protein content in Avoiders relative to Non-Avoiders. CeA SRC-1 content was trended to negatively correlated with avoidance in all stressed rats (r2 = 0.22; p = 0.06). In the VH, there were no differences in GR, pGR, or FKBP51 protein across groups post-stress. There was a significant increase in SRC-1 protein in Avoiders when compared to Control rats (p = 0.004) and Non-Avoiders (p = 0.02). VH SRC-1 content was strongly and positively correlated with avoidance in all stressed rats (r2 = 0.54; p = 0.002).\n\nConclusions: These data suggest that low corticosterone levels in Avoiders post-stress reflect blunted HPA response to stress, although this does not preclude the possibility that negative feedback is also altered in Avoider rats. SRC-1, a protein involved in HPA negative feedback and corticotropin releasing factor gene transcription was decreased in the PVN of Avoider rats. Changes in SRC-1, in particular, in the brain regions examined were highly predictive of avoidance behavior, identifying a potential link between abnormal HPA responses to stress and subsequent stress-related behavioral pathology. Corticosterone administration prior to stress decreased the magnitude and incidence of avoidance of a predator odor-paired chamber suggesting that the blunted HPA stress response in Avoider rats results from failure to mount and HPA response. One potential mechanism for this blunted HPA stress response is altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to parvocellular neurons in the PVN, a focus of ongoing studies.\n\nKeywords: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, posttraumatic stress, corticosterone\n\nDisclosures: Dr. Gilpin is a consultant for Glauser Life Sciences, Inc.\n\nT24. Psychostimulant-Induced Modulation of Prefrontal Cortical Activity, Early Sensory Signal Processing, and Behavioral Performance in Visually Guided Sustained Attention and Signal Detection Tasks\n\nBarry Waterhouse*, Brian Clark, Rachel Navarra, Luke Mitchell, Kara Agster\n\nDrexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is responsible for multiple executive functions including the ability to attend to salient events. Catecholamine projections to the PFC play a prominent role in maintaining or shifting attention as dictated by changing behavioral contingencies. The psychostimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH-Ritalin) blocks reuptake of catecholamines and is used to treat ADHD as well as to improve attention and executive function in otherwise healthy individuals seeking the drug's cognitive enhancing effects. Prior work from this laboratory has shown that MPH improves rodent performance in a sustained attention task, a translational model for evaluating the potential efficacy of ADHD medications. The goal of the present study was to identify the cellular correlates of drug-induced and state dependent changes in performance of the aforementioned sustained attention task and a visually-guided signal detection task.\n\nMethods: Fixed or driveable bundles of microwires were used to record the spike train activity of individual medial PFC neurons in rats performing a modified version of the McGaughy & Sarter (1995) sustained attention task. Other studies used the same approach to record local field potentials and multi-unit spike train activity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of anesthetized rats and rats engaged in a signal detection task. In all experiments neuronal activity was recorded before and after administration of MPH, 2.0 mg/kg i.p.\n\nResults: In the sustained attention task single units (n=104) recorded from PFC were classified as putative interneurons (n=27, 26%), putative pyramidal neurons (n=71, 68%), or unclassified (n=6, 6%). 41 % of putative interneurons and 58 % of putative pyramidal neurons exhibited brief increases or decreases in firing rate associated with either sensory or motor events in the task. Neurons that displayed sensory responses (to signal light or lever extension) showed generally stronger responses in correct trials than in incorrect trials or omissions, consistent with the hypothesis that performance in this task is affected by the strength of representation of sensory information in the PFC. Following MPH administration basal firing rates for all recorded neurons were not systematically altered. However, MPH did have a consistent effect on sensory-responsive cells, causing a shift to shorter latencies and longer-duration responses. In a visual signal detection task, MPH enhanced the speed and strength of dLGN neuronal responses to light stimuli that were used as behavioral cues. MPH also improved reaction times of correct responses but the accuracy of signal detection in highly trained animals did not change. In anesthetized preparations analysis of LFP’s evoked by light stimuli revealed a decrease in both response latency and peak-to-peak amplitude. Cross correlations between multiple LFP channels within individual animals showed an increase in the strength of correlation following MPH. This increase in the correlation between locally summed potentials from multiple electrodes may be consistent with an increase in local synchrony of neural discharges. Lastly, segmented auto power spectral density analyses computed for progressive 5-minute intervals following injection of MPH revealed a shift from the prevalence of low frequency oscillations of 0-4 Hz to the clear "
