[NI33562] From Raven A Nuckols 7/2014

Son of Ira C. Eggleston [1891-1984] created out of an adulterous affair his mother Mamie had. Mamie married three different times and had numerous affairs during her marriages. In order to conceal her dignity back in that time, she gave Sam her then husband's last name of NUCKOLS to hide her adultery. We would never have known that was the case without the DNA test matching my father with 99.9% accuracy to the Egglestons which some family had long suspected. His death cert names father Ira Eggleson and mother Mary Katherine Nuckols

Although he was drafted in WWII in 1942, he never served due to a heart condition and was only in the military for a period of six months.Samuel Leroy Nuckols enlisted in WWII on 2/15/43 as a Pvc 1st Class. He had ten children with Donna May Miller. After a battle with melanoma and bronchial pneumonia, he died on 3/1/80 and is buried in the Culpepper National Cemetary for Veterans. Any questions contact: starzntheskie@gmail.com

Raven, along with other trees at ancestry have Samuel as the son of Mamie Crews Nuckols married to Bernard Oliver Nuckols. This is not true. I have researched the documents and facts and can prove that is not true. Ask for copy of my research. (SandiK) Nuckolls Society
