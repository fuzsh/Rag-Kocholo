Introduction  (Subject list follows)

In the summer of 1988, Christian G. Fritz and Gordon M. Bakken published an article, entitled, California Legal History: A Bibliographic Essay (hereinafter referred to as Fritz & Bakken).[1] This article discussed various key topics in the legal history of the State of California and pointed readers toward some of the essential resources then available regarding those topics. Fritz & Bakkens article also marked an early recognition of California legal history as a rich research area worthy of further exploration.

Fritz & Bakkens original essay was just over nineteen pages long. As Professor Fritz has observed recently, it was intended only as a brief introduction to its topic, and as an encouragement to additional research and researchers, at a time when American legal history generally remained relatively new as a field of study, and California legal history even newer.[2]

Like many other fields of history in the post-1970 era, California legal history has expanded hugely, even explosively, over its still-fledgling state as of 1988. The field of legal history also has tended at times to merge with other fields of history, such that now, in addition to more traditional, pure legal history of matters such as courts, cases, judges, lawyers, and legal doctrine, one also routinely finds hybrid studies, combining legal history with, for example, social history, gender history, demographic history, labor history, agricultural history, economic history, or environmental history  among many other possibilities. Thus California legal history has grown progressively richer and more complex over the past quarter century, in ways that might have been difficult even to dream of when Fritz & Bakken offered their original introduction.

Given the growth, evolution, and maturation of the field of California legal history over the past decades, Selma Moidel Smith, editor of California Legal History, has for some time been eager to have Fritz & Bakkens essay updated and expanded. In 2010, she wrote:

One of the rewards of studying California legal history is that the field may be entered from nearly any perspective and pursued in nearly any area of interest. This is so because California legal history is not merely a microcosm of American legal history. It is a special case. Californias eventful legal history and its position as a legal innovator have allowed it to be among the few states whose legal history is recognized as a field of study. Unlike the study of American legal history in general, it is exceptional because it has not as yet crystallized into a self-contained academic field.

This circumstance gives rise to both its weaknesses and its strengths. Among the obvious weaknesses are that few university courses are devoted specifically to California legal history, and it is not recognized as a field of publishing apart from California Legal History. It would be difficult to name a scholar whose career has been devoted entirely to its study. And yet this circumstance also leads to one of the fields less-obvious strengths, its unique diversity of perspectives and subject matter.[3]

Accordingly, Selma informed me in that her goal in asking me to undertake this project (in June 2015) was to create a resource that would encourage scholars to pursue new research and also enable teachers to prepare course curricula in the field. The bibliography that follows represents an effort to do just that, as well as to commemorate the original article.

As readers will quickly discover  perhaps gleefully, perhaps glumly  this updated bibliography is a whole lot longer than the original, and seeks to be more comprehensive than the original was ever intended to be. The new bibliography also draws upon powerful new digital bibliographic research tools and techniques that remained mostly or entirely unavailable back in 1988.[4] Indeed, the whole era of microcomputing and related digital technologies that have revolutionized libraries, research, and information science in general has happened mostly since that time. Partly as a result of that transition and the expanded access to information that it has made possible, this bibliography includes a much wider range of particular topics and subtopics than the original article, along with expanded coverage of the topics Fritz & Bakken addressed.

As the length of this work approached 120,000 words (requiring about 300 pages in California Legal History), Selma proposed the more practical  and altogether more desirable  concept of expanding the bibliography from the pages of the journal to an independent online format. Thus, the main body of this text appears in the 2015 edition of the journal (Vol. 10, pp. 71-133) for general reading, but the complete results of my work  including the full body text and over 400 notes with thousands of bibliographic entries  appear only here in this online version.

The benefit is self-evident: Rather than being out-of-date the moment it is published, the bibliography will become a living resource. Readers are hereby invited to submit suggestions for citations (and corrections, please) directly to me at dewey@law.ucla.edu. I have agreed to continue in the capacity of Bibliography editor and gatekeeper for an indefinite period.

Perhaps ironically, though, notwithstanding the present bibliographys greatly expanded size and ambitious  or hubristic  goal of being complete and comprehensive, it is actually only more comprehensive than Fritz & Bakken, and thus in a sense remains, like the original, only an introduction. That is, despite the copious lists of sources concerning myriad topics that may be found here, this bibliography, too, remains inherently and inevitably incomplete  there is, and likely will always be, even more information out there regarding California legal history than can ever be captured in a bibliography.

That is partly because, like any other field of history, California legal history is a moving target: new books, articles, and theses are being written or are already in the publication pipeline even as this introduction is being written, while existing primary and secondary materials are being found  or recognized as relevant  and added to library or archival collections, catalogs, indexes, and finding aids. Such items are not yet listed in indexes or databases to be found. So, just as one cannot put ones foot in the same river twice, this snapshot of the state of California legal history, begun in the summer of 2015, would be doomed to incompleteness at the outset and in ever-greater need of updating later, like its predecessor, if not for the new era of digital, online publishing.

This bibliography is nevertheless predestined to be incomplete for the added reason that it remains practically impossible to construct and conduct theoretically perfect searches that produce all actual relevant results (and, preferably, no irrelevant ones) on any topic, and certainly on a topic as broad and diffuse as California legal history. It is frankly daunting, even humbling, to approach a subject as broad and multi-faceted as California legal history, to confront even a fraction of the myriad potential sub-topics, directions, and paths one may wander down in pursuit of that broad, amorphous general topic, and to recognize that law and legal history potentially touch almost all aspects of human existence and vice versa. John Muirs famous quote is singularly appropriate here: When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.[5] Where, exactly, does legal history stop, and ordinary history, or life, begin? In terms of digital research, the proliferation of sub-topics entails a similar proliferation of potential search terms. And there is no one master database, and no one set of correct search terms, that will produce everything that could be appropriately characterized as California legal history  which categorization necessarily requires a human judgment call, anyway. Rather, the results must be chased down using various different search terms in several different databases, and, perhaps contrary to the idealized theories of information science, in reality, if you switch databases, or even if you switch search terms or strategies using the same database, you will continue to find new relevant results that did not appear in earlier searches. Although this bibliography was compiled from many different searches in many different databases producing thousands of potentially (but not always actually) relevant results that had to be sifted one by one, along with other search techniques and many helpful suggested items for inclusion from members of the editorial board of California Legal History, it did not (and could not) draw upon literally every conceivable search in every available database. For this reason, too, it is inevitably incomplete.

With the caveat that this bibliography (even with ongoing improvement) can by no means be the final word on the subject, and remains only an introduction, a gateway into the field of California legal history the way Fritz & Bakkens original essay was, it is nevertheless hoped that it may serve as a helpful, useful, maybe even stimulating exposure to the vast, diverse, complex richness that California legal history has become. Indeed, hopefully some readers and researchers may come away with some of the same sort of feeling of discovery, and awe, that the author/compiler experienced  rather like Howard Carter reportedly murmered in 1923 following his first glimpses of the treasures in Tutankhamuns tomb, in response to Lord Carnarvons question, Can you see anything?

Yes, wonderful things.[6]

Special Honors & Commemorations

Although it is not the purpose of this bibliography to play favorites, certain scholars have made particularly notable and extensive contributions to scholarship in various areas of California history, and this bibliography seeks to appropriately recognize their efforts. For the most part, such special contributions are commemorated at or near the beginning of relevant topic headings  with the following two exceptions concerning two scholars who have made particularly major and broad-ranging contributions to California legal history in general.

In Memoriam: Gordon M. Bakken

Professor Bakken, coauthor of the original 1988 bibliographic essay, passed away in December 2014 at the age of 71. An obituary in the Legal History Blog described him as probably the leading legal historian of the American West of his generation.[7] Along with his wider work on the West as a region and other states or localities within it, Bakkens contributions to California legal history were extensive. In addition to his numerous publications, he chaired or otherwise served on a vast number of committees for masters theses on legal history topics that have come out of California State University, Fullerton over the past several decades, many of which appear in this bibliography.

In memory of Prof. Bakken, and in recognition of his contributions to the field, here, taken from his online curriculum vitae, are lists of his many books,[8] book chapters and encyclopedia entries,[9] articles,[10] and oral history interviews[11] specifically regarding California and its legal history. (Many of his works that concern the West more generally also touch upon California, of course.) These works also appear elsewhere in the bibliography under specific topics and headings.

Lawrence M. Friedman

Fritz & Bakken in 1988 noted the path-breaking work of Lawrence M. Friedman and Robert V. Percival in their seminal book examining in detail an example of the local history of California courts and criminal law, The Roots of Justice: Crime and Punishment in Alameda County, California, 18701910.[12] After many other similarly in-depth explorations of a variety of topics in criminal or civil law in several different California counties, after advising or assisting many student dissertations, theses, and research papers, and also after the passing of Prof. Bakken, probably few would deny Prof. Friedman the honorary title of the current Dean of California legal history  particularly with regard to the general history of courts and of civil and criminal law. In honor of his record of lifetime achievement in service of that field, here is a list of his publications specifically concerning California legal history (only a fraction of his total publication list).[13]

Admiralty [return to list]

In 1988, Fritz & Bakken noted that the study of admiralty in California legal history remains in its infancy, and they invited scholars to help the field grow to maturity.[14] For the most part, the searches undertaken for this bibliography suggest that relatively few scholars have taken up that challenge, and the two sources that Fritz & Bakken cited appear to remain among the few sources particularly focused on that topic[15]  but Prof. Fritz has identified many additional helpful resources that touch upon California admiralty law.[16]

African Americans [return to list]

Fritz & Bakken noted in 1988 that scholarly treatment of the legal history of Californias black community paled in comparison to the more extensive discussion of the legal aspects and entanglements of Californias Chinese and Japanese communities,[17] and that is still largely true. However, in addition to the two sources cited in the 1988 article,[18] various others regarding Californias African-American legal history have appeared or resurfaced since 1988. Regarding the 19th century, these include studies of the black experience in California during the preCivil War years when the ultimate fate of slavery remained uncertain and vestiges of slavery were imported into California during the Gold Rush,[19] along with more general discussions of Californias African-American residents before 1900.[20] For the period after 1900, scholarship on African Americans and the law includes biographies or oral histories of several notable black judges, attorneys, or lawmakers,[21] along with several articles or theses mostly focused on primarily postwar developments such as affirmative action and the fight for residential desegregation.[22] African-American labor history and associated legal conflicts during the Second World War and shortly afterward have also stimulated several studies.[23] The 1992 Los Angeles riots/rebellion, together with the earlier Watts Riots of 1965 and the later Rampart police scandal, have generated a number of studies that touch upon legal and law enforcement history that is especially associated with Los Angeles African-American community.[24]

Agriculture [return to list]

From before the Gold Rush through the foreseeable future, agriculture has been and will likely remain one of Californias major industries as well as a source of legal problems and litigation. Legal historians (primarily Victoria Saker Woeste) have extensively explored the business organization of agriculture and the cooperative movement;[25] other scholars have studied other aspects of the agricultural industry, including agricultural regulation and adjustment, the wine industry, and other topics.[26] Because the practice of agriculture, and resulting legal complications, are inextricably entangled with crucial inputs such as Water, Land, and Labor, see also the sources listed under those headings.

Archival/Bibliographic/Historiographical [return to list]

There are a number of helpful published resources providing archival or bibliographic information regarding California legal history, both generally and related to specific topics. Only a few early examples were listed in Fritz & Bakkens original article,[27] but since 1988, many additional resources have emerged or surfaced.[28] In particular, California Legal History has recruited scholars and archivists at various major libraries to provide overviews of their respective institutions holdings related to the history of law in California.[29] Western Legal History has also devoted two separate issues to archival and historiographical topics concerning California and the West more broadly.[30] As of mid-2015, the California Judicial Center Librarys department of Special Collections and Archives listed a wealth of manuscript holdings, including the papers of California Supreme Court Justices Allen E. Broussard, Ronald M. George, Joseph R. Grodin, Joyce L. Kennard, Otto M. Kaus, Wiley W. Manuel, Stanley Mosk, Frank C. Newman, Niles Searls, and Kathryn M. Werdegar, along with additional collections from California Supreme Court Bailiff Elliott Williams, Reporter of Decisions Randolph V. Whiting, Public Information Officer Lynn Holton, the papers of Bernard E. Witkin, and other collections associated with the California Supreme Court.[31] It is to be fondly hoped that such collections will only grow with time. See also Oral Histories.

Art Law [return to list]

The history of art law in California seems to have not yet generated many published traces. Yet there are some sources that address the topic.[32]

Asian Americans, Generally [return to list]

The many trials and travails of Californias Chinese-American and Japanese-American communities have long been established, major topics in California legal history. The experiences of other, traditionally smaller Asian-American communities, or of Asian Americans in general, have received less attention so far, although legal historians have started to fill those gaps, providing studies focused on Filipinos,[33] Koreans,[34] and East Indians[35] in California, along with other studies addressing the legal aspects and experiences of the states Asian-American residents more generally,[36] including the shared experiences of detention at the U.S. federal immigration facility at Angel Island.[37]

Border [return to list]

Myriad sources address legal issues relating to Californias border and territory. Californias portion of the international border with Mexico has received most attention,[38] but conflict over the state border with Nevada also has been studied,[39] as has the long-running argument over whether to divide California into multiple states[40] and the early possibility of a mega-state reaching from Utah to the Pacific Coast.[41] Probably the weirdest part of the story of Californias borders and proposed divisions concerns the would-be State of Jefferson, to be carved out of Californias northern counties and combined with contiguous counties in southern Oregon  a proposal dating back to 1941 if not earlier.[42]

California Constitution [return to list]

In 1988, Fritz & Bakken offered a relatively long list of sources concerning Californias constitutions  either the 1849 Constitution,[43] the 1879 Constitution,[44] or both.[45] Various aspects of Californias constitutional history, including issues regarding racial or other discrimination,[46] have by now been further explored by many different scholars,[47] notably including UC Hastings law professor and former California Supreme Court Justice Joseph R. Grodin,[48] who generously suggested many items to include under this heading. Prof. Fritz, in addition to many other helpful suggestions regarding items for inclusion in this bibliography, also offered a small librarys worth of additional resources regarding the California Constitutions of 1849 and 1879 and California constitutionalism and constitutional reform in general.[49] See also Early Anglo California, among other topics and headings.

Catholics & Catholicism [return to list]

From the earliest Spanish colonization through its surge in recent decades to become (again) the single largest religious denomination in California, the Catholic Church has held an important place in Californias history, including its legal history. Scholars have addressed the contested churchstate boundary in Spanish California;[50] the impact of Anglo-American conquest on Church property,[51] and especially the litigation over the Churchs Pious Fund of the Californias;[52] the staging, and suppression, of Americas first Passion Play in Victorian (and mostly Protestant) San Francisco;[53] and California Catholics activism and leadership in social reforms related to racial justice, among other issues.[54]

Children/Juveniles [return to list]

Childrens involvement with the law in various ways has not yet received the level of attention that legal historians have devoted to more established topics involving adults, but scholars have contributed research on different aspects of this topic, including juvenile delinquency and the origins of the juvenile justice system in California,[55] dependency and foster care,[56] and California Indian children and the law,[57] among others.[58] For additional sources that may touch upon the legal situation of children directly or indirectly, see also Family Law; Women (marriage & divorce).

Chinese Americans [return to list]

In their original 1988 article, Fritz & Bakken noted that the literature on the Chinese experience in California is quite large, and that most of it at least touches upon the discriminatory laws that fundamentally restricted and hung over the lives of early Chinese Californians.[59] They then offered a list of resources in which the legal historical aspects are central rather than peripheral.[60] Faulting certain earlier sources for not making better use of the San Francisco federal court records that provide the richest source of information regarding Chinese-Americans legal resistance to exclusion and discrimination, they cited the work of Charles McClain as a step in the right direction.[61] Since then, McClain has taken further steps in that same right direction, producing one of the most important books focused on the various legal aspects of the early Chinese-American struggle for equality, among other publications.[62]

The body of scholarship regarding the Chinese-American experience has grown much larger since 1988. Some of the literature focuses primarily on law, but other sources that are not primarily focused on law nevertheless interweave significant legal historical aspects together with other elements of the story, whether relating to social history, labor history, economic history, medical history, or other topics. Although a line must be drawn to prevent including literally every source that addresses the Chinese-American experience in any way, this bibliography will draw the line somewhat less sharply than did Fritz & Bakken, and will deliberately include various useful, interesting sources in which law is significantly interwoven with other historical concerns. Also, certain sources may focus primarily on the nationwide story and on federal policies and enactments more than specifically on California and its laws; but given how much of the nations Chinese population resided in California, the national and federal story remains to a significant extent a California story in its impacts, and some nationally/federally rather than strictly California-focused studies are included in this bibliography for that reason. Again, though, not everything can be included, and of course readers should be aware that there are many more resources out there to be found, some of which would doubtlessly enrich ones understanding of the topic even in a strictly California and legal context.

At any rate, there are many studies that focus on legal matters regarding Chinese Americans through the 1880s and the passage of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act,[63] along with other useful studies in which either the law, or California, is more interwoven around other concerns.[64] For the period from the 1880s through the mid20th century, studies tend to focus on exclusion enforcement and immigration,[65] and on the federal immigration processing facility at Angel Island.[66] Other sources concerning this middle period address sundry other matters,[67] including prewar competition between Chinese and Japanese immigrants.[68] Resources regarding the postwar period include an oral interview with Judge Delbert E. Wong, the first Chinese-American judge in the continental United States, plus other examples of challenges to traditional discrimination.[69] There are also small clusters of articles regarding various other aspects of the legal history of Chinese Californians that do not necessarily fit neatly within the rough chronological framework presented above, such as medical issues, including public health targeting of Chinese immigrants as well as state regulation of traditional Chinese medical practices;[70] legal travails of Chinese women;[71] school segregation and desegregation;[72] and archival or archaeological comments regarding researching Chinese-Californian communities.[73] See also Asian Americans, Generally.

Courts [return to list]

Special mention must be given to the much-anticipated Constitutional Governance and Judicial Power: The History of the California Supreme Court, edited by Harry N. Scheiber (Berkeley, forthcoming Spring 2016), sponsored by the California Supreme Court Historical Society. With chapters covering each period from 1849 to 2010  by Charles J. McClain, Gordon Bakken, Lucy E. Salyer, Harry N. Scheiber, Bob Egelko, and Molly Selvin  it is a comprehensive, fully documented history of the California Supreme Court and its influence in the state's economic, social, and political development, treating the institutional development of the Court, and more generally, of the state judiciary. There is discussion, too, of the jurisprudence of individual justices who influenced law nationally as well as the jurisprudence of the Court as a whole, in distinctive historic eras of conservative and liberal jurisprudence. The interplay of politics, socio-economic change, and federalstate relations as major factors in the development of both the common-law and constitutional law of California receives full attention for each period of the state's history. Major cases in each of the areas of the law often receive detailed systematic analysis.

Writing in 1988, Fritz & Bakken found that surprisingly little has been written about the history of Californias state and federal courts, an omission especially glaring given the availability of so many California court records.[74] They recommended various resources concerning the California Supreme Court,[75] Californias federal courts,[76] and Californias lower courts and court system in general.[77]

Since 1988, a wide array of additional studies of California courts have emerged, including a good many later contributions from Fritz[78] or Bakken.[79] Numerous articles have addressed the history of the California Supreme Court, some clustered in the 19961997 edition of the California Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook[80] or the recent 2014 edition of California Legal History,[81] among other places.[82] Other scholars have studied Californias federal courts during the 19th century[83] or the 20th century,[84] while still other resources discuss lower California state courts in the 19th century[85] or the 20th century.[86] The California grand jury system has received scholarly attention.[87] Scholars also have studied special courts and institutions concerning juvenile offenders.[88] See also the partial list of publications by Lawrence Friedman, included near the beginning of this bibliography, most of which concern different aspects of the operations and decisions of California county courts from the late 1800s through the mid- to late 20th century. Although the federal Ninth Circuit stretches far beyond California, developments regarding the Ninth Circuit, including periodic proposals to split it, necessarily implicate California and its legal history.[89] See also Archival/Bibliographic/Historical; Chinese Americans; Indians; Japanese Americans; Crime; Education; Prisons; Women (among various other possible additional headings of interest; courts come up in some significant measure under most headings in this bibliography).

Because judges and their biographies or oral histories represent a major topic in themselves, they are included under a separate heading; see also Judges. However, there are also sources concerning other court staff who should not be forgotten, such as court administrators,[90] public defenders,[91] and court clerks, research attorneys, court reporters, or court interpreters.[92] For district attorneys, other prosecutors, and other non-judicial attorneys, see also Lawyers.

In terms of courts as spatial, geographical, architectural entities  courthouses  most published historical sources focus on the San Francisco federal courthouse of 1905, finished just in time to confront the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[93] However, the California state court system and various federal courts in California maintain websites that include helpful brief historical background on courthouses as well as courts.[94] It is likely that some other sources exist on the histories of particular county courts or courthouses, possibly produced by county historical societies; if so, however, such sources did not appear among the results of the searches conducted for this bibliography.

Crime [return to list]

In Memoriam: Professor Clare V. McKanna, Jr. of San Diego State University, a prolific scholar of the history of crime, prisons, and related racial/ethnic dimensions in California, passed away in March 2012. Although his publications include important works concerning Arizona and the West more generally, here is a list of his contributions to California legal history in particular.[95]

Fritz & Bakken in 1988 used a broader organizational category of crime and punishment and found most of the literature on the topic to be focused on either the 1850s San Francisco vigilante committees (grouped under the heading Police & Law Enforcement in this bibliography) or criminal prosecutions resulting from early 20th century radicalism and labor agitation (here more likely to be found under the headings of Labor or Radicalism, Antiradicalism, and the First Amendment).[96] As to crime in general, they listed a few sources concerning crime and/or law enforcement,[97] including Lawrence Friedman and Robert Percivals important 1981 book concerning crime and punishment in late-19th-century Alameda County.[98]

Both before and after 1988, Friedman and his coauthors have contributed several additional studies of the history of California criminal law.[99] They have been joined by many other scholars providing local or regional studies of various aspects of California crime, criminal law, and criminal justice from the days of Spanish and Mexican rule onward.[100] One topic of particular interest has been murder and the closely related issue of the death penalty, resulting in several major studies of murderesses[101] along with sources regarding murderers of the more conventional male variety and homicide in general.[102] The O.J. Simpson murder trial of 19941995 in Los Angeles County has, predictably, generated a literature all its own.[103] So has the Sleepy Lagoon murder of 1942 and subsequent court proceedings from 19421944, in which seventeen young Hispanic men from Los Angeles were framed and convicted for the murder, then later saw their convictions overturned on appeal.[104] Homicides and other crimes perpetrated either by, or upon, 19th-century Chinese Californians have also drawn scholarly attention.[105] For more regarding murder and the death penalty, see also Notorious Cases; Judges (especially the unfortunate Chief Justice Rose Bird); Lawyers. Regarding lynching, see also Police & Law Enforcement.

Along with the aforementioned studies of homicide and crime in general, other aspects of the legal history of California crime and criminal justice have stimulated clusters of studies, including Californias three-strikes law of 1994 cracking down on repeat offenders;[106] sex crimes (including obscenity);[107] Prohibition;[108] illegal gambling;[109] women criminals (other than those already included among the murderesses or the sex crimes mentioned previously);[110] crimes in which women usually are the victims, such as domestic violence and stalking;[111] criminal youth gangs;[112] and crime on California Indian reservations.[113] The broad category of crime is inherently related to many other topics; see also Police & Law Enforcement; Prisons; Courts; Lawyers; Notorious Cases; Women; Gays & Lesbians; Radicalism, Antiradicalism, and the First Amendment; and various racial or ethnic headings (African Americans, Chinese Americans, Indians, Latinos, etc.).

Early Anglo California [return to list]

In addition to noting the overall dearth of historical analysis of California criminal law in 1988, Fritz & Bakken listed relatively few sources regarding the early history of Anglo-American civil law in the Golden State,[114] some of them not primarily focused on law but useful nonetheless.[115] Many scholars have since contributed to the history of the period of transition from Mexican to Anglo-American control of California[116] and the impact (or not) of Spanish/Mexican law and custom upon Anglo-California law.[117] David J. Langum has been an especially determined scholar of this transition period in California,[118] while John Phillip Reid has particularly focused on the early development of Anglo-California law among settlers on the Oregon and California trails before they reached California or their ultimate destinations within the state.[119] Even leaving aside sources specifically concerned with popular topics such as the Gold Rush, crime in early San Francisco, and the like (which appear under separate headings), there are many sources that discuss the legal history of the first few decades of Anglo Californias existence,[120] including topics such as taxation,[121] the adoption of the common law and the Field Code,[122] and the origins of local government in Anglo California.[123] A 2003 special edition of California History that was also published separately as a book  Taming the Elephant: Politics, Government, and Law in Pioneer California  offers a particularly rich concentration of helpful articles covering a range of topics regarding the legal history of early Anglo California.[124] See also California Constitution (the 1849 and 1879 Constitutions form a major topic in themselves); Chinese; Crime (19th century); Gold Rush; Indians. In particular, see the many books and articles by Professor Bakken listed at the beginning of this article, the great majority of which concern the early decades of Anglo-California legal history.

Education [return to list]

Fritz & Bakken, in discussing education, addressed only legal education and law schools.[125] But, as subsequent scholarship has shown, there is so much more to the legal history of California education and education law.

Discrimination, and anti-discrimination policies such as affirmative action, have been the major theme of legal historical scholarship regarding California education for decades. Various studies have focused on higher education,[126] including legal education.[127] The landmark higher-education affirmative action case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), has generated an extensive literature all by itself, although many of these sources focus more on the story after the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court than on the earlier proceedings and background in California.[128] Discrimination, segregation, desegregation, and funding equalization in the lower grades and in California education generally also have stimulated a good many historical studies.[129]

Along with more general accounts of the struggle against discrimination in education, scholars have focused on the particular experiences of particular racial, ethnic, religious, gender, or sexual orientation minorities. Given the special salience and significance of cases such as Mendez v. Westminster School District of Orange County, 161 F.2d 774 (Ninth Circuit, 1947), and the even earlier Lemon Grove Incident in San Diego County (19301931), the educational experiences of Californias Latinos especially have drawn analysis,[130] although Chinese Americans,[131] Japanese Americans,[132] Asian Americans generally,[133] and Californias Indians[134] have not been ignored. The searches for this bibliography mostly did not turn up sources focused exclusively on African Americans in California education, with one exception,[135] but the topic is covered in some more general discussions of the legal and political histories of Californias black communities as well as the more general treatments listed under this heading. Other sources address the particular legal battles or experiences of Jews,[136] women,[137] and gays and lesbians[138] in the educational context.

Turning from the issues of discrimination and minority communities to education more generally, various sources address diverse topics from the 19th and 20th centuries.[139] Topics of particular scholarly interest have included the 1976 Rodda Act regarding collective bargaining for school employees,[140] teacher certification and tenure,[141] and social studies legislation.[142] At the higher education level, scholars have studied the constitutional status of the University of California and other aspects of the relationship between the state educational system and the state constitution.[143] Other sources also touch upon the legal history of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement of the mid-1960s.[144] The history of loyalty oaths and anti-communist policies in California education has drawn considerable scholarly attention.[145] Aspects of the history of legal education in California outside the discrimination/affirmative action context also have been further discussed,[146] including some oral history interviews along with archival documents.[147]

Environment & Natural Resources (includes Oil, Air Pollution, Coastal & Ocean Resources & Policy, Wildlife & Endangered Species, Parks & Scenic/Recreational Land Preservation, and Timber & Forestry, among Others) [return to list]

Even leaving aside the categories of Land, Water, and Mining, treated separately under other headings, this category remains broad and diverse in a state as resource-rich as California. Fritz & Bakken, in 1988, only addressed the oil industry (along with mining),[148] and identified several helpful sources touching upon petroleum law, some of them discussing the American oil industry in general rather than California specifically.[149] Various other sources, mostly more recent, specifically concerning the legal history of California oil have emerged or resurfaced since 1988,[150] while the legal and general history of California oil likely will also be covered in some more recent general histories of the American oil industry as in the general sources listed by Fritz & Bakken  especially considering that California remained a larger producer of oil than Texas into the 1930s. There are also biographies and other works that recount the involvement of Los Angeles oil baron Edward L. Doheny in the extended litigation following the Teapot Dome scandal of 1924 (which partly involved the Elk Hills naval oil reserve in eastern-central California).[151]

As to other environmental issues, there are various sources that touch upon legal and regulatory aspects of air pollution, including severe copper smelter pollution in turn-of-the-century Shasta County, the development of the notorious Los Angeles smog problem in the 1940s and 1950s, and state laws establishing the RECLAIM regional clean air incentives market and the cash for clunkers program to retire older, heavier-polluting automobiles enacted during the late 20th century.[152] Along with numerous sources that deal with water more generally, some sources address the legal history of water from a specifically environmental perspective.[153] Some instances of toxic pollution and resulting litigation have been addressed historically,[154] although certain other major examples, such as the RocketdyneAerojet litigation, seemingly have not been yet. Scholars have addressed the legal-historical aspects of fisheries,[155] as well as the protection of wildlife and endangered species.[156]

Appropriately in California, with its many scenic wonders, the establishment of parks and the preservation of scenic and recreational landscapes is a major focus of research. Yosemite National Park, John Muirs beloved crown jewel of the Sierras, and its legal issues have been studied,[157] along with neighboring Hetch Hetchy,[158] Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, Mineral King, the Big Sur, the Mojave Desert, and Channel Islands National Park.[159] Scholars also have explored the legal and historical aspects of the California Coastal Commission, perhaps the most powerful state regulatory agency concerning land use and preservation in the United States,[160] along with battles over nuclear power plant siting,[161] recreational trails preservation, and land use regulations more generally.[162] Notably, the legal history of national parks was relatively well-represented in the searches conducted to compile this bibliography; state, county, and municipal parks, which have legal histories of their own to explore, appear to have been studied relatively little so far, though there are some notable exceptions.[163]

The complex history and legal history of one park in particular  Redwoods National Park  has long been tightly intertwined with the wider, often bitter and frequently litigated timber wars regarding access to trees on public land as well as efforts to protect old growth forests on private land, and the histories of both the park and the wider wars from the late 1800s to the (sometimes vicious) late 20th-century battles over the Headwaters Forest and habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl have drawn considerable scholarly attention, along with other aspects of forestry and timber management.[164] Scholars have also probed other California legal-historical-environmental topics, such as environmental policymaking, the rise of historic preservationism, and the contested ownership of a celebrated meteorite.[165]

California is of course, famously, a place where the land meets the sea, and that interface between earth and ocean has long been integral to the Golden States legal history as well as general history. Professor Harry N. Scheiber in particular has long devoted scholarly attention to coastal and ocean resources, policy, science, and regulatory law, with a special emphasis on the California legal and historical context,[166] as have other scholars.[167]

Again, see also Land, Water, and Mining, as well as sources addressing the public trust doctrine in the context of Land and Water.

Family Law [return to list]

The history of California family law appears to remain relatively unexplored, but nevertheless, in addition to Prof. Jacobus tenBroeks multipart general study of the topic during the mid-1960s,[168] various later scholars have conducted research into a range of different particular aspects of family law, including parental custody and the legal aspects of gay and lesbian family formation.[169] See also the related headings Children; Women (marriage & divorce).

Gambling/Gaming [return to list]

During the second half of the 20th century in California, gambling went from being an illegal activity, sometimes the target of vice squads, perhaps more often just winked at, to become a major state industry in the form of Indian casinos, with the perjorative term gambling now largely replaced by the more polite term gaming. The earlier period has drawn relatively limited scholarly attention,[170] although the topic will come up in various broader discussions of 19th-century San Francisco in particular, but a number of books or theses have studied the rise of Indian gaming in California.[171]

Gays, Lesbians & Alternate Sexuality [return to list]

The LGBT rights movement is one that has mostly developed since the time of Fritz & Bakkens article, and most of the historical investigation of alternate gender/sexuality communities also has happened since that time. In recent decades, major political and legal fights and, ultimately, victories on issues such as gay marriage and the repeal of anti-sodomy laws have helped to energize the movement and to stimulate investigation of the communities histories. As such, there are a number of recent dissertations and articles that concern various aspects of the legal history of the LGBT communities. Many, though not all, discuss San Francisco, and nearly all concern the postwar period,[172] though there are some exceptions that go back much earlier.[173] Along with other studies that address different angles of the topic, a number have recently appeared focused specifically on the legal history of the struggle to legalize gay marriage.[174] Regarding the related topics of marriage and the criminalization of sexuality, see also Women (marriage & divorce) and Crime (sex crimes).

Gold Rush (and Law & Economics) [return to list]

Many scholars have discussed law in relation to the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush, and the legal or quasi-legal institutions that emerged in the California gold fields, have been a special object of fascination for a good many scholars who have studied the issue from a law and economics perspective,[175] including water rights along with mineral rights.[176] Other scholars have explored other aspects of the legal history of the Gold Rush, including the origins of California and U.S. mining law,[177] the experience of African Americans in the gold fields,[178] and legal (or extra-legal) treatment of Chinese immigrant gold miners,[179] among other topics.[180] The history of the Gold Rush is inextricably interwoven with other topics from early Anglo California, so see also Early Anglo California; African Americans; Chinese Americans; Indians; Mining; San Francisco; and Water (among other possibilities).

Hollywood & the Entertainment Industry [return to list]

For one of the biggest and most characteristically California industries, the film, television, and music industries so far have perhaps drawn less attention from legal historians than they deserve. Yet historians have probed various interesting, legally involved aspects of the film[181] and television[182] industries, including how court trials and judges are presented in the media.[183] Sadly, no resources regarding the radio or music recording industries appeared among the search results for this bibliography  which, as always, does not mean theyre not out there; it only means that they proved difficult to find.

Housing & Urban Planning [return to list]

Scholars have explored various legal dimensions of housing and urban planning  particularly the racial discriminatory aspects, as presented most starkly in the history of Californias Proposition 14 (1964) and its effort to repeal the Rumford Fair Housing Act of 1963,[184] along with development restrictions,[185] among other issues.[186] See also Race; Propositions and Initiatives; Local Government.

Humboldt County (Local History) [return to list]

Gertrude Stein famously observed, The trouble with Oakland is that when you get there, there isnt any there there.[187] One wonders what she might have said about the shopping-mall sprawl of Southern California and the Bay Area today. At any rate, good local history, including legal history, helps to mitigate that archetypally California syndrome by helping to create a sense of place as well as time. And in terms of local legal history, in the searches for this bibliography, two jurisdictions particularly stood out as exemplars of rich, active local history: Humboldt County and San Diego County. Perhaps its only a coincidence that they are at opposite ends of the state, Humboldt County almost as far from L.A. and S.F. as its possible to be and still be in California, although San Diegos separation from Los Angeles shrinks daily. If every place explored its local history as richly as these two counties, it would be a better, happier place for historians, although admittedly perhaps something of a headache for librarians and bibliographers.

Humboldt Countys local legal history includes the would-be State of Jefferson;[188] the presence of Chinese workers during the 19th century;[189] notable murders and executions;[190] biographies of local attorneys, judges, and other court staff;[191] Humboldt Countys Indian tribes;[192] and sundry other topics.[193] Although occasionally an outside journal includes an article on Humboldt County,[194] the overwhelming majority of this local historical coverage appears in the pages of the Humboldt Historian.

Indians (Indigenous Americans) [return to list]

Fritz & Bakken did not mention Californias indigenous peoples, or laws relating to them, in their 1988 article  perhaps out of a sense that Indian law, involving (at least putatively) sovereign peoples and territories, is in some ways fundamentally different from normal law within a states territory, perhaps because much of Indian law and legal history in America traditionally focused (and focuses) more on other regions with more fully-established relationships between the tribes and the federal government, or perhaps because this topic was still awaiting scholarly attention. Whatever the case, there are by now many resources that illuminate how the law has affected Californias Indians. Among others, Vanessa Ann Gunther has explored in depth and detail how Anglo-American law in the 19th century impacted the lives of Native Americans in Southern California in a wide variety of ways, including matters both civil and criminal, as well as laws that allowed the effective seizure and enslavement of both Indian adults and children.[195] Her work poignantly explains the special burdens of Californias Mission Indians, not borne by most other indigenous peoples of North America: first, enslaved by the Spanish friars (under Spanish and Catholic law and regulations); then set upon by Anglo Americans with their self-serving laws and courts without even the weak and flawed but still somewhat mitigating official protection of the U.S. federal government and federal treaties, due to Californias transition to virtually instant statehood at the end of the MexicanAmerican War. (The general rule throughout United States territory was that however bad the federal government and the U.S. Army were in their treatment of Indians, state, territorial, and local governments were even worse.)[196]

But other scholars have also contributed worthy studies of many different aspects of the (generally tragic) legal history of Californias Indians before 1900, including Spanish and Mexican legal understanding and (mis)treatment of the native peoples,[197] Anglo Americans de facto practice of genocide against them[198] and enslavement of them,[199] the limited participation of the federal government in California Indians affairs,[200] and many other topics.[201] In the 20th century, major topics include official federal recognition of tribes and tribal revitalization;[202] Indian land claims and litigation over them;[203] Public Law 280, a 1953 federal enactment that has caused severe jurisdictional confusion and legal problems regarding reservations, state courts, and law enforcement both in California and throughout the United States;[204] the Colorado River Indian Reservation;[205] the rise and legalization of Indian gaming in California;[206] legal issues involving Indian children and youth;[207] tribal water rights;[208] and other matters, some related to particular federal laws and policies to varying degrees.[209] Certain official documents of the State of California regarding Californias Indians also surfaced, somewhat at random, in the searches conducted to assemble this bibliography;[210] they suggest that there might well be other such documents out there that are potentially of interest. There are also various local history resources from San Diego County[211] and Humboldt County[212] that concern California Indians and legal issues directly or indirectly. (Note: Indian tribal law of particular California tribes is likely to be tribe-specific and thus to require tribe-specific searches; at any rate, for the most part, no such tribal legal-historical materials surfaced in the searches conducted to compile this bibliography.)

Regarding a notable Native American who was not a member of a California Indian tribe, but rather a Cherokee who came to California during the Gold Rush years and became Californias first novelist, see Lawyers (John Rollin Ridge).

Insurance [return to list]

Several scholars have probed aspects of the history of insurance law in California, particularly medical insurance, title insurance, and insurance litigation in the wake of the great San Francisco earthquake, among other topics.[213]

Italian Internment [return to list]

The intense interest of historians, legal and otherwise, in the tragic history of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II helped to stimulate interest in other, smaller, less well-known examples of internment. Of these, the most striking and researched instance in California involves the internment of Italians, particularly those who lived in San Francisco.[214]

Japanese Americans [return to list]

As with Chinese Americans, there is a wealth of research regarding discrimination against Japanese Americans, from the California alien land acts of 1913 and 1920 through the Japanese-American internment and its aftermath. Some of this research specifically concerns the law and legal history; some other studies are focused primarily on other matters, such as social history, labor history, agricultural history, or family history, but nevertheless include legal issues significantly interwoven with the others; and some, although often fascinating, barely touch upon specifically legal matters at all. This bibliography seeks to err on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion, and thus it sometimes includes some of the interwoven sources, even if they do not focus exclusively or primarily on the law or on California. As with the Chinese Americans only perhaps even more so, Japanese Americans were heavily concentrated within Californias borders before the World War IIera internment and relocation; in a 1944 pamphlet protesting the internment, Carey McWilliams noted that nearly eighty percent of all the Japanese Americans in the continental United States in 1940 lived in California.[215] To that extent, even legal developments in Washington, DC, or internments that took place in other states such as Arizona or Wyoming, heavily impacted the lives of Californians and thus arguably fit within California legal history  but it is also impossible to include everything that has been written about the internment.

Fritz & Bakken in 1988 listed a few resources,[216] including Roger Daniels 1962 book, The Politics of Prejudice,[217] regarding prewar discrimination against Japanese Americans and the alien land laws,[218] plus several more regarding the wartime Japanese-American internment,[219] including Peter Irons important 1983 book, Justice at War, which helped to stimulate the reopening and reconsideration of the Supreme Courts wartime internment cases.[220]

Daniels and Irons have both contributed more work focused on the internment and its aftermath.[221] They are joined by many other scholars who have investigated aspects of Japanese Californians legal history. The California alien land acts have been the subject of numerous monographs[222] and articles,[223] while other studies have explored other aspects of Californias relationship with its Japanese-American residents,[224] as well as the competition that arose between Chinese and Japanese Americans for relative economic status and racial-ethnic acceptability during the prewar years.[225]

Fritz & Bakkens article appeared in the same year that the United States government formally apologized for the internment order and authorized reparations to Japanese-American survivors of the internment camps. The dramatic and successful campaign for reparations likely helped to stimulate additional scholarly interest in the topic that has resulted in a large number of books and other sources on the internment over the past quarter-century, some of them more focused on the law and/or California,[226] some of them less so but still potentially of interest to California legal historians.[227] One particularly notable and interesting historiographical trend in this literature is the surge in scholarly interest in those internees who, contrary to the wartime and postwar established account of docile and dutiful internees, actively resisted the internment, in some cases even to the point of renouncing U.S. citizenship in protest; such cases often resulted in legal actions and administrative or court hearings.[228] Similarly, there is heightened scholarly sensitivity to the contested meaning(s) of the whole unfortunate internment ordeal.[229] Other studies have focused on other individuals and organizations, such as the ACLU, that opposed the internment in various ways and to varying degrees.[230] The long postwar campaign for redress and reparations, and the reopening of the Supreme Court internment cases, have themselves also become topics for scholarly inquiry.[231] Along with secondary sources, there are also government documents and other primary source materials that illuminate the legal and general history of the internment.[232]

This bibliography generally uses the long-established term internment as the most immediately recognizable and distinctive label for the long and harsh ordeal to which Japanese Americans were subjected after President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 in February 1942. The term itself, however, is conflicted and controversial as well as arguably imprecise and legally incorrect, as Roger Daniels, Harry Scheiber, and other scholars have forcefully pointed out. For that reason, a growing number of recent scholars use, and encourage use of, alternate terms such as evacuation or incarceration[233]. Notably, Wikipedia, not by any means the last word on the subject but perhaps an unusually good index of established conventional usage, presently still uses the term internment. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans.) To the extent that internment fades from general use and is replaced by alternate terms in coming years, this bibliography likely will be changed to reflect that transition. At any rate, the present use of the established if conflicted and inaccurate term emphatically is not intended to show any disrespect toward either the victims of the ordeal or its recent chroniclers.

Although most other topics are bound to pale in comparison to the high drama and passion surrounding the internment and the subsequent campaign for redress, and although there seems to be relatively little legal historical analysis of Californias Japanese Americans in the postwar period outside the internment context, another, quieter victory in the postwar Japanese-American struggle against discrimination may be found in the oral history of wartime internee, Second World War combat veteran, and longtime California state judge George Yonehiro.[234] There is also a recent book on the life, and 1946 prosecution for treason in San Francisco, of Tokyo Rose, a native Japanese-American Californian.[235]

Jews [return to list]

There is a wealth of material about Jewish history in California and the West, and a historian can only wish that every community were as fastidious about preserving their history and records. It also turns out that Jewish judges, lawyers, and lawmakers were prominent in California from the Gold Rush years onward, such as Solomon Heydenfeldt, an early Jewish justice of the California Supreme Court from 18521857.[236] The journal Western States Jewish History, in particular, has published biographies of several notable early California Jewish judges,[237] attorneys,[238] and lawmakers or law enforcement officials.[239] Scholars also have contributed biographical treatments and oral histories of the single leading legal scholar and writer of treatises on California law, Bernard E. Witkin.[240] In addition to these biographies, there are numerous sources regarding different aspects of California Jews interaction with the law, from the early statehood period,[241] the later 19th century,[242] and throughout the 20th century.[243] Certain topics have produced clusters of articles, such as antisemitism (mostly but not entirely during the 19th century),[244] Jewish resistance to Sunday Blue Laws,[245] Jewish charitable institutions,[246] and legal issues surrounding marriage, intermarriage, or divorce under Jewish religious laws.[247] For oral histories and other sources regarding Stanley Mosk, one of the great 20th-century Jewish justices of the California Supreme Court, as well as his appellate-judge son Richard Mosk and his Supreme Court colleagues Mathew Tobriner and Joseph R. Grodin, see also Judges.

Judges [return to list]

Fritz & Bakken noted that studies of judges existing in 1988 tended to be biographical rather than analytical in orientation; they noted a number of studies of California Supreme Court justices[248] and other state or federal judges in (or from) California,[249] along with an already substantial cluster of studies of Justice Stephen J. Field.[250] They also remarked on a growing number of oral history interviews of judges, especially federal judges of the Northern District of California, conducted by the Bancroft Librarys Regional Oral History Office.[251]

Many additional sources have by now joined those listed in the original 1988 article. In particular, several justices of the California Supreme Court have stimulated clusters of scholarly studies: in alphabetical order, Chief Justice Rose Bird;[252] Justice Jesse W. Carter;[253] Justice (and later U.S. Supreme Court Justice) Stephen J. Field;[254] Chief Justice Ronald M. George;[255] Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson;[256] Justice Joseph R. Grodin;[257] early Justice Solomon Heydenfeldt;[258] Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas;[259] Justice Stanley Mosk (and his son, Justice of the California Court of Appeal Richard M. Mosk);[260] Justice Cruz Reynoso;[261] Justice Raymond Sullivan;[262] Chief Justice Roger J. Traynor;[263] and early Chief Justice David S. Terry.[264] Thanks to Professor Fritz, Judge Ogden Hoffman, early federal judge of the Northern District of California, also has received substantial attention.[265] Western Legal History, the journal of the Ninth Circuit Historical Society, has made a tradition of commemorating chief judges of the Ninth Circuit, including Richard H. Chambers,[266] James R. Browning,[267] and Alfred Goodwin,[268] while other law journals have commemorated other Ninth Circuit appellate or district judges with symposium editions.[269] A former Ninth Circuit judge from California who has gone on to even bigger things, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, is relatively much studied, with more interest focused on his post-California days as with Stephen Field and Earl Warren.[270] Along with these more frequently or extensively studied jurists, scholars have produced studies or oral histories of various other California state or federal judges from the 19th[271] and 20th centuries,[272] including additional justices of the California Supreme Court.[273] A good many of the studies of California legal history, especially court and judicial history, have been contributed by judges and justices themselves.[274] As to online resources regarding the California judiciary, the California Supreme Court Historical Society web page includes links to official retirement or obituary commemorations of most California Supreme Court justices, among other resources,[275] while the Federal Judicial Centers History of the Federal Judiciary website offers a Biographical Directory of Federal Judges, 1789Present, including basic biographical and judicial service records on nearly all federal judges,[276] and the six districts of the California Court of Appeal maintain websites with information and/or photographs regarding current sitting justices and, in some cases, former justices.[277] Ballotpedia, a searchable website providing information on elections and politics, provides brief biographies of most sitting California federal and state judges, as well as some senior or retired judges.[278] Most studies concerning judges focus on particular individuals, as Fritz & Bakken also observed years ago, but some studies address judges and judging more generally.[279] Regarding one of the towering figures of California and American legal history who was never a judge until after he left California  Earl Warren  see Lawyers. For often light-hearted local histories of the bar and bench from various jurisdictions, also see Lawyers. For an unusual case of somebody who might be seen, in a sense, as an honorary member of the California state judiciary as the single most respected writer of treatises covering the whole range of California law, widely followed by judges as well as attorneys, see several articles regarding the legendary Bernard Witkin.[280]

Labor (including Agricultural) [return to list]

Much has been written about labor issues and the law in California history. Most such scholarship focuses on agricultural labor in the postwar period,[281] much of it specifically regarding Cesar Chavez and the epic struggles of the United Farm Workers during the 1960s and 1970s.[282] Although people of many other ethnicities continued to labor in Californias fields after the Second World War, notably the Filipino grape-pickers who were such an important component of the early UFW and its famous strikes and boycotts, during the postwar years Californias agricultural labor force became so predominantly Hispanic in ethnic origin that the agricultural labor movement is frequently, and perhaps justifiably, viewed as primarily a major component of the Latino civil rights movement  so readers concerned with that period of agricultural labor might want to see also various sources under the Latinos heading that relate to immigration, discrimination, civil rights, and other such matters that were also implicated in the context of agricultural labor. For more regarding agricultural business organization and management, see also Agriculture; for additional sources regarding agricultural work in general, not necessarily organized or unionized labor, see also other headings such as Indians (19th century), Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, and Asian Americans, Generally.

Along with postwar, predominantly Hispanic agricultural labor, historians have studied other episodes in agricultural labor/legal history involving the radical World War Iera International Workers of the World (the Wobblies) and New Deal farm labor policies.[283] Legal historians also have explored labor history outside the agricultural context; much of this research focuses on the early 20th century and on Progressive-Era reforms and antiradicalism,[284] although other studies concern primarily postwar labor policies and reforms such as workers compensation and equal employment opportunity programs.[285] Legal historians also have shown significant interest in black Californians experience of labor and (often troubled) relationship with labor unions during the 1940s; see also that subtopic under African Americans.

Land (and Real Property) [return to list]

Fritz & Bakken devoted more than four out of the 19½ pages in their original article specifically to California land and litigation over it,[286] and they identified many sources.[287] Yet predictably, for such an important and central topic, there are by now many more studies covering a wide range of topics, most concerned with the 19th or very early 20th centuries,[288] but a few covering the postwar period.[289] Along with these sundry topics, there are many more studies of legal disputes over the Californios land grants and of the history of particular grants and ranchos.[290] Several articles by Prof. Paul W. Gates regarding the history of land and law in California, some mentioned by Fritz & Bakken, some not, were collected and published in a book in 1991.[291] In view of the endless litigation over land titles during the 19th century, scholars have, appropriately, also studied the rise of title insurance.[292]

If a general characteristic of the broad, diverse topic of California legal history is that everything tends to be connected to everything else, the subtopic of land is even more that way. Thus, many other sources under many other headings also involve land to one degree or another  especially Agriculture (and Labor (agricultural)), Environment and Natural Resources (including park preservation, land use, the oil industry, and forestry among other possible subtopics), Housing & Urban Planning, Japanese Americans (and Asian Americans, Generally, particularly regarding farming in the shadow of the Alien Land Laws), Mining, Railroads (especially the shoot-out at Mussel Slough), and Water (without which most of the land is of course unusable), among other possibilities.

Latinos [return to list]

Aside from references to the 19th-century Californios and their loss of their land, Mexican Americans and other Latinos appear to be entirely missing from Fritz & Bakkens original 1988 article.[293] From a present-day perspective, this likely would seem a rather glaring omission in a state moving rapidly toward having a majority-Hispanic population. Yet it is also testimony to how times have changed, and academic history and legal history with them. In 1970, Californias Latinos accounted for an estimated twelve percent of the states population,[294] and it took a while before the Latino empowerment movement from the 1960s onward, as well as Hispanic Californians growing demographic presence, were reflected in legal history scholarship.

At any rate, in the interim, numerous scholars and studies have helped to fill that gap, covering a wide range of topics from the 19th and early 20th centuries[295] as well as the postwar period.[296] Certain topics concerning Latino legal history have drawn clusters of studies, including the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial of Hispanic youths in 1940s Los Angeles,[297] the downfall of miscegenation laws in California,[298] the crucial and historic role of Californias Latinos in school desegregation litigation,[299] postwar conflict between Los Angeles police and the Chicano Movement,[300] the rise of Hispanic political representation especially in the form of trailblazing California state legislator Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles,[301] the participation of Latinas in Californias Latino/a civil rights movement,[302] and Proposition 187, the 1994 initiative that particularly targeted undocumented Hispanic immigrants.[303] As with so many other topics in this bibliography, much more of the story of Mexican-American and Latino legal history in California remains to be told, but clearly many scholars have made a good start. For more on the Latino legal experience in California involving agriculture, agricultural labor, and the rise of the United Farm Workers union, see also Agriculture; Labor (agricultural). See also Spanish/Mexican California; Border; Race & Racial Politics, Generally.

Law & Economics [return to list]

Analysis of California history from a law and economics perspective is so heavily centered on examples from the California Gold Rush that readers are advised to see also Gold Rush; a handful of examples of historical law and economics scholarship not entirely focused on the Gold Rush are also listed there.

Law Firms [return to list]

Fritz & Bakken in 1988 noted the existence of various histories of law firms,[304] particularly one regarding one of the largest and oldest Los Angeles law firms, OMelveny & Myers.[305] They also commented on the limited scope and usefulness of such in-house publications. Law firm histories likely will long remain more self-celebratory than critical, because firms generally do not allow outside scholars and researchers to gain access to their files, many (and almost certainly the most interesting) of which concern confidential client matters. Nevertheless, at least two additional in-house histories of two long-established major California law firms  the now-defunct Heller Ehrman of San Francisco and the still-thriving Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher of Los Angeles  appeared soon after the 1988 article,[306] along with a recent in-house history of Los Angeles-based Sedgwick Detert Moran & Arnold,[307] an oral history of San Francisco-based Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro,[308] a masters thesis regarding the Long Beach law firm of Ball, Hunt, Hart, Brown & Baerwitz,[309] and, most recently, an article on the Los Angeles entertainment law firm Loeb & Loeb.[310] Several doctoral dissertations also have appeared that study particular aspects of the history of Silicon Valley law firms and legal practice during the postwar period that saw the rapid rise of the California high-technology industry.[311] The history of law firms remains a potentially rich area for further study  if one can access the records. Practically speaking, most such research likely will remain either in-house or limited to 19th-century records already available in publicly accessible archives.

Law Libraries [return to list]

At least some of Californias law libraries and library systems have received at least some scholarly attention.[312] See also Archival/Bibliographic; Education (legal).

Lawyers & the Legal Profession [return to list]

Fritz & Bakken in 1988 listed a number of histories of local or statewide bar associations,[313] along with a few examples of memoirs of individual attorneys[314] and even fewer studies of the history of California lawyers from a more social-scientific perspective.[315]

Since 1988, various other accounts and biographies of California lawyers have appeared or resurfaced, concerning attorneys active in the 19th century[316] or later.[317] Californias district attorneys so far seem perhaps to have drawn less scholarly attention than they deserve, but in addition to articles and biographies concerning the likes of Hiram Johnson, Earl Warren and Edmund G. Brown, Sr., there are some sources regarding others who have filled that office.[318] Scholars also have studied the history of legal aid organizations in California (see also Labor (agricultural) regarding that topic).[319]

Some California lawyers are today remembered much more as literary figures than as attorneys  such as John Rollin Ridge, the Native-American author of what is generally considered the first California novel and one of the first novels written by a Native American;[320] Francisco Ramírez, the Californio newspaper editor and attorney who treasured the rights proclaimed under the (Anglo-) American Constitution but called for their fuller expression and extension, including to non-Anglos;[321] and Carey McWilliams, the radical reformer who championed exploited farm workers, the interned Japanese Americans, and the young Hispanic defendants in the Sleepy Lagoon case before spending twenty years as editor of The Nation[322]  but all three men were trained as lawyers, and the legal profession has a right to claim them.

Some other notable California attorneys who have stimulated a number of scholarly studies include Earl Warren, who was a district attorney before being elected state attorney general and governor but who never served as a judge in California and is not included with the other Judges in this bibliography only for that reason (but U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren is of course probably the most famous Californian ever to become a judge);[323] Hiram Johnson, who was a district attorney before serving as state governor and a U.S. Senator;[324] Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, Sr., like Warren a district attorney and then California attorney general before he became a legendary state governor;[325] his rather well-known son, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown, Jr.;[326] and the San Franciscobased 20th-century super-litigator and King of Torts, Melvin Belli.[327] There are also a number of studies of Californias women attorneys, particularly the very first and most famous of all, Clara Shortridge Foltz,[328] among others.[329]

Although most studies concern individual lawyers, there are also at least a few published accounts of local legal culture of the bench and bar from several different jurisdictions to supplement Schucks century-old book cited by Fritz & Bakken.[330] See also Humboldt County and San Diego County for additional descriptions of lawyers and local legal culture. See also Courts; Judges; Law Firms; Notorious Cases (among other possibilities).

Some other California lawyer-politicians whose careers were almost entirely federal and who generally did not appear in searches regarding specifically California legal history as such, such as Representative Philip Burton or Richard Nixon, are not included in this bibliography, but readers should be aware that of course articles and biographies exist concerning such individuals and their impact upon California politics and, probably to some extent, law.[331] Still other notable California lawyer-politicians who were active in state politics, such as former Governor George Deukmejian and longtime Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, appear not to have drawn much attention from biographers yet. See also Nonlawyer Politicians.

Legal Doctrine & Theory, Odds & Ends [return to list]

Because some items may not necessarily fit neatly in other categories, here is a miscellany of such articles regarding various topics in legal history and the evolution of legal doctrines and theory that should not be overlooked.[332] It also includes just a few examples of the sorts of useful discussions of historical background that may be included in legal treatises that are focused on certain fields of the law but are not primarily concerned with legal history.[333] (Researchers may often turn up such historical discussions in treatises or law journal articles focused on certain cases or areas of the law that likely would never show up in online searches targeting legal history in general, and nonlawyer researchers in particular should be aware of this additional search strategy for specific topics in legal history.)

Local Government [return to list]

Many scholars have studied local government in California and its associated legal historical aspects, focusing especially but not exclusively on the two principal metropolitan cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco.[334]

Los Angeles [return to list]

The (ironically named, as people often point out) City of the Angels, the younger but now even larger of Californias two great metropolitan areas and legal markets, surfaces in many different headings in this bibliography, including many sources that may not focus primarily on Los Angeles or Southern California (in the conventional sense of: Greater Los Angeles). However, for the convenience of researchers especially interested in L.A., here are various categories of sources that do concern Los Angeles directly, organized under the following sub-headings, in mostly alphabetical order: Los Angeles Attorneys, Law Firms & Bar; African Americans; Crime; Early; Education; Gays, Lesbians & Others; Housing & Urban Planning; Jews; Immigration & Internal Migration; Land; Latinos; Local Government; Oil; Police; Race, Generally; Railroads & Light Rail; Smog; Various; Water; Women & Children.[335] Because Angelenos typically (and perhaps imperialistically) view nominally independent nearby jurisdictions such as Pasadena or all of Orange County as really just extensions of Greater Los Angeles, some sources concerning such neighboring communities in Southern California are also included. To prevent this heading from getting too long, readers are directed to other headings in the main bibliography for other parts of the Los Angeles story, such as: Hollywood; Latinos; Notorious Cases (O.J. Simpson, the Black Dahlia case, local serial killers and celebrity murders, etc.); and Water (Owens Valley and other sub-headings).

Medical [return to list]

Like some other legal history research topics that have flowered over the past two decades, the legal history of medical issues was absent from Fritz & Bakkens original article but since 1988 has grown into a significant, diverse, and interesting research area including a range of subtopics such as public health, health care, medical insurance, and many others. Along with books covering vaccination and the racial dimensions of public health policy,[336] various scholars, including Prof. Lawrence Friedman and his coauthors,[337] have focused their attention on civil commitment and other medical/psychological issues requiring court determinations.[338] Other medical legal history subtopics that have drawn clusters of studies include different aspects of the relationship of Chinese Americans with medicine and medical or public health policy,[339] womens reproductive rights,[340] anti-smoking ordinances and campaigns,[341] drugs and substance abuse,[342] and medical insurance.[343] Other single books, dissertations, or articles address a kaleidoscopic range of issues from early eugenic policies and experiments at San Quentin and a 1924 veterinary emergency to stem cell research in the early 21st century.[344]

Mining [return to list]

In 1988, Fritz & Bakken noted, The history of law for Californias mineral wealth has not been completely explored.[345] That would appear to be still the case, and even Prof. Bakkens 2008 book on the 1872 federal mining law focused more on other western mining regions than specifically on California.[346] At any rate, in addition to the various sources listed in the original article,[347] there have been numerous other scholarly contributions to the history of mining law in California,[348] which notably involves minerals other than just gold.[349] See also Gold Rush.

Monetary Policy & Alternative Currency [return to list]

Not a major theme in California legal history, and not likely to be unless Bitcoin or something similar goes a lot farther than it has to date  but some historians have investigated instances of California challenging federal monetary policy, and legal tender, by use of alternate media of exchange.[350]

Nonlawyer Politicians [return to list]

Certain studies of nonlawyer politicians that were identifiable as especially likely to contain significant discussion of legislative and legal history are listed here.[351] Although not included here, there are, of course, many other biographies and articles regarding other notable California nonlawyer politicians, including the likes of James D. Phelan, James Rolph, and Upton Sinclair, among others, along with probably countless other sources concerning Ronald Reagan; some of these may also help to illuminate certain aspects of California legal history, so readers and researchers should be aware of such resources. For more regarding notable California politicians, see also Lawyers and (in some cases) Judges.

Notorious Cases [return to list]

One ironic aspect of studying legal history is encountering numerous court cases that may have been called the case of the century in their day but are scarcely remembered in ours. Yet such cases that generated screaming newspaper headlines and notoriety, locally, statewide, or nationally, are a part of legal history, and California has had perhaps more than its share. Treatments of such cases are more likely to be journalistic than scholarly in the traditional, heavily footnoted, monographic sense; yet certainly some of these true crime accounts are also well-researched and of relatively high quality. Some also focus intensely on the legal and courtroom aspects of the cases, and a fair number are written by former attorneys, often ex-prosecutors. The single most famous example of the latter category is Helter Skelter (1974)  still the all-time best-selling true-crime nonfiction book  written by Vincent Bugliosi, who was the lead prosecutor in the infamous Charles Manson murder case.[352] As to other, more recent cases of the century, the interminable, televised O.J. Simpson trial of 19941995 spawned a sizeable publishing industry all its own;[353] other especially popular topics have included the 2002 murder of pregnant Laci Peterson and the 2004 trial of her husband, Scott Peterson,[354] and the never-officially-solved 1947 murder and mutilation of Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia.[355] Serial killers remain objects of perennial public fascination, and California has had more than its share of them, too, whose stories have been told, including the likes of Charles Ng, Dorothea Puente, Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, and Hillside Stranglers Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono, among others.[356] Books also have been written about many other California murders and trials, celebrity or otherwise.[357] Other notorious California cases not involving murder that have received book-length treatment include that of a Pasadena funeral home that stole gold fillings and illegally harvested organs from the deceased, the 1946 San Francisco prosecution for treason of California native Iva Toguri DAquino (Tokyo Rose), and the McMartin alleged child abuse witchhunt of the 1980s (in its day reportedly the longest and most costly criminal trial in American history), among others.[358] For additional notorious cases, see also Crime (murder and other subtopics).

Okies [return to list]

Along with the legal histories of racial and ethnic minorities and foreign immigrants, scholars have also studied legal aspects of the migration from Oklahoma to California during the 1930s.[359]

Oral Histories [return to list]

Many oral histories of judges, attorneys, court staff members, law school deans or professors, and other participants in California legal history are mixed among other headings in this bibliography (especially Judges; Lawyers; Courts; and Education). Here, however, is a list of some of the organizations and institutions that have been active in conducting, recording, and transcribing these oral histories, and that researchers may want to check for their existing oral interviews as well as periodic new additions. Although these are some major and active programs, they are not necessarily the only ones.[360]

Police & Law Enforcement [return to list]

In Memoriam: In April 2011, the California legal historical community lost one of its most notable historians of policing and law enforcement, and especially of the often colorful history of law enforcement in San Francisco  Kevin J. Mullen, who rose from being a cop on the beat to deputy chief of police in San Francisco before spending his retirement as a prolific historian of the police force and city he served for decades. Here is a list of his works concerning the history of crime and law enforcement in San Francisco, California, and the West more generally.[361]

In 1988, Fritz & Bakken limited their discussion of law enforcement mostly to the San Francisco Vigilance Committees of 1851 and 1856 and listed a number of sources that address either or both.[362] Since then, additional treatments of San Francisco vigilantism have appeared and have extended the story through the First World War.[363]

Regarding California policing more generally, Fritz & Bakken listed a few resources.[364] There are now many more studies of California law enforcement, covering various topics and localities during Californias early frontier decades,[365] the more settled period from the late 19th to the early 20th century,[366] and the postwar years,[367] along with biographies of notable early police chiefs, marshals, and detectives.[368] The recurring late-20th-century police scandals and crises of the Los Angeles Police Department form a substantial topic in themselves.[369] Various scholars have explored the interaction of police with racial, ethnic, or other minority communities.[370] Scholar Kevin Mullen devoted particular attention to the policing of San Franciscos Chinatown.[371] Other studies focus on the experiences of women police officers in California.[372] Finally, scholars also have explored examples of Californians taking the law into their own hands through the extreme, disturbing, quasi-legal practice of lynching.[373] See also Crime; Prisons & Parole.

Prisons & Parole [return to list]

Numerous scholars have contributed studies of the history of prisons and punishment in California, including subtopics such as the original construction of the states prisons and prison system, penal reform, juvenile justice, women prisoners, racial differentials in time served, private prisons, Supermax prisons (particularly the facility at Pelican Bay), and over-punishment.[374] Other scholars have studied the history of the states parole system and policies.[375] See also Crime; Courts; Children/Juveniles.

Progressive Era & Progressivism [return to list]

Sources concerning California Progressives and Progressivism of the early 20th century mostly are mixed among various other topics in this bibliography. Here, however, are some sources that specifically address the Progressive Era, Progressivism, particular notable Progressives, or trademark Progressive policy issues or reforms (some of which are no longer seen as particularly progressive).[376] See also Lawyers (Hiram Johnson), Women (suffragism and Clara Shortridge Foltz, among others), Labor, Japanese Americans (alien land acts), Chinese Americans (immigration restriction and exclusion), etc.

Propositions/Initiative, Referendum & Recall [return to list]

California is somewhat famous, or notorious, for its efforts at direct democracy, the pros and cons of which have been much discussed by political scientists. Some scholars, including California Supreme Court Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, have studied the history of Californias initiative and referendum process overall.[377] Others have examined the history of particular propositions, including well-known ones such as Proposition 8 (the 2008 anti-gay marriage initiative),[378] Proposition 9 (the 2008 Victims Bill of Rights Act also known as Marsys Law),[379] Proposition 13 (the landmark 1978 tax limitation measure),[380] Proposition 14 (the at least tacitly racist 1964 initiative to repeal the 1963 Rumford Fair Housing Act),[381] Proposition 187 (the 1994 initiative targeting undocumented immigrants for denial of public services),[382] and Proposition 209 (the 1996 measure that sought to abolish affirmative action),[383] along with less famous initiative battles concerning sundry issues such as stem cell research, mandatory education spending, the short-lived blanket primary election system, sex trafficking and registration of sex offenders, criminal youth gangs, and gay teachers.[384]

Race, Racial Law & Politics, Generally [return to list]

Although most studies tend to focus on a particular racial or ethnic group, many scholars have offered wider overviews of race and the law in California history. Many such studies concern the 20th century and especially the postwar period,[385] but scholars also have actively explored general racial discrimination in earlier times.[386] For more regarding race, racial discrimination, and racial politics and law, see also, of course, headings for various specific racial or ethnic groups, as well as Crime; Education; Housing & Urban Planning; and Labor, among other possibilities.

Radicalism, Antiradicalism & the First Amendment [return to list]

In their 1988 article, in their section regarding criminal law, Fritz & Bakken observed that other than the early work of Lawrence Friedman and his co-authors, studies of the history of criminal law in California basically focused on either the early San Francisco Committees of Vigilance or early 20th-century radicalism and antiradicalism, particularly the World War Iera bombing trial of Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings and its aftermath. They listed a significant number of sources regarding the Mooney case,[387] along with one focused on the trial of Anita Whitney, the radical socialist niece of Justice Stephen J. Field.[388]

Since then, along with additional studies of the Mooney or Whitney cases,[389] historians have addressed a variety of legal history topics regarding radicalism, antiradicalism, and free speech in California, including the repression of the International Workers of the World (the Wobblies) in the 1910s,[390] the Los Angeles Times bombing case of 1911 that almost cost Clarence Darrow his career,[391] McCarthyism and loyalty oaths in education,[392] and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement of the mid-1960s,[393] among other eclectic and interesting topics.[394] Regarding the First Amendment and religion, see also Religion, Free Speech & the First Amendment.

Railroads [return to list]

Except for historians of the 19th century, who are already well aware of these facts, it sometimes may be hard for historians of later periods or people in general to understand the extent to which railroads, especially the Southern Pacific, dominated California politics and government for decades as the largest landowner and the biggest, most powerful economic institution in the state. Indeed, throughout the American West, railroads, and railroad access, effectively determined whether a town lived or died, and frequently, the railroads effectively owned and controlled local governments as well as state governments, along with much of the land in a given western state. They also generally had the best, highest-paid lawyers who often wound up as judges, hearing arguments from other railroad attorneys in the frequent litigation over land titles, torts, contracts, and other matters arising from the construction and operation of the 19th centurys monumental achievements in terms of both engineering and business organization.

Thus there is a major overlap between the history of railroads and California legal history in the 19th century. Some sources specifically address legal history,[395] while others offer broader histories of California railroads in which the legal is interwoven with other matters.[396] The (in)famous 1880 shoot-out at Mussel Slough, resulting from a dispute over land titles between settlers and the railroad, was the second deadliest such shoot-out in the history of the American West and has received a good deal of general and legal historical attention.[397] By the 20th century, as the imperial power of the long-haul railroads began to wane, legal entanglement and litigation sometimes shifted to urban light rail systems instead.[398] Somewhat disappointingly, outside the area of air pollution, the searches for this bibliography turned up only one relevant, California-specific example of legal history involving automobiles, even in the most car-obsessed state in the Union  so that appears to be an area of the history of California transportation law waiting to be explored.[399] The same goes for aviation, an industry with important, special historical connections to California.

Reapportionment [return to list]

Various scholars have examined the legal and judicial as well as political and racial dimensions of reapportionment.[400]

Regulation & Administrative Law [return to list]

Some scholars have looked into the history of regulation and administrative law in California. Mansel Blackford, in particular, extensively explored the early regulation of business, banking, railroads, insurance, utilities, and other industries during the Progressive Era,[401] while other scholars have investigated other topics from later periods, such as the history of Californias Administrative Procedure Act.[402] The most dramatic example of regulation and deregulation from recent times  the energy deregulation that led to the statewide energy crisis of 20002001  has also received attention,[403] along with earlier issues involving Californias energy regulations.[404]

Religion & the First Amendment [return to list]

Historians have explored many examples of religious minorities  usually Jews, sometimes Catholics  challenging the Protestant Anglo majoritys religious norms, and often winning in the end, on issues from sectarian texts in California schools to Sunday Blue Laws,[405] along with other discussions of other issues relating to other religious denominations or minorities.[406] Regarding free speech not associated with religion, see also Radicalism, Antiradicalism & the First Amendment. See also Catholics & Catholicism; Jews.

San Diego County (Local History) [return to list]

As noted above, San Diego County, along with Humboldt County, is one of the prizewinners for the quality and quantity of its local legal history. As with Humboldt County, where the local history coverage is mostly in the Humboldt Historian, the Journal of San Diego History carries most of the local legal history
