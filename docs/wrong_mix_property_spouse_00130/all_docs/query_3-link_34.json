I adore Amy Poehler, could barely bring myself to write the post on her breakup with Will Arnett, and generally want to let her do her thing in private. If she would want me to, I'd shadow her on her return to the dating world, carrying a large Chinese screen to shield her from the paparazzi's view. But I need to quickly share my extreme excitement over this news of whom she might be dating. We'll acknowledge it, we'll do our tiny screams, and we'll move on. Apparently, Amy was spotted at cozy-dinner with Nick Kroll, a.k.a. Ruxin from The League/star of Comedy Central's Kroll Show/Nick Miller's brother on New Girl. In other words, this is a match made in comedy-nerd heaven, and you don't see that every day. I guess that Mr. Kroll is not, as his Parks and Rec recurring character suggests, \"the Douche.\" Sigh. I'm happy. America's happy. What do you think of this matchup? Photo: NBC, FOX",
