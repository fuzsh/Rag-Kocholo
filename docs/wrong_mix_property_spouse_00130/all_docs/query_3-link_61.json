        "text": "Get ready to \"treat yourself\": Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler is heading out of Pawnee to write a book.\n\nThe former Saturday Night Live comedian and founding member of the Upright Citizen's Brigade, who recently co-hosted of the Golden Globes with friend and successful memoirist Tina Fey, has signed a deal with It Books to write an unconventional memoir with \"universal appeal.\"\n\nThe book, inspired by Poehler's interest in \"helping young women navigate the adult world,\" will take shape as an illustrated, non-linear diary filled with both fictional anecdotes and life lessons. It's scheduled for release in fall 2014.\n\nPoehler, 41, plays ambitious Indiana government worker Leslie Knope on NBC's Parks and Recreation and has appeared in movies including Baby Mama and Mean Girls. Her personal life made headlines in September when she and her husband of nine years, Will Arnett, ended their marriage.\n\nWhile this is Poehler's first book, her Parks and Rec alter ego Leslie Knope \"wrote\" the humor book Pawnee: The Greatest Town in America. The book (actually written by Nate Di Meo), was nominated for the 2012 Thurber Prize for American Humor.\n\nPoehler's memoir announcement is the latest in a trend of memoirs written by female TV comedians. In 2011, Fey wrote the best-selling memoir Bossypants, and Poehler's fellow SNL star Rachel Dratch wrote the 2012 memoir Girl Walks Into a Bar. The Office and Mindy Project star Mindy Kaling and Chelsea Handler have also successfully leveraged their TV work."
