        "text": "I remember chuckling at some of the Twilight fans that were so broken up when Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson’s fairy tale romance was ripped apart. But then yesterday happened, and I read the news that Amy Poehler and Will Arnett are no longer together.\n\nI’m not joking. I feel… sad. And I’m not alone. “It’s ridiculous just how much the Amy Poehler/Will Arnett split is bumming me out. I’m listening to Sigur Ros, staring at the wall, numb,” tweeted EW’s Darren Franich.\n\nHyperbole, sort of, yet the couple — who had been together for nine years and have two young sons — was adored by just about everyone — certainly by fans of Saturday Night Live, Arrested Development, and NBC’s Thursday night comedies. They were cute together, but more importantly, they were hilarious. Maybe I’d want to go to Cannes with Brangelina, but I would’ve wanted to live around the block from and barbecued with the Arnetts. Any list of Funniest Celebrity Couples had them at or near the top.\n\nWith this sad news, that title is now vacant. I’m tempted to crown one of Poehler’s Parks and Recreation co-stars the new Funniest Celebrity Couple. There’s Nick Offerman, who’s married to Megan Mullally. And there’s also Chris Pratt and Anna Faris, who recently became parents for the first time. Pratt/Faris might get the nod, if only because of the following tweets:\n\nGood news: Your baby has ten fingers and ten toes. Bad news: They are growing out of her face.\n\n—\n\nchris pratt (@prattprattpratt) September 07, 2012\n\nOur kid doesn't have any fingers or toes growing out of his face. But thank you sweet people for your concern. #thoughtful #NoToeFace\n\n—\n\nchris pratt (@prattprattpratt) September 07, 2012\n\nBut there are others to consider. Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann have mined their own marriage for laughs in movies like Knocked Up and the upcoming This is 40. Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt can shift gears, from slap-happy to dark comedy in an instant. And The Daily Show‘s Samantha Bee and Jason Jones seem like that crazy couple guaranteed to deliver a wild night on the town… but you’re always thankful you decided to drive your own car to meet up with them.\n\nWho would you vote as the new Funniest Celebrity Couple?"
