        "text": "Amy Poehler and Will Arnett’s former West Village condo seeks new life as a $24K/month rental\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nOne-half of this colorful condominium at 1 Morton Square was once home to former couple Amy Poehler and Will Arnett. In happier times, the celeb pair owned a portion of this condo before selling it for $2.2 million in 2007. After being combined, the condo listed for sale again for $10 million in May 2015. Though it's still for sale–at a reduced $7 million–the spacious four-bedroom pad is seeking yet another incarnation as a high-priced rental, asking $23,999 a month.\n\nHave another look\n\nAmid legal trouble, model Erin Heatherton re-lists West Village condo for $2.7M\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nExactly a year ago, former Victoria’s Secret model and ex Leonardo DiCaprio gal pal Erin Heatherton put her West Village apartment on the market for $2.85 million after the 1 Morton Square board sued her over excessively loud parties and delinquent condo fees. Unable to unload the two-bedroom spread, she then tried to rent it for $15,00 a month just a couple months later. Now, she's trying again to sell, this time re-decorating the interiors to be more chic than rustic and lowering the price a tad to $2,695,000. Could this have to do with the $10 million lawsuit she was hit with last month by her former stylist Clare Byrne over a clothing line that they never launched?\n\nCheck out the stylish digs\n\nOlsen twins’ former West Village penthouse hits the market for $25M\n\nBy Emily Nonko\n\nA massive penthouse with star power has just hit the market for a cool $25 million. The apartment, located atop luxury West Village condo 1 Morton Square, was previously owned by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. According to Curbed, the famous twins bought the pad for $7.3 million in 2009 while the building was still under construction, put it on the market soon after buying, and finally sold in 2010. Well-known New York developer Bruce Eichner of the Continuum Company was the buyer--for $7.7 million--and now he's looking to make quite the profit. The apartment is impressive, though, with interior details imported from France, a sculptural glass wine refrigerator, and a gallery to display art and sculptures.\n\nYou've got to see inside\n\nMeg Ryan scopes out a $28K/month West Village townhouse\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nJust a little over a month ago, Meg Ryan listed her super chic Soho loft for $10.9 million, which she bought in 2014 for $8 million from fellow actor Hank Azaria. Despite her love of revamping apartments--she recently told Architectural Digest, \"I love renovating. I think it's tied to living the actor's life... it’s a chance for me to bring my vision into the world.\"--Ryan may be opting to rent, as the Post reports that she was seen checking out one of the modern townhouses at the West Village's 1 Morton Square development, which is currently available for $28,000/month.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRent model Erin Heatherton’s rustic-chic West Village condo for $15K/month\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nBack in October Sports Illustrated and Victoria’s Secret model—and onetime Leonardo DiCaprio arm candy—Erin Heatherton put her renovated 1,345 square-foot, two-bedroom Village condo at 1 Morton Square on the market for $2.85 million; we don't know if her thorny relationship with the building's condo board has had anything to do with it, but the two-bedroom apartment's rustic-chic interiors like exposed beams, stacked wood in the kitchen and stunning La Cornue range, plus a massive custom walk-in closet, have not yet found the model buyer: The apartment is now on the rental market for $15,000.\n\nTake the tour\n\nModel Erin Heatherton runs afoul of condo board, lists her chic West Village pad for $2.85M\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nIf former Sports Illustrated and Victoria's Secret model—and onetime Leonardo DiCaprio arm candy—Erin Heatherton loves food and fashion, she must have followed her heart when she renovated the 1,345 square-foot, two-bedroom Village condo at 1 Morton Square. The just-rustic-enough interiors feature authentic details like exposed beams and stacked wood in the kitchen, but a La Cornue range and a massive custom walk-in closet are the stuff of dreams. Heatherton purchased the apartment in 2012 for $1.72 million, but reportedly her not-model behavior regarding loud music irked the condo board so much they sued her—and then there's the matter of her delinquent condo fees, according to the New York Post. She's now selling the pretty pad for $2.85 million.\n\nTour the surprisingly sedate apartment\n\nPro Golfer Cristie Kerr Gets a Hole in One With $6M West Village Condo Sale\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nIt's reported that pro LPGA golfer Cristie Kerr has over $15 million in career earnings, and it looks like her bank account is about to get even fatter, as city records show that she and her husband/agent Erik Stevens have sold their West Village condo for $5.9 million. The couple bought the impressive three-bedroom home at 1 Morton Square back in 2009 for $2.3 million, but then enlisted famed interior designer Thom Filicia to give the high-floor residence a luxurious, modern renovation that, according to the listing, cost more than $1 million.\n\nCheck it out"
