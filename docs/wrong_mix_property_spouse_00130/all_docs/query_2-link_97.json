        "text": "Amy Poehler and Will Arnettâ€™s former West Village condo seeks new life as a $24K/month rental\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nOne-half of this colorful condominium at 1 Morton Square was once home to former couple Amy Poehler and Will Arnett. In happier times, the celeb pair owned a portion of this condo before selling it for $2.2 million in 2007. After being combined, the condo listed for sale again for $10 million in May 2015. Though it's still for saleâ€“at a reduced $7 millionâ€“the spacious four-bedroom pad is seeking yet another incarnation as a high-priced rental, asking $23,999 a month.\n\nHave another look\n\nAmid legal trouble, model Erin Heatherton re-lists West Village condo for $2.7M\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nExactly a year ago, former Victoriaâ€™s Secret model and ex Leonardo DiCaprio gal pal Erin Heatherton put her West Village apartment on the market for $2.85 million after the 1 Morton Square board sued her over excessively loud parties and delinquent condo fees. Unable to unload the two-bedroom spread, she then tried to rent it for $15,00 a month just a couple months later. Now, she's trying again to sell, this time re-decorating the interiors to be more chic than rustic and lowering the price a tad to $2,695,000. Could this have to do with the $10 million lawsuit she was hit with last month by her former stylist Clare Byrne over a clothing line that they never launched?\n\nCheck out the stylish digs\n\nOlsen twinsâ€™ former West Village penthouse hits the market for $25M\n\nBy Emily Nonko\n\nA massive penthouse with star power has just hit the market for a cool $25 million. The apartment, located atop luxury West Village condo 1 Morton Square, was previously owned by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. According to Curbed, the famous twins bought the pad for $7.3 million in 2009 while the building was still under construction, put it on the market soon after buying, and finally sold in 2010. Well-known New York developer Bruce Eichner of the Continuum Company was the buyer--for $7.7 million--and now he's looking to make quite the profit. The apartment is impressive, though, with interior details imported from France, a sculptural glass wine refrigerator, and a gallery to display art and sculptures.\n\nYou've got to see inside\n\nMeg Ryan scopes out a $28K/month West Village townhouse\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nJust a little over a month ago, Meg Ryan listed her super chic Soho loft for $10.9 million, which she bought in 2014 for $8 million from fellow actor Hank Azaria. Despite her love of revamping apartments--she recently told Architectural Digest, \"I love renovating. I think it's tied to living the actor's life... itâ€™s a chance for me to bring my vision into the world.\"--Ryan may be opting to rent, as the Post reports that she was seen checking out one of the modern townhouses at the West Village's 1 Morton Square development, which is currently available for $28,000/month.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRent model Erin Heathertonâ€™s rustic-chic West Village condo for $15K/month\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nBack in October Sports Illustrated and Victoriaâ€™s Secret modelâ€”and onetime Leonardo DiCaprio arm candyâ€”Erin Heatherton put her renovated 1,345 square-foot, two-bedroom Village condo at 1 Morton Square on the market for $2.85 million; we don't know if her thorny relationship with the building's condo board has had anything to do with it, but the two-bedroom apartment's rustic-chic interiors like exposed beams, stacked wood in the kitchen and stunning La Cornue range, plus a massive custom walk-in closet, have not yet found the model buyer: The apartment is now on the rental market for $15,000.\n\nTake the tour\n\nModel Erin Heatherton runs afoul of condo board, lists her chic West Village pad for $2.85M\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nIf former Sports Illustrated and Victoria's Secret modelâ€”and onetime Leonardo DiCaprio arm candyâ€”Erin Heatherton loves food and fashion, she must have followed her heart when she renovated the 1,345 square-foot, two-bedroom Village condo at 1 Morton Square. The just-rustic-enough interiors feature authentic details like exposed beams and stacked wood in the kitchen, but a La Cornue range and a massive custom walk-in closet are the stuff of dreams. Heatherton purchased the apartment in 2012 for $1.72 million, but reportedly her not-model behavior regarding loud music irked the condo board so much they sued herâ€”and then there's the matter of her delinquent condo fees, according to the New York Post. She's now selling the pretty pad for $2.85 million.\n\nTour the surprisingly sedate apartment\n\nPro Golfer Cristie Kerr Gets a Hole in One With $6M West Village Condo Sale\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nIt's reported that pro LPGA golfer Cristie Kerr has over $15 million in career earnings, and it looks like her bank account is about to get even fatter, as city records show that she and her husband/agent Erik Stevens have sold their West Village condo for $5.9 million. The couple bought the impressive three-bedroom home at 1 Morton Square back in 2009 for $2.3 million, but then enlisted famed interior designer Thom Filicia to give the high-floor residence a luxurious, modern renovation that, according to the listing, cost more than $1 million.\n\nCheck it out"
