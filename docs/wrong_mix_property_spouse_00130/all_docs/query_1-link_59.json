        "text": "Amy Poehler and Nick Kroll have split up after two years of dating, US Weekly reports.\n\nThe two busy comedy stars gave one of the usual excuses for why they couldn”t make a go of it: They”re too busy with various upcoming projects. “Unfortunately, they just couldn”t make the relationship work with their schedules,” said an insider who is supposedly close to both the “Parks and Recreation” actress, 44, and the “Kroll Show” star, 37.\n\nPoehler is producing two TV shows, for ABC and NBC, as well as starring with Tina Fey in “Sisters,” a comedy film due out at Christmas. Kroll also has several film projects in the works.\n\nKroll was Poehler”s first relationship after she ended her marriage to actor Will Arnett, 45, in September 2012. Poehler and Arnett were married for nine years and have two children, Archie, 6, and Abel, 5.\n\nAnother source told Us in 2013 that Poehler had wanted to be in a relationship with another comedian who “gets” her.\n\nIn her 2014 memoir, “Yes, Please,” Poehler wrote that she had a boyfriend (Kroll) who knows how “to settle me” by putting his hand on her chest and telling her boring stories. “On one of our first nights together, I woke up apologizing for my snoring and he pulled out two earplugs he had worn to bed so he could hear what I was saying. It was one of the most romantic gestures I have ever seen.”"
