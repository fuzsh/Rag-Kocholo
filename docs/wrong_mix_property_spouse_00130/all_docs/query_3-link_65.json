        "text": "Hey All!\n\nToday I had the amazing opportunity to interview Will Arnett the voice of POD aka Arrietty’s father in the Disney animated film The Secret World of Arrietty! His character Pod is a traditional Little Person and angry with Arrietty for allowing herself to be seen by a human being. He knows how high the stakes are for his family and wants life to continue on the way it has been. This film is incredible and I’m so glad I could talk to one of the stars about it!\n\nHere are some Highlights from the interview I did with a few special bloggers!\n\nThe Movie of Secret World of Arrietty is Based on the Book “the Borrowers” were you familiar with the books prior to making the movie? Had you read the story?\n\nWill:\n\nI had not read the books. And I did not know a lot about these stories or the books before I got involved in this project. I was very new to all of it.\n\nYou’re best known for your comedy work. I’m Curious to Know how you came to be the stern but loving Pod in this film? It’s a little different from what you’re mostly known for.\n\nWill:\n\nWell it’s one of those things where the people who were involved in making the film, Disney first came to my wife and me and asked us to be part of it. And I was excited that they thought of me, especially for me to do something that is a little bit outside of what maybe people are used to seeing me in. But you know at the same time for many years have been a voice over guy and have done a lot of Voice over work and have been a part of many different films in the animation world for the last 10 years so I think they thought of all that work as sort of an entree that would allow me to do something like this which is a little more serious. I know a lot of people think of Pod as sort of stern or whatever, but I think of him as the steady hand in this story. I was just happy they thought of me in this way and I was excited to something a little out of my comfort zone.\n\nWhat is the process of working on a film like this? Is it most individual work? Did you get to read it as a cast to get a feel for the other characters. How did you record?\n\nWill:\n\nIt is individual. For the most part in animation you are on your own. In terms of when you record. It’s just the way it’s set up. Of course I had the luxury of knowing some of my castmates pretty well. For example my wife. So we were able to kind of talk about it a little bit, but you generally don’t really have that luxury.\n\nPrior to this film, were you familiar with the Miyazake or Studio Chibli Films? And if so what was your favorite one?\n\nWill:\n\nI had been familiar. The Studio Chibli has some pretty iconic film. I mean there is Spirited Away and Ponyo. I know they’ve made like 15-20 movies, I haven’t seen them all…But definitely Ponyo was the most recent. But Spirited Away was the first film of theirs I saw and I think we can all agree it was amazing. So when they asked me to be a part of this film, I jumped at the chance since I was such a fan.\n\nHappy Valentine’s Day Will!<—This was me!\n\nWill:\n\nOh thank you and same to you!\n\nWere you originally Drawn to the Character Pod because your a father as well and he’s a father so he’s a character that you can relate to? <—This was me!\n\nWill:\n\nI wouldn’t say I was drawn to the character necessarily, I would say once I started working on this film my performance was colored by it. What you don’t understand before your a parent is what it means to be a parent and what it means to have a child and that definitely changes your entire world view forever the moment your child is born. I wouldn’t have had the same perspective had I not been a parent when I started making this film. It definitely had an impact on me being a parent.\n\nI know this doesn’t have anything to do with Arrietty, but We’ve heard for years that there is going to be an Arrested Development Movie…Do you know anything about that? Can we hope?\n\nWill:\n\nThere is going to be a movie. We’re making a mini-series first some time this year and so we’ll have a mini series leading up to the film.\n\nDid you have the opportunity to Work and Record at all with your wife Amy Poeler at all during the making of this film? <—This was me!\n\nWill:\n\nWe did not. That wasn’t the way that it was set up. Unfortunately that was the way they recorded this film. And obviously talked about which is a luxury that you don’t usually get to even talk about it. So yeah we talked about it but unfortunately we didn’t have the opportunity to actually record together no.\n\nSo those are some highlights from the interview! He was awesome and so is this movie! And for all you Arrested Development Fans you heard it hear first there will be a mini series and movie!
