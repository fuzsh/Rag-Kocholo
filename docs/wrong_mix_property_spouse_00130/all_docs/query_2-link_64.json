        "text": "Amy Poehler is an Emmy Awards regular, and considering her 22 nominations and 2016 win for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her co-host role on Saturday Night Live, her ongoing success is clearly what keeps drawing her back time and time again.\n\nThe Hollywood tycoon, who started as a comedian but has since added actress, writer, producer, and director to her resume, has even presented at the annual event several times, most notably with bestie Tina Fey in 2013 and fellow comedian Amy Schumer in 2015.\n\nPresenting, receiving nominations, and winning awards aren’t all Poehler does at the Emmys, though — she also looks stunning on the red carpet, mixing up her style a bit each year but always delivering a fashionable look. As a celebrity who isn’t necessarily known for her style, a number of her looks are quite impressive, namely her shining art-deco gown circa 2014 and her simple yet sultry 2013 ensemble.\n\nThe comedic genius has attended the awards nearly every year since her first appearance in 2006, and that means she’s delivered 20 years of red carpet looks to relive as we eagerly await this year’s Emmys — read on for Poehler’s style evolution over the past two decades at one of the biggest events in Hollywood.\n\nStunning in Sequins (2024)\n\nPoehler opted for red sequins for the 2024 instalment on the Primetime Emmys.\n\nGlittering Gown (2022)\n\nAmy Poehler turned heads at the 74th Primetime Emmys, arriving in this glittering purple gown for all to marvel at.\n\nSultry & Sparkling (2021)\n\nAmy Poehler’s most recent Emmys look consisted of a silver-sequined maxi skirt and a silky black blazer belted at the waist, with nothing but stacked necklaces underneath. Her gold clutch purse added an extra bit of shine to her metallic ensemble.\n\nGlitzy in Gold (2019)\n\nClearly a fan of a metallic moment, Poehler attended the 2019 Emmys in a short-sleeved gold jumpsuit with a plunging neckline designed by Greta Constantine. She added chunky gold bracelets and a draping lapel to complete the look.\n\nBusiness Casual with Flair (2019)\n\nAttending Netflix’s 2019 Emmys afterparty, Poehler went with a simple business casual look — a white tee underneath a black blazer and trousers — but added flair via metallic sneakers and dangling earrings. She posed alongside Natasha Lyonne, who looked like a vision straight out of the 1970s.\n\nPower Suit & Pumps (2019)\n\nPoehler presented at the 2019 Daytime Emmys wearing a chic white blazer and trouser combination atop a high-neck black blouse, paired with pointed-toe stilettos.\n\nBlending Masculine & Feminine (2019)\n\nApparently 2019 was a busy year for Poehler regarding Emmys events! Photographed again with Natasha Lyonne with the addition of Clea DuVall at Netflix’s Emmy Nominee Toast gathering, Poehler donned a masculine business professional look with pops of femininity coming from her coral button-up and crocodile textured clutch.\n\nGilded in Green (2016)\n\nIn 2016, Poehler wore a sparkling sage-colored gown by Pamella Roland with various chunky gold accessories. While some called the look matronly, we think she looks lovely in this vintage-inspired number.\n\nEdgy Elegant (2015)\n\nNo one was calling Poehler matronly in her 2015 Emmys ensemble! Looking elegant and edgy in a chic Michael Kors gown with cutouts at the waist, the Hollywood tycoon paired the look with chunky bangles, dangling earrings, and a smokey eye.\n\nStunning in Silver (2014)\n\nMiss Poehler did not come to play at the 2014 Emmys either — she wowed in an art deco-inspired gown by Don O’Neill paired with jewelry by Lorraine Schwartz.\n\nDragon Couture (2013)\n\nThe comedy queen must have been really into Game of Thrones circa 2013 — she wore a simple black gown with embroidered dragons on either side of her waist at that year’s Emmy Awards.\n\nShimmering Star (2012)\n\nHer first Emmy appearance since her split with then-husband Will Arnett, Poehler’s outfit theme for 2012 was “sexy.” She wore a low-back gown with a plunging neckline by Stella McCartney, its shimmering fabric highlighting her hourglass curves.\n\nSubtle Shimmer (2012)\n\nPoehler also attended the Emmy Awards Nominee Reception in 2012 wearing a subtle, shimmering cocktail dress by Max Azria, paired with metallic gold pumps and bangles.\n\nMidnight Blue Magnificence (2011)\n\nOnce again in a metallic number, Poehler attended the 2011 Emmys in a gorgeous midnight blue gown by Peter Som with drop-style earrings.\n\nPretty in Pale Blue (2010)\n\nClearly a fan of Max Azria’s work, Poehler wore another of his designs at the 2010 Emmy Awards. The pale blue gown featured a flowing skirt and metallic detailing at the bust.\n\nMermaid Moment (2009)\n\nLooking so very 2009, Poehler wore a black mermaid-style gown with silver embroidery during her red carpet walk. It’s giving prom, but hey, it was fashionable at the time.\n\nRadiant in Ruffles (2008)\n\nThe picture of a glowing goddess, Poehler looked absolutely radiant at the 2008 Emmys. Pregnant with her and Will Arnett’s eldest son, Archie, the mama-to-be wore a feminine, flowing, floral-print gown with ruffled sleeves and a ruched bust.\n\nHalter Haute (2006)\n\nHalter had her moment in the early 2000s, and Poehler embraced the trend with elegance at her first Emmy appearance in 2006. Donning a pin-up-style hairdo with the sultry navy blue gown, Poehler’s ensemble has a timeless element to it."
