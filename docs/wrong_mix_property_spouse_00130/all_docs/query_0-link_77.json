        "text": "Ice T isn't really known for drastic hair transformations. Especially in recent years, he's pretty much kept to his standard buzz cut. But for a 2022 Saturday Night Live sketch, the Law & Order: SVU star debuted some locks that made him look virtually unrecognizable.\n\nRELATED: Patti LuPone's SVU Guest Appearance as a Corrupt Casting Agent Was A Show-Stopper\n\nIce T leaned into the House of the Dragon look on SNL with long, blonde hair\n\nGranted, the locks were just strands of a very well-made wig, but still, getting to see Ice T with shoulder-length blonde hair is iconic. He sported the wig for a sketch spoofing the Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon, which you can watch in the video, above.\n\nAnd peep Ice T's foray into blonde hair in the photo, below.\n\nIce T's hair here is made even more perfect with the white hat and dramatic jacket he's wearing. Maybe SVU can revive this look for an episode where Ice T's character, Fin, goes undercover. We can dream, right?\n\nIn reality, the closest Ice T will probably ever get to blonde again is posing in photos with his wife, Coco Austin, whose long, platinum blonde hair is one of her signatures. She and Ice have been married for over 20 years and share a daughter, 8-year-old Chanel.\n\nRELATED: Hilary Duff's Memorable Role on Law & Order: SVU Is Definitely Her Darkest Yet\n\n\"I couldn’t have picked a better partner,\" Ice T told InTouch about Austin. \"She pulls her weight and kills it in every department.\"\n\nOn the secret to their happy marriage, Ice revealed, \"We address problems quickly. She doesn’t say, 'I’m mad at you from last month.' How am I supposed to fix something if I didn’t know it was broken? And we compromise. If you want to win every argument and do whatever you want to do, there’s a name for that — it’s called being single!\"\n\nIce T on SVU\n\nLaw & Order: SVU just wrapped its landmark 25th season. Season 26 will premiere this fall on NBC and will see Ice T stepping back into Fin's shoes. Ice and his co-star, Mariska Hargitay (Olivia Benson), have an incredible friendship both on and off-screen."
