        "text": "Highest Rated: 96% The LEGO Movie (2014)\n\nLowest Rated: 12% Jonah Hex (2010)\n\nBirthday: May 4, 1970\n\nBirthplace: Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nA central character on Fox's offbeat comedy \"Arrested Development\" (Fox, 2003-06; Netflix, 2013- ), Will Arnett's eccentric George Oscar \"GOB\" Bluth II was an audience favorite that helped draw in cult-like devotees to the show. His portrayal of the middle-aged, aspiring magician and disliked son of a wealthy Southern California family marked Arnett's first high-profile acting role, though he had previously made a career as a voiceover artist. The show's success with the \"alternative comedy\" crowd set the tone for Arnett's future in quirky film projects where his clean-cut, 1950s looks made his smug villains and overconfident dimwits all the more subversively funny. He was often paired onscreen with his wife, Amy Poehler, to great comic effect, especially in the pair's roles opposite Will Ferrell and Jon Heder in the sports send-up \"Blades of Glory\" (2007). Arnett found further success voicing animated family hits like \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" (2006)\" and \"Horton Hears a Who\" (2008), as well as in mainstream romantic comedy features with \"When in Rome\" (2010). Arnett even managed the impossible - stealing scenes from comic powerhouse Alec Baldwin in his role of Devon Banks, the corporate and closeted gay competition of Jack Donaghy (Baldwin) to run General Electric on the Emmy-winning sitcom \"30 Rock\" (NBC, 2006-2013). Thanks to his infectious roles on \"Arrested Development,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Up All Night\" (NBC, 2011-12), Arnett had finally come into his own as a proven comedic commodity.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n96% Ratatouille 91% Who Killed Santa?
