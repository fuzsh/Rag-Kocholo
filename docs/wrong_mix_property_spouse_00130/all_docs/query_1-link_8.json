        "text": "The Set-Up\n\nAnn (Rashida Jones) sets Leslie (Amy Poehler) up on a blind date with a co-worker (guest star Will Arnett), which does not go as well as Leslie hoped. An old friend of Ann's (guest star Justin Theroux) makes Mark (Paul Schneider) feel insecure. This Extended Producer's Cut features extra footage with Guest Star Will Arnett, funny improvs, extra dialog with Ron and Tom, and an extra scene with Leslie and Ann! Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt also star.\n\nNo-Show\n\nWith Paulie in jail, Christopher becomes acting capo, but he gets off to a bad start with Patsy. Still troubled by Jackie Jr.'s death, Meadow contemplates taking a year off from college to travel. Meanwhile, Adriana is in a bind after ending her friendship with Daniele, and Silvio discusses a misunderstanding at a Newark riverfront construction site.\n\nLa Douleur Exquise!\n\nBig tells Carrie that he is moving to Paris for six months, Samantha introduces the girls to the hottest S&M restaurant in town, Charlotte's shoe fetish is counterbalanced, and Miranda meets a guy who only enjoys sex when he is at risk of being caught."
