        "text": "Ask Toronto's Will Arnett how he wound up in the romantic comedy When in Rome, opening Jan. 29, and he's got a ready answer: \"To tell the truth,\" the sardonic funnyman says, \"it was a relief that somebody wanted me to do something where I'm not the dick.\"\n\nThat piece of self-analysis may seem a bit ruthless, but self-deprecation comes naturally to an actor who made it through a troubled adolescence, a painful struggle to launch a career, and a battle with alcoholism that nearly wrecked everything.\n\nWhile playing wannabe magician George \"Gob\" Bluth II during three seasons of the cult hit Arrested Development – TV's portrait of the ultimate dysfunctional family that's now slated for a big-screen adaptation – Arnett moved from everybody's favourite guest-star sleazebag to becoming the go-to guy for a very particular type of 21st-century persona.\n\n\"I'm always attracted to characters who are a little bit flawed and a whole lot confident, and in that combination there is a potent elixir,\" observes Arnett from the Los Angeles home he shares with his wife, Amy Poehler, Saturday Night Live veteran and star of the popular comedy series Parks and Recreation.\n\nHis nefarious 30 Rock character, Devon Banks, springs to mind, as does Arnett's voice work as \"The Missing Link\" in Monsters vs. Aliens.\n\n\"Look around the world today,\" he continues. \"Everybody's kinda crazy, but they all think they're important and they all think they're celebrities. I'm fascinated by people like that. Yeah, I guess Gob was like that, but I thought he was just kinda pathetic.\"\n\nWhen In Rome was a totally different kind of experience. A comedic reimagining of the classic romantic film Three Coins In The Fountain, it finds Kristen Bell playing a loveless career girl who throws four coins (must be inflation) into a Roman fountain and finds a quartet of strange men becoming smitten with her.\n\nArnett is Antonio, a would-be artist who takes Bell as his muse and plasters naked murals of her all over Manhattan. He's a perfect stereotype, with bulging eyes and greasy dark hair tumbling everywhere.\n\n\"Amy was actually pretty disgusted by my hair,\" Arnett confides. \"She got really grossed out when I it got too funky and I let it dangle in the food when I came home.\"\n\nBut aside from that, he enjoyed working \"with a lot of really good people in a loose and funny atmosphere.\"\n\nIt's an interesting place for Arnett to land after a long and frequently complicated journey that started in Toronto, where he was born on May 4, 1970.\n\n\"I was a little bit Rosedale, a little bit Yonge and St. Clair,\" he quips, parodying the Donny and Marie \"country/rock `n' roll\" mantra.\n\nDespite many bios claiming that Arnett's father was CEO of Molson, that appointment didn't take place until the performer was well into his 20s. \"When I was a kid, my dad was a partner at Stikeman Elliott,\" recalls Arnett, evoking the legal consortium whose slogan is \"Canada's Top Business Law Firm.\"\n\nArnett tries to soft-pedal the amount of privilege in which he grew up, simply saying that \"I had nothing to complain about. Sure, I could manufacture hardship if you wanted, but I was really a very fortunate kid. I had a great family. Terrific brothers and sisters.\"\n\nHis childhood memories are of a kinder, gentler Toronto, where \"we never locked our front door and there was always a place for us to play hockey. I played competitively when I was a kid. I loved hockey. Still do. Go Leafs.\" The last is said with that trademark deadpan Arnett irony.\n\nBut despite the storybook façade, all was not well for young William. \"There were the seeds of serious trouble underneath. I was disgruntled, restless, caused all kinds of trouble. I probably had an undiagnosed case of ADD, but back then, they just thought you were a problem kid.\"\n\nSo, in 1981, his parents sent him were all problem boys from good WASP families went: to Lakefield College School near Peterborough. Arnett's voice shivers as he recalls its \"tough love\" approach. \"They would send you into the woods with a compass and a pack of matches to make your own shelter. You had to be good or you froze to death.\"\n\nBut even Lakefield lost patience with the troublesome Arnett. \"I had a real bad attitude, causing all kinds of trouble. Let's face it: I was a real pain in the ass and I finally got my butt handed to me.\"\n\nHaving your son sent home from Lakefield could be taken as a real admission of defeat, but Arnett's mother came to the rescue and enrolled him in the Subway II Alternative School, which \"allowed me to take theatre classes at the Maggie Bassett Studio (at Tarragon Theatre) and get credit for that. It turned things around for me. Finally, there was something I could put my energy into.\"\n\nArnett finally graduated from Leaside High School and went off to Concordia University in Montreal to study theatre, \"but it was a big mistake. I barely lasted one semester. What was I doing? Going to class and getting drunk. Back to the old me again.\" He returned to Toronto and did some commercials – \"You must find the one I did for Manwich. It's fantastic. Some of my best work,\" he deadpans – but it all seemed like a dead-end street. So he headed down to New York and studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute.\n\n\"I guess I knew deep inside, even back then, that I was destined to do comedy, and if I had been a smarter person I would have gone to Chicago and tried to join Second City. But oh no: I was Will Arnett and I was going to do something heavy and serious and people were going to notice me.\"\n\nHe switched to TV and landed some interesting guest spots on Sex and the City, Will and Grace, The Sopranos and – most memorably – Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. \"I played a child molester. My family loved that.\"\n\nThen there were a lot of pilots that never quite made it for one reason or another. Arnett's normally dark mood blackened even further. \"I went through some really tough times, living hand-to-mouth. You'd keep thinking there was this crack of daylight and that something would pluck you from this despair, but it never did. So I began to drink. A lot. Those were not my best days. I finally realized I only had two choices: get sober, or die. When things got tough, I had friends who were there for me and helped pull me out.\"\n\nHe met Amy Poehler and they got together, which improved the personal side of his life considerably, but the rest remained mired in gloom. \"I was in another down period. Not drinking, but things weren't working out for me professionally, while Amy was making it on SNL. I was dropped unceremoniously from one more pilot, and I thought, `Okay, that's it.'\n\n\"My agent called and said she had another script for me to read. I told her to forget it, but she insisted.\"\n\nGood thing she did, because it was the pilot script for a new series called Arrested Development. \"God, it was alarmingly good!\" says Arnett with awe. \"I even allowed myself to hope that I might get it. And – son of a bitch – I did.\"\n\nThe critically-acclaimed series saved Arnett's career, and now he's eminently employable, juggling feature films, TV guest spots and independent projects.\n\nOne of his most recently announced ventures has seen him partner with his Arrested Development co-star, Jason Bateman, and TV titan Ben Silverman's new Electus multimedia company to launch DumbDumb, \"a sponsor-driven advertising and production company\" that will rely on a strong Internet presence to provide everything from web clips to feature films.\n\n\"Basically that's what I love doing,\" laughs Arnett, \"screwing around with a lot of other funny dudes.\"\n\nAnd even though it took him nearly 40 years to turn that into a successful career, both Arnett and his fans are glad he finally did.\n\nSource\n\nWill Arnett is a proud father. Some might say he's even a bit overprotective of little Archie, his year-old son with wife Amy Poehler.\n\n\"I want my son to wear a helmet 24 hours a day,\" he tells PopEater, hilariously. \"If it was socially acceptable I'd be the first one to have my kid in a full helmet and like a cage across his face mask. I make my wife crazy with it because I'm constantly worrying, just because I know what an idiot I was when I was little.\"\n\nIn a tenaciously funny Q&A with us, the actor, who appears in the upcoming 'When In Rome,' talks up the joys of parenthood, he takes sides without taking sides in the Late Night Wars and cops to going rogue last week when he announced the 'Arrested Development' movie will actually-really-truly happen.\n\nSo in 'When in Rome,' you kinda play a stalker.\n\n(Laughs) Those are your words. I would describe him as a very persistent suitor.\n\nDid they hire you because of your past?\n\nThey just knew that I can get fixated, that I have undiagnosed ADHD and when I get fixated on something, I'm very tenacious.\n\nWere you tenacious when you were wooing Amy?\n\nYes, I definitely was. But in no way did I stalk her, according to the police report. I guess it was a mutual pursuit.\n\nAnd now you have a kid, Archie. Isn't it the best?\n\nI've got to say, it really is. As sort of clichéd as it sounds, it's just the best even though it's harder than I thought it was going to be because it's a human being that you're responsible for, so that's scary but even in it's scariest moments it's fantastic.\n\nAre you very overprotective?\n\nI want my son to wear a helmet 24 hours a day. If it was socially acceptable I'd be the first one to have my kid in a full helmet and like a cage across his face mask. I make my wife crazy with it because I'm constantly worrying, just because I know what an idiot I was when I was little.\n\nAmy's working full time. Are you a house Daddy?\n\nA little bit. It's been such a treat for me because I've spent the better part of the last six months writing a new TV show with Mitch Hurwitz (the creator of 'Arrested Development') and we were able to do a lot of work together from our place so I got to spend a lot of time with Archie. It's such a luxury.\n\nAre you going to kill yourself if he grows up and has a really bad sense of humor?\n\n(Laughs) There will be no deaths over that matter. Who knows what his attributes will be like but either way he's going to find me and my wife incredibly unfunny. He'll be over us by the age of five.\n\nYou confirmed the Arrested Development movie.\n\nI did. I gave it an official confirmation.\n\nWere you allowed?\n\nNo, not authorized to do it. I could be held up for treason. As of now there is no start date because we're still waiting for the script to be completed. Within the circle of people involved in the show everybody is in agreement to move forward once the script is done so hopefully we're going to start shooting sometime this year.\n\nAnything you can tell me about the script?\n\nI did tell the writers that maybe it should be revealed that Gob is like this higher power, this deity, this figure that it turns out is almost god-like.\n\nWell he does act like he is. I love that clueless confidence.\n\nThat kind of combination has always really fascinated me. Any time you come across somebody in life who is apparently clueless and yet has a kind of blind confidence, it really cracks me up. Gob was very much written that way. For me he was a godsend.\n\nMichael Cera. Did you have any idea he'd become such a big star?\n\nYeah, I mean nobody can predict the future except me but he's such a talented guy. From the moment I met him it was very apparent that he was a really smart and funny guy.\n\nDo you wish him the worst now?\n\nOh god yeah! No, honestly it couldn't happen to a kinder or more thoughtful person so I'm absolutely thrilled for him.\n\nDo you have to tone yourself down for shows like 'Parks and Recreation?'\n\nI think that if I'd come on that show in a Gob like manner I would have stuck out like a sore thumb. It would have been like someone screaming in a library. I tried as much as I could to appreciate the tone of the show and play the part the writers wrote.\n\nAre you Team Conan or Team Jay?\n\nI'm team life. Conan is a good friend and I love him. He's such an incredibly funny guy and on top of it to make matters better he's a genuinely nice guy. I love Conan to death.\n\nSounds like you're Team Conan.\n\nI don't know about all this team stuff. I don't really know Jay. I do know that you'd be hard pressed to meet a funnier guy than Conan.\n\nDo you have friends over and do standup?\n\nYeah we have a little exposed brick wall like the Improv and I'll invite people over for dinner and then I say, 'Why don't you sit down and I'm just going to do a tight 10.' I keep it topical, airline food, what's the deal with that?\n\nFavorite TV show?\n\nWe're still huge Law & Order fans. The original Law and Order 1.0. I watch it every night before I go to bed. My TIVO has at any given time 40 episodes on it. I don't watch it in an ironic or kitschy way. I find there's something really comforting about it. I'm a huge fan of Sam Waterson. I think he's so under recognized. I can't get enough of that show. As for new shows, I haven't really watched any of the new shows; I don't mean to sound like one of those jerks who say, 'I don't have a TV,' because I watch a lot of TV. I spend so much of my TV time either watching sports or playing video games.\n\nFavorite video game?\n\nI play Call of Duty almost exclusively. I like to think I'm pretty good but in the grand scheme of things no. You have no idea of the level of my sickness. I play with a bunch of other guys and we all talk to each other with our headsets. Oh yeah it's that bad. Listen, I'm not proud of it, I'm just sharing my experience with you in the hopes I'll get better.\n\nAnyone else famous in the gang?\n\nYou might find Jason Sudekis or John Krasinski or Rainn Wilson. I hate to bust their anonymity. We're all just super nerds.\n\nSource"
