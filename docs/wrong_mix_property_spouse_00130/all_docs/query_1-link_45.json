        "text": "I’ve been more than vocal about my undying love for “Parks and Recreation.” It’s the best show on TV; that’s actually a fact. I won’t gush quite yet.\n\nBut let’s rewind a little bit. My love for Amy Poehler runs much deeper and it starts way before “Parks” does and frankly there are TOO MANY reasons why I love her, so let’s see: I have to make a chronological timeline of the reasons why…\n\nAmy Poehler:\n\nYOU’RE THE BEST!\n\n1996:\n\n–Matt Besser, Matt Walsh, Ian Roberts and Amy (a.k.a. The Upright Citizen’s Brigade) come to New York from Chicago to perform their long-form improv show and start performing their unique sketches to new audiences.\n\n1998:\n\n– The Upright Citizen’s Brigade becomes a TV show on Comedy Central.\n\n1999:\n\n– The Upright Citizen’s Brigade Theatre opens in NYC, co-founded by Besser, Walsh, Roberts and Amy. The UCB Theatre features long-form improv and standup comedy and it’s been a huge hit, so much that they’ve opened a second theatre in L.A. The UCB Theatre is home to high quality comedic performances and is still crazy affordable by never charging more than $8 admission. It’s become one of the most respected comedy theatres in\n\nthe country.\n\n2001:\n\n– Amy joins the cast of “Saturday Night Live” and is one of only three people ever to be promoted from featured player to full-time cast member in her first season on the show (alongside Eddie Murphy and Harry Shearer). Amy is really versatile, able to play straitlaced Hillary Clinton with a shot of crazy, do a dead-on Rosie Perez impression and invent achingly funny characters like Kaitlin, an extremely enthusiastic and lispy preteen and Amber, a reality show contestant who is brash, cocky and rocks one leg.\n\n2004:\n\n– Amy guest stars in “Arrested Development” as Gob’s (her real-life husband Will Arnett) wife. In the episode called “Altar Egos,” Gob and Amy (who is nameless) get married after a series of escalating-out-of-control dares. Amy played Gob’s wife in five episodes over the three seasons “Arrested” aired.\n\n2008:\n\n– Amy leaves “SNL” to take care of her new baby Archie, which is an ADORABLE NAME.\n\n– Amy stars with Tina Fey in “Baby Mama” where she plays an irresponsible, childish surrogate mother for Tina Fey’s baby. It is a very good movie!\n\n2009:\n\n– “Parks and Recreation” debuts on NBC. It’s first season (6 episodes) is nothing grandly special, but…\n\n– When it comes back for it’s second season, it’s immensely better. It finds its stride and Amy’s character of Leslie Knope is markedly less Michael Scott-y and is instead extremely good at her job, goofy, smart, caring and dedicated. She’s a great role model even if she’s a little selfish. The show gets fairly widespread critical acclaim even if ratings aren’t great. The show is almost criminally funny and heartfelt. I fall in love.\n\n2010:\n\n– This time, Will Arnett guest stars on “Parks and Recreation” as a MRI doctor that Leslie gets set up with on a date. The date goes well and then we find out that Arnett’s character is quite a loon and he’s extremely passionate about MRIs. He’s so passionate that he takes Leslie to the hospital to give her a free scan and then sends her a bill for $2000 for it when Leslie ends the date early. I cry with laughter.\n\n2011:\n\n– Amy gets completely snubbed at the Emmy’s for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series (for “Parks”) for Melissa McCarthy. I drown my sorrows in J.J.’s Diner waffles (Leslie Knope’s snack of choice).\n\n–New York Magazine runs a retrospective for the 15th anniversary of the Upright Citizen’s Brigade with a photo slideshow of “Poehler-oids”, which are 30 polaroids of Amy in different makeup and costume at the UCB theater, in sketch performances and on the TV show. They are great!\n\nSo that’s a lot! She is literally the funniest person on the planet and I want her to succeed even more than she has, and I hope that you do now, too!"
