        "text": "Will Arnett and Jason Bateman‘s advertising and digital production company DumbDumb is behind the online talk show for Denny’s restaurants as well as campaigns for Orbit and Old Navy. They will produce up to six short-form comedy videos for TBS.com featuring sponsor integration and DumbDumb’s star power (Sarah Silverman, Amy Poehler, Will Forte and Kristen Bell have appeared in ads in the past) to push the video virally via Facebook, Twitter and YouTube among other platforms. The deal is in partnership with Ben Silverman’s studio Electus and will be promoted on TBS‘ stable of comedies like Conan, Family Guy and The Big Bang Theory as well as online properties like AdultSwim.com and NBA.com. “We are looking to innovate creatively together with our advertising partners and develop meaningful opportunities with multi-screen content that is smart, fresh and, in the case of TBS, extremely funny,” said Donna Speciale, president of Turner Entertainment and Young Adults Ad Sales. “Our exclusive partnership with DumbDumb offers select advertisers that sought-after environment through a strategic, portable distribution plan across television, digital and social media outlets.”\n\ndeadline-logo-svg Deadline\n\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\nYour Email\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.
