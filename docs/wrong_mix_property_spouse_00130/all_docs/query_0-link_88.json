        "text": "Amy Poehler and Will Arnett’s divorce has been finalised by a judge nearly four years after the comedians separated. The pair married in August 2003 and separated in September 2012 after nine years of marriage and the birth of two sons. They remained separated for a year and a half without any legal involvement until April 2014 when Arnett filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. At the time of the split, Poehler described divorce as “spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air,” adding that “The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin, and worrying what stuff will break when it lands.” Though her divorce from Arnett was \"too sad\" and \"too personal\" to discuss in detail, she had some insightful comments about divorce in general:\n\n\"When you are a person going through a divorce you feel incredibly alone, yet you are constantly reminded by society of how frequently divorce happens and how common it has become. You aren’t allowed to feel special, but no one knows the specific ways you are in pain.\""
