        "text": "There’s a science that goes into choosing when these Guides come out. Most are scheduled around birthdays, some based on the actor’s projects, and then the rest are scattered about. Will Arnett falls into that last bunch. There’s no rhyme and reason for featuring the man with one of the most distinguishing voices on the planet next to James Earl Jones. Okay, maybe his voice isn’t on the Mufasa level (yes, because The Lion King is far superior in my life than Star Wars), but it’s still one of the best. A good set of pipes aside, there are so many reasons developing as to why we love Will Arnett.\n\nName: William Emerson Arnett\n\nBirthday: May 4, 1970\n\nPlace of Birth: Toronto, Canada\n\nTwitter: @arnettwill\n\nBest Known For\n\nWill Arnett got his first gig almost 20 years ago in something most of us have never seen called Ed’s Next Move. Come the late 90’s and early 00’s, he started to gain traction in, getting spots in big shows like Sex and the City and The Sopranos. Then he went from background player to full on star in 2003 when Mitchell Hurwitz gave TV a show ahead of its time. Arrested Development lacked a laugh track, and according to my 10th grade English teacher, audiences weren’t smart enough to realize the humor – at the time. Then we all know it became a phenomenon in TV death and was resurrected a decade later. Anyways, being on a celebrated, yet cancelled show was a blessing. He went on to do some odd choices like Hot Road and Blades of Glory, but also made some right ones with The Lego Movie and Netflix’s BoJack Horseman.\n\n5 Quick Will Arnett Facts\n\nHe can speak fluent French.\n\nBack in the day he was a bit of a bad boy. He was so bad that his parents sent him to a boarding school when he was 12.\n\nAmy Poehler isn’t his first wife, she was his second. He was married to actress Penelope Ann Miller first.\n\nArnett’s a gamer. His favorite system is Xbox.\n\nHe’s got a ton of famous faces, including Arrested Development costar Jason Bateman, and Jerry O’Connell.\n\nReasons You Love Will Arnett\n\nHis voice makes goosebumps instantly arise. It’s one of your favorite sounds on the planet and because of that you’ve seen every animated movie he’s been a part of but you’re partial to The Lego Movie because let’s face it, BATMAN! When you aren’t swooning his natural gift, you’re binge watching that one show over and over again, but you’re also trying to figure out how to put him and Amy Poehler back together again.\n\nOh Arrested Development. You either were a TV nerd since birth and watched it when it first aired, or were like the millions of slackers (no offense) that didn’t take note until it was long gone and released on DVD. No matter how you stumbled upon it, it was love at first sight when it came to G.O.B.. Of course you crushed on Michael and George-Michael, but there was something about Arnett’s misogynistic yet endearing demeanor as the older brother forever on a segway who dabbled in magic. While you loved every character for their quirks, G.O.B.’s were just a step above and the reason you either tuned in every week until the end or lost a weekend of your life binging on borrowed DVDs.\n\nThere are those who watch his movies and shows and love him, but take it a step further and have gotten invested in his personal life. You argue that it was hard not to when he started dating, married and spawned with Amy Poehler. Your crush with your comical idol – could you have planned it to be anymore perfect? Then your heart and faith in love was rocked the day you heard they were splitting up. Now you’ve waged a war on any woman who comes into his life, as well as Nick Kroll – because no matter what, Will and Amy are your OTP and you had their GAP ad blown up and it resides in your living quarters to this day.\n\nReasons I Love Will Arnett"
