        "text": "Amy Poehler and Will Arnett are separating after nine years of marriage, US Weekly reports. The split is reportedly “amicable” for the couple, who wed in 2003 and have two children, three-year-old Archie and two-year-old Abel.\n\nTrending\n\nPoehler, 40, a Saturday Night Live alumna, currently stars on Parks and Recreation. Arnett, 42, plays Gob on Arrested Development (which returns next year), had a recurring role on 30 Rock as Jack Donaghy’s scheming corporate nemesis and is also currently on the cast of Up All Night. The pair’s joint credits include Blades of Glory, Spring Breakdown and Monsters vs. Aliens, as well as spots on each other’s shows.\n\nThe marriage was the first for Poehler and second for Arnett, who was wed to actress Penelope Ann Miller for a year in the Nineties."
