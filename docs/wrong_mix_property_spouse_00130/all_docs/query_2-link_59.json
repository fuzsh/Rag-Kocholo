        "text": "“Arrested Development” alum Will Arnett is back at Fox.\n\nArnett has sealed a rich, seven-figure development deal at the network, which will develop a sitcom around the Emmy-nominated thesp.\n\nArnett has already been providing a voice for Fox’s upcoming animated series “Sit Down, Shut Up.” But more recently, he’s been seen on NBC’s “30 Rock,” where he has recurred as network suit Devon Banks. That role earned him an Emmy nomination this year for outstanding comedy guest actor.\n\nMultiple networks pursued Arnett, who’s been a hot commodity since his stint as aspiring magician and family black sheep George “Gob” Bluth II in the cult fave “Arrested,” which also earned him an Emmy nom.\n\nArnett’s decision to move back to L.A. to star in a sitcom comes as wife Amy Poehler also preps a move out West to star in a new NBC sitcom from Greg Daniels and Mike Schur.\n\nThesp’s recent feature credits include “On Broadway,” “Semi-Pro,” “The Rocker,” “Blades of Glory” and “Hot Rod.” He’s also provided voices for “Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who,” “Ratatouille” and “Ice Age: The Meltdown.”"
