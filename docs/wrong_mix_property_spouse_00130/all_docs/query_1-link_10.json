        "text": "Education and career\n\nArnett briefly attended Concordia University in Montreal but dropped out after one semester. He later moved to New York, where he studied at the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. Arnett’s distinctive deep voice helped him build a steady career in voice-over as he auditioned for on-camera work. He went on to appear on several TV shows, such as Sex and the City, The Sopranos, and Will & Grace, but struggled both professionally and personally and developed a serious drinking habit. When his agent called with a script for Arrested Development, a show about a highly dysfunctional upper-class family, a dejected Arnett told her to forget it. She insisted, however, and he was won over by the pilot: “God, it was alarmingly good! I even allowed myself to hope that I might get it. And…I did,” he told the Toronto Star. He won the part of Gob Bluth, a bumbling professional magician, against actors Rainn Wilson and Alan Ruck.\n\nArnett said he loves playing characters who are both confident and dumb—a combination that Gob Bluth epitomizes. One of his trademark lines is an angry “C’mon!” Fans come up and yell “C’mon!” at Arnett, which he told The New York Times in 2018 is “very jarring. Or they’ll ask you to do the chicken dance at Penn Station. And you don’t want to because you’re at Penn Station.”\n\nArnett played an arrogant character in 30 Rock: Devon Banks, a ruthless network executive and rival to Jack Donaghy, played by Alec Baldwin. When The New York Times asked him in 2014 if he was worried about being typecast as the actor who portrays jerks, Arnett replied:\n\nI think people whose job it is to assess these kind of things seem to be much more preoccupied and/or worried about it than I am. I don’t really care. I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about the big picture. I’m just not interested in those kinds of characters right now. I’ve done it already.\n\nBut he admitted in a 2010 interview with the Toronto Star that when he landed a role in the rom-com When in Rome, “it was a relief” to be offered a more sympathetic part. Arnett has starred as a voice actor in several hit animated movies, including Ratatouille (2007), Despicable Me (2010), and Teen Titans GO! To the Movies (2018). He notably voiced the character of Batman in the Lego film and television franchise, including in The Lego Movie (2014) and its sequel, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019), and The Lego Batman Movie (2017). He hosts the Lego building competition show Lego Masters (2020– )."
