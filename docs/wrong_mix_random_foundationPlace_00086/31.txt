The pregnant 16-year-old sister of troubled pop star Britney Spears is engaged, it was reported Tuesday.

People magazine reported that Jamie Lynn Spears -- the star of the US television show "Zoey 101" whose pregnancy last year sparked a nationwide debate -- has been showing off an engagement ring to friends.

Her fiance is the father of her baby, boyfriend, Casey Aldridge, People said. "She's got an engagement ring," a source close to Spears told People. "She's been showing it off, talking about it."

Soon after confirmation of the pregnancy, Spears' mother Lynne shelved plans for a a book on parenting.

Lynne Spears had been due to release "Pop Culture Mom: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World" via publisher Thomas Nelson next month.
