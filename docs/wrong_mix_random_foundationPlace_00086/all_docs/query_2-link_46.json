        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears shares Maddie with her ex-fiancé Casey Aldridge and Ivey with her husband Jamie Watson\n\nJamie Lynn Spears is a devoted mom to two daughters: Maddie and Ivey.\n\nThe actress and singer was the star of the hit Nickelodeon show Zoey 101 when she discovered she was pregnant at 16. In June 2008, she welcomed her daughter Maddie at 17 with her then-19-year-old fiancé Casey Aldridge. Following her split from Aldridge, Spears married businessman Jamie Watson, and they expanded their family with daughter Ivey in April 2018.\n\nIn March 2019, Spears opened up to Dopple about how motherhood has evolved for her after giving birth to Maddie at a young age.\n\n“I don’t feel like a young mom at all now, but I guess that’s because I had my first daughter so very young. I use to be insecure at times, because I was always the youngest mom in the room,” she said.\n\nShe continued, “I quickly learned that being a good and competent mother has nothing to do with age. I have met some of the most wonderful amazing moms who are anywhere from 20 years old to 50 years old, so young or old, love is all it’s really about.”\n\nThe Sweet Magnolias star has a close bond with both of her daughters and often shares their milestones on social media. While they have interests outside of show business, Maddie and Ivey joined their mom on screen in July 2023 for a cameo in Spears’ reboot film, Zoey 102.\n\n\"Having my two girls be a part of this film and get to make their little debut cameo, if you will, it was so special because they got to do it together,” Spears told Entertainment Tonight. “Just seeing those two worlds collide, it was a really proud moment for me as a mom.\"\n\nHere’s everything to know about Jamie Lynn Spears’ children: Maddie and Ivey.\n\nMaddie Briann Aldridge, 16\n\nSpears and Aldridge welcomed their daughter, Maddie Briann, on June 19, 2008, at Mississippi Southwest Regional Medical Center in McComb, Miss. A few months later, the pair introduced their daughter to the world in a cover story for OK! Magazine.\n\n“I had a perfect pregnancy and a perfect delivery. There was no c-section. There were no emergencies. She was perfectly healthy. I had a normal, natural birth. I was very blessed,” Spears told the outlet about Maddie’s birth.\n\nShe continued, “She just looked at me, and she didn’t really cry at first. I was scared, and then she started screaming. It is the best feeling in the whole world.”\n\nSpears also revealed that Aldridge is the one who came up with the name Maddie and she “really liked it.” As for Maddie’s middle name, Briann, the pair decided on the moniker as a nod to Aldridge's cousin and close friend, Brian, who was killed in a car accident in June 2008, and Spears' older brother Bryan.\n\nWhen Maddie was 19 months old, Spears and Aldridge split, and the actress relocated to her home state of Louisiana. Speaking with PEOPLE in 2016, Spears opened up about how it “was scary” finding out she was pregnant at 16.\n\n“My biggest concern was, ‘Oh my goodness, I need to tell my mother and father and my family,' ” Spears told PEOPLE. “I was on a Nickelodeon show, so I felt responsible for what these young girls were gonna think looking up to me. I put myself in an adult situation, so I needed to handle it like an adult. My age was never an excuse for me.”\n\nIn February 2017, when Maddie was 8, she experienced an ATV accident at her parents' home in Louisiana. The vehicle she was riding flipped over into a pond, and Maddie was submerged underwater for several minutes before she was freed by first responders. Miraculously, she suffered no brain damage and was released from the hospital after a week.\n\nSpears later reflected on the near-fatal crash during an episode of Better Together with Maria Menounos in May 2020. \"That moment, I felt everything that you can feel, I think, as far as the worst,\" she said. \"There's nothing worse than looking at your child and just feeling that you've failed her. And I didn't want her to think that I couldn't save her.\"\n\nSpears added, “I've faced my worst fear now. What else can I mess up or do wrong that will be as horrible as that? Nothing. There's nothing. God gave me the blessing of giving me my daughter back … So I don't get to make any excuses. I've been given the best, biggest blessing you can be given.”\n\nSince her accident, Maddie has flourished into an accomplished student and softball player. She graduated from middle school in May 2022 and, two months later, won a World Series championship with her softball team. Spears praised her daughter’s accomplishments in a May 2022 Instagram post.\n\n“Sorryyyy, but I have to do a quick proud parent post for my 4 sport athlete who also kept a 4.0 GPA all year🏃🏼‍♀️👩🏼‍🏫🏅,” she wrote. “So proud of her work ethic as an athlete and as a student👏🏻.”\n\nWhen Spears joined Dancing With the Stars in September 2023, Maddie and her sister Ivey were on hand to support their mom. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress shared how it “meant everything” to have both of her daughters present.\n\n\"My youngest one, she did take a nap through most of the show, but she woke up for my performance,” she said. “And then my oldest one said that she teared up at the end. That made my heart feel like, really, I don't know. It was weird to see my 15-year-old be proud of watching her mom dance on TV.\"\n\nSpears also joked to the outlet that as a mom of a teen, she hasn’t “done anything right in about three years,\" but joining the competition show was a “bonding experience” for her and Maddie.\n\nIvey Joan Watson, 6\n\nSpears and Watson welcomed their first child together, Ivey Joan, on April 11, 2018, in Covington, La. A day later, Spears confirmed her daughter’s birth to PEOPLE and shared some insight into the newborn’s name.\n\n\"We are beyond excited to welcome this beautiful baby girl to our family!\" Spears said. \"Her middle name, Joan, is to honor my Aunt Sandra, who passed away 10 years ago from ovarian cancer. She was the most graceful woman I've ever known.\"\n\nThe Sweet Magnolias star also shared with PEOPLE how her daughters immediately forged a close bond. “Maddie was the first one to meet her after she was born,” she said, adding that the newborn “was so peaceful the moment her sister held her.”\n\nSpears continued, “I have never felt more complete in my life. It’s pure joy watching my girls fall in love.”\n\nThe actress later opened up to PEOPLE in May 2018 about how different her pregnancy with Ivey was from Maddie. While she said the first time around there was “a lot of chaos” surrounding her pregnancy, this time was “a really peaceful experience.”\n\n“I think the only difference is the support system I have around me,” she explained. “I’m much more sure of myself as a young mother [now]. As a new mother with your first child, you are questioning and guessing everything. And as you go into it the second time, you’re like, ‘I got this. I figured this out one time before; I can do it again.’ You have a little more confidence in yourself.”\n\nBy the time she was 3, Spears shared that Ivey had started taking ballet classes. She posted a carousel of photos of the toddler on Instagram, including a shot of Ivey practicing her dance moves in a black leotard.\n\n“Ivey’s FIRST year of dance, and I am already a full on dance mom🩰😢,” she wrote in the caption.\n\nIvey got the opportunity to show off her dance moves when she attended her first father-daughter dance with Watson in March 2024. Spears shared photos of the milestone on Instagram, which included a shot of Ivey’s colorful get-up: a tropical-inspired dress with birds printed on the front and matching multicolored boots.\n\nIn April 2024, Spears celebrated Ivey’s 6th birthday with an American Girl-themed bash. The party featured a three-tiered cake, a balloon arch and a craft station where guests could design clothes for their dolls.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
