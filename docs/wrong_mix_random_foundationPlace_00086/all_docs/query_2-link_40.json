        "text": "LOS ANGELES Britney Spears is welcoming public scrutiny of the court conservatorship that has controlled her life and money for 12 years as she seeks to push her father out of power, according to a Thursday court filing. James Spears and the conservatorship's attorneys who work for him have constantly sought to have courtrooms closed and filings sealed in the case. But Britney Spears objects to the sealing of her father's motion to have attorney Andrew Wallet returned to his role of co-conservator along with James Spears. Recent filings showed that Britney Spears' assets, which the conservatorship controls, totaled about $50 million at the start of 2020. The dueling motions set up a showdown between James and Britney Spears that will be the subject of an October hearing and could stretch into a longer court fight.\n\nJamie Lynn Spears is ready to make an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen!
