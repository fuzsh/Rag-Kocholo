        "text": "Spears reprised her role as Zoey for a movie sequel, \"Zoey 102,\" released on Paramount+ in July 2023.\n\nMany fans speculated that \"Zoey 101\" ended due to Spears' pregnancy at 16 years old. In a now-deleted Instagram post from 2019, the actor said that the show ended because her \"contract was finished,\" not because she was pregnant.\n\nIn a 2020 cover story for Nylon, the actor said that she \"didn't become pregnant until probably six months after we wrapped or something like that.\"\n\nThe actor gave birth to her first child with then-boyfriend Casey Aldridge, a daughter named Maddie Briann, in June 2008. Spears and Aldridge had an on-again, off-again relationship (including an engagement) but split in 2010.\n\nShe went on to marry Jamie Watson in March 2014 in Louisiana and give birth to a daughter named Ivey Joan four years later.\n\nAfter her time on Nickelodeon, Spears switched her focus to singing, much like her older sister Britney Spears. She released country music, dropped an EP in 2014 titled \"The Journey,\" and collaborated with her sister for a track called \"Chillin' With You.\"\n\nShe also performed at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry and the 2017 CMA Music Festival, and participated in a tribute to Britney at the 2017 Radio Disney Music Awards.\n\nShe returned to Nickelodeon in 2018 as a contestant on the show \"Double Dare.\"\n\nIn July 2020, the \"Zoey 101\" cast reunited for a sketch as part of the Nickelodeon show \"All That.\" In October of that year, several of the \"Zoey 101\" stars teamed up for a video that put a fresh spin on the show's \"Follow Me\" theme song, amid discussions about a revival.\n\nThe \"Zoey 101\" film sequel, titled \"Zoey 102,\" was released in summer 2023, and followed Zoey and her friends as they reunited for Quinn and Logan's wedding.\n\nSpears was joined by the following cast members from the original show: Erin Sanders (Quinn Pensky), Sean Flynn (Chase Matthews), Matthew Underwood (Logan Reese), Christopher Massey (Michael Barrett), Abby Wilde (Stacey Dillsen), and Jack Salvatore (Mark Del Figgalo).\n\nSpears also released a memoir titled \"Things I Should Have Said\" in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, Spears competed on season 32 of \"Dancing With the Stars\" and was eliminated during week two of the reality TV show. She later appeared as a contestant on the British reality TV series \"I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\"\n\nShe's starred in the Netflix series \"Sweet Magnolias\" since 2020. The series, based on Sherryl Woods' books, was renewed for a fourth season in October 2023.\n\nNikolas runs an activist organization called Eat Predators.\n\nAfter leaving \"Zoey 101,\" the actor guest-starred on shows like \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,\" \"Supernatural,\" and \"Criminal Minds.\" Her last roles were in 2013 episodes of \"Mad Men\" and \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\nNikolas was previously married to musician Mike Milosh.\n\nShe's now in a relationship with Michael Gray and the couple welcomed their first child together, Nova Tíma Vespertine, in November 2020.\n\nAfter fellow Nickelodeon star Jennette McCurdy released a memoir in which she wrote about negative experiences as a child star on the set of \"iCarly,\" Nikolas led a protest outside the network's studio in Burbank, California, in August 2022. She held up a sign that read, \"Nickelodeon didn't protect me,\" and said: \"I did not feel safe around Dan Schneider while I was working at Nickelodeon.\"\n\nNikolas has continued to speak out about sexual misconduct and abuse in Hollywood. She's spoken about being bullied by costars on the set of \"Zoey 101\" and having uncomfortable experiences with show creator Schneider on podcasts like \"Real Pod\" and \"Vulnerable with Christy Carlson Romano.\"\n\nWhen the \"Zoey 101\" film sequel was announced, Nikolas took to social media to voice her disapproval, saying, \"Do NOT support a network that can't even take accountability especially when it comes to CHILDREN. That is beyond low…\"\n\n\"Eat Predators will def be rolling up to @paramountplus,\" she added.\n\nNikolas was one of several former Nickelodeon actors who appeared in \"Quiet on Set.\"\n\nShe's continued the conversation around the children's network on social media, calling out Schneider for not taking accountability in his recent apology video that was posted in response to allegations made in \"Quiet on Set.\"\n\nButler recently starred as Feyd-Rautha in Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part Two.\"\n\nAfter \"Zoey 101,\" Butler starred in several shows, including \"Ruby and the Rockits,\" \"Life Unexpected,\" and \"Switched at Birth.\" He also appeared on \"The Carrie Diaries,\" the prequel to HBO's \"Sex and the City,\" and the fantasy series \"The Shannara Chronicles.\"\n\nYou may have also seen Butler on shows like \"Arrow\" and \"CSI: NY.\"\n\nIn 2019, the actor starred as Jack in \"The Dead Don't Die\" and Tex Watson in Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"\n\nButler has quickly emerged as one of young Hollywood's most in-demand actors after his critically acclaimed performance as Elvis Presley in director Baz Luhrmann's 2022 biopic \"Elvis.\" Butler won a Golden Globe and was nominated for a Critics Choice Award and a SAG Award.\n\nMore recently, he starred on the Apple TV+ miniseries \"Masters of the Air\" alongside Callum Turner and Barry Keoghan.\n\nFor his role as Feyd-Rautha in Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part Two,\" which premiered in March 2023, Butler spent months training and three hours in the hair and makeup chair getting a bald cap applied to his head."
