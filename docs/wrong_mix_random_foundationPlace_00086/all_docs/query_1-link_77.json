        "text": "Jamie Lynn Marie Spears (born April 4, 1991)[1] is an American actress and singer. She played Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101 (2005–2008)[2] and its sequel film Zoey 102 (2023), and Noreen Fitzgibbons on the Netflix romantic drama series Sweet Magnolias (2020–present). She is the younger sister of singer Britney Spears.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Occupations ...\n\nClose\n\nBeginning in December 2007, Spears was subject to significant media attention and controversy after announcing her pregnancy at age 16. A misconception emerged that this canceled Zoey 101; however, the final season wrapped filming in September 2007 and premiered the following year. After giving birth in 2008, Spears stopped acting for five years.[3]\n\nSpears returned from her hiatus in 2013 and began her music career. She released her debut single \"How Could I Want More\" from her debut EP in country music, The Journey (2014). In 2015, Spears earned songwriting credits for Jana Kramer's certified Platinum single, \"I Got the Boy\", a song she wrote in 2011 during writing sessions in Nashville for her 2013 EP.[4]"
