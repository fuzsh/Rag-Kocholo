The blonde bombshell showed off her petite frame and toned legs in the figure-hugging number and completed her look with neon red heels.\n\nJamie Lynn Spears at the Academy Of Country Music Awards\n\nAll attention was focused on Jamie Lynn's latest accessory though â€” her beautiful wedding ring. The thick silver band sat alongside her monster engagement diamond rock which sparkled as she posed for photographs.\n\nFans of the Mississippi-born star first saw Jamie Lynn's engagement ring when she posted a photo on Twitter of her and Jamie announcing their happy news. \"Guess what?\" she captioned it, followed by another close-up snap of the impressive round-cut jewel.\n\nJamie Lynn's show-stopping wedding cake: get all the details here\n\nJamie Lynn left all attention to her wedding and engagement rings\n\nAt Sunday's event in Sin City, it was a mix of business and pleasure for Jamie Lynn as she took on the role of social media correspondent for the awards. The night seems to have been successful as she thanked her country musician Kellie Pickler on the night.\n\n\"Thank you @KelliePickler for being so sweet and guiding me thru my first #ACMs!\" she tweeted, next to a photo of the pair.\n\nJamie Lynn's wedding photos revealed\n\nJamie Lynn and Jamie tied the knot last month\n\nSpeaking on the red carpet, Jamie Lynn also opened up about her debut song How Could I Want More and her pop icon sister Britney Spears.\n\n\"I worked on this project for a really long time,\" she said. \"The single means a lot to me, and I was finally brave enough to put it out there.\" Your sister is always someone you're going to look up to. We're in the same kind of industry but different genres, so definitely it's good to take her advice.\""
