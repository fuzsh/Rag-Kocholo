        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears has become the second star to quit ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!. The American actress has appeared to struggle with her time in the jungle, with viewers seeing the 32-year-old sob as she adjusted to camp life.\n\nHer shock departure comes after Grace Dent left. The younger sister of Britney Spears previously spoke candidly about the mental health issues she experienced throughout her life.\n\nThe singer has battled depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). At her lowest point, she would only leave the house to take her eldest child to school.\n\nREAD MORE: Nella Rose's friend reveals real reason she left I'm a Celebrity camp - and slams claims illness was fake\n\nQuiz: Which Gogglebox gang are you in?\n\nIn her 2022 memoir Things I Should Have Said , the mum opened up about her unstable childhood home and parents' divorce. Jamie Lynn said her dad was an alcoholic and had a bad temper, which led to 'anxiety and unpredictability' in the family, MirrorOnline reports.\n\nOutside of home, she focused on acting and pursued a career, starring in popular show Zoey 101. She fell pregnant with daughter Maddie at the age of 16 and decided to leave Hollywood for Mississippi to raise her child.\n\nMotherhood forced Jamie Lynn to quickly grow up. She split from her baby's dad, childhood sweetheart Casey Aldridge - who she claimed was unfaithful and struggled with substance abuse.\n\nOn I'm A Celeb, she tearfully spoke about her decision to 'keep the baby' in a conversation with campmate Fred Sirieix. She said: \"The whole world was like, 'You're a s***, you're horrible your life is over'.\n\n\"I had to go hide away for a long time because they [the press] were relentless. I moved to Mississippi and literally hid. Put a gate around me. I had 20 paparazzi on me every day. It was horrible. I hated it so much. I just wanted to be normal. I wanted my baby to be normal. Everybody told me I was going to be a horrible mum. So I was like I've got to raise this baby by myself and I did.\"\n\nIn 2013, after years of suppressing her emotions and suffering with panic attacks, she reached out for professional help and was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD. Jamie Lynn told People in 2022: \"The anxiety was to the point where I couldn't function.\n\nShe took medication and went to therapy. \"For the first time in my life, I feel OK,\" she said.\n\nIn 2014, Jamie Lynn married businessman Jamie Watson before they welcomed daughter Ivey Joan four years later. In 2017, her life was rocked when her eldest daughter Maddie almost died in an ATV accident.\n\nShe made a full recovery. Jamie Lynn's rocky relationship with her older sister Britney, now 41, has also been a feature of her life.\n\nBritney was held in a strict conservatorship for years by their dad, with the pop princess once branding Jamie a 'total b****' for not helping her more. In her recent memoir, The Woman In Me, the singer said she reached out for help when put in a rehab centre for months against her will.\n\nBut she alleged Jamie Lynn told her to 'stop fighting it'. Britney wrote: \"I didn't understand how Jamie Lynn and our father had developed such a good relationship. She knew I was reaching out to her for help and that she was dogging me. I felt like she should have taken my side.\"\n\nThe sisters' relationship was rocky from the off, with Britney saying her younger sibling 'ruled the roost' and received preferential treatment from milkshakes to TV choices. She said: \"It felt like I was a ghost child. I can remember walking into the room and feeling like no one even saw me.\"\n\nFor Jamie Lynn, growing up in the Hit Me Baby One More Time singer's shadow was tough. Jamie Lynn wept on US TV as she told: \"Sometimes I feel like I don't really have anything for myself. I'm extremely proud of my sister but also have my own identity.\"\n\nIn Jamie Lynn's book, she claimed sister Britney once locked the family in a room with a knife - something her popstar sister denies. Britney said in her memoir: \"As I was fighting the conservatorship and receiving a lot of press attention, she was writing a book capitalising on it. She rushed out salacious stories about me, many of them hurtful and outrageous.\"\n\nJamie Lynn previously hit back at disgruntled Britney fans and said: \"Maybe I didn't support her the way the public would like me to with a hashtag on a public platform, but I can assure you I've supported my sister long before there was a hashtag. And I'll support her long after.\"\n\nShe also appeared to confirm an article claiming she was the only family member not on Britney's payroll and revealed she had tried to 'set up ways' to end Britney's conservatorship. But it seems Britney is hopeful for a different relationship with Jamie Lynn - and her younger sister seems open to it.\n\nBritney said: \"She will always be my sister, and I love her and her beautiful family.\" Jamie Lynn said: \"I support my sister. I love my sister. Always have, always will.\""
