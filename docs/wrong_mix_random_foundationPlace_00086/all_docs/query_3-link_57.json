        "text": "Sorry, but I can't help but comment on the news that Jamie Lynn Spears is pregnant. I knew the Spears family was dysfunctional, but this was still a bit shocking too me. I just don't understand the logic. This is the kind of situation abortions were made for. You're sixteen, you're a television star, and your sister is Britney Spears. This is a marketable product, if you ask me. There is no reason to procreate right now.\n\nI don't see how Zoe 101 producers can keep her on the show now. What mother is going to let her 10 year-old girl watch Jamie Lynn now? She's still too young to make money playing up the \"sex\" angle that Britney swallowed whole (pun intended). And now that Britney's stock has tanked, Jamie Lynn won't even be able to borrow money from her.\n\nAnd what about the father-to-be? Who is Casey Aldridge? Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this statutory rape? Any way you slice it, this child is doomed. Half Spears, half Aldridge, wholly fucked.\n\nThe only positive I take away from this is that Lindsay Lohan's younger sister, Aliana, has yet to become pregnant or develop an alchohol and/or drug addiction. I know what you're saying... give it time, right?"
