        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears is an American actress and singer, who is best known for being the younger sister of pop-sensation, Britney Spears. However, she rose to her own acclaim for her starring roles in Nickelodeon‘s, All That and her own show, Zoey 101 which aired back in 2005 and continued for four seasons. Through Zoey 101, Jamie Lynn Spears won countless awards from Young Hollywood Award, Outstanding Children’s Program, Young Artist Award, and a Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award. On December 20, 2007, in an interview with well-known OK! Magazine, Jamie Lynn announced that she was pregnant by her boyfriend, Casey Aldridge, at the age of 16. Word of her pregnancy spread like wildfire across news-headlines everywhere and quickly became known to her young fans who looked up to her as a role model.\n\nThe announcement of her pregnancy soon generated controversy among young children’s parents, who believed that the media was using this story to glamorize ‘teen pregnancy’. Indeed, Jamie Lynn is the face of one of children’s top television programs. With the announcement of her pregnancy to the world, young girls are now thrust into the knowhow of sexuality and underage sexual deviance. Many may believe that with such hype around the ordeal, teen pregnancy is a good thing and something that they must participate in. Although the show was first designed for a teen audience, much of its viewers generated people anywhere from 7 to 18 years of age. With this controversy at hand, young girls are introduced to the knowledge of sex before even deemed appropriate. The same year of her pregnancy announcement came the controversial pregnancy pact for more than a dozen teen girls in a Massachusetts High School. Many pointed the finger of blame at the young teen mom’s high profile status and her baby as the reason that so many young girls thought it would be ‘cool’ to get pregnant as teenagers. Jamie Lynn‘s baby news gave scandals such as these the boost it needed to become a nationwide story.\n\nWhen Jamie Lynn first came out with her announcement of her pregnancy, the show of Zoey 101‘s executive producers came out with this statement: “We respect Jamie Lynn’s decision to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation. We know this is a very difficult time for her and her family, and our primary concern right now is for Jamie Lynn’s well being” – People Magazine. However, the show quickly came to an end although another season was already scheduled to be aired the following fall season."
