        "text": "Being an unwed 17-year-old mother is the least of Jamie Lynn Spears’ troubles. The girl’s got a philandering fiance on her hands!\n\nCasey Aldridge, 19, has been cheatin’ on her with an older woman that dished about their affair to In Touch Weekly.\n\nKelli Dawson, 28, claims she’s been doing the nasty with the Nickelodeon star’s fiance on and off since they met in 2006.\n\n“We were both really attracted to each other. He totally instigated it and pursued me,” the Other Woman gushed. “His friends would tell me that he liked me, that he thought I was pretty.”\n\nNow, we all know they do things a little different down south, but wasn’t Aldridge still a minor when Dawson started seeing the “Zoey 101” star’s beau??? Hell, no, she said. Things didn’t get “hot and heavy” until the spring of 2007 after Casey turned 18.\n\nAnd even the news that Spears was pregnant with his baby could keep Aldridge faithful, Dawson boasted. Though she added “it just didn’t feel right” to keep up the affair after the birth of Casey and Jamie’s daughter, Maddie, two months ago, so she ended their relationship.\n\n“He had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop,” she explained.\n\nHow noble of her.\n\nMeanwhile, as Jamie Lynn deals with her drama, Britney did a sit-down with OK! Magazine saying that she was shocked, just shocked when her little sister said she was pregnant.\n\n“It was mind-boggling,” the 26-year-old pop star tells OK! in her first interview in two years. “I was shocked a little bit.”\n\nWhile Spears gushes about being a new auntie, the singer avoids any talk about her well documented, two-year decline, including her infamous head-shaving incident, trips to rehab and the psych-ward and her protracted court battle with ex-hubby Kevin Federline for custody of their two sons, Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1.\n\nBut she does manage to plug her upcoming album, which she calls “my best work ever.”\n\nAccording to the pop star, her latest album will drop in the next “six to nine months.”"
