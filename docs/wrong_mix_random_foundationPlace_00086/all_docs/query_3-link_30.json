        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears, 16-year-old “Zoey 101” star and sister of Britney, told OK! magazine she’s pregnant and the father is longtime boyfriend Casey Aldridge.\n\n“It was a shock for both of us, so unexpected,” she said.\n\n“I was in complete and total shock and so was he.”\n\nSpears is 12 weeks along and initially kept the news to herself when she learned of the pregnancy from an at-home test and subsequent doctor visit, she told the celebrity magazine, which hits stands in New York City on Wednesday.\n\n“As soon as I found out for sure from the doctor, I took two weeks to myself where I didn’t tell anybody,” she said.\n\n“Only one of my friends knew because I needed to work out what I would do for myself before I let anyone’s opinion affect my decision. Then I told my parents and my friends.”\n\n“I was scared but I had to do what was right for me.”\n\nSpears broke the news to her mother Lynne just before Thanksgiving, the magazine said.\n\n“She was very upset because it wasn’t what she expected at all,” Spears said.\n\n“A week after, she had time to cope with it and became very supportive.”\n\nLynne Spears, already grandmother to Britney’s young sons, said: “I didn’t believe it because Jamie Lynn’s always been so conscientious.”\n\n“She’s never late for her curfew. I was in shock.”\n\n“I mean, this is my 16-year-old baby.”\n\nShe said her actress daughter, the telegenic heroine of the popular Nickelodeon series “Zoey 101,” has known Aldridge for years and began dating him in high school.\n\nJamie Lynn plans to raise the baby in her home state of Louisiana — “so it can have a normal family life.”\n\nAs for her show? “I haven’t spoken to (Nickelodeon) personally but they have always been so great to me over the past years and have given me so many opportunities.”\n\nWhat message does she want to send to other teens about premarital sex?\n\n“I definitely don’t think it’s something you should do; it’s better to wait,” she said.\n\n“But I can’t be judgmental because it’s a position I put myself in.”"
