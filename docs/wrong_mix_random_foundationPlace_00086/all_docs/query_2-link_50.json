        "text": "René comes to this position with thirty-four years of experience in youth instruction and programs coordination. Within First Presbyterian Church, René has served as a Nursery coordinator, Junior Church Coordinator, VBS Volunteer, 5-Alive Coordinator, and most recently was on staff as the Interim Youth Projects Coordinator. She has filled the role of Circle Leader, is an active member of the S and D Sunday School Class, and has been a Moderator for Presbyterian Women.\n\nHired at age thirteen as a gymnastics instructor for York County Parks and Rec, René began a ten year “early” career in numerous youth related instruction and supervisory positions with York County, VA, including five years as a summer camp site lead, providing programming for 100 youth and managing a staff of three. René graduated from Penn State with a bachelor’s degree in Logistics. After graduation, she worked as a pricing analyst for Central Transport, before leaving the transportation industry to raise her daughters. More recently, René worked for Universal Yarn.\n\nRené returned to her passion of working with youth in a number of long-term volunteer positions as her children were growing up. She is in her seventeenth year as a Girl Scout Leader at First Presbyterian Church. Outside the church, René dedicated eight years as a volunteer for Sailfish Aquatics. There she led the community outreach Adopt-a-Family program, as well as fundraising, travel trip coordination, and alumni activities.\n\nBorn in New York and raised in Virginia, René has called Concord home since 1998. René and husband Chris have been married for more than twenty-six years and have two daughters: Emma and Kate. The family joined First Presbyterian Church in 2001. In her free time, René enjoys hiking, photography, and travel.\n\nJacquie has been the music director and organist at First Presbyterian Church since 2004. In addition to playing the organ for and planning the music in worship services, she oversees the music planning, coordination, and performing of the adult and children’s choirs. Jacqueline is also a professor in Music Theory and Aural Skills at UNC-Charlotte, where she also serves as the instructor for applied organ. She holds the BM and DMA in organ performance and literature from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester NY, where she also received the prestigious Harold Gleason Emerging Artist Award and The Performer’s Certificate. In addition she holds an MM in organ performance and improvisation from The Cleveland Institute of Music and an MA in Music Theory Pedagogy from the Eastman School of Music.\n\nWhen not doing music, “Ms. Jacquie” (as she is often addressed by the children at First Pres) loves to run marathons, cook (and eat) French food, and read 19th century British literature. She hopes to never retire and will someday author children’s books.\n\nMaureen has served as the director of First Kids Preschool since 1992. Originally from Louisville, KY, she has earned BA degrees in both Special and Elementary Education from the University of Kentucky and an MA degree in Early Childhood Education from UNCC. Before joining our staff Maureen was a teacher for Iredell Co. Schools and for the past ten years has worked as an adjunct instructor in the Early Childhood Education Department at RCCC. Maureen is deeply devoted to improving the lives of young children in our community and serves as a volunteer in many organizations including the Cabarrus Partnership for Children. She is a past recipient of NC Child Care Resources T.E.D.D.Y. Award and the CRSAEYC Anne Laukitis Pulling for Children Award, for her service and advocacy for young children. Maureen’s family includes two sons, Chapman and Patrick, daughter-in-law Kellie, and a furry crew of rescued animals."
