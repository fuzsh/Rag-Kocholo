I just had a feeling.\"\n\nOrth said her husband was under a great deal of stress. On top of his duties covering the presidential election, he had just visited his father, 84, in an assisted living facility in Buffalo, N.Y., which Orth said was \"a huge psychological strain for him.\"\n\nQueen Latifah sues film company\n\nSinger-turned-actress\n\nQueen Latifah\n\nhas filed a $275,000 breach-of-contract lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan against a small film-production company, claiming she was not paid for her cameo appearance in the indie flick\n\nThe Perfect Holiday\n\n.\n\nE!Online says the film, which also starred\n\nTerrence Howard\n\nand\n\nGabrielle Union\n\n, grossed $5.8 mil in '07.\n\nNo comment from either side.\n\nBriefs, not boxers, for Becks\n\nA larger-than-life, buffer-than-buff (poster of)\n\nDavid Beckham\n\n, wearing a disturbingly tight pair of briefs, rises up ('n' up) for 50 triumphant feet in front of the Macy's building in San Francisco's Union Square.\n\n(A touch of oil makes his rippling muscles and tight-as-a-drum abs gleam in the sun.)\n\nThe soccer deity's mission?
