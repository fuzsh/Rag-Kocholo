But she says she'll keep the baby and raise it in Louisiana.\n\nSpears tells OK magazine that she was \"shocked and scared\" when her home pregnancy test came up postitive. Now, she says, she's looking forward to being a mom and finding out as soon as she can whether she'll have a boy or a girl.\n\nAs for her own mother, Spears didn't have the nerve to tell her verbally. She handed her a note."
