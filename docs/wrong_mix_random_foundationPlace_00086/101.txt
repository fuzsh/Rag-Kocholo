Last year, Jamie Lynn Spears' relationship was in tatters amid allegations fiancé Casey Aldridge cheated on her with a neighbour.

But now the pair, who have a daughter Maddie, are giving their romance a second chance.

They were spotted on a family day out at Universal Citywalk in Los Angeles where they treated their 2-year-old to toys and sweet treats.

The 19-year-old also took along her parents Lynne, 55, and Jamie, 58, for the family outing.

Jamie Lynn, who had a brief relationship with businessman James Watson this year, and Casey, 20, are 'are working on things between them,' a source tells America's People magazine.

They recently attended a Lady Gaga concert together with along with Jamie Lynn's famous sister Britney and her boyfriend, Jason Trawick.

The former star of Nickelodeon’s kids show Zoey 101 fell pregnant at 16 and at the time described the news as a 'complete and total shock'.

She became engaged to the tradesman, whom she first met at a local church, four months later.

In August last year Kelli Dawson, a neighbour in Mississippi, Louisiana, claimed she was having an affair with Aldridge.

Jamie Lynn insisted Aldridge had not been unfaithful but they separated soon after.
