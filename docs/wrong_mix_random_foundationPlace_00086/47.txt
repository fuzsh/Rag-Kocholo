Jamie Lynn Spears’ ex, Casey Aldridge, gushed over daughter Maddie on social media. Aldridge has managed to stay quietly in the background amid Maddie’s recent ATV accident. But posts and photos across Instagram and Twitter show that he loves “his sweet baby girl.”

Jamie Lynn Spears and Casey Aldridge announced Maddie’s birth over eight years ago. Maddie Briann was the result of teenage pregnancy; a pregnancy that caused public controversy for Aldridge, since Spears was underage, at the time.

Casey Aldridge escaped a felony statutory rape charge and twice attempted to raise Maddie with Jamie Lynn Spears. Both times, the couple ended their relationship, and Spears went on to marry businessman Jamie Watson in 2014.

The last time Aldridge made headlines was in June 2016, when Radar Online reported that the then 27-year-old had committed three crimes in May and was found guilty of those crimes in June.

Aldridge, who Radar called Jamie Lynn Spears’ “baby daddy,” had apparently been charged with DUI, reckless driving, and possessing paraphernalia, all in Mississippi; the southern state where Aldridge and Spears met, gave birth to Maddie, got engaged, bought a house together, and twice called it quits.

Not much has been heard from or about Casey Aldridge since he last ended his relationship with country singer, songwriter, and actress Jamie Lynn Spears, who is famous pop star Britney Spears’ younger sister. Jamie Lynn is 10-years-younger than her big sister, Britney.
