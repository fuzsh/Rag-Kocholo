It might seem that the first film made in China that uses the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre as a plot element would qualify for an automatic ban from the government for that reason alone.

Yet it may be an equally sensitive issue in China, homosexuality, that dooms the chances of the film, ''Lan Yu,'' for legal showings in this nation. Despite both issues and other controversies, the film's producer, Zhang Yongning, is applying for approval from China's Bureau of Film to play it in theaters here. No date has been set for a decision.

The film will have its American debut on Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival and will be distributed in the United States later in the year by Strand Releasing. It has already been released in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

''Lan Yu'' is a gay love story shot without permission in Beijing that features full-frontal male nudity in a bedroom scene. Its lead character, Chen Handong, is a businessman who relies on official corruption and whose friends bribe judges to obtain his release from jail. The film derives its plot -- the on-and-off relationship between Handong and the decade-younger Lan Yu -- from an erotic novel, ''Beijing Story,'' published anonymously only on the Internet in 1997 because another set of Chinese censors, those with authority over publishing, would not have approved it. The novel became a cult hit among gay men and lesbians here.
