        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nIn the Jiangsu Mountains resided the Lan Sect, a sect renowned for the high-level cultivational, academic and swordsmanship skills. Their disciples were men and women of unwavering self-control, unparalleled morality, and admirable justice. For millennia, among the prominent five great clans, Suzhou’s Lan Sect had been recognized as one that produced beautiful, strong, poised and proper young men and women. It brought up prominent warriors, brilliant scholars and unparalleled musicians. Always fair. Always looking out for the needs of others. As distant descendants of the mythical qilin, they shared with this creature the elegance, wisdom, goodness and morality necessary to equate and judge good and bad, fair and unfair. And among the most recognized attributes of the Lan Sect of Suzhou were the forehead ribbons, framing the great self-control that each person has as an individual. This self-control symbols were given to the children right after having turned three (age at which they officially began to form part of the community). Thanks to this forehead ribbon being very recognized, the Lan Sect disciples always remained in austerity, in stoicism, and free of any vicious indulgence or disorganized affections to mortal affairs.\n\nAnd the second great pride that this sect had were the Two Lan Jades: Lan Xichen, current effective Clan and Sect Leader, and Wei Ying (courtesy name, Wei Wuxian). Both boys were of great attractiveness, a dazzling charisma, unmatched kindness, and a firm hand with cultivation.\n\nBoth Lan Jades, as well as the entire Lan Sect disciples, were expected to thrive for only one thing: perfection.\n\nPerfection in a world where all politics, every single coexistence and all gender norms divided them into social statutes, and where the secondary gender defined your every interaction, defined you as a whole. What had saved Wei Ying before, had been the fact that upon reaching the age of sixteen, he still hadn’t, while usually, his peers had done it at a regular age around eleven and fifteen.\n\nPerhaps he would remain a beta for the rest of his life. (After all, it would have been something to expect, when his mother had been a recognized beta cultivator and his father an alpha and the right hand man of Sect Leader Jiang).\n\nThe idea of course hadn’t bothered Wei Ying at all. Betas had their own roles inside the Lan Sect, after all. They could cultivate, or work as assistant academic professors. They helped guide and enlighten the students on their different paths. They could organize the monthly skills assessments and students ability trimonthly, or take care of the logistics for the Annual Cultivation Conferences. They had an ample wide-range of decision making and at some point, of directing the main manor if Wei Ying chose to stay too close to the Lans.\n\nBut then everything had changed one faithful day when Wei Ying had woken up feverish, short of breath and with shaky legs. He had a terrible itch under his skin, at the grade he wanted to tear it from himself. It didn’t make it any better the fact that he was sweating non-stop. Just the same morning when they were to attend the Annual Cultivation Conference at the Golden Carp Academy in Lingyi, inside Jin Territory.\n\nAnd at that moment, a part of his old life had collapsed. Suddenly, he had been filled with the need to take care of his heat cycles. The need to receive medical health check ups after medical health check ups and fertility tests every five months just to make sure there was nothing wrong reproduction wise and avoiding unwanted or out of wedlock pregnancies…\n\n(Were the holy Lans serious? Wei Ying was their precious second jade!! He wasn’t even sexually active!!!).\n\n…Sexual-ed he received about secondary genders suddenly felt so morbid and cringey to him.\n\n(Of course, at the end that made him to not pay much attention. Because, WHAT THE HELL? Wei Ying’s stomach lurched only at the cringe that was brought to him by listening people babble on and on stuff about that. Or worse, he left the room without wanting to have to do anything else with it).\n\n…Wei Ying was educated on how to go to the infirmary, which paperwork and forms to fill in to get his medical heat leave a week in advance before his cycle started …\n\n(Because, are you serious?! Omega heat cycles are so incapacitating that they cannot take care of themselves and their businesses like alphas and betas do!?)\n\n… He was informed about how some omegas had bimensual heats, how some were mensual and too regular, like a fucking clockwork, and how other lucky bastards only had heat cycles every three or four moths annually that lasted from three to four days.\n\n(That didn’t even make sense!!! WTF!? Biology surely worked so strangely! He’s pretty sure women and alpha’s cycles were nothing like this!!)\n\n…And how they were meant to keep every cycle in check.\n\n(Because, and Wei Ying needs to stress this out, doctors and healers have told him “to avoid unwanted bond marks and copulating between young disciples that still were way too young for a so serious, formal relationship as mating mates were. Its always a preemptive measure. Not high-likely to happen to our disciples, above all with everything we teach them and the sect’s disciplines. But it’s better to be prepared in any case”. Honestly that’s not a lot of help).\n\n… He was educated on how to wear collars and why they were meant to be used…\n\n(Some alphas really got feeling all strong and entitled hah? Thinking the whole world revolved around them. Marking whoever they wanted. How was it that alphas could bond mark poor omegas without the omega’s consent since the alpha jerks were actually fucking assholes that flexed their patriarchy rights, by biting any omega they found desirable!?! Wei Ying sincerely wished, wholeheartedly a “big fuck you” to them!!)\n\n(Well, on second thought, Wei Ying guessed that at least the Lans were more civil about this. Reports of alpha disciples attacking and bonding forcefully to omegas in heat was now something rarely heard of. It would actually be more likely to hear the current Emperor had abdicated his throne and fled from his home).\n\nWei Ying was also forced to go through the horrible nightmare that was his first heat cycle symptoms. Those that only could feel like cramps wanting to crush him from the inside, making him feel nausea and a horrible splitting headache that made him prefer to have his skull opened up by a chainsaw instead of experiencing the pain crudely, just like that. Wei Ying had had to go through the calvary of sweating profusely like a pig every fucking hour of his eight full days of heat the first time and every three fucking hours he had had to change his sanitary omega pads because he would drench them a lot with his abundant slick flow. And of course, the young man had been so incapable of taking care of himself, so the Lans had had an omega serving and assisting him twenty four seven during its duration.\n\n(For nine fucking, long days!!)\n\n… He went through the having to use several scent and heat suppressants brands hell, trying out one after the other. This made him have horrible nausea and an unimaginable spectrum of secondary after effects: from vomiting, tiredness and blurred vision to skin rash and fucking auditive and visual hallucinations till having found those that worked wonders on himself.\n\n(And yet, no. He couldn’t allow himself to spend way too productive time that he could use advancing in all of his pursuits and endeavors just because he had been bedridden with his stupid and horrible justification of academic insistence due to his heat…)\n\nSince that fateful day of his presentation as an omega, a part of Wei Ying’s former life had collapsed. It was then that he started having to use his presentation name. It was as if his birth name “Wei Ying” needed to go and with it, a part of him. So many others called him names like “future furen” or the “jade omega”, or simply referred to him as ‘omega’. It was as if Wei Ying was someone completely different, not his own person. As if his birth name had never existed before in the first place and he was only called that because of who he was biologically and what he could give to the Clan (technically a lot of children).\n\nWei Ying had had a hard time getting used to courtesy names, alright? Like all this time he had been used to calling everybody by their given names. He called Huan-ge and Zhan-ge and uncle Qixao (* A/N: It’s Qiren ok? I think that’s his courtesy name and thought of giving him this fictional given name. Sorry if it sounds lame or jarring at first) by their names. A-Guo, Yi-ayi and Xingfei-meimei… And you get it…\n\n(Well, an upside was that Wei Ying actually began to like his courtesy name eventually, since it had been given to him by Zhan-ge when he was still too young to decide one. And later on, Huan-ge had convinced Shufu to go with it. And it really suited Wei Ying — Wei Wu xian.\n\nBelonging to one of the most respectable and high-born clans, Wei Ying, courtesy name Wuxian, as a now officially presented omega, was expected to behave in a certain way. To dress and speak a certain way. And to be a certain way.\n\n(Noble. Elegant. Meeky. With the spine always upright. Dressed in the best tunics, not too flashy nor elaborated. Not too much flashy, charged makeup. Refined, regal, educated. Always nodding when other alphas talked. With high-fine etiquette, impeccable manners. Always being swift and light as air while walking by. Always being obedient and subservient to an alpha).\n\nHowever, his problem of having presented later than his fellow peer-disciples was that Wei Ying — for some strange, unknown reason that seemed to be unexplainable by the heavens, and clearly, by many other healers that had examined him before— was hypersensitive to scents. Whenever an alpha disciple got too close to him and their scent assaulted his nostrils, Wei Ying felt like vomiting.\n\n*A small flash back inside the flashback :’)*\n\nJust barely three months after Wei Ying’s presentation as omega, the real problems of the cultivational world —and practically of common folks who lived in the Central Plains— had escalated in intensity, reaching new heights. For years, the Four Greatest Sects, the Lan Sect of Suzhou, the Nie Sect of Xingtai, the Jin sect of Linyi and the Jiang Sect of Xiaogan had been persisting on their struggle against the Wen from Xi’an, a colossal titan that had been creating a civil war between these territories seeking obtain great power that suppressed rich and poor, prominent cultivators and common people alike. Many knew about the real, sick, greedy nature that the Wens had been presenting till now, during almost five complete years, just as the Lan qilins and Jiang white aquatic snakes had lost exponentially a great part of their power, people and territories.\n\nNone of them had been in the correct state to endure what would happen next.\n\nThey had been still deciding during that conference at the Golden Carp Linyi Academy, how to proceed in order to divide the losses and recover ground after the war, when the real major problem stroke, taking all of them by surprise.\n\nWith all the feng shui and density of spiritual energies being out of balance threatened by the war, they did not expect the surprise that all of this was enough to open a rift — much larger than had ever been seen in history — in the 1000 Hells’ Abyss. This great rift in the earth had hogged a great length of all the Central Plains. No one had really known from whence it had arisen or under what conditions. Only that there had been speculation for many millennia, that it had harbored all manner of dark, darkness and evil creatures, which had been called Yinyings; these were terrible beasts and demons of darkness that had plagued, relentlessly, each and every region where each clan was located.\n\nThe first kind of Yinyings to appear had been a modified and strengthened version of the Qiongpi, which had long ago had been decimated by the Wen on the road that now bore its name. This was a ferocious creature that had terrorized the Baoji, Xi’an and Shaanxi regions alike. This creature and the Great Xuanwu Slaughter tortoise version 2.0 has been larger and more furious than those that had been defeated in the past.\n\nThe Nies stumbled over the great problem that all their sword tombs in Xingtai had been excavated and surrounded by deadly yao energies, making their ancestor’s saber spirits angry, turning them into bloodthirsty ghostly weapons that attacked whoever approached them or their sacred territory.\n\nThe Jins encountered the first Tiangou a dozen years after they had seen the last one, killed by the leader of their sect thirteen generations ago. This new Tiangou was a creature so big that could swallow the sun and the moon like legends had it. And it had destroyed a good half of not only the Golden Carp Academy, but also soils, terrains and fauna, both in land and sea of the entire Linyi region.\n\nAs for the Xiaogan region, place where the Jiang white water snakes resided, as well as the Suzhou mountains or the vicinity near the Biling River, home to the qilin Lans, there hadn’t been any sightings of ancient dark creatures for a while. But there had been some reports about water ghouls going here and there, scaring off people away from the lakes. There had also been reports of shipwrecks or people who had disappeared into the Biling River from one moment to the other, never to be seen again. Whether they were common folk that didn’t know how to swim, or the most skilled and experienced merchants in the region. It was just a matter of time before chaos struck the homes of these territories in the form of dark creatures.\n\n(Clearly all the Sects and Central Plains hadn’t been prepared for any of this).\n\nSo, they had to put aside their previous conflicts and present a united front during these difficulties, hoping to confront and defeat, if necessary, the bigger, common evil.\n\nTherefore, after searching and discussing for a good three hours on the Annual Cultivation Conference that day, it was decided that the Wens were no longer allowed to break their urgent ceasefire that the situation demanded (a bad habit they had all the time). In order for an alliance between sects and rouge cultivators to prevail, one of the most common and effective traditional means had to be restored to in this case: marriage.\n\n(After all, none of the sects would attack each other if family ties were involved and there was a lot at stake collaterally).\n\nCompensations for after war losses were planned and agreed upon in a total of two marriages between four sects as a political solution. The first two sects to unite were the Yao and Zhen sects, with an annual exchange between them of 55% of their productive funds and labor, linking their two heirs together, Yao Mingjio (the firstborn son of Sect Leader Yao and Sect Leader Zhen’s daughter, Miss Zhen Xiujing.\n\nThe Jin and Jiang Sects had been next, joining together in hopes that the Jin would help (through the good friendship existing between their two leader’s wives) the Jiang to retrieve their lost lands, traditions, patrimony, heritage, as well as soldiers. They therefore joined the Jin leader’s son, Jin Zixuan with the Jiang’s firstborn daughter, Jiang Yanli.\n\nNext, a few rouge cultivators followed suit, lending their herbalism, medicine, cultivation training and sword skills knowledge against demonic arts to many sects as needed.\n\nSoon, all that was left was to make one last agreement between the Nie, the Lan and the Wen. One that would finally make the Wen cooperate once and for all with the other four major sects and not go against them as in the past.\n\nAnd that was when tensions began to rise.\n\nFor generations, only dominant alphas had been sired within the Lan Clan. it was not common for omegas to be born within the main family. This meant that omegas belonging to other cultivation families often married into the Lan Clan to raise more heirs. It was either that, or competent alpha females were used (which, surprisingly were very scarce during this year).\n\nWei Wuxian was the second precious Jade of the Lan Clan and an omega. As a later addition to the Lan Family (although several would like to disagree, saying that he was not a Lan by birth — he would never be one) his duty would be to bear the next heir of the Lan Clan and continue the family lineage. The original Lan tradition had said that omegas didn’t cultivate; they were highly prized and were to be kept guarded for their own duties: to serve and marry a recognized alpha, to raise, educate their children and take care of the bonded couple’s house. (Wei Ying, of course, had resisted, insisting many times to his uncles that if he wanted the young boy to marry at all or for there to be an heir, he would do so on his own terms. These were very simple: that he be allowed to continue cultivating in a special place without others and could use talismans. However, he knew that other sects did not share his same worldviews. So of course, he had to agree with his uncle that he would be allowed to do this only until before he got married. Tch).\n\nOh, now… Since his presentation, Wei Ying not only had to have done what would be expected from a normal omega to do in Suzhou. But more pressure had been put on him so he would have to be at a much higher level now!\n\nHe had barely gotten out of that duty all of this time before his presentation, because, as a beta, Wei Ying had never needed to have to be married to anyone. He could simply have stayed here in Suzhou, taking care of the important matters that were under his responsibility.\n\nNo, now with all the actual situation transpiring, all of his dreams and that life of his were becoming a pipe dream in front of his eyes.\n\nCurrent Sect leader Lan and an alpha, Lan Xichen, was in charge of political affairs and the entire Clan’s management. He had announced earlier that same year, his unwillingness to mate. (Some believed it had to do with the loss of young master Jin Guangyao. Rumors running around between people had said that second young master Jin had turned away from him betraying him and in the end, Sect Leader Lan had had to leave him for dead. Others said that possibly Lan Xichen himself had killed the Jin, who might have been his only mate and destinated one from an entire lifetime).\n\nThe Wen had found themselves in the same position where, for years, they had produced only dominant alphas as heirs and the case of the nie had been the same until now, when they had had only the second born heir as a beta, Nie Huaisang.\n\nWith the eldest Lan out of the picture, there were three alphas (two Wen heirs and one Nie HEIR) and one omega (Wei Wuxian).\n\nAn alliance could only be made with an heir of one family or the other. The thought f a curated situation between various alphas and a single omega would have been somewhat more complicated as the three alphas ─ who were also dominant and very territorial by their very nature─ would constantly be fighting over the same omega. This would cause more friction and conflicts between sects, things they wanted to avoid at all costs. And they couldn’t afford to get involved in such a bloodbath at this time.\n\nBesides, that meant that not only would internal power struggles would be possible, but also there would be more mouths to feed and more resources needed (which were somewhat limited to begin with). And not only that. The Lan Clan leader, who was not even himself too attached to traditionalist procedures, had proposed to allow Wei Wuxian ─ the omega in question─ to choose a partner himself from among the three possible prospects.\n\nThis was how their problems continued to grow. Wei Wuxian had to spend time in the Nie and Wen houses, getting used to the dynamics and atmosphere as he was approached and courted bu the three alphas.\n\nWhen it was his turn to stay with Wen Chao, Wei Ying couldn’t have been more disgusted. it was still the remnants of his heat cycle (Yes, three months after having it. Give him a break! This is ridiculous), and his inner omega had gone too far as to rip Wen Chao’s throat open.\n\nHonestly, Wei Ying is not at fault here. It’s in an omega’s nature to choose a suitable mate to bond with. When Chao clearly was a clowny, lame-excuse of an alpha without any amount of force or skills to make the younger boy submit. Plus, he had already been overly irritating Wei Ying so much. Besides, in other regions, such as Xiaogan or Xingtai what he had done wasn’t seen as a crime if alphas tried to mate forcefully against omegas or if they came too close to or even beating their nests ─ this was a big offense, what Wen Chao had done. Twice, to booth). The grotesque clammy sack and sad alpha waste had been constantly ignoring Wei Ying’s warnings time and again. He had been so insistent, ignoring the omega’s hisses and growls while he closed into his nest. For heaven's sake, WEI YING’S NEST. The nest he had spent a lot of time building. An omega’s nest which No ALPHA nor other external person could approach or touch for anything in the world, if the omega didn’t allow it ─ And honestly, it had demanded a big effort on his part, because, at the beginning, he initially hadn’t wanted nor thought of building a nest inside the Wen’s residence (which wasn’t a home to him, mind you). He had only done it because Huan-ge had nicely pleaded him to do so, so there weren’t repercussions.\n\n(“We don’t want to anger Wen Ruohan on the second night you’ve been here,” he had said.)\n\nOf course there was a moment of tension and conflict between the Lan and the Wen from then on. A conflict that lasted for several months nonstop. Until things gradually calmed down in the spring of the following year, after Wei Ying had turned seventeen.\n\nThe problem continued to grow roots quickly; Wei Ying was not only averse to the presence and scent of the two remaining alphas (Wen Xu, firsborn son of Wen Ruohan, heir to the Wen Financial Group and Nie Mingjue, the current Clan leader Nie and a well-known contractor for the Country’s Armed Forces). You could say that, at single glance, both options could be considered decent at least, economically and socially wise. But Wei Ying’s inner omega also had to be overly picky and petty.\n\nWhile Wen Xu had the riches, the connections, the power and was attractive (to say the least), Wei Ying was sure the man secretly was just as psychopathic and unpredictable in mood as his father- He also had the same inflated ego as his younger brother (may he rest in pieces). Wei Ying obviously had to check him out a bit more because they might hypothetically marry in the future. And more disgusting to him had been the fact that the Wen alpha was involved with the ring of Clandestine selling and sexual trafficking of omegas as sex slaves within various strip clubs that the family had withing Nightless City. And also, the Wen had many, many of them as pets currently serving him. So Wei Ying wouldn’t be his first or only omega partner.\n\n(Honestly, screw polygamy. That wouldn’t be Wei Ying’s lifestyle. He would only hypothetically want to devote himself to one partner for his entire life. Thanks, but not thanks).\n\nOn top of that, Wen Xu’s scent was… Eww. Supposedly, it was said that you could find some comfort in your mate’s scent and presence. That it was the most natural and expected thing; liking how they smelled. (Basic biology and neuronal chemistry in action, duh).\n\nBut Wen Xu’s scent, ugh ─ just smelling the wet dog and burnt vinegar made Wei Ying want to fill an entire vase with his vomit.\n\nWen Xu (Or Junior Tyrant Number One, as Wei Ying had secretly nicknamed him) was clearly an example of an alpha who was a hard no for him.\n\nHowever, both Wei Ying and the Lans had not found themselves in a position to refuse directly. It was not a convenient thing to do.\n\n“Try putting up with it a little bit, Wei Ying. It’s important that we do this” Huan-ge tended to tell him constantly.\n\nAnd, goodness gracious, Wei Ying had been trying. For a long time. But it had gotten to the point where when he saw or even smelled Wen Xu approaching before he could even see him, Wei Ying had already fond himself overtaken by the urge to pinch his nose and throw the entire fucking man in the dumpster, where he belonged with all those other putrid scents.\n\nNie Mingjue, on the other hand, might admittedly been described as a ‘logically more desirable mate’. Sect Leader Lan and Him had been educated and had grown together, turning into good friends while, at the same time, both turned into formidable and respectable alphas inside the cultivation world.\n\nThe Nie alpha was what one could define as their “stereotypical model of a true dominant alpha”. A single solid muscle like body. He had incredible skill and an outstanding knack for strategy, defense and fighting. He had the money and connections, he demanded the power, he had the necessary experience at the forefront of the national security business. He was fair, upright, honest and a respectable man. He would make a great mate.\n\nNie Mingjue himself had been fully willing to court Wei Ying. He had wished for the omega to be who he really was, and to continue cultivating in Xingtai. The two had known each other from a young age and were very close, which was an advantage.\n\nBut as much as Wei Ying liked him and believed the man to be very competent ─ there was no chemistry between the two of them. His inner omega didn’t recognize him as a “potential mate”. No, Wei Ying’s inner omega growled and hissed at him. Although it did not reject Nie Mingjue’s characteristic smell of petrichor and bamboo forests ─ which, frankly made up a pretty good smell─ , it rejected Nie Mingjue whenever the man approached Wei Ying, both for normal, friendly purposes and for courting ones.\n\nThis had started to become a real ordeal.\n\n‘Why, why won’t you stop hissing at every alpha that comes your way?’ Wei Ying had asked it himself in front of his own reflection in the mirror inside his bathroom one evening, because why did his inner omega have to ruin everything, even the wonderful events that had been going on that night with Nie Mingjue? Pff.\n\nWei Ying would eventually reach a point where he would be left with no choice but to choose one alpha or the other, with no possible third option available. And being left alone without a partner?\n\nWell… That would greatly damage his image and reputation. It was unimaginable. But right now, having to choose only one partner made him feel torn in some ways. His only choices were the Nie, whom he loved (in a friendly, filial way) but did not accept as a partner. O Wen Xu, an alpha he didn’t like at all, who, Wei Ying could foresee, would treat him like a baby machine and not give him the necessary space, time, or recognition.\n\nFed up with this, he had gone to Shufu Qixiao in a moment of somewhat bold decision, to tell the old man his concerns.\n\n“We can’t afford ourselves to let you prance eternally around Suzhou without a mate” Shufu Qixiao had told him, reminding Wei Ying once more that his value and place were to be a mother and stay close to a mate.\n\n“I know, Shufu. But please think about it. I really don’t plan to be able to have either of the two current suitors as partners. It’s been hard enough for me —”\n\n“Wei Ying” Shufu had turned to finally look him in the eye. Wei Ying had remained meek and silent, still kneeling in the middle of the Lanshi, waiting for his words with respect. “In the midst of such a crucial situation as the one in which we find ourselves recently, we cannot let sentimentality guide our actions or cloud our judgment. We must do and take what we can. And make the decisions we feel are necessary. I know it is not ideal. But since we have been avoiding taking part in this war for a long time right now, avoiding conflict and sheltering ourselves until recently, we create an alliance with the Wens or with the Nie so we can stabilize and balance our lives more. There’s no room for anything else. Right now, it is either eat or be eaten. There is no room for a third choice.”\n\nShufu was right: as much as it would break Wei Ying’s heart. They couldn’t afford to be led by sentimentality right now. Wei Ying knew it wouldn’t be fair to anyone who had been trying to survive this situation up to this very moment. It could be a matter of a few weeks, days, hours or even moments before the next dark energy chaos would cause the Yinyings to strike Suzhou’s lands next.\n\nBut it was not until the next inner sect strategic meeting in December of that same year that Wen Ruohan had voiced his own concerns.\n\nWei Ying was sitting at the Lan contingency’s site, a few seats behind Lan Qiren. Honestly, he had stopped listening to Lan Qiren and the other members of the Lan Clan drone on and on about the situation and how everything would change and how many people were in a terrible time. Until Wen Ruohan’s statement brought Wei Ying back to the discussion happening right then and there, around him.\n\n“A-Xian seems like a desirable omega and a great candidate, Lan Xiansheng, Sect Leader Lan”. He was met by both Lans curtly bowing their heads in acknowledgement. “But no offense”, Wen Ruohan continued, as his smile began to turn thin, no longer reaching his eyes. “I don’t think we’ll be able to come to any agreement at this rate. He slit my second son’s throat during the remnants of his last heat and put my first son’s reputation to shame by having thrown him into the main fountain at Nightless City’s entrance ─I’m afraid that with nothing but his Lan Clan membership to back him up, we might accept him. But honestly, I’m worried about the fact that A-Xian is going to be left without a partner due to his …” The bastard cleared his throat. “... Behavior.” There was a brief pause, and then he continued. “You know how by then, people will start talking and the lineage of the Lans will be lost forever. That would be a disgrace.”\n\nThere were a few words that Wei Ying heard between lines.\n\n‘We don’t want any more trouble with you. We will accept him, but either you get that son of a bitch to behave properly or no alpha will want him because he’s an undesirable partner’\n\nAnd ‘He should feel honored that we have put our attention over him and that we have recognized him enough to consider him as our heir’s possible mate. Were it not for the current situation in the Central Plains, we wouldn’t even be looking at him, since he’s the son of a servant’.\n\nBut Wei Ying had not been born yesterday, He knew the man, his twisted personality and his way of doing things.\n\n“Are you suggesting that you only want me because I'm in the Lan Clan? And if I don’t behave like a pretty, demure omega for the Lans I’m of not use to you in your master plan?” Wei Ying asked, his eyes flashing with something like anger, insult and indignation.\n\nWen Xu, who was sitting to his father’s right and still sported a horrible, grotesque black eye from hitting the hard bottom of the fountain with his face because Wei Ying had just given him the water he carved so much, stood up. He furiously pounded a fist on the table. “Exactly! You should feel grateful that we’re giving you a chance at all. But you… you’re so… so… Selfish! No respectable alpha will ever want you as a worthy partner if you’re like that, bit—!”\n\n“Silence” Wen Ruohan reprimanded, shooting a murderous glare at Wen Xu. Lan Qiren deepened his scowl further. This was a clear sign of his growing irritation.\n\nAnd that was the main fucking problem of it all!\n\nYou’ll see, in the beginning when Wei Ying was still a beta, he had access to several things. Shufu discovered, that since an early age, the boy was brilliant, in the academic, cultivation and swordsmanship area and he needed to be nurtured appropriately. But mainly, he was outstanding for everything that included talisman manipulation, spells and as well as some invention of artifacts.\n\nWei Ying studied trigonometry, calligraphy, herbalism, everything necessary to ingeniously create and proof use new talismans. But above all, he had to make them practical and useful to help the cultivator in their duties of eradicating evil. He had also been allowed to cultivate and own his own sword, Suibian. Sometimes, he participated in extracurricular activities at summer camps, where there were archery and horseback riding competitions. It had been great being beta with these benefits within the first-class care the Lans provided him.\n\nBut when he became an omega, all that was threatened in the first instance. He was filled with more documents to read, more classes on etiquette, on sex education, on how to take care of everything during his heat or of his partner when doing it was necessary… On finding appropriate blockers for him (because the Lans, being respectful enough, they do not let their scents roam freely all over the space, making others uncomfortable). Twice, the elders had suggested that he please sealed his sword, stopped fooling around and started focusing on how to be a proper Lan Clan omega.\n\nWei Ying argued with them until he turned purple and crawled in front of Shufu Qixiao until he was allowed to keep his current activities - but apart from the rest of the disciples).\n\nHowever, a lot of stuff had to be taken into account, if he wanted to keep studying under lan Mingzhou’s tutelage. Wei Ying needed to learn about housing administration, about how to take care of and raise his children and how to be a partner complacent to his alpha. But, ‘old habits died hard’ as some said, and there wasn’t a lackluster of clowney alphas and paternalistic alphas that still saw him ─ and the other few omegas─ as the weakest gender and from which they were entitled to dispose like trophies in various quantities (well this last was viewed more generally around Suzhou and other sects).\n\nBesides, Wei Ying’s personality wasn’t much of any help. Because, while alphas expected a Suzhou omega to be meek, shy, elegant, that liked arranging flowers or preparing tea and reading music, deciding to stay more inside home, seated all the day between cushions and looking pretty, Wei Wuxian wasn’t anything like that. He was a lot. In every aspect.\n\nHe was rambunctious, stated his opinions freely without hairs in his tongue, he was a fucking know-it-all that always got his way, and was lively in a “very childish way” (as others put it),\n\nThere was never someone else or the Lan elders saying to him stuff like ‘Why can't you just be like the other omegas?’\n\n‘An omega being obnoxious and speaking up against every alpha? Preposterous!’\n\n‘Wei Wuxian really is something else, how can they let someone like him still cultivate?’ (Well that was the nicest things sometimes others would say about him ).\n\nEven amongst his personal tutors, his family and Lan Mingzhou, Wei Ying could be too much. An omega that was very curious and witty for his own good. But whatever, he was (alongside with Huan-ge) his Shufu Qixiao’s pride, so the others had to obey and agree with that, even if they didn’t like the idea a lot.\n\nOh, but the Wens were doubly inflexible and patronizing than the Lans. They were very oppressive and old-fashioned when it was about their omegas.\n\nIf the Wens joined the Lans through their two most prominent heirs, the two sects finally would be able to put all of their differences and their dark past behind. And also, the Wens could protect the Lans in various ways. (Many Suzhou’s cities had suffered, after all, in their prominent Clan and Academy’s siege when clearly, they had stated that same year that they didn’t want anything to do with the war. Besides, the Wens had wanted since then an alliance with them, but they had dejected them). The Wens proposed the Lans to never oppress them ever again and give tim a 40% annual support so they could retrieve what they had lost during those five years of incessant war. They stated they could also offer them scholarships and places for more Suzhou people trained with them, or they would support those with tighter financial situations. Thing was, if Wei Ying married Wen Xu (which wasn’t probably to happen but until spring from next year), then a horrible hell would be up ahead for him.\n\nHe would have to attend many events with important people who licked each other’s boots, praising each other’s success while talking badly behind their backs. Wen Xu would then show him off in front of them as his trophy wife, like his delicious, little arm candy, but to whom he would only turn to when it was necessary. He would leave Wei Ying dolled up, looking pretty, using him for any indecent thing while he fondled the young omega in front of them. And then, he would let other alphas look or even play with him too. (Oh, fuck. Wei Ying was pretty sure that the man liked sharing his stuff with others. This was pretty much disappointing and not a good image of him). And when they got home and were alone in their shared bedroom, well… Things would have to happen. Wei Ying definitely imagined Wen Xu with his brother’s and father’s same little hobby of torturing his partners in bed, making them go through any kind of humiliation and pain until he were satisfied with himself first. Wei Ying would have tho warm up the alpha Wen’s knot and bed. Let himself be filled to the brim with little Wen bastards however and whenever the man felt like and then he would have to fulfill his duties as the omega of the house. Repetitively. For the rest of his days.\n\nAnd a sort of awful thought passes through him (he knows it should be wrong against children, more so if they were his own) but in the middle of his thoughts he just feels the full contempt and anger all the same: Would he come to hate as well the children he has with a man he hates? Most likely.\n\nClearly that would be twice as miserable and sad.\n\nTruth be told, Wei Ying didn’t know the man too well, so these were only guesses. But he had heard pretty enough about both Wen Chao and Wen Ruohan and he could be certain that the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree, because Wen Xu would a) be rough in bed but also not so good and b) he would praise himself and his big ego constantly while inside the omega and probably forget about it being a matter of both feeling good. Besides, Wei Ying wouldn’t be the only ne, ina pretty important space for Wen Xu. As he has said previously, he could be locked up inside a room of too many and be forced to wait in line while other male and female courtesans and concubines had their turn to with the alpha. Or when his husband decided it was time to visit him. He would have to share the Wen with all these people and he would only have the “Wen Xun’s wife” title or “Wen Furen” to back up everything. He would end up being locked away in a large manor, depressed, with ten brats clinging to his skirts, doing household chores, warming the bed for Wen Xu and wasting all his life-years ago in absolute misery and loneliness. All while the man went and pursued his self-realization and everything that turned him into a successful alpha business man, while Wei Ying stayed cooped up in that manor, rotting away and with all his dreams being shattered to pieces.\n\nAnd what would happen to him? To his expectations? His desire to go to Y college with an Invention and Ingenium Youth Scholarship to assist? What would happen with his studies that he would supposedly continue in cultivation epistemology in campus on par and get his degree to become a senior grade Talismans Master? What would happen about hi dreams of traveling the world? Of meeting his destined alpha who saw and valued Wei Ying for what and who he was? An alpha who would spur him to improve and challenge himself more and more every day. An alpha who makes him want to surrender to his deepest desires. Someone that made the unruly Wei Ying want to submit? And who doesn’t mind having an omega partner who sometimes forgets the alpha’s presence while he stood there for hours, chatting and babbling under his breath about a new talisman design he thinks might actually help improve the whole rice paddy production in Caiyi River during the scorching summer head and mountain drought. Would all of this be too much to ask?\n\nIf Wei Ying married into the Nie family instead he could have all of this and more. But his omega was too complicated and so God damn picky. Receiving any offer of interest from an alpha who was potentially appropriate as Nie Mingjue was, to be his partner didn’t necessarily mean that Wei Ying felt the same way for the man. They had a bond that, according to Wei Ying, was more nurtured in friendship and their almost brotherly love. Nie Mingjue was a great man, and, again, Wei Ying really liked him and trusted him. He was like family to Wei Ying. If they became partners, there would be so much friction and they would inevitably end up in a stuck marriage, like the late Jiang Sect Leader and Yu Ziyuan’s one. Wei Ying neither could imagine submitting the poor man into a total suffering, taking advantage of his disposition and good will, without getting any fruitful result in exchange. (And, besides, the brunet boy had almost bitten the older man’s hand off once when he had honestly asked him to no avail that he left whatever he was doing for a moment and to keep himself warm during winter. This had escalated quickly when he put a hand over his shoulder. Wei Ying got too much agitated after having been hyper focused and he had closed his jaws strongly with a snap, so much and so near the man’s hands two times while he tried to spin Wei Ying far from his invention spot and tried to put on a blanket around his necks. All of this while Wei Ying had been in the mst important and yet stressful stage of his talismanic prototype invention. Working on this precisely helped him calm his mind and distress from being cooped up on the mountains for so long in the middle of a hellish blizzard. Blame it on his hyperactivity and dam picky omega).\n\nWei Ying paused in his tirade as he saw Huan-ge concentrating on reading the papers over his desk, with the two ginseng and vanilla tea cups from before resting aside, half empty.\n\n“Huan-ge”, the omega demanded with a pout.\n\nThe alpha in question lifted his face to look at him with his usual hearty smile. “Hmm?” Lan Huan hummed.\n\n“Are you listening to me?” the omega groaned.\n\n“Yes. You were telling me your concerns about which alpha to choose since the heir of the Wen group doesn’t seem to get your attention and Mingjue-xiong is like a brother to you, so you don’t know what to do.\n\n“Exactly. And I needed your great wisdom to help me on this one” Wei Ying snorted, abandoning his anxious pacing back and forth across the room. With a sigh and a loud thud, he plopped himself down on the couch in front of Lan Huan’s desk. And hid his face between his hands, resting his elbow on his knees.\n\nLan Huan paused for a moment, finally looking up from his reports to eye the omega correctly. “A-Ying, you’re smart. I’m sure you’ll be able to make the best decision and it will be greatly beneficial for all of us”.\n\nBut Wei Ying, still dismayed and conflicted, opened his fingers to peek through them at the older man. “Huan-ge,” He mentioned the nickname with a clear suffering tone on his voice, “Thank you for your confidence in me. But that only leaves me more confused than anything. I’m sure you would find yourself in a similar dissonance to mine if you had to choose either a good childhood friend with whom things wouldn’t work because you’re both not compatible in the romantic partner aspect, or be put to go through the rest of your life as a side piece to an enemy who almost burned to the ground your home once and everything you’ve ever known, who’s also a knot-headed and douche back that gives you a headache the size of their bloated ego”, Wei Ying snorted, moving and turning the small wooden motorized car model in his hands. (It had been a gift from Jin Guangyao during his travels to America. Lan Huan honestly had refused to get rid of it because of the amount of meaning and emotional charge it had evoked to him).\n\n“And I’m sure that here, it’s not only you who loses or sacrifices something; in this case, your home and position. Both will have to give in, to meet in the middle. And what better way to compare between the two houses and choose which is the best option when you reach a middle ground without any disputes between the three sides?\n\n“Ge… Negotiations between sects aren’t moving like that. They bid a certain amount and make agreements following who can give more wealth and who are compatible partners. My situation is… complicated on both ends. Besides, we can’t afford to let more time elapse until I make a decision.”\n\nHere, the younger man had paused to take a deep breath. Wen Ruohan’s words (that damned scoundrel) were still haunting his mind along with Wen Xu’s ‘You should feel honored that we had turned to see a disgrace like you’. They kept having him gnashing his teeth in anger. “The country is in critical situations and the way things are going, surely the Wen will push until I have to become trophy wife to the number one Wen mini tyrant” he continued.\n\n“You say you would have to put your cultivation and plans on hold, that you would have to stay cooped up at home with many children, devoting yourself only to an empty household most of the time… But Wei Ying, don’t you think there is more to the relationship than just children and serving your husband? Your skills could be but down elsewhere, using them for somewhere else. And your kids might burn with something as well themselves.s. You have so many other qualities that could be used for mutual benefit.\n\nWei Ying knows that Huan-ge — as magnanimous and diplomatic as he always is, willing to help him in everything and guide him as if he were his eldest brother and second father figure — did what he knew best to help him. But Wei Ying simply didn’t want to stoop to the level of these Wen tyrants or into a wedlock that would still guide him to be stuck and miserable even if his alpha partner were okay.\n\nHe doesn’t want to think about a future where he has to lose something or the other, in relationships that may not last.\n\nThe war took away many resources, homes, friends and family. But the cost he would have to pay is part of his happiness to be chained to a partner who may not value him enough while they're just two strangers meant to copulate and do stuff as it is meant to be.\n\nOr else he would have to watch a friendship of several years stagnate into a relationship with no future, no connection, a mortifyingly tense duty to mate, and with no real inheritance or luck whatsoever.\n\nAnd the situation in general had been creating more conflicts and separations between the three sects in question, while the chaos caused by several Yingyings began to take a bigger focus on the equation, affecting now also small cultivation clans and even common folk villages.\n\nEverything suddenly increased in tension, in warfare and defense against the dark forces. Six months passed like this, without anything concrete being defined between the Nie, Lan and Wen sects. The interests of both the Sect Leader Nie and the Heir to the Wen Financial Group didn’t diverge, remaining latent there, albeit on standby as soon as a problem came directly to the Suzhou section, when they had least expected it.\n\nA terrifying ancient being, which hadn’t had any register of having appeared for two hundred years re emerged at the Biling Lake’s bed, this was the Aquatic Abyss. A phenomenon that until today had little explanation, decimating all Suzhou’s trade, export and agricultural and livestock farming routes. More and more people had become affected and disappeared by this creature. Everything had come to a critical point during one day at dawn. It had been a strange coincidence that at the same time, while Biling and Caiyi were mainly in trouble, Huan-ge and Shufu Qixiao had been out to attend emergency matters in Lanyi.\n\nThat time, Lan Qianqiu, vice principal of the academy while Shufu wasn’t around came looking for Wei Ying (Lan Qianqiu, Shufu, Huan-ge and Lan Mingzhou were the only ones that still allowed Wei Ying to continue with his pursuits, despite his new nature. Therefore, as higher forms of authority inside the Clan, everybody else had to obey).\n\nThe man also gathered other eight disciples with prominent skills. And above all, that it didn’t seem to bother them the fact that Wei Ying, the Lan family’s omega, worked in team with them.\n\nHow did some lower-level creatures as the Yinyings that had been appearing till now had known when to attack exactly? How could they know all the Lan’s routines and itinerary? What the hell was going on? Were higher- frequency forms and creatures of higher intelligence finally appearing between them that they had for overseen at first?\n\n“I need you all to come with me right now. There’s big trouble in Caiyi’s Biling River. The others stay and begin the emergency protocol now. An entire horde of water ghouls and jianzhi are coming straight towards the academy at this exact moment. Fast, fast, fast”.\n\nThe young men had moved back and forth in complete harmony, knowing exactly well the procedures of what to do.\n\n“Wei Ying and seven others come with me to Suzhou. Two senior disciples will stay behind to lead the evacuation and preemptive measures here at the academy. And I need reinforcements in Nanjing as well. Seven of you head there with Cai-Xiansheng” the older man with a perpetual frown on his face continued to arrange.\n\nWei Ying honestly had found all this strange, but deigned to follow the group closely. They rode on horseback, loading two small carts with only their necessities.\n\nWhen they arrived at the city of Suzhou and right where Caiyi and the Biling Lake were located— at the midpoint where the body of the water was fed— they saw the disaster. It wasn’t by all means exaggerated to be out of proportions. It was really and utterly bad as Lan Qianqiu’s voice and urgency had painted it to be: Part of the channel that fed the lake upstream of the Biling River had overflowed and the riverbank was in an utter devastating state, having even caught fire, for some strange reason. Endless nets of rice paddies and agricultural crops were scorched. The smell of burning still hung in the air and the sky was light gray with ashes. What exactly happened here? This couldn’t be only the doing of a waterborne abyss? Could it? This had to be the fucking mess left behind by a fire-breathing dragon!!\n\nMore than twelve disciples were struggling against the huge whirlpool of water in the center of the river. There was a shipwreck of several sampans turned into nothing more than splinters being dragged in a row further and further into the turbulent current just to be swallowed by the angered waters. And there were surely many more, along with dead bodies and just as many crops and commercial fleets at the bottom of Biling’s River.\n\nHalf a day passed in which the newly arrived disciples fought alongside the disciples who had been previously sent out to prevent further shipwrecks and deaths as well as deal with the suspicious previous events. It was precisely Wei Ying who had read several weeks ago an old volume in the academy’s library from ancient texts of the Lan Clan from Gusu at the time of the Ming dynasty around the 318th year. This waterborne creature had been a war weapon used in the ancient times and according to the few records that existed about it, it had a demonic precedence and it would not be easy to defeat it.\n\nThey would have to dredge all the water and expose the river bed for at least several ten years from now to be able to put an end to all the accumulated resentment that the creature had stored from years and years of ships gone missing and people having been drowned underwater. Strangely it also had a strange, dark eerie feeling to it. So clearly it had to be composed at most —of it not of 100% —of pure resented energy.\n\nAn amount more than enough of dark energy could bring to life a terrible creature like this and worse, it could duplicate in little time, if the seriousness of the situation had anything to go by.\n\nTherefore, they had to opt for more of a defense and retreat tactic for now. Safeguarding the few intact fleets they could find all around the river’s territory.\n\nBut the darn creature was smart. It took advantage of every opening. Every moment of weakness and every lapse. One such lapse had brought Wei Ying to a rapidly sinking sampan in the lake, where a disciple (whose name was something Su Sahi or Chi or Che) who had tried to imitate him previously, making a sword seal to test what kind of creature or clue they could find hadn’t been really as proficient in his skills or sword like Wei Ying had been.\n\nPeople would usually take little interest in mere strangers. Or companions with whom you barely shared day to day life and whom you only saw from afar. But Wei Ying was not like that. Even if the boy had a very weak and normal-esque appearance that you would quickly forget about him, and even in reality he only delayed their small caravan along with a group of three merchants— a family with a daughter no more than five years old— to certain death at the bottom of the lake, Wei Ying had risked getting them all out.\n\nEven the boy.\n\n“Don’t hold us up. Come up with Lan Yue and get out of here” Wei Ying ordered, emerging to the surface. The water was freezing cold, but Wei Ying, being the great swimmer he had been since his youth and for the time he had spent cultivating his mental calm in the cold springs almost daily, didn’t bother too much with it. The Lan white robes weighed him down and a tiny shiver ran down his spine (though it had been still bearable. Really. He could handle much worse temperatures than this).\n\nLan Yue and another young girl, only two years their junior, held the Su Chi boy by each arm, leaving him between their swords. Wei Ying then turned to check that Mr. Zhang, his wife and their little daughter were coming out in the other sampan that came to their rescue.\n\nThere was an unusually calm moment where, although the turbulent waters had continued to swirl around every river periphery, the creature had paused briefly to possibly regain its strength. Wei Ying knew that if they wanted a chance to escape and get to safety — far away from the river—, then it had to be now.\n\nMr. Zhang jumped from one sampan to the other and then his wife followed him. The wooden structure they were in had already sunk at its entire bow, barely staying afloat in its rear section.\n\nA-Meilin looked terrified, clinging with her frozen little fingers, to the edges of the boat.\n\n“A-Mei! Please! A-Niang knows you are afraid of the water. But jump in. Gege has you!” her mother called in anguish.\n\nThe sampan was a short distance away from the other rescue boat, from where Wei Ying was calling and cajoling for her to see him and jump into his arms.\n\n“Come on, A-Mei, look at me. Here I am. I’m gonna keep you safe”.\n\nHe held out his arms, kneeling down to be at eye level with the little girl. She looked at him with wide eyes and shook her head. She was scared to death. Wei Ying could feel that she was, since her small, thin shoulders were shaking evidently, as she clutched to the both edges of the boat for her dear life with her small little hands.\n\nHe knew well what the fear to something felt like; he knew the thoughts of imminent death; was familiar with the horrible feeling of your stomach dropping to your feet, your incapability to move a single limb or thinks straight more behind the panic-addled fog on your brain of “you’regoingtodieyou’regoingtodie, that’sit,you’regointodie”. He knew how you were unable to concentrate on anything else rather than the negative experience, sensations and your fear of dying. How your anxiety shot up to exponential levels, spiraling more and more out of your control, Wei Ying knew this all to well because of his severe cynophobia (*fear of dogs).\n\nHe also knew that the waterborne abyss would resurface at any moment now. And that if they took a single second longer here, in this boat, they would both end up at the bottom of the lake, like the other corpses.\n\nThis made Wei Ying a little nervous, he wasn’t going to lie. There was a very little chance of standing up to a creature like this and actually defeating it. After having exhausted his energy for almost 12 hours of nonstop fighting, his muscles were beginning to protest in tiredness and his reflexive reaction-time had become slightly slower.\n\nBut he also knew that he had to stand firm and be brave. Wei Ying was A-Mei’s only way out. And A-Mei wouldn’t move unless she was a little calmer and felt secure and safe. So Wei Ying had to hold on to this small sliver of hope he had.\n\nThinking quickly, Wei Ying came up with an idea: Playing had helped reduce his anxiety and fear during childhood when he had had to spend the cold nights alone outside in the dark, without a home, a warm bed, or loving parents to tell him bedtime stories.\n\n“Look at me, A-Mei. You want to play? Let’s play a game… Let’s play hopscotch”.\n\n“Hopscotch?” she asked, blinking her wide brown eyes at him.\n\nWei Ying nodded, using his soft voice. “Hm, hopscotch. You know it?”\n\nHe used it for the younger children who were cared for by Lan’s wet nurses because they were still too young to begin academic classes or to enter official formation as disciples. Wei Ying tended to visit them during his free time. He would always find them with their respective wet nurses and couldn’t deny the poor children a bit of fun. Because… Later on they would have to leave all the fun and playing games behind, following years and years of rules and self-control, so why not let them be children and play for now? Later on they would no longer be able to play and be happy without a single care in the world.\n\n“I loved to play it when I was your age” Wei Ying continued, smiling as he gestured, balancing on one foot and then on the other, to hop to an invisible mark and picking up a small imaginary pebble.\n\nLittle A-Mei nodded after giving it consideration for a long moment.\n\nWhat no one else seemed to have noticed was that below them, inside the water, swirls of dark mist came back to life, as if they had been momentarily in a shallow doze off.\n\n“Fine, I’ll start”, Wei Ying announced, rising back to his normal height.\n\nHe cast a quick glance toward the right edge of the sampan as he caught an out-of-the-ordinary movement.\n\n“One.”\n\nHe jumped to position both soles of his boots parallel to each other a few steps in front of where he had stood previously.\n\n“Two.”\n\nHe hopped onto his right foot a little to the side, swaying slightly forward.\n\nBelow him, the wooden planks began to crack and separate and the boat sank considerably for a few more moments.\n\nA-Mei let out a small strangled squeal and squeezed her eyes tightly shut, bending her torso to cling with both hands, white-knuckled, to one side of the boat.\n\n“Three”. Wei Ying jumped again to drop with both feet another five steps closer to the little girl until he stood in front of her.\n\nHe gently and playfully scratched with his index finger the girl’s cheek to signal her to look at him. She slowly peeked one eye open to receive a beaming smile on the handsome gege’s face. And she looked at him intently with glassy eyes.\n\nWei Ying slowly bent down pulling out a rope talisman to tie it around her and then affixed another one, this time a sealing one, on her back. “Your turn” he indicated with a gesture. He stretched the piece of rope back, crossing the edges between sampans for the father to take the other end of the rope with slightly trembling hands.\n\nAround them, the current of water that had previously subsided slightly, flared, becoming more furious, more agitated.\n\nA-Mei looked at Wei Ying with alertness and terror growing in her expression.\n\nWei Ying found himself staring again at one end of the sampan, attentively. Yet, as he felt eyes over his figure, he flicked his gaze over, meeting with the girl’s hazel eyes. “It’s all right,” he smiled reassuringly at her, “ just look at me and make your move”.\n\nShe hesitated again. But she felt the need to be brave, just as gege was being brave for her. With trembling lips, she nodded and began to jump on her feet.\n\n“One” Wei Ying counted as she jumped and landed on both feet towards the end of the other boat. The omega then conjured behind her back an anti-demonic energy protection seal. This way the waterborne abyss wouldn’t be able to touch her even if she still had or hadn’t arrived yet at the other boat’s security.\n\nBelow then, the currents and the dark, spiraling beast let out a chilling hiss; the sampan floor parting further.\n\n“Two.”\n\nA-Mei jumped with her heart in her throat to one foot as the ground around her disappeared completely, turning into splinters and floating to the bottom of the river, driven inside by the current’s force, closing in so much to the sampan’s edge. Wei Ying readied Suibian to pick her up into the air and propel her with the talisman’s help, into her father’s arms.\n\n“Three!”\n\nWei Ying lunged forward, as if to charge at the girl at the same time that she finished leaping onto the last remaining small perimeter of wooden planks, managing to mount Suibian. At the same time, the ground disappeared completely, being replaced by murky, icy water. Suibian sent A-Mei into her father’s arms. Wei Ying smiled at the victory, even though it had left him to fall directly into the icy water, feeling his muscles sore, his clothes heavy and a bone-biting cold that froze even his veins.\n\nHe approached the edge of the sampan, as two clan disciples extended each a hand to help him up the boat.\n\nBut as they were in the midst of hoisting the young boy into the rescue boat, a strong current of dark coils grabbed Wei Ying by the ankle and dragged him down into the water.\n\n“Wei Wuxian!”\n\n“Wei-qianbei!” shouted both Lan Yue and the younger girl, as the family watched everything unfold with horror in their eyes. Their silhouettes became blurred through the water at the same time as the screams were heard distorted and muffled by the current that covered all of it. Wei Ying barely had a chance to blink with mildly ajar lips, when the water had pounded over him like the crest of an angry tide.\n\nSuibian was left immediately out of his reach and the currents submerged him a good few feet below the water’s surface at an increasingly fast and strong pace.\n\n“Wei Wuxian!” Lan Yue screamed, clinging with his hands to the edge of the sampan. (Both Wei Ying and him had met since a very young age and were practically like brothers, ebbing on each other’s pranks and trying to clean each other’s messes. He had been both in good and bad times with Wei Ying).\n\nThe fight with the waterborne abyss creature was insane; it was as if it had only been playing against them before. As if it had decided now to go serious this time and wanted to drown them again and again and again. Turn them into dust, or fish food.\n\nThe family hugged each other tightly, letting out screams of dread.\n\nThe young Lan took off his outer robe and tied a rope around his waist. He then pulled at the edge with his teeth, clenching and tightening it so it was perfectly secured. A few sweat beds shone and accumulated on his forehead and temples. He shivered and gritted his teeth, with evident pain and discomfort. All of it was complicated work, since his left arm sustained serious injuries, but the Lan’s arm strength and elasticity were not something to underestimate.\n\n“Yue-xiong stop! You can’t go inside! It’s dangerous!” Lan Zhuyan, the girls two years their junior called.\n\nShe was still a child, barely sixteen years old. And it was dangerous here. But when it came to putting all the available cultivators to use, both, experienced, distinguished ones and young rookies with barely an ounce of experience… well, they made use — like the other sects — of as many hands as they disposed to help.\n\n“I must send Suibian to him. Then, we will be able to leave. I just have to jump. Besides, we can’t just leave him here” Lan Yue insisted.\n\nHe tensed his teeth. Just imagining his best friend since childhood, his brother in arms dying in these waters… that was something the alpha couldn’t bear.\n\n“You have no control over what will happen. Also, the instruction was that all of us stay together and to send the survivors back”.\n\nLan Yue grew impatient. “To hell with all of that!” A pause, and then turning to A-Mei he murmured, “Sorry, please don’t repeat that”.\n\nThe waterborne abyss was a clever creature. It had seized the last moment after an arduous battle against it to capture its unsuspecting prey.\n\nIn the water, underneath them, Wei Ying struggled to free himself. But each time he succeeded, the abyss would grab him again and drag him down with more force.\n\nWater began to fill his nostrils, lungs and mouth, feeling it freeze his windpipe. His skin began to lose color. He felt like he was breathing fire. No, worse — he couldn’t breathe and water was burning his lungs, rendering them useless i\n\nHe felt as if a huge boar was crushing him, while a boa constrictor squeezed tightly around his torso. He stretched out a hand towards the surface, too close and yet still too far away. Feeling as if it was only a mirage. An illusion of how close he was to safety but being reminded of the gut-wrenching anxiety of actually not being able to get to it, despite all his efforts. Soon, Wei Ying would run out of strength and air. Dark spirals stretched out towards him like shadows in front of his vision, covering the clear blue of the water as the current sucked him further and further down. Wei Ying was a good swimmer and could hold his breath for a long time. But he was tired, and eventually his lungs wouldn’t be able to keep trying to take more air. He stopped feeling his feet, his body began to feel colder and colder. Water kept pouring into his nose, his throat, his mouth. His ears popped painfully and his ribcage began to compress,\n\nSoon, he would end up at the bottom of the lake. Another dead body. The Lan sect would lose another precious disciple.\n\nHis friends would miss him. His dreams would turn into pipe smoke. Wei Ying would wish he could go on living a little bit longer. He would give anything to return, to protect his home. To eventually become an official member of the Clan. To acquire his cultivator’s license and talismanic engineering invention degree.Also he wouldn’t marry any Nie or Wen family alpha, which at least ws a diminutive relief to him.\n\nBut none of that would matter now. He would end up there and there would not be anyone else to save him.\n\nHe was on his own once more.\n\nAt this saddening and gut-wrenching thought, a vision comes to his mind: a granulated image of broad, white shoulders. Silky long, ebony black hair. Eyes so impossibly clear and golden as tinted glass. Oh, it would be nice to at least come back to him.\n\nHe was pale, his vision blurred and diffuse on the edges, began to darken.\n\nThen, over the water’s surface, a great blizzard blew.\n\nAt the same time, the temperature gradually dropped. The turbulent waters acquired a new strength and direction.\n\n“We must go ashore now!” Called one of the older backups, approaching on his sword, to the sampan they were on. “Any cultivators or denizens left behind… a search party will take care of transporting them later to a safe place”.\n\nTo exalt his point, two other senior Lan disciples appeared preparing shields with the family emblem glowing in light blue.\n\n“No! Wei Wuxian won’t be able to endure that long! He’s inside the water. He will have drowned by the time rescue arrives —” Lan Yue protested, trying to throw himself off the sampan again.\n\nAnd he was about to say something else, when a large dark-blue and black array appeared in the sky, just above the eye of the waterborne abyss. A couple of black lightings sizzled and crackled downwards into the lake’s surface.\n\nAnd then, little by little, the sky began to be covered in a dark blanket. But only where they were all located. It didn’t reach far away from the lake’s perimeter.\n\n“What — what’s going on!?” Mr. Zhang asked, clutching a hand to the edge of the sampan that was abruptly rocking from side to side as he hugged his other arm around his family.\n\n“I don’t know” Lan Xiaoren (the older disciple) replied, poised on his sword.\n\nThe cold current of air suddenly blew in the opposite direction of the sampan, moving them towards the swore. And behind them, a protective wake was formed against the attacks of the aquatic creature. However, there was still no visible trace left of Wei Ying.\n\nBelow, in the water, the air suddenly ran out of the youth’s lungs, making them burn and feel like fire.\n\nWhen spirals of dark blue energy appeared covering him like a kind of a sea cocoon. You would think these spirals would be aggressive, wrapping themselves around Wei Ying’s weakened and cold body, trying to suck out his life energy from him and kill him painfully like a boa constrictor. But they didn’t try to hurt him. No, instead, they held him carefully, as if he were something precious. As for the water creature and the death grip it had on Wei Ying’s ankle, the coils fought it off. There were several vibrations, with the ripples moving abruptly towards the creature, driving it back until it finally succeeded and Wei Ying was out of its clutches. Other waves of vibrations continued to cloak and surround it. Distorted, a familiar, muffled sound was heard underwater. Like the notes of a guqin’s melody.\n\nA dark, lengthening shadow stretched out in front of a Wei Ying who was slowly falling unconscious. The young man saw, blurred and catching the little reflection of a light coming from the surface, some scales black as charcoals shining. A grayish-black mane. At the top of what appeared to be the elongated head of a deer-snake, he noticed two pairs of antlers growing, intertwining and twisting into each other of a light cobalt blue color. And then he saw a shadow approaching him like a mirage, like a divine apparition descending from heavens.\n\nIt wore black robes and he only caught the blurred glimpse of sharp, fine features; very attractive and masculine. For a moment the silhouette seemed very familiar… As if Wei Ying had known them from before. Were they who he thought they were and were finally here to collect his soul? That had to be it. Right?\n\nThe — familiar — stranger reached out a hand to grab Wei Ying by the waist. The omega felt the pull upwards until being pressed to a firm chest, and in that moment, everything went black.\n\n{***}\n\nHe was cold. Very cold that he could tremble out of his skin. And very, very tired. He had mild recognition for a moment, of being laid horizontally against a hard surface. Maybe a jade floor? Maybe a rock?\n\nWei Ying’s chest felt heavy. As if an elephant was jumping rhythmically on it. A small pause and then he felt something warm and soft being gently pressed to his lips. It felt slightly wet but also very, very… pleasant. And with each press he felt a scent he hadn’t smelled in a long time; a scent he used to adore when he was younger. A scent that reminded him of home, giving him this slight touch of melancholy: sandalwood and pine.\n\nHe was dead already?\n\nHow could he feel nothing at all but calm at the same time? Why could he still know there was stuff going on with his body?\n\nA few moments seemed to pass like this with the motions repeating in a loop. The rhythmic pressure on his chest. Two moments of nothing happening and then a gentle pressure on his mouth. Each time this happened, Wei Ying felt a cold puff of air travel from his mouth into his windpipe.\n\nOh…\n\nOh.\n\nHis brain suddenly was realizing what was all of this. They were giving him CPR, and someone was trying to save him from drowning. Then he coughed up some water and seconds later, he felt himself breathing again. The first breath he got felt like fire through his lungs, it was harsh and hurt his chest a little, almost aching to the sensation that he had felt being surprisingly driven previously by the waterborne abyss into chilly water. Then the second one was still painful but more manageable. He opened momentarily his eyes to notice a blurry face very close to his own. But it was too dark to make out the stranger’s features well.\n\nA few drops of water fell on Wei Ying from the stranger’s forehead, from their black hair like a raven’s wing. And from their chin. As if the stranger were crying over him.\n\nWei Ying remembered that at that very moment, he even wondered why this person was crying. And who were they to Wei Ying? Why did it strangely make his chest ache suddenly by seeing them like that?\n\nSurely all of this was only a vision. A dream, He must have been dreaming of someone else.\n\nHe felt so, so tired, heavy and had an enormous headache. Then he closed his eyes and lost consciousness again.\n\n{***}\n\nThe next time he came around once more was when he felt like he was flying. His legs were dangling and he felt a continuous movement. As if the stranger were carrying him in their arms; one between his shoulders and the other under Wei Ying’s legs, in a bride style. Honestly, Wei Ying was too out of it to be mortified or surprised by the unfamiliar position he was being held in. The back and forth swaying told him they were moving until it suddenly stopped.\n\nOther few diffuse moments passed, filled with darkness. Then he was still cold.\n\nAnd then he felt better when something warm pressed hotly and firmly to his surroundings and his side. He felt warm, safe, and comfortable. Wei Ying had never purred in his life. And honestly, up to this point and at his age, he had thought he would never have the possibility to do it during this lifetime. But, fully satiated and finally at some ease, he couldn’t help but feel his chest rumble furiously, noise low and contented.\n\nFor added effect, he stuck his head into where he thought it might be the person’s neck. (It was still a dream, so everything should be fine. There was nothing wrong with that). Good decision because that fresh, delicious, welcoming sandalwood and pine scent greeted him and helped him feel so much better, helping him cope with the cold.\n\nMoments later, his consciousness kept coming and going, leaving Wei Ying in a limbo between wakefulness and sleep. Perhaps it was more of a sleep than the former (or at least, for Wei Ying it had felt that way: like a dream conjured by the cold and delirium).\n\nIn his dream, there was a familiar figure. A melody hummed with a deep baritone that made Wei Ying’s stomach reverberate and his inner omega rejoice, as if it wanted to wallow more in that voice, wanting to have more of it. He also heard, far away as if through a great canyon, the harmonized and soft notes of a guqin. It was this soothing, melancholic melody again, that Wei Ying strangely recalled having heard sometime before, during his childhood. Yet he couldn’t put a finger in where exactly he had listened to it. Notes vibrating and reverberating, inviting him to hum sleepily with it. He dreamed he was being given something to drink and he had begun to feel very warm, feverish and sore. There was a strong burning and discomfort in his lower belly. And then, warm, firm, calloused hands caring for him. Releasing his pain and discomfort. He remembered mumbling something, content and satisfied (though it probably wouldn’t have been anything intelligible, except a few guttural moans).\n\nAnd then, finally, he fell fast asleep."
