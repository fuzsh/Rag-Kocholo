        "text": "While we were compiling our 100 best films of the 1990s list, we got to thinking about why certain titles were so successful. As such, we’ve been looking back over some our favourite posters from the decade, and have collected together a batch of the finest for your perusing pleasure.\n\nWhile the most iconic movie posters of the 1980s were masterfully hand-drawn, such as Richard Amsel’s illustration for Raiders of the Lost Ark or Drew Struzan’s for The Goonies, the 1990s brought with it a marked shift towards photography and computer graphics.\n\nThere’s the sci-fi spectacle of a hovering spaceship, a gun-toting Schwarzenegger, the unsettling horror of a skull-backed moth, and hand clasped to an open mouth. Only a handful of the below films feature in our best-of list – top marks if you can guess which ones made the cut.\n\nSlacker (Richard Linklater 1993)\n\nPulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994)\n\nNaked Lunch (David Cronenberg, 1991)\n\nBoogie Nights (Paul Thomas Anderson, 1997)\n\nElection (Alexander Payne, 1999)\n\nRun Lola Run (Tom Tykwer, 1998)\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas (Terry Gilliam, 1998)\n\nLes amants du Pont-Neuf (Leos Carax, 1991)\n\nScream (Wes Craven, 1996)\n\nMan on the Moon (Milos Forman, 1999)\n\nJurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993)\n\nEyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrick, 1999)\n\nDelicatessen (Marc Caro, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 1991)\n\nMalcolm X (Spike Lee, 1992)\n\nBeing John Malkovich (Spike Jonze, 1999)\n\nBasquiat (Julian Schnabel, 1996)\n\nManhattan Murder Mystery (Woody Allen, 1993)\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs (Jonathan Demme, 1991)\n\nTie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (Pedro Almodóvar, 1989)\n\nTrainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996)\n\nShowgirls (Paul Verhoeven, 1995)\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day (James Cameron, 1991)\n\nThe Thin Red Line (Terrence Malick, 1998)\n\nBulworth (Warren Beatty, 1998)\n\nRushmore (Wes Anderson, 1998)\n\nGot a favourite 1990s movie poster?
