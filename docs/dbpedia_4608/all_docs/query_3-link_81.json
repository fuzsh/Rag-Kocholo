        "text": "Netflix has announced that its fourth annual Geeked Week celebration will take place the week of September 16, including a live, in-person fan event in Atlanta on the evening of September 19. This marks the first time Geeked Week will bring together fandoms from series, films, and games at a live fan event.\n\nGeeked Week will highlight Netflixâ€™s most fan-favorite Geeked titles, with details of programming will be released in the coming weeks. In the meantime, Netflix released a trailer hyping up the event and the programs it'll cover including the second seasons of Sandman, Wednesday, and Squid Game.\n\nThis is the fourth year of Geeked Week and it's become a pretty big deal with Netflix, as it lays out its programming schedule for months to years, with sequels and future seasons being announced at the event. So far we know for sure that the live-action Avatar adaption has been renewed for Seasons 2 and 3 and Squid Game will end with Season 3. Sandman's future might be less assured as even the renewal announcement took longer than the aforementioned shows.\n\nAs with the case with megahit Wednesday, Season 2 is already underway, and adding 12 new cast members including Steve Buscemi and Addams Family alum Christopher Lloyd."
