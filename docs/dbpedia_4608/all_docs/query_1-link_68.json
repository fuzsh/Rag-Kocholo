        "text": "International Education Week (IEW) is a joint initiative of the U.S. Departments of State and Education and highlights the value of international education and exchanges at universities throughout the United States each fall. It is a challenging time to commemorate IEW. COVID-19 precautions are greatly limiting in-person classes and residential hall occupancy on campus. Tightened U.S. visa regulations have made it difficult for international students to travel to the U.S. during the pandemic, while Bruins hoping to study and/or conduct research abroad are facing the disappointment of delayed plans. Despite, or perhaps because of, our current circumstances, the organizers of International Education Week at UCLA believe international education and exchange remain more important than ever. If the pandemic has shown us anything, it is just how interconnected our world is. In fact, the pandemic is just one of many compelling global challenges whose resolution requires global collaboration — climate change, armed conflict, migration, economic inequity and racial injustice among them. The IEW organizers believe that an informed understanding of the world, its cultures and contemporary concerns is a crucial component of education in the 21st century and essential to preparing Bruins to be effective global leaders and citizens.\n\nThe 2020 IEW ran virtually from November 16-20, 2020. For the fifth year in a row, the UCLA International Institute led a large-scale UCLA observation of International Education Week. The flexibility provided by the online environment, enabled more Bruins to learn about international educational programs, research opportunities and scholarships; discover a wide range of career paths; interact with alumni working in the international sphere; appreciate activities reflecting the diversity of global cultures at UCLA; and participate in discussions with international students, faculty and university leaders on issues of global significance — including the worldwide impact of the novel coronavirus and the global scope of contemporary anti-racism movements.\n\nThe UCLA International Institute, together with a team of campus partners, including UCLA Study Abroad, Dashew Center for International Students and Scholars, UCLA Residential Life and the UCLA Library planned a week of engaging activities, including sessions on alumni, global and global health careers; information sessions on global internships, as well as FLAS and Fulbright fellowships; conversations with students and alumni living abroad and with international students at UCLA and abroad; and a global trivia contest. In addition, the week also featured a range of webinars on international issues organized by units across campus, including \" Global Movements against Racial Capitalism,\" \" Migrant Lives At Israel's Margins\" and \" The UN Security Council Veto and Atrocity Crimes.\" As a lead up to IEW, on Thursday, November 12, the Center for Global Management also hosted a lunchtime conversation on “Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace Around the Globe,” with leaders from across Europe, Latin America and the United States, including London-based UCLA alumna Marilou Calara (B.S. ’86), chief operating officer of EMEA Investments, Citi Private Bank; U.S.-based Katrina Jones, diversity and inclusion lead for Amazon Web Services ProServe; and Chile-based Manola Sanchez, former dean, Universidad Adolfo Ibanez. Not only have these women tackled leadership challenges, they have done so in sectors not particularly known for diversity—namely finance, technology and education. The discussion was also proudly featured as part of UCLA Anderson’s Embracing Diversity Series.\n\nMid-week, on Wednesday, November 18th, one of the featured events of IEW, the “UCLA Global Conversation,” was focused on “Global Racism and the Role of Education.” Racism threatens the lives and rights of billions of people around the world. Despite outlawing racial discrimination through a multilateral treaty in 1965, governments continue to perpetuate and permit racism—and individuals continue to commit racist acts with impunity. Eliminating racism remains an unrealized promise of universal human rights. Though more and more people today are educating themselves about racism, education alone is insufficient. Anna Spain Bradley, vice chancellor of equity, diversity and inclusion at UCLA joined Cindy Fan, vice provost of international studies and global engagement for a moderated conversation which attracted an audience of over 200 students, faculty, alumni, staff, campus leaders, friends, and colleagues from other educational institutions; as well as those from around the world, who engaged in this important conversation. A legal scholar and human rights advocate, Vice Chancellor Bradley critically engaged how education can address racism in the United States and abroad and the role educators must play in shaping a less racist future.\n\nThe UCLA International Education Week team reaffirms its commitment to international education and its solidarity with UCLA’s international students and scholars and considers the contributions of international students, scholars and researchers to U.S. universities — and the ability of U.S. students to participate in study and internship programs abroad — an invaluable part of higher education. View video of the discussion >>\n\nDuring winter break, 39 students from all four of UCLA Anderson’s MBA programs - full-time, fully employed, executive and UCLA-NUS executive MBA also visited Mumbai and Hyderabad for the in-country week of the CGM’s global immersion course, “The Business Environment of India,” led by Romain Wacziarg, Hans Hufschmid Chair in Management and professor of economics. In Mumbai, the course focused on entertainment and finance; and in Hyderabad, the emphasis was on healthcare, biotech and technology. The Center for Global Management partnered with and visited the Indian School of Business for the Hyderabad portion of the course.\n\nThis particular course familiarized students with India’s business environment. Since experiencing a severe balance of payments crisis in 1991, India has engaged in several waves of economic reforms that have resulted in high rates of growth over the last 25 years. Aided by strong fundamentals such as a democratic political system, a vast and youthful population, a culture of entrepreneurship and a large cohort of well-trained engineers and scientists, India is emerging as one of the major economic powerhouses of the 21st century. Yet challenges remain: an inadequate infrastructure, rampant corruption, growing income inequality, the permanence of the caste system and a dysfunctional political economy have conspired to hinder the strides that India was poised to make. The government headed by Narendra Modi, who was recently reelected to a second term, had initially rekindled the flame of reforms, tackling taxes and the business climate. But will this modernist agenda be stymied by the regime's populist tendencies? With a vibrant entrepreneurial class and a new business-friendly government, will India be able to meet the many challenges that she faces? This course explored both the risks and opportunities offered by the Indian market for foreign investors and domestic entrepreneurs alike. This was the fifth time a global immersion course had visited India, however it was the first time that a course had focused on and visited Hyderabad, where the sectors of some emphasis included healthcare, biotech and technology.\n\nDuring the one-week in-country, students heard from and engaged with many distinguished and influential business leaders and members of the civil society in India, as well as visited places of historical and cultural importance. The inaugural visit was to Sony Pictures Networks India where students heard from CEO and industry veteran, N.P. Singh who provided an excellent overview of the media and entertainment landscape in India and Sony’s importance in the sector. Aditya Mehta, head of corporate strategy and Manu Narang, chief HR officer also added significant context to the discussion highlighting Sony’s role as a “content influencer” with the ability to shape culture and steer topics discussed in the country’s social circles. The group also enjoyed a tour of Sony’s sports studios. To continue the entertainment theme, the group visited Yash Raj Films, the only privately held and fully integrated studio in India where they heard from Shantanu Hudikar, the chief of sound who discussed the role of music in movies. Students also toured this 50-year strong production house and vertically integrated studio that controls almost every part of the value chain from production to post production, domestic and international distribution, music and home entertainment, marketing, design, digital, licensing, merchandising, talent management, brand partnerships, music studios and film studios - all in-house facilities, which make it one of the most coveted entertainment conglomerates in the country. Students also visited Viacom 18 Media Pvt. Limited, an Indian joint venture operation between ViacomCBS and TV18 in Mumbai. Founded in 2007, Viacom 18 owns various channels of ViacomCBS, as well as various consumer products in India. Sudhanshu Vats, the group CEO and managing director shared the history and growth of Viacom 18 and and the company’s journeyto becoming India's fastest growing entertainment network. He also addressed the appetite for and growth of digital consumption in India.\n\nOn the finance side, students visited the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai, the country’s central bank which controls monetary policy and is responsible for maintaining economic growth and stability. Students heard from some of the Bank’s senior staff members on India’s banking system and learned about monetary policy and financial regulations in country. At the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) students were provided a thorough overview of the retail payments sector in India and how e-payments are handled from NPCI’s chief operations officer and chief of marketing, Praveena Rai and Kunal Kalawatia. NPCI is an umbrella organization for operating retail payments and settlement systems in the country. It is an initiative of the RBI and Indian Banks' Association (IBA) under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 for creating a robust payment and settlement infrastructure in the country. At the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, students heard from Tata Capital’s Avijit Bhattacharya, chief HR officer and Kumar Anurag, deputy vice president of strategy and special projects who explained how the overall financial landscape in India has changed over the years, including efforts to digitize financial transactions, challenges experienced by the sector as well as the journey of Tata Capital and a discussion on its activities, services and products. Tata Capital Ltd. is the flagship financial services company of the Indian multinational conglomerate, Tata Group.\n\nAt Barclays Rise, located in the heart of Mumbai’s fintech community, Sandeep Das, CEO of Barclays Private Clients group, together with the Private Bank’s heads of investment and equities discussed wealth management in India and the changing landscape of the private banking business in the country. Later, students had the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the start-up ecosystem and entrepreneurial environment in the country from Ajay Ramasubramaniam, co-founder and CEO of Startup Reseau. Together with his partners, Ramasubramaniam has successfully built India’s top meta-accelerator which brings together a global network of startup ecosystem enablers: startups, enterprises, capital, markets, mentors and services. Lincy Therattil, Rise Mumbai’s head of open innovation and fintech platform lead provided an overview of Barclays Rise, a global community of fintech innovators that seeks to disrupt, challenge and confront the way things are done in the industry. Discussions around the financial sector in India, would not be complete without a presentation and dialogue around microfinance. This was delivered by Anujeet Varadkar, CEO of Svatantra, a next generation microfinance entity that leverages technology to bank the unbanked and encourages entrepreneurship in rural areas, primarily among women. Headquartered in Mumbai, Svatantra is registered with the RBI as a non-deposit taking, non-banking finance company (NBFC) – microfinance institution (MFI). Importantly, it was the first recipient of the NBFC-MFI in India. Varadkar explained the history of microfinance in India, the evolution of the MFI in the country and the current environment.\n\nOn the final evening in Mumbai, to complement the finance-related discussions and visits, students enjoyed a panel discussion at the historic Royal Bombay Yacht Club on “financial inclusion – bringing India’s masses into the formal financial and banking system.” Ashwin Mittal (’01), president of Course5 Intelligence and president of the UCLA Anderson Alumni Mumbai subchapter moderated the discussion. Panelists included UCLA Anderson alumni Abhishek Agarwal (’10), co-founder and CEO at CreditVidya, a leading player in the alternative credit scoring space in India that leverages alternative data, AI and machine learning to facilitate institutional credit for the underserved; and Ashish Kotecha (’01), managing partner at Bain Capital. They were joined by Vikas Khemani, founder of Carnelian Asset Management, former head of investment banking and institutional equities for Edelweiss, a large diversified financial services company based in Mumbai. A networking event followed. Alumni from UCLA Anderson’s full-time, fully employed, UCLA-NUS EMBA and PGPX programs joined the evening.\n\nFollowing three full days in Mumbai, students then traveled to Hyderabad where the focus of the sessions centered around healthcare, biotech and technology. This portion of the course was organized by the Indian School of Business (ISB). The inaugural visit was to Dr. Reddy’s Labs, a global pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad that uses science and technology to provide affordable and innovative medicines. Nithin Nemani, strategy lead and Kapil Choudhury, head of business development provided an excellent overview of the biopharma industry in India and shared Dr. Reddy’s journey. Students were also taken on a tour of its facility. Driven by the belief that good health can’t wait, Dr. Reddy’s central purpose is to accelerate access to affordable and innovative medicines. The company has commercial presence in 30 countries, including the U.S. and has also enjoyed significant success in highly regulated markets. Students learned about state of the art healthcare delivery system in India through a visit to and tour of Apollo Hospitals, Asia’s foremost integrated healthcare service provider where they heard from Subramanyam Yadavalli, regional CEO. Apollo Hospitals, renowned as the architect of modern healthcare in India, has a robust presence across the healthcare ecosystem, including hospitals, pharmacies, primary care and diagnostic clinics and several retail health models. As the nation's first corporate hospital, Apollo Hospitals is acclaimed for pioneering the private healthcare revolution in the country.\n\nLater at L V Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), students learned about the confluence of efficiency and innovation from Raghu Gullapalli, executive director of emerging technologies and business development and then enjoyed an interactive discussion with LVPEI’s founder Gullapalli N Rao. Rao established LVPEI in 1987 after a successful career in the United States as an academic ophthalmologist and with a generous contribution by L.V. Prasad who was a pioneering Indian film producer, actor, director, cinematographer and businessman as he was struck by the lack of good eye care in India. LVPEI now is a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Prevention of Blindness and a comprehensive eye health facility. In 1997, LVPEI began work on a model that ensures excellent eye care for all, across villages and cities. The model follows a five-level inter-connected structure, building permanent infrastructure and human resources at each level of care. Each level generates income and delivers good quality eye care, irrespective of a person’s ability to pay. The Government of India adopted the LVPEI eye health pyramid as a model of eye care service delivery in its current five-year plan budget and the model is being rolled out in other states in a phased manner. Students received a fascinating tour of the facility where they also observed firsthand the different areas and levels of service and comfort given to patients based on what they can afford to pay. An overview and understanding of the biotech industry in India from a global perspective was also provided through a visit to Bharat Biotech, the largest vaccines and bio-âtherapeutics manufacturer in India, headquartered in Hyderabad. Bharat Biotech started operations in 1997 and today has over 160 patents. Known for its world-class R&D and manufacturing capabilities, the company’s mission is to deliver affordable, safe and high quality vaccines and bio-therapeutics that help people prevail over diseases. It also seeks to lead innovation in biotechnology in order to lead the fight against disease with a focus on emerging markets. Students heard from Sai Prasad, president of quality operations and from G.V.J.A. Harshavardhan, director of viral vaccines and international affairs. Bharat Biotech was co-founded by Dr. Krishna M. Ella who strongly believes that innovative technology in vaccine development is essential to solve public healthcare problems caused by infectious diseases. During their time in Hyderabad, students also had the opportunity to visit Infosys to better understand the rise of big multinational technology firms in India and tour T-Hub, a tech incubator and accelerator to better understand India’s tech start-up scene and ecosystem.\n\nThe Indian School of Business was the Center for Global Management’s academic partner in Hyderabad and at the conclusion of the week, students visited the ISB campus. UCLA Anderson Ph.D. alumnus Sarang Deo (Ph.D. ’07), associate professor and executive director of ISB’s Max Institute of Healthcare Management delivered the final session, “connecting the dots” on health care and biotech, which provided terrific context and perspective to the Hyderabad segment of the course. During the week, students witnessed the influence and wonderful support and engagement of UCLA alumni in both Mumbai and Hyderabad. In addition to the alumni panel and networking in Mumbai, UCLA Anderson alumni joined the closing dinner, hosted on campus by ISB as its own alumni gathered together for the School’s annual alumni Solstice celebration and festival. Alumni from the FEMBA and PGPX programs joined the evening of networking. The next day, Professors Bhagwan Chowdhry and Romain Wacziarg united during the alumni weekend to deliver a talk on what prevents countries from attaining prosperity and what countries such as India can do about it. During the week, students also got to experience some of the culture, cuisine and sights of India. In Mumbai, students visited the Gateway of India and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Terminus. They also explored other notable landmarks such as the Horniman Circle Gardens, St. Thomas Cathedral, the ornamentally sculpted architectural heritage monument Flora Fountain and the Bombay High Court, one of the oldest courts in India. At the conclusion of the week, some students headed to explore other parts of India and a number headed to Agra to visit the magnificent Taj Mahal.\n\nDuring winter break, 38 students from all four of UCLA Anderson’s MBA programs - full-time, fully employed, executive and UCLA-NUS executive MBA visited Singapore and Bangkok for the in-country week of the CGM’s global immersion course, “Business and the New Dynamics of International Trade: The Cases of Singapore and Thailand,” led by Jerry Nickelsburg, adjunct full professor of economics and director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.\n\nOver the last four decades, southeast Asia has been the locus of rapidly growing, globalized, emerging economies. As the most successful countries moved into the realm of middle to upper income, growth rates have slowed, but opportunities for international business still abound. Indeed, the two most successful countries in Southeast Asia, Singapore and Thailand are heavily dependent on foreign direct investment and exports. The international trading system and globalization are now being questioned in many quarters. The old guard that fostered the dramatic growth of Singapore and Thailand have now passed the torch to a new generation of leaders. These two countries, with similar growth patterns but very different socio-economic structures, provided an ideal contrast to study how these winds of change affect business opportunities, investment and profitability; particularly with regard to manufacturing, technology, finance, and trade. Throughout the course, students learned how these two countries, with similar successful economic trajectories, but different risk backdrops face a changing world economic system. They must adapt to new demands for consumerism by their population, increased inter-Asian trade, a changing geopolitical environment, the advent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and China’s One Belt One Road initiative in order to foster a continued, healthy business environment. Through both on-campuses classes, followed by one-week in both Singapore and Bangkok, students explored these areas in the context of manufacturing, technology, trade, and finance. A key objective of the course was to understand the economic, social and cultural background of business in light of the changing world trade patterns in recent years and what the changing world order means for economic structure, business strategy and business risk and opportunities. Although this was the second and third time that a global immersion course had visited Singapore and Thailand respectively, it was the first time that a course had focused on and visited both Singapore and Thailand together.\n\nUCLA Anderson’s dual-degree partner, NUS Business School hosted the inaugural sessions in its Mochtar Riady building where the students were warmly greeted by Professor Luh Luh Lan, academic director of the UCLA-NUS EMBA program. CGM founding board member and UCLA Anderson alumna Hwee Hua Lim (’89), former cabinet minister in the Prime Minister’s Office delivered the perfect inaugural address - a discussion on navigating the local and ASEAN political and economic environments which also touched on the role of government and set an extremely important framework politically and economically for the week. This was followed by a discussion with Lin Teck Tan, director of the future economy planning office for the Ministry of Trade and Industry. He addressed what Singapore is doing to prepare for its future economy, including deepening and diversifying its international connections; acquiring and utilizing deep skills; and building strong digital capabilities. Dionisis Kolokotsas, head of competition and economic policy for Asia-Pacific at Google later presented on Asia-Pacific’s public policy landscape. He addressed internet use in APAC and southeast Asia’s digital economy. He also explained the motivations for policy initiatives and policy areas, including privacy, data, cross border flows and platform regulations and the importance of Singapore as a global trade partner and driver of policy making. During a visit to Microsoft Singapore, chief technology officer Richard Koh also described Microsoft’s transformation and explained how the company had needed to adapt itself over the year to remain relevant in a fast-paced changing environment. In Singapore, students also visited the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank and integrated financial regulator. They learned about Singapore’s approach to monetary policy and the role and functions of the MAS from Alvin Teo, deputy director in the monetary and domestic markets management area and Dr. Keen Meng Choy, executive director in the economic analysis department. Students also enjoyed a tour of the MAS gallery to learn more about the role of MAS in issuing currency, conducting monetary policy, managing Singapore’s official foreign reserves, regulating and supervising the financial sector, and promoting Singapore as an international financial center. The gallery also highlighted MAS’ efforts in raising financial literacy, and offered a glimpse of how technology and innovation could transform the future of financial services.\n\nStudents learned more about cross-border business between Singapore and the larger Asia Pacific region during a visit to Rakuten Asia where they were greeted by UCLA Anderson alumnus Ameya Khasgiwala (’19), senior manager at Rakuten. Founded in 1997 as an e-commerce B2B2C company during the early years of the internet, over the years, Rakuten has expanded overseas into areas such as banking and e-money. In 2010, the company accelerated its global business and shifted from a Japan-based venture to a global internet services company. Over the last few years, the company further explored new business models building Rakuten’s brand overseas through global partnerships with FC Barcelona and the NBA’s Golden State Warriors. Students heard from Hirofumi Jujo Maeda, manager of the regional coordination about the company’s different businesses and services in the region and around the world. They also learned about Asia as an investment business from Anh Sae Min, managing partner for Rakuten Ventures, the venture capital arm of Rakuten Group who invests in diverse verticals such as advertising technology, artificial intelligence and on-demand business around the world. Given the overarching theme of the course, a visit to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to the Port of Singapore to understand Singapore’s port industry and how the country’s logistics industry has developed into what it is today and its role as an important maritime logistics hub. The Port of Singapore is ranked as the top maritime capital of the world and is the world’s second busiest port in terms of total shipping tonnage and the world’s busiest transshipment port. Singapore lacks land and natural resources and therefore the Port is an economic necessity. Students toured the harbor and visited the Singapore Maritime gallery which tells the story of Singapore's transformation from a small trading post into a premier global hub port and leading international maritime center.\n\nStudents then traveled to Bangkok. The inaugural sessions provided excellent overviews and introductions to the economic, political and business environment of Thailand. Sarawan Dever, deputy director of the American Chamber of Commerce discussed the role of AmCham Thailand, reviewed Singapore-Thailand relations and provided an introduction to the business environment. He also addressed the importance of understanding Thailand’s culture and history for business success. Ricardo Ortiz, an ASEAN specialist, foreign policy analyst and lecturer at Stamford International University discussed Thailand's political environment and efforts to democratize Thailand with its plethora of coups; and Steven Anderson, commercial attaché at the U.S. Embassy Bangkok shared his perspectives on the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on Thailand’s economy and its role in international trade.\n\nDuring a visit to the Bank of Thailand, students learned about Thailand’s financial landscape from Siripim Vimolchalao, deputy director in the financial institutions strategy area and how the Bank of Thailand is thinking about changes in a rapidly changing world order particularly in regard to the new digital world and how the 1997 crisis informs policy. At Asia Honda Motor, students enjoyed a factory tour and learned about Honda Motorcycle’s manufacturing and business operations in Asia, Honda’s business history in Thailand and the success of multi-nationals in the country. At Taskworld, a cloud-based collaboration platform, Reza Behnam, CEO and co-founder shared his experience and insights on global technology companies operating in Thailand. Later at Western Digital, a long-time innovator and storage industry leader, students heard from Chee Mak, director and HR business partner to better understand Thailand as a hub for global electrical appliance manufacturers. He also touched on the company’s amazing recovery after the floods. Students also enjoyed a tour of its factory showcasing the company’s manufacturing technology.\n\nOn the last day in Bangkok, students had the opportunity to hear about diplomacy and trade from UCLA alumnus Kantathi Suphamongkhon (B.S. ’76), Thailand’s 39th Minister of Foreign Affair; learn about intellectual property protection in Thailand and climate change as a tool from Fabrice Mattei, country manager and climate change and IP group head at Rouse, an IP services business focused on emerging markets. They also enjoyed a presentation on Thailand's technology industry and aerospace from double Bruin Varayuth “James” Yenbamroong (BSc '07, MSc ’10), CEO and founder, Mu Space Corp. A Thai-based start-up company founded in 2017, Mu Space develops satellite communication technologies that will accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things devices and smart cities. It also plans to lead space tourism in Asia.\n\nDuring the week, students witnessed the influence and wonderful support and engagement of UCLA alumni in both Singapore and Thailand. In Singapore, the week officially opened with an alumni networking reception at the NUSS Graduate Club Suntec City with alumni from UCLA Anderson’s FTMBA and Ph.D. programs as well as a number of UCLA-NUS EMBA current students and alumni. UCLA-NUS EMBA alumnus and John Wooden fellow Ryan Tan (’19) was instrumental in facilitating high impact speakers and visits too. In Bangkok, Professor Jerry Nickelsburg moderated a panel discussion with UCLA Anderson alumni Poom Vorasetakarnkij (’06), Nattawin Phongsphetrarat (’99) and Pakkawan Pongpornprot (’08) who shared their career trajectory post- UCLA Anderson as well as their thoughts and insights on business and the new dynamics of international trade from both their personal as well as own industry perspective. Following the discussion, students networked with UCLA Anderson alumni, current students as well as recent admits.\n\nDuring the week, students also experienced local culture, visited key sites of important historic significance and enjoyed local cuisine. In Singapore, UCLA-NUS EMBA alumnus Kevin Yap (’19) hosted the group at his Straits Chinese Restaurant and served authentic Peranakan cuisine epitomizing the region. Also before the start of the academic sessions, students enjoyed a Sunday afternoon tour of the island city-state where they explored the Marina Bay area and visited the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and its observation deck, SkyPark for terrific views over Singapore. Students also visited the famous Singapore landmark Merlion Park, experienced Clarke Quay and Little India and also visited the colonial-style luxury Raffles Hotel. In Bangkok, in between sessions, students enjoyed a visit to Wat Pho, the Temple of the Reclining Buddha and enjoyed a boat tour to see the Wat Arun, Buddhist Temple of Dawn. At the conclusion of the week, some students headed to explore other parts of southeast Asia.\n\nIn September during summer break, 28 students from UCLA Anderson’s full-time and fully employed MBA programs visited Lima and Cusco for the in-country week of the CGM’s global immersion course, “From Emerging Market to One of the World’s Fastest Growing Economies: Transformation of the Peruvian Economy and Business Opportunities,” led by distinguished professor and Latin American expert Sebastian Edwards, Henry Ford II Chair in International Management. This was the fourth global immersion course to visit Peru and the second to be led by Edwards.\n\nDuring the course, students learned the way in which economic policy in Peru – one of the most successful countries in Latin America in the last decade – affects business opportunities. An important feature of the course was that it put Peru’s case in context with that of the rest of the Latin American nations (with special mention to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela). The course also analyzed the way in which politics affects both economics and policy. Before the in-country week, on-campus class sessions addressed some of the most important economic, business, social and political aspects of the country, cultural issues as well as social and business challenges. During the week in Peru, students heard from prominent business leaders, academics, politicians and senior policy makers, as well as successful entrepreneurs. A number of Davos-style conversations and moderated conversations helped illuminate Peru’s economics and business environments with a particular focus on sectors that are key to the Peruvian economy. Students also met with and had the opportunity to hear from successful UCLA Anderson alumni. They thoroughly enjoyed their time in-county, learned a great deal, were inspired, met good friends and enjoyed a truly immersive and memorable experience together. The week also concluded with a visit to the most familiar icon of Inca civilization - Machu Picchu.\n\nOn the first day in Lima, the inaugural speakers provided terrific context and foundation. At the Central Bank, students heard from Renzo Rossini, general manager who provided an excellent overview of Peru’s fundamentals and economic outlook, including vis-à-vis Latin America. He addressed growth, inflation and the reduction of poverty since 2002 and explained that after hyperinflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, monetary policy was reformed and inflation decreased dramatically. Cesar Martin Menaranda, head of the investor services division at Proversion, discussed promoting private investments in public infrastructure through private-public partnerships (PPP). Proversion is a public executing agency, attached to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, that promotes the incorporation of private investment in public services and public infrastructure works. He talked about the various projects that the organization is involved with, ranging from sanitation to energy and mines and from education to tourism and culture. Students also heard from Antonio Menchelli, CEO of Urbanova Inmobilaria, the real estate arm of the Peruvian conglomerate, Breca. The company has been a major player in the development of Lima and firmly believes in sustainability.\n\nDuring the week, students learned about the main sectors of importance to the Peruvian economy. The mining sector is, and has always been the key to the country’s economy. Peru has 13% of the world's copper reserves, 4% of its gold, 22% of its silver, 7.6% of zinc, 9% of lead and 6% of tin reserves, according to the most recent data of the Peru's Ministry of Energy and Mines. Students heard from Raul Benavides, vice president of Buenaventura, a Peruvian precious metals company engaged in the mining and exploration of gold, silver and other metals and the first mining company in Latin American to be listed in New York. Benavides described how mining is evolving from an industry that was very aggressive to the environment to one that is regulated with better parameters. He explained how companies such as Buenaventura are dealing with social and political challenges that did not exist when his father established company. After mining, the fishery sector is the most important sector in Peru. Students visited the TASA fishing plant. TASA is a leading Peruvian company in the fishing sector and the first producer and exporter of fishmeal and fish oil in the world. The company has contributed to reducing poverty, increasing GDP, creating full employment and foreign exchange. At TASA, Cayetana Aljovin, chairwoman at Sociedad Nacional de Pesqueria spoke about anchovy fishing in Peru. Anchovy fishing is the dominant catch in the country and has been recognized worldwide as an industry that respects the environment and works for the sustainability of the resources. Students had the opportunity to tour the plant and learn about the process of fish meal and fish oil. They also visited the control room to understand how NIR analysis provides rapid analysis data for better decision making in food and agri-production processes.\n\nPeru's climate and different geographical zones also make it an important agricultural nation. Diego Acosta, category manager at Agricola Cerro Prieto (ACP) addressed agribusiness in Peru. ACP is engaged in the production, packaging, and marketing of high quality agricultural products, including avocados, table grapes, green asparagus and organic blueberries, four crops that allow for continuous cash flow throughout the year. Peru is a major supplier of crops such as asparagus because of its unique climate. Initially, many were of the opinion that blueberries could not grow and thrive in Peru as a fruit, but now Peru is one of the world’s biggest producers and exporters in the world. Since Peru enjoys the ability to ship its fruit by sea, producers have also been able to gain a substantial margin on sales. The Peruvian textile history began five thousand years ago when weavers from pre-Inca and Inca cultures mastered the natural fibers of cotton and alpaca. Today, Peru's textile industry employs approximately 250,000 people, and textiles and garment manufacturers account for more than 30 percent of the non-traditional exports in Peru. Peru produces some of the best cotton in the world and is renowned for its superior fiber length, strength, and consistency. The country also provides 80% of the world's supply of alpaca wool. Students learned more about the sector from Eduardo Elias, president of Textile Sourcing Company (TSC), a Peruvian integrated company founded in 2012 from former Textil San Cristobal S.A., as part of the biggest textile group in Perú. TSC is a full vertical operation from spinning to knitting, dyeing, cutting, sewing, packing, shipping and delivery which allows the company to have the shortest supply model in the region. He described the three drivers of value: quality, design and brand and talked about pricing and manpower management and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. He also described how China and e-commerce are hurting the Peruvian textile industry and the impact of automation and AI.\n\nPeru produces 30,000 tonnes of solid waste per day – 50% organic, 25% recyclables (not organic) and 25% non-recyclables. However, only around 3% of the recyclables is recovered today in Peru. Pipo Reiser, co-founder of Sinba, a social enterprise working with the Peruvian culinary sector explained how one restaurant generates the equivalent waste of 100 households and shared with students how Sinba creates solutions to help improve waste management and formalize waste collections. Students later had the opportunity to learn about financial inclusion from Adriana Chavez, CFO at MiBanco. The company was founded in 1998 as the first Peruvian bank to specialize in micro-finance. MiBanco offers products and services oriented to the micro and small enterprises, such as working capital, fixed assets, scope and commercial store building credits, fixed term savings, money exchange and money transfer to other countries. Students learned how MiBanco uses behavioural finance and is in the evolution of its business model, using technology for greater efficiency.\n\nStudents visited UTEC Ventures. Founded in 2014, UTEC Ventures is the edtech startup accelerator of the University of Engineering and Technology and is seen as one of the main contributors to the Peruvian startup ecosystem. Professor Edwards moderated a conversation on innovation initiatives in Peru and the entrepreneurial ecosystem with three entrepreneurial-minded panelists. Jose Deustua, managing director at UTEC Ventures was joined by Daniella Raffo, managing director at Aporta, the social innovation laboratory of the Breca group that works with the Group’s business units to maximize their social and environmental impact on stakeholders and uses the power of business for a force for good; and UCLA Anderson alumna Yvonne Quiñones (’15), co-founder and CEO at Urbaner, a platform that redefines logistics and gives companies access deliveries on demand. Students heard how much harder it is for companies to get funding in Peru versus the U.S. and how in general, women entrepreneurs seem to perform better. Students really appreciated hearing inspiring stories of entrepreneurs and especially two successful female entrepreneurs. Students also had the opportunity to hear from another successful UCLA Anderson alumnus Marco Moreno (‘01), managing partner at Creuza Advisors who hosted the group at his office. Moreno talked about the country’s transformation. He described Peru from 1985-1990 and then from 1990-2018 under Alberto Fujimori and the five administrations post Fujimori and explained that while they had different ideologies, the economic model remained the same. He touched on Peru’s investment landscape and explained that the VC ecosystem is in its early stages and that private equity has a limited track record. He also discussed the contagion effect in Latin America. Hugo Santa Maria, chief economist and managing partner for economic studies at Apoyo Consulting also provided a terrific overview on the Peruvian economy. He discussed specifically the “crises” years (1980’s and early 1990’s); the deployment of a new economic model which was “market oriented” (the 1990’s); then the “rock star” years (2003-2013); resiliency under adversity (2013-2016); then the “what on earth is going on” years (2016-2020); and the obstacles that the country has to overcome, such as a dysfunctional political system, constant turnover of key government authorities, a lack of continuity in public policies, procrastination in decision making in the public administration that require “political capital,” and since public opinion is key, the risk of “microeconomic populism.”\n\nA visit to Lima would not be complete without a visit to LUM, The Place of Memory, Tolerance and Social Inclusion that explores the 1980–2000 conflict between terrorist groups and Peru's government. LUM contains pivotal moments to understand the events between 1980 and 2000 and presents information on Shining Path (SL) and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), as the ones that sparked the violence, as well as showing the profound inequalities and the absence of the State that caused it to spread. Professor Edwards likes to incorporate an art/cultural session into the week which adds another dimension to the experience. At the LUM, students heard from Miguel Cruchaga, a Peruvian architect, intellectual and politician who talked about the country’s architectural history and explained the different styles in Lima throughout the years. He discussed the Huacas, incorporation of neo classical landmarks as in Europe and later the adoption of the international architectural style post 1940.\n\nPeru is known for its gastronomy and is home to some of the best restaurants in the world. Peru has 28 of the 34 climates and 84 of the 114 microclimates of the world, influenced by factors such as the Andes and the ocean currents. In Lima, students visited the San Isidro market and were given a tour of the market by Ignacio Barrios, founder and owner of Urban Kitchen who explained the origins of Peruvian food and the importance of ingredients in modern Peruvian gastronomy. Following the tour, students visited Urban Kitchen for an evening culinary experience where they also learned the importance of history of Peruvian food and how it became one of the most important in the world. They divided into four groups to learn how to cook traditional Peruvian cebiche and lomo saltado, as well as causa with prawns and huancaina sauce and octopus and black olive sauce. Students also learned how to make the transitional Peruvian picso. UCLA Anderson alumni also joined the evening together with a student from the entering MSBA Class of 2020 who lives in Lima.\n\nIn Cusco, Carlos Milla, president at CARTUC, the regional Chamber of Tourism provided an overview of the tourism sector in Cusco and its impact on the local economy and discussed the sustainability of the current growth in the number of tourists visiting the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. Peru is highly dependent on Machu Picchu with 85% of inbound tourists visiting the site. He explained that the region experienced huge growth between 2008 and 2013. The growth of the middle class has also been remarkable however there is an important part of the population that is still vulnerable. Looking to the future, he sees huge potential in certain areas, including mining of lithium, hydro-energy, water basin management and tourism. He also sees poverty declining and more people being integrated into modern society. However, there are also some challenges, including corruption and the informal economy, among others. Cusco has also become an attractive market for retail investment due to its high rate of foreign tourists and development of modern spaces dedicated to transforming the quality of life of thousands of Cusqueñian families. Students heard from Patricia Guzman, sales and marketing coordinator at Real Plaza, the largest developer and operator of shopping centers in Peru about how the company has been a pioneer in bringing modernity and investment projects to provinces, transforming the quality of life of thousands of Peruvians and generating employment opportunities. The final speaker of the week was Heidy Aspilcueta, director of operations at Medlife, an NGO that partners with low-income communities in Latin America to improve their access to medicine, education, and community development initiatives. Cusco is surrounded by an indigenous population that continues to live in extreme poverty. Aspilcueta explained how Medlife partners with the local communities to improve access in these areas and help integrate the communities into the modern economy.\n\nDuring their time in Lima and Cusco, students also enjoyed tours of each city. In Lima, students visited the historical colonial district and enjoyed a walking tour from Plaza Mayor, the birthplace of Lima which is surrounded by the Government Palace, Cathedral of Lima, Archbishop's Palace of Lima, the Municipal Palace, and the Palace of the Union. They toured Basílica y Convento de San Francisco which aside from a church and monastery, also contains a library and catacombs. They also visited the Adobe Pyramid Huaca Huallamarca, an archaeological site in Peru, located in the San Isidro district. In Cusco, students walked to Korikancha / Church and Convent of Santo Domingo. Possibly the most sacred and important building in the entire Inca Empire, Korikancha was the name given to the Inca Temple of the Sun. They toured the famous San Pedro local market and drove to Sacsayhuaman, a citadel on the northern outskirts of Cusco where they walked around the site and the best-known zone of Sacsayhuamán which includes its great plaza and its adjacent three massive terrace walls before embarking on a short walk to Cristo Blanco. The group ended the week with a visit to the most familiar icon of Inca civilization - Machu Picchu. Some students hiked up to Intipunku (Sun Gate), one of the most important archeological constructions around the Machu Picchu and others walked to the Inca Bridge. Everyone walked around the inside of the citadel and learned more detail around the history of Machu Picchu. Declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a 2009 worldwide Internet poll. At the conclusion of the week, some students stayed a few extra days to hike in the mountains, others headed to various parts of Latin America while a number of students headed home with fond memories, new friends, alpaca gifts and a greater understanding and appreciation of Peru.\n\nIn September during the same time period, 40 current students from UCLA Anderson’s full-time, fully employed and executive MBA programs also visited Finland and Sweden for the in-country week of another CGM global immersion course “Entrepreneurship and Corporate Renewal in Scandinavia.” Led by George Abe, lecturer in entrepreneurship, this was the second global immersion course to visit the Nordic countries.

The course also addressed the renewal, or not, of large private companies.\n\nDuring the week, students heard from and engaged with many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders as well as visited many start-up and well-known companies. The week started in Helsinki. The inaugural presentation and discussion was with executives from Nordic Investment Bank, headquartered in the city, who provided an overview of the Finnish banking system and investments in entrepreneurship. NIB’s mission is to finance projects that improve the productivity and benefit the environment of the Nordic and Baltic countries. Its main lending areas include energy and water, infrastructure, industries and services and SMEs. This provided a great foundation and context for the presentations and visits that followed. Students visited Maria 01, located in an old hospital campus that was converted into a community campus and startup ecosystem. Founded in 2016 as a startup campus hub in Finland, Maria 01 is run as a nonprofit with a vision to provide everything a startup needs to build their company in one place.

This first technology-focused global immersion course helped students to understand the dynamic growth of Shenzhen juxtaposed against the historic prosperity of Hong Kong. And in the process of understanding these two fascinating success stories, the course uncovered the \"cause-and-effect\" relationship of government policy and the changes in consumer preferences and technology in driving unique outcomes. Students thoroughly enjoyed their time and experience in Shenzhen and Hong Kong – they learned a great deal about and experienced firsthand the transformation in the region and for China and Hong Kong more broadly in areas such fintech, high-tech smart manufacturing and internet services; they were inspired; met good friends; and had a truly immersive experience together.\n\nDuring the same week of winter break, 40 students from UCLA Anderson’s full-time, fully employed and executive MBA programs traveled together to Bogota and Medellin for the in-country week of the CGM’s global immersion course, “The Transformation of Colombia and Its Economy: From Plomo to Plata,” led by Gonzalo Freixes, adjunct professor and associate dean of the fully employed and executive MBA programs. This was the second time that the CGM visited Colombia for one of its courses and the first time that Medellin was included in the itinerary.\n\nA lot has changed in Colombia over the last few decades. After years of violence and political instability, the country has transformed itself into one of Latin America’s leading economies. The government has made substantial progress in tackling the country’s illegal drug trafficking and reaching a settlement with revolutionary elements that have impeded the country’s growth and stability. At the same time, Colombia has experienced economic growth and prosperity as it has embraced a free trade economy. While many problems remain and economic growth has been stagnant in the region, Colombia has transformed itself into something of a Latin American success story. Foreign investment into the country and the growth of key domestic industries has made Colombia one of the best places in Latin America to do business. The second global immersion course to focus on Colombia provided students with a general overview of the country and its economy, as well as key insights and a deeper understanding of how Colombia managed this transformation and what it has meant for doing business in the country. The in-country portion of the course looked at some of the major industries and sectors in Colombia and immersed students in Colombian business and social culture.\n\nThe inaugural sessions took place in Bogota on Saint Joseph’s Day, a public holiday in Colombia, also referred to as “Dia del Hombre.” The opening speakers provided excellent context and a helpful framework for the week. First, Colombian journalist, John Otis provided a terrific overview of the many historical and cultural challenges facing the country. This was then followed by a presentation and discussion with UCLA Anderson alumnus, Andres Giraldo (’09), a principal at The Boston Consulting Group, who was joined by Wenyi Cai, managing partner of Polymath Ventures. In addition to talking about his time as a student at UCLA Anderson, Giraldo focused his presentation on the retail sector and highlighted several of the larger companies that operate throughout all of Latin America. Cai talked about Polymath Ventures, a digital venture group focused on innovating in sectors that are currently experiencing technological disruption. Cai believes these new technological solutions will be significantly different in emerging market segments, e.g. mobility, employment and health and wellness. Later, two UCLA Anderson alumni brothers, Igal Jinich (’95) and Zeev Jinich (’90) talked about their company Ciplas SAS, a third-generation family-owned and operated plastics manufacturing business in Colombia. Ciplas is a leading company in the transformation and commercialization of products made with polypropylene. The company’s product portfolio includes sacks and bags, canvases and tents, ropes and mesh packaging for sectors such as agro-industrial, petrochemical, mining and textiles. The brothers discussed the challenges of doing business in Colombia, the legal and tax frameworks, the labor laws and also the business opportunities that the country presents. The brothers each spoke about what led them to UCLA Anderson and ultimately to the business that they both now manage. Students were honored to have the opportunity to meet such successful and influential alumni living and working in the country.\n\nStudents also had the opportunity to learn about the flower sector through a visit to Bicco Farms, located on the rural outskirts of Bogota which produces and exports award-winning fresh cut flowers. Here, students heard from the farm’s general manager Mauricio Bonivento, who addressed the production process and the business of flower growers in Colombia. Bonivento discussed the challenges around the seasonal nature of the industry and how national and international holidays often dictate the color of flowers most desired by retail customers. Students enjoyed a guided tour of the nursery and greenhouse where the flowers are grown, the factory where the flowers are harvested, and the cold storage/refrigeration locations where the flowers are ultimately processed and packaged for distribution.\n\nIn 2011 UNESCO declared the \"Coffee Cultural Landscape\" of Colombia, a World Heritage site so a visit to Colombia would not be complete without learning more about Colombia’s important coffee sector. FEDECAFE, the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia was founded in 1927 as a business association that promotes production and exportation of Colombian coffee. It currently represents over 540,000 producers, most of whom are small family owned farms. Maricela Aguinaga Arcon, a research economist for the Coffee Growers Federation, addressed the implementation of the public policies in place to support Columbia’s coffee trade, and discussed the retail landscape associated with coffee both in Colombia and around the world. Arcon further discussed the Federation’s role in the coffee trade, including quality control, market positioning, purchase guarantees and its contributions to the infrastructure of the country through development and construction in previously rural portions of the country.\n\nIn Bogota, students also learned about the challenges and opportunities of the real estate industry in the country from Margarita Llorente, the general secretary of Amarilo, a leader in the promotion, management, sale and construction of housing projects. Santiago Alvarez, CEO of LatAm Airlines, the second largest air carrier in Colombia addressed the company’s strategy and also competition in the airline industry. Alvarez explained that the challenges of the industry necessitate the company to generate creative solutions to drive revenue and growth. Lastly, in Bogota, the group visited the National Police Department of Intelligence to hear more about the political and economic situation in Colombia and the progress that the country has made over the last three decades from Diego Fernando Vallejo Garcia, professor of the Universidad de los Andes. Two high-ranking members of the Colombian National Police, General Gustavo Alberto Moreno Maldonado and Brigadier General Ramiro Alberto Riveros Arevalo both discussed the role of the National police in the region, the security challenges they face while highlighting Colombia’s commitment to security to ensure that it remains a stable and safe place for economic development.\n\nStudents then traveled to Medellin. The position of Medellín as the second industrial city in Colombia has been a main factor in overcoming its crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In February 2013, the Urban Land Institute chose Medellín as the most innovative city in the world due to its recent advances in politics, education and social development. Medellín also won the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize 2016 which recognizes and celebrates efforts in furthering innovation in urban solutions and sustainable urban development.\n\nDuring the first day in Medellin, students visited Ruta N, a technology incubator that develops various programs and services to facilitate the economic development of the city towards businesses in science, technology and innovation, in an inclusive and sustainable way. The objective of RutaN is to create an ecosystem for social and innovative change designed around talent, financial capital, legal and technological infrastructure and proper networking. At Ruta N several technology entrepreneurs shared their stories and discussed their various companies and projects including Vitalbox, a medical records platform and Red_Medellin, a company with aims to both create cheap, ubiquitous access to broadband internet for underserved communities and to give formerly unbanked individuals a way to transact digitally.\n\nAt Bancolombia, Camilo Velasquez, the bank’s director of innovation explained some of the challenges of being a regional bank in a country which has significant variability in population centers and geographical challenges, requiring Bancolombia to be nimble and investor focused. Students also learned about the fintech revolution that is taking place globally. Bancolombia has also been recognized for its sustainability focus and Andres Perilla, a sustainability analyst spoke to some of the sustainable business practices that Bancolombia seeks to finance in an effort to cater to the millennial generation. He explained that Bancolombia focuses its investment strategy on companies that seek out sustainable practices through energy efficiency, use of renewable energy and cleaner production of existing energy sources.\n\nIn Medellin, students also visited Globant to hear how the company generates value and positively impacts its community. Globant is a leading IT and software development company that seeks to connect users with brands using digital and cognitive technologies and methodologies to enhance the customer experience.\n\nThe students also attended a presentation at Sura, one of Colombia’s largest healthcare providers. At Sura, students learned about the current state of the healthcare system in Colombia, including the differences between Colombia’s private versus public health insurance systems, and experienced some of the technological solutions that Sura is integrating into Colombia’s evolving healthcare system.\n\nThe final presentation of the week was delivered by UCLA Anderson alumnus Juan Chusan (B.S. ’88, ’96), president of Retail Food at Nutresa, a leading food-processing conglomerate headquartered in Medellín. Nutresa’s principal activities are producing, distributing, and selling cold cuts, biscuits, chocolates, coffee, ice cream and pasta. In addition to sharing his own personal and inspiring story where he described coming from South America to UCLA Anderson, Chusan also described Nutresa’s business philosophy of treating each of its brands as a business unit, allowing each to serve as a natural hedge against the others. Chusan shared some valuable lessons related to the expansion of a multinational company into new markets including considerations of not just the size of a market, but also the logistics associated with managing a company in a foreign country.\n\nAfter learning about the coffee sector earlier in the week from FEDECAFE, a visit to Colombia would not be complete without a visit to an actual coffee farm. At Capilla del Rosario, overlooking the Medellin Valley, the group received a tour of the coffee plantation and learned about the process of how coffee beans are grown, harvested, peeled, fermented, dried, and ultimately packaged and sold. In addition to learning about the chemistry and science behind the brewing of coffee, the students were treated to a Columbian coffee tasting as well.\n\nTo conclude the week, the group witnessed firsthand the transformation and innovation of the city with a tour of Comuna 13. This neighborhood has among the most tumultuous histories in the city and was once labeled the most dangerous neighborhood in the world. In the 1980s-’90s, the neighborhood was controlled by groups loyal to Pablo Escobar, the notorious drug lord who lived in Medellín. Students learned how the community has reinvented itself into a place of optimism becoming a livable, vibrant, and growing community. The focal point of the tour to Comuna 13 was the area around the outdoor escalators that provides access to homes in marginalized barrios that were formerly isolated from the city. Today, this transformed neighborhood is home to a colorful celebration of arts and culture, featuring street art and performances in several different parts of the neighborhood. Art saved the city as a vehicle for creative and political expression. The walls became a canvas to tell its history, beautifying the area and bringing optimism and peace to the residents, children, and visitors. Experiencing the life and color to the people in this community and seeing their potential for the future was an inspiring way to conclude the in-country week.\n\nDuring the week, students also experienced local culture, visited key sites of important historical significance and enjoyed local cuisine and nightlife. In Bogota, they enjoyed a city tour and visited sites such as the historic square of Chorro de Quevedo, and the Botero Museum, which houses one of Latin America's most important international art collections.

The students enjoyed the opening dinner at the casual popular eatery Andres DC in Bogota. They were joined by UCLA Anderson alumni brothers Igal Jinich (’95) and Zeev Jinich (’90). In Medellin, the farewell dinner took place at Carmen Medellin, an enchanting space with a cozy yet hip vibe situated inside a house in the Poblado neighborhood. Here students enjoyed contemporary cuisine, inspired by Colombian ingredients and flavors that are creatively woven into modern dishes that express the country’s biodiversity. The dinner served as a wonderful end to a very productive and meaningful cultural experience. After the conclusion of the week, some students headed to explore the historic port city of Cartagena on Colombia’s Caribbean coast, while others traveled back home to the United States to start back at school or work.\n\nDuring the same week of spring break, 40 students from UCLA Anderson’s full-time, fully employed, executive and UCLA-NUS executive MBA programs traveled together to Tokyo for the in-country week of the CGM’s global immersion course, “The Business Environment and Opportunities in Japan,” led by Mariko Sakakibara, professor of strategy. This was the fourth time that a global immersion course had visited Japan and the third time that Professor Sakakibara had led the course.\n\nAfter achieving spectacular economic growth from the 1950s to the 1980s, Japan has struggled with a prolonged recession in recent years. Its competitive position has been threatened by its Asian competitors. Japan’s aging population threatens its future growth. However, Japan remains the third largest economy in the world, and maintains its strong technological and cultural base. Japan-originated innovation has been commercialized and sold around the world, new businesses have been created and many business opportunities remain untapped. This course familiarized students with Japan’s business environment and helped students to identify business opportunities. Students gained a better understanding of the effects of Japanese systems on the way business is conducted in Japan and also explored business opportunities for both foreign and domestic companies and how to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nIn Tokyo, the inaugural session was delivered by Terrie Lloyd, CEO of both Japan Travel, a leading resource for Japan travel information and Metroworks, a software technology company. He provided an overview of the business landscape in Japan and discussed the opportunities for U.S. companies.

Dave Versteeg, CFO of Starbucks Japan then explained the history of Starbucks Japan, which was established in October 1995 as a joint venture between Sazaby League and Starbucks Coffee International. His presentation focused on how to become successful in the Japanese market. He compared and contrasted Japan’s business environment with that of the United States and explained how Japanese consumers are different to American consumers and that they are very influenced by the new and different, which is why Starbucks Japan has to create a new menu item every few weeks. Japanese consumers also typically stay in the coffee shop to drink coffee and are less inclined to grab and go therefore the location and space itself is highly valued by the consumer. Versteeg explained how Starbucks has to adapt to the Japanese consumer and implement different techniques in order to be a strong player in Japan’s coffee market.\n\nThe first company visit of the week was to the headquarters of Amazon Japan where the group was greeted by UCLA Anderson alumnus Shea Simpson (’11), head of licensing and label relations for Amazon Music Japan.
