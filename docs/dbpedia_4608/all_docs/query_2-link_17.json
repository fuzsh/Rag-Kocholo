        "text": "1990’s Cultural and Societal Impact\n\nDuring the most recent decade of the twentieth century, the United States turned into the world’s sole superpower. It had the world’s most productive economy and the most strong military. It commanded worldwide exchange and banking, and its mainstream society was persuasive across a significant part of the globe. During the 1990s, the U.S. economy became quickly because of a sharp fall in loan fees and the cost of oil, the development of new PC and correspondence advances, globalization, and the extension of worldwide exchange, money, and diversion. The 1990s were also a time of extreme social growth within communities. People were more peaceful and more accepting of other ideations and cultures. Also, there were many innovational improvements to filmmaking that changed film production entirely. Here are some examples as to how the societal and cultural shift in the 90s impacted horror films:\n\nCultural:\n\nIn the 90s, film production quality improved a lot. With the new audio systems, theater projection techniques, and lighting, horror films were a lot more immersive than they were in the 20s.\n\nThis decade had a horror film trend of including slashers into their movies. Horror films during this time mirrored serial killers in reality through popular films such as “Texas Chainsaw”.\n\nPostmodernism became a widespread ideology in the 90s. Skepticism of the known was a popular theme in horror films.\n\nSocietal:\n\nThe 90s was a time period where peace was appreciated. Many hippies and calm souls influenced the younger generations. This decade was known as an innocent time, and that was depicted in horror films through younger characters. Youth in horror films were always shown as being innocent and curious, which mirrored the youth in real life.\n\nDue to the 1990s being a more accepting time, diversity in all aspects was including in all films, including horror films. All races and all sexualities were being represented through movies.\n\nDuring this time, many feared that the year 2000 and onward would bring destruction and damnation. Horror films capitalized ff of this fear of the unknown by representing the near future to be hellish."
