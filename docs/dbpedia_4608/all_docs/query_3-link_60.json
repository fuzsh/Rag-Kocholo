        "text": "FAMS Fall 2018\n\nFAMS 101: Introduction to Film & Media Studies\n\nThis is a foundational course that introduces students to basic concepts, theories and methods that are central to film and media studies. We will study the histories and genres of cinema and formal techniques such as lighting, editing and sound to develop a critical understanding of film as a dominant mode of representation. We will also study other forms of electronic media to gain a better understanding of the perspectives and practices of emerging technologies and forms of distribution. Through required weekly screenings, readings, writing and regular discussion, we will analyze these various kinds of screen medias as they influence our world. No prerequisites.

It merges the critical study of documentary media with the hands-on construction of documentary stories waiting to be found in local communities.

The course provides a basic understanding of framing, composition, and storytelling through the use of sound and images.

FAMS P course. Adam MacHose TR 1:10-4:00 PM\n\nFAMS 235: Media Panics\n\nPanic and anxiety about the negative effects of media are nothing new. This course examines the long history of media panics all the way from the 1800s when social reformers feared dime novels would turn children into juvenile delinquents to the panic supposedly prompted by The War of the Worlds broadcast to contemporary debates about social media. By comparing contemporary claims about the impact of social media and the Internet on American society to similar claims made about dime novels, cinema, radio, and television when they were new, this course will give students the tools to critically evaluate the stories that are told about media effects. Using these tools, students will be able to separate hyperbole from nuanced argument in order to reach their own informed conclusions about the complex and often subtle ways new communication technologies are transforming our world. Prerequisite FAMS 101 or permission of instructor. FAMS H course. Beth Corzo-Duchardt T 7:00-9:50 PM\n\nFAMS 270: World Cinemas—Global Queer Cinema\n\nThis course introduces students to a range of contemporary queer cinema from across the globe as well as key questions in queer film studies. Through close engagement with theoretical readings and film texts, we’ll consider questions like what constitutes queerness, how does the definition shift across cultural contexts, and is there a queer aesthetic? Screenings will include Lan Yu, by acclaimed Chinese filmmaker Stanley Kwan, Fire, a lesbian love story by the Indian-Canadian director Deepa Mehta, French filmmaker Céline Sciamma’s coming-of-age tale featuring a gender non-conforming protagonist, Tomboy, and many more.

From the sound obsessions and anxieties of silent cinema to the disruptive sound experiments of the Fluxus collective to the expansive field of contemporary sound art and its remixture of the historical archive, this course considers the aesthetic, political, and epistemological possibilities of sound. Prerequisite: FAMS 101 or permission of instructor. FAMS T & CCS HUM course. Katherine Groo—TR 11:00-12:15 PM (class) & W 1:10-4:00 PM (lab)\n\nFAMS 362: American Cinema of the 1970s\n\nCalled a “Decade Under the Influence,” and the “Last Golden Era of American Film,” the 1970s were a cultural pivot point and an astonishingly rich extended moment in the history of American Cinema. This course examines important American films and filmmakers of the late 1960s and 1970s and the cultural contexts from which they emerge. Students will learn to treat films as complex texts and to interpret cinema as a potent cultural force. FAMS H & CCS HUM, W course. Prerequisites: FAMS 101 or permission of instructor. Andy Smith TR 1:10-4:00 PM\n\nFAMS 420: Capstone\n\nThis required course for FAMS majors is a chance for students to synthesize their course of study into one major individual project. The capstone is a workshop-based experience where students design and complete either a critical or creative (or some combination of the two) media project that results in a public presentation of their most advanced work as FAMS majors. Open to senior FAMS majors only. FAMS C course. Two sections offered: Andy Smith (section 1), Katherine Groo (section 2). M 1:10-4:00 PM.\n\nTHTR 273: Writing Comedy for Performance\n\nintroduces students to writing humor for theater, media, and film, offering them intensive practice composing and performing texts that function within the conventions and boundaries of each genre.

FAMS E & CCS W, V course. Bob Goodman F 1:10-4:00 PM\n\nENG 350: Writing in the Age of Social Media\n\nHow did Wikipedia become one of the most successful writing projects in history? How did Amazon’s ranking system come to have such power over whether a book finds an audience? Does Facebook have a responsibility to police fake news on its platform? And if a piece of writing doesn’t appear on the first three pages of a Google search, does it even exist? By addressing some of these questions, this course will ask students to consider how computational systems, from social media to search engines, influence the production, circulation, and consumption of writing. FAMS E & CCS W course. Tim Laquintano MWF 1:10-2:00 PM\n\nSUMMER SESSION 1"
