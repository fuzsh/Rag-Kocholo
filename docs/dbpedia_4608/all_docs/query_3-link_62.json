        "text": "As a golden sun bathed the rolling countryside in a warm glow, the patriarchs of the Ure family bridged a century-old divide between past and present with 155 descendants standing as a testament to the hard work, faith, and family that built the cherished cornerstone in eastern Summit County.\n\nThe 834-acre Kamas Valley farm served as the backdrop for a powerful three-day reunion last week as the prominent family prepared to bid a final farewell to their homestead. It was a bittersweet occasion thick with nostalgia and humility as the Ures embraced the chance to honor the past and celebrate the future of the land.\n\nRunning the Ure Ranch has been a family affair ever since James Ure homesteaded the property in 1892, passed down from parent to child throughout the 20th century. The most recent generation of sons inherited the property from their father in 2010, but after decades of dairy and cattle production, they decided to change course.\n\nSummit County in March 2023 announced it had reached an agreement to purchase the gateway property from the family for $25 million to keep it out of developers’ hands and help protect the agricultural legacy that the Ures’ ancestors had established. Officials were also interested in the property because of its large size and its proximity to the Uinta Mountains and Weber River watershed.\n\nKent Ure, the sixth of seven boys, said the family started considering selling the farm a few years ago when the agricultural industry started to slow down. There were multiple interested parties, but the deals never worked out.\n\nSome members of the Ure family were torn about the decision to sell the property, causing rifts between the brothers to deepen.\n\nDavid Ure, the fourth son, said the family has been at great odds since 2010, when his father, Ed Ure, passed away and left the ranch to his sons. David and his oldest brother Robert then took over day-to-day operations.\n\nThe Ures knew they wanted to host a reunion once the sales agreement was formalized because it would be the only opportunity for the extended family to celebrate their heritage on their ancestral land. Kent started organizing the event in October, creating a directory of descendants based on his brothers’ lineage.\n\n“The theme was honoring the past, cherishing that which our parents have given us and then celebrating the future,” he explained. “We wanted everybody to understand what took place from the founders of the ranch and have them understand that it wasn’t just the ranch they have roots to, but also into the establishment of Kamas itself.”\n\nYet the Ures didn’t realize the experience would also provide their family a chance to heal.\n\nDavid, a staunch Republican who served as a county councilor and state representative, joked the reunion was bad for him because it was eliminating his meanness.\n\n“I shook one of my brother’s hands for the first time in 13 years,” he said. All but one Ure attended.\n\nThe three-day event involved Scottish games, property tours and family meals, but the family also connected over stories about the legacy of the farm and the impact the Ures had on the local community. Ages ranged from seven months to almost 80 years.\n\nThey learned about the first Ures who traveled to the Kamas Valley from Scotland in 1888 and how the farmland was claimed under the provisions of the Homestead Act. The original 161 acres are still a part of the current property and include the land where the milk barn and farm buildings are now located. Other family contributions include a cheese factory, boarding house, hotel, bank and general store.\n\nThe Ures also learned about the still-standing farmhouse that was built on Lambert Lane in 1926. Then they heard what it was like for Ed and Lou Jean to raise seven boys over 19 years while they worked the land and taught them to be good neighbors. Lou Jean was petrified of mice, baked six loaves of bread every other day and canned pounds of fruit every year for her family.\n\n“I’m not raising calves, I’m raising boys,” David recalled his father telling a neighbor.\n\nThe Ures emphasized the importance of learning about their heritage because it encourages gratitude and self-improvement. David said each family member should improve upon what they were given and let each generation know where it comes from. They also have a responsibility to act as a contributor rather than a consumer.\n\nDavid became emotional as he spoke about the connection of family and the sense of belonging that comes with it. He said it’s remarkable that almost 200 people spread across 15 states, half of whom had never met, came together in one place when there’s so much division nationwide.\n\nThere’s a photo of Jim and Eleanor Ure, the brothers’ grandparents and stewards of the property, that represents the family’s journey. The couple is pictured near a rock on a hillside to the west of the farm, likely during the 1920s or ’30s, overlooking the ranch. It’s the only photo showing a glimpse of their daily life and character from that time.\n\nIt now symbolizes the Ures’ steadiness, reflecting how the family has grown large enough to field three professional football teams.\n\nThe Ures could’ve chosen to sell out to developers, but Kent said they believe partnering with Summit County is the best way to ensure the community benefits. He said the family doesn’t care for publicity. Instead, they just want to be known for making the community a better place.\n\nSummit County Council Vice Chair Tonja Hanson highlighted how the conservation easement will do just that. The only East Side resident on the County Council, she spoke about how the acquisition will help save more land in the area.\n\nHanson also has agricultural roots. Her family entered into a conservation easement in 2007 after decades of working the land.\n\nShe, like some of the Ures, questioned whether it was the right decision at the time. But Hanson realized she didn’t want to see development corrupt the views, and she came to value the importance of saving family lands.\n\n“For 28 years I lived right down the road here,” she said. “The view out of my living room and my front porch was the Ure Ranch’s North Meadows. … The view is spectacular as you can see through the entire Kamas Valley. You’ve probably experienced some of the sunrises and sunsets. Amazing. This is truly God’s country. You see, I love the Ure Ranch too.”\n\nHanson noted Summit County is committed to preserving open space, particularly outside of the Snyderville Basin. Most of the money from the $50 million open space bond that voters passed in November 2021 is earmarked for the East Side.\n\nThe future is still a work in progress, she said, but it’s clear residents value open space and recreation.\n\nSummit County is still deciding how to use the 834-acre Ure Ranch, but the goal is to “keep it real, keep it rural.” There’s the 185-acre North Meadows portion that will be permanently protected from development and used for agriculture or grazing.\n\nThe remaining 649-acre ranch area has been divided into other sections. Officials are considering attainable housing, small business opportunities, an education or training center, recreational amenities such as trails and community gathering spaces. Community members earlier this year advocated for keeping the land largely untouched.\n\nAlthough there’s been some criticism about the county’s plans for the property, the Ure family affirmed they willingly sold the land and said they have no regrets.\n\nOnly David and Rob’s line have an active connection to farming, while the other Ures have ended up in other fields such as health care, technology and engineering.\n\n“I do know this: 110 years from right now the Ure Ranch will still be known as the Ure Ranch because of the conservation easement,” David said."
