        "text": "\"20 years on, Lan Yu remains the pinnacle of Chinese queer cinema\" - Little White Lies\n\nFilmed in secret, this tender romance by Stanley Kwan combines the conventions of classic melodrama with a radically frank depiction of queer intimacy as it traces, over the course of years, the relationship between a wealthy businessman (Hu Jun) and a young student (Liu Ye).\n\nLan Yu was first released in Hong Kong in 2001, directed by emerging auteur Stanley Kwan, who burst onto the international scene at the Berlin Film Festival in 1991 with Centre Stage.\n\nThe film was selected in Un Certain Regard at 54th Cannes Film Festival and won five awards at the 38th Golden Horse Awards including Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay."
