        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nThis was going to be Wei Ying’s big archaeological break, for sure.\n\nIt’d come to him in the dead of the night—a set of convoluted directions leading to a sacred site never before uncovered. He’d packed up and left the apartment hours later without even uttering a single word to Jiang Cheng (who was, of course, still in bed), before getting onto multiple flights, long-haul bus rides, hitchhiking along the way and finally, embarking on a gruelling trek on foot. It wasn’t the first time he’d slipped away on a hunt for some ancient ruin, and so he’d somehow, once again, forgotten to inform Jiang Cheng of his plans. He’d been too absorbed writing notes down in his journal and documenting every step of his journey, already looking forward to reporting his findings to his professor once his little archaeological exploration was complete.\n\nBut it turned out that getting to the cave wasn’t the hardest thing—surviving it was.\n\nAs he ventured deeper, the cave’s true nature slowly revealed itself. Each turn presented him with a new death trap: unsteady grounds fissuring open, poisonous insects swarming in impossible numbers, and deadly landslides sealing off his only known route back to safety.\n\nIn one final, grim warning, the ceiling above even caved in on him, as though determined to keep Wei Ying away from the perilous dangers lurking deeper within.\n\nBut Wei Ying rarely ever paid heed to the cryptic warnings of fate.\n\nWith grim determination, Wei Ying began to dig through the debris with his bare, bloodied hands.\n\nThe Heavens have led him here for a reason.\n\nAnd he was determined to find out why.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIt took him hours, but Wei Ying finally managed to crawl out from beneath the crushing layers of rubble and ancient earth.\n\nIt was a miracle his backpack had made it this far with him. Even after everything he’d been through, his injuries were surprisingly minor; just a sore shoulder and some cuts and scratches, but nothing he couldn’t handle. Clutching his bloodied left shoulder, Wei Ying dragged his feet forward.\n\nAnd found himself marvelling at the impossible wonders that graced his eyes.\n\nHe now stood in an overwhelmingly large chamber.\n\nThis… This was all new information. New to him, obviously, but most importantly, new to the world.\n\nNo one had ever ventured this far, reached a place buried so deep, and would live to recount the experience. No one else… but him!\n\nSuch a place had never been recorded in any book or studies. There were no records of ceilings and walls this high, soaring above him, looking as though they were crafted and sculpted for giants rather than humans.\n\nHe knew he’d been called here for a reason!\n\nThe divinities have chosen him!\n\nNow, what lost civilisation was he about to discover?\n\nWei Ying quickly flicked on his flimsy torch, shaking it twice to bring it back to life. As the dim beam swept across the four walls, ancient paintings slowly came into focus. The artwork was astonishing; each wall was covered with elaborate scenes depicting the triumphant feats and war victories of a singular imposing figure, a fearsome leader… who very well might have been an emperor!\n\nAlready, Wei Ying’s mind was racing, trying to match the figure with every king and conqueror he had ever read about. The man was portrayed with flowing long hair and piercing golden eyes, his lean yet muscular build exuding both regal elegance and strength. He wore heavy battle gear, resplendent with opulent gold embellishments. Across his forehead was tied a ribbon with a cloud crest, the significance of which was lost on Wei Ying. Wei Ying sifted through his vast knowledge of historical leaders, desperately searching for a name or a face that had made a name for themselves through battle. But none came to mind.\n\nIt was hard for Wei Ying to fathom such a thing, considering how much blood, sweat and tears he had dedicated to his studies, unless…\n\nAnd then it struck him, in an almost fatal, overwhelming burst of excitement.\n\nUnless!\n\nSaid leader had always been absent from the historical records.\n\nBecause his kingdom never existed on the map!\n\nHow many unknown kings had been lost to the cruel passage of time?\n\nHow many nations had completely vanished without a trace?\n\nThis was what Wei Ying was destined for.\n\nWei Ying’s lips parted in a soft gasp of awe as he took a step closer to the walls, his hand eagerly reaching out to palm the ancient art.\n\nBefore he could even get close, however, his knee pressed into something so cold and…unyielding.\n\nStraining his eyes, Wei Ying shone his torch down.\n\nAnd discovered nothing but a dazzling gleam of gold. Chasing the beam of light, he followed the trail of ancient, divine treasures; and found shimmering gold lining all four walls.\n\nThe chamber was strewn with these priceless relics—ornate statues, gilded vessels, artisanal lacquerware, and intricate jewellery—all seemingly untouched by time.\n\nThis crypt must contain more than a thousand of these precious artefacts!\n\nMy, wasn’t this ruler a greedy one?\n\nTo think so much wealth was being hoarded in one place—for centuries.\n\nWei Ying didn’t even know where to start.\n\nJiang Cheng would be so jealous to hear of this!\n\nHe wanted to reach for his backpack and pull out his journal to record his findings, but as he took a step back, he unexpectedly bumped into yet another cold, hard thing. Startled, his hands instinctively shot out for support. His palms grasped the thick edge of the offending object, wincing slightly at the impact.\n\nHuh. How peculiar. It was long, and smooth, and overly tall, and... very rectangular.\n\nWei Ying took a moment to feel the contours of the object, his curiosity piqued.\n\nRaising his torch with his other hand, he carefully manoeuvred around, trying to get a better view. The flickering light from his torch danced across its surface, casting shifting shadows. His heart raced as strikingly familiar features came into view…\n\n…And a painted face met his eyes.\n\nA sarcophagus…!\n\nCrafted with such intricately carved, heavy gold.\n\nThis… This was an emperor’s coffin!\n\nWei Ying nearly dropped his torch as a pair of otherworldly golden eyes stared right back at him. How could a mere artist’s illustration evoke such fear?! The eyes, with their penetrating gaze, were unnervingly lifelike. Below them, the nose was elegantly shaped, reminiscent of polished jade, and the flowing lines etched into the gold captured the grace of his long hair. The craftsmanship was so refined that the face looked as though it would take a breath of its own in the very next moment.\n\nThis… This was definitely the man painted on the walls!\n\nSuddenly, a chilling realisation hit Wei Ying. If this was indeed a coffin and these were his chambers, then did that mean…\n\nHis heart leapt into his throat. With hot blood pumping through his veins, he set the torch down on the edge of the coffin and readied himself. He pushed against the lid with all his strength… and waited. The coffin groaned and resisted, barely shifting, and every inch felt like an eternity, but—shift it did! The lid creaked open slowly, dislodging spiderwebs that fluttered down in the darkness.\n\nWei Ying’s hands uncontrollably trembled.\n\nHe had been right.\n\nThe very man—entombed for who knows how long—had been laid to rest, just within.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBe still, my heart, Wei Ying told himself, trying to quell his excitement.\n\nHow long had it been since they’d uncovered a mummified corpse like this? His professor was going to be so proud.\n\nWei Ying knew the right thing to do was to leave this place and bring in a professional excavation team to handle this discovery properly. But he had never struck such gold before—metaphorically, and literally!\n\nA proper excavation could take weeks, and the thought of waiting until then was unbearable.\n\nHis professor could lambast him and pull his ears all he wanted later.\n\nUntil then, this ancient find was for him and him alone to savour.\n\nTaking in a deep breath, he steadied himself, and began to push again with all of his might.\n\nThe lid continued to resist stubbornly, and Wei Ying strained against its weight.\n\nJust how massive is this thing? he thought, sweat beading on his forehead. It feels like I’m going to have to push forever!\n\nBut just as Wei Ying was about to take a much-needed break, the heavy cover suddenly popped off with relative ease, as if the centuries-old lid had sensed his exhaustion and growing urge to give up.\n\nMomentarily stunned, Wei Ying watched as the lid clattered aside, revealing the dark interior of the coffin. To his disappointment, instead of the mummified remains he had expected, he found only a thick layer of clay.\n\nWait, why would a coffin be filled to the brim with only clay?\n\nFrowning with confusion, Wei Ying tentatively placed his hand on the top of the clay, and once he saw there were no adverse reactions to his skin, began to dig. The clay was unusually soft and pliable, coming away with little resistance, as if it had been freshly laid; it must have been remarkably well-preserved over the centuries.\n\nHis excitement mounting, Wei Ying’s hands worked furiously, scooping out large quantities of the clay. The more clay he excavated, the more frantic his movements grew. He dug down, his arms aching from the relentless effort, until he reached a depth of at least two feet.\n\nThat was when his fingers traced against the distinct shape of what felt like the tip of a nose.\n\nWei Ying’s breath caught in his throat.\n\nHis frantic digging slowed to a cautious pace as he focused on the area where he thought there would be a face.\n\nWei Ying braced himself, heart pounding, for the terror that might meet his eyes. Mummified remains were never pretty, having seen his fair share of them over his (short and young) lifetime.\n\n“Let’s see if you’re as pretty as your paintings,” Wei Ying muttered aloud to himself.\n\nHe carefully removed the last bit of clay, leaned back… and almost fell back in shock, his eyes wide with disbelief.\n\nThis… This was the most handsome man he’d ever seen in his life, dead or alive.\n\nHow was it even possible?\n\nWhat lay before him was a face that seemed to defy time itself—a countenance so devastatingly beautiful and hauntingly serene that it took his breath away.\n\nThe hair was long and silken, cascading in delicate waves around a strong, chiselled jawline. Long, dark lashes framed eyes that were closed in a peaceful, eternal slumber. His brows were naturally thick and expressive, adding to his masculine allure. His skin looked smooth and flawless, resembling fine porcelain, unmarred by any blemishes or imperfections. It looked lightly tanned from the war, yet fair enough to denote the status of an emperor.\n\nAcross his forehead lay the ribbon with the cloud crest, just like in the paintings. Massive gold earrings, exquisitely forged into the shape of fearsome dragons, dangled from his ears, while a thick gold plate rested on his chest.\n\nJust the mere sight of him was enough to bring Wei Ying to his knees. Was this how loyal subjects felt back in those days when they had to submit to their chosen emperor? Wei Ying thought he finally understood the feeling.\n\nHe knew he wasn’t supposed to, but he became greedy. He craved a touch.\n\nJust a tiny, little one.\n\nHis fingers reached out, and grazed the side of the emperor’s cheek.\n\nHoly fuck.\n\nIt was so unbearably soft—just like a human’s!\n\nWhat preservation technique was this? How had it never been discovered before this day?\n\nWere they a superior race? Did they learn witchcraft? Was this sort of mummification even humanly possible? Had they somehow perfected their own specialised mummification technique?\n\nIf someone told Wei Ying that the man lying before him was still alive, he would believe it without any hesitation!\n\nIn fact, if his heart started beating in the very next second, Wei Ying wouldn’t even be surprised.\n\n(Oh, be so very careful for what you wish for, Wei Ying.)\n\nStill grasping the man’s cheek, Wei Ying was struck with a rare unwillingness to let go.\n\nWhat a pity that someone as good-looking as him was dead!\n\n“Wow, you’re exactly my type,” Wei Ying teasingly chuckled out loud, only because he knew no one else was present to hear his words. Marvelling at the emperor’s handsomeness, Wei Ying continued to playfully jest, “If you were still alive, I’d definitely want to marry someone like you…!”\n\nAfter all, no one said Wei Ying couldn’t indulge in his own fantasies. He was a twenty-three year old virgin who had pursued academia his whole life and had never once dated, so it was perfectly normal to still lust after things like his ‘ideal type’.\n\nJust let Wei Ying indulge in this moment for a while more, and he would get back to inscribing his notes…\n\nLost in his reverie, Wei Ying failed to notice that the abandoned oil lamps littering the chamber had slowly ignited, one by one. The chamber, bathed in darkness and mystery just moments before, had seemingly awakened with soft, golden fires flaring to life in every corner of the room.\n\nThe light gradually spread, as though preparing a warm and majestic welcome for its maker’s return to the world.\n\nWei Ying glanced away for just a second, but that fleeting moment was enough for those slumbering eyes to snap wide open, revealing a pair of piercing golden orbs—now vividly alive.\n\nA hand emerged from the sunken clay, moving with an unsettlingly refined grace. Cold and smooth, it gently wrapped around Wei Ying’s slender wrist, as if it were extremely careful not to bruise or hurt Wei Ying in any way.\n\nIt held him in place with carefully restrained strength, that was just enough to keep him from escaping.\n\n“I have heard your proposal,” came a voice from the shadows, so sweet and gentle and yet so undeniably authoritative. What followed next was not a mere answer—but a definitive pronouncement! “And I accept.”\n\n…Wait, what?!\n\nWei Ying’s heart thudded to a standstill in his chest.\n\nWhat brand new trouble had he landed himself in, this time?!\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEverything happened so quickly that Wei Ying could barely register it. The man in the coffin slowly sat up from the clay, brushing the remnants off from his shoulders with much ease.\n\nWei Ying took an involuntary step back as he came face-to-face with the domineering emperor. He was—definitely far larger, and his presence far more imposing than Wei Ying had expected, although this explained the size and weight of the coffin that encased him. While he knew that people from centuries ago were generally built bigger and much taller, with sharper reflexes and greater physical prowess, he had only encountered a few rare corpses of this nature in passing. This was his first opportunity to ever encounter one of them alive in the flesh, in person.\n\nWhat the hell were they eating back then?! How had mankind shrunk so drastically in size in just a few centuries?!\n\nAs the man rose before him, the sheer scale of his physique and his dominating presence became glaringly evident. He was built like a god. Wei Ying could feel the palpable weight of the emperor’s aura, an awe-inspiring and intimidating force that seemed to effortlessly command the entire space around them. Wei Ying had no doubt in his heart that this man wielded his innate power to subjugate countless lands and armies. For someone of his stature and presence, conquering others must have been as natural as breathing!\n\nAnd yet, there was something so peculiar about him...\n\nUnlike how he was depicted in the ancient artwork on the walls, the handsome man before Wei Ying was not adorned in rich battle armour or regal military garb. No, rather, he was draped in a long, elaborate robe of deep red, a colour so rich and vibrant, rather reminiscent of the attire worn by a groom on his wedding day. The robe flowed elegantly around him, its intricate dragon embroidery and lavish golden design suggesting it’d been specially tailor-made for his big day.\n\nThe elaborate and ceremonial garment seemed almost out of place, amidst the ancient power that surrounded him.\n\nAs the man gracefully stepped out from the coffin, he meticulously brushed the clay from his gown, handling his robes in such a careful manner as if desperate to ensure that every inch of his attire would remain pristine for the grand ceremony that was to come.\n\nAlmost like he’d been eagerly anticipating this day, all of his life…\n\nBut how could he even anticipate that Wei Ying would come to him and jokingly propose, without having even met him before?!\n\nAnd yet, the subtle crinkle of his eyes and the slight twitch at the corner of his lips, hinting at a smile, suggested otherwise.\n\n“After all this time, you have finally come for me…” the man murmured incoherently under his breath, his hands reaching out as though yearning to touch Wei Ying—who, feeling increasingly uneasy, took another step back. Tilting his head to the right with an almost zombie-like intensity, the man’s gaze swept over Wei Ying with both wonder and affection, greedily taking in every detail from head to toe.\n\nWei Ying felt an eerie shiver run down his spine as he stood under the emperor’s scrutinising stare. Raising his hands in a defensive gesture, Wei Ying quickly stammered, his words tumbling out in a flurry, “Hey, uh, good-looking... um, mister corpse... I didn’t mean to offend! I just wanted to have a peek at your handsome face... heh... I mean, I swear, I wasn’t planning to do anything untoward to your body!”\n\nThe man cracked his neck and snapped it back up, as though finally relieving a centuries-old stiffness. While his face remained an inscrutable mask, the words from his mouth dripped with further shamelessness: “If you were to do something untoward to my body, it would be my greatest honour…”\n\nOkay, what the fuck?!?!?!?!!!!!!\n\nThe handsome mummy turned out to be a grade A pervert!!!!!!!!!\n\nHe took just a few steps forward, but his feet were big enough that two full steps easily covered the distance between him and Wei Ying.\n\nHe towered over Wei Ying easily, who now had to crane his neck awkwardly to meet the emperor’s piercing, immortal golden eyes. The paintings had indeed captured the startling intensity of those eyes well, but seeing them up close was a different experience altogether. What the hell were they so golden for?! Wei Ying was about to be blinded!\n\nWei Ying took everything back about his ‘ideal type’!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n“Hey... Listen, you can’t be taking my earlier proposal seriously, can you?” Wei Ying forced a nervous laugh, hoping that by doing so he would be able to convince the man he was just messing with him. “I mean, I’m naturally a bit of a joker, haha, just ask my brother… Please don’t take me seriously. Please, I beg you…”\n\nWei Ying assumed he would seriously meet his death, otherwise…\n\nThe man’s face sank into contemplation, his brows knitting together and his lips curling into a slight frown.\n\n“But I take you very seriously,” he whispered softly, his words carrying the full weight of his earnestness. “I will always take every word of yours seriously.”\n\nGaaah, mister handsome corpse, please don’t!!!!!!\n\n“Listen, I think there’s been a misunderstanding,” Wei Ying said, his voice trembling as he took three steps backward for every one the man took forward. He was adamant on not getting too distracted by the size of the man’s feet… His life was at stake here! “You and I, uh, we’re different. For one, ah, my heart is still beating, whereas yours, um, I’m sorry to inform you, has been dead for centuries…”\n\n“Centuries?” The man cocked his head to the side, fingers pinching his own chin thoughtfully. “Perhaps… a millennium.”\n\nH...Huh?\n\nWei Ying’s eyes widened in shock. “A millennium?” he stuttered.\n\n“Millenniums,” the man corrected himself, as the realisation slowly settled in. “I believe it has been thousands of years.”\n\nNo wonder there was no trace of this emperor in any records!\n\n“That’s exactly it!” Wei Ying blabbered, struggling to keep his composure. “You’re, well, an undead corpse from millenniums ago. I like older men, but not that old!” The man actually had the decency to look wounded at that, and Wei Ying almost felt pang of guilt at that. Almost. “Plus plus plus, I’m still human, alive, and, um, not exactly your size…”\n\n“You are indeed much smaller than me,” the man observed with much fondness, sizing Wei Ying up once more with curious eyes. His hands lifted slightly, as though they were on the verge of reaching out to measure and fondle with Wei Ying’s waist. “How intriguing… But it suits you.”\n\nWei Ying didn’t even know how to respond to that! Was that a genuine compliment, or a backhanded one?!\n\n“However, you are severely mistaken,” the man continued to say, his voice now strangling with genuine frustration. “In that I am no longer alive, and that my heart no longer beats... For how can it be that just a single glimpse of your face is already making my heart race uncontrollably?”\n\nHe extended a hand towards Wei Ying, inviting him to check for himself. And because Wei Ying is an archaeology nut and still in great disbelief at the thought of a millennia-dead corpse possessing a fully functioning heart, Wei Ying hesitantly accepted the man’s hand and allowed himself to be guided to the emperor’s chest.\n\nHe did not miss the man’s lips curling up into a soft smile as he did so.\n\nPervert!!!!!!!!!\n\nThere, Wei Ying’s small hand lay in the large, warm grasp of the emperor, directly over where his absent heart should be.\n\nThud, thud, thud.\n\nThudthudthudthudthudthud—\n\nWhat the fuck, it really existed!!!\n\nAnd the rhythmic pounding under his palm was not only present—but increasing in intensity with every passing second!!!!!!!\n\nHow was it beating even faster now that Wei Ying’s hand had made contact?!!!!\n\nAnd yet, the man’s touch remained as cold as ice...\n\n\"That can’t be,\" Wei Ying gasped aloud, his eyes meeting the emperor’s in shocked amazement. “B…Blood no longer pumps through your veins!”\n\n“It does not,” the man conceded, rather thoughtfully. “The blood no longer flows, but the muscles remember what it felt like to be alive, to experience love. And this,” he continued softly, his murmur coloured with a hint of melancholy as he met Wei Ying’s gaze with profound seriousness, “is a state of love.”\n\nAny other day, Wei Ying might have crumbled into a fit of flushed embarrassment.\n\nBut this... This was different.\n\n“You are a grand work of wonder,” Wei Ying whispered out, in pure astonishment. “I have never... in my entire life, I have never encountered anything like you.”\n\nAnd to think, Wei Ying could be the first to get his hands on this sort of specimen…\n\n(Would the man allow Wei Ying to probe and cut at him, to examine every inch of him and study his every detail, he wonders?)\n\nHowever, the man’s gaze noticeably softened at Wei Ying’s words, having assumed he meant something else… of a more romantic nature.\n\n“And I, you. I…am so incredibly fond of you.”\n\n…Okay, now Wei Ying is actually feeling guilt at this one.\n\nThe man’s other hand gently clasped over Wei Ying’s, still resting over his chest. His heartbeat continued to echo against Wei Ying’s palm—steady and insistent.\n\nThudthudthudthudthud…\n\n“It is decided then,” the man abruptly declared, his voice firm as he lowered his head, guiding Wei Ying’s hand to his face just so he could nuzzle childishly against his touch. Like this, the man no longer looked menacing; but rather, much like a puppy…\n\n“My love. We shall be wedded—immediately.”\n\nH-Huh?! Wei Ying had already forgotten about all of that!\n\nWhy was he still harping on it?!\n\n“Wait, wait!” Wei Ying exclaimed quickly, pulling his hand away slightly. “How, how is that even going to work? I’ve already told you, we’re too different... And we’re strangers! We barely know each other. I don’t even know your name! Did people from your time not introduce themselves properly to each other before marrying?!”\n\nWei Ying had to stall for time, no matter what!\n\nHe needed to find a way to dupe this man to leave the cave, and then Wei Ying might stand a chance at survival.\n\n(Wei Ying would get all of his tools ready, and study the man inside out!)\n\nThe look on the man’s face shifted as he considered Wei Ying’s words, his eyes reflecting a bout of realisation and chagrin. He looked genuinely troubled by his oversight. With a long, deep breath, he sank to one knee on the ground before Wei Ying.\n\nHe bowed his head slightly. “Forgive me,” he said. “I should have honoured you with a proper introduction first before making such a bold proposal.”\n\nRaising his head, he assumed a regal stance with a gaze of unshakable steadiness.\n\n“I am Lan Zhan, known by my courtesy name, Lan Wangji. In my time, I ruled all that was under Heaven. I held the esteemed position of Second Prince-General, ascending eventually to my rightful position of Emperor. I was not only a sovereign but also a son, a brother, and a nephew. At the height of my power, I commanded 800,000 elite guards. However, as of now, my forces are but 30,000.”\n\nWei Ying’s confusion deepened as he heard the very number. “30,000?” he repeated, a wry laugh escaping his lips. “You speak as though they are still alive.”\n\nThat couldn’t be right… Right?\n\nLan Zhan frowned, as though Wei Ying’s words had only just registered. “You are correct,” he admitted solemnly, pulling himself back up to his feet. “I have yet to awaken them.”\n\nIn one deliberate motion, Lan Zhan swept his hand high into the air. His fingers, each adorned with an array of golden rings, glistened brilliantly under the light. A deep, resonant sound emanated from his throat; a guttural bellow that seemed to originate from the very depths of his being. It reverberated through the air with an almost primal power.\n\n“Rise,” he demanded, in an ancient language Wei Ying hardly recognised.\n\nFlames flickered and crackled, as fires fiercely roared to life in the background. The once-dormant chamber now vibrated with a sense of indescribable mana.\n\nWei Ying’s knees buckled as he took in the full extent of his surroundings. How had he never noticed this before? The chamber was lined with coffins—dozens of them, each a testament to an era long past. They were not as grand as Lan Zhan’s, but the size and weight of them were rather substantial in their own right.\n\nThe coffins, which had been silent and still just moments before, began to tremble and shake. Lids flew off with a resounding clatter, with some coffins almost exploding open with the sheer size of their occupants. A few of the more restless ones did not wait for the lids to be removed but instead punched through the tops with violent force.\n\nOne by one, mummified corpses broke free from their thousand-year-old restraints. Every one of them was still clad in full battle armour, the metalwork looking still new and polished.\n\nUnsurprisingly, all of them also dwarfed Wei Ying in size.\n\nWei Ying could only watch in dazed wonder as the guards fell to one knee before their god-emperor with martial readiness, ready to proclaim in fervour:\n\n“Long live Your Majesty! With your reawakening, you have granted us glorious life once more! Just as in ages past, mortals will tremble before the might of the all-powerful emperor, and all creatures will yield to your command! With your return, a new era dawns upon us!”\n\nEven after their voices long faded, the echoes of their pledges could be heard ringing throughout the rest of the cave.\n\nIt only occurred to Wei Ying belatedly that it was not just an echo: the surrounding rooms had come alive with similar, thunderous waves of loyalty.\n\nThe rest of the 30,000 guards, buried deep within these caves, have all been awakened!\n\nWhat in the living hell! Wei Ying had really accidentally brought an ancient race back to life!!!!!!\n\nWhat the fuck was he supposed to do now?????\n\nAs his face slowly paled, Wei Ying shakily turned his attention back to Lan Zhan. All of this—it was far too overwhelming for him at a go. Wei Ying thought he was going to hyperventilate, and then pass out.\n\nYet, Lan Zhan remained a picture of tender affection, his face softening with a look of admiration and awe directed solely at his Wei Ying. His hand, elegant and poised, reached out to caress the side of Wei Ying’s face, his touch hesitant yet—wanting so badly to hold him.\n\n“We have waited for your return, for thousands of years,” Lan Zhan murmured to him, in a whisper full of longing.\n\nWei Ying’s heart thrummed, as he instinctively tried to shy away from his hand. “Mister emperor, please, you’ve got this all wrong... How could that be? We have only just met.”\n\nLan Zhan’s smile remained gentle, almost wistful.\n\n“Have you not felt a void within your heart throughout your life, a yearning you could not quite place? Have you not been searching for something all your life, to fill that emptiness inside of you?”\n\nWei Ying’s breaths stuttered. How could this man possibly…\n\n“Has your search not led you here?” Lan Zhan’s voice was almost pleading, at this point... “To this very place, to me?”\n\nLan Zhan’s hand, which was now gently resting on Wei Ying’s chin, carefully turned Wei Ying’s face towards the wall behind them.\n\nThere, illuminated by the flickering firelight, was an ancient mural that had gone unnoticed until now. The painting, illustrated with painstaking detail, depicted Lan Zhan and his Imperial Consort in their wedding attire, set against the luxurious backdrop of the grand imperial palace. It was clear beyond doubt; Lan Zhan was drawn wearing the very same robes that he was clad in right now. The both of them looked so happy together, their eyes locked in a gaze brimming with laughter and joy. The colours, though faded with time, still held a lofty vibrancy. And the Imperial Consort’s features, as serene and regal as they were, were painted with such precision that it was impossible to ignore the resemblance.\n\nWei Ying’s stomach churned. The likeness was so striking, it felt as though he were looking into the mirror, himself.\n\nHow… How was this possible…\n\nAs Wei Ying stood frozen, Lan Zhan’s gaze remained patient, and unwavering. He took care to speak softly, his voice sounding hopeful: “Do you still not believe me, my sweet Wei Ying?”\n\nLan Zhan had already long known his name, all this while.\n\nBehind them, the guards began to roar once more with reverent enthusiasm:\n\n“The Imperial Consort has returned to our Benevolent Ruler! A new era has commenced!”\n\n“A new era has commenced!”"
