        "text": "A team of neuroscientists who studied jazz guitarists find common factors in how they achieved a flow state and what their brains have done to help flow arise more easily.\n\nWith echoes of Clint Eastwood’s spaghetti Westerns, fight scenes featuring some cool weapons, and a great ending, The Avenging Eagle was part of Shaw Brothers’ ‘last hurrah’, film producer Frank Djeng says.\n\nFrom a deeply upsetting movie about a necrophiliac to a ‘mentally scarring’ film about black magic, an expert on Hong Kong cinema picks his five favourite horror movies produced in the city.\n\nFrom launching Jackie Chan’s career with kung fu comedies to helping end big studios’ stranglehold on filming, Ng See-yuen has had a huge influence on Hong Kong cinema.\n\nFrom a Tony Leung Chiu-wai crime thriller to a stylised hit-girl drama to a weird triad fantasy, we revisit and rate the first five films from Milkyway Image, formed by producer-directors Johnnie To and Wai Ka-fai.\n\nChor Yuen’s 1973 film The House of 72 Tenants took in more money than Bruce Lee’s Enter the Dragon in Hong Kong, and making it in Cantonese, not Mandarin Chinese, proved a turning point for the industry.\n\nTaiwanese actress-director Sylvia Chang has spoken to the Post on many subjects, from saying no to Hollywood and Asian stereotypes to making films on women. We recall her most quotable quotes.\n\nWe look beyond the dangerous stunts and innovative action sequences, and martial arts stars like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, to discover why Hong Kong films have often travelled so well.\n\nHealth-centric technologies are being used to make self-care ‘a cornerstone of modern living spaces’ – think smart mattresses, and interactive art that can ‘transform you based on your movement, heartbeat or mood’.\n\nThe Valiant Ones, King Hu’s 1975 martial arts drama, was rediscovered after being ‘lost’ for two decades. A film critic tells the Post why it stands out from the director’s other films.\n\nAdults-only and mainstream crime films, sex films, and serious dramas with Alex Law and Ann Hui – Simon Yam has done them all. Good-looking and with an expressive face, he has a work ethic second to none.\n\nGordon Liu, who sneaked off to learn kung fu behind his parents’ backs as a child, has had a career that spanned decades. Notably, he appeared as two different characters in the Kill Bill films.\n\nShuang Li grew up in Fujian listening to discarded CDs of American band My Chemical Romance. Her favourite band inspires the art in her New York exhibition I’m Not.\n\nHit 2010 film Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame, starring Andy Lau, had many of the hallmarks of Tsui Hark’s earlier wuxia films. Sammo Hung choreographed the action. Two more films followed.\n\nFruit Chan Gor’s Made in Hong Kong, The Longest Summer and Little Cheung depict Hong Kong working-class life at the time of the handover from British to Chinese rule, and the start of cultural change.\n\nInspired casting, with Andy Lau facing off against Maggie Q and Sammo Hung narrating, helped Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon succeed. Martial arts scenes light up God of War, some involving Hung.\n\nThe New York Met’s exhibition of Harlem Renaissance art features 160 works, most by black artists, that depict daily life in black communities such as Harlem from the 1920s to 1940s.\n\nInfernal Affairs, the 2002 psychological Hong Kong cop drama starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Andy Lau, was a box-office hit, but proved a hard act to follow when the studio asked for two more films.\n\nThe wellness industry is waking up to men’s needs the way it has done to women’s – with emotional support groups and bonding retreats, rather than just exercises in physical strength and extreme mastery.\n\nIn 1975’s The Man from Hong Kong, Jimmy Wang Yu thought he had found the vehicle that would propel him to Bruce Lee-level international fame – but the James Bond-like film did not click with viewers.\n\nHold You Tight and Lan Yu were daring films for their time. The first stars Chingmy Yau, then an actress in adults-only films, as a bored wife who has an affair, while the latter is a stylish gay drama.\n\nIn 1998, Rush Hour shot Jackie Chan to international fame. But after making the film with Chris Tucker, Chan ultimately decided not to abandon Hong Kong, and continued to make films in both places.\n\nViva Erotica (1996) and Vulgaria (2012) are two contrasting Category III satirical films that reveal a different side of Hong Kong’s once-famed, often crazy adult movie industry.\n\nHong Kong actor and director Wu Ma had a prolific career in front of and behind the camera. His best film, The Dead and the Deadly, showed the formula for success.\n\nThe first two Ip Man movies, directed by Wilson Yip, use old-school kung fu, nationalism and fabrications to make the eponymous martial artist, and the actor who plays him, Donnie Yen, household names.\n\nAt the start of his career, Asian-American director Wayne Wang worked in his native Hong Kong and the United States, growing as a filmmaker, before shooting his first big hit, The Joy Luck Club.\n\nAnn Hui’s The Secret (1979), based on a real-life double murder case, helped usher in the Hong Kong New Wave cinema movement, while it was also one of the few women-led films at the time."
