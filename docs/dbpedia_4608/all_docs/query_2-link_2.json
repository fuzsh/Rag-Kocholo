        "text": "“Terminator 2”: The First Partially CG Lead Character\n\nJames Cameron’s VFX Oscar winner from 1991 provided an important evolutionary step for Industrial Light & Magic and a leap forward for the industry: the first lead character in a feature who was partially CG. Under the leadership of VFX supervisor Dennis Muren, ILM was tasked with creating the “liquid metal” look for the shape-shifting T-1000 (Robert Patrick). Fortunately, they had a blueprint for their android assassin, courtesy of Cameron’s previous film, “The Abyss”: the pseudopod, the first photoreal CG water effect to take on human form — and another Oscar winner, to boot.\n\nChrome proved the key to the T-1000, because it was the most malleable material to work digitally. There were limitations to what the “Terminator 2” team could achieve, but with Muren’s knowledge of CG, Cameron’s vision for total reflectivity, and ILM’s talent for innovation, they created something awe-inspiring: a character who moved and morphed in step (thanks to an early use of mocap) with the actor’s praying-mantis-like performance. —BD\n\n“Beauty and the Beast”: A Stunning Marriage of 2D and 3D Animation Techniques\n\nOn its way to becoming the first animated feature nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, Disney’s acclaimed animated musical broke ground with its early use of CG. With the aid of the Pixar-developed Computer Animation Production System, or CAPS, the studio was able to combine hand-drawn character animation with sweeping camera moves during the romantic ballroom dance between Belle (Paige O’Hara) and the Beast (Robby Benson). The sequence required existing modeling and rendering software for the creation of the CG background and the ability to move the camera, a first for moving a background; additionally, CAPS, which was previously used to print out wireframes, was upgraded to provide the necessary 3D rendering, enabling the integration of the 3D background data as layers into the final composite. The result paved the way for more digital experimentation at Disney, including the creation of the “Deep Canvas” process for 1999’s “Tarzan,” which enabled 2D artists to make 3D paintings through which the camera freely moved. —BD\n\n“Jurassic Park”: The Dawning of a New Age in Digital Effects\n\nWhen director Steven Spielberg began work on “Jurassic Park,” the initial plan was for four of the brightest talents in effects to work together, bringing the best of what each had to offer. Creature creator Stan Winston was hired to design the dinosaurs, puppeteer and stop-motion master Phil Tippett would provide their movement and bring them to life, physical effects expert Michael Lantieri would manage the interaction between the actors and whatever practical dinosaurs could be built on set, and the aforementioned Dennis Muren would clean it all up in post and make it look real. When Muren’s Industrial Light & Magic colleague Mark A.Z. Dippé suggested that they attempt to make the dinosaurs entirely computer generated, Muren was skeptical — until dazzling test footage of a T-Rex lumbering across the screen proved it could be done.\n\nBuilding upon the advancements of “Young Sherlock Holmes,” “The Abyss,” and “Terminator 2,” “Jurassic Park” proved that computers could convincingly generate living, breathing creatures. “That was the moment that I suddenly saw that everything was going to change,” Spielberg tells Lawrence Kasdan in the documentary “Light & Magic.” “Not just my movie, but the entire world was going to follow. It was going to change everything for all of us and for audiences everywhere and we were never gonna go back.” Indeed, the world of models, miniatures, and matte paintings that had been the industry standard for over 70 years was almost immediately supplanted by the computer generated imagery that has now become standard, purists like Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino notwithstanding. —JH\n\n“Babe”: You Will Believe a Pig Can Talk\n\nThe underdog story about an orphaned pig winning a sheepherding competition revolutionized the talking animal movie in 1995. (And in an example of life imitating art, “Babe” beat the heavily favored “Apollo 13” for the VFX Oscar.) In a live-action first, the animals in the lead roles spoke their lines, rather than relying on a narrator or voiceover. It was the result of a landmark collaboration between VFX studio Rhythm & Hues and three animatronics studios: London-based Jim Henson Creature Shop and John Cox’s Creature Shop and Robotech in Australia. What they achieved started a new performance-driven trend in movies, thanks to overlaying CG animation on top of live-action animal footage and combining it with the animatronic performances. The key was advancing the projection mapping technique that Rhythm & Hues used on “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” to a whole new level of realism. They applied it to the faces of the animals through a process of splitting, deforming, and repositioning the animation. Meanwhile, the animatronics were pushed further with greater sophistication and nuance, controlled remotely by puppeteers, who handled the rest of the facial and body movements. The challenge was getting audiences to accept talking animals. Having done so, the groundwork was laid for more talking animal movies to follow. —BD\n\n“Toy Story”: Opening the CG Toy Box\n\nPixar officially came of age with the industry’s first CG-animated feature in 1995, and Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and the lovable gang of anthropomorphic toys changed the animation industry forever. CG offered a more three-dimensional, dynamic, and immersive experience than its hand-drawn predecessor. After laying the groundwork for a decade with its innovative shorts (including the Oscar-winning “Tin Toy”), Pixar pushed its talent and tech on the fly (led by co-founder Ed Catmull and creative head John Lasseter). They built a new animation system and used text-based modeling and brought in the fledgling PowerAnimator from Alias — luckily, when Woody’s face contorted during the rocket scene, it didn’t break the rig.\n\nBut they also needed computing power to store characters, sets, and props, and Pixar needed an infrastructure, including a tracking system for 1,500 shots and 120,000 frames. The studio was essentially laying the track as they were riding the train, making the equivalent of 10 shorts. They figured out how to use color to advance the story. But most importantly of all, “Toy Story” further humanized animation. —BD\n\n“Titanic”: Historically Epic Advances in VFX\n\nJames Cameron took a giant leap forward with his meticulous recreation of the most infamous shipwreck in history, mixing fact and fiction for an epic love story. Naturally, it required a massive VFX undertaking, supervised by guru Rob Legato. In a recent interview, Legator told IndieWire that it was impossible not to be moved by the image of the Titanic, its wreck and all that its history implied. The authenticity of the full-scale set, intercut with miniature photography and actual photography of the actual wreck was totally convincing. “That emotionally stirring realism, mixed with the intense impact of the story itself, created a moment that changed the nature of what can be achieved with visual effects,” Legato said.\n\nUp until then, almost all ships depicted in movies were miniatures shot in a water tank. However, water inevitably didn’t scale properly, which betrayed suspension of disbelief, forcing static cameras and quick edits. What Legato and the team at Digital Domain innovated was motion-controlled water. They also overcame previous film’s flimsy facsimiles of ship passengers through the innovative use of mocap, depicting realistic human behavior against extraordinary backdrops. “By forcing both realistic digital water and CG people into being, it allowed us creatively to design emotionally moving shots that took the audience from a distance to inside the ship, morphing from the Titanic in all its glory to the haunting sunken wreck on the ocean’s floor,” Legato added. The photorealism of the ship contributed to the impact of what became a game changer for tackling more VFX-driven stories deemed too difficult to attempt. —BD\n\n“The Celebration”: Dogme DV\n\nDigital cameras had been around for years, with the DigiBeta becoming a popular broadcast format. Those were big and expensive cameras, as was the post-production equipment required to edit it. What impacted independent and non-fiction cinema for years — and kicked off the DIY micro-budget filmmaking movement of the last quarter century — was the advent of DV cameras. Companies like Sony and Canon started to utilize small, affordable, and surprisingly effective 3-CCD sensors that record to miniature cassette tape that could handle 60 minutes of footage and be easily digitized (using the camera itself) to a non-linear editing system, especially Macromedia (and, later, Apple’s) affordable Final Cut Pro software, which required little more than a Mac with extra hard drive space.\n\nFuture Sundance lineups would be populated by full slates of indies shot on the $3000 Sony VX1000, which could be printed on 35mm film stock and projected in theaters. Yet the real turning point for this technology was the 1998 Cannes Film Festival and the premiere of Thomas Vinterberg’s “The Celebration” (“Festen”). Utilizing just a one-chip $700 consumer DV camera, Vinterberg had created a masterpiece (#85 of IndieWire’s best of the decade) that blew away the audience. Remembered today as being the film that turned Vinterberg and Lars Van Trier’s scribbled-in-45-minutes Dogme 95 manifesto into a film movement to shed artifice for the art form, what the director had really accomplished was creating a filmic language that leaned into what these new inexpensive cameras could do well.\n\nThe story of a son confronting the family patriarch at his birthday gathering, the film chronicles the collapse of that family under the weight of the buried truth being pulled up by the roots. Vinterberg used the camera’s inability to handle the natural low light, and the subsequent breaking up of the grainy image, to perfectly match the disintegration of the family over the course of a day turning to night. The small-bodied, easy to use handheld camera moves with the characters with increasing frenetic, uneasy energy, and made possible virtually any composition or shot within the confines of location shooting with little-to-no technical struggle.\n\nThe film’s incredible energy and verve was directly associated with the $700 camera (short-changing the visionary filmmaking), and the New York indie world returned from France with a fire lit under their asses. DV production companies like InDigEnt (John Sloss, Gary Winick, and IFC) and Blow Up Pictures (Sundance’s Joanna Vicente and Jason Kliot) quickly formed, promising slates of lower cost indies, as filmmakers like Rebecca Miller, Richard Linklater, Steven Soderbergh, Spike Lee, and Miguel Arteta were anxious to try their hand at something new. —CO\n\n“Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace”: Now THIS Is Digital Projection\n\nOn July 18, 1999, audiences in four theaters across the United States did something unprecedented: They watched a major studio release, and not a single reel of film ran through the projector. A little less than a year earlier the low-budget indie “The Last Broadcast” was exhibited digitally on a handful of screens, but the film that made its digital debut in the summer of ’99 was the one that would start a revolution. It was “Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace,” a film that broke ground thanks to the frustrations of its creator, George Lucas. Lucas had long been exasperated by what he called the “19th-century technology” of celluloid running through sprocket holes, and his EditDroid software from the 1980s had already transformed post-production — after he sold it to AVID in 1993 it took less than a decade for digital editing to become the industry standard.\n\nLucas’ goal of shooting an entire feature film digitally would have to wait until “Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones,” for which Sony successfully developed 24-fps HD cameras, but his dream of projecting digitally — to screen prints of his films that would look the same on the 100th viewing as the first, with no scratches or splices — was realized in 1999 on four screens in California and New Jersey. The difficulty and expense of converting theaters initially made both studios and exhibitors wary of the technology, but by “Episode II” Lucas expanded to around 20 American screens and by “Episode III” the number was more than three times that. Now, of course, it is virtually impossible to find a new commercial release projected in any manner but digital, a circumstance entirely driven by George Lucas’ Jedi-like determination to bend the universe to his will. —JH\n\n“The Matrix”: Hearing — and Seeing — The Matrix of Digital Sound\n\nLana and Lilly Wachowski’s philosophical cyberpunk odyssey, made at very end of the millennium, paved the way for how films look and feel in the 21st century, in ways that are obvious and celebrated. Take the “Bullet-Time” effect, for instance. Based on the multiple camera rig technique for freezing time, John Gaeta took the ways cameras can participate and guide action sequences to a new level for the iconic scene where bullets glide through the air in slow motion past Neo’s head.\n\nBut “The Matrix” also changed the game in ways that are mostly invisible unless you can see the code in the, er, Matrix. It was the first film to be digitally sound edited, using the ancestors to today’s Pro Tools and the small army of Digital Audio Workspaces (DAWs) that have, for better and for worse, made tools of filmmaking available on a massive scale. (Such software now comes pre-loaded onto every new computer.) At the time the film was made, the benefit of finally being able to see sound waveforms and tweak how sounds combine and crescendo in real time was balanced out by the laborious, time-consuming, clunky nature of the early software. If there hadn’t been a beautifully conceptual storytelling reason for doing it, then sound designer Dane Davis might not have found it worth the trouble. But part of what made the Wachowskis’ original quest to break free of a proscribed, oppressive, and artificial reality feel like finally hearing The Truth is how the digital soundscape can take over the film, from the moment Neo begins to perceive his consciousness being downloaded back into his sleeping body on the machines’ energy farm to the dangerously metallic, sharklike clicking of the machines swimming through the ruined real world. The advent of digital sound in “The Matrix” has given us the ability to have levels of both flexibility and control that is a huge part of what makes the way we make movies now possible. —SS"
