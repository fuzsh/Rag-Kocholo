After the screening, Director Kwan will interact with the audience virtually in the cinema.\n\nIn Chinese Panorama, catch 16 of the latest and best Chinese language films from across the world.

Set against this backdrop, the film depicts the lives and struggles of farmers dealing with cheap imports and high production costs.\n\nFrom China, Are You Lonesome Tonight? stars Taiwanese heartthrob Eddie Peng and Sylvia Chang as the male and female leads, and tells the story of a humble\n\nrepairman whose mundane life is upended by a tragic accident; and Mama, an independent film, depicts the memory of a 12-year-old girl about her family and village during the 1990’s.\n\nAnd from Malaysia, Layla Zhuqing Ji’s Victim(s) is a tale of Chinese high-school\n\nbullying in Malaysia. Inspired by a true story, it takes the case of a teenager\n\non trial for the cold-blooded murder of a classmate to determine the\n\nbroader accountability for such headline-grabbing incidents.\n\nSCFF2022 will also present three films using filmmakers as the subject in focus, namely, Striding Into the Wind, Ripples of Life, and Barbarian Invasion. There will also be a panel discussion, Tales of Filmmakers, where guest filmmakers share the charms and brilliance of such films.\n\nUnder Documentary Vision, a selection of six featured documentaries will shine the spotlight on the most talked-about topics in our times. This segment includes, from Hong Kong, Ode To Book People, which highlights the aspirations and struggles of three independent bookshops: ACO Books from Hong Kong, City Book Room from Singapore and Moontree House from Malaysia; A Life In Six Chapters focuses on famous left-wing writer Xiao Jun, who is also known as one of the great writers of Chinese modern literature.\n\nFrom Taiwan comes Crossing’s End, which documents two families implicated in a murder case in 2002 and discusses the sufferings, endurance, and faith of the two parties involved in the murder case; while No Man Is An Island documents how Taiwan’s first quarantine hotel emerged from anxiety and unease during the COVID-19 pandemic and how they overcame challenges faced in the vaccination process. China’s Father will be screened alongside Singapore short film From There To Here: both have grandsons, granddaughters, and grandfathers as the focus of the films, but while Father tells the story of kinship through the director’s lens, From There to Here uses an interview format to convey her grandfather’s sense of nostalgia as an early immigrant to Singapore.\n\nThe Chinese Shorts Showcase consists of the best short films selected from major film festivals. This segment features 23 films, presented in four categories under Chinese Shortcuts (including Where is Home?) and two categories of Documentary Shorts.\n\nThe second panel discussion, Independent Chinese Cinema: Present And Future Challenges, will help raise awareness and understanding of independent Chinese cinema. 4. Farewell to Li Hsing pays tribute to eminent Director Li Hsing, who passed away in August 2021. The festival formed a special bond with the late director since his last visit in 2015. Farewell to Li Hsing remembers this legend through the screening of Keep On Walking: The Man And His Higher Course, a documentary on the man himself, and three of his restored titles.\n\nFinally, Restored Classics showcases three classic films that were recently restored in 4K – these include Taiwanese animated film Grandma And Her Ghosts (1998), and Dust Of Angels, a film about Taiwanese gangs released in 1992.
