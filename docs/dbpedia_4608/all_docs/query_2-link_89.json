        "text": "Put on your best baggy clothes, and turn that baseball cap around because we're about to time-travel to the 1990s. Our editors have selected the 50 TV shows from the slammin' decade. We're talking The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Friends, Seinfeld, and more.\n\nPHOTOS: See the 50 best TV shows of the 1990s\n\nOur list includes scripted shows and reality shows, and features shout-outs to signature '90s stars such as Kelsey Grammer (Frasier), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and the whole weird and wonderful gang of Twin Peaks.\n\nWill we give you some binge-watch ideas? We hope so.\n\nWhat show is No. 1? We're not telling. You'll have to click ahead to get the list, and find out.\n\nTotally.\n\nLaunched on a local TV station in 1988, MST3K became a national treasure a year later when it debuted on The Comedy Channel (later to be known as Comedy Central). For all of the 1990s, the Peabody Award-winning show, set in a darkened theater aboard the Satellite of Love, taught us how to snark back at Teenage Cave Man, Attack of the Giant Leeches, and other non-movie classics. Netflix revived the series in 2017.\n\nWhat began in 1994 as an alleged-Seinfeld knock-off (known in Season 1 as These Friends of Mine) ended in 1998 as having established itself as an LGBTQ ground-breaker. The series' big moment came in 1997 via \"The Puppy Episode,\" in which star Ellen DeGeneres' character, Ellen Morgan, develops a crush on a woman, and comes out as a lesbian. The storyline followed DeGeneres' own headline-making \"Yep, I'm gay,\" interview.\n\nThis influential, 1990-2010 Emmy-winning procedural spawned the Law & Order franchise, paved the way for all the CSI and NCIS shows that would follow, and established that you could make a primetime drama where the concept was the biggest star of them all. Indeed, not one actor endured for the length of the series' Gunsmoke-tying 20-season run -- a feat which has since been surpassed by spin-off Law & Order: SVU, with Mariska Hargitay earning the distinction of TV's longest-running primetime drama character.\n\nWith America's Most Wanted, Rescue 911, and more, the '90s did not lack for reenactment true-crime shows. Maybe it was Robert Stack, maybe it was Robert Stack's trench coat, but Unsolved Mysteries was the classiest of them all. It was produced from 1987 until Stack took ill in 2002, and was revived in 2008 (mostly featuring the same old cases, but with new intros from new host Dennis Farina).\n\nIf this 1995-1998 HBO show did no more than produce some of the best sketch comedy of its decade, then that would be enough to land it a spot here. But it also provided an early platform for Jack Black, Sarah Silverman, 24's Mary Lynn Rajskub, SpongeBob SquarePants's Tom Kenny, and, of course, its stars, Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul) and David Cross (Arrested Development).\n\nAs Funny or Die has taught us, the ostensive hero of this 1989-1993 Saturday-morning sitcom is \"trash.\" But we even though we know that Bayside High schemer Zach Morris (played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar) was wrong, and that Saved By the Bell itself was frequently sexist and, per its star, occasionally \"racist,\" we just can't quit it. It's a part of us. Probably a side-effect of the giant cell phones. Good thing there's a revival on the way.\n\nPrimetime TV audiences of 1990 had never seen anything like the wrapped-in-plastic body of Laura Palmer (played by Sheryl Lee) on Twin Peaks. They'd also never before responded with such enthusiasm to something so idiosyncratic and occasionally gruesome. David Lynch's atmospheric drama fizzed a year later, but it made its mark (and lived on via a feature film and 2017 revival series).\n\nIn 2019, Friends turned 25 -- older than some of the Manhattanite characters were supposed to be at the start of the series' 1994-2004 run. Despite its advancing age, TV's most-watched show of 2001-2002 (and 2002's Emmy winner for Outstanding Comedy Series) is still snappy. As the theme song says, Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Joey, and Phoebe will always be there for us."
