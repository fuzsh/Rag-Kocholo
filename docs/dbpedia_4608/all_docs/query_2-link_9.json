He strips her down in front of police officers to reveal a bulge in her underwear, and the crowd throws up and gags in response.\n\nAs The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo wrote in 2016, \"as in many fictional depictions of transgender people in that era, the scene's prevailing emotion is of nose-holding disgust.\"\n\nIn 2019, Carrey agreed with a comment calling the film transphobic. Speaking with the Television Critics Association that same year, he said a lot of the show's \"ridiculous\" jokes wouldn't fly today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Cruel Intentions\" (1999) is far from perfect when it comes to manipulation and victim shaming.\n\nIn \"Cruel Intentions,\" Annette (Reese Witherspoon) makes a public pledge to \"stay pure\" until she marries her boyfriend. The pledge sparks Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) to try to get Annette to break her promise.\n\nAlong the way, Sebastian also tries to seduce Cecile (Selma Blair) to get revenge for Kathryn.\n\nCritics have called out the film for its portrayal of sexual manipulation and victim shaming, particularly in scenes in which Sebastian forces himself upon Cecile and Kathyrn dismisses Cecile's uncomfortableness with the situation.\n\nAs Michelle Bright wrote for Ms. magazine in 2019, Kathryn harmfully \"uses the same technique of victim-blaming questioning people often used when someone reveals they've been sexually assaulted to convince Cecile that she wasn't assaulted — and that whatever happened to her was actually her own fault.\"\n\nThe film has also been called out over the racism exhibited by Kathryn trying to break up Cecile and Ronald because he's Black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Sandler's \"The Waterboy\" (1998) has been criticized for its storyline and jokes.\n\nAdam Sandler's \"The Waterboy\" was a '90s hit — but in the decades since, many have called it out for using dated language, including the R-word.\n\nMany have also criticized the movie's plot for turning bullied people with disabilities into a comedic storyline. As Tom Keiser wrote for Vice in 2015, this seems to be a common theme in Sandler's movies.\n\n\"A huge issue with Adam Sandler's movies ... is that these movies imply that we can make fun of minorities, people with disabilities, the gays, etc. all we want, so long as it comes with the increasingly offhand message that They're People Too, and that Sandler is one of these outcasts, or at least empathizes with them,\" he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"American Pie\" (1999) has one scene Jason Biggs says \"wouldn't get made now.\"\n\n\"American Pie\" is one of the most celebrated films of the 1990s, and it's responsible for launching the careers of actors like Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid, and Shannon Elizabeth.\n\nBut one scene in particular hasn't aged well.\n\nOne of the movie's stars, Biggs, told BuzzFeed News earlier this year that the scene in which his character sets up a webcam to secretly record a student who is undressing wouldn't fly in 2020.\n\n\"It wouldn't get made now and it couldn't get made now,\" Biggs said of the scene. \"It would be unacceptable what that represents, but at the time I remember reading the script and reading that part and being shocked that there was cameras on computers! That's what I took away from it originally!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe premise of \"Chasing Amy\" (1997) is filled with issues.\n\nStarring Ben Affleck, \"Chasing Amy\" follows a man who falls in love with a woman he later learns is gay.\n\nThough the film initially received many positive reviews from critics, it's since been widely criticized as featuring a harmful portrayal of sexuality.\n\nAs Gabe Delahaye wrote for Stereogum in 2010, the film also harmfully depicted gayness \"as a flimsy tool of self-identification that can be easily and quickly shrugged off if the right melodramatic speech comes along in the middle of a thunderstorm.\"\n\nSome have also criticized the film as using a lesbian character who exists only to serve a straight one.\n\nAs Shannon Keating wrote for BuzzFeed News in 2017, \"Ultimately, the film assumes that a lesbian can go straight, even if just for a little while, as soon as the right guy comes along.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe children's movie \"Blank Check\" (1994) featured a scene that faced criticism years later.\n\nWhen Disney's \"Blank Check\" was released in 1994, kids everywhere wished they had the same luck as the 12-year-old Preston Waters. Who wouldn't want to receive a blank check and cash it for $1 million?\n\nThough there were plenty of things that didn't make sense in the film, one of the most commonly criticized points is that Preston's love interest was a 30-something FBI agent named Shay Stanley.\n\n\"Blank Check\" also featured a controversial scene in which Shay and Preston exchange a kiss.\n\nWhen the film was added to Disney Plus years later, many viewers took to social media to criticize the \"troublesome\" full-on kiss between an adult and a child that they didn't feel was necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Dances With Wolves\" (1990) has been criticized for its premise.\n\n\"Dances With Wolves\" follows Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a white man, as he joins a band of Lakota Indians and falls in love with a white woman named Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell), who was raised by the tribe. Eventually, Dunbar helps save the group from Union soldiers.\n\nThough it was highly celebrated upon its release, the Costner-directed film has since been called out as featuring a \"white savior\" complex, meaning it depicts a leading white character saving people of color from situations they can't save themselves from.\n\nPercy White Plume, an actor who also appeared in the film, told Indian Country Today in 2015 that many Native people — more specifically those who are Lakota — also took issue with the way the white actors dominated the film.\n\n\"It was a white man coming into the Lakota country and learning the language and leading the way,\" he said of Costner's character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Dangerous Minds\" (1995) has also been called out as featuring a white-savior complex.\n\n\"Dangerous Minds\" stars Michelle Pfeiffer as LouAnne, a Marine turned teacher of inner-city California high-school students.\n\nThe film takes inspiration from a book of anecdotes by the real-life educator LouAnne Johnson, and it has been called out as being guided by a white-savior complex.\n\nMany critics have taken issue with the fact that the group of students LouAnne helps in the film is primarily made up of people of color.\n\nJohnson told The Guardian in 2015 that the lack of white students in the schools was actually inaccurate.\n\n\"In my class, the kids were evenly mixed: black, white, and Hispanic. In the movie they made it all minority kids with a token white kid here and there,\" she said. \"That perpetuates this myth that only minority kids are at risk, and that white kids don't have any problems.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe classic rom-com \"Never Been Kissed\" (1999) has raised eyebrows for its premise.\n\nThe rom-com stars Drew Barrymore as Josie, a copyeditor who pretends to be a student so she can go back to high school and research the culture of the students.\n\nWhile posing as a student, she and her English teacher, Mr. Coulson, fall for each other.\n\nAs Anne Cohen wrote for Refinery29 in 2019, \"It's a film about adults posing as high schoolers, framing inappropriate and predatory relationships either in the rosy glow of fantasy romance, or playing them for laughs.\"\n\nIn particular, many take issue with the student-teacher relationship between Josie and Mr. Coulson. Even though Josie is not a teenager, Mr. Coulson doesn't know that when he interacts with her for most of the movie.\n\nCoulson also makes a range of inappropriate confessions and remarks to the faux-teenage Josie, including, \"When you're my age, guys will be lined up around the block for you.\"\n\nRead next\n\nMovie Movies Controversy\n\nAdvertisement"
