        "text": "I love it when Disney movies travel around the world. Mulan and Aladdin are to date my favorite classic Disney films. Last year, Disney showcased ancient Polynesian culture in Moana, and this year, Pixar will explore Mexican culture with Coco. It inspired me to take a look at the history of cultural representation in Disney movies. I will go over the movies that either take place outside the United-States or focus on minorities of the United-States (but I will skip Songs of the South!).\n\nRepresentation or appropriation?\n\nWhen it comes to cultural portrayal, Disney has to walk the line between representation and appropriation. On the positive side, Disney can shine their spotlight on various countries and cultures, depict diverse people and ideas, and promote openness and understanding. Saludos Amigos, for example, was conceived to tighten the relations between the United-States and South America during World War 2.\n\nOn the negative side, Disney can be accused of cultural appropriation as they make a profit off selling other people‚Äôs stories and culture. And if they are telling other people‚Äôs stories, there‚Äôs a risk that they won‚Äôt portray it accurately or that it will feel inauthentic to the people concerned. And of course there‚Äôs the pitfall of veering into hurtful stereotypes. A solution to mitigate those risks is to hire consultants from the concerned groups, or better yet, hire creators from the concerned groups and let them tell the stories they want to tell. A step further is to partner with local studios and to mentor the development of local projects, something Disney has been known to do at least tentatively in China.\n\nIt all started with Europe\n\nDisney made its name adapting famous European stories. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is based on a German fairy tale and Pinocchio is based on an Italian novel. The trend continued well into the latter half of the 20th century with all-European classics like Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, One Hundred and One Dalmatians, The Sword in the Stone, Robin Hood, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Hercules.\n\nSome of these movies have a vague setting while others are more specific. Some of the English characters are voiced by English actors, like Alice and Robin Hood. The tone of these film also varies, from the comedic anachronisms of Hercules to the darker approach of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. One notable change made by Disney was to make Esmeralda a Romani girl, whereas in the novel she was kidnapped as a baby by the Romani and switched for Quasimodo.\n\nFirst adventures outside Europe\n\nSaludos Amigos (1942) & The Three Caballeros (1944)\n\nThese movies are made of segments presenting famous sights and cultural aspects of Latin America through a mix of animation and live-action footage. It features Lake Titicaca, Mount Aconcagua, gauchos, charros, pi√±atas and various dances and songs. It is partially a documentary and the rest is humorous. It has an American narrator and Latin American actors. The cartoon characters include a Brazilian parrot, a penguin from Patagonia and a Mexican rooster.\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967)\n\nThe Jungle Book was Disney‚Äôs first feature-length adventure outside of Europe and the United-States. It is adapted from a story set in India and written by a British-Indian author. The cast doesn‚Äôt feature any Indian or Indian-American voice actors though, and the cultural context remains generic for most of the film. At the end of the movie though, an Indian girl appears wearing a bindi and she sings a strange song that seems to imply that things never really change in the jungle.\n\nI must go to fetch the water / Till the day that I am grown / Then I will have a handsome husband / And a daughter of my own / And I‚Äôll send her to fetch the water / I‚Äôll be cooking in the home\n\nThe 90s around the world\n\nAladdin (1992)\n\nAladdin was Disney‚Äôs first attempt at a non-European folktale. It is based on the famous Arabic tale set in Arabic China. Much like European fairy tales have fairies, kings, sorcerers with long beards and flying broomsticks, Aladdin has a genie, a sultan, a mustache-twisting vizier and a flying carpet. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of folktale that Disney likes to adapt, but with Arabic motifs. The clothes, jewelry and architecture look inspired by ancient Middle-Eastern cultures, with a bit of India mixed in. The voice actors, however, were still white on this film.\n\nThe Lion King (1994)\n\nThe Lion King is a story inspired by Hamlet, but with animals from the Serengeti national park in northern Tanzania. It incorporates a few elements of African culture, like the Zulu chorus at the start of ‚ÄúThe Circle of Life‚Äù and the Swahili catchphrase ‚ÄúHakuna Matata‚Äù. Rafiki might be meant to be some sort of African shaman (?). As for the talent involved, one of the music producers was South African. The voice actors were American and African-American.\n\nPocahontas (1995)\n\nPocahontas rewrites history and kind of falls into the ‚Äúnoble savage‚Äù trope, wherein the good indigenous character has not yet been corrupted by the evil of ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù. The real Pocahontas was about 12 when she met John Smith. She was later held captive by the colonists and converted to Christianity. She then married an Englishman named John Rolfe and visited England, but she died at the young age of 21. Her trip to England and marriage to John Rolfe are bizarrely portrayed in the direct-to-video sequel. It‚Äôs worth a watch to see how Disney sort of sticks to history while doubling down on the ‚Äúnoble savage‚Äù trope. Irene Bedard, a Native American actress, voiced Pocahontas.\n\nMulan (1998)\n\nMulan takes a famous Chinese legend and turns it into the most awesome Disney movie ever. Is it accurate? No. Did Disney make money off another country‚Äôs culture? They tried. It wasn‚Äôt that well-received in China because they changed the legend too much. But Mulan is such an inspiring story, it‚Äôs fair to say it at least depicts the Chinese hero in a positive light. The Mongolians, though, not so much. Mulan was played by a Chinese-American actress. It‚Äôs just too bad they got Eddie Murphy to voice Mushu instead of say Jackie Chan. Jacky Chan was at the height of his comedic career in the late 90s, and he voiced a part in the Chinese dub of Mulan, so Disney literally had him at their disposition!\n\nTarzan (1999)\n\nTarzan takes place in Africa, but it features no black character. It‚Äôs an adaptation of a 1912 American novel set in 1888 Africa. In the novel, there is a tribe of black people, but they are Tarzan‚Äôs enemies. Disney chose to cut them out entirely, probably to avoid having to deal with the racist themes of the original story. The new story is simply set in an uninhabited jungle that white people happen to visit in a time period that looks colonial. As in The Jungle Book, the animals reflect the local fauna, but not the local culture. The voice actors are white.\n\nThe Emperor‚Äôs New Groove (2000)\n\nThe Emperor‚Äôs New Groove does for pre-Colombian Peru what Hercules did for Ancient Greece. It‚Äôs too anachronistic to be taken as a serious attempt at cultural representation. There‚Äôs a llama and some Andean-inspired visuals, but the characters have European food, amusement parks and every other modern American tradition. The voice cast isn‚Äôt Peruvian, nor Latino, nor indigenous.\n\nBack to the US\n\nLilo & Stitch (2002)\n\nLilo & Stitch is set in contemporary Hawaii, specifically on the island of Kaua ªi. Lilo takes hula lessons, Nani surfs and the dialogue contains Hawaiian slang. The concept of  ªohana (family in Hawaiian) is central to the movie. There are two songs performed and written by a Hawaiian musician. The rest of the songs are Elvis Presley songs. The actress playing Nani was born in Hawaii and the actor playing David grew up there. The actress playing Lilo is from Oregon.\n\nBrother Bear (2003)\n\nBrother Bear has Inuit protagonists. It likely takes place in Alaska as it features grizzlies, moose and auroras, but the animators said they visited national parks in Alaska and in the contiguous United-States for inspiration. There‚Äôs a song performed by a Bulgarian choir using Yup‚Äôik lyrics written by an Alaskan professor. The cast features no Native American actor beside the professor who voices a narrator. The pair of moose is voiced by a pair of Canadian actors.\n\nThe Princess and the Frog (2009)\n\nThe Princess and the Frog is inspired by a European fairy tale called The Frog Prince. Disney transposed the story to Jazz Age New Orleans and added voodoo magic and bayous. It‚Äôs a cool concept, and they cast African-American actors to voice the African-American characters, but I thought it was a bit weird to make Tiana the pseudo-servant of a rich white girl. She‚Äôs not actually her servant, but it comes off that way because Tiana‚Äôs mom sews her clothes and Tiana does the catering for her party. I don‚Äôt see why Tiana needed an obscenely rich white friend.\n\nNow in 3D\n\nTangled (2010)\n\nTangled marked a return to classic European fairy tales. Rapunzel is a German fairy tale based on a French story loosely based on an Italian story. Disney added the idea of the sky lanterns released on the princess‚Äô birthday, which led to some of the most beautiful visuals in the film. Sky lanterns are typically associated with China and Thailand, but they also exist in Portugal (still probably imported from China). The drunken inn is a possible Bavarian stereotype.\n\nFrozen (2013)\n\nFrozen features Norwegian traditions ranging from rosemaling on walls and dresses to trolls, Fjord horses and saunas. The movie got a tiny bit of criticism for its portrayal of Kristoff as a blond Sami. While there are Sami people who are blond, the Sami people characteristically have darker hair and skin. The Sami officials were pleased with Kristoff though. The voice cast is entirely American and white, but Disney hired a Sami musician to write the opening song. Sami people traditionally raise reindeer to pull sleds but they don‚Äôt typically ride them.\n\nBig Hero 6 (2014)\n\nBig Hero 6 is based on an American comic book set in Tokyo, but the movie is set in a fictional city called San Fransokyo. San Fransokyo is basically San Fransisco rebuilt by Japanese immigrants. The Japanese influences are reflected in the architecture mostly, but also in the design of the robot and tech. The main protagonist is half Japanese and is played by an actor who is also half Japanese. This blending of two cultures is a timely concept and a nice love letter to immigrants.\n\nMoana (2016)\n\nMoana takes inspiration from Samoa, Fiji, Tonga and Tahiti. It is set approximately 2000 years ago. It features sailboats, coconuts, palm trees, pigs, chickens and tattoos. The story is an original folktale, but Maui is a famous character in Polynesian mythology. I also read that the story was inspired by a supposed gap in the navigation history of the Polynesian peoples. The cast is mostly from Hawaii and New-Zealand. Dwayne Johnson is half-Samoan through his mother.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next for Disney?\n\nDisney doesn‚Äôt have anything new on its horizon as of now. Since they cancelled Gigantic, everything they have planned is a sequel. I hope in the future they do more fairy tales set in real places. I would love to see Disney make a movie set in India with human characters. I don‚Äôt think India will do a Disney-quality animated movie any time soon, so a musical collaboration seems like it could be a great idea. India has a ton of filmmakers already and a huge demographic.\n\nAnother thing I‚Äôd like to see is a movie set in Africa, also with human characters. I loved the live-action Disney film Queen of Katwe, which was set in Uganda. It was beautiful and moving. Now imagine if they did an animated movie like Moana, but with a black African Disney princess. Slowly but surely, there could be all kinds of Disney princesses: a Kazakh princess, a Korean princess, a Thai princess, an Amazonian princess, etc. Diversity makes the stories feel less repetitive."
