        "text": "Before joining CNET, all I cared about was my Wi-Fi. When I joined the broadband team, I realized I'd thrown the term Wi-Fi around but didn't really understand it. What is it, and is it better than those ugly cables known as Ethernet?\n\nThe answer is subjective, depending on your specific internet needs and setup. It's important information to know when choosing your home internet setup or the best broadband provider for your household.\n\nSo, after covering broadband for CNET for over nine months, I decided to test them both at home to see the real differences and to determine which is better, faster, cheaper and safer.\n\nThe answers may surprise you.\n\nRead more: Home Wi-Fi issues? Here are some simple steps to boost Your Wi-Fi\n\nMy home internet experiment\n\nWi-Fi is a mode of connecting your devices to the local network. Whether cooking in the kitchen or sitting on the couch, you can hop online without worrying about plugging into your modem or router. Ethernet is the opposite. It's a wired connection that requires either coaxial or fiber-optic cables plugged directly into your router, which may be viewed as inconvenient, but which can provide a more reliable, faster connection in some cases.\n\nUsing Speedtest by Ookla, CNET's pick for the best speed test, I compared my internet speed over Wi-Fi and Ethernet to see which was faster. You might be surprised at the difference; I certainly was.\n\nOver Wi-Fi, I was receiving download speeds of around 126 megabits per second. With Ethernet, my download speed jumped to 395Mbps, which is only 5Mbps away from what I'm actually paying for monthly.\n\nI never noticed much lag when streaming with Wi-Fi, but using an Ethernet cable made a noticeable difference. Movies, shows and live television loaded much faster on Hulu, HBO Max and Netflix. To maximize response time, I decided to plug my Ethernet cable into my PlayStation 5 indefinitely.\n\nThen I wondered, why was Ethernet faster than my Wi-Fi connection?\n\nWhat is Wi-Fi?\n\nWi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity, meaning it's a completely wireless network connection. After setting up a router, you can wirelessly connect your computer, mobile device and television to the internet.\n\nAlthough the connection may be stronger the closer you are to the router, you should be able to access the internet wherever you are in your house. My CNET colleague, Trisha, discovered this by experimenting to boost her gigabit speeds at home.\n\nYou can also purchase a Wi-Fi extender to broadcast signals to every room, resulting in fewer dead zones and a more reliable internet connection throughout the house. The TP-Link RE605X is CNET's top pick for the best Wi-Fi router due to its affordability, ability to support Wi-Fi 6 speeds and easy-to-use features.\n\nWhat is Ethernet?\n\nBefore Wi-Fi existed, Ethernet was the primary way to link devices together. Ethernet offers a wired connection through cables that plug directly into your router.\n\nA wired connection means you have to be near your equipment if you want to go online. You can wire your house with Ethernet cables, which is similar to cable wiring, but that can be a costly procedure.\n\nWhat is the future of Ethernet?\n\nOver the past decade, Ethernet has undergone many changes, and even more so with the increase of artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to the Ethernet Alliance, due to the rise and demand of AI, Ethernet connection speeds are evolving and are projected to increase to 800 gigabits and beyond.\n\nComparing Wi-Fi and Ethernet\n\nWi-Fi and Ethernet have advantages and disadvantages depending on your personal needs. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWi-Fi\n\nPros\n\nConvenience\n\nMobility\n\nAffordability\n\nCons\n\nCongestion\n\nLimited range\n\nSecurity risks\n\nEthernet\n\nPros\n\nReliability\n\nFaster speeds\n\nSecure connections\n\nCons\n\nLimited mobility\n\nLimited number of connected devices\n\nCost\n\nWhich is cheaper?\n\nIt might seem like the cost of Wi-Fi and Ethernet would be similar -- since you're paying for the service, not the mode of internet connection -- but Wi-Fi is actually significantly cheaper than Ethernet. This mostly comes down to installation costs and the complexity of setting your home or office up for a wired Ethernet connection. Wi-Fi can handle a lot more devices than regular Ethernet cables can. To make it worthwhile, you would have to install a switch box or Ethernet jacks around your house to connect multiple devices to the internet.\n\nWhich is faster?\n\nOne of Ethernet's biggest advantages is speed. Since your device is connected directly to the router -- compared to wirelessly through Wi-Fi -- you can expect faster bandwidth, which is how much data you can transmit through an internet connection.\n\nEthernet also boasts more consistent speeds since wired signals don't fluctuate as easily as wireless ones do. You also won't have to worry about latency issues or a lag in connection that sometimes occurs with local network congestion. In addition, lower latency can improve online gaming. Ethernet might provide a smoother experience for online gamers.\n\nWhich is safer?\n\nOne of Ethernet's advantages over Wi-Fi: the connection is safer and more secure. Hackers can more easily intercept data transmitted through Wi-Fi, but if they want to hack you over Ethernet, they need to physically connect to the router.\n\nWhich is better overall?\n\nUsing an Ethernet connection all the time is just not practical. Using Wi-Fi, you can access the internet from anywhere in your house without plugging into a router. Ethernet limits your mobility, which is unrealistic if you have several people connecting multiple devices.\n\nTesting my internet speeds with an Ethernet cable did help me pinpoint the root cause of my slow connection. Based on the drastic difference between the Wi-Fi and Ethernet speed tests, I determined that my Wi-Fi connection was to blame for the slow service, not my ISP throttling my speed. By plugging Ethernet cables into my PlayStation 5, I can use faster speeds and lower latency for an optimized gaming experience.\n\nI haven't taken any steps yet to boost my Wi-Fi signals, but I might move my router to a more central area of my apartment or get an extender to help my speeds stay consistent. My colleague Ry Crist dives into more ways to speed up your Wi-Fi, and you can bet I'll be leaning into his advice.\n\nWhat's the bottom line?\n\nBoth Wi-Fi and Ethernet have their benefits when it comes to home broadband. Wi-Fi offers mobility and convenience, meaning you can access the internet anywhere in your home, while Ethernet provides faster and more secure connectivity.\n\nMost of us will be better off with Wi-Fi because our homes and apartments are filled with smart devices. Ethernet is a great tool to increase responsiveness, especially for gamers who want less lag with online gaming.\n\nWi-Fi vs. Ethernet FAQs"
