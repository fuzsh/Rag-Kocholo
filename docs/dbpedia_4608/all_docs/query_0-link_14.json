        "text": "Throughout the 1960s and early '70s, an increase in population led many third world countries to increase their cinematic output significantly; Egyptian productions targeted historical dramas towards African and Middle Eastern markets, while Mexico continued to dominate South America. Output from South Korea and Pakistan was also on the rise, but it was the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong that arguably benefitted the most from this significant shift.\n\nHong Kong cinema: Before the new wave\n\nUnderstanding Hong Kong cinema prior to the new wave may shed light on why these directors stood out from their peers. A mass-production studio system had been implemented in 1950s Hong Kong, which would eventually produce over 120 features per year by the late 1970s. Making this feat possible was Run Run Shaw (of the hugely successful Shaw Brothers) who had built an ambitious Hong Kong studio called Movietown in 1958. While having great success with relatively low budget productions, Shaw would look to reinvent the martial arts genre by 1960. Instead of focusing on Confucian philosophy, the reinvigorated genre would become a celebration of cutting-edge stunts, taking influence from popular Japanese samurai flicks and spaghetti Westerns.\n\nDirectors King Hu and Zhang Che helped bring the genre into fruition, while also recruiting a line of assistant directors who would become significant to Hong Kong's film scene in the 1970s.\n\nHowever, after the death of cult star Bruce Lee in 1973, there was a noticeable decrease in quality throughout the martial arts genre. But before his death, Lee had already helped martial arts cinema connect to a global audience. This allowed Raymond Chow, who had helped turn Lee into a global star and previously worked as Shaw's head of production, turn his enterprise Golden Harvest into a major production company. By the mid-70s, the martial arts genre had firmly found its global audience. It's wide appeal spread well beyond Asia, having also become popular in Africa, Latin America, Europe and North America. But in Hong Kong, creative young filmmakers were ready to subvert industry trends and make their own mark on the colony's cinematic output.\n\nThe First Wave\n\nBy the late ‘70s, martial arts cinema from Raymond Chow (of Golden Harvest) and Run Run Shaw (of the Shaw Brothers) had dominated the industry’s mainstream output for years. Despite the genre’s global audience, Hong Kong cinema was now ready for new developments. The very first Hong Kong Film Festival was held in 1977, and Hong Kong now had more high-brow film-focused magazines and filmmaking courses than ever before. The industry was ready for fresh blood and new innovations, and the likes of Ann Hui, Patrick Tam, Tsui Hark and Alex Cheung were ready to inject their own creative flare into Hong Kong's film industry.\n\nMany soon-to-be new wave directors had studied abroad, adopting styles that were not reminiscent of Hong Kong cinema at the time. They studied in ‘Shoalin Temples’ – the term affectionately used to describe a 2-3 year training program at a TV studio – and some had even become known for TV work before transitioning to directing feature-length films. While these directors were still working in television, a 1976 article in the very first issue of Tang Shuxuan’s Da Texie declared that “a new wave is rising that will force veteran directors to advance.”\n\nSo, what did these directors have to offer Hong Kong's creative output on the big screen? In his book Hong Kong New Wave Cinema 1978 - 2001, Pak Ton Cheuk best described their diverse incentives when he said “they were not revolutionists, but they were unquestionably reformists and innovators.” For directors such as Allen Fong and Ann Hui, this meant bringing social commentary and psychological nuance to genre flicks, providing what may have been lost during Run Run Shaw's shift towards stunt-focused cinema. Others, such as Tsui Hark and John Woo, were more focused on showcasing their unique styles to mainstream audiences.\n\nThe Extras (1978) Ka le fei by director Yim Ho\n\nAn aspiring actor who has become frustrated by his unsuccessful career, until he finally gets his big break. That is, until he realises that his new job is just more low-paid extra work. Now facing the grim reality of his new job, Yim Ho's humorous flick explores the unusual life of an extra in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Boy From Vietnam (1978) by director Ann Hui\n\nFollowing the lives of Vietnamese immigrants residing in Hong Kong, director Ann Hui explores the hopes, dreams and limited possibilities they have of finding a better life outside of Vietnam. Importantly, the film marks the beginning of Ann Hui’s politicised Vietnamese trilogy.\n\nCops and Robbers (1979) Dian zhi bing bing by director Alex Cheung\n\nWhen a journalist tries to solve a mystery, he needs help from a celebrated fighter and a woman called Green Breeze. Together, they travel to a mysterious castle, where a kaleidoscope of poisonous butterflies stands between them and a leather-clad killer. The Butterfly Murders is a Wuxia film, which translates literally as 'martial heroes'. These films focus on heroic martial artists living in Ancient China.\n\nThe Secret (1979) Fung gip by director Ann Hui\n\nA real murder becomes increasingly complex when a relationship unfolds between a suspect and a victim. A series of narrations then show conflicting stories. As well as introducing more nuanced ideas to the industry, The Secret would also be remembered for its significance to female filmmakers. Ann Hui would ensure that considerably more women would on the film's production than was commonplace at the time. The film was also written by Joyce Chan Wan Man.\n\nFrom Riches to Rags (1980) Qian zuo guai by director John Woo\n\nWhen a factory worker wins the lottery, he and his friend begin to spend carelessly until a fortune teller predicts his death. He immediately goes to the doctor, where a complication leads him to believe he doesn't have much time left. In an attempt to avoid a painful death, the man gives his fortunes to a suicidal passerby on the condition that he hires a hitman to take him out.\n\nEncore (1980) by director Clifford Choi\n\nAlso known as Hot Choi, this romance film marks Clifford Choi’s directorial debut, and is one of Leslie Cheung’s first prominent roles in a feature film.\n\nSee-Bar (1980) 師爸 by director Dennis Yu\n\nWhen a man is tricked out of a fortune, his cousin, a young mechanic working in a small garage, seeks revenge. Little do they know that they are actually taking on a fearless gang boss, Kwok. Another trick leads the mechanic to bet his garage, forcing him to try and contact GhostEye, a man who may be able to outwit the crooks.\n\nThe Sword (1980) Ming jian by director Patrick Tam\n\nA beautiful yet sadistic girl leads a group of nerdy teens on a psychopathic rampage. The original version of Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind is now lost, having been banned by authorities due to its dark depiction of Hong Kong’s society at the time. The film could be considered a turning point for Tsui Hark, who had to re-edit the film to exclude certain political messages. His future releases would then become far more commercial. In fact, Hark’s energetic films would eventually lead to comparisons between himself and leading popular directors in the west. In later years, he was even described as ‘the Steven Spielberg of Hong Kong’.\n\nThe Spooky Bunch (1980) Zhuang dao zheng by director Ann Hui\n\nA wealthy man hires a Cantonese opera company to perform on the Island where he resides. He plans to match his nephew with a young actress working for the opera troupe, thereby ending a curse put upon her grandfather.\n\nThe Spooky Bunch did more than its fair part in bringing back the ghost genre to Hong Kong cinema. Directors Sammo Hung and Kuei Chih Hung also made notable Hong Kong exploitation horrors during this period.\n\nThe rise of Cinema City (and its affects on the New Wave)\n\nIn 1979, the Fendou Film Company was founded by Shek Tin, Wong Pak-ming and Karl Maka and renamed Cinema City the following year. The studio would initially create lower budget films focused on so-called hoodlums and the struggles of the lower class. It would also recruit New Wave directors such as John Woo and Tsui Hark. The studio’s films were profitable and popular with audiences for a short while, despite their low budgets and the absence of known actors. But audiences’ interest in these stories were short-lived, causing the studio to produce action comedies with strict formulas instead. These relatively wholesome comedies – which avoided vulgarity and perversion – would set records for their success at the box office throughout the 1980s. However, the studio’s success and business-minded approach to cinema led to a dominance that made less formulaic films harder to produce, promote and release.\n\nThe Story of Woo Viet (1981) Woo Yuet dik goo si by director Ann Hui\n\nA retired gangster manages a bar on the coast. The film centers on his daughter and partner-in-crime, as their criminal past catches up with them.\n\nFramed (1989) 沉底鱷 by director Alex Cheung\n\nAfter a long sentence, an ex-policeman is released from prison. Insisting on his innocence, he seeks out those who framed him.\n\nA Better Tomorrow III: Love & Death in Saigon (1989) 英雄本色3-夕陽之歌 by director Tsui Hark\n\nChow Yun-fat reprises the role of fan favourite, Mark Gor, for a prequel to John Woo’s blockbuster franchise. The film explores the rise of Mark Gor and his criminal enterprise.\n\nTsui Hark finally goes from producer to director within the Better Tomorrow franchise for its third instalment. John Woo had previously written his idea for the a third film, but was not invited back to direct due to a disagreement with Tsui Hark during the production of A Better Tomorrow II. Notably, Woo’s script ultimately became his 1990 effort, Bullet in the Head. Both films take place in the Vietnam War.\n\nA Second Wave Begins\n\nThe dominance of Cinema City and the poor performance of less formulaic productions spelt the end of Hong Kong’s first wave. Many new wave directors were now producing more commercial fare; for example, Tsui Hark was now targeting family entertainment with titles such as Peking Opera Blues and Warriors of the Magic Mountain. Ann Hui would have a short hiatus until 1997, while John Woo went on to make his mark on Hollywood.\n\nThe prominent figures of the new wave may have integrated with Hong Kong’s commercial cinema, but the new have is a two-sided coin. A ‘second wave’ would yet again challenge the industry norms and produce some of Hong Kong’s most renowned titles to date.\n\nReferences:\n\nCharles, John (2000).
