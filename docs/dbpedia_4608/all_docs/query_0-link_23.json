        "text": "This book looks closely at some of the most significant films within the field of queer Sinophone cinema. Examining queerness in films produced in the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the book merges the Sinophone with the queer, theorising both concepts as local and global, homebound as well as diasporic. Queerness in this book not only problematises the positioning of non-normative desires within the Sinophone; it also challenges Eurocentric critical perspectives on filmic representation that are tied to the idea of the binary between East/West. New Queer Sinophone Cinema will appeal to scholars in Chinese and film studies, as well as to anyone who is interested in queer Chinese cinema\n\nThis book focuses on the youth film is an invention of the 1950s in Chinese communities. Also, this book discusses in the second half of the decade starting in the year 2000 appeared certain youth styles/images and promoted certain perspectives on young people’s psychological well-being. By giving Chinese youth more ‘power’ of selfidentification, youth films in recent decades have begun to place more responsibility on young characters to deal with their journey through adolescence. This journey offers any number of directions and route, but their destination is always to approach maturity. Timothy Shary initiated his earlier academic study on ‘teen film’. His work on gender continued in studies of youth cinema. His works inspired the author of this book to look at the development of youth genre in Chinese context, as well as to give a more precise definition of Chinese youth genre and sub-genres.\n\nChina has one of the longest and richest traditions of queer gender and sexuality in the world, stretching from as far back as the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BCE) all the way up to the present day. However, many people both inside and outside of China are unaware of this legacy and of the important role played by queer sexualities in the cultural and historical formation of modern China. In this Integrative Learning course, students will explore the emergence and expression of queer (tongzhi 同志) identities, cultures, and communities in modern and contemporary mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora through the critical reading and analysis of texts from the disciplines of cultural anthropology, history, and literature/film studies. A historical investigation of understandings and practices of gender and sexuality in traditional China will lay a foundation for our discussion of how and whether popular and scholarly attitudes toward homosexuality shifted during the Republican Period (1912–1949). Memoirs, novels, and films will allow us to catch glimpses of “hooligan” and other queer sexualities during Maoist China (1949–1976). We will also examine the gradual emergence of queer culture in mainland China during the reform period (1977–present) and the explosion of gay literature (tongzhi wenxue 同志 文学), queer literature (ku’er wenxue 酷儿文学), and queer film in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora in the 1990s and 2000s. More recent ethnographic texts will also give us greater insight into contemporary queer Chinese cultures and communities. Through written assignments and oral presentations, students will hold anthropological, historical, and literature/film studies texts and methodologies in productive tension with one another, reflecting on similarities and differences between these separate ways of knowing and on how integrating disparate disciplinary approaches can enable new forms of understanding and insight.\n\nCrystal Boys, as the first Chinese novel that depicts the life struggles in the homosexual community, grew out of the particular socio-historical environment of Taiwan in the 1970s, an environment of institutionalized patriarchy and homophobia. It is a story of survival and of the claiming of new forms of identity and relationality: its characters not only subvert oppressive discourses through appropriation and imagination, but also reaffirm their filial piety through remembrance and reconstruction, thus defying the essentializing force imposed by mainstream society. For these reasons, the novel has attracted abundant commentary, which is here discussed in light of the transformations of Taiwanese society.\n\nThis thesis explores the development of Mainland China’s online “Comrade Literature” (同志文学tongzhi wenxue), a body of fiction linked to the experiences of Chinese homosexuals that emerged in the late 1990s. The central question is: How has Chinese Comrade Literature responded to changes in political rhetoric and government policy affecting queer identity in modern China? This thesis looks at samples of online Comrade stories as they correspond to political developments in China from 1996 to 2006, with an eye to how these narratives problematize the struggles of a marginalized queer Chinese population. An investigation of implicit and explicit references to laws, policies, and government action in Comrade stories reveals how they establish solidarity by communicating messages about China’s repressive political and social environment for homosexuals. The analysis focuses on the fictional texts themselves – on what they tell us about China’s political reality and State control affecting the gay community and what imagery they provide that can be interpreted as social mobilization and political protest. This thesis argues that this emergent queer literary discourse constitutes much more than meets the eye. It is not simply an expression of an underground gay culture; it is a dynamic form of resistance to the particular social and government discrimination towards Chinese homosexuality and protest against the broader environment of political repression in China. https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/6208\n\nThis thesis considers Comrade Literature (同志文学tongzhi wenxue), a genre of contemporary Chinese homosexual (tongzhi) fiction, as it has emerged on the internet in Mainland China. Although Comrade Literature first emerged in Hong Kong and Taiwan in the 1980s, it was only after the mid-1990s with the advent of the internet that these gay-themed fiction were disseminated online in Mainland China. There are now hundreds and thousands of stories designated as “Comrade Novels” (同志小说 tongzhi xiaoshuo) archived on various Chinese websites. This thesis contends that online Comrade stories are not simply an expression of an underground Chinese gay culture; they are complex cultural texts with deeper meanings as a site of queer resistance facilitating the intersection of homosexual and heterosexual subjectivities. In addition to providing a catalyst for the local tongzhi subculture, Comrade fiction in Mainland China capitalizes on new media platforms to present same-sex desire to the broader public. A close analysis of four online Comrade stories focuses on the representation of male same-sex relations, turning a critical eye to the logics of these texts as tongzhi write out of a heteronormative milieu. The three chapters in this thesis will each examine distinct aspects of China’s Comrade Literature: 1) gender performance in same-sex romance narratives, 2) homosexual abjection in Comrade bildungsroman, and 3) the continuum of homosocial and homosexual intimacy in military Comrade fiction. Collectively, these four works span a stylistic and temporal timeline that reflect developments in the tongzhi subculture on the Mainland. These fiction renegotiate the boundary between heterosexual and homosexual behaviors, establishing a unique tongzhi identity that is at once assimilated into yet differentiated from mainstream Chinese heteronormative society to challenge hegemonic norms. https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/7762\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, homosexuality has been and remains a highly sensitive and controversial topic in China where homosexual people were actively persecuted under Communist rule. It was not until the advent of the Internet in the mid-1990s that Comrade Literature (同志文学 tongzhi wenxue), an indigenous genre characterized by fictions of homosexuality, came into existence in China. Comrade Literature swiftly became popular as a medium for modern Chinese homosexual people (tongzhi) to express powerful emotions and protest the dominant heterosexual standard. This paper will discuss Beijing Story (1996) and The Illusive Mind (2003), two texts that have appealed to a large number of readers under the genre of “Comrade Novels.” Both fictions share a common characteristic in that they portray ambiguous relationships between and identities of characters to destabilize the dichotomous homo/hetero paradigm of sexuality in Chinese society. These Comrade novels comment on issues of sexuality and repressive social practices in two distinct but interrelated ways: as a plea for others to understand that homoerotic desire is essentially the same as heteroerotic desire, but also as an affirmation of the legitimacy of homosexual relations as radically different and even more ideal than dominant heterosexual practices in Chinese society. By examining the sexual and emotional attachment of the male protagonist to his male and female subjects of desire in these Comrade texts, I will explore how these differing viewpoints simultaneously coexist yet contest each other. I posit that it is possible to borrow from Western queer theory to understand the emergence and logic of Comrade Literature in China, demonstrating that queer texts converge across national and cultural borders in the way they challenge the dominant heteronormative categorical order of sexual hierarchy. Nonetheless, Comrade novels still exhibit divergence from texts produced in the Euro-American milieu to address dilemmas specific to tongzhi in China’s sociopolitical environment. https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/5751\n\nIn the past few decads, Taiwanese society has been strugling to integrate a strong Chinese cultural heritage with a unique sense of self-identity and a national history distinct from the mainland. The political conJlict in Taiwan has intensified in recent years, inJluenced by new social developments, intercultural interactions and global influences. It transforms Taiwan and engenders a highly polymorphous society with dffirent communities vying for their representative cultural voices (Liao 92). The emergent homosexual atlture in Taiwan is one such arginalized voice trytng to assert itself. Through literary discourse, the community commands focus on the complexity of the relationships between queer identity and the larger Taiwanese society (Chang 196)."
