        "text": "On the wedding day, a coach drawn by four white horses brought my fiancee and her parents to the Anichkov Palace. My own entrance was much less impressive. The fusty old lift stopped halfway up to the chapel, and the whole Imperial family, including the Tsar, had to help to liberate the wretched bridegroom. Then, accompanied by my parents, I walked through several rooms already filled with people to the chapel where I awaited the arrival of Irina.\n\nThe bride entered on the Tsar’s arm; he led her to her place next to mine and the service began.\n\nIt is customary at Russian marriages for one of the priests to spread a carpet of pink silk before the bridal couple across which, in the course of the ceremony, they have to walk. Tradition has it that whoever first sets foot on this carpet will rule the household; Irina had made up her mind to do this, but she caught her foot in her train and I took advantage of this to forestall her.\n\nWhen the service was over we walked in procession to one of the reception rooms to receive the customary congratulations. For two hours the guests filed past us; Irina was worn out. We then went to the Moika, preceded by our parents, who waited for us at the foot of the staircase to offer us the traditional bread and salt. We were then congratulated by all our servants. After this the same ceremony took place all over again at the Grand Duke Alexander’s palace.\n\nThe time for our departure arrived at last; a crowd of relatives and friends were waiting at the station. Once more we had to shake hands and be congratulated. After the last demonstrations of affection were over, we entered our coach; a black nose suddenly emerged from a profusion of flowers; and there was my Punch triumphantly ensconced among the roses.\n\nThe Grand Duchess Elisabeth was not present at our marriage. She considered that a nun would be out of place at such a worldly ceremony. However, I went to see her in Moscow a few days before; she welcomed me with her usual graciousness, and when I left she gave me her blessing.\n\nThe Tsar inquired through my future father-in-law what I would like for a wedding present. He thought of offering me an office at court, but I replied that His Majesty would gratify my wishes to the full by granting me the privilege of using the Imperial box at the theater. On receiving my reply, Nicholas II laughingly agreed.\n\nWe were overwhelmed with gifts: the most gorgeous jewels as well as the simplest and most touching presents from our peasants."
