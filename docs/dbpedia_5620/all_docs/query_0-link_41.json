        "text": "Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell announced that the team would move from its longtime home of Cleveland to Baltimore for the 1996 NFL season.\n\nSubsequent legal actions by the City of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise in which Modell agreed to return the Browns franchise to the league.\n\nThe agreement stipulated that the Browns franchise, including its history, records and intellectual property, would remain in Cleveland. In exchange, the NFL agreed to grant Modell a new franchise in Baltimore (which was eventually named the Ravens) and the City of Cleveland agreed to build an NFL-caliber venue to replace the aging Cleveland Stadium.\n\nJeremy worked on a cemetery research project while at Wright State University. He found military records for an Indian Wars veteran who served in the late 1890s. Anthony Ruhl now has a headstone, courtesy of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, thanks to Jeremy’s research.\n\n“Feador, whose car bumper sticker reads \"I Brake for Old Graveyards,\" also located the diary of another Adams Street Cemetery resident, George N. Huckins, in the Duke University Library.”\n\nBob DiBiasio, known fondly as “Bobby D” around town, is the Senior Vice President of Public Affairs for the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nBob’s association with the team dates back to 1979. He is renowned throughout the community as the city’s baseball memory and as an exceptionally friendly individual. You can frequently find him promoting both the team and the city at large, taking time to engage with fans who want to offer advice on the team or reminisce about their baseball memories.\n\nWhen the Bob Feller Museum in Iowa was closing, Jeremy and Bobby D flew to Van Meter and drove a U-Haul back to Cleveland full of items for the team to preserve and display at the stadium.\n\nIn the New York Times article about the trip, Jeremy is referred to as “another Indians employee,” which he has most definitely gotten over.\n\nStories about the Cuyahoga River fire on June 22, 1969 often combine fact and myth. The fire took place in Cleveland, a few miles north of Cuyahoga Valley National Park.\n\nHeavy industry dominates this section of the river. Railroad bridges near Republic Steel trapped debris in the river, causing it to pile up. Oil on the water added to its flammability. A flare tossed from an overpassing train likely provided the spark that ignited the debris. The fire lasted for less than a half hour and resulted in minor damage to the railroad bridges.\n\nInternationally renowned for its substantial holdings of Asian and Egyptian art, The Cleveland Museum of Art houses a diverse permanent collection of more than 61,000 works of art from around the world.\n\nThe museum provides free general admission to the public. With a $755 million endowment, it is the fourth-wealthiest art museum in the United States.\n\nPlayhouse Square is the largest performing arts center in the US outside of New York City (only Lincoln Center is larger).\n\nConstructed in a span of 19 months in the early 1920s, it has 10 performance spaces, including five theaters restored to their original 1920s elegance, that host more than 1,000 events a year, including some of the biggest titles on Broadway.\n\nThe Art Deco “Guardians of Transportation” figures on the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge are 43-feet tall and were carved out of local sandstone.\n\nWilbur Watson, the bridge’s engineer, wrote that the eight figures - who have stood guard over east-west traffic since 1932 - were meant to “typify the spirit of progress in transportation,” with each Guardian holding a different kind of vehicle in its hands.\n\nThe actual name of the team, as shown in standings, was Forest City, not \"Cleveland.” The name \"Forest Citys\" was used in the same generic style of the day in which the team from Chicago was called the \"Chicagos.\"\n\nModern writers often refer to the club as the \"Cleveland Forest Citys,\" which does not reflect 1870s usage, but does distinguish the team from the Rockford, Illinois, professional team that was also called \"Forest City,\" that being a long-standing nickname of both of those cities.\n\nJames Laurie “Deacon” White, who batted left-handed, finished his pro career with a .312 batting average, collecting 2,067 hits, 24 home runs, and 988 RBI in an era when home runs were rare. Only the legendary Cap Anson had more hits, runs and RBIs than White during those early days of baseball.\n\nIn addition, White helped six teams win championships and was the first player to bat in an organized professional league game, hitting a double at age 23 for the Forest Citys in a National Association contest in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1871.\n\nA right-handed pitcher, White was among the first players to throw a curveball, during a brief semi-pro stint with Cleveland in the 1860s. He also claimed he created the first catcher's mask, though he isn't officially credited with that invention.\n\nHe was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nDeacon White’s SABR Biography\n\nThe Original Cleveland Blues team began in 1878 as an amateur club. In 1879 they became part of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. The Blues played at Kennard Street Park (aka National League Park), which is currently East 46th Street & Cedar Ave.\n\nHugh Daily threw a no-hitter for the Blues on September 13, 1883. Other notable Blues players included Jack Glasscock and Ned Hanlon. The team was purchased by Charles Byrne in 1885 for $10,000 and folded into his Brooklyn Grays team.\n\nFirst published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in 1949, Franklin “Whitey” Lewis’s The Cleveland Indians begins with the organization’s early years as the Cleveland Forest Citys, covers the 1920 World Series victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers, and concludes with the excitement of the 1948 pennant race.\n\nWith the advantage of modern research, however, some of the stories and anecdotes included in Lewis’ book have been disproven. Unfortunately, many modern writers have relied heavily upon Lewis’ book while doing research of their own, thereby perpetuating the untrue myths Lewis included in his work.\n\nMike Miller is a Shoeless Joe Jackson historian and expert, and has volunteered at the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum as a tour guide for more than 10 years. His research led him to find the exact date and the exact hit when Joe got the nickname “Shoeless.”\n\nCLICK HERE to view the free digital version of his book on Joe’s career.\n\nYou can listen to Episode 2 of Season 1 of My Baseball History to hear our conversation HERE.\n\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer proclaimed, “The Blues Will Win The Pennant This Year” across the page when it printed the American League schedule on March 6, 1903.\n\nThe Plain Dealer continued to refer to the club as the Blues as somewhat of a protest to the new name of Naps, which was chosen by fans in a contest run by the rival Cleveland Press.\n\nFew reliable records or news reports survive about players in the Negro Leagues. Through dogged detective work, award-winning author and journalist Larry Tye has tracked down the truth about this majestic and enigmatic pitcher, interviewing more than two hundred Negro Leaguers and Major Leaguers, talking to family and friends who had never told their stories before, and retracing Paige’s steps across the continent.\n\nBuy a copy of Satchel: The Life and Times of an American Legend HERE\n\nLouis Van Oeyen (1865-1946) was the first photographer hired as staff on a Cleveland, Ohio, newspaper, and a pioneer in many techniques and activities of photojournalism.\n\nVan Oeyen was hired as a Cleveland Press photographer in 1901, after his photographs of the water intake explosion disaster in Lake Erie, and the assassination of President William McKinley, were published in the Press.\n\nDuring his career at the Press, he shot portraiture, politics, disaster, crime, scandal, and sports photographs. His greatest love was baseball, and he became official photographer for the American League in 1908, and for the World Series until 1922.\n\nThis portrait he took of Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of my favorite photos of Joe ever taken.\n\nImages from the Cleveland Plain Dealer digital archives prove that original photos with higher resolution must have existed at some point.\n\nLike this one, from the October 9, 1920 issue as the Indians headed into Game 4 of the World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. The paper depicted 20 players from the Cleveland squad, with each panel having a unique advertisement from a local merchant booster.\n\nHad this photo not been captioned this way in the April 18, 1901 issue of the Plain Dealer, you might not have known this was a shot of the 1901 team, especially based on the different uniforms the players are wearing with different city names and logos on their chests.\n\nOne of the great (and awful, and difficult, and rewarding) things about being a researcher is knowing how many other photos like this exist but have not yet been properly identified because it is not necessarily immediately apparent who is depicted.\n\nBefore the 1889 season, the Cleveland Blues switched from the American Association to the National League. They also earned a new nickname, the Cleveland Spiders, because so many of their players were very thin, long, tall, and gangly, reminiscent of spiders.\n\nThe 1892 Spiders are pictured here at League Park, with the original wooden stands visible in the background.\n\nCy Young pitched from 1890 to 1898 for the Cleveland Spiders, then returned to Cleveland from 1909 to 1911 to pitch for the Cleveland Naps.\n\nHe holds nearly all of the career counting statistics records for pitchers, including most Wins all time (511), most Losses (315), most Games Started (815), most Complete Games (with 749!), most Innings Pitched, most Batters Faced, and a handful of others.\n\nHe passed away in 1955, and in 1956, they started calling the award given to the best pitcher at the end of every season the Cy Young Award.\n\nCy Young’s SABR Biography\n\nEven after his playing days were over, Cy Young would often make the drive to Cleveland and be present at the ballpark.\n\nThis 1940 photograph depicts the greatest pitchers in the history of Cleveland baseball, as an old Cy Young shows off his curve ball grip to young phenom Bob Feller in the Indians locker room.\n\nSouth Carolina had a blossoming textile industry in the late-1800s and early-1900s. At its peak, there were 18 different cotton mills within a 3-mile radius in Greenville. Many mills had their own baseball team to improve morale, and those teams formed a league to play against each other.\n\nThis photo depicts the 1907 Victor Mill baseball team, featuring Shoeless Joe Jackson, middle row, second from left.\n\nBuy Tom Perry’s great book on the Textile League HERE.\n\nBuilt in 1891, League Park was situated at the northeast corner of Dunham Street (now known as East 66th Street) and Lexington Avenue in the Hough neighborhood. League Park was originally built as a wood structure, but was rebuilt using steel and concrete in 1910.\n\nHere is what it looked like circa 1905, as colorized by They Played In Color Galleries.\n\nSportswriters occasionally referred to teams by names other than what they were officially called.\n\nAfter the arrival of Louis Sockalexis in 1897, one of the many names used to describe Cleveland’s baseball team became the Indians.\n\nSometimes they were referred to as Tebeau’s Indians (Patsy Tebeau was the team’s Irish-American player-manager), Tebeau’s Tribe, and even as Tebeau’s Hibernian Indians.\n\nPatsy Tebeau’s SABR Biography\n\nLouis Sockalexis was a member of the Penobscot Indian tribe of Maine. He played in only 94 Major League games, but is remembered today as being the first recognized minority to perform in the National League.\n\nSockalexis was signed by the Cleveland Spiders in 1897, fifty years before Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nHe is depicted here in the May 19, 1895 issue of the Boston Post.\n\nLouis Sockalexis’ SABR Biography\n\nJames Madison Toy was an early Major League Baseball player who had a short two-year career with the Cleveland Blues and the Brooklyn Gladiators, both of the American Association.\n\nToy began his professional baseball career in the International League for the Utica, New York team. He showed his versatility by playing many different positions, as well as having a well known good throwing arm. He helped lead the Utica team to the International League championship in 1886.\n\nWhile his heritage is still uncertain, it is possible that with his inclusion on the 1887 Cleveland Blues of the American Association made Toy the first ever Native American to play Major League Baseball.\n\nIn 1899, Spiders owners Frank and Stanley Robison purchased a second team – the bankrupt St. Louis Perfectos of the National League (who later became the Cardinals) – and then promptly sent all of the Spiders' top talent to that club, including future Hall-of-Famers Cy Young, left fielder Jesse Burkett, and shortstop Bobby Wallace. The remaining Spiders were one of the worst teams in history.\n\nHere, the 1899 St. Louis Perfectos are pictured, with Cy Young in the lower left corner.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Rustlers were founded in 1894 and were one of the founding teams of the Western League, a league that would go on to become the American League. Other teams in the league included Detroit, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Toledo, and Sioux City.\n\nSome notable players from the Rustlers were George Pinkney, Bob Caruthers, Lady Baldwin, Crazy Schmit, and Bumpus Jones.\n\nPictured here is pitcher Harley Parker, who may have pitched one of the worst games in history on July 25, 1894.\n\nIn 1901, the American League (formerly Ban Johnson’s Western League) broke with the National Agreement and declared itself a competing Major League. The Cleveland franchise was among its eight charter members.\n\nAlthough some American League teams chose names abandoned by other major league teams in their respective cities (such as the Chicago White Stockings, Philadelphia Athletics, and [in 1902] the St. Louis Browns), the Cleveland team did not want to associate themselves with the disastrous 1899 Cleveland Spiders, so the new team became known as the Bluebirds or Blues.\n\nThe 1901 Cleveland Blues played 136 games during the regular season, winning 54 games while losing 82, and finished in seventh position. They played their home games at League Park I and drew 131,380 fans over the course of their home season.\n\nOnce called the “good angel of the American League,” Charles Somers was much more than one of the league’s founding members; he was also its principal financier.\n\nA shy, unassuming man who made his fortune in the coal business, Somers brought major-league baseball back to Cleveland in 1901, and also helped the junior circuit establish clubs in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston. At one point, the free-spending magnate was part-owner of four of the league’s eight franchises.\n\nCharles Somers’ SABR Biography\n\nThe most powerful figure of the Deadball Era, Ban Johnson’s rise to prominence in the national pastime was as improbable as it was meteoric.\n\nRelying neither on athletic renown nor inherited wealth, Johnson maneuvered his way into becoming president of the Western League in 1893, then skillfully transformed the fledgling circuit into one of the most formidable minor leagues of the late nineteenth century. In 1901, Johnson renamed the Western League the American League, declared it a major league, and then succeeded in challenging the one-league supremacy of the National League.\n\nJohnson’s triumph marked a turning point in baseball history, cementing the modern two-league system and setting the stage for the unparalleled financial successes of the coming years.\n\nBan Johnson’s SABR Biography\n\nIn 1902, Napoleon Lajoie became Cleveland's first big signing. From 1901 to 1904, Lajoie had the highest batting average in the league. In 1901, he batted .426, and led the American League in nearly every offensive category, winning the triple crown.\n\nLajoie became not only their second baseman, but also their manager. He was one of baseball’s first superstars, so Cleveland just up and named the whole team after him. His name was Napoleon, they called him “Nap” for short, and until 1911, Cleveland’s baseball team was officially called the Cleveland Naps.\n\nNapoleon Lajoie’s SABR Biography\n\nNapoleon Lajoie was inducted into the Cleveland Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951. His plaque, seen here, is on display at Progressive Field.\n\nLajoie combined graceful, effortless fielding with powerful, fearsome hitting to become one of the greatest all-around players of the Deadball Era, and one of the best second basemen of all time.\n\nAt 6’1″ and 200 pounds, Lajoie possessed an unusually large physique for his time, yet when manning the keystone sack he was wonderfully quick on his feet, threw like chain lightning, and went over the ground like a deer.\n\nGeorge Joseph \"Candy\" LaChance reached the majors in 1893, spending six years with the Brooklyn Grooms / Bridegrooms before moving to the Baltimore Orioles (1899), Cleveland Blues (1901) and Boston Americans (1902–05).\n\nHe hit .300 or more five times, and from 1894 to 1899 averaged 26 stolen bases each year, with a career-high 37 in 1895. He also led all National League hitters in 1895 with 108 RBI.\n\nLaChance earned the nickname \"Candy\" because he preferred to chew on peppermints rather than chewing tobacco.\n\nCandy LaChance’s SABR Biography\n\nJohn Rogers, described as a \"penny-pinching\" majority owner of the Phillies, assured Napoleon Lajoie that he would make the same salary as teammate Ed Delahanty.\n\nHowever, Lajoie discovered that while he was earning $2,600, Ed Delahanty was earning $3,000.\n\nRogers increased Lajoie's pay by $200 but the damage had already been done. \"Because I felt I had been cheated, I was determined to listen to any reasonable American League offer,\" Lajoie said.\n\nIt was nothing personal against Delahanty, for whom Lajoie changed positions to play First Base so Ed could go back to his natural position of Left Field. The two were even roommates on the team. It was a matter of principle.\n\nEd Delahanty’s SABR Biography\n\nIn 1910 auto magnate Hugh Chalmers offered an automobile to the baseball player with the highest batting average that season. What followed was a batting race unlike any before or since, between the greatest but most despised hitter, Detroit’s Ty Cobb, and the American League’s first superstar, Cleveland’s popular Napoleon Lajoie.\n\nThe race came down to the last game of the season, igniting more interest among fans than the World Series and becoming a national obsession. Cobb, thinking the prize was safely his, skipped the last two games of the season, while Lajoie suspiciously had eight hits in a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns. Although initial counts favored Lajoie, American League president Ban Johnson, the sport’s last word, announced Cobb the winner, and amid the controversy both players received cars.\n\nBuy Rick Huhn’s amazing book HERE.\n\nElmer Flick was the right fielder for Cleveland from 1902 to 1910, before Joe Jackson came to town. A speed demon, from 1904 through 1907, Flick had four straight years with at least a .300 batting average, at least 15 triples, and at least 35 steals. He had 10 straight seasons with 20 or more steals, 7 of those being seasons with 30 or more. Flick also won the 1905 batting title.\n\nElmer Flick’s SABR Biography\n\nAddie Joss pitched from 1902 to 1910 with the Cleveland Bronchos and Naps. He is baseball’s all-time leader in WHIP, with a 0.968 career mark, and is second all-time in career ERA, with a 1.887 mark, trailing only Ed Walsh’s 1.816 total.\n\nJoss completed 234 of the 260 games he started in his career, and finished with 160 wins in a little more than 8 full seasons.\n\nTo help raise money for Joss’ family after he passed away, the players organized the first ever gathering of All-Star players for a benefit game. It was essentially the first All-Star game in history, and it took place on July 24, 1911. The Cleveland Plain Dealer called it “The greatest array of players ever seen on one field.” The total raised was $12,931.60, the equivalent of more than $375,000 today.\n\nAddie Joss was inducted into the Cleveland Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. His plaque, seen here, is on display at Progressive Field.\n\nJoss was called the “Human Hairpin” because of his long arms, gangly build and pitching motion. He would turn his back to the plate, sometimes facing second base, and then whirl around and unleash a sidearm delivery to the plate.\n\nHall of Famer Bobby Wallace said “Joss sort of hid the ball on you. One moment, you’d be squinting at a long, graceful windup and the next instant, out of nowhere, the ball was hopping across the plate – and a lot of us were caught standing flat-footed with our bat glued to our shoulders.”\n\nFrom 1908 to 1922, Jack Graney was the Left Fielder for the Cleveland Naps and Indians. Though not officially named, he was essentially the team captain.\n\nNever one to hit for power or for a high average, Graney generated offense by working the count and drawing walks, earning the nickname “Three-and-two Jack” in the process.\n\nGraney’s hitting philosophy worked: despite posting a career batting average of just .250, the left-hander registered a .354 on-base percentage, and twice led the league in base on balls.\n\nJack Graney’s SABR Biography\n\nNot only was Jack Graney a major part of the team as a player, but he eventually became the play-by-play broadcaster for the Indians from 1932 to 1953, widely considered to be the first former big league player to broadcast a major league game.\n\nGraney called the World Series for a national audience in 1935 and also broadcast that year’s All-Star Game in Cleveland.\n\nGraney was the 2022 Ford C. Frick Award winner.\n\nHerb Score pitched for the Cleveland Indians from 1955 through 1959 and the Chicago White Sox from 1960 through 1962. He was the AL Rookie of the Year in 1955, and an AL All-Star in 1955 and 1956. Due to an on-field injury that occurred in 1957, he retired early as a player in 1962.\n\nScore was a television and radio broadcaster for the Indians from 1964 through 1997. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nHerb Score SABR Biography\n\nLook at how deep it is to straightaway center field. The fact that Tris Speaker would play shallow enough to be able to turn unassisted double plays in this park is insane. But he knew what he was capable of, and he made it happen.\n\nCheck out the 360 degree views of League Park from the upper deck, recreated by Brian Powers of Bandbox Ballparks, by clicking HERE (trust me, do it).\n\nPeople say that Joe Jackson’s first three full seasons in baseball may be the best 3-year run in history. From 1911 through 1913, he led the major leagues with 656 hits. He slashed a .393 batting average, a .462 on base percentage, and a .574 slugging percentage with a 192 OPS+. He averaged 219 hits, 43 doubles, 21 triples and 6 home runs. He also averaged 119 runs, 81 runs batted in, 34 steals, and 320 total bases per season.\n\nJoe Jackson’s SABR Biography\n\nBristol Robotham Lord played from 1905 to 1913 for the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Naps, and Boston Braves.\n\nLord, pictured here, is best known for a 1910 trade between Philadelphia and Cleveland in which he was exchanged for Morrie Rath and Shoeless Joe Jackson.\n\nJackson had only played 10 games in his MLB career at that point, but went on to become one of the best hitters in baseball history.\n\nMorrie Rath’s SABR Biography\n\nOne of James Dunn’s earliest moves as the new owner of the Cleveland team was to rehire most of the front-office staff and meet personally with Charles Somers for his input, assuring a smooth transition. Somers was certainly impressed. He gave his support to Dunn, calling him “a real live wire (who) will … give Cleveland a good ball club.” His most significant early move was the acquisition of Tris Speaker, star center fielder for the Boston Red Sox. The deal was expensive, costing Cleveland two players, including a solid pitcher, as well as $55,000 in cash. Dunn asserted: “A tail-ender will not pay in Cleveland, but a first division team will draw big … I would not have thought of entering baseball if I had intended to be content with a second division outfit.”\n\nLegendary for his short outfield play, Tris Speaker led the American League in putouts seven times and in double plays six times in a 22-year career with Boston, Cleveland, Washington, and Philadelphia. Speaker’s career totals in both categories are still major-league records at his position.\n\nNo slouch at the plate, Speaker had a lifetime batting average of .345, sixth on the all-time list, and no one has surpassed his career mark of 792 doubles.\n\nTris Speaker’s SABR Biography\n\nIn May of 1926, Dutch Leonard contacted the office of the Tigers and informed Detroit owner, Frank Joseph Navin, that he held proof that Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had fixed and bet on a game played on September 25, 1919.\n\nLeonard contacted Ban Johnson's office, as well. Navin and Johnson believed Leonard's story and agreed to buy him off for $20,000, the amount that Leonard argued Detroit owed him. So, Dutch surrendered his two letters of proof to them. They, in turn, notified Commissioner Landis of the events, as a courtesy.\n\nNext, Johnson contacted the two players and called them into his office. Cobb and Speaker denied the charges. Johnson, not believing them, told them they had to quit. On November 2, Ty left a letter of resignation at Navin's office. On November 29, Speaker's resignation was announced, with no explanation given.\n\nDutch Leonard’s SABR Biography\n\nBaseball Gods In Scandal\n\nJoe Sewell got called up in mid-September of 1920 and ended up taking Ray Chapman’s place at Shortstop in the middle of a pennant race after Ray passed away. He was only 21 years old, but he hit over .300 and struck out only 4 times for the rest of the season.\n\nFrom 1921 through 1929, back when there were only 154 games in a season, Sewell never played less than 152 games in a season.\n\nJoe Sewell’s SABR Biography\n\nTim Murnane had gotten his start in professional baseball as a member of the 1872 Middletown (CT) Mansfields before six seasons of service to the Major Leagues with the Philadelphia Athletics, the Philadelphia White Stockings, the Boston Red Caps, and the Providence Grays.\n\nWhen Murnane suffered a fatal heart attack while attending an opera performance at Schubert Theater in Boston in February of 1917, it was learned that he had left only meager savings from his long baseball career to support his widow and four children from his second marriage.\n\nA memorial fund was established, with the support of the American League and the Baseball Writers Association of America, and Murnane's good friend and former Red Sox team owner John I. Taylor began to orchestrate plans for a benefit game pitting his old club against a selection of Major League greats.\n\nTim Murnane’s SABR Biography\n\nJay Jaffe shows us how to use his revolutionary ranking system to ensure the right players are recognized at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nThe foundation of Jaffe’s approach is his JAWS system, an acronym for the Jaffe WAR Score, which he developed over a decade ago. Through JAWS, each candidate can be objectively compared on the basis of career and peak value to the players at his position who are already in the Hall of Fame. Because of its utility, JAWS has gained an increasing amount of exposure in recent years.\n\nBuy The Cooperstown Casebook HERE.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox had thrown the 1919 World Series, but they hadn’t been caught or punished after the series, so they played almost the entire 1920 season.\n\nDuring the span of the previous four years, from August 26th, 1916 through August 26th, 1920, the White Sox never lost more than 4 games in a row.\n\nBut from August 27th to September 4th, 1920, the White Sox lost seven consecutive games, falling all the way down to third place in the American League, behind the first place Indians and the second place Yankees.\n\nHere, Joe Jackson takes batting practice before a 1920 White Sox game.\n\nIn Game 5 of the 1920 World Series, Cleveland turned an unassisted triple play, Elmer Smith hit a grand slam, and pitcher Jim Bagby, Sr. hit a home run against the Brooklyn Robins (today's Dodgers).\n\nIt was the first time any of those events had ever happened in the World Series, and shortstop Bill Wambsganss's big moment remains the only unassisted triple play in the history of the postseason.\n\nBill Wambsganss' SABR Biography\n\nElmer Smith’s SABR Biography\n\nJim Bagby, Sr.’s SABR Biography\n\nOctober 10, 1920 SABR Games Project\n\nIn 173 career games at League Park, Babe Ruth batted .372 with 46 home runs, 33 doubles and 11 triples. He drove in 144 runs, scored 147, and had 394 total bases. He walked 177 times in 173 games, which helped him achieve a .528 career on base percentage at League Park.\n\nBabe Ruth holds the all-time record with a .689 career slugging percentage. Second place all-time is Ted Williams at .634, more than 50 points behind him. But at League Park, Babe slugged .728.\n\nCleveland pitcher George Uhle said the hardest ball he ever saw hit was a line drive Babe hit at League Park. It was still rising when it hit the top of the screen near the scoreboard, 460 feet away.\n\nUhle said, “It was the most terrific hit I ever saw. It would have landed on East 79th Street, but the screen stopped it and he only got a double.”\n\nGeorge Uhle’s SABR Biography\n\nBabe gave Jack Geiser, the kid who retrieved and returned the ball Ruth hit for his 500th home run, a $20 bill (the equivalent of more than $300 today), an autographed baseball (worth about $25,000 today), and a chance to sit in the Yankees’ dugout.\n\nRuth is seen here with Lou Gehrig looking at the home run ball in the League Park dugout on August 11, 1929.\n\nAt the end of the 1929 season, Ruth had 516 career home runs. Rogers Hornsby was 2nd on baseball’s all-time list with 277.\n\nAugust 12, 1929 Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\n“My father signed [my first] contract with me, as my guardian. I received a check for $1.00 to make it legal…I also received a ball autographed by all the Cleveland Indians.”\n\n— Excerpt from Bob Feller’s Little Black Book of Baseball Wisdom\n\nJeremy and the Guardians have the ball pictured here on display at the Bob Feller exhibit, but is this that baseball?\n\nThe story of Bob’s “gopher ball” signed by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig\n\nIn the first half of 1970, Ray Fosse hit .313 with 16 home runs and 45 runs batted in. He hit in 23 consecutive games beginning June 9, the longest AL streak since 1961. Fosse was rewarded with a spot on the American League All-Star Game roster.\n\nIn the bottom of the 12th inning, Pete Rose singled and was on second when the Cubs’ Jim Hickman singled to center field. The Royals’ Amos Otis fired the ball home to try to nail Rose. Fosse moved up the third-base line to catch the throw from Otis when Rose and the baseball seemingly arrived at the same time. Rose crashed into Fosse’s left shoulder to score the winning run, bowling Fosse over.\n\nRay Fosse’s SABR Biography\n\n\"One night, after a baseball game, Babe Ruth came in and bought rounds for everyone in the bar,\" says Hotz. The Babe paid his tab with a check.\n\n\"Thirteen dollars and sixty-five cents,\" says Hotz. The Yankee legend rarely paid for a drink, however -- even when he \"paid.\"\n\n\"We still have it in my mom's safe,\" says Hotz. \"My grandpa refused to cash it.\"\n\nEarl Averill was another great Centerfielder for the Cleveland Indians from 1929 to 1939, picking up right where Tris Speaker left off.\n\nThe first ever All-Star Game in Major League history was in 1933 at Comiskey Park in Chicago. Earl was selected as an All-Star every year from 1933 through 1938 when he was 36 years old.\n\nHe was top 10 in MVP voting 4 times, and top 5 three times.\n\nMunicipal Stadium was completed in 1931 and was designed for access by automobile. It held 80,000 people, which, for most of its tenure, was the largest seating capacity of any Major League stadium.\n\nThe stadium was built for football, and for the Indians, and the Indians played all of their games at the stadium from the middle of the 1932 season through 1933.\n\nLou Boudreau was a Shortstop with the Cleveland Indians from 1938 to 1950. He was player/manager from 1942 through 1950.\n\nLou finished 17th or higher in MVP voting for every single year in the 1940s, including 8 top-10 finishes, 3 top-5 finishes, and actually winning the award in 1948 when he had career-highs in nearly every offensive category: hits, home runs, runs, RBI, walks, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS+, and total bases.\n\nLou Boudreau’s SABR Biography\n\nRocky Colavito was a nine-time All-Star who averaged 33 home runs per year for his first 11 seasons, exceeding 40 home runs three times and 100 runs batted in six times.\n\nColavito was the fifth player in the history of the American League to have eleven consecutive 20 home run seasons (1956–1966). In 1959, he hit four consecutive home runs in one game and, was the AL home run champion. He was also the first outfielder in AL history to complete a season without making an error.\n\n“The Curse of Rocky Colavito” is a phenomenon that supposedly prevents Cleveland from winning the World Series. Its origin is traced back to the unpopular trade of the right fielder to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn in 1960.\n\nRocky Colavito’s SABR Biography\n\nBob Feller was a right-handed starting pitcher who began his career at the age of 17, before he finished high school. His high school graduation was covered by network radio.\n\nHe served as an anti-aircraft gunner on the battleship USS Alabama in WWII, missing 4 years in the prime of his career, and yet he STILL won 266 games. An extremely conservative estimate is that he would have won another 70 if he hadn’t left for the war, some people think he would have won another 100 games had he not missed that time.\n\nEven still, he threw 3 no-hitters, including one on opening day in 1940 when he was only 21 years old, and another 12 one-hitters.\n\nBob Feller’s SABR Biography\n\nIn intimate, absorbing detail, Luke Epplin’s Our Team traces the story of the integration of the Cleveland Indians and their quest for a World Series title through four key participants:\n\nBill Veeck, an eccentric and visionary owner adept at exploding fireworks on and off the field;\n\nLarry Doby, a soft-spoken, hard-hitting pioneer whose major-league breakthrough shattered stereotypes that so much of white America held about Black ballplayers;\n\nBob Feller, a pitching prodigy from the Iowa cornfields who set the template for the athlete as businessman;\n\nand Satchel Paige, a legendary pitcher from the Negro Leagues whose belated entry into the majors whipped baseball fans across the country into a frenzy.\n\nBuy it HERE.\n\nBob Feller was the first major sports celebrity to enlist in the military after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, doing so just days after the attack. In the weeks and months that followed, others followed his lead, including some of baseball’s brightest stars. Joe DiMaggio. Ted Williams. Hank Greenberg. Stan Musial.\n\nA total of 4,500 professional ballplayers ended up serving in World War II. But Feller led the way. As veteran sportswriter Bob Hertzel wrote in 2010 at the time of Feller’s death, “Feller made it the American thing to do, to give up life as a professional athlete to serve in the military effort against Germany and Japan.’’\n\nBill Veeck bought the team for $1.6 million on June 22, 1946. He saw 80,000 empty seats by the lakefront and decided he wanted all of Cleveland’s home games played there again.\n\nVeeck was instrumental in signing Larry Doby to the club, breaking the color barrier in the American League. The two are seen here together.\n\nBill Veeck’s SABR Biography\n\nListen to my interview with Bill’s son, Mike Veeck, HERE.\n\nLarry Doby broke the color barrier in the American league when he became the first Black player for the Cleveland Indians.\n\nSome people say he may have had it even harder than Jackie Robinson. Jackie played in Montreal in 1946, so he had a whole year of preparation for the treatment he would face when he got to the Major Leagues, playing against white players, and in front of mostly white fans.\n\nDoby, on the other hand, was playing with the Newark Eagles of the Negro League until July 2, 1947, when he signed with Cleveland. He made his Cleveland Indians debut three days later, on July 5 at Comiskey Park in Chicago, becoming the first player to go directly to the white Major Leagues from the Negro leagues.\n\nLarry Doby’s SABR Biography\n\nLuke Easter was best known for his powerful home runs, colloquially known as \"Easter Eggs.\"\n\nOn July 18, 1948, while with the Homestead Grays, Easter became the first player to hit a home run into the center field bleachers at New York's Polo Grounds during game action, a drive estimated at 490 feet.\n\nDuring his rookie season, he hit the longest home run in the history of Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, a 477-foot blast over the auxiliary scoreboard in right field. The only other player to match that feat was Mickey Mantle, who did it in 1960.\n\nLuke Easter’s SABR Biography\n\nThe Cleveland Cubs were a Negro League baseball team in Cleveland in 1931 and 1932. Even though they were hampered by disarray in the Negro Leagues and the crumbling economy, the Cubs managed the best record for a pre-World War II Cleveland Negro League team at 29 wins and 24 losses in 1931.\n\nThe team played a great deal of its games at Kinsman Hardware Field, a small venue that only held a few thousand fans.\n\nThe best player on their 1931 team was a pitcher named Satchel Paige, seen here. Paige had a 199 ERA+, a 0.908 WHIP, and averaged 4.5 strikeouts for every walk that season.\n\nSatchel Paige was 41 years old (maybe???) when the Indians signed him in 1948. A lot of people thought it was a gimmick. A publicity stunt. That Paige was washed up, and Bill Veeck knew it, but he was trying to sell tickets to black fans in Cleveland. He wasn’t washed up, though, and became an integral part of Cleveland’s run to the World Series.\n\nLarry Doby and Satchel Paige became the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians won in 1948.\n\nSatchel Paige’s SABR Biography\n\nThe 1948 American League tie-breaker game was a one-game extension to the 1948 regular season, played between the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox to determine the winner of the American League pennant.\n\nThe game was played on October 4, 1948, at Fenway Park in Boston. It was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win–loss records of 96–58. This was the first-ever one-game playoff in the AL, and the only one before 1969, when the leagues were split into divisions.\n\nGene Bearden SABR Biography\n\nOctober 4, 1948 SABR Games Project\n\nThe Cleveland Buckeyes existed in an era of war and racial strife. Overshadowed by the Indians' title in 1948, the Buckeyes were a very prominent team in the Negro American League, having won a World Series in 1945. The decline of the Buckeyes was not a result of decreased competitive play on the field, but rather the integration of Major League Baseball.\n\nBuy Stephanie Liscio’s book Integrating Cleveland Baseball HERE.\n\nWhile Joe probably never had the chance to see it, the Indians did, indeed, send the clock to the Jacksons in recognition of Joe’s induction into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame.\n\nThis photo, from the Jackson family scrapbooks, shows where Katie kept the clock on their mantel.\n\nThere are a handful of theories as to where some of the missing items may be. Unfortunately, we will most likely never know for sure, and the team will almost certainly never get them back.\n\nOn July 5, 1947, Larry Doby and Indians Owner Bill Veeck met in the General Manager’s office at Comiskey Park to hammer out the details of Doby’s contract. For $5,000 and a promise of $1,000 more if he was still with the team 30 days after signing, Doby was officially a member of the Cleveland Indians.\n\nOn June 26, 1916, Indians management rolled out the new concept of numbered uniforms. The next day, The Plain Dealer recorded a brief mention of this historic event:\n\n“An innovation was sprung by the management when the Indians appeared with numbers upon their sleeves such as are worn by the drivers of race horses. It was the carrying out of an idea by Vice President Robert McRoy, and will, it is expected, be adopted by the league. Graney for instance, is № 1; Turner, № 2; Speaker № 3; and so on.”\n\nIn 1921, the Cleveland Indians wore \"Worlds Champions\" across their chests because they could — they won the World Series in 1920. Imagine the hubris it takes to wear that on the front of your jersey everyday.\n\nEveryone says the reigning champs in any sport have a target on their back, but that's speaking figuratively. This is a target on the front.\n\nThe Indians finished 94-60 in 1921, good for second in the AL behind the Yanks at 98-55.\n\nElected in 1967, Cleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes’ platform on the environment stressed a people-first approach that we now call environmental justice.\n\nStokes served as the 51st mayor of Cleveland, and was one of the first black elected mayors of a major U.S. city.\n\nHe is buried at the historic Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland.\n\nCleveland sports teams have set records for futility in baseball, football, and basketball.

Here they are in 1911 with Shoeless Joe Jackson. Their stats in 1911? Lajoie had the \"low\" batting average of the group at .365, while Jackson set the MLB rookie record with a .408 average. Cobb led the Majors with a .419 average, 127 RBI, and 83 steals.\n\nA meaningless game at the end of the 1919 regular season almost cost Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker their careers, and their legacies.\n\nHere they are in 1911, locked in as they study someone in the batting cage.\n\nBrian Powers of Bandbox Ballparks is able to do what he does only if he can get his hands on a full set of blueprints of the stadiums he’s trying to recreate.\n\nTo date, he has digitally recreated Comiskey Park, League Park, Crosley Field, and Ebbets Field.\n\nThe blueprints pictured here are from Comiskey.\n\nBrian looks at old photos to make sure he’s decorating spaces accurately. Here is a later version of the Bard’s Room at Comiskey Park.\n\nYou can take a 360 degree tour of an earlier version, decorated appropriately for that era, HERE.\n\nIt’s free, and it’ll give you some bonus content throughout the month that you won’t get from the podcast episodes or by following any of our other social media platforms.\n\nWe put out new issues on the second Friday and the fourth Friday of every month. No more, no less.\n\nSubscribe To The Newsletter\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nIn intimate, absorbing detail, Luke Epplin’s Our Team traces the story of the integration of the Cleveland Indians and their quest for a World Series title through four key participants:\n\nBill Veeck, an eccentric and visionary owner adept at exploding fireworks on and off the field;\n\nLarry Doby, a soft-spoken, hard-hitting pioneer whose major-league breakthrough shattered stereotypes that so much of white America held about Black ballplayers;\n\nBob Feller, a pitching prodigy from the Iowa cornfields who set the template for the athlete as businessman;\n\nand Satchel Paige, a legendary pitcher from the Negro Leagues whose belated entry into the majors whipped baseball fans across the country into a frenzy.\n\nBuy it HERE.\n\nCleveland sports teams have set records for futility in baseball, football, and basketball. But even beyond that, Cleveland sports fans have witnessed more than their share of weird, wild, random, and odd occurrences, from front office ineptitude to absurd losses to bizarre injuries and more.\n\nVince Guerrieri’s book sheds light on them all.\n\nYou can buy it HERE.\n\nYou can also retweet the pinned tweet on the My Baseball History twitter profile for a chance to win a signed copy of either Luke’s book or Vince’s book, so do that, too! HERE!\n\nI’ve rented the field at League Park for the evening of Friday, July 26th, 2024 from 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm. To fulfill a lifelong dream to play on the field at League Park, I will be throwing an 1860s style baseball game that evening which will start at 7:00 pm that night and be open to the public.\n\nThe 44th National Sports Collectors Convention will be held at the I-X Center in Cleveland from July 24th through July 28th, 2024. Follow The National on twitter HERE.\n\nIf you’re planning on being in Cleveland for that, carve some time out of your Friday night plans to come watch my game at League Park.\n\nEntrance to the game will be $10 per person, but that price will also get you free admission to the Baseball Heritage Museum, which operates out of the original ticket office at League Park. All proceeds from the game will be donated to the museum, as well.\n\nMake a donation toward the game HERE."
