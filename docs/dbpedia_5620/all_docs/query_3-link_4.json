        "text": "(1914–99). Between May 15 and July 16, 1941, Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees hit safely in 56 consecutive baseball games. The feat proved to be one of the most durable records in major-league baseball. Skilled in the outfield as well as at bat, DiMaggio was counted among the game’s greatest all-round players.\n\nJoseph Paul DiMaggio was born in Martinez, California, on November 25, 1914. He quit school at age 14. Three years later he began playing baseball with the San Francisco Seals, a minor-league team. He reached the major leagues in 1936 as a member of the Yankees.\n\nDiMaggio, known as the Yankee Clipper, played for the Yankees from 1936 to 1942 and from 1946 to 1951. (He missed three seasons serving in the military during World War II.) He helped the Yankees win the world series nine times, leading the American League in batting in 1939 and 1940. DiMaggio was named most valuable player for the American League three times, in 1939, 1941, and 1947. He retired at the end of the 1951 season with 361 home runs and a career batting average of .325. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nAfter his retirement, DiMaggio became a television spokesman and worked for charity. In 1954 he married film star Marilyn Monroe. The marriage lasted less than a year, but the couple remained close until her death in 1962. DiMaggio died on March 8, 1999, in Hollywood, Florida."
