DiMaggio was nicknamed “Joltin Joe” since he was so fast as a center fielder who played that position his entire life as a baseball player in the New York Yankees. According to Baseballhall, “He was regarded as one of the greatest players who ever played the game.” Joe DiMaggio was first introduced in the hall of fame in 1955. Joe DiMaggio was the first baseball player to set a record of a historic fifty-six-game hitting streak that lasted for two months and which ended against the Cleveland Indians on July 17, 1941, according to History.com.\n\nThere is a special guest named Peter who will be speaking about his knowledge of the history of Joe DiMaggio. Peter remembers going to Yankee stadium as a teenager who recalls the star of the Yankee team, Joe DiMaggio who started a hitting streak record and remembers his first striking game that started in May, which Peter recalled during baseball history. According to Wikipedia, DiMaggio’s brothers played baseball as major league center fielders. Fun fact; Marilyn Monroe was married to Joe DiMaggio for one year. On Joe DiMaggio’s last game on December 11, 1951, he described it as “when baseball is no longer fun, it’s no longer a game”.
