Equal opportunity employer Memorial Healthcare System recruits, hires, and promotes qualified candidates for employment without regard to race, color, age, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or any factor prohibited by law. Employment is subject to post-offer, pre-placement assessment, including drug testing. Veteranâs Preference We proudly offer Veteran's Preference to former military, reservists, and military spouses (including widows and widowers). You must indicate your status on your application to take advantage of this program. E-Verify Candidates must possess authorization to work in the United States. Memorial Healthcare System utilizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) E-Verify system to comply with verifying work authorization. For additional information about E-Verify in English and Spanish, you may visit https://www.e-verify.gov/. Be where you are valued. Memorial Healthcare System provides preference as part of our commitment to honoring the service and sacrifice of veterans in alignment with state regulations. Veteranâs Preference allows for the first choice in interviewing, hiring, retention, and promotion after deployment when all other applicant qualifications are equal. However, Veteran's Preference does not guarantee a job. Who is eligible for Veteranâs Preference? We are proud to offer preference to internal and external applicants who identify within these categories: veterans, disabled veterans, spouse of a disabled veteran, unremarried veteran widow/widower, certain family members, active reservists and members of the National Guard. What should I do if I am eligible for Veteranâs Preference? You must claim your Veteranâs Preference status on your application. If selected for a job, you must provide documentation regarding your status. How does Memorial verify that someone is eligible for Veteranâs Preference? We require specific documentation as determined by the basis for which someone claims preference. For example, the documentation for a disabled veteran is different from the documentation required for the spouse of a veteran killed in the line of duty. How often can an eligible person claim Veteran's Preference at Memorial? There is no limit to how often internal or external applicants can use preference when a job is posted externally on our career website or elsewhere. What if there are two equally qualified, preference-eligible job applicants? In this case, the selection is based on the eligibility category in accordance with Florida law. First preference is given to: An honorably discharged veteran who has served on active duty and has a service-connected, compensable disability. A spouse of a person who has a total, permanent, service-connected disability and cannot qualify for employment. A spouse of a person missing in action, captured or forcibly detained or interned by a foreign government or power. What do I do if I am denied Veteran's Preference? If you feel you have been unfairly denied Veteranâs Preference by Memorial Healthcare System, please contact EmployeeRelations@mhs.net. You may also file a complaint with the Florida Department of Veteransâ Affairs (FDVA).
