        "text": "Born in 1914 in Martinez California, Joe DiMaggio started and ended his Major League career with the New York Yankees. Between 1936 and 1951, DiMaggio helped the Yankees to nine World Series titles. He earned widespread fame for his record 56-game hitting streak in 1941. Following his retirement in 1951, DiMaggio was briefly married to Marilyn Monroe and elected to the Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nDuring his long and peaceful retirement, DiMaggio remained very much a public figure by appearing as a radio and television spokesman for various products. He passed away on March 8, 1999 from complications of lung cancer at the age of 84.\n\nJoe DiMaggio is one of those rare athletic heroes (like Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson), whose legacies transcend sports to symbolize aspects of history and culture. Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch said of DiMaggio, \"He represented the best in America. It was his character, his generosity, his sensitivity. He was someone who set a standard every father would want his children to follow.\""
