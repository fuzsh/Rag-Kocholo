        "text": "The brother of Hall of Famer, Joe DiMaggio, Dom DiMaggio was a very good baseball player in his own right.\n\nNicknamed the \"Little Professor\" (Which is precisely what he looked like), DiMaggio would be an effective leadoff man from the second he put on a Boston uniform. He debuted in 1940 and went to the All-Star Game for the next two years. In both of those years, he had at least 165 Hits, and batted over .280.\n\nLike so many other baseball players, he went into military duty due to World War II, and that would cost him three years. He came back in 1946, batting .316 and going to his third All-Star Game, showing that he hadn't missed a beat. From 1949 to 1952, he was a regular All-Star. In that stretch, he had two .300 seasons, and he never batted below .294. He had two Runs Scored titles, one of which was in 1950. That year, he led the AL in Triples and Stolen Bases.\n\nHis play fell apart in 1953, and he was released during the season. DiMaggio played his entire career with the Red Sox, and he had 1,680 Hits with a Slash Line of .298/.383/419. The Red Sox chose DiMaggio for their Hall of Fame in 1995."
