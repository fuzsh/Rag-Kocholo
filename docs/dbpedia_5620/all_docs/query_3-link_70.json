One of the most dominant and popular athletes in United States history, \"Joltin’ Joe\" was an All-Star every season of his 13 year career, taking home three American League Most Valuable Player Awards and leading the Yankees to a remarkable 9 World Series Championships. In 1941, \"The Yankee Clipper,\" a lifetime .325 batter, set a Major League Baseball record, getting a hit in 56 consecutive games.\n\nThe son of Italian immigrants, DiMaggio had two brothers, Dominic (Dom) and Vincent (Vince,) who also played in the Major Leagues. The native Californian made international headlines with his short-lived marriage to actress Marilyn Monroe in 1954.\n\nEnshrined in Baseball’s Hall of Fame in 1955, Dimaggio is remembered, not only for his achievements on the diamond, but as an icon for the era in which he played.\n\nLocation\n\nCurrently not on view\n\nCredit Line\n\nCharles E. and Vickie Weitzenhofer\n\nID Number\n\n1989.0030.01\n\naccession number\n\n1989.0030\n\ncatalog number\n\n1989.0030.01\n\nObject Name\n\nbutton, baseball\n\nPhysical Description\n\ncloth (ribbon material)\n\nmetal (overall material)\n\npaper (overall material)\n\nplastic (overall material)\n\nMeasurements\n\noverall: 5 in x 1 in; x 12.7 cm x 2.54 cm\n\nSee more items in\n\nCulture and the Arts: Sport and Leisure\n\nSports & Leisure\n\nNational Museum of American History\n\nname of sport or game\n\nBaseball\n\nSubject\n\nSports\n\nButtons, Badges, Ribbons\n\nRecord ID\n\nnmah_683747\n\nMetadata Usage (text)\n\nCC0\n\nGUID (Link to Original Record)\n\nhttp://n2t.net/ark:/65665/ng49ca746a5-0589-704b-e053-15f76fa0b4fa"
