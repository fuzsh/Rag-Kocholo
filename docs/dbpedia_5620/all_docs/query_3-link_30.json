        "text": "In Memoriam\n\nJoe DiMaggio, Jr.\n\nJoe was a member of our class but dropped out of Yale after his freshman year and joined the Marine Corps as a private. He died in 1999. Below are two articles:\n\nLos Angeles Times article on the occasion of his death\n\nPBS article about his relationship with his father\n\nSon of Yankees Baseball Legend Led Troubled Life\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nAugust 08, 1999\n\nJoe DiMaggio Jr., the only child of baseball great Joe DiMaggio, died late Friday at a hospital in the Northern California town of Antioch, apparently of natural causes, hospital officials said Saturday. He was 57.\n\nHe was the only son of DiMaggio and Dorothy Arnold, an actress whom the sports legend married in 1939. The athlete had no children with his second wife, Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThe younger DiMaggio was estranged from his father and had seen him infrequently over the last few years. However, he was one of six pallbearers at the March funeral of the \"Yankee Clipper\" in San Francisco.\n\nDiMaggio Jr. was not breathing and had no heartbeat when he was taken by ambulance to Sutter Delta Medical Center late Friday, a hospital spokesman said. Attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful.\n\nThe younger DiMaggio, who was living in nearby Pittsburg, had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and got into several minor scrapes with police. He also experienced periods of homelessness.\n\nJoseph Paul DiMaggio Jr. was born Oct. 23, 1941, in San Francisco. After his parents divorced three years later, he spent much of his early life in summer camps and military schools, including the now-defunct Black Foxe Military Institute, a few blocks west of Paramount Studios in Hollywood. It was known as the school of choice for the sons of Hollywood celebrities.\n\nAs he entered his teen years, the youth split his time between his mother, who was pursuing her acting career in Hollywood, and his father, who had begun seeing Monroe. Young Joe and Monroe were reportedly close, and the boy often accompanied the couple on dates.\n\nHe spent his high school years at a prep school in New Jersey, where he shunned baseball to play football. He was the kicker on the team and by all accounts a bright student. However, his father, who was living in New York, had little time for his son and never saw his games.\n\nYoung DiMaggio enrolled at Yale University as a freshman in 1960 but quit after the first year because he had grown to hate the Eastern winters. He returned to Los Angeles and worked at odd jobs before deciding to join the Marine Corps.\n\nDespite his father's divorce from Monroe, young Joe remained close to the actress. He phoned her about 8:30 on the night of Aug. 4, 1962, to tell her that he had broken off his engagement to the daughter of a wealthy San Diego contractor. The next day, DiMaggio Jr. learned that Monroe had died from an apparent overdose of drugs and alcohol.\n\nHe attended the funeral, which was closed to much of Hollywood, wearing his dress Marine uniform.\n\nAfter Monroe's death, he finished his enlistment in the Marines and married a 17-year-old girl from San Diego, but the union lasted just a year.\n\nReturning to civilian life, DiMaggio Jr. took a series of odd jobs and eventually moved to the East Coast, where he worked for his uncle Dom DiMaggio, the onetime great outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, who owned a polyurethane foam company near Boston.\n\nThat is where the younger Joe met and wed Sue Adams, who had two daughters from a previous marriage. He eventually moved back to California to run a polyurethane foam business for his father and two business partners.\n\nJoe DiMaggio Sr. grew attached to his son's stepdaughters and doted over them as a grandfather.\n\nWorking for his father proved problematic for the younger DiMaggio, who felt that no matter how hard he worked he could never do anything right in his father's eyes. That led to bouts of drinking and fights with his wife that often left her battered and bloody. Drugs came next, particularly speed. The business was lost and the couple divorced in 1974.\n\nTwo years later, DiMaggio Jr. was seriously injured in an automobile accident, and a piece of his brain had to be removed because of a blood clot. That surgery seemed to make him even quicker to anger and to have less control of his actions.\n\nHis father tried to help him recover, buying him a $75,000 Peterbilt truck cab, but he wrecked the truck and by the late 1980s was working odd jobs and living in a trailer near Martinez, Calif., his father's hometown.\n\nIn his only known on-the-record interview in recent years, DiMaggio Jr. spoke with the tabloid television magazine show \"Inside Edition.\" In the interview, broadcast Feb. 11, he explained why he had not gone to the side of his ailing father when he was fighting cancer in Florida.\n\n\"You know, I never got the words 'Come now,' or I would've been there in a flash,\" he said. \"I love him and just all of the things that are felt, but never said, between people. When he wants me there, I'll be there.\"\n\nAlthough DiMaggio Jr. did not subsequently see his father before he died, his two stepchildren were at the baseball great's bedside, along with Dom DiMaggio and two other friends.\n\nDiMaggio Sr. left his only child a $20,000 annual trust fund in his will, signed in 1996, the year the two reportedly last saw each other. He also bequeathed his son 45% from the sale of his firm, Yankee Clipper Enterprises.\n\nHe left the two girls he considered his grandchildren considerably more.\n\nAnother Joseph DiMaggio, the son of the baseball legend's late brother Mike, was left $100,000. That Joe DiMaggio made something of a name for himself as a chef, with restaurants in Florida and Toronto.\n\nOn Saturday, Marie Amato Goodman, a cousin whose son was a close friend of Joe DiMaggio Jr., said he was simply unable to cope with his father's fame.\n\n\"He had a brilliant mind,\" Goodman said. \"He lived in the shadow of his father and could not rise above that.\n\ntop\n\nPBS Article: Joe Dimaggio Jr.\n\nWhen Joe DiMaggio died, a 57-year old man with a gray pony-tail was one of the select few allowed to attend the family funeral. He was a casket-bearer that day, his face anonymous to the national audience. The man was not close to DiMaggio, had not even spoken with the aging legend in years. DiMaggio wouldn't even talk about him.\n\nHis name was Joe DiMaggio Jr.\n\nJoe Jr., DiMaggio's namesake and only child, was born on October 23, 1941, to DiMaggio's first wife, Dorothy Arnold. DiMaggio, usually stoic, seemed to speak with joy at the arrival of his son. \"You ought to see the little fellow, he has the most perfect nose,\" DiMaggio explained. \"And I never saw such a pair of hands on a baby.\"\n\nAfter Joe Jr. was born, DiMaggio continued to spend many nights at his New York City hang-out, Toots Shor's. He lived a celebrity's life while his wife Dorothy wanted a husband for herself and a father for her son.\n\nThe result was conflict. In her divorce papers, Arnold said that she had hoped their son's birth would have made her husband \"realize his responsibilities as a married man\" but concluded that \"even the baby's arrival did not change him.\"\n\nLater, when DiMaggio was pictured with Marilyn Monroe in a newspaper in 1951, Arnold wanted full custody of Joe Jr. \"He's a little young for the smart set,\" Arnold said. The former husband and wife feuded for two years and ended up sharing custody.\n\nJoe Jr. lived with his father and Monroe after the two were married. She ended up being connected to her stepson for the rest of her life. Joe Jr. spoke with the starlet the night she died.\n\nDiMaggio didn't seem very interested in parenthood. Close by in New York in the 1950s, DiMaggio never attended one of his boy's football games while Joe Jr. was at New Jersey's prestigious Lawrenceville School. Joe Jr.'s ex-wife Sue said of his parents: \"When he was a little boy living with his mother in New York in the Waldorf, his only entertainment was riding up and down in the elevator. Then it was camps and military school and boarding school. They threw the man away.\"\n\nAs an adult, Joe Jr. held jobs, and some with responsibility, but he never kept them for long. He drifted away from his former wife, his two step-children by the marriage (he and his wife had no children together), and his grandchildren, and had less and less contact with them over time. Interestingly, Joe Sr. developed a close and continuing relationship with his son's ex-wife, and even called her children \"my grandchildren.\"\n\nAs the years passed, Joe Jr. seemed to live more and more marginally. Sometimes Joe DiMaggio senior would cruise the streets of Martinez, California looking for his son, as Joe Jr.'s address changed often. Sometimes the junior DiMaggio would take cash from his father; other times he would ignore him. When his father was gravely ill, Joe Jr. was asked why he didn't visit. \"You know, I never got the words, ‘Come now,' or I would've been there in a flash. When he wants me there, I'll be there.\"\n\nWhen his father died, Joe Jr. was living in a trailer and working in a junkyard. \"What is Joe DiMaggio's son supposed to do?\" he said. \"[I'm] free. . . just a free spirit. No commitments. The first of the month rolls around, and I have no payments to make.\" He had once put it another way: \"My lifestyle is diametrically opposed to my father's.\"\n\nJoe Jr. never received that final phone call from his father; there was no deathbed visit. Despite their estrangement, Joe Sr. left his son a $20,000-a-year trust fund. Joe Jr. barely had enough time to spend it, as he died on August 7, 1999, five months after his father's death."
