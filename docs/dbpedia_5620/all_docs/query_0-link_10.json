Filmmaker and director Roberto Angotti will on hand to introduce the film prior to the screening. Admission is free to SMU students and members of the general public. Due to Covid-19 and social distancing requirements, seating may be limited. Masks are strongly encouraged and requested for all attendees.\n\nItalian American Baseball Family tells the story of the Italian Americans’ role in baseball and in the culture of American sports. The movie documents an ethnic group’s rise from adversity and celebrates its triumphs in breaking into a game that was originally dominated by English, Irish and German immigrants. While some immigrants chose to change their names to mask their Italian identity, most felt the need to preserve and hold on to familiar things such as language, customs, and beliefs as a way of tolerating the discriminatory practices and injustices they encountered in America.\n\nChildren of immigrants felt stuck in the middle between protective parents who did not want the foreign ways of America to affect the close-knit Italian family, and their own desire to blend into the culture in which they were born. These children lived dual identities, conflicted by the rich Italian traditions of their parents inside their homes and the outside world which existed in the streets and in the schools, where they were taught to become American.\n\nThe solution to the stigma of being labeled as outsiders was to discover a way to become less different by assimilating into American culture. As a staple of mainstream American life, baseball presented Italians a viable point of entry as players and fans. By instilling the values of fair play, opportunity and democracy, baseball taught the children of immigrants how to become American.\n\nThe National Baseball Hall of Fame has recognized many Italian Americans including Tony Lazzeri, Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Ernie Lombardi, Phil Rizzuto, Tommy Lasorda, Ron Santo, Joe Torre, Tony La Russa, John Smoltz, Craig Biggio, and Mike Piazza. In fact, many Italian Americans like Hall of Famer and current Team Italy manager Mike Piazza and Italian American Baseball Foundation co-founder Frank Catalanotto have embraced their ancestral heritage in Italy by playing and coaching for Team Italy in the World Baseball Classic. Italian American Baseball Family also explores how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to help grow the game abroad. Italian American Baseball Family features interviews with Team Italy players Nick Punto, Francisco Cervelli, Brandon Nimmo, Chris Colabello, and Gavin Cecchini.

Produced by award-winning director Roberto Angotti, Introducing Team Italy Manager Mike Piazza highlights the celebrated career of National Baseball Hall of Famer Mike Piazza.\n\nThe film’s opening scene takes place at the 2020 CON6 Italian Baseball and Softball Convention in Rimini, Italy, where Mike Piazza briefly takes the stage before flashing back to Shea Stadium in New York for the first live sporting event post-9/11. Through the lyrics of his song “What a Come Back”, renowned musician Pato Banton collaborates with director Roberto Angotti to tell the story of how Mike Piazza’s heroic home run helped heal a shaken-up nation in fear. In the case of Mike Piazza, who has beaten the odds from being a last-round courtesy draft pick to becoming a National Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee, the opening song exemplifies the resilience and perseverance Mike Piazza and the American people possessed.\n\nNew York Mets play-by-play announcer Wayne Randazzo makes brief but poignant appearances throughout the 36-minute documentary to attest to Mike Piazza’s footprint in New York and sports history as well as validate the Hall of Famer’s commitment to the growth and development of Italian baseball. Using tidbits of information from Mike Piazza’s New York Times best-selling autobiography Long Shot, the film touches on young Mike’s childhood affinity for Spider-Man and his pregame ritual of eating Tastykake on the way to Philadelphia Phillies games at Veteran’s Stadium.\n\nNarrated by Pato Banton‘s song “No Worry Piazza,” the film retraces the path that Mike Piazza took growing up. A cameo appearance from longtime family friend and former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda confirms that Mike was overlooked as a prospect by major-league scouts at that time. The film traverses Piazza’s journey from high school baseball star to National Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee and on to his newest role as manager of the Italian national baseball team. Interview segments from former New York Mets pitcher and teammate John Franco as well as former MLB player and current Team Italy slugger Chris Colabello gauge the excitement around Mike as the new leader for Italian baseball.\n\nThe film revisits Mike Piazza’s call to the National Baseball Hall of Fame when he was selected as an inductee. With the backdrop of Pato Banton’s guitar-driven anthem “Never Give In Piazza,” viewers experience the determination and resilience of Mike Piazza firsthand. Making his way to Cooperstown, New York for the National Baseball Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Mike recognizes the roles that Tommy Lasorda and Reggie Smith played in his career. Piazza embraces the life lessons learned from these baseball legends, including to never give in and to never quit. Mike gives thanks to the country of Italy for giving him the gift of his father, whose unwavering faith in him served as an anchor. Then he honors his mother for giving him the gift of his Catholic faith. His parents formed the foundation upon which Mike grounded his career and life, and he brings that same foundation into his own marriage and family.\n\nUsing the classic “Niceness” rhythm, Pato Banton treats viewers to a new song entitled “Baseball Reggae,” an ode to the game and Italian family heritage Mike cherished with all his heart. It also pays tribute to the Italian baseball family of Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Ernie Lombardi, Tony Lazzeri, and Phil Rizzuto. The film reveals Mike’s Italian roots in Sciacca, Sicily, and he honors his family heritage by playing for Team Italy in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.\n\nIn the next song, “Go Mike Go”, Pato Banton personalizes the reggae classic and creates a fitting tribute to the leader of the Italian baseball revolution, Mike Piazza. From the first beat of the song when Citi Field comes alive as the site of the Mike Piazza Day celebration, viewers travel across the Atlantic mid-song and follow Mike Piazza to Italy. Then Mike Piazza speaks to the media for the first time from the Italian Olympic Committee headquarters in Rome after the official press conference announcing the new Team Italy manager took place.\n\nThe film also captures Mike Piazza being interviewed by the Italian press at the 2020 CON6 Baseball and Softball Coaches Convention in Rimini. Using Pato Banton‘s “My Opinion” rhythm as a soundtrack, Team Italy manager Mike Piazza and pitching coach Bill Holmberg talk to their players behind closed doors about what it will take for them to make the upcoming World Baseball Classic roster. Highlights from Team Italy in the 2013 and 2017 World Baseball Classic competitions are shown with Pato Banton‘s “Gwarn Piazza” in the background.\n\nMike Piazza and Bill Holmberg share their philosophy of developing players at all age levels and their ongoing commitment to growing the game of baseball in Italy with director Roberto Angotti. The film concludes with rare footage of the 2020 CON6 Coaches Convention where Mike is freely taking photos with fans and signing memorabilia. Ultimately, Introducing Team Italy Manager Mike Piazza shows how much the Hall of Fame catcher loves Italy and how Italy wholeheartedly embraces him.

IDEA Boston kicks off on Friday, November 1, 2019 at the Dante Alighieri Society of Massachusetts in Cambridge beginning at 12:40 pm with the “Beyond DiMaggio: The Influence of Italian American Players in Baseball” panel featuring two filmmakers focusing on similar subjects. Led by Roberto Angotti and Karen De Luca Stephens, this discussion will dive into the rich and sometimes obscure history of Italian American players in America’s favorite pastime. At a time when Italian immigrants were still seen with suspicion, Italian American players helped break barriers, forcing many to look beyond the stereotypes.\n\nRoberto Angotti is a cultural historian, writer, film director, curator, and radio DJ who blends his love of baseball, Italian American arts and culture, and music into multi-media creations. His film, Italian American Baseball Family, tells the story of how Italian Americans assimilated into popular culture through America’s favorite pastime, baseball, and how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to grow the game by playing for Team Italy in the Olympics and the World Baseball Classic.\n\nAt the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) 42nd Anniversary Gala in November 2017, the movie was screened and won the Russo Brothers Italian American Film Forum Award. Angotti is an official Team Italy media representative for Federazione Italiana Baseball Softball (FIBS), and he reports first-hand from international competitions such as the World Baseball Classic and the upcoming 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan: www.FIBS.it/en. He was first inspired to write about baseball in Italy and the USA, Italian American arts and culture, and music through his blog: http://www.MLBforLife.com.\n\nBorn into a Boston immigrant family, Karen De Luca Stephens lived in East Boston until her graduation from Northeastern University with a B.A. in philosophy. After receiving an M.A. in philosophy from the Johns Hopkins University she moved to Mexico City where she and her husband have recently founded the Tlacopac Artist Residency.

While a fellow she wrote a collection of short fiction and the screenplay for a feature film, Hitting Home. Based on the true story of a team of young boys from East Boston, Hitting Home is about the Italian immigrant experience during the Great Depression and the American dream that shaped a generation against the backdrop of our favorite pastime, baseball.\n\nSince I AM Books and IDEA Boston‘s goals include helping individuals understand the Italian American experience, bookstore co-founder and festival organizer Nicola Orichuia provided recommendations for those who would like an introduction to Italian American literature:\n\nAsk the Dust: A Novel, by John Fante (the book that Orichuia fell in love with as a teenager)\n\nThe Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian-American Women, edited by Helen Barolini\n\n“Really any book by Fred Gardaphé, who is at the Calandra Institute in New York.

Special guest writer, producer, and director Roberto Angotti will introduce the hour-long documentary and answer questions from the audience immediately following the Nevada premiere screening at the Windmill Library, 7060 West Windmill Lane in Las Vegas. Italian American Baseball Family features Lawrence Baldassaro, author of “Beyond DiMaggio: Italian Americans in Baseball” and “Baseball Italian Style”, as well as National Baseball Hall of Fame legend Tommy Lasorda and Major League Baseball (MLB) past and present players Frank Viola, Nick Punto, Francisco Cervelli, Chris Colabello, Brandon Nimmo, and Gavin Cecchini.\n\nItalian American Baseball Family tells the story of the Italian Americans’ role in baseball and in the culture of American sports. The movie documents an ethnic group’s rise from adversity and celebrates its triumphs in breaking into a game that was originally dominated by English, Irish and German immigrants. While some immigrants chose to change their names to mask their Italian identity, most felt the need to preserve and hold on to familiar things such as language, customs, and beliefs as a way of tolerating the discriminatory practices and injustices they encountered in America. Italians were once considered second class citizens in the United States and invisible in baseball before players like Tony Lazzeri and Joe DiMaggio rose to prominence.\n\nChildren of immigrants felt stuck in the middle between protective parents who did not want the foreign ways of America to affect the close-knit Italian family, and their own desire to blend into the culture in which they were born. These children lived dual identities, conflicted by the rich Italian traditions of their parents inside their homes and the outside world which existed in the streets and in the schools, where they were taught to become American.\n\nThe solution to the stigma of being labeled as outsiders was to discover a way to become less different by assimilating into American culture. As a staple of mainstream American life, baseball presented Italians a viable point of entry as players and fans. By instilling the values of fair play, opportunity and democracy, baseball taught the children of immigrants how to become American.\n\nAfter Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States declared war and began targeting those of German, Italian, or Japanese descent. The Italians were the largest immigrant group in the U.S. at the time and about 600,000 of the country’s five million Italian immigrants, who had not yet naturalized, were forced to register as enemy aliens. Italians were considered immigrants to America, and baseball was one way these people could counter the negative immigrant identity as an outsider. The game bridged the gap so that Italians could integrate into the American way of life.\n\nMany Italian Americans have participated in all aspects of baseball on the field, in coaching and team management, as broadcasters, and behind the scenes in administration as well. The National Baseball Hall of Fame has recognized many of them including Tony Lazzeri, Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Ernie Lombardi, Phil Rizzuto, Tommy Lasorda, Ron Santo, Joe Torre, Tony La Russa, John Smoltz, Craig Biggio, and Mike Piazza.\n\nNo one better epitomizes the culmination of the evolution of Italian American baseball or in American society than A. Bartlett Giamatti. He understood the nature and significance of the immigrant experience, and wrote about it as eloquently as he did about baseball. “Bart” Giamatti was the grandson of an immigrant laborer who became the president of Yale, then president of the National League before ascending to the office of commissioner of MLB. Italian American Baseball Family also explores how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to help grow the game abroad by playing for Team Italy in the Olympics and in the World Baseball Classic.\n\nAlthough brothers Vince, Joe, and Dom DiMaggio may be the premier Italian American Baseball Family, the Colabellos from Milford, Massachusetts are a perfect example of the modern day Italian American Baseball Family. As a father and son combination, both played professional baseball on the biggest international stages, which makes the Colabellos are a rare breed.\n\nFather Lou Colabello was the starting pitcher for Team Italy against host Team USA at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympics while his son Chris Colabello later played baseball in Italy as a youth and, like his father, eventually went on to represent Team Italy internationally After pitching for the University of Massachusetts in a College World Series, Lou Colabello played baseball professionally in Rimini, Italy. His experience as an international baseball ambassador culminated when he pitched for the Italians in the 1984 Olympics. Chris Colabello played for Team Italy in both the 2013 and 2017 World Baseball Classics, bookending major league stints with the Minnesota Twins and Toronto Blue Jays. Flmmaker Roberto Angotti was joined by Chris Colabello and his father, Lou Colabello, for the Boston-area premiere of Italian American Baseball Family last year.\n\nWith the new arrival of Oakland Athletics Triple-A affiliate Las Vegas Aviators, it would come as no surprise to see ballplayers of Italian descent landing at the Nevada premiere of Italian American Baseball Family at the Windmill Library in Las Vegas on Sunday, September 8, 2019 at 2 pm.
