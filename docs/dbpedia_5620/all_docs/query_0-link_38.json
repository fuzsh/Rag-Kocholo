        "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2024 announcement.\n\nAdrián Beltré? That was easy. Joe Mauer? That was complicated. Todd Helton and Billy Wagner? More historically significant than people seem to think. Chase Utley and Andruw Jones? I spent hours thinking about them.\n\nI wound up checking all of those names plus four others on my 2024 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot. This is the column where I reveal that ballot and explain why I cast it. You can express your heartfelt gratitude later.\n\nYou know, I don’t have to write this column. It stirs up way more negativity than I normally seek out in life. But I’ve always felt you deserve this explanation, whether you agree with every vote (ha ha … sure you do) or disagree vehemently (ha ha … I have a voice in my head reminding me the debate is the best part).\n\nI take my vote as seriously as anything I do in this job. I spend weeks on this process. I promise that whether you think I got this right or wrong, I put a ridiculous amount of thought into every player I voted for … or didn’t.\n\nWe’ll find out Tuesday whether Beltré is the only player headed for that stage in Cooperstown, N.Y., this July — or whether Mauer, Helton and/or Wagner will be keeping him company (along with Jim Leyland, elected last month, as a manager, by the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee). The announcement of those vote totals, cast by nearly 400 members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, is one of the coolest baseball days of the year.\n\nSo while we await those results, here’s my ballot — and an explanation of how I got there. Feel free to let me know what you think … as if that’s ever been a thing you’ve hesitated to do.\n\nThe 10 names I voted for\n\nI cast a vote for seven players last year. One (Scott Rolen) got elected. Another (Jeff Kent) ran out of years on the ballot. But it was such an interesting group this year, I wound up voting for 10. Let’s break down those 10, along with a few other notables, this way:\n\nFive holdovers from last year\n\nCarlos Beltrán\n\nTodd Helton\n\nJimmy Rollins\n\nGary Sheffield\n\nBilly Wagner\n\nThree first-timers\n\nAdrián Beltré\n\nJoe Mauer\n\nChase Utley\n\nOne first-timer in a slightly different category\n\nDavid Wright\n\nVoted for him this year, never had before\n\nAndruw Jones\n\nVoted for him in 2021, but not since\n\nOmar Vizquel\n\nCouldn’t quite get there\n\nBobby Abreu\n\nBartolo Colon\n\nMatt Holliday\n\nHow my Hall of Fame voting philosophy has evolved\n\nJust like the rest of you, I love a good old-fashioned magic number. Who the heck doesn’t? Hall of Fame voting used to be a lot easier when baseball was regularly supplying new members of the 3,000-hit, 500-homer and 300-win clubs. I miss those days.\n\nWhat happened to them anyway?\n\nBut as @notgaetti’s post on X astutely points out, we’re not just looking at this year with no citizens of those Magic Number Clubs. We’re looking at years and years and years of living in a very different time than we’ve experienced in pretty much any era since right after the end of World War 2. Which wasn’t exactly last week.\n\nSo here’s the deal: When baseball evolves, we as voters have to evolve with it. And I think my 2024 ballot serves as a telling example of how my voting philosophy has evolved.\n\nWhy Chase Utley? Why Andruw Jones? Why, to different degrees, Jimmy Rollins and even David Wright? Because more and more, I think the Hall of Fame needs to do more to celebrate players who:\n\nA) Had big, unmistakable peaks of greatness\n\nB) Had a clear impact on winning\n\nC) Had a period in their career where they were among the elite players at their position.\n\nI’ve thought a lot about this, but you know who else has? The great Bill James. As my friend Mark Simon details in the 2024 “Bill James Handbook: Walk-off Edition,” James was writing about this as far back as 1985, when he asked these questions (among others) about a player’s Hall of Fame qualifications:\n\n• Was he ever regarded as the best player in baseball?\n\n• Was he the best player on his team?\n\n• Was he the best player in baseball or in his league at his position?\n\n• Did he have an impact on a number of pennant races?\n\n• How many MVP-caliber seasons did he have?\n\n• How many All-Star type seasons did he have?\n\n• If he was the best player on his team, is it likely that team would win the pennant?\n\nThat’s not a complete list, but it sums up the essential questions I found myself asking about every player on this ballot whom I seriously considered.\n\nIt was a process that clearly put Utley over the line. It weighed heavily in my decisions to vote for Rollins and Wright. It helped me finally reach a place where I was comfortable voting for Jones, despite reservations I’ve expressed for years.\n\nSo it was awesome that Adrián Beltré showed up, to remind us of how we used to vote. But it’s time to get past those push-button, check-the-box, old-school counting numbers and figure out how to value players with dazzling peaks of greatness. Believe me, if we do that now, it will come in handy when players like Buster Posey reach this ballot down the road.\n\nBut first, let’s get to the one slam-dunk candidate in this group …\n\nAdrián Beltré\n\nIn November, when the names on this ballot were made public by the Hall, I posed a question I already knew the answer to: Could Adrián Beltré be the first unanimous position player in the history of Hall of Fame voting?\n\nI knew that wouldn’t happen, because for reasons we don’t need to spend even 12 words on, that never happens. But I also asked a related question:\n\nWhat reason could any voter possibly have to not vote for a man with 3,166 hits, 477 homers, over 1,100 extra-base hits, five Gold Glove awards and the third-most wins above replacement (93.5, according to Baseball Reference) of any third baseman in history?\n\nThere are all kinds of ways to paint a picture of the off-the-charts greatness of Beltré. Here are just a few:\n\nTHE 3,000-HIT, 5-GOLD GLOVE CLUB\n\nWillie Mays\n\nRoberto Clemente\n\nDerek Jeter\n\nTony Gwynn\n\nIchiro Suzuki\n\nCarl Yastrzemski\n\nAl Kaline\n\nDave Winfield\n\nAnd …\n\nAdrián Beltré\n\nINFIELDERS IN THAT CLUB\n\nAdrián Beltré\n\nDerek Jeter\n\nHeard of those guys? Thought so! Or there’s this list, based on Baseball Reference’s calculations of most career Fielding Runs Above Average. (Beltré ranks second in this category among all third basemen in history, incidentally, behind only Brooks Robinson.)\n\nThat’ll do it for that list!\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow Adrian Beltre's 'pillow contract' year in Boston put him on a Hall of Fame trajectory\n\nOr we could look at Beltré’s power/defense package. We’ll even lower our defensive bar to include players with at least 100 Fielding Runs Above Average. And it’s still quite the list.\n\n100+ FIELDING RUNS, 1,100+ EXTRA-BASE HITS\n\nWillie Mays\n\nCarl Yastrzemski\n\nBarry Bonds\n\nAlbert Pujols\n\nAnd …\n\nAdrián Beltré\n\nAny more questions? No? Cool. Let’s move on to …\n\nJoe Mauer\n\nIs Joe Mauer an easy Hall of Famer? I’ve thought about that question for almost two months. And even though I had no reservations about voting for him, I also think “easy” isn’t the right word.\n\nI feel as though some voters are so fixated on the way his career ended, as just a league-average first baseman, that they went into this process looking for reasons not to check his name. And those reasons are out there, thanks to the concussions that changed the arc of his career and redirected him to first base.\n\nSo I know this is tricky. But as I wrote in November, I think the way to look at Mauer is as a modern-day Ernie Banks.\n\nIn the first half of Banks’ career, he was a historically great offensive player at a defense-first position (shortstop). In the back half of his career, he was a first baseman who didn’t hit much at a classic offense-first position. Sound familiar? Here’s how he compares to Mauer, based on their OPS+ breakdown:\n\n(Source: Baseball Reference)\n\nIs it OK if I mention here that Banks cruised into Cooperstown on the first ballot? Thank you. I think that’s telling us something. But let’s think more about Mauer.\n\nThe longer I reflected on him, the more it felt as though — if we’re really debating whether this man was a Hall of Famer — he was actually underrated. Here’s how:\n\nAs one of the best hitting catchers ever — How many catchers who ever lived had a 10-year stretch with three batting titles and a slash line that was in Mauer’s 2004-13 neighborhood (.323/.405/.469/.873)? That answer, obviously, is none.\n\nAs the best catcher, period, of his generation — Here’s where Mauer ranked in WAR in his 10 seasons as his team’s primary catcher, versus every other catcher who was active in all 10 of those seasons. It wasn’t close!\n\nMauer — 44.6\n\nVictor Martinez — 28.1\n\nYadier Molina — 27.6\n\nJorge Posada — 20.0\n\nAs one of the greatest No. 1 picks ever — He was a hometown kid, picked first by the Twins in the 2001 MLB Draft — and never spent one day playing for any other team. You know how many No. 1 overall picks spent their whole career with one team while playing at least 500 games in the big leagues? Exactly two:\n\nChipper Jones — 2,499 games (Braves)\n\nJoe Mauer — 1,858 games (Twins)\n\nBut also …\n\n• You know how many No. 1 picks finished their career with a .300 average? Just Mauer and Chipper.\n\n• And how many rolled up at least 55 WAR, no matter how many teams they played for? It’s just Mauer, Chipper, Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr.\n\n• How many won an MVP Award for the team that drafted them? Only Mauer, Chipper, Griffey, A-Rod and Bryce Harper.\n\n• And how many won a batting title? How about this: Mauer won more of them (three) than all the other No. 1 overall picks in history combined (two — by A-Rod and Josh Hamilton).\n\nI know the Twins never won a postseason series in Mauer’s career. But he did get to the postseason four times. And the Yankees, the team they drew in three of those years, were his team’s eternal, dream-crushing Kryptonite. So as I ripped through those Bill James questions I posed earlier, this verdict was clear — and not just to me.\n\nBilly Wagner\n\nThere is one question I ask about every candidate before anything else: Can I make a case that this player has some kind of claim to historic greatness?\n\nI’ve been looking at Billy Wagner’s case for nine election cycles now. Unless your view of closers is that’s not a real position, there is no rational argument this guy doesn’t have one of those cases.\n\nI keep rolling out the same chart to make that case, year after year. No reason not to sing those hits again. They’re as everlasting as they ever were.\n\n(*minimum 900 innings pitched)\n\n(Source: Baseball Reference / Stathead)\n\nSo … is that historically significant enough for you? But hold on. There’s one more hit we have to play. It comes from one of Wagner’s biggest proponents, Austin Eich. He seems to have this wacky idea that Wagner was pretty close to as unhittable as any reliever we’ve ever laid eyes on. And yeah, that includes that reliever you’re probably thinking of.\n\nSo that about covers it! Except even after a 2023 election in which Wagner came up just 27 votes short, there is still one reason a big segment of onetime Mariano voters can’t bring themselves to vote for this guy: October.\n\nI get it. It’s hard to make an argument that a closer who had a 10.03 career postseason ERA deserves the benefit of the doubt. But let me offer a mild counter-argument all the same.\n\nIn 16 seasons in the big leagues, you know how many postseason save opportunities Wagner’s teams handed him? How about four. (He blew only one of them by the way — the first one.) Mariano was handed 47 of those save opportunities.\n\nIn 16 seasons in the big leagues, you know how many hitters Wagner got to face with a lead in the postseason? How about 30 — in a decade and a half. Mariano faced over 400.\n\nSo all I’m saying is that the postseason sample was way too small. It matters. But let’s get back to that first question I asked: Was Billy Wagner’s overall body of work — which tells us he was basically the most dominant left-handed reliever of all time — historically significant enough to outweigh his October misadventures? I’m going with yes. We’ll find out next week whether there are 300 voters who agree with me.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow a broken arm — and an unbroken spirit — took Billy Wagner to the doorstep of the Hall\n\nTodd Helton\n\nIf Todd Helton had spent his career playing literally anywhere else — Fenway, Cincinnati’s Great American Small Park, the Bank (in Philly), the moon (in orbit) — he would already be a Hall of Famer. Would we even need to post a social media poll on that?\n\nAs I wrote in November, Helton spent 17 seasons in Colorado compiling a spectacular .316/.414/.539/.953 slash line. Now here comes the complete rundown of all hitters whose careers began since 1930 who can beat that:\n\nTed Williams\n\nStan Musial\n\nWe’re done here\n\nToss in Helton’s three Gold Gloves, his back-to-back seasons with 100 extra-base hits, his five All-Star appearances in a row and his Face of the Franchise bonus points and this man could have stampeded into the Hall on the first ballot. Instead, it’s his sixth spin on this Cooperstown wheel, and though he needs to add only another dozen votes from last year, it still looks like this is going to be extremely close.\n\nSo why is that, you might ask (if you’d never visited the scenic Rocky Mountains)? It’s the same old one-word answer, of course:\n\nCoors.\n\nI thought Larry Walker had fought the Battle of Coors and planted that flag four years ago. Helton has added more than 200 votes in those past four years, so it seemed logical. But the hard-core Coors Field skeptics are tough to budge. So every year, I look for ways to put Helton’s home/road splits in perspective for them.\n\nWe live in a beautiful age, where all sorts of tools allow us to account for Coors or any other home park. Park-adjusted OPS+ is one of those tools. And over Helton’s staggering 10-year peak (1998-2007), he had a 144 OPS+. How impressive is that, especially considering that it adjusts for the Coors Factor?\n\nWell, Gil Hodges is a Hall of Fame first baseman. He never even had one season with a 144 OPS+. Todd Helton did that for a whole decade.\n\nWAR is another measure that takes in everything that happens on a baseball field. Helton’s 54.9 bWAR in those peak years tied him with Chipper Jones for fourth-best in the sport. Only A-Rod, Barry Bonds and Andruw Jones were ahead of them.\n\nOr suppose we just peruse Baseball Reference’s Offensive WAR leaderboard over that span. Only three names are ahead of Helton: Derek Jeter, Chipper and Vladimir Guerrero — all proud Cooperstown plaque holders.\n\nBut if that doesn’t do it, what if we look only at road splits during Helton’s peak? In those 10 seasons, he had a slash line of .296/.395/.504/.899 away from Coors — with more walks than strikeouts. If we zoom in on men who played in all 10 of those seasons and filter out guys stained by performance-enhancing drugs, that’s a road slash line matched only by Chipper and the embarrassingly underrated Lance Berkman. And that’s it.\n\nSo does that portray a player whose numbers look attractive only because Coors Field pumped them with helium? It doesn’t for me. But what do I know? I’ve only been voting for the Hall of Fame since before they even built Coors Field.\n\nChase Utley\n\nI’ll be open about this. When Chase Utley retired in 2018, I didn’t think I would end up voting for him.\n\nOnly 1,885 hits? There was no precedent, in my time as a voter, for a player with under 1,900 hits being a Hall of Famer. So it didn’t matter that, as a Philadelphian, I’d seen his entire career up close.\n\nI’d seen The Utley Play that saved the 2008 World Series for the Phillies. … I’d seen the five World Series homers he launched in 2009. … I’d seen the relentless intensity he’d brought to every inning of every game he ever played in. … I’d seen the toughness that drove him to absorb 204 hit-by-pitches pretty much on purpose, and that fueled him to ignore a slew of doctors in 2011 who told him he needed microfracture knee surgery.\n\nI admired all of that and everything that made him special. But I had a different set of voting standards then — still locked in on counting numbers that were about to grow less relevant every year.\n\nWhich brings us to how I’ve begun to shift my priorities when I cast Hall votes. You can re-read the explanation of that above. But if I’m now more focused on players with breathtaking peaks, who practically willed their teams to win, who often felt like the best player on the field when you watched them, who might have won multiple MVP trophies if they’d played in a more analytically aware age … then how could I not vote for Chase Utley?\n\nHow spectacular was his peak? On Baseball Reference’s breakdown of this year’s Hall of Fame ballot there is a metric called “WAR7.” It adds up each player’s seven best seasons. Here is how everyone on this ballot ranks in WAR7:\n\nAlex Rodriguez — 64.3\n\nChase Utley — 49.3\n\nAdrián Beltré — 48.7\n\nTodd Helton — 46.6\n\nYes, Utley’s peak was bigger and more valuable than the peak of any other player on this ballot, except for A-Rod, whose two-time PED offenses are going to keep him miles away from the Hall for a third straight election. Utley’s ranking in that category jumped off the computer screen.\n\nYou should also know that among retired second basemen who played their entire careers in the live-ball era (since 1920), only Joe Morgan, Jackie Robinson and Rod Carew had a bigger peak than Utley. That also told me something. So the only other question was …\n\nHow long was Utley’s peak? How deep was the impact of Utley’s first 10 seasons as a full-time player, from 2005-14? Check out Baseball Reference’s WAR leaders from those 10 seasons:\n\nAlbert Pujols — 67.7\n\nChase Utley — 59.7\n\nMiguel Cabrera — 55.8\n\nBut this is where I need to step in and say: That’s misleading. Utley’s peak, in truth, did not last for 10 years. It was really six years, from 2005-10. After that, he learned the consequences of life as a kamikaze second baseman whose goal was to be oblivious to pain as long as it led to winning.\n\nThe hip. The knee. The legs. They were never quite the same after those six special seasons. So after that six-year span of averaging 7.6 WAR per season, he averaged just 2.6 WAR a season over the next six years. Hey, it happens. But let’s not lose sight of what those first six full seasons, at that level of greatness, represented — especially at second base.\n\nMost seasons, 7.0+ WAR, by 2B in live-ball era\n\nRogers Hornsby* —\n\n8\n\nChase Utley — 5\n\nJoe Morgan* — 5\n\nCharlie Gehringer* — 5\n\n* Hall of Famer\n\n(Source: Baseball Reference)\n\nBut now let’s add in one last critical element:\n\nIf Utley was on your team, you were going to win! Have you ever heard other players talk about this dude? They were in awe of him. They were a little afraid of him. And if they played with him, they were elevated by everything about him.\n\nIn a column looking back at The Utley Play 10 years after that 2008 World Series, here is how Jayson Werth described the man who made it:\n\n“He’s just got a master plan up there in his brain, always,” Werth said. “And that’s why, in my mind, he’s the best — the best player of his generation. Yeah, he’s had some injuries. And as he’s gotten older, some of those injuries have hit him a little harder. But mentally, and preparation-wise, he’s it. If anyone ever asks me, ‘Who’s the best player you played with?’ I mean, not to take anything away from the many other great players I played with. But he’s an easy choice.”\n\nUtley was the fireball that propelled one of baseball’s most dominant teams in his era — the 2007-11 Phillies, who won a World Series, won their division five years in a row and averaged eight more wins per season than any other team in their league. Then, from 2015-18, the Dodgers kept him around for another three-plus seasons because he was such a powerful force (mostly off the field) in their quest to propel their franchise to another stratosphere.\n\nThat was Chase Utley. He felt like a Hall of Famer when you watched him. And his peak was the stuff Hall of Famers were made of.\n\nSo when his name finally showed up on the ballot, he didn’t merely pass the Bill James test. He passed mine.\n\nJimmy Rollins\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m not allowed, by the proper authorities in my town, to discuss Utley’s Hall of Fame case without talking about the case of his longtime double-play accomplice, Jimmy Rollins. So let’s do that.\n\nDid you know that no double-play combination in history played more games together — and then appeared on a Hall of Fame ballot together — than Utley and Rollins? My friends from STATS Perform did the math.\n\n(Source: STATS Perform)\n\nUtley and Rollins were the twin-cam engine that drove those 2007-11 Phillies. And they both have compelling, though very different, Hall of Fame cases. But so far, via Ryan Thibodaux’s Hall of Fame vote tracker, Utley is in a different vote galaxy than Rollins, 44 percent to 13 percent. And I understand that.\n\nBut the funny thing is, it’s Rollins who comes way, way closer to rolling out the array of traditional Hall of Fame-caliber counting numbers than Utley does. Yet we’re learning, just from his low vote total, that these voters don’t seem to think that way anymore.\n\nNevertheless, I feel compelled to remind people that, as I’ve written many times before, no other shortstop who ever lived had Jimmy Rollins’ career. No one. Because he …\n\nWon an MVP and four Gold Gloves. … Had more than 2,400 hits and topped 200 homers, 400 steals and 800 extra-base hits. … Got the most hits in the history of his franchise (the Phillies). … Had the longest hitting streak by a shortstop (38 games) since 1894. … And maybe most underappreciated of all, he was always out there — averaging 149 games played a year over 13 seasons (2001-13) at shortstop.\n\nThen there’s all the winning those Phillies teams of his did. He was The Energizer on those teams. And he was a vital force for positivity: “When I start feeling nervous,” one of his coaches once told me, “all I have to do is look at Jimmy and I think we’re gonna win.”\n\nAnd he was an uplifting presence in a way that Utley wasn’t: “When Chase walked in the room, it made everyone sit up straight,” one of their teammates told me recently. “But when Jimmy walked in the room, it made everyone smile.”\n\nSo what’s missing from Rollins’ case? It’s the right set of data in an increasingly analytic-driven age of voting. But his former teammates have told me that the data doesn’t match their perception as they watched Rollins play baseball.\n\nWas Utley really a better, more impactful up-the-middle defender than Rollins? The data says yes. The pitchers who were part of those Phillies teams say no way. If they could have the ball hit to one guy on the field in a big moment, they’d have voted unanimously for Rollins, one of them told me recently. I’m not sure why the numbers undervalue his dependability and genius-level defensive I.Q. But his teammates didn’t undervalue it.\n\nI’ve watched a lot of baseball games in my life. So I’m allowed to vote using a combination of the information I care deeply about and the in-person evidence of greatness I’ve seen with my eyeballs. So why did I vote for Jimmy Rollins? That’s why.\n\nDavid Wright\n\nIs David Wright, longtime Face of the 21st-century Mets, a clear-cut runaway Hall of Famer? Before you start firing off those comments, you should know I understand that answer is a resounding: No!\n\nSo let me explain why I voted for him in his debut appearance on this ballot. Because I think we need time to figure out where Wright fits in the age of Impactful Peak voting. And here’s one lesson I’ve learned the hard way in my time as a voter:\n\nYou can’t rethink your perspective on any player in Year 2 if he doesn’t survive Year 1!\n\nSo why did I vote for this man? Because I’ve seen too many great players turn into awful one-and-dones who get booted off the writers’ ballot after one year. So I’ve decided that if the Hall is going to continue to impose rules that limit how many players we can vote for to 10 and oust anyone who fails to get 5 percent of the vote, then I can strategize too.\n\nI reserve the right to cast a vote every once in a while that’s designed to keep a player from falling off the ballot. And this is one of those votes. From the early voting returns we’ve seen thus far, Wright needs all the votes he can muster.\n\nI wrote more about this in November. But the other reason Wright deserves a longer look is that, after his first 10 seasons, he was on an unmistakable Hall of Fame path. Then injuries — and the rest of his career — happened. But check out those first 10 seasons again:\n\n.301/.382/.506/.888 slash line\n\n222 HR, 183 SB\n\n137 OPS+\n\n46.5 bWAR\n\nNow, just for perspective, here are the only players, whose careers began in the 2000s, who amassed that many wins above replacement and had that good an OPS+ in their first 10 seasons, according to Baseball Reference (excluding PED-tainted players):\n\nAlbert Pujols\n\nMike Trout\n\nMookie Betts\n\nJoey Votto\n\nMiguel Cabrera\n\nAnd …\n\nDavid Wright\n\nBesides that group, there are only 16 other players whose careers began in the expansion era (1961-present) who had 10 seasons like that to begin their careers. If we toss out the PED crowd, only two of them are not in the Hall of Fame: Dick Allen and Todd Helton. And that could change, in both cases.\n\nI don’t know if David Wright is headed for that podium in Cooperstown someday or not. I just know he deserves a chance for all of us to think about that question for more than one voting cycle.\n\nAndruw Jones\n\nIt took me seven elections, but the Andruw Jones Fan Club can finally get off my case. I did it. I voted for your guy. Feel free to buy me a beverage next time I hang out in the Battery.\n\nI’ve spent so many hours thinking about this man over the past seven election cycles — and this one, too. I won’t miss all that angst.\n\nBut I’ll admit this: I still have all those reservations that stopped me in the past — about the cliff Jones’ career crashed over at age 30 … about whether he really deserved all those Gold Gloves … about a .254 career batting average that would be the worst of any outfielder in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThat stuff gnawed at me right up until I checked his name — which was the last thing I did before I folded my ballot and sealed the envelope. This man held up my vote for days. And not for the first time.\n\nSo what finally got me over that line that had always stopped me from voting for him? I’m too logical! Hey, how many times have I mentioned I have a different process now? So if I was going to vote for Utley (64.5 WAR and 1,885 hits) and Wright (49.2 WAR and 1,777 hits) based on their peaks, I had to vote for Jones too (62.7 WAR and 1,933 hits). Logic!\n\nLook, I always said I loved watching the young Andruw Jones run down every fly ball from the left-center-field gap to downtown Savannah. I’ve never seen a better center fielder in my life than Young Andruw. That’s just a fact.\n\nHe definitely wasn’t That Guy anymore in his 30s — and, candidly, not even in his late 20s. But if I’m gravitating toward being a voter who honors players with great peaks and tangible impacts on winning, then his peak was enough to change my vote.\n\nMOST OUTFIELD GOLD GLOVES FOR PLAYOFF TEAMS\n\nAndruw Jones — 8\n\nTorii Hunter — 6\n\nGarry Maddox — 6\n\nCarlos Beltrán\n\nWhat a difference a year makes, huh? Last year, Carlos Beltrán was the first name on my ballot to come up in this column. This year, he’s the ninth.\n\nLast year, in his debut on the ballot, we couldn’t stop arguing about whether sign-stealing and PED cheating were equally nefarious crimes. A year later, isn’t it amazing how little time we’ve spent this winter debating whether the Astros’ dastardly sign-stealing capers should keep Beltrán out of Cooperstown for life?\n\nIs that because Beltrán got 46.5 percent of the vote last year — a level no PED pariah ever came close to in his first year on the ballot? Or do we all just have short attention spans? Let’s go with that first option, since we can see that’s the right choice.\n\nAccording to Thibodaux’s Hall of Fame tracker, there isn’t a player on this ballot who has picked up more new votes than Beltrán (plus-16). So he’s gathering steam. And when you dig in on the tremendous career he had, it’s not hard to see why.\n\nHe was a 70-win player — You know what we call 70-win center fielders? Hall of Famers! Baseball Reference calculates Beltrán’s career WAR at 70.1. You know how many other 70-win center fielders are not in the Hall of Fame? If you guessed none, you’re catching on.\n\nHe was good at baseball — We usually ask what part of baseball a player was really good at. Wrong question on this guy. It was more like: What part of baseball wasn’t he good at? Because Carlos Beltrán was pretty much great at everything.\n\nCheck out this list of every outfielder since 1900 whom the metrics tell us was worth at least 250 Batting Runs Above Average, 40 Baserunning Runs Above Average and 25 Fielding Runs Above Average:\n\nWillie Mays\n\nRickey Henderson\n\nJoe DiMaggio\n\nHenry Aaron\n\nBarry Bonds\n\nLarry Walker\n\nCarlos Beltrán\n\n(Source: Baseball Reference)\n\nHow many Hall of Famers are on that list? All of them — except Carlos Beltrán.\n\nHe owned October — Ever checked Beltrán’s postseason numbers? They’re pretty freaking scenic: A .307/.412/.609 slash line? With 16 homers and 11 steals (in 11 tries)? Crazy.\n\nHere’s the .300/.400/.600 Club among players who made it into at least 40 postseason games: Beltrán and Babe Ruth!\n\nHe was one of the best switch hitters ever — We now present all the switch hitters in history with as many hits (2,725), as many homers (435) and as good a career OPS+ (119) as Beltrán: Chipper Jones and Eddie Murray. Related development: You can say hello to Chipper and Eddie every July in Cooperstown.\n\nOh, and also … Beltrán is one of only five members of the 300-Steal/400-Homer Club … and a guy who made nine All-Star teams. … He won a Rookie of the Year Award at age 22 and was still an All-Star at age 39. … He won three Gold Gloves. … And if we give extra points to players who made an impact on winning, that seals this case. Beltrán made trips to the postseason with five different teams, then had historic Octobers with almost all of them.\n\nSo maybe some voters are still fixated on trash-can lids. But for everyone who’s over it, this is what a Hall of Famer looks like.\n\nGary Sheffield\n\nAnd finally, one more vote that was a long time coming. It’s Gary Sheffield’s 10th and final year on this ballot. I didn’t vote for him until Year 8!\n\nI never disputed that this was one fearsome dude when he wriggled into that batter’s box. I just had to work past the idea that I was voting for possibly the worst defensive outfielder in history. Or that I was voting for a guy who could be so high-maintenance, he bulldozed his way through eight teams, with many uncomfortable trips down those exit ramps.\n\nThen there was his mysterious BALCO/Barry Bonds episode, which has never been fully explained. Does anyone know what the heck we should make of that?\n\nBut I came around, all because I knew what to make of the Gary Sheffield who stomped toward home plate, waggled that bat and went to work. It was something to see. Unless you were a pitcher.\n\nHow about this career:\n\n509 HR\n\n2,689 Hits\n\n.292/.393/.514/.907 slash line\n\nNow here’s everyone in history who had that career:\n\nBabe Ruth\n\nTed Williams\n\nJimmie Foxx\n\nMel Ott\n\nBarry Bonds\n\nGary Sheffield\n\nSo if it’s historic greatness I’m looking for, the conversation ends there. This was a Hall of Fame offensive monster when he arrived at home plate. I just had to accept that I had too little feel for the whole BALCO mess to use that as The Reason not to vote for this guy. So this year, one last time, I checked his name.\n\nSorry, I couldn’t get there\n\nBARTOLO COLON —\n\nThe good news: 247 wins … one Cy Young Award … and the most entertaining home run ever launched.\n\nThe bad news: A 4.12 career ERA … only four qualifying seasons (in two decades) with an ERA under 3.50 … a grand tour of 11 teams … and one unfortunate PED suspension.\n\nSo hey, I loved Bartolo. It just wasn’t Hall of Fame kind of love.\n\nMATT HOLLIDAY — I came very close to casting a keep-him-on-ballot vote for Matt Holliday, too, just as I did with David Wright. But the more I looked at Holliday’s Hall of Fame case, the more I understood that vote wasn’t going to be enough.\n\nThis man had a wonderful career. There was that incredible 50-double, batting-title, MVP runner-up season in Colorado in 2007. And there was an excellent second act in St. Louis, where he won a World Series and reached the postseason six times.\n\nAlas, there weren’t quite enough big offensive seasons outside of Colorado to get Holliday over that Hall of Fame threshold. But as I’ve said many times, it’s never an insult to say that any player was not quite a Hall of Famer. That still means he was one of the greatest players who ever lived.\n\nBOBBY ABREU — Have I mentioned lately that it’s never an insult to say that any player was not quite a Hall of Famer? So I tip my cap to Bobby Abreu’s on-base skills. He could work a walk. He could shoot one up any gap. He could steal a base.\n\nBut you know what I can’t get out of my head? In July 2006, one of the sharpest general managers in history, Pat Gillick, traded Abreu from the Phillies to the Yankees, essentially for a bag of New York bagels. Why? For the clear purpose of getting him out of the way so Chase Utley and Jimmy Rollins could take over his clubhouse and get the winning started.\n\nWas Gillick trying to tell us something about Bobby Abreu? Sure seemed like it!\n\nOMAR VIZQUEL — As I wrote last year, I used to be a booster of Vizquel’s Hall of Fame worthiness. Sorry. I’m out. The allegations of domestic violence and sexual harassment against him are too disturbing. And as I’ve written before, the character clause means we’re being irresponsible if we overlook them.\n\nMANNY AND A-ROD — Finally, I can’t write a Hall of Fame column without mentioning these two guys! Like a lot of voters, I draw a line between baseball’s pre-testing PED era and the post-testing era. Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez fall on the wrong side of it. They’re two-time offenders, and that’s two times too many, no matter how insanely talented they were at hitting a baseball.\n\nDo I really need to waste any more valuable typing time on why I vote this way? If you think that answer is yes, I devoted way too much valuable typing time to this topic in another life.\n\nHall of Fame ballot columns from The Athletic\n\n• Rosenthal: Why Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley are both on my Hall of Fame ballot\n\n• Kepner: Explaining my Hall of Fame ballot — a celebration of greatness\n\n• Nine more The Athletic staffers reveal their Hall ballots\n\nMore Hall of Fame coverage\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nA distinguished dozen: Saluting the 12 newcomers to the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot\n\nGO DEEPER\n\n2024 Baseball Hall of Fame reader survey results: Which players — if any — did you elect?\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nJim Leyland, Hall of Fame manager: 4 things we learned from the Contemporary Era election\n\n(Top photo of Adrian Beltre and Joe Mauer in 2018: Brace Hemmelgarn / Minnesota Twins / Getty Images)"
