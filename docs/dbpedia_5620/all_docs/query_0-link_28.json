        "text": "When Wade Boggs met John Schuerholz on a party bus during the 2017 Hall of Fame Induction Weekend, he marveled at the ability of the Atlanta Braves to get players enshrined.\n\n“They’re going to need a whole new wing just for your team,” Boggs said to Schuerholz. “That’s okay with me, Wade,” said the long-time GM, whose team won a record 14 straight division titles during his tenure.\n\nSix Braves from those teams have reached the Cooperstown gallery in the past five years, with a half-dozen more hoping to follow.\n\nBut election requires 75 per cent of the vote – and reaching that pinnacle is a tougher task than graduating from the Electoral College at the top of the class.\n\nTotals are invariably skewed by writers who fail to fill out all 10 slots on their ballots, forcing some of the game’s biggest legends to endure unexpectedly long waits. Such incomplete ballots would be disqualified in the voting for Most Valuable Player but not in the Hall of Fame balloting.\n\nSuperstar pitchers Carl Hubbell, Lefty Grove, and Grover Cleveland Alexander finally got in on their third attempt. Joe DiMaggio needed four, Rogers Hornsby five, Hank Greenberg nine, and\n\nDuke Snider 11. Neither Gil Hodges, who had the most RBI during the ‘50s, nor Dale Murphy, a two-time MVP who had the most total bases in the ‘80s, found their way in.\n\nSince only 1 per cent of everyone associated with major-league baseball ever gets a plaque in Cooperstown, electing six men in five years was such a feather in the cap for the Braves.\n\nPitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, along with manager Bobby Cox, were among the six-member Class of 2014. One year later, starter-reliever John Smoltz joined them. Then it was general manager John Schuerholz, architect of Atlanta’s 14-year title run, in 2015 and finally Chipper Jones, face of the franchise between Murphy and Freddie Freeman, three years later.\n\nMaddux, Glavine, Smoltz, and Jones were all selected on the first ballot, while Cox and Schuerholz was named by the Veterans Committee.\n\nLike most Braves fans, Schuerholz believes Chipper’s 2018 induction will not be the last from the Teams of the Streak.\n\nFred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, and Andruw Jones remain on the writers ballot while Leo Mazzone and Dale Murphy could be chosen by one of the three Veterans Committee that makes selections on a rotating annual basis. Also on the ballot this year is Billy Wagner, a flame-throwing lefthanded closer who concluded his career in Atlanta.\n\nAccording to Schuerholz, who watched them every day, “Andruw Jones was the best centerfielder in baseball for 10 straight years. To have those skills and tools and to use them to help your team win for 10 years (is pretty impressive). He was the best combination offensive and defensive centerfielder in the game for more than a decade. He played a few extra years that probably deterred some of the voters but if they measured him on the pinnacle of those 10 years, he had a remarkable decade. I think many will look at him as a worthy candidate.\n\n“As for McGriff, if you look at the totality of his career, the consistency of production, his character, and his contributions to the game, there’s nobody that presents those assets better than Fred McGriff has.”\n\nMcGriff remains the classic case of a Hall of Fame wannabe: he just missed 500 home runs, didn’t reach 3,000 hits, and never won an MVP award. But he had as many home runs (493) as Lou Gehrig, ranks in the Top 50 in career runs batted in, and was a feared and dangerous clutch hitter. One well-known authority, Joe Posnanski of MLB.com, wrote on Jan. 16, 2018, “The Hall of Fame would be better with the Crime Dog in it.”\n\nBoth McGriff and Sheffield, unlike Jones and Mazzone, had relatively short tenures in Atlanta. McGriff played parts of five seasons for the Braves and was a key cog in the 1995 World Championship team. While playing for eight teams in 22 seasons, Sheffield surfaced in Atlanta for just two years – both during the streak – but was there long enough to set a single-season club record for runs batted in (132 in 2003).\n\nTwo years later, Andruw Jones hit a club-record 51 home runs, fell just four short of Sheffield’s RBI mark, and played the best center field since Willie Mays. Maybe even better, according to Bobby Cox and several others who saw him every day.\n\nIn the field, Jones operated on instinct; he would start running for the ball before it was pitched. He had the range for center, the arm for right, and the speed to cover more territory than the Manifest Destiny. After stealing 56 bases in one minor-league season, he topped 20 in each of his first four big-league campaigns.\n\nWith Ozzie Smith, Luis Aparicio, Bill Mazeroski, and other glovemen already ensconced in Cooperstown and a current boomlet for slick-fielding shortstop Omar Vizquel, there should be room for Andruw too – especially since he also provided power (434 home runs in 17 seasons). Only five outfielders took at least 10 Gold Gloves, with Mays and Roberto Clemente at the top of the list with 12. Mays and Clemente won theirs in succession while three others, Jones included, won 10 in a row (along with Ken Griffey, Jr. and Ichiro Suzuki).\n\nThe rare blend of power plus defense was the reason New York Post baseball writer Ken Davidoff placed Andruw third on his Hall of Fame ballot last year, the first time Jones became eligible. “He played at a high level for just 11 years and much of his value came from his phenomenal center field defense that would pass any eye test and gets substantiated by the analytics,” Davidoff wrote.\n\nThe writer complained that 10 ballot spots and a 10-year tenure on the ballot (down from 15) were too limiting. His 2018 ballot included both Chipper and Andruw Jones but not Vladimir Guerrero, who was chosen anyway, or Sheffield, whom he also labeled a Hall of Famer.\n\nOn the surface, Sheffield’s .292 lifetime batting average, 509 home runs, nine All-Star appearances, and three strong runs at MVP awards all seem Hall-worthy. But his defensive metrics, both as an infielder and later as a outfielder, were shaky – making him almost the opposite of Andruw Jones, a gifted fielder but career .254 batter, in the eyes of some voters.\n\nPlaying for eight different teams, and running into contoversy at more than one stop, also hurts Sheffield, while McGriff’s nomadic career (six teams in 19 seasons) might also make voters hesitate. But Braves fans see it differently.\n\nThey also believe Mazzone should be the first coach to crack the Hall of Fame gallery. One of three Braves, along with Cox and Smoltz, to wear Braves colors throughout the 14-year streak, Mazzone was responsible not only for Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz but also for a raft of lesser pitchers plucked off the proverbial scrap heap and resurrected by the fast-talking coach. Almost all of those pitchers, from Russ Ortiz to Jaret Wright, did far better under Mazzone than they did before they arrived or after they left.\n\nAsk Mazzone and he’ll say that Johnny Sain, another ex-Brave, deserves to be the first coach in Cooperstown. Outspoken, opinionated, and set in his ways, Mazzone mirrors the personality of Sain, whose penchant for producing 20-game winners was offset by a fiercely independent streak that ruffled multiple managers. Whether their Old School approach would thrive in an age of analytics is subject to conjecture. But nobody can argue with their record.\n\nWhen Mazzone met Sain, he was cooking TV dinners in a trailer parked outside the Braves spring training camp in West Palm Beach.\n\nIt was in West Palm Beach where Dale Murphy moved from a scatter-armed catcher to first base and eventually the outfield. Although Bobby Cox traded him to Philadelphia in his last major deal as Atlanta’s general manager, Murphy will always identify as a Brave.\n\nThe National League’s version of Cal Ripken, Jr., Murphy never smoked, drank, cursed, or missed a game. Or so it seemed.\n\nHe played in 740 consecutive games from 1982-85, won consecutive National League MVP awards, and just missed another when he led the league in home runs, slugging, and total bases in 1984. He finished with 398 home runs – one behind first-ballot inductee Al Kaline – and more total bases during the ‘80s than any other player, including George Brett, Dave Winfield, Paul Molitor, Mike Schmidt, and Eddie Murray. Only Schmidt had more home runs during the decade and only Murphy had more runs batted in. But Murphy was first in extra-base hits and runs scored. He won two RBI crowns (two more than Willie Mays) and two home run crowns (two more than Stan Musial).\n\nMurphy also won five Gold Gloves – five more than Jim Rice, who also had fewer homers. Other than suspected steroids abuser Barry Bonds, Murphy is the only National Leaguer with consecutive MVP trophies not enshrined in Cooperstown.\n\n“I would love to see Dale Murphy in the Hall of Fame,” said Bobby Cox, who saved the career of the young slugger, troubled by bad knees, by moving him out from behind the plate. “He went from catcher to first base to left field to center field and became a Gold Glove winner. He was MVP twice. And his character, what he did for communities and all that, has to add in somewhere.”\n\nAtlanta icon Hank Aaron, a Hall of Famer himself, added another point in Murphy’s favor. “One thing that always taught me a lot about a ballplayer,” he said, “was how he ran the bases. One of the most valuable things a player can do for a team is to go from first to third on a single. Murphy did that. He almost never got thrown out. When he saw a ball hit, he just knew he was going to get to third base. He had that baseball instinct you can’t teach.”\n\nThat instinct also helped Murphy at the plate, where he showed surprising discipline for a slugger. In 1987, his last great season, he reached career peaks with 44 home runs and a .417 on-base percentage. Within a year, however, his knees started barking again, causing a deep decline in production and performance. The Murphy balloon burst – just as the Andruw Jones balloon would burst 20 years later.\n\nThe youngest man to win consecutive National League MVP awards, Murphy has been enshrined in the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame for more than 15 years. Cooperstown should be next – especially if electors pay attention to baseball-reference.com statistics that place him higher than the average Hall of Famer in three of four comparative categories.\n\nElection results will be announced by the Veterans Committee on Dec. 9, the first day of the Baseball Winter Meetings in Las Vegas, and by the Baseball Writers Association of America on Jan. 22. Both groups make their selections from ballots prepared by special committees.\n\nIncluding the Class of 2018, the Hall of Fame has 323 members, including 226 former players,\n\n30 executives, 33 Negro League alumni, 22 managers, and 10 umpires. Writers and broadcasters receive recognition too via awards named after J.G. Taylor Spink and Ford Frick, respectively."
