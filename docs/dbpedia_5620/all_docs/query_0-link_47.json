        "text": "For some ballpark chasers, they enjoy planning the entire trip. For others, it’s easier to sit back and let others do the organizing and sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.\n\nSome people have tried it both ways and determined they prefer the easier way. That’s where the baseball bus tour companies come in. Having used Coast 2 Coast Sports Tours the last two years, I tend to agree.\n\nSo do Steve and Kim from Pennsylvania, who I met on this year’s West Coast Swing tour with Coast 2 Coast. The couple, who live in suburban Philadelphia are Phillies fans, hit the Midwest parks last year, including Minnesota, Milwaukee, and both Chicago parks.\n\nAnd who can blame them for liking the charter bus better.\n\nExhibit A: Traffic in and around Los Angeles.\n\nThere’s a reason that Dodger fans arrive in the second and third innings and leave in the seventh. It’s one way to try to beat the traffic.\n\nJust getting into the stadium can be a chore, as the driveways wind up to the parking areas. That also doesn’t help the curb appeal for the ballpark. With most stadiums, you usually get a glimpse of the park as you approach. With Dodger Stadium, you see the side of a hill.\n\nThe difficulties are to be expected, I suppose. Los Angeles is the second largest populated city in the United States. The park is also one of the oldest in the Major League Baseball.\n\nDodger Stadium is the third oldest stadium overall, behind Boston’s Fenway Park and Chicago’s Wrigley Field. It was built in 1962 and is the largest baseball stadium in the world, by seat capacity.\n\nThe stadium is often referred to as a pitcher’s ballpark, having seen 13 no-hitters and two perfect games. Dodger fans affectionately call it “Blue Heaven on Earth,” a phrase coined by former Dodger manager great Tommy Lasorda.\n\nThe entrance to the ballpark may be a big highlight, especially if you enter on the home plate side and the Top Deck entrance. You enter at the very top of the stadium, opening to an incredible view of the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\nEven if you enter at the outfield entrance, it’s worth a trip to the top to enjoy the view.\n\nFans entering through the centerfield entrance are able to see lifesize bobbleheads as well as statues of Sandy Koufax and Jackie Robinson.\n\nThe center field entrance offers plenty to do as well, including statues of Dodger greats Sandy Koufax and Jackie Robinson. The center field plaza also features lifesize bobbleheads, the Legends of Dodger baseball display along with a sports bar and beer garden.\n\nTwo of the stadium’s most distinctive features are the wavy roof on top of each outfield pavilion. Each pavilion has a scoreboard. There is also the top of a 10-story elevator shaft that has the Dodger logo, sitting directly behind home plate.\n\nGiven its history, the Dodgers have a lot of retired numbers: Don Drysdale (53), Koufax (32), Don Sutton (20), Pee Wee Reese (1), Robinson (42), Duke Snider (4), Lasorda (2), Walter Alston (24), Roy Campanella (39), Jim Gilliam (19), Gil Hodges (14), and the most recent player Fernando Valenzuela (34). Also honored in left field are announcers Vin Scully and Jaime Jarrin.\n\nThe stadium is the last in the National League that has symmetrical dimensions. In left an right field, it is 330 feet. In medium left-center and right-center, it is 360 feet. True left-center and right-center is 375 feet. Center field is 395 feet while true center field is 400 feet.\n\nBuilt in 1962, Dodger Stadium is the third oldest MLB stadium, trailing only Fenway Park and Wrigley Field.\n\nHere is an explanation of that: The distance of center field has been marked as 395 feet since1973, but it is actually still 400 feet. The two 395-foot signs are to the left and right of dead center, but the curvature of the fence between the posted signs is not exactly radial from home plate, meaning true center field is five feet further.\n\nObviously, the signature food item is the Dodger Dog, which is just a hot dog with a fancy name. Nothing else really stood out in terms of edibles. It was your basic ballpark cuisine.\n\nAs far as the game, we did get to see a little bit of history. Dodger catcher Will Smith smashed a two-run home run in the first inning. It was his fourth homer in four consecutive at bats, tying him for the MLB record. He was the first Dodger to accomplish the feat since first baseman Adrian Gonzalez did it back in April 2015. He is just the third MLB catcher to do it, along with Johnny Bench (1973) and Benito Santiago (1996).\n\nThe Dodger ended up beating Milwaukee, 5-3.\n\nAfter Milwaukee tied the game, 3-3, after home runs by Rhys Hoskins and Christian Yelich in the fourth and eighth innings, respectively. Miguel Vargas and Shohei Ohtani both hit homers to put the Dodgers ahead for good,\n\nPrevious Installments\n\nThe Overview, August 10, 2022\n\nRocky Mountain High, August 17, 2022\n\nBack to School Time, August 24, 2022\n\nOn Target, August 31, 2022\n\nMilwaukee’s Best, September 7, 2022\n\nGuaranteed Fun, September 14, 2022\n\nBusch!, September 21, 2022\n\nSidetrip!, September 28, 2022\n\nFountains & Waterfalls, October 5, 2022\n\nThat’s a Wrap, October 12, 2022\n\nFenway Sizzle, Then Fizzle, July 24, 2023\n\nTaking a Bite Out of the Big Apple, July 31, 2023\n\nHall of Dreams, August 7, 2023\n\nCitizens of Philadelphia, August 14, 2023\n\nNational Treasure, August 21, 2023\n\nYankee Doodle, August 28, 2023\n\nBirds of a Feather, September 4, 2023\n\nA Moment of Silence, September 11, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 1, September 25, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 2, September 27, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 3, September 29, 2023\n\nSleepless (no more) in Seattle, July 31, 2024\n\nOakland’s Last Call, August 7, 2024\n\nAs noted in Event 3, Part 1, this trip to Wrigley Field was going to be special. It was my first trip to Wrigley Field with my father since sometime in the 1970s (I’m going with 1974 or 1976 but who knows for sure).\n\nOnce we left the Mascot Hall of Fame in Whiting, IN, I chose to eschew the freeway drive up to Wrigley, choosing rather to head up Lake Shore Drive. It afforded us views of McCormick Place, Soldier Field, the Field Museum of Natural History, Shedd Aquarium, Grant Park (which was hosting Lollapalooza!), Navy Pier, and Lincoln Park. All places, I later learned, my dad had not seen in decades and my cousin, Griffin, had little recollection of seeing either.\n\nOf course there was traffic – always traffic in Chicago, right! – and as we made our turn onto West Addison I was really glad I’d reached out to another Cubs fan (and Chicago-area resident), Laura Dennis about how to handle parking. My most-recent trips to Wrigley all involved taking The L. Laura’s advice, download the app Spot Hero, find a spot, and book it in advance. Check, check, and check. We were about a block and a half east of the stadium off Addison and for $30 I felt it was a steal. Aside from the medical emergency on the corner upon our arrival (police cruiser and ambulance blocking the area I figured the spot was at) all worked well.\n\nI’ll be honest, this event was the most personal to date and – quite likely – will remain so even after I’ve completed this entire Around the World in 80 Sporting Events project.\n\nArriving in Wrigleyville\n\nThe Cubbie Bear bar at the corner of Addison & Clark; Cubs and Cardinals fans living in harmony; Wrigleyville banners adorn lightpoles on Clark Street; and Gallagher Way is the place to be during pre-game. (Banner photo by Griffin Hill)\n\nFor a 1:20 p.m. game, gates open a bit before noon. We arrived shortly afterward and the area surrounding Wrigley Field – known as Wrigleyville (listen to the Wrigleyville podcast here) – was already a bubbling with activity.\n\nWe lingered for a bit at the corner of Addison and Clark to secure a group photo with the famous Wrigley marquee in the background and generally milled about, soaking up the ambience and the sunshine (and midwest humidity;-), as well as the electic mix of Cubs and Cardinals’ garb throughout the area.\n\nThe Gallagher Way Experience\n\nA recent addition to the Wrigley Field experience (2017) is Gallagher Way, a plaza-like set up along Clark Street in front of Wrigley. It’s open to the public every day of the year, but on game days it’s available only ticket holders.\n\nThere’s music, lawn games, beverages, a splash pad, and, among the highlights for our group, the statues of several Chicago Cubs’ National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees: Ernie Banks, Fergie Jenkins, Ryne Sandberg, Ron Santo, and Billy Williams.\n\nClockwise from upper left, the Billy Williams statue, Fergie Jenkins statue, the view up the gathered on Gallagher Way’s green space, the Ron Santo statue, the Ryne Sandberg statue, Griffin and Jerry flanking the Ernie Banks statue.\n\nSandberg Pop Up Museum\n\nThe longtime Cubs’ secondbaseman is the most-recent honoree with a statue in Gallagher Way. The Cubs commemorated the 40th anniversary of his performance against the Cardinals on June 23, 1984 (aka the Ryne Sandberg Game, here’s Harry Caray’s take) by unveiling his statue earlier this summer.\n\nAs part of this “Summer of Sandberg,” there’s a free pop-up shrine to Sandberg in the Gallagher Way area. There was plenty of artifacts from Ryno’s career with the Cubs and it was totally worth the five minutes it took to stroll through.\n\nDisplays showcase Sandberg’s Gold Gloves as well as his Silver Slugger awards.\n\nOur Seats\n\nAs alluded to perviously and presumably visible through the images, a Cubs-Cardinals matchup virtually assures a capacity crowd. It certainly felt that way as we made our way to our seats behind the Cubs’ dugout.\n\nAs my friend Sara Earleywine predicted, our seats were as perfect as could be (a touch more leg room would have been ideal, but why quibble!?!). Section 111, Row 15 was in the shade for the game’s duration (thank heavens), it had a slight bit of cover from the second deck should precipitation became an issue, and it was just one step down into the section so it didn’t require much stair work for my father.\n\nA couple of views form our seats, first back toward homeplate and the other one looking at the leftfield foul pole, the bleachers, and rooftop seating.\n\nThe Game\n\nSpoiler Alert: Cubs Win! Cubs Win! (boxscore here).\n\nThat was, perhaps, the best part of this magical day. Not only did the weather clear from the early-morning fog and mistiness, but we also got to see 2016 World Series MVP and hometown hero, Ben Zobrist, throw out the ceremonial first pitch and sing the seventh inning stretch tradition, “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” And, because the Cubs won, we got to see the flying of the ‘W’ flag which dates to 1937 and hear the singing of “Go, Cubs, Go” which was released in 1984 and has been a victory anthem for about the past 20 seasons.\n\nIt was a day full of allof the emotions you might expect, going with family to a place that holds special memories for two of us and might well hold similar ones into the future for the other two. To be able to spend a day with three generations baseball fans in our family in a stadium that’s 110 years old and watch a baseball team that dates back 149 years … well, I’m uncertain any words I can put down would do it justice.\n\nClockwise from upper left, bratwurst with kraut and mustard for me; the busys concourse during the game; the view from the rightfield line through the ivy; the scoreboards (both of them!) say it all post-game; three generations of Hills in our seats at Wrigley Field; one of us kept score; and the marquee may as well say we all win.\n\nThough a long day – we didn’t return to my dad’s place until after 10 p.m. – I’m fairly certain it’s a trip we’d all take again if presented the opportunity. Here’s hoping that opportunity comes along.\n\nSing the Song!\n\nPreviously: Wrigley Field Bound\n\nI’ll be honest, this event was the most personal to date and – quite likely – will remain so even after I’ve completed this entire Around the World in 80 Sporting Events project.\n\nPrevioulsy, both on this website and on my podcast (Conversations with Sports Fans), I’ve traced my sports fandom to my dad, Jerry, and his love of the Chicago Cubs. I recall those times on my parents’ bed and my dad reciting the first names of his favorite Cubbies in a tape recorder and then my response coming with their last names. Likewise, my first-ever Major League Baseball game was at Wrigley Field circa 1974 (I think!) when I seem to remember the Cubs hosting the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nSo when I set out to travel to the most iconic sporting events and venues the world has to offer, a trip to Wrigley Field was most assuredly on the list. Furthermore, my desire was to see the Cubs play their rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals, during a weekday afternoon start … and get my dad back to Chicago’s northside to see his first game there since the mid-1970s.\n\nThat being said, I was delighted when the 2024 MLB schedule and time of games were released back in late 2023, and I saw Friday, August 2, provided both the desired opponent and the day and time of game I was looking for.\n\nSecuring Tickets\n\nThe Cubs-Cardinals rivalry goes way back and I knew that fans of both teams make the teams’ series an annual event. Therefore, this was going to be a tough ticket to come by. I consulted with friend, Sara Earleywine from Iowa. She’s one of the biggest Cubs’ fans I know who also secures tickets to a few games, annually, when they first go on sale. I knew she’d have sage advice for me.\n\nShe delivered:\n\nSign up for your interest in Cubs’ tickets to ensure you have priority for on-sale;\n\nCheck your email – regularly! – to ensure you know when the priority on-sale begins;\n\nClear your calendar when know that date and time for the sale.\n\nShe also gave me the best advice for where to sit behind the Cubs’ dugout (my dad’s request of seats) fo the optimum shade and sightlines. That intel was utilized when settling on Section 111, Row 15. It was under shade and was steps away and just one row down from the ramp to our section making it an ideal spot to bring along my soon-to-be octogenerian father.\n\nDetermining the Traveling Party\n\nAfter successfully securing four tickets we decided to make it a family affair.\n\nBoth my dad and I reached out to my cousin (and my dad’s nephew), Brandon, to see if he and his son, Griffin, would like to use the other two tickets.\n\nThey did!\n\nIt heartened me – and my dad – to have three generations of Hills attending, including one (Griffin) who’d be attending his first game at Wrigley Field.\n\nGame Day\n\nWe left my father’s place in Adams County, IN, shortly after 8 a.m. for the nearly 4-hour drive northwest across the state to Wrigleyville. U.S. 30 was the primarty route, taking us through large swaths of rural northern Indiana as we made our way toward our destination.\n\nWe eyed one stop en route: The Mascot Hall of Fame in Whiting, IN.\n\nIt seemed a natural layover, about 45 minutes from Wrigley, and on brand with the whole Around the World in 80 Sporting Events project. The Hall of Fame was founded in 2005 (by David Raymond, the original Phillie Phanatic) and the site in Whiting opened in 2018.\n\nWe arrived shortly after the Hall opened for the day and Helena, an employee, greeted us to explain what Friday Free-Yay was all about. Who knew, we happened upon the Hall the first Friday of the month which meant free admission.\n\nScore!\n\nIt was a lovely space that certainly catered to younger guests, but we were all pleased to have seen it … especially after Helena told us it was closing at the end of September!\n\nIt turns out, the City of Whiting owned the building and had recently sold it to British Petroleum (BP) which has a major footprint in Whiting and the surrounding areas. BP will be converting the space for its use and Helena did not know whether the Mascot Hall of Fame would be relocating or what its future plans were.\n\nClockwise from upper left, this Mascot University display greets visitors who happen upon the Mascot Hall of Fame; giant inflatables of many mascot heads hang from the rafters; two of the inductees bobbleheads in the display case (Mr. Met and K.C. Wolf); the Phillie Phanatic was a charter member of the Mascot Hall of Fame; and a wider look at one side of the inductee display case.\n\nUp Next: Our Family Day at the Friendly Confines\n\nLet’s get one thing out of the way. The Oakland Coliseum ain’t pretty.\n\nAnd there are several reasons behind that. It is old and it has been neglected by ownership, but it can still be an enjoyable place to watch a game.\n\nHear me out on this.\n\nThe Oakland Coliseum is the fifth-oldest stadium in the Major Leagues, hosting its first game in 1968. Only Boston’s Fenway Park, Chicago’s Wrigley Field, Los Angeles’ Dodger Stadium, and Anaheim’s Angel Stadium are older.\n\nWhile Athletics owner John Fisher has neglected the stadium as he tried to wrangle a new stadium from the city of Oakland. It doesn’t help that when the Oakland Raiders used the stadium, owner Al Davis built what is affectionately known as Mt. Davis in center field to hold more fans for football.\n\nThat monstrosity took away a gorgeous view of the California mountains and scenery.\n\nBut, while the stadium isn’t much, the game experience is much better. And that is a tribute to their fans, at least the ones that continue to attend games.\n\nThe A’s are only averaging about 6,500 fans per game, which would be the lowest for an MLB team in 45 years. During games, the fans in attendance are into the game, trying to cheer their team to a win. It can be a lively, entertaining time.\n\nSure, it may not be as loud as a sold out Citizens Bank Park (Philadelphia Phillies) or as electric as a Cubs-Cardinals rivalry, but it is still an exciting time.\n\nThere seem to be two factions among the fans. Those that don’t want to give another dime to a cheap, penny-pinching owner. And those that want to fight to try to keep the A’s in Oakland.\n\nEvery so often, a group of fans designate a particular game as a reverse boycott, in other words, trying to pack the stadium, to show the owner that the fans can support the team.\n\nClockwise from upper left, it ain’t much, but this is the sign greeting fans at the Oakland Colisuem; fans, including the Elephant mascot, sit behind homeplate; fans along the left field line; and the right field line which also showcases the extended foul territory.\n\nYou can also see fans wearing green t-shirts with the word “SELL” in yellow in ALL CAPS, as a message to Fisher to sell the team.\n\nThose fans that do attend the games, make for a lively, fun experience, despite the fact that they are losing their team at the end of the season. You can often hear fans call the Coliseum, “Baseball’s Last Dive Bar.”\n\nOakland reportedly is going to play three seasons in their AAA team’s stadium in Sacramento at Sutter Health Park. The Las Vegas stadium is slated to open in 2028.\n\nGiven that fact, it seems as the franchise is kind of phoning it in for their last season in Oakland. The main team store is less than half of most team’s secondary stores. Also, many high demand items, like lapel pins and patches, have been sold out for months.\n\nMany concession stands sit empty, especially on the second level. The third level has been closed for most of the season. They do open it for a series when a bigger crowd is expected, like when the Los Angeles Dodgers come to town. (The August 3 game against the downstate Dodgers had an attendance of 35,000 and all 200 Level concession stands were open and even one on the 300 Level.)\n\nTo be expected, the last game at the Coliseum is almost sold out (just 265 seats remain the beginning of this week). That’s not including the seats on Mt. Davis. As of now, there is no plan to sell those seats. The capacity at the Coliseum is 46,847. If they open up Mt. Davis, the capacity jumps to 56,872.\n\nRemaining tickets for the final game start at $104, probably even higher on the secondary market. Every fan in attendance at the final game will get a commemorative model of the ballpark.\n\nThe stadium is the last one to feature the bullpens in foul ground, one down each baseline. The park also features a very expansive foul territory. The distance from home plate to the backstop was initially 90 feet, but eventually reduced to 60 feet.\n\nHere are the outfield dimensions of the park: 330 feet to left field, 388 feet to left-center, 400 feet to center field, 388 feet to right-center and 330 feet to right field.\n\nThe field itself is named after former A’s great and National Baseball Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson. There are six gates to enter the park, two are named after former pitchers Jim “Catfish” Hunter and Dennis Eckersley.\n\nIn a final nod to A’s history, the team put up a light-up “Holy Toledo” sign to pay homage to broadcaster Bill King‘s catch phrase.\n\nAlong the concourses, there are also mentions of Athletics’ history, including references to Billy Ball, when Billy Martin managed the team. There are also several mentions of past players like Henderson, Eckersley, Reggie Jackson, Mark McGwire, Jose Canseco, Vida Blue, and Sal Bando.\n\nMuch like the first game on this tour in Seattle, the Baltimore Orioles provided the oppositon. Baltimore’s Albert Suarez went six strong innings, allowing just two runs on four hits with six strikeouts as the Orioles edged the Athletics, 3-2. Baltimore’s Austin Hays had an RBI double in the second inning and catcher Adley Rutschman drew a bases-loaded walk, which proved to be enough. Oakland catcher Shea Langeliers hit a solo home run in the seventh to cut the lead to one, but the A’s would get no closer. The attendance was 9,654.\n\nPrevious Installments\n\nThe Overview, August 10, 2022\n\nRocky Mountain High, August 17, 2022\n\nBack to School Time, August 24, 2022\n\nOn Target, August 31, 2022\n\nMilwaukee’s Best, September 7, 2022\n\nGuaranteed Fun, September 14, 2022\n\nBusch!, September 21, 2022\n\nSidetrip!, September 28, 2022\n\nFountains & Waterfalls, October 5, 2022\n\nThat’s a Wrap, October 12, 2022\n\nFenway Sizzle, Then Fizzle, July 24, 2023\n\nTaking a Bite Out of the Big Apple, July 31, 2023\n\nHall of Dreams, August 7, 2023\n\nCitizens of Philadelphia, August 14, 2023\n\nNational Treasure, August 21, 2023\n\nYankee Doodle, August 28, 2023\n\nBirds of a Feather, September 4, 2023\n\nA Moment of Silence, September 11, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 1, September 25, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 2, September 27, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 3, September 29, 2023\n\nSleepless (no more) in Seattle, July 31, 2024\n\n(Contributing writer Timothy Russell returns with another set of entries in his Chasing Ballparks series. Leading off this year, Seattle’s T-Mobile Park.)\n\nWell, it’s that time of year again – one of my favorite times – the annual baseball bus trip.\n\nThis was the third bus trip I’ve taken. The first was with Diamond Baseball Tours, while the last two were with Coast 2 Coast Sports Tours. I made a point of doing a west coast trip to check off the Oakland Coliseum, which is in its last season as the Oakland Athletics are fleeing town for Las Vegas in 2027. The A’s will likely play in Sacramento until the Vegas stadium is built.\n\nAnd that leads me to probably the most important person on any of these trips. No, it’s not the tour director or the tour goers.\n\nIt’s the bus drivers.\n\nThis trip the tour was kind of broken up into two tours. The first one was a 2-day trip around Seattle. After a flight to Oakland, we got more settled into a routine.\n\nFor the Seattle leg, our bus driver was Dave, who showed up in full Fourth of July regalia and a red, white and blue hat. He delivered great bits of information about the Seattle area and also had some high-profile gigs.\n\nDuring COVID, he drove NFL referees to the game and around the city. He’d park the bus in the stadium tunnel and be one of the few people allowed to stay during the game. Even the drivers who drove the players had to leave the stadium.\n\nClockwise from left, Coast 2 Coast Sport Tours received a shoutout on T-Mobile Park scoreboard; no trip to Seattle is complete without a visit to Pike Street’s famous Public Market Center; and the Mariner Moose celebrates the victory over Baltimore.\n\nAs far as baseball, Dave said he has never seen the Mariners win in person. Of course, he doesn’t go to many games. He prefers watching the games on TV at the end of the bar.\n\nThen, there was Roberto, who took over for the bulk of the trip once we got to Oakland. The San Francisco native got in and out of some tough spots, maneuvering the bus around illegally parked cars in hotel parking lots and other tricky areas.\n\nWe skipped ahead slightly to mention both bus drivers, but the first ballpark we visited was Seattle’s T-Mobile Park. It’s a stadium that I had been to before, but it’s been about 15 years.\n\nIt’s a fairly accessible park, especially if you take the light rail system. As you walk up to the stadium, you see two statues. One is of Edgar Martinez, who played third base and designated hitter for the Mariners from 1987 to 2004. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nKen Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez receive statue treatment at Seattle’s T-Mobile Park.\n\nMore prominently is the statue of Ken Griffey Jr., which is right outside the main entrance. When visiting ballparks, I enjoy looking at the statues of past players. But viewing the Griffey Jr. statue was more special.\n\nHe has always been one of my favorite players and definitely one of the more complete players to play the game. He was a 13-time All-Star with 630 home runs. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016. I don’t wear many non-Detroit Tiger jerseys, but his would be one I would consider buying for my collection.\n\nOne of the features you first notice inside the park would be the retractable roof. When closed, it does cover the entire ballpark, but it is not enclosed. It’s more like a canopy that slides over the entire playing field and stands.\n\nSome facts about the roof. It covers almost nine acres and has enough steel to build a 55-story skyscraper. There are three movable panels that glide on 128 wheels, powered by 96 10-horsepower electric motors. It takes about 10-20 minutes to fully open or close the roof. It can be done once during a game.\n\nThere is also a third statue inside the stadium. That one is of Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus. He was honored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2008. Niehaus broadcast 5,284 Mariners games over 34 seasons until 2010 when he died.\n\nThe statue features him sitting behind a desk with a microphone, wearing headphones. There is a scorebook in front of him, opened to the boxscore for Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series, when Edgar Martinez hit “The Double.” There is also an empty seat next to Niehaus for fans to pose for photos. (Hear Niehaus’ call here.)\n\nAnother feature inside the stadium is the Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest and the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame. It is on the main concourse, across from sections 135-141.\n\nMembers of the Mariners Hall of Fame are: Alvin Davis, Niehaus, Jay Buhner, Martinez, Randy Johnson, Dan Wilson, Lou Piniella, Griffey, Jamie Moyer, Ichiro Suzuki, and the most recent addition, Felix Hernandez.\n\nThe stadium holds 47,929 people. Dimensions of the stadium are 331 feet down the left field line, 378 to left center, 401 to center field, 381 to right-center and 326 down the right field line.\n\nGiven the heavy Asian population in the Seattle area, there are plentiful options for Asian food in the ballpark, including sushi, teriyaki, stir fries, and pad thai. There is also the standard ballpark fare, along with burritos, garlic fries, crepes, health food, seafood, and barbecue.\n\nOne of the more popular restaurants is Edgar’s Cantina, located in left field and features a heavy Latin American influence.\n\nAlso located in the left field ‘Pen area – known as the Bullpen Market – is the Mariners’ top contribution to ballpark cuisine. They sell chapulines, or toasted grasshoppers, in a chili-lime sauce. They got to be so popular that the club has to limit how many are sold each game.\n\nThey sell 312 portions each game. A portion size is three ounces and costs $9.99. The 312 is a nod to Martinez’s career .312 batting average. They are billed as high-protein content with no fat, no carbs, and are gluten free.\n\nWhile I personally did not try any, a couple tour members did and said you could taste the spice more than the insects.\n\nIn the game, bus driver Dave finally did get to see the Mariners pull out a win. The Mariners used a five-run seventh inning to take a 7-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. While he wasn’t able to stay for the entire game, Dave was able to see the big seventh inning before taking off to get the bus ready to leave.\n\nBaltimore took a 2-0 lead early, before Seattle tied it in the fifth before the big seventh inning. Seattle’s bullpen gave up just one run and two hits in the final 3 2/3 innings to seal the game, 7-3.\n\nPrevious Installments\n\nThe Overview, August 10, 2022\n\nRocky Mountain High, August 17, 2022\n\nBack to School Time, August 24, 2022\n\nOn Target, August 31, 2022\n\nMilwaukee’s Best, September 7, 2022\n\nGuaranteed Fun, September 14, 2022\n\nBusch!, September 21, 2022\n\nSidetrip!, September 28, 2022\n\nFountains & Waterfalls, October 5, 2022\n\nThat’s a Wrap, October 12, 2022\n\nFenway Sizzle, Then Fizzle, July 24, 2023\n\nTaking a Bite Out of the Big Apple, July 31, 2023\n\nHall of Dreams, August 7, 2023\n\nCitizens of Philadelphia, August 14, 2023\n\nNational Treasure, August 21, 2023\n\nYankee Doodle, August 28, 2023\n\nBirds of a Feather, September 4, 2023\n\nA Moment of Silence, September 11, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 1, September 25, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 2, September 27, 2023\n\nRank’em Part 3, September 29, 2023\n\nAttempting to go Around the World in 80 Sporting Events means visiting some wonderful destinations and witnessing some monumental moments. Clockwise from upper left, the scoreboard at the 150th Open Championship at St. Andrews’ Old Course; Roberto Clemente’s jersey in the Baseball Hall of Fame; downtown Cooperstown, NY; the Swilcan Bridge at St. Andrews; the author and the Stanley Cup at the Hockey Hall of Fame; and the Hoosiers’ gym in Knightstown, IN.\n\nAs noted in the previous installment, once some foundational guardrails were in place, it was up to me to determine what Around the World in 80 Sporting Events would encompass. That is, what events/venues would rise to the level of iconic for inclusion?\n\nFortunately, by the time I’d arrived at this point in the planning stages I was well into the second season of hosting the podcast, “Conversations with Sports Fans,” so I knew what a lot of other folks felt were notable sporting events. Plus, many just nominate themselves because of the significance around the event.\n\nWhat follows is a list by sport. The number in parentheses next to the sport are the total events in that category. At the bottom of each grouping is a brief explanation (where needed) of what’s included.\n\nBaseball (16)\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals-Chicago Cubs Game at Wrigley Field\n\nNew York Yankees-Boston Red Sox Game at Fenway Park\n\nSan Francisco Giants-Los Angeles Dodgers Game at Dodger Stadium\n\nMLB World Series Game in TBD\n\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, NY\n\nNegro Leagues Museum in Kansas City, MO\n\nMen’s College World Series in Omaha, NE\n\nBoy’s Little League World Series in South Williamsport, PA\n\n“Field of Dreams” Film Site in Dyersville, IA\n\nMidnight Sun Game in Fairbanks, AK\n\nNippon Baseball League Game in Japan\n\nKorean Baseball Organization Game in South Korea\n\nMLB Grapefruit League Game(s) in Florida\n\nMLB Cactus League Game(s) in Arizona\n\nWorld Baseball Classic Game(s) in TBD\n\nCaribbean Series Game(s) in TBD\n\nBaseball was the first sport I was really exposed to so it should come as no surprise it’s the one that has the most events. … The three longest standing and, perhaps, most fierce rivalries in the game are the three listed above. In a perfect world I’d attend a game in all six locations, but this world is neither perfect nor free so I had to make a difficult decision and chose the three oldest ballparks. … Cooperstown is as close to Valhalla for me as I’ll find and I’ve heard way too much about the Negro Leagues Museum to not include it. … As noted previously, I have history in Fairbanks so returning there for the Midnight Sun Game (game time, 10 p.m., no artificial lighting used) seems fitting. … The remainder are all opportunities for me to experience baseball through the lens of other cultures.\n\nBasketball (14)\n\nNew York Knicks at Madison Square Garden\n\nDuke University at Cameron Indoor Stadium\n\nKansas University at Phog Allen Field House\n\nButler University at Hinkle Field House\n\nUCLA at Pauley Pavilion\n\nA Big 5 Game at the Palestra\n\nIndiana High School Basketball (preferably an early-round tournament game)\n\n“Hoosiers’ Gym in Knightstown, IN\n\nMaui Classic Games in Lahaina, HI\n\nMen’s NCAA Final Four Games in TBD\n\nWomen’s NCAA Final Four Games in TBD\n\nMen’s NCAA Tournament Opening Week in Las Vegas, NV\n\nNBA Finals Game in TBD\n\nNaismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, MA\n\nGrowing up in basketball-mad Indiana, having 14 basketball events should not shock anyone either, I’d guess. … With a nod to my Hoosier roots, seeing the gym where “Hoosiers” was filmed is a must, as is a high school game, and a visit to Butler’s Hinkle Field House. … The five other venues I’d like to visit are, simply, those that captured my fascination through years of fandom. They are old-school gyms that anytime the networks have been there have tugged at me to pay homage someday. … The Maui Classic has been such a part of Thanksgiving week for me that I want to experience that environment in person. … Some might call the inclusion of the Women’s Final Four the Caitlin Clark effect, but I’ve been tuning into those games for the better part of a decade. Clark sucked me into some more early round action, but I love the current women’s college game and believe it’s time I see some in person.\n\nFootball (13)\n\nDetroit Lions’ Thanksgiving Day Game\n\nOhio State-Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI\n\nAuburn-Alabama in TBD\n\nUSC-Notre Dame in South Bend, IN\n\nArmy-Navy Game in TBD\n\nTexas High School Football Game in TBD\n\nOklahoma-Texas at Cotton Bowl in Dallas, TX\n\nDallas Cowboys Game in Alrington, TX\n\nMinnesota Vikings/Chicago Bears-Green Bay Packers in Green Bay, WI\n\nThe Rose Bowl and Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, CA\n\nNCAA National Championship Game in TBD\n\nSuper Bowl in TBD\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, OH\n\nOf North America’s four major sports, football is probably the one I’m least likely to view from contest beginning to end. That said, Keith Jackson and John Madden made it enjoyable and Brent Musburger telling spectators “you’re looking live at (fill-in-the-blank)” made many games feel more significant than they actually were. … The Rose Bowl has been the quintesseential college football dream for this midwesterner and it needs to come with the Parade as a nod to my late mother who loved watching each year. … If I have my druthers, the Texas high school game will be at Permian in Odessa where “Friday Night Lights” was based. And, as fate has it this year, Permian’s home on a Friday, the Red River Rivalry is on Saturday, and the Cowboys host the Lions on Sunday. … Still to be determined is which rival I see the Packers host at Lambeau Field. What say you sports fan nation?\n\nHockey (10)\n\nNHL Winter Classic in TBD\n\nMontreal-Toronto Game in Toronto, ON\n\nCalgary-Edmonton Game in Edmonton, AB\n\nNew York Rangers Game at Madison Square Garden in NY\n\n2026 World Junior Tourament in St. Paul, MN\n\nU.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth, MN\n\nMinnesota High School Hockey Game in TBD\n\nHockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, ON\n\nStanley Cup Trophy Presentation in TBD\n\nMichigan State University-University of Michigan at Yost Ice Arena in Ann Arbor\n\nI may be a Hoosier native, but my most formative years were in metro-Detroit (aka Hockeytown) and I covered college hockey for the Ann Arbor News and Fairbanks Daily News-Miner so there’s some hockey love within. I’m not as enamored with the Winter Classic as I am the Rose Bowl, but some of the images from New Year’s Days past have been too cool. … Similar to the baseball rivalries above, there were the two I most wanted to see and a decision was needed for which city to see them. Edmonton was the Detroit Red Wings’ nemesis a few seasons in the 1980s so it’d be neat to see it in person and Toronto is drivable and that gives it the nod. … Every year during college hockey season, handful of players from U-M would head off the World Juniors. With the advent of streaming services it’s become more accessible and it comes to the U.S. in 2026. … Much like high school basketball in Indiana and football in Texas, hockey in Minnesota borders on a religion so it seems natural to want to check it out. … There’s only one trophy in sport I’d like to see presented and that’s the Stanley Cup. It might mean having to do multiple cross-continental flights and pay obscence resale ticket prices to do it, but I’m here for the challenge.\n\nGolf (8)\n\nThe Masters in Augusta, GA\n\nPGA Championship in TBD\n\nU.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina (Completed! Read about it here)\n\nThe Open Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland\n\nThe Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in Long Island, NY\n\nThe President’s Cup at Royal Montreal in Montreal\n\nThe Solheim Cup at Robert Trent Jonese Golf Club in Gainesville, VA\n\nPebble Beach Pro-Am in Pebble Beach, CA\n\nMy dad was and is an avid golf fan and that’s no doubt rubbed off on me, though my playing days are long behind me. That said, there are four Major Championships, so it follows that they all should be patronized. The men’s and women’s team competitions are captivating to me and the scenery at Pebble Beach is virtually unparalleled.\n\nTennis (4)\n\nAustralian Open\n\nFrench Open\n\nWimbledon\n\nU.S. Open\n\nFour Grand Slam events = four tennis tournaments to visit.\n\nFutbol/Soccer (5)\n\nMen’s World Cup Match(es) in North America (2026)\n\nEnglish Premier League Match(es) in TBD\n\nAfrica Cup of Nations in Morocco (2025)\n\nSouth American World Cup Qualifying in TBD (2025)\n\nEuropean Soccer Match(es) [Champions League, Europa League, or Bundesliga/La Liga/Ligue 1/Serie A] in TBD\n\nWe’ll call it the “Ted Lasso” effect. I do enjoy my weekend mornings checking out soccer from across the pond, plus many of my friends have clubs they follow. … As far as the African and South American matches, we can’t very well call this project Around the World in 80 Sporting Events and not get to six of the seven contintents can we?\n\nAuto Racing (5)\n\nDaytona 500 in Daytona, FL\n\nIndianapolis 500 in Indianapolis, IN\n\nFormula 1 in TBD (preferably overseas)\n\nNASCAR Bristol Night Race in Bristol, TN\n\nNASCAR Cup Semifinal in Martinsville, VA\n\nThe first three were pretty straightfoward. The final two, I’m relying on my NASCAR friends Frank and Kevin to not steer me wrong (see what I did there;-)\n\nHorse Racing (3)\n\nKentucky Derby in Louisville, KY\n\nPreakness Stakes in Baltimore, MD\n\nBelmont Stakes, in NY, NY\n\nI’m sure the Breeder’s Cup is a phenomenal event, but these are the three races that have piqued my curiosity through the years (typically in descending order as well).\n\nOthers (6)\n\nWinter Olympics in Milan, Italy (2026)\n\nIditarod Sled Dog Race in Alaska\n\nBoston Marathon in Boston, MA\n\nTour de France\n\nWomen’s College World Series in Oklahoma City, OK\n\nRodeo at Frontier Days in Cheyenne, WY\n\nThe timebound nature of this quest (a goal of completing by 2027) prevents me from getting to a Summer Olympics (Los Angeles in 2028 is on my list of next things to do!) so the Winter will be enjoyable. … I’ve already referenced my Alaska history so seeing the start (or the finish) of the Iditarod beckons. … The Boston Marathon and Tour de France are both so noteworthy I believe they must be sampled in person. … I’ve long enjoyed the WCWS and welcome the opportunity to swelter in the blazing sun and occasional severe weather alerts around my birthday someday. … I’d not call myself a rodeo fan, but seeing an event such as this as part of Frontier Days in Wyoming just seems right.\n\nMy math teaching friends have no doubt calculated there are actually 84 events listed. This is, in fact, accurate. I’m of the belief I need to overplan and cut (or swap out) as the process unfolds. Myriad things can occur between now and the proposed completion of this venture so it’s good to have options in the event something comes up.\n\nAnyhow, let the gnashing of teeth begin. What am I missing? What am I overvaluing? Should it be Vikings-Packers or Bears-Packers at Lambeau? Do you want to attend any of these events with me? Let me know in the comments or by emailing me at hilldouglast@gmail.com.\n\nMeanwhile, The Open Championship at Royal Troon Golf Club is on the clock (10 days and counting!). I can’t wait:-)\n\nIt was 85 years ago this week that, between games of a Fourth of July doubleheader against the Washington Senators, that the New York Yankees paid tribute to eventual Baseball Hall of Famer Lou Gehrig.\n\nThis is when Gehrig approached the phalanx of microphones near homeplate and addressed over 60,000 fans at Yankee Stadium and uttered his famous phrase, “luckiest man on the face of the earth.”\n\nIf you’ve never reviewed Gehrig’s statistics please do yourself the favor and take a look at his Baseball-Reference page. Like many, your editor had reduced him to both his 2,160 consecutive games played streak as well as his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). During the 14 seasons he was the Yankees’ regular first baseman, in at least one season he led the American League in every notable offensive category except At Bats and Stolen Bases. That is: Plate Appearances, Runs, Hits, Doubles, Triples, Home Runs, RBIs, Walks, Batting Average, Slugging Percentage, On-Base Percentage, On-Base Plus Slugging, and Total Bases. He finished in the top five in MVP voting nine times and won the award twice.\n\nTruly a remarkable player.\n\nHere is the full text of Gehrig’s speech:\n\n“Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about the bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this earth. I have been in ballparks for seventeen years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.\n\n“Look at these grand men. Which of you wouldn’t consider it the highlight of his career just to associate with them for even one day? Sure, I’m lucky. Who wouldn’t consider it an honor to have known Jacob Ruppert? Also, the builder of baseball’s greatest empire, Ed Barrow? To have spent six years with that wonderful little fellow, Miller Huggins? Then to have spent the next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology, the best manager in baseball today, Joe McCarthy? Sure, I’m lucky.”\n\nJust to review, The Fan Teaser comes courtesy of longtime buddy, Pat Schutte.

The Fan Teaser will appear each Friday morning with the reveal coming to you Sunday.\n\nFifty-one years ago, the University of Minnesota’s senior 2-sport phenom, Dave Winfield, nearly led the Golden Gophers to their fourth Men’s College World Series title.\n\nA pitcher and a outfielder for the Gophers, Winfield got the start in the opener against the University of Oklahoma and blanked the Sooners, 1-0, thanks to his 14-strikeout effort. Minnesota then lost to Arizona State, 3-0, before beating Georgia Southern, 6-2, to earn a date with 3-time defending champion, USC.\n\nWinfield was again on the bump for the Gophers and he was again dominant. Through eight innings he had a 1-hit shutout going with 15 strikeouts and a 7-0 Minnesota lead. However, a questionable safe call at first on a would-be doubeplay in the ninth gave USC new life and it took advantage thanks to a couple more singles and a critical error by the Minnesota firstbaseman. Winfield was chased, two more relievers followed (as did two more Gopher errors), and USC wound up scoring eight runs for the win. USC then beat Arizona State, 4-3, to secure its fourth straight title and, a year later, won its fifth straight by defeating Miami (FL), 7-3.\n\nThough Minnesota didn’t even make the championship game, let alone win it, Winfield was named the Series’ Most Outstanding Player, throwing 17 1/3 innings, allowing nine hits, one earned run, and striking out 29. He also hit .467 over the four games Minnesota played.\n\nJust days before the MCWS began, Winfield was drafted fourth overall by the San Diego Padres. A week to the day following his final game as a Gopher, Winfield was in Padres’ Manager Don Zimmer‘s lineup against the Houston Astros, batting seventh, and playing leftfield. He went 1-for-4 (boxscore here).\n\nJust to review, The Fan Teaser comes courtesy of longtime buddy, Pat Schutte.
