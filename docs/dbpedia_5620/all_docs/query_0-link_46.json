        "text": "Pedroia managed a .789 OPS the rest of that season but played only nine more games after that.\n\n“I’ve never gotten over it,” Pedroia said. “Company line kind of deal. Every day I want to play. That’s never going to change. It’s hard.\n\n“To have it taken away from you sucks. So if I don’t make the Hall of Fame because I didn’t play three more years and for bulk numbers, whatever.”\n\nPedroia played only 1,512 games, a significant roadblock in his candidacy. Among Hall of Fame position players, only a handful have played fewer. But Pedroia also was Rookie of the Year in 2007, Most Valuable Player in 2008, a four-time Gold Glove winner, a four-time All-Star, and a two-time World Series winner. He won every trophy he could have.\n\nThe only other position players in history to win Rookie of the Year, MVP and at least two World Series are Johnny Bench, Jose Canseco, Thurman Munson, Albert Pujols, Buster Posey, Frank Robinson, and Pete Rose.\n\nBench and Robinson are Hall of Famers; Posey and Pujols surely will be once they are on the ballot and Rose was banned from baseball for gambling and has never been on the ballot. Canseco lasted one year on the ballot because of his use of PEDs.\n\nMunson died at age 32 in an airplane crash during the 1979 season. He was on the ballot for 15 years and topped out at 15.5 percent his first season. That Munson played in 1,423 games is what kept him out of Cooperstown. Pedroia playing 89 more games doesn’t seem like enough to make a difference. That’s just over half a season.\n\nWhat Pedroia has in his favor is that he’s the only second baseman in history to win all the awards he did, and he was a two-time champion for a high-profile team.\n\n“Who did what I did at second base?” he said. “Look at that promotion.”\n\nPedroia was laughing. Then he became serious.\n\n“I don’t know what the criteria is. I just did what I could,” he said.\n\nIn the end, every voter has their own criteria. For younger voters, Pedroia will likely be remembered as one of the best players they saw, one of the centerpiece players of the Red Sox dynasty. Older voters could view him through the prism of Munson’s unsuccessful candidacy.\n\nCrowded ballots will be another obstacle. Pedroia will debut at the same time as Ichiro Suzuki and CC Sabathia with Carlos Beltrán, Andruw Jones, and Billy Wagner as holdovers from last year.\n\nA voter inclined to select a second baseman could look closely at Chase Utley, who received 28.8 percent in his first year on the ballot.\n\nIt’s a subject that intrigues Brewers manager Pat Murphy, who was Pedroia’s coach at Arizona State.\n\n“The leadership and what he meant to the Red Sox has to count for something,” he said. “I hope the voters look at that. He was one of the best players during his time in the majors.”\n\nWhether it’s Murphy, Terry Francona, David Ortiz, Theo Epstein, or others, Pedroia could benefit from others making his case.\n\n“Anybody who votes for me, I’ll be appreciative. That’s how I look at it,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Pedroia is still involved in baseball. As a favor to Murphy, he worked with Brewers outfielder Sal Frelick during the offseason on learning to play the infield.\n\nHe also instructed some Diamondbacks prospects as a favor to manager Torey Lovullo and general manager Mike Hazen, two old friends from his Red Sox days.\n\nPedroia arrived in Boston from Arizona late Wednesday night. On Thursday afternoon, he had his youngest son, Brooks, on the field at Fenway taking grounders.\n\nHis oldest son, 14-year-old Dylan, is already taller than his father. He’s a football and basketball player.\n\nRafael Devers speaks English and is happy to talk baseball informally with reporters. But when it’s for a story or on camera, he prefers to use one of the team translators to make sure his thoughts are expressed correctly.\n\nAt least once or twice a month, an email arrives criticizing Devers for using a translator when he’s on NESN. It’s the usual xenophobic nonsense.\n\nWhat happened in New York on Wednesday night offered some insight why Devers and other Latin-American players are cautious.\n\nRighthander Jorge López of the Mets had a five-star meltdown, getting ejected from the game and throwing his glove into the stands as he left the field. He talked to reporters without a translator after the game and said, “I think I’ve been the worst teammate probably in the whole [expletive] MLB.”\n\nBut it was reported by several outlets that he said, “I think I’ve been on the worse team in probably the whole [expletive] MLB.”\n\nBig difference, right?\n\nMets fans did not take kindly to that, as you might imagine. The team also designated López for assignment, although they said it was not for his comments.\n\nIt’s important to understand that these players are under enormous scrutiny in their native countries. Any misstep by a player from Latin America, Japan, Korea, etc. is big news. So that’s why Devers, at least for now, uses a translator, and nobody should have a problem with that.\n\nA few other observations on the Red Sox:\n\n▪ Will Carroll, a go-to source on injuries, reports the Sox had 555 games lost to injuries through Thursday. Only the Dodgers (600), Rangers (590), and Rays (575) had more. The Tigers (125), Blue Jays (185), and Padres (210) were on the other end of the scale.\n\n▪ Jonathan Papelbon was thrilled to be in the same Sox Hall of Fame class as Dustin Pedroia and Trot Nixon.\n\nHe said one of his first times around Nixon was in spring training of 2005 when he overslept for a trip to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to play the Orioles and left some veterans waiting for him. Nixon, Kevin Millar, and others were all over Papelbon on the long van ride across Florida. But he redeemed himself.\n\nBaltimore pitcher Daniel Cabrera hit Nixon with a pitch. Papelbon, a rookie at the time, retaliated and hit Sammy Sosa.\n\n“It was the worst start of my life,” Papelbon said. “I was on that bus home thinking I needed to find a new job.”\n\nBut the Sox gave him another chance and Papelbon made his debut later that season.\n\n“My whole thing was earning their respect,” he said.\n\n▪ Nixon became emotional discussing his family at the induction, having to pause to collect his thoughts.\n\n“I just wanted to make them proud of me,” he said. “I could never thank them enough.”\n\nNixon decided to pass on a football scholarship to North Carolina State to play for the Red Sox. Now his sons, Chase and Luke, are playing baseball for the Wolfpack and Nixon attends most games.\n\nNixon said the deaths of Tim Wakefield and Dave McCarty hit him hard because of how close the 2004 team was.\n\n“If you put us down in the clubhouse now, we would be back to the same trash talking and making fun of each other,” he said. “We’d pick right back up.”\n\n▪ Elaine Weddington Steward wore her 2018 World Series ring for the ceremony. She has four to choose from, having joined the Red Sox in 1988.\n\nSteward received a loud cheer from the women who work in the front office when she was inducted.\n\n▪ Sign of the times: Mick Jagger made note of the Celtics being in the NBA Finals when the Rolling Stones played Gillette Stadium on Thursday. He also mentioned the six Patriots championships.\n\nAlas, Jagger had nothing to say about the Sox. You can’t always get what you want.\n\n▪ The Braves play at Fenway on Tuesday and Wednesday. But Chris Sale will likely only watch. He was scheduled to start Saturday at Truist Park against Oakland.\n\n▪ Chain O’ Lakes Park, which hosted Red Sox spring training from 1966-92, has been torn down. The ballpark was smack in the middle of Florida in Winter Haven, about halfway between Tampa and Orlando on Lake Lulu. The somewhat famed Orange Dome was on the same site.\n\nWhen the Sox left, Cleveland moved in from 1993-2008 before departing for Arizona.\n\nThe stadium is being replaced by four smaller fields for youth tournaments and some batting cages.\n\nThe first spring training road game I ever covered was a Mets-Indians game in 2003. A snake made its way through the press box at one point, which caused a ruckus.\n\nLater trips included witnessing Hall of Famer Bob Feller getting Joe Torre and Derek Jeter to sign a box of baseballs that he later sold during the game to support The Bob Feller Museum in Van Meter, Iowa.\n\nFeller was 88 at the time and in full uniform and played catch on the field before the game with his grandson.\n\nThe visiting clubhouse appeared to double as a tool shed and the basepaths had as much sand as dirt. It was a dump toward the end. But dozens of Hall of Famers made their way through the ballpark over the years. It was fine for them because nobody knew any better at the time.\n\nAs a writer eager to get started covering baseball, it was a fine introduction to spring training and hurtling across Central Florida to see games that didn’t count.\n\nMajor League Baseball took care of a lingering problem this past week when it finally eased controversial umpire Ángel Hernandez into retirement.\n\nIt was surely no coincidence the story broke in the final hours of Memorial Day as an NBA playoff game was going on. It was a classic news dump designed to spare both Hernandez and the league some embarrassment.\n\nIt didn’t help, as old videos of bad calls by Hernandez quickly flooded social media. That included the three calls he had overturned in Game 3 of the Division Series between the Red Sox and Yankees in 2018.\n\nHernandez was not the worst umpire in the majors. Others have lower grades on balls and strikes. And when his name came up talking to other umpires, there was praise for his charitable works and for being a good teammate.\n\nBut Hernandez was too intransigent about his mistakes and quick to eject those who protested. He seemed intent on making sure everybody knew he was working the game.\n\nIn the end, that’s what got him. Everybody did know his name, and for all the wrong reasons.\n\nAce Adams has been around baseball all his life, much of it as a pitching coach with five colleges and six major league organizations, including the Red Sox. At 71, the Wellesley native is still on the field working with youth players on the travel ball circuit. What he sees across the diamond is troubling. “There’s so much emphasis on how hard you throw instead of how well you pitch,” Adams said. “You should learn how to change speeds, how to compete and minimize damage. But everything is velocity.” He also sees pitchers being overused or not warmed-up properly. “Then you watch big league games and it’s the same thing, throwing as hard as you can. It’s asinine how some coaches use these kids.” Adams has fond memories of being around the Red Sox from 1984-86 as a staff assistant. He worked the radar gun, compiled defensive charts, and threw batting practice. He said being around Tom Seaver in ‘86 felt like a graduate school class in pitching. “Hopefully we get some common sense back in the game,” Adams said. “Too many young kids are getting Tommy John surgery.” . . . Gunnar Henderson had 50 career homers before turning 23. The only other Orioles to do that were Manny Machado, Eddie Murray, and Boog Powell . . . The Padres claimed 25-year-old righthander Jeremiah Estrada off waivers from the Cubs in November. He struck out 28 of 58 batters to open the season, including a major league record 13 in a row going into the weekend. All were swinging. Opponents were 5 of 54. Estrada has thrived with a 97-mile-per-hour four-seam fastball up in the strike zone with a splitter that dives at the plate . . . Kaleb Ort had a 6.27 ERA and 1.70 WHIP in the 47 major league games he pitched for the Red Sox from 2021-23. But teams still remain oddly fascinated with the 32-year-old righthander. Ort finished last season with the Sox then was claimed off waivers by the Mariners on Oct. 13. The Marlins claimed him off waivers on Dec. 1. Then the Phillies claimed him on Feb. 13. The Orioles purchased Ort on Feb. 19 then waived him last week. The Astros then claimed him on Tuesday. That’s six teams in 6½ months. Why? Ort has options, so he can be stashed in the minors and teams like the characteristics of his fastball . . . Anthony Volpe had a 21-game hit streak come to an end Thursday. It was the longest streak for a Yankees player 23 or younger since 22-year-old Joe DiMaggio had a 22-game streak in 1937. DiMaggio also hit 46 homers, scored 151 runs, and drove in 167 that season . . . Andrew Miller retired after the 2021 season and has been largely out of the spotlight since. With good reason, as he was earning an MBA from the University of North Carolina. The lefty, who played for the Red Sox from 2011-14, has two young children. When the timing is right, there’s no job in baseball that would be out of his reach given his intellect, experience, and people skills . . . Happy birthday to two relievers from Texas — lefthander Mike Stanton (57) and righthander Chris Martin (38). Stanton is best known for his time with the Braves and Yankees. But he also appeared in 81 games with the Red Sox from 1995-96 and then one game in 2005. Stanton was a trade-deadline pickup who was traded a year later to Texas. He returned in 2005 in a late-September deal and pitched a scoreless inning against the Yankees in the penultimate game of the season. Stanton appeared in 1,178 games, second all time among pitchers to Jesse Orosco (1,252). He now does television work for the Astros. Martin has played parts of nine seasons with seven teams. He was a Sox minor leaguer from 2011-13 before being traded to the Rockies. He returned as a free agent before the 2023 season and has pitched well since. As you may have heard, he’s not a fan of bunting."
