Active in the Midwest between 1943 and 1954, the league consisted of 15 teams whose players were themselves inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nYou may also like\n\nRevealing Facts About 5 Celebrated Painters\n\n5 Facts About England’s Elizabethan Era\n\nUnforgettable Moments in Baseball History\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nMembers of the Baseball Hall of Fame\n\n346\n\nLength (in games) of Joe DiMaggio’s hitting streak, the longest in history\n\n56\n\nCareer batting average of Ted Williams\n\n.344\n\nJackie Robinson’s jersey number, which was retired by every MLB team\n\n42\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid you know?\n\nJoe DiMaggio wasn’t inducted into the Hall of Fame on his first try.\n\nWhen referring to superlative athletes, we often call them “first-ballot Hall of Famers,” meaning players so exceptional that they’re guaranteed to be inducted in their first year of eligibility. And while Joe DiMaggio is likely to be found on any list of the greatest ballplayers of all time, he wasn’t actually a first-ballot inductee. Or second, for that matter. DiMaggio made it to Cooperstown on his third ballot after retirement, receiving 88.8% of the vote (the minimum requirement being 75%) in 1955.\n\nMore on WWII\n\n7 Things You Forgot Happened During World War II\n\n5 Fascinating Details That “Oppenheimer” Left Out\n\n5 Essential Films About World War II\n\nAuthor Michael Nordine\n\nLove it?15\n\nCopy\n\nShare to email\n\nTwitter\n\nShare to Facebook"
