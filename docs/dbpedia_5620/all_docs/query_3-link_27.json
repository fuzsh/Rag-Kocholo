        "text": "Editor's note: Twice a week during this sports hiatus, we'll answer questions that Bay Area sports fans long have debated in \"Ever Wonder?\" This Thursday: Where did Joe DiMaggio's Bay Area roots stem from?\n\nJoe DiMaggio is Major League Baseball royalty.\n\nThe 13-time All-Star centerfielder spent the entirety of his career as a member of the New York Yankees, but was a native of the Bay Area.\n\nDiMaggio grew up in the San Francisco neighborhood of North Beach, where his father worked as a fisherman on the wharf. Despite his future success as a baseball player, his dad wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.\n\nSafe we say, most of us are glad he didn’t.\n\nBefore he retired from the game in 1951, he would have a historic romance with actress and icon Marilyn Monroe.\n\n[GIANTS INSIDER PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode]\n\nNews\n\nThe Martinez-born legend was also a nine-time World Series champion.\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area’s Kelli Johnson has more on DiMaggio and his Bay Area roots in the video atop the page.\n\nMore from \"Ever Wonder\""
