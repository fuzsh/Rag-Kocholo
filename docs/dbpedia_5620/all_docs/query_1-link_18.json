        "text": "The fans that made the trip to Doubleday Field to watch the sixth Hall of Fame game were able to see some free baseball on July 21, 1947.\n\nThe game featured the Boston Braves and New York Yankees in the first-ever contest in series history to go into extra innings. It was a hotly contested battle featuring some late-inning heroics as the Braves took down the Yankees 4-3.\n\nBoston started the scoring early in the game with a two-run second inning off of Yankees starting pitcher Don Johnson. The damage came on an RBI single by Braves second baseman Connie Ryan, followed by a ground rule double off the bat of shortstop Nanny Fernandez to score Ryan.\n\nThe Braves and Yankees would each add a run later in the game. The Yankees run came in the bottom of the fourth on a solo home run to right-center field by outfielder Johnny Lindell. Boston got a run back in the fifth on a long homer from center fielder Johnny Hopp.\n\nThe game was a pitcherâ€™s duel as the score remained 3-1 with Boston leading heading into the bottom of the ninth.\n\nWith one out in the inning, Lindell and future Hall of Famer Yogi Berra lined back-to-back singles off Braves reliever Ed Wright. The Yankees then scored a run as Braves first baseman Frank McCormick mishandled a hot ground ball down the first base line, allowing Lindell to score.\n\nJoe DiMaggio added a sacrifice fly to center to knot the game up at 3-3 before Wright retired the side.\n\nThe Braves then scored the game-winning run in the top of the 10th inning off Johnson and Wright retired the Yankees in the bottom half of the frame, securing the victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old Johnson acquitted himself well during the outing. He tossed all 10 innings for the Bronx Bombers, giving up only nine hits and four runs while striking out seven.\n\nWright and Braves starter Ernie White combined to give up only three runs on seven hits over the 10 innings.\n\nThe Boston win would mark the fifth win in six years of the series for the Senior Circuit."
