        "text": "If you really know your baseball cards, you probably clicked on this post thinking, “Rachel Robinson has baseball cards?!” After all, despite her exalted status in the baseball world (I consider her Baseball Royalty), Rachel’s cardboard footprint is extremely limited. How limited? To my knowledge she only has a single card. Oh, and I’m talking total population here!\n\nAccording to Trading Card Database, Rachel’s lone card comes from the 2021 Historic Autographs “Famous Americans” set and is a signed 1/1. I’d show it to you, but no photo seems to exist. Either the card’s holder has avoided posting it to the Web, or the card itself is still sitting in a sealed pack somewhere!\n\nSo let’s say you REALLY wanted this Rachel Robinson card, and you were wondering how many packs you might need to buy. Here’s some quick math.\n\nAutographs were inserted in 1 out of 60 packs.\n\nThere are more than 700 different subjects in the autographed insert subset.\n\nMany of the autograph subjects have print runs above 1.\n\nWere it not for the third bullet, a mere 42,000 packs (estimated cost: $150,000) would almost certainly nab you the elusive Rachel Robinson card. However, the third bullet is not one to dismiss as the set includes many names with print runs above 20 (e.g., Jennie Finch/30, Gino Marchetti/23, Bobby Thomson/50, etc.). Therefore, provided Rachel’s card were still out in the wild, you’d more likely need to buy more than 100,000 packs to feel good about pulling it. (On the other hand, you’d have quite a Gino Marchetti collection!)\n\nIf you’re wondering what Rachel’s card might look like, promotions for the set at least offer a clue as the autographed inserts all follow the same design.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable guess for the Robinson card is something like this, the only likely variance coming in what the cut auto itself looks like.\n\nAgain though, there is only one of these in the entire universe, and it literally may never see the light of day, begging the question: If a card is printed that nobody ever pulls, is it really part of the baseball card universe? Think of it as the Hobby version of Schrodinger’s Cat if you like.\n\nFortunately for collectors not looking for deep dives into the quantum realm, 2023 Topps Stadium Club, released earlier this year, offers a far more tenable alternative to Rachel’s 2021 rarity.\n\nSure, it only shows Rachel’s hands, gloves, and skirt, but that’s more of her than you’ll find on the Historic Autographs card, isn’t it? Given that the card image comes from this photo showing Rachel in full, one has to wonder why Topps decided to crop her out.\n\nPerhaps they just wanted a tighter shot of Jackie, but my guess is they lack the rights to depict Rachel on their cards. (This would also explain her absence from other cards, including Topps Now cards of various Jackie Robinson Days where Rachel was on hand for the festivities. Oh, and incidentally, the photo above depicts the first ever Jackie Robinson Day, held in 1947.)\n\nEither way, we can improve quite a bit on the partial cameo offered by Stadium Club. This next card, which comes from the 2005 National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum Education Program set, includes a much better shot of Rachel (as well as Branch Rickey) and may well offer the best option for Rachel Robinson collectors. That said, it’s not a super easy card to find.\n\nYou will also find the same scene (but a different photo) used in the 2015 Topps “The Jackie Robinson Story” subset, though (I believe) the image is in all ways inferior to its 2015 counterpart.\n\nStill, this card represents the best compromise out there as far as A) being easy to find, and B) featuring Rachel prominently. In fact, if those are my two criteria, it’s not only the best of what’s out there but the only card out there! (If there are other Rachel Robinson cameos I’ve overlooked, I hope you’ll let me know in the comments.)\n\n* * * * *\n\nBarring some glaring omission on my part, there are currently no cards where A) Rachel is the primary subject, and B) she is pictured on the card. As such, I used the Rookies app to create a handful of cards for my personal collection and upcoming SABR/IWBC “Women in Baseball” conference talk. (Some examples of these customs appear at the top of this post.)\n\nAs you can see, I made several extra copies of one of them, which I’m happy to send FREE upon request to anyone who attends my presentation. Note that the conference and all presentations will be virtual, meaning there’s no need to travel to Rockford, IL. Here is a link to the conference page, which includes registration information and a complete schedule of events.\n\nWhen I was growing up in Chicago in the 1950s, my favorite team was the White Sox, and my favorite player, along with Minnie Miñoso, was the Sox second baseman, Nellie Fox. Like me, Fox was a little guy. Unlike me, he was also a terrific player: a 15-time All-Star, the 1959 American League Most Valuable Player, and, eventually, a Hall of Famer. Six-plus decades later, I still have the same favorite team, and the same favorite player.\n\nI collected many Nellie Fox baseball cards as a child, and in the ensuing decades I added other collectibles like autographed photos, a Hartland statue, a bobblehead, a framed Sports Illustrated cover and other trinkets. Then a few years ago, I began a quest to collect as many varieties of Fox memorabilia as I could. As many of these items are small and fragile, I have opted to collect them in PSA-graded slabs.\n\nAnd let me tell you, there are many, many Nellie Fox items to be collected. The PSA website, which does not include things like bobbleheads, Hartland Statues and autographed Perez-Steele cards (I have all of those), lists 101 different Nellie Fox “cards”—a category that includes items like stamps, coins, and pins—for the years that Fox was an active player. (Baseball Almanac lists even more Fox items, many of them after Nellie retired as a player in 1965, but I am content to continue on Highway 101.) Of course, the list of 101 Fox items includes stuff like White Sox team cards where no player is identified and you need a magnifying glass to try and determine which one of these guys is Little Nell. It also includes some fairly minute variations.\n\nFor instance, do I really need both a 1956 Topps Fox card with a gray back and one with a white back? Or Red Man tobacco cards both with and without tabs?\n\nMy current answer is: sometimes. To date I have collected 46 of the 101 Fox items on the PSA list, putting me in third place on the PSA Nellie Fox Master List. A collector known as ChiSox Tony leads the list with an awe-inspiring 95 different PSA-certified Fox items. ChiSox Tony, you are my hero.\n\nThe real fascination in a project like this is discovering many different collectibles for the first time. For example, there are the 1961 Chemstrand iron-on patches. The Chemstrand Corporation, which was headquartered in Pensacola, Florida, manufactured products made from synthetic materials such as nylon and rayon. According to the Standard Catalog of Vintage Baseball Cards, “the colorful 2½ diameter patches were included with the purchase of a boy’s sport shirt for a short period in 1961. The patches were issued in a cello package with instructions for ironing it onto the shirt. The package also offered the opportunity to trade the player patch for a different star.” The entire set consisted of only nine players, all but two of whom would later be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. If anyone has a recollection of having one of these patches ironed onto an actual shirt, I’d love to hear about it. (Fortunately, PSA does not consider “ironed on/not ironed on” as variations.)\n\nAnother unusual item was produced by Swift Meats in 1957. This 18-player set consisted of cards featuring perforated body parts of the player—left leg, right arm, shoulder, hips, etc.—that could be punched out to assemble a figurine of the player in an action pose. Nellie’s figurine correctly had his trademark bulge of chewing tobacco in his left cheek, but Swift put Fox’s glove on the wrong (right) hand. Come on, Swift! How the figurine would hold together after assembly is something of a mystery, and the Standard Catalog, which lists prospective prices for unpunched cards only, notes that “Values for assembled figures are problematical.” I personally am content to gaze at Nellie’s unassembled body parts through their plastic PSA prison.\n\nWas there something about Nellie Fox and packaged meats? Along with the 1957 Swift Meats figurine, Nellie’s image was featured in the 20-card set from Wilson Franks in 1954, as well as the 20-player Armour Coins sets which were inserted in packages of hot dogs in 1959 and 1960. (Apparently, Nellie’s taste in wieners was an ever-evolving thing.)\n\nFox’s image also appeared in sets produced by manufacturers of breakfast cereals—the 1961-63 Post (cards) and 1964 Wheaties (stamps) sets; bread (1953 Northland Bread labels); ice cream (1952-53 Dixie Cup lids); Jell-O (1962-63); and milk (1952 Hawthorn-Mellody pins). And, of course, plenty of bubble gum from Bowman (1951-55), Bazooka (1959-60), and the king of them all, Topps (1956-65).\n\nAlso, please don’t forget the popcorn. In 1952, Fox was part of the 72-card set produced by the Berk Ross Company. The late Bob Lemke, the editor and publisher of Sports Collectors Digest, was the first to discover that Berk Ross cards were distributed in bags of popcorn; they were also apparently distributed with gum. In a manner of speaking, Fox appeared twice in the set, as Berk Ross mixed up the fronts and backs of the cards assigned to Nellie and Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ewell Blackwell; each player was identified as the other on the back of their card. “Little Nell,” whose height was charitably listed as five-foot-ten, must have been thrilled to be confused with the six-foot-six inch Blackwell. (In case you’re wondering, I have both cards.)\n\nAfter your Fox-endorsed diet of sugared cereal, hot dogs, popcorn ice cream, Jell-O, bubble gum and milk helped you grow into a healthy adult—hey, it worked for me! —Nellie presumably wanted you to join him in a big chaw of Red Man tobacco (1952-55 card sets).\n\nAlso, please feed your pooch a large serving of Nellie’s favorite, Red Heart Dog Food (1954 card set) … while wearing your rayon Chemstrand shirt with the Nellie Fox iron-on patch, of course (being careful not to cover up your 1960 Nellie Fox Topps Tattoo).\n\nAnd when you take your doggie out for a walk, you’ll be reaching for your 1961 Nellie Fox Baseball Player Key Chain. A word of caution: don’t try paying for any of this stuff with 1962 Topps Baseball Bucks. Or send mail using your 1962 Topps Stamps.\n\nRegarding the man himself: Fox’s last card as an active player came in 1965, when he was listed as a player-coach for the Houston Astros. He got into only 21 games before retiring at the end of July, but he continued to work as a coach for the Astros through the end of the 1967 season; he then worked as a coach under Gil Hodges and Ted Williams through 1972.\n\nAmong the players Nellie mentored was another diminutive (though somewhat more muscular) Astros second baseman named Joe Morgan. In his 1993 autobiography, Morgan wrote about his first encounter with Nellie in spring training in ‘65. Although the two were arguably vying for the same job, Fox approached Joe in the dugout, walked him over to a group of older players on the field, and with his arm around Morgan’s shoulder, said, “Listen, this guy is really special. I’m gonna do the best I can to help him and I want you to do the same.”\n\nNellie was true to his word, helping Morgan with the nuances of second-base play along with other veterans like Eddie Kasko and Bob Lillis. Joe Morgan never forgot Fox’s generosity, and paid tribute to Nellie and the other veterans in his 1990 Hall of Fame speech. I spent most of that season working with Joe and Jon Miller in the ESPN Sunday Night Baseball broadcast booth, and Joe spoke warmly about Nellie on several occasions. He had no idea how good that made me feel.\n\nSadly, Fox died of lymphatic cancer in 1975 at the age of 47. But he remains a beloved player, especially among White Sox fans. And for collectors like me, the variety of Fox memorabilia is pretty staggering, and pretty wonderful. The quest continues. Don’t look back, ChiSox Tony… someone might be gaining on you.\n\nOn the occasion of the great Henry Greenberg’s birthday yesterday, Michael Ellingson posted a terrific 1948 Bowman custom of the Hebrew Hammer with the Pirates.\n\nAs someone who enjoys building “team runs” I was excited to see this card, even as a purely digital construct. Diving into the foggy depths of my cardboard memory banks, I couldn’t recall any playing era Pirates cards of Greenberg, whose lone year with the team was 1947. Then I checked Trading Card Database and realized I forgot about one…maybe. Or did I? [Cue suspenseful music.]\n\nThe 1948 Blue Tint (R346) set is a bit of a mystery for a couple reasons. The first one is that not much is known (or at least documented) surrounding its origin. The Standard Catalog tells us only that the set was issued circa 1948-49—in strips of 6 or 8 cards—and that proof cards with printing on the back indicate the photographer was Al Weinstein of Brooklyn.\n\nThe set’s secondary mystery—or perhaps just quirk—is the checklist. Though all teams are represented except the Senators and (maybe!) Tigers, there is pronounced overrepresentation of New York players, managers, and even coaches. The set also includes a card of Lou Gehrig, who had died in 1941.\n\nAs a final mini-quirk, apart from a Mel Ott manager card that has a “no team” variation, Gehrig and Greenberg have the only two cards in the set that omit team designations.\n\nRecognizing the nearly homemade appearance of the set doesn’t exactly scream “quality first!” the set did demonstrate at least some nods to accuracy. The Leo Durocher card, for example, was updated from Dodgers to Giants following the Lip’s July 1948 change of venue. As Durocher took over for Mel Ott, it’s also likely the team-less Ott variation replaced the Giants version of Ott’s card in the set. There is also a more subtle touch-up we’ll see soon enough.\n\nIf the over-analysis of old baseball card sets is your thing, it’s worth pondering then whether the team omissions for Gehrig and Greenberg were intentional or simply a sign of poor quality control. Notably, there was some question mark as to Greenberg’s status for 1948. In September 1948, as Greenberg was wrapping up his lone season as a Pirate, he stated, “If I do play next year, it won’t be in Pittsburgh.” Imagining now that you were charged with drafting the R346 set in late 1947, how would you approach the Greenberg card? Presumably “no team” would be at least one of your more solid options.\n\nCome February 1948, Hank had signed with the Indians and Bill Veeck, though it was unclear precisely what his role would be. Coach, player-coach, and front office roles were all possibilities. By late March, Greenberg was actually a part-owner of the Tribe, committing to stay in shape just in case he was needed on the diamond but also expressing hopes no such needs would arise. That said, when starting first baseman Eddie Robinson pulled a leg muscle during an April 12 preseason game, Greenberg found himself the team’s first baseman and for a stretch looked like the probable Opening Day starter. Again, we have a tricky situation for the card-makers out there to handle.\n\nWhile ambiguity around Greenberg’s precise role may have contributed to his R346 card’s big blank under his name, another possibility is that the Greenberg and Gehrig cards were simply post-career tributes to two retired superstars who happened to be born and raised in the Big Apple. In such a case the lack of a team designator simply reflected their retired status, something that might also make sense for the Ott variation come July 1948.\n\nOf course if this theory is correct then is the Greenberg R346 card even a Pirates card? The Tigers would certainly make more sense as Detroit was clearly where the slugger played out the bulk of his career. Often where such speculation is concerned, the answer is “we’ll never know.” However, this time, we may have a pretty good clue.\n\nWhether they realized it or not, Heritage Auctions sold this clue in 2015, specifically the R346 source photo!\n\nThere are at least two interesting things to notice about the photograph. First, Greenberg is clearly wearing his Pirates uniform, supporting the card’s conventional classification as a Pirates card. Second, the Pirates logo clearly visible on Hank’s cap in the photograph has been masked for the R346 card.\n\nWhile other interpretations may be correct, my takeaway from the removed Pirates logo is that the makers of the R346 set wanted to portray Greenberg as anything but a Pirate! I believe the Greenberg card has been deliberately refashioned as one of two things:\n\na Detroit Tigers card in recognition of Hank’s great Motown career\n\na Cleveland Indians card to reflect Hank’s newfound home\n\nIn either case, we are lucky to have Michael’s faux 1948 Bowman, as it now becomes the only “playing era-esque” card out there of Hank Greenberg as a Buc! Now all we need is a 1948 Bowman Update card of Greenberg playing first for Cleveland, and the team run is complete!\n\nIn 2023, there are dozens of baseball card sets at every price point. Any major star has thousands of cards available, with hundreds added annually. We can buy most cards we want in just a couple minutes, at a competitive price.\n\nBut 50 years ago, there weren’t nearly as many choices for collectors as there are today. There was the Topps set, sometimes a couple Topps inserts and test issues such as Super or Deckle Edge, and a few food issues such as Milk Duds and Kellogg’s. These sets weren’t made for the organized hobby, which was just as well because there really wasn’t much of an organized hobby in the 70’s.\n\nWhat was the organized hobby in the early-70’s? There were a few thousand adult collectors nationwide. There were a few small card shows in and near major cities, along with a few hobby newspapers. They were invaluable in creating the knowledge base for the hobby. There were a handful of full-time mail-order dealers like Card Collectors Company and Larry Fritsch cards. They advertised through mainstream publications like The Sporting News, and produced their own catalogs that could number up to 100 pages. There were few storefront dealers, and no Internet. The first National Convention would wait until 1979.\n\nTCMA emerged as the first card manufacturer that targeted the organized hobby. TCMA stood for “The Card Memorabilia Associates,” or the initials of the founders, Tom Collier and Mike Aronstein. The company was headquartered in Westchester County, north of New York City .\n\nTheir first sets included the SCFC “Sports Cards for Collectors” 1969 Yankees pictures (see Al Downing below) and an Old-Timers set. The latter set included pen drawings not only of Hall of Famers but forgotten players–that is, forgotten by all but SABR members.\n\n1972 saw the first sets issued under TCMA’s name . They released several reprint sets of vintage issues such as 1887 Allen & Ginter and 1922 American Caramel. They also released the first few series of a set that would number over 500 cards featuring players from the 30’s. To cap it off, they produced a set of the Cedar Rapids Reds in the Class-A Midwest League, the first of hundreds of TCMA minor league team sets over the next 16 years.\n\nThough TCMA would become best known for minor-league sets, their sets featuring vintage players deserve examination. They found a market among serious collectors of the time. Many 70’s collectors wrote away to players for autographs. There weren’t a lot of contemporary cards for stars of the 30’s and 40’s, and many collectors were hesitant to send off vintage cards for autographs for fear of losing them.\n\nEnter TCMA—their sets had a clean design conducive to an autograph, and if they weren’t returned with an autograph at least it wasn’t a 1933 DeLong that was lost to the U.S. Mail or to a former player ambivalent to autograph requests. Many of these sets were designed to feature players who signed through the mail, in fact some dealers sent a list of player addresses along with the cards. This explains why many early TCMA cards offered on Ebay are autographed.\n\nTCMA also offered sets that allowed collectors of modest means to own cards of 19th century players, along with 20th century players who didn’t appear on a lot of cards. One great examples are the 1936–39 Yankees Dynasty set, including not only greats like Gehrig and Lazzeri but journeymen like Paul Schreiber, who appeared in 12 major league games over two generations. What a great find for someone like me who has to have all the players, not just the legends! Others include the 1975 1951 New York Giants set and the 1972 The Yawkey Red Sox set. One of the largest early TCMA sets was the “All Time Greats” postcard issue. The set consists of several 24-card series of attractive black and white postcards. It covered virtually everyone in the Hall-of-Fame including executives like Lee MacPhail, Judge Landis and Will Harridge.\n\nIn 1975 TCMA expanded their offerings. To promote their retro and minor league sets, they produced their first catalog called “Collector’s Quarterly.” Through this catalog, they marketed their first sets of current major leaguers. Those came out under the SSPC (Sports Stars Publishing Company) label. There was a 1975 set for the Mets and Yankees, and then a 660-card set in 1976.\n\nSSPC’s 1976 set was an attempt to challenge the Topps monopoly. They were sold only as a set and only to the hobby. The fronts had no team name or player name—a “pure card” design perfect for autographs. Topps cards had facsimile autographs many years and nothing is more awkward than an authentic autograph written over a fake one.\n\nTopps took notice and went to court to stop the further release of these sets. TCMA was allowed to sell through their stock, which took several years.\n\nSSPC would be heard from after 1976 though. In 1978, team sets were produced as pages in their magazines for several teams. A set of vintage players even appeared in the 1979 and 1982 Yankees yearbooks.\n\nBy the late-70’s, TCMA was becoming better known for minor league sets. TCMA representatives went to minor league general managers with a proposition- TCMA would take pictures of their team, and provide the team sets for sale in their memorabilia stands for free, in exchange for the right to sell team sets in their Collectors Quarterly catalog for $3–3.50 each team. TCMA photographers not only covered players, but sometimes managers, coaches, team executives, trainers, even bat boys and mascots!\n\nBy 1979 dozens of teams had TCMA sets, a number that expanded through the 80’s. By the time TCMA stopped production in the late-80’s, virtually every minor league squad had at least one annual team set, some had as many as three.\n\nTCMA didn’t leave the vintage market. In 1978 and 1979, they produced attractive full color sets of players of the 60’s (in 1978) and the 50’s (in 1979). These sets were from 275–300 cards and featured both legends along with players who had never appeared on a card before. They followed up with a second series of 1960’s in 1981. All three sets are collectible today and not expensive.\n\nTCMA also collaborated with large dealer Renata Galasso on several sets. They co-produced the annual 45-card retro sets included as a bonus with every purchase of current year Topps sets from 1977-84. These attractive sets are known as “Galasso Glossy Greats.”\n\nCollectors were discouraged from pursuing TCMA’s sets by the hobby papers of the time. TCMA sets were considered “illegitimate” and “collector’s issues.” They weren’t considered fully collectible because they weren’t released in packs at candy stores, nor as a premium for another product. Most TCMA cards weren’t licensed by Major League Baseball nor the Players Association, or even the players itself. Nevertheless, TCMA thrived in a time where former players hadn’t monetized their career like today.\n\nIn the late-1980’s TCMA saw a formidable competitor for its minor-league throne, the Pottstown, Pennsylvania based Pro Cards. TCMA continued to release retro cards, but at a slower pace. At the same time Mike Aronstein, the head of TCMA, was acquiring a huge database of player photos and built a successful business providing 8×10 glossy pictures and other player items such as keychains. The TCMA label morphed into PhotoFile, which still markets licensed items for all major sports.\n\nAronstein and TCMA were before their time. TCMA cards aren’t always easy to find but are generally affordable considering their age and print run. Their sets are an important part of the history of the hobby. They deserve a look from every vintage collector and every baseball historian.\n\nAuthor’s Note: This article is part of a larger SABR Century Committee effort commemorating the 75th Anniversary of Jackie Robinson’s historic 1947 season. Head here for the full series.\n\nWhen Jackie Robinson trotted out to first base on April 15, 1947, his steps were no less historic than those of Neil Armstrong just over two decades later. Baseball’s senseless and shameful Color Barrier had at last been breached and with it the customs and traditions of Jim Crow America itself were on notice. This is not to say equality had come to Baseball. Far from it as even the Dodgers merely tiptoed into integration while several other teams waited a decade or more to add their first Black player. As for managers, eleven more men after Armstrong would leave footprints on the Moon before a single Black man would take the reins of a Major League team.\n\nEven today, as Jackie’s legacy is rightfully celebrated, it’s fair to wonder whether a modern Jackie Robinson would even choose Baseball, just as it’s fair to wonder whether any teams would notice him and sign him if he did. Were he living in the Dominican Republic, absolutely, but in his birthplace of Cairo, Georgia, or his childhood hometown of Pasadena, California, who’s to say? While a modern Jackie could win games for a general manager of any color, there are none in front offices today who look like him.\n\nThe same could be said for domestic baseball card issues prior to 1947, only one of which featured a Black player. While it would be easy to discount the utter lack of Black faces as merely reflective of the times, such an explanation fails to account for the many Black boxers who made their way onto trading cards, going back to at least 1909. Ultimately, the whiteness of baseball cards was due solely to the whiteness of what was then perceived (and enforced) as Organized Baseball. Jack Johnson, Joe Jeannette, and Joe Gans were professional boxers. The Philadelphia Stars, Newark Eagles and Homestead Grays meanwhile? These were semi-pro.\n\nThus the 1947 season brought with it not only the integration of Baseball but (several rungs down the ladder of importance) the opportunity to integrate baseball cards as well. All that was missing were the baseball cards themselves!\n\nWhile today we take it for granted that a new baseball card set (if not dozens of different ones) will come out every year, such was not the case in the 1940s. Following the three-year run of Gum, Inc., and its Play Ball sets from 1939-41, the War and other national priorities left American baseball without a major set to chronicle its players until 1948, when Gum, Inc., baseball cards returned to shelves, this time under the Bowman name.\n\nIn the meantime, where baseball cards were produced at all, they most often took the form of smaller regional issues, often connected to food or other household products, cards that today many collectors classify under the umbrella of “oddball.” As such, this review of Jackie Robinson baseball cards from 1947 will feature bread, slacks, and even cigarettes but not a single stick of gum.\n\n1947 BOND BREAD\n\nBond Bread will feature in this article twice. This first instance is to highlight a 48-card release comprised of four boxers and 44 baseball stars. The selection of baseball stars included Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Stan Musial but most notably a baseball card of Brooklyn Dodgers rookie Jackie Robinson.\n\nCards were packaged in loaves of Bond Bread, and at least one theory for their rounded corners is that the cards were less susceptible to damage that way. Importantly for collectors today, the rounded corners help distinguish these cards from near-identical versions that emerged as a standalone product sold as “Sport Star Subjects” in 1949. The square cornered versions are far less collectible, though widespread misidentification, including by a prominent grading company, has created sufficient confusion to elevate prices among uninformed buyers.\n\nWhile both the Bond Bread and Sport Star Subjects cards have blank backs, a third version of the Robinson card features a back that’s anything but blank.\n\n“1947” ELGEE PRODUCTS\n\nPrecise dating for this issue is unknown and may well be after 1947. A mix of baseball and movie star photos, the baseball images match those of the Bond Bread issue but are easily distinguished in at least two ways. One, they are perforated. Two, their backs include other cards from the set or, in some cases, advertising. The Robinson card, for example, features actor James Cagney on the reverse.\n\nAs with the Sport Star Subjects, these cards are also frequently misidentified as Bond Bread cards, even by third party grading companies and auction houses. Post 391 in this Net54 Baseball Forum thread shows the front and back of an uncut sheet, including the ELGEE branding. Post 386 in the same thread provides additional background on the company.\n\n1947-50 BOND BREAD JACKIE ROBINSON\n\nIn addition to the 48-card set above, Bond Bread also released a second set of 13 cards dedicated entirely to Jackie Robinson. The set is catalogued as a 1947 issue. However, independent research by collectors Mike Knapp, Shaun Fyffe, and Michael Fried, which I’ll attempt to summarize here, has produced a broader timetable for the cards while also providing information on distribution.\n\nThe set began 1947 with a single card featuring a signed portrait of Jackie, a brief bio, and a product testimonial. This card was not distributed in packaged loaves but rather was given out by store owners (with free slices of bread!) to promote Bond Bread among African American consumers. (Post 49 in this Net54 Baseball Forum thread includes an article from the New York Amsterdam News detailing the marketing strategy.)\n\nFrom there, it’s unclear whether any of the set’s remaining twelve cards dates to 1947. The aforementioned collector-researchers speculate subsequent releases of three or six cards at a time taking place sometime between 1947 and 1950, though I lean more toward the cards being issued one at a time. Either way, a clue that helps group the cards is the advertising on the back.\n\nThese six cards, assumed to be the earlier of the twelve, exhort consumers to eat the same bread as Jackie. Fielding poses show a first baseman’s mitt, which Jackie would have used primarily in 1947.\n\nBefore proceeding to the second group of six, I want to highlight two photos in particular, one of which may be very familiar to non-collectors. Though the background has been removed and Jackie has even changed teams, the card of Jackie waving with his glove draws its image from this iconic photograph.\n\nA second card among the six does some early “photoshopping” of a Montreal photo as well.\n\nMuch later in this article we will see yet another occasion where a Montreal photo is doctored for use on a Brooklyn card. For now, we will return to the other six cards in the set. Note here that all fielding poses show a standard infielder’s glove.\n\nThe “smoking gun” that places these cards (or at least one of them) after 1947 comes from the image on the last card, believed to source to a photograph taken just after this one. (Note Jackie’s cap has fallen a bit farther on the card and his body has separated more from his trailing arm.) If so, the card could not have been issued any earlier than July 2, 1949, the date the photograph was taken.\n\nWith the set no longer confined entirely to 1947, we arrive at several possibilities for its overall release schedule. Barring further information, I’d be inclined to settle on the first group of six cards coming out across the six months of the 1948 baseball season and the second group of six following suit in 1949.\n\n“1948” OLD GOLD CIGARETTES\n\nThe situation with Jackie’s Old Gold cards is precisely the opposite as here collectors regard what may be two cards from 1947 as if they came out the following year.\n\nAs Anson Whaley notes in his article for Sports Collectors Daily, two clues on the card backs suggest a 1947 release.\n\nRobinson is listed as 28 year old, which was only his age through January 30, 1948\n\nHis 1947 Rookie of the Year Award (announced September 19, 1947) is not listed among his career highlights\n\nCertainly each of these clues could merely point to bios written ahead of time, hence do not point definitively to a 1947 release of the actual cards. Still, absent any information affirming a 1948 release, the clues are at least intriguing.\n\n“1947″ PLEETWOOD SLACKS\n\nContinuing the theme of uncertain dates is this rare 5″ x 8″ promotional issue from Pleetwood Slacks. While catalogued as a 1947 issue, I am unable to find any source that provides independent corroboration. Notably, the Standard Catalog of Vintage Baseball Cards indicates that “the [1947] date of issue cited is conjectural.”\n\nWhen I do find “hits” on Pleetwood Slacks, never mind Jackie, they only come in the Black press of late 1948, specifically October through December. Here is a typical example.\n\nPerhaps information is out there somewhere establishing the Pleetwood Slacks card as a 1947 issue. In the meantime I’d just as soon date it to late 1948 where timing it’s would better match the print advertising campaign for the brand.\n\n1947 CHAMP HATS\n\nCollector and Hobby historian Bob Lemke (1941-2017) featured this 8 x 10 “card” as a new find on his blog in 2015.\n\nAs detailed on Bob’s blog, both Bob and the previously mentioned Sean Fyffe regarded 1947 as the most likely year for this piece.\n\n1947 DODGERS TEAM PHOTO PACK\n\nMany teams sold photo packs of their players and other personnel, going back to at least the 1930s. The 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers photo pack consisted of 25 photos, 6” x 9” in size, including this one of Jackie Robinson.\n\nThe image is a sharper and cleaner version of the ones used on his Bond and faux Bond issues and a reminder that many cards of the era used photos provided by the teams or their photographers. Furthermore, the presence and identical placement of Jackie’s signature on the Bond and pseudo-Bond cards leads me to wonder if those cards didn’t originate from the original photograph but from this photo pack card. Either way, I suspect the photo pack Jackie is the earliest of his various 1947 issues.\n\n1947-66 EXHIBIT SUPPLY COMPANY\n\nOne of the most common and (formerly!) affordable early baseball cards of Jackie Robinson is his 1947-66 Exhibit Supply Company (Chicago, IL) postcard-sized issue. However, despite “1947” right there in the naming of the set, there is no evidence that Jackie’s exhibit cards date back that far.\n\nRather, the “1947-66” label simply means that the overall set of 300+ different cards spanned 20 years. The presence of later stars such as Aaron, Banks, and Kaline suffice to show that “1947” hardly applies to all players.\n\nThe Keyman Collectibles site provides a guide for the precise dating of Exhibit cards. Having reviewed more than a dozen so far, I have not yet run across a Robinson any earlier than 1948.\n\nSide note: A 1948 release would have left plenty of time to find pictures of Jackie as a Dodger. However, the photograph used on the Exhibit card, as was the case with two of the Bond Bread cards, dates to 1946, as evidenced by Jackie’s Montreal uniform.\n\nSUMMARY: THE JACKIE ROBINSON CARDS OF 1947\n\nAll told I’ve reviewed 22 different Jackie Robinson cards correctly or incorrectly associated with his Barrier Breaking debut season in Brooklyn. From this number, there are only three where I believe the 1947 dating is firmly established:\n\n1947 Bond Bread multi-player set\n\n1947 Bond Bread Jackie Robinson set – portrait with facsimile autograph\n\n1947 Brooklyn Dodgers photo pack\n\nFor the reader only reasonably acquainted with the world of collectibles, it might seem a tame question to then ask which of these cards is Jackie Robinson’s rookie card. Could it really be that the answer is none of them!\n\nEPILOGUE: JACKIE’S ROOKIE CARD\n\nModern collectors focus heavily (if not obsessively!) over the notion of a rookie card, particularly when the player concerned is a Hall of Famer. In a simpler world, a player would have one card for each year of his career, and the first such card would be his rookie card. In the real world, however, the situation is far murkier, complicated by any number of wrinkles, depending on the collector.\n\nFor example, any of the following may be treated as a disqualifying when it comes to rookie card status.\n\ncards that pre-date a player’s major league status (e.g., a minor league card)\n\ncards from minor, regional, unlicensed, or non-US releases\n\ncards that aren’t really baseball cards (e.g., a postcard, mini-poster, or bobblehead)\n\ncards with uncertain release dates\n\nIn the case of Jackie Robinson, all four of these come into play. While I did not feature it in this article due to its 1946 issue date, there is a highly sought after Parade Sportive newspaper insert featuring Jackie Robinson, which checks off each of the first three bullets above.\n\nAs for Jackie’s Bond Bread cards, many collectors regard the releases as too minor to warrant rookie card status. Add to that for many of them an uncertain release date as well. Ditto for Elgee Products, Old Gold Cigarettes, Pleetwood Slacks, and Champs Hats, with the latter two having only questionable baseball card status as well.\n\nThe Brooklyn photo pack card, which may well be first of Jackie as a Dodger, also challenges the most rigid definitions of “baseball card” while adding the potential disqualifier of a regional release. Finally, the Exhibit card is not quite a real baseball card to many collectors while also carrying uncertainty as to dating.\n\nAlso lacking card status to most collectors are the various Jackie Robinson buttons and pins that were popular among fans in the late 1940s. I omitted lengthier treatment in this article but will show six of them here.\n\nThe result of all this is that many collectors would not consider any of the Jackie Robinson cards profiled so far to be Jackie’s rookie card. Instead, the coveted label is most often applied to Jackie’s card from the set known popularly in the Hobby as 1948 Leaf.\n\n“This is the only true rookie card of baseball’s first African-American representative and hero to all,” according to PSA, the Hobby’s largest grader and authenticator of trading cards.\n\nThough my revenue, Hobby or otherwise, is a far cry from that of PSA, I nonetheless challenge this assertion. For one thing, despite the typical designation of the set as “1948 Leaf” (or sometimes 1948-49 Leaf), there are compelling reasons to believe the Robinson card (if not the entire set) dates to 1949.\n\n1949 copyright date on the back of the card\n\nReference to Jackie’s 1948 statistics as “last season” on the back of the card\n\nStandard Catalog entry indicating the set was “produced by Chicago’s Leaf Gum Co. for issue in 1949”\n\nHall of Fame and Beckett cataloguing of card as 1949\n\nErroneous dating aside, I’ll also note that the Leaf cards, at least of some players, were unlicensed, which can often be a rookie card disqualifier. That said, collectors tend to give the set a free pass on this point.\n\nAt any rate, if we regard the Leaf card as a rookie card, we should then confer rookie status on Jackie’s other significant release of the same year, issued as part of the 1949 Bowman set of 240 cards.\n\nAlternatively, we might turn our attention to a card that genuinely does date to 1948, Jackie’s Sport Thrills card from Swell Bubble Gum.\n\nFrom a rookie card perspective, this card beats Leaf and Bowman by a year, has unambiguous baseball card status as opposed to some of the other 1947-48 contenders, and originates from a more major release than its contemporaries and predecessors. At the same time, not all collectors treat the Sport Thrills set as major enough, and its focus on highlights rather than players equally reduces the appeal.\n\nUltimately, the question of Jackie’s true rookie card is a complicated one, confounded by the uncertain or erroneous dating of his early cardboard and curiously subjective notions like “major release” and “baseball card.” On one hand the lack of a definitive rookie card opens the door for individual collectors to apply their own criteria and judgment. On the other hand, the same fuzziness creates opportunities, intentional or accidental, to misrepresent and misinform. In the end, perhaps the only truism when it comes to Jackie’s rookie cards is this: If you have to ask, you can’t afford it!\n\nThere are many directions that one could go with this topic, two of which have already been well covered by SABR Baseball Cards authors and two of which would be very welcome here.\n\nCards of players who “made the jump” from the Negro Leagues to the National or American League\n\nHow Topps, Bowman, and Leaf reported the Negro Leagues experience of such players\n\nEarly sets from Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela featuring Black baseball players\n\nUltra-rare, early US issues such as the 1952 Indianapolis Clowns or 1931 Harrison Studios postcards\n\nThis article, however, will look at the first widely available baseball cards produced in the United States to showcase Negro Leaguers as Negro Leaguers. In other words, a card of Satchel Paige as a Cleveland Indian (1949 Bowman, 1949 Leaf) or St. Louis Brown (1953 Topps) would not qualify while a card of Satchel Paige as a Kansas City Monarch most definitely would. Should a working definition of “widely available” prove helpful, take it to mean there is nearly always at least one card from the set available on eBay.\n\nHall of Fame postcards (1971 to present)\n\nI’ll leave it to readers individually to decide whether to count postcards as baseball cards. If you are in the “no” camp, feel free to skip this first entry. If you are in the “yes” camp then we’ll kick things off with the postcards issued and updated annually by the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile one could quibble that more than half the text on the Paige card, first issued in July 1971, relates to his post-Negro Leagues career, I’ve chosen to count this postcard because A) Paige was selected by a special committee on the Negro Leagues, and B) he is not shown in an Indians, Browns, or Athletics uniform. The Gibson postcard, which carries no such ambiguity, was first issued in July 1972, as was a similar postcard of teammate Buck Leonard.\n\n1974 Laughlin Old-Time Black Stars\n\nBob Laughlin, also known for several collaborations with Fleer, independently produced this 36-card set in 1974. At time of issue, Satchel Paige (1971), Josh Gibson (1972), and Buck Leonard (1972) were the only Hall of Famers in the set. (Cool Papa Bell was inducted in 1974 but after the set was released.) Now an impressive 22 of the 36 cards in the set depict Hall of Famers, with all 14 of the remaining presenting compelling cases for enshrinement.\n\n1975-76 Great Plains Greats\n\nThanks to Ted Chastain in the reader comments for identifying this 42-card set. Per the Standard Catalog the cards were produced by the Great Plains Sports Collectors Association. Cards 1-24, which includes Cool Papa Bell, were produced in 1975 and sponsored by Sheraton Inns. Cards 25-42 were produced the following year and sponsored by Nu-Sash Corp.\n\n1976 D&S Enterprises Cool Papa Bell\n\nIn 1976 John Douglas of D&S Enterprises issued a 13-card set in conjunction with and James “Cool Papa” Bell, who was the subject of the set.\n\nInterestingly, one of the cards in the set is a “card of a card” featuring Bell’s 1974 Laughlin card, updated with facsimile autograph.\n\n1976 Laughlin Indianapolis Clowns\n\nA second Laughlin set of note is his 42-card 1976 Indianapolis Clowns issue, mostly coveted by collectors today for its card of a young Henry Aaron.\n\nOther notables in the set include Satchel Paige, Oscar Charleston, and basketball legend Goose Tatum.\n\n1976 Shakey’s Pizza\n\nIn 1975 pizza chain Shakey’s issued a small 18-card set of Hall of Famers, followed up in 1976 by a much larger set featuring all 157 members of the Hall (and a second Robin Roberts card) in order of their induction. The latter set therefore included several Negro League stars: Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Monte Irvin (New York Giants photo), Cool Papa Bell, Judy Johnson, and Oscar Charleston.\n\nNot counting the Hall of Fame’s own postcards, which may or may not be regarded as baseball cards by some collectors, I believe this Shakey’s set is the very first to feature both “traditional” (i.e., white) major leaguers and Negro Leaguers on its checklist.\n\n1978 Laughlin Long-Ago Black Stars\n\nFour years after his initial Negro Leagues set, Laughlin produced a sequel, employing a similar design. Aside from a brand new checklist of 36 cards, the most evident updates were the replacement of “Old-Time” with “Long-Ago” and a greenish rather than brownish tint.\n\n1978 Grand Slam\n\nThis 200-card set may have been produced with autographs in mind as (I believe) all 200 of the early baseball stars it featured were still living at the time the set was planned. While nearly one-fourth of the set featured current or future Hall of Famers, there was no shortage of lesser stars such as Bibb Falk and Ed Lopat. The set even included an outfielder with a lifetime OPS of .182.\n\nMore to the point, the set included cards of Negro Leaguers Buck Leonard, Judy Johnson, and Cool Papa Bell.\n\n1980-87 SSPC Baseball Immortals\n\nWhen initially issued in 1980, this SSPC set included all 173 Hall of Famers, i.e., the Shakey’s Pizza roster plus the 16 players inducted between 1977 and 1980. As such, it included the same Negro Leaguers as the Shakey’s set but also added Martin Dihigo (1977) and Pop Lloyd (1977).\n\nFollowing the initial release, SSPC updated the checklist multiple times through 1987 to include the Hall’s more recent inductees. As such, cards of Negro Leaguers Rube Foster (1981) and Ray Dandridge (1987) were subsequently added to the set.\n\nP.S. No, I don’t really know what’s happening on that Foster card, and don’t even get me started on the Josh Gibson!\n\n1982 “TCMA” Baseball Superstars\n\nTwo different “Baseball Superstars” sets were produced in 1980 and 1982 that may or may not have been produced by TCMA. (Andrew Aronstein, son of TCMA co-founder Mike Aronstein, believes the cards were sold by TCMA but not produced by TCMA. The Standard Catalog notes the cards were probably produced by Card Collectors Closet in Springfield, MA.) The second of these sets included a lone Satchel Paige card on its 45-card multi-sport checklist.\n\n1983 Sporting News 1933 All-Star Game 50th Anniversary\n\nThis 60-card set was released by Marketcom to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first All-Star Game, and it’s first 48 cards featured the 32 players from the American and National League All-Star rosters plus various other players of the era such as Johnny Hodapp and Chick Fullis. Likely in recognition of the first East-West Game, also in 1933, the final dozen cards in the set consisted of Negro League greats selected by the Sporting News.\n\nThese same twelve Negro Leaguers would be reappear in their own 1933 All-Star tribute set in 1988.\n\n1983 ASA Bob Feller\n\nASA was a big name in the early 1980s when it came to single player tribute sets, with Bob Feller the subject of one of its 1983 offerings. Card 5 in the twelve-card set includes a cameo by future teammate Satchel Paige in his Kansas City Monarchs uniform.\n\nNote that a “red parallel” of the card (and entire set) exists as well.\n\n1983 Donruss Hall of Fame Heroes\n\nIn 1983, Donruss augmented its slate of Hobby offerings to include a 44-card “Hall of Fame Heroes” set. While the majority of the set featured National and American League stars, it was notable at the time for being the first “mainstream” card set to include Negro League legends.\n\nCool Papa Bell and Josh Gibson are the two unambiguous Negro Leaguers in the set, and I would further count Satchel Paige in spite of his St. Louis Browns uniform.\n\nCollectors hoping to get even more of artist Dick Perez’s talents applied to the Negro Leagues would be in luck the following year.\n\n1980-2001 Perez-Steele Postcards (sorted in this article as 1984)\n\nBeginning in 1980, the Perez-Steele Galleries issued a set of 245 postcards over the course of 22 years. The first of the releases to include Negro Leaguers was Series Five in 1984, which included Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Cool Papa Bell, and Judy Johnson. (The same series also included Satchel Paige as a Cleveland Indian and Monte Irvin as a New York Giant.)\n\n1984 Decathlon Negro League Baseball Stars\n\nApart from the copyright line, this set is identical to its far more plentiful reproduction in 1986 by Larry Fritsch.\n\nConsisting of 119 cards, it would take nearly four decades for a set to provide more Negro Leagues firepower than this one.\n\n1985 Decathlon Ultimate Baseball Card Set\n\nDecathlon returned the following year with a 15-card set of baseball legends, highlighted by Josh Gibson.\n\nIn addition thirteen white players, the set also included a “second year” card of Moses Fleetwood Walker.\n\nIf the artwork looks familiar, it was done by Gerry Dvorak of 1953 Topps fame.\n\n1986 Larry Fritsch Negro Leagues Baseball Stars\n\nHere is the aforementioned reissue of Decathlon’s 1984 offering, still available from Larry Fritsch Cards. I believe you can also pick up a set in person at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum gift shop.\n\n1987 Dixon’s Negro Baseball Greats\n\nSalute to historian, author, and Negro Leagues Baseball Museum co-founder Phil Dixon, whose 45-card set was the first ever set of baseball cards produced by an African American.\n\nPhil also worked with the Ted Williams Card Company on its Negro Leagues subsets in 1993 and 1994.\n\n1988 Hardee’s\n\nIn addition to Charles Conlon photographs of five white major leaguers, this six-card set also included a card of Cool Papa Bell.\n\nThough the small print on the Bell’s card suggests a Conlon photograph, it should be noted that Charles Conlon passed away in 1945 while Bell did not become the manager of the Monarchs until 1948.\n\n1988 Pittsburgh Negro League Stars\n\nThis 20-card set, highlighted on the SABR Baseball Cards blog in 2020, was given to fans by the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 10, 1988. Biographical information on the card backs comes from historian Rob Ruck.\n\nBefitting a Pittsburgh-themed set, nearly all subjects are Crawfords or Grays, though there are some exceptions such as Monte Irvin.\n\n1988 World Wide Sports 1933 Negro League All Stars\n\nThis 12-card set features the same twelve Negro Leaguers as the 1983 Marketcom set and also shares a common theme, that of the inaugural All-Star Game (or East-West Game). Additionally, many of the cards use identifcal source images apart from differences in cropping. However, this set is a standalone Negro Leagues set whereas the 1983 set included 48 players from the white major leagues.\n\n1989 Historic Limited Edition Negro Leagues Postcards\n\nThis set of 12 postcards features the artwork of Susan Rini. Total production was 5000 sets.\n\n1989 Sportflics\n\nThe 225-card set from Sportflics did not include any Negro Leaguers, focusing instead on contemporary players and prospects.\n\nHowever, each pack included one of 153 small inserts known as “The Unforgetables” and featuring a Hall of Famer.\n\nAmong the players included in this insert set were Josh Gibson, Pop Lloyd, Buck Leonard, Rube Foster, Martin Dihigo, Oscar Charleston, Cool Papa Bell, Satchel Paige, and Monte Irvin.\n\n1990 Eclipse Stars of the Negro Leagues\n\nI’ll finish the article with this attractive 36-card mini-box set from Eclipse, whose other offerings included the Iran-Contra Scandal, the Drug Wars, and the Savings and Loan Scandal.\n\nThe Negro Leagues set itself wasn’t scandal-free as it managed to confuse its two best players!\n\nPOSTSCRIPT\n\nCounting the Hall of Fame postcards that began this article, we’ve now looked 20 years of Negro League baseball cards. Though the numbers of cards and sets may have been more than you imagined for this period from 1971-90, it’s fair to say that nearly all such sets might warrant the “oddball” label. Notably, we saw nothing at all from the biggest name in all of baseball cards, Topps.\n\nThe omission of Negro Leaguers by Topps could certainly be seen as a sign that Topps deemed these players unworthy of their precious cardboard. To an extent I buy the argument, but I’ll also counter with the fact that Topps operated “by the book” when it came to licensing, permissions, etc. I suspect many of the sets profiled in this article provided no financial compensation to the players or estates involved, meaning their honoring of the Negro Leagues may have been part celebration but also part exploitation. If so, perhaps Topps deserves kudos for not following suit.\n\nThough I may have overlooked a card or set somewhere, I believe the first Topps Negro League cards appeared in 2001, most prominently as part of a “What Could Have Been” series.\n\nThough unintentional, the set led off with a “what could have been” to top them all: Josh on the Kansas City Monarchs. Such would surely end all greatest team ever debates right here and now!\n\nIn case you missed it, SABR Baseball Cards Research Committee co-chair Nick Vossbrink published his “On Thinking about What Makes a Card a Card” piece a couple weeks ago, offering readers and collectors a framework for thinking about cardness.\n\nIn the comments I referenced a particular card (or non-card) genre likely unknown to much of our readership, so I thought a full blog post might be a better way to keep up the “what makes a card a card” (WMACAC) conversation.\n\nLast year Topps launched Project 2020, in which twenty renowned artists, typically from the non-sports universe (e.g., fashion, jewelry, street art) put their spin on twenty classic Topps rookie* cards.\n\nI put an asterisk because the Ted Williams, Willie Mays, and Jackie Robinson cards were simply first Topps cards (FTC), the Nolan Ryan was his first solo card, and the McGwire has its own debate surrounding it. One could perhaps quibble over Update set XRCs as well, and of course the Mariano Rivera is a Bowman. Still, you get the idea!\n\nEarly cards in the set tended to stay very true to the original RC, as shown by my Tyson Beck card of Dwight Gooden, which was card 12 of the 400 cards that made up the set. Later cards tended to drift a bit more as the artists took greater and greater license. For example, my Efdot Dwight Gooden, which was card 137 overall, retains none of the design elements of the 1985 Topps set but more than makes up for it with its timely tribute to healthcare workers.\n\nOne of my favorite cards in the set is the Efdot Sandy Koufax card, which deviates considerably from the layout and design of the original Topps classic but retains enough elements to be clearly derivative. (In general, this was my personal “sweet spot” for the project: very different from the original but not wholly unrelated.)\n\nIf we stop here and ask, “Is this a baseball card?” I have to imagine a nearly universal answer of yes. Granted, it might not be a card you collect personally, and it’s clearly not a card from Koufax’s playing career. However, it checks off nearly every category of cardness.\n\nStandard baseball card dimensions of 2-1/2″ x 3-1/2″ (though it’s thicker than your typical card at 130 points, or roughly the same thickness of a pack of 1982 Topps)\n\nProfessional baseball player depicted on the front, along with name, position (it’s there, trust me!), and team\n\nIssued by Topps and fully licensed\n\nNon-blank back, though no stats are provided. Instead, we get a small write-up of the set itself and the artist who designed the card.\n\nWhere baseball cardness gets more interesting is with the collections of art pieces many of the artists issued independently as companion cards to their Topps releases. Unlike their official Project 2020 cards, these cards were neither produced by Topps nor licensed by MLB, MLBPA, or the representatives of any retired players.\n\nAs an example, here is Efdot’s Left Arm of Blob, based on a turtle-like Blob character Efdot uses in his murals and other designs.\n\nThis companion card has many features suggestive of Sandy Koufax. Among them are the left-handed pitching motion, the stylistic nod to Jewish artist Marc Chagall, and a healthy dose of Dodger Blue, even if non-exact. On the other hand, I don’t think many baseball fans would regard Blob as a dead ringer for Mr. Koufax. Furthermore, there is no name, team, or logo to assist.\n\nIf we accept the idea that even a generic baseball player is enough to establish baseball cardness then Left Arm of Blob definitely gets my vote for being a baseball card, even lacking the imprimatur of a card-making goliath like Topps, Upper Deck, or Panini. However, I believe a more fun question to ask is whether Left Arm of Blob is a Sandy Koufax baseball card.\n\nWhile the answer is likely no on a technical level, I have always been of the mindset that the collector is always right. As such, I do consider Left Arm of Blob a welcome addition to my Sandy Koufax collection, primarily for two reasons. First, the card is clearly Koufax-inspired (or at least Koufax card-inspired). Second, the card was specifically designed to go right next to the real Sandy.\n\nI know many collectors these days who prefer not to decide such matters for themselves but prefer to see how the Hobby establishment opines. For example, will we see Left Arm of Blob in PSA’s Koufax “super set” or as an entry on Trading Card Database’s Koufax pages? And before you say, “No chance!” to the former, here is a Babe Ruth card from PSA’s Bambino master set, batting righty no less!\n\nThough there is precedent for nearly everything new in the Hobby, I’ll offer that the idea of a companion card is at least new enough in today’s consciousness to preclude consensus. However, many of this year’s Topps Project 70 artists are producing and distributing companion cards, meaning we will soon have a much larger sample size on which to equivocate. We will also be forced to reckon with companions as “a thing” rather than some flukey one-off that only happened in the weirdest year of our lives.\n\nIn the grander scheme, what we do know is that Left Arm of Blob is simply one of many novel card-ish objects that will continue to defy or at least challenge classification as the Hobby evolves into the future. Whatever boundaries we establish, save none at all, will be pushed for at least as long as imagination and innovation continue to assert a place in the Hobby. Any fuzziness and inconvenience that arise should be considered far better than the alternative!\n\nOne of the few editorial positions we have on this blog is a very catholic stance toward what counts as a baseball card. We’ve published posts about photos, toys, games, stamps, coins, etcetera, all of which serve to flesh out and describe the way that we collected cards. We’re not interested in being gatekeepers for what cards are. We’re interested in use and how cards relate to our fandom and interest in the game itself.\n\nAll that said, the discussion about what constitutes a card is one that comes up periodically on Twitter or on here.* It’s a fun discussion to have since we all have very different ideas** which in turn impact our collections and interests. I enjoy taking part in these discussions but I really love just watching them since the criteria people bring up have turned out to all over the map.\n\n*Probably also in the Facebook group but as I’m no longer part of that website I’m unable to confirm as much.\n\n**Quite similar to the “what constitutes a complete set” discussion we had earlier on this blog.\n\nWe all, of course, have significant agreement on what a card is. But there are so many variables where an item can deviate from being a card™ that I found myself creating a taxonomy of card attributes. Looking at cards with these attributes in mind is something I’ve found helps me understand why my gut reacts to different products the way it does.\n\nThis post will explain my thinking and hopefully help other people put words to things their guts have already intuited. Again, this is in no way intended to be a gatekeeping thing. We all have different reactions to which attributes we care about and where on the spectrum something stops being a card. But if the Twitter conversations have taught me anything it’s that being our most interesting conversations are when we’re being positive about our definitions rather than negative about someone else’s.\n\nMaterial\n\nWe’ll start with the obvious and discuss the material of the card. Obviously the expectation is that they be made of cardboard. They are called “cards” after all.\n\nBut cards have never been limited to just that. From the silks and blankets in the pre-war era to the plastic, metal, and wood releases of the modern era we’ve always had cards that weren’t made of cardboard. We’ve had stamps, stickers (some made of cloth), rub-offs, rub-downs, and decals as well.\n\nEven in the cardboard/paper realm there’s also a discussion with having about the thickness of the paperstock. We’ve had posts on the blog about cards printed on newsprint and cards which are almost a quarter of an inch thick.\n\nSize\n\nIn general tobacco-sized to 3.5″×5″ seems to have a consensus as being a card. But what about 5″×7″ or 8.5″×11″? What about minis and micros that are smaller than tobacco cards? What about posters and pin-ups?\n\nA lot of this comes back to storage concerns and the way many of us use binders and binder pages to organize our collections. But it’s more than that too. For most of us, “card” indicates something from the business card to postcard size and anything beyond that becomes something else. Too small and the card starts to feel insignificant. Too large and it becomes something else—a photo, a poster, a flyer.\n\nForm\n\nThis is sort of related to size but refers to non-rectangular items like discs and diecuts but also encompasses folders, booklets, and pop-ups as well as coins, poker chips, and buttons. Many of these are binderable. Just as many lose what makes them distinct and interesting as soon as they get bindered.\n\nThe items which aren’t binderable at all are especially interesting here. Things like the 1957 Swift Meats diecut paper dolls or those Topps 3-D Baseball Stars from the 1980s are clearly intended to be like cards but do not fit into any standard card storage or presentation systems.\n\nContent\n\nThe question of what makes a card a card is more than just the physical description of what it’s made of and what shape it is. What it actually depicts is also important. Yes, picture on the front, stats/bio on the back is the expectation. But there are a lot of cards out there which don’t do this.\n\nWe’re not just talking about blank backs either although those are definitely relevant to this category. Backs that are advertising, common designs, or just a player name are all part of this. The same goes with fronts that depict a generic player instead of someone specific.\n\nAnd for my money, all the more-recent relic, autograph, or online cards with backs that are functionally blank fit in here as well. I’ve seen way too many people refer to them as “half a card” to not mention them.\n\nRelease\n\nNo images for this section because it’s not something that can really be depicted visually. Traditionally, cards are part of a set and are released in either packs or complete sets. Cards that exist by themselves without the context of a set or the lottery of a pack stray into a grey area. This is something that’s really been pushed into new territory with online releases and the way Topps has in many ways optimized its distribution around selling and creating individual items on demand, but the idea of one-off card releases has been around a long time.\n\nThere’s also the discussion here about what connotes a set—both in terms of size and how things are numbered. At what point does a release of cards become a “set”? If something is unnumbered or only has a weird alphanumeric code on the back does that mean that it was intended to be collected by itself?\n\nCase Studies\n\nWhy do I bother thinking and categorizing different attributes? Because as I watch the discussions it seems that most of us tolerate a certain amount of variance in one or two categories as long as the others remain “standard.” So let’s dig in.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nLet’s start with 1969 Topps Deckle Edge. These are pretty clearly cards but they serve as an example of something that sort of fails one of the categories because the backs are non-existent. But as you move from card size to 5″x7″ to 8″x10″, more and more people switch from treating them as cards to treating them as photos.\n\nOr look at Broders. They’re generally “backless” but they also start to deviate from the expected release method.* They consist of small checklists and were generally not released the same way most cards are. Art cards and customs fit in this area as well. Move up a size in this area and we have things like team photo postcards. Change the paper stock and we end up in Jay Publishing land. At some point things stop being a card for a lot of people**\n\n*There’s also something to be said about the licensing stuff but I’ve not heard anyone claim that Panini or other unlicensed logoless cards aren’t even cards.\n\n**Although we still collect them and cover them on this blog.\n\nThe one that’s sort of stumped me in my own collection are the Upper Deck Heroes of Baseball stadium giveaways from the early 1990s. Despite being letter-sized and blank-backed, because they’re cardboard and manufactured by Upper Deck they physically feel more like cards than a lot of the posters that Topps has folded up and inserted in packs over the years.\n\nAt the same time, since they were distributed via stadium giveaway and do not function as part of a set. They’re also functionally distinct from those late-60s, early-70s posters that were issued in packs and formed part of a distinct set.\n\nBut I could go on and on. As stated initially, the point of this post isn’t to provide a definitive answer or even an official opinion. Instead I hope that organizing my thoughts about the different ways we evaluate cardness is helpful to other people as I’ve found it to be for my own thinking.\n\nI expect fellow author-collector Dylan has really started something with his post on the subject a couple weeks back. The topic is one just begging for the pen of each of our members, even as the idea of choosing “just four?!” often feels impossible.\n\n1934-36 Diamond stars\n\nI’ll lead off with a set that Dylan included on his Mt. Rushmore, the “Diamond Stars” issued by National Chicle from 1934-36. Like Dylan, it’s the look of the cards that hooks me in.\n\nThe color palette jumps off the cardboard like ink off a comic book page, but I am also a big fan of the baseball scenes depicted in so many of the card backgrounds. I’ve already written about these scenes coming more from the imaginations of the artists than real life, but for me that’s a feature, not a bug.\n\nFrom a purely visual standpoint, Diamond Stars is my favorite set of the 1930s and perhaps my favorite set of all-time. Where it falls short with many collectors is in its player selection. Conspicuously absent from the set are Yankee greats Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. For the budget set collector, this is yet another bug-turned-feature.\n\nIf you’ve read a few of my pieces already, you also know I enjoy sets with some novelty and mystery. Diamond Stars definitely fits the bill, not only for its various quirks but also offers early instances (though by no means the earliest) of “Traded” cards.\n\nIf I had to choose one thing I dislike about this set, it’s the repetition of 12 players at the end of the set’s 108-card checklist. Particularly as these final cards are more scarce than the first 96, the duplication introduces disproportionate pain for set collectors forced to pay a premium for cards they already have.\n\n1933 Goudey\n\nHere is another set I’ve written about quite a bit and the set under whose shadow all other sets of the era reside.\n\nWhile the set’s iconic status goes hand in hand with its trademark “Big League Chewing Gum” banner along so many of the card bottoms, my favorite cards come from the set’s final three releases (e.g., Morrissey, Root, and Herman above).\n\nWhere Diamond Stars lacked Ruth and Gehrig, Goudey brought these players on steroids, combining for six cards across the set’s 240-card checklist. Counting the Napoleon Lajoie card issued the following year, the set includes 66 cards of Hall of Famers and all but two players who competed in the season’s inaugural All-Star Game.\n\nWere I to find fault with this set, it would be in a flaw common to all other baseball sets issued in the United States around this time. The set included players from the National League, American League, Pacific Coast League, International League, Southern Association, and American Association but no players from the Negro National League or other Black baseball leagues.\n\nKudos to my bud Scott Hodges who is filling some big holes in the 1933 Goudey set and others with his own digital card creations.\n\nI’ve attempted similar in analog fashion though I’ve been less faithful to the history. Here is Buck Leonard on the Grays a year before he joined the team.\n\nI will definitely treat the absence of Black stars as a bug, not a feature, but if there’s a silver lining it’s that there is no chance I could afford a 1933 Goudey Josh Gibson, and its absence from my collection would absolutely torment me daily.\n\n1911 T205 Gold Borders\n\nLike Dylan I had to include a tobacco set on my list. The T206 set, which initially did little for me, has grown on me immensely over the past couple years. Still, it would have to gain a lot more ground to surpass its gilded sequel.\n\nThe set features three different designs: one for National Leaguers, one for American Leaguers, and one for Minor Leaguers.\n\nI absolutely love the NL and Minor League designs and am somewhat ho hum about the AL one, so I’m fortunate to be a Brooklyn collector.\n\nAs brilliant as the card fronts are, the T205 card backs are not to be ignored. While some feature brief biographies and one of several tobacco brands, others include…stats!\n\nAs with the two sets covered thus far, you will not find a single Black player in this set. You might suppose no card set from 1911 included Black athletes, but this was not the case. For example, here is Jack Johnson from the 1911 Turkey Red Cabinets (mostly baseball) set.\n\nOnce again then there is the knowledge in collecting T205 that you’re not collecting the very best players of the era. But again, did I mention I was a Brooklyn collector?!\n\nAND…\n\nHere’s where it always gets tough. I probably have ten or more sets I’m considering, but the rules are that I can only choose one. Though I love the cardboard of the 1930s (and earlier!) so much, my favorite era of baseball is the early 1950s. Though integration was slow, it was at least happening, and the mix of new talent and old talent was simply off the charts.\n\nThat said, the number of baseball card sets that managed to include all the top stars of the period was practically zero. Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Jackie Robinson in the same (playing era) set? Your choices are already fairly limited:\n\n1947 Bond Bread\n\n1948 Blue Tint\n\n1949 Leaf\n\n1950 All-Star Pinups\n\n1950 R423 Strip Cards\n\n1952 Berk Ross\n\nAdd Stan Musial and Bob Feller and the list shrinks further:\n\n1947 Bond Bread\n\n1949 Leaf\n\n1950 R423 Strip Cards\n\n1952 Berk Ross\n\nAdd Mantle and Mays and the list boils down to one: 1952 Berk Ross.\n\nWith a selection of players that also includes Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Larry Doby, Duke Snider, Monte Irvin, and an awesome Johnny Mize “in action” card, could this set be the winner?\n\nAs much as I love the checklist, the answer has to be no. Most of the images are too dark, too light, or too weird for my taste, and the simple design borders on the boring. Still, what could have been!\n\nThe key then is to find a set with beautiful cards and almost all these same players, and–if we add a few more years–Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, and Ernie Banks.\n\nAs much as it pains me to give up Joe DiMaggio and Stan Musial, it’s hard for me not to land on 1956 Topps. The beautiful portraits, the Kreindleresque action shots, and the awesome cartoon backs offer my favorite overall design of the Golden Age of Baseball, and the absence of Bowman meant nearly every active star was included in the set.\n\nUnlike 1952 Berk Ross, with only 72 cards, 1956 Topps included 342 cards (counting un-numbered checklists), hence was large enough to assign a card to nearly everyone, not just a couple stars per team.\n\nIf I have any bitterness toward this set, it’s only the sour grapes of waiting way too long to collect it. If there’s a lesson here, it’s that sometimes to collect your Rushmore you need to…rush more! Luckily, I do have all 24 Brooklyn cards from the set, and hey, did I mention I’m a Brooklyn collector?\n\nHow about you? Which vintage (or modern!) sets make your Mt Rushmore? We look forward to your article!"
