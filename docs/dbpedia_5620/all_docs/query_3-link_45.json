        "text": "Joe DiMaggio, who has died of lung cancer aged 84, was the last great American hero in the soft-spoken, taciturn, gentlemanly style of Gary Cooper. It almost seems incidental that 'Joltin' Joe' or the 'Yankee Clipper', or simply 'Joe D', was one of the three greatest baseball players after Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth. What shone through was a core of old-fashioned masculine values, including a physical grace in the New York Yankees outfield, where he played all of his professional career from 1936 to 1951, a record unmatched by any modern player.\n\nHe was the Stanley Matthews of baseball - solid, smart, superbly talented, inward rather than extroverted. Off and on the field, DiMaggio had class, elegance and bearing of an almost Roman stoicism. He played his last season in 1951, aged 37, beset by painful injuries. Yet in the same year he was named for the 13th time to the prestigious All-Star game. If baseball is statistics, Joltin' Joe had them all. In 1937, 167 runs batted in; in 1939, hitting 381. During a 16-year career, which included a three-year stint in the US Army, DiMaggio posted 2,214 hits, 361 home runs and 1,537 runs batted in in 6,821 at-bats. In 1941, he hit and got on bases in 56 straight games - a record never equalled. DiMaggio led the Yankees to 10 American League pennants and eight world championships.\n\nOff the field he got into the list of 12 Americans whom teenagers admired most alongside Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Roy Rogers. Even before ball players took public relations courses, DiMaggio had an instinct for doing the right thing. He conquered not only by sheer nimble genius and slugging power but by force of character. You didn't mess with Joe, not because he intimidated but because of his uncanny ability to create an aura of respect.\n\nIt helped that the way he fielded even the hardest-hit long drives in the center field seemed ridiculously easy and graceful. The eyes of old men still brim when they speak of his long, loping stride and outstretched glove supernaturally attached, it seemed, to the plummeting horsehide ball.\n\nJoseph Paul DiMaggio was born to a working-class Sicilian-American family in San Francisco's Butchertown district. He was the youngest of nine children, who included Vince and Dom, also career baseball players. Two other boys, like their father, became crab fishermen. A big-bucks player, Joe won the American League home-run championship three years after he started playing professionally. He hit two home runs in a single inning. He is the only player to play on four world championship teams in his first four years in the major leagues.\n\nDark-eyed and dark-haired, essentially modest with a slow friendly smile, DiMaggio was one of those rare players whose timing was so superb he never seemed to be in a hurry. The hardest-hit balls seemed to come to him rather than vice versa. 'From the very first day,' it was said, 'he covered the outfield like a tent.' He was also a loner, aloof from locker-room pranks, mild-spoken, unmalicious, but tense and moody. And he was listed as one of America's 10 best-dressed men.\n\nExcept for a nine-month marriage to Marilyn Monroe in 1954 (a first marriage to actress Dorothy Arnold, with whom he had one son, ended in divorce), DiMaggio's long retirement was as modest as his off-field life always had been. A younger generation knew him mainly as 'Mr Coffee', fronting on TV for a name brand. That - and his public anger over Monroe's famous blowing skirt scene in The Seven Year Itch - was about as much notoriety as he ever earned. And, of course, his daily order of roses for Monroe's grave after she committed suicide in 1962.\n\n'He wanted me to be the beautiful ex-actress, just like he was the great former baseball player,' said Monroe, 12 years younger than DiMaggio. Almost alone among American athletes, DiMaggio avoided all diet and exercise except deep-sea-fishing. In his later years, he reigned in solitude at Reno's, a San Francisco bar, where he sipped coffee at one end of the long bar and where nobody bothered him, or, save for some boyhood chums, even talked to him. He was a 'regular guy' who never forgot, and continued to hobnob with, boys he had grown up with.\n\nEight of DiMaggio's diamond-studded World Series rings were stolen in 1960, but on 'Joe DiMaggio Day' at Yankee Stadium in September 1998, he was presented with replicas as a gift from Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner. Two weeks later, DiMaggio went into hospital for surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from a lung.\n\nHis remarkable career gave him such a hero's standing that Ernest Hemingway referred to him in the novel The Old Man And The Sea, and he became known to a younger generation when Simon and Garfunkel used his name as a symbol of the heroes of yesteryear in their 1960s' song Mrs Robinson. 'Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio/ A nation turns its lonely eyes to you,' they sang. 'What's that you say, Mrs Robinson/ Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.'\n\nDiMaggio never had a bad season. When asked why he gave it his all in every game, the Clipper replied: 'Because there might be somebody out there who's never seen me play before.'"
