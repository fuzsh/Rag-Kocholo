        "text": "April 18th marks the anniversary of a special event in the history of the New York Yankees and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. On that day in 1952, the Yankees retired Joe DiMaggio’s famed No. 5 jersey in an on-field ceremony prior to the club’s home opener. The event marked just the third time the Yankees had retired a player’s uniform number, as Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth had been similarly honored in 1940 and 1948, respectively.\n\nAs part of the festivities, DiMaggio donated the jersey, a pinstriped model from the previous season, to Rowan Spraker, Vice President of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Thrilled with the donation, Spraker returned to Cooperstown with the historic artifact and soon DiMaggio’s jersey hung in the Museum, just feet away from those of Lou Gehrig (number 4) and Babe Ruth (number 3). Joltin’ Joe’s jersey is currently a featured artifact in the “We Are Baseball” nationwide traveling exhibit.\n\nRecent research has revealed a surprising story about the jersey that once belonged to the Yankee Clipper. In 1951, DiMaggio had a cameo role in the movie “Angels in the Outfield.” In short, the film tells the tale of the remarkable turnaround of the Pittsburgh Pirates and their gruff manager, Aloysius “Guffy” McGovern, thanks to the prayers of a young girl and the help of angels at the ballpark. About 50 minutes into the film, DiMaggio is seen with his back to the camera, tossing a baseball with his teammates on the field at Yankee Stadium. In response to a question from an off-screen narrator, Joe turns around and quips, “If McGovern needs any extra angels, we'd be glad to give him a couple of ours.”\n\nBy meticulously comparing the retired number jersey with that worn by DiMaggio in the movie, we have been able to determine that the shirts are one and the same. The positions of various features of the Yankees jersey in relation to the background pinstripes shows an exact match between the jersey in the movie and that in the Hall of Fame’s collection. DiMaggio’s famed No. 5 on the back, the Yankees celebrated interlocking “NY” logo on the front, and the special patch commemorating the American League’s 50th anniversary on the left sleeve: Each is placed in the same location. Additionally, the pattern of pinstripes that forms at the shoulder seams on the retired number jersey is identical to that seen in the movie."
