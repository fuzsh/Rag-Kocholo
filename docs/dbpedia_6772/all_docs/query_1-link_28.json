        "meta_description": "This chapter draws its sources from three nationalist groups: the Ligue des patriotes, Action française, and the Ligue de la Patrie française. All three of these groups were created during or reinvigorated by the Dreyfus Affair, and they were central to the evolution of French nationalism during the early years of the twentieth century. This was a decisive period during which nationalist groups became more concerned with identifying and protecting an essentialised Frenchness, and this chapter argues that understandings of time were crucial to this change. The chapter begins by assessing the experience and the conceptualisation of time produced by defeat in the Franco-Prussian War: this was based in a sense of decline and a hatred of the present, and these features provided a base note for nationalist discourse. The chapter goes on to explore the Thalamas Affair of 1904, when the questioning of Joan of Arc’s divinity and virginity led to nationalist outrage. This Affair again saw questions around time becoming a broader battleground, with nationalists associating positivism and individualism with a myopic focus on the present and attempting to base their doctrine in what they held to be more durable ideas. Their despair at the events of the present gave way to antipathy for what the present represented as an idea. This hatred of the very concept of the present distinguished these nationalists from their anti-revolutionary forebears.",
