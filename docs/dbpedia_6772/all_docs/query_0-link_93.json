As the decade progressed, the nationalist language became increasingly defensive often explicitly exalting French cultural productions as it disparaged plays by foreigners. The critics’ intensified nationalist discourse arose during a period of economic dislocation in which the Third Republic renounced free trade and adopted protective tariffs and a policy of economic nationalism. In this crucial decade modernist theatre became more confrontational and French society became politically polarized. By the last years of the nineteenth century political issues from anarchism to the Dreyfus Affair competed with the aesthetic dimension of French modernist theatre. In this environment a consensus among theatre directors and critics secured Ibsen’s centrality to modern theatre."
