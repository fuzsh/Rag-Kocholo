        "meta_description": "This chapter pursues the question of how time was conceptualised on the radical right. It draws its sources from a range of radical right and anti-Semitic thinkers, though Action française provides the central focus. The chapter begins by exploring how different conceptualisations of the past competed within the movement in its early years, and then goes on to explore the creation of the idea of an ‘eternal France’. This was a vision constructed in order to elide a painful and difficult present and to repair the rift between past and future occasioned by the French Revolution. However, the actual meaning of an ‘eternal’ nation was highly unclear: for some, it meant a restoration of the monarchy, while for others it could be brought into being by a plebiscitary republic. It was also invoked by anti-Semites and Zionists alike. The image of the woman as mother was a central feature of eternal France, taken up by women themselves. Ultimately, tracing this concept through its various iterations allows us to appreciate the extent to which radical right ideology was underpinned by a specific notion of time. In particular, it reveals why monarchism appealed so strongly to some writers when it was already dying as a political force. The chapter ends by assessing how AF embraced direct action from 1905 onwards, moving away from its earlier philosophical stance. The idea of an eternal nation was henceforth combined with a new emphasis on action in the present.",
