        "text": "His particularly rich biography makes it difficult to summarize. A central feature of his private life was that he married the same woman three times (1928 - 1945 - 1964). The beautiful Natacha, born in Saint Petersburg in 1907, half Russian like him, she fascinated fashionable Paris. Having met in France in 1927, they had two sons from their successive unions, Serge and Roland. She outlived Beucler by just one year.\n\nAs for \"honours\" - on which he set little value - it is important to say all the same that Beucler was, like Alexandre Vialatte and Marcel Ayme, an awardwinner of the Blumenthal Foundation, which, during the Twenties, was very prestigious, and that three times he missed the Goncourt although his editor had maintained high hopes - deep down this reassured them that his writing really was modern. However, although there was no getting away from the Rosettes of the Legion d'Honneur and of the Arts et Lettres, he accepted with pleasure in 1981 the Grand Prix de la Societe des Gens de Lettres for his entire work.\n\nTo speak of Beucler also means to become immersed in Central Asia where he travelled with his parents during the long holidays. For the eight year old child that he was, adventure did not only exist on coloured maps of the atlas: Oural, The Caucasus, Turkestan and Samarkand, he knew them first hand! While much younger even than his future friend Cendrars, Beucler had \"lived\" Transsiberia as far as Vladisvostock.\n\nHis father, Jules, a lutherian from Montbéliard stock, had been sent to Russia by the Quai d'Orsay to teach French at the Law School and the Imperial Military School for Cadet Officers. French was compulsory at that time. In St. Petersburg he married Marie, General Souvorkoff's daughter, and it is here that, on 23rd February 1898, Andre Beucler began his existence.\n\nHe is still a child when his father organises his first trip by train from St. Petersburg to Belfort, alone with his brother who is a year younger. They become boarders first at the secondary school in Belfort and later in Besançon. Here, they engage in many sports; boxing, fencing, cycling and football. Andre is rowdy but brilliant.\n\nAt the secondary school in Besançon, the young Andre Beucler was to have among other teachers Albert Thibaudet, already an influential critic. Thanks to him, Beucler would experience the \"Giraudoux flash\", would also discover Jules Romains, who, he admits, had a great influence on his own desire to write."
