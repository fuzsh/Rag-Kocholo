        "text": "THERE WAS A TIME WHEN one man's fate fascinated and moved millions of people for longer than a single day. That time - the last five years of the last century - seems very distant now. How are we to explain the furious storm caused by the Dreyfus Affair throughout French society? Why should such passions have been unleashed by the situation of a man who seemed no different from his peers? What was there about him - obscure as he was, ordinary as he was - that France should have split into two fanatical camps, one of which turned him into a symbol of criminal ingratitude, the other into a symbol of admirable innocence?\n\nThe trial of the French artillery officer, Capt. Alfred Dreyfus, for treason, and the subsequent trial of France at the end of the 19th century, has been the subject of countless studies that have examined the political, social, religious and historical impact of the case. Now, the role of the arts in the Dreyfus Affair will be addressed in a fascinating exhibition at the Jewish Museum that opens next Sunday. ''The Dreyfus Affair: Art, Truth and Justice,'' presents more than 600 works inspired by the case, including paintings, sculpture, posters, newspapers, literature, documents and two pioneering movies, one from 1899 and another a 1907 Pathe film. The show, under the direction of the museum's curator of collections, Norman L. Kleeblatt, is worth taking some trouble to see. For the visitor, there are many levels to be experienced: it informs, educates, enlightens, it recalls the past, it demonstrates not only the limits of fanaticism and its consequences, but also the power of individuals who chose to denounce fanaticism and even disarm it. This exhibition has the weight of evidence.\n\nExcept for the great sculptor Auguste Rodin, who insisted on remaining neutral, almost everyone, known and unknown alike, adopted a position on the case -everyone was either for or against this Jewish captain accused by the French Army of having betrayed his country to help the Germans. Poets and novelists, university professors and clergymen, politicians and businessmen - all joined in the battle.\n\nLet the name Dreyfus be mentioned, and the conversation would grow heated and words would turn to shouts. Pissarro and Degas became mortal enemies because of the Affair - Pissarro, a Jew, being on Dreyfus's side, while Degas was against him. Renoir and Cezanne were also against him. Monet, on the other hand, was for him. Vuillard was for him. So were Mallarme, Charles Peguy, Anatole France, and, of course, Emile Zola. On the other side were Paul Bourget, Leon Daudet and Maurice Barres as well as the anti-Semitic polemicist Edouard Drumont, of course.\n\nAnd not only intellectual and artistic France but the entire country, from the largest city to the smallest village, turned into a vast battlefield on which visions of the world, two outlooks, two conceptions of right and freedom, two philosophical and political aspirations, two attitudes toward power, two systems of values confronted each other. And while the fight continued, nothing else seemed to interest the public. As long as the battle went on around him, one single man, immured in his solitude, stood at the very heart of his country's history. How had he come to be there?\n\nWe must look for the answer, not in his character but in his environment. Alfred Dreyfus came from an Alsatian Jewish family, was married and the father of two small children. His only concern: a simple, everyday sort of happiness. His only goal: to serve his country. Did he consider himself a committed Jew, a military Jew, a concerned Jew? We have no sign of it either in his behavior or in his letters. Did he attend synagogue? Was he planning to give his children a Jewish education? The truth is that even after he was imprisoned, even during his exile on Devil's Island, it never occurred to him that the torment he was suffering had any connection to the fact that he was a Jew. He believed there had been a miscarriage of justice, or at worst a judicial scandal.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
