None has better claim to it than Mme. Adam, La Grande FranÃ§aise, as she has been happily called, the story of whose life, which is now running into its eighty-first year, is told in the following pages.\n\nTo write Mme. Adamâs biography is also to write one of the most momentous chapters of French history. For this remarkable woman has lived through the Revolution of 1848, the coup dâÃ©tat of 1851, the agony of the siege of Paris, the civil war of the Commune, and two invasions of her beloved patrie.\n\nAs the mistress of a leading political salon, as the founder and editor for twenty years of an influential fortnightly magazine, La Nouvelle Revue, as for many years the intimate friend of Gambetta, of Thiers, of other French ministers, of the representatives of foreign powers and of such eminent French writers as George Sand, Flaubert, Victor Hugo, Alphonse Daudet, Pierre Loti, Paul Bourget and Maurice BarrÃ¨s, she has not only kept her finger on the pulse of her great nation, but she has to some extent modulated its heart-beats.\n\nThe key to Mme. Adamâs temperament and to all the varied phases of her career is her passionate belief in self-government, in that cause of national independence for which the powers of LâEntente are now engaging in this world-embracing conflict. We may call it a belief, but originally in Mme. Adamâs case it was an instinct born in her and inherited from her father, one of the most ardent of revolutionaries. Mme. Adam is a revoltÃ©e to the core. Toujours hors des rangs, Gambetta said of her. In numerous incidents of her childhood her rebelliousness revealed [Pg vi] itself. The growth of her reasoning powers, however, led her to submit to discipline, to embrace with fervourâshe can never do anything by halvesâthe republican creed, and to become the irreconcilable adversary of the Second Empire. Then the national defeat of 1871, acting upon what she has described as her combativitÃ© rentrÃ©e (her suppressed combativeness), turned her passion for self-government into an ardent advocacy of the principle of nationality, into a vehement protest against everything which could in even the remotest manner be suspected of undermining that principle.\n\nConsequently we shall find Mme. Adam loudly lifting up her voice, vigorously wielding her pen most frequently against Prussian aggressiveness, but also against imperialistic ideas, no matter in what shape or form, no matter in what part of the world she can detect them. We shall find her opposing alike the French tendency to colonial expansion and the Austrian Drang nach Osten, Mr. Gladstoneâs later policy in Egypt and the Conservative coercion of Ireland, the Magyar domination over the Slav peoples and our war with the Boer Republic in South Africa. We shall find her also ever glorifying the army and navy as the most effective guarantee of national independence.\n\nNationalism is Mme. Adamâs creed, patriotism her religion. French Nationalists, like LÃ©on Daudet, regard her as having been the strong tower of the French idea (la forteresse de lâidÃ©e franÃ§aise) throughout the forty-four years separating the war of 1914 from the war of 1870. If in later years Mme. Adam has renounced her fatherâs agnosticism and returned to the bosom of the Church, it is primarily because she considers that only by submitting to the Roman obedience can she best continue the traditions of her country.\n\nI am very fortunate, for Mme. Adam has throughout taken a deep interest in this biography. We have discussed it together at length. Despite her multifarious war activities she has found time to write me some forty letters in response to my questions. She has also introduced me to her friend and collaborator in La Nouvelle Revue, Mme. Jeanne Krompholtz, who has kindly furnished me with valuable information.\n\nFor the greater part of Mme. Adamâs life, however, from her birth in 1836 down to 1880, my main authority has been [Pg vii] her seven volumes of Souvenirs. These living documents, written, many of them, under the immediate impression of the events they record, I have carefully compared with contemporary and more recent writings, indicated by foot-notes throughout these pages. For the quarter of a century and more which has elapsed since the close of Mme. Adamâs Souvenirs I have consulted her numerous other autobiographical works, her contributions to La Nouvelle Revue and to other periodical literature, and also the frequent references to her personally, and to her books, which have appeared from time to time in the French press and elsewhere.\n\nI have to thank Sir Sidney Colvin, who frequently visited Mme. Adam at her salonâs most brilliant moment, in the seventies, for generously bringing forth from the rich treasure-house of his remembrance and for permitting me to incorporate in this book valuable recollections which enhance, confirm and complement impressions derived from other sources.\n\nHad he lived to see this work completed I should have gladly taken this opportunity to thank another of Mme. Adamâs acquaintances and admirers, M. Elie Mercadier, Director in London of LâAgence Havas. For to his lively talk about La Grande FranÃ§aise and her circle I am indebted for many a striking trait and useful suggestion.\n\nWinifred Stephens.\n\nLondon, 1917.\n\n[Pg ix]\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAP.

Adam has told, with more vivid detail than is unhappily here possible, the story of two generations of her ancestors. Her own career has not lacked romance; but many of its most thrilling incidents pale beside the experiences of her forbears. Tracing them back to the Napoleonic Wars, she presents us with a lively picture of domestic history, which is as far from being commonplace as it is possible to imagine. For it embraces moving scenes of rapturous love affairs, extraordinary marriages, a startling infidelity, quarrels about dowries, and the story of a son who had a rare precocious experience. At the age of nine, he found himself already disinherited and sent forth in the world, cast upon the mercy of the family milkman, with whom he took refuge. This juvenile outcast was Mme. Adamâs maternal grandfather, of whom, under the name of Dr. Seron, we shall hear much more anon. Only by unwavering persistence, and stern resolution did this unhappy boy escape from his benefactorâs vocation. Tramping to Paris, boots in hand, to save shoe-leather, he educated himself into the medical profession and ultimately married Mme. Adamâs grandmother, PÃ©lagie Raincourt. PÃ©lagie also was a highly romantic person, no less remarkable than her husband. For on her wedding morning, as the result of a family broil, by no means rare among Mme. Adamâs forbears, she escaped in a pet from her motherâs house, and was found sitting by the roadside, clad only in a nightcap and [Pg 2] dressing-gown, by her bridegroom, who had pursued her on horseback. Swinging her into the saddle, in order to avoid further escapades, he carried her off to the church and there married her out of hand. Her sole bridal adornment was a white carnation, which a woman of the people pinned into her cap.\n\nJuliette in later years was shown the cap and the carnation to illustrate the story, which she heard from the runawayâs own lips.\n\nMme. Seron continued all her life addicted to romance. When it became a question of marrying her daughter, Olympe, Mme. Adamâs mother, Mme. Seron, a catholic, chose a son-in-law who was an agnostic, because she was attracted by his appearance and his history. Jean Louis Lambert, Mme. Adamâs father, had for the sake of his opinions sacrificed brilliant ecclesiastical prospects, and from the prospective secretary of the Archbishop of Beauvais had become an usher in the boysâ school opposite Mme. Seronâs house. This heroic youth was taken by Mme. Adamâs grandmother, educated as a doctor, and married to the reluctantly quiescent Olympe, who from that time forward adopted that attitude of injured passivity which was expressed by her favourite phrase âwhere you have tethered the goat there it will graze.â\n\nAll this happened in Picardy, a province where people lived well and washed sparingly. The very name of Mme. Adamâs birthplace, Verberie, with its suggestion of oyster patties and sauterne, made Robert Louis Stevensonâs mouth water, as he paddled towards it in his canoe. Juliette remembers how on Fridays at ten in the morning the oyster cart from Boulogne would arrive, bringing twelve dozen oysters for her family, how they would all sit round the table, the oyster barrel in the centre, and how each with his or her knife would open his or her oysters. Julietteâs grandfather and father would consume four dozen each, her grandmother and mother two dozen each, while sometimes there would be a friend who would abstract as many as possible from his hostsâ respective shares. Wine flowed freely at these feasts. Dr. Seron was a twelve-bottle man. But fortunately his beverage was only light Macon; and this, happily for his patients, was not consumed until he had performed his operations at the hospital. Operations! One trembles at the very word [Pg 3] when associated with Dr. Seron. For, according to his granddaughter, that country surgeon was a most diligent cultivator of microbes. Ablutions, as we have said, were rare in Picard households. A bath was unheard of. Dr. Seron held that the face should be washed as little as possible for fear of bringing out a rash. Soap was only used on Sundays. The windows, of course, were kept tightly shut. Physical exercise was carefully avoided. The women of Mme. Adamâs family, like old-fashioned Frenchwomen down to the present day, seldom went beyond their own house and garden, declining even the attractions of the provincial theatre, for they agreed with Mme. de SÃ©vignÃ© that une grande dame ne doit pas remuer les os (a true lady should not move about her bones).\n\nNevertheless, though their bodies were cribbed, cabined and confined, these Frenchwomenâs minds moved in the great world of romance, their fancies glowed with all the fervent imaginings of that effervescent age. Mme. Adamâs grandmother lived, moved and had her being in the âHuman Comedyâ of Balzac. Turning over the pages of his ninety-seven novels, or sitting over her embroidery frame, she lived the lives of his five thousand characters. Her unfortunate choice of a husband for her granddaughter, Juliette, was largely dictated by the suitorâs resemblance to one of her favourite novelistâs heroes.\n\nMme. Adam, as we have said, was born at the little Picard town of Verberie, a famous place in mediÃ¦val times, the residence of Frankish kings, whither in the ninth century had come Ethelbald, King of Wessex, to wed his thirteen-year-old bride, Charles the Baldâs daughter, Judith. Verberie in the last century was a favourite place of call for tourists, who in pre-motor-car days used to drive leisurely from Senlis to CompiÃ¨gne. Our English poetess, Mary Robinson (Mme. Duclaux)[2], tells how from the steep brow of a down, known as âla Montagne de Verberie,â she saw through âthe poplar screens of the precipitous hill-side, a lovely blue expanse of country with the Oise lying across it like a scimitar of silverâ; how her carriage dashed down the hill âand clattered along the sleepy, pebbly ... street, past the inn, full of blouses and billiards.â\n\n[Pg 4]\n\nIt was in that very inn, âLes Trois Monarques,â at Verberie that Mme. Adam was born, at half-past five on the 4th of October, 1836.\n\nWas it a glimpse into their daughterâs future that made her parents name her âJulietteâ after that most seductive of all the queens of French salons, Mme. RÃ©camier?\n\nNo gold or even silver spoon was in our Julietteâs mouth when she made her first appearance on this worldâs stage. At the time of her birth, her parentsâ fortunes had reached a low ebb. Dr. Lambert had been in practice with his great-uncle in a village not far from Verberie, and thither to his uncleâs house he had brought home his girl wife. For the first years of their marriage everything had gone well with the young couple. Then had come a deluge of misfortunes. Their first baby, a boy, died in convulsions. Then the uncle died, and his estate was divided among numerous legatees. Finally, a fire broke out which nearly consumed the whole village, and, despite Mme. Lambertâs heroic efforts, burned her husbandâs house to the ground.\n\nThus were Julietteâs parents driven to seek harbourage in the inn at Verberie, where Juliette was born.\n\nVery shortly after this event, her father, one of the most unpractical but at the same time most attractive of scientists, was fascinated by the report of some marvellous scientific experiments, which were being made in the neighbouring town of CompiÃ¨gne, by a well-known chemist, a Dr. Bernhardt. Leaving his wife and daughter to the tender mercies of mine host of âThe Three Monarchs,â Dr. Lambert went off to join his confrÃ¨re. This Dr. Bernhardt came to be regarded by Julietteâs family as a veritable German Mephistopheles; for the only result of his experiments was the consumption of Mme. Lambertâs dowry.\n\nDuring her husbandâs scientific adventures Mme. Lambert and her baby girl in the Verberie inn were suffering serious privations. And they might have come near starvation had it not been for the assistance they received from Mme. Lambertâs parents. But this timely aid could only be given surreptitiously; for Juliette had had the misfortune to be born, not into poverty merely, but into one of the numerous family feuds which were to chequer all her childhood. Between her parents and her grandparents at the time of the first babyâs death there had arisen a misunderstanding. For some time there had been no communication [Pg 5] between the Lamberts at Verberie and the Serons, who lived not far away at Chauny, then a flourishing manufacturing town, now converted by German vandalism into a heap of ruins. It was only by the curtest of notes that Dr. Lambert had announced to Dr. and Mme. Seron their granddaughterâs advent. Had it not been for the report, brought by one of Dr. Seronâs patients, a friendly commercial traveller, Julietteâs grandmother would never have known of the sorry plight to which her son-in-lawâs scientific vagaries had reduced his wife and child.\n\nOn hearing the commercial travellerâs news, Mme. Seron, with characteristic impetuousness, flew into a passion and declared that she would set off at once for Verberie to rescue her granddaughter from the parents who were obviously incapable of taking care of her. Dr. Seron, however, succeeded in convincing his wife that a family scene would be injurious for the infant, whom her mother was nursing. He reminded Mme. Seron that the first Lambert baby had died in convulsions; and finally he induced her to postpone her intervention until the child was nine months old and might leave her mother without danger.\n\nMeanwhile the landlord of âThe Three Monarchsâ was secretly given to understand that Mme. and Mlle. Lambert must be made comfortable, and that Dr. Seron might be held responsible for the reckoning.\n\nWith great difficulty during those interminable nine months did the ardent grandmother possess her soul in patience. She occupied the time, however, in working out the details of the cleverly devised plot by which she ultimately succeeded in carrying off her grandchild.\n\nJuliette in after years used to delight to hear her grandmother describe all the stages of that famous coup: how the landlord of the inn was made privy to the plot; how there stood ready a coach, nothing less than a berline, recalling another flight, more famous but less successful; how in the coach had been placed a warm shawl and a bottle of hot milk; how, while Mme. Lambert was haggling over the bill with the landlord, Mme. Seron, bearing a certain precious bundle, was stealthily stealing to the berline and then speeding away with baby Juliette to join the diligence outside the town; how ultimately the stolen jewel was deposited safely at Chauny, whither not long afterwards her mother followed her.\n\n[Pg 6]\n\nIn vain did Dr. Lambert, penniless and disillusioned, plead for the return of his wife and daughter. âNot until you have proved yourself able to support them,â was Mme. Seronâs stern reply; and, she added relentlessly, âI adopt the child whom you abandoned, whom you left a prey to the direst poverty. She is mine, and shall be as long as I live.â\n\nThus ended the first of those kidnappings which were to recur at intervals through the first sixteen years of Julietteâs life, until her first marriage. They arose not merely from the rival claims of parents and grandparents to possess the child, but from the fact that each of these four persons held pronounced and divergent opinions as to the upbringing of their adored one. In the quarrels which ensued, Mme. Seron and Dr. Lambert were the protagonists; Dr. Seron and Mme. Lambert played the parts of supers, or supported one side or the other.\n\nWe are all, even the most obstinate and strong-minded, moulded, though often unconsciously, by various intellectual influences. To this rule Juliette, despite her indomitable will and personal idiosyncrasy, was no exception. And a study of her mental development shows her passing through three distinct phases: her childhood and youth, when her grandmotherâs or her fatherâs influence dominated alternately: middle life, when broadly speaking she sympathised with her fatherâs opinions: her later years, after the war of 1870, when more or less she was returning to her grandmotherâs point of view.\n\nWith these two formative forces, with these two remarkable persons, Mme. Seron and her son-in-law, Dr. Lambert, we must become intimately acquainted if we would understand Julietteâs character and career. We must also remember that the time of Julietteâs upbringing was the hey-day of the romantic period, a time when individualism ran rampant, when the most Utopian of dreamers believed they were about to realise their wildest hopes. It was true that after half a century of experiments in government France had practically settled down for a while into the jog-trot of Louis Philippeâs reign. But beneath the veil of the moderate and the commonplace which this compromise of constitutional monarchy had cast over the country, there bubbled and boiled a welter of effervescence which twelve years after Julietteâs birth exploded in the Revolution of 1848.\n\n[Pg 7]\n\nThe national temperament of France during the first half of the last century partly accounts for the temperament of Julietteâs family, and for the atmosphere of intellectual and emotional feverishness in which she was brought up. Looking back from the vantage point of old age on the stormy scenes of her childhood, she asked: âWere we more sensitive then, more susceptible, more dramatic than to-day? I believe we were.â[3] It is not improbable also that Mme. Adam, regarding her childhood through the long vista of years, may have unconsciously exaggerated the violence of her sentiments and experiences. One of her charms is that feeling for the dramatic, with which Gambetta once reproached her, saying, âVous dramatisez trop, madame!â\n\nâMy love for my grandmother and for my daughter,â said Mme. Adam to me shortly before her eightieth birthday, âhave been the two great passions of my life.â\n\nOf her grandmother, she announces in the beginning of her Souvenirs: âI shall write of her often, but shall I ever ... be able to make her live with that originality, that passion for the romantic which she infused into us all, lifting on to the plane of high romance the whole of our family life and each one of our daily actions?â\n\nThough Mme. Seron hardly ever went outside her own domestic domain except to attend mass on Sunday, her granddaughter could say that never had she met a mind âmore avid of adventure, more scornful of the every-day and the commonplace, more eager for the romantic in life and in literature.â\n\nIn no point, save in their passionate adoration of Juliette, did Mme. Seron and her son-in-law agree. Yet in temperament they were not altogether unlike; for they were both dreamers. But Julietteâs grandmother, if she did not possess it, at least respected that worldly wisdom which Dr. Lambert regarded with the utmost contempt. He was an idealist pure and simple. We have seen him sacrificing a brilliant ecclesiastical career to conscientious scruples. We have seen him risking the happiness of his wife and child in his pursuit of science. We shall see him again, more than once risking not only his familyâs happiness but his own life in the cause of political reform.\n\nâI am the daughter,â writes Mme. Adam, âof a sincere [Pg 8] sectary ... of one who dreamed of absolute liberty, absolute equality.... Only for a moment, during the Commune, did he believe his dream realised.â\n\nJean Louis Lambert was one of those rare persons with tastes both scientific and literary. But it was only classical literature that appealed to him. He was a passionate Grecian and an ardent admirer of the French masterpieces of le grand siÃ¨cle. In the remarkable literary works which his own day was producing, in the novels of Balzac and George Sand, which were his mother-in-lawâs meat and drink, he took not the slightest interest. His Homer, on the other hand, he almost knew by heart; and he made his little daughter as familiar with tales from the Iliad as are most children with âRed Riding Hoodâ or âCinderella.â Dr. Lambert himself wrote verses in the classic style, which he would recite to his mother-in-law; but there were others which were red republican, and which he would have kept from her hearing had not that enfant terrible of a Juliette caught them up and repeated them parrot-like to her grandparents. Dr. Seron, an old soldier of la grande armÃ©e, was infuriated by poems in which his son-in-law dared to attack his idol, the Emperor.\n\nIndeed, the family tendency to wrangle was considerably accentuated by the fact that three of its members (Julietteâs mother took no interest in public affairs) held directly divergent political opinions. Mme. Seron was a liberal monarchist, Dr. Seron a Buonapartist, and Dr. Lambert a social democrat. None of these fervent partisans had the remotest idea of keeping their opinions to themselves. Consequently, whenever Dr. Lambert and his wife drove over from BlÃ©rancourt, a village nine miles from Chauny, where Julietteâs father had set up in practice, the voice of controversy rose high. These debates generally occurred at meal time. And baby Juliette, accustomed to have the attention of her doting elders fixed upon herself, strongly objected to these diversions. She tells how to restore herself to the limelight she would clamber into the middle of the table and begin to upset the plates and glasses. The device never failed. Discussion ceased; the three controversialists would be overcome with laughter, while the silent member of the group, Julietteâs mother, would suddenly become active. Snatching her daughter from the wreck on the table, she would be administering a [Pg 9] sound smacking when three pairs of hands would be eagerly outstretched to rescue the culprit. Thus Juliette learnt two lessons: first, not to fear her motherâs severity, from which she might always count upon the indulgence of her other relatives to deliver her; second, to appreciate âthat first born of common sense,â the comic spirit. In her earliest years it was her inestimable privilege to have âlaughter for nurse, pure fun for friend.â\n\nGeorge Meredith, it will be remembered, divides humanity[4] into three classes: the non-laughers, the excessive laughers and those who stand where the comic spirit places them, âat middle distance between the inveterate opponents and the drum and fife supporters of comedy.â\n\nIn the table scene just described, each of these three classes is represented. Julietteâs mother was a non-laugher, a morbid person whose lack of fun, as is inevitable with women, degraded her to be a mere household drudge. Julietteâs grandfather, the jovial doctor, whose funny stories, nicknamed Seronnades, enlivened the countryside, was of the drum and fife order, an apostle of le gros rire. Julietteâs grandmother and father, though differing in so many respects, were alike endowed with the true comic spirit. Long years later, looking back on her turbulent childhood, Mme. Adam wrote: âI should probably have been intolerable, had not the gay and merry temperaments of my grandparents ... introduced into our relationship a jocular spirit which did not admit of solemnity, even in our grievances. Whenever I succeeded in reconciling them after one of their disputes, it was because I had made them laugh.â[5] âCertainly,â exclaimed a character in one of Pierre Milleâs stories, âhe was no Latin, for he took everything seriously.â[6] Juliette Adam, Gallic by birth, GrÃ¦co-Latin by education, as she likes to describe herself, has always been ready to see a joke, even when it was at her own expense. Thus she is proud to relate, how when at one of George Sandâs dinner-parties, Flaubert, in Dumasâ presence, pointed out that in one of her books she had made a man who had lost an arm take a box in both hands, she joined in the laugh, saying gaily, âMerci, MaÃ®tre.â[7]\n\n[Pg 10]\n\nDespite his intense desire to have his adored child in his own home, Dr. Lambert constrained himself to permit Juliette to remain with her grandparents until she was three. But on his daughterâs fourth anniversary her father put in his paternal claim.\n\nLooking back over more than three score years and ten Mme. Adam still sees that day as the first which stands out clearly in her memory. She remembers it for several reasonsâbecause of the new white frock she wore, embroidered by her grandmother; because the bonne ArthÃ©mise on that day called her âMademoiselleâ for the first time; because her grown-up friend Charles, professor at the boysâ school opposite, embraced her; because when her parents arrived late as usual from BlÃ©rancourt, on account of the bad roads, her father took her up in his arms, kissed her, and with tears in his eyes said, âJuliette, how you have grown, it is so long since I have seen youâthree months.â\n\nBut above all that day stands engraved on Julietteâs recollection because in the midst of the birthday feast, there fell like a bombshell descending on the hitherto harmonious family party, her fatherâs words: âThis time we shall take Juliette home with us.â Then there ensued one of those impassioned family scenes which were so frequent in Julietteâs childhood. Mme. Seron refused to give up her granddaughter, Dr. Lambert protested vehemently that he would have his child. The little girl, hardly out of babyhood, was herself appealed to: whom did she love mostâher parents or her grandparents? Where would [Pg 11] she like to liveâat Chauny or at BlÃ©rancourt? But in the end Mme. Seron won the day, as she usually did, and probably for the excellent reason that it was she who held the family purse-strings.\n\nThere was, however, in this vehement, romantic, impulsive lady a strain of consistency and logic. Because during that dinner-table wrangle with her son-in-law she had based her claim to Julietteâs remaining with her on the fact that there were better educational facilities at Chauny than at BlÃ©rancourt, she felt compelled to act on that assertion. Consequently, she lost no time in sending Juliette, tiny as she was, to school.\n\nBut this important crisis in Julietteâs career could not pass without yet another drame de famille. To send so young a child to the pension, to âprison,â as they called it, seemed to the easygoing Dr. Seron and to the bonne ArthÃ©mise, who doted on her little charge, as nothing short of cruelty. Like a servant out of one of MoliÃ¨reâs comedies, ArthÃ©mise rated her mistress soundly, whereupon she received an entirely disregarded notice to pack up her baggage and be off.\n\nOf this scene the little victim was herself a spectator. And it was as a captive, therefore, that she regarded herself, when her grandmother led her off and delivered her up to her schoolmistress, the grim, moustached Mme. Dufey, who, with what appeared to Juliette a veritable turnkeyâs smile, received her with the announcement: âI had the mother, now I have the daughter.â\n\nThen followed a hurricane of a day. Cries, sobs and physical protestations landed the new pupil in the school garret, wherefrom she was extricated in the afternoon by ArthÃ©mise, who had come to take her home. But home to her cruel grandmother this wilful child absolutely refused to go. No sooner was she outside the school gates than she set off running in the direction of the village where ArthÃ©mise lived. There ArthÃ©mise weakly followed her. And it was only late in the evening that the runaway, having been put to sleep in another and pleasanter garret, was driven back to Chauny by her grandfather in his gig.\n\nJuliette felt that she had won a victory. Her grandmother had certainly learnt a lesson. She now realised that her granddaughter was the kind of child she herself had beenâone of those who must be led and not driven. [Pg 12] Henceforth Juliette was brought up on what we now call the Montessori system. And the time came when she herself elected to go with one of her playmates to that same school, which she now found quite amusing.\n\nIndeed, considering the strongly pronounced and utterly divergent opinions held as to her upbringing by the four persons who desired to control her, the only possible course was for the child, as soon as she was able, to train herself as far as possible.\n\nBut there were certain questions which even this head-strong little girl found settled without her participation. There was notably the religious question. Dr. Lambert, as we have seen, was a bitter anti-clerical, an aggressive agnostic of the old-fashioned Voltairean stamp. Mme. Lambert, Dr. and Mme. Seron were all catholics. And there gnawed at Mme. Lambertâs heart the painful secret that Juliette was still a little heathen, for, as the result of her fatherâs anti-clericalism, she had never been baptized. To remedy this omission, without confessing it to her parents, Julietteâs mother devised a clever and effectual stratagem. Under the pretext of being present at the wedding of one of her motherâs friends, the little girl was brought over to BlÃ©rancourt by her grandfather. Then at the end of the wedding ceremony, she was hurried into one corner of the church and held over what seemed to her a yawning gulf of a basin, where, amidst her violent protestations, she was transformed, as her grandfather afterwards told her, from âa poor little unbaptized girlâ into âa big, happy baptized girl.â But this blessed conversion she was carefully enjoined not to mention to her father, because he did not like churches.\n\nWhether the youthful convert would have kept the secret is doubtful. But the opportunity of doing so was reft from her by one of her playmates, who during the wedding festivities called her, in her fatherâs presence, by her baptismal names of âCamille Ambrosine.â This led to inquiries and to a disclosure, followed, of course, by the inevitable drame de famille. Fortunately for the conspirators an accident to one of Dr. Lambertâs patients put an end to this extremely unpleasant situation. And while the BlÃ©rancourt doctor was at the injured manâs bedside his father-in-law seized the occasion to drive the âlittle bone of contentionâ back to Chauny.\n\n[Pg 13]\n\nJuliette, having been once captured by her catholic relatives, Dr. Lambert agreed to surrender her mind to their keeping until she had taken her first communion. And he must have been pleased that Mme. Seron, with her usual ambitious desire to force the pace in Julietteâs education, persuaded the Dean to admit her clever little granddaughter into the Church one year earlier than was customary, at ten instead of eleven.\n\nâWe must furnish the little brain,â was Mme. Seronâs favourite expression. She herself had never acquired much book learning. But, in order to educate her grandchild, she for a while put on one side her adored novels and studied French history, of which she was most eager that Juliette should take a correct view. That correct view was, of course, Mme. Seronâs own, and was the contradiction of her husbandâs and son-in-lawâs opinions. Julietteâs grandmother taught her to regard the French middle-class, the bourgeoisie, as the salt of the earth, and the government of Louis Philippe as the only possible government, infinitely superior to the Buonapartism which Dr. Seron and to the Jacobinism which Dr. Lambert would have liked to restore.\n\nSo Juliette, surrounded by piles of lesson-books, was kept hard at work till late in the evening, while her grandfather laughed at her for being a blue-stocking, and dubbed her âMlle. PhÃ©nomÃ¨ne.â\n\nBut even the jocular Dr. Seron could sometimes be serious: and he gravely warned his wife that if she continued thus to press the little girl beyond her years misfortune would follow.\n\nHis warning being unheeded, the prognostication came true. Its fulfilment was hastened by three weeks at BlÃ©rancourt, where Dr. Lambert talked to his little daughter as if she were grown up, and by a tempestuous journey home with her mother, followed by an even stormier drame de famille on her arrival at Chauny.\n\nJuliette fell seriously ill. On her recovery, Dr. Seron, who seems to have been the only member of the family endowed with common sense, insisted on his granddaughter being removed from the atmosphere of school-books and drames de famille to a serener and healthier air.\n\nThe child was sent to visit her grandmotherâs three step-sisters, three maiden ladies who lived with their mother, [Pg 14] in the heart of the country, at a village called Chivres, not far from Soissons.\n\nâMy aunts! Ah! you must love my aunts!â exclaimed Mme. Adam, as one day, in the salon at Gif, we talked of these delectable virgins. And indeed one could not help loving the charming, though eccentric ladies, les demoiselles Sophie, Constance and Anastasie Raincourt. They represent a type totally unknown in Great Britain, though I suspect it might not at that time have been altogether impossible to discover their counterparts in other French country districts, or perhaps in remote corners of New England.\n\nThe aunts were a bundle of contradictions and surprises. In their short gathered print skirts, aprons and kerchiefs, they looked like peasant women, and they worked like peasant women too, at hay-making, poultry-keeping and fruit-farming. But so distinguished was their bearing that in their humble attire they had the air of great ladies in disguise, while their discussion during hay-making of Sismondiâs Italian Republics showed them to be veritable femmes savantes. Though living in the heart of the country, these original spinsters took a deep interest in all the literary and political movements of the town. Though, with their step-sister, Mme. Seron, they were firmly convinced that a constitutional monarchy was the only ideal form of government, they did not altogether share Mme. Seronâs admiration for Louis Philippe. They criticised his policy and approved of the opposition led by M. Odillon Barot.\n\nIn almost every respect Julietteâs life at Chivres was a complete contrast to her life at Chauny or BlÃ©rancourt. Instead of, as at Chauny, sitting up late over her books and then going to bed in her grandmotherâs stuffy chamber, with the windows tightly closed and the atmosphere infested by the midnight oil burnt to enable Mme. Seron to read her romances, Juliette at Chivres, after a day spent in healthy open-air exercise, lay down with the lamb and rose with the lark, having slept by herself in a large airy room with the windows wide open.\n\nWhereas at Chauny no interest was taken in house arrangement, while picturesque old family heirlooms were regarded as lumber and relegated to the attic, and any artistic feeling found its only expression in personal adornment, [Pg 15] at Chivres it was just the opposite: Julietteâs fine clothes were all folded away, and she was dressed like her aunts in peasant costume; but her natural love of the beautiful was gratified by the daintiness and artistry of all the household arrangements, by the handsome old chests and commodes, the embroidered draperies, the nosegays of fresh wild flowers, and the beautifully bound books ranged trimly on their shelves.\n\nThe intellectual atmosphere of Chivres was likewise entirely different from that of Chauny and BlÃ©rancourt. Dr. Lambertâs heroes, Louis Blanc and Proudhon, were anathema to such worshippers of the established order as the aunts. In the light of her auntsâ wide interest in all manifestations of nature, her grandmotherâs concentration on the merely human aspect of life suddenly appeared to Juliette as intensely narrow. It was at Chivres that Juliette first acquired that passionate love of nature which she was later to express so eloquently in her books. It was at Chivres that Juliette learnt to take an interest in birds and beasts and flowers, and also in inanimate things, to findâ\n\nâ... tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\n\nSermons in stones and good in everything.â\n\nIn her auntsâ company the simplest actions of rural life acquired for the little girl some deep significance: watering flowers in the garden she seemed to be quenching their thirst, gathering fruit in the orchard she was easing the burden of overladen trees, cutting clover in the paddock she was receiving a gift from bountiful earth.\n\nFor Aunt Sophie even stones and metals had a voice or resonance. She would place upon a crystal tray various substances differing in form, some round, some flat, and with a little hammer would play upon them curious melodies.\n\nWhile Julietteâs father had brought her up on tales from the Iliad, Aunt Sophie, who was an accomplished Latin scholar, told her stories from the Ãneid, which seemed to her strangely like an echo of her beloved Homer. While her grandmotherâs favourite novelist had been Balzac, the aunts talked to her admiringly of George Sandâs peasant romances, and vaguely hinted at longer novels by the same author, which they did not altogether like, but which Juliette would read when she grew up.\n\n[Pg 16]\n\nBut the greatest contrast of all was the atmosphere of calm which pervaded Chivres, the harmony in which the aunts and their mother lived, so different from the perpetual wrangling of Chauny and BlÃ©rancourt. No wonder that Juliette after two months of this serenity returned to her grandmother a new creature, in mens sana in corpore sano. No wonder that the perfect success of this first visit caused it to be repeated annually throughout Julietteâs childhood. Indeed, as time went on, as Juliette grew in years, as the feverish intellectuality of Chauny and BlÃ©rancourt intensified, the summer visit to Chivres became more and more necessary.\n\nHaving done his best to keep his word to his mother-in-law and to permit her to dominate Julietteâs mind until her first communion, once that event was consummated Dr. Lambert felt at liberty to educate his little girl in his own way, in his own ideas, and to make her, as he expressed it, âhis daughter according to the spirit as well as according to the flesh.â\n\nIn his earlier talks with Juliette he had endeavoured to impose a certain reserve upon his expansive nature. Though finding it impossible to exclude his beliefs, his hopes and enthusiasms altogether from their conversation, he had but alluded to them vaguely, saying, âwhen you are older I will explain to you such and such, when you are older you will understand this or that.â\n\nThis seed, though sown in an almost infantile mind, had not fallen on barren ground. Not one of these remarks had been lost on Julietteâs precocious and naturally speculative intelligence. She was therefore well prepared to receive with enthusiasm those hopeful doctrines of liberty, fraternity and equality with which her father now set seriously to work to inculcate his eleven-year-old little daughter.\n\nOn Julietteâs return from Chivres in the autumn of 1847, she paid a visit to her parents at BlÃ©rancourt. And it was then that her father said to her: âNow that you have discharged your obligations to your grandmotherâs religion, I can speak to you frankly of mine.â\n\nThe chief articles of Dr. Lambertâs creed were a belief in human solidarity and a conviction in the inherent goodness of nature. With the great Jean Jacques he held society, not nature, responsible for all the evils which have [Pg 17] befallen mankind. His âgreat negation,â as his daughter was later to call it, consisted in the denial that the finite can ever be capable of comprehending the infinite. Nature, he held, was rich enough and vast enough to satisfy all manâs craving for knowledge, sociability and love. âIf you must worship something,â he would say to Juliette, âthen worship the sun which lightens and warms you, in whose rays all things germinate, breathe and blossom.â While for the Christian religion Dr. Lambert had little respect, its Founder he held in the greatest veneration. While Christ came to obliterate all distinctions of race and caste, Christianity seemed to Julietteâs father ever raising barriers between man and man. âChrist,â he used to say, âcame to save what he called âsouls,â we [the social democrats] come to save society (la personne sociale) by establishing equality, fraternity, liberty.â\n\nIn days when trade unionism was beginning in Great Britain, and when Proudhonâs teaching was laying the foundations of future syndicalism in France, Dr. Lambert was a firm believer in the right of all men to work, and to insist on receiving for that work a just wage. âJuliette,â he would say, âI rejoice to see you talking to a working-man ... as if he were your brother. I want you to be an apostle of human happiness and universal good. I love the weak and helpless more than myself. To see struggle and suffering tortures me. To those who have nothing one must give oneself up entirely, keeping nothing back.â\n\nAt such words the little girlâs heart glowed within her. With all her passionate little soul she responded to her fatherâs pity for the unfortunate, with all the determination of her strong will she resolved to spend her life helping them.\n\nThough in years to come some of her fatherâs notions were to appear to her quixotic, though even then she and her grandmother laughed at his affecting the workmanâs blouse, for example, though as time went on his extravagance and lack of common sense were frequently to make her tremble for his safety, she neverânot even when intellectually they had drifted apartâceased to reverence the breadth of his knowledge, the range of his charity and his unfailing good nature. The words apostle and charity ever conjured up before her a vision of her father. In spite of their perpetual disagreement, even Julietteâs grandmother [Pg 18] would say of her son-in-law: âHe is a dreamer, but he is sincere, and he has a heart of gold.â\n\nDr. Lambert was indeed one of those intellectual enthusiasts who were largely responsible for the Revolution of 1848. For these men of 1848 Mme. Adam has always cherished the most profound respect. Though in after life she came to regard them as childishly ingenuous and heedless of the possibility of realising their dreams, she has ever venerated their âpassionate altruism,â their âcraving to sacrifice themselves in the peopleâs cause,â their revolt against that famous formula ascribed to M. Guizot, âenrich yourselves.â âThe men of 1848,â writes Mme. Adam, âwere apostles and saints. Never have there been more honesty, more virtue, a nobler simplicity. They were no mere politicians. They were souls in love with the ideal. All those whom I have known were as sincere as my father ... and to have associated with them is to honour and cherish their memory.â\n\n[Pg 19]\n\nMme. Adam has lived through four Revolutions. The first, that of 1848, occurred when she was eleven. In the previous year, when she paid her usual summer visit to Chivres, she found her aunts perturbed by the political situation. They were eagerly devouring the columns of the National. They were talking of politics from morn till night. Much to their motherâs disapproval, they brought their eleven-year-old niece into their discussions. âYou are tiring the poor little thing to death!â remonstrated Julietteâs great-grandmother.\n\nâNo,â rejoined her daughters, âthe child is quite old enough to listen and to understand.â\n\nâBesides,â continued Aunt Constance, who was the ironist of the three, âit will not be unprofitable to you, mademoiselle, to learn, if not with your ears, at least with your mouth as you yawn, the views on public affairs held by such highly intelligent persons as your aunts.â\n\nâBut,â writes Juliette, âI did not yawn, for my mind was interested in all matters political and literary.â[8]\n\nFrom her auntsâ point of view the child saw those surging political movements of the day at an angle quite different from that at which, under her fatherâs direction, she had been accustomed to regard them.\n\nAt Chivres her fatherâs heroes, Louis Blanc, Ledru-Rollin, Proudhon, were held in horror. As utterly subversive of all public order the aunts regarded Ledru-Rollinâs [Pg 20] famous speech, when, pleading before the Court of Cassation, the republican barrister had challenged the Procureur GÃ©nÃ©ral, crying: âProcureur GÃ©nÃ©ral, who appointed you?â âThe Ministry.â âI, being an elector, may dismiss ministries. In whose name do you speak?â âIn the kingâs name.â âI, being an electorâhistory proves itâcan make and unmake kings. Procureur GÃ©nÃ©ral, on your knees, on your knees before my sovereignty.â While as for Proudhonâs famous maxim, âProperty is theft,â the aunts exclaimed: âWhy, itâs the end of the world.â Social reform had no place in these good ladiesâ political programme. They were content with the existing order. They had no sympathy with Dr. Lambertâs doctrine of the right to work, nor with Ledru-Rollin when he declared: âThe workers have been slaves; they have been serfs; to-day they are wage-earners; we must strive to make them partners.â[9] The reforms which the aunts advocated in their talks with their niece were merely administrative. What they desired above all was to see Paris dethroned from her seat as the one centre of influence in the kingdom. They wanted decentralisation, the revival of the old provincialism. âRemember,â said Aunt Sophie to Juliette, âa time will come, I am sure of it, when, after various Jacobin and Buonapartist experiments, after a series of revolutions, you will remember how wise, how essentially French, how truly national, were the opinions of your old aunts.â[10]\n\nThe last months of 1847 Juliette was permitted to spend with her parents. BlÃ©rancourt in those days was becoming, under Dr. Lambertâs influence, a centre of violent political agitation. The number of Dr. Lambertâs disciples was increasing daily, and his socialistic ideas were being promulgated in the neighbouring villages. Mme. Seron wrote constantly demanding her granddaughterâs return. She feared that from being a Republican, which was bad enough, Juliette would be made into a socialist, converted from a pagan naturiste, as she called it, into an atheist. Finally, such remonstrances passing unheeded, she threatened that if her granddaughter were not immediately restored she would disinherit her, and Juliette would be reduced to depend for her dowry on such savings as her father might accumulate. This practically [Pg 21] meant that Juliette would have no dowry at all. For Dr. Lambert, far from saving, could never keep any money in his pocket. In face of poverty and distress he was a veritable St. Martin of Tours, and would give away the very clothes from his back. But to one whose mind was set so far above filthy lucre Mme. Seronâs threat was meaningless. And to his mother-in-lawâs letter he replied that Juliette would not need a dowry as he had decided to marry her to a working-man. But such a destiny did not suit Mlle. Juliette at all. She had often dreamed of a cottage, of a farm, but always with a gentleman (un monsieur) for husband. And when her father told her of this letter, she exclaimed: âOf course you are joking.â âBut no,â he replied; âthat really is my idea.â âThen it is not mine,â[11] retorted this eleven-year-old socialist, to whom her fatherâs design seemed utterly preposterous and cruel to the last degree.\n\nTrue, she loved the people more and more every day. True, it seemed to her in moments of exaltation that she was ready to sacrifice herself in their service; but that she, whom generations had raised above them, should become one of them, no. Father and daughter were equally violent. This, their first disagreement, was, to say the least of it, tempestuous. And it was well that Mme. Seron arrived the next day to take her granddaughter back to the less exalted atmosphere of Chauny.\n\nThough Dr. Lambert continued to cherish his dream of a working-class marriage for Juliette, for the time being he ceased to urge its fulfilment; and for the time being Juliette found it not impossible to reconcile her socialism with filial devotion.\n\nAt Chauny she found that her grandmotherâs political principles, like those of the aunts at Chivres, had undergone a change. Mme. Seron had lost her passion for the citizen king. She had come to realise the necessity for reform. Juliette was delighted, and she expected her father to be equally pleased by his mother-in-lawâs partial conversion. But she did not then know human nature. It was not until much later that she understood how a partisan is far more distrustful of opinions differing slightly from his own than of those which are more remote. Dr. Lambert mistrusted a reform movement led by M. Odillon [Pg 22] Barot as strongly as the aunts at Chivres mistrusted any reform advocated by that extreme liberal, M. Ledru-Rollin.\n\nJulietteâs schooling had been interrupted by her three months at Chauny, and also by a visit to Boulogne, to which we shall refer later, paid in company with her father in the summer of 1847.\n\nAfter Christmas she returned to the pensionnat. Many changes had taken place in the school during the five years which had elapsed since that eventful day when she made her dÃ©but as a scholar. The ogress, Mme. Dufey, had been succeeded by two friends of Julietteâs mother, the Mlles. AndrÃ©. The school had expanded, and a new building had been erected on the site, alas! of Mme. Seronâs garden, in which Juliette had spent some of her most entrancing hours. On the occasion of the destruction of this her land of delight, her âtemple of verdure,â as she called it, there had been a long and violent battle between this little devotee of nature and her grandmother. The excuse that the garden had been sold in order to provide Juliette with a dowry did not appeal to her in the least. Money had never loomed large in the childâs imagination. She loathed the mention of it; for it always seemed to her to lead to family quarrels. The only use she had for it personally was for the purchase of sugar-drops, which she distributed among her schoolfellows.\n\nIt was long before the little girl could be persuaded to enter the building which seemed to her the grave of her brightest dreams and her most cherished joys.\n\nNow, in the early weeks of 1848, Juliette found her school seething with a political excitement, which she, with her violent views, was the last person to allay.\n\nWith an important air the young politicians of the Pensionnat AndrÃ© went about announcing âlâheure des rÃ©formes a sonnÃ©.â The playground echoed with cries of âVive la RÃ©forme!â âA bas Guizot!â The sympathies of the youthful reformers were entirely with the people, le grand peuple. They were transported into a veritable fury on the day when they heard that âthe peopleâ had been massacred, the inoffensive people, engaged in a manifestation strictly within the bounds of the law! Upon the heels of these tidings, however, followed quickly the news that âthe peopleâ were revenged. Louis [Pg 23] Philippe, after having twice failed to form a ministry, the Duchess of OrlÃ©ans, after a vain attempt to establish a regency, were in flight. âThe peopleâ had raised barricades, âthe peopleâ had proclaimed the Republic. âThe people,â read Juliette and her schoolfellows in the columns of La DÃ©mocratie Pacifique, had behaved magnificently, they had shown themselves worthy of every kind of liberty. Not a theft, not a single violation of property, had been committed. âThe people,â in rags (loqueteux) put up notices, âDeath to Thieves,â in the corridors of the Tuileries. âThe people,â themselves penniless, had protected the treasures in the Bank.\n\nOn the great day of the Revolution, the 26th of February, Dr. Lambert came over to Chauny. He was in the seventh heaven of delight. Even Mme. Seron did not seem alarmed at the monarchyâs collapse. Her husband, however, was less pleased. He had thought that the Revolution would be made on behalf of his hero, Louis Buonaparte. And this soldier of la grande armÃ©e vented his spleen on the first republican who came to his hand. This unhappy republican[12] chanced to be his son-in-law. âYour Republic,â he jeered, âyour stupidly democratic Republic!â\n\nâBut,â writes Juliette, âfather only laughed, grandmother smiled, and I saidâ\n\nââAh! my poor grandfather, your Buonaparte must be very sick at our Republic, however socialist he has pretended to be.ââ\n\nJuliette remembers that, towards the end of dinner on that fateful 26th of February, her grandfather, having, by way of consolation for his disappointment, drunk an extra bottle or so of his petit Macon, opening his eyes very wide, addressed his family, and said: âWell! I see the future as clear as day!... I see your Republic, do you hear me, Lambert? Do you hear me, Juliette? I see it trampled under foot by my Buonaparte. I tell you, I scream it at you: revolutions, donât you know, always end in empires.â[13]\n\nAt school next day Juliette found all her friends in a state of great agitation. Half of the scholars had stayed away. Their parents had been afraid to let them leave home. The Revolution might spread into the provinces. There was a glass factory in the town, and all the workmen [Pg 24] were in favour of the Republic. Might they not proclaim it at Chauny, and revolt and perhaps plunder?\n\nHardly had Juliette arrived at school than she was summoned to the study of the Mlles. AndrÃ©. There she was questioned as to what her father thought of the situation.\n\nââWell, Juliette, your father must be highly pleased, he who has always been a republican. Have you seen him?â\n\nââYes, mesdemoiselles, he came yesterday, and he is delighted. He says that at last France will show herself worthy of her history, that she will govern herself, that all the European nations will admire us and perhaps follow our example, that it is the coming of the people, the real people, which is not corrupt like the middle-class, and which ...â\n\nââThat is enough,â interrupted the eldest Mlle. AndrÃ© drily. âI hope, Juliette, that you will keep your fatherâs fine notions to yourself. I forbid you to speak of them here.â\n\nââIn the schoolroom, mademoiselle?â\n\nââIn the schoolroom and in the playground.â\n\nâI looked Mlle. AndrÃ© in the face,â writes Juliette. I was almost as tall as she; and I repliedâ\n\nââThat, mademoiselle, I canât promise you; for there are a great many of us republicans in the school, and no one can prevent our talking about the Republic and loving it.â\n\nââBut France has not accepted your Republic,â replied the youngest Mlle. AndrÃ©, Mlle. Sophie.\n\nââIt will accept it, mademoiselle, because this time the people will vote.ââ\n\nThe Mlles. AndrÃ© were perplexed. They hesitated between their desire to shut the mouth of their precocious and self-assertive pupil, and their reluctance to be hard on their friendâs daughter, and also to annoy the republican parents of the other scholars.\n\nFinally they decided to bring the interview to a close by the following judicious remark: âWhen you see your father, Juliette, you may tell him from us that we hope his Republic will bring peace to France and not agitate it further.â\n\nOn coming forth from the mistressesâ presence, Juliette [Pg 25] was, of course, the object of universal interest among the scholars. They were burning to know what had passed in the principalsâ sanctum. But they could not satisfy their curiosity until school was over. The lessons that morning were not well known, and the general excuse was the Republic. âMademoiselle, I have not had time to do my lessons because of the Republic.â\n\nâMademoiselle, I couldnât work because of the Republic.â\n\nâI fail to understand,â was the icy retort, âhow the Republic can be any concern of yours.â\n\nThere was a deep silence, and then a voiceâit was Julietteâsâmade answer.\n\nâBut, mademoiselle, it interests us passionately.â\n\nThe end of morning school was a regular riot. The pupils rushed out into the playground, where they surrounded Juliette, in a crowd, clamouring to receive a full account of her famous interview. She, on her part, was only too eager to relate it in every detail, and to follow it by an appeal to her comrades to bear themselves like true and worthy republicans, not to be insolent towards their teachers, but to make them realise that, although younger than they, the Republic regarded them as their eldersâ equals. Then followed a babel of conversation. Each schoolgirl had her own idea of what the Republic should do. But all were agreed that the first reform must be the establishment of universal suffrage. No mere tax-payersâ franchise would satisfy these ardent suffragettes. Every one must vote, men, women, and, of course, schoolgirls. Only thus could the Mlles. AndrÃ©âs pupils conceive of a really universal suffrage, and later they prided themselves on having invented it.\n\nNothing in the Revolution pleased Julietteâs father better than the opening of the National Workshops. An ardent believer in the right to work, he, with his idol, Louis Blanc, had always advocated them. And though Louis Blanc did not appear to be directly concerned with those that the Government was establishing, Dr. Lambert, like most people, believed that he was secretly connected with them. They had not been running more than a few weeks, however, when he began to suspect that he had been mistaken. As time went on he grew less and less satisfied with the Republic. There were too many reactionaries in the National Assembly. This Republic, [Pg 26] from which he had hoped so much, was too pleasing to comfortable middle-class people like his mother-in-law.\n\nâJean Louis,â she would say, âI find that I agree very well with your Republic.â âWait a little,â her son-in-law would reply at first. By and by he would answer: âYou agree with it better than I do.â And finally there came a day when he exclaimed: âNo wonder you approve of the Republic, for it is constituted for your advantage! The OrlÃ©ans may come back and they will not need to alter anything as far as their bourgeois supporters are concerned.â[14]\n\nSeeing his dream of a Christian, classical, social, scientific Republic vanish, Dr. Lambert resumed his old part of malcontent, and, of course, Juliette followed suit. She filled the house with her recriminations. She made herself excessively disagreeable to her grandparents. Her grandfather infuriated her by chuckling with delight and repeating: âAll this augurs well for the Empire.â\n\nThat which most distressed Juliette and her father was the failure of the National Workshops. It had become obvious that, far from being organised by Louis Blanc, they had been initiated by his enemies. Ãmile Thomas, who directed them, was suspected of being Louis NapolÃ©onâs agent. Far from constituting, as Dr. Lambert had fondly dreamed, a national benefit and a model for the whole civilised world, they proved useless and costly. They grew like an ulcer; as many as 119,000 men were on the pay-roll. They were a club of loafers, a reserve army of insurrection, a perpetual strike supported out of public money. No wonder there was talk of suppressing them. But Dr. Lambert, though bitterly disappointed with the way they were conducted, was horrified at the idea of suddenly depriving of occupation and turning adrift these thousands of workmen. It would mean, he thought, nothing short of a sanguinary revolution. Juliette, of course, shared her fatherâs horror. What had âthe people,â âthe peopleâ who had behaved so admirably on the 26th of February, done to deserve such treacherous treatment? She could think of nothing else. Her rage and disappointment were such that she became absolutely insupportable. And when her grandmother remonstrated with her, she implored to be allowed to go to BlÃ©rancourt [Pg 27] to her father, who shared her disappointment. But Mme. Seron was still living in dread of her son-in-lawâs threat of a working-class marriage for his daughter. She had other ideas for Juliette. âAlready,â she told her little granddaughter, âyou have pleased young Xââ, who is seventeen; and his father, half in jest, half in earnest, because of your age, has suggested that in a few yearsâ time there might be an alliance between the families.â Moreover, Mme. Seron did not wish again to interrupt her daughterâs studies. So she proposed a compromise. Instead of going to BlÃ©rancourt, Juliette might become a boarder at the pension.[15]\n\nThis suggestion was a terrible blow to Juliette. That such a proposal should come from her grandmother, that she, who generally complained of the length of the school hours which deprived her of her idolised granddaughterâs company, should now of her own free will suggest a far longer separation, seemed incredible. The child was quick to see that her own behaviour had brought her grandmother to such a pass. By her ravings and recriminations she had made herself intolerable. Her grandmother was glad to get rid of her.\n\nâI was thunderstruck,â she writes. âNothing but wicked pride kept me from throwing myself on my grandmotherâs neck and asking pardon for my folly; for I realised how wild and extravagant I had been. But what grandmother had told me about Xââ, a tall youth, whom I thought both handsome and clever, had so puffed me up that I could not see a young person like myself, close upon twelve, kneeling to ask forgiveness like a little girl. So, though my heart was in my mouth all the while, I merely saidâ\n\nââVery well, grandmother, it is understood, I will be a boarder as soon as you like.â\n\nââTo-morrow,â she replied.â\n\nIt will be seen from these reflections that her fatherâs and grandmotherâs adoration had not, as it might well have done, completely warped their idolised Julietteâs disposition. They had made her absurdly vain, but they had not stifled a certain critical sense which even at that early age the little girl was beginning to turn upon herself. In this wholesome exercise she was encouraged by [Pg 28] her motherâs severity. Whenever her father praised, her mother scolded.\n\nâWhen father,â she writes, âspoke of my intelligence and my good looks, mother declared that I was as stupid as I was plain. It seemed to me that both of them exaggerated. And I began to judge myself, as I have done ever since, with a certain detachment. At heart I am really grateful to my mother for having preserved me from complete self-satisfaction.â[16]\n\nJulietteâs career as a boarding-school miss, which resulted from her enthusiasm for and her disappointment with the scheme of National Workshops, was destined to be as short-lived as that great national experiment.\n\nIt was bad enough to be un enfant gÃ¢tÃ© removed from her fond relatives and subjected to all the rules of an institution. But her personal sorrows were intensified by the thought of hundreds of thousands of workpeople about to be threatened with starvation. By this apprehension Julietteâs schoolfellows were likewise depressed. An atmosphere of gloom pervaded the playground. Instead of playing games, the girls gathered together to discuss the fate of their unfortunate compatriots. âThere was not one of us,â Juliette writes, âwho did not deny herself goodies in order to save a few pence with which to help these poor people. We were always counting up our resources. We thought we might just be able to feed one of them. I decided that we would address an elegant epistle to the minister TrÃ©lat,[17] whom we abhorred. For him we held responsible for everything. We would propose to him to undertake the support of one of the workmen from the National Workshops. Certainly one out of a hundred thousand (sic)[18] was not much; but if every pension did the same, some would be saved in any case.â[19]\n\nThe composition of such a letter was not easy. In [Pg 29] order to bring to bear upon it as much intelligence as possible, the republican scholars classified themselves in groups, eleven in all. Each group drew up a draft of the letter. These drafts were compared, the best passages selected from each, and finally the letter was dispatched to a friend of Juliette in Paris, that same Professor Charles who had embraced her on her fourth birthday. He was now a public functionary, and he was requested to deliver to the minister the all-important missive.\n\nâDaily,â records Juliette, âwe expected the arrival of our protÃ©gÃ©e, our atelier national, as we called him. He had been instructed by the famous letter to present himself at the Pensionnat AndrÃ©, and to announce himself as Juliette Lambertâs protÃ©gÃ©e. His benefactresses meanwhile were busily preparing for his arrival. Cakes and sweetmeats were tabooed. âNous Ã©conomisions avec frÃ©nÃ©sie,â writes Juliette. They also, under every imaginable pretext, begged from their friends and relatives.\n\nOne of them had been so fortunate as to obtain a suit of clothes belonging to her brother. Having cleaned and mended it with the greatest care, she kept it in readiness for the atelier national, who would doubtless arrive in rags.\n\nMeanwhile the plot was kept a dead secret; for the conspirators were well aware that their sympathy for ces monstres des ateliers nationaux would meet with no encouragement at home.\n\nWhile at Chauny the Mlles. AndrÃ©âs pupils were eagerly awaiting the arrival of their expected monstre, at Paris affairs were moving quickly. The men who had been paid forty cents a day for digging trenches in the Champs de Mars and filling them up again were sticking to their job in defiance of the Governmentâs orders to disband. The Socialists sympathised with them and organised street manifestations in their favour. Finally, on the 23rd of June, the capital broke out into open insurrection. It was at this juncture that Juliette received, not the eagerly expected atelier national, but a letter from Professor Charles which dashed all her hopes to the ground. He, to whom had been entrusted that elegant epistle to the minister, had basely deserted the young friends who had confided in him. Professor Charles had no sympathy with the State-employed workmen; he described them in his letter to Juliette as ces misÃ©rables qui tâintÃ©ressent. Charles was [Pg 30] immediately banished from Julietteâs heart. Her ex-ami Charles, she called him, severely, when she announced to her comrades this terrible disappointment.\n\nThen there followed much secret confabulation among the Republican groups of the pension. The pupils agreed that while blood was flowing in the streets of Paris, they at Chauny could not remain inactive. Already the revolution in the capital was finding an echo in the provincial town. Bands of rebels were marching down the streets. Why should not les demoiselles de la pension AndrÃ© join them? Juliette counted among her treasures a large handkerchief given her by her father and emblazoned with the words: Vive la RÃ©publique, DÃ©mocratique et Sociale. Attaching this emblem to a pole abstracted from the wood-shed, the girls, under Julietteâs leadership, organised themselves into a procession and marched round the playground, crying: âLong live the Democratic and Social Republic. Long live the rebels. We will not disband. We will not disband.â\n\nThis manifestation, the tumultuous scenes to which it led, the defiant words which she addressed to her governesses, resulted in Julietteâs expulsion from school. For the Mlles. AndrÃ© rightly regarded her as the leader of the revolution.\n\nMlle. Sophie conducted her back to her grandmotherâs house. Mme. Seron was already regretting having sent her granddaughter away. She would, therefore, have been glad to see her back under almost any circumstances. But to find her distinguishing herself as the originator and ringleader of a rebellion gratified the pride and ambition of her own rebellious heart. So, after listening to Mlle. Sophieâs story, Mme. Seron said with dignity: âIf you regard her behaviour as a defiance of your authority, then you are quite right to dismiss her.... But this episode shows me Juliette as I like to see her, displaying a determination and a courage such as are not given to every one. Since, without my seeking her, the child has been brought back to me, neither she nor I will be distressed. I have rather, mademoiselle, to thank you than to ask you to reconsider your decision.â\n\nThus after a few weeks terminated Julietteâs career as a boarder, and, indeed, her schooldays, for she never returned to the pension.\n\n[Pg 31]\n\nAt Chivres, whither, on the 1st of July, Juliette went for a three monthsâ visit, she found herself promptly deposed from the pedestal on to which, as a reward for her defiance of authority, her grandmother and her father, too, had elevated her. The aunts had never heard of such nonsense; they scolded her roundly for her conduct. They had no sympathy whatever with the ateliers nationaux. And, during the violent suppression of the rising which followed, their sympathies were entirely with the bourgeoisie. Juliette was condemned to keep her opinions to herself, and even to read the newspaper by stealth. Instead of arguing about things she did not understand, she worked hard at her Latin. And in the serenity of her auntsâ presence, contrasting with their educated minds her own empty little head, she came to see herself as she really was: a pretentious young person, very ignorant, and fond of airing opinions she had borrowed from other people.\n\nConsequently it was in a chastened frame of mind that Juliette returned in the autumn to Chauny. And her grandmother found her quite willing to fall in with the new scheme of life which she suggested. The storms of the past had strengthened Mme. Seronâs conviction that Juliette was a child to be led and not driven. In broaching the subject of her future studies, therefore, Mme. Seron began with this tactful observationâ\n\nâNow, my Juliette, you will do exactly as you like. You will learn what you wish, or you will, if you prefer it, learn nothing at all. But there is one thing in which I do ask you to take an interest: that is housekeeping. I will give you complete charge of our house for six months. You shall be its mistress to order and to spend. I shall merely advise you. As you are fond of the appointing, the arrangement, the decoration of a home, you will have full scope for the development of your taste. If you would like lessons in cooking and sewing, you have only to say so. I want to persuade you, too, that an art, and above all arts, music, embellishes life. The new organist is a remarkably good teacher. The piano bores you, but I wish you to cultivate your voice. And then I have another wish: I want you to try the violin. But, I repeat, you shall do as you like in everything.â[20]\n\n[Pg 32]\n\nTo these diplomatic suggestions Juliette was graciously pleased to replyâ\n\nâGrandmother, I shall be delighted to keep house; it will be very interesting. I will certainly learn the violin. That will be quite out of the common: and I will cultivate my voice.â\n\nHow the Seron household fared during the rÃ©gime of this young lady of twelve Juliette has not told us. But that her grandmotherâs somewhat bold experiment was in the end eminently successful is attested by the fact that throughout her long life Mme. Adam has been renowned as a first-rate maÃ®tresse de maison; and that this reputation is fully justified is the experience of all those who, like the present writer, have partaken of her lavish hospitality.\n\nAs for the rest of her studies, Mme. Seron had been well advised to leave it to her granddaughter to decide as to whether she would continue them. Juliette was far too ambitious to be content with her very meagre knowledge. And it was at her own suggestion that her father was asked to draw up a time-table for his daughter.\n\nA professor from the boysâ school opposite was engaged to give her lessons; and Dr. Lambert himself, when he came to Chauny, superintended her studies. He read her Racine, and persuaded her to copy daily five pages from the pen of that great French classic. The doctor, as we have said, was himself a pure classicist. He used to say to his daughter, âBe a Grecian, Juliette, if you desire initiation into the worship of the eternally beautiful, into all that raises man above the age in which he lives.â[21]\n\nIn order to accustom his daughter to what he called the admirable sonority of notre langue initiatrice he read her passages from Homer in the Greek original. He dictated to her word by word translations of whole chapters of the Iliad and the Odyssey. In these lessons, in his own reading and in his talks with Juliette, Dr. Lambert found consolation for his bitter political disillusionment. âBooks,â he would say, âare our greatest solace, when everything else is taken from us they remain.â[22]\n\nHe refused to talk of politics. The collapse of the June insurrection, its brutal suppression by General Cavaignac, [Pg 33] and, finally, the election on the 10th of December, 1848, of his enemy, Louis NapolÃ©on, as President of the Republic had disappointed all his hopes.\n\nIn the glorious days of the Republicâs dawn Dr. Lambert had consented to be Mayor of BlÃ©rancourt. His daughter describes how she and her grandmother came over from Chauny to see the Mayor, attired in a workmanâs blue blouse and wearing the tricolour scarf tied with red, plant the Tree of Liberty, a young poplar, in the village square. In his delight at what seemed to promise the realisation of all his dreams, this agnostic had become reconciled even to the curÃ©. The village priest was present to bless the Tree of Liberty. And in his speech this broad-minded cleric declared that the Republic, if it practised its doctrines of liberty, fraternity and equality, would realise the gospel ideal, but that it could only rise to such a height provided that all republicans in spirit, if not in form, were as Christian as the new Mayor. Then, much to his daughterâs astonishment, Dr. Lambert replied that the Republic, with its principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, had without doubt originated in Christianity; that Jesus Christ was the first Socialist and the first Republican; that republicans had much to learn from the Church, but that the Church on its side had to learn from republicans to adore nature and to follow science. âMy dear Mayor,â said M. le CurÃ© after the ceremony, âyou would accept the Christian religion blindfold if only it would consent to become pagan.â âYes,â replied the Mayor, laughing, âbut I want you in return to accept my paganism, which is founded on a love of nature, on condition that it is inspired by Christian virtues.â\n\nAlas! only a few months later that roseate dawn of optimistic idealism had faded into the night of grim reaction. One by one the socialistic experiments of 1848 had failed. The socialist leader, Louis Blanc, had been discredited and driven into exile. The more moderate Ledru-Rollin, having, like most moderates, failed to please any party, had been excluded from the Government. And by the end of the year, after all her bright dreams of liberty, the one cry which went up from France was for a strong government. The cry was answered by Louis NapolÃ©onâs election to the presidency. Old Dr. Seronâs prophecy had come true. Encouraged by the success of [Pg 34] his divinations, Julietteâs grandfather continued to prognosticate. âSure as my name is Seron,â he declared, âLouis NapolÃ©on Buonaparte, from simple Prince Louis, from simple Buonaparte, will, before the expiration of his presidency, become Emperor NapolÃ©on III.â[23]\n\nâAlas! he is right,â said Dr. Lambert[24].... âAll my beautiful fabric has fallen, stone by stone; and I am crushed beneath its ruins.... Juliette, I shall never again talk or write to you of politics.â But, though abstaining from political talk, Dr. Lambert could not withdraw from interest in political affairs. Though he had resigned his mayoralty, though he had severed all official connection with this sad travesty of a Republic, though the Tree of Liberty which he had planted had been dug up, he still clung to the vestige of his political dreams. And he continued to try to carve out a new destiny for France. If he could not work for her in the open, he would plot and plan in secret. Dr. Lambert, like many another disillusioned French republican, joined one of those secret societies which were being formed all over France. Juliette, when she next visited BlÃ©rancourt, found her parentsâ home the centre of mysterious meetings, her father the recipient of mysterious correspondence which his wife urged him to destroy. One day, rummaging in the attic, Juliette chanced upon a hoard of papers, lists of names and letters, the import of which, enlightened by her parentsâ conversation, she was quick to guess; and instantly there flashed on her vivid imagination the whole danger of the situation. With Juliette Adam action has never failed to follow swiftly upon the heels of thought. An hour or two after that discovery Juliette was busy making herself a big pocket, which she tied round her waist and wore beneath her frock. In a day or two that which she dreaded happened. Dr. Lambertâs house was visited by the Procureur de la RÃ©publique, accompanied by an escort of gendarmes. To the dismay of Julietteâs parents the Procureur produced a document entitling him to search the house. He began with the doctorâs desk in the room where the family was then sitting at lunch.\n\nâWhat you are doing is not at all nice. It is even indiscreet,â said Juliette, much to the functionaryâs [Pg 35] amusement. It was a sultry midsummer day. Said Juliette to her terrified mother: âMay I not go and tell Blatierâ (the gardener, who, with a scared look, was peeping through the window) âto cool some cider for these gentlemen?â Mme. Lambert made a sign of assent. A minute before, when she had wished to go into another room, a gendarme had prevented her. But no objection was offered to her little girlâs departure. All the while, however, that she was telling Blatier to draw water from the well she felt a gendarmeâs eyes fixed upon her through the window. While the gardener was drawing the water, she went down into the cellar, brought up some bottles, placed them in a pail. Intentionally prolonging the operation, she went down to fetch another pail, then, turning round, made as if she would return slowly to the room. But no sooner was she out of the gendarmeâs sight than with one bound, having taken off her shoes, she flew upstairs to the attic, seized the papers, slipped them into her pocket, and in a trice had put on her shoes again, was back in the sitting-room, having apparently come straight from her cider-cooling in the courtyard. M. le Procureur was still busily searching. Having examined the living-rooms, he and his escort searched the stable, the coach-house, the cellar. Then, leaving one gendarme below, he went up into the attic.\n\nâWhen father heard them go upstairs,â writes Juliette, âhe rose, he looked very agitated, and I saw mother, saying to herself: âThe papers must be there; we are lost.â\n\nâThen, taking a glass of cider, I went up to father, whom the gendarme was closely observing. He put away the glass I offered him, but I, as if persuading him to drink, bent towards him and whispered: âBe calm. I have the papers.â Father drank the glass of cider at one gulp. I embraced him. The gendarme was touched by our affection. Father clasped[25] me in his arms so tight that I thought I should have been stifled!...â\n\nThe Procureur de la RÃ©publique came downstairs. Before leaving he said to Juliette: âMademoiselle, I am glad to tell you that we have found nothing to compromise your father. Had we discovered proofs of the matters of which he stands accused it would have been [Pg 36] serious. For your fatherâs name figures on the list of those liable to arrest, imprisonment, or even deportation. He is reputed a dangerous revolutionary and propagandist to boot.â\n\nâThank you, sir,â replied Juliette. âAs you are so fatherly to me, you, too, must have a daughter.â The Procureur smiled, but did not reply.\n\nFor the time, this child of thirteen had saved her fatherâs liberty, perhaps his life. But she had not placed him out of danger, because she had not cured him of plotting against the Government. Henceforth, indeed, until Dr. Lambertâs death, his daughter was to live in constant dread of her fatherâs so embroiling himself with the authorities as to be clapped into prison or even deported. The episode we have just related was only the first of many times when he narrowly escaped arrest. When, years later, Juliette was living with her father in Paris and he was late in returning to meals, she always expected to hear that he was in prison.\n\nNot long after this domiciliary visit, in the spring of 1850, Dr. Lambert entertained the idea of giving up his practice at BlÃ©rancourt, and joining one of the phalansteries or socialistic communities then in vogue. However, he listened to the entreaties of his family and renounced this project.\n\nâJuliette,â said Mme. Seron to her granddaughter, âhow can you wish a country to be led by persons so wild as your father?â âAnd, for the moment,â writes Juliette, âI agreed with her.â\n\n[Pg 37]\n\nIt will be seen from the events recorded in the last chapter that Juliette at thirteen was both mentally and morally much more developed than a young English girl of eighteen or even twenty. Children in France, largely because they associate constantly with their elders instead of being relegated to the nursery, grow up more quickly than in England. A little French girl often is quite a little woman. She will go with her mother to pay calls, and at home help her mother to entertain visitors. The system in vogue in Julietteâs childhood of marrying girls at fifteen or sixteen naturally favoured their early development. The early marriage was the outcome of the mariage de convenance, which was more general in Julietteâs youth than now. When marriages were arranged by the family it was unnecessary to wait until the young people, the bride at any rate, was old enough to choose wisely for herself. Though it would not have been admitted that girls were married against their will, though their consent to the marriage was generally asked, not by the aspirant, usually, but by the girlsâ parents, it was a mere matter of form, everything having been settled beforehand. Moreover, the girl in question, when appealed to in this perfunctory manner, was not encouraged to consult her heart. Indeed, that very uncertain and awkward factor is not supposed to intervene in what is known as the real French marriage. It is essentially a business affair, a matter of social position and of pounds, shillings and pence. We shall find, for instance, that in arranging a marriage for her granddaughter, Mme. Seronâs chief concern was that Juliette [Pg 38] should have an establishment in Paris. This, in the first place, would give her an opportunity of displaying to full advantage her many gifts, and, secondly, would enable her fond grandmother to shine in metropolitan circles, for Mme. Seron hoped to make some arrangement whereby she could for a considerable part of the year reside with her granddaughter.\n\nJuliette was not married until she was sixteen. But, as we have seen, no sooner had she entered her teens than her grandmother and father beganâin divergent directions, of courseâto make plans for her alliance.\n\nIt was about this time, that the parents of young Xââ, a youth of seventeen, proposed to Mme. Seron that in a few years he should marry Juliette. The following year brought a renewal of this proposal and also a second offer of marriage from another quarter. Dr. Lambert refused to listen to either of these requests for his daughterâs hand. His persistence in his idea of a working-class marriage for his daughter drove his mother-in-law into a frenzy and produced another drame de famille. Mme. Seron threatened her son-in-law with the gendarmes if he attempted to carry out his nefarious scheme. Dr. Lambert threatened to take Juliette abroad out of her grandmotherâs reach. But in the end Mme. Seron conquered, and Dr. Lambert went off in a towering rage. For several months he ceased to visit Chauny.\n\nJuliette, who had now grown into a handsome girl, had already attracted considerable attention at Chauny. Those who are privileged to know her now, in her declining years, can see how lovely she must have been in her youth. âShe has had that singular good fortune ...,â writes one of her friends to-day, âto have been adorably beautiful (adorablement belle).â[26] The delicately moulded features, the animated expression, the satirical glance, the dignified bearing, the vivacious manner, which at eighty never fail to charm, must have indeed been dazzling in her far-off girlhood. In a word, Juliette Lambert was as gifted physically as mentally. No wonder that when, wearing a pretty blonde cap with pink roses, and escorted by her grandfather and an old friend, Blondeau, who lived in the same house, she made her first appearance at the Chauny theatre, there was quite a sensation, although [Pg 39] when she returned her grandmother had to scold her for having marred her beauty by weeping over the play.\n\nThe quarrel between Mme. Seron and her son-in-law having died down, Juliette was permitted to spend the Christmas of 1850, and to stay on into the New Year, at BlÃ©rancourt.\n\nIt was during this visit that she made the acquaintance of the man who was to be her first husband. She was told one day that her father expected a friend to lunch, that the guest was an advanced republican and a Comtist to boot. This was the first time that Juliette had heard that name of Comte, which she was to learn to know only too well later. The guest came. He was a barrister (avocat) at the Paris Court of Appeal. But he lived at Soissons, where he was conducting a series of law-suits on behalf of an aunt. His name was Lamessine. He was of the south Italian type, with dark eyes, olive skin and shining black hair, for his grandfather had been a Sicilian who had settled in France and been naturalised during the Revolution. Dr. Lambertâs visitor was reputed a man of talent. His brilliant conversation pleased Juliette; but she detested the scepticism which led him to maintain that good is merely the necessary balance to evil, and that society must grow increasingly corrupt until it produces a new âvegetation.â Against such doctrines Juliette could not refrain from protesting. There was an animated discussion between the Sicilian, who believed in nothing, and his hostâs idealist daughter, who was ready to believe in everything that was good. The guest departed with the words, âAnd I hope you bear me no grudge, Mademoiselle la Batailleuse.â âI only pray,â she replied, âthat Heaven may reveal to you some knowledge, however slight, of the good and the beautiful.â[27]\n\nIn the spring, while Juliette was visiting her aunts, M. Lamessine came to Chivres. There, though he found La Batailleuse more charming than ever in her peasantâs costume, which by clever contrivances and adaptations she had learnt to make extremely becoming, he met with a cold welcome from the aunts and was not encouraged to return. In June, however, while Juliette was at BlÃ©rancourt, he came to see her again. Political affairs were moving towards NapolÃ©onâs December coup dâÃ©tat and the [Pg 40] empire which Dr. Seron had so persistently prophesied. There was a mysterious meeting at Dr. Lambertâs. And the next day Julietteâs father said to her, âThe crisis is grave; but we have with us a man in whose veins flows the blood of the carbonari. He will do something.â That man was M. Lamessine.\n\nIn December the barrister came to plead at Chauny. He presented a letter of introduction to Dr. and Mme. Seron. They, unlike the aunts, received him most cordially. Having been invited to dinner, he told Juliette that, influenced by her arguments he had become less sceptical. She did not believe him. She was vaguely conscious of some ulterior motive in his words. She felt ill at ease and left the salon early. On the morrow her grandmother announced that M. Lamessine had asked for her hand in marriage, that his treatment of the important matter of settlements was satisfactory, and that he was willing for Mme. Seron to spend every winter with her granddaughter and her husband when they should go to live in Paris.\n\nBut Juliette was not the kind of young person thus to be married out of hand and merely to please her grandmother. She was thunderstruck at such an announcement. She would not dream, she protested, of marrying a man who was twice her age. In vain did Mme. Seron plead that M. Lamessine was trÃ¨s bien, that his coming was providential, that resembling feature for feature one of the heroes of her favourite novelist Balzac, he could not fail to be the most suitable of husbands. âYou must admit that I am right, Juliette,â she said, and forthwith she took down the volume in question and read the description. But even this striking likeness failed to reconcile her recalcitrant granddaughter to the match. Juliette appealed to her grandfather and to her old friend Blondeau, to save her from so uncongenial a mating, but to no purpose, for Mme. Seron had already won them over to her side. There was, however, one member of the family who would be less easy to convince. And Juliette, as was her custom, called in BlÃ©rancourt to redress the balance at Chauny. Dr. Lambert, knowing more about the proposed bridegroom than his mother-in-law, was horrified at the idea of his marrying his daughter. A few days later when he and his wife came over to Chauny, he was aghast to [Pg 41] find how far things had gone. He would, he declared, never give his consent to the marriage.\n\nThroughout the succeeding months there followed a long-drawn-out war of words, enlivened by perpetual drames de famille. At one time Juliette was forcibly carried off by her father to BlÃ©rancourt, then brought back to Chauny by her mother, who desired the match and kept her at Chauny out of her fatherâs influence. He, unhappy man, worn out by domestic grief and political disappointment, fell ill, and during his illness once again narrowly escaped arrest. Finally, his wife and mother-in-law broke down his resistance. By their importunity they had rendered his life unbearable. In a moment of passion he seems to have said: âVery well, do what you will,â then to have given his formal consent, without which they could do nothing, and to have signed the fatal document which sealed Julietteâs unhappiness. Almost immediately Dr. Lambert repented; but it was too late, and all he could do was to signify his disapproval by absenting himself from the wedding.\n\nThe unhappy subject of so much dissension had been reduced almost to welcome marriage even with so uncongenial a mate as M. Lamessine as one way of escape from perpetual family quarrels.\n\nBut alas! experience proved that Dr. Lambertâs objections to the union had been only too well founded. âThe man whom they have chosen for your husband,â her father had written to her, âis not one whom you can ever love or who will ever love you.â\n\nWith a delicate hand and in a few poignant phrases Mme. Adam in her Souvenirs passes lightly over her married misery. Until after her daughter was born, in September 1854, she kept her sufferings to herself, dreading the anguish which a revelation of them would inflict on her loved ones. It was during her confinement at BlÃ©rancourt that Dr. Lambert discovered her unhappiness. Some months later, while she was visiting her granddaughter, it was borne in on Mme. Seron that she had committed the gravest of blunders in marrying Juliette against her will. Now that the last instalment of his wifeâs dowry had been paid, M. Lamessine shamelessly avowed that he had never intended to keep his promise of receiving his wifeâs grandmother as an inmate of his home every winter.\n\n[Pg 42]\n\nâYou imagine Juliette happy,â he said. âShe is not. Our misunderstandings are perpetual. If we had you as a third, what would they be like?â\n\nâIs it true, Juliette, that you are unhappy?â\n\nâYes,â she replied, âas unhappy as it is possible to be.â\n\nMme. Seron rose. She leant against a piece of furniture to avoid falling, for she shook like a tree which has been uprooted.\n\nShe reminded her son-in-law of his promises. âThey were only necessary,â he remarked cynically, âas long as you had not completely fulfilled yours.â\n\nMme. Seron left the house abruptly. Juliette never saw her again. She went home to Chauny to die. In eleven months she was followed by her husband, Dr. Seron, for, as he said, he could not live without âhis dear scoldâ (sa chÃ¨re grondeuse).\n\nDuring the first three years of their married life the Lamessines resided at Soissons. But during that time they paid a visit to Paris; and Juliette had her first unforgettable impression of that brilliant city which had figured so large in the dreams of herself and her grandmother.\n\nWhen Lamessine first proposed to her that she should wean her baby, Alice, and come with him to Paris, she trembled. For in Paris, she felt, her lot would be cast. Paris held her destiny. Her grandmotherâs spirit seemed to dominate hers as soon as Paris entered into her life.\n\nâBah,â said her father, when she told him of her hesitation. âDonât be afraid of it. Set foot in it bravely. Look it in the face, this Paris. One of two things will happen: either you will make your name there, as your poor grandmother desired, and then the trials of your unhappy marriage will not have been in vain; or you will break your bonds and come back to your father. With us you will lead a life, if not happy, at least free from those marital responsibilities which fill me with fear for your future.â[28]\n\nThe Paris which Juliette visited in 1855 was Paris of the early Second Empire, âstill in the freshness of its hopes and enthusiasm.â It was Paris of the first universal [Pg 43] exhibition, which was visited by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Paris at the close of the Cri"
