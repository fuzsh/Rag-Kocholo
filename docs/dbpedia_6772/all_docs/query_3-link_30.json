        "text": "LA MARCHE DIVINE DES VOYAGEURS\n\nWe are pleased to present you the divine exhibition of the Travellers by the artist Bruno Catalano, on the square in front of the historic church of Notre-Dame-de-l’Assomption, a Polish Catholic place of worship located on Place Maurice-Barrès, at the corner of Rue Saint-Honoré and Rue Cambon in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.\n\nThe Assumption celebrates both death and resurrection. This is why it seemed obvious to us to honor, on this place of worship, the work of Bruno Catalano, celebrating the abandonment of self, of one’s roots and of one’s material goods towards a rebirth through exile.\n\nThree bronze “Travellers” who set out towards the unknown, suitcases in hand.\n\nThe worker “Bleu de chine“, the artist “Van Gogh” or the mystic “Non finito” looking in the same direction but taking different paths.\n\nVoluntary journey towards a horizon that we embrace and that we would like to be infinite, or forced journey, constrained by exile and suffering, in search of freedom and guided by survival. Bruno Catalano’s traveller is this man left to himself, a man propelled into the infinity of time and space.\n\nHis house is now only a suitcase and his being, gradually, will strip itself of everything it believed indispensable, of its whole self so cleverly constructed by our societies. He is no longer the man of a world, but the man in the world, still imbued with his culture but now fragile in the face of immensity. His quest will not be without damage. A defragmented, destabilized man, stripped of his bearings, he walks towards his salvation as much as towards his loss. From now on, everything will have to be reinvented. This traveler escapes from himself, to meet his unknown land."
