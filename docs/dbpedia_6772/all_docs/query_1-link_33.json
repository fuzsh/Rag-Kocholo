        "text": "The Action Française was neither a widespread nor a powerful nor a successful political movement, and its political objectives were anachronistic to the point of absurdity. Its intention to carry out a coup d'état could not be taken seriously when its leaders were so eager to find reasons for avoiding or postponing action.1 Critics of the movement rightly claimed, for this reason, that it did not deserve its name.2 Of course, the Action Francaise always claimed to have considerable political influence, but its very poor showing in the elections of 1919 and 1924,3 when what influence it had was probably at its height, only emphasized the movement's real complexion.\n\n3 Despite the prestige of the movement in 1919, of the dozen seats aimed at only one, that contested by Léon Daudet, was won; in 1924 no Action Française candidate was elected, and votes cast for them were notably less than those cast previously for traditional royalists.\n\n42 Guiraud was later editor of La Croix, which gave the Action Française temporary support. He was also professor of history at t he University of Besançon, and his Histoire partiale, histoire vraie (Paris, 1911–1917),Google Scholar 4 vols, and his history textbooks played an important part in the campaign against‘ official’ republican historiography and history teaching, led by the Action Francaise.\n\n44 Many also belonged to local academies and provincial history societies; for example, the marquis de Roux was president of the Société des Antiquaires de l'Ouest; Louis Dimier, after his break with the Action Française, became a member of the Académie de Savoie and President of the Société des Antiquaires de France.\n\n62 Testimonies to Daudet's charitable nature abound. See for example: Bainville, , Doit-on le dire? (Paris, 1939), p. 207;Google ScholarWiriath, Marcel, Silhouettes (Paris, 1949), pp. 25–8;Google ScholarRosny, J-H. (aîné), Mémoires de la vie littéraire (Paris, 1927), pp. 45–9;Google Scholar and Valois, op. cit. pp. 22 and 160–3; Valois's lasting sympathy for Daudet was in marked contrast to his persistent denigration of all his other former colleagues at the Action Française.\n\n111 As Dimier said: ‘Bon nombre de royalistes, qui ne pouvaient pas nous souffrir, nous regardèrent comme on regarde la peinture cubiste au Salon.’ Vingt ans d'Action Française, p. 70. Léon de Montesquiou was one of the few members of the old aristocracy to take a leading part in the Action Française.\n\n114 This is not to say that the Action Française did not specialize in polemic and abuse: ‘Nous n'insultions pas. Nous diffamions ouvertement, catégoriquement…’. Maurras, , Pour un jeune Français (Paris, 1949), p. 114.Google Scholar But the attitude of the Action Française had nuances even here, as Daudet, , who excelled in journalistic abuse, explained: ‘J'ai horreur de cabotinage, mais je crois qu'il n'y a rien à faire, en politique antidémocratique, sans coups de tonnerre et actes vilement représentatifs.’ Au temps de Judas (Paris, 1920), p. 167.Google Scholar"
