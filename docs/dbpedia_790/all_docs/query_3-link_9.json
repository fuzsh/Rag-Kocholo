        "text": "The death of a man in McLeod Lake has led to criminal charges.\n\nMadison Reid, 42, has been charged with one count of second degree murder in the death of 56-year-old Bruce Norman Archambauld.\n\nReid allegedly called police just after 3 a.m. on Sunday to report that she had been assaulted, but police said when they arrived it became more of a case of who assaulted whom. They found Archambauld on his front porch in need of emergency medical attention, exhibiting signs of a beating.\n\nHe was rushed to hospital in Mackenzie but soon succumbed to his injuries. Police suspicions turned to Reid for reasons not yet disclosed.\n\nFurther mystifying was the apparent lack of connection between Reid and Archambald.\n\n\"I don't know the details of how she ended up at his home, but that is part of the investigation,\" said RCMP spokesman Cpl. Dan Moskaluk. \"We are asking people if they know what the possible link is between these two.\"\n\nThe court proceedings for Reid will take place in Prince George.\n\nAnyone with information that might help the investigation can call Mackenzie RCMP at 250-997-3288 or anonymously call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS / www.pgcrimestoppers.bc.ca."
