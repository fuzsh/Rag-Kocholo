        "text": "J. Norman Reid is retired from more than 30 years' public service at the state and federal levels, where he specialized in rural community and economic development. Author of several books and many dozens of articles on these and other subjects, he now devotes his time to writing, photography, woodworking, and model railroading. Although his latest book focuses on model railroad photography, he is equally fond of writing murder mysteries and about woodworking. He writes a monthly book review for Highland Woodworking's Wood News Online, as well as articles on woodworking for Highland Woodworking's blog. He is nowhere happier than being in the woodshop or in the field, camera in hand, photographing wildlife or landscapes.\n\nA throwback perhaps to earlier times, he customarily writes out his first drafts longhand using one of his prized fountain pens. He finds the slower pace of writing by hand to favor more thoughtful self-expression, whether he is making an entry in his daily journal, drafting a book review or creating dialogue for his latest mystery novel."
