        "text": "Post last updated at 5:08 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 7:\n\nWith almost all ballots counted, the incumbent Douglas County district attorney has lost her seat, a longtime incumbent state senator will hold on for the general election and a city commissioner could not unseat an incumbent county commissioner.\n\nVoting Tuesday morning was a bit slow, but it picked up in the afternoon, Douglas County Clerk Jamie Shew said.\n\nAll results are unofficial until they are formally canvassed. There will be more ballots to count through Friday, also, as mail ballots continue to arrive at the elections office.\n\nDouglas County district attorney Democratic primary\n\nIncumbent District Attorney Suzanne Valdez faced Tonda Hill and Dakota Loomis in the Democratic primary.\n\nWith 96% of the county’s precincts reporting, Loomis won by a wide margin. He will advance to the Nov. 5 general election to face Republican Mike Warner.\n\nLoomis had not responded to an email seeking comment or posted to social media about the election results as of the last update to this article.\n\nValdez wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday morning that “While I am disappointed with the election results, I am very proud of my DA team’s accomplishments under my leadership.”\n\n“The policies and practices we have implemented in the last 3.5 years have resulted in tangible change that has impacted many lives for the better,” Valdez’s post continued. “We are reducing the criminal justice footprint by using alternatives to incarceration programs for non-violent offenders and using the criminal justice system for those who commit violent acts and who distribute addictive and deadly drugs, like fentanyl. We also employ robust expungement opportunities, which clears past criminal records so that these individuals can get jobs, housing, and other benefits. I am honored to have served this county as DA. I will continue to serve until January 2025 when the new DA will be sworn in.”\n\nHill wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday night that “I am full of gratitude and respect for the journey we’ve shared. Though the outcome wasn’t what we hoped, I am proud of the conversation we started and the passion that was shared. Thank you to everyone who supported, volunteered, and believed in the vision. While we didn’t win the election, the fight for justice, fairness, and a safer community for everyone doesn’t end here. I look forward to future service to our community.”\n\nDouglas County Commission races\n\nIn District 2, incumbent Commissioner Shannon Reid faced Lawrence City Commissioner Lisa Larsen in the Democratic primary. The winner will advance to face Brad Chun, an independent candidate who filed late last week, in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nIn District 3, Republicans John Landon and Pam McDermott faced off. McDermott, who was also the Republican candidate for that district in 2020, will advance to the Nov. 5 general election to face incumbent Commissioner Karen Willey.\n\nLarsen held a lead throughout early ballot returns, but Reid jumped ahead with another wave counted. With 95% of ballots in, Reid had pulled ahead to a victory.\n\n“I’m honored to represent County Commission District 2, and am grateful to the voters who trust me to keep listening to them and centering them in my policymaking,” Reid said in a statement Tuesday night. “I look forward to earning their votes again in November. I’m also grateful for all of the phenomenal volunteers, advocacy groups, and local businesses who were part of tonight’s victory. I’ll keep fighting for positive systemic change that benefits all of us, especially when it comes to racial equity, anti-poverty policy, and environmental stewardship. I congratulate City Commissioner Larsen on her campaign, and look forward to continuing to work with her when the county and city collaborate on issues facing our community.”\n\nMcDermott said District 3, which represents rural, unincorporated areas of Douglas County, needs strong representation. After November, she hopes to fill that role.\n\n“I’m really thankful for the primary process because when somebody is running against you, you get to work fast,” McDermott said. “And I think that competition is healthy and it’s good, and it forces you to think through your ideas — like going to forums and answering the questionnaires that you guys put out — it helps sharpen your thoughts.”\n\nIn District 4, Democrats Gene Dorsey is running against Mike Kelso. With 96% of precincts counted, it appeared that Dorsey would advance to face Republican Timothy Bruce and Libertarian Steve Jacob in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\n“I thought I had done pretty good outreach in Eudora, but I think the way the tallies came out, I need to do more work over there,” Dorsey said. “And I understand the people in Eudora, they want someone from their hometown representing, and so I’ve got to prove to them that I’m going to represent everybody in the district, and not just Lawrencians.”\n\nKelso wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday night that “Even though tonight’s results aren’t what I had hoped for, I am so very thankful for everyone’s support. I have met and talked to so many people that care about Douglas County. Don’t ever let that change. I will continue to hold our County Commission to support the county as a whole and not just those that live in Lawrence. If I don’t think that is happening, look for me again in two short years.”\n\nAnd in District 5, Erica Anderson and Nicholas Matthews ran as Democrats. Anderson will advance to face Republican Rich Lorenzo and Libertarian Kirsten Kuhn in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nAnderson said she based her campaign on forming relationships, strengthening families and prioritizing community voices. Commitment to lowering property taxes has also been a key issue for her along with all other candidates.\n\n“I built my campaign around building trust. It’s so important as we look forward, since we’re going to have two brand new districts, that we actually build trust,” Anderson said. “I just really enjoy listening and learning and getting to know people, and really sitting down and creating interventions … And it’s OK if we don’t have good outcomes, we still have to be transparent.”\n\nThe District 1 seat, currently held by Patrick Kelly, was included in the 2022 election. Commissioners serve four-year terms, so that seat will be on the ballot again in 2026.\n\nKansas Senate races\n\nIn District 2, longtime incumbent Sen. Marci Francisco faced current Rep. Christina Haswood in the Democratic primary. With 96% of precincts reporting, it was clear that Francisco would hold on to advance to the general, where she will face Republican David Miller.\n\nIn District 19, Democrat Patrick Schmidt edged out challengers ShaMecha King Simms and current Rep. Vic Miller. Schmidt will face the winner of the Republican primary, Tyler Wible, who beat out Cynthia Smith.\n\nIn District 9, incumbent Sen. Beverly Gossage won over Bryan Zesiger in the Republican primary. Gossage will advance to face Norman Mallicoat in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night at Black Stag Brewery and Pub, Francisco told supporters she “absolutely did not get here on my own,” Kansas Reflector reported.\n\n“I have had so many people come out, be willing to walk, be willing to talk to their friends, be willing to write postcards, give me advice, give me endorsements,” she said.\n\nHaswood said in a message Tuesday that she ran for Senate to offer the community a choice in what their leadership looks like for the next four years.\n\n“While my campaign came up short, all the candidates who stepped up this election demonstrate that Douglas County continues to choose progress, compassion, and growth,” Haswood said. “It is a blessing to have so many options for how to chart the path forward, and it makes me proud to call this town home.”\n\nShe said she was grateful to the leaders who have come before her, who have made Lawrence her home and who have encouraged her to find a way to lead in the community.\n\nSenate District 3 had no primary election.\n\nIf local journalism like this matters to you, please support The Lawrence Times.\n\nClick here to subscribe.\n\nKansas House races\n\nIn Kansas House District 46, Democrat Brooklynne Mosley beat out Logan Ginavan and Brittany Hall. In District 10, Suzanne Wikle overwhelmingly topped Zachary Hawkins.\n\nBoth seats will likely be decided in the primary as no candidates from other parties have filed for the seats.\n\nIn House District 42, incumbent Republican Lance Neelly faces Mike Stieben in the primary. The race was still tight as of late Tuesday. The winner will face Eddy Martinez in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nHouse Districts 5, 117 and 47 had no primary races. Incumbents in House Districts 43, 44 and 45 (Rep. Bill Sutton, Rep. Barbara Ballard and Rep. Mike Amyx, respectively) are running unopposed.\n\nRead more about the candidates in the articles linked in our 2024 primary voter guide.\n\nSee additional election results on the Douglas County elections office’s site at this link.
