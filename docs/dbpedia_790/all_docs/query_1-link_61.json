Rodney Parham Road\n\nLittle Rock, AR\n\n​\n\nSandra Blackard Levin died unexpectedly on Sunday, December 31, 2023. Sandy was born in Kansas City, Missouri on July 17, 1943. Raised primarily in Topeka, Kansas, she eventually moved to Little Rock in 1969 where she enjoyed working for Twin City Bank. She then met Dr. Frederick Levin, the love of her life, and they wed in 1971 as she stepped into her most cherished role as mother and wife.\n\nBesides devoting herself to raising her family and supporting her husband's passion for pediatrics, Sandy spent her years in Central Arkansas serving as a member of the Junior League of North Little Rock and in the sisterhood at Temple B'nai Israel in Little Rock. She was fiercely loyal to both family and friends that were family alike, and she also had a soft spot for the underdog. Her generosity knew no bounds for those she saw in need, and she always wanted to lend a helping hand.\n\nSandy was bold, charismatic, independent, feisty, and always authentic. Her favorite place was near the water, and she always looked forward to summers on their houseboat at Lake Ouachita or time at her beloved beach condo at Palm Island. She was an avid fan of Alabama football and Rod Stewart, she loved NCAA basketball, and was always ready to try her luck at a good slot machine or two.

James, Jr. of Jackson, Mississippi, passed away unexpectedly on February 18, 2023, in Dorchester, MA.\n\n​\n\nOscar was born July 15, 1981 as the second child and only son of Oscar Sr. and Adonna James. He leaves behind his two siblings, Melva and Aleia James; great uncle, Eddie Fox; aunts, Marsha Lynette Friels and Gloria Jean Jones; and cousins, Kimberly Texada, Lytle Evans, Elisabeth Evans, and De’Kendrea Stamps. He is also cherished and survived by his ‘2nd mother’, Ruby Butler, and her children, Patrick and Jennifer Butler.\n\n​\n\nOscar grew up in the Presidential Hills neighborhood of Jackson, Mississippi. He and his best friend, Jason Johnson, spent countless days playing in the loop where Presidential Drive cornered Franklin D Roosevelt to stay in Adonna’s sharp eyesight.\n\n​\n\nOscar first explored his love of music while learning the snare drum in the Northwest Jackson Middle School band. While attending Callaway Sr. High School, he sang baritone in the school choir and played the Bass drum in the “Charger Band.” Oscar was a member of Callaway High School’s Class of 1999.\n\n​\n\nOscar attended college at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM), earning his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. The friendships he gained while at USM proved to be life-long, where he is affectionately referred to as “Big O”.\n\n​\n\nAfter college, he moved to Biloxi, MS, where he began his career working in the public school system as a Behavioral Facilitator. Oscar had a genuine heart for children, exemplified through his work with special needs students and those with autism.\n\n​\n\nIn 2016 Oscar moved to Boston, MA, for a fresh start after experiencing the politics of the educational system and the pain of losing his parents, friends, and some of his students. Over time he healed from the depression and grief he faced and began to explore his path to happiness and fulfillment. While in Boston, he worked as a courier for the Salvation Army. His career began to truly flourish as he made a name for himself in the Boston Medical Cannabis Industry. At the time of his passing Oscar was employed at ZYP Run, where he had plans to grow with the company.\n\n​\n\nBeyond all else, and most importantly, Oscar was a beloved son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin, and friend. His smile, laughter, and sense of humor were infectious. There was nothing pretentious about him. His insights and ability to distill the complex to the comprehensible helped others feel safe, seen, and heard.\n\n​\n\nTo Oscar, his family and friendships were everything, and he was fiercely loyal. It is strange and unreal to know that Oscar’s journey here is now finished. As his family, we trust that God’s hand, which guided Oscar throughout his life, was with him through his transition. We pray that God will heal the sadness in our hearts and help us rejoice in our memories.\n\n​\n\nTwo memorials will be held to celebrate Oscar’s life: . Oscar will be cremated in honor of his wishes to be “sprankled” around the world.\n\n​\n\nDonations can be made to Venmo: DrMTJames, and cards can be mailed to 358 Watertown St., Apt 3L, Newton, MA 02458.

Knowing Shirley Jean is to have laughed with or shared a kind word, whether a close friend or stranger. Being humbly social was a gift she had, and those around her were drawn to her infectious, kind personality. Shirley Jean was a wonderful older sister to her siblings. \"As a daughter, she has spent a generous amount of love and care for her mother. She became a loving confidant and strong shoulder for her mother during times spent.\" Selflessness and generosity were two traits that highlighted her personality. She touched the lives of many people.\n\n​\n\nShirley Jean had an unassuming and disarming smile that could put anyone at ease, from newborns to the elderly. Her sense of humor was second to none, and she was as compassionate as she was funny. Even when ill, Shirley Jean was never angry or sad. Instead, she could find the silver lining to keep pushing forward in any situation. Shirley Jean was so special. She represented the good that we all need every day in our lives.

But she was also an educator, teacher, woman of God, caretaker, and friend. Her smile was infectious, her spirit was invigorating, but her love was everlasting. This is the story of a woman who blessed us with 94 years of love, laughter, and light.\n\n​\n\nMrs. Willis’ story begins on August 29, 1927. She was born an only child to the lateRev. Foster and Sis Erie McIntyre Brown of Hattiesburg, MS. She was introduced toChrist at a young age as a member of Antioch Baptist Church and was a graduate ofEureka High School in Hattiesburg, MS.\n\n​\n\nMrs. Willis had many passions, but teaching was her first love. Following high school, she went on to Tennessee State University where she obtained a degree inPolitical Science - she never missed an opportunity to brag on an HBCU. Her love for education did not stop there. Mrs. Willis then studied at Jackson State University and obtained an endorsement in Elementary Education.\n\n​\n\nThe trajectory of her story would soon change course, as she would eventually meet her husband, John. Their love blossomed in Stone County where Mrs. Willis was called to lead the dance team at Locker High. Her passion for educating led her to teach 37 years in the Stone County School District as a Social Studies instructor for4th, 5th, and 6th grade students.\n\nWhile she was stern about her students focusing on their studies, Mrs. Willis’ role as an educator extended far beyond the four walls of a classroom. She was an educator on life. A noble guide to prosperity. A light in a sea of unwavering darkness. She had a way of effortlessly inspiring, empowering, and encouraging those around her to do better and be better. She led, so we followed - the best we could.\n\n​\n\nHer grandchildren are arguably her proudest accomplishment. Whether she was schooling them on a lesson, saving them from a spanking, or cooking them a meal,Mrs. Willis was their voice of reason. They called her, Muh Muh. It was a title she wore with honor.\n\n​\n\nShe was a woman the community looked to for advice and wisdom. Although she was too humble to boast about her accomplishments, she was never too proud to give her neighbor. An angel sent from heaven, her pulse radiated from a servant heart.\n\n​\n\nMrs. Willis is preceded in death by her husband, John Willis Jr. and son, Vincent.She is survived by 3 sons: Carl (Doris) Lithonia, GA , Herman Wiggins, MS, and Larry (Maria) Daphne, AL; 2 daughters: Yette (Darryl) Hattiesburg,MS and Jondena (Stevon) Gulfport,MS; a plethora of grandchildren and great-grandchildren; and a great- great grandchild along with her God-sent sister LillieMae Grady.\n\nDue to COVID guidelines Face masks are required, and Social Distancing guidelines will be strictly enforced.\n\nDate of Birth July 15, 2016\n\nDate of Death February 17, 2022\n\nViewing\n\nMarch 2, 2022 | 5 PM to 7 PM\n\nDickey Brothers Memorial Funeral Home Chapel\n\n255 Delauney Street\n\nBiloxi, Mississippi 39530\n\nViewing\n\nMarch 3, 2022 | 9 AM to 11 AM\n\nNew Bethel Baptist Church\n\n255 Delauney Street\n\nBiloxi, Mississippi 39530\n\nPrivate Funeral | 11:00 a.m.\n\nInterment\n\nBiloxi National Cemetery\n\nBiloxi, Mississippi\n\nService live on Zoom: ID: 381-472-8635 | Password 496936\n\nFacebook Live: Dickey Brothers Memorial Funeral Home, LLC\n\n​\n\nUntil we meet again\n\nA bright ray of love that has filled all of our hearts with harmonious laughter and joy, has left to join our heavenly Family.

For in accordance to Ecclesiastes 12:7 it\n\nsays, and dust returns to the ground it came from and the Spirit returns to God who gave it.\n\nThough no one was prepared or imagined that this day would come, God who knows all made no mistake when He called our princess home. He allowed us to share the blessing in her life. He allowed us the privilege to raise her and see her change into a beautiful flower that exudes\n\nwarmth, joy, and love enough for everyone to feel.\n\n​\n\nSince we were blessed in abundance and given the honor of having such sweet precious time with our beautiful baby girl, we must be thankful to our creator and find a way to still keep the joy of her memory alive in our hearts.\n\n​\n\nNone of it is easy, and it may feel very hard to bear, as we all mourn her in our own way. However, if you truly remember Harmony; you would know that she would not want us to be sad, and instead, she would like us to be happy for that was who she was.\n\n​\n\nFamily and friends, as you can imagine, we did not see this day coming so soon, and we were not prepared for the time in which our precious baby would have to be put to rest. Nevertheless, never forget the memory of her love and the joy she brought to our hearts. For every hug, laughter, smile, and spoken word will now be a precious gem to treasure forever.\n\nIn unity, let us send a combination of simultaneously sounded chords with words of love that are pleasing to the the soul that reaches the heavens as we say our last goodbye\n\nUntil we meet again...\n\nLove you always infinity x infinity your God- sister\n\nYacksary\n\nDate of Birth August 16, 1940\n\nDate of Death November 14, 2021\n\n​\n\nMemorial Services will be held via ZOOM.

He was the second eldest son born to Roosevelt White Sr. and Lillian (Shelton) White in West Point, Mississippi on January 23, 1951. The following year, the family relocated to Kansas City, Missouri where he was raised. Willie had one sister and four brothers: Deloris White who passed away just shortly after birth; David Collins Hogan (1993); Roosevelt White Jr (2017); Mitchell White (1997); and Raymond White (Shirley), his last surviving sibling. Willie was survived by his life partner Venora Bryant with whom he conceived his eldest son Michael Jerome Bryant (Erica) of Gulfport, MS, and his ex-wife Pok Sun White Garrison whom he conceived Salynda Crystal Owens (Michael) of Houston, TX; Tamika La’Neese White of Midwest City, OK; Willie Louis White Jr. (Benita) of Kansas City, MO; Chae Joseph White Sr. (Chyna) of Memphis, TN; and Jay Cee White (Margo) of Kansas City, MO.

Davis Jr.; Koralee Shaver; Andre L. Ross; Za’Tavia S. White; Marita L. Davis, Maiya R. Henson, Jaylyn M. White, Mykiah J. Bryant, Mary J. Bryant, Willie L. White III, Jayden M. White, Ajia M.

Willie still has one surviving uncle Lamar Shelton, and one aunt Bessie White. He has several nieces, nephews, cousins and much extended family.\n\n​\n\nWillie graduated from Lincoln High School in Kansas City, MO and attended the University of Kansas (KU). He served in the United States Armed Forces until he discharged in 1973 as a veteran of the United States Air Force. The majority of his civilian career, he was involved in the telecommunication industry where he served as an electrician. His pride and joy has always been his family. Everyone and anyone who knew him, knows he is a connector of people. He made it his business to reach out to everyone in the family and was intentional about talking to his children daily. Willie needed at least three or four baptist preacher closes to end a phone conversation. If you know, then you know!\n\n​\n\nThroughout his life, music (especially old school) was in his veins and played the saxophone in a band for many years. He had a great sense of humor and loved to fellowship with people while playing dominos, chess and video games (Zumba was his favorite). He was a die-hard Kansas City Chiefs and Royals fan. Willie really enjoyed barbequing and knew how to clear a plate too. In his final days, he enjoyed working on various projects at his home. More than anything, Willie, affectionately known as “Chilly Willy,” “Willie Louis,” “Big Will,” and “Pops” was a joy to be around. He never met a stranger, nor was he a stranger to anyone.\n\n​\n\nIn his later years, he always found a way to remain objective and would provide sound advice to anyone who had an ear to hear. He was a major encourager, influencer, and solution provider. He worked hard and was full of wisdom. He instilled many strengths into his children, to include endurance, resilience, and perseverance (a spirit of never giving up, to always push forward). The biggest legacy he left for his family was to always remember to make your family a priority and to keep them close. He impacted us all different-ly but treated us all with great love and tender care. He always said he wanted to return home to Mississippi and he did just that and enjoyed the rest of his days exactly where he wanted to be. There will never be another Willie White Sr. in the world.

Canasta Robinson was born in Biloxi, Mississippi, to the late Albert Robinson Sr. and Dessie R. (Bland) Robinson. His parents may not have known it at the time, but the child that they were raising would establish a blueprint for a life well lived and deserving of earthly and heavenly accolades.\n\n​\n\nCanasta graduated from Biloxi High School in 1973. During his school years, he was an exemplary athlete who played basketball, football, and baseball. Although his ability to physically participate in sports waned over the years, his love for sports continued to blossom. He was an ardent fan of the Las Vegas Raiders and New Orleans Saints football teams.\n\n​\n\nFollowing commencement, Canasta served in the United States Navy from 1974-1976, during the Vietnam War Era. God’s favor was upon him during his time of service because he was not called to active combat. Canasta continued to take advantage of his experiences to further his education. In 1976, he started at the College of Alameda in Oakland, California, and graduated in 1980.\n\n​\n\nCanasta was gainfully employed throughout his life. After returning to Mississippi, he enjoyed working in the Harrison County School District. Later, his veteran status helped him obtain employment at the Naval Service Battalion Center in Gulfport, MS.\n\n​\n\nWhile working at AT&T, Canasta met Jackie, who became the love of his life. They were married in a beautiful, intimate ceremony on December 17, 2005. Together, they settled into a blissful life full of unwavering companionship and love for each other. Jackie often expressed her adoration to and for Canasta and sincerely appreciated him for giving her unadulterated happiness. He knew what it is like to be married to a fine, wonderful woman, so he treasured her beyond bearing with the sure knowledge that she loved him in the same manner. In his early years, Canasta accepted Christ and was a member of the Greater Grace Apostolic Church under the leadership of Bishop Ricky August. Together, Canasta and Jackie faithfully attended Tabernacle M.B. Church. They also enjoyed traveling together and often found themselves at beach destinations so that Canasta could relax and take pleasure in his blessed life.\n\n​\n\nAlthough Canasta was a hard worker, he was a pillar of support for his family, especially his mother and children. He took pride in being a great father, husband, son, brother, and friend. He was very honored by his children and often spoke of their accomplishments with pride in his voice. He was a man who virtuously wore patience and calmness as cloaks that enveloped all who had the pleasure of encountering him. Canasta was a gentle soul who epitomized compassion and tenacity. He was a modern-day superhero who saved his family from floodwaters during Hurricane Katrina while always looking for ways to help, inspire, and encourage others.\n\n​\n\nOn June 8, 2021, at the age of 65, Canasta departed this life as he lived this life: with peace and dignity. Canasta’s spirit was released from his worn-out shell of a body to his new home after a courageous battle with cancer. He was constantly surrounded by loved ones who will continue to honor his legacy by living their lives to the fullest. Canasta is reunited with his earthly father, Albert Robinson Sr., and was predeceased by his three brothers: BeArtis Robinson, Albert Robinson Jr., and Michael Anthony.\n\nAlthough Canasta’s life has concluded, the love from the ones left behind has not ended. He leaves to cherish his memories; a devoted wife, Jacqueline Denise Robinson; his dear mother Dessie R. Oselen of Biloxi, MS; two sons, Ricky Darden and Kelvin Darden, both of Gulfport, MS; two daughters Daria Keys-Taylor (Nick) of Mt. Healthy, OH and Deedra Keys of Charleston, WV: Two siblings Alberta Floyd of Biloxi, MS. and Yaqui Oselen of Atlanta, GA; one grandchild Keyontae J. Darden; one niece, and many extended family and friends too numerous to list but not forgotten.\n\n​\n\nAlthough Canasta has physically departed this realm, his memory and spirit will continue to survive and flourish. It is impossible for him to no longer exist because he resides in the souls of the people who knew him. His kind words and valuable lessons are forever implanted into our minds. His loving nature is entrenched in our hearts, his genuine smile is embedded in our memories, and his legacy will continually endure and grow throughout his generations. Knowing and loving each one of you was the success story of Canasta’s life, and you will meet again on the other shore.\n\n​\n\nClick here to download Obituary Program\n\nDate of Birth March 27, 1987\n\nDate of Death May 6, 2021\n\n​\n\nArrangements pending.\n\n​\n\nIn Loving Memory of Markita Keyon McIntyre.
