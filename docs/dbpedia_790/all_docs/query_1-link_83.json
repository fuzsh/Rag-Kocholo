        "text": "King Kong: An African Jazz Opera is commonly viewed as an anti-apartheid statement that voiced its discontent through African jazz and other urban black musics, and as a musical statement of 1950s liberalism that presaged that ideology's ousting in the era of Grand Apartheid. These analyses mostly rely on the musical's story, on the relationship between the white producers and the black cast, and on the musical's reception for their argument. This paper focuses on a neglected moment in King Kong's career, when it was absent from the country's segregated theatres. It hones in on the attempts made by the King Kong Company to travel beyond the Union's borders and the state's responses to these requests. I argue that viewing King Kong from the perspective of the apartheid state and using material other than its content or records of its reception, affords insight into the state's restriction of black (jazz) musicians' movement, its ambivalent position in the cultural politics of the Cold War, and jazz's position in both."
