Though far away from one another, Spain, England and Serbia witnessed almost identical political circumstances when the ruler passed the throne to a younger son, bypassing the first-born son, thereby also directly infringing the right of primogeniture. As a rule, such decision resulted in years-long conflicts among the brothers. However, the common denominator in all three cases is that family patrimony was entrusted to the eldest son regardless of the fact that he was not an heir to the throne, which implies that it was his inalienable right.\n\nWhen we think of genealogies in medieval Scotland our minds might turn at once to Gaelic, the Celtic language that was spoken in the Middle Ages from the southern tip of Ireland to the northernmost coast of Scotland. This is not unnatural. Texts that trace the ancestry of a notable individual generation by generation survive in their hundreds from the medieval Gaelic world. They are found today almost exclusively in late-medieval Irish manuscripts. Some genealogies originated in collections made as early as the tenth century. Presumably there were once many Scottish manuscripts containing genealogies, too. A reason why they would not have survived is that, in the Scottish kingdom during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Gaelic learned orders who would have had a primary interest in writing and copying this material declined in significance and ceased to participate in Gaelic literate culture.
