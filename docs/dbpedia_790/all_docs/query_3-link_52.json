        "text": "Miller sentenced in Three Rivers 2019 murder\n\nRandall Miller, 34, of Three Rivers was sentenced to 20 to 60 years for second-degree murder in the death of Lori Norman, 32.\n\nNorman was murdered March 25, 2019, at their 5th Street home in Three Rivers.\n\nSt. Joseph County Circuit Court Judge Paul Stutesman accepted a plea to second-degree murder Nov. 10 after conferring with defense attorneys John Bush and T.J. Reed.\n\nProsecutor John McDonough agreed to recommend a minimum 20 years and dismissed a second felony case with three counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. That case involved three victims under age 13. The allegations came after Miller was charged with open murder.\n\nDuring the plea, Miller admitted the couple had an argument that night.\n\n“I tried to stop it and she went limp,” he told Stutesman. Miller admitted he had “(pushed) her away by her throat.”\n\n“I tried to help,” Miller stated. Her children saw him pushing on her chest. Miller fled. He later denied to police he knew what happened.\n\nThe medical examiner from Western Michigan University medical school said the autopsy indicated it was possible she died from strangulation. The examination found bruises on her hands, shoulder and the side of her head, and cuts on her face, likely from the time of her death.\n\nMiller had been drinking that evening after putting a new roof on a building that day. Norman objected to his drinking and that provoked the fight. The children said the couple had a history of violent confrontations.\n\nMiller had flagged down a Three Rivers rescue unit, who took him back to the home. Paramedics could not revive Norman."
