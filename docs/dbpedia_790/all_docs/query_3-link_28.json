        "text": "MOULTRIE (WCTV Eyewitness News) – We’re closing in on the two month anniversary of the Colquitt County house fire where five young adults were found shot and killed. The person accused of pulling the trigger was their friend. Jeffrey Peacock was arrested just days later.\n\nWhile Peacock sits in jail, the community is still trying to pick up the pieces. A memorial is now in place to honor the victims.\n\nOnce upon a time, a house sat in the now-empty lot on Rossman Dairy Road. Now, a plaque placed on top of a cross stands alone.\n\nFamily and friends are driving by to see this memorial and the folks who put it up say that’s just what they want– healing for the family and the entire community.\n\nThe five names engraved on the plaque create a permanent memorial– Jonathan Edwards, Alicia Norman, Reid Williams, Jones Pidcock and Jordan Croft.\n\nFive individuals who resident Wes Smith never met or heard of, until it was time to remove what was left of the burned home at 505 Rossman Dairy Road.\n\n“It was different knowing what happened here. It was definitely different, what took place, something that you do remember,” Smith says.\n\nSmith wants to make sure the community doesn’t forget either. His company was in charge of removing the charred remains of the house, leaving behind the large empty lot where the memorial now stands.\n\n“It’s not every day that you get over a loved one, it’s an everyday struggle and I understand that,” Smith says.\n\nNeighbors say the murders have truly impacted this area.\n\n“Tragedy. It was a tragedy for the whole community,” says Alicia Norman’s friend, Terry Sauls.\n\nSauls says just a week before the murders, he saw Norman at work. He says he never thought that would be the last time he ever saw her.\n\n“It makes it hard. It’s a tough situation to comprehend and understand how this could even happen in the first place,” Sauls says.\n\nAlthough the memorial won’t bring back those five victims, the community says it’s a special way to honor and remember them.\n\nThe man accused in the murders, Jeffrey Peacock, remains in the Colquitt County Jail without bond."
