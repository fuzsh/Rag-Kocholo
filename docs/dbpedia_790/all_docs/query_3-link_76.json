ISSA OFFERS HELP\n\nBy Miriam Raftery\n\nAugust 6, 2024 (San Diego) – The U.S. State Department has issued a level 4 advisory urging Americans not to travel to Lebanon, and for Americans in Southern Lebanon, near the Syrian borders, or in refugee settlements to immediately depart. Those who do not leave should be prepared to shelter in place for a prolonged period, due to escalating military actions between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nFollowing Hezbollah strikes in Israel, Israel launched an airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate. Hours later, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed by a bomb in Tehran, Iran. Iran has blamed Israel and has threatened to attack Israel in response, though Israel has not confirmed nor denied responsibility for the Iranian death.\n\nAny attacks on Israel are expected may trigger a wider military response by Israel. Today, Israeli fighter jets reportedly flew low over Beirut, producing sonic booms that scattered frightened residents, according to Reuters.\n\nFor travelers and foreign nationals in Beirut, fleeing is becoming more difficult. Insurance companies have raised premiums due to unrest in the region, prompting Air France, Lufthansa and other European airlines to halt flights into Beirut, NPR reported yesterday. Middle East Airlines is still flying, but there are not enough planes to accommodate all who seek to leave.\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!

Harper\n\nSeveral weeks ago, the California State Assembly voted for a new bill that aims at making the streets a little bit safer for everyone. Assembly Bill 1990 would give police officers greater power in making arrests to prevent shoplifting of property that exceeds $950.\n\nThis bill would authorize a peace officer to make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor shoplifting offense not committed in the officers presence, if the officer has probable cause to believe the crime occurred, per Digital Democracy CA Matters.\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!

Setting aside for a moment the majority both campaigns raise through Political Action Committees (PACs), what remains is a clear picture of who are each candidate’s core donors.\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!

The bacteria are spread when someone sick with TB coughs, speaks, sings or breathes. People with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB should get tested.\n\nEffective treatments are available to cure people who are sick from active TB. It is especially important for people with symptoms of active TB and those who are immunocompromised to see a medical provider to rule out active TB disease and to discuss treatment.\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!

Image from Cal Fire video\n\nOf all the insidious threats faced by wildland firefighters — extreme heat, desiccated forests, unpredictable fire behavior and a nearly year-round fire season — what might be the most fearsome?\n\nHumans.\n\nPeople do dangerous things, things that start wildfires. Pushing a burning car into a gully. Mowing the lawn on a hot summer day. Miswiring a hot tub. Driving cars with flat tires. Burning toilet paper rather than packing it out of a campsite. Setting off smoke bombs at gender reveal parties.\n\nIn hot, dry conditions already primed for fire, people’s actions can quickly escalate from a harmless mistake — such as hammering a metal stake into the parched ground — to igniting a blaze that kills a firefighter.\n\nPeople — whether purposeful, reckless or simply careless — are responsible for about 95% of California’s wildfires. Last year alone, people caused more than 7,000 wildfires in California; nationally, it was more than 50,000.\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!

These districts would fund wildfire mitigation apparatus and infrastructure including new heavy equipment to clear vegetation, create firebreaks, and harden utility infrastructure against wildfires.\n\n“As climate change progresses, our state is affected by longer, more intense, and increasingly hazardous wildfires. In San Diego alone, almost one-fourth of all wildfires start from the combustion of roadside vegetation by vehicles. It is crucial to have the proper firefighting equipment to prevent wildfires,” a statement by Waldron in the Senate Floor analysis.“Obtaining funding to increase prevention response and fire-fighting equipment. backcountry areas has been difficult. The creation of an infrastructure financing district for this purpose will raise the necessary funding without the need to raise taxes.”\n\nThe bill has passed the Assembly unanimously (with several members absent) and is currently awaiting action in the Senate Appropriations Committee. All legislative business must be concluded by August 31, the last day of the legislative session.\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!

Conspirators contacted victims through pop-up ads, emails and phone calls to con victims into contacting scam call centers in India, the indictment indicates. Conspirators worked to build trust with victims, and in many cases, had victims install remote desktop software that they used to gain access to victims’ computers, accordingto prosecutors.\n\nThe scammers allegedly adopted a number of guises – posing as technical support, government and bank workers – to induce victims to send money to other conspirators, including the five defendants charged in the indictment.\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!

The District Attorney earlier declined to file charges against Rodriguez-Kennedy.\n\nRodriguez-Kennedy and Rendon today issued this joint statement: “Recently we have had the opportunity to meet and discuss a misunderstanding that caused us both a lot of pain. It is unfortunate that certain political actors took advantage of this misunderstanding in an effort to damage William's reputation and career. “With this behind us, we are wishing each other the very best as we move on with our lives. William and I would like everyone to respect our peace and privacy moving forward.”\n\nMarlea Dell’Anno, attorney for Rodriguez-Kennedy, pointed to an increasing rise of violence and harassment in local and national political discourse as a contributing factor in the severe harm suffered by her client. “Our position was clear from day one: Will Rodriguez-Kennedy was always innocent. Will and Oscar have reconciled, and we have identified the true villains in this tragic story of political violence.”\n\nError message\n\nSupport community news in the public interest!
