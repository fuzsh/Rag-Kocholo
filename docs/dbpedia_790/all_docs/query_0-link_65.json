Venezuel:l is a rich and comparatively\n\npowerful country with a land arca four times that of Guyana :md a\n\npopulation twenty times that of Guyana. Her claim is being\n\nadvancecl through an intensive campaign of mounting hostility to\n\nGuyana. The claim moreover is one which completely disregards\n\nthe fact that thc existing boundary was dcfined by the unanimous\n\njudgment of an international arbitral tribunal ¡iven in París in\n\n1899, that it was thereafter laid down on the ground by a\n\nVene1uelan/British Mixed Boundary Commission, and that, as so\n\nlaid down, it was fully rcspected and observed by both sidcs and\n\n~Y the international community for upwards of sixty years.\n\n/ ...\n\nAnnex 54\n\n19\n\nBrief Historical Background\n\n. Th~ origins of the problem lie in the European scramble for\n\nemp1re m the \"New World\" which took place during the 16th\n\n1 7th and 18th centuries, t~e _majar colonising powers being Spain:\n\nPortugal, Holland and Bntam. lt was against a background of\n\nunsettled and competing claims amongst these powers that the\n\nliberation struggles within Latin America were carried on in the\n\nearly y_ears of the 19th century. The consequence was that many\n\ncountnes emerged out of that process into independence without\n\ndefineq boundaries. These were left to be determini:d by the new\n\nstates 'themselves through negotiation, arbitration, and, regrettably\n\nin sorne cases, armed conflict. One of these states was the Republic\n\nof Venezuela, which proclaimed its independence from Spain in\n\n1811.\n\nThe Republic of Guyana consisted originally of the three\n\nseparate Dutch colonies of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice.\n\nThese were conquered by Britain in 1803 and were ceded to it by\n\nthe Dutch in 1814. In 1831 the three colonies were united to form\n\nthe Colony ofBritish Guiana. British Guiana achieved independence\n\nin 1966 under the name of Guyana.\n\nThe Venezuel:i/British Guiana Boundary Dispute\n\nArising out of the historical circumstances alluded to above,\n\nfor the greater part of the 19th century the boundary between\n\nBritish Guiana and Venezuela was the subject of dispute between\n\nVenezuela and Great Britain, the territory claimed by Venezu~la\n\nbeing the entirety of what wa_s the original D~tc_:h colony of\n\nEssequibo, while the territory cla1med by Great Britam rc:a~hed far\n\ninto what are now the eastem and north eastc:m reg1ons of\n\nVenezuela.\n\nVenezuela sought the support of the United State~ w_hich\n\ngave the support sought in supposed vi~dication of the prmc1p~es\n\nof the Monroe Doctrine. Under what h1story records as a defin_1te\n\nthreat of war by the Unitcd Stati-•. Great Britai~ ag_reed w1th\n\nVenezuela to submit the dispute to international arb1trat1on.\n\nThe Treaty of W:ishington. 1897\n\nWith that object in view on February 2. ! 897. Brit:iin and\n\nVenezuela signed a treaty in Washington under wh1ch they agreed\n\n/, ...\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 4\n\nto estab!ish an international arbitral tribunal for the purpose of\n\ndeterrnining the \"boundary linc between the Colony of lJritish\n\nGuiana and t/ze United Slates of V cne:uela \". After spelling out\n\nthe terms and conditions under which the Arbitral Tribunal was to\n\nfunction, the treaty concluded with a solemn undertaking by the\n\ntwo Contracting Parties \"to t·onsider tlie result of the proc:eedings\n\nof t/1e Tribunal of Arbitration as a full. perfect and final sctt lement\n\nof ali the questions rcferred lo the Arbitralon \".\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal consisted of five members. Two of these\n\nwere appointed on behalf of Britain. They were the lord Chief\n\nJustice of England :ind an English Justice of Appeal. Two membcrs\n\nwere appointed on beh:ilf of Venezuela. They were the Chief\n\nJustice and another member of the Supreme Court of the United\n\nSt:ites. The fifth member was :i distinguished Russian jurist\n\nunanimously chosen by the other four members.\n\nThe Case before the Arbitral Tribunnl\n\nIn the course of the procedures leading up to the arbitration,\n\nsevera! volumes of historical evidence and arguments were\n\nexchanged between the two sides. The hearing before the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, which was held in París in 1899, occupied no less than\n\n54 sessions of oral argument.\n\nIn the case as presented by her, Venezuela elected to..found\n\nher claim on rights based on Spanish discovery of the \"New World\".\n\nSuch evidence of occupation as she advanced was secondary,\n\ntenuous and pcrfunctory. By contrast, the British rested their case\n\non concrete acts of extensi\"e occupation, possession and develop­\n\nment carried on both by themselves and by their Dut<.:h pre­\n\ndecessors.\n\nThe Arbitral Award. 1899\n\nOn Octaber 3, 1899, the Arbitral Tribunal gave its decision.\n\nThe decision was unanimous. It laid uown a line corresponding to\n\nthe existing boundary .\n\n. . The Award of the Tribunal coincided substantially with the\n\nBr~t~sh c~se, but not entircly, because ccrtain areJs claimcd by the\n\nBnt1sh, mcluding the str.itcgic mouths and lower rcaches of the\n\n~makura and Barima rivers and the upper reaches of the Cuyuni\n\nnver, were awarded to Venezuela.\n\n/ ...\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnslish\n\nPage 5\n\nAccept:mce of the Award\n\nTh_~ Award was the subjcct of appreciatory comments from\n\nrespons1ble quarters both in the United States and in Venezuela·\n\nDunng _ the years 1901-190S the boundary as defined by the Award\n\nwas la1d down on . the ground by a Venezuela/British Mixed\n\nBoundary Commiss~on. On . January I O, 190S, the Boundary\n\nComm1ss1oners unammously s1gned a Joint Rcport of the boundary\n\nas dcmarcatcd by them and as set out in a map of the entire\n\nboundary whkh was also signed by them. Their report, with the\n\nbo~ndary map, was in due course presented to and accepted by\n\nbóth governments.\n\nFor over six de~aucs successive gencr.tt1ons of liritish,\n\nGuyanese and Venezuelans and, indeed, the rest ofthe international\n\ncommunity accepted as )Cttled and final the boundary as laid\n\ndown by the Arbitral Tribunal and as demarcated by the\n\nVenczuela/Briti~h Mixed Boundary Commission. The boundary as\n\nso laid down was later reproduced in official Venezuelan maps,\n\nincluding maps published in Caracas in 1911 and 1917. On July\n\n:?4, 193:?, the liulletin of the Ministry of Foreign Aff airs of\n\nVenezuela published the text of an Act of Inauguration by thc:\n\nVenezuelan Legislature of certain border marks which had been\n\nagreed by Guyana, Venezuela and Brazil as determining the\n\ntri-junction point of the boundarics of the three countries where\n\nthey meet at Mount Roraima. Indeed, as late as December 13,\n\n196S, the Legislative Assembly of the Venczuelan Statc of Bolívar,\n\nwhich is adjacent to Guyana, enacted a law which formally\n\nincorporated and promulgated the definition of thc boundary as\n\nlaid down by the 1899 Arbitral Awaru. lt is to be remarked that\n\nthat law was passed sorne three years after Venezuela first\n\nrepudiated the Arbitral Award C'IÍ 1899 upon pretensions to be\n\nnow noticed.\n\nA Posthumous Allegation\n\nIn keeping with her solicitation of American sponsorsh1p. of\n\nher cause, Venezuela had electcd in 1899 to have her case presented\n\nto thc Arbitral Tribunal by four American lawyers, namely!\n\nex-Uñited States President General Benjamín Hamson, ex-Umted\n\nStates Secretary of War General Benjamín Tracy, Mr. Severo\n\nMallet-Prevost and Mr. James Russcll Soley. Mr. Mallet-Prevost was\n\n. .\n\n1\n\n·n the team In January 1944 he was decorated by\n\na Junior awyer 1\n\n·\n\nf h Lb tor On\n\nthe Venezuelan Government with the Order o t e t era .\n\nI •. .\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 6\n\nthe 8th day of the following month and after ali the other act?rs\n\nin the drama had passed away, he dictated a mer:norandum whic?\n\nhe directed should be published only after h1s death. In this\n\ndocument, which was published posthumously in 1949, Mr.\n\nMallet-Prevost asserted that the 1899 Arbitral Award was null and\n\nvoid on the alleged ground that it was the result of a political deal\n\nbetween Great Britain and Czarist Russia.\n\nThe Allegation is without Merit\n\nSerious research has long since questioned the accuracy of\n\nthe faded recollections on which Mr. Mallet-Prevost's posthumous\n\nallegations were sought to be based. Eve:1 writer:i. known to be\n\notherwise sympathetic to Venezuela have agreed that his allcgation\n\nthat the Award was the result of a political deal between Britain\n\nand Czarist Russia is without foundation. Yet it is chieíly on the.\n\nstrength. of this wholly unsubstantiatcd calumny of the dis­\n\ntinguished members of the Arbitral Tribunal of 1899 that\n\nV1:nezue)a is now seeking to impugn the validity of the Award.\n\nRecognising the utter weakness of the Mallet-Prevost allegation\n\nof a political deal, Venezuela has sought to rest her case on\n\naltl\"mative grounds including, for example, matters relating to the\n\nnegotiation of the Treaty of Washington 1897 and the fact that no\n\nreasons were given by the Arbitral Tribunal for its decision. But\n\nthe material on which challcnge is sought to be brought Otl; these\n\nalleged grounds was always within the full knowledge of Venezuela\n\nwhich nevertheless positively affirmed the validity of the boundary\n\nfor six decades. For this and other reasons, which cannot be\n\nconveniently dealt with here, these other alleged grounds of\n\nchallenge are considered to be without merit.\n\nVenezuela Objects To Guyana's lndependenc.e\n\nMeanwhile, in Guyana the struggle against colonialism was\n\ngaining mome_¡¡tum. By 1962 it was clear that the demand of the\n\nGuyanese people for indepcndence could not much longer be put\n\noff. In 1962, during a sensitive and vulnerable phase in Guyana's\n\nmovement for independence, Venezuela raised the question of the\n\nboundary in the United Nations, when she formally repudiated the\n\nvalidity of the 1899 Arbitral Award and objected to independence\n\nbeing granted to Guyana until and unless the question so raised\n\nhad bcen settled. Concomitantly, Venezuela launched an inter­\n\nnational campaign against Guyana the cffect of which, had it been\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 7\n\nsuccessful, would have been to delay the granting of independence\n\nto Guyana and to prolong her colonial status.\n\nExamination of Documents\n\nNotwithstanding the certain failure of Venezuela's attempts\n\nto delay Guyana's independence, as the time for granting indepen­\n\ndence approached the Government of the United Kingdom, in\n\nconsultation with the Government of the then Colony of British\n\nGuiana, agreed as a gesture of goodwill to afford to the Venezuelan\n\nGovernment an opportunity of having its contention of nulay\n\ne\"amined. Accordingly, on November 12, 1962, Mr. Colin Crowe,\n\nthe United Kingdom representative at the United Nations, made\n\nan offer to Venezuela in the United Nations Special Committee to\n\nthe effect that the relevant documentary material on the 1899\n\nAward be examined by experts from the United Kingdom, British\n\nGuiana and Venezuela. In doing so he was, however, careful to\n\nstate -\n\nIn making this offer, I must make it very clear that it is in\n\nno sense an off er to engage in substan~ive talks about\n\nrevision of the frontier. That we cannot do; for we consider\n\nthat there is no justification for it.\n\nVenezuela having accepted this offer, the documents_ were then\n\nduly examined by experts from each of the three countnes bet~een\n\n1963 and 1965. In the opinion of the governments of the,Umted\n\nKingdom and British Guiana the work of the experts d1sclose1\n\nd\n\nthat there was not a scintilla of evidence to support Venezuela s\n\ncontention of nullity.\n\nThe Geneva Agreement - February 17, 1966\n\nHowever, in view of continued Venezuela~ agit~tion, ~hich\n\nbecame particularly marked during the penod immediately\n\npreceding Guyana's independence, just fo~r m~~th~ befo~~\n\nindependence the Government of the Uruted ing om, lie\n\nconsultation with the Government of Guyana, agreed :,V\n\n1\n\n~h t f\n\nGovernment of Venezuela to establish a Mixed Com~ssion °k\n\nGuyanese and Venezuelan r_epresentatives ch_ar~e!17':!e~:~g~e\n\nof seeking satisfactory solutions for :t~~raJ~~d\n\nKingdom which\n\ncontro~ersy between Vlenefzuteh~ ~enezuelan contention that the\n\nhas ansen as the resu t\n\n0\n\nI •..\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 8\n\nArbitral Award of, 1899 about the frontier between British Guiana\n\nand Venezuela is null and void\" The arrangement to this effect\n\nwas set out in the Geneva Agreement which was signed by the\n\nUnited Kingdom, Guyana and Venezuela at Geneva on February\n\n17, 1966. The life of the Mixed Commission so established was\n\nstipulated to be four years. During that period the Geneva Agree­\n\nment explicitly prohibited either party from pursuing the issue in\n\nany fonn or manner except within the Mixed Commission.\n\nVenezuel.J's Refusal to Prove her C:ise\n\nThe Mixed Commission held several meetings during the four\n\nyears of its existence. At the very first meeting, Guyana invited\n\nVenezuela to produce evidence and arguments in support of her\n\nbasic contention that the 1899 Arbitral Award was null and void.\n\nSurprisingly, Venezuela's reaction was that the issue of nullity,\n\nwhich she had raised, was not an issue with which the Mixed\n\nCommission should concern itself, and that the only issue before\n\nthe Commission was how much land Guyana was prepared .to\n\nmake over to Venezuela. Guyana not unnaturally declined to\n\nproceed in that way. Venezuela then sought to circumvent\n\nargument about her contention of nullity by putting forward\n\nproposals for the \"joint development\" '>f the area claimed by her\n\nunder arrangements which would effectively have transferred to\n\nher substantial elements of sovereignty over the area. These 'loint\n\ndevelopment\" proposals were consequently unacceptable to\n\nGuyana.\n\nVenezuela's Breaches oJ the Geneva Agreement\n\nThe work of the Mixed Commission was regrettably hampered\n\nby pressure and hostility exerted by Venezuela throughout the life\n\nof the Commission. The fact that these acts represented distinct\n\nbreaches of the Geneva Agreement and accepted nonns of inter­\n\nnational behavi0l1r seemed in no way to trouble Venezuela.\n\nGuyana's protests, both within the Mixed Commission and directly\n\nto the Government of Venezuela, were contumaciously ignored.\n\nSome of these breaches were as follows:-\n\n(i) Venc:ucla'J Violation of Guyana's Territorial Integrity\n\nAnlcnlco l.dand\n\nJn accordance with the general map of the boundar;, u\n\nI ...\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C .l/'36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPag~ 9\n\n~~ted\n\nand authen~~ted in 190S by the Venezuela/British\n\nAnk k ~un!ary Corrumwon, the eastern portion of the island or\n\nli\n\no o lJl e Cuyuni River belongs to Guyana As mentioned\n\near er that fact was A1·st· tJ\n\n·\n\n·\n\n•\n\n• - - - •\n\n- me Y recogrused as recently as December\n\n1\n\n.• 3, 1965, m ~ decree concerning the boundary which was published\n\nm the Official ~•zc!te of the Venezuelan State of Bolivar which\n\nabuts Guyana m tlie area of Anlcoko Island.

This is but one\n\nexample of pressure consistently applied by Venezuela with a view\n\nto strangling Guyana's economic development.\n\n(iv) Vene:uela 's Intervention in Guyana's Internal A/fain\n\nBetween 1966 and 1968 agents of the Government of\n\nVenezuela organised clandestine meetings with citizens of Guyana,\n\naimed at the promotion of her claim through subversion. These\n\nefforts were unsuccessful. Indeed, in the early years of her\n\nindependence the Government of Guyana was obliged to expel a\n\nVenezuelan diplomat for the part he played in these acts of\n\ninterference in the internal affairs of Guyana.\n\nBetween December 24, 1968, and January 2, 1969, the\n\nVenezuelan Government however instigated and conspired with a\n\nnumber of ranchers in the Rupununi District of Guyana, which is\n\nin the area claimed by Venezuela, to seize certain administrative\n\nposts in the area. The aim was to establish a separate state in\n\nsecession from the rest of Guyana. Venezuela had an active role in\n\ntraining, arming and supplying these ranchers. The attempted act\n\nof secession failed and with it Venezuela's efforts at promoting her\n\nclaim by such means.\n\nGuyana has naturally reserved her position on all of these\n\nbreaches by Venezuela of the Geneva Agreement and of inter­\n\nnational law.\n\nThe Protocol of Port-of-Spain, June 18, 1970\n\nApinst this background it is not surprising that the Guyana/\n\nVenezuela Mixed Commission ended its four-year term of office\n\nwithout reaching agreement for the settlement of the controversy.\n\nIn keeping with article IV of the Geneva Agreement the govern•\n\nments of Guyana and Venezuela were thereupon required to\n\nchoose one of the-means of peaceful settlement specified in article\n\n33 of the United Nations Charter, namely, negotiation, enquiry\n\nmediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement resort t~\n\nregional agencies or arrangements, or other means of peaceful\n\nsettlement chosen by the parties.\n\nThe r~quirement to resort to these settlement procedures was\n\nsuspended m 1970 by a new Agreement which in effect froze the\n\nI •••\n\nAnnex 54\n\nproblem fo_r a twelve-year period. This period expires on June 17\n\n1982, but 1s automatically renewable unless either party g\n\n· '\n\nth '\n\nt'\n\nf\n\n·\n\n,\n\nmon s no ice o temunat1on. The Agreement whi\"ch\n\np t f. s · T • \"d\n\nIVC!I SIX\n\n· d\n\nt\n\n,\n\nwas s1gne\n\na or -o • pam, nm ad, operates as a Protocol to the Geneva\n\nAgreement 1966. So long as the Protocol is in force it imposes\n\nupon Guyana and _Venezuela the duty to explore all possibilities of\n\nbetter un~ers!andmg between them and their peoples and for the\n\ncons~ruct1ve improvement of their relations. Correspondingly it\n\ncon_tmued the. pr~hibition imposed by the Geneva Agreem~nt\n\nagainst any activation of the controversy raised by the Venezuelan\n\ncontention that the Arbitral Award was null and void.\n\nThe Operation of the Protocol or Port-of-Spain\n\nAt the beginning, the Protocol of Port-of-Spain served to\n\ninduce a period or calm and a ml!asurc of responsible behaviour\n\nfrom Venezuela following the hostilities and various forms of\n\naggression and intimidatfon against Guyana which were reatures of\n\nprevious years. Thus, on Guyana's initiative, Dr. Haydee Castillo\n\nde Lopez Acosta, Minister of Development, became in 1971 the\n\nfirst Venezuelan Minister ever to make an official visit to Guyana.\n\nLater that year Cde. ~A. Reid, then Deputy Prime Minister and\n\nMinister of Agriculture, returned the visit. In the years which\n\nfollowed discussions took place at several levels. These discussions,\n\nfrom a Guyana point of view, were aimed at improving co­\n\nope:.ition between the two countries in many areas. The spirit\n\ngenerated by the Protocol of Port-of-Spain provided the climate\n\nfor exploratory conversations of substance which rook place in\n\n1978 between the then President of Venezuela, Sr. Carlos Andres\n\nPerez, and Guyana's then Prime Minister, Cde. Forbes Burnham.\n\nThese conversations examined in considerable depth the state of\n\nrelations betNeen Guyana and Venezuela and were regarded as\n\nhelpful in advancing the objectives of the Protocol and in opening\n\nthe way for a more ordered search for a settlement o~ the contro­\n\nversy which stemmed from the Venezuelan contention that -the\n\nAward of 1899 was a nullity.\n\nUnfortunately, the later years of the Protocol saw a . re•\n\ncrudescence of Venezuelan hostility towards Guyana. Notwith·\n\nstanding that however. with the advent of a new Vrnezuelan\n\nadministr4tio~ early in 1979, the Government of Guyana _renew_e~\n\nits efforts towards meaningful discussion and co-operation wit\n\nVenezuela.\n\n/ ...\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/ 9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 12\n\nVisit of the President of Guyana to Venezuela - April l-3. 1981\n\nIndeed, it was in furtherance of these objectives that the\n\nPresident of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana paid a visit to\n\nVenezuela on April 2-3, 1~81, in response to an invitation by his\n\ncounterpart. The visit, which at the official level was cordial,\n\nunfortunately took place amidst an orchestrated Venezuelan\n\ncampaign of hostility towards Guyana, including strident c:ills for\n\nmilitary occupation of the region claimed and the institution of a\n\nnaval blockade of Guy:ina.\n\nStatement by the President of Venezuela - 4th April, 1981\n\nLess than twenty-four hours after the President of Guyana\n\nreturned home, the President of Venezuela saw tit to issue from\n\nMiraflores Palace the following statement:\n\nAs a result of the recent visit to Venezuela of the President of\n\nthe Co-operative Republic of Guyana, Mr. Linden Forbes\n\nBurnham, and the meetings he held with President Luis\n\nHerrera Campins, the Venezuelan Government announced\n\nthat:\n\n1. Both Chiefs of State held cordial and frank talks on\n\nrelevant issues and on matters of current international\n\ninterest.\n\n2. President Herrera Campins firmly ratifies Venezuela's\n\nclaims to the Essequibo territory. An illegal arbitration\n\naward of I 899, which was never valid, despoiled\n\nVenezuela of that territory.\n\n3. President Herrera Campins thus reiterates Venezuela's\n\nrejection of any compromise incompatible with\n\nVenezuela's claim and stresses the nation's desire that\n\nt_he grave injustice committed against it by the voracity\n\nof the colonial empires should be righted.\n\nFor the same reason President Herrera reiterates\n\nVenezuela's rejection of the Hydroelectric Project of the\n\nUpper Mazaruni.\n\n4. President Herrera also reiterates that Venezuela and\n\nGuyana are committed to seek practical and satisfactory\n\nI .•.\n\nAnnex 54\n\nsolutions to the pending controversy and ratifies\n\nVenezuela's ~etennination to continue e~ploring every\n\nmeans to achieve that end.\n\nTherefore, fo: the record, he states that at this moment\n\nVenezuela is not willing to extend the Port-of-Spai~\n\nProtocol.\n\nThus, even while the moratorium so thoughtfully provided\n\nby th~ Protocol of Port-of-Spain was still in force, Venezuela at\n\nthe highest level represented by her President chose to go on\n\nrecord as breaching the moratorium by actively reviving the issue\n\nand seeking to thwart the economic development of Guyana. This\n\nlatter aspect of Venezuela's current attitude is particularly sur­\n\nprising, regard being had to Venezuela's professions of concern for\n\nthe economically disadvantaged and her championship of the\n\ncause of economic co-operation among developing countries.\n\nIf the belligerency of Venezuela's current campaign or\n\nhostility towards Guyana is any guide, it is a fair ir unsettling con­\n\nclusion that the statement by the Venezuelan President or\n\nVenezuela's intention to terminate the Protocol of Port-of-Spain\n\nportends for Guyana an ominous return to the unhappy e;;irlier\n\nperiod during which both Guyana and the Caribbean region faced\n\nconstant threat to their peace and security as a result of the\n\nVenezuelan claim and the methods whereby ii was asserted and\n\nadvanced.\n\nVenezuela - the New Conquistador\n\nThe Venezuelan claim, being based an supposed rights or\n\nSpanish discovery, rests essentially on the long since discarded\n\nnotion that it was the manifest destiny of European peoples lo h_old\n\ndominion over non-while peoples and their lands. Technological\n\n~periority was thought sufficient to override the claims of ~I hers.\n\nExamples abound. Today, however, the ~rinciple ol . self­\n\ndetennination is a mandatory and fully crystallised norm of international\n\nlaw\n\nanc.i\n\nrelations.\n\nThe persistence of the Venezuelan claim t_o live-ei~nths or\n\nGuyana's territory notwithstanding that the entire popula11on in\n\nimed is Guyanese in every respect is a strange-a1av,s11c\n\nCla\n\nth\n\ne area\n\nE\n\n,,,. ·onty wlm:h\n\nthrowback to the presumption of uropean su, .• n . .\n\n.\n\ninspired the Spanish conquiiitadors of an earlier tune. It is saJ that\n\nI •••\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 14\n\nVenezuela should be so insensitive to the incongruity of the role\n\nwhich she would assume of a 20th century prosecutor of an\n\nobsolete 16th century European colonialism over non-white\n\npeoples. For even if by any stretch of imagination the land claimed\n\nwere technically Venezuelan territory, it is clear that that circum­\n\nstance could not justify her in recolonising the very substantial\n\npopulation of the territory whi,h since 1966 has exercised its right\n\nof self-determination by freely joining in the formation, of the\n\nindependent sovereign State of Guyana.\n\nGuyana Stands Finn\n\nln the light of the statement issued by the President of\n\nVenezuela on April 4, 1981, President Burnham considered it\n\ndesirable to clarify Guyana's stand. This he did in a statement\n\nmade by him to the Press in Guyana on April 8, 1981, when,\n\nrestating his views as publicly declared during his recent visit to\n\nVenezuela, he defined the position of the Government of Guyana\n\nto be as follows:\n\n(a) The 1899 Arbitral Award was entirely valid.\n\n(b) Even if the Award was invalid, the boundary laid\n\ndown pursuant to the Award has acquired full validity\n\nas a result of Venezuelan recognition,acauiescence\n\nand other conduct relating thereto.\n\n(c) Even if both the Award and the boundary laid down\n\npursuant thereto are invalid, the land claimed by\n\nVenezuela does not automatically go to her.\n\n(d) In such a situation, whatever settlement procedure is\n\nadopted, account will have to be taken of all the\n\nclaims of both sides, including in particular -\n\n(i) claims by Guyana to the Amakura, Baruna and\n\nCuyuni areas, which we lost to Venezuela as a\n\nresult of the Award; and\n\n(ii) claims by Guyana based upon her possession and\n\n~ccupation right up to comparatively recent\n\ntimes when Venezuela first formally rejected the\n\nvalidity of the 1899 Award.\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 15\n\n(e) Meanwhile, the Essequibo Region is an integral part\n\nof Guyana and has been so for the entirt h.istory of\n\nthe country.\n\n(t) There is nothing whatsoever in the Geneva Agreement\n\nor the Protocol of Port-of-Spain which precludes\n\nGuy~na from developing any part of her territory, in­\n\ncluding the area claimed by Venezuela. Nor will\n\nGuyana ever consent to any arrangement having any\n\nsuch effect. On the contrary, Guyana has a moral\n\nduty to make optimum use of her resources for the\n\nbenefit of her population and for the promotion or\n\nthe integrated development of the Region and the\n\nHemisphere of which she is a part.\n\n(g) This applies very specifically to the Upper Maz:mrni\n\nHydro-Electric Project. Besides being crucial to the\n\ndevelopment of the nation, the project offers\n\nopportunities for regional co-operation of a kind\n\nvisualised under OLADE, which Venezuela vigorously\n\nespouses, and the Treaty of Amazonian Co-operation\n\nto which both Guyana and Venezuela stand\n\ncommitted. Guyana therefore intends to intensify her\n\nefforts to bring this project to fruition.\n\nPresident Burnham ended by saying -\n\nIt is entirely a matter for Venezuela to decide whether\n\nshe will terminate the Protocol of Port-of-Spain. But\n\nthis Government does have some say over the course to\n\nbe pursued when the Protocol comes to an end. w_e\n\nwould hope that the exploration of the problem will\n\ncontinue to develop, as it has been developing under the\n\nProtocol, in a climate of friendship, understanding an~\n\nco-operation. To those honoura~le ends ~ pledge this\n\nGovernment. I would sincerely hke to think that the\n\nsame applied to the Government of Venezuela.\n\nContinuing Venezuelan Hostility\n\nSince the issuing of President Burnham's press _statement\n\nevidence has come to light through the Venezuelan media of other\n\nJevelopments giving cause for more concern. No less than :i\n\nI •••\n\nAnnex 54\n\nA/C.1/36/9\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 16\n\nMinister of the Government of Venezuela has publicly boasted of\n\nthe fact that he has recently led a substantial body of Venezuelans\n\nacross the border for the purpose of establishing acts of occupation\n\nby Venezuela in the territory of Guyana. The M_in~ster has _also\n\npublicly declared his intention to conduct other similar exercises.\n\nIn addition, the Venezuelan Government has openly announced\n\nthat it has given instructions to its various representatives abroad\n\nto implement a concerted strategy of opposing efforts by Guyana\n\nto obtain financial support for the implementation of projects\n\nvital to her economic development. By way of general\n\naccompaniment, the Venezuelan media is at all levels continuing\n\nits campaign of hostility.\n\nThe Nature of the Venezuelan Negotiating Process\n\nIt is difficult to negotiate in good faith with Venezuela. The\n\nTreaty of Washington 1897 was entered into by Britain with\n\nVenezuela as a result of pressure applied on Britain by the United\n\nStates on behalf of Venezuela. In appreciation of American support,\n\nGeorge Washington's statue in Caracas was covered with wreaths\n\nby jubilant Venezuelans. Yet Venezuela was later to say that she\n\nhad been coerced by America into signing the Treaty. Under the\n\nTreaty, as mentioned earlier, Venezuela and Britain undertook to\n\n\"consider the result of the proceedings of the Tribunal of\n\nArbitration as a full, perfect and final settlement of all questions\n\nreferred to the Arbitrators\". Venezuela, having for so long duly re­\n\nspected the decision of the tribunal, has now totally rejected it.\n\nAnd then there is the Protocol of Port-of-Spain itself. It was\n\nsigned in 1970 by the Foreign Minister of Guyana and the Foreign\n\nMinister of Venezuela at a ceremony presided over by the late\n\ndistinguished Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, the Right\n\nHonourable Dr. Eric Williams. The United Kingdom was also a\n\nsignatory. Yet in later years, when it suited her, Venezuela was to\n\ntake the position that the Protocol was not valid for the alleged\n\nreason_ .that it had never been formally ratified by the Venezuelan\n\nCongress.\n\nGuyana's experience has been shared by othen. In 1901\n\nVenezuela rejected an arrangement which she had previously come\n\nto with Colombia over the frontier between them. In 1980\n\nVenezuela similarly rejected an agreement reached by a Venezuela/\n\nColombia Mixed Boundary Commission which had demarcated the\n\nI ...\n\nAnnex 54\n\nboundary betwe~n the two states in the Gulf of Venezuela. It is\n\n~own that leading el~ments within Venezuela are opposed to any\n\n-\n\n0\n\n~ of settlement with Colombia which does not result in lhe\n\nentirety of the Gu!f_ being ;,,warded to Venezuela, and this despile\n\nt~c fact that Colombia has a substantial coast line along the western\n\ns1~e of the ~ul_f. According to the Venezuelan members of the\n\nMixed Comm1ss1on, they had acted with the approval and support\n\nof. the _Venezuelan President himself. Not surprisingly they\n\nresigned ,n protest.\n\n- -\n\n·\n\nNegotiations with Venezuela are never easy - particularly\n\nwhere smaller states are concerned.\n\nVe:,ezuelan Revanchism\n\nIn her own eyes, Venezuela must be the most \"despoiled\"\n\ncountry in South America. She has lerritorial claims against\n\nColombia. Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago have not yet settled\n\nthe demarcation of their boundaries in all their aspects. Grenada\n\nand Venezuela need to settle the limits of their respective maritime\n\njurisdictions. Venezuela has established her suzerainty over Bird\n\nIsland in the Caribbean, and she is yet to conclude discussions\n\nregarding demarcations in the sea between Bird Island and the\n\nFrench territory of Martinique. And Venezuela claims five-eighths\n\nof Guyana. Of all states in this region it is, perhaps significantly,\n\nonly against the Federative Republic of Brazil that Venezuela has\n\nno territorial claim.\n\nThe Past and the future\n\nIn J 96R Cde. L.F.S. Burnham. then Prime Minister of\n\nGuyana, in a speech to Parliament had cause to lament one of\n\nVenezuela's several breaches of international law. It was a breach\n\nof the Geneva Agreement, occasioned by the Venez~elan Decree\n\nof 1968 i:,urporting to annex a belt of sea off G~ya~a s c~ast. Cde.\n\nBurnham spoke in terms which had a prophet•~ nng. His words.\n\nwith which this memorandum might conveniently end, were\n\nthese I\n\ncannot teU with any certainty where this ill-advised\n\ncourse of action on which the Government of Venezuela ~as\n\nembarked will lead us.

Venezuela\n\nhas now made clear her intention to seek relentlessly to re­\n\nimpose the yoke of colonialism on a small nation that has\n\nsucceeded in freeing itself from the tutelage of another\n\nimperial power. We have no quarrel with the v~nezuelan\n\npeople but we shall not lack courage or resolve in resisting\n\naggressive demands of a Venezuelan Government that is\n\nprepared to defile the traditions of Bolivar and to flout the\n\nprecepts of hemispheric and world order and security .\n\nIn our stand for survival we shall call upon the conscience\n\nof all peace-loving people to speak out in our cause and we\n\nshall need all our unity as a people so that our voice may be\n\nheard in all comers of the world and in all the councils of the\n\nworld's institutions for peace.\n\nAnnex 55\n\nLetter from the Minster of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Venezuela to the Minister of\n\nForeign Affairs of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana (Dec. 1981)\n\nAnnex 55\n\nAnnex 56\n\nLetter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Venezuela to the Minister of\n\nForeign Affairs of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana (19 Sept. 1982)\n\nAnnex 56\n\n(p ,\n\nUNOFFOCIAL TRANSLATION (GUYANA)\n\nCaracas, September 19, 1982.\n\nHis Excellency,\n\nMr. Rashleigh Jackson,\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs ,\n\nCo-operative Republic of Guyana.\n\nGeorgetown:\n\nMr. Minister,\n\nI have the honour of addressing you on the occasioo of\n\nreferring to compliance with the procedures laid down by the Geneva\n\nAgreement of February 17, 1966.\n\nThe period of three months provided for in Article IV 2\n\nof the Geneva Agreement has expired without it having been possible to\n\nreach agreement on one of the means of peaceful settlement of contro­\n\nversies provided for in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter.

Mr. SERICHE BIOKO (Equatorial Guinea)\n\n7. Three years ago, in the same statement, the\n\nGovernment of the Supreme Military Council, estab­\n\nlished by that liberating action of the people of\n\nEquatorial Guinea undertook freely and resolutely,\n\nbefore the world and history, the sacred obligation of\n\nmaking every necessary effort to remove my people\n\nfrom the abandonment and destruction in which it\n\n(interpretation from Spanish): It is a great honour for\n\nme to avail myself of this opportunity to address the\n\nAssembly in the name of the people of the Republic\n\nhad ~en plunged by the former regime.\n\nof Equatorial Guinea and their President, Colonel\n\nObiang Nguema Mbasogo, whom I repn,sent here,\n\nand to express to the vast family of the international\n\ncommunity the brotherly greetings and solidarity of\n\nmy country.\n\n8. Of course, the Government of the Supreme\n\nMilitary Council had no idea of the enormous dif•\n\nficulties that would later arise in the country•s\n\nreconstruction. Indeed, the difficulties were and are\n\nenormous and multiple, since our task consists in\n\neliminating the trauma from the minds of the citizens\n\nof Equatorial Guinea and building a new and different\n\nsociety. To this end, we have the urgent need to\n\ngive priority to rehabmtating those fields of activity\n\nmost important to the normalization oflife in Equatorial\n\nGuinea, namely, health, education, agriculture. and,\n\nabove all, the economy-the decisive. factor in -the\n\nentire process of our reconstruction and development.\n\n4. I am particularly pleased to pause here to express,\n\non my own behalf and on that of the delegation over\n\nwhich I have the honour of presiding, our most\n\nsincere congratulations to you, Mr. President on your\n\nwell-deserved election as President of the Assembly\n\nto direct and preside efficiently over the debates that\n\nwill be held throughout these days during wh!ch we\n\nshall be trying to find viable solutions to the innumer­\n\nable problems which affect our world of today and\n\nconstantly threaten peace and the civic and harmonious\n\ncoexistence of peoples. It is our profound hope that\n\nyour presidency will oe carried out with the ·equani­\n\nmity, foresight, wisdom and high diplomatic skills\n\nwhich have always characterized you and won for\n\nyou t~e respect and esteem of us all. I should al~\n\n9. Today we can be proud of having worked honesily\n\nand resolutely, facing every difficulty and overcotriir,g\n\nall kinds of obstacles to achieve some positive goats\n\nalong the lonq and difficult road of reconstruction.\n\nOur achievements can be seen by all in Equatorial\n\nGuinea, and it would be too much for me to try to\n\n273\n\nA/37/PV.16\n\nAnnex 57\n\n274\n\nlist them here, achie:v~ments which, I must add,\n\nwould not have ,been possible without the decisive\n\nsupport of the international commupity.\n\n.\n\n·\n\nstrict respect of the. human person. On past occa&ions\n\nwe listed in various statements the measures, w,e :hav.e\n\ntak-en, from the liberation of all political prisonJ'r5 to\n\nthe drafting and presentation to the.people of a Con,sti­\n\ntution. which our Government has been implementing\n\nfaithfully, to comply with the promise and commitfl)ent\n\nentered into before our people and history. . . , .\n\n10. When, in order to·brirtg· al:kittt· the economic\n\nrelaunching of Equatorial Guinea and in response to\n\nthe pathetic appeal made by my country, the United\n\nNations approved the holding of an international pledg­\n\ning conference at Geneva, we could not have guessed\n\nthe significance it would tia,ve for our country. That\n\nConference, held at Geneva in the month of April\n\nlast-and attended personally by Colonel Obiang\n\nNguema Mbasogo, President of the Repuolic-repre­\n\nsented for my country a propitious opportunity for us\n\nto present in a clear, concise and detailed manner to\n\nthe international community an inventory of our most\n\nurgent needs and the projects we have for solving them\n\ngradually, and at the same time to request assistance\n\nfrom international financial circles in obtaining con­\n\ntributions for the financing of those projects.\n\n14. Indeed, the Government of the Supreme Military\n\nCouncil, faithfully following the line of conduct it\n\nestablished when it first came to power, and in\n\ncompliance with General Assembly resolution 34/123\n\nwhich established the programme for the gradual\n\ndemocratization of our country, has lived up to its\n\npromise made to the people on the occasion of the\n\nsecond anniversary of the ufreedom coup\", and has\n\ndrafted the text of a constitution which, in order to\n\ncomply with the requirements of our time regarding\n\nguarantees of human freedoms and the principles of the\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, it submitted\n\nfor revision to United Nations experts appointed for\n\nthat purpose by the Division on Human Rights.\n\n11. Through not only the assistance but also the\n\ninterest and understanding of the international com­\n\nmunity, we were able to revise our forecasts, which\n\nwas a source of great satisfaction to us, and we are\n\nvery grateful to the countries which attended the\n\nPledging Conference and showed interest in several of\n\nthe projects we submitted there. We are also grateful\n\nto the governmental and non-governmental organiza­\n\ntions which also showed an interest in our projects\n\nand to the United Nations system which, with special\n\nzeal and sincerity, worked ceaselessly to ensure the\n\nsmooth running and success of the Conference, whose\n\nresults are already being made visible in Equatorial\n\nGuinea through the large number of representatives of\n\ncountries and international organizations who have\n\ncome to maintain the first contacts and evaluate on\n\nthe spot the possibilities of carrying out the proposed\n\nprojects within the context of that Conference.\n\n15. On 2 August 1982 that Constitution was officially\n\nand solemnly presented by Colonel 0biang Nguema\n\nMbasogo, President of the Republic, to the people of\n\nEquatorial Guinea. On 15 August the people was\n\nconsulted in a popular referendum about whether or not\n\nit accepted the text of the Constitution. On 21 August,\n\nthe National Referendum Committee announced the\n\nofficial results of that referendum.\n\n16. It is my pleasure here to announce with pride\n\nto the international community that the people of the\n\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, in a referendum\n\nconducted through a direct, free and secret ballot,\n\nhas provided itself with a new democratic constitution,\n\nsupported by an overwhelming majority of 95 per cent\n\nof the votes cast, o:n ttie basis or a 96 P.er cent\n\nvoter turnout.\n\n12. I have been specially asked by the President of\n\nthe Republic to avail myself · of this opportunity to\n\nexpress, on behalf of the Government and people of\n\n· Equatorial Guinea, our sincere gratitude to all those\n\nwho participated in or contributed in any way to that\n\nConference, and our thanks for the fruitful results it\n\nachieved. It is an obvious proof of solidarity which\n\nthe people of Equatorial Guinea will never forget,\n\nand we are confident that the spirit of that Conference\n\n17. On the same occasion, and in accordance with\n\nanother provision of the Constitution, Colonel Obiang\n\nNguema Mbasogo, by the acclamation of the people\n\nand in expression of its free will, was charged with\n\nguiding the sacred destiny of Equatorial Guinea for the\n\nseven years following the adoption of the Constitution.\n\n18. That massive, unanimous election of Colonel\n\nwill be kept alive and fervent, and that there will be\n\nincreasing interest in assisting our country both on the\n\npart of the countries which attended the Conference,\n\nand on the part of those which, while not having\n\nbeen able to attend, feel\" a sense of' solidarity with\n\nthe cause of my country's reconstruction.\n\nObiang Nguema Mbasogo to the nation's highest\n\noffice was free from any trickery and resulted from the\n\ndesire of the people of Equatorial Guinea to maintain\n\ncontinuity in the process of democratization it has\n\nundertaken, and that the same guiding hand should\n\ncomplete it, before proceeding to the general elections\n\nto take place at the end of the seven-year term of\n\nthe presjdential mandate.\n\n13. One of the most serious injuries suffered by the\n\npeople of Equatorial Guinea during the dictatorship\n\nwas the undisguised and unprecedented suppression\n\nof . our fundamental rights, leaving the citizen of\n\nEquatorial Guinea deprived of his minimum riiBhts.\n\nThere are numerous examples that bear eloquent\n\n.\n\n.\n\ntest;mony to the acts of the past regime which with\n\n19. Our Constitution, the basic code which now\n\nrules and guides the sacred destiny of my people,\n\nprovides for a Council of State, a People's House\n\nof Representatives, a Court of Justice, a National\n\nCouncil for Economic Development and Community ·\n\nCouncils. The latter are adapted to our national situa­\n\ntion for democratization by giving. the power structure\n\nits roots in the communities, in the countryside.\n\ni~pu~ity c~elly jeopardized those rights. Therefore,\n\none of .the main goals of the Supreme Military Coun­\n\ncil, when it took power on 3 August 1979, was to\n\nrestore those . fundamental rights to the people of\n\nEquatorial Guinea; and from that very year a gradual\n\nbut firm process of democratization of the country was\n\ninitiated and measures adopted for the scrupulous and\n\n20. We think we have kept our word to the inter­\n\nnational community, given in the Assembly, and are\n\npleased to have done so before the time set in a\n\nprogramme drawn up in collaboration with~the United\n\nAnnex 57\n\n16th meeling-4 October· 1982\n\n275\n\nNations. Our devotion to the people, and our historic\n\ncommitment to it, have enabled us to provide that\n\npeople, only three years after taking power, with a\n\ndemocratic constitution, with aH the organs and\n\nconditions required to ensure scrupulous respect of its\n\nbasic rights and the enjoyment of a state of law,\n\nin keeping with the standards of the second half of the\n\ntwentieth century.\n\nmost appropriate place to denounce the alarming and\n\ngrowi,11g abandonment by nations of the principle of\n\ndialogue in favour of the spirit of war and confron­\n\ntation. The cold war, which, during the post-war years,\n\nhad itself been a threat hovering over the peoples,\n\nhas dangerously given way to the proliferation of armed\n\nconfrontations.\n\n21. We are fully convinced that, just as it responded\n\nmassively and affirmatively in favour of the Constitu­\n\ntion, our people will also be ab2e to live up to it by\n\nsafeguarding and respecting it, so that, with the\n\nConstitution as <>Ur cornerstone and beacon, we shall\n\ngo forward together in peace and national harmony\n\nto accomplish the very difficult task of reconstructing\n\nthe country.\n\n28. National leaders are growing more intransigent,\n\nand the results of this are there to be seen: self­\n\ndestruction and the tens of thousands of human\n\nbeings who are paying with their lives for wars waged\n\nfor sterile claims. Such problems are of profound\n\nconcern to my Government; they are to be seen far\n\nbeyond the walls of this Hall, and it is imperative\n\nthat practical solutions be found. I 1•efer especially-but\n\nonly by way of example-to the conflict between\n\nIraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the que~t~on\n\n22. Basic difficulties-such as those we face in\n\nthe area of food and, above all, in restoring the\n\ncountry to economic health-have shown us that our\n\nstrength is limited, although our efforts are enormous.\n\nWe are therefore certain that we cannot travel this\n\nhard road on our own, without the steadfast assistance\n\nof the international community, whether bilateral or\n\nmultilateral.\n\nof the Malvinas, the occupation of Cyprus, the situa­\n\ntion on the Korean peninsula, a practical satisfactory\n\nsolution for which has been sought since 1966 without\n\nsuccess, the untenable status of Namibia.\n\n29. All these problems ,iave a significant effect on\n\nthe noble principles of the self-determination of peo­\n\nples, respect for human rights and non-interference\n\nin the internal affairs of States, principles to which\n\nmy Government adheres and abides by. Along with\n\nthis, there is the constant tension in the Middle East,\n\nwhich has become more acute with the invasion of\n\nLebanon and the killing of Palestinians by fsrae1i\n\nforces, which constitute flagrant flouting of the inalien­\n\nable rights of an entire people. Further, terrorism runs\n\nrampant in Europe.\n\n23. Regarding bilateral relations, we have sought\n\nto break with the isolation which the past regime\n\nimposed on our people for more than a decade, and\n\nwe have not only succeeded in re-establishing inter­\n\nnational credibility and trust, but have greatly strength­\n\nened the links that unite us with neighbouring coun­\n\ntries, with the African continent, and the world in\n\ngeneral, without ideological or bloc discrimination.\n\n24. In this connection it is my honour to mention\n\nthe excellent relations of co-operation between the\n\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea with Spain, whose\n\nassistance has always been decisive for our country,\n\nas well as the relations we maintain with France,\n\nthe United States of America, the People's Republic\n\nof China, Morocco, the Federal Republic of Germany,\n\nSwitzerland and Egypt, to name but a few. These are\n\ncountries whose co-operation has already taken\n\npositive form in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n30. The African continent continues to be the theatre\n\nfor military operations and adventures by non-African\n\nPowers. Those Powers are fomenting discord and\n\nconfrontation among our States, in order to weaken\n\nus and freely to exploit our resources, imposing on\n\nas truly humiliating trading conditions.\n\n31. The tensions which exist are well known and do\n\nnot need a special review at this time, for they are\n\nalways a part of the daily life of our continent and\n\npose a grave threat to the Organization of African\n\nUnity [OAU]. This is not the time for a detailed\n\nanalysis of this tragic problem, for we believe that that\n\n25. Our relations of co-operation with the neighbour­\n\ning brother countries of the United Republic of Came­\n\nroon, the Republic of Gabon and the Federal Republic\n\nof Nigeria are excellent, for those countries have\n\nspared neither effort nor moral and material means tl'\n\nencourage us and• spur us on to continue resolutely\n\nthe great task of reconstruction. I express, before the\n\nAssembly, our deepest gratitude to them. We have\n\nsigned agreements on bilateral co-operation with Sao\n\nTome and Principe.\n\nanalysis and a solution to the problem are an inter­\n\nAfrican responsibility.\n\n32. Nevertheless we appeal to African States to show\n\nmaturity and find a single firm and decisive solution\n\nto the crisis, one respecting the integrity and inviola­\n\nbility of the fundamental principles of the charter\n\nof the OAU. We cannot permit the disintegration\n\nof the OAU because our solidarity would thereby\n\nbe profoundly affected, as it is our best weapon in\n\nour struggle against the political, economic and social\n\ninjustices from which the African continent suffers.\n\n26. As to the community of Hispanic nations, we\n\nare aware of the affinities and identity which unite\n\nus to it, and we are making every effort to achieve\n\ngreater integration and to establish solid links with\n\n33. We are pleased at the return to order in Chad\n\nand we wish that brother people peace and prosperity.\n\nour brothers in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nregion. 'fhere are already joint projects with the Argen­\n\ntine Republic, and our ties with other countries such\n\nas Venezuela, Cuba and Mexico, are strengthening\n\nand are becoming increasingly positive.\n\n27. In a world like ours in the second half of the\n\ntwentieth century, our concerns can only grow. We\n\nbelieve that this rostrum-the Assembly-is the\n\n34. In accordance with this line of thinking, the\n\npeople of Equatorial Guinea, in the person of .. its\n\nPresident, Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, whom I\n\nhave the honour to represent in the A~cmbly, is in\n\nfavour of finding immediate and ·positive solutions to\n\nthese disputes by way of dialogue and mutual under­\n\nstanding, involving the consistent, clear, and literal\n\nAnnex 57\n\n276\n\nGeneral Assembly-Thirty-seventh Session-Plenary Meetings\n\nimplementation of the relevant resolutions on these\n\ndisputes adopted by this great Organization.\n\nArms manufacture and the development of new\n\nand powerful means of destruction cast gloom over the\n\npositive achievements of our civilization, and now\n\nthere is a real danger that tomorrow, just as the\n\ntwenty-first century is about to begin, we may find\n\nourselves with a world in ruins unless common sense\n\nprevails.\n\n35. As Vice-President of the Supreme Military\n\nCouncil, and . having the honour of representing the\n\nPresident of the Republic, it remains only for me to\n\nreiterate to the Assembly that my Government is\n\nresolutely determined to promote the social and\n\neconomic development of our country, strictly and\n\nfaithfully to comply with the process of democra­\n\ntization which we have started, to respect the Uni­\n\nversal Declaration of Human Rights and to make every\n\neffort to help establish solid foundations for peace\n\nin the world.\n\n42. These are some glimpses oft he realities of today•s\n\nworld, which persist despite the efforts of the O~ani­\n\nzation. My delegation would like to state certain\n\nviews on these matters, as an expressicn of the\n\nunswerving Bolivian position on principles and inter­\n\nnational policies.\n\n36. The PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\n\nAssembly, I thank the Vice-President and Minister of\n\nHealth of Equatorial Guinea for the important state­\n\nment he has just made.\n\n43. B().-livia is one of the non-aligned countries, for\n\ncompelling reasons of principle and also because we\n\nadvocate the elimination of dogmatic compartmentali­\n\nzation and hegemonic bonds and because self-determi­\n\nnation and the inviolability of sovereignty are the\n\n37. Mr. SAAVEDRA WEISE (Bolivia) (i11terpre­\n\ntt1tim1 from SpcmishJ: It is a great and significant\n\nhonour for me to come to this rostrum representing\n\nmy country before the world.\n\nproper response to the efforts of the various forms of\n\nimperialism to absorb others. The non-aligned coun­\n\ntries advocate a role of balance in defence of the rights\n\nof the weaker countries in the face of the cold struggle\n\nby the great Powers for supremacy.\n\n38. My first words go to you, Mr. President, to\n\ncongratulate you on your well-deserved election as\n\nPresident of this session of the Assembly. Your\n\nunmistakable gifts as an experienced diplomat guar­\n\nantee the success of our work. It is a pleasure, and\n\nnot merely a formality, for me to convey the thanks\n\nand congratulations of my Government to Mr. Kittani\n\nof Iraq for the wise and successful way in which he\n\ncarried out his duties as President of the thirty-sixth\n\nsession.\n\n44. Those who supply raw materials and make great\n\nsacrifices in their struggle to achieve their development\n\nhave their spokesmen in the non-aligned countries.\n\nThe demands and claims made by many of our\n\npeoples have received a positive echo in the voice of\n\nthe non-aligned countries. That is the case, for exam­\n\nple, with Bolivia's demand for the restoration of its\n\nsovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Only an equi­\n\ndistant position between the imperialist forces,\n\navoiding subjugation and imposed conditions, can\n\ngrant a country moral authority and consideration in\n\ninternational affairs, and that is precisely the position\n\nwhich the non-aligned countries seek.\n\n45. It is this unswerving support for the principles\n\nof self-determination and sovereignty which has led the\n\nGovernment of Bolivia, presided over by General\n\nGuido Vildoso Calderon, to apply a policy of a return\n\nto democratic institutional rights for our people.\n\n39. Recently the United Nations has seen its mission\n\neven further enriched by the appointment as Secretary­\n\nGeneral of one of its most distinguished officials,\n\nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, a most worthy represen­\n\ntative of Peruvian diplomacy. Bolivia reiterates its\n\npleasure at his appointment and its congratulations\n\nand best wishes to him, the first Secretary-General\n\nrepresenting Latin America, and the brotherly and\n\nancestral ties between Bolivia and Peru and the Andean\n\ncountries are well known. His presence as Secretary­\n\nGeneral is a sound guarantee for the fulfilment of\n\nthe purposes of the Organization.\n\n46. In Bolivia we have set in motion the pre-electoral\n\nprocess, with the scheduling of a general election\n\nfor April 1983. The consensus achieved among the\n\n40. For years we have been expressing our faith and\n\nreiterating our purposes. Every year we come here and\n\nrepeat our intention to carry out the purposes and\n\nprinciples of the Charter. We announce optimistic\n\noutlines for the future and the definite achievement\n\nof our aims. However, realistically and objectively\n\nI think we must now pause on our way to see whether\n\nwe have really moved beyond mere statements to\n\nconcrete achievement.\n\npolitical parties on the basis of the invitation to\n\nparticipate made by the Government without any\n\ndiscrimination has led to the constitution of a National\n\nElectoral Court. We have also started on the study\n\nof a plan for economic recovery in order to apply\n\nemergency provisions to overcome the situation of\n\ndeficit and the serious crisis inherited by the present\n\nGovernment. As a result of a study, the economic\n\nplan was, also on the basis of consultations, brought\n\nto the notice of the political forces and the trade\n\nunions; a political and economic dialogue thus took\n\nplace.\n\n4 J • Peace is still an unachievable goal and perhaps,\n\nsad to say, a nostalgic dream of Utopia. Colonialism\n\nstill seeks to broaden its areas of domination, ~ith\n\naggressive and even bloody usurpation; hegemony. and\n\n47. Giving effect to the general feelings expressed\n\nthe use of pressure by the powerful still persevere\n\nand indeed show a disturbing tendency to increase.\n\nInequalities and injustices continue to show their ugly\n\nfaces. Terrorism and new treacherous forms of aggres­\n\nsion, under cover of the advocacy of change, disrupt\n\nevery form of coexistence. Racial discrimination con­\n\ntinues as a flaw of mankind in our time. Territories\n\nconquered by force of arms remain in foreign hands.\n\nby the political parties and labour representatives,\n\nwho requested an immediate transition to a democratic\n\nsystem, the Bolivian Government has decided to\n\nconvene the representative Parliament elected in the\n\n1980 elections, which had been suspended by a\n\nmilitary coup at the time, so that that Parliament\n\nwm, in accordance with the norms of tl)e politicaJ\n\nConstitution of the State, appoi!'t the new office\n\nAnnex 57\n\n16th meetlr•g-4 October 1982\n\n277\n\nholders who will have charge of the nation from\n\n.10 October next. For them and their arduous task in\n\ngovernment we request the solidarity of all nations,\n\nparticularly on account of the grave economic crisis\n\nthat my country is experiencing. The new constitu­\n\ntional authorities will have to overcome that crisis\n\nand will need all the co-operation that they can\n\npossibly obtain from friendly countries-combined,\n\nof course, with Bolivia\"s own efforts-in order that\n\nBolivia may progress.\n\ncultural liberation of peoples who, like those of Boiivia,\n\nare currently engaged in their own development.\n\nIf manifest unwillingness and delaying tactics con­\n\ntinue to be shown, it will be impossible to intensify\n\nthe co-operation which at the international level\n\nshould promote the development of nations in a\n\nsetting of justice and equity. We therefore look forward\n\nvery much to the prompt initiation of the global\n\nnegotiations.\n\n48. All this process of transition to democracy has\n\ntaken place within the framework of an unchanging\n\nrespect for human rights and the prerogatives of the\n\ncitizens, and on the basis of the fulfilment of the\n\ntreaties and international commitments entered into by\n\nBolivia.\n\n55. Understanding, co-operation and the proc~sses of\n\nintegration have another requirement in order to be\n\nperfect-the redressing of injustices and inequalities.\n\n1 must refer once again, before the world community\n\nassembled here, to our geographical condition-the\n\nfact that we are landlocked, a fact that has been\n\nforced upon us for the past 103 years. This reference\n\nalso derives from the imperative mandate given by my\n\n49. On 10 October next the armed forces of Bolivia\n\npeople, who for more than a century have pressed\n\nfor their rights to return, with sovereignty, to the\n\nshores of the Pacific.\n\nwill restore the political control of the nation to a\n\ncivilian Government. This voluntary gesture, in\n\nkeeping with the wishes of the Bolivian people, is\n\nworth emphasizing in this international forum.\n\n56. We all know that when they have the stamp of\n\nlegitimacy the rights of nations are never exhausted.\n\nTherefore, the return of territories which have been\n\nusurped in so many latitudes of the world is essential.\n\n50. Another subject which I cannot refrain from\n\nmentioning is that of the progress of integration.\n\nHappily, we are living in a time of integration and\n\neconomic co-operation, of interdependence. AH\n\nnations-literally all-need something from others.\n\nThere is inevitably a need for raw materials, goods and\n\nservices, technology, credits and assistance of all sorts.\n\nWhat is important is that the prices should be fair,\n\nexchanges just and that co-operation have but one\n\naim-to secure the goal of shared development and\n\ncommon benefit.\n\n·\n\n57. With regard to the maritime problem of Bolivia,\n\nthe time of our return to the Pacific Ocean is bound\n\nto come. But good faith is necessary for this, together\n\nwith a clear readiness by the other party to make\n\nreparations. We also need action and the encourage­\n\nment and support of the international organizations,\n\nparticularly if, as is fortunately the c,,ae, we have the\n\nfirm support of the majority of th~ ·,~orld community\n\nfor our just cause.\n\n51. In the regional and sub-regional spheres Bolivia\n\nhas been taking part in all the programmes of integra­\n\ntion and co-operation. Its special geographical\n\nlocation in South America and the fact that it is a\n\ncountry with tributaries of three of the four major\n\nriver basins of the continent has given it a unique\n\nstatus as a signatory country of all the sub-regional\n\nagreements as well as the regional treaties of the Latin\n\nAmerican Integration Association and the Latin Amer­\n\nican Economic System. For example. we are a member\n\nof the Cartagena Agreement, binding on the Andean\n\n58. Humanity has virtually put an end to one of the\n\nmost degrading and odious systems adopted by man in\n\nthe past-slavery. But, late in the twentieth century,\n\nstill other grievous vestiges of the past remain as an\n\naffront to mankind-colonialism and racial discrimi­\n\nnation.\n\n59- Twenty-two years have elapsed since the General\n\nAssembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting\n\nof Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples\n\n[resol11tio11 /5/4 (XVJ). Each year we revert to the\n\nnations. and a signatory of the Treaty for Amazonian\n\nterms of that declaration and the General Assembly\n\nCo-operation and the Treaty of the River Plate Basin.\n\n52. The Bolivian position with regard to the process\n\nof integration is clear. We uphold the need to preserve,\n\nexpand and improve the machinery of the integration\n\nprocess. Integration and the programmes and actions\n\nfor co-operation are only a means towards the ends of\n\ndevelopment and the harmonious progress of our\n\nnations. We must also nurture, strengthen and improve\n\nthose instruments of economic and social progress.\n\nwhose sole beneficiaries must of course be our peoples\n\nand their future.\n\nadopts new resolutions on specific cases. Neverthe­\n\nless, new forms of colonialist aggressaon can be clearly\n\nseen. not simply disregarding the principles and pur­\n\nposes of the Charter but clearly violating them. A\n\nrecent example was the case of the Malvinas Islands,\n\nwith its bloody epilogue, leading to the restoration\n\nof colonialism. which should give us food for serious\n\nthought.\n\n60. Faithful to its position of principle on the rejection\n\nof any form of colonialism, Bolivia supported the\n\nArgentine cause and will continue to support the\n\ndemands for repossession of its territory made by our\n\nbrother nation of the River Plate, as we have done\n\n53. We must also make the North-South dialogue a\n\nreality and seek ways to give viable form to the new\n\ninternational economic order. This scheme has so far\n\nnot had the acceptance. the solidarity and particularly\n\nthe political will of the industrialized nations. which it\n\nneeds if its basic objectives are to be met.\n\nsince 1833. when the President of Bolivia at that time\n\nwas the first to speak up against the British usurpa­\n\ntion of that era.\n\n61. We can never try hard enough in the Organiza­\n\ntion to put an end to colonialism and all forms of\n\nseizure of territories and the imposition of tutelage\n\nand foreign rule on peoples. On the day we dispose\n\n54. These problems. therefore. should be seen as\n\npart of the struggle for economic. political. social and\n\nAnnex 57\n\n278\n\nGeneral AS!lembl,-Tblrty«venth ~\n\nMeetings\n\nof these last vestjges of colonialism mankind will be\n\nable to take pride in having taken an enormous step\n\ntowards a world of truly free communities, such as\n\nthose for .which the Liberator Bolivar fought. His\n\nbicentenary is to be commemorated next year, and I\n\nam sure that the Organization will wish to participate\n\nin commemorating that anniversary, thereby con­\n\nfirming the universal nature of Bolivar's thinking and\n\ndeeds.\n\nthe production of new and menacing means of destruc­\n\ntion have continued. Unfortunately, each conflict\n\ngives rise to improvements in and new uses for the\n\nmeans of warfare, as was the case in the recent painful\n\nconflict over the Malvinas.\n\n70. Perhaps what is needed to stop the arms buildup\n\nis in the first place spiritual disarmament: the elimina­\n\ntion of hatred and prejudice; the liquidation of barriers\n\nof ideological animosity; the promotion of fellowship,\n\nbearing in mind that mankind is after all a single entity\n\nand that fraternal understanding is possible.\n\n62. With regard to racial discrimination and ttpart­\n\nheicl, my country•s consistent attitude has been one of\n\nopposition and condemnation of that situation and\n\nsystem, which are a breach of the elementary prin­\n\nciples of equality and human rights.\n\n63. Man holds certain rights even before his birth.\n\nIf we commit a breach of those rights, we offend\n\nGod, who modelled our spirit on His image and in His\n\n71. The period of multiple crises which mankind is\n\nonce again experiencing is straining our capacity to\n\nface up to the chaJlenge it presents and our courage.\n\nThe Organization is again being put to the test and\n\nwe the Members must not evade this tremendous\n\nchallenge but meet it head on. The principles of the\n\nCharter and all the resolutions and declarations gener­\n\nated by the problems of the world form a basic body\n\nof norms accepted by all the world.

I said at the beginning of this statement that\n\npeace was an objective that the world had not yet\n\nachieved. The rer.:ent distressing events in the Middle\n\nEast, particularly those in Lebanon, give some idea of\n\nthe deplorable situation.\n\n65. I must express here the deep concern of the\n\nBolivian community and its Government over the now\n\nlong-drawn-out crisis in the Middle East, which has\n\nso grievously affected varim.1s peoples in the region.\n\nWe must strive to find there an understanding which,\n\nwith recognition of the rights of the countries involved,\n\nwill bring about a return to peaceful coexistence and\n\nmutual respect.\n\n66. Violence can only give rise to greater violence\n\nand peace is not a free gift; it must be built carefully,\n\nwith sacrifice and magnanimity.\n\n67. The mission of the United Nations with regard to\n\nthe· problems of the Middle East and of the world in\n\ngeneral is stiJI an arduous one requiring unswerving\n\ncommitment. We must all be committed to this task\n\nif we want to show that man is capable of thinking\n\nof the future, using his intelligence to coexist and to\n\nbuild, to reconcile differing views and not to hate,\n\nthus overcoming a shameful recent past, which\n\nparadoxically encompassed the greatest examples\n\nof barbarity and tragedy as well as the greatest\n\n72. Mr. Y AQUB-KHAN (Pakistan): I should like\n\nfirst to convey to you, Sir, the warm and sincere\n\nfelicitations of the delegation of Pakistan on your\n\nelection to the presidency of the thirty-seventh ses­\n\nsion of the General Assembly. Your assumption of this\n\nhigh office is an acknowledgement by the inter­\n\nnational community of your outstanding merit and\n\nqualities as a statesman. It is also a tribute to your\n\ngreat country. I wish you every success in guiding the\n\ndeliberations of the General Assembly on the complex\n\nissues facing it in the year ahead. I should like to\n\ntake this opportunity of expressing our esteem and\n\nadmiration for your predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who\n\npresided over the thirty-sixth session of the Ceneral\n\nAssembly with great distinction and success. I should\n\nalso like to convey our deep appreciation to Mr. Perez\n\nde Cuellar for his dedicated and unremitting efforts in\n\nsearch of peace during a year which has seen a succes­\n\nsion of crises and continuing turmoil. We commend his\n\nresolve in the bleak international circumstances of\n\ntoday. to strengthen the role and influence of the\n\niJnited Nations in the conduct of international\n\nrelations.\n\nachievements of the technological era. The answer\n\nto the challenge of the years to come lies within\n\nus; it is the possibility of offering the coming genera­\n\ntions a world of harmony, peace and justice.\n\n68. These difficult problems concerning peaceful\n\ncoexistence lead to another major theme of our age.\n\nI am referring to the problem of disarmament. A\n\nBolivian writer has said:\n\n.. Two of the greatest mistakes made by mankind\n\nwere to condemn Socrates and to manufacture\n\nthe atomic bomb. The first did violence to I\n\nthe\n\nmeaning of justice; the second showed man the road\n\nto his own destruction.··\n\n73. fhe report of the Secretary-General on the work\n\nof the Organization [A/37/ /] is an eloquent and candid\n\ncomment on the grim reality of the international\n\nsituation, which he has succinctly described as ••inter­\n\nnational anarchy... In the recent past we have wit­\n\nnessed an alarming intensification of conflicts and\n\ntensions. use of force with impunity. growing mistrust\n\namong nations, increasing confrontation in East-West\n\nrelations and a new escalation in the arms race. which\n\nin this nuclear age portends the gravest consequences\n\nfor the very survival of mankind. This spiral of\n\nviolence is accompanied by a deepening apathy\n\nregarding the principles of the Charter of the United\n\nNations and an indifference regarding the role of this\n\ninstitution as the primary multilateral instrument for\n\nthe maintenar•ce of international peace and security.\n\n69. Instruments have been adopted by the United\n\nNations and at the multilateral and bilateral levels\n\non the need for disarmament and the prohibition of\n\nnuclear weapons including resolutions banning test\n\nexplosions in the atmosphere and under water. In\n\nopen contradiction with these commitments, however,\n\n74. The gravity of the international scene demands a\n\nthe arms buildup, the sophistication of weapons and\n\nrededication to the ideals of the United Nations\n\nAnnex 57\n\n16th raeeting-4 October 1982\n\n279\n\nin-:the• same spirit of commitment' as led to the\n\nfoundation of this world .forum after the agony and\n\nhorror of the Second.

In our neighbourhood, the crisis in Afghanistan\n\nresulting from Soviet military intervention in that\n\ncountry nearly three years ago persists, with no sign of\n\nreprieve in its severity. The Afghan national resist•\n\nance has proved to be enduring and steadfast, despite\n\nthe awesome military superiority and sophisticated\n\nmodem equipment deplo¥C:_d against it.\n\n76. The recent massacre of Palestinians in west\n\nBeirut epitomizes the tragedy of the Palestinian natfon.\n\nThe shock and indignation felt throughout the world\n\nover this massacre should serve as a reminder of the\n\n82. The presence of 100,000 foreign mtiitary troops\n\nin Afghanistan, with its dangerous portents for the\n\nstability of the entire region, continues to evoke.deep\n\ncontinuing Israeli crimes against the Palestinian\n\npeople, whose homeland has been usurped and who\n\nhave been subjected to relentless persecution. Since\n\nits occupation of the Arab and Palestinian territories in\n\n1967, Israel has been pursuing a systematic policy\n\nof annexing those terr.itories by changing their\n\ndemographic and historic character, establishing settle­\n\nments there and driving the Arab and Palestinian\n\npopulation into exile. In the process Israel is deter­\n\nmined to liquidate the identity and nationhood of\n\nPa1estinians in their ancient homeland.\n\nconcern in the .international community, which has\n\nconsistently pronounced itself on the illegality of that\n\npresence and has demanded its termination. The\n\nlatest expression of thfa international concern was\n\nembodied in General Assembly resolution 36/34,\n\nadopted last year with the overwhelming support of\n\n116 Member States, which outlined, once again, the\n\nessential elements of a just political solution of the\n\nAfghanistan problem, namely, the immediate with­\n\ndrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan, the\n\npreservation of the sovereignty, territorial integrity,\n\npolitical independence and non-aligned character of\n\nAfghanistan, the right of the Afghan people to\n\ndetermine its own form of government and to choose\n\nits economic, political and social system free from\n\noutside inte.·vention, subversion, coercion or con­\n\ntraint • of any kind whatsoever, and the creation of\n\nnecessary conditions which would enable the Afghan\n\nrefugees to return voluntarily to their homes in safety\n\nand honour.\n\n77. Beyond the occupied territories, Israel desires to\n\nestablish its military diktat and hegemony in the\n\nregion. It has attacked its neighbours at will and with\n\nimpunity. The brutal invasion of Lebanon, the cruel\n\nsiege of Beirut and the events which led to the Israeli\n\nadvance into the city and the massacre of Palestinians\n\nfully expose Israeli ambitions in the region. The\n\ncrisis in Lebanon should make it clear to Israel's\n\nfriends and allies that their support and protection\n\nonly encourage Israel to sustain its irredentist ambi­\n\ntions on the pretext of strengthening its security.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n83. Despite the repeated calls of the United Nations\n\nand similar demands by the movement of non-aligned\n\ncountries and the member States of the Organization\n\nof the Islamic Conference, the end of the crisis in\n\nAfghanistan is not in sight. It is a matter of regret\n\nth!tt the Soviet Union, which had traditionally enjoyed\n\ngood relations with countries of the ·area, including\n\nAfghanistan, and which takes pride in its solidarity\n\n78. The valour with which the Palestinian freedom\n\nfighters withstood the ferocious Israeli attacks, and\n\nthe sacrifices of the Palestinian people, b;;;ar testimony\n\nto the strength and justice of their cause, which\n\ncannot be trampled by terror and expansionism.\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] has\n\nemerged with renewed vigour as the voice for\n\nwith third-world causes, should engage and persist in\n\nPalestinian freedom and has won international acclaim\n\nfor its restraint.\n\nan action which has caused immense tragedy to the\n\npeople of Afghanistan and which has been firmly\n\nopposed by the international community.\n\n79. The proposals endorsed by the Twelfth Arab\n\nSummit Conference at Fez [see A/37/696] constitute\n\na major initiative for a durable peace in the Middle\n\nEast and demonstrate the sincere desire of the Arab\n\ncountries and the PLO to bring to a dignified and\n\nhonourable end the cha:,ter of conflict in the Middle\n\nEast. Predictably, Israel ha~ ,ejected the Fez plan,\n\nas well as the proposals by Pr,':sident Reagan, which\n\nillustrates Israel's obsession Wi!h holding on to the\n\noccupied Arab and Palestinian territories and its\n\n84. The grave political implications of the Afghan­\n\nistan crisis are compounded by a vast and growing\n\nhumanitarian prob!,:m in the exodus of the Afghan\n\npopulation on a massive scale from their country.\n\nNearly 3 million Afghan refugees, who represent one\n\nfifth of the total population of Afghanistan, have been\n\nforced to seek shelter on our soil and have placed\n\non us an enormous responsibility for their upkeep\n\nwhich we have willingly accepted as our humanitarian\n\nand Islamic duty.\n\nnegative response to opportunities fur peace.\n\n80. In the immediate context, it is imperative that\n\nIsrael's withdrawal from Lebanon be secured, that\n\ncivilian life be fully protected and conditions of peace\n\nand normality be restored in that ravaged country.\n\nThe agony of the Palestinian people and the justice\n\nof its cause demand that the international community\n\ntake determined action for the achievement of durable\n\n85. As a country grievously affected by the crisis\n\nin its neighbourhood, Pakistan has: a direct and vital\n\nstake in a peaceful solution of the Afghanistan\n\nproblem. Consistent with the decisions of the United\n\nNations, Pakistan has sincerely co-operated with every\n\ninternational endeavour, including the constructive\n\nefforts of the Secretary-Ge:.eral and his Personal\n\nAnnex 57\n\n280\n\nGeneral Assembly-Thirty-seventh Session-Plenary Meetings\n\nRepl\"esentative on Afghanistan. The Geneva discus­\n\nsions held iil June under the good offices of the\n\nSecretary-General marked an important step in his\n\nefforts for a political settlement. We participated in\n\nthose talks in a positive and constructive spirit and\n\nwe look forward to further progress in the process\n\nof consultations initiated by the Secretary-General\n\nand assure him of our continued co-operation.\n\nregional co-operation aimed at the well-being and\n\nprogress of their peoples; Joint studies have been\n\nundertaken and action programmes have been worked\n\nout to promote co-operation· in important economic\n\nsectors for mutual benefit. The recently held meeting\n\nof the Foreign Secretaries of South Asian countries\n\nin Islamabad was the third in a series of such meet­\n\nings establishing an auspicious tradition of co-oper­\n\nation and understanding among countrie~ of South\n\nAsia which we are committed to strengthen in the\n\nfuture.\n\n86. It remains our ardent hope that the Afghanistan\n\ncrisis will soon be resolved in compliance with the\n\ndecisions of the United Nations with the aim of\n\nstrengthening peace and security in the region, while\n\npreserving respect for the independence, sovereignty\n\nand territorial integrity of each State.\n\n91. Apart from being a geo-political imperative, good­\n\nneighbourly rrlations between Pakistan and India are\n\nessential to the fulfilment of the aspirations and hopes\n\nof millions of people in the two countries to live in\n\npeace and to ensure for themselves and for succeeding\n\ngenerations a life of dignity, well-being and prosperity.\n\n87. The ramifications of the crisis in Afghanistan\n\nand the disturbing security climaf·e in our region\n\nhave deepened our concern for th:.! defence of our\n\nfrontiers. We.~ are seriously endeavouring to tum those\n\nborders into frontiers of permanent peace. But we\n\nhave no control over developments in our neighbour­\n\nhood and cannot turn our eyes away from the imper­\n\native of maintaining an adequate defence establish­\n\nment commensurate with the size of the country and\n\nthe extent of its international frontiers. which stretch\n\nacross more than 5,0fJO kilometres. The strengthening\n\nof Pakistan's defence capability should not be a matter\n\nof concern to any ,,:,ther ccmntry-first~ because any\n\n~mggestion of such concern would have no relation to\n\nreality and. secondly, because those who make it\n\nassume the privilege of passing judgement on vital\n\nmatt11:rs falling exclusively within our sovereign\n\ndomain. We are tied to no bloc or strategic con­\n\nsensus, e.nd our right to have a minimum rlefence\n\ncapability of our own is an expression of out sover­\n\neign status as a non-aligned country.\n\nIn this spirit, Pakistan sincerely desires full normali­\n\nzation of relations with India which can be achieved\n\nwith the resolution of the Jam mu and Kashmir dispute,\n\nthe only outstanding problem between the two\n\ncountries.\n\n92. The Gov'-mment of Pakistan has taken several\n\ninitiatives, including the off~rof a non-aggression pact,\n\nto foster an atmosphere of trust and confidence.\n\nWe are gratified that last January. the Foreign\n\nMinisters of the two countries agreed that the con­\n\nclusion of such a pact would make a positive con­\n\ntribution to peace and stability in the region. We also\n\nwelcomed the suggestion of the Prime Minister of\n\nIndia for the establishment of a joint commission\n\nbetween the two countries. Already an exchange of\n\nviews on the substance of the proposals has been\n\ninitiated which augurs well for the future of Pakistan­\n\nIndia relations, on which the peace and tranquillity of\n\nthe region largely depend.\n\n88. The unfortunate conflict between the Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran aHd Iraq has been a sourcP cf deep\n\nanguish and concern for us. In addition to causing\n\nextensive human and material losses, this was- has\n\naggravated the cHmate of insecurity in a highly\n\nsensitive reg~~n. and its early termination remains\n\nin the best interests of the peoples of the area.

Accordingly,\n\nPakistan supports the right of the people of Kampuchea\n\nto shape their own future free from outside inter­\n\nvention and has joined the international call for the\n\nwithdrawal of foreign troops from that unfortunate\n\nland. Pakistan welcomes the formation of a coalition\n\nauspiceli of the Islamic Conference, ar.d will continue\n\nto make every er,deavour for the solution of this\n\ntragic conflict.\n\nGovernment of Democratic Kampuchea, headed by\n\nPrince Sihanouk and hopes that this Government will\n\nfacilitate the creation of conditions conducive to the\n\nfull implementation of the decisions of the General\n\nAssembly on the Kampuchean question.\n\n89. The convu!sions of our neighbourhood have\n\nmade us keenly aware of the perils of great-Power\n\nrivalry and confrontation to which, in an historic\n\nser'se, the Indian Ocean region has always remained\n\nexposed. Pakistan has consistently supported Sri\n\nLanka·s proposal for the establishment of the lndian\n\nOcean as a zone of peace,, which symboHze~ the\n\nshared aspirations of the pt;ople of the region for\n\nprogress in conditions of peace and security.

The illegal occupation of Namibia and the\n\nabominable system of upurtheid perpetrated against the\n\nblack population of South Africa continue to be an\n\naffront to human morality and values.
