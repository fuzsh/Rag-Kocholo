By using this Website, you signify your acknowledgment and agreement to these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with these Terms and Conditions, DO NOT use this Website (as defined herein).\n\nThese Terms and Conditions govern the use of the Book Of Memories websites (the \"Website\") and other services (collectively the \"Services\").

Company reserves the right to refuse use of the Services to anyone and to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove or suspend any Campaign, Donation, or the Services at any time for any reason without liability.\n\nDefinitions: In these Terms and Conditions \"Campaign Organizers\" means those raising funds, and \"Campaigns\" as their fundraising campaigns. Additionally, \"Donors\" means those contributing funds, and \"Donations\" as the funds they contribute. Campaign Organizers, Donors and other visitors to the Services are referred to collectively as \"Users\". The term \"Campaign Organizers\" shall also be deemed to include any individual(s) designated as a beneficiary of Campaigns.\n\nServices: The Services are offered as a platform (the \"Platform\") to Users of the Services. Among other features, the Services are designed to allow Campaign Organizers to post Campaigns to the Platform to accept Donations from Donors. Although there are no fees to set up Campaigns, a portion of each Donation will be charged as fees for our Services and those of our third party payment processors. Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services with or without notice.

By using the Services, you agree that we may communicate with you regarding Company and other entities by SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device and that certain information about use of the Services may be communicated to us.\n\nCharitable Giving: Campaigns are not charities to which you can make tax-deductible charitable contributions. Any Donation you make through the Platform may be processed by an unaffiliated business partner for which a processing fee (in addition to our FrontRunner Professional Fee) is deducted. You understand, acknowledge and agree that Company is not a charity, and Company does not solicit charitable donations for itself or for any third-party charitable institution.

We disclaim and assume no responsibility to verify whether the Donations are used in accordance with any applicable laws.\n\nYour Registration Obligations: You may be required to register with Company in order to access and use certain features of the Services.

Donors hereby authorize Company to bill Donors' credit cards and payment methods in advance on a periodic basis until Donors terminate periodic payments through the Platform.\n\nFees: Company does not charge Campaign Organizers any upfront fees for Campaigns. Company retains a portion of each Donation contributed to Campaigns in the amount of four percent (4%) (\"FrontRunner Professional Fee\"). A portion of the Donation is payable to our third party payment processors (\"Processing Fee\").

If we change any of the Fees, we will provide notice of the change on the Website or otherwise, at our option, at least fourteen (14) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Services after the change in any of the Fees becomes effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Fees.\n\nIndemnification: You agree to release, indemnify and hold Company and its affiliates and their owners, officers, employees, directors and agents harmless from any from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, rights, claims, causes of action, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Services, any Donation or Campaign, your violation of these Terms and Conditions or your violation of any rights of another.

To the extent you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine\n\nDISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES: YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
