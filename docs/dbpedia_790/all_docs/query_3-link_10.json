        "text": "SPRING VALLEY, Calif. -- The driver of a minivan killed in a head-on collision on Campo Road was identified Saturday as a 50-year-old Spring Valley man.\n\nDavid Norman Reid died when his Dodge Caravan was struck head-on by a Ford Mustang believed to have been going about 80 mph when its 18-year-old driver veered onto the wrong side of the road about 4:20 p.m. Friday, the California Highway Patrol said.\n\nReid's 17-year-old son, a passenger in the minivan and a student at Steele Canyon High School, suffered what CHP Officer Brian Penning called major injuries.\n\nRescuers tried to revive the elder Reid at the scene, but were unable to save him, according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nAuthorities said Andrew Bellatti of La Mesa, a former star pitcher at Steele Canyon High, was at fault in the collision. Pennings said there was no indication that alcohol or drugs contributed to the crash. Bellatti was drafted last year by the Tampa Bay Ray's minor league Gulf Coast team, as a pitcher, according to the team Web site.\n\nThe CHP said Bellatti was driving a red 2007 Mustang west on Campo Road when it crossed onto the wrong side of the road and struck Reid's Caravan. The Caravan ended up on the south side of the road in some bushes. Officers found the wrecked Mustang's speedometer stuck at 80 mph, according to the CHP.\n\nBellatti was taken to a hospital for possible major injuries. His 16- year-old female passenger, identified only as a Steele Canyon High student, also was hospitalized with major injuries.\n\nMore Info\n\nhttp://www.10news.com/news/22319258/detail.html\n\nI wonder how people can drive at such speeds on a wet road. Dont parents teach their children anything. My condolences to the family and the driver of the Mustang. He will have to live with this tragedy for the rest of his life. I just hope others learn, including drivers in this club, that speed is designed for raceways.\n\nMakes me wonder how lived to be this age from the crap I pulled when I was younger"
