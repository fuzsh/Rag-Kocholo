        "text": "Carl Andre, who has died aged 88, was the minimalist sculptor whose infamous “pile of bricks” caused a storm when it was exhibited at the Tate in 1976 and came to stand, in the eyes of some, for everything preposterous about the artistic avant garde.\n\nHe was also the husband of Ana Mendieta, a fiery Cuban-American performance artist, sculptor and painter who fell (or, some claimed, was pushed) to her death in 1985.\n\nThe notorious bricks, or as art buffs know it, Equivalent VIII, consisted of 120 identical cream-coloured fire bricks, arranged in two layers in a rectangle. They were bought by the Tate in 1972, exhibited twice to general indifference, and then made the headlines after featuring in an article in the business section of The Sunday Times about the substantial sums of public money that the gallery was spending on minimalist and conceptualist works of art.\n\nFor a memorable week or two newspapers and politicians competed to pour scorn on the Tate and its curators for spending money (the Tate refused to divulge how much, but the price generally quoted was £4,000) on stuff that could be bought for a few pounds from a builders’ merchant. “I call it a pile of bricks and that’s what it is”, Bernard Levin protested in the Times; “Bricks are not works of art. Bricks are bricks,” Keith Waterhouse insisted in the Daily Mirror.\n\nFew modern works of art before or since generated so much passion – and ribaldry. When, a few days after the bricks went on display, they were vandalised by a visiting chef with a pot of blue dye (to, he claimed, the applause of bystanders), the Tate put them away, prompting more jokes with its announcement that they were now in the care of its restoration department. Jobbing builders offered their own versions, culled from the skip.\n\nWhatever his true opinions on the matter, the Tate’s director Norman Reid stoutly defended his staff; and when the Burlington Magazine added its pennyworth to the chorus of derision, he resigned from its board, though not before arranging for the assistant keeper of the Modern Collection, Richard Morphet, to publish a 5,000-word panegyric in the magazine, which only prompted more hilarity with its claim that the “limpid clarity” of Andre’s works rendered them “positive statements of general relevance to modern society”.\n\nThe battle of the bricks was bitterly fought, though as some critics observed, when Equivalent VIII was originally shown in a New York Gallery in 1966, it was part of a series of eight sculptures, all called Equivalents, numbered I-VIII, each consisting of rectangles of 120 bricks, two bricks deep, but differing in length and width. By displaying only one of the eight the Tate, the argument went, had removed the context of their “equivalence”.\n\nThe Tate was wrong to purchase the bricks, wrote the Telegraph’s Richard Dorment in 1989, “not because Carl Andre is a poor sculptor, but because he has done work that is so much more interesting. The tragedy was that the battle had to be fought over a failure.”\n\nAndre stayed in New York as events unfolded, declining to be interviewed about the furore by the BBC, reasoning that “the temptation to make a fool of myself would have been enormous.” A few months later, he compiled a selection of press cuttings on the affair, setting each one in its own ruled oblong box.\n\n“I think I ought to exhibit my work only in countries where I don’t speak the language,” he joked. “At least then I can’t understand what they’re saying about me.”\n\nCarl Andre was born at Quincy, Massachusetts, on September 16 1935. His father was a marine draughtsman at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy. He was educated at Quincy Public School and the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He did not attend art school, but travelled to England, where he visited Stonehenge and other neolithic monuments with his uncle, the former Spitfire pilot and future Tomorrow’s World presenter Raymond Baxter.\n\nAfter a period in the US army, Andre settled in New York, where he worked as a publisher’s assistant. He became friendly with the young painter Frank Stella, who introduced him to the work of Ezra Pound and, through Pound’s writing, to the sculpture of Brancusi.\n\nHis initial artistic endeavours, carved timber in the style of Brancusi, later described by a friend as “ranging from prodigiously ugly to downright hideous”, met with little success. On one occasion, after an unsuccessful exhibition in 1959, a New York dealer burnt a set of carved wooden pyramids as firewood. Andre also wrote a novel, Billy Builder, which, at 52 pages, was rejected by a publisher as too long.\n\nIn 1960, unable to support himself through his art, Andre started working for the Pennsylvania Railroad as a freight brakeman. His four years on the railway were to be of defining significance in his work. Surrounded by “horizontal lines of steel and rust and great masses of coal, timber and material... and the burdens and weights of the cars themselves”, he experienced almost Wordsworthian feelings for the beauty of materials, recalling that “the wood was better before I cut it than after. I did not improve it in any way.”\n\nThereafter, like the artist James McNeill Whistler, he sought to divest his art of “any outside anecdotal interest”, based on the idea that art does not need any content outside its own form, and in 1964, with minimalist sculpture beginning to interest the art world, Andre returned to New York to sculpt full-time. Money was scarce and he resorted to acquiring most of his materials from building sites and rubbish dumps, or borrowed them for the duration of an exhibition from builders merchants.\n\nTaking his raw materials and arranging them in rectangular and pyramidal formations, he began to play with the idea of sculpture “cutting into” or “redefining” space. His sensitivity to the weight and mass of his materials was heightened when Well (1964), a 7 x 4 x 4 foot hollowed timber construction, had to be rearranged after it threatened to cause the collapse of the floor at the first public exhibition of his work, at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York.\n\nSubsequently he began to experiment with alternative materials, such as Styrofoam and cadmium, but he remained forever fascinated by the heaviness and physicality of the matter he used. His work, he said, was about “matter matters”.\n\nIn the mid-1960s Andre began to develop what he called “low” sculpture after realising, while canoeing, that he wanted his sculpture to be as level as water. From these principles emerged Lever, 137 firebricks laid across the floor of the gallery in a single line; Secant, 100 blocks of timber laid in a line across a park – and the Equivalent series.\n\nBy 1970 the 35-year-old sculptor was so successful in the US that the Guggenheim Museum honoured him with a full retrospective, including selections of his work since 1964 in wood, bricks, acrylic blocks, metal plates, typed word-poems and, as a pièce de résistance, his 37 Pieces of Work, a 36ft square of plates in six metals – aluminium, steel, copper, zinc, lead and magnesium – reflecting, in the artist’s words, his “erotic relationship with materials”.\n\nIn 1979 Andre met a 30-year-old Cuban-born artist named Ana Mendieta, who was having her first one-person show in New York. They embarked on an intense and turbulent affair and married in January 1985.\n\nBut in the early hours of September 8 that year she died after falling from their 34th-floor apartment in Greenwich Village. Just before her death, neighbours had heard the couple arguing violently, and in a subsequent 911 call, Andre was heard saying: “My wife is an artist, and I’m an artist, and we had a quarrel about the fact that I was more, eh, exposed to the public than she was. And she went to the bedroom, and I went after her, and she went out the window.”\n\nCharged with second-degree murder and accused of pushing his wife out of the window while under the influence of alcohol, Andre was held on bail for two days in the notorious Rikers Island jail, the judge having refused $500,000 in works of art as security. There followed three years of legal proceedings before Andre was acquitted in February 1988 in a non-jury trial.\n\nThe acquittal, however, caused an uproar. Ana Mendieta’s family and many of her friends in the art community and the feminist movement continued to believe that he was responsible for her death, with the result that galleries exhibiting his works risked being disrupted by protests from Mendieta’s supporters.\n\nWhen the Guggenheim Museum put an Andre sculpture in a show at its SoHo branch in 1992, the opening was picketed by 500 angry protesters. Three years later, the feminist artist protest group Guerrilla Girls issued a poster calling Andre “the O J of the art world”.\n\nAndre, a shaggy-looking character with thick bushy beard and sideburns, had always been a somewhat withdrawn, sensitive figure. After Ana’s death he became increasingly eccentric and reclusive, refusing to be photographed.\n\nHe continued to exhibit, primarily in the US and Europe, though for those who found minimalism mystifying there were few clues given. An exhibition catalogue in Germany noted that a row of steel plates laid out across the floor “gives a name to something that would not be in the world were it not for the artist”.\n\nIn Britain, the response of the former Liberal MP David Alton to a 1989 exhibition of Equivalent VIII at the Tate Gallery Liverpool (“spurious elitism of the worst kind”) showed that Andre’s most famous work had lost none of its power to outrage.\n\nThe Tate always defended its purchase of the bricks as a worthwhile investment – as indeed, it proved to be. In 2019, another of his works, Copper-Steel Alloy Square from 1969, sold at Christie’s in London for £2,411,250.\n\nIt was not until 1996, when he had a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, that his work was available for reappraisal. A successful show, it included the Equivalent series in its entirety, several critics finding a grandeur to Andre’s work and a stillness that rewarded contemplation.\n\nAna Mendieta was Andre’s third wife. According to a Washington Post interview with Robert Katz, author of Naked by the Window: The Fatal Marriage of Carl Andre and Ana Mendieta (1990), Andre’s first wife “vanished without even leaving her name”. From 1964 to 1970 he was married to the painter Rosemarie Castoro. The marriage ended in divorce.\n\nCarl Andre is survived by his fourth wife, the artist Melissa Kretschmer.\n\nCarl Andre, born September 16 1935, died January 24 2024"
