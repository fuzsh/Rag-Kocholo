Tsk, when are these national selectors going to get it into their heads to let us know if they're planning a surprise call-up? --Dweller (talk)\n\nJust did a quick and dirty c-e of Jack Ryder and noticed he didn't have a Cat as a selector. When I couldn't find it using Hot Cat, I looked at Bradman's article... to see he doesn't have one either. Does it not exist (yet)? --Dweller (talk)\n\nNo, lots of FAs/GAs would have it but it doesn't exist, eg Lindwall, Davidson, Loxton, Harvey etc. I think \"Cricket selectors of/for Australia\" would be the right wording so people know they aren;t just Australians who were selectors but those who selected the national team YellowMonkey (bananabucket) (Invincibles finally at Featured topic candidates)\n\nHow about Category:Australia national cricket selectors or Category:Australia national cricket team selectors? – PeeJay\n\nI'd go for the latter, personally. Do we have similar Cats for other nations? They should align. We should also consider the rest of the Cat structure upwards... --Dweller (talk)\n\nAre we confident any proposed category will survive the \"process\" at CfD? -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nIt should, I think we need it for other teams too. Might be good to set up the convention and create cats for all teams. PeeJay's suggestion of Category:XXX national cricket team selectors seems reasonable and could be used for all teams (perhaps not Zimbabwe and Bangladesh yet, and without national for England and WI). -SpacemanSpiff\n\nI vaguely recall the [boring] details, but I think we've run foul of the Cats guys before and suggest we come up with a proposed structure and run it past them before we implement it... --Dweller (talk)\n\nIt should, because most of hte ones that were being deleted were becuase the cat was allegedly too small, not because the linkage was deemed to be insignificant for anthing. And in any case, the main CfD policeman might be a reincarnation of a banned user, allegedly YellowMonkey (bananabucket) (Invincibles finally at Featured topic candidates)\n\nOn another note, this is for permanent selectors right, not the on-tour ones in the old days where the three most senior players voted? YellowMonkey (bananabucket) (Invincibles finally at Featured topic candidates)\n\nSpeaking of categories, the Aussie ODI cricketer cats have just been renamed. I wasn't aware of this discussion before, but it's now different from the rest of our team-player cats. -SpacemanSpiff\n\nAnd now, apparently everything is being renamed -- Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 December 16#ODI cricketers. -SpacemanSpiff\n\nTo be honest, I think it's a good call to expand ODI in the categories. We always write One Day International in the first instance in an article, so in the categories it looks a bit more professional. SGGH ping!\n\nI don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, but we often use ODI in article titles. Other than that, I just think these inordinately long category names are a bit of a distraction. -SpacemanSpiff\n\nI propose to just go ahead and create Category:Australia national cricket team selectors YellowMonkey (bananabucket) (Invincibles finally at Featured topic candidates)\n\nGood job Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nCategory:Cricket selectors already existed and a lot of the recent Indian ones are in there YellowMonkey (bananabucket) (Invincibles finally at Featured topic candidates)\n\nIndian selectors have been moved under Category:India national cricket team selectors. -SpacemanSpiff\n\nI've just had a look at Gavin Tonge, the newest Windies Test player. There was a rather strange stats issue (i.e. the stats on the page weren't his), which I believe I've fixed (can someone please check?). I'm a little concerned, however, by the wording of the (short) entry, which seems a little too close to the Cricinfo blurb at [1] (particularly the second sentence of the wiki article). Can anyone help reword and maybe expand? I've not really got any knowledge of the subject, so can't really do too much with it unfortunately. Cheers. — AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nI've re-written the suspect parts. SGGH ping!\n\nI've fixed the stats issue - Sambot was updating it but had a link to Devon Thomas's profile by mistake.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nSpeaking of Bradman and cricket selectors. What should be the naming convention for members of governing board members. Category:Cricket Australia board members? But for bodies with \"Board\" in them explicitly, we would just say Category:Board of Control for Cricket in India members....?? Or \"Members of???\" YellowMonkey (bananabucket) (Invincibles finally at Featured topic candidates)\n\nI believe the naming convention is Category:Members of XYZ now. -SpacemanSpiff\n\nI have written a lead for this, and if I don't mind saying so, I don't think it's too awful! :) SGGH ping!\n\nOnly a bit awful ;) Now need citations to get rid of that ghastly template up the top. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nI couldn't find an article to link 'wind ball' to. I know what a wind ball is, but perhaps it is called something else in the wider world? SGGH ping!\n\nI don't know what a wind ball is. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nMust be an English term but I am guessing it is this\n\nIs this list necessary? It seems to duplicate information in List of England Test cricketers. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nCompletely redundant. Redirect to List of England Test cricketers. SGGH ping!\n\nIt is redundant, but List of England Test cricketers should explain the cap number system somewhere. Also I'd like to see a sortable table, but it doesn't work when spilt in to time spans.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nA sortable table with 600+ rows would probably crash some browsers, but that may just be my crappy computer! Nev1 (talk)\n\nCan an administrator please block Sambot, it appears to be malfunctioning. See here and here. I have left a meesage on the bot talk page and on Sam's page. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nIs blocked. Sam Korn isn't active currently, so you will either want to maintain the stats manually from now on, or ask someone at WP:BOTREQ to take over the task. It'd probably an easy fix to get it working again, but the source doesn't appear to be public. Amalthea\n\nAll those stats manually ... gotta be joking. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nI've mentioned this elsewhere but I wondered if CA's recent update might be causing the problem?JP (talk)\n\nIt could be. I've dropped Sam an email.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nI can't make sense of this. This article says four venues will be used - Barbados, Guyana, St Kitts and St Lucia - however in the fixture there is no mentions of St Kitts. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nArgh.. going by this, St Kitts will host women's matches. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nPunterdesilva (talk · contribs) and his up keep adding quotes about Brian Lara. See history. Rambling man reverted first and I've now used up all my reverts. In good faith I think but not necessary. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nOn the users IP he made this worrying edit. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nDon't worry... dealing with it. If it goes on, let me know. The Rambling Man (talk)\n\nAre scorecards of each match played necessary? I think not, was going deleted by a new editor was updating one and I thought I'd get reverted. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nNah, it will get ridiculous when more matches are played there, and precedent articles don't do it either. SGGH ping!\n\nAt least I've got some backup if I get reverted! :) Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nZuner Ahmed (talk · contribs) added nicknames to Inzi and Younis Khan's arts. At first I thought it was vandlaism but ... possibly not. Anyone with a clearer picture? Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nIn a rush of enthusiasm I created the above category (Are editors still allowed to be so bold, or do we need to fill in forms in triplicate first nowadays ...) Anyway in my enthusiasm, I have probably neglected something or someone that belongs in the category. If so, I would appreciate your assistance in populating the new category. You may even have a better sugggestion for the blurb at the head of the category. Cheers and to the English here, well done to your boys overnight in SA. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nIn my non-expert opnion, it seems like a valid category. However for editors of the Almanack, who already have the category \"Editors of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", I don't think you need the category \"Wisden\" as well, as the former is a sub-category of the latter. (You've added the \"Wisden\" category for Sydney Pardon, though not for the other editors whose articles I glanced at.) JH (talk page)\n\nIMHO, Cat:Editors of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack should be a sub cat of Cat:Wisden. I'm also pondering whether Cat:Wisden should be moved to Cat:Wisden Cricketers' Almanack... thoughts? --Dweller (talk)\n\nCat:Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was my first thought but on reflection, the Wisden group is much wider than the Almanack nowadays. I added Pardon (and John Wisden) to the parent cat as they appeared, to my antipodean eyes at least, more fundamental to the \"Wisden\" brand (for lack of a better word) than the other people attached to the subcats. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nI came across List of non-Indian Hindu cricketers today. Quite honestly I can't think of one reason this is a valid list, but I'd like to get some other opinions... cheers. -SpacemanSpiff\n\nSilly.. Aaroncrick (talk) Review me!\n\nAgree. It wouldn't have lasted 2 days as a category. AFD'd. The-Pope (talk)\n\nIt isn't, but some people like doing these things, usually BJP supporters. Also, simply not having a Muslim or Sikh name, or a European style Christian name, doesn't necessarily mean the person is still Hindu; they could have just gone atheist. Apart from the fact it is irrelevant YellowMonkey (bananabucket) (Invincibles finally at Featured topic candidates)\n\nAn old issue of Cricketer's Who's Who that I have at home lists Symonds as a Norwich City fan. The book postdates his plumping for Australia over England. I can't, for the life of me, work out what his connection to NCFC would be. Two thoughts - a) it's an error b) [creatively] City play in yellow and green, pretty similar colours to Aussie ODI pyjamas. Anyone? --Dweller (talk)\n\nCould be in error, but I thought the Who's Who bios were written by the players themselves? Can't imagine Symonds putting the wrong club down...\n\nIt could just be that he picked a random club; I mean one of my friends supports Colchester United F.C. despite not living anywhere near there, and when asked why he supports them shrugs his shoulders and says \"I don't know\"! Could there be a family link to Norwich somewhere...? — AMBerry (talk)\n\nWhen asked, this soccer agnostic lists Notts Forest as my favourite club because my grandfather supported them and I think his reason for supporting them is vague as well. --Roisterer (talk)\n\nThere's now a debate abotu whether to split the topic.... YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nhonestly can't be bothered reading it all. Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nThey put up a straight vote YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nRead a couple of hours ago, don't care anyhow ... nuff garbage from me, what do others on here think? Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nI think we should make a concerted effort to stop this vote which is completely out of order and is an attempt by about two people to get their own way. Consensus has already been established as support for the whole topic to be featured. Mattinbgn and myself have had our say about this. Anyone else? ----Jack | talk page\n\nI've just suggested the flag be removed, it's fairly obvious it's Australia. SGGH ping!\n\nAlso Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Third Test, 1948 Ashes series/archive1 is getting no traffic YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nAll Durham first-class cricketers are done and dusted! Four teams down, fourteen to go! Bobo.\n\nWell done! JH (talk page)\n\nOur friends at CfD have been busy again - my Watchlist has gone beserk with all the changes to the ODI Categories. I'm not sure I disagree with the changes, but I find it extraordinary that we didn't participate in the discussions. Best would have been a note from the nom, but did none of us spot the discussions? --Dweller (talk)\n\nAre you really that surprised? CfD is a world of their own, that us mere mortals only find out about when our watchlists go crazy AFTER they decide what's best for us. I mean I thought that ODI cricketers referred to insects from the Overseas Development Institute.The-Pope (talk)\n\nErm... I believe it was discussed on this talk page... wasn't it? SGGH ping!\n\nIt was mentioned at \"Ozzie selectors\" above, though I suppose it wasn't truly discussed. SGGH ping!\n\nMissed that. I stopped following that subsection once it was largely dealt with. I guess then it's our fault for not putting it in its own section/my fault for not following this page closely enough. --Dweller (talk)\n\nI hope that everyone is having / has had a great day. JH (talk page)\n\nDitto, watching The Hogfather. SGGH ping!\n\nYes, same here. Some new books to read. By the way, shouldn't we be having a \"straw poll\" about this to decide if we should split the topic between those who have had a good day and those are are still having one? :-) ----Jack | talk page\n\nI'll !vote for still having one!—MDCollins (talk)\n\nI believe both Marcus Trescothick and Alastair Cook have birthdays today? SGGH ping!\n\nJust finished having a great day, thank you, JH! And let's not overlook Boxing Day, the birthday of Norman Reid, Rohan Kanhai, Mark Lathwell, and Iqbal Siddiqui. Bobo.\n\nRecently created this list, but a couple of IP users have commented they don't think it should exist as it's not notable enough etc. I believe it is a notable list as he has scored (I'm pretty certain) the second most international centuries by an England player, and as his page is already pretty long, I think it is better suited to it's own list rather than as a section on his page. I am thinking of listing it at FLC, but due to these comments, and generally, wondered if I could get some feedback from those here first, rather than start flaying a dead donkey! Harrias (talk)\n\nDon't see a problem at all with the list. The content is not included in the main article and, as long as you have a justifiably large content to warrant a content fork (this is close, but I think it'll pass the test) then no problems. Good luck. The Rambling Man (talk)\n\nHave initiated the nomination for Featured List status: Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/List of international cricket centuries by Marcus Trescothick/archive1 Harrias (talk)\n\nWant to move these two towards FAC, thoughts? SGGH ping!\n\nThe Boycs article has been mentioned on these pages on several occasions. IIRC, it's usually been felt that the lack of photos of the man (or his mother, who could apparently play cricket adequately with a stick of rhubarb) was a severe flaw. I'm not sure that's the case, especially as it does not come into WP:WIAFA. Incidentally, if you can cite it, a comment about Boycs eccentric references to his mum would be a fun addition. --Dweller (talk)\n\nI see we have an uncited comment about his mother's pinny. Today he accused KP, memorably, as having less brains than \"a chocolate mouse\". I've never seen a chocolate mouse, clever or stupid. --Dweller (talk)\n\n\"He couldn't bowl marr granny, let alone marr moom!\" YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nMichael Carberry. Help gladly received. --Dweller (talk)\n\nDon't like the word \"crummy\". It's not a great article, but it's no worse than a lot of our articles on less prominent players, even Test players. I think it's probably fairer to say that a lot of our distinguished cricket contributors have made changes to this in passing, but it hasn't been a top priority with anyone... until now. Johnlp (talk)\n\nOK, you're right. Apologies. --Dweller (talk)\n\nThe problem with these crummy articles are the fact that they all appear to be articles I've created. •grin• It goes without saying that y'all should probably go through my early articles and expand as much as possible - if they haven't been already. Bobo.\n\nWe've all got articles from the past that we wouldn't write in quite the same way now. That's the good thing about this place: there's always scope for improvement, and sometimes self-improvement. Johnlp (talk)\n\nWhich young fast bowler with currently no international recognition, will England's selectors call up in the next year to 18 months? I reckon there will be one... just not sure who. --Dweller (talk)\n\nSchrek! Or the other guy... er... begins with W... SGGH ping!\n\nWoakes. SGGH ping!\n\nYou think Carberry is bad, for a guy that has played 26 Test cricket, Paul Harris has a dreadful article! Harrias (talk)\n\nI agree with Johnlp when he says \"we've all got articles from the past that we wouldn't write in quite the same way now\". Some of mine are embarrassing and I'm slowly trying to bring them up to scratch. ----Jack | talk page\n\nAnd, who knows, by the end of the year England might be top of the pile again for the first time since Illy was captain. ----Jack | talk page\n\nThey might, if India and South Africa flame out, which might happen YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nStill in need of reviews YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nI want to know what is the status about adding the flag of Irish cricket team to articles such as international cricket seasons? Just prodding the issue. Rakuten06 (talk)\n\nObviously the Republic of Ireland flag shouldn't be used. The Ireland cricket team flag is a copyright free image, but despite that keeps getting deleted for copyright infringement. So you can add it, but someone is bound to remove it. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nFour articles have been nominated for deletion in the above AfD: Wang Lei (Chinese cricketer), Khalid Butt, Ashraf Mughal, and Chetan Suryawanshi.Nev1 (talk)\n\nI think you need to be made aware that there are several categories of matches that the ICC regards as official internationals outside of Tests, ODIs and T20Is. These include, but are not limited to, WCL Divisions 2-8 (1 is obvious as the matches are ODIs), all ICC Trophy/World Cup Qualifier matches, all divisions of the European Championship, Americas Championship and ACC Trophy (except some matches in the 1996 tournament) and some regional events in the Africa and EAP region. Several other events (such as the ACC Twenty20 Cup) and one-off series also have official status. I am currently working on a full statistical database of all these internationals for CricketEurope that I hope will be a good source for clearing up these misunderstandings. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nKhalid Butt definitely meets the WP:CRIN guidelines - the others, I'm not so sure... Hack (talk)\n\nHmmm, China were bowled out for 27 by the UAE, but only 12 of the runs were by batsmen. There were 13 wides! YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nIf China end up in the same group as Pak or SL at the 2010 Asian Games I wonder if Gul and Malinga could take 7/1 or something YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nIn 1979, I believe, Crazy had a humorous calypso about a guy who left China and came to Trinidad to learn about cricket, which he had heard about thanks to Kerry Packer. The rest of the song is built around word plays around terms like \"third man\" and \"night watchman\". Had no idea China was playing first class cricket. How much things can change in 30 years... Guettarda (talk)\n\nChina aren't playing first-class cricket, but they are playing official internationals. I don't see what the quality of the team has to do with whether the players are notable or not. This project would consider the players whose only first-class game was for Dera Ismail Khan in their only first-class game - an innings and 851 run defeat - to be notable. The way in which this project would defend to the hilt the notability of someone who played one first-class game for, say, Gentlemen of the South against Players of the South in 1878 but would question the notability of a genuine international cricketer is ridiculous and is the main reason why I've stopped bothering to contribute much to Wikipedia these days. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nOh, I see. Should have read the AFD before I commented. Guettarda (talk)\n\nThis has been promoted to be a Featured Topic. Many congratulations to all involved, and especially to User:YellowMonkey whose drive and attention to detail have been inspiring. Johnlp (talk)\n\nYellowMonkey certainly holds the Wikipedia rating of 99.94! SGGH ping!\n\nSuch a shame we all gave him three cheers and he had a tear in his eye. --Dweller (talk)\n\nThanks everyone for making this possible, we still need 5 more to pass before May I think it was when the criteria changes to a majority being FA else it will get demoted to GT YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nStirling job. Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nOn 6th January, Cricinfo had an obituary on cricketer John Lyon; as he was a Lancashire lad I thought I'd check out the article and update it a bit. I found that Nick mallory (talk · contribs) had created the article that day. The content of the article had been taken from the Cricinfo website with only a word changed here or there. I've stripped the article back so it's no longer a breach of copyright, but when I explained the situation to Nick I was concerned by the reply.\n\nIt looks like he's unconcerned about the problems. I don't think this laissez-faire attitude helps the project, and copyright violations actually harm Wikipedia. I've not really interacted with Nick mallory before, but his response doesn't indicate to me that he intends to change his habits, and that this may be a problem for other articles he's contributed to. Partly this message is to make sure that project members are aware that Nick's edits may be problematic, but I also wonder if anyone else has had similar experiences with him and if this is a recurring problem. Nev1 (talk)\n\nLooking at the second to most recent new cricketer article, I would say he doesn't have article writing quite down yet, given the stylistic issues. This is a surprise given that I have heard his name around here for a while now. I would suggest monitoring - I think your response was very suitable and hopefully he takes heed - and step up warnings/suggestions regarding copyright violation if such things happen in the future. Despite WP:DTTR which you have agreed with thus far, no one is above copyright laws. SGGH ping!\n\nNick has done sterling and valuable work over many years, especially on ensuring that all Yorkshire CCC cricketers have an article. I think (without presuming to speak for him) that his concern is usually to see to it that we have an article of sorts on everyone relevant, and then he tends to leave it to others to fill it out with more detail and colour. That's a useful thing to do, and I for one would be sad if we were to discourage him from doing this by over-reacting to what is probably an isolated incident. Johnlp (talk)\n\nI suggest you check the difference between the article Nick \"wrote\" and Cricinfo's profile of Lyon. Having an article that is copied from another source is not only not useful to Wikipedia, it brings the project into disrepute. As I said on my talk page in response to Nick's uninterested attitude, anyone can slip up and there's nothing wrong with mistakes or not understanding copyright and plagiarism as long as you take responsibility for your mistakes and try to correct them. This isn't an overreaction: I've not called for a block or any other sanction and I came here to find out if this is an isolated incident. Nev1 (talk)\n\nI'm not condoning plagiarism or copyright infringement. But my view is that bringing this here as an issue as one might do if this was a maverick newbie is an over-reaction. If you look at the contributions to this project discussion page as an example, you'll see Nick is the 16th most prolific contributor here: he isn't some newcomer who needs to be watched, he is one of our more engaged contributors. And if his response to you was a bit scratchy, then deal with it on his talk page or yours, with a bit more WP:AGF on either side. Johnlp (talk)\n\nFor someone who's been editing since 2005 and has nearly 10,000 edits I expected more familiarity with copyright issues and plagiarism from Nick. I raised the matter on talk pages and brought it here after receiving no response. Nev1 (talk)\n\nI agree that an experienced user violating copyright is a serious matter, however as I said above I feel that Nev has dealt with the matter fair, assuming there is no further issues. SGGH ping!\n\nHas he retired? Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nThe flamboyant tone on many of the olden day English greats like Hedley Verity, the old Hammond version, and Hutton and some others were the things that concerned me a bit more, but since these guys were obvious greats and I didn't know how to flatten them out without any knowledge of the specifics I hadn't done anything yet YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nI tell you what, 2010 is starting with some startling Test matches. I can hardly believe what's happening in Cape Town. And I still can't work out how Pak lost that Test. --Dweller (talk)\n\nThat was too close. Onions is becoming a specialist rearguard batsman. Nev1 (talk)\n\nIf England had him and Monty in the same team, they'd never lose a Test match again. <Ahem> --Dweller (talk)\n\nBut they might not win too many either. ;) Johnlp (talk)\n\nThey said the next game would be rained out. So England might win and RSA's rankings drops a lot. The predictor also claims that India will go from 124 to 131 if they beat Bangladesh, which seems dubious unless some bad results from 2006 are expiring from the calculations YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nSilly that India's rankings will climb so much. India lost to Pakistan 1-0 I think in early 2006 and narrowly defeated the West Indies (Away) later in the year. They preceded to loose to South Africa (2-1) in 06/07, after winning the First Test (I think, because a lot was made of Tendulkar's struggle against Harris in the Second and Third Tests). Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nAlso, India only drew 1-1 at home to England in 2006. 2006 was a pretty average year for them. And then they only beat Bangladesh 1-0 in early 2007, which would be counted as subpar by the machine YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nOh that's right. Sections of the Bombay crowd booed Tendulkar when he was out. Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nWorrying... a current international player without an article? SGGH ping!\n\nI've noticed that Sri Lanka doesn't get much coverage, and a lot of their articles are lacking, or completely non-existent. It doesn't help that one more than one occasion, articles get created under alternative names, and we end up with two for a player, with slight variations of spelling/names etc. Unfortunately, there isn't the time in the day for me to put work into all these holes! I wonder if I can convince someone to pay me to just sit and edit Wikipedia? Anyone? Harrias (talk)\n\nI noticed the Wayamba cricket team article had the name incorrectly spelt. I have created a category for players of this team and started to populate it. SGGH ping!\n\nI've also created a (very short) stub for Lahiru Thirimanne, while Muthumudalige Pushpakumara is still lacking a page despite having played ODI and T20I cricket. Harrias (talk)\n\nCreated another very short stub for Pushpakumara, and have populated categories for Basnahira North and Basnahira South teams. Harrias (talk)\n\nJust had a quick look through, and a number of our featured lists are looking precarious. I haven't listed any of them for removal, but some of them easily could be if we don't put some work in.\n\nList of Australia Twenty20 International cricketers\n\nThis article requires updating to reflect recent matches. I've just realised that the edits I reverted for being unsourced, poorly written and dreadfully spelt did in fact update the paragraph about captaincy to include the change from Ponting to Clarke, but irrespective, it would need writing far better to remain a FL, so I'm not feeling too guilty about reverting it.\n\nList of Scotland ODI cricketers\n\nAgain, this article requires updating to reflect recent matches.\n\nDone. Nev1 (talk)\n\nList of Test cricket triple centuries\n\nThis article lacks inline citations, which seems it's only major flaw, although I haven't looked through it in any great detail.\n\nI've sprinkled some. There is a bit of POV/tone issues in the notes. SGGH ping!\n\nList of One Day International cricket records\n\nNot sure about this one, but I was surprised by how short the lead was. It might be alright as it is, but it would definitely be a much better article with a much more significant lead.\n\nList of Test cricket hat-tricks\n\nAgain, lacks inline citations, and although 'as of 8 March 2008' does include the most recent hat-trick, it makes it seem as though the article is out of date.\n\nHarrias (talk)\n\nSome of the FAs at the top of the list are as well. The WI in 1988 has lots of unsourced paragraphs and is not so detailed, and the CWC one is quite skinny. Aside from that the CWC hardly bothers with any hardcore history books either per the research criteria, and misses some of the hardball admin politics. And the comtemporary player FAs are always in need of updates. Bodyline and Tiger still need expanding with some of the political controversies, in my opinion anyway, although if we decided to be slack, an outsider wouldn't know of the content-related faults and we could just be lazy, but we shouldn't YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nHave you dropped TRM a line? He's hot on FL. --Dweller (talk)\n\nAbout their calls for an Australian cricket ban. I expected better of the ABC than to say that Shiv Sena were responsible for not allowing Pakistani cricketers into India, which is nonsense. Also rather silly that CA officials haven't heard of these people when they once dug up a cricket pitch [2] YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nA user has questioned the use of hand drawn images on the article. At the moment they are in place because there are no alternatives - no images can be found despite extensive searches online for those with suitable licence and requests to flickr users to release photographs. I'm of the opinion that an illustration is better than nothing, until a real photo can be found. User:ukexpat believes they detract from the article and that no photos are better than illustrating ones, particularly given that they aren't professional drawings and are just what Wikipedia users can come up with.\n\nI can recall other articles where illustrations have been used in lieu of photographs and is has been (albeit grudgingly) accepted. User:ukexpat recalls a previous debate where consensus dictated that they weren't acceptable. While he/she looks for a link for such discussion, perhaps we could simply start a new one here? SGGH ping!\n\nCan't help with previous examples, but it seems daft to argue that an absence of images is better than use of illustrations. --Dweller (talk)\n\nWhy? If the illustration is poor (and I think these are, no disrespect to the artist), they are of little or no encyclopedic value, IMO and could, arguably, be a BLP violation. – ukexpat (talk)\n\nHe's recognisible from them, so they have encyclopedic value. Your personal POV about the quality of the image is neither here nor there. That said, I'm interested to learn more about how they can breach BLP - please explain. If they breach BLP they should be speedied, not merely removed from the biog. --Dweller (talk)\n\nWell we have a subjectivity issue here - I don't think that he is recognisable from them so as far as I am concerned they are of little encyclopedic value, you obviously don't share that view - so we have differing POVs here. As for the BLP issue, a badly drawn image (again, subjective) is in my view just as bad an uncited controversial comment. If I were Boycott looking at those images, I would be insulted... but then maybe that would spur me into providing one with an appropriate license. I don't want to make a big issue out of this, there are more important things to deal with, but I do think we need a wider consensus on this issue generally. – ukexpat (talk)\n\nThank you, you have summarised my points accurately. I think, however, that this is a wider issue than just this article. The recent discussion referred to (that I am still trying to find) related to the use of hand-drawn images in BLP articles generally, not just this one or other cricketer bios. And I am a \"he\"! – ukexpat (talk)\n\nI wouldn't want to offend by saying he/she only to find you were a she/he! :) WP:BLP did not occur to me I do admit. Perhaps a link to this discussion from the BLP talk page? I'll go add one. SGGH ping!\n\nBLP has the following content which I think may be relevant: \"Neutral point of view (NPOV), Verifiability. No original research.\" IMO, the images are NPOV because they do not portray the subject in any condition where any conclusions could be drawn which potentially violate BLP; they are verifiable in the sense that it is what they look like, and that can be checked in non-Wikipedia sources; in terms of original research, as a mug shot and a shot of batting they aren't researching any facts that aren't out there already (how he looks, and that he plays cricket). Thoughts? SGGH ping!\n\nBut on the other hand they do portray the subject from the artist's point of view, much more so than a photographic image. – ukexpat (talk)\n\nIs there someone in Cape Town who could corner the man and take a happy snap? Johnlp (talk)\n\nWe do live in hope. He's not exactly camera-shy. Meantime, I'm unconvinced by arguments that they're covered by BLP. And as the arguments regarding the relative artistic merit are entirely subjective, they should remain in the article. --Dweller (talk)\n\nWhy don't we just e-mail the TMS team and ask them to take one and donate it. Let me try that. – ukexpat (talk)\n\nE-mail sent, fingers crossed! – ukexpat (talk)\n\nDon't forget that \"licensed for use on Wikipedia\" isn't enough, it has to be under creative commons or public domain or the like. SGGH ping!\n\nI've asked many times but unfortunately none of us appear to be lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. I used to think our best bet was to request the release of a flickr photo by its uploader, but no luck so far. SGGH ping!\n\nMy own opinion is that the picture in the infobox looks (to my eyes) a pretty good depiction of Boycott, and shouldn't be problematic. The image lower down, I'm not so sure about. Although probably not intended as such, it looks more like a caricature, and I'm unsure how much that adds to the article? Harrias (talk)\n\nIt was used first before anyone ever really considered asking the artist to draw the second image. It has just remained there since then, and when new images arrive it will probably go. SGGH ping!\n\nthis is a related discussion which concluded that the images were unsuitable. SGGH ping!\n\nThat's a very confusing discussion, but the main gist of it is about drawings rendered from copyright photos therefore not being fair use. Were either of these drawings created from photos? They'd needn't necessarily have been, but they might. --Dweller (talk)\n\nI think the may have been based on a series of photos to get the likeness, but I'm not sure. If they were they might have to go, I shall ask. SGGH ping!\n\nA single drawing based on a number of photos may be sufficiently distant to satisfy fair use criteria. --Dweller (talk)\n\nAt least this sketched picture draws national coverage! BBC Text commentary, Fourth Test, Day 3, 13.59:\n\n\"That pencil sketch of Boycott on his Wikipedia page looks like a rubber Boycott mask you might buy in a cricket-themed joke shop. If you were going to conduct an armed robbery, what cricketing mask would you don?\" (Ben Dirs)\n\n—MDCollins (talk)\n\nOn the day before his birthday, at the moment YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nJust saw that, and thought the date was strange. I suspect it is a coincidence. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nThat's smashing. Worth dropping Raul a line? It may be changeable... --Dweller (talk)\n\nIt was coincidence. Jan 19 was already booked for some others. Now on Jan 23 YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nAny reason why his infobox and CricketArchive profile have a birthday of 5 June?—MDCollins (talk) 23:50, 17 January 2010 (UTC) It passed FAC with this error too. Oops.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nIn another bit of coincidence, I drove down Sid Barnes Crescent in Canberra yesterday. --Roisterer (talk)\n\nIs it sunny today? SGGH ping!\n\nThere was considerable confusion about Barnes' birth date and place of birth (mainly as a result of Barnes' own obfuscation). His birth date was discussed at length Smith (1999). I could have sworn we had some lengthy discussions about the date on the article talk page as well but I can't find them. Perhaps the discussions were on this page. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nOf course that does not excuse the error of two different dates in the article and infobox. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nIf we have RS for both, it's not really our place to decide between them. I think the infobox should read \"disputed\" and the dispute should be briefly dealt with in the section that deals with his early life. --Dweller (talk)\n\nSmith's biography of Barnes is quite clear - Barnes was born on 5 June 1916 in Annandale, New South Wales. This agrees with the date given by CricketArchive and Cricinfo. Not sure at all where 19 January comes from at all, it is unsourced in the article. Note 3 in the article gives some explanation of the discrepancy in place and in year (but not specific date); Smith speculates that Barnes tried to pinch a few years after the war. I don't believe the body of the article is the place for a detailed discussion of various discrepancies; the overwhelming preponderance of reliable sources gives the birth date and place and this is what we should use. The discrepancies can be discussed in the notes. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nThen we should ditch the unsourced date. A trawl through the article history might reveal where it came from. Might have been me! lol --Dweller (talk)\n\nWe could always wait 6 more years for it to appear under the family history records section of the NSW registry of births!\n\nAnd just to chuck another date into the pot... his military service record has 5 June 1917!The-Pope (talk)\n\nI've just checked in Wisden, and it too has 5th June, 1916. JH (talk page)\n\nMattinbgn made the mistake when he rewrote the lead and then later corrected the year only. I wonder who was actually born on that day? Everyone else just missed it. I've corrected it now. The-Pope (talk)\n\nBugger! That was careless. Good find -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nUp and running courtesy of Sarastro1 (talk · contribs) YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nThis may seem like a bit of a silly question but I know little about these things. I'm sure there's a certain time limit copyright on pictures runs for until it expires and I came across a nostalgia postcard which features Herbert Sutcliffe and Jack Hobbs walking out to the pitch in September 1931 for the Scarborough Cricket Festival. However the publishing mark notes the date MXMXC (1990) so I'm guessing this wouldn't be allowed to be uploaded on Wikipedia? I just thought I'd ask on the offchance that it would be, I'm not bothered but it's a good close frontal shot and thought it may be of some help. Tony2Times (talk)\n\nIsn't it 70 years from date of death of originator (ie, the photographer whose copyright it is)?

This editor review FAC articles for PD images. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nCan't a photo of them in Australia in 1928-29 be found? YellowMonkey (bananabucket!)\n\nThis is a little tricky. WP:COMMONNAME means the article should definitely be Mike Smith, IMHO. We already have a Mike Smith (cricketer) who'd fufil WP:PRIME for sure. Should this one be [[Mike Smith (xxxx cricketer)? If so, what added disambiguator? --Dweller (talk)\n\nI'd say Mike Smith (cricketer, born 1967). Harrias (talk)\n\nThough looking at it, I wouldn't necessarily agree with your assessment per WP:PRIME, I wouldn't say either is particularly more likely than the other to be looked up? Harrias (talk)\n\nMy mistake. I was thinking of M. J. K. Smith which just adds to the complexities of Mike Smiths. --Dweller (talk)\n\nI don't feel particularly strongly about it, but I'd prefer Mike Smith (Gloucestershire cricketer), on the grounds that the county he played for is more useful helpful than his year of birth in telling me which Mike Smith the article is about. And I see that form is already in use as a redirector. JH (talk page)\n\nI like the counties better than the birth year in principle, especially where there is clarity about which teams people played for and where the cricketers are relatively well-known. But now that players turn out for umpteen different counties in the course of a career, it gets a bit cumbersome (see the various David Smiths/Al(l)an Joneses for examples). I notice with soccer players, where there seem to be a lot more people with the same names, or maybe just a lot more people, the birth year tends to be used and think there may be some MOS directive about this somewhere; footballers obviously move around from club to club more than cricketers have been wont to... until recently. Johnlp (talk)\n\nAre these really necessary? I feel a brief summary is more appropriate in most cases, as MOM/century tables and further jargon just lengthen the article and look particularly unsightly on FA/GAs. Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nI'd say they can be over the top for modern players, as the team by team breakdowns can give 9 Test opponents and maybe 15 in ODIs, whereas for older players they often only need 5/6 rows. Same goes for the lack of MOM in the oldies, less centuries due to less matches and not-so-flat pitches. Bradman, Harvey and G Chappell aside, most of the other olden-day greats in the ACHOF have less than 15 centuries, and most less than 10. All the modern \"greats\" such as Border, S Waugh and Ponting have ~30+. A post-2000 debuting player might need 35 Test centuries to qualify as a borderline great nowadays with 20 people averaging 50+ in the last decade (how ridiculous). For older players it isn't a problem. Hassett, Ponsford, Woodfull, Hazare, Morris all have less than 10 Test tons. YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nIf it's any help, WP:MLB went through a long discussion over a similar issue which even came to a head in a mediation case.

Crichool seems to have sprinkled his or her own vandalism in the way, but at the moment it reads \"He is considered to be one of the greatest wicket-keeper-batsmen in the history of the game\" - is that the version we are happy with? I personally prefer greatest to best anyway, because best just makes me think \"bestest everset\" and other such icky wording! SGGH ping!\n\nIt's fine now. It was changed to: \"He is considered as the best wicket-keeper-batsmen in the history of the game.\" Which I thought was a bit far.... Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nFolks, what do we think should be done with the Ricky Ponting article? - as it is way too big at the moment. It's always probably going to be crickets biggest article because of his achievements and amount of matches, but, we need to do some trimming of of sections and perhaps create a sub-article. I was thinking something along the line of Captaincy career of Ricky Ponting, as most of the info is from when he became captain ODI in 2002. So what do we think? - and are there any other suggestions? Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nI've created Arthur Hill (Australian cricketer), brother of Clem, 13 months after I found it needed creating! There is an Arthur Hill (cricketer), and I was planning to move it to Arthur Hill (English cricketer, but his CA profile suggests he goes by one of his middle names, thus Ledger Hill. Has anyone got any idea of another source for this, or where the article should be located?\n\nThanks,\n\n—MDCollins (talk)\n\nHe's Arthur Hill elsewhere on CA and throughout on CI. Ledger seems to have been a family name: his father and son both had it too. CMJ's magisterial Who's Who of Test Cricketers has him as an Arthur.

Ikip\n\nUnfortunately the history of the Bennett King article is now only starting from the date it was incubated. Any way of fixing this? Jevansen (talk)\n\nFor those who have lived under a rock for the past few days, this is just a result of some editors deciding that Unreferenced BLPs is evil and stuff the rules, lets delete them all. If you've missed the fun, be thankful. The Australian project is trying to ward off whatever solution the \"consensus\" comes up with by just clearing our decks of the 2000 odd unreferenced BLPs. I'd suggest that the cricket project one make up a similar page and do a similar referencing drive. Once I've done all of the AFL players, I'll help out too.The-Pope (talk)\n\nWhat's the best way of finding the cricket ones, or would it be a case of trawling through all the category pages? Harrias (talk)\n\nI used WP:AWB. Brief instructions are either on the Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia/Unreferenced BLPs page or one of the noticeboard/talk pages linked from it. I can't do the cricket list now, but if it hasn't been done in a day or so I will do it then. I think WP:Football has a list almost 5000 articles long.The-Pope (talk)\n\nI used AWB too! List is now here Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket/Unreferenced BLPs, 300 odd articles isn't too bad! Harrias (talk)\n\nWe used the Category intersect tool on WP India, at Wikipedia:WikiProject India/Unreferenced BLPs, we can probably use the same process for articles here. This is getting a little out of hand currently, I came across PRODs for Prime Ministers (I'm not kidding!) and an Olympic medallist deleted for being unreferenced. –SpacemanSpiff\n\nSuggestion: Instead of removing the names from the list, could we just add a status to the side (sourced / PRODded / AfD etc) and perhaps strike the article out? If nothing else, it'll give us an idea of this entire brouhaha was worth it. cheers. –SpacemanSpiff\n\nA question, just how did articles like Dirk Wellham and Dipak Patel get tagged as \"unreferenced\"? Each article clearly gives at least source. Admittedly the source is not formatted as a reference but that is not a requirement, merely a preferred method of laying out sources. The articles are admittedly poorly sourced but they are not unreferenced. I propose removing these tags unless someone can convince me that I should not. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nIt's not the only case, just take a look at WP:IND/UBLP and you'll get an idea about the mistaggings in the small sample we've gone through. One article had 15 sources including 5 inline cites and was tagged as unsourced BLP, and then ones where the death date is on the article have been tagged as unsourced BLP too! –SpacemanSpiff\n\nWell all this stuff isn't likely to achieve much except get a load of bogusly-reffed articles and most POv/negative content comes in by people taking speculation from a source as bald fact, or ismply synthesising, and frankly, they aren't going to check the ref anyway, so it's pointless rambling on their part YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nTikkavarapu Venkatarami Reddy. Smells like one to me, can't find him on CI/CA. CSD G3? –SpacemanSpiff\n\nYep, added to Deccan article, too.

I'm not around very often these days, but this one could end up going on AfD. Bobo.\n\nPut a couple of refs in and removed unref'd BLP tag. Johnlp (talk)\n\nWhen reviewing List of international cricket centuries by Donald Bradman at FLC, I noticed that it used the modern South African flag. However, Bradman would have played against the apartheid state not the modern one. Considering how important their treatment of Basil D'Oliviera was to the sporting boycott, I think it is important to get straight which matches were played by apartheid South Africa and which by the modern side and use the appropriate flag.--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nWe've discussed this before and the rainbow era flag is everywhere, and we were going to change to the modern infobox that doesn't use flags to avoid the problem of players who played under two flags or a regime change, but it hasn't been done yet; an infobox would be nice. Also, there is some legal controversy as to when the Australian flag became the national flag, because according to some, the Australian flag was not the national flag until the Flags Act of 1953 because the Union Jack was still the official flag...although I know that the Aus flag was carried at the opening ceremonies of the Olympics. Not to mention that Australia wasn't a coutnry before 1901. YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nAustralia doesn't strike me as so controversial especially if both were in some degree of official use. It's a big job to fix everywhere. However, when it comes especially to featured content, we really should do our best to get even the nitpicky things right.--Peter cohen (talk)\n\n[3] That's an unbelievable bowling average and S/R for someone who played this side of 1975, isn't it? What was that about? SGGH ping!\n\nHe played most of his matches in the Howa Bowl, as far as I know. Low scoring was common so I imagine most of the bowlers had low averages.--Sarastro1 (talk)\n\nOur text includes this: \"Although the matches hadn't been given first-class status at the time, the UCB requested them to be and record were amended to include the 216 Howa Bowl matches as well as 7 other representative matches between 'non white' teams.\" This seems a poor, and politically-motivated decision by the ICC. --Dweller (talk)\n\nI agree, especially given some of the matches of a much higher standard that don't have first-class status. To be frank, the entire first-class record needs a re-think and should be completely rewritten. I'm still none the wiser as to why Smokers v Non-Smokers matches from the 19th Century deserve first-class status! Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nVery possibly true, but was it not an even more politically motivated decision that the cricketers in this competition were not permitted to play \"official\" first-class cricket in SA at the time, hence the creation of the competition? Also, if we are judging the quality of cricket by the scores, I understand from the Wisden article referenced in the Howa Bowl article that the pitches were very poor, leading to low scores.--Sarastro1 (talk)\n\nFair point, and of course the pitches were poor precisely because of the \"non-whites\" nature of the competition. Scores could have been much higher had it had the access to the same grounds that the \"whites only\" competition had. I think Barnes just happens to be the player affected most by the decision to make these games first-class - without them I think he played just a handful of FC games. It also affected some other more notable players - Basil D'Oliveria had three or four games added to his stats by the decision. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\n...doyen of all WP quizzes, is in danger of expiring through lack of questions (and people to answer). Johnlp (talk)\n\nAnd you had to go and ask such a difficult question... --Roisterer (talk)\n\n...oh, but it's so simple (when you know the answer). Johnlp (talk)\n\nFunny that :) —Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nIt is asserted here that the West Indies Cricket Board flag is copyrighted. I agree that it probably is, which means that the image will be removed from Commons. In that case, it should be re-uploaded here for fair-use on the WICB article (only!) and we will have to remove it from every other article. {{cr|West Indies}} can remain, but a null transparent placeholder will be rendered instead (like {{cr|Ireland}}). — Andrwsc (talk · contribs)\n\nWhoever is removing the Windies flags from infoboxes is leaving quite a mess behind. Jevansen (talk)\n\nPerhaps now is a good time to update those articles to use {{Infobox cricketer biography}} instead of {{Infobox historic cricketer}}. — Andrwsc (talk · contribs)\n\nDone Willie Rodriguez's infobox: now the text looks pretty inadequate... Johnlp (talk)\n\nsub-discussion about Ireland flag\n\nNote, of course, that the Cricket Ireland flag isn't actually copyrighted. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nIf you can source that, then we can restore an image. — Andrwsc (talk · contribs)\n\nHow is it actually possible to source something like that? Showing that something IS copyrighted is incredibly simple in most cases - it is usually marked as copyrighted. But the reverse? I'm not so sure. I know the Cricket Ireland media manager personally, but he doesn't see the point in contacting Wikipedia in what ever way he needs to just to confirm what to him is already obvious. And I agree with him. The flag isn't copyrighted, end of story - or at least it should be, but the increasingly bureaucratic nature of Wikipedia prevents it from being. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nBoth the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have signed and ratified the Berne Convention, so copyright on the logo (and derivative flag) is automatic. Yes, that is incredibly simple: it is copyrighted by default. But it is also incredibly simple to show that something is not copyrighted—there would be an explicit license (e.g. statement placing the creative work in the public domain, or perhaps a Creative Commons license) from the original creator of the work. So unless we have that, the default condition applies. — Andrwsc (talk · contribs)\n\nZscout370 (talk · contribs) has kindly added orphan tags to all the players century FLs ... —Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nAren't they linked from their main pages, or does the AWB detect less than 5 or so? As most of the ones who have FLs are top century-makers, a navigational template of folks with 25+ centuries or whatever would get them all linking together YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nI think they are all linked from their main pages... —Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nI've removed them from the ones on my watchlist. As long as they're not totally orphaned, I don't see a problem. And that's what you get from blind use of AWB. The Rambling Man (talk)\n\nIs a navigational template justified though? We have a lot of century lists and methinks it'd be nice to be able to jump from the Don's list to SRT's and from SRT to Dravid and so on.–SpacemanSpiff\n\nI don't see why not. Perhaps a template for, say, the top 20 century makers? The Rambling Man (talk)\n\nShould be straight-forward enough to include these fellas in a template? Any volunteers, or should I do it? And clearly there's the ODI list as well... The Rambling Man (talk)\n\nJust started, will post the link here once I have the draft up and you can make any changes you like. cheers. –SpacemanSpiff\n\nI've got a list of Lara's centuries already started on my sandbox somewhere which I can work a bit more on soon. Harrias (talk)\n\nNavBar is at {{International cricket centuries}}. Lots of FL opportunities. –SpacemanSpiff\n\nDare one suggest the same could be done for \"five-wicket hauls\"? The Rambling Man (talk)\n\nWill do that once I finish the Women's Test cricket list; I don't want to start the NavBar without a blue women's list.–SpacemanSpiff\n\nCould the number of centuries be added in brackets into the navbar?—MDCollins (talk)\n\nCan I suggest that some 'rule'/qualifier is made for deciding which players a) have these articles, and b) are used in the navbox (preferably the same qualifier). The top 20 has been suggested by TRM, or over 20 centuries? Having arbitrary lists for players we like etc, doesn't seem right for this project somehow. I know Trescothick has got one, but he doesn't even feature on the statsguru top centuries, which I assume is >15 centuries.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nTrescothick has one for two reasons; firstly his article is long enough anyway, without adding this list on the bottom of it, and secondly because he has scored more international centuries than any other English player with the exception of Gooch. I'd say as with all pages the issue is notability and split-ability. If the player in question has a short page, then the centuries can probably tag onto it, if not, it would need a separate article (within reason). Harrias (talk)\n\nActually, I did the navbar for 25+ international centuries (Tests + ODIs + T20s) and Tresco features in that. I'll add the number of centuries in. –SpacemanSpiff\n\nThat makes sense now; without wishing to undo/redo any hard work, another suggestion would be to have one navbox with 3 rows/sections (Test/ODI/T20I) to make it easier to see how the centuries were scored with criteria for say 15 Tests, 15 ODI and 5T20I or whatever. It would seem slightly more relevant than a collection of names with match types mixed up. Could include a combined section with a higher qualifier, 40? Maybe that's just me! An idea anyway.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nBihar cricket team redirects to Jharkhand cricket team which is wrong. Bihar and Jharkhand are two states of India and page for one state should not be redirected to other state page.Shyamsunder (talk)\n\nIt appears that when Bihar was split, the team just continued to operate under the name Jharkand, rather than the team splitting as well. Bihar doesn't have a FC team atm YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nWhat happened here? Was anyone on the project aware of this? Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nI wasn't. --Dweller (talk)\n\nThat's crazy SGGH ping!\n\nAs I understand it, he's been indef blocked because one of his undeclared socks participated in AfDs. Policy does appear to say that one shouldn't do this, but it seems a technical breach of policy, rather than an abusive use of socks (eg block evasion), or disruption in a way that would justify indef blocking. Unless I've missed something, a warning would seem to be more appropriate than an indef. I'll have a chat with the checkuser. --Dweller (talk)\n\nThough why would he have any alternate accounts? SGGH ping!\n\nHe was involved in that dispute with a user about self-referencing a while ago, but I hope the indef block means blocked until he gives his reasons or apologises and promises to never do it again. Hope it's just a case of his relative/housemate sharing a computer than anything more sinister. As for the editor who reported him, is using an IP address considered a sockpuppet in itself, or is that sort of disguise allowed?The-Pope (talk)\n\nIt's perfectly legitimate not to create a username, and I do know of very regular (and well known and respected) editors who only use an IP address. However it is very unusual to find a regular editor who is informed enough to file SPI requests who doesn't have a username. But there is no policy against it. SGGH ping!\n\nJust on a quick check, the IP address that submitted the evidence has no previous edits. Seems very bizarre, especially given that all that was posted on the discussion after the initial evidence on 3 January was a query regarding policy. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nTrue. Perhaps it was an editor wishing to be anonymous, or at a different work station. SGGH ping!\n\nI've just read the investigation, and the editor who reported him seems very knowledgable about Blackjack's arguments with User:HughGal, and \"Doctor Tillman\". This person has been blocked himself as a sockpuppet. It all seems tied up to a dispute that has been going on for a long time, and it could probably do with untangling. HughGal has used lots of IP addresses before, some of which are blocked. BJ also complained about HughGal (over the Verity article) on 3 Jan 2010, when the report was made. All the editors mentioned seem to tie up somehow. It could do to be looked at very closely.--Sarastro1 (talk)\n\nBJ has explained it here.–SpacemanSpiff\n\nIt seems that BlackJack was not informed that he was \"on trial\" until after sentence was passed and his editing rights withdrawn. That stinks. JH (talk page)\n\nThe whole thing stinks. Something is definitely a bit fishy about the entire situation. Andrew nixon (talk)\n\nAgreed. The way BJ's external disputes have drifted into WP may often have been irritating, but his energy has never been in doubt and his contribution to the cricket articles is huge and irreplaceable. How can the project as a whole justify treating one of its most prolific contributors in such an unfair way on the say-so of someone who can't even be bothered to identify themselves? Johnlp (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think it's compulsory to notify people that they have been accused; that has been abused here. To have BJ blocked for this feels wrong. It seems to me that the Orrelly Man account was a legitimate use of an alternative account to escape what is effectively stalking. Ten votes in AfDs does not warrant a block. Nev1 (talk)\n\nLooking at Orrelly Man's AfD votes, I'm left wondering where the abuse is and how they were disruptive. If they weren't, where was the point in the block?\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Game events: result was delete, Orrelly Man voted delete\n\ntwo comments on Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kolkata Test Match 2001 Ind vs Australia but no votes [4] [5]\n\nstarted Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gaming Response Research Foundation which resulted in a deletion; voted delete in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Trashball which resulted in deletion\n\nstarted Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Game (simulation) which resulted in keep but is a terrible article\n\nstarted Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Glenrothes cricket club the result of which was delete\n\nstarted Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Catholic Conference (MIAA) which resulted in keep but a school football league doesn't seem notable and I'm not sure how it survived.

Regarding this discussion, BlackJack didn't say what he thought on the subject, and what is wrong with this? Also, WP:ILLEGIT just says that \"Voting more than once in polls\" is not allowed, which did not happen. The IP who filed the investigation misrepresented the case. Nev1 (talk)\n\nThe blocking admin has commented on the situation. Nev1 (talk)\n\nI admit I still don't know why he had so many alternate accounts. Surely even if you are escaping harassment you only need one. SGGH ping!\n\nExactly what I think. Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nAnd if the block is going to be shortened BJ needs to fill in this information first. SGGH ping!\n\nWell he now seems to have left Wikipedia, and I'm not surprised. Perhaps in time he will reconsider, though I wouldn't care to bet on it. JH (talk page)\n\nAnd also appears to be using his IP address to edit... —Aaroncrick (talk)\n\nThe third account was begun only a few days ago, after the other two were declared \"busy\". The IP address was used only yesterday. --86.148.207.61 (talk)\n\nBJ\n\nHe was using the sockpocket to pose as someone else. If you look at the Orrelly thing. Having looked at this and knowing a bit about a few of the areas covered, Jack was somewhat omnipotent in his tone. Also he did self referenced. That can't be right when it was a self published e-book.FirstComrade (talk)\n\nI've shrunk your header to include it in the thread above. I don't know enough about Blackjack's contributions to comment, but I would be careful what accusations one entertains. SGGH ping!\n\nAm I alone is getting a bit fed up with the way new users and IP addresses are coming on here basically to slag off someone who's made a huge contribution to the cricket coverage on WP? I think we're all now aware that BJ bent and broke a few rules and that there are things that should be tidied up or changed where he misused accounts or overdid the self-reference. Fine, and if some of the newcomers want to help do that work, then they're very welcome. What I find less welcome is this moralising, sanctimonious tone and the re-statement of what appears almost to be personal animosity. This isn't the place for that kind of thing. This is a forum for volunteer people who enjoy cricket and want to improve WP's coverage of it. For all his faults, BJ did a lot of work in that regard. If our new users want to help, then fine; if not, then take your fight elsewhere, please. Johnlp (talk)\n\nIt's pretty obvious these IPs and new accounts are the same person who's been harrassing BJ. Either get a CU on them or revert their edits and ignore their trolling. The issue is closed and this person is trying to cause more trouble. Plenty of what they say is utter bollocks. --Nev1 (talk)\n\nAlthough I didn't agree with the first reversion of the above comments, this was the suggestion I made to mattingbn as well. SGGH ping!\n\nIn addition, two users, the above User:FirstComrade and User:BrownEdge seem to be going around making edits to articles which Blackjack was involved in. They have both altered his various talkpages and Brownedge has made sweeping changes to Variations in first-class cricket statistics and Champion County and not made any comment. He just seems to have removed a lot of material which Blackjack put on, and which ties into this ongoing and increasingly ridiculous feud. I've undone the changes to the two articles, but this is getting ridiculous. And possibly bordering on psychosis.--Sarastro1 (talk) ‎\n\nI've semi-protected Variations in first-class cricket statistics for a week. It's quite obvious there are multiple sock-drawers operating here and some off-wiki animosities are getting moved here. –SpacemanSpiff\n\nUnblock?\n\nWell teh blocking admin doesn't seem to mind, and the discussion above seems fine with BJ, and the other party was already banned while BJ was not. On another note, Sarastro1 (talk · contribs) was incorrectly taken out by an admin without bothering to do a CU, per WP:DUCK, as though every person writing about English cricket are socks of each other YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nIncidentally, the IP reporting made comments an WP:ANI regarding Blackjack circumventing his block. SGGH ping!\n\nYes, here it is. It seems Blackjacks IP has been blocked and another SPI has been set up. SGGH ping!\n\nCan't say I see eye to eye with Jack about the ACS, his former involvement with which has been the cause of some of his troubles on here, but for Wikipedia to ban him is like the French Revolution executing Danton. It was said of the revolution that it finally emulated Saturn and devoured its own children. Wikipedia has lost itself among its ludicrous rules and can no longer identify with individuals. How can it ban Jack and allow Fieldgoalunit to continue? The site has little enough credibility left in the real world and it needs editors like Jack, but I bet he will not return. --JamesJJames (talk)\n\nPeer review\n\nWally Hammond • peer review\n\nFeatured article\n\nSam Loxton • review\n\nMontague Druitt • review\n\nGood article\n\nSourav Ganguly\n\nCameron White\n\nYellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nUpdated Harrias (talk)\n\nAshes 2013 turned up on the new page list today.

Let's see what happens, then take it to AfD if it survives the prod.—MDCollins (talk) 18:37, 7 February 2010 (UTC) The prod has been contested. If anybody feels in agreement about deletion, would they mind taking it to AfD? There's a couple of references now, which apparently mean the WP:CRYSTAL doesn't apply.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nI've added a few clean-up tags, if it does stick around it's a terrible article, 'test cricket' just makes me shudder, but I'm not going to spend time fixing an article that isn't necessary right now! If it does survive, it needs moving to 2013 Ashes series too. Harrias (talk)\n\nMore hypocrisy from the site where anyone can edit, is it? User:HughGal is still here operating as both User:FirstComrade and User:BrownEdge. Isn't the resident sad case here going to see to it that he gets blocked again?

He should have been banned ages ago. --JamesJJames (talk)\n\nI have created a list of cricket grounds on which Somerset have played home matches (see my sandbox). However, I am having trouble coming up with the appropriate name for the article, I've had a few ideas, but none seem entirely right:\n\nList of cricket grounds in Somerset – immediately disregarded as that would cover all the grounds, which would be a huge number, and not what I am listing.\n\nList of county cricket grounds in Somerset – seems the best name but, one of the grounds Somerset played home matches on is in Devon, while two are in Bristol, which isn't exactly Somerset.\n\nList of Somerset County Cricket Club grounds – sounds clunky to me.\n\nList of Somerset county cricket grounds – slightly better, but ambiguous maybe? Harrias (talk)\n\nAgreed on ruling out option 1, I don't really like option 4 either but I can't put my finger on why. Of the other two, I'd probably lean towards option 3 on the basis that, if I were searching for that article that's probably the phrase I'd search for. — AMBerry (talk)\n\nI too prefer option 3. It might sound clunky, but it is the most precise. Do any other counties already have such a list? If so, then there's a lot to be said for keeping the naming consistent. JH (talk page)\n\nNot that I can tell; if they do, then they have been well hidden! I'll got with option three, I agree it is the most precise. Harrias (talk)\n\nIt's got to be 3. Most grammatically correct. Hey, it's not an exciting title, but it's an accurate one, and that's what counts!—MDCollins (talk)\n\nIt might also be neat to see how many games each ground has hosted, if such information is recorded somewhere.

But this fairly authorititive source credits it to Yabba. JH (talk page)\n\nIt seems unreasonable to me to consider Tom Horan an Irish cricketer and Archie Jackson a Scottish cricketer]? Yes, they were born in Ireland and Scotland respectively but they did not play any cricket there, not even junior or club cricket. On the same basis, Moises Henriques would be a Portuguese cricketer and Freddie Brown was a Peruvian cricketer! What do others think? -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nI agree. Not sure why this has been added to these cricketers. They are already listed as Australians of Irish/Scottish descent. This covers it for me. They have no cricketing connection with Ireland/Scotland.--Sarastro1 (talk)\n\nWikipedia talk:WikiProject Cricket/Archive 63#MOS naming was a discussion on similar lines. I found Andrew nixon's distinction to be quite compelling. —SpacemanSpiff\n\nI am comfortable with the distinction and terminology (i.e \"Ireland\" vs. \"Irish\"). Horan is quite clearly not an \"Ireland\" cricketer. My question more along the lines of \"Is Horan an \"Irish\" cricketer? Yes, he was born in Ireland and yes, he is a cricketer but I am not so sure that makes him an \"Irish cricketer\" in the same way that Craig Kieswetter, and about two dozen others (!), are quite legitimately an \"England cricketers\" and \"South African cricketers\". For me, use of the term \"Irish cricketer\" should mean more than merely born in Ireland and played cricket. the cricket should at least have some tie to Ireland as well. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nI saw remove it. We aren't going to say that Arnie is an Austrian pollie, or that Owais Shah is a Pakistani cricketer. YellowMonkey (bananabucket)\n\nMother Teresa was classified under Category:Bengali Nobel laureates before I removed her, so I'd agree, just thought that WP:CRIC had defined this earlier. —SpacemanSpiff\n\nThe guy is called ARCHIE for feck's sake (he might as well have been called Angus, Dougie or the like), was born in Rutherglen to Scottish parents and spent part of his childhood there. That makes him Scottish, even if he did play for Australia (which makes him Australian too). On another note, I'm well aware that many cricket fans in Scotland think/behave as if they're English (they're not) and support England, but that's still not good enough.--MacRusgail (talk) p.s. On the rugby pages, there is a differentiation between players nationality (Scottish/Australian in this case) and the team they played for (Australi)\n\nI don't dispute any of the first part of your comment, he can certainly be (and he is in other cats) certainly defined as Scottish, my question is \"Is he a \"Scottish cricketer?\" I say no. The second part of your statement appears to be a strange slag-off at Anglicised Scots, how that is relevant in this case I don't know. I would support Mike Denness and Ian Peebles being categorised as \"Scottish cricketers\" as their scottishness and their cricket are linked. With Jackson they are not. To hark back to my earlier example, it is a nonsense to call Moises Henriques a Portuguese cricketer even though he is just as Portuguese as Jackson was Scottish. The nationality and the cricket are not linked. -- Mattinbgn\\talk\n\nThe Ireland cricket flag appears to be the green shamrock, on a blue background as seen [here]. This image is certainly that used by the ICC when they show the flag icons representing their associate members and indeed in the pages of Cricket Ireland. I note that this is not allowed to be shown on articles to represent the Ireland cricket team in general on the grounds of potential copyright violation. I have two main points:\n\nFor the specific article on the Ireland cricket team I am suprised it is not already shown, because it would fall under \"fair use\" to use it here. There is no question about that based on a plethora of similar examples.\n\nWith regard to the general use of the flag as an icon etc, fair usage would not be permitted for an image under copyright. However, there is surely a strong case to be made for the fact that the flag does not breach the Threshold of originality. The blue background can cretainly not be under copyright. As for the image of the three shamrocks. First, shamrocks per se are certainly not \"original work\" in terms of representing Ireland. The use of three shamrocks as an image is also something that was used by the Ireland rugby union side since at least the early 1930s, and before that it was a four shamrock motif. The design of the shamrock badge is in no way intricate. Has the case for this not being copyright using the argument of \"threshold of originality\" been made already?Kwib (talk)\n\nPeer review\n\nWally Hammond • peer review\n\nFeatured article\n\nIan Meckiff • Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Ian Meckiff/archive1\n\nFeatured list\n\nList of Somerset CCC players by number of appearances • review\n\nList of international cricket centuries by Brian Lara • review\n\nGood article\n\nCameron White\n\nUpdated version of list.

All or nothing?—MDCollins (talk)\n\nThe difference as I see it is that the concept of the Golden Age of cricket is certainly notable and been written about by many writers, independently of each other.

It seems as legitimate an explanation as suggesting competing internationally is sufficient for notability.Hack (talk)\n\nActually, he seems to meet WP:CRIN\n\nThe major cricket qualification includes any player or umpire who has appeared in a Test match since 1877; or in a limited overs international (including Twenty20 internationals) since 1971\n\nHe's played ten Twenty20 internationals and there isn't any form of qualification in WP:CRIN about which matches are considered Twenty20 internationals...\n\nFurther to that, the explanation of major cricket copied above doesn't seem to discriminate between limited overs international matches and One Day International matches (currently defined by the ICC as the ten Test countries and several other countries).Hack (talk)\n\nThe last red link in the ICC affiliate member template has been taken care of: Croatian Cricket Federation. -WarthogDemon\n\nI suspect some eyes may be needed. The new accounts adding fanpraise and calling him \"Sachin\". UGH, makes me shudder. It's like streaking your hands down a chalkboard. I'm sure a purist! :D SGGH ping!\n\nLuckily, they haven't bothered to edit the other gernal parts of hte article, else there would be POV everywhere. It's also on the main page at the moment, in the pictured news slot YellowMonkey (vote in the Southern Stars and White Ferns supermodel photo poll)\n\nI have restarted the discussion to add IPL to WP:ITNR. Please discuss at Wikipedia_talk:In_the_news/Recurring_items#Cricket:_IPL. --GPPande\n\nIf anyone can find a suitable one, I'd be most grateful. --Dweller (talk)\n\nIn the Wilfred Rhodes article, there are 2 photos of Rhodes which are almost certainly from before 1923. Does anyone have any evidence that they were in a publication before 1923? Also, does anyone know of any good photos which would be free to use of Wally Hammond, Douglas Jardine, Len Hutton or any other pre-war English cricketers? --Sarastro1 (talk)\n\nDoes Frith's bodyline autopsy have photos of Hammond and Jardine, as pre-46 photos taken in Oz will work. There may a team portrait in some history book of the MCC touring party, hopefully it was taken in Aus and not before hopping on a boat. In military career of Keith Miller there is a pic of Miller knocking Hutton's off stump out, which was supposedly put in PD by the Australian Defence Force, according to their website anyway YellowMonkey (vote in the Southern Stars and White Ferns supermodel photo poll)\n\nThe photos in bodyline autopsy are not great quality and would not scan very well. However, you reminded me of the 32-33 team photo which I may be able to get hold of in good quality. There may be a few others too for other tours. --Sarastro1 (talk)\n\nI thought we could dump relevant BLPs we find here for people to give their views on --Dweller (talk)\n\nTrevin Bastiampillai No World Cup appearances at senior level. Do his two other ICC level international appearances count? --Dweller (talk)\n\nCA profile has 8 FC and 5 ODI appearances for Canada listed. As does CricInfo. Passes notability for me. SGGH ping!\n\nSplendid, thanks. --Dweller (talk)\n\n? --Dweller (talk)\n\nCA profile has him playing ODIs and fc matches. Johnlp (talk)\n\nTyvm! --Dweller (talk)\n\nYw. Johnlp (talk)\n\n? --Dweller (talk)\n\nCA profile has a lot of fc matches. Johnlp (talk)\n\nAnd again. --Dweller (talk)\n\nDitto. Johnlp (talk)\n\n? --Dweller (talk)\n\nOnly U19 appearances. Prod. Harrias (talk)\n\n? --Dweller (talk)\n\nHas played List A cricket, keep. Harrias (talk)\n\n? --Dweller (talk)\n\nHas played Women's ODIs, keep. Harrias (talk)\n\n? --Dweller (talk)\n\nHas played first-class cricket, keep. Harrias (talk)\n\n? --Dweller (talk)\n\n13 f-c appearances and 12 List A, says Cricketarchive. Johnlp (talk)\n\n? --I PRODded him but an NZ editor responded by saying he may qualify under WP:GNG. Johnlp (talk)\n\nI believe he fails WP:CRIN (I checked, but U-19 captains with no FC or LA aren't notable?) and I don't think being a freelance writer for CricInfo alone qualifies you under WP:N and I don't think there is anything else. SGGH ping!\n\nHis CA, NZ U-19 ODIs. SGGH ping!\n\nThese are the reasons I prodded him. But maybe GNG overrides such things? I've not come across this before. Johnlp (talk)\n\nI'm not sure whether he is. He hasn't done anything notable IMO. Lots of people write for CricInfo without being notable. SGGH ping!\n\nAnother one to take onto AfD and see what happens I think. Harrias (talk)\n\nTaken it. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Marc Ellison SGGH ping!\n\nI would welcome some help with the documentation for this template. I have updated the usage guidelines for the template to reflect common usage (at least as I have experienced it), but some anonymous editors have been reverting me, saying there is no consensus for my changes. My response would be that common usage dictates consensus better than any discussion on a talk page could, and therefore I would request that editors here try to enforce the changes I have made to the template documentation. Furthermore, I have added a parameter to the template, allowing for the result of the coin-toss to be added without needing to use the \"rain\" parameter. This, too, is now reflected in the documentation. – PeeJay\n\nI could definitely do with some backup here. These anonymous editors keep coming out of nowhere just to revert me, despite never having edited a thing before in their lives. – PeeJay\n\nI see no problem with what you've done, it all seems valid to me (the players initials etc); I'd like to see some text saying what/who goes in the runs/wickets fields, as without seeing it \"in action\" it may not be clear that it is the highest run-scorer/wicket taker (maybe that is obvious). That said, if editors choose not to implement the template in exactly the same way, it's not a big problem. You haven't said \"this is the exact format\", you've just given the common format. We can't strictly enforce everything! There's a couple of things in the Template:Infobox cricketer biography that people don't use in \"exactly\" the way I would, but we're not enforcing everything. One thing though, I would say \"x won the toss and decided to field\" rather than \"field first\" to reflect the common usage in scorecards/the media.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nJust had/having a minor edit war with an IP editor regarding initials on the scorecards (at England cricket team against Pakistan in UAE in 2009–10). It got me thinking; why use the initials, when the names are probably more informative? I do it only because it seems to be the standard format, as shown in this template too. But I know a lot of the editors on the India scorecards (and maybe Australia ones too) tend to use full names throughout. Wouldn't this possibly be more informative to a non-expert than initials, especially in cases such as IJ Trott being Jonathan Trott etc. Harrias (talk)\n\nI thought we did it because that's the way that cricket statistics have been recorded since time immemoriam. Cricinfo records them with initials, and I think CricketArchive does too, so if the two biggest cricket stat websites on the internet record stats that way, I reckon it seems appropriate to do the same here. After all, all the names are linked to the correct player article. – PeeJay\n\nAs PeeJay pointed out, that's how it's been done by statisticians for years (since Amateur/Pro type matches); I guess this has partly stemmed from space saving issues, while not a problem on this template, it might be elsewhere. I think its the muslim players (Pakistan in particular?) where the full name is used, as it isn't in their culture to use the initials etc.—MDCollins (talk)\n\nI see he's in the news, but I'm not sure about that Easter Egg link on double century. Going to a list of his centuries isn't a fantastic way to explain what a double ton is to the [many] readers ignorant of cricket. --Dweller (talk)\n\nCan someone take a look at this? A lot of fans keep changing stuff and I apparently protected the wrong version (fixed that complaint), but I can't seem to find the \"official\" list online. cheers. —SpacemanSpiff\n\nI'd like to know how this edit made it under the radar! Jeez. I'll give the IP some strongly worded advice. SGGH ping!\n\nApparently the article is unwatched so it gets a lot of fanboy participation, one particular IP has been countering the SRT fans (likely the same IP as the one that presented the inflammatory edit summary above), but given that hardly any regular editors have worked on this, it isn't a surprise that such edits get by unnoticed. These IPs are all dynamic, so no amount of advice is going to be helpful, that's why the article is semi-protected. I think a factual accuracy tag might be appropriate until someone can get their hands on the official lists and trim down the junk from the article. cheers. —SpacemanSpiff\n\nIs there a better source than CI that isn't politically correct and measures the bowling speeds factually, not delusionally\n\nI Pathan/ Munaf Patel \"medium fast\" often bowls low 120s\n\nJoginder Sharma avg ~ 120 kph in the T20 WC in 2007 \"fast medium\"\n\nJames Hopes avg ~ 130 \"medium\"\n\nSymonds, M/S Waugh etc, ~ 120-125 \"medium\"\n\nStatistically quantifiable data should be done in a more factual way.... YellowMonkey (vote in the Southern Stars and White Ferns supermodel photo poll)\n\nI think that the short answer is \"no\". Apart from in recent international matches, there's been little measuring of bowlers' speeds, and even when speeds have been measured doubts have sometimes been expressed about whether the measuring device has been cailbrated correctly. So I think that there's inevitably going to be a strong subjective element in how bowlers are categorised. It's not helped by somes sources using RFM and RMF as synonyms, some defining RFM as the faster of the two categories, and some defining RMF as the faster. JH (talk page)\n\nFollowing the discussion above. Consensus needed! SGGH ping!\n\nThis has probably been asked many times, but just for clarification, is \"List of COUNTRY cricketers\" for players who have played for that national team, or who play in teams that are in that country, or for players who were born in that country and play cricket anywhere? SGGH ping!\n\nEngland/India/Australia etc = Players who have played for the national team(s)\n\nEnglish/Indian/Australian etc = Players who play in the respective country for national/subnational teams. (This is where there's differing opinions, does Kevin Pietersen belong in South African cricketers?)\n\nLast discussion on this topic had no resolution. —SpacemanSpiff\n\nWhat about Category:New Zealand cricketers? SGGH ping!\n\nDate Unreferenced BLPs % done 24 Jan 355 0% 31 Jan 301 15% 7 Feb 281 21% 14 Feb 242 32% 21 Feb 221 38% 28 Feb 147 59%\n\nGood week this one, hopefully shouldn't take too much longer to get them all done! Harrias (talk)\n\nHas anyone else seen this rankings book? It was done in 2009. I have to say I was very surprised that he put Jaywardene at 80 above Pollock and Donald, and Jayasuriya and Pietersen in the 60s, Harvey at 87 below Jayawardene, and Graeme Smith at 90; He seems to have totally forgotten about Davidson, who isn't in the 100 at all while Benaud, Lindwall, Kapil are all in there from 30-50. Hassett and Morris weren't there at all; it all seems a bit odd. Macartney was #100, and Merchant and V Mankad are right at the bottom of the 90s and Hazare doesn't a get look in, below Chandra and"
