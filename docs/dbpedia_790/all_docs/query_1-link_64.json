        "text": "Tarek Mentouri, the former massage therapist accused by 19 women of sex crimes, pleaded guilty in late November to six crimes, including felony sexual battery, as part of a plea deal that will place him on the sex offender registry and sentence him to prison for six years.\n\nMentouri pleaded guilty to three felony counts of sexual battery, two misdemeanor assault/provocative contact charges, and one misdemeanor charge of criminal impersonation. As part of the plea deal, Mentouri will be eligible for consideration of early release from prison after serving 30% of his six-year sentence.\n\n“If I get to see him in a jumpsuit, that’s kind of nice for me,” said Peyton Parker, the first woman to contact Nashville news outlet WSMV4 Investigates after she said Mentouri sexually violated her during a job interview. Mentouri pleaded guilty to sexual battery in Parker’s case. “He’s awful, and he did awful things to people, and they’ve had awful experiences,” April Parker, Peyton’s mother, said. His is trial on the sex crimes was set to begin next year.\n\nThe most serious charge Mentouri faced, a rape charge, was dismissed as part of the plea when prosecutors realized the evidence available would most likely not result in a successful verdict on that charge.\n\nStill, Nashville Assistant District Attorney Sarah Wolfson Butler said:\n\n“We are very pleased with the outcome and knowing that this sexual predator admits to his actions. Our office fought vigorously for every victim on this case. Ultimately, we have to weigh the evidentiary strength of each case and a large part of that assessment is victim cooperation. We deeply respect and appreciate the patience and support of the many victims in this case. Thanks to their efforts, this predator is off the streets.”\n\nPrior to the deal, a zoom meeting with as many victims as the district attorney’s office could come in contact with was held and all of the victims agreed to the plea deal.\n\n“I’m satisfied as I can be with what we got,” Peyton Parker said. “Getting any jail time for him is great and having him on the sex offender registry is extremely important. He obviously did more serious crimes, and it would be great if he had been convicted of those. But you’ve got to take what you can.”\n\nAlex Friedmann has been found guilty of vandalism in the amount of 250-thousand or above after the Davidson County jury heard three days of testimony and watched hours of video surveillance.\n\nFriedmann, 53, was charged with felony vandalism after impersonating a construction contractor, stealing two keys and hiding three firearms and numerous blades in the walls of the Downtown Detention Facility while it was still under construction in 2019.\n\nThe jury deliberated for an hour before returning a guilty verdict for vandalism with damages in the amount of $250,000. The crime is a Class A felony and Friedmann faces between 25 and 40 years in prison.\n\nDavidson County Sheriff Daron Hall called the incident a “deliberate, evil” plan and said during the trial that he was sure there would have been massive loss of life if that contraband had been discovered by inmates.\n\nOfficers discovered in December 2019 that a maintenance key ring was different from others in the key control room and soon learned two keys were missing — a general movement key and a kitchen padlock key. Video footage revealed that Friedmann had been inside the control room, pocketed a set of keys and removed them from the facility for two hours before returning most of them.\n\nFurther footage showed Friedmann bringing tools into the facility, covering up security cameras and repeatedly returning to various areas of the detention center more than 20 times between August 2019 and when he was caught in January 2020.\n\nThe DCSO replaced 1,800 locks after the break-in and delayed opening the facility for several months. Authorities estimated the cost to change those locks, and labor to review thousands of hours of video footage, was more than $600,000.\n\nIn closing arguments, Deputy District Attorney Amy Hunter said the sheriff’s office had two options.\n\n“Either tear down the entire building or replace all the keys,” she said. “It was not a hard choice for them.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Ben Raybin, Friedmann’s attorney, argued the state was overcharging his client. He said the law is twofold — there first needs to be proof of damage, and then the value of that damage needs to be determined.\n\nThe damage was never in dispute. Friedmann dug into the walls and hid weapons there. He did vandalize the facility, but Raybin argued he never damaged the keys or damaged the locks. The cost to change the locks and to review the video footage, the attorney said, was a “collateral cost” and not covered under the law.\n\n“Why did they have to change the locks?” Raybin asked. “Because they were removed, not because they were damaged.”\n\nDeputy District Attorney Roger Moore said no matter which way the costs are dissected, they met the burden of proof that there was $250,000 in damages.\n\n“Once the keys were removed, from that point on, what was the reasonable thing for the sheriff to do at that point?” Moore asked. “What we can prove is that he compromised, tampered and damaged that facility. Was there any other reasonable alternative? No.”\n\nThe Tennessean – July 21, 2022\n\nTravis Reinking, who killed four people in 2018 when he opened fire with an assault-style rifle at a Waffle House in Tennessee, was sentenced Saturday, February 5th, 2022 to life in prison without parole. Reinking, 33, was found guilty the day before of all 16 counts, including eight first-degree murder charges.\n\nDistrict Attorney General Glenn Funk, and his team, have been preparing for the trial of Reinking for years. “This was a long process,” Funk said. “There’s a frustration anytime that a case takes four years to get to trial especially one that has this many causalities.” Frustration fueled the prosecution who poured over evidence despite disruptions and delays. “Mr. Reinking changed lawyers. He had to have mental health evaluations. Then we’re almost ready for trial and COVID rolls in,” recalled Funk.\n\nThe 10-day-long trial focused less on if Reinking pulled the trigger, as he was seen on surveillance camera doing so, but instead, his mental state. “This was one of the rare cases that when the report came back, at first, the words that were used made it appear that they were saying that Travis Reinking could not understand the wrongfulness of his act,” said Funk. “Which is why we study these reports and don’t just look at what does the headline say.” In doing so, Funk said the finding revealed multiple layers of planning. “In 2017 [Reinking] had said he wanted to commit a mass shooting and that when he did the shooting he was planning to make people think he was insane at the time. Before he drove to the Waffle House, he had packed an escape bag that not only included a gun and more ammunition but also included some silver bars that he would be able to exchange for cash on the road so he wouldn’t have a trace of a credit card. After he got done, he went home. He took a shower. He changed clothes. He rearmed himself and he went and hid and tried to get out of the area,” Funk explained. “He clearly knew the wrongfulness of this mass murder.” The jury heard from relatives of the four people who were killed. The four victims were all under 30 years old.\n\nIn November, 2020, Joseph Webster became the first person whose First Degree Murder Conviction was vacated by the Nashville District Attorney’s Conviction Review Unit. Webster had been 15 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. The Nashville District Attorney’s Office set up a unit in 2016 to review cases that might have been decided wrongfully. Members of the new unit collaborated with defense lawyers in an investigation that produced new witnesses and evidence.\n\nSunny Eaton, who runs the conviction review unit, said her office had been created because of District Attorney Glenn Funk’s commitment to have truth-finding as the central role of the prosecutor’s office. “I believe that the overwhelming feeling is one of pride to be part of a district attorney’s office that puts its money where its mouth is,” Ms. Eaton said, “and is actually transparent and takes the steps toward self-reflection and accountability and getting things right that may have been gotten wrong before.”\n\nImprisoned Nearly 15 Years, but Now Cleared of a Murder He Didn’t Commit\n\nNew York Times article https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/us/joseph-webster-nashville.html\n\nA Nashville judge vacated the conviction of Joseph Webster after a collaborative investigation produced new witnesses and evidence.\n\nJoseph Webster greeting his mother, Marie Burns, as he was released from prison on Tuesday after serving nearly 15 years of a life sentence for murder.\n\nJoseph Webster greeting his mother, Marie Burns, as he was released from prison on Tuesday after serving nearly 15 years of a life sentence for murder.Credit…Andrew Nelles/The Tennessean, via Imagn Content Services, LLC\n\nJohn Ismay\n\nBy John Ismay\n\nNov. 12, 2020\n\nOn Thursday, Joseph Webster lunched on grilled salmon, which he had longed for while spending almost 15 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. There was also steamed broccoli and Diet Coke. “It was delicious,” he said by phone on his way to a local TV news station for an interview.\n\nMr. Webster, 41, walked out of a detention center in downtown Nashville just before 7 p.m. Tuesday, hours after a judge had agreed with a determination by the district attorney’s office that they had lost confidence in Webster’s first-degree murder conviction and had ordered it vacated. Mr. Webster had been serving a life sentence and would have been eligible for parole after serving 51 years.\n\nMr. Webster’s conviction was the first to be overturned since the Nashville District Attorney’s Office set up a unit in 2016 to review cases that might have been decided wrongfully. Members of the new unit collaborated with defense lawyers in an investigation that produced new witnesses and evidence.\n\n“We’re now in the process of helping him rebuild his life,” Mr. Webster’s lawyer, Daniel A. Horwitz, said Thursday.\n\nMr. Webster went to prison in 2003 on an unrelated drug charge and was convicted in 2006 for the murder of Leroy Owens, who was bludgeoned to death with a cinder block in a Nashville parking lot on Nov. 22, 1998.\n\nWitnesses testified during Mr. Webster’s trial that Mr. Owens had been attacked by two Black men driving a white station wagon, and they described one assailant as weighing roughly 160 pounds and the other perhaps 200 pounds. Mr. Webster, however, weighed 300 pounds at the time and had 12 permanently installed, very bright gold front teeth. No witnesses recalled either of the men who attacked Mr. Owens as having gold teeth.\n\n“There was evidence that made it pretty clear who committed this crime, and it was not Mr. Webster,” Mr. Horwitz said. “Two new witnesses came forward who saw the murder and were able to give pretty good descriptions of the two people who did it.”\n\nIn October 2016, Mr. Webster hired Mr. Horwitz after a failed attempt to have the murder weapon tested for DNA evidence. It was around that same time, Mr. Horwitz said, that the Nashville District Attorney’s Office established what it called a conviction review unit to look at cases that might have been incorrectly decided.\n\n“I believe we were the first case that applied for review from that unit,” Mr. Horwitz said, adding that his client had been freed because of “a building snowball of exonerating evidence coming steadily over the course of a very long time.”\n\nSunny Eaton, who runs the conviction review unit, said her office had been created because of District Attorney Glenn Funk’s commitment to have truth-finding as the central role of the prosecutor’s office. “I believe that the overwhelming feeling is one of pride to be part of a district attorney’s office that puts its money where its mouth is,” Ms. Eaton said, “and is actually transparent and takes the steps toward self-reflection and accountability and getting things right that may have been gotten wrong before.”\n\nThe night he was released, Mr. Webster said, he went to his mother’s house and reunited with his four adult sons, whom he had called multiple times a week throughout his imprisonment. “My mom had cooked me a dinner, and we just caught up, and it was just unbelievable,” Mr. Webster said. “So we enjoyed the moment.”\n\nMr. Webster was having a busy Thursday. In the morning, he was back in a courtroom petitioning a judge to return his voting rights, which may be restored after Mr. Webster resolves his court costs, Mr. Horwitz said.\n\nFrom there, the two went to the Tennessee Driver Services office so that Mr. Webster could obtain a new driver’s license, only to find that so much time had passed while he was in prison that he would have to retake the driving test.\n\nAfter doing interviews, Mr. Webster and Mr. Horwitz were planning to visit Project Return, a local organization that helps people transition from incarceration and reintegrate into society.\n\nMr. Webster hopes to start a trucking business and drive a dump truck.\n\n“Nashville is growing so much that I just want to be part of the growth,” Mr. Webster said. “And I can contribute a little bit at a time by moving gravel and rocks.”\n\nCONGRATULATIONS to Assistant District Attorney Kate Boston Melby, Criminal Court Division I Team Leader Wesley King, and their team for a recent DOUBLE HOMICIDE CONVICTION.\n\nOn March 2nd of this year, 38-year-old Marcus Perry was found guilty for the murders of 21-year-old John T. Morrow and 38-year-old Abdinasir Jimale. It took the jury only 1.5 hours to convict Perry of gunning down the 21-year-old Morrow at Club Kilimanjaro on September 25th of 2016 following an argument. Morrow was celebrating his 21st birthday when the shooting occurred, and Jimale was a bystander at the club. Club Kilimanjaro, which had a history of violence and complaints, was padlocked and demolished shortly after the murders.\n\nThis was ADA Kate Boston Melby’s first First-Chair Murder Trial, and a double homicide at that. As Team Leader General Wesley King said in a memo to Kate (and copied to Nashville District Attorney General Glenn Funk): “Double murders don’t come around very often. The prosecution through jury trial of these types of cases is extremely rare … (Kate) not only shepherded the case through jury trial, but obtained convictions on the indicted offenses…..\n\n• 1st degree premeditated murder for the death of John T. Morrow\n\n• 1st degree premeditated murder for the death of Abdinasir Jimale\n\n• 1st degree felony murder for the death of Abdinasir Jimale in the process of killing/attempting to kill John Morrow\n\n• Felon in possession of a weapon\n\nAn automatic life sentence of 60 years behind bars was imposed for each victim.\n\nTeam Leader Wesley King added this about Kate Boston Melby and her courtroom skills: “This was a major achievement and I just want you to know how lucky the people of the community are to have such an able advocate.”\n\nADA Melby credits a fantastic team of professionals, including Division I Team Leader General Wesley King for his guidance, Metro Nashville Police Detectives Melody Saxon, Chad Gish, and Chad High, (and Det. Jason Moyer for last minute video work) along with District Attorney Investigator Randy Martin, Victim Witness Coordinator Cathy Harrison, and District Attorney Audio Specialist Terry Faimon, and Carina Estera for transcribing the transcripts. She also credits brave civilian witnesses who came to court and were willing to testify, despite being scared.\n\nWhen law enforcement agencies and the community come together, justice is served, our city is safer, and victim’s families can begin the healing process.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nMarch 3, 2017\n\n(Nashville, TN) One of three men charged in the 2015 murder of Luis Diaz, 23, pled guilty Thursday and will spend the next four decades in prison. James Jaylen Simmons was set to stand trial later this month for the robbery and shooting death of Diaz. Simmons pled guilty to Second Degree Murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison at 100%. A relative reported Diaz missing on July 8, 2015 when he failed to return home from his job at a Murfreesboro Road Sonic restaurant. The victim’s vehicle was located in Hopkinsville, Kentucky six days after his disappearance. Detectives discovered that Simmons shot Diaz inside the vehicle while on Anderson Road in South Nashville and later dumped his body on a farm in Rockvale, Tennessee. Assistant District Attorney Jan Norman read the following victim impact statement from Luis Diaz’s family:\n\n“Luis was a very friendly, happy, social person. He would always find time to help those that needed help. He started working at a very young age to help out with expenses at home. Everything that he earned he would give to his mother. Like all young kids, he had great dreams which he now will never be able to accomplish because his life was taken. His mother misses him very much. She suffers from his death and has not been able to move on with her life, she misses her “little Luis” every day. His mother taught him to forgive those who had wronged him and to help those that need help the most. Luis’s mother has forgiven those who killed him, her youngest son, and wishes them blessings because she is not the ultimate judge, life will ensure that they are judged and held accountable. Luis’ mother feels sorry for the families of those who killed him, because they too are suffering like her. Today as a representative of Luis’ mother and family, and as his uncle, we forgive those who killed Luis, because hatred begets hatred. We rather continue our lives with a healing heart, attempting happiness and most of all with a clean conscience.”\n\nCo-defendant Joshua Smith, who worked with Diaz at the Sonic restaurant, is scheduled to stand trial on October 16. A third co-defendant, Xavier Young, is also charged with First Degree Murder but has not yet been scheduled for trial.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nFebruary 17, 2016\n\n(Nashville, TN)- District Attorney Glenn Funk has announced the appointments of two assistants to top leadership positions within the DA’s Office. Assistant District Attorneys Roger Moore and Amy Hunter have been named Deputy District Attorneys. Both Moore and Hunter are respected lawyers with histories of prosecuting complex criminal cases in Davidson County.\n\nGeneral Roger Moore first joined the Davidson County District Attorney’s Office in July, 1990. He has served as senior assistant district attorney and team leader of Criminal Court Division V since 1996.

Mayor Megan Barry joined Judge Casey Moreland, District Attorney Glenn Funk and others in announcing the launch of a Human Trafficking Intervention Court in Davidson County.\n\n“Nashville is a compassionate city with a long history of assisting some of our most vulnerable citizens in turning their lives around,” Mayor Barry said. “Human trafficking and prostitution can have a devastating effect on those forced into illegal conduct. This collaborative effort will aid the court system in solving a vast and critical problem.”\n\nThe effort will be the first of its kind in the State of Tennessee and the Southeast. Similar courts are already operating in New York and Chicago.\n\n“As we have done so often in the past with drug courts and mental health courts, this new initiative will assist the Davidson County court system with identifying victims and connecting them with services,” Judge Moreland said. “Human trafficking is a crime that inflicts terrible harm on the most vulnerable members of society including children, runaways, immigrants and the poor. When these victims arrive in our courts, even as defendants in criminal cases, it gives us an opportunity to work together to stop this criminal enterprise.”\n\n“Through the combined efforts of the judiciary, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement, treatment providers, and others, this court will work to restore those impacted by trafficking and prostitution to safe, law-abiding lives,” District Attorney Funk said. “The aim is make Nashville a safer place for everyone.”\n\nWhile it is difficult to measure precisely a practice that exists largely in the shadows, we do know that there are approximately 27 million victims of human trafficking in the United States, according to a recent State Department estimate. The TBI estimates there were well over 100 reported cases of minors being trafficked for sex in Nashville in 2014 and a much greater number of adult victims being trafficked that same year.\n\nAccording to Assistant DA Tammy Meade, who heads the DA’s Grace Empowered prostitution intervention program, “Many more victims continue to go uncounted because they are often driven to the margins of our community.”\n\nUpon completion of the court’s three-phase program, which includes drug treatment and counseling, participants will have their cases dismissed and expunged. Several nonprofit organizations including End Slavery Tennessee, the Sexual Assault Center, The Next Door, Inc. and Thistle Farms will assist the court in providing aftercare.\n\n“The human trafficking court indicates a vital shift, treating victims as victims rather than criminals,” according to Derri Smith, Executive Director of End Slavery Tennessee.\n\nThe Davidson County Human Trafficking Intervention Court will begin on February 9, 2016.\n\nHuman Trafficking-news release\n\nMarch 23, 2015 – District Attorney’s Office Teams with Titans to Promote Healthy Relationships\n\nThe Tennessee Titans recently teamed up with the Nashville District Attorney’s Office to help educate students about the dangers of domestic violence through the promotion of healthy relationships. The Healthy Relationship seminar was presented to over 700 students grades 7-10 at Martin Luther King Jr. Magnet School in Nashville. “We really want to thank the Tennessee Titans and the District Attorney’s Office for coming to M.L.K. today and appreciate the honesty in showing our students what healthy relationships are,” said Dr. Angela Carr, executive principal at M.L.K Magnet School.\n\nDomestic violence issues make up more than half of the violent crime in the Middle Tennessee region. Titans safety Michael Griffin, center Gabe Ikard and guard Justin McCray were on hand as guest speakers at the event, which included a highly interactive look at how the consequences of the choices we make can impact our lives forever.\n\n“Change comes through educating young people about the choices they make, the penalties associated with crime and the impact on families.” District Attorney Glenn Funk said.\n\nThe District Attorney’s Office informed students about the legal ramifications of their actions and also discussed the resources available to help support victims of domestic violence. The event also included a question and answer session which allowed students the opportunity to ask questions regarding healthy relationships. “We definitely want to make sure that our students are equipped with learning what healthy relationships are and applying what they have learned in their lives,” Carr added. One of the many highlights of the program involved Titans players presenting their personal testimonies to the group and how they have properly handled certain situations they’ve experienced. “We are grateful for the Tennessee Titans’ dedication to this issue and for their commitment to help make Nashville a safer and healthier community,” added Funk.\n\nThe Titans organization is committed to helping bring awareness to domestic violence and educating young people about making positive relationship choices in hopes of preventing future offenses.\n\nPlease also visit the Titan’s news page for more information.\n\nMarch 23, 2015 – Assistant DA Jan Norman Shares Thoughts on Vanderbilt Rape Case\n\nDuring January’s Vanderbilt rape trial, the spotlight was not only on the defendants but also the legal teams trying the case.\n\nAmong them was one woman, Assistant District Attorney Jan Norman, who became a prosecutor after discovering her career in sales wasn’t her true passion. Norman shared her thoughts with News 2 on the high-profile case that gained national attention.\n\n“I did have random people come up and say they saw me on TV,” she recalled. But for Norman, her focus was not on the cameras; it was on the jury and victim whose statement the she read with emotion at the end of the trial.\n\n“As I was reading it, I was thinking of her and her speaking those words which made it that much more meaningful to me,” Norman explained.\n\nNorman, a Brentwood native who graduated from Belmont University with a marketing degree, said after working a few years in sales she felt unfulfilled and decided to make a career change.“I think going late in life and having some work experience and life experience definitely helped,” she said. While in law school, Norman interned with the Davidson County DA’s office.\n\n“I knew 100 percent this is what I wanted to do,” she said. Since the end of the Vanderbilt trial, Norman said rape victims have reached out to her. “I get phone calls from rape victims, letters saying they were encouraged and inspired by it,” Norman said. Norman also said her position is her dream job, and she has no plans of leaving it anytime soon.\n\nFull Story on WKRN."
