Cancellations received after the close of business on February 10, 2025, must pay a $150 processing fee.\n\nThere will be no refunds for cancellation after February 17, 2025, or for non-attendance at the Institute. If registration fees are not paid prior to the cancellation or no-show, you will be billed. Cancellations must be received in writing by mail or email (lmartinez@ou.edu). Telephone cancellations are not accepted.\n\nBy registering for this event, you have agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nDirectory Information\n\nWe attach great importance to protecting our attendees' personal data and maintaining privacy. We will not sell your personal information to outside parties. Attendees' directory information will only be shared with participants of the event, including other attendees, exhibitors and sponsors. By registering for this conference, you consent to the use of your directory information.\n\nPhoto Release\n\nI understand that while at the event or its related activities I may be photographed or videotaped. I agree to allow my name, photo, video, or film likeness or reproductions thereof made through any media, including electronic media, to be used for any legitimate purpose, including but not limited to use on a website, social media, or brochure. To the fullest extent allowed by law, I hereby grant a non-exclusive, royalty free right to use my name and likeness to the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma. I am legally competent to agree to this Release.\n\nDietary Restrictions and Food Allergies\n\nAttendees with special dietary needs that are medically necessary have the responsibility to make the University of Oklahoma event staff aware of their needs. Event staff will use reasonable efforts to pass special needs information on to the hotel or catering staff regarding food allergies and dietary restrictions. The hotel or caterer is solely responsible for the food preparation, and the university has no control other than to confirm with the hotel that they have been made aware of the special dietary needs and are accommodating the need.\n\nBecause of the number of meals served and the number of items used each day, along with food product changes from food vendors, it cannot be guaranteed that every allergen in the food served will be identified and labeled. Attendees acknowledge and understand that there is a possibility of cross-contamination of food prepared in the hotel or caterer's kitchen, and attendees agree to assume the risk. The university cannot assume any liability for adverse reactions to food consumed or items one may come in contact with while eating at the event. Attendees with life-threatening food allergies who may need to use an Epi-Pen or other similar treatment should be carrying their own and be able to administer them. University event staff are not trained to administer Epi-Pens and cannot provide or administer them.\n\nAttendee acknowledges that there are certain risks of physical injury or illness associated with consumption of food at the event, up to and including death. Attendee acknowledges and hereby states that participation in this Activity is entered into as a free and voluntary act. By clicking \"I Agree\" below to agree to these terms and conditions, Attendee hereby releases the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, its employees, and agents from any liability whatsoever related to any adverse reaction to food consumed or which attendee came in contact with while at the event. Attendee understands that by agreeing to these terms, attendee gives up substantial legal rights that attendee may otherwise have to recover damages. Please email Lily Martinez at lmartinez@ou.edu for any special dietary needs."
