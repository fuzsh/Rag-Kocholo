        "text": "Beryl moves away from Jamaica as a hurricane warning is issued in Cozumel, Mexico\n\nAt 11 p.m. ET, the center of Hurricane Beryl was 160 miles southeast of Grand Cayman, with maximum winds of 130 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles.\n\nSome weakening is forecast in the next day or two. But Beryl is forecast to be at or near major hurricane intensity when it passes the Cayman Islands on Thursday.\n\nMexico has issued a Hurricane Warning for Cozumel. It has also upgraded the Tropical Storm Watch to a Tropical Storm Warning from Progreso to Campeche.\n\nAmerican family rides out Beryl at Montego Bay resort\n\nCurtis Kitchen from Olathe, Kansas, is riding out Hurricane Beryl in Montego Bay, Jamaica.\n\nKitchen said his family traveled there yesterday and decided to continue with their vacation plans.\n\nBut the calm weather quickly took a turn for the worse, Kitchen shared in video updates on X.\n\nThe first video Kitchen shared Wednesday morning showed trees gently swaying in winds with grey skies above, but the conditions progressively worsened. Later in the day, heavy rains and high winds wrecked havoc on the lively vacation spot, powerfully swaying trees and soaking the resort.\n\nThe Hilton Rose Hall Resort, where he and his family are staying, communicated with the guests and prepared for the hurricane, he said.\n\nTexas governor readies state to deploy resources for possible impacts from Beryl\n\nOfficials in Texas are preparing to potentially feel some of the impacts of Beryl over the weekend and into Monday.\n\nTexas Gov. Gregg Abbott directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to issue an advisory notice to various emergency management agencies to put response plans in place, according to an X post from the governor.\n\nAs state and local officials monitor weather conditions, the notice is to make sure that resources are ready to be deployed if they are needed, the governor said.\n\nTracking Beryl: The National Hurricane Center’s forecast calls for Beryl to restrengthen as it tracks across the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend before making landfall Sunday night in far northeastern Mexico.\n\nBut the NHC’s forecast cone, which represents where the center of a cyclone is likely to stay 60 to 70% of the time, encapsulates much of southern Texas early next week. Some current forecast model solutions take Beryl right into Mexico, some shift it into Texas and some point it toward other parts of the US.\n\nJamaican prime minister urges residents to comply with evacuation orders as Beryl creeps closer\n\nJamaica’s prime minister is asking everyone on the island to comply with evacuation orders as Hurricane Beryl closes in.\n\nThe storm’s center is expected to pass just south of — but very close to — Jamaica early this afternoon and will bring with it hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge.\n\nHe also told people living in low-lying areas to move to higher ground or a shelter, even if they are not currently under an evacuation notice. This also includes residents in areas that are “historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully,” Holness said.\n\nHere’s a look at the latest location of the storm:\n\nVideo from Phoenix couple riding out the hurricane in Jamaica shows strong winds at their resort\n\nRobert Pfeifer and his wife Tami, who are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary at the Sandals Ochi resort in Ocho Rios on the north coast of Jamaica, are hunkering down as Hurricane Beryl closes in on the Caribbean island.\n\nPfeifer captured video at about 8 a.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) and said the wind and rain had picked up dramatically since then.\n\nPfeifer said he and his wife were enjoying some time outside before the storm kicked up and they had to take shelter in their room. They arrived in Jamaica on Saturday and are scheduled to return home on July 6. He said flights were already being canceled when they looked into going home early.\n\nThe couple had never been through a hurricane before, but he thought the resort staff were doing a good job preparing for Hurricane Beryl.\n\n“They’ve boarded up a lot of the windows. They actually came in all the rooms last night and gave everybody like a snack pack to keep in their room with chips and extra extra drinks and everything. And, you know, I guess the plan is to kind of just write it out,” he said.\n\nPfeifer said they went into town on Tuesday and said it looked like local residents were stocking up on supplies because they saw a lot of empty shelves at the grocery store.\n\nWatch Pfeifer’s video of the storm here.\n\nHurricane warning issued for parts of Mexico\n\nA hurricane warning is now in effect for part of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun. A hurricane watch is in effect from north of Cancun to Cabo Catoche and from south of Puerto Costa Maya to Chetumal.\n\nBeryl is expected to impact the region late Thursday and Friday.\n\nStorm nears Jamaica: Beryl remains a dangerous Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 145 mph. The hurricane is tracking to the west-northwest at 18 mph and is located 75 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nBeryl’s center is expected to pass just south of — but very close to — Jamaica early this afternoon. Tropical storm-force winds have spread over the eastern half of the island and hurricane-force winds will likely arrive in the next hour or two.\n\n“The next 48 hours is going to be a telling one for the country,\" Jamaican government official says\n\nJamaica’s Minister of Local Government and Community Development, Desmond McKenzie says the country is well prepared for Hurricane Beryl, with over 870 shelters activated and emergency services ready to respond, but has warned “the next 48 hours is going to be a telling one for the country.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Max Foster, McKenzie described the incoming hurricane as the first major hurricane the nation has had in 40 years.\n\n“The country is ready,” he said, asserting that he was “quite sure that the great majority of Jamaicans will heed to the call” to follow government instructions and stay safe.\n\nMcKenzie said climate change was “contributing significantly to what we are experiencing today,” adding that “as a small island state we are subjected to what the greater world around us is presenting,” he said.\n\nBut, he asserted that the country knew the challenges that faced them and was ready to do so.\n\nTropical storm-force winds are now hitting Jamaica\n\nSustained tropical storm-force winds arrived in eastern Jamaica a short time ago, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s unclear how strong the winds are currently because they are occurring on a part of the island where there are no weather observations to verify them. Tropical storm-force winds range from 39 to 73 mph by definition.\n\nThe winds will spread over Jamaica throughout the morning as Beryl tracks closer to the country. Hurricane-force sustained winds of at least 74 mph will arrive in the early afternoon and are forecast to pound the country until at least midnight.\n\nBeryl will deal a devastating blow to Jamaica even if it doesn't make landfall\n\nHurricane Beryl could just miss a direct landfall in Jamaica, according to the latest forecast track from the National Hurricane Center, but the island will face the same devastating conditions regardless.\n\nThe forecast track wobbled slightly south Wednesday after trending north on Tuesday, meaning the hurricane’s center could track just south of Jamaica instead.\n\nAt least half of the hurricane’s center needs to cross over land in order for an official landfall to occur, but Beryl’s strongest winds extend 45 miles from its center. So, even if its center tracks just south of Jamaica, much of the island will endure powerful and perhaps destructive winds. The winds will also push water onshore and could generate up to 9 feet of storm surge when Beryl makes its closest approach this afternoon.\n\nBeryl will also unload torrential rainfall that could trigger mudslides in the country’s higher terrain and more widespread flash flooding. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are likely over Jamaica with some spots potentially recording close to a foot of rain.\n\nFor context: Only two hurricanes have made landfall in Jamaica in the last 40 years: Sandy in 2012 and Gilbert in 1988. No hurricane as strong as Beryl has even come close to Jamaica’s shores since Dean — a Category 4 hurricane — passed just south of the country in 2007.\n\nIn pictures: Beryl leaves a trail of destruction across southeast Caribbean islands\n\nHouses have been torn down, with only the foundations left standing, as Hurricane Beryl swept across the southeastern Caribbean on Tuesday.\n\nThe island of Carriacou in Grenada, as well as St. Vincent and the Grenadines, saw the most severe damage from Beryl. Satellite imagery shows the storm wiped away broad swaths of several islands.\n\nHere is what that devastation looks like on the ground:\n\nAnd this is the view of Carriacou from above:\n\nHurricane Beryl is hurtling toward Jamaica. Here’s the latest\n\nHurricane Beryl has left at least seven people dead and countless homes and buildings destroyed as it churns through the Caribbean – and its journey is far from over.\n\nThe storm is likely to slam into Jamaica’s shoreline later Wednesday as a major hurricane, meaning Category 3 or higher, according to the National Hurricane Center. It would be only the third hurricane to make landfall on the island in 40 years.\n\nHere are the latest updates:\n\nWhere Beryl has been: The island of Carriacou in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines saw the most severe damage from Beryl. Satellite imagery shows the storm wiped away broad swaths of several islands. At least seven people were killed in the two nations and Venezuela. Damage has also been reported on the island of Petite Martinique and in Barbados.\n\nWhere it is headed: Jamaica’s prime minister urged residents to take Beryl “seriously” and prepare for the storm’s likely landfall Wednesday afternoon. Storm surge on the island could rise up to 9 feet above normal tide levels. The Cayman Islands could also see tropical storm conditions by Wednesday afternoon. Beryl’s exact track becomes slightly less certain Thursday night and beyond. It is expected to make landfall somewhere along Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula or northern Belize on Thursday night or Friday morning. In Texas, emergency officials are monitoring how the state’s southern coast will be impacted.\n\nJamaica under nationwide curfew: Jamaicans have been scrambling to stockpile food and gas and secure their homes in anticipation of Beryl’s arrival. The prime minister has declared a nationwide curfew Wednesday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. “to ensure the safety of everyone during the passage of the storm” and prevent activity such as looting.\n\nCalls for climate action: Some Jamaican officials have pointed to Hurricane Beryl as the latest example of how developing countries bear the brunt of the climate crisis – the primary driver for increasingly extreme natural disasters. Delroy Williams, a government senator, called on the international community to increase coastal cities’ funding for climate change resiliency.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen delivering aid to hard-hit Union Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nThe non-profit World Central Kitchen has begun delivering food and water to Union Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines after it was decimated by Hurricane Beryl.\n\n“We are mobilizing across the Caribbean to access the hardest hit islands to get some support to the community here that has experienced a Category 4 storm,” the WCK’s Melissa Gluck said in a video message shot from the island and posted on the nonprofit’s X account.\n\nThe team reached the location via helicopter and was able to deliver fruit, water and sandwiches, she said.\n\n“There’s lots of destruction, there’s no electricity, power, water,” Gluck said, showing damaged homes and downed trees in the area.\n\nUnion Island, with around 3,000 residents, is a small island only 3 miles long and approximately 1 mile wide, according to the island’s information center.\n\nThe country’s Prime Minister, Ralph Gonsalves, said Monday that Union Island was devastated by Beryl with reports indicating 90% of homes on the island have been “severely damaged or destroyed.”\n\nWorld Central Kitchen founder José Andrés said in a separate post that the organization is delivering aid to multiple islands that were hit by Beryl.\n\nJamaican senator calls for climate action as Beryl looms\n\nBeryl is the fiercest hurricane Jamaica has faced in a “very long time,” Delroy Williams, a government senator, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nHeavy rains often lead to landslides in Jamaica, particularly in its rural areas, and the country’s prime minister announced a nearly $2 million emergency assistance fund earlier today, Williams said.\n\nBeryl is expected to make landfall in Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nWilliams said the hurricane should also compel additional action on climate change.\n\n“It’s only July. It’s pretty early for us to experience a hurricane,” he said. “It’s alarming.”\n\nThe international community has made some progress, he said, but low-lying coastal cities like his will — and already are — bearing the brunt of the effects of a warming planet.\n\nBeryl should signal to the international community that they must “step up efforts” to widen coastal cities’ access to climate change-related funding and “address the issue of infrastructure” in cities like his, Williams said.\n\nHere is Hurricane Beryl's predicted path this week\n\nHurricane Beryl slightly weakened Tuesday night to top winds of 150 mph, though it is still a powerful Category 4 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory.\n\n“Beryl is expected to continue to gradually weaken for the next day or two but is still forecast to be at or near a major hurricane when it passes near Jamaica on Wednesday and near the Cayman Islands on Wednesday night,” the agency warned.\n\nHurricane watches have been issued for the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche. A tropical storm watch has also been issued by the government of Belize from south of Chetuman to Belize City.\n\nA Hurricane watch means hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area, according to the NHC, and a tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area.\n\nHere’s where Beryl’s forecasted impact in the coming days:\n\nJamaica\n\nHurricane conditions: Beginning late Wednesday morning, Beryl could make landfall or a close pass to Jamaica’s coastline\n\nStorm Surge: 5 -8 feet above normal tide levels along the coast\n\nRainfall: 4-8 inches across the island, with 12 inches possible in some areas\n\nCayman Islands\n\nHurricane conditions: Wednesday night or early Thursday\n\nTropical storm conditions: Wednesday afternoon\n\nStorm Surge: 2-4 feet above normal tide levels\n\nRainfall: 2-4 inches with amounts up to 6 inches on Wednesday and Thursday\n\nYucatan Peninsula\n\nHurricane conditions: Late Thursday\n\nPotential Landfall: Late Thursday or early Friday as a Category 1 storm\n\nAdditional Details: The storm will weaken to a tropical storm as it moves through the peninsula Friday. The bulk of the tropical storm conditions are expected to wrap up by the end of the day Friday.\n\nHispaniola\n\nTropical storm conditions: Late Tuesday through Wednesday\n\nStorm Surge: 1-3 feet above normal tide levels\n\nRainfall: 4-8 inches with some amounts up to 12 inches across the southwestern Haitian Peninsula through late Wednesday, while 4 -8 inches of rain with isolated amounts of 10 inches are expected across Barahona Peninsula in southwest Dominican Republic. Isolated totals of 6 inches or more are also anticipated across the mountainous terrain in the central Dominican Republic.\n\nBelize\n\nTropical storm conditions: Late Thursday or early Friday\n\nCarnival and Norwegian Cruise Line alter ships' courses as Hurricane Beryl passes through Caribbean\n\nCruise lines are altering some of their ships’ courses in the Caribbean as Hurricane Beryl barrels through the region.\n\nCarnival Cruise Line said Tuesday it was changing the original trajectories of two of its active cruises – Carnival Horizon and Carnival Liberty.\n\nCarnival Horizon, originally scheduled to make port at Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, on July 3, canceled the visit. Its scheduled trip to Cozumel, Mexico, on July 4 was also replaced with a visit to Nassau, Bahamas, on July 5.\n\nCarnival Liberty has sped up its scheduled July 5 to Cozumel to today, as the vessel attempts to avoid the hurricane’s forecasted path into the area.\n\nThe Norwegian Cruise Line altered routes for two cruises, Norwegian Jade and Norwegian Breakaway, with canceled visits to Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Belize and Cozumel and Costa Maya in Mexico.\n\n2 of Jamaica's main airports to close tonight ahead of Hurricane Beryl\n\nTwo main airports in Jamaica will close Tuesday night due to the impeding threats posed by Hurricane Beryl as it hurls toward the Caribbean country.\n\nJamaica’s largest airport, Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, will close temporarily at 11:59 p.m. local time and will remain closed throughout Wednesday to ensure safety, according to a press release from the airport.\n\nA comprehensive assessment will take place following the hurricane to determine when it’s safe to resume operations, the release said.\n\nNorman Manley International Airport in the country’s capital of Kingston will close at 10 p.m. local time on Tuesday night.\n\nWatch Beryl strengthen from tropical depression to Category 5 hurricane\n\nBeryl started from humble roots late last week before quickly becoming a monstrous hurricane and unleashing devastation this week.\n\nIts entire evolution was captured from space.\n\nThe satellite imagery below shows Beryl’s life so far, from its origins as Tropical Depression Two on Friday to its strike on the Windward Islands as a violent Category 4 hurricane Monday to its historic Category 5 strength Tuesday.\n\nIt’s currently a very strong Category 4 hurricane.\n\nHurricane hunter aircraft flies inside the eye of Beryl\n\nA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3d Orion hurricane hunter aircraft flies inside the eye of Hurricane Beryl over the Caribbean.\n\nNOAA Aircraft Operations Center tweeted the photos from #NOAA43, known as “Miss Piggy” on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHurricane Beryl is expected to make landfall in Jamaica on Wednesday. Here's the latest\n\nThe official forecast from the National Hurricane Center now shows the center of Beryl making landfall in southern Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nBeryl is forecast to be at least a Category 3 hurricane when it makes landfall on the southern coast of Jamaica Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. Tropical cyclones that reach at least Category 3 strength are considered major hurricanes.\n\nThis track shift will increase the impacts felt by those in Jamaica as the hurricane’s eyewall — where the strongest winds are located — will pass over land. Because of this, the storm surge forecast has also increased and now water levels could rise up to eight feet above normal tide levels Wednesday.\n\nThe Category 4 hurricane has already left many Caribbean islands battered.\n\nCatch up on the latest updates on the hurricane:\n\nBeryl remains a dangerous and powerful storm: Beryl remains a life-threatening hurricane as it churns in the Caribbean Sea, according to the National Hurricane Center. Although it was downgraded from Category 5 hurricane to Category 4 Tuesday afternoon, the storm still has sustained winds of 155 mph, just shy of the Category 5 threshold of 157 mph or greater.\n\nFatalities reported in islands hit by the storm: At least three people have died after Hurricane Beryl hit Carriacou and Petite Martinique, Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials say. There were two reported deaths in Carriacou and Petite Martinique, Grenada, the country’s Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said at a news conference on Tuesday, citing Tevin Andrews, minister of Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\n\nWhite House says it is ready to support US territories: The White House said on social media that it is ready to provide support to the people of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as Hurricane Beryl continues it’s path in the Caribbean. President Joe Biden, speaking at an event about extreme weather on Tuesday, said the people and communities hit by Beryl are “in our prayers.” The president also said the world needs to address the climate crisis as a cause of more extreme weather, including a more active and extreme hurricane season this year.\n\nGas prices in US could rise: Hurricane Beryl could contribute to slightly higher US gas prices in the coming days. The good news is that storm does not appear to pose a direct threat to US energy facilities in the region. Traders are betting that Beryl is an sign of an active 2024 hurricane season that will eventually impact US oil output or refinery activity.\n\nBiden says US ready to provide assistance to communities impacted by Beryl\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the United States is ready to provide assistance to places impacted by Hurricane Beryl as the Category 5 storm tracks toward Jamaica.\n\nThe president, speaking at an event about extreme weather on Tuesday, said the people and communities hit by Beryl are “in our prayers.”\n\nThe storm made landfall as a Category 4 on Monday on Carriacou island — part of the Caribbean nation of Grenada — which was “flattened” in half an hour, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said. Damage has also been reported on the island of Petite Martinique and in Barbados.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said the mammoth storm is expected to make landfall in southern Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nThe climate crisis: Biden said the globe needs to address the climate crisis as a cause of more extreme weather, including a more active and extreme hurricane season this year.\n\nPlanet-warming pollution is driving global and ocean temperatures and sea levels to rise, which is causing the impacts of hurricanes to become more dangerous. A warmer climate also means there will be more water vapor available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain.\n\nCNN’s Ritu Prasad contributed reporting.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional remarks from Biden.\n\nA major hurricane hasn’t struck Jamaica in more than three decades\n\nBeryl is forecast to be at least a Category 3 hurricane when it makes landfall on the southern coast of Jamaica Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. Tropical cyclones that reach at least Category 3 strength are considered major hurricanes.\n\nJamaica is no stranger to tropical cyclones, but the island’s size makes a direct hit from a tropical storm or hurricane even more rare. Only two hurricanes have made landfall in the country in the last 40 years: Sandy in 2012 and Gilbert in 1988.\n\nSandy was a Category 1 hurricane when it slammed into Jamaica in 2012. But 1988’s Gilbert is perhaps the most infamous storm Jamaica ever endured.\n\nGilbert roared ashore along Jamaica’s southern coast on September 12, 1988, packing sustained winds of 130 mph, making it a Category 4 by today’s standards. The hurricane inflicted catastrophic damage that totaled at least $2 billion at the time and led to the deaths of at least 45 people.\n\nNotably, the “B” storm name for 1988’s Atlantic hurricane season was also dubbed Beryl. It formed in August, reached tropical storm strength and made landfall in Louisiana.\n\nIt’s more common for tropical cyclones to track near Jamaica and lash the island with strong winds and torrential rainfall without directly striking the country. Seven named cyclones have passed within 100 miles of Jamaica since the 2020 hurricane season: 2020’s Laura, Nana and Delta; 2021’s Elsa, Grace and Ida; and 2022’s Lisa.\n\nWhite House says it is ready to support Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands\n\nThe White House said on social media that it is ready to provide support to the people of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as Hurricane Beryl is expected to make landfall in Jamaica tomorrow and impact surrounding areas.\n\nThe hurricane has already caused significant destruction and at least three people have died as a result of the storm.\n\nIn a post on X, the White House said President Joe Biden is monitoring the hurricane “closely” and has told US Agency for International Development and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prepare “resources, partners and staff.”\n\nHeavy rainfall and storm surge expected in Jamaica on Wednesday\n\nHurricane Beryl is expected to cause life-threatening winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall as it heads to Jamaica on Wednesday, according to a news release from Jamaica’s Meteorological Service on Tuesday.\n\nAverage winds of at least 74 mph are expected, the release said.\n\nA combination of dangerously high water and exceptionally high waves along coastal areas are to be expected as well, the meteorological service reports.\n\nAs the eye of the hurricane moves closer to Jamaica, heavy rainfall will start early on Wednesday. A hurricane warning remains in effect for the country.\n\nUN climate chief has been unable to contact his family on island struck by Hurricane Beryl\n\nThe UN’s climate chief said that his home island of Carriacou, part of the Caribbean nation of Grenada, was “flattened” on Monday by Hurricane Beryl and that he had been unable to speak with family members there by phone for 24 hours as lines were cut.\n\n“But through social media, through other avenues, the picture is starting to form. My immediate family is safe, but the island is devastated,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told CNN’s Becky Anderson in an interview Tuesday.\n\n“The eye of Hurricane Beryl struck my particular island, which is Carriacou — which is a 13 square-mile island, a population of 10,000 people — the eye, the most intense part of the hurricane struck yesterday morning local time. [The] island has been flattened. The reports that are coming out show a very, very distressing signal,” the UN official added.\n\nStiell said the people on the island had experienced a “traumatic” event and will have months of challenges ahead as entire buildings were destroyed with their roofs blown off, with more storms to come. Stiell’s late grandmother’s home was among those destroyed and his parents’ home was severely damaged.\n\nThe UN official called on rich countries and the G20 nations — which together account for 80% of the global carbon pollution that is rapidly heating the planet — to provide finance and technological solutions for developing nations."
