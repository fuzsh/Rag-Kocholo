At the pub and a nearby market, he was seen with the victim, just hours before ethe murder, by at least twenty eye-witnesses, some of whom he had spoken to, even giving them details about his life. As the case stalled, once again, a strangler had vanished into thin air, and the murders would stop…\n\n…but only in Soho.\n\n300 miles north of London, another murder and an attempted murder or two prostitutes in very similar circumstances would lead the Police to a very likely suspect in the murder of French Marie.\n\nBut was he The Soho Strangler?\n\nDate: Monday 16th August 1937\n\nLocation: 2nd Floor, 306 Euston Road, NW1 (now demolished)\n\nVictim: 1 (Lottie Asterley, alias 'French Marie/Suzette')\n\nCLICK HEREto download the Murder Mile podcast via iTunes and to receive the latest episodes, click \"subscribe\". You can listen to it by clicking PLAY on the embedded media player below.\n\nTHE LOCATION\n\nAs many photos of the case are copyright protected by greedy news organisations, to view them, take a peek at my entirely legal social media accounts - Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.\n\nThe location is marked with a purple exclamation mark (!) above the words 'Euston Square'.
