Prendergast, UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs\n\nNena Messina, UCLA Drug Abuse Research Center\n\nWilliam M. Burdon, UCLA Drug Abuse Research Center\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify critical factors that are related to the reincarceration rates of men and women offenders who paroled from prison TC treatment programs. Extensive treatment intake interviewed data for 4,509 women and 3,595 men from 15 prison-based TCs in California was compared using chi-square analyses, t-tests, and logistic regression analyses. Intake data come from a five-year process and outcome evaluation of the California Department of Corrections’ Prison Treatment Expansion Initiative. The return-to-custody data come from the CDCs Offender Based Information System (OBIS). Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for men and women to indicate which factors were associated with a return-to-custody within 12-months from parole. Results show that drug-dependent men and womdn differ with regard to their employment histories, substance abuse problems, criminal involvement, psychological functioning, and sexual and physical abuse histories prior to incarceration. After controlling for these baseline differences between men and women, preliminary regression findings showed that psychological impairment was the strongest predictor of recidivism for both men and women. Preliminary findings indicate the need for a more comprehensive psychological assessment at intake to assess the diverse psychological needs of drug-dependent offenders.\n\n#13675-058 … But You Can Call Me Andrew: Doing Federal Time\n\nAndrew Ferguson, Federal Correctional Institution\n\nBarbara H. Zaitzow, Appalachian State University\n\nMost Americans never see, let alone become ensnarled in, the nation’s vast correctional system. But the unprecedented prison boom is incurring unprecedented costs — economic, social, and ethical — that are being paid, one way or another, by everyone in this country. Despite the fact that over 160,000 people are locked up in federal correctional facilities, information about the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (FBOP or BOP) clientel — and otheir “inside” experiences — remains elusive. This paper is the second in a series in which the “coing time” story of a former law enforcement officer, recipient of a graduate degree, and “resident” of the federal prison system is shared with the “free” world.\n\n18th Century Privacy, 21st Century Technology\n\nMichael E. Buerger, Bowling Green State University\n\nThomas J. Cowper, New York State Police\n\nThe modern understanding of privacy is undergoing severe strain as advancing technology and rules of law diminish sphers formerly thought of as protected. Though as recently as Kyllo the Supreme Court anchored privacy expectations in the era of the American Constitutional Convention, emerging technological capabilities in both the public and private sector have eroded the practical expectation of privacy in many venues. The new authority of government to gather information and maintain it in the wake of the Patriot Act, the creation of DNA databases, the issues related to voluntary surrender of otherwise protected information in order to obtain services from the private sector, and the associated downstream uses of purchased data, all call into questions whether anything remotely resembling the Founding Fathers’ vision of privacy can be maintained in the 21st century. This paper explores those issues and their offshoots, such as identity theft, call sfor a national identity card, and whether or not there is any effective defense at law or in practice against an increasingly intrusive technological age.\n\nA\n\nA Changing Drug Market: The Impact on Patterns of Heroin Use\n\nAlan Neaigus, N.D.R.I., Inc.\n\nAlice Cepeda, University of Houston\n\nAvelardo Valdez, University of Houston\n\nThis paper explores the changing drug market scence and its impact on heroin use patterns in a South Texas Mexican American urban community. This research is based on qualitative data gathered from a NIDA funded study examining 300 Mexican American non-injecting drug users in San Antonio, Texas. Selected contextual factors specific to Mexican Americans related to increased use of non-injecting heroin use and transitioning to injecting will be examined. This paper will focus on how distribution and retailing practices initiated by adult prison gangs made available powdered heroin as opposed to black tar. As well, discussed is how these practices changed the social perception of heroin use among non-heroin polydrug users. Findings reveal the importance ine xamining contextual variations in the risk of transitioning to injecting. This growth in NIUs in this community has serious consequences for controlling increases in IDU and the spread of HIV, and other blood born pathogens associated with injectors.\n\nA Chinese Birth Cohort: Theoretical Implications\n\nElmar Weitekamp, Catholic University of Leuven\n\nHans-Jergen Kerner, University of Tuebingen\n\nPaul C. Friday, Univ. of North Carolina at Charlotte\n\nTerrance J. Taylor, Georgia State University\n\nXin Ren, California State University – Sacramento\n\nThis is an analysis of a Chinese birth cohort born in 1973. Looking at basic demographic data, interviews and police report data on criminal and public security violations, this paper analyzes the results and puts them into a theoretical context of delinquency theory.\n\nA Common Explanation of the Changing Age Distributions of Suicide and Homicide in the United States: 1930 to 2000\n\nBob O’Brien, University of Oregon\n\nJean Stockard, University of Oregon\n\nThis paper addresses shifts in the age distributions of homicide deaths and suicides in the United States from 1930 to 2000. The data are disaggregated by race (white non-white) and sex. It is shown that shifts in the age distributions of suicide and homicide deaths over this period are closely related. Two characteristics of birth cohorts explain much of this relationship. We set our work within a Durkhemian framework and argue, contrary to Durkheim, but in agreement with most criminologists, that both suicide and homicide are positively related to “egoism.” The paper provides a bridge between the work of suicidologists and criminologists.\n\nA Comparative Analysis of Commercial Sex: Implications for Theory and Policy\n\nAlan Dudley Brown III, University of Oklahoma\n\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a background to the various theories concerning commercial sex. Using a comparative perspective that examines differences in the Netherlands, United States and canada, I will examine policy and socio-cultural differences between the three. Of particular interest are issues of gender (young male hustlers), sexuality (transgender and queer individuals) and national origin and migration (both voluntary and forced). It is argued that a more dense theoretical perspective is needed to develop appropriate criminal justice responses.\n\nA Comparative Study of the Implementation Process of the Comstat Approach Between the Newark Police Department, U.S. and the Military Police Department in Belo Horizonte, Brazil\n\nElenice de Souza, Rutgers University\n\nThe Comstat model has been identified as one of the most important reasons for the efficacy of the NYPD on crime reduction in New York City. As a result, the Comstat model has been implemented by many police departments in the U.S. and other countries. The current study aims at comparing the implementation of the Comstat approach between the Newark Police Department, New Jersey, U.S. and the Military Police Department in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The main goal is examine the effectiveness of the Comstat approach in crim prevention and problem solving and its impact on organizational behavior and police accountability at the police precinct ledvel. Belo Horizonte is the first city to adopt the Comstat approach from the United States in the Military Police Department in Brazil where it has been operating since 2000. Research data were collected from secondary sources, such as police records and crime reports. Additional data include systematic and ethnographic observations of police activity, regular attendance at the Comstat meetings, community meetings, and interviews with the command staff, patrol officers, and detectives in both police departments in the study. The impact of the Comstat model on police across culture, its strengths and weaknesses on crime prevention and reduction will be discussed. Police implications for both cities are recommended.\n\nA Comparison of Prospective and Retrospective Reports of Child Abuse\n\nCathy Spatz Widom, New Jersey Medical School (UMDNJ)\n\nHelene Raskin White, Rutgers University\n\nPing Hsin-Chen, UMDNJ – New Jersey Medical School\n\nMost studies of child abuse have not collected prospective data. Instead they have waited until adulthood to collect measures of abuse and neglect and have used these data to conduct analyses examining the effects of childhood victimization. The validity of the results from these retrospective studies is questionable and few prospective studies have assessed the accuracy of recall. In this study, we make use of unique data from a longitudinal study of adolescents and young adults to examine how well individuals can recollect parenting behavior, discipline practices, physical abuse and sexual experiences and abuse. Data were collected as part of the Rutgers Health and Human Development project, a prospective cohort-sequential, longitudinal study of adolescent development. The sample for the present analysis consists of 374 men and women who were interviewed five times between the ages of 12 years and 30/31 years. Overall, the data indicate weak reliability for recall of parenting behaviors and at best moderate reliability for recall of discipline practices and physical abuse. Reliability of recall of the timing of sexual experiences is high, although actual reports of sexual abuse have low reliability. Results from studies based on retrospective accounts of physical and sexual abuse should be interpreted with caution.\n\nA Comparison of the Criminal Justice Systems of Malaysia and the United States\n\nCarol Veneziano, Southeast Missouri State University\n\nLouis Veneziano, Southeast Missouri State University\n\nSuria Idris, Southeast Missouri State University\n\nAlthough countries may differ in terms of their social, economic, and political institutions, it has been argued that their criminal justice systems are similarly structured. Regardless of the distinguishing and unique features of a given country’s culture, its criminal justice system is designed to accomplish the same goals: (1) protect society from criminal perpetrators; (2) punish those who have violated its criminal laws; (3) attempt to achieve the goals of general deterrence, specific deterrence, incapacitation, restitution, and retribution; and (4) provide offenders with opportunities to turn themselves into productive, law-abiding citizens. This study was conducted to determine whether the criminal justice system in Malaysia conformed to this idea concerning these so-called universal goals and practices. Malaysia is a developing country with a diverse population. In its bid for modernization, Malaysia has moved toward a market economy, an unfortunate byproduct of which has been increased criminal activity. The results indicated that despite numerous cultural differences between Malaysia and the United States, the criminal justice systems of both countries were remarkably similar, providing support for the contention that ciminal justice systems largely reflect universal goals and practices.\n\nA Contest for Post-Colonial African Optimisin in Criminology\n\nIhekwoaba D. Onwudiwe, University of Maryland Eastern Shore\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of afro-optimism and afrenaisance regarding the practice of criminology, democracy, and justice in post-colonial Africa. In addition to defining and providing a context for new terms, the present work emphasizes the intellectual necessity to illuminate Africa’s reality in criminology in ways that counter colonial inaccuracies.\n\nA Critical Evaluation of Routine Activities Theory\n\nKatie Otermat, University of South Florida\n\nLaura Brandow (Hanson), University of South Florida\n\nIn the criminological discipline, the Routine Activities approach was originally set forth by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson (1979) and his highly recognized by researchers and practitioners alike. Routine Activities is a theory of crime, which looks at the convergence of a motivated offender, suitable target, and a lack of guardianship coming together in space and time to produce a criminal act. This theory has transcended from basic to applied research and from empirical testing to implementation in the criminal justice system. Our research intends to critically evaluate this approach, concentrating on some of the gaps and inconsistencies in it.\n\nA Critical Examination of Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse Enforcement in America\n\nSamantha Gwinn, SDPD Crime Analysis\n\nPrescription drug abuse is an epidemic that is present in virtually every neighborhood across America. Although the effects can be physically and financially devastating, this problem is seldom discussed or addressed by the greater law enforcement community. While illicit drug addicts end up in prison for drug-related crimes, prescription drug abusers are typically wealthy or middle-class people who will most likely end up in rehab instead of in jail. The physical and psychological effects of prescription drugs and illicit drugs are almost identical, but these two groups are treated differently by law enforcement and by society in general. This paper is a critical examiunation of drug abuse enforcement, and the possible causes for differential treatment of various types of drugs, both historically and presently. The analysis of current enforcement patterns includes the use of GIS to illustrate the socio-economic characteristics of the areas of San Diego in which the two types of addicts reside.\n\nA Deal With the Devil: Operation Underworld, Governor Dewey, Lucky Luciano, and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics\n\nJohn C. McWilliams, Pennsylvania State University\n\nIn the spring of 1954, while the nation’s attention was riveted to the nationally televised and emotionally charged Army-McCarthy hearings, another investigation, conducted in secrecy, was underway in Albany, New York. In response to continued criticism of his decision to commute Lucky Luciano’s 30-to-50-year sentence based on the gangster’s alleged cooperation with naval officials, Governor Thomas E. Dewey appointed the state commissioner of investigations to conduct a formal inquiry to determine the nature, extent, and value of Luciano’s contribution to the Navy’s “Operation Underworld” to protect the Brooklyn waterfront from possible sabotage attacks. Using recently declassified Federal Bureau of Narcotics files at the National Archives, testimony provided during the investigation, and other primary source material, this paper assesses the validity of Dewey’s allegation and the impact of the unprecedented secret collaboration between organized crime and the federal government.\n\nA Further Understanding of School Disorder\n\nAnthony A. Peguero, University of Miami\n\nWithin recent years, the social perception of school violence as an epidemic has inspired school administrators to create and implement programs and curriculum to address this social problem (Kolbe, Kann and Brener, 2001). These programs have suggested that the key to reducing the dilemma of school violence is placed upon the school (i.e. teachers, counselors and administrators) to create safe, healthy and quality schools (Verdugo and Schneider, 1999). With that, school level factors have theoretically and empirically acquired more focus as influential upon level violence, deviance and crime within their school walls. Traditionally, the hypothesis has generally been upon the influence of the student or the broader institutional (e.g. conflict theorists) forces that help create unsafe schools. But, with the growing attention on schools themselves playing an important role that mediates between the insittution and individual, the characteristics of the school’s culture (Hoy and Miskel, 1991) and level of disorder (Welsh, 2000) have become increasingly important. Drawing from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), this research will further investigate the influences of school climate upon high school students’ standardized test scores. The NELS data set is an ongoing longitudinal project of the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. NELS represents the educational experience of youth that spans from 1988 to 2000. The purpose of this research is to conduct a preliminary investigation of school disorder influencing the individual educational achievement (i.e., standardized test scores).\n\nA Geographic and Contextual Analysis of Illegal Drug Sales\n\nAnthony J. Luongo, Temple University\n\nDrawing on the theoretical statements and empirical findings of Rengert (1989,1996), Eck (1994) and Weisburd and Green (1995), this research examines the interface between the built environment and its geographic context on the level of illegal drug sales. The analyses will build upon the understanding of how urban spatial structures and the location of facilities of a class are not equally innocuous or noxious within their geographic context and how these spatial elements may be realted to drug sales arrests. These relationships are explored using data from the Wilmington, Delaware Police Department’s arrest and call for service records for the years 1990, 1991, and 1992. The implications of these findings for the reduction of illegal drug markets and on urban planning are discussed.\n\nA Good Place To Do Time\n\nKenneth D. Jensen, Western Oregon University\n\nIn the Oregon State Penitentiary of the 1970’s it was not uncommon to hear seasoned “cons” express the opinion that “Oregon was a good place to do time.” The meaning and implications of this quote is considered against the background of three decades of state and national corrections policy. The policy changes of three decades will be analyzed and critiqued.\n\nA Human Rights Framework for Assessing Moral Bases of Law and Home-Land Defenses\n\nJudge Bankole Thompson, Eastern Kentucky University\n\nThomas Edward Reed, Eastern Kentucky University\n\nNo adequate consensus exists on two critical issues in our post-9-11-01 world: the moral bases of law and viable assessment criteria. In response to these fuzzy legal-moral conditions and their implications for U.S. and other nations’ homeland defenses, a human-rights frame conception of knowledge guides the advocacy of three assessment criteria. (a) Emerging but varied degrees of consensus within international and human rights law provide a basis for assessing the legality and fairness of any offensive or defensive actions. These rule-of-law standards are at least partially independent of national biases and the eroding doctrine of soverign immunity. (b) A full-person identity prototype of persons as neurobiological, social-civil, and mental-spiritual beings describes three universal human-identity dimensions that often can be assessed by verifiable empirical data. Baseline interdisciplinary knowledge about these human dimensions provides criteria for assessing identity-biased laws, actions, and ideologies that deviate from our shared genotypic identies and threaten human rights to existence, self-determination, and development. (c) Human-rights criticality addresses the need to motivate persons morally when democratic ideals require personal sacrifices or revolutionary changs in perceptions, values, and priorities. This criterion builds on an established criticality methodology: It can be used to discover and assess actions or moral beliefs that threaten the world-order ideals and priorities expressed in Article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nA Kinder Gentler SWAT?\n\nJennifer Bader, University of Colorado at Denver\n\nMarcy Becker, University of Colorado at Denver\n\nMary Dodge, University of Colorado at Denver\n\nSpecial Weapons and Tactical Teams (SWAT) are militaristic units established within law enforcement agencies to handle high risk, crisis situations. Efforts to integrate community policing philosophies and displace ninja warrior perspectives often held by the public have resulted in new acronyms designed to soften the image. This research, however, shows that SWAT training and procedures have switched to a more proactive, aggressive approach. In light of the fallout from incidents like Colorado’s Columbine shooting and the World Trade Center incident many teams have shunned the idea that SWAT members could change expectations of their identity. The elite, masculine image has become reinforced as training standards have been heightened to emphasize rapid deployment, rigid physical fitness requirements, and weapon mastery. The bonding among officers is unique to the position and dominated by male imagery. This research presents qualitative data from interviews with active SWAT officers on the subculture, skills, and qualities necessary to perform the job.\n\nA Legal and Policy Argument for Bail Denial and Preventative Treatment for Batterers\n\nDawn Beichner, Illinois State University\n\nRobbin S. Ogle, University of Nebraska – Lincoln\n\nHistorically, battering has been a culturally and legally accepted practice in the U.S. This has had an influence on the crimninal justice and social system’s approach to dealing with battering and its victims. Beginning in the mids 1800s, women fronm the women’s movement and the temmperance movement starting bring attention to the practice of battering and its ill effects on women and children. Their approach consisted mainly of unheeded calls for battering to be outlawed and scattered group efforts to provide shelter and medical care for victims. In the 1970s, when battering was finally criminalized in the U.S., our approach to dealing with this issue continued to involve piece meal efforts aimed at shelter and medical care. Today, battering is minimally a misdemeanor crime, however our approach to dealing with battering and its aftermath have not changed much. We still primarily rely on private and/or social helping agencies inadequately prepared but intended to hide and assist victims until the offender is incarcerated or at least adjudicated. The law enforcement approach has changed from verbal deescalation to arrest. However, research as yet does not support the efficacy of this auto arrest policy. This paper argues that it may be time to take a more proactive policy approach that spends more money on prevention and treatment than on housing and providing for victims whose lives are as disrupted by our solution as they are by this social problem. Removal of one batterer from the home is less expensive to the system than removal of multiple victims and this would be less disruptive to the lives of children involved in these unions. This could be done utilizing bail denial and providing batterers the option of awaiting case completion in jail or entering a batterer’s treatment program for four to six months. Potentially, an inpatient treatment program could be part of a diversionary agreement where the existing case is held in abeyance so they can be charged later if they fail treatment or recidivate. This paper presents a legal and policy argument for this approach to battering and its prevention.\n\nA Life After Release\n\nKenneth D. Jensen, Western Oregon University\n\nStephen G. Gibbons, Western Oregon University\n\nThis paper presents the results of a follow-up study of twenty adult offenders released from Oregon Department of Corrections (prison) between 1986 and 1993, and first interviewed in the mid 1990s. We further explore the problems encountered by these offenders and how they negotiated various obstacles on the “outside.” Suggestions for future programs are included in our analysis of the data.\n\nA Log-Linear Analysis of Sexual Crimes Reported in Official Statistics\n\nJames A. Woods, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nJames H. Noonan, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nSamuel Berhanu, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nFew issues are of greater concern, both to the public and to law enforcement, than that of rape and sexual assault. The meda covers it closely. It is a crime of violence of which anyone regardless of age, race, religion, sex, or size, can be a victim. The Uniform Crime Reporting Program has reported summary data on forcible rape for more than 70 years. The summary definition of forcible rape is “the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.” One major criticism of the FBI’s rape statistics is this definitional exclusion of male rape. With the National Incident-Based Reporting System the definition of rape is “the carnal knowledge of a person, forcibly and/or against that person’s will; or not incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.” The objective of this study is to examine the crime of forcible rape and other sex offenses in the United States. How have the numbers changed over time? Who are the victims-ages, sex, race, life circumstances? Are rapes associated with other crimes? Who are the offenders? What weapons are used? Where do these assaults occur? What are the differences between rapes reported to police and victimization studies? Data will come from the UCR data collections, both summary and the National Incident-Based Reporting system and from the National crime Victimization Survey.\n\nA Longitudinal Analysis of Stress, Social Support and Violence by People With Mental Disorders\n\nBrent Teasdale, The Pennsylvania State University\n\nThere has been a wealth of research on the causes of violence by people with mental disorders. These investigations have largely been confined to explorations of clinical variables, such as treatment non-adherence, substance use and abuse, and psychotic symptoms. In contrast a developing body of research investigates the social contexts of violence by people with mental disorders. This literature highlights the importance of stress and social support in both the etiology of mental illness and the expression of symptoms by people with mental disorders. In addition, Agenew’s general strain theory emphasizes the importance of social stressors for crime, generally and Cullen’s social support framework emphasizes the role that support plays in preventing crime and violence. Based on these perspectives, I hypothesize that high levels of stress and low levels of social support are important predictors of violence amonh people with mental disorders. I analyze data from the Mac Arthur Violence Risk Assessment Study, a longitudinal study of discharged psychiatric patients in the community. I utlize hierarchical growth curve modeling techniques that provide a within individual analysis of the predictors of violence.\n\nA Measurement Model Approach to Estimating Community Policing Implementation\n\nJeremy M. Wilson, RAND\n\nThe primary objective of this research is to explore an alternative way to measure community policing implementation. Using large municipal police organizations as the unit of analysis (i.e., those with 100 or more FTE sworn employees), I develop and test using two waves (1997 and 1999) of LEMAS (Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics) data a measurement model of community policing implementation. As opposed to creating an index of implementation, this model provides an interval level estimate of implementation from various community policing activities measured on multiple scales.\n\nA Multi-Factor Social Ecological Approach to Family Violence\n\nSuzette Cote, California State University, Sacramento\n\nTraditional family and domestic violece studies have utilized single-factor models to explain why men batter women (battering behavior) and whyt women do not leave their abusers (victim behaviors). Although studies using these theoretical perspectives have yielded important findings, the single-factor approach has not effectively nor fully explained these phenomena. More recently, researchers have shifted toward a multi-factor approach to understand the complexities of family and domestic violence. By examining interactions of factors within individual, social, political, and cultural arenas, a multi-factor social ecological model looks at human needs, problems, and behaviors as produced by the interaction between people and their environments. It considers not only how family and domestic violence situations arise but also how the criminal justice system responds to those problems in terms of legal and social intervention programs and processes. This paper will provide a review of the literature on multi-factor models and discuss the application of a social ecological approach to understanding family and domestic violence. Secondly, it will address the ways in which law enforcement can utilize multiple indicators of intimate violence–including family behavior and structure and the demographic, social, and economic characteristics of communities where this violence occurs in their prevention and intervention strategies.\n\nA Multi-Level Analysis of Citizen Involvement in Community Policing\n\nApril Pattavina, University of Massachusetts – Lowell\n\nHeather Madruga, University of Massachusetts – Lowell\n\nLuis Garcia, Suffolk University\n\nResults are presented from extensive survey and archival data analysis on the predictive capacity of community and individual factors on citizen involvement in community policing in Boston. The findings indicate that select individual and community factors are significant predictors of involvement as well as residents’ interest and knowledge of community policing.\n\nA Multi-Method Psychometric Assessment of a Self-Control Scale: Does Gender Matter?\n\nChristopher L. Gibson, University of South Florida\n\nGottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) theory has sparked an empirical debate surrounding the psychometric properties of the widely used Grasmick et al. self-control scale. Does this scale measure a unidimensional trait, a multidimensional trait, or do item responses depend on the individual’s level of self-control? While classical and objective measurement techniques have been employed resulting in conflicting answers, no study has thoroughly investigated this scale’s construct validity across gender. Using data collected from a sample of students attending a university in the southern U.S., the current study assesses the dimensionality of the scale using both second-order SEM measurement models and item response theory (IRT) rasch models to make comparisons across methods and gender groups. Implications for both theory and measurement are discussed.\n\nA Multi-Site Process Evaluation of Juvenile Drug Courts\n\nBarbara Patterson, University of Kentucky\n\nCarl G. Leukefeld, University of Kentucky\n\nConnie Payne, Administrative Office of the Courts\n\nDanielle Malluche, University of Kentucky\n\nMatthew L. Hiller, University of Kentucky\n\nRebecca L. Abensur, University of Kentucky\n\nValerie Bryan, University of Kentucky\n\nLike adult drug courts, juvenile drug courts have proliferated at astonishing rates over the past decade (Cooper, 2001), but serious study of this structured court-based intervention for youth with drug and alcohol problems has lagged (Belenko, 2001; Belenko & Logan, in press). Even a general understanding of how juvenile drug courts are structured and how they are implemented is lacking from the drug court research literature. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to describe a process evaluation of three juvenile drug courts in Kentucky. The structure and design of each program is discussed and detailed findings on the actual implementation of these programs in multiple content areas, including target population, therapeutic activities, available resources, initial and long-term goals, and other program concerns are presented. In addition to this, the during-program outcome data are presented, and findings are reported as a snapshot of what might be expected during one year in the operation of a juvenile drug court. Findings are discussed and may be useful as a reference for other juvenile drug court evaluations and for jurisdictions in which new juvenile drug courts are being developed or planned.\n\nA Partial Test of Anderson’s Code of the Street Thesis\n\nEric A. Stewart, Georgia State University\n\nThe current paper tests Anderson’s Code of the Stree Thesis across two waves of data for a sample of 720 African-American adolescents and their primary caregivers. Using Anderson’s Code of the Street Thesis, we investigate the merits of his arguments. The analyses incoprorate both community and family characteristics on individuals’ adoption of attitudes indicative of a street code. We further investigate whether adopting a street code mediates community and family characteristics in predicting adolescent violent behaviors. The results will be discussed at the annual criminology meetings.\n\nA Path Analysis of Family Context, Opportunity, and Delinquency: Controlling for Self-Control\n\nBrian R. Buchner, University of Missouri – St. Louis\n\nRobert J. Fornango, University of Missouri – St. Louis\n\nUsing multiple waves of the National Youth Survey (NYS), a longitudinal data series, we examine the relationship between self-control and delinquency through changes in parental supervision. Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) general theory of crime predicts the relationship between low-self control and delinquency is conditioned by available opportunities for deviance. Low self-control has been shown to be a consistent predictor of delinquency and analogous behaviors. Additionally, social-learning theories suggest the likelihood of delinquency increases through association with delinquent peers (Akers, 1998). Previous research indicates that mixed models of delinquency, incorporating measures of self-control, may be preferential in explaining variations in delinquent behavior. The primary hypothesis is that reductions in parental supervision increase opportunities for associations with peers that, in turn, can increase delinquency net of the effects of low self-control. The NYS includes proxy measures of parental supervision, as well as self-reported delinquency and analogous behaviors, attitudes toward delinquency, and peer associations. In the context of family dynamics, we explore the impact of changes in the family environment over time on the association with delinquent peers, controlling for levels of self-control. The implications of complementary model specifications are explored.\n\nA Proposal for Market-Based Policies for the Control of Crime Externalities\n\nGraham Farrell, University of Cincinnati\n\nThe study of crime externalities is in its early stages. It is barely on the policy agenda, perhaps at the stage that environmental pollution and climate change were at a few decades ago. Portney and Stavins (2000) noted that “In 1989, little serious attention was paid by U.S. government agencies to the possibility of global climate change as a result of the greenhouse effect.” Crime externalities occur where entities (including manufacturers, premises, persons, and environments) produce criminal opportunities, thereby producing costs to society that they do not bear. This study examines types of crime externalities, explores possibilities for market-based regulation, modes of delivery and issues relating to implementation.\n\nA Proposal for Positive Change\n\nWilliam D. Sawyer, Western Oregon University\n\nThis paper discusses various ideas for promoting change with8in a parole and probation office in Oregon, and critically distilling those ideas to determine that which works and that which fails to produce acceptable results. This paper examines the practice of punishment as a means of change by parole and probation officers, and offers a more progressive-minded philosophy which combines effective interventions with cognitive proramming.\n\nA Qualitative Account of Program Development in a Demoralized Urban School\n\nThomas W. Gore, Associates for Renewal in Education\n\nThe first of two presentations on different aspects of a program of preventive intervention in a demoralized and disorganized inner city middle school describes the school in qualitative terms by providing an account of faculty and administration reactions to efforts to organize them to improve the school’s attendance, parent participation, school orderliness. Despite the clearly unpleasant aspects of working in a school characterized by lack of personal afetyk low morale, and high rates of student misconduct, faculty were initially openly hostile to efforts to involve them in planning to improve the school environment. A process of the gradual introduction of small changes was begun–focusing initially on parent and student involvement in building a sense of community. The process was characterized by a stair step program of a succession of small successes interrupted periodically by discouraging backslides that set the improvement program back. An interpretation of the group dynamic that caused attempts to identify and address problems suggets that such efforts are interpreted as threats or attacks rather than attempts to be helpful, so that planning and the setting of improvement goals was repeatedly thwarted. By a gradual accretion of small successes, faculty were eventually involved in planning and implementing steps to improve attendance–and attendance did increase. The school also became safer and morale improved over time, but progress eventually stagnated due to an unwillingness or inability of the principal to make decisions of exercie leadership. The nature of the problem and the process of improvement are described by reviewing a series of analyses using the critical incident technique and force-field analysis\n\nA Quantitative Evaluation of Program Implementation and Outcome in a Demoralized Urban School\n\nGary D. Gottfredson, Gottfredson Associates, Inc.\n\nA second report on the intervention program in this school provides a quantitative account of the implementation and outcome evaluation of a social skills training intervention intended to reduce student problem behavior. Implementation data show that the program was only 68% implemented due to interruptions that characterized the school environment (and on which the qualitative study sheds light), and was implemented to different degrees in two successive semesters. Outcome data showed that the intervention nevertheless had some positive effects on student conduct, less victimization in school, and more positive peer associations and reduced the proportion of students who left school when data for the intervention group are compared with a comparison group i the same school net of statistical controls for initial student characteristics. Simple quantitative analyses revealed instances of teacher noncompliance with efforts to collect data, and that school disciplinary data lacked validity, so that it is necessary to rely on data specifically collected to make evaluation possible. Specific intervention programs may offer minimal benefits if the school environment makes implementation difficult.\n\nA Rational Choice Model of Deterrence, Intentions, and Drug Use\n\nDerek Kreager, University of Washington – Seattle\n\nRoss L. Matsueda, University of Washington – Seattle\n\nThis paper examines a rational choice theory of deterrence and drug use. It begins by testing a simple experiential learning theory of the formation of risk perceptions, in which standing beliefs about the probability of arrest are updated based on experience with offending and arrest. It then specifies a rational choice theory of drug use, emphasizing three factors: (1) the perceived risk of formal punishment weighted by subjective assessments of the severity of the punishment; (2) the perceived likelihood of psychic rewards drug use, including getting excitement and being seen as cool, weighted by subjective assessments of the value of those returns; and (3) the subjective assessments of drug use opportunities. We estimate models of drug intentions, and then, drawing on social psychological research on attitudes, intentions, and behavior, link intentions to behavior. We test these hypotheses using longitudinal data on 1,527 youth from the Denver Youth Survey. We estimate two equations. The first uses a random-effects tobit model to predict perceived risk of sanctions, which is measured on probability scale, bounded by zero and one. The second uses a random-effects negative binomial model to predict counts of delinquent behavior.\n\nA Report of the State of Crime Prevention in the Memorial Villages: Expectations, Statistical Findings, and Recommendations for the Future\n\nElycia S. Daniel, Sam Houston State University\n\nThe fear of crime has become a major issue in todays society. The true question is whether that fear is warranted or is it just the perception of safety that is more important. Using geographic information system (GIS) technology, police reports data was mapped for 5 consecutive years. Recommendations were given to the police department as to how they can more effectively patrol areas to not only prevent crime, but improve perceptions of public safety.\n\nA Selective View of Use of Force in America? An Insight Into Two Police Sub-Cultures\n\nMaria (Maki) Haberfeld, John Jay College of Criminal Justice\n\nMichael Walker, John Jay College of Criminal Justice\n\nThe use of force is a defining characteristic of the police. The concept of force, and the different actions that are subsumed by it, vary across time and place. The authors are part of an international team of researcher, who study comparative justifications for the use of force by police officers on three different continents. The focus of the study is on normative frameworks for the use of force, as they reflect potentially different conceptions of policing and may reveal important social and cultural variations in perceptions of police work. For the purpose of this cross-cultural comparison a questionnaire, including progressive scenarios, was developed by the researchers and administered to police officers in different countries. This paper presents an analysis of the findings from two police forces in the United States, with a specific focus on the comparative angle.\n\nA Sociological Approach to Explaining Gender Disparity in Appellate Outcomes of Death Penalty Sentencing\n\nChana Barron, University of Iowa\n\nThe gender gap in sentencing outcomes is nowhere more apparent than in capital litigation, especially in the context of appellate court decisions. In particular, women’s death sentences are significantly more often reversed than those of men. The purpose of this study is to investigate the extra-legal factors that contribute to this discrepancy by pairing female and male cases that are legally similar (e.g., statutory sentencing factors, claimed trial errors) that have different outcomes. To do so, I utilize data from the state and federal appellate records of cases from 1973-2002. Preliminary analyses indicate that extra-legal factors play a part in explaining the discrepancy. I draw upon cultural definitions and differeing gender expectations to explain these findings.\n\nA Spatial Analysis of the Mobility of Released Prisoners in Chicago, Illinois\n\nBarbara Parthasarathy, The Urban Institute\n\nNancy LaVigne, The Urban Institute\n\nThis paper will examine the extent of residential mobility among prisoners released to Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods within the first 45 days after release. This analysis is designed to measure the location, range, and frequency of residential movement of released prisoners, as well as the accuracy of Department of Corrections records. Having the correct address (or an accurate proxy) for returning prisoners has important policy implications for both improving the supervision and surveillance of returning prisoners, as well as for guiding resource allocation decisions made by organizations that provide employment, treatment, housing assistance, and other types of services for released prisoners. This analysis is conducted on a sample of 400 prisoners released from Illinois prisons to Chicago neighborhoods during 2002 and 2003. A comparison of DOC release address versus actual release address using Pearson Correlation Coefficients will be examined, as well as the measurement of spatial distance between DOC and actual release address through the use of GIS tools. Frequences of numbers of address changes and means for the sample will be calculated. In addition, distances between addresses and measurement of the extent to which inmates move within or across neighborhoods and jurisidctions will also be explored. Address data is supplied by the Illinois Department of Corrections and survey results from the “Returning Home: Understanding the Challenges of Prisoner Reentry” research project at the Urban Institute, Washington, D.C. The major research questions include: 1) Is DOC release address data an accurate proxy for the actual locations in which ex-prisoners end up living after release? 2) How transient are ex-prisoners? Does residential mobility typically occur within neighborhoods, throughout a city, or across larger jurisdictions? 3) Is the residential mobility of released prisoners influenced by socio-economic and/or contextual factors, such as employment status, substance abuse history, and strength of family ties? 4) How might observed patterns of residential mobility among released prisoners guide correctional programming and supervision, as well as the provision of community services?\n\nA Study of Street Robbery\n\nJo Deakin, University of Manchester\n\nJon Spencer, University of Manchester\n\nDuring the period 2000-2002 in the UK street robbery became the focus of increased government concern placing an emphasis on the role of police criminal intelligence in its prevention. The police had substantial information concerning trends and location of street robberies but very little knowledge of its social context or offeenders perspectives on their actions. This paper is based on research undertaken by the authors into street robbery involving candid interviews with offenders. The findings of this study point towards policy issues as well as strategic policing matters.\n\nA Survival Analysis of Revictimisation\n\nMichael Townsley, Jill Dando Institute\n\nThis study addresses the weaknesses of measuring the time between victimisations, conventionally called the time course of victimisation. Survival analysis — measuring the time until an event of interest — is presented as an alternative method for examining temporal patterns of victimisation. However, adopting statistical techniques developed in other fields requires careful scrutiny of the assumptions inherent with the technique. Most applications of survival analysis assume that subjects will eventually experience the event of interest. This is not a valid assumption for modelling the time until revictimisation because the majority of victims do not experience a second victimisation. Finally, a survival analysis model that utilises information about non-repeats is applied to a five year burglary dataset incorporating correlates.\n\nA Systematic Review of Research on Court-Mandated Interventions for Individuals Convicted of Domestic Violence\n\nDavid B. Wilson, George Mason University\n\nKimber Kerlinger, Portland State University\n\nLynette Feder, Portland State University\n\nAs more communities are called upon to develop coordinated responses to the problem of domestic violence we will most likely see a continued increase in the number of court-mandated interventions. Understanding these programs’ effectiveness in reducing future violence, therefore, becomes increasingly important. Towards those ends, this study undertook a systematic review of all experimental or quasi-experimental research assessing the effects of post-arrest court-mandated interventions (including pre-trial diversion programs) for domestic violence offenders that targeted, in part or exclusively, batterers with the aim of reducing their future likelihood of re-assaulting. Studies had to use random assignment to a true no-treatment control group or a program intervention with a follow-up period of at least six months post-intervention using one or more objective outcome measures on repeat violence. Twenty-one databases, including published and non-published studies in and outside of the U.S., were searched. Results of the meta-analysis are discussed.\n\nA Test of Social Control Theory in the Prediction of Crime on a College Campus\n\nAllison Ann Payne, The College of New Jersey\n\nAyokeji Ayorinde, The College of New Jersey\n\nKeri Ferguson, The College of New Jersey\n\nMichael Ostermann, The College of New Jersey\n\nPrevious research has found much support for Hirschi’s social control theory, which focuses on the social bond or link between individuals and society. The strength of support differs, however, for the four elements of the bond: attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief. The paper will separately examine the ability of each element of the social bond to predict crime on a college campus. It is hypothesized that low attachment to peers, to parents, and to school, low commitment to conventional activities, low involvement in conventional activities, and low belief in conventional norms will all be predictors of delinquency. Data were obtained from a self-report survey given to undergraduates from a small liberal arts college in New Jersey. Correlational and regression analyses will be examined.\n\nA Test of Social Control Versus Social Learning Theories in Predicting of Crime on a College Campus\n\nAllison Ann Payne, The College of New Jersey\n\nChris Quirk, The College of New Jersey\n\nKevin O’Driscoll, The College of New Jersey\n\nRachel Grisi, The College of New Jersey\n\nA myriad of research exists assessing the validity of both social learning and social control theories in the explanation of criminal behavior. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the strengths and weaknessses of both theories as predictors of criminal behavior. The question set forth by this resarch is wehther crime on a college campus is better predicted by components of social control ro social learning theory. This question will be examined using data obtained through a two-wave longitudinal study composed of self-report questionnaires, administered to the student population of a small undergraduate liberal arts college in New Jersey. We will examine correlation and regression analysis involving social learning components, social control components, and crime. In addition a structural model will be constructed and analyzed using the EQS Structural Equations Program (version 5.7B for Windows; Bentler, 1995).\n\nA Test of Social Learning Theory in the Prediction of Crime on a College Campus\n\nAllison Ann Payne, The College of New Jersey\n\nCecylia Lodziato, The College of New Jersey\n\nChris Gesualdo, The College of New Jersey\n\nMarissa Kristbergs, The College of New Jersey\n\nPrevious research has shown that a relationship exists between social learning elements and criminal behavior. Many studies have found that social learning best explains minor crimes and more general deviance rather than serious crime. The ability of the components of social learning theory (differential association, differential reinforcement, imitation/modeling, and definitions) to predict criminal behavior, both minor and more serious, will be tested. It is hypothesized that individuals with more criminal associations, positive reinforcement for criminal activities, more criminal models, and more criminal definitions will have a greater likelihood of being criminal. Data were obtained through a two-wave longitudinal study composed of self-report questionnaires administered to the student population of a small undergraduate liberal arts college in New Jersey. The results of correlational and regression analyses will be examined.\n\nA Theory of Discretion in Criminal Justice Systems\n\nSara Steen, University of Colorado at Boulder\n\nCriminologists have long demonstrated interest in the factors influencing criminal justice decisions. Two of these issues central to this area of research are the extent to which individual actors exercise discretion (individual judgment) in decision-making, and the nature of that discretion. The majority of researchers interested in these issues have looked at discretion at one decision-making point (usually sentencing), trying to explain variations in decisions across individual offenders, decision-makers, and/or jurisdictions. I argue in this paper that it is critical at this particular juncture (in both the world of public policy and the academic world of criminology) to develop a theory that looks at the exercise of discretion across decision-making stages, and includes arguments about how changes in discretionary behavior at one stage will affect decision-making at other stages. The theory that I begin to develop in this paper does this, and also identifies both common factors affecting the availability and the exercise of discretion at different stages, and also organizational factors that explain differences in the nature of discretion at particular stages. Understanding the distribution and uses of discretion in criminal justice systems is important for two reasons. First, the way decision-makers exercise discretion has a significant impact on public perceptions about both the fairness and the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. Because discretionary power by definition allows individuals to exercise judgment in reacing decisions, decision-makers in the same position may consider different factors, resulting in different outcomes for similar cases. This raises concerns about fairness and equity, which, if unaddressed, can lead to public perceptions of systemic discrimination. A related concern arises from the possibility that, granted discretionary power, actors in the criminal justice system will make decisions that do not conform with the intent of policies or decisions made by earlier actors. For example, a judge may sentence an offender to a term shorter than that recommended by statutory guidelines (if the guidelines are not mandatory), or parole board may release an offender long before he or she has completed the sentence imposed by the judge. Such decisions are likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to effectively punish offenders.\n\nA Zero Inflated Poisson Analysis of Spatial Units Created by a GIS: Illegal Drug Sales Arrests\n\nGeorge Rengert, Temple University\n\nMoving beyond census boundaries, a geographic information system is used to create new spatial units associated with elements of the built environment that are expected theoretically to attract illegal drug dealers. These features are classified into those that would be associated with the accessibility of a drug market place (transportation infrastructure), the susceptibility of the local population to drug use (census data on potential drug users), and infrastructure that are expected to be used on a routine basis by potential drug users (taverns, liquor stores and check cashing establishments). These new spatial units are examined using a zero inflated Poisson model since many of the spatial units are small and are associated with no drug sales arrests.\n\nAcademic Performance and Delinquency: Contemporaneous Effects\n\nGary Sweeten, University of Maryland at College Park\n\nThere is a growing body of work attempting to identify a causal relationship between academic performance and delinquent activity. While previous studies consistently find a relationship between academic performance and delinquency or later crime, causality is rarely estalished and numerous methodological problems persist. The current research will improve on previous studies of delinquency and schools by avoiding several commonly occurring methodological weaknesses: non-dynamic analysis, inadeqate controls for pre-existing differences, and reliance on self-report school and delinquency variables. Many studies examine later life outcoems of poor high school academic performance. This study will focus instead on the contemporaneous effect. Utilizing the richly detailed school transcript portion of the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), this research will address the following question: Does poor school performance predic delinquency independent of pre-existing differences\n\nAccess to Handgun Among Urban Youth: Attitudinal and Behavioral Implications\n\nKirk R. Williams, University of California, Riverside\n\nSabrina Arredondo Mattson, University of Colorado at Boulder\n\nThe presence of handgungs among youth continues to be a threat to their weel-being, even with the downturn in youth handgun violence in recent years. This paper examines the influence of the gun safety behavior of parents on yout’s perceive access to handguns and its effect on their handgun attitudes and behaviors. Using a prospective study design a questionnaire was administered to 121 urban youth and their parents before entering a handgun violence prevention program, then again six months later. The findings indicate that youth yo have a perceived access to handguns are less likely to have anti-handgun attitudes and more likely to engage in handgun behavior.\n\nAccomplices, Accessories, and Punishment Attitudes: The Role of Gender and Education\n\nBrian K. Payne, Old Dominion University\n\nVictoria M. Time, Old Dominion University\n\nLaws of most states stipulate that accomplices and accessories be punished to the same degree as the offenders who actually commit the offense. According to some, these laws may be biased towards females who, when inovlved in crime, are more likely than males to serve as accomplicies and accessories. Moreover, criminological theory and punishment research suggests that individuals’ values are influenced by what they have learned. This study considers two areas: (1) whether there are gender differences regarding the way accomplice and accessory laws are perceived, and (21) whether exposure to the law influences indivduals’ attitudes about the penalties participants to a crime should get. A questionnaire was administered to students of a mid-size unviersity. Their responses to the question reveals mixed feelings regarding equal punishment for accomplices and principals. Females were more inclined to advocate punishment for all parties to a crime for deterrence, while males wanted punishment for protection. Implications are discussed.\n\nAccounting for Spatial Relationships in Studies of Crime: An Example From Tucson, Arizona\n\nMeagan Cahill, University of Arizona\n\nThe geographic context of crime must be better understood if research is to effectively inform crime prevention policy. Consequently, this research considers how the geographies of different crimes intersect with the geographies of social, economic, and demographic characteristics in urban places. Social disorganization and routine activity theories inform the project, guiding data collection and methodology. This research focuses on Tucson, AZ and analyses take place at the census block group level. The first stage of the project determines the degree to which urban neighborhoods specialize in crime, ascertaining whether certain types and combinations of crimes cluster together spatially. The techniques used to determine specialization include\n\nAddressing Child Abuse in Jamaica\n\nCamille Gibson, Prairie View A&M University\n\nNelseta Walters, Prairie View A & M University\n\nTraquina Quarles, Prairie View A & M University\n\nThis paper addresses the present circumstances of child abuse in Jamaica. Presently, Jamaic has no official policy requiring health practitioners or educators to report suspected cases of child abuse. Nonetheless, indications are that physical and sexual abuse are cause for concern on the island. For 2003 legislation is planned to remedy the perceived reporting policy deficit. This paper describes Jamaica’s present situation in regards to child abuse per available data and anecdotal accounts.\n\nAddressing Violence in a Middle School: Discovering the Forgotten Victim\n\nWilliam R. Blount, University of South Florida\n\nLengthy discussions about the victims and the assault scenarios generated by extensive data collected about the nature and extent of school violence at a Middle School and the surrounding community brought to light the fact that while there are a multitude of services in place for the perpetrators of school violence, there were NO sevices available for victims. Victims were simply sent back to class and had to deal with their issues associated with the victimization, possible PTSD, trauma, shame, etc. on their own. As a result, a system was designed to address an entire series of victim issues, while at the same time being sensitive to additional victimization. How this came about and was accomplished is described.\n\nAdjudication of the Criminally Accused in Australia and U.S.: How Does the Absence of a Specific Due Process Clause in Australia’s Constitution Impact Fair Trial Concerns for the Criminal Offender?\n\nKristine Mullendore, Grand Valley State University\n\nThe U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights and due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee fair trials to criminal offenders overriding other governmental actions. Australia’s Constitution has no Bill of Rights and no due process clause. The Australian High Court has used comjon law principles in lieu of these constitutional guarantees as the source of protections for the accused such as requiring assistance of counsel where it is deemed necessary to provide a fair trial. This paper explores the relative impact of these different approaches on these legal systems in ensuring fair trials for criminal offenders.\n\nAdolescent Girls in Trouble: Community-Based Foster Care as an Alternative Placement Option\n\nJohn B. Reid, Oregon Social Learning Center\n\nLeslie D. Leve, Oregon Social Learning Center\n\nPatricia Chamberlain, Oregon Social Learning Center\n\nPeter G. Sprengelmeyer, Oregon Social Learning Center\n\nAdolescent girls are one of the fastest-growing segments in juvenile justice, with arrests accounting for 27% of total arrests during 1999. The majority of females in juvenile justice in 1997 were under age 16, and cases involving girls under 18 increased by 83% between 1989 and 1998, compared to a 35% increase for boys. Co-occurring mental health problems and substance use are frequent with studies reporting up to 75% of the girls in detention having psychiatric disorders, and up to 87% being in need of substance abuse treatment. Long-term negative outcomes for girls appear to be more diverse than for boys including a variety of adverse health outcomes. Despite girls’ increasing delinquency and associated health and mental health problems, services for girls are underdeveloped. In this presentation, we will describe an experimental intervention that compared the efficacy of two placement alternatives for girls with multiple previous criminal referrals (i.e.>10) ordered into out-of home placement. Girls were randomly assigned to Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) or to Group Care (GC) and assessed at regular intervals through 1-year follow up. Data will be presented on outcomes and on treatment variables hyupothesized to predict outcomes (i.e., mediators). Clinical considerations will be discussed.\n\nAdolescent Mothers, Family Processes, and Delinquency\n\nFrancis T. Cullen, University of Cincinnati\n\nMichael G. Turner, Univ. of North Carolina at Charlotte\n\nThomas Vander Ven, Ohio University\n\nAlthough adolescent childbearing has decreased significantly in the United States in the past decade, American rates of teen births are still dramatically higher than rates in other developed nations. One of the common concerns voiced by policymakers and social commentators is that teen motherhood contributes to the American crime problem because relatively younger mothers are not prepared to properly socialize their children. We investigate the effefcts of maternal age on family processes and delinquency through a secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Following an approach constructed by Nagin, Farrington, and Pogarsky (1997), we trace the influence of adolescent motherhood through three competing avenues that were hypothesized to increase the probability of criminal involvement in the children of young mothers. The first explanation, the life course-immaturity account, predicts that younger mothers produce antisocial behavior in their children due to their inability to be mature, sensitive, and effective parents. The second explanation, the persistent poor parenting-role modeling account, predicts that those who bear children in adolescence are likely to be those least suited to be good parents. Early fertility, it is assumed, is likely to be caused by a stable personality trait characterized by impulsivity, self-centeredness, and lack of foresight. The final approach–the diminished resources account–predicts that the children of adolescent mothers are more prone to criminal behavior because they are more likely to experience improverishment and lack of social and cultural resources. Our findings suggest that the criminal involvement in the offspring of adolescent mothers is best explained by a combination of family and economic factors.\n\nAdolescent Predictors of Fear and Safety in the Public Schools\n\nTravis Satterlund, North Carolina State University\n\nIn the wake of the recent school shootings and the media hype concerning school violence, fear of crime and violence at school have become even more salient issues than ever before. Many studies have researched fear of crime among adults in a wide array of social settings and contexts, yet research on fear of criminal victimization in our public schools has been relatively sparse. Goodey (1994) contends that children have generally been neglected by researchers and Hale (1996) notes that researchers have neglected fear of criminal victimization among children and adolescence, calling it “an important research priority” (Hale 1996; 100). Using a large representative sample of junior high and high school students from across the nation, this study seeks to fill this void by exploring the factors within the school context that affect adolescents’ fear of crime. A total of 4595 students from 132 schools were surveyed for this study. The findings suggests that GPA, income level, and feelings of alienation do affect the perceptions of students’ level of safety at school. Overall, these findings suggest that there are a great deal of similarities between adolescent and adult determinants of fear of crime.\n\nAfter-School Activities and Peers as a Socializing Mechanisms in the Development of Antisocial Behavior During Early Adolescence: A Test of a Nonrecursive Model\n\nRichard F. Catalano, University of Washington\n\nTracy W. Harachi, University of Washington\n\nStability in rank ordering of antisocial behavior from the elementary to high school developmental time periods have been explained with nonrecursive models that argue that antisocial behavior affects patterns of socialization that in turn lead to more delinquent and criminal behavior. Literature on routine after-school activities provides a concrete picture of socialization processes during early adolescence, pointing to the importance of after-school activities in leading to peer associations that, in turn, affect levels of delinquent behavior. This study uses annual survey data on 740 participants from Raising Health Children, a study of children recruited from a suburban Northwest school district. Cross-lagged models are used to examine relationships between teacher report of disruptive and aggressive behavior in grades 6 through 8, student report of after-school activities and peers in grades 6 through 9, and student report of delinquency and aggressive behavior in grade 9. The models test the extent to which antisocial behavior predicts levels of structured and unstructed after-school activities as well as negative and positive peer associations at the next time point, during transitions from elementary to high school. Conversely, the models assess the extent to which after-school activities and peer associations predict levels of antisocial behavior.\n\nAfter the Shotgun Wedding: Criminal Justice and Treatment Collaborations Under California’s Prop 36 Drug Policy Reform\n\nAmanda Noble, Public Health Institute\n\nDorie Klein, Public Health Institute\n\nRichard Speiglman, Public Health Institute\n\nRobin Miller, Public Health Institute\n\nIn 2001 California’s much-watched Proposition 36 significantly changed the state’s criminal justice sanctioning of persons convicted of felony or misdemeanor drug possession, by requiring that they be offered treatment as a condition of probation in lieu of incarceration. While it was clear that the popular voter-passed initiative’s intent was to encourage treatment instead of punishment, the language gave considerable leeway to state and county officials concerning procedural implementation. In order to identify local implementation issues, the authors conducted two waves of key informant interviews in a sample of eight counties just before and after the law took effect, and a third wave in a smaller sample one-and-a-half years after implementation. Drawing on these data, we describe the counties’ and organizational stakeholders’ approaches toward criminal justice agencies and community-based treatment providers collaborating, as required by Prop 36. We also discuss the underlying contexts for both the uniformities and the divergences found in collaborative procedures, and the perceived consequences for defendants and clients of these procedures. Findings include some noteworthy and unexpected results with respect to predicting which policy approaches might favor successful implementation of a drug law reform such as Prop 36.\n\nAgainst Governmentality: Althusser and the Governance of Crime and Its Control\n\nSteven Bittle, Queen’s University/Law Comm. of Canada\n\nIn recent years there has been a profliferation of criminological and socio-legal studies that employ notions of ‘governmentality’ to critically examine neo-liberal crime control strategies. Much of this neo-Foucauldian literature has shied away from more structural accounts of crime in favour of analyses that reveal ‘microphysics’ of power. This paper critically engages the governmentality literature, raising questions about whether it should revisit the relationships between state-law economy, as well as -gender and-race. The paper suggests that, despite the contributions of the governmentality literature to our understanding of how power is exercised through neo-liberal forms of governance, this literature unnecessarily avoids broader structural mechanisms that give rise to crime control in its current forms. The analytical lens for this analysis is the work of Louis Althusser and his attempts to develop a critical classicism. Several of Althusser’s concepts help to reveal the limitations of governmentality within the crime control literatures, and to suggest ways of embracing a deeper appreciation of the structural mechanisms that help characterize crime and its control — an antiessentialist appreciation that does not treat the economy as the determinant of these strategies.\n\nAge and Social Bonding Theory\n\nOzden Ozbay, Nigde University\n\nHirschi’s social bonding theory is tested for 13-15, 16, and 17 years old high school students in terms of such delinquent behavior as assault, school delinquency, public disturbance, and misceallaneous minor offenses in the case of Ankara, the capital of Turkey. Data contain a two-stage stratified sample of 1,710 high school students. The findings of this study show that some of the elements of social bonding theory acount for 23 percent of the variance in assault for 13-15, 29 percent for 16, and 26 percent for 17-20 years old high school students. This finding indicates that the theory works best for the assaultive behavior of 16 years old high school students. Also, some components of social bonding theory account for 29 percent of the variation in school delinquency for 13-15, 41 percent for 15, 41 percent for 17-20 years old high school students. This suggests that social bonding theory works better for the middle and older adolescence. Moreover, social bonding variables explain 24 percent of the variance in public disturbance for 13-15, 23 percent in 16, and 26 percent in 17-20 years old high school students. This seems to imply that the theory works equally better for 13-15, 16, and 17-20 years old high school students. finally elements of social bonding theory explain more or less similar amount of the variation in miscellaneous minor offenses for both 16 and 17-20 years old adolescence (e.g., 16 percent). However, the accounted variance is 9 percent for 13-15 years old. The theory appears to have more explanatory power for the middle and late than early adoelscence. All in all, except for public disturbance in which the theory accounts for similar aount of the variance for 13-15, 16, 17-20 years old high school students, social bonding theory works better for middle and late adolescence.\n\nAge of Onset of Criminal Behavior: Its Meaning and Significance\n\nRaymond Paternoster, University of Maryland at College Park\n\nRobert Brame, University of South Carolina\n\nSarah Bacon, University of Maryland at College Park\n\nThe positive association between past and future offending behavior is an enduring fact in criminology. Early onset of delinquent behavior, in particular, is predictive of more persistent offending in the future. What is the meaing of this relationship between the early initiation of a criminal career and its duration, seriousness, and persistence? Two explanations for the continuity of criminal behavior have emerged. Persistent population heterogeneity theories attribute variation in criminal behavior to time stable differences in individual’s criminal propensity. State dependence theories assert that past offending behavior can have causal implications for future offending. The Philadelphia Birth Cohort Data will be examined in order to address the question: Once criminal propensity is controlled, does age of onset make a difference in the course of the subsequent criminal career? Findings that point to a causal effect of early onset on subsequent offending would support a state dependence explanation for the continuity of criminal behavior over time. Evidence of a spurious relationship between early onset on subsequent offending would support a state dependence explanation for the continuity of criminal behavior over time. Evidence of a spurious relationship between early onset and subsequent offending would support the role of persistent population heterogeneity ine xplaining the relationship between past and future offending. The relative contributions of each will be assessed.\n\nAge of Onset of Offending: Exploring the Validity of Self-Reports Across Time\n\nDavid P. Farrington, University of Cambridge\n\nLila Kazemian, University of Cambridge\n\nMuch of the research dedicated to the study of the onset of offending has focused on the impact of early onset on other criminal career parameters (i.e. frequency, versatility, seriousness, and duration); other studies have explored the factors predicting early versus later onset. In this study, age of onset is used to assess the validity of self-reports across time. This research throws light on the benefits of prospective versus retrospective longitudinal data. Finally, it seeks to compare self-reported and official age of onset for different types of offenses. This study uses data from the Cambridge Study in Deelinquent Development, a prospective longitudinal study of 411 London males. Teh offense categories were included in this paper: burglary, shoplifting, theft of vehicles, theft from vehicles, theft from machines, theft from work, assault, vandalism, drug use, and fraud. It is organized in three main sections. First, it presents the distribution of onset ages according to the ten offense types. Second, it compares the ages of onset (per offense type) reported by respondents at different periods of the life course, from ages 14 to 32. Finally, it contrasts these results with those of the onset of official offending (i.e., age at first conviction). In general, results seem to show that the age of onset reported at later ages rarely concurs with prior self-reports. Indeed, with time, respondents generally tend to either overestimate the age at which they first committed an offense or simply deny ever engaging in such acts. This lack of stability observed in age of onset results over time supports the relevance of prospective longitudinal studies.\n\nAggression and Violence in Girls: Understanding Rates, Risk Factors and Developmental Trajectories\n\nCandice Odgers, University of Virginia\n\nMarlene M. Moretti, Simon Fraser University\n\nDo we need to be concerned by trends in juvenile justice statistics and self-report information showing steadily increasing rates of aggression among girls? It is well-documented that boys outnumber girls as perpetrators of serious forms of aggressive behaviour. Over the last two decades, however, rates of official (Australian Institute of Criminology, 2002, OJJDP Statistical Briefing Book, 2000; Snyder & Sickmund, 1999; Statistics Canada, 2001) and self-report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001) violent offending among female adolescents have increased significantly. In addition, changes in the conceptualisation of aggression to include indirect and relational forms, has resulted in the placement of adolescent females at the forefront of many research, policy and programming agendas. In this talk we will provide an overview of trends in crime statistics and self-report findings related to aggression and violence in girls. A developmental model, with particular emphasis on the role of attachment security, self-regulatory development, and victimization will be presented. Our current research program and future initiatives will be discussed.\n\nAggression of the Korean Inmate: A Validation Study of Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ)\n\nJunseob Moon, Sam Houston State University\n\nPamela Diamond, University of Texas at Houston\n\nSoo Jung Lee, Kyonggi University\n\nViolence in the correctional facilities is one of the most serious problems (Camp & Camp, 2000). It is not an exception in the correctional facilities in Korea. Since violence in Korean correctional facilities also results in the increase of financial costs, including medical cots for injured victims, and inefficiency of the institutional management, risk assessment has been attempted based on empirically drive psychological measures (e.g. Lee & Eden, in press). The present study specifically focused on measuring aggression rather than other criminogenic needs of inmates in the Korean correctional facilities. In order to develop a comparative study ultimately, it was necessary to validate a widely used test inventory for a prospective population. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to collect validity indices for one of the most popular aggression measure, the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992) from Korean inmates. The samples were 114 inmates from three Korean correctional facilities with maximum level of security. The result of item and factor analyses confirmed the effectiveness of BPAQ to assess aggression among Korean inmates.\n\nAlcohol, Colonialism and Crime\n\nLarry A. Gould, Northern Arizona University\n\nThis research reviews the social, political, individual, cultural, criminological, and economic impact of European alcohol on Indigenous Peoples. There is little doubt that the introduction of alcohol by Europeans into Indigenous populations has had a lonb-term negative impact, not only on the social structures of Indigenous Peoples, but also on the European-based criminological theories that have been used in an often-failed attempt to explain the behavior of Indigenous Peoples. It is suggested in this research that, to some extent, alcohol was used by Europeans not only as a means of profit-making, but also as a means of colonization and subjugation. It is also argued in this research that, in some segments of the European-based population, alcohol continues to be used as a tool to demoralize, demean and disenfranchise Indigenous Peoples, while enriching whites.\n\nAlcohol Use and Social Capital During the Transition From Adolescence Into Young Adulthood\n\nJason A. Ford, University of Central Florida\n\nLife course theorists have traditionally relied upon the “state dependence” hypothesis to examine the connection between prior and future offending behavior. This approach posits that prior criminal involvement has a genuine behavioral imipact that increases the likelihood of future criminal activity. Stated more precisely, Sampson and Laub maintain that involvement in criminal behavior has a systematic attenuating effect on the social and institutional bonds that link individuals to society. They argue that stability in offending behavior is explained via a dynamic process whereby prior criminal involvement intensifies future criminal involvement through the weakening of the social bond. Therefore, being aware of any factors, other than crime, that may weaken the social bond should contribute to our undetstanding of stability in offending behavior. Using data from the National Youth Survey, this study will examine the impact of alcohol use on social bonding during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. It is hypothesized that serious alcohol use will be negatively related to social onding and, consequently, a predictor of stable rates in offending behavior.\n\nAll the News Unfit to Print: A Content Analysis of Corporate Offense News Coverage\n\nMarny Rivera, Southern Oregon University\n\nThe purpose of this research study was to assess and measure the quantity and quality of news coverage on corporate offenses. A content analysis of corporate offense accounts covered in the New York Times was conducted to measure the newsworthiness of these stories and the extent to which the stories discussed serious harm resulting from corporate wrongdoingk the intent of the corporate actor and the criminal justice or regulatory response to the wrongdoing. A substantial number of stories were uncovered during the years under analysis, but overall, these stories were not very newsworth in terms of their page location, headline size, story length or pairing with a picture or chart. Regarding the content of the news stories, few suggested any indication of intent, present at the time of the corporate wrongdoing. Likewise, a smaller number of stories communicated serious harm other than simply illness, injury, or no harm whatsoever. From this research, it can be concluded that the content of corporate wrongdoing news stories does not parallel that presented in news stories of street crime. More resarch is necessary in order to specify the relationship between media coverage, the public’s perception of corporate wrongdoing and policies designed to regulate corporate offenses.\n\nAlternative Designs for Multisite Reform\n\nBernadette Pelissier, Federal Bureau of Prisons\n\nChristopher D. Maxwell, Michigan State University\n\nScott D. Camp, Federal Bureau of Prisons\n\nThis panel addresses issues in the design, implementation, and interpretation of multisite research in criminology. Based on examples from their past and current research, presenters will describe the relationship between the number of sites, the role of local researchers and practitioners, and data collection and analysis. The strengths and weaknesses of alternative designs will be compared and suggestions for future multisite designs will be considered.\n\nAmerican Indians and the Death Penalty: A Case Study of Three Death Row Inmates in Arizona\n\nRobert Carl Schehr, Northern Arizona University\n\nThis paper describes base-line data pertaining to due process and investigative matters arising in the conviction of three American Indian death row inmates in the state of Arizona. There are presently 41 American Indians on death row in the United States. This case study serves as a precursor to a larger and more extensive research project that will content analyze all 41 death row cases. My primary objective is creation of a composite picture of the conviction and sentencing of American Indians. This work is part of a national effort to produce post-mortum case review to identify and correct problems associated with due process. Among the issues discussed are: indigent defense, the role of eyewitnesses, police and prosecutorial behavior, the role of prison informants in convictions, and post-conviction review. This paper concludes with a statement relating to the relevance of Indian sovereignty rights with respect to capital punishment.\n\nAmerican Institutional Theories of Crime Causation and Juvenile Delinquency\n\nGini R. Deibert, University of Texas – Austin\n\nAmerican institutional theories of crime have previously focused on explaining macro-level violent crimes. This study extends earlier works by applying two theories, institutional legitimacy and institutional anomie, to lower level offenses. Findings indicate a strong relationship between delinquency and faith in American social institutions such as the family, the economy and the political system. The relationships, however, vary in direction by offense and institution suggesting partial support for both theories. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.\n\nAn Analysis of a National Survey of Juvenile Correctional Institutions in Taiwan\n\nChen-nan Huang, Department of Corrections in Taiwan\n\nShr-chi Jou Jou, Department of Corrections in Taiwan\n\nYung-Lien Lai, Department of Corrections in Taiwan\n\nThere are now in Taiwan four juvenile correctional institutions; two reformatory schools and two correctional schools. In July of 1999 two of the institutions were converted into “Correctional Schools” in an attempt to enhance the efficiency of Taiwan’s juvenile justice system. In order to evaluate these two categories of institutions, a national survey focusing on the comparative effectiveness of the two forms of juvenile corrections institutions was conducted in 2003. Based on official statistics, comparison of recidivism rates reveals no significant difference between these two forms of juvenile correctional institutions. However the cost per juvenile in the “Correctional Schools” (US $14,485/year) is far higher than in the Reformatory Schools (US $8,945/year). Findings from this study provide important information for planners in determining whether the other two reformatory schools should be converted to Correctional Schools. This random sampling has resulted in 180 juvenile subjects and 159 staff valid for the study’s analysis. The survey was also administered to students and staff in an attempt to identify which correctional model plays a more important role in Taiwan’s juvenile justice practice. Stratified sampling was the primary method used to select representative cases from all four juvenile institutions in Taiwan. The main variables included in the study were measures associated with juvenile’s perception of the institutional strain and social bonds.\n\nAn Analysis of a National Survey of School Dropouts in Taiwan\n\nHuang-Fa Teng, National Central Police University\n\nShr-chi Jou Jou, Department of Corrections in Taiwan\n\nTe-hui Tsai, National Central Police University\n\nW.S. Wilson Huang, Valdosta State University\n\nBetween 1997 and 2001, more than 15 astonishing criminal incidents committed by school dropouts were highly publicized by media in Taiwan, and received enormous attention by government officials. In response to these serious incidents, a national survey focusing on school dropouts was conducted in 2001 to study social and demographic characteristics of these subjects. The survey was also administered to non-dropout students in an attempt to identify characteristics which may distinguish from those of the dropouts. Stratified sampling was the primary method to select respresentative cases from all 23 school districts in Taiwan. This random sampling has resulted in 1,049 non-dropout subjects and 477 dropouts valid for the study’s analysis. The main variables included in the study are measures associated with strain, social bonds, and criminal learning. Theanalysis would center on differences in these theoretical factors whose results on delinquency have been examined extensively in the United States. Findings of the study would shed lights on casues of school dropout from evidence of a non-U.S. society.\n\nAn Analysis of Club Drug Trends Among ADAM Arrestees\n\nCandace M. Johnson, Justice Studies, Inc.\n\nPhyllis J. Newton, Justice Studies, Inc.\n\nAbuse of synthetic drugs, including those commonly known as club drugs, has risen dramatically in many communities throughout the United Sttes. While ADAM data collection has covered the use of methamphetamine for several years, its coverage of other club drugs (such as ecstasy, MDMA, LSD, PCP, hallucinogens, Rohypnol) has been less standard. However, uncoded drug data, as well as urinalysis data, include a wealth of information not consistently analyzed to date. This study will investigate the use and trends of various club drugs nationally and regionally among ADAM arrestees from 1999 through 2002 as indicated by self-report for the last year and last two days, as well as results from urinalysis.\n\nAn Analysis of Intimate Partner Homicide in Southern California\n\nElizabeth Piper Deschenes, California State University – Long Beach\n\nSylvia Valenzuela, California State University – Long Beach\n\nIn 1995 the California legislation authorized counties to establish an interagency team to assist local agencies in identifying and reviewing all domestic violence related deaths. Each county agency is responsible for compiling a report on such occurrences in order to implement strategies to reduce and ultimately prevent domestic violence realted deaths. This study compares the Orange County Domestic Violence Death Review Team’s 1997-2001 report findings to the reports for Los Angeles and San Diego counties. This paper focuses on situational and offender/victim characteristics, the coordination of systems and the accessibility of services. The results were analyzed in order to determine the trends and specific indicators or demographics and situational patterns in domestic violence homicides and suicides in Southern California. The paper concludes with policy and program recommendations that will assist the county in the reduction and prevention of domestic violence related deaths.\n\nAn Analysis of Scientific Sentencing and Its Impact on the Criminal Justice System\n\nIsis N. Walton, Virginia State University\n\nIt is now a shared reality that the number of people under criminal justice regulation in this country has reached a record high. As a result, the sentencing policies driving that number, and the field of corrections, where the consequences are felt, have acquired unprecedented complexities. Although sentencing guidelines have introduced some uniformity int he way sentences have been handed out, the continuous implementation of these guidelines has led to a tremdous impact in the number of incarcerated individuals in the past ten (10) years. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of science on sentencing and court proceedings. Additionally, this paper will delineate the use of systematic science in this phase of the criminal justie system to show how it has removed judicial discretion and consequently minimized the roles judges perform. Sentencing disparity has not been eliminated as a result of these guidelines. In fact, minorities now comprise sixty (60)% of all incarcerated individuals. One of the central questions to be asked; Are sentencing policies, as implemented through correctional practices, achieving their intended purposes?\n\nAn Analysis of Survey 2003 in Texas: High School Criminal Educators\n\nW. Wesley Johnson, Sam Houston State University\n\nWon-Jae Lee, Sam Houston State University\n\nThe impact of criminal justice and criminology courses in the high school curriculum in the United States is an interesting yet unexplored issue. Targeting on a sampling frame of 230 high school criminal justice educators in Texas, this research: (1) analyzes the high school criminal justice education in order to determine its impact on both students’ career path in the field of criminal justice and reduction in school crime; (2) examine the educational background, teaching conditions, and job satisfaction of high school criminal justice educators in Texas; and (3) discusses implications and policy ramifications.\n\nAn Assessment of First Responder Attitudes About the Nature of Transnational Organized Crime\n\nGene Scaramella, Lewis University\n\nThis research attempts to assess the level of knowledge and understanding of transnational and organized crime of first responder members of the local law enforcement community. Using judgmental and snowball sampling techniques, a population of Chicago Police Department first responder personnel will be selected for in-depth interviewing in an effort to assess their level of knowledge and understanding regarding these international issues. Data gleaned from the interviews may have significant implications for the development of a variety of training initiatives for local law enforcement personnel.\n\nAn Economic Analysis of the Causes and Mechanisms of Juvenile Delinquency: An Empirical Study of the French Evidence\n\nLorraine Tournyol Du Clos, INED\n\nThe published figures show that the population of juvenile delinquents in France has been steadily rising at an unprecedented rate since 1993. The economics of crime offers the tools to give a realistic and persuasive explanation as the basis for understanding and controlling the causes and mechanisms of the problem. This is an entirely new approach in France, and the body of work done in other specialised fields (sociology, criminology, psychology), as a serious demographic analysis has been drawn on to make the case for the basis of the proposed model development. The range of models developed in the 30-plus years since Becker (1968) now offers ways of factoring in a wide array of features and attributes. From this, two key propositions are put into sharp focus: that there are different forms of offending, and that risk factors act indirectly through a copycat mechanism on juvenile people not prima facie members of this risk group. Then, a ground-breaking “social interactions” econometric model adapted from EHRLICH (1973) and GLAESER’s (1996) model was then used to measure and rank the causes and mechanisms of youth crime using data from 242 municipalities in France. Data and Methods Used: Data from 242 municipalities in France during 5 years (1995 to 1999). Econometric method of two least squares (2LS) regression. Results: Results consists at first, in presenting an analysis of juvenile delinquency, and more precisely the weight of theoretical risk factors in each of the twelve French juvenile delinquency’s forms development. Otherwise, the analysis goes through different sorts of risk factors: those which never occur in our study (is there any explanation?), those which appear linked to one only or few forms of juvenile delinquency (what have they in common?). Then, risk factors which often take place in the juvenile delinquency’s mechanisms are, at their turn, interpreted. And, a last part treat of some conceivable political actions, depending to the risk factor’s nature and the juvenile delinquency’s form which seems to be fought as a priority.\n\nAn Empirical Analysis of Detention Decision Making in the Juvenile Justice System\n\nJessica Hodge, University of Delaware\n\nRichard Greenleaf, California State University Fresno\n\nThis research examines the detention of youth in one county juvenile department in Oregon located in a predominantly White and Hispanic community. The sample (N=150) included Hispanic and White youth detained during July 2001-June 2002. Using quantitatibe analyses, the following independent variables were examined to assess what factors influence the decsion to detain youth: age, sex, race, whom the youth lives with, school involvement, gang involvement, current offense (misdemeanors, felonies, probation violations, and parole violations), prior offense (misdemeanors or felonies), and the number of prior adjudications and referrals. In addition to quantitative analyses, interviews were also conducted with juvenile probation officers and judges to supplement the official records. Similar to previous tudies, this research revealed that older youth were more likely to be detained than younger youth. Moreover, it was also found that males were more likely detained for new law violations; whereas, females were more likely to be detained for probation violations (i.e. noncompliance with court conditions, runaway status, or truancy). This research not only contributes to the understanding of the factors that influence detention decision making, but also to the literature of Hispanic youth involved in the juvenile justice system.\n\nAn Empirical and Legal Analysis of Police Handling of Persons With Psychopathologies\n\nBrenda Popplewell\n\nTerry C. Cox, Eastern Kentucky University\n\nThis paper will examine the current literature regarding police handling of persons with mental disorders. A focus will be on current legal rulings and associated standards. A second focus will include the current state of empirical and training literature regarding recommendations for handling mentally impaired persons. Lastly, legal interpretations of police related cases associated with the American with Disabilities Act will be included.\n\nAn Empirical Assessment of Juvenile Drug Use, Self-Medication and Violent Behavior\n\nMichael Ostrowsky, University at Albany\n\nThe majority of research predicts and finds a positive association between substance use and violence. However, some research has found that substance use decreases the likelihood of violence. It has been noted that some drugs assuage distressful feelings related to aggression. For example, many researchers have found that marijuana use suppresses the expression of aggressive impulses. In short, some researchers find that substance use predicts violence, while other find that substance use serves to moderate violent tendencies through self-medication. Using a sample of adolescents, this study examines the efficacy of both of these perspectives in explaining violent behavior.\n\nAn Empirical Assessment of the Affect of Crime Salience on Attitudes Toward Crime, Welfare and Immigration\n\nMarc Gertz, Florida State University\n\nMichael T.
