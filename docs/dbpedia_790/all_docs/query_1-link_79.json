        "text": "JustFilms grants over $4 million to support 68 content projects in the United States, Brazil, and more\n\nNew York, NY (December 19, 2022) – Today the Ford Foundation announced its overall funding for independent documentary film in 2022. One of the largest documentary funds in the world and a part of the foundation’s Creativity and Free Expression (CFE) program, JustFilms provided over $4 million to support 68 innovative film projects in the United States and around the world that are centered on social justice issues.\n\nFrom this allocation, the 68 documentary film projects supported this year include 43 filmmakers with new projects and 25 continuing support grants for films previously funded. This year’s funding went toward a cohort of films linked by their social, political, and creative ambition to elevate artist-centered filmmaking and spur social action. Of the 68 film projects, 70% of the grants were made to filmmakers identifying as Black, Indigenous or people of color (BIPOC), as well. These projects spanned the foundation’s global offices and included works from the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and beyond.\n\n“We’re privileged to support the ecosystem of independent documentary filmmaking that looks to amplify social justice causes,” said Jon-Sesrie Goff, program officer for JustFilms at the Ford Foundation. “I’m proud of how these projects further illustrate the complexities of the moment we’re all in now, offering unique perspectives that allow audiences to peer deeper into the stories that shape and define our realities today.”\n\nJustFilms has also piloted a direct support grant program comprised of $75,000 grants for leading filmmakers to deepen their practices, build career sustainability, and advance multiple projects. One such example from the program is filmmaker and writer Brett Story, whose work currently focuses on labor movements and prison abolition. Story represents the impact that individuals can have with more support and resources in their corner to build a more sustainable and inclusive documentary sector that honors the research and time that inspires compelling nonfiction storytelling.\n\n“We believe filmmakers should be able to focus on their work and take greater risks without always worrying about how they will pay to keep the lights on,” said Chi-hui Yang, senior program officer for JustFilms at the Ford Foundation. “Ensuring sustainable careers and practices for them requires rethinking models of funding and support beyond project funding tied to specific outcomes in an imperfect system of distribution and exhibition, and allowing artists more freedom to explore, imagine, and consider how their contributions can potentially impact the entire documentary film sector.”\n\nThe JustFilms grants for the 68 projects span a number of countries, with many supporting global filmmakers, particularly those from the Global South, as a core part of JustFilms’ work and mission. Films supported in 2022 include: Black Power, Black Rio (dir. Emilio Domingos), which traces the Black Rio Movement and the emergence of Black cultural and political identity in 1970s Brazil via archives of trailblazing Brazilian music and insights from dance promoter Dom Filo; Guardianas (dir. Danniela Castro Valencia), which recenters women of Indigenous and African descent in the fight for cultural survival and protection of the environment in Colombia; and The Walk (dir. Tamara Kotevska), the story of a large-scale social art project called Little Amal, which has traveled across 13 countries representing the forced migration of children fleeing war and violence. Another pivotal grant made this year was part of a multi-year contribution to the IDFA Bertha Fund, which supports artistic voices primarily from the Global South.\n\nMany of the U.S.-based grantees used their documentary projects to engage public discourse around pressing national issues of our time—especially this complex cultural moment of rampant polarization and dis/misinformation. These include Soledad O’Brien’s Untitled Abortion Project, which addresses the state of reproductive health after the Dobbs decision; Sidney Fussell and Samantha Knowles’ #WhileBlack, which explores how Big Tech exposes racism while also exploiting witnesses behind the camera and online viewers; Kimberly Reed’s The Gender Project, which follows misperceptions about gender and biological sex; and Dana Coester’s Raised By Wolves, a look at extremism in online youth culture in an Appalachian community. Other US-based works by acclaimed visual artists and experimental filmmakers include Before the War (dir. Chitra Ganish), Powow People (dir. Sky Hopinka), Nowhere Near (dir. Miko Revereza), and Don & Moki (dir. Ephriam Asili).\n\nMoving beyond accountability to action, JustFilms’ supported filmmakers are on the frontlines of disability justice in the industry, often reshaping the ways diversity, equity, and inclusion are framed in the independent social justice documentary landscape. JustFilms provided the seed funds to launch the Nonfiction Access Initiative at the International Documentary Association, which supports disabled documentary filmmakers through data collection, field surveys, and a film fund. Projects funded by JustFilms in 2022 that focus on disability communities include Set Hernandez’s Unseen, Rea Tajiri’s Wisdom Gone Wild, Reveca Torres’s Untitled Art & Disability Project, and Fire Through Dry Grass (dirs. Alexis Neophytides, Andres “Jay” Molina).\n\nThe full list of documentary film projects supported by JustFilms in 2022 are below:\n\nNewly Funded Projects\n\nA FAMILY BUSINESS\n\nDirector(s): Frederick Wiseman\n\nProducer(s): Frederick Wiseman, Karen Konicek\n\nA chronicle of the day-to-day activities of a Michelin three-star restaurant and the family that owns and operates it.

ASCO: Without Permission examines the importance of their subversive and wildly spirited work and how it serves as a framework for representation in today’s cultural landscape. Through formal invention and the creation of original works with the next generation of Latinx artists, along with interviews with prominent actors, artists, and activists, this documentary provides a call to action while celebrating a group that was far ahead of its time.\n\nBANISHMENT\n\nDirector(s) & Producer(s): Alex Rivera\n\nDeportations happen every hour of every day in the United States, but “deportation” appears nowhere in the U.S. Constitution.
