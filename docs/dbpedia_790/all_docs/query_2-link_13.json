A useful allrounder for Western Province from 1920 to 1923, he gained his international cap mainly through brilliant fielding, usually at cover point. His most notable performance in first-class cricket was 81 not out for Western Province v Orange Free State in 1921-22. An Oxford Rugby Blue of 1912 and 1913, he was awarded the DSO and MC during the 1914-18 war.\n\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack \"\n\nfrom: http://content.cricinfo.com/southafrica/co...ayer/46968.html\n\nIt seems that the brother went not to Trinity, but to Oriel\n\nsee http://www.archive.org/details/registerofrhodes012418mbp\n\nPre-Will and 1903\n\nBEFORE his death Mr. Rhodes had, by way of experiment, given a Scholarship\n\nto the Diocesan College at Rondebosch, close by his own house,\n\nGroote Schuur. The first Scholarship was divided between two Scholars.\n\nThe holders of this pre-Will Scholarship came into residence at Oxford\n\nin 1904. Although there were South African Rhodes Scholars at Oxford\n\nby 1903, it has been thought best to place the pre-Will Scholars by themselves\n\nat the beginning of this Register.\n\nREID, FRANK, b. 20 Aug. 1885.

Played at centre in the 1912 Varsity match and at fullback in 1913. Educated at Diocesan College Rondebosch and Oriel College. Also played rugby for the Barbarians, Blackheath and Villagers RFCs. In WW1 served in South West Africa with the Imperial Light Horse and later with the Royal Artillery in France and Belgium. Awarded the DSO in 1919 and MC and Mentioned in Despatches. Twice wounded and slightly gassed. Played cricket for South Africa v Australia in 1921, the Authentics club, and Western Province. A lawyer. Practised at the Side-Bar in Cape Town until he retired in 1944.\n\nThe Oxford University Roll of Service confirms Oriel College.\n\nCambridge won the 1912/13 Varsity match (10-3) and the 1913/14 game (13-3). Norman played four times at fullback for the Barbarians in 1912/13 and 1913/14, his first game being the 3-8 defeat at Penarth, which, if you will tolerate my indulgence, I only mention because many years ago I played for this club, though not in 1913!\n\nGwyn\n\nThe gentleman in this photograph is Luitenant (Acting Captain) Norman Reid DSO., MC.
