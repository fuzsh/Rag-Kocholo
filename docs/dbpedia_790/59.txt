An inquiry into the death of a Little Catalina man has been told that people in the community feared Norman Reid.

Reid, a schizophrenic, was shot and killed by an RCMP officer when he confronted police with an axe last August.

Reid's cousin, Richard Rumbolt testified Friday that several times a year, Reid would stop taking his medication. Rumbolt said word would spread through town, and people would start locking their doors at night.

Reid's neighbour, Wade Eddy also testified that at one point, Reid threatened to cut off his head and drink his blood.

More residents of Little Catalina are expected to take the stand on Monday.
