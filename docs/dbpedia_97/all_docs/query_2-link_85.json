Featuring short stories by important writers such as Giovanni Verga, Grazia Deledda, Anna Maria Ortese, Livia De Stefani, and Silvana La Spina, the collection also includes testimonies by famous witnesses Maria Saladino, Felicia Impastato, Letizia Battaglia, and Rita Atria, who provide personal, often terrifying, accounts of their experiences with the Mafia. The stories, dating from the 1880s to the 1990s, offer a sampling of the diverse ways that Italians, as writers and citizens bearing witness, have represented the Mafia and crime in various historical contexts. While addressing the important values, myths, and images associated with the Mafia, the stories examine the many spheres of Mafia activity and the organization’s influence on business, politics, the church, family life, Sicilian culture, and Italian society as a whole. Robin Pickering-Iazzi’s thoughtful and engaging introduction charts key periods in the history of Italy and the Mafia, and profiles each of the authors in the collection, noting their major works in Italian as well as those available in English. Mafia and Outlaw Stories from Italian Life and Literature takes an original and intriguing approach to the subject of the Mafia, and offers unique insight into its historical impact on Italian society and culture.

Viewing the Mafia and Outlaws through Italian Eyes\n\nIt’s so funny because it’s so real ... The only difference between Tony Soprano and me is that he’s a mob boss. Charles Albrecht, New York Times, 2000 After a number of such stories, the scent of orange and lemon blossoms starts to smell of corpses. Leopoldo Franchetti, 1876\n\nSince the publication of Mario Puzo’s explosive best-seller The Godfather in 1969, a string of American novels, feature films, and television series have claimed to take us inside the minds, hearts, and ‘families’ of Mafia bosses. The significance and appeal of such stories among mass audiences in the United States have not escaped commentators, who underscore just how embedded the figure of the Mafia mobster is in the fabric of American popular culture. More to the point, in the wake of the acclaim garnered by the HBO hit series The Sopranos, Caryn James suggests that ‘feeling inside a Mafia family has become a cultural touchstone.’1 If so, this sense of being privy to insider information may lead viewers and readers to think that by now they have witnessed all there is to know about the so-called secret society of Cosa Nostra (Our Thing). In fact, the features of the ‘made men’ and the plotting of their family exploits, trials, and tribulations clearly vary over the years, in vein with the changes in American society, culture, and target audiences. While investigating this field of inquiry in Hollywood Italians, Peter Bondanella insightfully charts the richly variegated, complex\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ncast of Italian wise guys in the gangster-film genre, comedy, and television series produced from the silent era to the postmodern ‘Sopranos.’ Furthermore, books like Lynda Milito’s autobiographical Mafia Wife reveal secrets of ‘family life’ that dash seductive images of the mafioso. Notwithstanding this diversity, the ways many Mafia stories are told on screen and off tend to appeal to American audiences’ sympathies, in part by virtue of the insistent justification of the characters’ criminal acts.2 To be sure, such appeals offer important evidence about engaging desires, fears, fantasies, and values in the constantly changing landscape of American society. But they also run risks. Viewing mafiosi exclusively through the lens of American novels and films contributes to the tendency to take popular images of the Mafia and the criminal association that bears the same name and operates in Italian territory for one and the same thing. Furthermore, it encourages the inclination to collapse crucial distinctions between images of the Mafia as produced by the American cultural imagination and the various perceptions and meanings of it in Italian culture.3 This collection features stories from life and literature in Italy that make it possible for readers to discover, appreciate, and think about the variety of different ways in which Italian authors and witnesses have spoken about the Mafia as well as related figures or myths bearing upon it. Some readers may already be familiar with Leonardo Sciascia’s novels The Day of the Owl and To Each His Own, which earned him enduring regard in the 1960s as the authority on literature, the Mafia, and Sicilian culture. More recently, such novels as The Shape of Water (2002) and The Terra-cotta Dog (2002) have introduced the American public to Andrea Camilleri’s Montalbano mysteries, a virtual obsession among many Italians. Yet, as we see here, Italy has a long-standing, mercurial tradition of fiction and non-fiction writings that scrutinizes the Mafia from distinct intellectual and creative angles of vision. Indeed, the short stories and excerpts from novels selected for this collection represent works by some of Italy’s most talented, award-winning storytellers. They range from Giovanni Verga, renowned for transporting readers into the lives of Sicilian peasants and townspeople, to the Nobel Prize–winner Grazia Deledda, whose enthralling outlaw tales expose forbidden passions, deeds, and dreams. Similarly, nearly a century after its original publication, Luigi Natoli’s gripping saga of the secret Blessed Paulists sect continues to delight readers, many of whom retell their exploits from memory. The recipients of several literary prizes, Silvana La Spina and Amelia\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n5\n\nCrisantino may also surprise if not shock us with their stories, which strip away the mythic guise of the Mafia’s benevolent power. In the second section of the volume, testimonies provided by women of diverse generations who have witnessed first-hand the violent realities produced by the Mafia in their families and communities make an immeasurable contribution to our understanding of the various cosche (Mafia clans or families) and how they relate to the history of the Mafia’s enterprises in business, society, politics, and culture.4 Maria Saladino, Rita Atria, and Felicia Impastato lived in biological families adhering to Mafia culture, as determined by the mafiosi heading them. Letizia Battaglia has earned international fame for her photography documenting the infamous Mafia wars in Palermo, as well as the infinite facets of Sicilian life and culture. Each of these women has made remarkable achievements in the fight to defeat the Mafia. Spanning over a century, the selections of fiction and non-fiction here offer a sampling of the diversified ways that Italians, as writers and citizens bearing witness, have represented the Mafia and related topics in various historical contexts, dating back to the 1800s. Most contemporary scholars locate the beginnings of the Mafia in the founding of the modern Italian nation (1860) and the development of agrarian capitalism, though certain values and practices that come to be associated with the Mafia through its own acts of appropriation are evident well before then.5 For example, a pronounced sense of honour, individual autonomy, and omertà, a code of silence in the face of any state authority, are prominent features of Sicilian mores well before the 1800s. Likewise, scholars have traced the existence of such loosely associated, secret criminal societies as the Stuppaghieri, operating in the area of Monreale, and the Fratuzzi, controlling territory around Bagheria, back to the early nineteenth century. However, the earliest recorded references to the Mafia as criminal association appear in the 1860s, initiating the varied tradition of discourses to which the stories featured here contribute. In view of the sobering issues these authors put under scrutiny, it may be surprising that the first work in Italian literary history to portray the Mafia is a two-act comedy, written in Sicilian dialect by Gaspare Mosca and titled I mafiusi di la Vicaria (The mafiosi of the Vicaria). Set in the imposing Palermo Ucciardone prison in the year 1854, the play was first staged in 1862 by a Palermo theatre troupe. It met with resounding success and was taken on the road to theatres in Rome, Turin, and Milan, thus\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nputting into farcical public view the inside story of a Mafia boss and underlings, their nefarious dealings, and particular jargon.6 With more grievous implications and consequences, Prefect Marchese Filippo Gualtiero authored the first state document employing the term Mafia, alerting the Italian government to the rule of criminality creating dangerous conditions in Sicily in 1865, and calling for the deployment of troops. Yet more pertinent here are the writings by the intellectuals Pasquale Villari and Leopoldo Franchetti, owing to their formative influences on images of the Mafia and debates about its causes, agents, and effects on Sicily and the Italian nation.7 In March 1875 Villari first published analyses of the camorra, brigandage, and the Mafia in the form of three letters to the editor of the publication Opinione (Opinion), soon united with other articles in his famous Le lettere meridionali (Southern letters, 1878). Observing that the social strata of gabelloti (leaseholders), middlemen hired by absentee estate owners to lease out the land, and field guards represent the primary source of mafiosi, he describes the Mafia’s virulent power to generate profit and violence, declaring, ‘The Mafia makes money, takes its own revenge, kills, and even produces popular uprisings’ (88). In similar fashion, Franchetti dispels any lingering illusions we may have of an ‘old Mafia’ operating as a benign system of mutual aid for the downtrodden. Based upon his on-site investigation of Sicily in 1876, he defines the Mafia as ‘an industry of crime and violence.’ (See John Dickie, Cosa Nostra, 50.) The terms and definitions composed by Villari and Franchetti form one of the prominent veins of thought concerning the Mafia in Sicily, a controversial topic in the late 1800s, which inspired numerous studies in economics, sociology, and political science, as well as articles in newspapers and popular magazines. In this context, Verga’s suspenseful short story ‘The Gold Key’ (1884) is especially thoughtprovoking. Here, though the armed field guard Surfareddu is never referred to explicitly as a mafioso, he is clearly encoded as such by the author’s depiction of him as an agent of violence for hire to protect estate owners’ property, the code by which he lives, and other signs. Through developments in plot and character, the author subtly delineates the roles he plays, directly or peripherally, in the collusive relations of power between landowners, representatives of the Catholic Church, and agents of the law. Verga also raises questions about justice both before and after the Unification of Italy in 1860.\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n7\n\nThough published just one year after Verga’s tale, ‘An Episode of Brigandage’ by Carolina Invernizio offers many significant points of contrast. Created from the perspective of a woman author of northern Italy, the story within a story gives us a unique view of brigandage, a popular theme in literature by Sicilian authors, which has profound implications for considering images of the Mafia in the social and cultural imagination.8 Brigandage is the name the Italian state applied to what were predominantly peasant rebellions against the oppressive conditions of poverty levied by landlords in the southern provinces near Naples and in Sicily. Thus, political features historically distinguish brigandage, making it distinct from the Mafia.9 In the sphere of cultural production, however, the Mafia enlists for its own service legendary aspects of the brigands as rebels defending the weak against a cruel, unjust society. The creative incorporation of such popular cultural myths into the ideology of the Mafia serves several functions. As Salvatore Lupo tells us, it provides rules that ‘guarantee the organization’s survival, cohesion, and capacity to find consensus as well as to inspire terror both on the inside and out.’ 10 Invernizio’s detailed, vivid descriptions of the brigands haunting the Edenic outlands in the provinces of Naples enable readers to pose intriguing questions concerning how the ideals, actions, and notion of justice she attributes to them may relate to those ascribed to Mafia characters in the stories by Verga, Nuccio, or La Spina, for example. Luigi Natoli’s serialized novel I Beati Paoli (The Blessed Paulists, 1909–10) is perhaps the most important literary work implicated in the mythic construction of rebel outlaw heroes secretly united to thwart an unjust system and execute justice for the powerless, of which the Mafia partakes. Jane C. Schneider and Peter T. Schneider (1994) offer evidence of the associations made between this literary text and Mafia culture in everyday life. As they recall, during their 1969 stay in a Sicilian town a local mafioso advised them that if they really wanted to understand the spirit of the Mafia they should read I Beati Paoli.11 Contrary to such claims of parentage with the idealized image of the Blessed Paulists, there are no historical ties between the Sicilian Mafia and the secret sect. Instead, according to the multivolume diaries penned by the Marquis Villabianca in the late 1700s, the Blessed Paulists were a secret society of vindicators, whose origins purportedly reached back to the 1100s. As the excerpts from Natoli’s popular historical novel illustrate, he is a masterful storyteller, whose riveting\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\ntale of murder, stolen birthright, torture, and vindication may engage readers on many levels. As he takes us through the twists and turns of Palermo streets and the subterranean city, he devotes meticulous attention to historical details shaping the geographic, social, political, and cultural landscape, conjuring life in the 1700s before our very eyes. At the same time, the story may appeal to common fantasies for the way he reveals the secret beliefs, rituals, and deeds of the sect, whose members right the wrongs suffered by the powerless, bringing down swift, unerring justice on the heads of the powerful who abuse their station in life. Palermo also figures prominently in Giuseppe Ernesto Nuccio’s short story ‘Testagrossa Agrees’ (1911). This author, however, depicts the markets and neighbourhoods of early-twentieth-century Palermo through the experiences of a homeless child. Renowned for his realistic portrayals of the dire conditions of urban poverty contributing to social problems, here Nuccio unites strains of humour, suspense, and tragedy as he draws us into a day in the life of Testagrossa, a most memorable character. The dramatic narration of the adventures encountered by this young boy, one of the countless children left to fend for themselves on the streets, describes his adversities, pain, and pleasures, while highlighting the differences between good and evil, the laws ruling the state and street, and the relations between poverty and crime. His struggle to negotiate these conflicting forces assumes tragically epic dimensions, mirrored by the story of chivalrous kings and knights performed by marionettes at the Opera dei pupi, the popular puppet theatre. This story is also remarkable for its critical perspective on the subject of the Mafia and children, a topical problem addressed in numerous works of Italian literature, film, and research. This trend is exemplified by Maria Rosa Cutrufelli’s novel Canto al deserto (Singing to the desert, 1994) and Franco Occhiogrosso’s edited volume of articles Ragazzi della mafia (Children of the Mafia, 1993). As an antecedent, Nuccio’s story explodes the common notion that the Mafia does not prey upon or harm children, thus offering interesting points of comparison with the fictional tale by La Spina and the life stories told by Livia De Stefani, Saladino, and Impastato. The historical frame of Italian Fascism and its antimafia front bears upon the selections by Grazia Deledda, Maria Occhipinti, and Livia De Stefani, which feature various types of outlaw figures – the hired killer, the member of the Mano nera (Black Hand), and the rural Mafia\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n9\n\nboss. In May 1924, nearly two years after becoming prime minister of Italy, Benito Mussolini made a trip to Sicily for a series of speeches that signalled the impending battle he would wage against the Mafia. Before the audience in Agrigento, he proclaimed he ‘could not tolerate a few hundred criminals holding down a population as magnificent as yours.’12 Indeed, for several reasons, including ideology, the changing political system, and the law-abiding public image of Italy Mussolini endeavoured to project, the Fascist state would target what has been called the Mafia state. From an ideological standpoint, the Fascist regime sought the complete loyalty and obedience of its citizens, members of the nation as ‘family’ headed by Mussolini.13 Thus, even legitimate associations that might divide loyalties or challenge Fascist authority were outlawed. Furthermore, as Servadio notes, once Mussolini abolished elections in 1925, as one of several measures to consolidate the Fascist dictatorship, he had no need for the votes produced and sold by the Mafia, since the 1870s, to political figures and parties best serving its interests. That same year, Mussolini launched the antimafia campaign, designed and executed by Cesare Mori, the prefect of Palermo. Significantly, a new law was instituted the following year, stipulating that citizens could denounce anyone ‘described by vox publica as bosses, partners or sympathizers of associations which have a criminal character or are in any way dangerous to the community.’14 In such cases, the individual could be arrested and jailed, or sent into forced residence, with no trial. Just two years later Mori declared that the Mafia had been eradicated. However, the effectiveness of the violent, repressive measures utilized by Mori is not so clear.15 Some people made use of the 1926 law to settle personal scores or to put leftist leaders out of circulation. And though hundreds of mafiosi were arrested, they tended to belong to the lower ranks. In fact, some historians argue that it was not uncommon for Mafia bosses to become prominent figures in the Fascist party. The excerpts from De Stefani’s autobiography La mafia alle mie spalle (The Mafia at my back, 1991) reveal extraordinary insights about the rural Mafia during Fascism and in the postwar years.16 Born and raised in an aristocratic family that resided in Palermo, in 1930 she inherited the large ex-feudal estate of Virzì, located in the interior of Sicily near Alcamo. As the autobiographer recalls the impressions, experiences, and events linked to her attempts to actively manage the estate business, she produces vivid evidence of the weapons\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nemployed by the mafiosi in order to exert full power over the people, land, and affairs that fall within the territory they rule. She documents as well her face-to-face meeting with the famed Mafia boss Vincenzo Rimi and his son Filippo, which, she speculates, may be the only time a woman negotiated with a boss in the history of the traditional Mafia of western Sicily. De Stefani’s life story is also unique for the way it inscribes the particular perspective of a woman estate owner in the descriptions of the peasant workers in her employ, and how they are situated vulnerably in the power relations shaping their lives and livelihoods. Writing from different social positions and geographical locations, both De Stefani and Maria Occhipinti bring to light different dimensions of the crucial subject of the Mafia and its relation to the peasant class. Although reasons vary according to territory and socio-historical factors, as most historians agree, since the 1800s the Mafia has levelled its fiercest tools of oppression at the peasants, often with the aim of increasing its power through the alignment with wealthy property owners and political representatives of the Italian state. Furthermore, from the 1800s into the post–Second World War period, the efforts that members of the peasant class undertook to agitate for agrarian reforms posed challenges to the established system of power, and thus the Mafia. In fact, Umberto Santino credits the formation of the Fasci siciliani (Sicilian leagues), organized by peasants and leftist activists in the 1890s, with being the first organized battle against the Mafia.17 In the case of the Sicilian leagues, which is hardly an exception, Mafia and government forces put down the peasant acts of militancy. Thus, it is not surprising if De Stefani’s recollections of incidents bearing signs of the Mafia that befall peasant workers in the area have no hint of benevolence. On the contrary, the acts of intimidation and coercion threatening De Stefani as the owner of Virzì have potentially disastrous implications for the sharecroppers and labourers. Elaborating the subject of the lower classes more fully, Occhipinti’s fictional tale, drawn from the story ‘The Carob Tree,’ focuses exclusively on the beliefs, traditions, and occupations that go into the making of life in a peasant community some time during the years of Fascism. In terms verging on the idyllic, the narrator describes what binds the neighbours together – their poverty, the roles of gender and generation structuring the family, the ethics of work and honesty, and even forms of popular entertainment. With the arrival of an Italian family repatriated from America, whose father is rumoured to be a\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n11\n\nmember of the Black Hand, the author richly portrays the attitudes and behaviours demonstrated towards the newcomers and what the male head of household comes to represent in relation to social mores.18 Occhipinti’s images of the criminal and the thoughts that he elicits among the peasants offer interesting points of contrast and comparison with more recent representations of the Black Hand in Melania G. Mazzucco’s Vita. A Novel (2005) and Francis Ford Coppola’s well-known Godfather II (1974). Published during the Fascist dictatorship on the cultural page of the nationally distributed newspaper Corriere della sera (22 February 1928), Deledda’s short story ‘The Hired Killer’ speaks not about the Mafia or an affiliated member of a criminal association. As indicated by the title, the author creates a thought-provoking profile of a hired killer, a familiar figure in literature about the Mafia (Sciascia’s To Each His Own, for instance), and in the history of the cosche. Indeed, at various historical junctures, the criminal association has made use of brigands, bandits, and mercenary killers, a point raised in Rita Atria’s diary entries. While Deledda unfolds the tale of the protagonist’s fortunes living inside and outside the laws regulating civil society, her imaginings on what goes into the making of a criminal engage with themes developed in several stories, especially in The Blessed Paulists and ‘Testagrossa Agrees.’ She invites us to think about the relations between the institution of the law delivering ‘justice’ and popular notions of justice; the reasons that drive essentially honest citizens to become outlaws; and the implications of taking the ‘law’ into one’s own hands, becoming judge and executioner. Revisiting the tumultuous landscape of postwar Italy, marked by a resurgence of banditry with links to the Mafia and the separatist movement, Anna Maria Ortese’s ‘Montelepre’ beckons readers on a journey through land and time to the birthplace of Salvatore Giuliano.19 Among the most famous, controversial figures in Italian history, Giuliano turned bandit in 1943 after killing a carabiniere who had caught him with a bag of black-market grain. For some seven years, Giuliano and his band committed an unbroken string of armed robberies and kidnappings and trafficked in the black market, with profits going primarily towards funding the separatist movement, which he had joined in 1945. For some, such exploits lent a romantic aura to the bandit, whose dark, brooding features were captured on the front pages of newspapers and the covers of such magazines as Time. At the same time, Giuliano and his band perpetrated violent\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nattacks on the state, ambushing and killing carabinieri, and on members of the Communist and Socialist parties. Two of their most infamous assaults remain deeply inscribed in Italian cultural memory. The first is the 1947 Massacre at Portella della ginestra, in which Giuliano’s band opened machine-gun fire on peasant women, men, and children gathered to celebrate May Day, killing eight of them and wounding thirty-three. Then, in August 1949, the band attacked the barracks at Bellolampo, leaving seven carabinieri dead and eleven wounded. Such heinous violence might suggest Giuliano would be viewed as purely criminal. But ideas about the bandit, his death, and what he symbolized have remained equivocal since he died. Once Giuliano lost his usefulness for the Mafia, he lost their protection too, and he was found murdered on 14 July 1950, the details of his death buried beneath a cover-up involving, it seems, members of the government, the carabinieri, and the Mafia. In the aftermath, he became a symbol of sharply divided ideas and feelings. For some he was a heroic rebel of the people and a fallen martyr for the cause of Sicilian independence. Others saw him as a traitor to the peasants and their struggle, and a cold-blooded killer. It is precisely this sense of the equivocal that Ortese conjures and attempts to penetrate in 1955, as she and a fellow traveller make their way from Palermo to Bellolampo, and finally Montelepre. The voicing of the travellers’ desires to undertake an adventure in romantic lands famed for banditry as well as the distancing of the territory through sensorial and animal imagery echo the tendency to exoticize Sicily, denying its participation in history, civilization, and the changes of modern life. Yet Ortese’s impressionistic representation of the journey to Montelepre, a town awash in pink, green, and white, and her attempts to read the people’s faces for what they may say about Giuliano form a unique, provocative document of the times. Both La Spina’s short story ‘The Truvatura’ (1992) and Amelia Crisantino’s novel Cercando Palermo (1990), ricipient of the 1990 ‘Luna-Arcidonna’ Award, exemplify aspects of the groundswell of antimafia cultural production in Italian literature, film, the visual arts, and daily life that began in the 1980s. As revelations from the Palermo maxi-trials grabbed headlines, informing the public about new developments in the prosecution of some four hundred suspected mafiosi, which was conducted by Judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, thoughts about the Mafia, antimafia forces, the justice system, and the Italian state preoccupied many Italians,\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n13\n\nincluding intellectuals and artists working in various media.20 Published in the marvellous collection entitled Scirocco, La Spina’s tale exhibits unexpected affinities with Verga’s ‘The Gold Key.’ In the first lines of the story, set in the rural Margherito district, the author drops readers into the mystery of a young boy who has been found murdered, evoking the surrounding countryside’s sights, smells, and sounds. As we follow in the steps of the carabinieri investigating the tragic case, popular beliefs, legends, and folklore emerge as part of the particular place and the chorus of townspeople inhabiting it. La Spina subtly crafts a dark web of power relations, which we alone ultimately perceive. In contrast, the excerpts from Crisantino’s novel afford a look at the traces of the Mafia in postmodern Palermo. Here, the spaces of streets, markets, cafes, and apartment buildings differ markedly from those traversed by the Blessed Paulists or Testagrossa, for they materialize polyphonically, through the eyes and words of several different, unforgettable characters: the Turinese Armando Berti, who has just earned his PhD from the Oxford Institute of Economics and Sociology, and arrives to theorize Palermo in terms of a non-sense city; the carriage driver, a visionary philosopher whose tourist routes include what he has named the route of civil indignation, featuring sites where the Mafia has murdered prominent public figures committed to justice and the defeat of the criminal association. The excerpts featured here represent the voices and views of three other characters – Signora Olga, her husband Don Pino, and Ida Benelli. Each of these figures says something about the formation and fortunes of the mafioso, as well as his relationships with ‘grey zoners,’ a term indicating individuals who are not affiliated members of the Mafia, but may traffic in information or favours. These forms of complicity enable Mafia activities to flourish. Among the other particularly important elements of the chapters of Cercando Palermo appearing here are, for example, the way the narrative both challenges the notion that unlawful behaviour, and the south in general, are necessarily irrational and alludes to the potential relationship between the Allied occupation of Sicily and the Mafia.21 Indeed, some scholars argue that the American and British forces played key roles in the reconstruction and legitimation of the Mafia power base, strategically situating it to expand operations in the black market, postwar reconstruction, and politics. Furthermore, with the character Ida Benelli, Crisantino calls our attention to the relations between women and the\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nMafia’s entrepreneurial criminal activities. Since the 1980s, when explosive newspaper headlines reported cases of Italian women working as drug mules, registering Mafia properties in their own names, and performing various services in the kidnapping industry, the roles women craft in both Mafia and antimafia associations have attracted increasing attention. In film, for example, the protagonist in Roberta Torre’s Angela (2003) makes drug drops as nonchalantly as she delivers shoes to her legitimate clients, thus calling to mind Benelli’s cool-headed calculations on crime for profit. In contrast, Marco Amenta’s 1997 documentary One Girl against the Mafia gives voice to Rita Atria’s courageous acts as a state’s witness against the Mafia. To their credit, such authors as Renate Siebert and Liliana Madeo have gathered interviews, historical materials, and documents that provide invaluable information about the range of stands and actions women take in relation to Mafia and antimafia activities. The testimonial writings appearing in this collection represent but a few of the voices from the 1950s to the 1990s who have broken the silence and spoken out against the Mafia and its crimes.22 Drawing upon their diverse experiences of living in close private and public quarters with Mafia cosche battling over various territories, each of the speakers reveals her particular observations, thoughts, emotions, dreams, and strategies of antimafia intervention. For instance, Maria Saladino gives words to the feelings of shock, shame, and disillusionment produced by the crushing discovery that she is the daughter of a mafioso. Her testimony, like Rita Atria’s, inscribes the brief gesture to somehow deny any association between the father’s identity as mafioso and the vicious murders committed by the Mafia. However, she ultimately does not equivocate, stating that even the so-called ‘old Mafia’ was the Mafia nonetheless, and spread terror. It is significant that Saladino’s testimony suggests that she rebuilds her identity, marshalling the Christian principles she holds true and her desire to eradicate violence and the Mafia. She commits her life and work to building youth centres that provide children with a safe place to stay, care, education, and job training. As she forcefully explains, such works threaten the Mafia, which seeks to keep the poor locked in poverty so the criminal association has a monopoly on potential aid, and thus influence. The cases of Felicia Impastato and Rita Atria exhibit certain similarities, for the way both women come to experience and publicly\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n15\n\nrepresent biological families fatally divided between Mafia and antimafia beliefs, values, and practices. Felicia Impastato recalls how she was caught in the middle of violent conflicts that flared between her husband Luigi, associated with the powerful Mafia boss of Cinisi, Gaetano Badalamenti, and her son Giuseppe. Like Saladino, Giuseppe Impastato devoted his life to rescuing young people from the Mafia’s sway in the 1960s and 1970s. He deployed various strategies, creating cultural centres, a radio station, newsletters, and demonstrations, in order to inform young people about the Mafia as an industry of crime producing poverty, drug addiction, and murder. On the night of 8 May 1978 members of the Mafia staged Giuseppe Impastato’s murder to look like a suicide or a failed terrorist bombing. They placed his body over a bomb that they exploded on the railway tracks. Felicia Impastato’s memories of those years, her son’s life and death, and the various investigations into the murder and the Mafia have come to exemplify the possibility of lived transformations from adherence to Mafia codes and behaviours to the development of antimafia ethics and practices. Indeed, as Felicia Impastato declares in her revealing interview with Anna Puglisi and Umberto Santino, La mafia in casa mia (The Mafia in my home, 1987), after the murder of her son Giuseppe it was assumed that she would retreat into silence, as would be customary in her case, as a widow of a mafioso. Instead, she began speaking out to everyone who would listen, denouncing the Mafia. In many ways, Rita Atria has become a powerful symbol of the fight for truth, justice, and the defeat of the Mafia. She was raised in a family structured by such Mafia codes of behaviour as vendetta and omertà. Yet after the murders of her father Vito and brother Nicola, who were both agents and victims of the Mafia, she followed the example of her sister-in-law, Piera Aiello, and became a collaborator with justice. The testimonial writings that she produced, which appear here, include passages from an autobiography she had begun to write, entries from the diary she kept, and the essay exam that she wrote on the assigned topic of the Mafia. They provide incredible insights on several problems. For example, Atria’s commitment to justice and to providing crucial testimony for the prosecution of several mafiosi is beyond reproach. At the same time, the entries in her diary, where she confesses her innermost secrets and fears, suggest that the recreation of her identity, as a collaborator with justice, is hardly easy. On the con-\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\ntrary, her perceptions of self highlight fragmentation, confusion, and wounds, expressing the profound trauma and loss that may derive, in part, from divided beliefs, loyalties, and loves. Providing official testimony about her father’s and brother’s criminal activities, for example, clearly serves the cause of justice, yet also betrays the two people she loves most – her two stars, as she calls them. Nonetheless, she expresses the conviction that the Mafia can be defeated, calling upon everyone to defeat first the Mafia within. Furthermore, she voices hope, which depends upon young people being made aware of a different world, where the Mafia does not determine who you are and what you do. Hope, the strength of women, and the engaged commitment to change are also prominent ideals driving the life, art, and testimony of Letizia Battaglia, a photographer of international renown. While sharing her particular notions of photography as socio-cultural practice, she brings to life her memories of the years when she worked as a photojournalist for the newspaper L’Ora, covering sites of atrocious Mafia murders that reportedly claimed the lives of some one thousand people, many of them civic leaders, from the late 1970s to the early1990s. Battaglia’s photographs of Mafia crime scenes had key importance in the prosecution of suspected Mafia criminals, as well as in the antimafia movement. Yet her work is equally important for the way it captures visual images of joy, goodness, and richly unique features of Sicily and the individuals making a life there. Battaglia’s descriptions of the various initiatives she has undertaken to re-appropriate sites languishing in Mafia hands and transform the city of Palermo enable a deeper appreciation of what is at stake and the myriad ways to work for change. By making available a variety of fiction and non-fiction writings about the Mafia and the myths that have gone into the making of its name, this collection may serve as a point of departure for an archeological project of gathering and examining different Italian voices that, for well over a century, have spoken in diverse mediums, and continue to make themselves heard. As illustrated by the writings featured here, there is a far-reaching tradition of cultural critique scrutinizing the Mafia from different vantage points. In the process, authors and witnesses turn their keen eyes upon related issues in various spheres of living: social attitudes, customs, and conditions; gender, class, and generational relations; the institutions of state and church; the mean-\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n17\n\nings and workings of justice, as well as the means to achieve it. These stories from Italian life and literature also enable us to study the ways in which the Mafia appropriates certain popular legends and myths to serve its purposes. They thus promote an appreciation of the distinctions between Mafia and Sicilian culture and, perhaps, make new views of American popular culture possible as well. Moreover, the authors’ different ways of speaking about the Mafia also open discussions about ideals, values, practices, and dreams that have long been engaged in the transformation of Italian life and society.\n\nNOTES 1 See Caryn James, ‘Addicted to a Mob Family Potion,’ collected with articles by Charles Albrecht and Stephen Holden, among others, in The New York Times on the Sopranos. Many cultural critics have examined the representations of the Mafia in American popular fiction and film. Most pertinent here are Chris Messenger, The Godfather and American Culture; Peter Bondanella, Hollywood Italians; and George De Stefano, ‘Ungood Fellas.’ 2 See Elena Brancati and Carlo Muscetta for this Italian perspective, which they present in La letteratura sulla mafia (Literature about the Mafia). It should also be noted that Italian cinema has produced films about the Mafia and the code of honour in the tradition of Italian comedy, which tends to include strains of social critique. Some examples include Pietro Germi’s Seduced and Abandoned (1964) and Roberto Benigni’s Johnny Stecchino (1991). 3 On a related note, George De Stefano makes the crucial point that there is a prominent tendency in the United States to conflate the Mafia with the regional culture of Sicily and Italian culture in general. 4 See Renate Siebert’s ground-breaking work Secrets of Life and Death, in which she examines a complex variety of positions that Italian women adopt in relation to Mafia culture structuring familial relations, to the criminal association, and to the antimafia movement and initiatives. Revelations made by male members of the Italian Mafia who have turned state’s evidence are available in Pino Arlacchi’s Men of Dishonor, among other works. 5 See Jane C. Schneider and Peter T. Schneider, ‘Mafia, Antimafia, and the Question of Sicilian Culture’; John Dickie, Cosa Nostra; Raimondo Catanzaro, Il delitto come impresa (Crime as Enterprise); and Umberto Santino,\n\n18\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nIntroduction ‘L’omicidio mafioso’ (Mafia Murder). In addition to securing monopolies over every resource imaginable, from water rights to illegal slaughterhouses, in the 1800s members of the cosche created markets for violence and murder. See also Gaia Servadio’s analysis of the gabelloti (leaseholders). Several studies examine the key roles played by mafiosi and bandits in the 1860 revolution led by Garibaldi in Sicily, which culminated in the Unification of Italy. With respect to values and beliefs that have a longstanding history in Sicily, and may be appropriated by the Mafia, see Ida Fazio’s salient study ‘The Family, Honour and Gender in Sicily: Models and New Research.’ The play was published in 1896. Interestingly, Giuseppe Rizzotto, another member of the theatre troupe, revised the play, adding a third act that identified the incognito character as Francesco Crispi. See Nelson Moe’s The View from Vesuvius for brilliant analyses of the writings by Villari and Franchetti. All quotations from Villari are from the edition I mali dell’Italia (Italy’s Ills). Those from Franchetti appear in Condizioni politiche e amministrative della Sicilia (Political and Administrative Conditions of Sicily). Among the examples are Vincenzo Linares, Masnadiere siciliano (Sicilian Highwayman, 1841) and Nino Savarese Storia di un brigante (Story of a Brigand, 1931), as noted by Massimo Onofri. Maria Rosa Cutrufelli’s La briganta (1990, trans. The Woman Outlaw, 2004) combines extensive archival research on women brigands and literary invention, enriching the themes and problems represented in this body of writings. During the first five years of Post-Unification Italy, some 116,000 troops were deployed to quash brigand uprisings, resulting in the killing of over 5000 men and women engaged in the rebellions. John Dickie provides an insightful analysis of brigandage and notions of national Italian identity in his ‘Stereotypes of the Italian South 1860–1900.’ Onofri examines literary representations of brigandage and their relations to Sicilianism. Salvatore Lupo, Storia della mafia (Rome: Donzelli, 1993), 107–8. See ‘Mafia, Antimafia, and the Question of Sicilian Culture.’ Servadio reports that during trial proceedings, some lawyers for Mafia defendants invoke what we could call the Blessed Paulist defence, claiming a similar identity and role in an unjust society. Quoted in Servadio, Mafioso, 73. For a more comprehensive, meticulously researched historical analysis of Italian Fascism, the Mafia, and Sicily, see Christopher Duggan’s Fascism and the Mafia. It must be emphasized that as Italians negotiated the demands made by\n\nNot the Sopranos\n\n14 15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n19\n\nthe Fascist state, they adopted a full range of responses in their lives, work, and politics. Quoted in Servadio, Mafioso, 75. Servadio, Duggan, and Dickie all conduct examinations of the laws, policies, and tactics deployed in this campaign, and discuss its potential results. De Stefani creates a fictional portrait of a rural mafioso in her novel La vigna di uve nere (1953), published in English translation five years later with the title Black Grapes. In an interview with Sandra Petrignani (in Le signore della scrittura [Writing Women], 1984), De Stefani comments on the significance of the novel, stating she was ‘the first one in Italy to speak about the power of the mafioso as something that requires a particular kind of male character: violent, reserved, authoritarian, and protective, worshipping his own power and the submission of other people’ (94). See Umberto Santino, Storia del movimento antimafia (History of the Antimafia Movement). Such cycles of peasant agitation for land reform and acts of repression on the part of the Mafia and/or the Italian government continue well into the post–Second World War period. Brancati and Muscetta indicate that in the United States in 1929, an alliance between the Black Hand and the Mafia was ratified, and the resultant association was called Cosa Nostra. For different perspectives on the Black Hand see Servadio and Dickie. Bondanella conducts a fascinating analysis of the Black Hand in American films dating back to the silent era. Both Servadio and Dickie discuss the relationship between Salvatore Giuliano and the separatist movement, the Mafia, and prominent public figures of the time. Several highly informative histories and commentaries on Falcone, Borsellino, the Maxi-trials, and their aftermath have been written. In English, see Alexander Stille’s Excellent Cadavers. John Dickie also devotes substantial attention to these figures and events. Drawing upon military and government documents of the time, Servadio argues that the Allied forces had a strong hand in placing mafiosi in powerful positions controlling civic order and goods, and even colluded with the Mafia in the black market. More recently, scholars have begun to challenge some of these claims. Salvatore Lupo conducts a convincing examination of this kind in ‘The Allies and the Mafia.’ Among the forerunners is Francesca Serio, the mother of Salvatore Carnevale, the trade unionist working for agrarian reforms who was\n\n20\n\nIntroduction killed by the Mafia in 1955. During court proceedings, she publicly named the individuals involved. Francesca Serio’s experiences are represented in Carlo Levi’s famous work Le parole sono pietre (Words Are Stones, 1955). Siebert’s Secrets of Life and Death discusses the cases of other women who have taken the courageous step to speak out against the Mafia and its crimes. The testimony of Rita Atria, written in 1991–2, is the only one whose dating is certain. Those of Saladino, Impastato, and Battaglia were republished by Coppola Editore in 1998, but are drawn from earlier, different versions, and the sources are not cited.\n\nRecto Running Head\n\n21\n\nThe Gold Key giovanni verga\n\nIn the parish priest’s country house in Santa Margherita, they were reciting the holy rosary after dinner when they heard a gunshot in the night. The priest turned pale, the rosary still in his hand, and the women made the sign of the cross, pricking up their ears, while the dogs in the courtyard barked furiously. Almost immediately another gunshot returning fire thundered through the glen below Rocca. ‘Jesus and Mary! What on earth could it be?’ blurted the servant girl in the kitchen doorway. ‘Quiet everyone!’ exclaimed the priest, white as his nightcap. ‘Let me hear.’ He went over behind the window shutter. The dogs had quieted down, and outside you could hear the wind blowing through the glen. All of a sudden the barking started up again, louder than before, broken fitfully by the sound of a rock striking the door. ‘Don’t open it! Don’t open it for anyone!’ the priest yelled, running to get his carbine that hung over the head of his bed below the crucifix. His hands were trembling. Then in the midst of the din they heard someone outside the main entrance yell, ‘Open up, Father! It’s me, Surfareddu!’ No sooner had the estate manager living on the ground floor finally gone out to quiet down the dogs and unbolt the main door than the field guard Surfareddu came in, his face grim and the shotgun still warm in his hand. ‘What’s wrong, Grippino? What happened?’ the frightened priest asked. ‘What’s wrong, Your Lordship, is that while you are sleeping and resting, I’m risking life and limb guarding all your stuff,’ answered Surfareddu.\n\n22\n\nGiovanni Verga\n\nAnd he told them what had happened, standing in the doorway and swaying back and forth in his usual way. He couldn’t fall asleep because of the heat, and had gone to stand in the doorway of the hut for a moment, over there on the little terrace, when he heard a sound in the glen where the orchard was, a sound his ears alone knew, and Bellina’s, a mangy mongrel of skin and bones that stuck by his heels. They were knocking down oranges and other fruit in the orchard. A rustling sound the wind doesn’t make, then silent spells while they filled up their sacks. So he got the gun standing beside the hut door, that old flintlock shotgun with a long barrel and brass fittings that he had in his hand. Talk about destiny! Because that was the last night he was supposed to stay at Santa Margherita. He had given his notice to the parish priest at Easter, both of them in complete agreement. And on the first of September he was supposed to go to his new boss’s estate, the one in Vizzini. Just the day before he had turned in each and every thing to the priest. It was the last day in August, a pitch dark night without any stars. Bellina went ahead of him, her nose to the wind, silently, the way he had taught her. He walked along very slowly, picking his feet up high in the hay so you couldn’t hear it rustle. Every ten steps the dog turned to see if he was following her. When they got to the glen he softly said to Bellina, ‘Back!’ He took cover behind a large walnut tree. Then he let out a bellow, ‘Hey there! ...’ A bellow, God help us! – the priest was saying – that gave you goose-bumps when you heard it come from Surfareddu, a man who had committed more than one murder in his profession as field guard. ‘Then,’ replied Surfareddu, ‘then they shot at me point-blank – boom! Luckily I fired back at the flash of the rifle shot. There were three of them, and I heard screaming. Go look in the orchard, because the man I got must still be there.’ ‘Oh! What’ve you done, you scoundrel!’ exclaimed the priest, while the women screamed among themselves. ‘Now the judge and the rotten lawmen are going to come, and you’re leaving me in a mess!’ ‘This is the thanks I get, Your Lordship?’ Surfareddu snapped. ‘If they’d waited to steal from you after I’d left your service it was better for me too. I wouldn’t have had this other quarrel with the law.’ ‘Get off to the Grilli’s right now, and tell the estate manager I sent you. Then tomorrow you’ll get what you need. But don’t let anyone see you, for the love of God! Now that it’s prickly pear season, people\n\nThe Gold Key\n\n23\n\nare all over the hills. Who knows how much this thing is going to cost me. It would’ve been better if you’d turned a blind eye.’ ‘Oh no, Father! As long as I’m in your service, Surfareddu won’t suffer any dishonour of this sort! They knew that until August 31st I was the one taking care of your farm. So much the worse for them! I don’t waste my gunpowder for sure!’ And off he went with his rifle over his shoulder and Bellina following behind while it was still dark. No one slept a wink that night in the country house of Santa Margherita, for fear of the thieves and the thought of that man lying on the ground there in the orchard. At daylight, when wayfarers started to appear on the path across the way, at Rocca the parish priest, armed to the teeth and with all the peasants following behind, ventured to go and see what had happened. The women were yelling, ‘Don’t go, Your Lordship!’ But just outside the courtyard, they ran into Luigino, who had slipped in among all the people, getting underfoot. ‘Take this boy away,’ yelled his uncle the priest. ‘No! I want to go see too!’ the boy screamed. Afterwards, for as long as he lived, the spectacle that he had seen right before his eyes when he was so little stuck in his mind. He was just a few steps into the orchard, under an old, sick olive tree, lying on the ground, his nose the sooty colour of the dying. He had dragged himself on his hands and knees onto a heap of empty sacks, and stayed there the whole night. His companions had run away, taking the full sacks with them. There nearby was a stretch of dirt, gouged by fingernails and all black with blood. ‘Ah! Your Reverence,’ mumbled the dying man. ‘They killed me over a couple of olives!’ The parish priest gave absolution. Then toward noon, the judge arrived with the lawmen and was bent on taking it out on the parish priest and tying him up like a scoundrel. Luckily all the peasants were there and the estate manager with his family as witnesses. Nevertheless, the judge vented his anger on that servant of God who was a sort of old-fashioned baron with his overbearing ways, and he had men like Surfareddu working for him as field guards, and had people killed over a couple of olives. He wanted the murderer handed over dead or alive, and the parish priest swore up and down that he didn’t know anything about it. So much that just a bit more and the judge would declare him an accomplice and the one who gave the order, and have the rotten lawmen tie him up all the same. So they were yelling and\n\n24\n\nGiovanni Verga\n\ncoming and going under the orange trees in the orchard, while the doctor and the town registrar went about their tasks in front of the dead man laying on the empty sacks. Then they put the dining table in the shade of the orchard, because it was so hot, and the women coaxed the judge into eating a little something because it was getting late. The servant girl rolled up her sleeves: macaroni, tasty dishes of all sorts, and the women went out of their way so that the table wouldn’t make a bad impression on that occasion. The judge licked his fingers. Then the registrar pulled the tablecloth back a bit from a corner and quickly drew up ten lines for the statement, with the witnesses’ signatures and everything, while the judge had a cup of coffee made specially with the coffee machine, and the peasants watched from afar, half hidden among the orange trees. Finally, the parish priest went personally to get a bottle of aged Moscardello that would have made a dead man rise. Meanwhile, they had buried the other one as best they could under the old, sick olive tree. As he left, the judge accepted a bunch of flowers from the women, who had two beautiful baskets of chosen fruit put in the saddlebags on the registrar’s mule. And the parish priest accompanied them all the way to the end of the farm’s property. The following day a District messenger came to say that the judge had lost his watch-key in the orchard, and they should look for it carefully because it certainly had to be there. ‘Let me have two days’ time, and we’ll find it,’ the parish priest had him reply. Right away he wrote to a friend in Caltagirone to have him buy a watch-key – a beautiful gold key that cost him two onze,1 and he sent it to the judge, saying, ‘Is this the watch-key that you lost, Judge?’ ‘This is it, yes, sir,’ he replied. The trial smoothly went its way, so smoothly that 18602 suddenly came about, and Surfareddu returned to work as a field guard after Garibaldi was pardoned, until he got himself killed, struck with stones in a scuffle with some other field guards about a certain matter concerning grazing pastures. And the parish priest, whenever he would bring up the subject of all the things that happened that night and gave him so much to take care of, would say about the judge, back then, ‘He was an honest man! Because instead of losing just the watch-key, he could have had me look for the watch and chain too.’ In the orchard, under the old tree where the olive thief is buried, grow cabbages as big as the heads of babes.\n\nThe Gold Key\n\n25\n\nNOTES 1 The onza was a form of Sicilian currency, valued at 12.75 lire, a large sum in the mid-1800s. 2 Performing the first in the chain of actions to accomplish the Unification of Italy, Garibaldi and his thousand volunteers landed in Marsala in May of 1860, and launched a revolution against the ruling Bourbons, who ultimately abandoned Sicily. In October of the same year, following a plebiscite, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies became part of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nRecto Running Head\n\n26\n\nAn Episode of Brigandage carolina invernizio\n\nOne evening of late, a lively troupe of a few high-spirited women and vivacious young men was gathered in a villa. To break the monotony, they were chatting pleasantly among themselves, one saying this, another that. Suddenly a sprightly young woman jumped up to say: ‘Signor Carlo (he was a young engineer, generally admired for his spirit and distinguished manners), come on, tell us one of your stories! Some adventure, for example, you had during your travels. I can’t imagine you haven’t had any. But be careful not to break into lofty flights and not to digress more than necessary. And above all, try not to exaggerate.’ ‘Thank you for the compliment, which is as much as to say don’t concoct some silly story. Rest assured, I’ll heed the advice. I shall simply tell you about what happened to me during my last trip in the Neapolitan provinces. Are you satisfied?’ ‘Yes, yes! But get on with it ...’ The young man smiled, and seeing how attentive and ready to listen to him everyone was, he began his story: ‘Anyone who hasn’t spent some time in the Neapolitan area can’t imagine the unexpected radiance adorning nature there. The sun, when it rises and sets, bathes the lands with indescribable magnificence. Up above, you see the mountains in such a spectrum of deep red hues that even those with souls less poetic than mine would be carried away. A morning journey through these parts at the end of September has such attractions that its traces leave their mark on the soul for a long time. Since I was in Beneventano, I got the idea of taking an excursion up in the mountains, to admire the enchanting scenery that\n\nAn Episode of Brigandage\n\n27\n\ngreets the eye everywhere you look. It’s true that taking trips in the mountains was not very safe, and had kept travellers away from the area. But to tell the truth, I didn’t believe in brigands. I had heard a lot of talk about them during my travels, but had never met up with one. ‘On the other hand, I would have been very happy to know what a brigand might be, and I somehow felt that I would have experienced a certain satisfaction at being close to a person who was so dangerous. Therefore, I hired two mules and a guide. He was a strong young man of average height, but rather stocky in appearance, a real chatterbox, a poet should the occasion arise. So I expected to have good company. At first we came upon a lot of villas, rustic houses, the sort of rustic houses where herdsmen and shepherds usually live. But then the path became steep and rocky, worn into the bare sandstone. For as far as I could see in every direction, there wasn’t a sign of a living creature. ‘The further along we went, the more the scene changed appearance. I stopped for a moment on those cliffs, terrified by the grandiosity of the mountainous spectacle that appeared before me. On one side gaped the dark throat of a deep chasm, whose depths were impenetrable to the eye. But it looked to be bristling with intricate masses of thorns and brambles. On the other side, a thick forest stood behind a very sheer mountain, barren of trees or grass. Further off was a valley, with meadows, fields, country homes. Then the view stretched into the distance, the objects becoming smaller until everything finally disappeared in the horizon. In the meantime, we heard the sound of a distant country song, with a chorus of country girls singing along and the mountains echoing the words. A light breeze was gently blowing, invigorating our limbs. It heightened my imagination, and without my bidding I felt my soul transported to that sense of sweetness one experiences at the first smile of chaste love, at the throbbing that moves the first tender friendship. Our mules had little bells hanging from their necks, which made a tinkling sound, the only one that could be heard in those parts. We had gone about four miles when my guide got off his mule and carefully wrapped up its bells, doing likewise to the ones on my mule. In a low voice he said, “Here we have to be careful and stay absolutely quiet. A single word or a sound could alert the brigands. You see those woods, Signore? That’s where they hide. No one would dare go through them. They go a little here and a little there, depending on which way the wind blows. Spirits are also in there with them, and at night, on those slopes, you see ghosts, monsters, skeletons, and odd lights.”\n\n28\n\nCarolina Invernizio\n\n‘I was laughing heartily at his words when my guide suddenly exclaimed, “I think I hear the trampling of footsteps ... Don’t you hear something, Signore?” ‘I reigned in my mule and strained my ears. It was a rather faint sound in the trees. “It’s the wind,” I said. ‘“No, no Signore, it’s them. May the Virgin Mary and Saint Gennaro protect us!” ‘We spurred our mounts’ flanks, but in vain. The mules just trod along. While I kept silent and my guide cursed, the shots of firearms reached our ears and a few bullets whistled over our heads. ‘“My God!” screamed my guide. He slid off his mule and took off at such a run down the other side of the mountain that I lost sight of him in a few minutes. Still shaken by surprise, I quickly regained my senses when I saw eight men armed to the hilt appear at my sides. Alone, unarmed, with no idea where I was, it would have been folly to try to defend myself. At first I thought they might just want to search me, and I was preparing myself to spare them such an inconvenience when one of them said to me: ‘“Slow down! Slow down ... We want a lot more than your money bag. When a prize bird happens our way, we don’t let it fly away so easily. Whether you want to or not, you have to come with us. If you resist, these will be enough to keep you quiet.” Then half a dozen knives were levelled with the tip of their blades pointed right at me. But I fearlessly stood my ground, piercing my lips in such a look of disdain for death that the brigands, won over, slowly lowered their weapons and looked upon me more favorably, since courage is also necessary in crime. ‘They made me get off the mule, and tied a rope around my waist. One of the brigands took the ends of the rope, and I was forced to walk in front of them. We went into a forest. I had all the time and leisure to contemplate the nature around me. The giant chestnut trees, oaks, and poplars towering above caught to wondrous effect the sun’s rays, which tinged with an almost gloomy hue the plants in the forest, a very carefully chosen theatre for so many misdeeds. Huge masses of foliage, wild grasses, obstructed the deserted paths. It was, in short, quite a sight to behold, and filled my soul with a rush of emotion. At that moment, I felt the conviction of my own impotence. It was a new world meeting my eyes, but an inert world, full of silence, where everything inspired terror. ‘Meanwhile, the brigands were talking and laughing among them-\n\nAn Episode of Brigandage\n\n29\n\nselves. They had big, round, meaty limbs; olive-skinned, calm faces, toughened by the harsh weather; black, gleaming eyes; unkempt hair swaying to-and-fro above their shoulders, their wide foreheads buried beneath very broad-brimmed hats. They wore roomy jackets made of brown frustian, which revealed a glimpse of a black velvet jerkin with big gilded buttons. Their pants were also velvet, held up by a wide red band, from which two pistols hung. They wore leggings. ‘We had reached a path that was so narrow we had to pass one at a time. Two men with brutal, ugly faces stood guard at the entrance. After the who-goes-there, we continued along the path, walking between deep purple rocks and cavernous ravines. The rustling of the dry twigs beneath our feet was the only sound breaking the deathly silence of those parts. Some time later, we entered a dense thicket. One of the brigands opened a door, carefully hidden among the plants. We went down just a few steps into a narrow, tortuous passage. At the end of it there was a large, poorly lit room, equipped with just a few pieces of furniture and paved in stone. We stopped here, and one of the brigands, the leader, untied me. He then put me through a sort of interrogation to find out who I was and where I came from. I answered frankly, in fact, with a certain arrogance. Afterwards, I was taken to a room nearby, lit by a weak light. As I walked across the room, I heard the man who had interrogated me say to the others, “He’ll have to pay a hefty price for his ransom if he doesn’t want to end up like the last ones we’ve had ...” At the sound of those words, I confess, I felt a chill run through my veins. Nonetheless, I didn’t let my face betray a hint of emotion. ‘When we went into the room, my guide exclaimed, “Here’s another prisoner for you.” I turned around to see whom he was talking to, and my eyes fell upon a woman so pretty that a slight expression of surprise escaped me. She was very young. The goodness of an ingenuous, gentle soul, virginal modesty, and maternal love were painted on her snow-white face. Calm and silent, she sat holding a lovely baby boy who did not even wake up with the din of the weapons and rough voices. I was watching that young mother, that smiling victim of love, and her lovely little child, with rosy cheeks and curly hair, when the leader of the brigands came into the room. ‘“Gillo, my Gillo,” said the woman, smiling. “So you’re back?” ‘“Yes, Carmela,” the brigand replied, without a shadow of affection. “As you see, I brought a good catch with me. I’ll leave him for you to watch over while we have something to eat.”\n\n30\n\nCarolina Invernizio\n\n‘Turning to me, he said, “After we’ve finished our meal, you’ll have yours. Meanwhile, we’ll reckon accounts. But first I have to take care of a simple formality ...” He pulled out a long thin rope. ‘“So is it necessary for you to tie me up?” I asked, taking a step back and leaning almost instinctively against the wall of the cave. ‘“Extremely necessary. You might get it into your head to throw some punches. You’re strong and brave.” ‘An ironic smile grazed my lips. ‘“Don’t worry,” I replied. “I won’t move from this spot.” ‘“And what token of faith will you give me so I could trust you?” ‘“My promise.” ‘He said nothing. ‘“I swear!” I repeated adamantly. ‘“Now I’ve nothing left to fear,” Gillo said. He left without even a glance at his wife or a word of affection. ‘Carmela’s eyes followed him anxiously, and she sadly bowed her head. I thought of how deeply the poor woman must suffer, bound forever to the man of crime, forced to share her food with him, and her bed, suffocating her leaping heart, the need to shed tears. ‘I let out a sigh, which gave the woman a start. She passed her right hand over her forehead, pushed her black hair off her face. After taking a long look at me she got up, laid the child down gently on two chairs, opened a cupboard, and then brought out a bottle and a glass. She came close to me and in a quiet, touched voice she said, “Please have some of this strong drink. You must need some. It’s all I can offer you.” ‘She insisted in such a charming manner that I couldn’t refuse. Then there began between us one of those simple conversations that usually take place between a person in need and a benefactor, and reveal an entire life. ‘Carmela loved that man, bound to him by destiny and because he was the father of her innocent little child. But at the same time, she was shocked and horrified at the sight of so many wicked deeds that were committed every day under her very eyes. They wanted her to stay close to the prisoners, and she aimed to be the guardian angel of the hapless. She had foiled the brigands’ tricks, thwarted their plots many times. She had just turned twenty, the age of sweet illusions, hopes, and love, and was living there, buried away in that haven of crime. Her whole life was there now, and her future was there too. And yet, in the midst of that life full of sacrifices and privations, she silenced her own sorrows so that she could hear only those of others.\n\nAn Episode of Brigandage\n\n31\n\n‘Meanwhile, the brigands’ cheers and drunken bursts of laughter could be heard from the nearby room. They were throwing the empty bottles, which made an unimaginable crash when they hit the ground. ‘Carmela went on talking, now and then giving her son a look, a look that by itself revealed all the worry in the mother’s heart. It had been a long time since the poor woman had felt the ineffable consolation of unburdening her tormented soul with someone who could accept her, sympathize with her, and give her compassion. She yielded to the impulses of a simple heart, one needing to emanate affection in words. We were both moved. Within me was pure, affectionate compassion; within her, the release of a flood long held back. ‘A few moments of silence passed, then Carmela said, “Forgive me Signore, if I have been so bold ... but you seem so good. It’s nearly impossible that someone might say a word of affection to me. My husband has no looks to relieve my loneliness, nor my son words. The prisoners they bring here to me are always in such a state of terror that they’re horrified at the things I offer too.” ‘She was silent for a moment, then went on, “You’re brave, Signore, and maybe that will avail to save you. Gillo is not a monster. He has a great soul, even in the midst of crimes. He abhors cowards, the weak ... and he loves and respects the valiant. Don’t lose heart! I’ll do what I can to save you, or at least to ease your captivity.” ‘In the middle of all the confusion and muffled talk that reigned in the room nearby, all of a sudden, we heard a voice yell, “To the lookout!” ‘Gillo came into the room. His face had a brutal look of pride. He said to Carmela, “Our comrades at the look-out point have been attacked ... we’re on our way to help them. But those soldiers, the damned bastards, will pay a dear price for our heads! Don’t move from here! This hideout is safe.” ‘Turning to me, he exclaimed, “Stay put if you don’t want to get acquainted with our blunderbusses!” Then he ran out. ‘We were left alone. Carmela looked up at the heavens. She was thinking of me. “In all this turmoil, you’re free to run,” she said in a trembling voice, “they won’t blame anyone.” ‘“But what about you?” ‘“Don’t worry! He won’t dare touch me. Come with me!” She stopped a moment to gaze at her son, who was still sleeping. She was a mother. That was enough to understand what flood of emotions was suddenly welling in her soul. But recapturing at once a wonderful\n\n32\n\nCarolina Invernizio\n\ncourage, she said, “Let’s go! No one would want to take their rage out on an innocent little child.” ‘Since I was hesitating, she forcefully exclaimed, “I insist!” Then she gently added, “I beg you.” ‘Astonished and touched by her incredible steadfastness, I could only respond by squeezing the hand that had taken mine. Carmela opened a small door, which I had not seen before, and after a few steps down a passageway we were out in the open air. From the opposite direction we heard an exchange of shouts, shots, and curses that startled the courageous woman. In spite of it all, she herself insisted on being my guide through the unknown paths, and lead me down them to the edge of the woods. Then, without a word, she pointed the way to go. ‘“May God bless you,” I said, pressing her hand hard against my lips. “You can be sure that I will never forget you.” ‘Carmela seemed touched. “Pray for me!” she replied with a sad smile. ‘“Will we see each other again?” ‘She turned her eyes to the sky and replied, “Up there, where we are all equal.” ‘Bidding me one last farewell, she hurried away. My eyes followed her. The moon had risen rather high and penetrated the thick foliage. Its rays illuminated the worthy woman, whose steps were watched over by angels in that moment. ‘An hour later I was safe ...’ The End\n\nRecto Running Head\n\n33\n\nThe Blessed Paulists luigi natoli (william galt)\n\nPart I, chapter XI The Monte di Pietà clock had just struck midnight and the city was unusually alive with activity. That morning, October 10th, the thirty British and Genovese war vessels that were carrying Vittorio Amedeo,1 his court, and retinue to the capital of the kingdom had arrived. They landed first at Arenella, where they received the archbishop, and shortly thereafter some noblemen and two members of the Senate. Then towards evening the ships cast anchor in the Molo Grande, and the king expressed his wish to go ashore the next day at about twenty-three hours Italian time. A virtual army of artisans had spent the entire day feverishly attending to decorating the disembarkation bridge at Calla and the four arches in Piazza Villena. They were still busily at it now by the light of torches and candles, trying to finish up the work before daybreak. A coming and going of wagons and carts, the resounding sounds of hammers, yelling, and noisy racket amplified by the night spread through Cassaro and intensified at Quattro Canti, echoing through the entire city and beckoning the curious. The idea of having a king of their own had infused their hands with the enthusiasm of their souls. There was patriotism in the fervour of those artisans, in the very curiosity of the citizens who, instead of going off to get some sleep, were staying at Quattro Canti or Calla to watch the people at work, as if encouraging them with their presence to get things done fast and well. The people who were sleeping that night had a light, sweetly anxious sleep. Those preparations for the solemn entrance and coronation were not the ones that took the most time and work. But they were enough to enliven and animate the city.\n\n34\n\nLuigi Natoli (William Galt)\n\nEveryone’s attention was so drawn to the two city centres with the most work going on, and so many were walking about that even at that unusual hour no one was surprised to run into other people in the streets. Two men cloaked unrecognizably in mantles drawn up around them left the Conceria quarter, crossed Strada Nuova, and slipped into Strada dei Candelai, but only after they had looked all around with the air of people who do not want to be followed. When they thought they had gone far enough so they could not be seen by all the new faces in the beautiful street, they left off walking like people just going about their own business and hastened their steps, like people who fear they will arrive somewhere late. They turned towards Piazza Monte di Pietà and proceeded through Strada delle Lettighe, up to the Chiesa dei ‘Canceddi,’ or, rather, the Church of the Carters, commonly known by the name Santa Maruzza among the locals. There they stopped. One of the two men took his hands out from under his mantle, saying, ‘Be patient. Let me blindfold you.’ The other man did not resist. The first one tied a scarf over his eyes and took him by the hand, adding, ‘Come along. You’ll be safe.’ They went along the side of the church, entered a dark, mysterious alley, and stopped after a few steps. ‘We’re here!’ said the guide. He went up to a small, low door, worm-eaten and gashed, and scratched it lightly with his fingernail, like a cat. After a brief interval, another scratch replied from inside. Then the man made a faint whistle. The door opened without a sound. The guide took the blindfolded man by the hand and pulled him up close in the deep, dark space, saying, ‘Come along. Mind, there’s a step.’ The door closed again behind them. They went through a short passageway. At the end of it, another small door opened in the same mysterious way. They entered a little courtyard, with a crooked tree standing in the middle of it, blackened by the night. The pavement echoed under their steps in the night, as if it were hollow. ‘Careful!’ the man leading warned, ‘Here we go down.’ Indeed, they went down some steps. The blindfolded man felt the air turn damp, and it smelled mouldy. The stairway, in fact, went down a passageway dug out of the tufa, which was incrusted here and there, making the ground slippery. A small oil lamp placed in a little niche carved in the wall shed just enough light for one to guess where\n\nThe Blessed Paulists\n\n35\n\nthe steps were. At the foot of the stairway they stopped. The guide said, ‘Wait here a moment. Someone will come get you.’ He left the blindfolded man in some kind of room, and knocked five times on a door. A voice on the other side whispered some mysterious words, which the guide exchanged. The door opened and he entered a room lit by lanterns attached to the wall. Some voices greeted him. ‘Good evening, Zi’2 Rosario.’ The small shopkeeper’s pockmarked face and lively little eyes appeared in the light of the lanterns. ‘He’s here,’ he said. ‘When you wish, Your Lordship ...’ At the end of the room there was a sort of altar made of stone, with a crucifix standing on it between two burning candles. At the foot of the cross was an open book. In front of the altar there was a small table at which three masked men, dressed in some sort of black robe, were sitting. Another six men, also wearing robes and masks, were sitting in high-backed chairs on each side of the room. Their eyes gleamed sinisterly beneath the masks. Zi’ Rosario went over to the wall, stuck his hands in a niche, and pulled out a bundle. A moment later, dressed in a robe and wearing a mask, he was no more recognizable than the others. Then the man who seemed to preside over the meeting made a sign. One of the six men stood up and left, and then returned almost immediately, leading the blindfolded man by his hand. ‘Let him see the light,’ ordered the leader. The blindfold was removed and Andrea’s astonished, agitated face appeared. The sudden passage from darkness to light prevented him from seeing the room clearly for a minute. Then little by little his eyes became accustomed to the light, and during the moment of silence that reigned in the room, he looked in amazement at the place where he stood, almost unable to bring himself to believe that in the heart of Palermo there could be such caverns, which, not uncommon in the outskirts of the city, the people attributed to the Saracens. The room was dug out of the tufa with a certain artistic criterion. It had a vaulted ceiling, and some niches carved in the walls. Near the altar there were traces of plaster, but the dampness had eaten it away. You could feel that grotto was located in the subsoil. The leader asked him, ‘Is your name Andrea Lo Bianco?’ ‘Yes, Your Lordship.’ ‘There are no Lords here. There are only brothers.’\n\n36\n\nLuigi Natoli (William Galt)\n\n‘I beg your forgiveness.’ ‘Were you the servant of the late Duke of Motta?’ ‘Right up till the day he died at the hands of the Turks ...’ ‘Good. It has come to this venerable society’s knowledge that you can furnish information about the current Duke of Motta ... Mind, solid information and documents are needed. Words alone won’t satisfy us. We are involved in performing a work of justice and vindication, but we haven’t been able to take a step because we ran into a closed door, which you can perhaps open.’ The leader was quiet for a minute, then began speaking again, in a solemn voice full of emotion: ‘Andrea Lo Bianco, you have entered a place where no profane man has ever set foot. But this commits your life perhaps in a way you can’t imagine. Are you certain you will keep your promises? If you aren’t, state so now. Someone will take you away the same way you came, and you will be let free. We trust in your silence. But if you state you are certain, mind you, Andrea Lo Bianco, we will never again allow you to leave, and beside you, behind you, in the street, in church, in your very own home, there will always be the invisible and infallible vindicatory arm of our justice ...’ Andrea replied: ‘I have faith in you. Have faith in me. You are here for justice, and I for vendetta. You saved me, and you are the masters of my life. I put all of my being at your service.’ ‘Good. Brothers, you may begin.’ The six men rose and encircled Andrea. There was a signal, and then all at the same time they pulled out long, sharp daggers from under the black robes covering them, and flashed the tips of the daggers before his eyes. Then two of them quickly grabbed Andrea, stripped his left arm, and carved a small cross on it with the tip of the dagger. The blood blossomed on his naked arm. Then one of the three men sitting at the small table stood up, took the book from the foot of the crucifix, and placed it on the table. He pulled a pen out of a small box and, after dipping it in the blood, handed it to Andrea. ‘Andrea Lo Bianco,’ said the leader, speaking again, ‘this book contains the evangelical gospels and the letters of Saint Apostle Paul. Make the sign of the cross with your blood on this page, and swear to blindly obey whatever you are ordered to do. Swear it on the saint evangelists, on the Saint Apostle Paul, on your blood, which will be spilled drop by drop. Swear that you will keep the secret of what you\n\nThe Blessed Paulists\n\n37\n\nwill hear and see, and that neither torture nor temptations will wring even a sound from your lips. Swear that your body and your soul belong now and forever to this venerable society of the Blessed Paulists, in service of justice, in defence of the weak, against all forms of violence and domination committed by the government, the nobles, and the priests. With a steady hand, Andrea drew a large cross at the foot of the page that the leader showed him, and said, ‘I swear. And may this cross drawn with my blood mark my sentence if I fail to fulfil my obligation.’ ‘May God help you and may the Blessed Apostle Paul arm you with his zeal and give you his sword! Now, answer the questions. Were you in the service of Duke Don Emanuele?’ ‘Yes, Signore.’ ‘Until his death, did you say?’ ‘He died in my arms. But before he died he gave me a medal, so that I would place it around the neck of his sweet little son, whom he never saw. Once I returned to Palermo, after some ups and downs, I carried out the piteous task.’ The comrade sitting to the right of the president asked excitedly, ‘And what about the medal?’ ‘It was a silver medal. It had a relic, a tiny fragment, mounted on one side, and the image of Saint Sebastian, the protector of the ancient Academy of Arms, engraved on the other. It hung on a small, silver chain ...’ ‘Ah! Good!’ exclaimed the Blessed Paulist. ‘Continue,’ said the leader. ‘I intended to watch over the little master, and had found a faithful companion in Maddalena. But I was sent away by Don Raimondo, and Maddalena was killed, maybe poisoned.’ ‘What makes you suppose that?’ ‘Don Raimondo tried to poison the duchess. He went with his trusted servant to get the poison at the home of a witch, who lived in S. Onofrio lane. She was called Peppa la Sarda. I heard what they said, standing behind the door. When they left, I burst into Peppa la Sarda’s house and forced her to give me the antidote. For safety’s sake, I gagged the witch and took her to my house. But all of my efforts were in vain. The duchess was surely murdered, and the son was murdered too. In order to hide the crime, Don Raimondo feigned that assassins\n\n38\n\nLuigi Natoli (William Galt)\n\nhad kidnapped them. He fastened a rope to the parapet of the balcony to simulate the kidnapping. Then he threw suspicions on me. I was arrested and thrown in prison. He’s a murderer, Sirs, a murderer. He killed three innocent people in order to seize a patrimony that he’s not entitled to.’ ‘Who’s the servant?’ ‘I don’t know if he still has him in his service. His name was Giuseppico. He was Majorcan, slender, dark-skinned, surly.’ ‘And what happened to Peppa la Sarda?’ ‘I don’t know. The same night, when I went back home she wasn’t there anymore. How’d she escape? I don’t know. Where did she find a safe place to hide? We need to track her down. She supplied the poison two times, and one night she went to the palace to prepare it herself, and gave it to the mistress, thinking she was Maddalena. Oh, it’s a sad, vile, wicked story! If Don Raimondo had the witch under his power, he would certainly have made her disappear. But if she’s alive, she is a witness, in fact, a terrible accuser. She and Giuseppico. Poor Maddalena could have told a lot more ... but she’s dead, the victim of her devotion to the mistress. So we must track down Peppa la Sarda and Giuseppico. They can’t possibly be dead. Weeds never die. They must be holed up some place. Find them, force them to tell the truth. Then carry out justice. The souls of the victims, of Madam Aloisia, the little Don Emanuele, and Maddalena will bless you and finally have peace.’ Andrea’s eyes were shining, while waves of emotion washed over his face, and hate and love ebbed and flowed in his trembling voice. A soft murmur followed, as if commenting upon his final words. The Blessed Paulist who had addressed the question about the medal to Andrea stood up then and exclaimed with feeling, ‘God is just! God is great! God sent this man to us so that justice may be full and complete. Dominus pupillum suscipiet, et vias peccatorum disperdet.’ Andrea did not understand the Latin words, but he guessed they must have referred to the things he had told them. From the emphasis placed on the words, he gathered that there was something he did not know, but that had to be terrible. The Blessed Paulist who had spoken continued, ‘I have some news that may be of interest, to which, indeed, I draw this venerable court’s attention. The Duke of Motta has welcomed a guest in his home, a young man called Blasco da Castiglione, or at least he is going by that name. This young man was recommended to him by a friar at the friary of the Chiovari, Father Bonaventura da Licodia. He’s a valiant young man, and it seems that the duke\n\nThe Blessed Paulists\n\n39\n\nkeeps him by his side for protection. My information says that he is truly a force to be feared.’ ‘It’s true,’ another man said. ‘He gave a thrashing to those scoundrel police agents. He was lodging at the inn of the Messinese.’ Then the leader said, ‘We need to find out who he is and where he comes from.’ Turning to Andrea, he added, ‘Stay on the ready for your orders, which will be communicated by the brother who led you here. In the meantime, don’t let anyone know who you are, and don’t let anyone see you! The Duke of Motta has unleashed a dog, who immediately started to beat the bushes. You know him. It’s Matteo Lo Vecchio. Be on your guard.’ He made a sign. One of those mysterious men blindfolded Andrea again and lead him out. There he found Zi’ Rosario by his side, who took him by the hand and guided him back along the same way they had come before. When he arrived near Monte di Pietà, he took the blindfold off Andrea. ‘Come on,’ he said, ‘let’s hurry on home.’ They took the same way, without talking. Andrea was overwhelmed by what he had seen, and asked himself what reason that mysterious, terrible court could have for taking an interest in the Duke of Motta’s acts of usurpation. It certainly was not to avenge anyone’s death. So what was it then? And who were those men whom everyone talked about and no one knew, yet who inspired so much terror in the city, often making the magistrate hesitant and timid when he was about to deliver a sentence? The sect that spread terror of its acts of justice in Palermo and also Val di Mazaro in those years had branches reaching far and wide, which were known only to the supreme tribunal that governed it. Those affiliated with the sect did not know how many they numbered. Each of the members only knew the comrade who had mysteriously led him there blindfolded, and saw only masked men in front of him. Then the members were watched by the leaders, without knowing it and without the possibility of being on their guard. That made them silent, cautious, faithful, and ready, even for sacrifice. To the poor, to the weak, the sect presented itself as a formidable protector, and that earned it sympathies and that oblivious, yet deeply powerful, solidarity which made the members feel as if they were never alone, and could count on the help and protection of the common people and the lower middle class. The masters of the State were the nobles and the clergy, because they\n\n40\n\nLuigi Natoli (William Galt)\n\npossessed the wealth. All of the official appointments were in their power; the most delicate offices were awarded only to the nobles, who, naturally, due to caste spirit, helped, supported, and protected each other. Whatever violence they might commit, they were sure of impunity. The most serious sentences were limited to exile or forced residence in some castle belonging to a nobleman or to the royal family, where they were lodged and served with all the comforts, and enjoyed the most complete freedom. But the common people and the lower middle class had only poverty and servitude. The law struck them with the most ferocious punishments that the insane severity of those times placed in its hands, not only to punish real cases of guilt, but also to allow the commission of acts of violence and injustice. The Blessed Paulists appeared to be and were in fact like a moderating force of reaction. They arose to defend and to protect the weak, and to prevent acts of injustice and violence. They were a State within a State, formidable because hidden, terrible because it judged with no appeals, punished with no mercy, struck without fail. And no one knew who its judges and executors of justice were. They seemed to belong to myth more than reality. They were everywhere, they heard everything, they knew everything, but no one knew exactly where they might be, where they gathered. The discharge of their office as guardians and vindicators was revealed by means of warnings, letters that mysteriously arrived. The man they reached knew he had a death sentence hanging over his head. How did they arise? Where? A mystery. They had forefathers – those terrible ‘vindicators,’3 who in the times of Arrigo VI and Federico II were spread over the kingdom. Their leader was a nobleman, Adinolfo di Pontecorvo, their proselytes were in the thousands, and their charge was to vindicate the acts of violence suffered by the weak. But no one ever discovered who the leader of the Blessed Paulists might be, or could ever say if he belonged to this class or another, this caste or another. No trial could ever, in over a quarter of a century, clear up the mystery. Sometimes a man would climb to the gallows, accused of a bloody murder. People said, people thought for sure, that he was a member. But neither torture nor the sight of the gallows could tear the secret out of him. The law cut off a few branches. But the tree remained and sprouted new shoots.\n\nThe Blessed Paulists\n\n41\n\nIn 1713 the sect was in full force. It seemed filled with fervour about what it perceived as the work of justice, and it was as if the city was overcome by it. The viceroy government, the high court, and the tribunal of the Holy Offices had united together, putting aside their usual quarrels over pre-eminence and prerogatives, in order to eradicate the sect, but to no avail. At the point when the boldest detectives thought they were on their tracks, they mysteriously died. This was the secret society that Andrea had run into. This was the tribunal he asked for vendetta. And in his imagination he aggrandized those men through their masks, giving them almost extraordinary appearances. If he had been able to hide and to see the faces of those terrible men who, once he had gone, removed their masks, he would have been astonished by the sight of their plain, common features. The man who was sitting next to the leader and had asked Andrea some questions was Don Girolamo Ammirata. [Translator’s note: With the customary letter that arrives in a cloud of mystery, Blasco da Castiglione has been summoned to a meeting with the Blessed Paulists, after foiling a crucial part of their plan to perform justice. When he refuses to promise not to interfere again, they quite literally lock him in ‘reflection,’ their name for the dank, dark subterranean cell where he is left to think about his position. The secret society’s leader suddenly appears at the door, and the following scene ensues.] Part III, chapter VII The leader of the Blessed Paulists smiled with a sense of commiseration and said, ‘You are young, inexperienced in many things, even though you’ve lived through plentiful experiences of life’s misfortunes. The death of the Duke of Motta is not our wish. Indeed, whether he lives or dies is all the same to us. We want the title and patrimony to be returned to their legitimate owner. If first we did not take back from him what he stole by murder, the day he fell beneath the sword of our justice the entire patrimony would pass legally and by full right to his young daughter, Violante, and would not return to Emanuele. Emanuele would remain the victim of a civil death. He would be nothing other than an anonymous nephew of Don Girolamo Ammirata and the theft, the bloodstained robbery, would be sanctioned by\n\n42\n\nLuigi Natoli (William Galt)\n\nan injustice that would be clad in full legal garb. No, no. We have respected the life of Don Raimondo only so that he himself would recognize Emanuele, and give him back what is his.’ Blasco was thinking about Violante. He could not deny to himself that what the other man wanted was nothing but the most rigorous, exact justice. An orphan has been stripped of everything, and it was necessary to give him back what was his. That was the just, proper thing to do. But Blasco was thinking precisely that this act of restitution meant that another innocent person, Violante, would be stripped of everything and disgraced, which he saw as another injustice. In fact, what fault was it of hers that she was born to that man? What misdeed did she commit to warrant being both deprived of the riches which, from the moment of her birth, she had acquired by right and forced to expiate her father’s disgrace? This idea stirred up a smouldering feeling of rebellion. Yet he did not dare deny the justice of the Blessed Paulists. ‘For the love of justice, we shouldn’t be unjust.’ ‘Toward whom?’ ‘Toward a person bearing no guilt.’ ‘What is a man compared to a right that is violated? What is a human life compared to justice that moves straight along its path? So much the worse for those who put themselves across its path. It must go forward, and will crush those it encounters. An innocent is crying? That person’s tears compensate those of other innocent people who have cried before. Justice must not have mercy. It must not consider the consequences. Too many tears have been shed. A beautiful, rich, young woman was struck by an atrocious grief when her husband was stolen from her, while she brought the fruit of his blood into the world. Ensnared in a fatal trap, driven to desperation, she died o"
