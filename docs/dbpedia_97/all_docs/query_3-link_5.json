        "text": "The Greeks who founded the first colonies in Sicily were not adventure pioneers; They knew the routes of the Tyrrhenian Sea, the ports of the east coast; they had contacts with the interior natives. Archaeological research on the hills around Pergusaâ€™s Lake (the only of inland Sicily) did identify towns. A series of archaeological indicators suggests a developing society; is consolidated the power of warriors, Greek residents or local, connected to the greek element. The chieftain able to hold together a group, due to its ability to guarantee a good booty. Is clear the role of mixed marriages: in these border areas, the greek element is represented by warriors and merchants (not necessarily distinct); women are locals and high-ranking. Greek culture elements were adopted but also adapted, giving rise to a new culture.\n\nThis paper focuses on the origins of the baronial palaces to the south of Rome in the early fourteenth century, looking atexemplary cases which are based on models commissioned by the House of Anjou (see the residences of Charles I of Anjouin Mola di Bari and Villanova di Ostuni, perfectly documented in the registry of the Curia regia) and which found in thepatronage of Roffredo Caetani their diffusion to the northern territories of the Kingdom in the bordering Pontifical region of Marittima."
