        "meta_description": "Abstract. The IPCC AR6 report outlines a general consensus that anthropogenic climate change is modifying the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as cold spells, heat waves, storms or floods. A pertinent question is then whether climate change may have affected the characteristics of a specific extreme event or whether such event would have even been possible in the absence of climate change. Here, we address this question by performing an attribution of some major extreme events that occurred in 2021 over Europe and North America: the Winter Storm Filomena, the French spring cold spell, the Westphalia floods, the Mediterranean summer heat wave, Hurricane Ida, the Po Valley tornado outbreak, Medicane Apollo and the late-autumn Scandinavian cold spell. We focus on the role of the atmospheric circulation associated with the events and its typicality in present (factual world) and past climate conditions (counterfactual world) â defined using the ERA5 dataset 1950 to present. We first identify the most similar sea-level pressure patterns to the extreme events of interest in the factual and counterfactual worlds â so-called analogues. We then compute significant shifts in the spatial characteristics, persistence, predictability, seasonality and other characteristics of these analogues. We also diagnose whether in the present climate the analogues of the studied events lead to warmer/cooler or dryer/wetter conditions than in the past. Finally we verify whether the El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation may explain interdecadal changes in the analogues' characteristics. We find that most of the extreme events we investigate are significantly modified in the present climate with respect to the past, because of changes in the location, persistence and/or seasonality of cyclonic/anticyclonic patterns in the sea-level pressure analogues. One of the events, Medicane Apollo, appears to be a black swan of the atmospheric circulation, with poor-quality analogues. Our approach, complementary to the statistical extreme-event attribution methods in the literature, points to the potentially important role of the atmospheric circulation in attribution studies.",

S. Hisi, Patrick Brockmann, Stavros Dafis, Gianmarco Mengaldo, and Robert Vautard\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 959–983, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-959-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-959-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce ClimaMeter, a tool offering real-time insights into extreme-weather events. Our tool unveils how climate change and natural variability affect these events, affecting communities worldwide. Our research equips policymakers and the public with essential knowledge, fostering informed decisions and enhancing climate resilience. We analysed two distinct events, showcasing ClimaMeter's global relevance.\n\nFuture Changes of Compound Explosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers in the North Atlantic\n\nFerran Lopez-Marti, Mireia Ginesta, Davide Faranda, Anna Rutgersson, Pascal Yiou, Lichuan Wu, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExplosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers are two main drivers of extreme weather in Europe. In this study, we investigate their joint changes in future climates over the North Atlantic. Our results show that both the concurrence of these events and the intensity of atmospheric rivers increase by the end of the century across different future scenarios. Furthermore, explosive cyclones associated with atmospheric rivers are longer-lasting and deeper than those without atmospheric rivers.\n\nAnalysing 23 years of warm-season derechos in France: a climatology and investigation of synoptic and environmental changes\n\nLucas Fery and Davide Faranda\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 439–461, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-439-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-439-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we analyse warm-season derechos – a type of severe convective windstorm – in France between 2000 and 2022, identifying 38 events. We compare their frequency and features with other countries. We also examine changes in the associated large-scale patterns. We find that convective instability has increased in southern Europe. However, the attribution of these changes to natural climate variability, human-induced climate change or a combination of both remains unclear.\n\nThe link between European warm-temperature extremes and atmospheric persistence\n\nEmma Holmberg, Gabriele Messori, Rodrigo Caballero, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 737–765, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-737-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-737-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse the duration of large-scale patterns of air movement in the atmosphere, referred to as persistence, and whether unusually persistent patterns favour warm-temperature extremes in Europe. We see no clear relationship between summertime heatwaves and unusually persistent patterns. This suggests that heatwaves do not necessarily require the continued flow of warm air over a region and that local effects could be important for their occurrence.\n\nStatistical reconstruction of European winter snowfall in reanalysis and climate models based on air temperature and total precipitation\n\nFlavio Maria Emanuele Pons and Davide Faranda\n\nAdv. Stat. Clim. Meteorol. Oceanogr., 8, 155–186, https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-8-155-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-8-155-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective motivating this study is the assessment of the impacts of winter climate extremes, which requires accurate simulation of snowfall. However, climate simulation models contain physical approximations, which result in biases that must be corrected using past data as a reference. We show how to exploit simulated temperature and precipitation to estimate snowfall from already bias-corrected variables, without requiring the elaboration of complex, multivariate bias adjustment techniques.\n\nPresent and future synoptic circulation patterns associated with cold and snowy spells over Italy\n\nMiriam D'Errico, Flavio Pons, Pascal Yiou, Soulivanh Tao, Cesare Nardini, Frank Lunkeit, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 961–992, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-961-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-961-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change is already affecting weather extremes. In a warming climate, we will expect the cold spells to decrease in frequency and intensity. Our analysis shows that the frequency of circulation patterns leading to snowy cold-spell events over Italy will not decrease under business-as-usual emission scenarios, although the associated events may not lead to cold conditions in the warmer scenarios.\n\nHow many modes are needed to predict climate bifurcations? Lessons from an experiment\n\nBÃ©rengÃ¨re Dubrulle, FranÃ§ois Daviaud, Davide Faranda, Louis MariÃ©, and Brice Saint-Michel\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 29, 17–35, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-29-17-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-29-17-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPresent climate models discuss climate change but show no sign of bifurcation in the future. Is this because there is none or because they are in essence too simplified to be able to capture them? To get elements of an answer, we ran a laboratory experiment and discovered that the answer is not so simple.\n\nEnhancing geophysical flow machine learning performance via scale separation\n\nDavide Faranda, Mathieu Vrac, Pascal Yiou, Flavio Maria Emanuele Pons, Adnane Hamid, Giulia Carella, Cedric Ngoungue Langue, Soulivanh Thao, and Valerie Gautard\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 28, 423–443, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-28-423-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-28-423-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMachine learning approaches are spreading rapidly in climate sciences. They are of great help in many practical situations where using the underlying equations is difficult because of the limitation in computational power. Here we use a systematic approach to investigate the limitations of the popular echo state network algorithms used to forecast the long-term behaviour of chaotic systems, such as the weather. Our results show that noise and intermittency greatly affect the performances.\n\nTechnical note: Characterising and comparing different palaeoclimates with dynamical systems theory\n\nGabriele Messori and Davide Faranda\n\nClim. Past, 17, 545–563, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-545-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-545-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe palaeoclimate community must both analyse large amounts of model data and compare very different climates. Here, we present a seemingly very abstract analysis approach that may be fruitfully applied to palaeoclimate numerical simulations. This approach characterises the dynamics of a given climate through a small number of metrics and is thus suited to face the above challenges.\n\nA dynamical systems characterization of atmospheric jet regimes\n\nGabriele Messori, Nili Harnik, Erica Madonna, Orli Lachmy, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 233–251, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-233-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-233-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric jets are a key component of the climate system and of our everyday lives. Indeed, they affect human activities by influencing the weather in many mid-latitude regions. However, we still lack a complete understanding of their dynamical properties. In this study, we try to relate the understanding gained in idealized computer simulations of the jets to our knowledge from observations of the real atmosphere.\n\nImproving snowfall representation in climate simulations via statistical models informed by air temperature and total precipitation\n\nFlavio Maria Emanuele Pons and Davide Faranda\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-352,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-352, 2020\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective motivating this study is the assessment of the impacts of winter climate extremes, which requires accurate simulation of snowfall. However, climate simulation models contain physical approximations, which result in biases that must be corrected using past data as a reference. We show how to exploit simulated temperature and precipitation to estimate snowfall from already bias-corrected variables, without requiring the elaboration of complex, multivariate bias adjustment techniques.\n\nAn attempt to explain recent changes in European snowfall extremes\n\nDavide Faranda\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 1, 445–458, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-445-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-445-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite the global temperature rise caused by anthropogenic emissions, we still observe heavy snowfalls that cause casualties, transport disruptions and energy supply problems. The goal of this paper is to investigate recent trends in snowfalls from reanalysis and observational datasets. The analysis shows an evident discrepancy between trends in average and extreme snowfalls. The latter can only be explained by looking at atmospheric circulation.\n\nCompound warmâdry and coldâwet events over the Mediterranean\n\nPaolo De Luca, Gabriele Messori, Davide Faranda, Philip J. Ward, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 793–805, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we quantify Mediterranean compound temperature and precipitation dynamical extremes (CDEs) over the 1979–2018 period. The strength of the temperature–precipitation coupling during summer increased and is driven by surface warming. We also link the CDEs to compound hot–dry and cold–wet events during summer and winter respectively.\n\nMinimal dynamical systems model of the Northern Hemisphere jet stream via embedding of climate data\n\nDavide Faranda, Yuzuru Sato, Gabriele Messori, Nicholas R. Moloney, and Pascal Yiou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 555–567, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-555-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-555-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show how the complex dynamics of the jet stream at midlatitude can be described by a simple mathematical model. We match the properties of the model to those obtained by the jet data derived from observations.\n\nRelative timing of precipitation and ocean circulation changes in the western equatorial Atlantic over the last 45 kyr\n\nClaire Waelbroeck, Sylvain Pichat, Evelyn BÃ¶hm, Bryan C. Lougheed, Davide Faranda, Mathieu Vrac, Lise Missiaen, Natalia Vazquez Riveiros, Pierre Burckel, JÃ¶rg Lippold, Helge W. Arz, Trond Dokken, FranÃ§ois Thil, and Arnaud Dapoigny\n\nClim. Past, 14, 1315–1330, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-1315-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-1315-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecording the precise timing and sequence of events is essential for understanding rapid climate changes and improving climate model predictive skills. Here, we precisely assess the relative timing between ocean and atmospheric changes, both recorded in the same deep-sea core over the last 45 kyr. We show that decreased mid-depth water mass transport in the western equatorial Atlantic preceded increased rainfall over the adjacent continent by 120 to 980 yr, depending on the type of climate event.\n\nDynamical properties and extremes of Northern Hemisphere climate fields over the past 60 years\n\nDavide Faranda, Gabriele Messori, M. Carmen Alvarez-Castro, and Pascal Yiou\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 24, 713–725, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-713-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-713-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the dynamical properties of the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation by analysing the sea-level pressure, 2 m temperature, and precipitation frequency field over the period 1948–2013. The metrics are linked to the predictability and the persistence of the atmospheric flows. We study the dependence on the seasonal cycle and the fields corresponding to maxima and minima of the dynamical indicators.\n\nA wavelet-based approach to detect climate change on the coherent and turbulent component of the atmospheric circulation\n\nDavide Faranda and Dimitri Defrance\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 517–523, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-517-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-517-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a general technique to detect a climate change signal in the coherent and turbulent components of the atmospheric circulation. Our analysis suggests that the coherent components (atmospheric waves, long-term oscillations) will experience the greatest changes in future climate, proportionally to the greenhouse gas emission scenario considered.\n\nStatistical optimization for passive scalar transport: maximum entropy production versus maximum KolmogorovâSinai entropy\n\nM. Mihelich, D. Faranda, B. Dubrulle, and D. Paillard\n\nNonlin.

R. Pausata, Shivangi Tiwari, M. Carmen Alvarez Castro, and Qiong Zhang\n\nClim. Past, 20, 1735–1759, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1735-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1735-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPalaeoclimate reconstructions suggest that, around 6000 years ago, a greening of the Sahara took place, accompanied by climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere at middle to high latitudes. In this study, a climate model is used to investigate how this drastic environmental change in the Sahara impacted remote regions. Specifically, climate simulations reveal significant modifications in atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic, affecting North American and European climates.\n\nA linear assessment of barotropic Rossby wave propagation in different background flow configurations\n\nAntonio Segalini, Jacopo Riboldi, Volkmar Wirth, and Gabriele Messori\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 997–1012, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-997-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-997-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlanetary Rossby waves are created by topography and evolve in time. In this work, an analytical solution of this classical problem is proposed under the approximation of linear wave dynamics. The theory is able to describe reasonably well the evolution of the perturbation and compares well with full nonlinear simulations. Several relevant cases with single and double zonal jets are assessed with the theoretical framework\n\nDynamics of stratospheric wave reflection over the North Pacific\n\nMichael K. Schutte, Alice Portal, Simon H. Lee, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2240,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2240, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Weather and Climate Dynamics (WCD).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge-scale motions in the atmosphere, namely atmospheric waves, greatly impact the weather that we experience at the Earth's surface. Here we investigate how waves in the troposphere (the lower 10 km of the atmosphere) and the stratosphere (above the troposphere) interact to affect surface weather. We find that tropospheric waves that are reflected back down by the stratosphere change weather patterns and temperatures in North America. These changes can indirectly affect the weather in Europe.\n\nCould an extremely cold central European winter such as 1963 happen again despite climate change?\n\nSebastian Sippel, Clair Barnes, Camille Cadiou, Erich Fischer, Sarah Kew, Marlene Kretschmer, Sjoukje Philip, Theodore G. Shepherd, Jitendra Singh, Robert Vautard, and Pascal Yiou\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 943–957, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-943-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-943-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWinter temperatures in central Europe have increased. But cold winters can still cause problems for energy systems, infrastructure, or human health. Here we tested whether a record-cold winter, such as the one observed in 1963 over central Europe, could still occur despite climate change. The answer is yes: it is possible, but it is very unlikely. Our results rely on climate model simulations and statistical rare event analysis. In conclusion, society must be prepared for such cold winters.\n\nClimaMeter: contextualizing extreme weather in a changing climate\n\nDavide Faranda, Gabriele Messori, Erika Coppola, Tommaso Alberti, Mathieu Vrac, Flavio Pons, Pascal Yiou, Marion Saint Lu, Andreia N.

Our tool unveils how climate change and natural variability affect these events, affecting communities worldwide. Our research equips policymakers and the public with essential knowledge, fostering informed decisions and enhancing climate resilience. We analysed two distinct events, showcasing ClimaMeter's global relevance.\n\nFuture Changes of Compound Explosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers in the North Atlantic\n\nFerran Lopez-Marti, Mireia Ginesta, Davide Faranda, Anna Rutgersson, Pascal Yiou, Lichuan Wu, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExplosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers are two main drivers of extreme weather in Europe. In this study, we investigate their joint changes in future climates over the North Atlantic. Our results show that both the concurrence of these events and the intensity of atmospheric rivers increase by the end of the century across different future scenarios. Furthermore, explosive cyclones associated with atmospheric rivers are longer-lasting and deeper than those without atmospheric rivers.\n\nLarge-scale perspective on extreme near-surface winds in the central North Atlantic\n\nAleksa StankoviÄ, Gabriele Messori, Joaquim G. Pinto, and Rodrigo Caballero\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 821–837, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-821-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-821-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe article studies extreme winds near the surface over the North Atlantic Ocean. These winds are caused by storms that pass through this region. The strongest storms that have occurred in the winters from 1950–2020 are studied in detail and compared to weaker but still strong storms. The analysis shows that the storms associated with the strongest winds are preceded by another older storm that travelled through the same region and made the conditions suitable for development of extreme winds.\n\nThe perfect storm? Co-occurring climate extremes in East Africa\n\nDerrick Muheki, Axel A. J. Deijns, Emanuele Bevacqua, Gabriele Messori, Jakob Zscheischler, and Wim Thiery\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 15, 429–466, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-429-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-429-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change affects the interaction, dependence, and joint occurrence of climate extremes. Here we investigate the joint occurrence of pairs of river floods, droughts, heatwaves, crop failures, wildfires, and tropical cyclones in East Africa under past and future climate conditions. Our results show that, across all future warming scenarios, the frequency and spatial extent of these co-occurring extremes will increase in this region, particularly in areas close to the Nile and Congo rivers.\n\nDo data-driven models beat numerical models in forecasting weather extremes? A comparison of IFS HRES, Pangu-Weather and GraphCast\n\nLeonardo Olivetti and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1042,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1042, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nData-driven models are becoming a viable alternative to physics-based models for weather forecasting up to 15 d into the future. However, it is unclear whether they are as reliable as physics-based models at forecasting weather extremes. Here, we evaluate their performance in forecasting near-surface cold, hot and windy extremes globally. We find that data-driven models can compete with physics-based models, and that the choice of best model mainly depends on region and type of extreme.\n\nAnalysing 23 years of warm-season derechos in France: a climatology and investigation of synoptic and environmental changes\n\nLucas Fery and Davide Faranda\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 439–461, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-439-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-439-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we analyse warm-season derechos – a type of severe convective windstorm – in France between 2000 and 2022, identifying 38 events. We compare their frequency and features with other countries. We also examine changes in the associated large-scale patterns. We find that convective instability has increased in southern Europe. However, the attribution of these changes to natural climate variability, human-induced climate change or a combination of both remains unclear.\n\nAdvances and prospects of deep learning for medium-range extreme weather forecasting\n\nLeonardo Olivetti and Gabriele Messori\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2347–2358, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2347-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2347-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the last decades, weather forecasting up to 15 d into the future has been dominated by physics-based numerical models. Recently, deep learning models have challenged this paradigm. However, the latter models may struggle when forecasting weather extremes. In this article, we argue for deep learning models specifically designed to handle extreme events, and we propose a foundational framework to develop such models.\n\nSimulating record-shattering cold winters of the beginning of the 21st century in France\n\nCamille Cadiou and Pascal Yiou\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-612,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-612, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme winter cold temperatures in Europe have huge societal impacts. This study focuses on very extreme cold events, such as the record of winter 1963 in France, expected to become rarer due to climate change. We use a light and efficient rare event algorithm to simulate a large number of extreme cold winters over France, to analyse their characteristics. We find that despite fewer occurrences, their intensity remains steady. We analyse prevailing atmospheric circulation during these events.\n\nClimatology and Trends in Concurrent Temperature Extremes in the Global Extratropics\n\nGabriele Messori, Antonio Segalini, and Alexandre M. Ramos\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2023-45,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2023-45, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for ESD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimultaneous heatwaves or cold spells in remote geographical regions have potentially far-reaching impacts on society and the environment. Notwithstanding this, we have little knowledge of when and where these extreme events have occurred in the past decades. Here, we present a summary of past simultaneous heatwaves or cold spells, and provide a computer program to enable other researchers to study them.\n\nTipping points in ocean and atmosphere circulations\n\nSina Loriani, Yevgeny Aksenov, David Armstrong McKay, Govindasamy Bala, Andreas Born, Cristiano M. Chiessi, Henk Dijkstra, Jonathan F. Donges, Sybren Drijfhout, Matthew H. England, Alexey V. Fedorov, Laura Jackson, Kai Kornhuber, Gabriele Messori, Francesco Pausata, Stefanie Rynders, Jean-Baptiste SalÃ©e, Bablu Sinha, Steven Sherwood, Didier Swingedouw, and Thejna Tharammal\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2589,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2589, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we draw on paleoreords, observations and modelling studies to review tipping points in the ocean overturning circulations, monsoon systems and global atmospheric circulations. We find indications for tipping in the ocean overturning circulations and the West African monsoon, with potentially severe impacts on the Earth system and humans. Tipping in the other considered systems is considered conceivable but currently not sufficiently supported by evidence.\n\nThe link between European warm-temperature extremes and atmospheric persistence\n\nEmma Holmberg, Gabriele Messori, Rodrigo Caballero, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 737–765, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-737-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-737-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse the duration of large-scale patterns of air movement in the atmosphere, referred to as persistence, and whether unusually persistent patterns favour warm-temperature extremes in Europe. We see no clear relationship between summertime heatwaves and unusually persistent patterns. This suggests that heatwaves do not necessarily require the continued flow of warm air over a region and that local effects could be important for their occurrence.\n\nEnsemble forecast of an index of the MaddenâJulian Oscillation using a stochastic weather generator based on circulation analogs\n\nMeriem Krouma, Riccardo Silini, and Pascal Yiou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 273–290, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-273-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-273-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a simple system to forecast the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). We use atmospheric circulation as input to our system. We found a good-skill forecast of the MJO amplitude within 40 d using this methodology. Comparing our results with ECMWF and machine learning forecasts confirmed the good skill of our system.\n\nEditorial: Global warming is due to an enhanced greenhouse effect, and anthropogenic heat emissions currently play a negligible role at the global scale\n\nAxel Kleidon, Gabriele Messori, Somnath Baidya Roy, Ira Didenkulova, and Ning Zeng\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 241–242, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-241-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-241-2023, 2023\n\nThe global atmospheric energy transport analysed by a wavelength-based scale separation\n\nPatrick Johannes Stoll, Rune Grand Graversen, and Gabriele Messori\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 1–17, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-1-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-1-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe atmosphere is in motion and hereby transporting warm, cold, moist, and dry air to different climate zones. In this study, we investigate how this transport of energy organises in different manners. Outside the tropics, atmospheric waves of sizes between 2000 and 8000 km, which we perceive as cyclones from the surface, transport most of the energy and moisture poleward. In the winter, large-scale weather situations become very important for transporting energy into the polar regions.\n\nCan low-resolution CMIP6 ScenarioMIP models provide insight into future European post-tropical-cyclone risk?\n\nElliott Michael Sainsbury, Reinhard K. H. Schiemann, Kevin I. Hodges, Alexander J. Baker, Len C. Shaffrey, Kieran T. Bhatia, and Stella Bourdin\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 1359–1379, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1359-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1359-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPost-tropical cyclones (PTCs) can bring severe weather to Europe. By tracking and identifying PTCs in five global climate models, we investigate how the frequency and intensity of PTCs may change across Europe by 2100. We find no robust change in the frequency or intensity of Europe-impacting PTCs in the future. This study indicates that large uncertainties surround future Europe-impacting PTCs and provides a framework for evaluating PTCs in future generations of climate models.\n\nStratospheric downward wave reflection events modulate North American weather regimes and cold spells\n\nGabriele Messori, Marlene Kretschmer, Simon H. Lee, and Vivien Wendt\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 1215–1236, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1215-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1215-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOver 10 km above the ground, there is a region of the atmosphere called the stratosphere. While there is very little air in the stratosphere itself, its interactions with the lower parts of the atmosphere – where we live – can affect the weather. Here we study a specific example of such an interaction, whereby processes occurring at the boundary of the stratosphere can lead to a continent-wide drop in temperatures in North America during winter.\n\nMeridional-energy-transport extremes and the general circulation of Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes: dominant weather regimes and preferred zonal wavenumbers\n\nValerio Lembo, Federico Fabiano, Vera Melinda Galfi, Rune Grand Graversen, Valerio Lucariniâââââââ, and Gabriele Messori\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 1037–1062, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1037-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1037-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEddies in mid-latitudes characterize the exchange of heat between the tropics and the poles. This exchange is largely uneven, with a few extreme events bearing most of the heat transported across latitudes in a season. It is thus important to understand what the dynamical mechanisms are behind these events. Here, we identify recurrent weather regime patterns associated with extreme transports, and we identify scales of mid-latitudinal eddies that are mostly responsible for the transport.\n\nIntercomparison of four algorithms for detecting tropical cyclones using ERA5\n\nStella Bourdin, SÃ©bastien Fromang, William Dulac, Julien Cattiaux, and Fabrice Chauvin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 6759–6786, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6759-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6759-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen studying tropical cyclones in a large dataset, one needs objective and automatic procedures to detect their specific pattern. Applying four different such algorithms to a reconstruction of the climate, we show that the choice of the algorithm is crucial to the climatology obtained. Mainly, the algorithms differ in their sensitivity to weak storms so that they provide different frequencies and durations. We review the different options to consider for the choice of the tracking methodology.\n\nStatistical reconstruction of European winter snowfall in reanalysis and climate models based on air temperature and total precipitation\n\nFlavio Maria Emanuele Pons and Davide Faranda\n\nAdv. Stat. Clim. Meteorol. Oceanogr., 8, 155–186, https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-8-155-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-8-155-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective motivating this study is the assessment of the impacts of winter climate extremes, which requires accurate simulation of snowfall. However, climate simulation models contain physical approximations, which result in biases that must be corrected using past data as a reference. We show how to exploit simulated temperature and precipitation to estimate snowfall from already bias-corrected variables, without requiring the elaboration of complex, multivariate bias adjustment techniques.\n\nAssessment of stochastic weather forecast of precipitation near European cities, based on analogs of circulation\n\nMeriem Krouma, Pascal Yiou, CÃ©line DÃ©andreis, and Soulivanh Thao\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 4941–4958, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4941-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4941-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated the skill of a stochastic weather generator (SWG) to forecast precipitation at different time scales and in different areas of western Europe from analogs of Z500 hPa. The SWG has the skill to simulate precipitation for 5 and 10 d. We found that forecast weaknesses can be associated with specific weather patterns. The comparison with ECMWF forecasts confirms the skill of our model. This work is important because it provides information about weather forecasts over specific areas.\n\nPresent and future synoptic circulation patterns associated with cold and snowy spells over Italy\n\nMiriam D'Errico, Flavio Pons, Pascal Yiou, Soulivanh Tao, Cesare Nardini, Frank Lunkeit, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 961–992, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-961-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-961-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change is already affecting weather extremes. In a warming climate, we will expect the cold spells to decrease in frequency and intensity. Our analysis shows that the frequency of circulation patterns leading to snowy cold-spell events over Italy will not decrease under business-as-usual emission scenarios, although the associated events may not lead to cold conditions in the warmer scenarios.\n\nExtreme weather and societal impacts in the eastern Mediterranean\n\nAssaf Hochman, Francesco Marra, Gabriele Messori, Joaquim G. Pinto, Shira Raveh-Rubin, Yizhak Yosef, and Georgios Zittis\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 749–777, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-749-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-749-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGaining a complete understanding of extreme weather, from its physical drivers to its impacts on society, is important in supporting future risk reduction and adaptation measures. Here, we provide a review of the available scientific literature, knowledge gaps and key open questions in the study of extreme weather events over the vulnerable eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nEvaluation of convection-permitting extreme precipitation simulations for the south of France\n\nLinh N. Luu, Robert Vautard, Pascal Yiou, and Jean-Michel Soubeyroux\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 687–702, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-687-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-687-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study downscales climate information from EURO-CORDEX (approx. 12 km) output to a higher horizontal resolution (approx. 3 km) for the south of France. We also propose a matrix of different indices to evaluate the high-resolution precipitation output. We find that a higher resolution reproduces more realistic extreme precipitation events at both daily and sub-daily timescales. Our results and approach are promising to apply to other Mediterranean regions and climate impact studies.\n\nHow many modes are needed to predict climate bifurcations? Lessons from an experiment\n\nBÃ©rengÃ¨re Dubrulle, FranÃ§ois Daviaud, Davide Faranda, Louis MariÃ©, and Brice Saint-Michel\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 29, 17–35, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-29-17-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-29-17-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPresent climate models discuss climate change but show no sign of bifurcation in the future. Is this because there is none or because they are in essence too simplified to be able to capture them? To get elements of an answer, we ran a laboratory experiment and discovered that the answer is not so simple.\n\nModelling forest ruin due to climate hazards\n\nPascal Yiou and Nicolas Viovy\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 997–1013, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-997-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-997-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a model of tree ruin as a response to drought hazards. This model is inspired by a standard model of ruin in the insurance industry. We illustrate how ruin can occur in present-day conditions and the sensitivity of ruin and time to ruin to hazard statistical properties. We also show how tree strategies to cope with hazards can affect their long-term reserves and the probability of ruin.\n\nEnhancing geophysical flow machine learning performance via scale separation\n\nDavide Faranda, Mathieu Vrac, Pascal Yiou, Flavio Maria Emanuele Pons, Adnane Hamid, Giulia Carella, Cedric Ngoungue Langue, Soulivanh Thao, and Valerie Gautard\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 28, 423–443, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-28-423-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-28-423-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMachine learning approaches are spreading rapidly in climate sciences. They are of great help in many practical situations where using the underlying equations is difficult because of the limitation in computational power. Here we use a systematic approach to investigate the limitations of the popular echo state network algorithms used to forecast the long-term behaviour of chaotic systems, such as the weather. Our results show that noise and intermittency greatly affect the performances.\n\nThe remote response of the South Asian Monsoon to reduced dust emissions and Sahara greening during the middle Holocene\n\nFrancesco S. R. Pausata, Gabriele Messori, Jayoung Yun, Chetankumar A. Jalihal, Massimo A. Bollasina, and Thomas M. Marchitto\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1243–1271, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1243-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1243-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFar-afield changes in vegetation such as those that occurred over the Sahara during the middle Holocene and the consequent changes in dust emissions can affect the intensity of the South Asian Monsoon (SAM) rainfall and the lengthening of the monsoon season. This remote influence is mediated by anomalies in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and may have shaped the evolution of the SAM during the termination of the African Humid Period.\n\nTechnical note: Characterising and comparing different palaeoclimates with dynamical systems theory\n\nGabriele Messori and Davide Faranda\n\nClim. Past, 17, 545–563, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-545-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-545-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe palaeoclimate community must both analyse large amounts of model data and compare very different climates. Here, we present a seemingly very abstract analysis approach that may be fruitfully applied to palaeoclimate numerical simulations. This approach characterises the dynamics of a given climate through a small number of metrics and is thus suited to face the above challenges.\n\nA dynamical systems characterization of atmospheric jet regimes\n\nGabriele Messori, Nili Harnik, Erica Madonna, Orli Lachmy, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 233–251, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-233-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-233-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric jets are a key component of the climate system and of our everyday lives. Indeed, they affect human activities by influencing the weather in many mid-latitude regions. However, we still lack a complete understanding of their dynamical properties. In this study, we try to relate the understanding gained in idealized computer simulations of the jets to our knowledge from observations of the real atmosphere.\n\nA new view of heat wave dynamics and predictability over the eastern Mediterranean\n\nAssaf Hochman, Sebastian Scher, Julian Quinting, Joaquim G. Pinto, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 133–149, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-133-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-133-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSkillful forecasts of extreme weather events have a major socioeconomic relevance. Here, we compare two approaches to diagnose the predictability of eastern Mediterranean heat waves: one based on recent developments in dynamical systems theory and one leveraging numerical ensemble weather forecasts. We conclude that the former can be a useful and cost-efficient complement to conventional numerical forecasts for understanding the dynamics of eastern Mediterranean heat waves.\n\nSimulating compound weather extremes responsible for critical crop failure with stochastic weather generators\n\nPeter Pfleiderer, AglaÃ© JÃ©zÃ©quel, Juliette Legrand, Natacha Legrix, Iason Markantonis, Edoardo Vignotto, and Pascal Yiou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 103–120, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-103-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-103-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2016, northern France experienced an unprecedented wheat crop loss. This crop loss was likely due to an extremely warm December 2015 and abnormally high precipitation during the following spring season. Using stochastic weather generators we investigate how severe the metrological conditions leading to the crop loss could be in current climate conditions. We find that December temperatures were close to the plausible maximum but that considerably wetter springs would be possible.\n\nImproving snowfall representation in climate simulations via statistical models informed by air temperature and total precipitation\n\nFlavio Maria Emanuele Pons and Davide Faranda\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-352,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-352, 2020\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective motivating this study is the assessment of the impacts of winter climate extremes, which requires accurate simulation of snowfall. However, climate simulation models contain physical approximations, which result in biases that must be corrected using past data as a reference. We show how to exploit simulated temperature and precipitation to estimate snowfall from already bias-corrected variables, without requiring the elaboration of complex, multivariate bias adjustment techniques.\n\nAn attempt to explain recent changes in European snowfall extremes\n\nDavide Faranda\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 1, 445–458, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-445-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-445-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite the global temperature rise caused by anthropogenic emissions, we still observe heavy snowfalls that cause casualties, transport disruptions and energy supply problems. The goal of this paper is to investigate recent trends in snowfalls from reanalysis and observational datasets. The analysis shows an evident discrepancy between trends in average and extreme snowfalls. The latter can only be explained by looking at atmospheric circulation.\n\nCompound warmâdry and coldâwet events over the Mediterranean\n\nPaolo De Luca, Gabriele Messori, Davide Faranda, Philip J. Ward, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 793–805, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we quantify Mediterranean compound temperature and precipitation dynamical extremes (CDEs) over the 1979–2018 period. The strength of the temperature–precipitation coupling during summer increased and is driven by surface warming. We also link the CDEs to compound hot–dry and cold–wet events during summer and winter respectively.\n\nSeasonal weather regimes in the North Atlantic region: towards new seasonality?\n\nFlorentin Breton, Mathieu Vrac, Pascal Yiou, Pradeebane Vaittinada Ayar, and AglaÃ© JÃ©zÃ©quel\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2020-26,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2020-26, 2020\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate North Atlantic weather seasonality over 1979–2100 by classifying year-round fields of 500 hPa geopotential height from one reanalysis dataset and 12 climate models. Generally, models have seasonal structures similar to the reanalyses. Historical winter (summer) conditions decrease (increase), due to uniform Z500 increase (i.e. uniform warming). However, relative to the increasing Z500 seasonal cycle, future seasonality (spatial patterns, seasonal cycle) appears almost stationary.\n\nConcurrent wet and dry hydrological extremes at the global scale\n\nPaolo De Luca, Gabriele Messori, Robert L. Wilby, Maurizio Mazzoleni, and Giuliano Di Baldassarre\n\nEarth Syst.

We then link wet–dry extremes to major modes of climate variability (i.e. ENSO, PDO, and AMO) and provide their spatial patterns. Such concurrent extreme hydrological events may pose risks to regional hydropower production and agricultural yields.\n\nSimulation of extreme heat waves with empirical importance sampling\n\nPascal Yiou and AglaÃ© JÃ©zÃ©quel\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 763–781, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-763-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-763-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents an adaptation of a method of \"importance sampling\" to simulate large ensembles of extreme heat waves (i.e., the most extreme heat waves that could be), given a fixed returned period. We illustrate how this algorithm works for European heat waves and investigate the atmospheric features of such ensembles of events. We argue that such an algorithm can be used to simulate other types of events, including cold spells or prolonged episodes of precipitation.\n\nStatistical downscaling of water vapour satellite measurements from profiles of tropical ice clouds\n\nGiulia Carella, Mathieu Vrac, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Brogniez, Pascal Yiou, and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Chepfer\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 12, 1–20, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-1-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-1-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nObservations of relative humidity for ice clouds over the tropical oceans from a passive microwave sounder are downscaled by incorporating the high-resolution variability derived from simultaneous co-located cloud profiles from a lidar. By providing a method to generate pseudo-observations of relative humidity at high spatial resolution, this work will help revisit some of the current key barriers in atmospheric science.\n\nGeneralization properties of feed-forward neural networks trained on Lorenz systems\n\nSebastian Scher and Gabriele Messori\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 26, 381–399, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-381-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-381-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNeural networks are a technique that is widely used to predict the time evolution of physical systems. For this the past evolution of the system is shown to the neural network – it is trained – and then can be used to predict the evolution in the future. We show some limitations in this approach for certain systems that are important to consider when using neural networks for climate- and weather-related applications.\n\nMinimal dynamical systems model of the Northern Hemisphere jet stream via embedding of climate data\n\nDavide Faranda, Yuzuru Sato, Gabriele Messori, Nicholas R. Moloney, and Pascal Yiou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 555–567, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-555-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-555-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show how the complex dynamics of the jet stream at midlatitude can be described by a simple mathematical model. We match the properties of the model to those obtained by the jet data derived from observations.\n\nWeather and climate forecasting with neural networks: using general circulation models (GCMs) with different complexity as a study ground\n\nSebastian Scher and Gabriele Messori\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 2797–2809, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2797-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2797-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCurrently, weather forecasts are mainly produced by using computer models based on physical equations. It is an appealing idea to use neural networks and âdeep learningâ for weather forecasting instead. We successfully test the possibility of using deep learning for weather forecasting by considering climate models as simplified versions of reality. Our work therefore is a step towards potentially using deep learning to replace or accompany current weather forecasting models.\n\nHuman influence on European winter wind storms such as those of January 2018\n\nRobert Vautard, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Friederike E. L. Otto, Pascal Yiou, Hylke de Vries, Erik van Meijgaard, Andrew Stepek, Jean-Michel Soubeyroux, Sjoukje Philip, Sarah F. Kew, Cecilia Costella, Roop Singh, and Claudia Tebaldi\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 271–286, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-271-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-271-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of human activities on the probability of winter wind storms like the ones that occurred in Western Europe in January 2018 is analysed using multiple model ensembles. Despite a significant probability decline in observations, we find no significant change in probabilities due to human influence on climate so far. However, such extreme events are likely to be slightly more frequent in the future. The observed decrease in storminess is likely to be due to increasing roughness.\n\nStochastic ensemble climate forecast with an analogue model\n\nPascal Yiou and CÃ©line DÃ©andrÃ©is\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 723–734, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-723-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-723-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe devised a system that simulates large ensembles of forecasts for European temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation index. This system is based on a stochastic weather generator that samples analogs of SLP. This paper provides statistical tests of temperature and NAO forecasts for timescales of days to months. We argue that the forecast skill of the system is significantly positive and could be used as a baseline for numerical weather forecast.\n\nMultivariate stochastic bias corrections with optimal transport\n\nYoann Robin, Mathieu Vrac, Philippe Naveau, and Pascal Yiou\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 773–786, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-773-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-773-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBias correction methods are used to calibrate climate model outputs with respect to observations. In this article, a non-stationary, multivariate and stochastic bias correction method is developed based on optimal transport, accounting for inter-site and inter-variable correlations. Optimal transport allows us to construct a joint distribution that minimizes energy spent in bias correction. Our methodology is tested on precipitation and temperatures over 12 locations in southern France.\n\nRelative timing of precipitation and ocean circulation changes in the western equatorial Atlantic over the last 45 kyr\n\nClaire Waelbroeck, Sylvain Pichat, Evelyn BÃ¶hm, Bryan C. Lougheed, Davide Faranda, Mathieu Vrac, Lise Missiaen, Natalia Vazquez Riveiros, Pierre Burckel, JÃ¶rg Lippold, Helge W. Arz, Trond Dokken, FranÃ§ois Thil, and Arnaud Dapoigny\n\nClim. Past, 14, 1315–1330, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-1315-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-1315-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecording the precise timing and sequence of events is essential for understanding rapid climate changes and improving climate model predictive skills. Here, we precisely assess the relative timing between ocean and atmospheric changes, both recorded in the same deep-sea core over the last 45 kyr. We show that decreased mid-depth water mass transport in the western equatorial Atlantic preceded increased rainfall over the adjacent continent by 120 to 980 yr, depending on the type of climate event.\n\nDynamical properties and extremes of Northern Hemisphere climate fields over the past 60 years\n\nDavide Faranda, Gabriele Messori, M. Carmen Alvarez-Castro, and Pascal Yiou\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 24, 713–725, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-713-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-713-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the dynamical properties of the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation by analysing the sea-level pressure, 2 m temperature, and precipitation frequency field over the period 1948–2013. The metrics are linked to the predictability and the persistence of the atmospheric flows. We study the dependence on the seasonal cycle and the fields corresponding to maxima and minima of the dynamical indicators.\n\nDetecting changes in forced climate attractors with Wasserstein distance\n\nYoann Robin, Pascal Yiou, and Philippe Naveau\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 24, 393–405, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-393-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-393-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIf climate is viewed as a chaotic dynamical system, its trajectories yield on an object called an attractor. Being perturbed by an external forcing, this attractor could be modified. With Wasserstein distance, we estimate on a derived Lorenz model the impact of a forcing similar to climate change. Our approach appears to work with small data sizes. We have obtained a methodology quantifying the deformation of well-known attractors, coherent with the size of data available.\n\nA statistical framework for conditional extreme event attribution\n\nPascal Yiou, AglaÃ© JÃ©zÃ©quel, Philippe Naveau, Frederike E. L. Otto, Robert Vautard, and Mathieu Vrac\n\nAdv. Stat. Clim. Meteorol. Oceanogr., 3, 17–31, https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-3-17-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-3-17-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe attribution of classes of extreme events, such as heavy precipitation or heatwaves, relies on the estimate of small probabilities (with and without climate change). Such events are connected to the large-scale atmospheric circulation. This paper links such probabilities with properties of the atmospheric circulation by using a Bayesian decomposition. We test this decomposition on a case of extreme precipitation in the UK, in January 2014.\n\nA wavelet-based approach to detect climate change on the coherent and turbulent component of the atmospheric circulation\n\nDavide Faranda and Dimitri Defrance\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 517–523, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-517-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-517-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a general technique to detect a climate change signal in the coherent and turbulent components of the atmospheric circulation. Our analysis suggests that the coherent components (atmospheric waves, long-term oscillations) will experience the greatest changes in future climate, proportionally to the greenhouse gas emission scenario considered.\n\nStatistical optimization for passive scalar transport: maximum entropy production versus maximum KolmogorovâSinai entropy\n\nM.

This modification of the atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Atlantic sector leads to more stagnant weather conditions that favour air pollutant accumulation especially in the western Mediterranean sector. Changes in atmospheric circulation should therefore be included in future air pollution mitigation assessments.\n\nThree variables are better than one: detection of european winter windstorms causing important damages\n\nM.-S.

Shepherd, Jitendra Singh, Robert Vautard, and Pascal Yiou\n\nWeather Clim.

But cold winters can still cause problems for energy systems, infrastructure, or human health. Here we tested whether a record-cold winter, such as the one observed in 1963 over central Europe, could still occur despite climate change. The answer is yes: it is possible, but it is very unlikely. Our results rely on climate model simulations and statistical rare event analysis. In conclusion, society must be prepared for such cold winters.\n\nImpact of climate change on persistent cold-air pools in an alpine valley during the 21stÂ century\n\nSara Bacer, Julien Beaumet, Martin MÃ©nÃ©goz, Hubert GallÃ©e, Enzo Le BouÃ«dec, and Chantal Staquet\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 211–229, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-211-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-211-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA model chain is used to downscale outputs from a climate model to the Grenoble valley atmosphere over the 21st century in order to study the impact of climate change on persistent cold-air pool episodes. We find that the atmosphere in the Grenoble valleys during these episodes tends to be slightly less stable in the future under the SSP5–8.5 scenario, and statistically unchanged under the SSP2–4.5 scenario but that very stable persistent cold-air pool episodes can still form.\n\nFuture changes in North Atlantic winter cyclones in CESM-LE â Part 2: A Lagrangian analysis\n\nEdgar Dolores-Tesillos and Stephan Pfahl\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 163–179, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-163-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-163-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn a warmer climate, the winter extratropical cyclones over the North Atlantic basin are expected to have a larger footprint of strong winds. Dynamical changes at different altitudes are responsible for these wind changes. Based on backward trajectories using the CESM-LE simulations, we show that the diabatic processes gain relevance as the planet warms. For instance, changes in the radiative processes will play an important role in the upper-level cyclone dynamics.\n\nAtmospheric bias teleconnections in boreal winter associated with systematic sea surface temperature errors in the tropical Indian Ocean\n\nYuan-Bing Zhao, Nedjeljka Å½agar, Frank Lunkeit, and Richard Blender\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 833–852, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-833-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-833-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoupled climate models have significant biases in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) sea surface temperature (SST). Our study shows that the TIO SST biases can affect the simulated global atmospheric circulation and its spatio-temporal variability on large scales. The response of the spatial variability is related to the amplitude or phase of the circulation bias, depending on the flow regime and spatial scale, while the response of the interannual variability depends on the sign of the SST bias.\n\nThe relationship between extra-tropical cyclone intensity and precipitation in idealised current and future climates\n\nVictoria A. Sinclair and Jennifer L. Catto\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 567–589, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-567-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-567-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the relationship between the strength of mid-latitude cyclones and their precipitation, how this may change in the future, and whether it depends of the type of cyclone. The relationship between cyclone strength and precipitation increases in warmer climates and depends strongly on the type of cyclone. For some cyclone types there is no relation between cyclone strength and precipitation. For all cyclone types, precipitation increases with uniform warming and polar amplification.\n\nFuture changes in the mean and variability of extreme rainfall indices over the Guinea coast and role of the Atlantic equatorial mode\n\nKoffi Worou, Thierry Fichefet, and Hugues Goosse\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 511–530, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-511-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-511-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Atlantic equatorial mode (AEM) of variability is partly responsible for the year-to-year rainfall variability over the Guinea coast. We used the current climate models to explore the present-day and future links between the AEM and the extreme rainfall indices over the Guinea coast. Under future global warming, the total variability of the extreme rainfall indices increases over the Guinea coast. However, the future impact of the AEM on extreme rainfall events decreases over the region.\n\nWarm conveyor belts in present-day and future climate simulations â PartÂ 1: Climatology and impacts\n\nHanna Joos, Michael Sprenger, Hanin Binder, Urs Beyerle, and Heini Wernli\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 133–155, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-133-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-133-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWarm conveyor belts (WCBs) are strongly ascending, cloud- and precipitation-forming airstreams in extratropical cyclones. In this study we assess their representation in a climate simulation and their changes under global warming. They become moister, become more intense, and reach higher altitudes in a future climate, implying that they potentially have an increased impact on the mid-latitude flow.\n\nWarm conveyor belts in present-day and future climate simulations â Part 2: Role of potential vorticity production for cyclone intensification\n\nHanin Binder, Hanna Joos, Michael Sprenger, and Heini Wernli\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 19–37, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-19-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-19-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWarm conveyor belts (WCBs) are the main cloud- and precipitation-producing airstreams in extratropical cyclones. The latent heat release that occurs during cloud formation often contributes to the intensification of the associated cyclone. Based on the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble coupled climate simulations, we show that WCBs and associated latent heating will become stronger in a future climate and be even more important for explosive cyclone intensification than in the present.\n\nThe response of tropical cyclone intensity to changes in environmental temperature\n\nJames M. Done, Gary M. Lackmann, and Andreas F. Prein\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 693–711, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-693-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-693-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe know that warm oceans generally favour tropical cyclones (TCs). Less is known about the role of air temperature above the oceans extending into the lower stratosphere. Our global analysis of historical records and computer simulations suggests that TCs strengthen in response to historical temperature change while also being influenced by other environmental factors. Ocean warming drives much of the strengthening, with relatively small contributions from temperature changes aloft.\n\nRelationship between southern hemispheric jet variability and forced response: the role of the stratosphere\n\nPhilipp Breul, Paulo Ceppi, and Theodore G. Shepherd\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 645–658, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-645-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-645-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding how the mid-latitude jet stream will respond to a changing climate is highly important. Unfortunately, climate models predict a wide variety of possible responses. Theoretical frameworks can link an internal jet variability timescale to its response. However, we show that stratospheric influence approximately doubles the internal timescale, inflating predicted responses. We demonstrate an approach to account for the stratospheric influence and recover correct response predictions.\n\nStorm track response to uniform global warming downstream of an idealized sea surface temperature front\n\nSebastian Schemm, Lukas Papritz, and Gwendal RiviÃ¨re\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 601–623, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-601-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-601-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMuch of the change in our daily weather patterns is due to the development and intensification of extratropical cyclones. The response of these systems to climate change is an important topic of ongoing research. This study is the first to reproduce the changes in the North Atlantic circulation and extratropical cyclone characteristics found in fully coupled Earth system models under high-CO2 scenarios, but in an idealized, reduced-complexity simulation with uniform warming.\n\nFuture changes in North Atlantic winter cyclones in CESM-LE â Part 1: Cyclone intensity, potential vorticity anomalies, and horizontal wind speed\n\nEdgar Dolores-Tesillos, Franziska Teubler, and Stephan Pfahl\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 429–448, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-429-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-429-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStrong winds caused by extratropical cyclones represent a costly hazard for European countries. Here, based on CESM-LENS coupled climate simulations, we show that future changes of such strong winds are characterized by an increased magnitude and extended footprint southeast of the cyclone center. This intensification is related to a combination of increased diabatic heating and changes in upper-level wave dynamics.\n\nImpact of climate change on wintertime European atmospheric blocking\n\nSara Bacer, Fatima Jomaa, Julien Beaumet, Hubert GallÃ©e, Enzo Le BouÃ«dec, Martin MÃ©nÃ©goz, and Chantal Staquet\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 377–389, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-377-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-377-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the impact of climate change on wintertime atmospheric blocking over Europe. We focus on the frequency, duration, and size of blocking events. The blocking events are identified via the weather type decomposition methodology. We find that blocking frequency, duration, and size are mostly stationary over the 21st century. Additionally, we compare the blocking size results with the size of the blocking events identified via a different approach using a blocking index.\n\nTwenty-first-century Southern Hemisphere impacts of ozone recovery and climate change from the stratosphere to the ocean\n\nIoana Ivanciu, Katja Matthes, Arne Biastoch, Sebastian Wahl, and Jan HarlaÃ\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 139–171, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-139-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-139-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGreenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, while the Antarctic ozone hole is expected to recover during the twenty-first century. We separate the effects of ozone recovery and of greenhouse gases on the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and we find that ozone recovery is generally reducing the impact of greenhouse gases, with the exception of certain regions of the stratosphere during spring, where the two effects reinforce each other.\n\nFuture summer warming pattern under climate change is affected by lapse-rate changes\n\nRoman Brogli, Silje Lund SÃ¸rland, Nico KrÃ¶ner, and Christoph SchÃ¤r\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 2, 1093–1110, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-1093-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-1093-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn a warmer future climate, climate simulations predict that some land areas will experience excessive warming during summer. We show that the excessive summer warming is related to the vertical distribution of warming within the atmosphere. In regions characterized by excessive warming, much of the warming occurs close to the surface. In other regions, most of the warming is redistributed to higher levels in the atmosphere, which weakens the surface warming.\n\nThe importance of horizontal model resolution on simulated precipitation in Europe â from global to regional models\n\nGustav Strandberg and Petter Lind\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 2, 181–204, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-181-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-181-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation is a key climate variable with a large impact on society but also difficult to simulate as it depends largely on temporal and spatial scales. We look here at the effect of model resolution on precipitation in Europe, from coarse-scale global model to small-scale regional models. Higher resolution improves simulated precipitation generally, but individual models may over- or underestimate precipitation even at higher resolution.\n\nFuture wintertime meridional wind trends through the lens of subseasonal teleconnections\n\nDor Sandler and Nili Harnik\n\nWeather Clim.

It is also linked to various extreme weather events. The CTP is predicted to play a prominent role in future climate. We find that for future projections, most CMIP5 models predict that the CTP will develop a preferred phase. Our work establishes that the CTP-like climate change signature is in fact comprised of several regional effects, partly due to shifts in CTP phase distributions.\n\nDecomposing the response of the stratospheric BrewerâDobson circulation to an abrupt quadrupling in CO2\n\nAndreas Chrysanthou, Amanda C. Maycock, and Martyn P. Chipperfield\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 1, 155–174, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-155-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-155-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe perform 50-year-long time-slice experiments using the Met Office HadGEM3 global climate model in order to decompose the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) response to an abrupt quadrupling of CO2 in three distinct components, (a) the rapid adjustment, associated with CO2 radiative effects; (b) a global uniform sea surface temperature warming; and (c) sea surface temperature patterns. This demonstrates a potential for fast and slow timescales of the response of the BDC to greenhouse gas forcing.\n\nThe substructure of extremely hot summers in the Northern Hemisphere\n\nMatthias RÃ¶thlisberger, Michael Sprenger, Emmanouil Flaounas, Urs Beyerle, and Heini Wernli\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 1, 45–62, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-45-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-45-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we quantify how much the coldest, middle and hottest third of all days during extremely hot summers contribute to their respective seasonal mean anomaly. This extreme-summer substructure varies substantially across the Northern Hemisphere and is directly related to the local physical drivers of extreme summers. Furthermore, comparing re-analysis (i.e. measurement-based) and climate model extreme-summer substructures reveals a remarkable level of agreement.\n\nCited articles\n\nAEMET: La ola de calor del puente de agosto'21 y los rÃ©cords de temperaturas en EspaÃ±a, Spanish State Meteorological Agency, https://aemetblog.es/2021/08/18/la-ola-de-calor-del-puente-de-agosto21-y-los-records-de-temperaturas-en-espana/ (last access: 27Â January 2022), 2021a.âa\n\nAEMET: Informe sobre la borrasca Filomena y la ola de frio, Spanish State Meteorological Agency, http://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/conocermas/recursos_en_linea/publicaciones_y_estudios/estudios/Informe_episodio_filomena.pdf (last access: 21Â October 2022), 2021b.âa, b\n\nAEMET: Noviembre de 2021, un mes muy frÃ­o, Spanish State Meteorological Agency https://www.aemet.es/es/noticias/2021/12/resumen_clima_noviembre_2021, last access: 14Â January 2022.âa\n\nAlberoni, P., Nanni, S., Crespi, M., and Monai, M.: The supercell thunderstorm on 8Â June 1990: mesoscale analysis and radar observations, Meteorol.
