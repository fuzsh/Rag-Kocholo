        "text": "Due to its strategic position in the Mediterranean Sea, Sicily was a place of multiple cultural contaminations and commercial exchanges throughout the early modern era. Trade, piracy, and even slavery implemented continuous contacts between populations from opposing shores, regardless of their different religious beliefs. Yet, the island was also intended as a Christian bulwark against the Islamic world and its institutions fostered anti-Muslim prejudices. To date, this discrepancy has been little investigated, but the responsibilities of art in fueling discriminatory attitudes have been explored even less. Drawing on Francisco Bethencourt’s idea that racism is motivated by political projects, this paper illustrates the complicity of art in reinforcing prejudices for political interests. To do so, it explores the 1725 frescoes by the Flemish painter Guglielmo Borremans (1670–1744) in the church of the Forty Martyrs and Saint Ranieri of the Pisan Nation, in Palermo. In the face of persistent multiculturalism in the daily life of the population, these frescoes affirmed the supremacy of Pisa as a victorious guardian of Christianity in the Mediterranean. In this way, they celebrated the urban nobility of Pisan descent, while disguising the problematic identity of its enemy.\n\nThis article focuses on the idea of domestic education in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italy. Drawing on the cross-reading of a selection of two different sets of printed sources – pedagogical tracts, and art tracts which largely intersected with Catholic aims of religious reform and the creation of a confessional state and society – the article discusses the educational value that was attributed to the home environment, in its private, public and political dimensions, and the relevance which was attached to domestic visual and material culture and to the senses as learning tools to be used by children of different gender, age and class. Debates about education uncover less-known aspects of domesticity while suggesting the possibility to explore the continuities that might have existed between pre-modern notions of education and modern ones.\n\nThe Tornabuoni Palace, built in the 1460s by Giovanni Tornabuoni, a brother-in-law of Piero de' Medici, is familiar to many because of the reference to it by Vasari and because an inventory made in 1498 lists many works of art, including two well-known paintings by Ghirlandaio; several extant spalliera paintings are thought also to have been in the palace. However, nothing but the courtyard and one room remain today of the original building, and thus scholars have known very little about its configuration and layout. Just before the remodeling of 1864, detailed survey drawings were made, and in the article they are used, in conjunction with study of the components of the site and consultation of the inventory, to reconstruct the plans of the ground floor and primo piano in the fifteenth century. The surprising results show a palace 'in progress': the palace as reconstructed already had significant similarities to the Medici Palace, and Giovanni Tornabuoni owned almost all the surrounding property necessary to expand it, but he did not pursue the project. In the article the spaces listed in the inventory are identified on the plans, and comments are made about the functions of the various rooms. While for the most part the interior follows common practice in Florence, some unusual aspects of the upstairs living quarters perhaps can be linked to the fact that in the palace many important visitors to Florence were housed at the expense of the commune."
