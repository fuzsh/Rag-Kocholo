        "text": "Linaclotide: a novel therapy for chronic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nLacy, Brian E; Levenick, John M; Crowell, Michael D\n\n2012-10-01\n\nChronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are functional gastrointestinal disorders that significantly affect patients' quality of life. Chronic constipation and IBS are prevalent-1 2% of the US population meet the diagnostic criteria for IBS, and 1 5% meet the criteria for chronic constipation- and these conditions negatively impact the healthcare system from an economic perspective. Despite attempts at dietary modification, exercise, or use of over-the-counter medications, many patients have persistent symptoms. Alternative treatment options are limited. This article describes linaclotide (Linzess, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals/Forest Pharmaceuticals), a new, first-in-class medication for the treatment of chronic constipation and constipation-predominant IBS.\n\nLubiprostone: in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarter, Natalie J; Scott, Lesley J\n\n2009-06-18\n\nLubiprostone is an oral bicyclic fatty acid that selectively activates type 2 chloride channels in the apical membrane of human gastrointestinal epithelial cells, thereby increasing chloride-rich fluid secretion. Although the mechanism is unclear, this may then decrease intestinal transit time, allowing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms of constipation. Oral lubiprostone was effective in the treatment of patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) in large (n = 193-583) phase II (dose-finding) and phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials. The number of patients with IBS-C demonstrating an overall response to treatment (primary endpoint) in the two phase III trials was significantly greater in patients receiving lubiprostone 8 microg twice daily for 3 months than in those receiving placebo. In addition, a randomized, 4-week withdrawal period at the end of one of the phase III trials demonstrated that discontinuation of lubiprostone was not associated with rebound of IBS symptoms. Lubiprostone was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with the majority of adverse events being of mild to moderate severity. In patients with IBS-C who received lubiprostone 8 microg twice daily, nausea was the most frequently occurring adverse event that was considered possibly or probably treatment related. No serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in a 36-week open-label extension to the phase III trials.\n\nLubiprostone for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTuteja, Ashok K; Rao, Satish S C\n\n2008-12-01\n\nChronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome are heterogeneous disorders characterized by altered bowel habits, abdominal discomfort and/or difficult defecation. These conditions have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as on the US economy, both in terms of healthcare costs and lost productivity. Treatment typically begins with lifestyle changes, increased fiber intake and osmotic and stimulant laxative intake. However, treatments for constipation vary in terms of their efficacy and safety. Furthermore, surveys of physicians and patients have revealed a strong desire for improved therapeutic options. Lubiprostone is a synthetic bicyclic fatty acid that is gut selective and stimulates type 2 chloride channels, resulting in increased chloride, sodium and water secretion into the lumen. The increased fluid secretion causes luminal distension, secondary peristalsis and laxation. Randomized Phase III trials have shown that lubiprostone is efficacious in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The US FDA has approved lubiprostone at a dose of 24 microg twice daily for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, and at a dose of 8 microg twice daily for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adult women. Nausea, diarrhea and headaches are the most commonly reported side effects. In long-term studies, lubiprostone appears to be safe.\n\nFunctional Constipation and Constipation-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in the General Population: Data from the GECCO Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEnck, Paul; Leinert, Johannes; Smid, Menno; KÃ¶hler, Thorsten; Schwille-Kiuntke, Juliane\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground. The prevalence of constipation in the (German) population has been shown to be 14.9% in a telephone survey, but more detailed data are required to characterize the sociographics and clinical characteristics of persons with different types of functional constipation, either constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) or functional constipation with or without meeting Rome criteria. Methods. Of 2239 constipated individuals identified during the telephone interview, 1037 (46.3%) were willing to provide a postal address for a questionnaire, of which 589 (56.8%) returned the questionnaire, inquiring about sociographic data, clinical symptoms, and health care behavior related to constipation, as well as health-related quality-of-life (SF12). Subgroups of functionally constipated individuals were compared. Results. More than 50% of the respondents reported a somatic comorbid condition and/or regular medication intake that may contribute to constipation. We split the remaining individuals (N = 214) into three groups, matching Rome-criteria for IBS (IBS-C, n = 64) and for functional constipation (FC-R, n = 36) and FC not matching Rome criteria (n = 114). Nearly all sociographic and clinical characteristics were equal among them, and all individuals with constipation had similar and lowered QOL on the SF-12 physical health domain, but in IBS-C the scores were also significantly lower in comparison to FC-R and FC, in both the physical health and the mental health domain. Conclusion. Only a fraction of individuals with chronic constipation match Rome criteria for IBS-C or FC, but subgroups do not differ with respect to most other measures except quality-of-life profiles.

The aim of the study was investigation and comparison of the dietary fiber intake among women with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and without, improvement of the dietary fiber intake using interventions with less rough changes of food related behavior and study of its effects on the bowel function, general wellbeing and compliance of patients. In total 100 healthy women, without any clinical signs of gastrointestinal disorders and 98 women who met Rome III criteria of IBS-C were enrolled in the dietary fiber intake assessment survey. The dietary habits of all participants, as well as bowel function, digestive feelings and general wellbeing of patients at baseline, on the 7th and 14th day of dietary intervention was assessed by the means of adopted questionnaires. The dietary supplementation was provided during the breakfast with fiber enriched food - bread and muesli. Research data reviled significantly lower daily intake of dietary fiber among patients with IBS-C compared with healthy group. The main source of dietary fiber in IBS-C group was bread and cereals, therefore introduction of dietary fiber rich bread and muesli in the breakfast didn't affect diet-related habits and determined high compliance of patients. Two week long intervention significantly improved the bowel function and irritation related complains, the feeling of general wellbeing was considerably better on the endpoint as well.\n\nClinical Practice Guideline: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and functional constipation in the adult.\n\nPubMed\n\nMearin, FermÃ­n; Ciriza, Constanza; MÃ­nguez, Miguel; Rey, Enrique; Mascort, Juan JosÃ©; PeÃ±a, Enrique; CaÃ±ones, Pedro; JÃºdez, Javier\n\n2016-06-01\n\nIn this Clinical Practice Guideline we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of adult patients with constipation and abdominal complaints at the confluence of the irritable bowel syndrome spectrum and functional constipation. Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or absence of pain, albeit not in an \"all or nothing\" manner. Severity depends not only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016, and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between Primary Care and gastroenterology settings.

The FDA has approved lubiprostone for the treatment of chronic constipation in men and women and the treatment of women with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Lubiprostone specifically activates type-2-chloride channels on the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Lubiprostone acts locally within the intestinal tract, is rapidly metabolized and has very low systemic bioavailability. Animal studies have demonstrated that lubiprostone increases gastrointestinal fluid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Clinical studies performed in men and women with chronic constipation using 24 microg of lubiprostone twice-daily demonstrated objective improvement in stool frequency and consistency, as well as symptoms of straining and incomplete evacuation. A multi-center study of patients with IBS-C found that 8 microg of lubiprostone twice-daily improved both global and individual symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Lubiprostone is generally well tolerated and serious adverse events are rare. The most common reported side effects are nausea, headache and diarrhea. This monograph provides a brief overview on chloride channel function in the gastrointestinal tract, describes the structure, function, and pharmacokinetics of lubiprostone, and discusses the safety and efficacy of this new medication for the treatment of chronic constipation and IBS-C.\n\nClinical trial: phase 2 study of lubiprostone for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohanson, J F; Drossman, D A; Panas, R; Wahle, A; Ueno, R\n\n2008-04-01\n\nAnalyses of a trial in constipated patients indicated that lubiprostone may be an effective treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. To assess the efficacy and safety of three lubiprostone doses for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. 195 irritable bowel syndrome with constipation patients received daily doses of 16 [8 microg twice daily (b.d.)], 32 (16 microg b.d.) or 48 microg (24 microg b.d.) lubiprostone or placebo b.d. for 3 months. Gastrointestinal parameters were recorded in diaries daily by patients. After 1 month, lubiprostone showed significantly greater improvements in mean abdominal discomfort/pain scores vs. placebo (P = 0.023). After 2 months, all lubiprostone groups showed significantly greater improvements in mean abdominal discomfort/pain scores (P < or = 0.039). After 3 months of treatment, the improvement in each lubiprostone arm was greater than placebo, but the test for trend was no longer significant. Treatment with lubiprostone showed significantly higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events (P = 0.020), especially diarrhoea and nausea. Lubiprostone significantly improved gastrointestinal symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation at all doses. Higher doses of lubiprostone, especially the 48 microg/day group, were associated with more gastrointestinal adverse events. From these data, the 16 microg/day dose demonstrated the optimal combination of efficacy and safety. These results warrant further study of lubiprostone for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation patients.\n\nLubiprostone for chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaad, Richard; Chey, William D\n\n2008-08-01\n\nLubiprostone, a locally acting highly selective type-2 chloride channel activator, has been US FDA approved since January 2006 for the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation and FDA approved since April 2008 for the treatment of woman aged 18 years or older suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation. Through activation of the type-2 chloride channels located on the luminal side of intestinal epithelial cells, it promotes fluid secretion, increasing the liquid content of stool and accelerating small bowel as well as colonic transit. Lubiprostone has demonstrated efficacy with respect to increasing weekly spontaneous bowel movements and improving stool consistency, straining and constipation severity, both in short- and long-term studies. It has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of IBS with constipation, with beneficial effects on global symptoms, abdominal pain, constipation-related symptoms and overall quality of life. There is no evidence of a rebound in constipation or IBS symptoms following cessation of lubiprostone. In general, lubiprostone is well tolerated, with the most common side effects including nausea, headache and diarrhea.\n\n[Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and functional constipation in adults: Treatment (Part 2 of 2)].\n\nPubMed\n\nMearin, F; Ciriza, C; MÃ­nguez, M; Rey, E; Mascort, J J; PeÃ±a, E; CaÃ±ones, P; JÃºdez, J\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIn this Clinical practice guide we examine the diagnostic and therapeutic management of adult patients with constipation and abdominal discomfort, at the confluence of the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation.

Current therapy for the constipation-predominant form (IBS-C) comprises fiber or osmotic or stimulant laxatives. However, these may exacerbate the condition or cause electrolyte disturbances. Lubiprostone is a novel selective chloride channel-2 activator that increases fluid secretion in the intestinal apical cell membrane, increasing gut motility and frequency of stool passage, and alleviating abdominal discomfort/pain. Lubiprostone has very low systemic bioavailability and cannot be quantitated in blood, but its active metabolite, M3, has been pharmacokinetically profiled. Lubiprostone reaches peak plasma concentrations within approximately 1 h and has a half-life of 0.9-1.4 h. Despite this short half-life, lubiprostone can be administered orally twice daily. Its efficacy in IBS-C has been demonstrated in two phase III studies; spontaneous bowel movement frequency increased and stool consistency improved, whereas straining, bloating and severity of constipation decreased. The beneficial effects continued for up to 4 weeks after cessation of lubiprostone. Lubiprostone was well tolerated in the long-term, with nausea and diarrhea being the commonest adverse events. Further studies are ongoing in opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Copyright 2008 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

Patients with IBS may be classified by their predominant bowel habit: diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or IBS with alternating bowel movements. IBS is often associated with stress or anxiety. Although IBS can be frustrating and concerning to patients with this disorder, it does not cause permanent harm to the intestines and does not lead to a serious disease such as cancer. Although treatments exist for its symptoms, there is no known cure. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Although bowel habits may change over the course of years, patients with IBS are characterized according to their predominant bowel habit, constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed type (IBS-M), and treatments are focused toward the predominant symptom. Current treatments for IBS-C have included fiber, antispasmodics, osmotic and stimulant laxatives, and the now severely limited 5-HT4 agonist tegaserod. No one agent has been universally successful in the treatment of this bothersome syndrome and the search for new agents continues. Lubiprostone (AmitizaÂ®), a novel compound, is a member of a new class of agents called prostones and was approved for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in 2006 at a dose of 24 Î¼g twice daily and then in 2008 for the treatment of IBS-C in women only at a dose of 8 Î¼g twice daily. Its purported mechanism is as a type 2 chloride channel activator, but recent evidence suggests that it may also work at the cystic fibrosis transport receptor. This article will compare the newly proposed mechanism of action of this compound to the purported mechanism and review the structure, pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and tolerability of this new therapeutic option. Clinical trial data leading to the approval of this agent for the treatment of IBS-C and the gender-based understanding of IBS, as well as this agentâs place among existing and emerging therapies, will be examined. PMID:21151683\n\nSafety evaluation of lubiprostone in the treatment of constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nChamberlain, Sherman M; Rao, Satish S C\n\n2012-09-01\n\nLubiprostone is approved in the United States for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). Lubiprostone causes secretion of fluid and electrolytes in the small bowel, through the activation of chloride channels, and thereby induces laxation and improvement of bowel functions. It is generally considered to be safe and effective. Common side effects of lubiprostone include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating, and the rare side effect dyspnea. Likely mechanisms for these side effects may be related to lubiprostone's primary action on small bowel secretion and the associated intestinal distension, as well as smooth muscle contraction. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of lubiprostone, with particular relevance to the two FDA-approved dosages. Lubiprostone acts topically in the gut lumen and is almost completely metabolized in the gut lumen. Lubiprostone's M3 metabolite can be detected in low concentrations in the serum and may be responsible for some of its side effects. However, the exact mechanisms by which the side effects are produced are currently unknown.\n\nTargeted therapies for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOlden, Kevin W\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and bowel pattern abnormalities, which compromise patientsâ daily functioning. Common therapies address one or two IBS symptoms, while others offer wider symptom control, presumably by targeting pathophysiologic mechanisms of IBS. The aim of this targeted literature review was to capture clinical trial reports of agents receiving the highest recommendation (Grade 1) for treatment of IBS from the 2009 American College of Gastroenterology IBS Task Force, with an emphasis on diarrhea-predominant IBS. Literature searches in PubMed captured articles detailing randomized placebo-controlled trials in IBS/diarrhea-predominant IBS for agents receiving Grade I (strong) 2009 American College of Gastroenterology IBS Task Force recommendations: tricyclic antidepressants, nonabsorbable antibiotics, and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alosetron. Studies specific for constipation-predominant IBS were excluded. Tricyclic antidepressants appear to improve global IBS symptoms but have variable effects on abdominal pain and uncertain tolerability; effects on stool consistency, frequency, and urgency were not adequately assessed. Nonabsorbable antibiotics show positive effects on global symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, and stool consistency but may be most efficacious in patients with altered intestinal microbiota. Alosetron improves global symptoms and abdominal pain and normalizes bowel irregularities, including stool frequency, consistency, and fecal urgency. Both the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alosetron improve quality of life. Targeted therapies provide more complete relief of IBS symptoms than conventional agents. Familiarization with the quantity and quality of evidence of effectiveness can facilitate more individualized treatment plans for patients with this heterogeneous disorder.

A large proportion of patients suffer from the constipation subtype of IBS (IBS-C), most commonly afflicting older individuals and those with a lower socioeconomic status. Conventional pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options have limited efficacies and/or significant adverse events, which lead to increased long-term health care expenditures. Failure to effectively treat IBS-C patients over the past decades has largely been due to a poor understanding of disease pathophysiology, lack of a global view of the patient, and an inappropriate selection of patients and treatment endpoints in clinical trials. In recent years, however, more effective and safer drugs have been developed for the treatment of IBS-C. The advancement in the area of pharmacologic treatment is based on new knowledge of the pathophysiologic basis of IBS-C and the development of drugs with increased selectivity within pharmacologic classes with recognized efficacies. This narrative review covers the spectrum of available drugs and their mechanisms of action, as well as the efficacy and safety profiles of each as determined in relevant clinical trials that have investigated treatment options for IBS-C and chronic constipation. A brief summary of laxative-based treatment options is presented, followed by up-to-date assessments for three classes of drugs: prokinetics, prosecretory agents, and bile acid modulators.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) are common functional lower gastrointestinal disorders that impair patients' quality of life. In a national survey, we aimed to evaluate (1) Canadian physician practice patterns in the utilization of therapeutic agents listed in the new ACG and AGA guidelines; (2) physicians satisfaction with these agents for their CIC and IBS-C patients; and (3) the usefulness of these new guidelines in their clinical practice. Methods . A 9-item questionnaire was sent to 350 Canadian specialists to evaluate their clinical practice for the management of CIC and IBS-C. Results . The response rate to the survey was 16% ( n = 55). Almost all (96%) respondents followed a standard, stepwise approach for management while they believed that only 24% of referring physicians followed the same approach. Respondents found guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) agonist most satisfying when treating their patients. Among the 69% of respondents who were aware of published guidelines, only 50% found them helpful in prioritizing treatment choices and 69% of respondents indicated that a treatment algorithm, applicable to Canadian practice, would be valuable. Conclusion . Based on this needs assessment, a treatment algorithm was developed to provide clinical guidance in the management of IBS-C and CIC in Canada.\n\nDefining and diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchuster, M M\n\n2001-07-01\n\nApproximately 20% of the general population has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the majority of these individuals do not consult a physician, IBS accounts for 25% of visits to a gastroenterologist and up to 12% of visits to a primary care physician. Consequently, the direct and indirect costs associated with IBS are estimated at $8 billion annually. IBS symptoms, with no apparent structural pathology, include altered bowel habits, abdominal pain/discomfort, and bloating. The Rome II criteria, a standardized guideline for the diagnosis of IBS, contains in its definition abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. Bloating may often be present. Three patient subgroups are defined according to the predominant bowel symptom: constipation, diarrhea, or alternating constipation and diarrhea. Hematology, fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and lactose intolerance evaluations are recommended for all patients demonstrating symptoms of IBS. When indicated, tests are recommended to rule out bacterial or parasitic infections, pelvic floor muscle dyssynergia, colonic inertia, peptic ulcer, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nAlosetron for severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: safety and efficacy in perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nLewis, James H\n\n2010-02-01\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome affects 5-10% of North Americans, with an estimated one-third having a diarrhea-predominant form. Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is a serotonin receptor type 3 antagonist approved in early 2000 for use in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Initial use was widespread, but infrequent serious adverse events of ischemic colitis and severe constipation-related complications prompted alosetron's voluntary withdrawal from the US market in November 2000. Unprecedented public request prompted its reintroduction in 2002 under a Risk Management Plan, including a more restricted indication and a Prescribing Program for Lotronex. Despite these measures, the use of alosetron has been very limited since its reintroduction. Possible deterrents to its use include concerns over safety and the possible medical-legal implications raised by the Risk Management Plan. It is also possible that changes in the natural history and/or diagnosis of IBS-D have reduced the target population. Given the unique regulatory history of alosetron, these issues continue to engender controversy. This article profiles these concerns and reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety, and post-marketing experience with alosetron. Myths and misconceptions related to alosetron use, or lack thereof, are addressed to provide the reader with the evidence needed to make informed treatment decisions for their female patients with severe IBS-D.\n\nTegaserod in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation as the prime symptom\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLayer, Peter; Keller, Jutta; Loeffler, Helena; Kreiss, Andreas\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) as the predominant bowel symptom is a prevalent disorder, characterized by recurring abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and constipation, and imposes a significant socio-economic burden. Traditional treatments generally address just one of the multiple IBS symptoms. The efficacy and safety profile of tegaserod, a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist, has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo-controlled, and open-label trials. This review discusses the major clinical trials of tegaserod, which have involved 8948 IBS patients. Overall, data reveal that tegaserod is an effective treatment for IBS-C, providing statistically significant relief of overall and multiple individual IBS-C symptoms (abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and constipation) in both placebo-controlled and âreal-lifeâ open-label settings. Repeat treatments with tegaserod were also shown to be effective, which is noteworthy given the chronic and episodic nature of IBS. Moreover, tegaserod was associated with improvements in patientsâ quality of life and work productivity. Data also indicate that tegaserod is well tolerated over the short-term (4 weeks), long-term (12 months), and repeated treatments. Diarrhea is the only adverse event consistently associated with tegaserod and was generally mild and transient. Overall, tegaserod has been demonstrated to offer effective and well-tolerated treatment of IBS-C, providing patients with meaningful symptom relief.

It was approved in the USA for chronic idiopathic constipation (January 2006) and in women aged â¥ 18 years suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) (April 2008). So far, the only other pro-secretory medication approved in IBS-C and currently available in USA and Europe (since August and November 2012, respectively) is linaclotide. This review outlines the regulatory history, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety data in the treatment of IBS-C with a European perspective. It is based on publicly available data, namely, published literature, drug labels and the FDA's spontaneous reporting system. Although interesting pharmacodynamic data suggest that lubiprostone may have additional mechanisms of action, its beneficial effects in IBS-C must be confirmed in the actual clinical scenario taking into account the new version of European Medicines Agency's guideline. This is especially important with regard to duration of studies (recommended to be at least 6 months) to adequately assess long-term sustained efficacy, withdrawal, rebound and safety. Further research is warranted in uncertain areas (i.e., males, pediatric and elderly patients). On the basis of current data, it is still too early to draw definite conclusions on the overall risk-benefit balance for IBS-C.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation: Fact and fiction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBellini, Massimo; Gambaccini, Dario; Usai-Satta, Paolo; De Bortoli, Nicola; Bertani, Lorenzo; Marchi, Santino; Stasi, Cristina\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional constipation (FC) are the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders. According to the Rome III Criteria these two disorders should be theoretically separated mainly by the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort relieved by defecation (typical of IBS) and they should be mutually exclusive. However, many gastroenterologists have serious doubts as regards a clear separation. Both IBS-C and FC, often associated with many other functional digestive and non digestive disorders, are responsible for a low quality of life. The impact of the media on patientsâ perception of these topics is sometimes disruptive, often suggesting a distorted view of pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy. These messages frequently overlap with previous subjective opinions and are further processed on the basis of the different culture and the previous experience of the constipated patients, often producing odd, useless or even dangerous behaviors. The aim of this review was to analyze the most common patientsâ beliefs about IBS-C and CC, helping physicians to understand where they should focus their attention when communicating with patients, detecting false opinions and misconceptions and correcting them on the basis of scientific evidence.

Due to its poor absorption, rifaximin has an increased exposure to the intestine, thus it is suitable for the treatment of many gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathogenesis, gut microbiota impairment may play a major role. The possibility of modulating intestinal bacteria using antibiotics, in particular, rifaximin, has been demonstrated to improve IBS symptoms in non-constipation subtypes of IBS. We reviewed the use of rifaximin in diarrhoea-predominant IBS, focusing on its pharmacokinetic characteristics, its absorption in GI disease, its lack of interaction with other drugs and its new extended release formulation. Rifaximin, with its low systemic absorption and no clinically significant interactions with other drugs, may represent a treatment of choice for IBS, mainly due to its ability to act on IBS pathogenesis, through the modulation of gut microbiota. Further studies to analyse the effect of rifaximin treatment on the composition of faecal microbiota are warranted. In particular, they need to evaluate whether resistant bacterial strains are selected and whether they are still present in the faecal sample even a long time after therapy.\n\nLubiprostone Is Effective in the Treatment of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Fan; Fu, Tao; Tong, Wei-Dong; Liu, Bao-Hua; Li, Chun-Xue; Gao, Yu; Wu, Jin-Song; Wang, Xiang-Feng; Zhang, An-Ping\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of lubiprostone in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). We performed a literature search of the MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases (from January 1, 2005, through January 31, 2015). Relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria were manually searched by 2 independent reviewers. Efficacy outcomes evaluated at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months of intervention were weekly frequency of spontaneous bowel movements, severity of constipation, consistency of stools, degree of abdominal pain/discomfort, degree of straining, and abdominal bloating. Of 246 studies identified, data from 9 trials comprising 1468 patients (63.6%) in the lubiprostone group and 841 (36.4%) in the placebo group were analyzed. We found that lubiprostone treatment significantly improved the severity of constipation, stool consistency, abdominal pain, degree of straining, and abdominal bloating at 1 week (Pâ¤.03) and 1 month (Pâ¤.004), except for abdominal pain at 1 month, which was similar to that when treated with placebo (P=.21). At 3 months, except for abdominal bloating (P=.03), there was no difference between lubiprostone and placebo groups in all other outcomes (Pâ¥.05). Adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were common (incidence rate, 2.4%-75%); however, the incidence of serious adverse effects was low (<5%) and was mostly unrelated to lubiprostone treatment. Lubiprostone is a safe and efficacious drug for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, with limited adverse effects in 3 months of follow-up.

The DA-IBS formula was designed to treat diarrhea-predominant and alternating bowel habit IBS, and the C-IBS formula was designed to treat constipation-predominant IBS. This was a two arm, open-label, uncontrolled pilot study. Subjects were recruited from the greater Lismore area (NSW, Australia) in 2001. The study included 31 patients who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS. Twenty-one (21) patients were classified as suffering from diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit IBS and 10 patients were classified with constipation-predominant IBS. The DA-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried, powdered bilberry fruit, slippery elm bark, agrimony aerial parts, and cinnamon quills. The C-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried powdered slippery elm bark, lactulose, oat bran, and licorice root. The aim of each formula was to normalize stool frequency and stool consistency. Ingestion of the DA-IBS formula was associated with a small, but significant increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.027). Subjects in the DA-IBS group also experienced reductions in straining (p = 0.004), abdominal pain (p = 0.006), bloating (p < 0.0001), flatulence (p = 0.0001), and global IBS symptoms (p = 0.002) during the treatment phase of the trial. Subjects in the C-IBS group experienced a 20% increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.016) and significant reductions in straining (p < 0.0001), abdominal pain (p = 0.032), bloating (p = 0.034), and global IBS symptom severity (p = 0.0005), as well as improvements in stool consistency (p < 0.0001). Both formulas were well-tolerated. The DA-IBS formula was not effective in improving bowel habit in individuals with diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit IBS, although it did significantly improve a number of IBS\n\nConstipation\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... constipation, as well as other conditions, like diarrhea.

To assess and determine the frequency of rifaximin and placebo adverse events (AEs) in phase 2b and phase 3 non-C IBS trials. A post hoc pooled safety analysis of the phase 2b (rifaximin 275, 550, and 1100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks; 550 mg twice daily for 4 weeks) and phase 3 (rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) studies was performed. Data on treatment and post-treatment AEs were collected. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks and 10 weeks post-treatment in the phase 2b and phase 3 trials, respectively. Patients receiving rifaximin (n = 1103) and placebo (n = 829) had a similar incidence of drug-related AEs (12.1% vs. 10.7%), serious AEs (1.5% vs. 2.2%), drug-related AEs resulting in study discontinuation (0.8% vs. 0.8%), gastrointestinal-associated AEs (12.2% vs. 12.2%) and infection-associated AEs (8.5% vs. 9.5%). There were no cases of Clostridium difficile colitis or deaths. The safety and tolerability profile of rifaximin during treatment and post-treatment was comparable to placebo. Future research should define the safety and tolerability profile, including risk of C. difficile colitis and microbial antibiotic resistance, with repeated courses of rifaximin in patients with non-constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00269412, NCT00731679, and NCT00724126).

To identify whether clinical and lifestyle factors differentiate Rome III-defined IBS-C from FC based on gastrointestinal symptoms and lifestyle characteristics. 3260 people randomly selected from the Australian population returned a postal survey. FC and IBS-C were defined according to Rome III. The first model used logistic regression to differentiate IBS-C from FC based on lifestyle, quality-of-life and psychological characteristics. The second approach was data-driven employing latent class analysis (LCA) to identify naturally occurring clusters in the data considering all symptoms involved in the Rome III criteria for IBS-C and FC. We found nÂ =Â 206 (6.5%; 95% CI 5.7-7.4%) people met strict Rome III FC whereas nÂ =Â 109 (3.5%; 95% CI 2.8-4.1%) met strict Rome III IBS-C. The case-control approach indicated that FC patients reported an older age at onset of constipation, were less likely to exercise, had higher mental QoL and less health care seeking than IBS-C. LCA yielded one latent class that was predominantly (75%) FC, while the other class was approximately half IBS-C and half FC. The FC-dominated latent class had clearly lower levels of symptoms used to classify IBS (pain-related symptoms) and was more likely to be male (PÂ =Â 0.046) but was otherwise similar in distribution of lifestyle factors to the mixed class. The latent class analysis approach suggests a differentiation based more on symptom severity rather than the Rome III view.

Forty-two patients meeting Rome II criteria for IBS-C and with a pain threshold of < 32 mmHg were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either oral PEG, 3.45 g t.i.d. orally for 30 days or placebo. Rectal sensitivity was assessed before and after treatment with a barostat using the ascending method of limits, during basal and PP periods. No changes in fasting and PP rectal tone and thresholds for first sensation, gas sensation, urge to defecate, and pain was observed with PEG in relation to placebo. In both groups, pressure at which patients crossed the thresholds for noxious (PEG: from 28 Â± 8.8 to 22 Â± 6.9 mmHg) and non noxious (PEG: from 16 Â± 4.9 to 12 Â± 3.6 mmHg) stimuli decreased compared with pretreatment values. PEG improved consistency of faeces and showed a trend to diminish blood in faeces. PEG and placebo increased bowel movements per week (P < 0.001), and relieved symptoms without significant side-effects. Both PEG 3350 and placebo were clinically useful in patients with IBS-C, an effect that cannot be explained by changes in rectal tone and sensation. The results support the concept that visceral sensitivity is not stable and has a heterogeneous response to drugs, and suggest the existence of a post healing hypersensitivity state.

The pathophysiology of IBS is not completely understood but appears to involve genetics, the gut microbiome, immune activation, altered intestinal permeability, and brain-gut interactions. There is no gold standard for diagnosis. Several sets of symptom-based guidelines exist. Treatment strategies for IBS may include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. Lifestyle modifications that aim to improve exercise, sleep, diet, and stress may be warranted. Recent data suggest that a gluten-free diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) may benefit some patients. For patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, treatment options include the synthetic peripheral Î¼-opioid receptor agonist loperamide, antispasmodic agents, antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT3 antagonists, and the gut-specific antibiotic rifaximin. Ongoing research is evaluating the use of probiotics. For patients with constipation-predominant IBS, therapeutic strategies may include dietary fiber, laxatives, and the prosecretory agents lubiprostone and linaclotide. Research is continuing to optimize the use of available agents and evaluating new approaches to further improve the care of patients with IBS.

Although not life-threatening, this chronic disorder reduces patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to the healthcare system. IBS is no longer considered a diagnosis of exclusion that can only be made after performing a battery of expensive diagnostic tests. Rather, IBS should be confidently diagnosed in the clinic at the time of the first visit using the Rome III criteria and a careful history and physical examination. Treatment options for IBS have increased in number in the past decade and clinicians should not be limited to using only fiber supplements and smooth muscle relaxants. Although all patients with IBS have symptoms of abdominal pain and disordered defecation, treatment needs to be individualized and should focus on the predominant symptom. This paper will review therapeutic options for the treatment of IBS using a tailored approach based on the predominant symptom. Abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhea are the four main symptoms that can be addressed using a combination of dietary interventions and medications. Treatment options include probiotics, antibiotics, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and agents that modulate chloride channels and serotonin. Each class of agent will be reviewed using the latest data from the literature.\n\nChronic Constipation and Constipation-Predominant IBS: Separate and Distinct Disorders or a Spectrum of Disease?\n\nPubMed\n\nSiah, Kewin T H; Wong, Reuben K; Whitehead, William E\n\n2016-03-01\n\nRome III diagnostic criteria separate patients with idiopathic chronic constipation into mutually exclusive categories of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) or functional constipation (FC). However, several experts think that these conditions are not different disorders, but parts of a continuum. To shed light on this issue, we examined studies that compared IBS-C with FC with respect to symptoms, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and treatment response. When the Rome III requirement that patients meeting criteria for IBS cannot also be given a diagnosis of FC is suspended, most patients meet criteria for both, and, contrary to expectation, IBS-C patients have more symptoms of constipation than patients with FC. No symptoms reliably separate IBS-C from FC. Physiologic tests are not reliably associated with diagnosis, but visceral pain hypersensitivity tends to be more strongly associated with IBS-C than with FC, and delayed colonic transit tends to be more common in FC. Although some treatments are effective for both IBS-C and FC, such as prosecretory agents, other treatments are specific to IBS-C (eg, antidepressants, antispasmodics, cognitive behavior therapy) or FC (eg, prucalopride, biofeedback). Future studies should permit IBS-C and FC diagnoses to overlap. Physiologic tests comparing these disorders should include visceral pain sensitivity, colonic transit time, time to evacuate a water-filled balloon, and anal pressures or electromyographic activity from the anal canal. To date, differential responses to treatment provide the strongest evidence that IBS-C and FC may be different disorders, rather than parts of a spectrum.\n\nChronic Constipation and Constipation-Predominant IBS: Separate and Distinct Disorders or a Spectrum of Disease?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSiah, Kewin T.

The proper differential diagnosis requires total colonoscopy with multiple biopsies from normal-appearing mucosa and a detailed histopathological exam. Specific treatment may improve symptomatology. To evaluate the prevalence of MC in patients with an initial diagnosis of IBS-D, to analyse demographic and clinical features of MC patients and to assess the efficacy of specific treatment. Our retrospective study analyzed patients diagnosed with microscopic colitis in clinic during a three-year period. Diagnosis was established on histological exams of the samples obtained during colonoscopy in patients previously thought to have IBS-D. We evaluated clinical manifestations, time lapsed from their onset to definitive diagnosis, the association of MC with autoimmune diseases or with prior medication and the efficacy of treatment with budesonide or mesalazine. From 247 patients considered to have IBS-D, 15 patients (6.07%) had actually MC (13 lymphocytic colitis and 2 collagenous colitis). MC was associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (3 patients), Lansoprazole (2 patients) and autoimmune diseases (6 patients). Watery, non-bloody diarrhea was present in all patients with MC. Other frequent complaints were nocturnal diarrhea (11 patients), abdominal pain (8 patients), abdominal bloating and flatulence (8 patients) and slight weight loss (6 patients). The diagnostic samples were obtained from the right colon in 6 cases and from rectosigmoid or transverse colon in 9 patients. Treatment was initial symptomatic in all patients, but there were 5 patients that required mesalazine and/or Budesonide, with favourable outcome. All the patients thought to have diarrhea-irritable bowel syndrome should be evaluated for microscopic colitis. Symptomatology is almost superimposable, but a few distinct features can be noticed.

The prevalence of IBS has increased among Asian populations these days. Gastrointestinal (GI) physiology may vary between Asian and Western populations because of differences in diets, socio-cultural backgrounds, and genetic factors. The characteristics and differences of GI dysmotility in Asian IBS patients were reviewed. MEDLINE search work was performed including following terms, 'IBS,' 'motility,' 'transit time,' 'esophageal motility,' 'gastric motility,' 'small intestinal motility,' 'colonic motility,' 'anorectal function,' and 'gallbladder motility' and over 100 articles were categorized under 'esophagus,' 'stomach,' 'small intestine,' 'colon,' 'anorectum,' 'gallbladder,' 'transit,' 'motor pattern,' and 'effect of stressors.' Delayed gastric emptying, slow tansit in constipation predominant IBS patients, rapid transit in diarrhea predominant IBS patients, accelerated motility responses to various stressors such as meals, mental stress, or corticotrophin releasing hormones, and altered rectal compliance and altered rectal accomodation were reported in many Asian studies regarding IBS. Many conflicting results were found among these studies and there are still controversies to conclude these as unique features of Asian IBS patients. Multinational and multicenter studies are needed to be performed vigorously in order to elaborate characteristics as well as differences of altered motililty in Asian patients with IBS.\n\nEvaluation of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire in diarrheal-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-d) significantly diminishes the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients. Psychological and social impacts are common with many IBS-d patients reporting comorbid depression, anxiety, decreased intimacy, and lost working days. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire is a 34-item instrument developed and validated for measurement of HRQOL in non-subtyped IBS patients. The current paper assesses this previously-validated instrument employing data collected from 754 patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of a novel treatment, eluxadoline, for IBS-d. Methods Psychometric methods common to HRQOL research were employed to evaluate the IBS-QOL. Many of the historical analyses of the IBS-QOL validations were used. Other techniques that extended the original methods were applied where more appropriate for the current dataset. In IBS-d patients, we analyzed the items and substructure of the IBS-QOL via item reduction, factor structure, internal consistency, reproducibility, construct validity, and ability to detect change. Results This study supports the IBS-QOL as a psychometrically valid measure. Factor analyses suggested that IBS-specific QOL as measured by the IBS-QOL is a unidimensional construct. Construct validity was further buttressed by significant correlations between IBS-QOL total scores and related measures of IBS-d severity including the historically-relevant Irritable Bowel Syndrome Adequate Relief (IBS-AR) item and the FDAâs Clinical Responder definition. The IBS-QOL also showed a significant ability to detect change as evidenced by analysis of treatment effects. A minority of the items, unrelated to the IBS-d, performed less well by the standards set by the original authors. Conclusions We established that the IBS-QOL total score is a psychometrically valid measure of HRQOL in IBS-d patients enrolled in this study. Our analyses suggest that\n\n[Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in Veracruz City, Mexico: a community-based survey].\n\nPubMed\n\nValerio-UreÃ±a, J; VÃ¡squez-FernÃ¡ndez, F; JimÃ©nez-Pineda, A; CortÃ¡zar-BenÃ­tez, L F; Azamar-JÃ¡come, A A; Duarte-VelÃ¡zquez, M E; Torres-Medina, V\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is recognized as the most frequent functional digestive disorder around the world.

Using basic information given by bureau for planning urban services from Veracruz country, a 10% random population sample was obtained. Subjects between 16-80 years old were interviewed using a questionnaire based on Rome II criteria and a visual analogous scale in order to estimate the negative effect of IBS symptoms on daily activities. We interviewed 459 subjects with a median age of 31.2 +/- 13.6 years old detecting 78 subjects (16.9%) with IBS symptoms: 25 males and 53 females (gender prevalence of 11.3% and 22.1%, respectively). 28.2% of them had IBS with diarrhea, 50% had IBS with constipation and 21.8% alternating bowel movements, diarrhea and constipation. Negative effect of IBS symptoms on daily activities was significant. The prevalence of IBS in open population was 16.9% according to Rome II criteria, being higher in those older than 35 years old. Constipation was the predominant pattern. Further studies should evaluate associated factors of these findings.\n\nMicroscopic Colitis â A Missed Diagnosis in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSTOICESCU, Adriana; BECHEANU, Gabriel; DUMBRAVA, Mona; GHEORGHE, Cristian; DICULESCU, Mircea\n\n2012-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Background: Clinical presentation in microscopic colitis (MC) is similar in many cases to that of diarrhea-predominent irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). The proper differential diagnosis requires total colonoscopy with multiple biopsies from normal-appearing mucosa and a detailed histopathological exam. Specific treatment may improve symptomatology. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of MC in patients with an initial diagnosis of IBS-D, to analyse demographic and clinical features of MC patients and to assess the efficacy of specific treatment. Material and methods: Our retrospective study analyzed patients diagnosed with microscopic colitis in clinic during a three-year period. Diagnosis was established on histological exams of the samples obtained during colonoscopy in patients previously thought to have IBS-D. We evaluated clinical manifestations, time lapsed from their onset to definitive diagnosis, the association of MC with autoimmune diseases or with prior medication and the efficacy of treatment with budesonide or mesalazine. Results: From 247 patients considered to have IBS-D, 15 patients (6.07%) had actually MC (13 lymphocytic colitis and 2 collagenous colitis). MC was associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (3 patients), Lansoprazole (2 patients) and autoimmune diseases (6 patients). Watery, non-bloody diarrhea was present in all patients with MC. Other frequent complaints were nocturnal diarrhea (11 patients), abdominal pain (8 patients), abdominal bloating and flatulence (8 patients) and slight weight loss (6 patients). The diagnostic samples were obtained from the right colon in 6 cases and from rectosigmoid or transverse colon in 9 patients. Treatment was initial symptomatic in all patients, but there were 5 patients that required mesalazine and/or Budesonide, with favourable outcome. Conclusions: All the patients thought to have diarrhea-irritable bowel syndrome should be evaluated for microscopic colitis. Symptomatology is almost\n\nSafety and patient outcomes with lubiprostone for up to 52 weeks in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.\n\nPubMed\n\nChey, W D; Drossman, D A; Johanson, J F; Scott, C; Panas, R M; Ueno, R\n\n2012-03-01\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) significantly decreases quality of life and the ability to perform daily living activities. To demonstrate the long-term safety, tolerability and patient outcomes of lubiprostone in patients with IBS-C. This extension study enrolled 522 IBS-C patients who had completed one of two randomised phase 3 studies. All enrolled patients received open-label lubiprostone orally for 36-weeks (8 mcg, twice daily). The primary objective was the assessment of long-term safety and tolerability, monitored via adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters and vital signs. Additional outcome endpoints included monthly responder rates and patient evaluations of IBS-C symptom severity and impact on quality of life. The evaluable safety population comprised of 520 patients; 476 of which had patient reported outcome data available. The overall safety profile of lubiprostone during this study was similar to that observed in the preceding phase 3 studies. The most common AEs were diarrhoea (11.0%), nausea (11.0%), urinary tract infection (9.0%), sinusitis (9.0%) and abdominal distention (5.8%). Diarrhoea and nausea were the most common treatment-related AEs. No serious AEs were considered treatment-related. Seventeen patients discontinued due to a treatment-related AE, of which diarrhoea and nausea accounted for six (1.2%) and three (0.6%) respectively. For responder rates and patient-evaluated parameters (n = 476), all groups experienced significant improvements from baseline, with initial improvements maintained throughout the study. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, lubiprostone 8 mcg twice daily was found to be safe and well tolerated over 9-13 months of treatment.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of PEG 3350+E vs. placebo in adult patients with IBS-C. Following a 14-day run-in period without study medication, patients with confirmed IBS-C were randomized to receive PEG 3350+E (N=68) or placebo (N=71) for 28 days. The primary endpoint was the mean number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per day in the last treatment week. In both groups, mean weekly number of SBMs (Â±s.d.) increased from run-in. The difference between the groups in week 4 (PEG 3350+E, 4.40Â±2.581; placebo, 3.11Â±1.937) was statistically significant (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.95; P<0.0001). Although mean severity score for abdominal discomfort/pain was significantly reduced compared with run-in with PEG 3350+E, there was no difference vs. placebo. Spontaneous complete bowel movements, responder rates, stool consistency, and severity of straining also showed superior improvement in the PEG 3350+E group over placebo in week 4. The most common drug related treatment-emergent adverse events were abdominal pain (PEG 3350+E, 4.5%; placebo, 0%) and diarrhoea (PEG 3350+E, 4.5%; placebo, 4.3%). In IBS-C, PEG 3350+E was superior to placebo for relief of constipation, and although a statistically significant improvement in abdominal discomfort/pain was observed compared with baseline, there was no associated improvement compared with placebo. PEG 3350+E is a well-established and effective treatment that should be considered suitable for use in IBS-C.\n\nPharmacological Approach for Managing Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review Article\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Longtu; Ilham, Sheikh J.; Feng, Bin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nContext Visceral pain is a leading symptom for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that affects 10% - 20 % of the world population. Conventional pharmacological treatments to manage IBS-related visceral pain is unsatisfactory. Recently, medications have emerged to treat IBS patients by targeting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and peripheral nerves to alleviate visceral pain while avoiding adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Several investigational drugs for IBS also target the periphery with minimal CNS effects. Evidence of Acquisition In this paper, reputable internet databases from 1960 - 2016 were searched including Pubmed and ClinicalTrials.org, and 97 original articles analyzed. Search was performed based on the following keywords and combinations: irritable bowel syndrome, clinical trial, pain, visceral pain, narcotics, opioid, chloride channel, neuropathy, primary afferent, intestine, microbiota, gut barrier, inflammation, diarrhea, constipation, serotonin, visceral hypersensitivity, nociceptor, sensitization, hyperalgesia. Results Certain conventional pain managing drugs do not effectively improve IBS symptoms, including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, aspirin, and various narcotics. Anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs (Benzodiazepines, TCAs, SSRI and SNRI) can attenuate pain in IBS patients with relevant comorbidities. Clonidine, gabapentin and pregabalin can moderately improve IBS symptoms. Lubiprostone relieves constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) while loperamide improves diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D). Alosetron, granisetron and ondansetron can generally treat pain in IBS-D patients, of which alosetron needs to be used with caution due to cardiovascular toxicity. The optimal drugs for managing pain in IBS-D and IBS-C appear to be eluxadoline and linaclotide, respectively, both of which target peripheral GI tract. Conclusions Conventional pain managing drugs are in general not suitable for treating IBS pain.

This report describes the development and validation of claims-based algorithms to identify colonic ischemia, hospitalized complications of constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). From the research claims databases of a large healthcare company, we selected at random 120 potential cases of IBS and 59 potential cases each of colonic ischemia and hospitalized complications of constipation. We sought the written medical records and were able to abstract 107, 57, and 51 records, respectively. We established a 'true' case status for each subject by applying standard clinical criteria to the available chart data. Comparing the insurance claims histories to the assigned case status, we iteratively developed, tested, and refined claims-based algorithms that would capture the diagnoses obtained from the medical records. We set goals of high specificity for colonic ischemia and hospitalized complications of constipation, and high sensitivity for IBS. The resulting algorithms substantially improved on the accuracy achievable from a naÃ¯ve acceptance of the diagnostic codes attached to insurance claims. The specificities for colonic ischemia and serious complications of constipation were 87.2 and 92.7%, respectively, and the sensitivity for IBS was 98.9%. U.S. commercial insurance claims data appear to be usable for the study of colonic ischemia, IBS, and serious complications of constipation.

Prevalence peaks in the third and fourth decades, with a female predominance. Aim To provide a guide for the assessment and management of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Methods Members of the Clinical Services Committee of The British Society of Gastroenterology were allocated particular areas to produce review documents. Literature searching included systematic searches using electronic databases such as Pubmed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases and extensive personal reference databases. Results Patients can usefully be classified by predominant bowel habit. Few investigations are needed except when diarrhoea is a prominent feature. Alarm features may warrant further investigation. Adverse psychological features and somatisation are often present. Ascertaining the patients' concerns and explaining symptoms in simple terms improves outcome. IBS is a heterogeneous condition with a range of treatments, each of which benefits a small proportion of patients. Treatment of associated anxiety and depression often improves bowel and other symptoms. Randomised placebo controlled trials show benefit as follows: cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic interpersonal therapy improve coping; hypnotherapy benefits global symptoms in otherwise refractory patients; antispasmodics and tricyclic antidepressants improve pain; ispaghula improves pain and bowel habit; 5âHT3 antagonists improve global symptoms, diarrhoea, and pain but may rarely cause unexplained colitis; 5âHT4 agonists improve global symptoms, constipation, and bloating; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors improve global symptoms. Conclusions Better ways of identifying which patients will respond to specific treatments are urgently needed. PMID:17488783\n\n[Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options].\n\nPubMed\n\nDucrottÃ©, Philippe\n\n2007-11-01\n\nRelieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a possible treatment in the future.\n\nLubiprostone in constipation: clinical evidence and place in therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Nicholas; Schey, Ron\n\n2015-03-01\n\nConstipation is one of the most common function bowel disorders encountered by primary care providers and gastroenterologists. Disorders of chronic constipation, including irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, chronic idiopathic constipation, and opioid-induced chronic constipation, are associated with significant medical costs and a negative impact on quality of life. Although there is evidence supporting the effectiveness of some over-the-counter laxatives in chronic constipation, currently there is no evidence supporting lifestyle modification, dietary change or over-the-counter laxatives as effective long-term therapy for patients with chronic constipation. Lubiprostone is a prostaglandin-derived bicyclic fatty acid available to use for long-term treatment of constipation. Lubiprostone works by increasing intraluminal chloride ion secretion, which results in a passive influx of water and sodium, leading to increased intestinal peristalsis and colonic laxation with decreased intestinal stool transit time. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of lubiprostone in patients with chronic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome and opioid-induced constipation have shown it to be effective and free of serious adverse effects. The most common side effects associated with lubiprostone are mild to moderate nausea and diarrhea. Currently lubiprostone is approved for treatment of chronic constipation and opioid-induced constipation for men and women at 24âÂµg twice daily and for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in women at 8âÂµg twice daily. Additional research continues to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of lubiprostone and further work may expand its clinical applications.\n\n[Gallbladder contractility in children with functional abdominal pain or irritable bowel syndrome].\n\nPubMed\n\nIwaÅczak, Franciszek; Siedlecka-Dawidko, Jolanta; Iwanczak, Barbara\n\n2013-07-01\n\nIII Rome Criteria of functional gastrointestinal disorders in children, distinguished the disturbances with abdominal pain, to which irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pains, functional dyspepsia and abdominal migraine were included. THE AIM OF THE STUDY was sonographic assessment of the gallbladder and its contractility in functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome in children. The study comprised 96 children aged 6 to 18 years, 59 girls and 37 boys. Depending on diagnosis, the children were divided into three groups. 38 children with functional abdominal pain constituted the first group, 26 children with irritable bowel syndrome were included to the second group, the third group consisted of 32 healthy children (control group). Diagnosis of functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome was made based on the III Rome Criteria. In irritable bowel syndrome both forms with diarrhea (13) and with constipation (13) were observed. Anatomy and contractility of the gallbladder were assessed by ultrasound examination. The presence of septum, wall thickness, thick bile, vesicle volume in fasting state and 30th and 60th minute after test meal were taken into consideration. Test meal comprised about 15% of caloric requirement of moderate metabolism. Children with bile stones and organic diseases were excluded from the study. Thickened vesicle wall and thick bile were present more frequently in children with irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain than in control group (p < 0.02). Fasting vesicle volume was significantly greater in children with functional abdominal pain than in irritable bowel syndrome and control group (p = 0.003, p = 0.05). Vesicle contractility after test meal was greatest in children with functional abdominal pain. Evaluation of diminished (smaller than 30%) and enlarged (greater then 80%) gallbladder contractility at 30th and 60th minute after test meal demonstrated disturbances of contractility in children\n\nLubiprostone for the treatment of adults with constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchey, Ron; Rao, Satish S C\n\n2011-06-01\n\nChronic constipation and IBS-C are two of the most common functional bowel disorders encountered by primary care providers and gastroenterologists, affecting up to 27% of the population in Western countries [1-4]. The treatment of these disorders is often empiric and most current therapies are indicated for episodic constipation. Over time, most patients become refractory to one or more laxatives. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic-idiopathic constipation [6]. It is an oral bicyclic fatty acid that selectively activates type 2 chloride channels in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells, hence stimulating chloride secretion, along with passive secretion of sodium and water, inducing peristalsis and laxation, without stimulating gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Several trials have shown it to be effective in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, and recently also IBS-C. It has little systemic absorption and almost free of any serious adverse effects, however, occasionally can cause nausea. Based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that lubiprostone should be added to the short list of evidence-based pharmacotherapies for chronic constipation and IBS-C. Given the overlap between chronic constipation and IBS-C, clinicians can consider two strategies when deciding on the initial dose of lubiprostone. Based on current product labeling, it is recommended that 8 Î¼g bid be started in patients with IBS-C whereas 24 Î¼g bid be used in those with chronic constipation. Thus far, lubiprostone offers a novel approach to our therapeutic armamentarium, however, there is a need for more drugs with different mechanisms of action, in order to treat constipation that is often multifunctional.\n\nLubiprostone in constipation: clinical evidence and place in therapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilson, Nicholas\n\n2015-01-01\n\nConstipation is one of the most common function bowel disorders encountered by primary care providers and gastroenterologists.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional disorder, characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or constipation. Sufferers experience negative emotions due to unpredictable symptoms and sometimes feel trivialized by healthcare professionals. The sufferers' experience of living with this disorder has never been explored from a gender perspective. A qualitative, interpretative method was used. A qualitative, hermeneutic method was applied. Interviews were conducted with 19 patients in 2011 and analysed in a constructionist gender framework. Constructionist gender theory views gender and identity as cultural constructs that develop through interplay between the individual and his/her social context and cultural norms. The main theme to emerge from the interviews was as follows: 'A normative framework of femaleness and maleness leads to suffering for persons with irritable bowel syndrome'. This consists of three interwoven themes: 'Being forced to abandon gender illusions'; 'Being forced to transcend taboos' and 'Reinforced suffering in healthcare encounters'. Men demonstrated masculinity by stressing the importance of being solid family providers while women spoke of nurturing and relational responsibilities in line with traditional notions of femininity. The experience of living with irritable bowel syndrome differs between men and women due to differing societal expectations, life situation and the everyday construction of gender identities. Gender stereotyping by healthcare professionals perpetuates rather than alleviates the suffering experienced by men and women with irritable bowel syndrome. In healthcare encounters, women risk being trivialized and men risk being overlooked due to the 'female health concern' label attached to irritable bowel syndrome.

Diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) is a major subtype of IBS, the predominant manifestations of which are abdominal pain and diarrhea. The pathogenesis of IBS-D remained unknown until recently. The effects of psychosocial stress, central hypervigilance, neuroendocrine abnormality, disturbed gastrointestinal motility, mucosal immune activation, intestinal barrier dysfunction, visceral hypersensitivity (VH), altered gut flora, and genetic susceptibility may be involved in its development. Recently, increased attention has been placed on the neural-immune-endocrine network mechanism in IBS-D, especially the role of various neuroendocrine mediators. As a member of the neurotrophin family, nerve growth factor (NGF) has diverse biological effects, and participates in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Basic studies have demonstrated that NGF is associated with inflammatory- and stress-related VH, as well as stress-related intestinal barrier dysfunction. The aim of this study is to summarize recent literature and discuss the role of NGF in the pathophysiology of IBS-D, especially in VH and intestinal barrier dysfunction, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target in IBS-D.\n\nEffect of linaclotide in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C): a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAtluri, D K; Chandar, A K; Bharucha, A E; Falck-Ytter, Y\n\n2014-04-01\n\nTreatment options for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) are limited. While linaclotide improved IBS-C symptoms in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), results vary among studies and the magnitude of benefit is unclear. Two investigators independently extracted data on study participants, methods and outcomes (i.e., symptoms, quality of life, and adverse events) from eligible articles i.e., RCTs comparing linaclotide with placebo in adult patients with IBS-C with a follow-up of 12 weeks or longer. The grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. Of 182 identified citations, three RCTs enrolling 1773 patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared with placebo, fewer patients on linaclotide failed to achieve responses i.e., FDA endpoint (1604 patients, risk ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95%CI 0.76-0.85), adequate IBS symptom relief (1773 patients, RR = 0.73; 95%CI 0.65-0.82), and clinically meaningful improvement in IBS-QOL (1659 patients, RR = 0.78; 95%CI 0.72-0.86). The incidence of diarrhea leading to discontinuation of treatment was higher for linaclotide (1773 patients, RR = 14.75; 95%CI 4.04-53.81). The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for FDA endpoint and adequate relief response, high for diarrhea, and low for IBS-QOL. Generalizability may be limited by the study population (i.e., predominantly white female patients), lack of data regarding prior therapy, and availability of few RCTs. The number of patients is insufficient to identify rare adverse events. Linaclotide is moderately effective in improving symptoms of IBS-C with diarrhea being the major side effect. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of linaclotide for IBS-C.

This study determined the effect of biofeedback therapy on dyssynergic constipation in patients with or without IBS. This study was a nonrandomized, single blinded, semi experimental study. Dyssynergic defecation patients with and without IBS were asked to undergo biofeedback therapy 8 sessions. The defecation dynamics and balloon expulsion time were evaluated before, at the end and 1 month after the biofeedback therapy. IBS symptoms were graded using a 4-point Likert scale. Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon test and Friedman test were applied to analyze data using SPSS software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). After the biofeedback therapy, the IBS symptoms have been decreased significantly (the median of 2 before and 1 after therapy, P < 0.01). The biofeedback therapy significantly decreased the anismus index in IBS group by the mean of 0.75 Â± 0.31, 0.28 Â± 0.07 and 0.28 Â± 0.06 in three phases, respectively. Similar results were found in non-IBS patients (the mean of 0.74 Â± 0.32, 0.28 Â± 0.08, 0.27 Â± 0.08 in three phases, respectively). The symptoms of constipation (sensation of incomplete evacuation, difficult and painful defecation), defecation facilitative manual maneuver frequency, pelvic floor muscles resting amplitude and strain amplitude decreased and squeezing amplitude improved significantly after biofeedback therapy in both groups with and without IBS (P < 0.001). There were not significant differences between patients with and without IBS (P > 0.05) with respect to outcome. No complication was observed in treatment groups. Dyssynergic constipation patients with and without IBS will likely benefit from biofeedback therapy.\n\nThe effect of biofeedback therapy on dyssynergic constipation in patients with or without Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhadi, Tannaz; Madjlesi, Faezeh; Mahjoubi, Bahar; Mirzaei, Rezvan; Forogh, Bijan; Daliri, Seyedeh Somayeh; Derakhshandeh, Seyed Majid; Behbahani, Roxana Bazaz; Raissi, G.
