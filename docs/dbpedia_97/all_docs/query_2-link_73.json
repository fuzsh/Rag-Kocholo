This document summarizes the theory of ecclesiastical policy held by Catholicism during the late 16th century. It asserts that Catholicism did not inherently favor any particular form of government, but rather supported whichever authorities and powers helped further its influence. While Catholicism allied with monarchies in some places, it also found support among populaces and aided rebellions against legitimate rulers when it suited its purposes. The religious principle itself has no inherent preference for any single form of government.",
