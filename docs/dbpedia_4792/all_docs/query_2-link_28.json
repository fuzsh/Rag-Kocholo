        "text": "# Nmap Changelog ($Id$); -*-text-*-\n\no Added the x11-access.nse script that checks if access to an X11\n\nserver is allowed (as with \"xhost +\" for example). The script was\n\nwritten by jlanthea.\n\no Added explicit casts to (int)(unsigned char) for arguments to ctype function\n\ncalls in nmap, ncat and nbase. Thanks to Solar Designer for pointing out\n\nthe need and fix for this. [Josh]\n\no [Ncat, Ndiff] The exit codes of these programs now reflect whether\n\nthey succeeeded. For Ncat, 0 means the connection was successful, 1\n\nindicates a network error, and 2 indicates any other error. For\n\nNdiff, 0 means the scans were equal, 1 means they were different,\n\nand 2 indicates a runtime error. [David]\n\no [Ncat] Now Ncat supports wildcard SSL certificates too.Wildcard character(*) can\n\nbe in commonname field or in DNS field of Subject Alternative Name(SAN)\n\nExtension of SSL certificate.\n\nWildcard Matching Rules:\n\n-'*' should be only on the leftmost component of FQDN.(*.example.com but not www.*.com or www.example*.com).\n\n-The leftmost component should contain only '*' and it should be followed by '.'(*.example.com but not *w.example.com or w*.example.com).\n\n-There should be atleast three components in FQDN.(*.exmaple.com but not *.com or *.com.).[venkat]\n\no Nmap now handles the case when a primary network interface (venet0)\n\ndoes not have an address assigned but its aliases do (venet0:1\n\netc.). This could result in the error messages\n\nFailed to find device venet0 which was referenced in /proc/net/route\n\nFailed to lookup subnet/netmask for device (venet0): venet0: no IPv4 address assigned\n\nThis was observed particularly under OpenVZ. [Dmitry Levin]\n\no [Ncat] The --ssl-cert, --ssl-key, and --ssl-trustfile options now\n\nautomatically turn on SSL mode. Previously they were ignored if\n\n--ssl was not also used. [David]\n\no [Nsock] Now Nsock supports pure TLSv1 and SSLv3 servers too.\n\nNsock uses SSLv23 method which sends SSLv2 hello message and can be understood\n\nonly by SSLv23 or SSLv2 servers but not by pure SSLv3 and TLSv1 servers.\n\nIntialising ssl connection with nsp_ssl_init_max_speed() in which SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2\n\noption is not set causes the \"wrong version number\" when tried to connect a\n\npure SSLv3 or TLSv1 servers.So with this change Nsock reconnects to the server by\n\nsetting SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 option when a initial connection with no SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 set is failed.\n\nAt present Ncat never uses SSLv2(which is intialized by nsp_ssl_init() instead of nsp_ssl_init_max_speed())\n\nfor security reasons so it is not affected by this change.\n\nThis behaviour was found in Ncat's SSL and Nmap's SSL version detection probes and has been\n\nreported here:\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0319.html\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0702.html\n\nMore discussion on this here:\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0330.html\n\no [Nsock] [Ncat] Implemented SSL over SCTP connections in client mode.\n\nSCTP support is now fully SSL enabled. [Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [Ncat] Implemented support for SCTP listening sockets, including SSL\n\nsupport. Since there is no SSL support for SCTP client sockets yet,\n\nSSL support is not terribly useful yet. [Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [Nsock] [Ncat] Implemented basic SCTP client functionality. Only the\n\ndefault SCTP stream is used. This is also called TCP compatible mode.\n\nWhile it allows Ncat to be used for manually probing open SCTP ports,\n\nmore complicated services making use of multiple streams or depending\n\non specific message boundaries cannot be talked to successfully.\n\n[Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [Zenmap] Merged the changes in the zenmap-filter branch to the main zenmap\n\nbranch. Pressing Ctrl+L now brings up the filter interface for filtering out\n\nuninteresting hosts. Alternatively, the interface is accessible via the\n\n'Filter Hosts' button. [Josh]\n\no [Ncat]In verbose mode Ncat prints In and OUT traffic in bytes once the client connection\n\nis terminated,in this way \"Finished. 29 bytes sent, 24 bytes received.\"\n\nFor this few lines of code has been added to Nsock\n\nso that other nsock dependent applications also can use this traffic count.[Venkat].\n\no The ARP host discovery scan now filters ARP packets based on their\n\ntarget address address field, not the destination address in the\n\nenclosing ethernet frame. Some operating systems, including Windows\n\n7 and Solaris 10, are known to at least sometimes send their ARP\n\nreplies to the broadcast address and Nmap wouldn't notice them. The\n\nsymptom of this was that root scans wouldn't work (\"Host seems\n\ndown\") but non-root scans would work. Thanks to Mike Calmus and\n\nVijay Sankar for reporting the problem, and Marcus Haebler for\n\nsuggesting the fix.\n\no The -fno-strict-aliasing option is now used unconditionally when\n\nusing GCC. It was already this way, in effect, because a test\n\nagainst the GCC version number was reversed: <= 4 rather than >= 4.\n\nSolar Designer reported the problem.\n\no Nmap now prints a warning instead of a fatal error when the hardware\n\naddress of an interface can't be found. This is the case for\n\nFireWire interfaces, which have a hardware address format not\n\nsupported by libdnet. Thanks to Julian Berdych for the bug report.\n\n[David]\n\no Added the pjl-ready-message.nse script from Aaron Leininger. This\n\nscript allows viewing and setting the message displayed by printers\n\nthat support the Printer Job Language.\n\no The Ndiff man page was expanded with examples and sample output.\n\n[David]\n\no Made RPC grinding work from service detection again by changing the\n\nlooked-for service name from \"rpc\" to \"rpcbind\", the name it has in\n\nnmap-service-probes. [David]\n\no Fixed a log_write call and a pfatal call to use a syntax which is\n\nsafer from format strings bugs. This allows Nmap to build with the\n\ngcc -Wformat -Werror=format-security options. [Guillaume Rousse,\n\nDmitry Levin]\n\no [Ndiff] Ndiff now shows changes in script output. [David]\n\no A bug in Nsock was fixed: On systems where a nonblocking connect\n\ncould succeed immediately, connections that were requested to be\n\ntunnelled through SSL would actually be plain text. This could be\n\nverified with an Ncat client and server running on localhost. This\n\nwas observed to happen with localhost connections on FreeBSD 7.2.\n\nNon-localhost connections were likely not affected. The bug was\n\nreported by Daniel Roethlisberger. [David]\n\no [NSE] Scripts that are listed by name with the --script option now\n\nhave their verbosity level automatically increased by one. Many\n\nwill print negative results (\"no infection found\") at a higher\n\nverbosity level. The idea is that if you ask for a script\n\nspecifically, you are more interested in such results.\n\n[David, Patrick]\n\no [Ncat]Ncat proxy now hides the proxy's response\n\n(\"HTTP/1.0 200 OK\" or whatever it may be). Before, if you\n\nretrieved a file through a proxy, it would have the \"HTTP/1.0 200 OK\"\n\nstuck to the top of it. For this Ncat uses blocking sockets\n\nuntill the proxy negotiation is done and once it\n\nis successfull, Nsock takes over for rest of the connection.[Venkat]\n\no [Ncat] Fixed an error that would cause Ncat to use 100% CPU in\n\nbroker mode after a client disconnected or a read error happened.\n\n[Kris, David]\n\no [Ncat] Ncat now prints a message like \"Connection refused.\" by\n\ndefault when a socket error occurs. This used to require -v, but\n\nprinting no message at all could make a failed connection look like\n\nsuccess in a case like\n\nncat remote < short-file\n\no [Ncat] Using --send-only in conjunction with the plain listen or broker modes\n\nnow behaves as it should: nothing will be read from the network end. Ncat\n\nwas simply discarding any data received. [Kris]\n\no [Ncat] Added additional test cases to the ncat/test/test-cmdline-split program\n\nand rewrote the cmdline_split function in ncat_posix.c [Josh Marlow]\n\no [Ncat] The --broker option now automatically implies --listen. [David]\n\no Added Apache JServe protocol version detection probe and signature\n\nfrom Tom Sellers. He submitted some other version detection patches\n\nas well.\n\no Added a test program, test/test-cmdline-split to test the cmdline_split\n\nfunction in test/test-cmdline-split in preparation for an eventual rewrite of\n\ncmdline_split [Josh Marlow].\n\no For some UDP ports, Nmap will now send a protocol-specific payload\n\nthat is more likely to get a response than an empty packet is. This\n\nimproves the effectiveness of probes to those ports for host\n\ndiscovery, and also makes an open port more likely to be classified\n\nopen rather than open|filtered. The ports and payloads are defined\n\nin payload.cc. [David]\n\no Fixed two memory leaks in ncat_posix.c and a bug where an open file was not\n\nbeing closed in libdnet-stripped/src/intf.c [Josh Marlow]\n\no Added a convenience top-level BSD makefile redirecting BSD make\n\nto GNU make on BSD systems. This should help prevent bogus\n\nerror reports when users run \"make\" instead of \"gmake\" on BSD\n\nsystems. [Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [Zenmap] Added support to zenmap for the SCTP options: -PY, -sY and -sZ, as\n\nwell as making a comment in zenmapCore/NmapOptions.py on how to add new\n\noptions. [Josh Marlow]\n\no The configure script now allows cross-compiling by assuming that\n\nlibpcap is recent enough. Previously it would quit because a test\n\nprogram could not be run. libpcap will always be recent enough when\n\nthe included copy is used. The patch was contributed by Mike\n\nFrysinger.\n\no Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)\n\ngeneration. [Kris]\n\nNmap 5.00 [2009-07-16]\n\no Bumped up version number to 5.00!\n\no [NSE] http-open-proxy script fixed to avoid false positives from bad\n\npattern matching and to properly declare some formerly-global\n\nvariables as local. [Joao]\n\nNmap 4.90RC1 [2009-06-25]\n\no [Zenmap] Fixed a display hanging problem on Mac OS X reported by\n\nChristopher Caldwell at\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0721.html. This was done by\n\nadding gtk2 back to macports-1.8.0-universal.diff and removing the\n\ndependency on shared-mime-info so it doesn't expect /usr/share/mime\n\nfiles at runtime. Also included GDK pixbuf loaders statically rather\n\nthan as external loadable modules. [David]\n\no Fixed a memory bug (access of freed memory) when loading exclude\n\ntargets with --exclude. This was reported to occasionally cause a\n\ncrash. Will Cladek reported the bug and contributed an initial\n\npatch. [David]\n\no Zenmap application icons were regenerated using the newer SVG\n\nrepresentation of the Nmap eye. [David]\n\nNmap 4.85BETA10 [2009-06-12]\n\no The host discovery (ping probe) defaults have been enhanced to\n\ninclude twice as many probes. The default is now \"-PE -PS443 -PA80\n\n-PP\". In exhaustive testing of 90 different probes, this emerged as\n\nthe best four-probe combination, finding 14% more Internet hosts\n\nthan the previous default, \"-PE -PA80\". The default for non-root\n\nusers is -PS80,443, replacing the previous default of -PS80. In\n\naddition, ping probes are now sent in order of effectiveness (-PE\n\nfirst) so that less effective probes may not have to be sent. ARP\n\nping is still the default on local ethernet networks. [David,\n\nFyodor]\n\no Added SCTP port scanning support to Nmap. SCTP is a layer 4 protocol\n\nused mostly for telephony related applications. This brings the\n\nfollowing new features:\n\no SCTP INIT chunk port scan (-sY): open ports return an INIT-ACK\n\nchunk, closed ones an ABORT chunk. This is the SCTP equivalent\n\nof a TCP SYN stealth scan.\n\no SCTP COOKIE-ECHO chunk port scan (-sZ): open ports are silent,\n\nclosed ports return an ABORT chunk.\n\no SCTP INIT chunk ping probes (-PY): host discovery using SCTP\n\nINIT chunk packets.\n\no SCTP-specific IP protocol scan (-sO -p sctp).\n\no SCTP-specific traceroute support (--traceroute).\n\no The ability to use the deprecated Adler32 algorithm as specified\n\nin RFC 2960 instead of CRC32C from RFC 4960 (--adler32).\n\no 42 well-known SCTP ports were added to the nmap-services file.\n\no The server scanme.csnc.ch has been set up for your SCTP scan\n\ntesting pleasure. But note that SCTP doesn't pass through most\n\nNAT devices. See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0669.html.\n\nPart of the work on SCTP support was kindly sponsored by\n\nCompass Security AG, Switzerland. [Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [NSE] Added http-iis-webdav-vuln.nse, which detects the recently\n\ndiscovered WebDAV unicode bug in MS IIS 5.1/6.0 web server which can\n\nallow arbitrary users to access password protected folders without\n\nauthentication. See\n\nhttp://nmap.org/svn/scripts/http-iis-webdav-vuln.nse. [Ron]\n\no The Nmap Reference Guide has been translated to German by Open\n\nSource Press and Indonesian by Tedi Heriyanto. You can now read it\n\nin 16 languages at http://nmap.org/docs.html. We're always looking\n\nfor more translations of Nmap and it's documentation--if you'd like\n\nto help, see http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0667.html.\n\no Open Source Press completed and released the German translation of\n\nthe official Nmap book (Nmap Network Scanning). Learn more at\n\nhttp://nmap.org/book/#translations.\n\no [NSE] Added socks-open-proxy.nse for scanning networks for open\n\nSOCKS proxy servers. See\n\nhttp://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/socks-open-proxy.html. [Joao Correa]\n\no [NSE] http-open-proxy.nse has been updated to attempt HEAD and\n\nCONNECT methods as well as previously supported GET method. It\n\nstill tries to reach http://www.google.com through the proxy by\n\ndefault, but now also offers an argument for specifying a different\n\nURL. [Joao Correa]\n\no [Ncat] There is a backwards-incompatible change in the way that\n\nlisten mode works. The new default behavior is to accept only one\n\nconnection, and quit when the connection ends. This was necessary to\n\nprevent data loss in some situations; some programs require Ncat to\n\nsend an EOF before they flush their internal buffers and finish\n\nprocessing the last bit of data. See\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0528.html for more information.\n\nUse the new -k or --keep-open option to get the old behavior, in\n\nwhich Ncat will accept multiple simultaneous connection, combine all\n\ntheir input, and accept more connections after a disconnection.\n\n[Daniel Roethlisberger, David]\n\no Ncat handling of newlines on Windows has been improved. CRLF is\n\nautomatically converted to a bare LF when input is from the console,\n\nbut left untouched when it is from a pipe or a file. No newline\n\ntranslation is done on output (where it was being done before). This\n\nmakes it possible to transfer binary files with Ncat on Windows\n\nwithout any corruption, while still being able to interactively ncat\n\ninto UNIX shells and other processes which require bare\n\nnewlines. Ncat clients now work the same way on UNIX and Windows in\n\nthat respect. For cases where you do want \\r\\n line endings (such\n\nas connections to web and email servers or Windows cmd.exe shells),\n\nspecify -C whether your client is running on UNIX or\n\nWindows. [David]\n\no Nmap RPM packages (x86 and x86-64) are now built with OpenSSL\n\nsupport (statically linked in to avoid dependencies). They are also\n\nnow built on CentOS 5.3 for compatibility with RHEL, Fedora, and\n\nother distributions. Please let us know if you discover any\n\ncompatibility problems (or other issues) with the new RPMs. [Fyodor]\n\no [Zenmap] The Topology tab now has a \"Save Graphic\" button that\n\nallows saving the current topology display as a PNG, postscript,\n\nPDF, and SVG image. [Joao Medeiros, David]\n\no Changed the default UDP ping (-PU) port from 31338 to 40125. This\n\nappears to be a better port based on David's empirical testing.\n\no [NSE] Added the imap-capabilities script, which uses the CAPABILITY\n\ncommand to determine the capabilities of a target IMAP mail server.\n\nA simple supporting IMAP library was added as well. See\n\nhttp://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/imap-capabilities.html. [Brandon]\n\no [NSE] Brandon Enright from UCSD reports that, thanks to all the NSE\n\nfixes in this release, he no longer sees any Nmap crashes in his\n\nlarge scale scans. See\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0639.html.\n\no Zenmap now works on RHEL/CentOS since it no longer requires the\n\nhashlib library (which was introduced in Python 2.5, but RHEL 5\n\nstill uses 2.4) and removing the pysqlite2 requirement (RHEL does\n\nnot offer that module). It is still desirable to have pysqlite2\n\nwhen available, since it enables Zenmap searching and database\n\nsaving features. [David]\n\no Ncat can now send SSL certificates in connect mode for client\n\nauthentication by using the --ssl-cert and --ssl-key options. The\n\nspecified certificates are only sent when requested by the\n\nserver. [Venkat]\n\no Nmap can now handle -PS and -PA at the same time when running nmap\n\nas non-root or using IPv6. It now combines the two port lists [Josh\n\nMarlow]\n\no [Ncat] SSL in listen mode now works on systems like BSD in which a\n\nsocket inherits its blocking or non-blocking status from the\n\nlistening socket. [David, Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no The --packet-trace/--version-trace options now shows the names of\n\nversion detection probes as they are sent, making the version\n\ndetection process easier to understand and debug. [Tom Sellers]\n\no The GPG detached signatures for Nmap releases now use the more\n\nstandard .asc extension rather than .gpg.txt. They can still be\n\nfound at http://nmap.org/dist/sigs/ and the .gpg.txt versions for\n\nprevious releases are still available for compatibility reasons. For\n\ninstructions on verifying Nmap package integrity, see\n\nhttp://nmap.org/book/install.html#inst-integrity. [Fyodor]\n\no [Zenmap] Fixed two bugs: 1) When two scans are performed in Zenmap\n\nand aggregated, the first one was being modified in the process,\n\npreventing you from doing diffs in the \"compare scans\" dialogue or\n\nproperly saving the first scan individually. 2) If you start two\n\nscans, then the faster one finishes and you cancel and remove the\n\nslower one while still in progress, much of the results from both\n\nscans are lost. [Josh Marlow]\n\no [Ncat] When connecting to an SSL service in verbose mode, Ncat now\n\nprints confirmation of the SSL connection, some certificate\n\ninformation, and a cert fingerprint. For example:\n\nSSL connection to 64.147.188.3:443. Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\nSHA-1 fingerprint: 28BE B476 2E49 7ED5 3A9B 4D79 AD1E 69A9 82DB C75A\n\no [NSE] Clean up output (generally reducing default verbosity) for the\n\np2p-conficker, smb-check-vulns, and http-iis-webdav-vuln scripts. In\n\ngeneral, we don't ask scripts to report that a host is clean unless\n\nNmap's verbosity level (-v) is at least one or two. [Ron, Fyodor]\n\no [Zenmap] Added the -PS22,25,80 option found in the Quick Traceroute\n\nprofile to some of the Intense scan profiles for improved host\n\ndiscovery. [Josh Marlow]\n\no Fixed a bug with the --defeat-rst-ratelimit option which prevented\n\nit from working properly. See this thread:\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0476.html. [Josh]\n\no [Ndiff] Avoid printing a \"Not shown:\" line if there weren't any\n\nports in the non-shown (extraports) list. [David]\n\no [Ncat] Fixed Ncat compilation with versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.7.\n\nPreviously it would fail in ncat_openssl.c with the message\n\n\"structure has no member named `it'\". The problem was reported by\n\nJaroslav Fojtik. [David]\n\no [NSE] Removed the packet.hextobin(str) and packet.bintohex(str)\n\nfunctions. They are redundant since you get the same functionality\n\nby calling bin.pack(\"H\", str) and bin.unpack(\"H\", str),\n\nrespectively. [Patrick]\n\no [NSE] Fixed the parsing of --script-args, which was only accepting\n\nalphanumeric characters and underscores in values. Now a key, value,\n\nor array value may be a sequence of any characters except '{', '}',\n\n',', '=', and all space characters. You may overcome this\n\nrestriction by using quotes (single or double) to allow all\n\ncharacters within the quotation marks. You may also use the quote\n\ndelimiter inside the sequence so long as it is escaped by a\n\nbackslash. See\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0211.html. [Patrick]\n\no [NSE] When a script ends for any reason, all of its mutexes are now\n\nunlocked. This prevents a permanent (and painful to debug) deadlock\n\nwhen a script crashes without unlocking a mutex. See\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0533.html. [Patrick]\n\no Fixed a bug wherein nmap would not display the post-scan count of\n\nraw packets sent during a SYN ping scan (-sP -PS). [Josh Marlow]\n\no Changed the ICMP ping probes to use a random non-zero ICMP id.\n\nDavid's empirical testing found that some hosts drop probes when the\n\nICMP id is 0 [Josh Marlow]\n\no [NSE] Fixed a --script argument processing bug in which Nmap would\n\nabort when an expression matches a set of scripts which were loaded\n\nby other expressions first (a simple example is \"--script\n\ndefault,DEFAULT\". [Patrick]\n\no [Zenmap] Operating system icons are now always loaded as PNGs, even on\n\nplatforms which support SVG images. That is much faster, and Zenmap\n\ncurrently never scales the images anyway. [Josh]\n\no [Ncat] The Nmap Windows uninstaller now removes the Ncat CA list\n\n(ca-bundle.crt) which has been installed since 4.85BETA9. [Jah]\n\no Optimized some Nmap version detection match lines for slightly\n\nbetter performance. See\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0328.html. [Brandon]\n\no [NSE] Upon connection failure, a socket now immediately unlocks its\n\n\"socket lock\" to allow other pending socket connections to succeed\n\nsooner. This slightly improves scan speeds by eliminating the wait\n\nfor garbage collection to free the resource. [Patrick]\n\no [NSE] Corrected a bug in nse_nsock.cc that could result in a crash\n\nfrom the use of an invalid Lua state if a thread is collected due to\n\ntimeout or other rare reasons. Essentially, the callbacks from the\n\nnsock library were returning to an already-collected Lua state. We\n\nnow maintain a reference to the Lua State Thread in the nsock\n\nuserdata environment table to prevent early collection. This is a\n\ntemporary patch for the stable release pending a more detailed\n\nreview of the NSE nsock library binding. [Patrick]\n\no [NSE] When an NSE script in the database (script.db) is requested\n\nbut not found on the filesystem, Nmap now prints a warning rather\n\nthan aborting. We accidentally shipped with such a phantom script\n\n(smb-check-vulns-2.nse) in 4.85BETA8. [Patrick]\n\no Fixed a bug where an ICMP echo, timestamp, or address mask reply\n\ncould be matched up with the wrong ICMP probe if more than one ICMP\n\nprobe type was being sent (as with the new default ping). This lead\n\nto timing calculation problems. [David]\n\no Improved the host expression parser to better handle a few cases\n\nwhere invalid target specifiers would case Nmap to scan unintended\n\nhosts. See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0319.html. [Jah]\n\no [Zenmap] Fixed a crash, introduced in 4.85BETA4, that happened when\n\nsearching scan results by date. [David]\n\nThe error message was: File \"zenmapGUI\\SearchGUI.pyo\", line 816, in\n\nset_date TypeError: argument must be sequence of length 9, not 3\n\no Patched configure.ac to detect Lua include and library files in\n\n\"lua5.1\" subdirectories of /usr/include and the like. Debian\n\napparently puts them there. We still check the likes of\n\n/usr/include/lua.h and /usr/include/lua/lua.h as well. [Jan\n\nChristoph Nordholz]\n\no Improved nsock's fselect() to be a more complete replacement for\n\nselect() on the Windows platform. In particularly, any or all of the\n\nFD sets can be null or empty descriptor sets. This fixes an error\n\n(\"nsock_loop error 10022\") which would occur when you ran ncat\n\n--send-only on Windows. [David]\n\no The --with-openssl= directive now works for specifying the SSL\n\nlocation to the nsock library. It was previously not passing the\n\nproper include file path to the compiler. [Fyodor]\n\no The --traceroute feature is now properly disabled for IPv6 ping\n\nscans (-6 -sP) since IPv6 traceroute is not currently\n\nsupported. [Jah]\n\no Fixed an assertion failure which could occur on at least SPARC Linux\n\nThe error looked like \"nsock_core.c:294: handle_connect_result:\n\nAssertion `0' failed. Aborted\". [David Fifield, Fabio Pedretti]\n\no Nmap's make install target now uses $(INSTALL) rather than cp to\n\ncopy NSE scripts and libraries to ensure that file permissions are\n\nset properly. [Fyodor]\n\no Improved the Oracle DB version detection signatures. [Tom Sellers]\n\no [NSE] Remove the old nse_macros.h header file. This involved\n\nremoving the SCRIPT_ENGINE_* status defines, moving the likes of\n\nSCRIPT_ENGINE_LUA_DIR to nse_main.h, removing the last remaining use\n\nof SCRIPT_ENGINE_TRY, and moving the FILES and DIRS defines to\n\nnse_fs.h. [Patrick]\n\no Cleaned up the libpcre build system a bit by removing Makefile.am\n\nand modifying configure.ac to prevent unnecessary removal of\n\npcre_chartables.cc in some instances. [Fyodor]\n\no Fixed a bug which would cause Nmap to sometimes miscount the number\n\nof hosts scanned and produce warnings such as \"WARNING: No targets\n\nwere specified, so 0 hosts scanned\" when --traceroute and -sP were\n\ncombined. [Jah]\n\no Changed Nmap and Ncat's configure.ac files to check in more\n\nsituations whether -ldl is required for compilation and add it where\n\nnecessary. [Fyodor]\n\no When building Nmap RPMs using the spec file, you can now pass in an\n\nopenssl argument, the contents of which are passed to ./configure's\n\n--with-openssl option. So you can pass rpmbuild an option such as\n\n--define \"openssl /usr/local/ssl\". [Fyodor]\n\no Fixed the make distclean target to avoid a failure which could occur\n\nwhen you ran it right after a make clean (it might have failed in\n\nother situations as well). [David]\n\no Updated nmap-mac-prefixes with the latest MAC address prefix data\n\nfrom http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt as of\n\n5/20/09. [Fyodor]\n\no Ncat now makes sockets blocking before handing them off to another\n\nprogram with --exec or --sh-exec. This is to resolve a failure where\n\nthe command \"ncat --exec /usr/bin/yes localhost\" would stop sending\n\nbecause yes would send data so quickly that kernel send buffers\n\ncould not keep up and socket writes would start generating EAGAIN\n\nerrors. [Venkat]\n\no Ncat now ignores SIGPIPE in listen mode. This fixes the command\n\n\"yes | ncat -l --keep-open --send-only\", which was failing after the\n\nfirst client disconnected due to a broken pipe signal when Ncat\n\nwould try to write more date before realizing that the client had\n\nclosed the connection.\n\no Version detection can now detect Ncat's --chat mode. [David]\n\nNmap 4.85BETA9 [2009-05-12]\n\no Integrated all of your 1,156 of your OS detection submissions and\n\nyour 50 corrections since January 8. Please keep them coming! The\n\nsecond generation OS detection DB has grown 14% to more than 2,000\n\nfingerprints! That is more than we ever had with the first system.\n\nThe 243 new fingerprints include Microsoft Windows 7 beta, Linux\n\n2.6.28, and much more. See\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0335.html. [David]\n\no [Ncat] A whole lot of work was done by David to improve SSL\n\nsecurity and functionality:\n\no Ncat now does certificate domain and trust validation against\n\ntrusted certificate lists if you specify --ssl-verify.\n\no [Ncat] To enable SSL certificate verification on systems whose\n\ndefault trusted certificate stores aren't easily usable by\n\nOpenSSL, we install a set of certificates extracted from Windows\n\nin the file ca-bundle.crt. The trusted contents of this file are\n\nadded to whatever default trusted certificates the operating\n\nsystem may provide. [David]\n\no Ncat now automatically generates a temporary keypair and\n\ncertificate in memory when you request it to act as an SSL server\n\nbut you don't specify your own key using --ssl-key and --ssl-cert\n\noptions. [David]\n\no [Ncat] In SSL mode, Ncat now always uses secure connections,\n\nmeaning that it uses only good ciphers and doesn't use\n\nSSLv2. Certificates can optionally be verified with the\n\n--ssl-verify and --ssl-trustfile options. Nsock provides the\n\noption of making SSL connections that prioritize either speed or\n\nsecurity; Ncat uses security while version detection and NSE\n\ncontinue to use speed. [David]\n\no [NSE] Added Boolean Operators for --script. You may now use (\"and\",\n\n\"or\", or \"not\") combined with categories, filenames, and wildcarded filenames\n\nto match a set files. Parenthetical subexpressions are allowed for\n\nprecedence too. For example, you can now run:\n\nnmap --script \"(default or safe or intrusive) and not http-*\" scanme.nmap.org\n\nFor more details, see\n\nhttp://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-args. [Patrick]\n\no [Ncat] The HTTP proxy server now works on Windows too. [David]\n\no [Zenmap] The command wizard has been removed. The profile editor has\n\nthe same capabilities with a better interface that doesn't require\n\nclicking through many screens. The profile editor now has its own\n\n\"Scan\" button that lets you run an edited command line immediately\n\nwithout saving a new profile. The profile editor now comes up\n\nshowing the current command rather than being blank. [David]\n\no [Zenmap] Added an small animated throbber which indicates that a\n\nscan is still running (similar in concept to the one on the\n\nupper-right Firefox corner which animates while a page is\n\nloading). [David]\n\no Regenerate script.db to remove references to non-existent\n\nsmb-check-vulns-2.nse. This caused the following error messages when\n\npeople used the --script=all option: \"nse_main.lua:319:\n\nsmb-check-vulns-2.nse is not a file!\" The script.db entries are now\n\nsorted again to make diffs easier to read. [David, Patrick]\n\no Fixed --script-updatedb on Windows--it was adding bogus backslashes\n\npreceding file names in the generated script.db. Reported by\n\nMichael Patrick at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0192.html,\n\nand fixed by Jah. The error message was also improved.\n\no The official Windows binaries are now compiled with MS Visual C++\n\n2008 Express Edition SP1 rather than the RTM version. We also now\n\ndistribute the matching SP1 version of the MS runtime components\n\n(vcredist_x86.exe). A number of compiler warnings were fixed\n\ntoo. [Fyodor,David]\n\no Fixed a bug in the new NSE Lua core which caused it to round\n\nfractional runlevel values to the next integer. This could cause\n\ndependency problems for the smb-* scripts and others which rely on\n\nfloating point runlevel values (e.g. that smb-brute at runlevel 0.5\n\nwill run before smb-system-info at the default runlevel of 1).\n\no The SEQ.CI OS detection test introduced in 4.85BETA4 now has some\n\nexamples in nmap-os-db and has been assigned a MatchPoints value of\n\n50. [David]\n\no [Ncat] When using --send-only, Ncat will now close the network\n\nconnection and terminate after receiving EOF on standard input.\n\nThis is useful for, say, piping a file to a remote ncat where you\n\ndon't care to wait for any response. [Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [Ncat] Fix hostname resolution on BSD systems where a recently\n\nfixed libc bug caused getaddrinfo(3) to fail unless a socket type\n\nhint is provided. Patch originally provided by Hajimu Umemoto of\n\nFreeBSD. [Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [NSE] Fixed bug in the DNS library which caused the error message\n\n\"nselib/dns.lua:54: 'for' limit must be a number\". [Jah]\n\no Fixed Solaris 10 compilation by renaming a yield structure which\n\nconflicted with a yield function declared in unistd.h on that\n\nplatform. [Pieter Bowman, Patrick]\n\no [Ncat] Minor code cleanup of Ncat memory allocation and string\n\nduplication calls. [Ithilgore]\n\no Fixed a bug which could cause -iR to only scan the first host group\n\nand then terminate prematurely. The problem related to the way\n\nhosts are counted by o.numhosts_scanned. [David]\n\no Fixed a bug in the su-to-zenmap.sh script so that, in the cases\n\nwhere it calls su, it uses the proper -c option rather than\n\n-C. [Michal Januszewski, Henry Gebhardt]\n\no Overhaul the NSE documentation \"Usage and Examples\" section and add\n\nmany more examples: http://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html [David]\n\no [NSE] Made hexify in nse_nsock.cc take an unsigned char * to work\n\naround an assertion in Visual C++ in Debug mode. The isprint,\n\nisalpha, etc. functions from ctype.h have an assertion that the\n\nvalue of the character passed in is <= 255. If you pass a character\n\nwhose value is >= 128, it is cast to an unsigned int, making it a\n\nlarge positive number and failing the assertion. This is the same\n\nthing that was reported in\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q2/0257.html, in regard to\n\nnon-ASCII characters in nmap-mac-prefixes. [David]\n\no [NSE] Fixed a segmentation fault which could occur in scripts which\n\nuse the NSE pcap library. The problem was reported by Lionel Cons\n\nand fixed by Patrick.\n\no [NSE] Port script start/finish debug messages now show the target\n\nport number as well as the host/IP. [Jah]\n\no Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)\n\ngeneration. [Kris]\n\no [NSE] Fixed http.table_argument so that user-supplied HTTP headers\n\nare now properly sent in HTTP requests. [Jah]\n\nNmap 4.85BETA8 [2009-04-21]\n\no Ncat's HTTP proxy now supports the GET, HEAD, and POST methods in\n\naddition to the CONNECT tunneling method, so it can be used as a\n\nproxy with an ordinary web browser.[David]\n\no Ncat can now run as an authenticated proxy in HTTP proxy mode. Use\n\n--proxy-auth to provide a username and password that will be required\n\nof proxy users. Only the insecure (not encrypted) Basic authentication\n\nmethod is supported. [David]\n\no Ndiff's text output has been redone to look more like Nmap output\n\nand be easier to read. See the Ndiff README file for an example. The\n\nXML output is now based on Nmap's XML output as well. Zenmap's diff\n\nviewer now shows the new output with syntax highlighting. [David]\n\no The new versions of the Conficker Internet worm ban infected systems\n\nfrom visiting Insecure.Org and Nmap.Org. We take that as a\n\ncompliment to the effectiveness of our remote Conficker scanner.\n\nThey also ban DNS substrings \"honey\" (for the Honeynet Project),\n\n\"doxpara\" (for Dan Kaminsky's site), \"tenablese\" for Tenable\n\nSecurity, \"coresecur\" for Core Security Technologies, and\n\n\"iv.cs.uni\" for those meddlesome (to the Conficker authors)\n\nresearchers at the University of Bonn. For people who can't reach\n\nnmap.org due to infection, I've mirrored this release at\n\nhttp://sectools.org/nmap/. [Fyodor]\n\no New Conficker versions eliminate the loophole we were using to\n\ndetect them with smb-check-vulns,nse, so we've added new methods\n\nwhich work with the newest variants. Here are the Conficker-related\n\nimprovements since BETA7:\n\no Added new p2p-conficker script which detects Conficker using its\n\nP2P update ports rather than MSRPC. This is based on some new\n\nresearch by Symantec. See\n\nhttp://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/p2p-conficker.html [Ron]\n\no Since new Conficker variants prevent detection by our previous\n\nMSRPC check in smb-check-vulns, we've added a new check which still\n\nworks. It involves calling netpathcanonicalize on \"\\\" rather than\n\n\"\\..\\\" and checking for a different return value. It was discovered\n\nby Felix Leder and Tillmann Werner. [Ron]\n\no Improved smb-check-vulns Conficker error message text to be more\n\nuseful. [David]\n\no smb-check-vulns now defaults to using basic login rather than\n\nextended logins as this seems to work better on some\n\nmachines. [Ron]\n\no Recommended command for a fast Conficker scan (combine into 1 line):\n\nnmap -p139,445 --script p2p-conficker,smb-os-discovery,smb-check-vulns\n\n--script-args checkconficker=1,safe=1 -T4 [target networks]\n\no Recommended command for a more comprehensive (but slower) scan:\n\nnmap --script p2p-conficker,smb-os-discovery,smb-check-vulns -p-\n\n--script-args checkall=1,safe=1 -T4 [target networks]\n\no [NSE] The Nmap Script Engine core (C++) was rewritten in Lua for\n\ncode simplicity and extensibility. See\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0090.html and\n\nhttp://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0047.html. [Patrick]\n\no [Zenmap] The \"Cancel\" button has been restored to the main screen.\n\nIt will cancel the scan that is currently being displayed. [David]\n\no Fixed an SMB library bug which could case a nil-pointer exception\n\nwhen scanning broken SMB implementations. Reported by Steve\n\nHorejsi. [Ron]\n\no [Ndiff] The setup.py installation script now suggests installing the\n\npython-dev package in a certain error situation. Previously the\n\nerror message it printed was misleading:\n\nerror: invalid Python installation: unable to open\n\n/usr/lib/python2.6/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)\n\nThe change was suggested by Aaron Leininger. [David]\n\no [Nbase] The checksum functions now have an nbase_ prefix. This\n\nshould prevent name collisions with internal but exported functions\n\nin shared libraries Nmap links against (e.g. adler32() in zlib).\n\nSuch collisions seem to confuse the runtime linker on some platforms.\n\n[Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no Fixed banner.nse to remove surrounding whitespace from banners. For\n\nexample, this avoids a superfluous carriage return and newline at the\n\nend of SSH greetings. [Patrick]\n\no Expanded and tweaked the product/version/info of service scans in an\n\nattempt to reduce the number of warnings like \"Warning: Servicescan\n\nfailed to fill info_template...\". Parts of this change include:\n\no Improved the text of the warning to be less confusing\n\no Increased the internal version info buffer to 256 chars from 128\n\no Increased the final version string length to 160 from 128 chars\n\no Changed the behavior when constructing the final version string so\n\nthat if it runs out of space, rather than dropping the output of that\n\ntemplate it truncates the template with ...\n\no Fixed the printing of unneeded spaces between templates when one of the\n\ntemplates isn't going to be printed at all.\n\n[Brandon]\n\no Improved the service scan DB to remove certain problematic regex\n\npatterns which could lead to PCRE_MATCHLIMIT errors. For example,\n\ninstances of \".*\\r\\n.*\" and \".*\\n.*\\n\" were generally collapsed to\n\n\".*\" as long as the DOTALL (/s) modifier was set. [Brandon]\n\no Changed some error() calls (which were more informational than error\n\nmessages) to use log_write() instead, and changed a few f?printf()\n\ncalls into error() or log_write(). [Brandon]\n\no [Ncat] Fixed a bug in the resolve() function which could cause Ncat\n\nto resolve names using the wrong address family (such as AF_INET\n\nrather than AF_INET6) in some rare cases. [Daniel Roethlisberger]\n\no [Zenmap] Worked around a GTK+ bug on Windows reported by Henry Nymann.\n\nIt caused a crash when opening the Hosts Viewer on a host that had OS\n\ninformation. A window appeared saying simply \"Runtime Error!\". [David]\n\no [Zenmap] Gracefully handle unrecognized port states in the hosts\n\nviewer. Apparently old versions of Nmap can return a state of\n\n\"unknown\". This prevents this crash:\n\nFile \"radialnet\\gui\\NodeNotebook.pyo\", line 107, in __init__\n\nFile \"radialnet\\gui\\NodeNotebook.pyo\", line 257, in __create_widgets\n\nKeyError: u'unknown'\n\n[David]\n\no Rewrote the debugging error message \"Found whacked packet protocol\n\n17 in get_ping_pcap_result\" because we decided that receiving a UDP\n\npacket during TCP ping scan is not egregious enough to qualify as\n\n\"whacked\". [David]\n\nNmap 4.85BETA7 [2009-04-1]\n\no Improvements to the Conficker detection script (smb-check-vulns):\n\no Reduce false negative rate. We (and all the other scanners) used\n\nto require the 0x57 return code as well as a canonicalized path\n\nstring including 0x5c450000. Tenable confirmed an infected system\n\nwhich returned a 0x00000000 path, so we now treat any hosting\n\nreturning code 0x57 as likely infected. [Ron]\n\no Add workaround for crash in older versions of OpenSSL which would\n\noccur when we received a blank authentication challenge string\n\nfrom the server. The error looked like: evp_enc.c(282): OpenSSL\n\ninternal error, assertion failed: inl > 0\". [Ron]\n\no Add helpful text for the two most common errors seen in the\n\nConficker check in smb-check-vulns.nse. So instead of saying\n\nthings like \"Error: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED\", output is like:\n\n| Conficker: Likely CLEAN; access was denied.\n\n| | If you have a login, try using --script-args=smbuser=xxx,smbpass=yyy\n\n| | (replace xxx and yyy with your username and password). Also try\n\n| |_ smbdomain=zzz if you know the domain. (Error NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED)\n\nThe other improved message is for\n\nNT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND. [David]\n\no The NSEDoc portal at http://nmap.org/nsedoc/ now provides download\n\nlinks from the script and module pages to browse or download recent versions\n\nof the code. It isn't quite as up-to-date as obtaining them from\n\nsvn directly, but may be more convenient. For an example, see\n\nhttp://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-check-vulns.html. [David, Fyodor]\n\no A copy of the Nmap public svn repository (/nmap, plus its zenmap,\n\nnsock, nbase, and ncat externals) is now available at\n\nhttp://nmap.org/svn/. We'll be updating this regularly, but it may\n\nbe slightly behind the SVN version. This is particularly useful\n\nwhen you need to link to files in the tree, since browsers generally\n\ndon't handle svn:// repository links. [Fyodor]\n\no Declare a couple msrpc.lua variables as local to avoid a potential\n\ndeadlock between smb-server-stats.nse instances. [Ron]\n\nNmap 4.85BETA6 [2009-03-31]\n\no Fixed some bugs with the Conficker detection script\n\n(smb-check-vulns) [Ron]:\n\no SMB response timeout raised to 20s from 5s to compensate for\n\nslow/overloaded systems and networks.\n\no MSRPC now only signs messages if OpenSSL is available (avoids an\n\nerror).\n\no Better error checking for MS08-067 patch\n\no Fixed forgotten endian-modifier (caused problems on big-endian\n\nsystems such as Solaris on SPARC).\n\no Host status messages (up/down) are now uniform between ping scanning\n\nand port scanning and include more information. They used to vary\n\nslightly, but now all look like\n\nHost <host> is up (Xs latency).\n\nHost <host> is down.\n\nThe new latency information is Nmap's estimate of the round trip\n\ntime. In addition, the reason for a host being up is now printed for\n\nport scans just as for ping scans, with the --reason option. [David]\n\no Version detection now has a generic match line for SSLv3 servers,\n\nwhich matches more servers than the already-existing set of specific\n\nmatch lines. The match line found 13% more SSL servers in a test.\n\nNote that Nmap will not be able to do SSL scan-through against a\n\nsmall fraction of these servers, those that are SSLv3-only or\n\nTLSv1-only, because that ability is not yet built into Nsock. There\n\nis also a new version detection probe that works against SSLv2-only\n\nservers. These have shown themselves to be very rare, so that probe\n\nis not sent by default. Kristof Boeynaems provided the patch and did\n\nthe testing.\n\no [Zenmap] A typo that led to a crash if the ndiff subprocess\n\nterminated with an error was fixed. [David] The message was\n\nFile \"zenmapGUI\\DiffCompare.pyo\", line 331, in check_ndiff_process\n\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'error_test' referenced before assignment\n\no [Zenmap] A crash was fixed:\n\nFile \"zenmapGUI\\SearchGUI.pyo\", line 582, in operator_changed\n\nKeyError: \"Syst\\xc3\\xa8me d'Exploitation\"\n\nThe text could be different, because the error was caused by\n\ntranslating a string that was also being used as an index into an\n\ninternal data structure. The string will be untranslated until that\n\npart of the code can be rewritten. [David]\n\no [Zenmap] A bug was fixed that caused a crash when doing a keyword:\n\nor target: search over hosts that had a MAC address. [David]\n\nThe crash output was\n\nFile \"zenmapCore\\SearchResult.pyo\", line 86, in match_keyword\n\nFile \"zenmapCore\\SearchResult.pyo\", line 183, in match_target\n\nTypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable\n\no Fixed a bug which prevented all comma-separated --script arguments\n\nfrom being shown in Nmap normal and XML output files where they show\n\nthe original Nmap command. [David]\n\no Fixed ping scanner's runtime statistics system so that instead of\n\nsaying \"0 undergoing Ping Scan\" it gives the actual number of hosts in\n\nthe group (e.g. 4096). [David]\n\no [Zenmap] A crash was fixed in displaying the \"Error creating the\n\nper-user configuration directory\" dialog:\n\nFile \"zenmap\", line 104, in <module>\n\nFile \"zenmapGUI\\App.pyo\", line 129, in run\n\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode bytes in position 43-45:\n\ninvalid data\n\nThe crash would only happen to users with paths containing\n\nmultibyte characters in a non-UTF-8 locale, who also had some error\n\npreventing the creation of the directory. [David]\n\nNmap 4.85BETA5 [2009-03-30]\n\no Ron (in just a few hours of furious coding) added remote detection\n\nof the Conficker worm to smb-check-vulns. It is based on new\n\nresearch by Tillmann Werner and Felix Leder. You can scan your\n\nnetwork for Conficker with a command like: nmap -PN -T4 -p139,445 -n\n\n-v --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args safe=1 [targetnetworks]\n\no Ndiff now includes service (version detection) and OS detection\n\ndifferences. [David]\n\no [Ncat] The --exec and --sh-exec options now work in UDP mode like\n\nthey do in TCP mode: the server handles multiple concurrent clients\n\nand doesn't have to be restarted after each one. Marius Sturm\n\nprovided the patch.\n\no [Ncat] The -v option (used alone) no longer floods the screen with\n\ndebugging messages. With just -v, we now only print the most\n\nimportant status messages such as \"Connected to ...\", a startup\n\nbanner, and error messages. At -vv, minor debugging messages are\n\nenabled, such as what command is being executed by --sh-exec. With\n\n-vvv you get detailed debugging messages. [David]\n\no [Ncat] Chat mode now lets other participants know when someone\n\nconnects or disconnects, and it also broadcasts a current list of\n\nparticipants at such times. [David]\n\no [Ncat] Fixed a socket handling bug which could occur when you\n\nredirect Ncat stdin, such as \"ncat -l --chat < /dev/null\". The next\n\nuser to connect would end up with file descriptor 0 (which is\n\nnormally stdin) and thus confuse Ncat. [David]\n\no [Zenmap] The \"Scan Output\" expanders in the diff window now behave\n\nmore naturally. Some strange behavior on Windows was noted by Jah.\n\n[David]\n\no The following OS detection tests are no longer included in OS\n\nfingerprints: U1.RUL, U1.TOS, IE.DLI, IE.SI, and IE.TOSI. URL, DLI,\n\nand SI were found not be helpful in distinguishing operating systems\n\nbecause they didn't vary. TOS and TOSI were disabled in 4.85BETA1\n\nbut now they are not included in prints at all. [David]\n\no The compile-time Nmap ASCII dragon is now more ferocious thanks to\n\nbetter teeth alignment. [David]\n\no Version 4.85BETA4 had a bug in the implementation of the new SEQ.CI\n\ntest that could cause a closed-port IP ID to be written into the\n\narray for the SEQ.TI test and cause erroneous results. The bug was\n\nfound and fixed by Guillaume Prigent.\n\no Nbase has grown routines for calculating Adler32 and CRC32C\n\nchecksums. This is needed for future SCTP support. [Daniel\n\nRoethlisberger]\n\no [Zenmap] Zenmap no longer shows an error message when running Nmap\n\nwith options that cause a zero-length XML file to be produced (like\n\n--iflist). [David]\n\no Fixed an off-by-one error in printableSize() which could cause Nmap\n\nto crash while reporting NSE results. Also, NmapOutputTable's memory\n\nallocation strategy was improved to conserve memory. [Brandon,\n\nPatrick]\n\no [Zenmap] We now give the --force option to setup.py for installation\n\nto ensure that it replaces all files. [David]\n\no Nmap's --packet-trace, --version-trace, and --script-trace now use\n\nan Nsock trace level of 2 rather than 5. This removes some\n\nsuperfluous lines which can flood the screen. [David]\n\no [Zenmap] Fixed a crash which could occur when loading the help URL\n\nif the path contains multibyte characters. [David]\n\no [Ncat] The version number is now matched to the Nmap release it came\n\nwith rather than always being 0.2. [David]\n\no Fixed a strtok issue between load_exclude and\n\nTargetGroup::parse_expr that caused only the first exclude on\n\na line to be loaded as well as an invalid read into free()'d\n\nmemory in load_exclude(). [Brandon, David]\n\no NSE's garbage collection system (for cleaning up sockets from\n\ncompleted threads, etc.) has been improved. [Patrick]"
