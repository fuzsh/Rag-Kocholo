        "text": "Posted July 25, 2023Updated July 25, 2023\n\nThe Ultimate Bushcraft Accessory!\n\nAccording to my experience, the ceramic necklace has proven TO be a great addition to my camping and hiking kit. The design is both functional and stylish, making it perfect for outdoor activities. The necklace is also lightweight and durable, making it easy to carry around .On the downside the cord could be a bit longer for those who prefer a looser fit. Overall, I would recommend this accessory to anyone looking to up their bushcraft game!\n\nPros\n\nLightweight and Durable\n\nCons\n\nCord could be longer.\n\nPosted June 29, 2023Updated June 29, 2023\n\nNot worth the hype on my review.\n\nThis ceramic necklace looked good enough on paper before but it was a total disappointment during our recent camping trip. The knots wouldn't stay tight, and it ended up falling off. Worse, it didn`t hold up against the harsh elements..\n\nPros\n\nNone\n\nCons\n\nNot durable enough for Sports and Outdoors."
