The i2c drivers are used by the lm-sensors package to access this data. Note that i2c drivers are available in recent versions of the linux kernel, but the drivers in this package may be more up to date. This package contains the source for the i2c kernel modules. The kernel sources must be installed to compile these modules. From Debian 3.0r0 APT http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\ni2e\n\nEnglish-Spanish translation dictionary.

See TLA. These abbreviations illustrate the considerable antipathy most hackers long felt toward the `industry leader' (see fear and loathing). What galled hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level wasn't so much that they were underpowered and overpriced (though that does count against them), but that the designs are incredibly archaic, crufty, and elephantine ... and you can't fix them -- source code is locked up tight, and programming tools are expensive, hard to find, and bletcherous to use once you've found them. For many years, before Microsoft, IBM was the company hackers loved to hate. But everything changes. In the 1980s IBM had its own troubles with Microsoft. In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company, began to release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group, and began shipping Linux systems and building ties to the Linux community. To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged as a friend of the hacker community This lexicon includes a number of entries attributed to `IBM'; these derive from some rampantly unofficial jargon lists circulated within IBM's own beleaguered hacker underground.

You have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination. In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small chunks. (They're afraid of water, for no apparent reason. Ah well. \"The Matrix\" had more plot holes than this, and it still was a hit.) You do this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools. Once 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small enough for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of more than that, you'll save on postage, thus earning you exponential amounts of Geek Cred (a.k.a. \"score\").

Icecast is almost completely Shoutcast compatible as far as we've been able to determine. WinAmp can both send encoded streams as well as stream music from icecast.

Author: Petr Kolar <Petr.Kolar@vslib.cz> From Debian 3.0r0 APT http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nid\n\nA UNIX command that identifies the user account under which it is executed, including UID, GID, groups, and associated names. Key point: This is often the first command a hacker will run on the system when the hacker breaks in remotely. The hacker will remotely compromise a service that is running under either root account, a special account setup for that service (e.g. the majordomo service runs under a user account called \"majordomo\"), or a user's account. The hacker is hoping they have achieved root access immediately. If not, the hacker will have to run a local exploit in order to elevate privileges. The other popular command hackers might execute is id. Example: Running id as root on one of my systems results in: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy) From Hacking-Lexicon http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nID\n\nIDentification From VERA http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nid\n\nprint real and effective UIDs and GIDs From whatis http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nid-utils\n\nFast, high-capacity, identifier database tool.

It is popular because it is used in PGP, but due to commercial licensing issues, it is not popular elsewhere. Controversy: IDEA is one of the few (widely-used) ciphers protected by patents; it requires a license for commercial use. PGP is no longer using IDEA as its default cipher because of this. Notes: It was developed by Xuejia Lai and James L. Massey. It uses 128-bit keys. There is no known way to break it other than brute-force. It was published in 1990. Its patents are held by the Swiss company \"Ascom-Tech AG\". Misconception: The name implies that IDEA is some sort of official standard -- it isn't. However, it is is widely used, and is an option on many standards.

As the auth name implies, it was originally intended to be used as some sort of authentication mechanism. Nowadays, it is most commonly used simply as a way of logging who does what activity. Example: When you connect to a UNIX-based mail server, it will usually attempt a reverse connection back to you on the identd port 113. Its goal is simply to log which user was attempting access to the server.

Therefore, if you need to allow an opening to a system (like a web-server), then a firewall cannot protect against intrusion attempts against this opening.

From Redhat-9-Glossary http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nIMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol) IMAP4\n\nIMAP is a popular protocol for users to retrieve e-mail from servers. It is likely supported by the mail client that you use, such as Netscape or Outlook. Key point: IMAP is important to hackers because many implementations are vulnerable to buffer overflow exploits. In particular, a popular distribution of Linux shipped with a vulnerable IMAP service that was enabled by default. Therefore, even today, security professionals frequently detect scans directed at port 143 looking for vulnerable IMAP servers. From Hacking-Lexicon http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nIMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)\n\nIMAP is gradually replacing POP as the main protocol used by email clients in communicating with email servers. Using IMAP an email client program can not only retrieve email but can also manipulate message stored on the server, without having to actually retrieve the messages. So messages can be deleted, have their status changed, multiple mail boxes can be managed, etc. IMAP is defined in RFC 2060 From Matisse http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nimapcopy\n\ncopy or move messages from an IMAP inbox to a local mailbox From whatis http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nimapd\n\nInternet Message Access Protocol server From whatis http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/index.html\n\nimaptool\n\nA tool for creating client-side image maps A simple (yet useful and free) tool for creating client-side image maps, supporting GIF and JPEG images.

The imgsizer script automates away the tedious task of creating and updating the extension HEIGHT and WIDTH parameters in HTML IMG tags. These parameters help many browsers (including Netscape) to multi-thread image loading, instead of having to load images in strict sequence in order to have each one's dimensions available so the next can be placed. This generally allows text on the remainder of the page to load much faster. The package needs either the imagemagick package or both the file and libjpeg-progs packages.

A set of PHP3 scripts that implement an IMAP based webmail system. Assuming you have an account on a server that supports IMAP, you can theoretically use an installation of IMP to check your mail from anywhere that you have web access. IMP does not require an IMAP server to be running on the machine you install it on unless you are intending to have it use the current machine for it's IMAP connections. (If you are connecting to a remote server for your mail than you don't need IMAP) IMP requires a database to be running if you want to use the extended features such as the addressbook, and preferences. It currently uses PHPLib for the database interface so as long as PHPLib supports your database of choice your good to go. This package is designed to support PostgreSQL and MySQL directly.

This wheel button acts both as a standard button (by pressing it), and a wheel, which under MS Windows may be used for scrolling windows around. This program supports the wheel scrolling operation by one of two means: 1. Some newer X servers support mapping the wheel to buttons 4 and 5, which imwheel then captures and supports, 2. Using a patched version of gpm, the normal mouse events are passed on to the X server through /dev/gpmdata (gpm's standard \"repeater\" mode), and in addition wheel events are sent to another pipe, /dev/gpmwheel. imwheel picks up these events, and translates them.

Key point: A common model used to describe security is the OSI/ISO/IEC 10181 standard. It breaks down infosec into the following areas: authentication Where people have to prove who they are. access control Where people are allowed to access computers or files. non-repudiation Making sure that both sides of a transaction cannot later deny the transaction took place. (antonym: repudiation/renounce/reject) confidentiality Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. (antonym: disclosure) integrity Making sure that things cannot be corrupted. (antonym: corruption, tampering). audits and alarms Track what is happening. availability (antonym: Denial-of-Service) accountability Making sure that people can be held responsible for their actions. (antonym: anonymity). This includes finding out who violated security policies, as well as simple things as charging departments for their use of network resources. Key point: The most common threats are: disclosure Information was leaked to an unauthorized person. integrity violation Data was altered, such as an account balance that was changed. masquerading/forgery Somebody pretends to be somebody else, or generates a message pretending to be from somebody else. denial-of-service insider attacks From people you trust. backdoors/trojans Key point: The fields of infosec and hacking are not necessarily related. This is a little confusing. Infosec is the field of assuring that information is secure. Hacking is the field of breaking rules. For example, following infosec best practices, you can validate that a server is secure, data is encrypted, and that only authenticated users can gain access. However, a hacker executing a buffer overflow exploit gains access bypassing all the security measures. Contrast: The military has a number of terms related to INFOSEC. They include: COMSEC - communications security Describes the procedures designed to secure communications from the enemy. The antonym is COMINT.

This chapter explains how init is configured and how you can make use of the different run levels. init is one of those programs that are absolutely essential to the operation of a Linux system, but that you still can mostly ignore. Usually, you only need to worry about init if you hook up serial terminals, dial-in (not dial-out) modems, or if you want to change the default run level. When the kernel has started (has been loaded into memory, has started running, and has initialized all device drivers and data structures and such), it finishes its own part of the boot process by starting a user level program, init. Thus, init is always the first process (its process number is always 1). The kernel looks for init in a few locations that have been historically used for it, but the proper location for it is /sbin/init. If the kernel can't find init, it tries to run /bin/sh, and if that also fails, the startup of the system fails. When init starts, it completes the boot process by doing a number of administrative tasks, such as checking filesystems, cleaning up /tmp, starting various services, and starting a getty for each terminal and virtual console where users should be able to log in. After the system is properly up, init restarts getty for each terminal after a user has logged out (so that the next user can log in). init also adopts orphan processes: when a process starts a child process and dies before its child, the child immediately becomes a child of init. This is important for various technical reasons, but it is good to know it, since it makes it easier to understand process lists and process tree graphs. init itself is not allowed to die. You can't kill init even with SIGKILL. There are a few variants of init available. Most Linux distributions use sysvinit (written by Miquel van Smoorenburg), which is based on the System V init design. The BSD versions of Unix have a different init. The primary difference is run levels: System V has them, BSD doesn't.
