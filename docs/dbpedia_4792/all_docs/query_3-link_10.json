Until this day, I have never tried a Nexland product. I really don't buy a lot of networking gear, and when I do, it's usually always Linksys or Dlink, for some unknown reason.. The Nexland product that I am reviewing today, is called the ISB Pro800 Turbo. The most appealing feature of the ISB Pro800 Turbo, is that it can load balance two DSL, Cable or T1 connections. It will even load balance mixed connections, like one DSL connection and one Cable connection. Another very cool feature is if one connection goes down the ISB Pro800 Turbo will route all traffic to the good line, automatically. I will be testing all of these features plus more, later on in the review.\n\nFeatures\n\n2 Modem Ports that Load Balance 2 Broadband Connections\n\nGet Amazing Performance for the Price of Another Connection\n\nFor Businesses with Heavy Traffic Loads\n\nDouble Redundant Connection Backup\n\nNAPT Firewall to Protect your Computers\n\nHigh Speed 8-Port 10/100 Switch with Duplex (200Mb)\n\nAnalog / ISDN Backup 230k Serial Port for Truly \"Always On\"\n\nOver 8MB Bi-Directional Throughput for Blazing Speed\n\nSupports up to 253 Computers\n\nUnlimited IPsec Tunnels Passing-Through (Patent Pending Nexland)\n\nSupports PPPoE, IPsec Server Behind NAPT, SNMPv1, Full Routing\n\nSymantec RaptorMobile VPN Client & Personal Firewall (10 User)\n\nExcellent Internet application compatibility\n\nSolid Reliability of Nexland Technology... No Freezes!\n\nCAT5 Cable Included ($15 value) + Null Modem Serial Cable\n\n5 Year Warranty & 30-Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nSpecifications\n\nWeight 3 lbs\n\nDimensions 10 7/8\"(W) x 1 5/16\"(H) x 5 11/16\"(D)\n\nNetwork Ports\n\nPort Type: 10/100BASE-TX (RJ-45) - 8\n\nWAN ports: 10BASE-T (RJ-45) - 2\n\nBackup/Console Ports: RS232 Serial Port with 230Kbps Throughput - 1\n\nThe hardware\n\nIn the box you will find the following:\n\nThick Manual\n\nSerial Cable\n\nCat5 patch cable\n\nThe ISB Pro800 Turbo\n\nCD\n\nPower Adapter\n\nThis is my setup, all connected. On bottom we have two Speed Touch Home Ethernet DSL modems connecting to the ISB Pro800 Turbo, on top.\n\nStarting from the left side of the router we have, the two WAN ports, which connected to the two DSL modems. As for the LED lights from left to right we have, the power LED, error LED, LAN/WAN transmit LED, backup active LED, and finally the link LED which will tell you if your link to your modem is working.\n\nNext to those set of LEDs we have 8 LAN ports. For the price of this router, you would think it would have came with 16 ports. I guess Nexland wanted to keep it small?\n\nOn the other end of the router there are a total of 24 LAN link LEDs. These LEDs tell us if a link is good or bad from a computer on the LAN to the router. If the top LED is lit, that means your connection is running at 100MB. The middle LED means your connection is running at 10MB. The LED on the bottom is the Duplex LED does a couple of things. One of the things it does, is tells us that your Ethernet card supports Duplex. If your card supports Duplex and it is enabled, the LED will be lit, and this gives you up to 200MB throughput on the network! If the Duplex LED is flashing this means their has been a collision on your network. This happens when packets are dropped for some reason or the packets have been misdirected. This usually only happens when two computers are using the same IP address and this usually only happens when you specify an IP address rather than using the DHCP feature built in the router.\n\nNow if we have a look at the back of the router we are sure to find a reset button or switch. If you have any problems out of the router, like if it locks up or your Internet connection seizes to exist and you know your Internet isn't down, then you may need to reset or \"reboot\" the router. By pushing the reset button, you will NOT loose any of your saved configurations in the router. You will also notice the power switch in the back. I'm glad to see this, all of the routers I have had in the past didn't even have a power switch!\n\nOn the other side in the back, you will see a serial connection and some dip switches. The dip switches are used for disabling the DHCP server, resetting the router (this wipes the password and ALL configurations), activating serial console interface, and to configure the router for firmware upgrades. The serial port is something you don't find on a cheap router. This serial port, or sometimes called RS232 port, is used to connect an ISDN or analog connection to use with the router's automatic backup feature. I will talk more about this automatic backup feature, later on in the review. This port is also for connecting a null modem cable (that was included) to configure the unit with a program like hyper term.\n\nRelated Products"
