        "text": "The RX1 components.\n\n–\n\nThe last 24 hours were very busy on the rumor front. I got many messages from different anonymous sources saying that there are two new E-mount Full Frame cameras to come in mid October. One model is a cheap and another one is a more expensive model. I have bene told that both do have a fixed EVF. And two of them also told me that the cameras are not branded as a NEX-9 series. And there may be a surprise too because there could be one substantial design change compared to the NEX-7.\n\nI am working on the specs yet and hope more sources can share details soon. Use the anonymous contact form you see on the right border of the browser or contact me at sonyalpharumors@gmail.com if you can share more details.\n\n—\n\nMessage to sources: You can send me more info anonymously by using the contact form you see on the very right of your browser.
