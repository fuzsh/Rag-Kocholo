        "text": "….Drummers have a big responsibility to be happy…..\n\n-Albert “Tootie” Heath\n\nDrummer Albert “Tootie” Heath, who died on April 4th, was one of the greatest jazz drummers of all time; I touched on what made him so great here.\n\nI’ll treasure the nights listening to him at the Vanguard with his brother tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath, or in the trio he led with Ethan Iverson and Ben Street. But there’s so much more where that came from.\n\nThis is my second article on him in the wake of his passing. Here, I’m Chronicling my trip further down a Tootie rabbit hole. As I suspected, there are treasures:\n\nSonny Rollins, “Four”, recorded September 6, 1968, Cafe Montmartre, Copenhagen Denmark.\n\nRollins was in Europe for much of the fall of 1968. Part of that tour was a visit to the legendary Copenhagen jazz club, where he played with the house rhythm section of pianist Kenny Drew, bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, and Albert “Tootie” Heath.\n\nTwo sets were recorded. It’s all invaluable music, but the standout is a 45-minute version of “Four”. (Full disclosure— I heard this in my twenties but didn’t realize until years later that it was Tootie on drums; it wasn’t until this week I learned that it was recorded at Cafe Montmartre.) This “Four” is one of the great performances in jazz, made possible by Tootie Heath.\n\nDrew and Pedersen sound great of course, but “Four” is all about Sonny with Tootie. Heath’s genius here is that he never peaks, never boils over, never explodes, neither does he come down, get creative, and build back up. He’s just a straight line of intensity and invention, not encroaching onto Sonny’s turf, yet able to match Rollins’ stamina and spontaneity.\n\nOn the surface, Heath is playing straight-ahead jazz drums— time on the ride cymbal and accents on the bass and snare. But the colossal length of “Four” complicates matters, and exposes what made Heath so special. Only a sensitive, empathetic, imaginative drummer, with an open mind and heart, and complete technical mastery, could light a fire hot enough to sustain Sonny and the band for so long.\n\nTootie is selflessly supporting Rollins’s journey to the outer limits, while also rising to Sonny’s challenge of endurance and invention. It’s just chorus after chorus of relentless forward motion— behind Sonny, Kenny Drew, NHOP, and then trading fours— that somehow never becomes dull or repetitive; it’s just little peaks, tiny valleys, up and down the incline, for 45 minutes. This is what jazz drumming is all about.\n\nI hope “Four” and the rest of the ‘68 Montmartre tapes sees official release from the Rollins estate someday. This is extraordinary stuff. I’m listening to “Four” as I write this in Berlin after a typical no-sleep overseas flight; Sonny and Tootie are so strong I feel ready to run a 15K.\n\nYusef Lateef: “Nubian Lady” from The Gentle Giant (Atlantic, recorded 1972).\n\nTootie was a member of Lateef’s quartet, which also featured Kenny Barron and bassist Bob Cunningham, from 1972 to 1975. This track stands out for Tootie’s infectious beat, sixteenths on the hi hat with his right hand on a kit perfectly tuned for backbeat music. I’m sure hip-hop producers have made use of this track for decades.\n\nAlbert Heath: Kwanza (The First) (Muse, New York, June 4, 1973)\n\nTootie’s found a way for the backbeat, open improvisation, and bebop wisdom to coexist. And, Tootie’s a composer— all but two of the six tunes on Kwanza are Tootie compositions! I didn’t know this, I’d never heard any of these songs. I am learning.\n\nBoth Jimmy and Percy Heath are on Kwanza, and it’s striking to hear how easily they get with Tootie’s disparate styles. Tootie’s own “Tafadhali” is some infectious soul music, while “Dr. JEH” features an unconventional form, some bars of 3/4, and Heath in his high-modernist zone.\n\nClifford Jordan: Half Note (Steeplechase, New York, April 5, 1974). Clifford Jordan, Cedar Walton, Sam Jones, Tootie.\n\nA lo-fi, high-content gig at the Half Note, with some explosive Tootie; his intros and solos on “St. Thomas” and “Rhythm-A-Ning”suggest Ralph Peterson, Jeff “Tain” Watts, and Tony Williams. Heath puts the right amount of spin and intensity on the beat on Walton’s “Holy Land” and Jordan’s “Glass Bead Game”. Interesting to hear Tootie in what was clearly Billy Higgins’s chair. Comparatively, Tootie’s beat and sound were just a smidge heavier and thicker.\n\nDexter Gordon: The Apartment (Steeplechase, recorded in Copenhagen, Denmark, May 24 1974). Dexter, Kenny Drew, piano; NHOP, bass; Tootie.\n\nEvery phrase Dexter Gordon played is infused with soul, intelligence, and good humor. If the rhythm section behind Dexter is fully synced, they can create endless variety on the most basic material. Hence, The Apartment, what must be the best bebop album of 1974.\n\nTootie, on a thuddy studio kit tuned for backbeat music, weaves a perfect modern jazz tapestry on “The Apartment”, swings out elegantly on Horace Silver’s “Strollin”, and veers close to Tony Williams on “Stablemates”, at times playing four quarter notes on the hi hat. Dexter’s inspired, the old Cafe Montmartre trio is back together. This is a great record.\n\nThe Heath Brothers: Marchin’ On (Strata-East, recorded October 1975)\n\nThe first release credited to the Heath Brothers is ECM-adjacent— it was engineered by ECM’s Jan Erik Kongshaug, recorded in Oslo, and seems of a piece with other early ECM classics like Bennie Maupin’s The Jewel In The Lotus and Marion Brown’s Afternoon Of A Georgia Faun.\n\nLike those records, Marchin’ On is astonishing in its breadth and scope— Ellingtonia, flute choirs, African instruments, backbeats and bebop. It’s all here. It’s streaming on YouTube, but we badly need a Strata-East reissue program.\n\nEllington’s “Warm Valley” is played by a quartet of Jimmy on flute, Percy on bowed bass, Stanley Cowell on kalimba, and Tootie playing the melody on flute! Tootie’s own “Tafadhali” (also heard on Kwanza) keeps the flute duo of Tootie and Jimmy, while “The Watergate Blues” features Percy on an acoustic baby bass, sounding an awful lot like an acoustic guitar; there’s a real back-porch flavor to this. Jazz is folk music after all.\n\nSide 2 is devoted to the “Smilin Billy” suite composed by Jimmy, with backbeat, vamps, a brief free drum solo, and at 30:25, Tootie featured on an ‘African double reed instrument’ (as per the album liners) that sounds like Dewey Redman’s musette."
