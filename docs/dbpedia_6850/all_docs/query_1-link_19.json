        "text": "One of the prominent tenor sax to emerge from the free era, Archie Shepp began his career with another known (young) extremist of the time, Cecil Taylor, featuring on the remarquable Candid sessions.\n\nCrossing Coltrane's road, featuring with Roswell Rudd and a number of other free cats, Shepp took a turn in the early 70's, both musically - mixing R&B and soul statements in his free wine - and politically, with the radical Attica Blues.\n\nShepp then continued his unique road, both old and new things, explored african music, teached, and although his play declined in the 90's, remains one true free jazz saxophone legend."
