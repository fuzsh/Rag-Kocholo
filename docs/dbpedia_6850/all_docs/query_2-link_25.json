        "text": "Swedish guitarist Alf Carlsson has quickly established himself as one of the most sought after and versatile players in his home country. Having received the Albin Hagström award in 2013 for young promising guitarists on the popular music scene, a year later he composed music for the Nobel Peace winner Malala Yousafzai exhibition in Stockholm. He has been freelancing non stop on the Swedish jazz and pop scene since his graduation at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm in 2016 and has been recording and touring with the international collaboration “Alf Carlsson/Jiří Kotača Quartet”, a jazz group that has played over 120 concerts in Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Poland, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands since 2017.\n\nCarlsson’s debut album “Lights”, incorporates a wide palette of musical styles; contemporary jazz, Swedish folk music, pop and rock, all intelligently blended into the guitarist’s own captivating style. The album’s eight tracks contain six original compositions and two inventive interpretations of traditional folk songs, “Gråtlåten” (The Crying Tune), and “Brudpolska från Rättvik” (Wedding song from Rättvik). “Lights” is a quartet recording, with the band-leader playing electric and acoustic guitars, and featuring Samuel Löfdahl on double bass, Anton Dromberg on piano, and Hannes Sigfridsson on drums.\n\nThe two opening pieces, “Gråtlåten” and “Brudpolska Från Rättvik” showcase the band’s excellent versaltility straight away. The folk-tinged melodies are superb, the first piece lively and energetic, the second more thoughtful and reflective, the guitarist sounding in his element here. “Chinook” has a great bluesy feel to it, whilst the slowly unfolding, deep grooves of “The Epiphany” could make any listener feel revitalised. Then follows two tracks that share their titles with two Pat Metheny compositions… which I found somewhat confusing due to the fact that Carlsson’s writing and playing style does remind me of the multi award-winning guitarist. And so I was expecting to hear a couple of reworkings of old Metheny tunes, but actually these are two original compositions from Carlsson. “Travels” is a rocky number, a little too in-your-face for my liking, and “The Search” is an ambient piece featuring multi-layered guitars and effects. “21st Century Blues” could be a track from Metheny’s “American Garage” album, beautifully executed by this talented quartet. The closing track, “Where’s The Party At?” benefits from an easy-going feel, punchy and joyous in its exuberant hooks and melodies.\n\nAs a debut, “Lights” is a very enjoyable album and shows promise of much to come from Alf Carlsson. There are some wonderful passages of sound, with the quartet collectively working extremely well together, helping bring the guitarist’s compositions to life. As a guitarist, Carlsson is a formidable talent. It’ll be interesting to see where his journey takes him, hopefully leading him to find an even more original voice as the years goes by. At the moment, to my ears at least, his music sounds heavily influenced by the Pat Metheny Group, which is certainly no bad thing in my book, but I’m sure Carlsson’s eclectic ideas will naturally bring with them a deeper uniqueness over time.\n\nMike Gates\n\nMultiverse is the idea of parallel universes; in this case five personal, musical micro-universes that through interconnectedness and interplay create an original, multi-faceted soundscape that explores a balance between theoretical and improvised music.\n\nLed by saxophonist/clarinetist Anders Lønne Grønseth, “Inner View” is the follow-up to the band’s 2022 release “Outer View”. And whilst that album feels a little more dynamic at heart, this new recording is no less exploratory and could well be considered a companion piece, albeit in a more reflective, ambient way.\n\nThe line-up is also consistent with the previous recording, with “Inner View” being led by Grønseth on soprano, straight alto and tenor saxes, and clarinet, and featuring Hayden Powell on trumpet, Espen Berg on piano, Audun Ellingsen on bass, Einar Schieving on drums, and also David Skinner on Hohner Pianet and clavinet. Together this band take the listener on an intriguing journey, collectively communicating a musical eclecticism with interesting ideas on tonal, rhythmic and compositional structures that in the main feel natural and organic, mixing contemporary jazz with classical modernism.\n\nThe three opening pieces – ‘Biom 1 to 3’ – showcase the band’s diversity even with a suite of tunes. The first leads us gently in, the 2nd challenges, and the 3rd allows us to relax and enjoy. ‘Bidevind’ is exploratory, Berg’s piano luxuriating in its freedom, underpinned by the groove-based drums and bass. Sax and trumpet combine wonderfully towards the end of the tune. ‘Bismaksprøve’ has an almost Don Cherry/Dewey Redman feel to it, with bass, drums and piano adding texture along the way. ‘Bismaksvals’ revels in an Middle Eastern vibe, and ‘Bibringaren’ continues this theme, yet with a more gentle, folk-tinged storytelling style. The closing piece, ‘Be litt!’ meanders beautifully to its conclusion, with lovely performances from the whole band.\n\n“Inner View” is an album of conceptual possibilities, both for the band and for the listener. Everyone will find something different to take from this, and for me personally I’ve very much enjoyed delving into the original nature of its music. It compels the listener to try and identify with the unfamiliar, thankfully in a none too taxing way. Well worth checking out, the more I listen, the more it seems to give, and that’s no bad thing at all.\n\nMike Gates\n\nHaving released several solo projects, numerous collaborations and a series of LPs, EPs and singles with his band Ruby Rushton that centred on original compositions, for his latest release, “You know I care”, Tenderlonious chooses to take a moment to focus his energy on exploring the classic jazz material that has inspired him over many years. And what a revelation this album is. “You know I care” is undoubtedly one of the best jazz albums you’ll hear anywhere this year.\n\nPlayers like Jackie McLean, Duke Pearson, Clifford Jordan and Wayne Shorter have all played significant roles in Tenderlonious’ life and provide a constant source of inspiration for his development as a musician and composer. This latest release is a tribute to those musicians. It feels like a landmark album for many reasons, not least for the fact that it will hopefully aid in ensuring that a new generation of jazz listeners are reminded of some of the most significant contributors, and in some cases unsung heroes, to this ever-evolving genre.\n\n“You know I care” is an acoustic quartet recording, with pianist Hamish Balfour, bassist Pete Martin, and drummer Tim Carnegie all contributing in style alongside Tenderlonious. The band-leader plays alto sax and flute on this session, with a depth and beauty that is rarely surpassed. The tone and timbre of his alto playing is sublime. It’s spiritual, emotive, powerful, dynamic and compellingly blissful to listen to. Add to this the transcendent, ethereal nature of his flute playing and what you have is an album to enjoy with a deep sense of immersive pleasure.\n\nThe album’s opener, ‘On The Nile’, sets the tone in astonishing style. I’m left wide-eyed and open-mouthed at the sheer tenacity of this piece. It’s a bold opener for sure, immediately catching the listener’s ear with its distinctly Middle Eastern theme. The quartet maintains a full, grandiose sound from start to finish, with gutsy solos from alto saxophone and piano, building to a climatic solo from the band’s powerhouse drummer, Tim Carnegie. ‘Maimoun’ has a smoother, west coast feel to it – cool and collected. Its evocative opening leads into a mouthwatering natural groove from bassist Pete Martin, underpinning the whole arrangement. One of the best known compositions featured on the album, Wayne Shorter’s ‘Infant Eyes’, is performed here as a flute and piano duet, paying tribute to the incomparable composer in the most thoughtful and reflective way imaginable. ‘Poor Eric’ is a haunting ballad dedicated to the memory of the late Eric Dolphy. A brooding piano and melancholic saxophone melody sets the mood as brushed drums and a deep bass join softly to create a dream-like elegy, leading into an incredibly raw and emotive alto sax solo from Tenderlonious. Originally recorded by Clifford Jordan, ‘John Coltrane’ is the perfect homage to the master saxophonist. This version holds true to its original conception and intended purpose – with a joyous verve and kinetic energy flowing through the piece with unswerving dedication from all four band-members. The title track ‘You Know I Care’ is one of the most iconic jazz ballads of the 1960s. Tenderlonious’ husky alto flute perfectly encapsulates the mood, whilst bass and drums hold steady leading to a delicate and playful solo from talented pianist Hamish Balfour, captivating this listener, as indeed the whole album does.\n\nFrom brooding ballads to full-steam ahead modal delights “You know I care” is not only the perfect opportunity to enjoy a fresh take on these timeless compositions, but also a chance to hear a new recording from a jazz quartet that effortlessly manage to bring new life and energy to these classic tunes. They make them their own, and in doing so leave me happily mind-blown, hoping that there’s more to come from this incredible quartet.\n\nMike Gates\n\nRead also:\n\nTenderlonious ‘Ragas From Lahore’ LP/CD (22a Music) 4/5\n\nTenderlonious ‘Quarantena’ LP/CD (22a Music) 5/5\n\nThe dictum less is more can surely be applied to any decent organ trio and Blicher Hemmer Gadd have succeeded in stripping their music back to its essential core for their fourth album It Will Be Alright. Tightly focused on the groove infused soul of their sound and the simplicity of what they describe as the format’s honesty, they initially seem an unlikely trio. Danish saxophonist Michael Blicher met US drum legend Steve Gadd at a masterclass in Denmark back in 2012, their shared musical values saw Blicher introduce his Hammond organ playing musical collaborator Dan Hemmer to Gadd and the trio was born.\n\nSteve Gadd needs little introduction, since his first session appearance in 1968 on Gap Mangione’s widely sampled tune ‘Diana In The Autumn Wind’ he’s appeared on literally thousands of recordings: Steely Dan, Chick Corea, Paul Simon, Rickie Lee Jones and Al Di Meola to name just a handful. He cites drummers Buddy Rich, Elvin Jones and Tony Williams as influences. Gadd was perhaps mindful of William’s elemental back to basics trio Lifetime with organist Larry Young and guitarist John McLaughlin when joining Blicher and Hemmer.\n\nSaxophonist and composer Michael Blicher is a seeker of ‘universal folkloric jazz music’ and is focused on the search for its ‘inner core’; he has several other bands, Astro Buddha Ago, BMG Roadstar and Sunbörn. And if artists like Joey DeFrancesco and extended jammers Medeski Martin & Wood reignited interest in the Hammond organ in the 1990s it’s musicians of Dan Hemmer’s calibre who keep the organ relevant in the twenty-first century. His shared passion for ‘soulful music’ and a meticulous commitment to the music’s basic elements bring the Hammond to life once again. Though coming from a different musical tradition to organist Cory Henry he shares the uncanny ability to summon an almost supernatural presence from the Hammond. Incidentally, the instrument is now so frequently requested by musicians who perform at Ronnie Scott’s that the club have recently purchased their own vintage Hammond B-3 which sits proudly in their foyer between its stage appearances.\n\nI do feel like it’s going to be alright as soon as the trio get stuck into the album’s opening ‘Any Moment Now’, one of two tracks recorded in Blicher’s intimate Copenhagen garden studio, the remaining five capture the band’s live energy on various tour dates. ‘Any Moment Now’, has a vivacity and immediacy, it’s highly danceable while the slinky groove’s twists and turns are expertly sustained by Hemmer’s organ. Blicher’s animated exploration of the theme has a warm and reedy tone which gives the tune its striking vitality.\n\nA later standout track, ‘Lady Tambourine’ has a marching band theme counted in by Gadd, the tune’s a nod to charismatic gospel musician Rosalie Marie Ashton-Washington otherwise known as Lady Tambourine, famous for her tambourine performances with a rosta of musicians and at the Southern Jaguars Football Club alongside cheerleaders and the marching band. It’s the fiery energy of Gadd’s solo which is so phenomenal on this piece.\n\nThe closing ‘Snow’ is the album’s second studio session. Hemmer lays down a blanket of sound, there’s a contemplative stillness and quiet to the piece reflected in the title. As with all the tunes on the album it’s the sharply honed immediacy which is so satisfying as the trio pare the music back to its unembellished element.\n\nJames Read\n\nHaving previously released music under the mononym of “Darwish”, the multi-instrumentalist and composer, Jihad Darwish, has cultivated a strong reputation for his inspired and all-encompassing approach to music-making. Darwish’s debut album came in the form of ‘Reclamation’ in 2018 – via Two Rivers Records and featuring contributions from trumpeter Yazz Ahmed and pianist Hamish Balfour, no less – and was lauded for its uncanny fusion of jazz, electronica and pop over the course of the album’s seventeen tracks.\n\nBut such a genre-less and broad perspective has long been indicative of Darwish’s overarching musical vision. A keen musician from his youth in Hackney, the artist’s own inspirations took the form of icons ranging from Peter Gabriel to Prince and found him with an insatiable appetite for learning. Looking at the credits for ‘4 Parakeets’ alone, you’ll find Darwish’s boundless talents attributed throughout the album to guitar, sitar, piano, double bass, electric bass and drums. It’s a project that builds masterfully upon the groundwork as established on ‘Reclamation’ but with five years in between the releases, ‘4 Parakeets’ has the distinction of being able to boast even more strings to its proverbial bow.\n\nAnd one of the biggest creative leaps that ‘4 Parakeets’ can boast is its adoption of Indian compositions that form a significant part of the music’s vast make-up. A minute-long YouTube video from two years ago on Darwish’s channel, entitled ‘Sitar meets Gospel’, provides a fascinating glimpse into how he had perhaps envisioned these seemingly worlds-apart elements coming together for a full album and, even though the sitar is featured prominently throughout ‘4 Parakeets’, tracks like ‘Kafi Dadra’, ‘Kafi Drut’ and ‘Yaman Vilambit’ really accentuate these disparate musical elements fusing exquisitely together.\n\nWhat’s particularly noteworthy is how accessible the album is – you’d be forgiven, as a prospective listener, for perhaps approaching the album with an element of intimidation but the infectious nature of ‘For A Moment’ and ‘Jupiter & Saturn’ will absolutely dispel any trepidation about your ability to embrace the album. Two genuinely brilliant songs that represent the absolute best of what Darwish is striving to achieve on the album.\n\nDespite a large bulk of the album’s instrumentation coming from Darwish himself, ‘4 Parakeets’ still benefits from the contributions of some revered names including Collocutor’s own Tamar Osborn and Idris Rahman from the Soothsayers who both feature on sax and clarinet, respectively, on ‘Kafi Dadra’. Wesley Gibbons features on drums for several of the album’s tracks rekindling his long-running collaborative history with Darwish which extends to ‘Reclamation’ and even further back to Darwish’s 2016 single releases.\n\n‘4 Parakeets’ represents an inspired effort from Jihad Darwish – the album is a bold and brilliant depiction of where he is as an artist and represents a key milestone in his ongoing musical journey.\n\nImran Mirza\n\n‘Reference Point’ is a 15-track compilation album curated by Mark GV Taylor and George Arthur, who are both residents at their own Reference Point events, a nomadic music night set up to explore less well-known musical soundscapes of various genres, with music from the past to brand new current releases.\n\nThe album begins with Jeff Scott and ‘Mystery of You’, a jazzy vocal number from 1986, but sounding from much earlier, with Jeff possibly being influenced by Jon Lucien – which is never a bad thing. The next track is from Brazilian trio Caixa Cubo and the vocal fusion piece ‘Palavras’ including the additional vocals of Zé Leônidas, taken from their album ‘Angela’ from 2020. A brilliantly constructed track that taps into the vast musical heritage of 1970’s Brazilian jazz.\n\nBell Helium, a New York based group set up by producer/musician James Beaudreau and fronted by vocalist Anne DeAcetis offer ‘We Don’t Have to Talk About It’ from 2021, a luscious jazzy vocal with drums, Rhodes electric piano, electric bass and guitar working together with Anne’s warm vocal delivery and phrasing. From 1977 comes flautist and saxophonist Joe Thomas and ‘A Place in Space’, a downtempo instrumental cut with a melodic synth riff and horn heavy chorus that contains a somewhat ‘rare groove’ quality, which was even pressed on a 12” single a year later on Miami label T.K. Disco in 1978.\n\n‘Factory Rhythms’ by Australian five-piece JR Quintet from 2018, is a rich eight-minute journey into contemporary modal jazz, and a personal favourite from this compilation. Other highlights include Litto Nebbia & Los Músicos del Centro ‘Como Aprendi a Soportar Tus Inseguridades’, an Argentinian vocal fusion track, and John Standefer and Friends ‘Easter Suite’, a short soundtrack-esque instrumental piece from 1978.\n\n‘Reference Point’ jumps effortlessly around numerous musical styles and influences from soul, jazz, fusion, electronica, yacht rock and others. Curators Mark GV Taylor and George Arthur should be applauded for their diverse and broad thinking approach to crafting this collection of less familiar musical releases. Some tracks here are quite rare in their original vinyl form, but others are very cheap but just not well known, such as the Joe Thomas 12” which is available on Discogs for a couple of UK pounds. Others, are available via Bandcamp as new releases, like the Caixa Cubo and JR Quintet albums, with the latter being offered as a ‘name your price’ purchase.\n\n‘Reference Point’ is a highly recommended addition to the BBE Music catalogue of strong compilation albums.\n\nDamian Wilkes\n\nSlowly Rolling Camera’s 2021 release “Where The Streets Lead” successfully continued the band’s sublime blend of jazz/ambient soundscapes with some mouthwatering tunes to enjoy. Their latest release, “Flow” captures the same spirit as their preceding albums, but with a generally more minimalistic, laid-back feel. It’s a slow journey in some ways, but as the old phrase goes; good things come to those who wait.\n\nWritten originally for the film “River of Mirrors”, a kayak film with cinematic scope that looks beyond adrenaline and ego, this digital only release blends the band’s hallmark emotive and adventurous soundscapes with a newer, more spiritual sounding approach. For this recording the band is made up of Dave Stapleton on keyboards, Josh Arcoleo on saxophone, Stuart McCallum on guitar, Elliot Bennett on drums, and Verneri Pohjola on trumpet. And it is perhaps the inclusion of Pohjola that really helps make this album work so well. His breathy, ethereal playing is the perfect accompaniment to the band’s mesmeric, haunting compositions.\n\nThe nine tracks fit together really well. Beautifully recorded and performed, the album sounds at its best when you’ve got the time to just sit and listen without any distractions. It’s one of those recordings where you need to let yourself fall into its path of consciousness, and just ‘go with the flow’ as it were. Sometimes it’s nice to just let the music wash over you, immersed in its warmth and subtlety, and this is definitely that kind of album.\n\nAll of the tracks share a natural ambience, one that gently shifts from tune to tune without interrupting the overall mood. Swimming in an indulgent atmosphere, the waves of the music are gentle, like ripples in a pond rather than the turning of a tide. It’s that kind of melancholy where it still manages to make you feel uplifted, glad to be alive even. The stand-out is the title track. Imaginative, creative and ultimately heart-warming, it’s nothing short of a work of art. “Flow” is a lovely album, one that takes you away from it all, and even if you do know where it’s taking you, that safeness can sometimes be a blessed relief.\n\nMike Gates\n\nRead also:\n\nSlowly Rolling Camera ‘Where the Streets Lead’ LP/CD (Edition) 4/5\n\nMatt Carter is a pianist, composer, and piano teacher originally from the West of England. He commenced his studies in classical music at the tender age of 7. His brother, also a budding musician, encouraged his interest in jazz. Matt studied jazz piano at The Royal Academy of Music under Nikki Iles, Tom Cawley and Gwilym Simcock and composition with Pete Churchill. He graduated in 2021 and in a very wide and busy musical schedule found time to establish his own octet and this is that group’s debut release. Alongside Carter are musicians who are the pick of the best musicians of the latest generation. Tom Smith (tenor sax), Geroge Jefford (trumpet), Harry Greene (baritone sax), Jonny Ford (alto sax) Harry Maund (trombone) Gareth Lockrane (flute) Joe Lee (bass) and Luke Tomlinson (drums). The esteemed publication Jazzwise considered Carter’s piano playing to be “as tasteful and neatly phrased as you could wish…ultra-hip, finger clicking arrangement’.\n\nThe album consists of ten nicely varied tracks and opens with ‘Sunny Side’ and is a wonderful sixty-second opener introducing the massed forces of the octet. ‘Abode’ is next and is an infectious piece of nicely swinging music. What is most noticeable is how the musical arrangements create the impression of a much larger ensemble. ‘They Can’t Take that Away from Me’ is a 1937 song from the film Shall we Dance starring Fred Astaire and is treated to an exquisite arrangement and here I’m reminded to some degree of the crisp writing associated with the West Coast jazz school. Joe Lee provides a most assured solo of this piece and Carter’s thoughtful solo which follows is the icing on the cake. A lovely performance. Another ‘standard’ song on the album is ‘Girl Talk’ written by Neil Hefti for the 1965 film Harlow and which is given a tasteful makeover. ‘Hope Song’ is a fine, delicate theme which could almost have been written by Bill Evans. ‘Duke’s Mood’ is a finely sketched ballad and includes a nice feature for Harry Maund. ‘Like it Or Not’ is a lightly swinging up tempo piece with the melody strangely reminiscent of something that pianist John Taylor many have composed. We get assured performances from Harry Greene and Tom Smith. This is happy jazz. The concluding piece is the title track and gives Luke Tomlinson his time in the spotlight. This is reminiscent of the music of some of the great European big bands in style and yet still retains an identity of its own.\n\nThis is an auspicious debut from an octet that we are sure to hear more from in the coming months. Treat your ears to the delights of Matt Carter and his music and life will seem just that little bit more fun.\n\nAlan Musson\n\nThis British composer and pianist started playing classical piano around the age of four and together with her brother Idris, developed an interest in jazz as a teenager, eventually winning a scholarship to study jazz at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. She later developed an interest in the musical heritage of her Bengali father. Rahman made her recording debut in 2001 and has subsequently received many awards. Her second album came in 2006 and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize Album of the Year and won Jazz Album of the Year at the Parliamentary Jazz Awards 2006. Her fifth album, which was released in 2012, won the Best Jazz Act award at the 2012 MOBO Awards. The Observer newspaper has described her as “one of the finest young pianists in Europe” and “a remarkable pianist by any standard”.\n\nRahman’s latest release brings together an eight-piece band which has been described as “reflecting her deep engagement with the diversity of contemporary Britain”. In this regard, we have a truly cosmopolitan band comprising two members of the new British young generation of performers, trumpeter Alex Ridout and trombonist Rosie Turton together with flute-player Roland Sutherland, saxophonist and clarinettist Idris Rahman and bass player Alec Dankworth, all members of the 1980s jazz-resurgence. These accomplished performers are anchored by the United States native, Gene Caldarazzo at the drums. Add to this heady mix guest trumpeter Byron Wallen and simply light the blue touchpaper and step back!\n\nThe album consists of eight compositions and opens with ‘Dance of Time’ with the pianist ushering in the powerful rhythm section who are soon joined by Sutherland for the powerfully memorable theme statement. ‘For Love’ brings the horns to the fore for a majestic toe-tapping performance. Idris Rahman is particularly compelling on tenor saxophone and the tempo change immediately after his contribution is an unexpected delight. If we are looking for convenient musical reference points, I’m reminded of the poise of Abdullah Ibrahim and the exuberance of the Brotherhood of Breath. ‘Little Ones’ is a heartfelt ballad performance highlighting Idris’ clarinet mastery and also provides a delightful feature for Dankworth. ‘Sweet Jasmine’ is a delicate feature for Ridout and here, the trumpet and flute voicing is immaculate. This is a fine funky piece of music and allows Rahman’s almost Monkish piano full rein. ‘Go with the Flow’ once again brings flute to the fore to great effect and Dankworth puts body and soul into his feature, as does the trumpeter. ‘Roots’ starts with an introspective piano from Rahman before building to a magnificent piano trio performance with the drummer in his element. But for me the absolute highlight of the album is saved to the end with ‘Peace Garden’ which is almost inexplicably beautiful and shows Zoe Rahman at her gentle, meditative best.\n\nThis album presents a potpourri of musical elements infused by the varied backgrounds of the participants, by turns upbeat, swinging, joyful, funky, and ruminative. If it were possible to see Zoe Rahman’s group as a ship, it would be a mid-19th-century clipper with its hold crammed full of exotic spices all to be used to flavour Rahman’s new musical delicacies.\n\nAlan Musson\n\nThe Peter Franks Group follow up 2019’s Days Past with Days Ahead, another exploration in jazz and beats style, featuring “Peter Franks” bringing the hip hop production, drums, loops, bass, keys, etc. and a whole host of guest musicians. Also returning from the first platter is flautist Rachel Crennell, whose silky tones feature extensively throughout.\n\nNat Birchall’s up-front and dulcet sax tones kick off “From The Heart” (accompanied by vinyl crackles) bringing a spiritual jazz flavour to the slow tempo rhythm and big bell sample. The ear-catching “Dream In Colour” mixes broken beats with sunny, multi-tracked flute melodies and Marc Rapson’s lush, chordal cascade in a nu-jazz style. The dewy, symphonic folk of “Not Forgotten” follows. Here, Crennell’s performance is precise and moving, and along with the complimentary string arrangement, it’s a moment of beauty. “Creativity pt 1” is up-tempo, vaguely reminiscent of UFO and a vehicle for Gordon Wedderburn’s spoken word vocals; expounding on “the gift, a blessing from the Almighty”. “Alone Together” is a smooth and sweet mid-tempo interplay between flute and fluid keyboard arpeggios.\n\nSide two begins with more spiritual goodness from Birchall and Crennell on the title track. Amanda Whiting’s ethereal harp is the highlight of the serene “Were You Ever Here?”. “Train To Kyoto” and its sister track “Return Train To Kyoto” convey the essential kinetic energy that the titles suggest, enhanced by Tom Mason’s agile bass lines. The closer, “Creativity pt 2” is a bit more of a conventional jazz/hip hop crossover, while Gordon Wedderburn revels “in the blessing of being creative”.\n\nObviously, you’re getting beats, but The Peter Franks Group deliver a record that’s meditative, sometimes melancholic, but also celebratory. Days Past was a sophisticated and well-executed example of this style but Days Ahead is a significant progression from the debut. The production is sympathetic to its environment so there appears to be a greater symbiosis between the live music and the hip hop styling. I’m detecting a more experimental attitude too, so more character comes through in the performances; something that can sometimes go missing, lost behind the beats.\n\nKevin Ward"
