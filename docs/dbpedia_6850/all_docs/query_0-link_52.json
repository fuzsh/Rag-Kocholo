        "text": "I have been obsessed with Archie Shepp of late, and didn't see a thread devoted to him, although he gets mentioned a lot in the Jazz Beat thread and others. Recently picked up Kwanza and Mama Too Tight on cd and have been playing the heck out of those, along with the Way Ahead. Open for any comments - favorite albums, songs, favorite versions, have you seen him live? If you are a jazz music fan and dont know Archie Shepp then I highly recommend you sample some of his work. My Shepp collection:\n\nLive in San Francisco (mono LP)\n\nMontreux One (LP)\n\nMontreux Two (LP)\n\nBlack Gipsy (LP)\n\nThe New York Contemporary Five (cd)\n\nFour for Trane (cd)\n\nFire Music (cd)\n\nNew Thing at Newport (cd)\n\nAttica Blues (cd)\n\nKwanza (cd)\n\nMama Too Tight (cd)\n\nThe Way Ahead (cd)\n\nYasmina, a Black Woman (cd)\n\nI know I am missing the Magic of JuJu and Goin Home, but would like to hear other recomendations.\n\n@ParloFax did you get your answer on the Way Ahead version? Weigh in here. I have the Labson cd. Maybe it is because New Africa is one of my favorite jazz songs of all time but I dont think it sounds horrible. I think the version on my Kwanza cd may sound slightly better.\n\nI don't remember having ever commented on this recording. Perhaps you were thinking of another member here.\n\nYou had started a thread in 2014, it is closed now but i cut/pasted your quote here:\n\nI may have read here a comment from our host saying that John Coltrane's Impulse mono albums were all fold-downs. Does that rule apply to any Impulse recording artist from the 60s?\n\nOn that mono copy I got, Shepp sounds like coming from the end of a tunnel...\n\nSounds great. I found a Denon made in Japan cd a few weeks ago, but it was solo piano, I knew nothing about him. Would be interested to know what you think, please report back\n\nI was not aware of the “in Europe” but looks like you are correct, a lot of overlap with the New York Contemporary Five cd which was recorded in Denmark in Nov 1963. There may be a few unique songs on each album though. What a band, Shepp on tenor, Don Cherry on trumpet, John Tchicai on alto\n\nYou're right! Sorry, I had completely forgotten about that album, which I don't own anymore. I guess I had too many records back then! It all came back when I saw the front cover, at Discogs. The copy I had was from the UK. I still wish I knew about that bit I asked about though.\n\nThanks for insisting! :O)\n\nYou NEED - ASAP! - 'Things Have Got To Change', 'Live In Antibes', 'Live At The Pan-African Festival' and 'Coral Rock', at a minimum. They're all still in pretty heavy rotation thirty years after I first got them. All albums it's just impossible to get tired of.\n\n'Magic Of Ju-Ju' has been issued at least three times on CD in Japan, but has STILL never been issued Stateside. How is that even possible? What kind of world are we even living in?\n\nThanks! For Things Have Got to change - I was initially going to say I am not a fan of vocals but it seems to be done in Sun Ra style (like in Space is the Place) at least for the song Money Blues, so I might like that one. Live Antibes might be a little out there for my personal taste. Never heard of Coral Rock\n\n\"I was initially going to say I am not a fan of vocals \"\n\nYou can do'em , but they better be good - no GREAT. (IMO)\n\nSo I've re-spun the above Denon CDs and they all sound great thru multiple systems.\n\nAll produced thru Nippon Japan in the early-mid eighties. Producer Yoshi Ozawa\n\n'Ballads for Trane' is a mix of free jazz and what I'll call experimental over the traditional Ballad.\n\nI'm not a huge free jazz guy so I find I'm wishing for more standard jazz. The tone Archie gets using\n\ntenor and soprano sax... I don't want anything to get in the way.\n\n'Duet' with Dollar Brand is more art-jazz. Tenor, alto & soprano saxophone on this one. More\n\nlike dinner music. Nice.\n\n'On Green Dolphin Street' is right in the pocket for me. The liner notes describe the session.\n\nAfter everyone arrived, the all warmed up playing different things for a 1/2 hour. In six hours,\n\nwith little verbal communication, they laid down the tracks in one or two takes.\n\nArchie Shepp\n\nWalter Bishop\n\nSam Jones\n\nJoe Chambers\n\n1) Shepp is better than you might think at interpreting standards.\n\n2) His \"Live at On Broadway\", from a Sacramento gig, is a good record.\n\nI'm most familiar with his later output, not the wild stuff where he made his reputation. The Soul Note LPs. Soul Note is pretty solid for recording quality, incidentally.\n\nRecommended:\n\nDown Home New York\n\nLittle Red Moon\n\nCalifornia Meeting (Live On Broadway)\n\nthere is what sounds like a synthesiser in the background of the title track of 'Things Have Got to Change.' it plays continously throughout the complete track. moogs and ARPs were becoming available by then. does anyone have any information about this?\n\nDoes anyone have the CD version of Mama Too Tight that explains the meaning of the album title? I used to have it and recently got my hands on the vinyl but the liner notes are different. I've been looking everywhere for those CD liner notes. If some has it and wouldn't mind posting an image of it I'd appreciate it!"
