        "meta_description": "The Touch by Søren Kristiansen &amp; Thomas Fonnesbæk, released 04 February 2022\n\n1. Soft Winds\n2. Nigerian Marketplace\n3. On The Trail\n4. Love Ballade\n5. Night Child\n6. On Danish Shore\n7. Wheatland\n8. There Is No Greater Love\n9. Hymn To Freedom\n\nOnly time can tell if a musical composition will be considered a\r\n“classical” piece by future audiences, but as Danish music critic Søren\r\nSchauser has predicted: “In a couple of years we will see pieces by an\r\nEllington or a Peterson in regular concert programs in entirely classical\r\ncontexts.”\r\n\r\nWith “The Touch” Søren Kristiansen and Thomas Fonnesbæk present\r\ntheir take on a classic piece of jazz, playing the music of Oscar Peterson and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen - classical but improvised!\r\n\r\nOP and NHØP gave us something unique and unforgettable, just as the\r\nclassical composers did and still do. Being the world’s greatest\r\nvirtuosos on piano and double bass respectively, their immense\r\ntechnique and ‘Touch’ made them unique.\r\n\r\nTheir collaboration was likewise special because they were equals. For\r\ninstance, Oscar Peterson’s arrangement for “On The Trail” (Great\r\nConnection, 1971) was presumably written because he had found a\r\nbassist that could keep up both musically and technically.\r\n\r\nThe music of OP &amp; NHØP is maybe the most challenging repertoire that\r\nexists in classical jazz. It requires ‘The Touch’… The nuanced, personal\r\ntouch – the soft, almost inaudible accompaniment and an effortless\r\ntechnique. Søren Kristiansen describes the process: “Exactly like in\r\nsoccer, The Touch is something you practice. When you play piano or\r\nthe double bass you need to be able to control the instrument to express yourself freely in the moment.”\r\n\r\nSøren Kristiansen is one of the best and most acknowledged pianists in\r\nDenmark. Born and raised on the small Danish island Ærø he became a\r\npianist in Jesper Thilo’s quartet at a very young age and later on he\r\ntoured in Denmark and all over Europe with a number of great classical\r\nAmerican musicians. Søren Kristiansen is famous for his great\r\ntechnique, phenomenal swing, and vast amount of repertoire. An\r\nunusual musician – one of the few of his kind in Denmark.\r\n\r\nThomas Fonnesbæk was the obvious choice as bassist to The Touch,\r\nand he is one of the younger Danish bass players who continues the\r\nvirtuosity which NHØP was the first bassist to introduce. There is a\r\nwildness and energy in Thomas Fonnesbæk’s musical style that is very\r\nunusual. Unorthodox, but technically perfect.",
