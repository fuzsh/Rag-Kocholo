        "text": "Saxophonist and playwright Archie Shepp (b. May 24, 1937 in Fort Lauderdale. FL) then 26 years old visited Copenhagen in the fall of 1963 as a member of the famed New York Contemporary Five. Though Shepp at that time was the passionate practitioner of Free jazz, this recording in which he shared the bandstand with Sweden's legendary baritone saxophonist Lars Gullin is something quite different from what one normally expects from Shepp in the 60s. It is Shepp playing straight jazz with audible enjoyment showing off his broad range of expression.\"The topnotch rhythm section is composed of the late Catalonian pianist Tete Montoliu and a pair of \"young lions,\" Swedish (Danish ed) drummer Alex Riel and Danish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, seventeen years old when the recording was made. Montoliu's swinging, straight-on solos are a breath of fresh air.\" (Jack Bowers - AAJ)ARCHIE SHEPP tenor sax, LARS GULLIN baritone saxTETE MONTOLIU piano, NIELS-HENNING ORSTED PEDERSEN bass, ALEX RIEL drumsRecorded \"live\" at Montmartre Jazzhus, Copenhagen, November 21, 1963\n\nStream or download this album in high quality\n\n16-Bit\n\n44.1 kHz"
