        "text": "Cameron Brown\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nCameron Brown (born December 21, 1945) is an American jazz double bassist, perhaps best known for his association with the Don Pullen/George Adams Quartet.\n\nAmerican jazz double bassist\n\nCameron started studying music at age 10, first on piano, later on clarinet. But, drawn to the bass, he found himself playing a tin bass in a student dance band. As an exchange student in Europe, he worked with George Russell's Sextet[1] and Big Band for one year and played with Don Cherry, Aldo Romano, Booker Ervin, and Donald Byrd. In 1966 he returned to graduate at Columbia College resp. Columbia University (1969, B.A. in Sociology).\n\nIn 1974, Brown met Sheila Jordan, gigged with free jazz pioneers Roswell Rudd and Beaver Harris, joined Archie Shepp's quintet in 1975, and recorded with Harris' and The 360 Degree Music Experience around that time.\n\nThe famous Don Pullen/George Adams Quartet, with him and drummer Dannie Richmond,[2] developed into an intense and rewarding partnership which lasted during the 1980s. In addition to this quartet, Brown played with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, and various groups led be Shepp, Cherry, Rudd, and Richmond. He has also performed and recorded with Ted Curson, Lee Konitz, Chet Baker, Joe Lovano, Mal Waldron, Ricky Ford, Steve Grossman, Betty Carter and the John Hicks Trio, Etta Jones and Jane Ira Bloom.\n\nBrown has appeared on more than 80 recordings. His first recording as a leader, after nearly 40 years of performing, was published in 2003 with his group The Hear and Now featuring Dewey Redman.[3]\n\nIn addition to playing gigs and touring nationally and internationally, Brown is currently teaching jazz double bass at Green Meadow Waldorf School in Chestnut Ridge, New York, as well as offering private lessons. The musician also substitute teaches music theory classes at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York City.\n\nReferences\n\n^ Yanow, Scott. \"Review: At Beethoven Hall\" .

First of all, as a bassist myself, I was intrigued by the concept of just bass and voice. Secondly I was impressed by the sweet sound created by Cameron's choice of notes, his crystal clear tone, as well as his near perfect intonation. Cameron is quite a humble fellow when you talk to him about his playing, but this man can play some bass. His CD's are a must in any jazz collection.\n\nWayne Grosvenor"
