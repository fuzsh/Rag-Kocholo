        "text": "2284. SABU MARTINEZ: âPalo Congoâ (Blue Note/ Toshiba EMI â BLP-1561) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint/ 4-Paged Insert: Near Mint). Crystal clean Japan original pressing all complete with 4 paged insert. This one never came out with obi â so rest assured. Sabu Martinezâs debut as a leader mostly features percussionists (other than bassist Evaristo Baro), including the leader, Arsenio Rodriguez (who doubles on the tres), Cesar Travieso, Quique Travieso, and Ray âMosquitoâ Romero. Martinez, Rodriguez and Travieso also join Willie Capo and Sarah Baro in singing and chanting. Six of the eight songs are Martinezâs originals, although the most memorable cut is the opening \"El Cumbanchero,\" which has a catchy melody and a Martinez vocal that in tone sounds surprisingly like Cab Calloway in spots. Intriguing African-oriented music. Price: 60 Euro\n\n2285. SAGITTARIUS: âPresent Tenseâ (CBS Sony â 20AP-2197) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint â still housed in shrink/ Cap Obi: Near Mint, still housed in shrink/ 2 Inserts: Near Mint). Japan original 1st press issue all complete with scarce obi. Largely the work of producer Gary Usher (known for producing the Byrds' best albums and as a Beach Boys collaborator) and singer-songwriter Curt Boettcher. Their first of two albums, Present Tense largely retains the sunshine pop aspects of The Millennium, sweet and light and largely free of the harder edges. Sprinkled with a few psychedelic songs that are the clear stand-outs that make this more than a curiosity for fans of sunshine pop and psychedelic baroque acid flutter. The tour de force \"My World Fell Down\" is light psychedelia, Zombies-like baroque pop with a lovely hook in the chorus, the string- and harmony-laden production a chance for Usher to show off his studio chops. And \"The Truth Is Not Real\" is a lost psychedelic classic, deliriously trippy with shades of the Moody Blues on a bender. Meanwhile, \"I'm Not Living Here\" channels the Mamas & the Papas and the early Byrds with its lustrous blend of folk and pop and is a fantastic late 60s gem that would've been a major AM radio hit in a more just universe. Near perfect album all around that edges near the perfect sound. Utterly addictive listening experience. Top condition. Price: 100 Euro\n\n2286. SAHIB SHIHAB:Â “Jazz Sahib” (Savoy/ CBS Sony â SOPU-37-SY) (Record & Jacket & Insert & CAP OBI: Mint - SEALED). Crystal clean SEALED Japan original 1stÂ press issue with rare OBI.Â Rare original Japanese high quality pressing of this masterpiece, first one I can lay my hands on complete with Obi & still SEALED.Â Personnel: Shahib Shihab (baritone saxophone), Phil Woods (alto saxophone), Bennie Golson (tenor saxophone), Hank Jones, Bill Evans (piano), Paul Chambers, Oscar Pettiford (bass), Art Taylor (drums).Â Legendary hard bopping and butt-shaking slide recorded way back in 1957, at the height of the Beats generation.Â If you haven't been converted to the thrills of be-bop saxophone battles, the kind that drove Jack Kerouac and his buddies into frenzies in the early 50's, this slide originally recorded and released on the Savoy label offers you a great peak into that West Coast Jazz madness. It will open you up to a corker, with all the players involved nipping at each other's heels. Sahib Shihab on baritone saxophone presents an unorthodox three-saxophone front line with some richly colored vehicles for improvisation. A special treat: The pianist is a very young and boppish Bill Evans.Â Legendary and top notch Japanese original pressing with OBI and SEALED. Jaw-droppingly great stuff.Â Price: 75 Euro\n\n2287. SAHIB SHIHAB: âSentimentsâ (Storyville/ Sonet – SLPS-1008) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint ~ Mint). Original Danish 1972 pressing on Storyville, with the big âStoryville lettering on the label. Of all the American jazz artists who relocated to Europe and Scandinavia in the 1950s and 1960s, Sahib Shihab remains one of the most highly regarded and versatile, yet least celebrated. Sentiments was recorded in Denmark in March 1971 and was released on the Danish Storyville label. The album features Shihab alongside Danish super-bass man Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, and two fellow Americans, drummer Jimmy Hopps and pianist Kenny Drew (like Shihab, Drew also settled in Denmark and recorded extensively for Danish label Steeplechase). Sentiments was Shihabâs last album as leader, although he did go on to record projects as co-leader with the likes of fellow American Phil Woods and French pianist/composer Jef Gilson. Fantastic recording and this is the rare original in absolutely TOP condition. Rarely surfaces this clean. Price: 400 Euro\n\n2288. SAHIB SHIHAB: âSahibâs Jazz Partyâ (Norma/ Tokuma Japan – NLP-2011) (Record: Mint/ Jacket: Mint/ Insert: Mint/ Obi: Mint). Rare very first Japan original pressing that came out over 30 years ago in top condition. Sahib's Jazz Party is his third album as a bandleader. Recorded live in its entirety Sahib's Jazz Party features a few highly entertaining announcements by the master himself leaving the impression that Sahib was a bit far out that day. The performance is beautiful and passionate. He plays flute and saxophone backed up by a Danish jazz orchestra even with an electric guitar, in clean mode of course. Especially in the third part of the \"Conversation\" piece the dialogues between saxophone and trumpet are amazing while in \"Charade\" Shihab uses his flute to conjure a mind-relaxing atmosphere. The rhythms are all quite hot and whipping. The drummers must be some kind of madmen. Yes, there are two drummers indicated for the \"Conversation\" long track and the ever pulsating and vibrating rhythm patterns will prove that right. Bass and guitar rather back up everything and fill the gaps with simple notes which add just enough to leave the whole picture feeling full and round. Sahib's Jazz Party holds the same level as the most appreciated works of Miles Davis and John Coltrane during their modal jazz stint. All-in-all, the whole band is steaming and so full of passion, any listener will be electrified without fail. Price: 100 Euro\n\n2289. SAHIB SHIHAB Featuring: Kenny Clarke; Benny Bailey; Francy Boland; Milt Jackson; Ake Persson & Jimmy Woode: âCompanionship – Jazz Joint Vol. 2â (Vogue Schallplatten – LDVS-17243) (2 LP Record: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Excellent ~ Near Mint). Top condition copy, German 1st original pressing of 1971. They hardly ever surface this clean! Double-length brilliance from the mighty Sahib Shihab – a set that collects a number of killer 60s sessions with members of the Clarke Boland Big Band – all of them great! The small combo work here is amazing – hard-hitting modal jazz that matches, if not tops the best MPS/Saba sounds of the time – all produced to perfection with a really sharp edge, and a cutting approach to jazz that's gone onto inspired countless others in the current scene – including artists on Schema and Ricky-Tick Records, as well as most Japanese club jazz combos! But long before any of those cats started copping his groove, Sahib Shihab had it all totally together – a great ear for his own amazing solos on baritone and flute, and a way of hooking up with players like Francy Boland on piano, Fats Sadi on vibes, Benny Bailey on trumpet, Jimmy Woode on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums. All players here were Shihab's partners in the Clarke Boland Big Band, and they use these small combo sessions to explore some great new ideas – stripped-down groovers that are heavy on rhythm, and really allow full expression from all the players involved. Price: Offers!!! 2290. SAHIB SHIHAB Featuring:Â Kenny Clarke; Benny Bailey; Francy Boland; Milt Jackson; Ake Persson & Jimmy Woode:Â “Companionship â Jazz Joint” (Columbia Records â PSS-252~3-AX) (2 LP Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ OBI: Excellent). Great condition copy, insanely rare Japan 1stÂ original pressing of 1971 â all complete with never offered before unique first issue obi. PROMO issue. Although a Sahib Shihab leader album, the obi flanking this slide states “Companionship â Kenny Clark and his Friends” with no mention of Shihab. Impossible to find â took me 2 decades to unearth a copy with obi! Double-length brilliance from the mighty Sahib Shihab â a set that collects several killer 60s sessions with members of the Clarke Boland Big Band â all of them great! The small combo work here is amazing â hard-hitting modal jazz that matches, all produced to perfection with a really sharp edge, and a cutting approach to jazz that's gone onto inspired countless others in the current scene â including artists on Schema and Ricky-Tick Records, as well as most Japanese club jazz combos!

SAHIB SHIHAB Featuring:Â Kenny Clarke; Benny Bailey; Francy Boland; Milt Jackson; Ake Persson & Jimmy Woode: “Companionship â Jazz Joint” (Columbia Records â PSS-252~3-AX) (2 LP Record: First record is Excellent, the 2nd record is Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Excellent). Cheaper option â rare Japanese press issue but with the obi missing. Price: 150 Euro 2292. The SAINTS: âThe Most Primitive Band in The World â Live From The Twilight Zone â Brisbane 1974â (Hot Records â 1053LP) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint/ Catalogue Booklet Insert: Near Mint). 1995 original pressing of awesome the Saints recordings. Released over a quarter of a decade ago in the UK in a run of 500 copies only, making it a slab of vinyl that has become quite elusive. Trashy, gritty and primitive garage punk from down-underâs finest dirt sniffers. Everything is in overdrive here, amps cracked up and oozing out hot chunks of distorted lava, gnarly & wasted vocals drowned out by all pulverizing greasy and blown-out speakers, rhythm section straight out of Neanderthal times, sneering lithoid scruffy guitar assaultsâ¦. The Saints were blessed with all the right ingredients to be and becoming one of the greatest bands of all time but no one was listening! Blasting this at full throttle, it always makes me wanna hit the crack pipe and get wasted beyond oblivion. Awesome! So essential, so good! Price: 75 Euro\n\n2293. SAIRAIJI HIROMI: âHatobaâ (Columbia – ALS-5171) (Record: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Fold Out jacket: Mint/ Obi: Mint. Completely vanished head twister, copies have completely dried up. Finally I was able to unearth another copy of this much in demand but hard to score deep underground enka masterpiece. Ok here is the deal, we are gonna hit you with something really obscure, so obscure that all the underground stuff you thought you knew seams like mainstream in comparison. This is real hardcore obscure shit that no-one even knows about. I have to encounter the first person yet who knows about this disc, apart from PSFâs Ikeezumi who introduced me to this jewel of a disc with the words: âYou want to hear some real underground stuff? Like bottom of the well Enka that is so deliriously great everyone fail to notice it because it blinded them like gazing at the sun for too long?â Of course I was keen to hear what he would hit me with and he spun me the first track of this debut album by then 19-years old Sairaiji Hiromi. I was immediately blown away. I had never ever heard anything quite similar like this. I had trouble to gather my sanity after that, my legs were shaking, my word phrasing became a stuttering mess of vowels, in other words I was perplexed. Well, how can I describe this rarity? Best thing I can come up with is âUnderground Female Enka Howlingâ. Although Sairaiji was only 19 years old at the time of recording this in 1972, she sounds like a weather beaten down old nag, a witch out of a Kobayashi flick, nasal deranged vocals, wailing away like an old wolf in heat, disturbing but mesmerizing at the same time. Psychedelic but oddly Norman with a demented twist. I never heard a girl howl like this, not even Lisa Suckdog come closeâ¦hardcore stuff and the best record I heard in 2005 amongst others. Of course after being exposed I searched high and low for a copy but due to extremely bad sales, most copies were taken out of circulation and destroyed. I finally found myself a copy and only last month I acquired this one. These babies just do not turn up but since no-one is aware of the sheer demented beauty of it they are still quite cheap. So this one has my all time highest recommendation. Extremely rare. Price: 175 Euro\n\n2294. SAKAI CHIKUHO: “Suizen” (Columbia Records â KX-7001~3) (3 LP Set: Near Mint/ Embossed Outer LP Box with Silver Lettering: Near Mint/ Booklet: Near Mint/ Obi: Mint). Bloody rare collection in mint condition, original 1974 issue. Eye-pooping collection that focuses on â like the title already suggests â at esoteric Japanese Zen oriented flute/ shakuhachi musical escapades. This set will only appeal to the most seasoned listener, if you are a hipster and you decide to get lost in this kind of music, you will get bummed out, depressed and on the brink of slashing your wrists and setting fire to yourself, which in all would be quite a spectacle I would like to bear witness to. Still, I think it would be wise that the more experienced listener would get his hands on this because it is something that most of your “rock” fiends â how heavy and far out you conceive yourself to be â will fail to get a grasp on. So if you consider yourself a Japanophile and culturally enhanced listener who frequently dabbles in the Horogei and field recording sections of this site, for those listeners this set will be a total mind shattering revelation, revealing to you some of the most exquisite sounds ever recorded. For the rest of you, this stuff will bum you out and make you utterly depressed so steer away from it. I myself I am hooked to this shit, always looking for a next fix and this set just may do it, so lovers of Watazumido and Yamada Chisato should jump into this set blindfolded because the music is insane. Next to that the packaging is too elaborate for words, 3 LP’s housed in a beautifully designed case box set. Massive. Price: 400 Euro\n\n2295. SALLY MAY: âKinpatsu Enkaâ (Victor – SJX – 35) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ OBI: MINT). Bloody rare 1st original pressing with OBI!!!! Never had a copy with obi before – this is rare as hell freezing over on a hot summer day! Here is a freak oddity for you. Although being a Caucasian chick, Sally May was born in Tokyo on February 13th, 1947 as a mixed race child out of a Japanese mother and an American father. From an early age on she had the longing to become a singer and she started out singing at the familyâs restaurant. In 1963 she was scouted out by the lead singer of the Five Suns band and stated out singing occasionally with the band The Sharp Hawks. Soon hereafter she debuted as a singer for commercial ads and a model, followed with an occasional role in a major movie. This attracted the attention of the Victor label who approached her and by September 1969, the album âKinpatsu no Enka – Sally Mayâ was released, which translates literally as âBlond Haired Enkaâ, a title and accompanying jacket that must have driven the fantasies of Japanese men for blond women even to higher realms at that time. The record was neither pop nor rock but consisted out of solid enka tunes sung by a blond nymph who later down the road would star in various films and some roman porno flicks. The music was especially well received by Pachinko Parlor attendants, Snacks, taxi drivers and other venues who had the radio on, gushing out her blond toned voice. Due to the eye-popping red background supporting a fully kimono clothed blond nymphet that suggested lust and erotic induced contents (which were far from present on this album) normal punters and young youths stayed away from it, making it till this day an extremely unknown and hard to come by cultural oddity. Recommended for those into the weirder aspect of Japanese popular 1960s culture and for all of you Enka lovers out there who are starving for some really hard to come by shit. Awesome jacket!! OBI is just mega rare and this copy is next to impossible to upgrade upon!!!! Erotic kayokyoku heavy weight. Price: Offers!!!!\n\n2296. SALVATION ARMY: “Befour Three O’Clock” (Frontier Records â PLP-1008) (Record: VG++ ~ Excellent/ Jacket: VG++) Damned cheap but highly essential Paisely Underground actâ¦but not that easy to find in the wyld. A rough but engaging debut for this three-piece garage rock band with a '60s bent. Punk in spirit but filled in with near-psychedelic guitar swirls and pop vocals, the band forged the foundation of the Paisley Underground movement, a sound that incorporated the best of the '60s from the Beatles to the Byrds to the Velvet Underground. \"She Turns to Flowers\" and \"While We Were in Your Room Talking to Your Wall,\" if only in their titles, send a clear message of where the band was coming from. Brilliant slide!!! Highest recommendation. Price: 40 Euro 2297. SAMURAI: “Kappa” (Philips â FX-8511) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Insert: Near Mint). TOP COPY, first original pressing, it has been a while since I could score an original, these babies getting scarcer by the second. The fist record to see the light under Miki Curtis new born Samurai banner, originally released on April 1971. Ok tyme to strap yourself in because it is going to be a wyld ride. After having played all over the hotel lounge scene during the mid and late sixties, Mickey Curtis and his samurai band returned home, disbanded, and disintegrated only to rise as a phoenix out of their ashes, be it in a slightly altered form, both music wise and member wise. So, although two lounge albums appeared under the Samurai banner previously, one can safely state that this was their debut as a group merging hard rock, jazzy moves, organ driven swirling psych and prog rocking dementia into one coherent and addictive sonic wash. To put it very bluntly, side one can be considered the “song side” although that is in a way an overstatement ‘cause the band mainly exploits the word “song” to embark on freefalling spun-out excursions into the darkest corners of your perverted mind. The second side is totally instrumental and swings in between freak-out acidic jams towards tribal percussive driven ethereal freeform evocative music. Juggernaut brooding organ riffage fuses with heavy amplified rock moves that at times even approaches Sabbath levels of intensity. Just massive and one of the cornerstones within the early seventies Japanese psych pantheon. Totally essential. Price: 475 Euro 2298. SAMURAI: âS/Tâ (Philips â FX-8517) (Record: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Insert: Near Mint/ Capsule Obi: Mint). TOP COPY Original 1971 press. Mega rare with never-offered-before capsule OBI present!!! Top condition, no signs of play at all. Totally vanished first original Japanese pressing, this has completely dried up these past years, copies just do not surface anymore, making it 5 times as rare as the more common German issue. With the obi present, well this makes it almost impossible to dig up. First all-complete copy I see in over 15 years!!! First original Japanese pressing. Comes with insert & OBI. Miki Curtis & Samurai second self-entitled album. Hyper rare progressive and psychedelic masterpiece with vicious organ leads and guitar ripping insertions. I guess you know the drill and the status of this disc. I think that this monster does not come any better than this. All time Japanese psych masterpiece and a tough score these days. Truly great copy in NM ~ M condition. Since the original Japanese issue vanished completely + fact I havenât had a copy in at least 5 years and with obi not even one in my whole life, you may have a chance to get a mint copy and a Japanese 1st press issue. Amazing copy, next to impossible to upgrade upon. Obi is freakingly & impossibly rare so you will have to give me your all-time best shot for this one. Top condition!!! Price: Offers!!\n\n2299. SAMURAI: âS/Tâ (London/King Records – SLC-409) (Record: Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Obi: MINT). Freakingly rare Japanese white label promotional press with never seen obi present, all in virginal MINT condition. First of all, donât get confused; we are talking here about the UK band Samurai, not the Japanese one. Original UK copies of this album are a bitch to find these days but Japanese pressings of this album are even a tougher score simply because a/ they never made it past the âpromotional pressâ stage and b/ although some copies made it to some shops here back in 1971, no one so far seems to have actually seen a regular Japanese edition one, so the few copies that do float around are all promotional press copies. Then, another issue is that of those promo copies, only a handful seems to have survived with the Obi intact, making this copy here a genuine rarity. Only the 2nd copy to surface in 15 years of time. For the rest, Samurai is a great UK progressive rock band that came into existence after the band Webb folded its activities and Samurai went one to record only one single album. The music is astonishing and should appeal to all psych/ prog lunatics out here. Comes housed in an eye-popping gatefold sleeve with matching deliriously detailed artwork. Top copy!! Price: Offers!!!!\n\n2300. SAN FRANCISCO SOUND: “Fifth Pipe Dream Vol. 1” (private â S7-11680) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint). 1st pressing that comes housed in a B&W gatefold jacket, 2nd press came in a colored version. 1st pressing of this beauty is damned rare there were the 2nd pressing turns up at regular intervals. Top condition!!! Essential compilation with unreleased tracks by Tripsichord Music Box; It's A Beautiful Day, Indian Puddin & Pipe, etc. Stupendous b&w gatefold cover art that is in top condition, no shelf or ring wear. Amazing artifact as spewed out of the cradle of acid rock at that time, totally essential genre piece. First time I have an original in near perfect shape. Price: 550 Euro\n\n2301. SANDRA JULIEN: “Sexy Poem” (Victor â SWG-7252) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Nude Poster Pin Up: Near Mint/ Attached Nude Pictures Booklet: Near Mint/) It has been ages since I had a copy as clean as this one here!!! Released in 1972 on Victor Japan, original press with all gimmickry included in top-notch condition. Together with the Ike Reiko disc, this is the rarest erotic psych chanson album to ever seep out of Japan and copies just never turn up, until now. Sandra Julien was a French porn actress who made her screen debut in Japan in 1970 with the movie “Shikijou Nikki”, which premiered in 1971. Although that at that time porn flicks in Japan enjoyed very little publicity, the film turned out to be a success. Hereafter she teamed up with legendary pink violence movie producer Norifumi Suzuki and appeared in lustful depraved masterpieces such as “Gendai PornodenÂ Senten Seiinpu” and numerous others. Apart from two hideously rare 7-inches, Sandra recorded one sole LP on the Victor label that came out in 1971, depicting in full splendor her beauty and pale skin, which drove punters nuts with unbridled lust. But apart from the lovely jacket and pictures/ poster that were included with the LP, the musical contents are just deliriously fantastic and stand quality-wise shoulder to shoulder with Ike Reiko’s “Koukotsu No Sekai” as the sexiest disc ever recorded worldwide. Just imagine this: a French nymphet singing and moaning in the Japanese language impregnated with a heavy sultry French accent. How more erotic can music possibly get? Right, it can’t, it climaxes right here. But apart from these ingredients, the music and songs are just perfect, filled to bursting with top notch arrangements (courtesy of Araki Ichiro), placing Sandra’s against an at times Kayokyoku background which she spices up with oversexed talk and pink induced atmospheric qualities, swingy loungey settings against which she succeeds in lifting up the benumbest and most dormant of your body parts and taking it to never experienced before explosive heights of ecstasy. But that is not all, Sandra even ventures aside from all the loungey mood sets also into lesbian moaning and groaning interaction (a duo with starlet Sugimoto Miki) set to a wild R&B Go-Go frenzy filled with tribal bongo rattles, swinging horn section and a never-ending copulating climax. Throw ‘the Plastercasters’ out of the window and kiss goodbye to your Serge Gainsbourg records, Sandra Julien is more sizzling than a branding iron makingÂ itsÂ mark on the farmer’s herd. The sex is literally dripping from every note on this record with breasts, attitude, exotic musical accompaniment and more than you can possibly handle orgasmic moaning and spoken interludes resembling cheap phone sex by Sandra who is free to do her thing, which unsurprisingly is cooing sensually as the songs roll along, allowing her sexuality to take control. This disc is â as you could already guess bloody rare.Â A killer recordÂ all way round and one of my all-time favorites. Getting damned hard to find all-complete with poster!!! Bloody insane and great, so all-time highest recommendation. Price: Offers!!!!\n\n2302. SANDSTONE: âCan You Mend A Silver Threadâ (Private US – 1971/ SA-2911) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Excellent ~ Near Mint). Top copy of rare US 1971 private press psychedelic folk masterpiece. THE US psych folk album everyoneâs chasing it seems. Locally released female vox led folk album that could have been a UK release in the Stoneangel, Pentangle, Mellow Candle realms. Haunting female vocals, original compositions, flute, harpsichord, bass/ drum, cello and guitars create a beautiful outer-wordly feel. To my ears the best US folk psych album Iâve yet heardâ¦ Amazingly clean copy of a record that was originally released in micro quantityâ¦Price: Offers!!!!\n\n2303. SARA & MELODY: âSound of the Pacificâ (King – SKK-635) (Marble Wax Record: Near Mint/ Outer Hard Slip Case Plastic Jacket: Mint/ Inserted four paged Jacket: Mint/ STICKER OBI: Mint). Freakingly rare original 1st pressings with rare sticker OBI!!!! Copies with sticker obi still attached to the outer plastic case are almost non-existent anymore, the sticker obi is always missing and torn off. This copy here is the only fully intact copy I have ever seen. OK, letâs cut to the chase. Here you have a bloody rare Japanese psychedelic oddity I have never ever seen offered for sale before since hardly anyone knows about this gem – apart from some heavy Japanese collectors only. And it is quite an oddity that defies categorization. Nope, no point in checking the dreadful Japrocksampler or any of the Pokora books, I doubt you will find any info in there. So what is it all about? Sara and Melody were two young Japanese nymphets that heralded out of the Hawaiian islands – at least that is the story and they cut this one album while crossing the seas towards the motherland around 1968ã9. There they were recruited by no one else than the legendary Ishikawa Akira (of Count Buffaloos and Uganda fame) in order to cut this one-off album. Stylistically the album is hard to categorize but in order to try and describe this gem the closest I can come up with is âgroovy psychedelic Japanese Minyo cross-breeding with Sergio Mendez kind off Latin vibes and Bossa rock styled movesâ. And to top it all off, it was sung in perfect English, making it all the more exotic and off-the hook. In short it is late sixties Japanese psychedelic mondo rock that in decades to come would inspire contemporary groups like the Hair and ilk, plundering the sonics of this disc to death. âSound of the Pacificâ is a real gem of an album that comes housed in a fold out soft paper jacket complete with totally psyched out jacket art which on its turn is housed in a hard case plastic cover. The disc is then pressed on colorful marbled wax, making it visually even more lysergic. It fits the music like a velvet glove. Hideously rare, especially with outer plastic cover intact. Just never surfaces on these shores and comes with the highest possible recommendation if weird but oddly normal genre defying Japanese weird pop psych is your thing. No fuzz or so on this one, but mind bendingly great nevertheless. Bound to never surface again, just mark my words. AWESOME!!! And blooooody rare. Totally mint copy with OBI present soâ¦.. Price: 450 Euro\n\n2304. SARABIA CHELIQUE: “Revolucion Electronica en Musica Venezolana” (Promus â LPP-2039) (record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Excellent ~ Near Mint). Original 1971 Venezuelan pressing in top shape. Sarabia was a Venezuelan odd cat who set out to reinvigorate traditional Venezuelan songs and traditional music by using contemporary recording techniques and injecting it with contemporary electronic recording effects. He especially used the M.R.A.A. equipment which is not quite unlike the Moog synthesizer in combination with traditional instruments and put it to use to give birth to a new form and interpretation to Venezuelan songs. The end result is for 1971 a hybrid like exotica oddball of a recording that fuses neatly with your afternoon Happy Hour cocktail time next to the pool while drooling over naked snow bunnies. Not the easiest one to track down in top shape. Stunning copy here for grabs. Price: 100 Euro 2305. MICHEL SARDABY TRIO: “Night Cap” (Disques Debs â HDD-522) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). True French 1st original pressing that comes on red label. One of the most beautiful albums ever recorded by Parisian pianist Michel Sardaby â a rare 1970 session that features his piano alongside bass by Percy Heath and drums by Connie Kay of the MJQ! The groove here is strong and powerful â with a depth that shows Sardaby really growing tremendously as a writer, and working through some extremely inventive ideas on the keys. The album's got a richly flowing quality that showcases Sardaby's deep well of soulful imagination Top condition! Price: 200 Euro 2306. SATO KUNITAKU: âAmami No Nakiutaâ (Teichiku Records â BH-1527) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint/ Booklet: Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint). Top notch copy of stupidly rare 1975 original pressing all complete with obi and booklet. Well, look no further, THIS IS THA SHIT!!!! Sato Kunitakuâs debut LP that documents his roaring singing that squeezes the throat and erupts from the back of the belly. Once he sings, the image ethnic folk songs might behold is destroyed and the orthodox island songs from his native Okinawa he brings forth are completely altered to a parallel universe where the laws of gravity and mere sound cultivation do not exist anymore. This is the Charley Patton from Japan or the Blind Willie Johnson from Amami Island. Sato was a blind itinerant musician from Amami Island, south of Kyuushuu. Born in 1919, he lost his eyesight when eight months old. His grandfather taught him to play sanshin, the southern shamisen, to ensure that Sato would be able to earn a living when he grew up. When he was 12, Sato began to play tategoto, a vertically-held koto so to speak, developing his own unique style. Upon turning 17, he began a wandering lifestyle, traveling through the Ryukyu Islands, a thousand-kilometer subtropical archipelago including Okinawa. He supported himself as a traveling musician, performing island folk songs, pre-War popular songs and his own compositions. Although he was a fine instrumentalist, Satoâs real power resides in his voice: a powerful, wailing, howling sound dredged up from the depths of his soul â a dark, intense sound-world most unlike the relatively smoother, sunny vocal styles of other Ryukyu/Okinawa singers. After World War II, Satoâs popularity spread to the U.S. troops stationed in Okinawa, and it is rumored that his wanderings took him to Hawaii. He continued his itinerant ways, traveling through the archipelago, singing, playing, living and loving (a man of rumor and mystery, he is said to have married at least eight different women during his lifetime). In the early 1970s, he came to the attention of Takenaka Ro, a writer and political activist, and through Takenakaâs enthusiastic support, Sato travelled to Tokyo in 1975 to record his first album. Satoâs fame continued to spread, and he performed at various folk festivals and made other recordings, some of which were released posthumously. Traveling and playing throughout the islands to the end, he made his last public appearance in Okinawa in 1985 and died the same year. But this is his first record, damned hard to find as copies are scarce and sold not well upon its release. But the contents are vicious gut-wrenching and soul-blackening killer, bruised beyond repair hardcore shit that will set the hairs on your neck straight up and awaiting to be scorched! Burned down blisters and open soars like on a dogâs neck, welcoming the unavoidable Gospel Apocalypse!!!!Top condition and seriously rare first press original. Price: Offers!!! 2307. SATO MASAHIKO: “Transformation ‘69/ ‘71” (Express â ETP-9041) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Excellent ~ Near Mint â has faintest trace of foxing) Very rare PROMO WHITE label copy. I do not know what it is with Japanese free jazz these days but discs documenting that scene are rising quicker than a high tide on a full moon and next to that it seems almost completely impossible to dig them up anymore, like there is a great stock-before-famine-comes tide washing through the archipelago as far as rare records are concerned. And this disc is no exception; it has been years since I could lay my hands upon a copy of this classic masterpiece. Sato Masahiko’s classic trio where he gets flanked by Yasuo Arakawa and Masahiko Togashi. One freakingly heavy sidelong track and one two track side grace this disc, both highlighting a different side of the trio in action. Side A opens up with “Tigris” a soft free floating lyrical seven-minute excursion that showcases Sato as a golden boy on the ivory keys while Arakawa and Togashi provide the perfect backbeat. Free but smooth as silk, just perfect. The second composition “On a Clear Day” almost sees Sato meandering into Monk like influenced waters that begins slow paced before venturing of into a high gear accelerated speed up frenzy that remains an artfully structuralized berserker. There is much solo space for each of the three players and the spacious mix buts each of the three upfront on different occasions. It is a stunning showcase of three gifted players at the top of their game. Both of these tracks were recorded on March 17th and 20th, 1969. The B Side sidelong track is a whole different affair. Being recorded two years later on March 2nd, 1971, the trio sounds here like being on fire. From the opening notes on, one can feel and hear a different mood set, a tad introvert and dark but when things get rolling, it becomes an unfettered affair, fusing power and poetry into one coherent slab of paradigmatic oriental Fire Music. Cascading notes, tornado-like curveballs of sonic clusters that sound like almost a piano induced frenzy as an afterthought to a firestorm of improvisational interplay. Collective improvisation built up around piano pounding and droning base stroking aesthetics evolve into a workout spiked with moments of real intense beauty especially with Sato sweeping across the keys, injecting his play with electronic sounds and prepared piano moves while Arakawa scrapes his bass snares and Togashi cooks up a storm of muffled brushes and strokes. Still like most true inventive Fire Music it is also an exhausting and equally rewarding listening experience. These cats had it all down; gracious free-floating grandeur that touches divinity while creation unfolds itself. Just massive and highly important recording. Getting extremely rare these days. Price: 500 Euro\n\n2308. SATO MASAHIKO TRIO: âPenetration – Masahiko Sato Trio in Berlinâ (Toshiba – TP-9521Z) (Record: Near Mint/ Liner Notes: Near Mint/ Outer Box Set: Near Mint/). This is the BOMB!!!! Insanely rare & hardly ever seen before Japanese free jazz monster. The LP came out in the same single disc box set series just like Uganda. And like Uganda, this disc is almost as rare, never surfaces and is just rarer as a henâs teeth. This is the 1st original pressing released in a box. There is a common later press that comes in a different jacket, released on a different label (Express I believe) and even the music was cut short as opposed to the original version if I recall right. So here is the first original pressing and copies in existence are very few and far in between. It just never turns up and so far I know of only a handful of people owning a copy of this edition. But the music is what really counts here and that is a vicious one. Recorded live at the Berlin Jazz Festival on November 6th, 1971. The trio at this point consisted out of Sato Masahiko (Piano and ring modulator), Arakawa Yasuo (bass) and Ozu Masahiko (drums). What makes this disc possibly the greatest LP ever recorded by Sato Masahiko (apart from his Sato Masahiko & Soundbreakers album) is his use of fusing piano with electronic sounds and the employment of a ring modulator. By doing so he creates a wonderful eerie fusion of acoustic and electronic generated sounds that mingle with the free jazz aesthetic the groups exerts. Due to the ring modulator and the contact microphones attached to his piano, the trioâs improvisations get revved up with a reverberating echo and an electronic buzzing and whirling, creating some sort of background hissing feedback that zooms in and out of focus, adding an extra demented touch to Satoâs visions of piano drivinâ free jazz. The two side-long tracks are pregnant with a buzzing electronically charged tension that hovers in the air and almost sets the scene for an aquanautic-like recorded free improv brawl. The overall atmosphere is dense and inseminated with a thunder like tension that looms over the session, like the moist heat and threatening tempestuous winds assembling and gathering furious strength on the horizon ready to unleash their wrath and tropical tempestuous anger upon mankind. A roaring silence pregnant with suspense and danger which unleashes its full swirling whirl-blasting rage upon coming of age on side two. I guess this is as close one can come simulating the sounds of sitting in the midst of a tornado with debris flying around your head. Amazing disc that simultaneously appeals to the free jazz/ improvisation and electronic music lover that resides within me. This first edition box set version is super rare since the record bombed upon its release and failed to sell any copies. Some years later down the road, the Express label released it as a single jacket budget issue housed in a different quite hideously designed jacket, which is more easily available. But this 1st press copy just never turns up, making it one of the rarest Japanese free jazz/ experimental discs to have seen the light of day. Price: Offers!!!!\n\n2309. SATO MASAHIKO & JEAN-LUC PONTY: “Astrorama” (Liberty Records â LPC-8039) (Record: Near Mint/ Silver foil laminated sleeve: Near Mint/ OBI: Mint). Rare 1971 groovy jazz head-spinner â next-to-impossible to score with OBI but here it is, virginal 1st press original with the monster rare OBI. Recorded in 1970, \"Astrorama\" contains four originals, three -Ponty's and one Sato's. With no doubt it is Ponty's album first of all - his violin fusion shredding absolutely dominates here even if experienced ear can hear some interesting Sato soloing in few places. Sato plays electric piano here trying to adapt his very different techniques to Ponty quite conservative jazz fusion's requirements. As a result he sounds more as Hancock on his very early fusion recordings. They get flanked by drummer Motohiko Hino (brother of renown trumpeter Terumasa Hino) guitarist & shredder Yoshiaki Masuo who brings some real heat with simmering psyched out fuzz licks and bassist Dane Niels Henning Orsted Pedersen. Ponty feels a true leader and obviously dominates with quite enthusiastic support from electric guitarist and drummer. Sato balances with different success between electric piano fusion passages and more complex, free and partially psychedelic pieces. The set pairs Ponty's great electric violin with the keyboards of Masahiko Santo - a player with a vision that's as far-reaching and searching as Ponty's music at this point in his career - deeply expressive, but without any of the cliches that might have come into this sort of a record a few years later - and often handled with some deeply spiritual overtones! This is definitely is one of Jean-Luc's best albums ever - even though it's one of his most obscure. A killer album only ever issued in Japan and a true deep jazz slide! Impossible in this condition with OBI. Price: 600 Euro\n\n2310. SATO MASAHIKO with the 1864 COTTON FIELD ROCK BAND: “Come Back To Foster” (Victor Records â SPX-1002) (Record: Near Mint/ Heavy Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint). Rare Japan very first press original all complete with damned rare first issue OBI!! (There were a couple of other more common obi variations that came out here after but the very first obi issue is a damned scarce one.) TOP condition!!! Killer lineup with all the right Japanese scenesters present being: Sato Masahiko at the forefront with Electric Piano, Yasuo Arakawa on bass, Akira Ishikawa mangling the drums and percussion, Kiyoshi Sugimoto riffing out on guitar, Sadanori Nakamure and Yoshiaki Masuo on Soprano Saxophone, Ichihara Kohsuke on tenor sax and finally the beast Mototeru Takagi Tenor Saxophone and bass clarinet. Superficially this is another laidback oddity in Sato Masahiko’s discography, groovy and loungey jazz rock tracks that at the right times get venomously pierced by demented sax howler Takagi Mototeru’s full frontal free form blowouts (he is always there either right in yer face or brooding distinctively in the distance while unleashing a holy racket), and Sugimoto’s lysergic guitar playing, making you wonder what the fuck you are listening to in the first placeâ¦. Cool and anesthetized hybrid groovy lounge vibes meets all incinerating free jazz sax infernos carried on a flowerbed of softly DMT spiked jazz rocking vibes. What a fucked-up combinationâ¦. While you hoping to seep back towards some sense of a relaxing cocktail drowsed beach holiday but still, while grinding your teeth, feeling that edge of a long-forgotten speed trip creeping back to the foreground and which you try to numb out desperately by oozing down downers and laxatives. What a strange rideâ¦Price: 450 Euro 2311. SATO MASAHIKO/ TOGASHI MASAHIKO/ MIYAMA TOSHIYUKI & NEW HERD ORCHESTRA etc:Â “Toki â Eternity? â Epos” (Polydor â GR-1001) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Attached 4 paged Insert: Near Mint/ Separate insert: Mint/ OBI: Excellent ~ Near Mint). Rare original pressing copy with always missing insert and bloody rare OBI present!!! Heavy weight rarity alert!!! Released in 1971 and for some strange reason noted the Pokora book of rare discs.... Centered around 4 heavy weight free jazz drummers being Togashi Masahiko (Takayanagi Masayuki, We Now Create etc), H. Tanaka, Joe Mizuki (Takayanagi Masayuki collaborator) and I. Harada, this album steers from the start on into dark and dreamy series of slow shimmering soundscapes. The whole of the disc puts forth texture and mood combined with slow burning rhythm assaults. T. Miyama and New Herd Orchestra, who provide some austere atmospherics on flute and chimes, rendering the whole affair into a hallucinatory and deep listening experience, also flank the four skin manglers. They are responsible for making the drum kit only but a part of the total sonic palette, spreading it out between wide open expanses of gong swells, chiming bells, bowed metal, wood blocks and tinkling chimes. In all, the group churns out an organic drift impregnated with a midnight ambience, punctuated by strange bits of percussive flares, but spending most drifting through deep dark cavernous expanses of sound and breathing out amazingly deep and physical sounds that are comprised out of a slow burning series of drones and shimmers. Huge low-end reverberations underpin delicate drifting bells. The resonating sonics are given ample time to invade your listening space and hi-jack the ether. Scintillance high end sparkles bobble up at the rear end of your acoustical wave frequency’s periphery, super percussive skitter wraps around delicate melodic tom fills, occasionally sounding like a super slow abstract free jazz spread way out across the sound field, with some serious stereo panning to underscore the total outcome. It all blends into an amorphous maelstrom swerving from one speaker to the other, oozing out dizzying dreamy soundscapes of percussive melodic clatter and strange rhythmic textural. drones that subtlety transform into high-end infected free jazz splatter, a wash of sound that balances on a tightrope of dense TMT-like cacophony of deep sensory overload and the fine-spun swampland of submarine scintillation. Compressed fat rumblings build to propulsive percussive overload. In all this is just about as psychedelic as a disc can possibly get without the use of the ever-present fuzz guitar licks. The record fades into a barely there drone made up out of firefly-like flickering percussive drone-scapes, reverberating gongs, little squalls of spray-painting free jazz shuffle, all woven into a lovely Zen like exploration of a dark and mysterious world of rhythm and sound. Dense swirls of cymbal sizzle, brief squalls of tom toms swell and then fade, little bursts of tribal freak-outs are underpinned by dizzyingly minute splatters of hand drums and cymbal crash, strange textures become near drones, etc, just an intoxicating listening experience that has left me zoned out and in need for a quick oxygen fix every time I spin this sucker. Awesome and still totally undetected. Highest possible recommendation and a rare one with obi present. Price: Offers!!!! 2312. SATO MASAHIKO TRIO: “Palladium” (Express â EP-8004) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint/ OBI: Near Mint). Hardly ever seen before WHITE LABEL PROMO issue!! Classic Japanese free jazz monster. First original pressing of 1969!! The year of 1969 was the year that Japanese free jazz began to lift off (see We Now Create LP of Togashi Masahiko with Takayanagi, Motoharu and other heavyweights releasing the 1st free jazz LP in Japan) and blossom into a fierce musical power to be reckoned with. Legendary combos such as Togashi Masahiko/ Sato Masahiko's ESSG, Yamashita Yosuke Trio, Takayanagi Masayuki New Directions and Motoharu Yoshizawa Trio were soon responsible to be the originators of this new scene of sonic terrorists. Each of them released that year groundbreaking albums, colored by their own approach to jazz methodology and Sato Masahiko's fully made a mark for himself with this first album centered around him as a leader. The record eventually ended up receiving a jazz magazine's award and is since then regarded as a classic disc in Japan's free jazz pantheon. This album is quite remarkable and its take on free jazz is light years removed from the European and American scenes since it opened up sonic gateways to new unexplored territories. First of all it is quite avant-garde tinted in its execution of the material and juxtaposing it fusing it with a fresh influx of careful and delicately crafted improvisational interplay. Sato Masahiko plays prepared piano, Arakawa Yasuo caresses his bass with a bow and Togashi Masahiko enriches his percussive interplay with chimes and bells. The record opens up with an ethereal soundscape that suddenly merges into the Beatles' “Michelle”, sounding tenderly tense and pregnant with delicate thunders that remain concealed behind velvet curtains, making it one of the most sensitive and vulnerable song ever to be played by a free jazz combo. “Michelle” unfolds its hidden beauties over a span of 14 minutes before rolling into a collaboration of sonic molecules shifting in and out of focus and flowing as liquid and free as a mountain stream and meandering into the main theme again, al entwined around Sato's quicksilver-like mercurial bivalent playing. And this was so far only side one and the air is already getting thinner. Side two picks up where side one left off and takes you further along on a ride that showcases the virtuosic playing of the trio. In short, this disc is breathtakingly beautiful, brimming over with delicate improvisational interplay that will haunt you and keeps you begging again and again for more. Far removed from any other free jazz disc I know, this one gives you a peek at the other side of the spectrum, ear-bleedingly beautiful. A classic and monster in its own right. All time highest recommendation, WHITE LABEL PROMO ISSUE with OBI. Price: 550 Euro 2313. SATO MASAHIKO TRIO: “Deformation” (Express â EP-8005) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint). Rare and totally vanished 1st press original all complete with the yellow-colored Express Jazz Series OBI!! Copies with Obi are fucking seriously rare â haven’t had a copy with obi for over 15 years now. OK, if obscure and hard to track down Japanese avant-garde and free jazz is your thing then look no further. This disc, released in 1969 is a hard nut to come by since due to extremely poor sales only a handful of copies and some promo copies are known to have hit the streets, making it now one of the hardest free jazz documents to track down. But all this idle talk aside, it's the music that really counts. And it burns hardâ¦hardcore trio line-up consisting out of Sato Masahiko on piano, Arakawa Yasuo on bass and Togashi Masahiko on drums. Together they are responsible for unleashing a jaw-droppingly great amalgam-sounding explosion of disruptive energy. They trash out an entirely new Japanese free jazz methodology by incorporating enka and minyo tapes into the performance, rendering it into an otherworldly, if not almost eerie listening experience. Loud percussive crashes collide with rattling piano rolls that get underscored by blood-thumbing bass riffage. When all interaction gets mineralized into a minimalist excursion the minyo tape insertions dwarf into the foreground, making it all sound like rural traditions going bananas through an intravenous fix of avant-garde that gets nuked right into the bloodstream of the national subconscious. Chilling, lysergic, stupefying, and outward bound, this is some of the best freeform junk that came out of the archipelago. Comes with the never seen always-elusive OBI!! Highest recommendation. Price: Offers!!! 2314. SATO MASAHIKO & WOLFGANG DAUNER: “Pianology” (Express â ETP-9030) (Record: Near Mint/ Textured Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint). Rare first press issue. Original 1971 pressing. A clash of the titans, a meeting of heads continental Europe interlocking with a Japanese divine wind both driveling over the ivory keys. Normally the problem of a duo of piano players is always mostly a flight than an example of musical togetherness. Sato and Dauner however do complement each other in an amazing manner, inspiring each other in a way that is seldom heard or seen. The gel together in such a magnificent way that at times it is even hard to tell who of the two is leading since their “togetherness” is just too perfect and coherent. There are parts on this record where Dauner and Sato are playing their runs and cadenzas as precisely together as they were written and yet if you believe it or not everything here on display was completely and spontaneously improvised on the spot during the recording session. It is a fine match of temperaments, emotionally charged and pounding out free form gravity in harmonies high on a flexible drive aimed at piercing deep into uncharted space-ways. Stunning and jaw-dropping, 1st original pressing. Price: 150 Euro\n\n2315. The SAVAGE RESURRECTION: âS/Tâ (Mercury SR-61156) (Record: Excellent/ Jacket: Excellent ~ Near Mint). Original US pressing in sublime condition. âOne of the classic heavy psych albums, this is one that every fan of the genre seems to like. What makes the album so cool is that they have not one but two wild guitarists, and the dual lead guitars spew fuzz and feedback brilliantly throughout.â (excerpt – AM – Acid Archives). Awesome wild fuzz drenched psych snarler that rivals with all the best records of that time. Awesome and great copy to boot, just a shy away from NM, so EX all way round. Price: 200 Euro\n\n2316. The SAVAGES: “Live ‘N Wild” (Duane Records â DUANE ELP-1047) (Record: Near Mint â a minor dash away from absolute perfection/ Jacket: Excellent â has minor storage wear and an upper left corner blemish on back). Bloody rare 1966 US original pressing of all-time garage classic. Without a single doubt, this is one of the finest garage artifacts ever put down on wax and also one of the rarest, especially in a condition as this one here. All killer and no filler, every single track is a winner to my humble ears. Four teenage kids in Bermuda playing the hotel nightclubs for tourists wound up cutting one of the great live LPs of the era.Â Formed in 1965 in Bermuda, the band played teen functions and eventually were able to gain a residence at the Hub, a nightclub at the Princess Hotel where this album was recorded. This album is considered to be a seminal work by garage rock enthusiasts and collectors and is sometimes cited as one of the finest live albums in the genre. This is a solid garage album, with standout tracks being “Quiet Town”, “Nobody But You”, “The World Ain’t Round” and “No No No”. The jacket is fairly clean and in decent shape with only minor hardly wear and on the back an upper left corner blemish that makes the name above the picture hardly readable, so it gets a VG++~EX grading, still in great shape for a mostly trashed record. There are no splits, tears, writing or any other blemishes!! The record itself is also top notch, there are only a couple of light sleeve lines I can detect under a bright light, so again NM for this one as most copies are completely trashed and this one is one step away from NM~M. No audible defects as it plays with absolute high luster and with no audible defects. Almost impossible to find a copy as clean as this one here for a record that â if it surfaces and which is rare in whatever condition â is mostly always trashed. This could be your only chance to get such a close to perfect one into your mittens. Price: Offers!!!! 2317. SAVOY BROWN: “Blue Matter” (London/ King Records â SLC-294) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint/ Insert: Near Mint/ Obi: Excellent). Damned rare Japan 1st original press issue all complete with freakingly rare and almost never ever offered for sale before first issue OBI. White label PROMO issue. The third and ultimately greatest release by Kim Simmonds and company, and the first to feature the group’s most memorable lineup with Simmonds at helm, \"Lonesome\" Dave Peverett, Tony \"Tone\" Stevens, Roger Earl and the charismatic singer Chris Youlden to add icing to the cake. Blue Matter consists of an addictive mixture of blues covers and originals, with the first side devoted to studio cuts and the second a live club date recording. The high-water mark on this outing is the signature song by the band, the tour de force \"Train to Nowhere,\" with its patient, insistent buildup and pounding train-whistle climax. Additionally, David Anstey’s detailed, imaginative sleeve art further boosts this a notch above most other British blues efforts. Awesome music but sadly insanely rare Japanese original, this is the first time I could lay my hands upon a copy with obi that wasn’t trashed and even trashed ones are rare as a hen’s teeth. Highest recommendation. Price: Offers!!!\n\n2318. SAVOY BROWN: âHellbound Trainâ (London/ King Records – SLC-416) (Record: Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Mint/ Obi: Excellent). Hopelessly rare 1st original Japanese pressing – WHITE LABEL PROMO pressing – complete with impossible to get OBI. Killer UK psychedelic white trashy blues-rock. The Japanese issue with obi just never surfaces on these shores, believe me they are insanely rare and collectible. Sonic wise, it blows the UK press out of the water, stellar mastering and pressing quality back in the day. First time ever I see a 1st original Japanese pressing of this beauty with obi. Awesome. Price: 300 Euro\n\n2319. SAVOY BROWN: âStreet Corner Talkingâ (London/ King Records – SLC-381) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Insert: Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint). Rare 1972 Japanese first original pressing all complete with obi. Street Corner Talking is the seventh studio album by the band Savoy Brown. Released by Parrot in 1971, it was the first album released by the band since the departure of Lonesome Dave Peverett, Roger Earl, and Tone Stevens who all went on to form the band Foghat. This left Kim Simmonds as the only original member left in the group. Simmonds recruited a fresh lineup of musicians, which, in turn, ushered in a new sound for the band. things went a little smoother than he might have imagined, picking up piano player Paul Raymond, bassist Andy Silvester, and drummer Dave Bidwell, all from Chicken Shack. He also hired singer Dave Walker, who was the former frontman with the Idle race, and together the new lineup recorded Street Corner Talking, one of Savoy Brownâs finest moments. Gelling almost instantaneously, Walkerâs cozy yet fervent voice countered with Simmondsâ strong, sturdy guitar playing, and an exuberant mixture of British blues and boogie rock prevailed. All of the LPâs efforts are solid examples of the group's blues-rock power, from the slick cover of Willie Dixonâs\"Wang Dang Doodle\" to the deep feel of \"All I Can Do\" to the subtle strength of \"Tell Mama,\" Walkerâs best-sung tune. The album's blend of sultry guitar blues and upfront rock & roll flavor give it a multi-faceted appeal, with every musician contributing his talents uniformly, which is something that's rather difficult to achieve after there's been a wholesale change to the personnel. Price: 250 Euro\n\n2320. SCHAEFFER, PIERRE with GUY REIBEL: âSolfege De LâObject Sonoreâ RTF – Groupe de Recherches Musicales de lâO.R.T.F. – O.R.T.F. – SR2) (3 LP Set: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Individual LP Sleeves: Mint/ Thick Accompanying Book: Mint/ Outer Imprinted cardboard Box Set Sleeve: Near Mint). Original French 1967 pressing in TOP condition. Full title being âPierre Schaeffer – Trois Microsillons dâexemples sonores de Guy Reibel assiste de Beatrice Ferreyra illustrant le Traite Des Objects Musicaux et presentes par lâAuteur – realization du groupe de recherches musicales de lâO.R.T.F. – Editions du Seuilâ. The first achievement in 1967 included three LPs and a book containing the author's comments on each of the sound samples. This treaty summarizes Schaefferâs research conducted around sound phenomenon in its various aspects. This is an in-depth reflection on the nature of sound. Some of the themes are the timbre of the sounds and the concept of the musical instrument, the time limits of the ear, a typology of musical objects, and the four elements of music theory. It is primarily intended for those who work with sound material. The sound pieces themselves were conducted by Guy Reibel, Beatriz Ferreyra, Henri Chiarucci, François Bayle and Pierre Schaeffer himself. These investigations find their culmination in this ominous set here. The focus lies on sound accessing the stage of \"musical object\" when it meets certain criteria that make it \"appropriate\" to be used as music and it is presented here for the first time with the concept of \"reduced listening\". This revolutionary concept overturns traditional attitudes of listening to music, or even listening at all. It consisted of a radical form of listening, freed from source concepts (the origin of the sound) and the sense (cultural significance, in particular) in order to relate to its intrinsic characteristics, its material, hearing texture, shape. Today this Treaty is one of the most important reference in the theoretical musical research in the twentieth century. Original copy of legendary French box 3 LPs + booklet by the father of experimental avant-garde music. Complete original box from 1967 including 3 LPâs (in perfect condition) + cover + Book.

MANFRED SCHOOF: “European Echoes” FMP Records â FMP-0010) (Record: Excellent â Near Mint/ Top Loader Jacket: Excellent â no splits or damages, clean first issue fragile sleeve). Rare original FMP pressing, First issue with orange colored FMP label and 1st FMP design logo. Comes with 1st state jacket â top loader. First title following Bro Records on the FMP label, released in a tiny pressing of 250 copies or so. European Echoes carves out a distinct niche. BrÃ¶tzmann, Rutherford, von Schlippenbach, Niebergall, Bennink, Van Hove, Kowald, and Parker are all here, along with Derek Bailey, drummer Pierre Favre, saxophonist Gerd Dudek, pianist IrÃ¨ne Schweizer, bassist Arjen Gorter and trumpeters Enrico Rava and Hugh Steinmetz. That’s three trumpets, three saxophones, three pianos, three basses, two drummers, a trombonist and one hairy-assed guitar. Or, more succinctly put, a whole ton of firepower. The first release on the FMP label, that flowed out of the birth of Brotzmann’s Bro records imprint. Damned hard to score these days, 2nd press on FMP is common, but the first pressing with top loader sleeve and orange colored label is a true bitch to unearth. Really nice copy!!!!

SCIENTIST VS PAPA TAD’S:Â “AlliedÂ Dub Selection” (TAD’S â TRP LP 10180) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). Original 1stÂ pressing in exquisite condition.Â The Tad Dawkins & Jah Thomas produced dub album “Allied Dub Selection”, featuring dub versions mixed by Scientist and Papa Tad’s aka Tad Dawkins, was released in 1980. At the time of its release, the dub craze had ran its course and not that many dub sets were being released anymore. In 1974-74 the first handful of dub albums appeared, over the next few years followed by hundreds of dub albums as every producer maximized the financial return of his vintage riddims. Dub albums were usually pressed in very small quantities and disappeared quickly. This explains why so many vintage dub albums including this “Allied Dub Selection” are referred to as ‘rare’, which however says nothing about the quality of an album but it a head bobbing one, reefer time all day long.Â The excellent dub set from Tads featuring mad announcements from Striker Lee introducing each side of the vinyl as if it were a real clash. Â In fact, this is pretty much a JahÂ Thomas dub album, since all the rhythms are his cuts to NoÂ NoÂ No,Â BobyÂ Babylon, BobbyÂ Bowa,Â Mean Girl etc. and of courseÂ Heavenless, the foundation for his biggest hit TristonÂ Palma'sÂ Entertainment. These are mixed at King Tubby'sÂ by Scientist and sound as crisp as theÂ day theyÂ were mixed.Â Killer brain melting Dub classic. Price: 325 Euro 2324. SCIENTIST: âScientist In Dubâ (Jah Guidance – VPRLP-1007) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint – still in shrink). Damned scarce original Jamaican 1st press issue as released in 1981.

SCOTT, TOM:Â “Rural Still Life” (Impulse â AS-9171) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Mint â still housed in original shrink/ Insert: Mint/ Company Inner Sleeve: Mint/ Direct Import Obi: Mint). Top condition 1969 original 1stÂ press that comes with bloody scarce Japan Direct Import Obi and insert.Â “This 1968 LP from the early days of jazz fusion lacks the seamless merging of styles that would mark the commercial success of Tom Scott’s later career. Instead, the 19-year-old reed player and the members of his quartet careen all over the style map -- with varying degrees of success. The title track piles on electronic effects that turn Scott’s saxophone work and Mike Lang's keyboard playing into abrasive quacking. Scott’s \"Freak In\" continues the indiscriminate gimmickry, masking the respectable talents of the quartet. \"Juss Messin' Around\" is a faceless piece of mainstream jazz, while the lightweight treatment given \"Body and Soul\" trivializes a standard that has long been a rite of passage for sax players. On a more promising note, Scott’sÂ mid-tempo \"Song #1\" has an original melody and ambitious arrangement, including an effective overdubbed woodwind choir. This track, along with Scott’s \"With Respect to Coltrane\" -- a satisfying piece of modal hard bop -- helps redeem the session somewhat. At the time of this recording, ScottÂ was already a fixture of the Los Angeles studio scene.”Â (All Music Guide). Never seen this one with the first issue obi flashing proudly its colors! Price: 100 Euro 2326. SEA ENSEMBLE:Â “We Move Together” (ESP Disk â esp-3018) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint â still housed in original shrink). Top condition original pressing. Impossible to ever improve upon.Â The next-to-last new release on ESP-Disk before the label was shuttered in 1975, the Sea Ensemble's We Move Together harkens back to the label's mid-'60s avant-garde heyday. The husband-and-wife duo of Donald Rafael Garrett and Zussan Kali Fasteau rattles, strums, and bangs a variety of mostly percussion instruments, with bass, cello, clarinet, and piano sharing space with then-novel Asian instruments like the nye, shakuhachi (a Japanese bamboo flute), and sheng (a Chinese free reed instrument roughly akin to a pan flute). The four shorter pieces on side one explores a variety of moods and sounds, but the 20-minute epic on side two, \"Stork Cools Its Wings,\" builds to an almost violent climax before returning to its placid beginnings.Â Totally amazing LP, top condition, sleeve still housed in shrink!!Â Price: 75 Euro 2327. The SEA URCHINS: “Stardust” (Sarah Records â SARAH-609) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). 1992 original first pressing of classic slide! There two kinds of pop in the world: Sarah Records pop... and everything else. Perhaps that's a ridiculous over- simplification, but it's there is a point in that statement. Maybe the reason for this is that Sarah's sound has always been so insular, so compact. Sarah bands had a distinct style and always existed parallel to the label itself and The Sea Urchins, much like their fellow label mates The Orchids, are a perfect example of this. Their highly sought-after single,Â Pristine ChristineÂ was the first ever Sarah release and encompassed that Sarah sound, which was essentially just C86-esque indie pop with sunny melodies and lovelorn lyrics. This is just such a perfect summer record. However, songs like \"Cling Film,\" \"Summershine,\" and \"Everglades\" are just radiating sunlight themselves, so they can accommodate and bring a little warmth to any time of the year. Top shape!!! Price: 225 Euro 2328. SECOND LAYER: âWorld of Rubberâ (Cherry Red â red-14) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). UK original 1st pressing from 1981 by The Sound front man. While being active with the Sound, both Bailey and Borland broke rank in order to dabble in a minimalist, cold wave outfit that they baptized Second Layer. Borland added guitars and vocals while Bailey provided keyboards, bass and drum programming. Issued in 1981, the LP was blessed with an edgy, disconnected and detached sound. Melodic minimalism interacting with primitive musical technology that oozes out a barren wasteland like punk vibe. Not unlike a sullen Suicide or a stripped-down Dome, Second Layer made the most of basic set-ups, recording ten tracks including some sheer highlights in 'Distortion', the low-slung, grubbing swagger of 'Underneath the Glass'; in the scowling, gothic cruiser, 'Zero' - which could almost be a Joy Division outtake; the bass-saturated gloom of 'Black Flowers'. Bit of a no-brainer, this record. Get it or regret it! Price: 100 Euro 2329. SECRET: “S/T” (Secret Record â No Number) (Red Wax 10 inch Flexi Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). One of the rarest erotic sleaze artifacts to seep out of Japan â only the 2nd time ever I have a copy of this rarity, ungooglable and never to be discovered on the dreaded Discogs. Literally a secret record that saw the light of day at the tail-end of the 1960s in Tokyo and which was only sold under the counter of sex shops and strip joints. Listening to this oddball feels like sitting naked with your balls soaked in champagne and sucking on a Viagra spiked popsicle while indulging yourself and possibly even participating in a live peepshow event. Grunts, groans, whispers, and sexual intercourse, this literally is a sleazeball-cum-sexual overdrive live recording that caters perfectly to your sad, lonely, and secret lustful desires that shun the exposure to daylight. Deliriously rare peep/ sex shop related private press issue that was birthed out of the deepest bowels of Showa era Tokyo. Comes housed in killer art work! Price: 300 Euro\n\n2330. SECTION 25: “From The Hip” (Nippon Columbia â YX-7334-AX) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint/ Insert: Near Mint). Japan original first pressing from 1984. Blackpool outfit's Factory recording and quite simply has both sides of one of the most important record of the early shitty eighties in the wake of the fall out of New Order, Looking From A Hilltop. It was a more melodic, polished and musically eclectic venture as compared to their previous releases and saw the band sonically exploring further genres and dynamics. While some suggest mistakenly that by now they were more commercially driven, “From The Hip” does have a bit more hi-fi than low-fi seeping in as the band became more adventurous. There was a faint light ahead at the end of the tunnel it seemed back then and for that alone â in retrospect its worth price of admission alone, a b-boy electro classic which was a massive tune in Brooklyn at the time. Incredibly, still sounding completely contemporary, its hard to find words for a tune that has provided the backdrop to my teenage mischief so many years ago. Original Japanese pressing with obi. Price: 50 Euro\n\n2331. The SEEDS: âA Thousand Shadows b/w March Of The Flower Childrenâ (London Records/ King Records â TOP-1181) (Single Record: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Gatefold Picture Sleeve: Near Mint/ Company Inner Sleeve: Near Mint). Top condition Japan 1967 original â Japan only issue. Comes housed in unique Japan only gatefold picture sleeve that is just gorgeous. One of the rarest Seeds artifacts out there. Virginal condition! Price: 400 Euro. 2332. The SEEDS: “Pushin’ Too Hard b/w Try To Understand” (London/ King Records â TOP-1304) (7 Inch Single: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Gatefold Picture Sleeve: Excellent/ Company Inner Sleeve: Near Mint). Bloody rare 1968 Japan only single issue with Japan only picture sleeve design in top shape, just never turns up, first copy I see in over 15 years. The gatefold sleeve is also in great shape with some minor signs of age but without any damages. One of those harder to get Seeds releases. Price: 450 Euro 2333. The SEEDS: âA Web Of Soundâ (GNP Crescendo â GNPS-2033) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). First original 1966 US pressing in outstanding condition boxed GNP Crescendo logo â final upgrade copy. This was the Seeds second album and a big leap forward as compared to their crude-to-the-bone debut. Here, They push their sound towards a new frontier, happily keeping pace with their Los Angeles contemporaries Love and the Doors. But the Seeds sounded dirtier, a maxim that applies to A Web Of Sound even if it lacks singles as hard and filthy as \"Pushin' Too Hard.\" It is a proto-psychedelic trip, kicked off by the cheerful, swirling \"Mr. Farmer\" â the Kinks transplanted to a Middle American fable as refracted through the prism of the West Coast -- and \"Pictures & Designs,â. Expanded with downplaying grit and wasted sound floating on expansive organ-fueled pop fantasias, minor-chord stomps, elastic blues burners and veiled odes to drugs and sex, all wrapped up via the monumental live-in-the-studio workout \"Up in Her Room,\" a nearly 15 minutes of sneering tension and release. This could be Lou Reed's blueprint for \"Sister Ray\" which came out later that year. âUp in Her Roomâ takes a primordial riff that just keeps going, on and on as the Sky Saxon deliriously rants about sex and drugs while the backbeat gets louder and more subliminally distorted while simultaneously the tempo creeps up until by the end you are enslaved to this web of sound, a lysergic mashup of doped up garage psych of the highest echelon. Therefore, it feels that A Web Of Sounds is more thoroughly tied to 1966 than most of the Los Angeles rock of that year and that's is its blessing, it brings the era rushing back without looking ahead because it is all happening here and now. And yet, that transience is precisely why the album is so enjoyable. All the organs, all the minor-key riffs, all the desperate desire to be a star coalesce into a quintessentially L.A. trip, a harbinger of all the wasted good times that could be found on the Strip. Perfection from start to finish! Price: 175 Euro\n\n2334. The SEEDS: âFutureâ (GNP Crescendo – GNP-2038) (SEALED). Top condition, seal is 100% intact, NO damages, sharp corners, straight edges and fully readable spine. Original 1st pressing out of 1967 housed in heavy gatefold jacket in sealed condition, so I guess upgrading on this one will be out of the question. This album is just fantastic. Here the band had the audacity to experiment with record company money and studio downtime in order to squeeze out an utterly noncommercial but amazing disc that defines a isolated spot in space and time, alienating them from their garage pop audience but giving them instead all the underground credibility and a chance to align themselves with a new sound that would secure them a place in history, at least as far as my personal musical history is concerned. Saxon writes in the inner-sleeve essay \"Originations of the Flower Generation\" \"...The farmer lives by the elements alone, the sun, the rain, and the earth, but the earth needs its seeds to sow the flower generation of the leaf and crying there on the earth below\". It's heady stuff, the droning organ riffage, passionate sneering garage vocals of Saxon, fuzzed out guitars strung out on whatever was available, all of these elements permeates incessantly throughout the whole of the disc. The leadoff single, \"A Thousand Shadows\" is a fuzz-out and the rest of the album gives way to a very strange quest to sound complex. The complexities begin with the album cover with its gatefold and flower cut-outs and lushly printed photos, a Saxon-penned essay, all the works and no expenses spared. The music on the other hand displays a band allowed to run amok in a studio with the label footing the cost. This leads to a bizarre glee that permeates this album, from its whimsical and bewildering array of sound effects and exotic instruments, to the ultimately charming and naive playing and singing. Stunning album of which I cannot get enoughâ¦top & SEALED condition, Perfectly preserved original 1st 1967 pressing, etcâ¦Price: 275 Euro\n\n2335. The SEEDS: “In Concert” (King Records â SLC-219) (Record: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Insert: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Circular Obi: Near Mint ~ Mint). Bloody rare Japan only jacket design issue all complete with the insanely obi â this being the circular obi - as issued in November 1968. Top condition and monstrously rare! Easily the most PERFECT condition ever, just flawless and never had a copy this perfect â impossible to ever upgrade upon! Next to impossible to upgrade upon, the perfect copy with obi!!! The songs really were cut live to tape, with no overdubs and edits, and the Seeds sound plenty tight and enthusiastic here, with Sky Saxon’s vocals reaching a near-feral intensity on \"Satisfy You,\" \"Night Time Girl,\" and \"900 Million People Daily All Making Love,\" and Jan Savage’s guitar work cutting significantly deeper than in the original recordings of these tunes. A few new tunes were played at the \"live\" sessions, and \"Humble and Bumble\" and \"The Gypsy Plays His Drums\" aren't milestones in the Seeds’ catalog, but they attack the hits with force and commitment, and the almost-ten-minute rave-up on \"Up in Her Room\" is some sort of crazed triumph. Maybe not raw, but more alive than you think, and one of the Seeds’ best offerings. Price: Offers!!! 2336. SEIKATSU KÃJYÃ IINKAI: “S/T” (ALM Records â AL-10/ Ski No.1) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). Rare Japanese free jazz monster that was privately released but imported and prepared by the illustrious Kojima â ALM Label. The disc was pulled out the cloud of obscurity and granted with a re-appraisal by no-one else but SY7s own Thurston Moore, connoisseur par excellence who brought the existence of this gem back into view by listing it in his illustrious free jazz top 10 list of records you must lend your ears to. “FREE JAZZ of course made a strong impression on the more existential-sensitive populace of Japan. Some real masters came out of the Japanese scene and were influential to some of the more renowned noise artists of today (Boredoms, Haino Keiji). One such Jap-cat is alt-saxist Dr. Umezu who has mixed it up with NYC loft-dwellers on more than one occasion. On this completely obscure, underground release he unleashed some pretty free shit with the likes of William Parker (bass), Ahmed Abdullah (trumpet), and Rashid Shinan (drums). Parker is possibly one of the most important FREE musicians working in NYC. He's got his own constant writing/performing schedule as well as gigs with anyone from Cecil Taylor to Charles Gayle.” (Thurston Moore) In short, a killer disc, hopelessly obscure and almost impossible to obtain, almost a virginal copy. Highest recommendation. Price: 575 Euro 2337. SERPENT POWER: “S/T” (Vanguard â VRS-9252) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint â has small barely visible drill hole in upper right corner/ Company Inner Sleeve: Excellent ~ Near Mint). Top condition US first original pressing of West Coast folk/ psych masterpiece. Male/female psychedelia from 1967 on the Vanguard label featuring Dave and Tina Meltzer. With the Serpent Power, the \"San Francisco sound\" had coalesced into a sound that infused beat poetry with a combination of bluesier rockers and folk-influenced tunes with male and female harmonies. The songs themselves are quite good, with excellent band interplay and inventive electric guitar work. The heavier songs pack a good punch, while the lighter songs set a very airy, flowing mood, the epitome of what was then becoming known as \"flower power\". One of the highlights is \"Endless Tunnel,\" which was one of the first successful fusions of eastern-style song structure and philosophy and mixed it with western rock sensibilities. This sort of raga-rock had been tried earlier by San Francisco's Great Society, and, of course, the Beatles, but never had it been taken to such extremes on record, clocking in at over 13 minutes. The only other rock songs with similar ideas and effect were the Butterfield Blues Band's \"East-West\" and the Doors' \"The End,\" both released a year earlier.Â A classic!! Price: 275 Euro 2338. The SERVANTS: “She’s Always Hiding b/w Transparent” (Head â HEAD-1) (7 Inch Single Record: Excellent/ Picture Sleeve: Excellent). Heralding out of Middelsex, UK, The Servants debut originally released in 1986 on Head Records.Â Exquisite UK melancholic indie band that should have created a bigger splash in the pond. Has that distinct signature sound of that British mid-80s era drifting on a cloud of VU styled “Candy Says”& Syd Barrett fumes, injected with some jangling guitar lines that brings to mind the Byrds through a time warp. Brilliant debut that screams for more and more and more play! Highest recommendation. Price: 50 Euro\n\n2339. SEVENTH SONS: â4:00 A.M. At Frankâsâ (ESP – 1078) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Mint). Original 1968 US pressing of this psychedelic raga induced mind bender. Addictive and beautiful garage-basement psychedelic raga jams with Buzzy Linhart on guitar and vocals. Basement Eastern stuff with percussion and flute made up out of sidelong head spinning tracks and a cyclone cellar vibe brimming over with primitive anthropoid vibes and tribal cave man stomp that will put you in a naked dance trance. A classic. Price: 250 Euro\n\n2340. SEX PISTOLS: âAnarchy in the UK b/w I Wanna Be Meâ (EMI Records â 5C 006-06294) (Single Record: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Picture Sleeve: Excellent). Mega rare 1976 Dutch with wonderful picture sleeve. This was the EMI pressing, withdrawn after two weeks following the general sale & release. A unique, legendary and highly collectible Dutch pressing complete with its amazing and unique picture cover. There are one hell of a lot more UK pressings than 'Made In Holland' singles out there. The photograph on sleeve is from the same photo session as the 'Filth and The Fury' photograph which would accompany reports in the UK national newspapers following the Sex Pistols now legendary 'Today' program appearance, with Bill Grundy, on London Weekend television. Far nicer than the boring black UK sleeve, created to reflect the blank generation. Absolute killer 3mins 35 secs of glorious mayhem within the grooves of this wonderful, treasured piece of plastic. On the flip is, of course, the brilliant, and classic, âI Wanna Be Meâ. Stupidly clean original issue. They do not surface that often & this clean as this ball crusher here. Price: Offers!!! 2341. SEX PISTOLS: “Never Mind The Bollocks Here’s The Sex Pistols” (Nippon Columbia â YX-7199-AX) (Record: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint/ Insert: Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint). Rare Japan very first press issue with black colored upper side of the obi. Later issues have different and lighter coloring shade. Top condition and next to impossible to upgrade upon. Also, the sound quality and pressing of the first Japanese press issue is out of this world, giving it that extra full-frontal push in the sound. Awesome. Price: 250 Euro\n\n2342. SEXUAL NUDE SOUND:Â “Ai No Sasayaki” (Private Press) (33 RPM EP Record: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Inner Sleeve Design Jacket: Near Mint/ Outer Sleeve Envelope Design Jacket: Near Mint with closing flap still intact). Bloody rare Japan late 1960s underground porno cum release, micro edition that only hit the racks of a few well-connected under-the-counter porn shops. Price: 150 Euro\n\n2343. SHADOWS OF KNIGHT: “Shake b/w From Way Out To Way Under” (Buddah Records/ Nippon Columbia â LL-2202-DA) (7 Inch Single Record: Near Mint/ Picture Sleeve: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Company Inner Sleeve: Near Mint) Scarce Japan single issue by classic garage heroes â comes housed in cool Japan only sleeve art. Price: 150 Euro 2344. The SHADOWS OF KNIGHT: “Back Door Men” (Dunwich â 667) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). US 1966 original 1st press issue â WHITE label PROMO â MONO version. Possibly the best condition out there of this garage beast. A combustible collection of blazing blues covers and smoking originals. While there was still plenty of burning garage grit, the Shadows of Knight had already begun evolving stylistically. 'The Behemoth' was a fine slice of raga rock while 'Three for Love’ jangled in a decidedly folk-rock style. Of particular note is their cover of the garage classic 'Hey Joe.' One of many bands to record the song that year, the Shadows of Knight version took the up-tempo road and rendered a distinct rendition, albeit one with a very Byrds-ian chime. Such an amazing slide and top shelf virginally clean white label promo issue. Price: 300 Euro 2345. SHAMEK FARRAH AND FOLKS: “La Dee La La” (Ra Records â RA-103) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Near Mint). Pristine condition US first original pressing from 1978. A lost soul jazz/ spiritual jazz treasure â the legendary 3rd album from saxophonist Shamek Farrah, recorded after his first 2 sides for Strata East! The approach here is slightly different than that of the Strata sides â a bit more joyous and lyrical, with tunes that open up in waves of sound, color, and life â brightly pointing the way towards a new jazz vision that's really tremendous! Farrah's working here with an assortment of players from the east coast underground of the time â as well as Chicago stalwart Malachi Thompson on trumpet, the great Sonelius Smith on piano, and vocalist Ghanniya Green, who does some great Africanist scatting on the title track. Inspired by funky spiritual Afro-Latin soul with Latin vibes, percussion and horns, turning this slide into a resounding unique soul jazz groove. Preceding the '80s African jazz boom, \"La Dee La La\" features a lush, easygoing composition and arrangement, not unlike Abdullah Ibrahim's gentle Cape Town swing. After a bracing acapella chorus intro, pianist Saeed Amir introduces the chords, Lenny King and Roger Howell hit the hand drums, and Ghanniya Green sings the theme. Guitarist Harry Jenson plays silky rhythm, while Farrah's playful soprano sax composes festive variations. Playing a vocalesque plunger mute, trumpeter Abdullah Khalid makes a soulful statement, followed by Amir's elegant variations. The B side will throw you head first into some of the best Latin jazz grooves ever recorded. All of the compositions are astonishing songs, sparkling and vibrating towards an infectious groove.Â This LP has become a rare item, and the price of the original edition is soaring. The whole thing's incredible â an exuberant set of longer tracks that easily matches the best classics on Strata East from the 70s, and the kind of album that you will treasure for years!Â All original pressings have an invisible pressing fault on the B-side that causes one skipâ¦but apart from that default this copy looks untouched and utterly virginal. Impossible to find a better one. Price: Offers!!!\n\n2346. SHELAGH Mc DONALD: âShelagh McDonald Albumâ (Polydor – 2310.047) (Record: Near Mint/ Jacket: Excellent). Original 1970 German press of this fantastic female vocal psych folk album. I guess that most of you are familiar with the Shelagh Mc Donald story, of how she recorded two amazing beautiful albums before she had a bad acid trip experience and vanished from the face of the earth until she was discovered again in 2005 living in a trailer, cut off from the world for all that time. So I guess that everyone loves a good mystery and Shelaghâs one is cemented-in-time, almost a Nick Drake-ish combination of bathing beauty, unique musical talent and untarnished youthful promise that was cut short all of the sudden. It all began in the 1960s when McDonald managed to make her way down to London where she dove head first into the burgeoning British folk scene and simultaneously shifted also back and forth to Bristol, where the live folk club scene was also thriving. She started writing and performing her own music under the inspiration of Californian singer/songwriters like Joni Mitchell. Soon thereafter, she got noticed and picked up by Roberton who booked time for her in 1970 at Sound Techniques in London (studio run by legends Joe Boyd and engineer John Wood) to record songs for her first album, The Shelagh McDonald Album. She even got whilst recording it assistance from Nick Drakeâs arranger, Robert Kirby. Once canned, the album got great reviews. Melody Maker even wrote âWeâve been a long time waiting for a successor to Sandy Denny since she abandoned solo singing to join a band (Fotheringay), but at last, in the lovely form of Shelagh McDonald, someone has come forward to fill the solo singerâs place.â So high expectations and idle hopes, the album was bound to do well but instead it failed to live up to the publicâs insatiable appetite, at the time, for all things âfolk.â And failed to catch on, selling very few copies. The album was largely ignored upon its release. The music on the other hand is some of the most eye-popping UK female folk you will ever hear. This copy here is the very rare original 1970 German 11-track LP with arrangements by Robert Kirby, the man responsible for the arrangements on Five Leaves Left & Bryter Layter. The overall affair is housed in a laminated picture sleeve. Price: 150 Euro\n\n2348. SHEPP, ARCHIE:Â “Live At Donaueschingen Music Festival” (MPS Records â YP-7006-MP) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Excellent/ Obi: Near Mint). Damned rare 2nd press issue from 1973, complete with rarest OBI variation, first time I see this variation. One can argue that 1967 was Archie Shepp's peak year. In a way I adhere to this (although that his career was filled with peaks, just see his output on the Actuel/BYG label a couple of years later) with recording of one of his most out there albums \"The Magic of Juju\". Still, \"Live at the Donaueschingen Festival\" can be seen as some sort of an extent to which the Juju magic sound translates live. Split over two sides, the album gives some insight into one spun out piece. Archie Shepp's solos are frequent and extreme and are about to adhere a new meaning to the term Fire Music. Still not all is heavy breathing free shronk, there are also quieter moments with Grachan Moncur III, Roswell Rudd and Jimmy Garrison interlocking in some mesmerizing interplay. Also interesting is he audience’s reaction which at best can be described as emphatic. Some of them are awestruck, some are obviously put off. I guess it was just the impact of this new unheralded tsunami of free interplay that took them by surprise after having being subdued by middle of the road modal jazz for the last two decades. Again a classic in the free jazz canon, this is the rarest obi version of this LP, never has crossed my path with obi until now. Price: 100 Euro\n\n2350. SHEPP, ARCHIE & PHILLY JOE JONES: âS/Tâ (Columbia – XMS-161-AX) (Record: Mint/ Heavy Japan Only Gatefold Jacket: Mint/ Obi: Mint). Rare Japanese issue, this being the never offered before test pressing of this disc. Comes with never seen first press issue OBI. Killer free jazz blast with Archie Shepp on tenor, taking you on a tour of duty, which will be an unforgettable one. Backed up by some star heavy weight players, the group breaks into a line rhythm, as Shepp and Philly Joe Jones blend in. Line up includes Earl Freeman on bass, Leroy Jenkins on violin, Julio Finn on harmonica, Anthony Braxton wielding the alto-sax and Chicago Beau vocals. In totality, this is a mad, black and wild ever-twirling vortex of heavy fire music breathing out supersonic hardcore jazz, embalmed into a raging ball of fire that is belched out as a collective effort filled with lone scrams. Killer with absolutely no filler. Rare never seen before Japanese test press issue housed in a Japan only heavy-duty gatefold jacket. Price: 150 Euro\n\n2351. SHEPP, ARCHIE: “Poem For Malcolm” (BYG/Nippon Columbia â BYG-16) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Attached Insert: Near Mint/ Obi: Excellent). Scarce Japan original of classic slide all complete with obi. Again, another instant classic. For this one Shepp gets flanked by Burton Green (piano), Alan Silva (bass), Claude Delcloo (drums), Philly Joe Jones (tympani), Grachan Moncur III (trombone), hank Mobley (tenor), Vince Benedetti (piano), Malachi Favors (bass). Total brilliance on black shiny gold. A killer that takes no prisoners and does not surrender. Awesome!!! Price: 150 Euro\n\n2352. SHEPP, ARCHIE: “Yasmina, A Black Woman” (BYG/Nippon Columbia â BYG-4) (Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Attached Insert: Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint). Scarce Japan original of classic slide all complete with obi. This is one of those all-time classics, one of those discs that helped to define a genre. The line-up on this vicious blaster consists out of Clifford Thornton (cornet), Lester Bowie (trumpet), Arthur Jones (alto), Archie Shepp (tenor & voice), Roscoe Mitchell (bass sax), Dave Burrell (piano), Malachi Favors and earl Freeman (bass), Philly Joe Jones (drums), Sunny Murray (drums), Art Taylor (Rhythm logs), Laurence Devereaux (balafon), hank Mobley (tenor). Wow, this is hardcore, all incinerating shit. Practically reads as a who is who of the free jazz world, Art Ensemble is also present, all the heavy weights of the scene interact with each other taking this baby to previously unreachable spiritual heights. Ultimate classic, totally mint and original Japanese press with rarely seen obi. I must be insane of letting this one goâ¦.Price: 150 Euro\n\n2353. SHEPP, ARCHIE and the Full Moon Ensemble: âLive in Antibes Vol. 1â (BYG Records – BYG-32) (Record: Mint. Fold Out Jacket: Mint/ Insert: Mint/ Obi: Mint) Actuel 32. Another brain ripper, the first volume, preceding the one listed here below. Every album Shepp did for the Actuel label is a killer and sounds like no other free jazz record ever to be put down on wax. They are all classics. On this one he gets aided by luminaries like Alan Shorter (Fluegelhorn, voice), Clifford Thornton (valve trombone, shenai, piano), Archie Shepp (tenor, piano, voice), Joseph Dejean (guitar – just vicious), Beb Guerin (bass), Claude Delcloo (drums). Recorded live in concert at the seaside resort Juan-les-Pins (hard to imagine that these guys ever ripped through the night skies there seen the snobbery status of the town now). Stellar free music, a must. Superior sound and vinyl quality as opposed to the French issue, you will be in for an audiophile surprise here. Price: 150 Euro\n\n2354. SHEPP ARCHIE and the Full Moon Ensemble: âLive in Antibes Vol. 2â (BYG Records – BYG-34) (Record: Mint. Fold Out Jacket: Mint/ Insert: Mint/ Obi: Mint) Actuel 34. Another brain ripper, the successive volume to the one listed here above. Every album Shepp did for the Actuel label is a killer and sounds like no other free jazz record ever to be put down on wax. They are all classics. On this one he gets aided by luminaries like Alan Shorter (Fluegelhorn, voice), Clifford Thornton (valve trombone, shenai, piano), Archie Shepp (tenor, piano, voice), Joseph Dejean (guitar – just vicious), Beb Guerin (bass), Claude Delcloo (drums). Recorded live in concert at the seaside resort Juan-les-Pins (hard to imagine that these guys ever ripped through the night skies there seen the snobbery status of the town now). Stellar free music, a must. Price: 150 Euro\n\n2355. SHEPP, ARCHIE: “Yasmina, A Black Woman & Live At The Panafrican Festival” (BYG Records/ Toei Geion â YX-9003~4) (2 LP Record: Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint/ Obi: Near Mint). Clean and nice Japan 1st press original all complete with rare obi. To make it all a bit more salacious, this is a WHITE label PROMO issue. Combining two of Shepp’s most incendiary slides for the BYG/ Actuel imprint, this baby burns holes into your membranes, fire music indeed â killer and indispensable. Price: 50 Euro 2356. SHEPP, ARCHIE:Â “Live In San Francisco” (Impulse Records â A-9118) (Record: Near Mint â has 2 faint non-sounding hairlines on side one/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint ~ Mint/ Company Inner Sleeve: Near Mint). Original US first MONO pressing. Hard to come by clean MONO pressing â housed in virginal gatefold sleeve. A great counterpart to some ofÂ Archie Shepp's studio albums for Impulse â a live date recorded in San Francisco, with a slightly freer, sharper edge! The sound is almost free at times, but always with that strong sense of focus that Archie brought to his brilliant work of the time â and the group's a well-honed ensemble who really understand each other’s motivations and inspirations âÂ Roswell RuddÂ on trombone, Donald GarrettÂ andÂ Lewis WorrellÂ on bass, and Beaver Harris on drums â all almost working at an ESP level together. Shepp plays a bit of piano on the record â in sharply angular tones that are almost more modern than his tenor â and titles include \"The Wedding\", \"Wherever June Bugs Go\", and \"Keep Your Heart Right\". Price: 150 Euro 2357. SHEPP, ARCHIE: âThree For A Quarter One For A Dimeâ (Impulse â AS-9162) (Record: Excellent ~ Near Mint/ Gatefold Jacket: Near Mint). Clean as can be US first original pressing of all time fave Shepp slide! âSheppâs main contributions to jazz were an adventurous spirit and the introduction of a forceful, raspy sound that, even with its debt to Ben Webster, was quite original -- unlike many of his contemporaries in the avant-garde, he owed nothing to John Coltrane. Shepp and his regular quintet of 1966, which also includes trombonist Roswell Rudd, drummer Beaver Harris and bassists Donald Garrett and Lewis Worrell really stretch out on this live blowout, playing continuously for nearly 33 minutes.
