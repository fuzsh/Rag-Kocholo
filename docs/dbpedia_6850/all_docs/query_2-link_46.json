        "text": "Cameron Brown: I’ve grown accustomed to my bass\n\nFirst published in Jazz’halo 1998 (#3 & #4)\n\nJazz'halo Music Days Gouvy 1997 © Jos L. Knaepen\n\nSheila Jordan sang it as the encore to the closing concert of Jazz’halo Music Days in De Werf in Bruges on November 11, 1997. It was a duo performance with string bass player Cameron Brown - \"Cam\" as Sheila and others call him - their first live concert together. An old dream turned reality: the recording may be released on the Jazz’halo label next year.\n\nFor Cameron Brown (born 21.12.1945), this annual music event was his debut as bandleader.\n\nTHE MISUNDERSTANDINGS\n\nCameron is very dexterous, but especially with his left hand.\n\n\"There is a lot of misinformation about me but that one I never heard before. If you want to play lefthanded you have to change round all the strings, so that the G-string, for example, is where the E-string normally is. Once, in Sweden, I did meet a left-handed bassist\" - he no longer remembers his name - \"who hadn’t adapted his bass. But just like my father, I’m a little bit ambidextrous. You actually have to be. If you play a string instrument like bass or guitar, both your hands do just as much work.\"\n\nCameron worked with the Mingus Dynasty.\n\n\"Another one of those publicity stunts. I never played with them or under that name. One evening I did play as a substitute with the Mingus Big Band, but that is a (chronological) step further on, the next memorial project by Sue Mingus, who was going to sue us for using that name. There was a third ex-Mingus band member in the quartet of George Adams and Don Pullen (see below) - drummer Dannie Richmond. As a bassist it was pretty logical that I never played with Charles.\n\nI did collaborate on Dannie's \"Plays Charles Mingus\" record from 1980 (with Jack Walrath - trumpet, Ricky Ford - tenor sax and Bob Neloms - piano, all Mingus alumni). I also recorded \"The Last Mingus Band\" for Timeless with Ricky. All those associations with the earlier Mingus bands and so soon before his death (05.01/1979) made Sue suspicious. She thought that we would pocket part of her rights by using the name \"Mingus Dynasty\". George tried to convince Sue of his and our innocence and that it was the organizers who hoped to see higher ticket sales by sowing confusion about Charlie’s name.\"\n\nOscar Pettiford was Camerons greatest influence.\n\n\"I heard him as a young man (the recording is from Dec. 23, 1956) on Monk's Brillant Corners record, where Oscar plays a beautiful solo on that bluesnumber (it takes a little before we manage to find the right name: \"Ba-lu Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are\"). I use that solo in my teaching. But actually... I was very strongly influenced by two other bassists at that time: Mingus and Paul Chambers, Paul mainly. He is somewhat underrated., the real modern swing feeling for me was his teaming with drummer Philly Joe Jones, even before the arrival of Tony Williams.\"\n\nWITHOUT MISSING A BEAT: THE TIN CAN BASS\n\nBy degrees you are more on your guard - but nevertheless you risk one more new misunderstanding or half-truth: did Cameron really buy his first bass in Sweden?\n\nCam, grinning: \"True. True. Oh yes, that’s true. And that’s a funny story - maybe too long, but anyhow. I was born in 1945, so in 1959 I was in high school. At that time it still wasn’t the usual thing for school dances to be livened up by rock and roll bands. In Detroit (the town where he was born and grew up) they still had all those little-ten-piece-trying-to-be-Glenn-Miller bands. In my school all the bass players were girls, but it wasn’t the done thing to have a female bassist in a dance orchestra.\"\n\nNot even by 1960?\n\n\"No. The boys hung around with the boys and the girls with the girls. Now someone had a bass - the body was in brown painted sheet iron - a tin can bass, in fact. Only the neck was wooden. No resonance: you couldn’t really hear the notes. You did get a pretty bonk - toum, toum, toum,\" Cam demonstrates. \"I had a gentle character and when a volunteer bassist was wanted, I was put forward and eventually convinced. Which didn’t stop me feeling very attracted by the bass. At first I played clarinet, but they gave me this tin can bass. I took it home and taught myself how to play it, at the expense of damaged and bleeding fingers. But after a month I played along at a New Year’s bash. That’s how it all started.\"\n\nFor the next two years Cameron played with the big band at school dances. Then, as a senior, he played bass in the band and clarinet in the classical orchestra, gaining a great deal, and a wide range, of experience. In addition, the school did have some quality double basses. And Cameron graduated.\n\n\"When I graduated I went to Sweden - I was an exchange student for a year. The problem was that I didn’t own a bass, but I had saved a couple of hundred dollars and I bought a German instrument for $300. After a year I went back to New York, to Columbia University, as a freshman.\n\nTo start with I stayed there from summer 1963 to summer 1964. Then I dropped out for a while, though I would end up completing my studies later on. The opportunity that presented itself was way too tempting.\"\n\nDon Cherry, Roma 1979 © Nina Contini Melis\n\nGEORGE RUSSELL AND DON CHERRY\n\nThe George Russell recording \"At Beethoven Hall\" (31.08.1965) - the concert hall in Stuttgart - was a milestone in Cameron Brown’s career and, in retrospect, also in jazz history. Alongside Russell and Brown, the George Russell sextet included drummer Al Heath, trumpeter Bertil Lövgren, trombonist Brian Trentham, tenor saxophonist Ray Pitts and guest Don Cherry.\n\n\"I was 19 at the time, and to me Cherry was awe-inspiring, magic, and he had an approach to music that was entirely new for me. In the spring of 1966 I took the place of Jean-Francois Jenny-Clark in Don's quintet. Gato Barbieri, Karl Berger and Aldo Romano were also in the band. We did two weeks in the old Montmartre Jazzhus in Copenhagen. This was just an unbelievably exciting band. It played everything from Charlie Parker tunes to Ornette Coleman tunes to Albert Ayler tunes; we played bossa nova, standards and bebop. You heard snippets of all of these in a single set, and the interaction between the band members was so phenomenal that everyone knew where to go at any given moment. In those days Coltrane played 40-minute solos; with us that time-span meant a set of short solos full of surprising transitions, a spontaneous montage of the highlights from the second half of jazz history. Miles did something similar: he also made collages and medleys, but he used his own music.\"\n\nLater, in the United States, Cameron had the opportunity to play twice a week in the Village Vanguard with Don Cherry. The first time (1985) it was with a variety of settings, with players including tenor saxophonist Jim Pepper (one of the few Indian jazz musicians), the second time was with a quartet: Don, himself, Carlos Ward. There are recordings of these sessions that have not yet been released.\n\nThe Beethoven Hall recordings mentioned above were initially released on two LP’s (MPS/Saba 15059 and 15060). They were recently re-released by Polygram on one CD (MPS 539 084-2) as \"At Beethoven Hall / Complete Recordings\". They do not include any additional material. However, we are now slightly ahead of ourselves on the Brown story.\n\nIn the spring of 1965, Cameron met trombonist Brian Trentham from Indianapolis. The summer before he had played with George Russell at the Newport Festival. That was during the afternoon concert on July 3, 1964, under the title \"New Faces in Jazz\". It was a strong group, with Thad Jones, John Gilmore, Steve Swallow and Albert Heath alongside Russell and Trentham. And a vocalist. Photographer Burt Goldblatt was an attentive listener: \"George Russell’s sextet was outstanding, from “Outer View” to “Stratusphunk”, “D.C.” and “Divertimento”. Then Sheila Jordan joined them for the old country music standard, written by the former governor or Texas, Jimmie Davis: “You Are My Sunshine”. Her singing was brilliant and vital.\"\n\nLYDIA IN SWEDEN\n\n\"In autumn 1964, George (who had already recorded \"New York, N.Y.\", \"Jazz in the Space Age\", \"Ezzthetics\" and \"The Stratus Seekers\") went to Europe and became seriously ill in Stockholm. He was bedridden in hospital for about six months and I thought that he had caught tuberculosis. But when he recovered he was offered a lot of work in Sweden and also for the radio, where he was given carte blanche for a series of larger works.\n\nGeorge stayed in Sweden until 1969, and Brian Trentham came over for a year in 1965. And I played in the Cascall Mountains in a band in a country club. Lew Soloff was the trumpeter there, he laughs just as crazy as he is now, wonderful guy ...\n\nThen there was a telegram from Brian in Sweden. He had recommended to George Russell that he have me come over for the summer of '65. I wasn’t even twenty, I wasn’t ready for it. We went to the Molde festival, you could only get there with a Hovercraft at that time, and there was only one bass at the festival: the one belonging to Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. Niels was then already one heck of a lot more advanced than I was, even though he was five months younger. He played with Lars Gullin and others, and I worked with Donald Byrd, Booker Ervin and George. I also had the opportunity to play with Albert Heath: a dream. I don’t know if he was so excited to play with me ...\"\n\nAnd then came Beethoven Hall.\n\n\"Russell didn’t perform a great deal. He had decided on a set fee, and there was no point in people asking him if they could not pay that much. The radio paid well.\"\n\nIn those days Russell also played a concert in the PSK in Brussels, without Cameron, but with Lövgren, Eje Thelir, trombone, Bernt Rosengren, tenor sax, the Polish bassist Roman Dylag and Tootie Heath on drums. This was on the occasion of the BRT broadcasting company’s XIVth Jazz Panorama (1966).\n\nStill in Sweden, Brown worked with the tenor saxophonist Bill Barron. Back in the United States, they would make a recording for Savoy. Bill had already recorded three LP’s for the label, including two with Ted Curson in 1961 and one with Booker Ervin a year later. But, the drummer didn’t turn up and the session was cancelled.\n\nLARGELY TRUE OR A LITTLE FICTITIOUS?\n\nCameron Brown had been in the recording studio with Cherry and Russell, but the Hall of Fame was still a long way off. He plays a lot, has interesting gigs, and during his process of maturation meets a number of musicians who you would not so readily associate with each other, or who are not well known to us, or completely unknown.\n\nWhat then is the encyclopedic truth?\n\nCameron Brown worked with Dave Liebman and Randy Brecker.\n\n\"No I didn’t play that much with them. I was in Dave’s very first band and so was Randy. We made a demo, played some gigs, we even won a competition, nothing more. That was in 1968. I had already met Randy because he knew Brian (Trantham) well.\"\n\nTed Curson?\n\n\"End sixties there was a funny little club on the corner of 69th Street and Broadway called ‘La Bohème’. Nobody ever went there and I formed the house rhythm section with drummer Jimmy Lovelace. We played there in a trio with Booker Ervin, with Ted Curson. Once when I was free, it was after midnight, I got a phone call from there. Lee Konitz was there with Lovelace. They had sent that evening’s bassist home and asked me to come and play the last set. There was one customer and even then he fell asleep in the middle of a number. This is completely undocumented history.\"\n\nWho was Barry Miles?\n\n\"How do you know all this ancient history?\n\nBarry was a pianist (and also a drummer on his first record) who had various bands over the years and recorded with them. There were also some famous cats: Duke Jordan, then Lew Soloff, Robin Kenyatta, Lew Tabackin (along with Pat Martino and John Abercrombie), Harvey Swartz, Vic Juris, ... There was also an unbelievable drummer, Don Perutio, who played in our band for a number of school dances, but never wanted to be a professional player.\n\nBarry Miles, I think he is now musical director for Roberta Flack. Michael Cuscuna once wrote a review of a concert we played, Wesleyan College in Connecticut I think. At that time Sam Rivers and Robin Kenyatta were on horns. That was the first time that my name appeared in the ‘Caught in the Act’ column in Down Beat.\"\n\nThree years ago you stepped out of the music business.\n\n\"In 1969 I finished college - it had taken me six years including that break in Sweden. Everyone who graduated then went straight to Vietnam - at least if you were a man. In April we had all considered the question: ‘Which of you really wants to go to Vietnam?’ However, the mayor of New York had an agreement with the army recruitment service that whoever taught in NYC would be exempt from military service. But none of us had a teaching diploma. In the summer the city organized an intensive course and that was our salvation. I taught in the South Bronx for three years - quite an experience! I did try to play a couple of weekends, but I was continually exhausted by those kids. If you wake up at five in the morning in a cold sweat thinking: ‘What am I gonna do with those kids today?’, there is little energy left to play. Teaching is one of the most difficult jobs in the world. And even trickier in a junior school in the worst district in the whole of the country!\"\n\nAfter his school adventure, in 1972, Cameron formed a ‘band on the road’ with friends, with performances including an appearance in the ‘Blues Brothers’ film.\n\n\"We earned the money to get a van, sound equipment, a Fender-Rhodes piano. We were no longer dependent on what the organizer had ‘on offer’. In 1974 our pianist Mitchell Cupper had a job with a singer, John Lucian, who had an underground hit on RCA-Victor, \"Rashida\", which sold 50,000 singles without any promotion whatsoever. John was ‘a very sexy singer’ from the Virgin Islands. I worked with him in a club on the top floor above the Village Gate - thirteen weeks in a space filled to capacity. Of course that wasn’t jazz; more Latin-based. I recorded \"Mind’s Eye\" with him for RCA - a collector’s item and the only recorded example of my work on electric bass!\"\n\nwith Sheila Jordan, Jazz'halo Music Days 2002 © Jos L. Knaepen\n\nSHEILA\n\n\"In 1974 I met Sheila, Sheila Jordan. She arranged a gig on Long Island where we performed every Wednesday with a pianist, Johnny Napp. Meanwhile, she was preparing a recording with Roswell Rudd that he was going to record for Arista (\"Flexible Flyer\", Arista AL1006, now out on CD on Black Lion BLCD760215, March 1974). His pianist, Hod O’Brien, had come into some money, and opened a club on the corner where 7th Avenue South used to be and Leroy Street. It was a very difficult year with disasters such as a water level that rose to one meter during a flood, not so good for the piano. But for a period of six months Hod, Beaver Harris and myself formed the house rhythm section for the soloists we hired, not such a normal set-up for the New York club scene then. Or now. Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Charlie Rouse, Pepper Adams, Chet Baker and Bob Mover played with us two days a week, in other words Downtown. At weekends they played Uptown with their own group.\n\nA year later (July 12-13, 1975) \"Confirmation\" was recorded with Sheila (East Wind EW 8024) in the Vanguard Studios on 23rd Street, where Joe Lovano lives these days. It was a nice big studio and the sound engineer was David Baker, who is now doing the engineering for these Jazz'halo Music Days recordings. Beaver Harris was the drummer.\"\n\nSHEPP\n\n\"I didn’t work with Shepp for so long, but we recorded a lot relatively speaking. Jimmy Garrison was really sick, so Beaver Harris suggested me as a stand-in to Archie. He invited the then Shepp backing to the ‘St. James Infirmary’, Hod’s club. And the summer of 1975 was immediately a ‘boom’ for me: it was as if I had stepped out of obscurity. I flew with Archie to Europe, straight to Montreux, where we recorded two records for Arista, which was really a big jazz label then, simply titled \"Montreux One\" and \"Montreux Two\" (July 18, 1978) (Arista AL-1029/Black Lion 741027CD, vol. 1 / Arista AL-1034, vol. 2).\n\nAt the time the band included trombonist Charles Greenlee, pianist Dave Burrell, myself and drummer Beaver Harris. Michael Cuscuna had also flown over as producer. That summer I spent a month or so with Shepp. We also recorded \"A Sea of Faces\" in Milan (August 4-5, Black Saint BSR0002), but I also had a number of gigs with Roswell Rudd and the same rhythm section and then we did \"That Laren-Middelheim thing\" (with Rudd as well as Sheila Jordan) in August.\n\nShepp was very popular in France and when we returned we recorded during the Massy festival (Uniteledis UNI22975YX2 - October 24, 1975) with the Montreux line-up.\n\nWe went back in January '76 - they flew us all over France, all the big cities. But we also did Germany: we recorded \"Steam\" in Nuremberg (May 14, 1976) with Shepp and Beaver in a trio setting. It was a festival with musicians from Eastern Europe too (the East-West Festival) (Enja CD 2076), and a month later we were in Oslo with the Norwegian singer Karin Krog (Compendium/Meantime MR3, June 23, 1976). I play on just one piece with the Norwegian bassist Arild Andersen.\n\nIn the summer Shepp came trotting along with a three-month Euro-Rail Pass for each of us. Now, that was a bit much, Shepp didnít have so much more work for us, but he thought that we could fill in our free time travelling around Europe. But I had a family to feed, and I could hardly spend my cents on unnecessary hotel bills. And that was when I met Blakey.\"\n\nART AND BACK TO ARCHIE\n\n\"Blakey had had to leave his rhythm duo behind in London. Pianist Mickey Tucker and bassist Chris Amberger were arrested (incorrectly, it turned out) for possession of cocaine. It was the band with Bill Hardman and Dave Schnitter. He signed me for the rest of the tour plus a Dutch pianist. He had wanted to have me before: I heard about you - I want you in the band.\"\n\nAfter a month they had to go to New York for a festival, returning immediately: Perugia, Nice, ... Cameron stayed with Art.\n\n\"In the beginning I was eating brown rice, at the end I was drinking cognac and eating steak. I stayed with the band six months - also back in the USA: a week in Chicago, a week in Detroit, a week in Montreal, five weeks in Japan - even in New York there was no time for the family. After that half year non-stop I was completely washed out, and I left Blakey at the end of 1976.\"\n\nThe Doublet Jazz History, a record including versions of \"Come Sunday\" and \"My Favorite Things\", was made just before this.\n\n\"That was a funny story, I have millions of them ... There was always a quarrel between Bill (Hardman) and Mickey (Tucker) on the one hand, and Blakey on the other. We were on tour in Japan and we made this recording with Mickey and a Japanese drummer (Toshio Osumi). Mickey was so mad with Art that he wanted to leave the group. So, Blakey wakes up in the morning and finds a letter: ‘I’m leaving, Bu. Bu(haina) couldnít believe it. That evening we had to play the most important concert of the whole tour, but Mickey really had gone. There was no pianist that evening, Blakey was furious. ‘Don’t no one monkey stop no show!’ (Cameron roars with laughter). And he played as if there was a pianist, he didn’t change the song arrangements whatsoever. For the last three concerts of the tour we had a Japanese pianist. Then I called Shepp and he had another tour arranged for January 1977. So I went along, and I stayed with him till the beginning of 1976.\"\n\nIn October he made three records with Shepp in a week: October 12, \"The Tradition\" with Clifford Jarvis (Rome), Horo HDP 13/14, LP; October 18, \"Parisian Concert 1/2\" with Siegfried Kessler, Sun SR114 & SR117, and on October 19 \"Touch of the Blues\" with singer Joe Lee Wilson and Kessler (Paris), Fluid 102.\n\nEarlier that year there was also the \"Rising Sun Collection\" (RSC 0005) including Charlie Persip on drums, and others (April 12, 1977).\n\nJUST KEEP ON TOURING\n\nIn the summer of '78 there is another tour, this time with Terumasa Hino. Matthias Winckelmann (Enja) made two recordings, under Mal Waldron’s name and with Hino and Steve Lacy, \"Moods\" (enja ENJ3021) (May 6, 1978), and with Bob Degen and the Hinoís (Terumasa and his brother Motohiko on drums), \"Children of the Night\" (enja ENJ3027) (May 16, 1978). Hino was also with Cameron back in New York, and with others, including Lew Soloff, Gary Valente, Ricky Ford and Marty Ehrlich on George Russellís \"New York Big Band\" recording (Soul Note SN 1039, August 16, 1978). He also made \"The Last Mingus Band\" with Ford (Timeless).\n\nMet Beaver Harris, Heist op de Berg, 6 juni 1979 © Jef Vandebroek\n\n\"In 1979 I made the big summer tour with Beaver. First there was a memorial concert for Lennie Tristano, where I worked with Sheila and Harold Danko. And then Beaver. With Grachan Moncur III, Ken McIntyre, Beaver and myself. We made five records in a few days - one was never released. There was \"Live at Nyon\" (Cadence CJR 1002, June 14, 1979), two for Red Records (\"360 Aeutopia\", with Massimo Urbani, Red VPA-148, June 20, 1979) and \"Safe\" (Red VPA-151, June 22, 1979) and one more for Soul Note, \"Beautiful Africa\" (Soul Note SN1002, June 23/25, 1979), canned in Milan, as with the Red LP’s. The pianist on the first two is the not so well known Ron Burton.\n\nIn his 360 Degrees Experience, Beaver also used Don Pullen. Pullen wanted to play more freely and Beaver liked that too. Since I had gained experience and practiced a lot with both of them, a new opportunity fell out of the sky. Pullen got a phone call from Vim Vickt (Wim Wigt ...) to set up a quartet with George Adams. Dannie Richmond was the drummer, but there wasn’t a bassist straight off. A recommendation from Don sorted out the problem ... I thought it was for a tour but it turned out to be a very intense project, which would last almost ten years.\"\n\nDon Pullen & George Adams, Brugge De Werf, 14/10/1987 © Jan Vernieuwe\n\nADAMS - PULLEN\n\nAdams-Pullen-Brown-Richmond - that was a success formula. During this decade, Cameron Brown is often surrounded by ex-members of the group of the now deceased Charlie Mingus (see above).\n\nThey did not make recordings for Timeless straight away, but the first clues to their existence were put down in Milan for the labels Palcoscenico (\"Funk\", November 2, 1979, PAL 15002 and \"More Funk\", November 3, 1979, PAL 15003) and Soul Note (November 2/3, 1979, \"Don’t Lose Control\", SN1004). Another stay in Italy led to his meeting with Larry Nocella.\n\n\"Larry was a very good Italian saxophonist, a very sad fellow with his addiction problem, but a very fine saxophonist. Red Records wanted Dannie’s rhythm section in order to make a recording with him. It took place in a church. It was very cold and damp, a very strange affair. I was sitting there with the pianist Bob Neloms next to Dannie, I thought the title was entirely appropriate: \"Everything Happens To Me\" (Red VPA-167, November 1980).\"\n\nIn the meantime, Wim has \"turned it over\" and works for both the quarter (*) and with the Dannie Richmond quintet (**) (with Brown, bass, Jack Walrath, trumpet, Ricky Ford, saxophones and Bob Neloms, piano). This resulted in the following sessions:\n\n3/5.8.1980 * Earth Beams, Timeless SJP 147\n\n18.8.1980 ** Plays Charlie Mingus, Timeless SJP 148\n\n24.9.1980 ** Dannie Richmond Quintet (Gatemouth 1004)\n\n5/6.4.1981 * Life Line, Timeless SJP 154\n\n23.5.1981 * Jack Walrath, Revenge Of The Fat People (Stash ST221 IMS)\n\n28.3.1983 * City Gates, Timeless SJP 181\n\n30.5.1983 ** Dionysus (Red VPA 161)\n\n19.8.1983 * Live at the Village Vanguard (Soul Note SN1084: vol. 1 & 121144-2: vol. 2)\n\n2/3.2.1984 * Decisions, Timeless SPJ 205\n\n4/5.4.1985 * Live at Montmartre, Timeless SJP 210 (with John Scofield)\n\nLabels other than Timeless are listed between brackets. There are two sessions with Cameron Brown that stand alone: with the Charlie Persip Super Band from 1980 (Stash ST221 IMS with Bob Stewart on tuba, the young Gary Smulyan and Mingus-people Jack Walrath and Bill Saxton). The pianist Michael Cochrane plays on the Jack Walrath record, recently to be heard on \"Cutting Edge\", a SteepleChase CD (SCCD 31430) under his own name. The day after Dyonisus (May 31/June 1, 1983), Cameron played on a session with vocalist Lisa Rich (Discovery DS908).\n\nDannie Richmond, Roma 1982 © Nina Contini Melis\n\nThe George Adams-Don Pullen combination carried on with Blue Note with \"Breakthrough\" (April 30, 1986 ñ BN 46314) and \"Song Everlasting\" (April 21, 1987 ñ BN 46907). There are two numbers from each LP/CD on the recent compilation \"The Best of Don Pullen\" (BN 23513).\n\n\"Everything went well with the quartet until Dannie’s death (March 15, 1988), even though there were differences of opinion between Don and George, and Don would have preferred to go and do something else. Another problem was that we had not recorded so much on Blue Note, and the label, partly because of the success of the CD, had restarted its jazz production and its re-releases. We fell between the devil and the deep blue sea, there was more of us on other labels, and we were getting hardly any promotion, especially not in Europe. It was frustrating being unable to find our recordings anywhere when on tour in Europe. It was insane and so disappointing.\n\nWe still had a heck of a lot of bookings, including an extensive festival tour in Europe and the Mount Fuji festival in Japan in August 1988 and 1989. We trusted Dannie’s place to Lewis Nash. George started to record for the Something Else label, the Japanese equivalent of Blue Note. Don Pullen made a trio record with Gary Peacock and Tony Williams with the label. Then Dewey Redman called.\"\n\nDewey Redman, Jazzíhalo Music Days 1997, Gouvy © Jos L. Knaepen\n\nDEWEY REDMAN\n\n\"I’ve now been in Dewey’s band for about eight years. It started in the spring of 1988 with a really hectic tour, Geri Allen and drummer Eddie Moore were the other two members. We made a recording in the autumn of that year (\"Living On The Edge\", NYC, September 13/14, 1989, Soul Note 120123-2).\n\nDewey? He’s a marvellous and supportive bandleader. He never forces you to do anything, or how long you have to play, he encourages you and selects the musicians that fit him perfectly. That has had some brilliant results, as you can hear on the recordings from Ronnie Scott’s Club from early October 1996 for a small American label Palmetto, with Rita Marcotulli and Matt Wilson.\n\nThat was a few months before Ronnie gave up over Christmas. The CD has now been released under the title \"In London\" (Palmetto PM-2030). We can probably best characterize Redman with a soul-searching verse he wrote in 1974 that you can also find in the CD booklet:\n\nMUSIC the most elegant of travellers\n\nliving in living\n\nspanning infinite reincarnations,\n\npacifying agnostic and pious alike\n\nMUSIC master maker of the body, intimate\n\nwith the soul, laying to shame\n\nall explanations\n\nMUSIC true God of the universe?\n\nCam and Dewey Redman were reunited under the name of drummer Ed Blackwell (\"Walls-Bridges\", February 27, 1992, Black Saint 120153) and they also played on \"Choices\" later that year with Dewey’s son Joshua Redman and Leon Parker, a combination that existed for more than a year (July 28/30, 1992, enja cd 7073-2).\n\n\"Michael Boolan is a hell of a guitar player. Together with Dewey and drummer Skip Hadden we cut \"Reverance\" on September 22nd and 23rd, the latter being Traneís birthday (enja ENJ 8096-2, 1994).\"\n\nCameron attaches less importance to his summery recording that same year with ... Christmas songs (Christmas with Houston Person). He can be heard on 6 numbers with pianist Benny Green, guitarist Melvin Sparks and drummer Winand Harper in the rhythm section (July 29, 1994).\n\nBut as a lustrum in time to just before Christmas 1989.\n\nPOPKIN, BONAFEDE AND BELGIUM\n\nCameron Brown’ interest for a more cerebral approach to jazz led him to Lennie Tristano and brought him to the Connie Crothers-Lenny Popkin quartet with daughter Carol Tristano on the drums with albums such as \"Love Energy\" (April 14/21, 1988, New Artists NA 1005 CD), \"In Motion\" (November 23/25, 1989, NA 1013 CD, recorded in Belgium, partly in De Werf), one with the then BRTN broadcasting company, \"New York Night\" (December 4, 1989, NA 1008 CD, just after in the Blue Note in New York) and, more than three years later, \"Jazz Spring\" (March 26, 1993 ñ NA 1017 CD), CD’s with booklets bulging with a complete lack of information.\n\nMeanwhile Sal Bonafede had appeared on the scene.\n\n\"Sal is one of my favourite musicians in the whole world. I made that recording with him and with Joe Lovano and Adam Nussbaum. It was recorded on Broadway, between 19th and 20th Streets.\" (\"Actor Actress\" - Ken Music 660 56004).\n\nIt is strange that a number of tracks were given the name of a musician: \"Motian\", \"Joe Lovano\", \"Paul Bley\", \"Mel Lewis\", ...\n\n\"He simply gave the names of those people to his own compositions. I think that he is a phenomenal composer, in a whole variety of musical styles. I would jump at the chance to work with him again, but he moved back to Palermo two or three years ago. But luckily he is still part of the international scene, he was on the European summer tour (1997) with Joe Lovano when we did Sinatra. (But not on the CD \"Celebrating Sinatra\", Blue Note 37718, which was recorded a year earlier, July 2/3, 1996).\n\nThen Jazz’halo brought Cameron Brown to Belgium for the recording of the CD \"Spring Cleaning\" (TS002, May 19/20, 1992) along with Steve Houben, John Ruocco and Chris Joris, who were already on \"Songs for Mbizo\" (TS001). A promotional tour was set up with Isbin, John and Chris, which, among other things, led to Chris Joris hiring Cam for his new CD \"Bihogo\" with Pierre Vaïana and a number of guests including the British trombonist Annie Whitehead (November 24, 1992 / 20/21/31 July 1993, TS006). In between times, they made the recordings for \"Dance or Die\" by Nathalie Loriers with Jeroen Van Herzeele and Rick Hollander (June 1993, Igloo IGL-105).\n\n\"Then I made that record with Steve (Slagle) for SteepleChase in October 1994 (SCCD-1367).\"\n\nIn Denmark?\n\n\"No, not at all. That bloke, Nils Winther (boss of the Danish label), comes to New York twice a year and then records material for 10 to 20 records.\n\nJust like Gerry Teekens for his Criss Cross label. He is always there around Christmas time.\n\nThey do very quick sessions, it’s not the best artistic conditions. You play and Nils thinks it’s OK. If you then suggest doing another take, Nils asks: ‘Why? Let’s go, this is OK, good enough.’ It is best for him if you immediately start on the next theme. He works in the way that is most economical for him.\"\n\nSales are not exactly tremendous.\n\n\"Perhaps not, in the beginning it was different. I remember that duo recording with the bassists Sam Jones and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen on SteepleChase. Now, as far as the record with Steve is concerned, he was an old friend. If you live in New York for thirty years then you already know quite a few people and you have played with practically all the musicians. So Steve called me and brought along Kenny Drew Jr. and Jeff Hirshfield.\n\n© Frank Tafuri\n\nTHE COMPOSER, THE BANDLEADER\n\nOn November 9, 1997, a visibly pleased Cameron Brown prepares for that evening’s concert, as part of the Jazz’halo Music Days. Sheila Jordan, Leon Parker, trumpeter Dave Ballou (born April 22, 1963, one week before Coltrane recorded \"After The Rain\" and other tracks for Impulse). Ballou is the least famous musician in the line-up, but he would turn out to be a great surprise! A less pleasant surprise was Dewey pulling out, just a day after playing with them in Gouvy.\n\nSheila Jordan pops in arrange some new dates. The highpoint of the Music Days is still to come: the first concert of the last evening, her duo with Cameron (November 11)\n\n\"I haven’t done much composing. Everything is on these CD’s.\"\n\nThe titles of some of Cameron’s compositions are: \"For Dad and Dannie\", \"Babies, Children\", \"Riley’s Bounce\" and \"Lullabye for George, Don and Dannie\".\n\n\"I hope to do something about this, but my wife and I have two children, aged 11 and 7, and we teach them at home. When I’m not on tour, I also want to take on my responsibilities. That means that I am very busy and don’t get round to composing. When I do have a free moment, I prefer to relax, read something, cut loose.\n\n\"In 1988 both my father and Dannie Richmond passed on. I wrote \"For Dad and Dannie\" for them, but I was never happy with it, even though I have regularly rewritten it over the last ten years. Until this summer (1997), when I was at last able to develop my idea properly. I am too much of a perfectionist.\"\n\nA new challenge awaited Cameron during the Jazz’halo Music Days. We will sketch the scenario using the titles of the numbers from the final concert with Sheila, just as we started: he grew accustomed to his bass, but now he wanted to know if he was suited to be a bandleader, a role that Jos Demol had deliberately set aside for him. Instead of being \"Good Morning Heartache\" it was \"Better Than Anything\"."
