From the duet album Looking At Bird by Archie Shepp & Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, recorded February 7, 1980. Ornithology is originally Written by Benny Harris.

Archie Shepp pays tribute to Bird not by copying him, but by being creative and playing Parker´s repertoire in his own sound. Recommended. [source]
