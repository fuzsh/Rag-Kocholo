        "text": "Mike Herrera is best known as the vocalist and bassist for MxPx, a punk rock act from Bremerton, Washington, that gained a substantial following in the mid-'90s.\n\nAlthough each member of MxPx was a Christian, the band never identified itself as a Christian punk band, and, after eight solid efforts of pop-infused punk, Herrera decided to mine an early country influence and form a new band, Tumbledown. Named after a phrase in a song by Woody Guthrie, Tumbledown has released two albums of punk-infused roots music.\n\nWe recently caught up with Herrera in advance of his new band's gig tomorrow nightat Lochrann's in Frisco and on Sunday at the Double Wide. Speaking from his home in upper Washington state, Herrera was happy to discuss his new band's direction as well as the future of MxPx.\n\nOh and for kicks, he passed along a special Tumbledown track for DC9 readers to grab as a free download. Check out \"Sunny in Dallas,\" as well as our Q&A with Herrera, after the jump.\n\nBonus mp3:"
