        "text": "So far, the fifth season of Fixer Upper has included a couple of celebrity appearances (remember former First Lady Laura Bush and former NFL star Tim Tebow?). And the series finale, titled \"Rock Star Renovation\" will feature another special guest—a rock star, of course.\n\nMusician Mike Herrera, 41, and his wife, Holli, will be Chip and Joanna Gaines's final clients on the show. Here's what you need to know about the vocalist and bassist.\n\n1. Mike is the lead singer of punk rock band MxPx.\n\nThe Washington native is best known for singing and playing bass for MxPx, a Christian punk rock band he formed with friends as a teen in the '90s.\n\nHe's also the frontman for the alternative country band Tumbledown. Named for a line in a Woody Guthrie song, Tumbledown has a totally different sound from MxPx. Herrera has listed Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Cash as influences. Mike's also the bassist for another band, Goldfinger, and performs as a solo act as well.\n\n2. Mike and Holli have two cute kids.\n\nTheir daughter is named Sailor Mae, and their son is Rhodes Wilder.\n\n3. Mike is a family man.\n\nAs you can see in these sweet Instagram photos and videos, Mike's music isn't just for the stage; he loves playing for his kids, too! Like Chip, Mike seems like a total family man. Perhaps he'll even perform for Chip and Joanna and their four kids at some point during the show.\n\n4. The Herreras are moving to Waco.\n\nAccording to HGTV's episode description, the family is relocating from Washington to Waco to be closer to Holli's kin. They're looking for a house with plenty of space for their young family and a studio for Mike, but apparently some structural issues cause some trouble during the renovation process.\n\n5. ... but they're keeping their home in Bremerton, WA."
