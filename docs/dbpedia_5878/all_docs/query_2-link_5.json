It's something that we kind of get used to and we take for granted in a lot of ways, but if it's not there, you notice.\n\nMike Herrera:\n\nI started hanging out with this kid and he was listening to The Ramones and Social Distortion. I didn't play an instrument, but I wanted to be part of this. And then I met a local band and I would watch them practice, and they just sounded amazing. It was like Bad Religion, you know, just really fast, aggressive music. It said a lot of the things that I was feeling.\n\nMike Herrera:\n\nSeeing it live for the first time, not in an arena. Not in a huge rock club or theater, but in a basement where there's just me and another dude watching, watching this band play. That just started it all for me.\n\nMike Herrera:\n\nI was listening to The Police. Sting really, I thought that was interesting how he sang and played. And they could make all this noise as a three piece. And that sort of like made me go bass guitar, that's my instrument."
