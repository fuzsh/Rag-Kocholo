        "text": "About Me\n\nJuly 2015 - at the Observatory in Santa Ana, CA for the filming of Left Coast Live\n\nHello, my name is Chris and I am a MxPx fan. (echo: hello Chris)\n\nI have been a MxPx fan since 1995. What first brought them into my teenage existence was spotting their On The Cover CD at a Christian bookstore. I picked up the CD off the shelf and thought, \"wow, check out all those cool cover songs by a punk band\"! I bought the CD and quickly fell in love with the MxPx sound. Very shortly thereafter I bought Teenage Politics which was only a couple months old at the time and the rest, as they say, is history. My first live show of theirs was the following year. They were a major influence on me and my musical tastes throughout my later teenage years and into adulthood.\n\n​As I grew into my young adult years my passion for the band went through a bit of a dip (this would have been a little prior to the time that Before Everything & After was released) but I continued to be a fan (albeit a more casual one). Then in around 2009 or so my interest began to steadily grow once again. This was in part due to the Mike Herrera side project Tumbledown which I was a very big fan of. I became very active in the fan club (PxPx) again and started really appreciating once more the music they'd released between The Ever Passing Moment (which is my favorite MxPx album) and then (the Left Coast Punk EP was a big part of that, as well as Secret Weapon).\n\n​Then, things really started surging forward as they geared up to release their ninth studio album, Plans Within Plans. I helped with a bit of promotion (street team type stuff) for that album and was becoming very steadily involved with the fan club and even with the band's management team (Mike's mom!). Then when the opportunity opened up in early 2013 for a new person to take over the running of the fan club as well as all of the social media platforms and website for the band, I immediately jumped on the opportunity! I became very intimately involved in the day-to-day workings on the band and worked closely with Michele (Mike's mom) and Mike on a wide variety of projects (maintaining and eventually completely revising the website, numerous social media improvements, digital content releases, and new music projects).\n\nI have continued to work with the band up to this day running the fan club, managing/moderating the Facebook groups and helping out with a few other projects here and there, but I've been less involved in the day-to-day workings as their management team has grown and amped up their running of things (please note that I no longer run the official MxPx website, if you have need, please contact the management team through the site).\n\n​~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you wish to help out financially with the website to help support its operating costs, you can donate via PayPal.
