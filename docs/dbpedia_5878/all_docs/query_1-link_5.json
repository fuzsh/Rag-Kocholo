        "text": "One of the highlights of producing the Inspired By soundtrack for The Passion of The Christ was working with MxPx and Mark Hoppus of Blink-182. Mike, Yuri and Tom from MxPx came in to watch the film and wrote a song, The Empire, in response. A few months later we tracked the song at a studio in Hollywood and Mark Hoppus dropped in to sing on it with lead singer Mike Herrera and the result was perhaps the most unusual punk rock song about the Crucifixion ever.\n\nMike and I have kept in touch over the years and he recently dropped by the Bully! Pulpit show to talk about what he's been up to lately and about the decade plus of great punk rock music he's been making with his band."
