        "text": "PREVIEW\n\nTumbledown, with Handlebar Mustangs, New Old Stock\n\nWhere: Winterland, 1220 Sylvan Way, Bremerton\n\nWhen: 9:30 p.m. April 2\n\nCover: $5 (21 and older)\n\nInformation: (360) 479-5686, myspace.com/winterlandrocks\n\nON THE WEB\n\ntumbledownhq.com\n\nBy BILL MICKELSON\n\nFOR KITSAP A&E\n\nMidday on March 22, the Bremerton-based punk-western band Tumbledown was driving across the desert, just outside of El Paso, Texas.\n\nThey were halfway through the longest drive of a monthlong, 7,000-some-mile tour to and from one of the premiere music festivals in the country. Fading away in their rear view mirror: the South By Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas. Amidst the calm following the sensory deluge of some 2,000 bands over four days on the edge of the desert, it was quiet time.\n\nI asked if it felt like some sort of hangover.\n\n“There was a lot of silence driving away from Austin,” Tumbledown lead singer-guitarist Mike Herrera (of MxPx) recalled. “Almost like a reflective mood in the air. Maybe a mental hangover, just from the overload of everything we did.”\n\nBut all that silence must’ve been somewhat serene, given what the band members’ ear drums had been through during three days at the festival.\n\nOfficially showcasing 2,000 bands and musicians over four days on 80 stages throughout Austin, South By Southwest (SXSW) is one of the biggest music festivals in the country.\n\n“There’s not a lot of music festivals like it,” Herrera says. “It’s huge.”\n\n“There’s bands everywhere,” Tumbledown drummer Harley Trotland described. “Inside. Outside. And it’s one right after another. There’s no down time. Huge stages. Huge speaker systems. And, like, 10 of them.”\n\nAnd all that nonstop music coming from indoor clubs, outdoor stages and parking lots — not too mention the “unofficial” street corners, park benches and rooftops — it’s all just one slice of the overall, colossal festival. Before the music even starts, the nine-day event also features an interactive web-tech conference, an esteemed film festival and a trade show-business convention.\n\nBorn in 1987, SXSW is celebrated around the world as one of the great modern-day cultural institutions, heralded as one of those places where you’ll find the Next Big Thing. “Tomorrow Happens Here” is the slogan.\n\nHundreds of bands annually flock to the frenzy from locations around the globe. Media and music industry execs survey the field for that next big thing while radio stations set up for remote broadcasts and the blogosphere is bombarded with e-reviews and posts recounting first-hand festival happenings.\n\nNew bands go there to be heard. Established acts go to stoke their careers.\n\nSinger-songwriter Andrew Anderson — Tumbledown’s tour mate on the road to SXSW — recently relocated from the Northwest to Austin, noting music as his inspiration.\n\nHerrera calls it “the Nashville of today.”\n\nAnd though they’ve yet to play an officially sanctioned gig at SXSW, Tumbledown has toured to and from the festival each year since the band’s inception in 2007. Each year, they’d book their own shows during SXSW, at clubs on the festival’s fringe, and set up a tour to get them there and back. This year, however, was the first year the band actually submitted itself into the SXSW database.\n\nBut even without being on the list, last year, Tumbledown went to SXSW and returned with a record deal for their debut album, on the Austin-based label End Sounds. This year they went back with that record in hand (released in spring 2009) along with a live album, the limited edition “Live In Tulsa,” which dropped a few weeks before SXSW, and played the End Sounds’ SXSW Kickoff.\n\n“I got a few business cards,” Herrera said when asked if any other record deals came up this year.\n\nLast month, right up to the date they left on tour, the band was working feverishly on another forthcoming studio album, recorded and produced at Herrera’s Monkey Trench Studios in Bremerton.\n\nOnce on tour with Andrew Anderson and Columbus, Ohio-based label mates Two Car Garage, Tumbledown played about a dozen shows across eight states, making their way to Austin for three gigs at SXSW: the End Sounds’ March 16 pre-party with an all-star, one-time Descendents cover band called ‘Hope’ (featuring one Mike Herrera on vocals); the others, Austin club gigs on March 19 and 20, with California crooner Mike Hale.\n\nThe day after the final night of SXSW, before leaving Texas, they played San Antonio, and in the days ahead they’ll play a string of shows up the coast through California and Oregon with a homecoming show April 2 at Winterland. And while the Bremerton band won’t be coming back from Austin with another record deal this year, they are each returning with a new tattoo — from Dallas-based artist, and friend of the band, Oliver Peck.\n\n“I got the Tumbledown sugar skull,” Harley Trotland said. “Jack got a pin-up girl on his right forearm. Mike got another ballsy neck tattoo. And Marshall got most of his arm filled in.”\n\nWhat’s more, the band returns with the wisdom, exposure and experience that only something like a trip to South by Southwest could give a band.\n\n“The whole country’s music scene is basically there,” Tumbledown bassist Marshall Trotland reflected on the festival. “You get a real good idea of what’s going on everywhere, makes you feel kind of small at times, I guess.”\n\n“You come back a little wiser,” Harley added. “A little bit smarter, you know what you want a little more ... it’s a good place to be.”"
