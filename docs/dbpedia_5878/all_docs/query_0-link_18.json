        "text": "As some of you may know, I started AbsolutePunk.net over 15 years ago as an MxPx and Blink-182 fan-page. Those were the first two bands I truly loved. They shaped my entire music taste and starting that website changed my life. I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for those bands and those albums. Listening to “Doing Time” as a teenager gave me hope. Discovering pop-punk music and the community around it made me feel like I belonged to something special. Small, right outside of the mainstream, but undeniably special. The music was unlike anything I was listening to at the time and hit me right when I needed it most.\n\nLast week MxPx released their new, self-titled, album. It’s their first album since 2012. Today, I’m excited to debut a new episode of Encore featuring lead singer Mike Herrera. This episode is a joint episode with Mike’s podcast, “The Mike Herrera Podcast,” which I also recommend subscribing to and checking out. In this episode we go deep on the new album. We talk about the recording process, the inspiration behind the songs, and then I walk through each song with Mike and get his thoughts on different aspects. I share some thoughts too, but mostly I was trying to get at what made this album feel so fresh, and yet so wholly MxPx, here in 2018.\n\nWe also recorded the FaceTime conversation we had doing this podcast and the video is available on the MxPx YouTube channel. I look ridiculous and my cat walks into the office to have lunch a few minutes in, but we thought being able to see each other and read and react to facial expressions would bring a fun vibe to this episode. I think it worked. This is one of my favorite episodes of the podcast I’ve ever done.\n\nShow notes are below, the band’s new album is available on all streaming platforms, and physical copies are available at MxPx.com right now.\n\nHosts\n\nJason Tate\n\nMike Herrera\n\n@encorepodcast\n\nShow Notes\n\nThe new MxPx album is available at Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, Amazon, YouTube, or wherever you stream your music.\n\nVinyl and CDs can be bought directly from the band themselves at MxPx.com.\n\nI know I said 1994 instead of 1992, which is when the band was founded.\n\nI also know the name of the song is “I’m Ok, You’re Ok.”\n\n”Trust the Process”\n\nThe Mike Herrera Podcast\n\nSubscribe\n\nYou’ll always find this podcast at encore.fm.\n\nYou can subscribe to this podcast in Apple Podcasts, via any podcast player using our RSS feed, on SoundCloud, via Overcast, in Google Play, or on Stitcher.
