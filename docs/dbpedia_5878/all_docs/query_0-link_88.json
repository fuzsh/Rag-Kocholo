        "text": "Mike Herrera promised epic music as this unprecedented season of life went longer, and MxPx has delivered with a song that could have been a logical follow up to 1998 song “Party, My House, Be There” from their Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo album.\n\n“Worries” is the socially distant version of that song, full of hooky melodies and catchy, memorable lyrics. The song is dripping with that Seattle punk rock groove, while reassuring fans that they are missed and that we’re all in this together.\n\nThe concept video is simple but effective, with framed shots of each band member throughout the song wrapped inside a humorous phone conversation between Yuri Ruley and Tom Wisniewski.\n\nStream “Worries” on Spotify and Apple Music."
