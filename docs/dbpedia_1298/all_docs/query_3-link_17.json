This is a war and we are soldiers. What if tomorrow the war could be over? Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for?\" - Morpheusâ€‹\n\nRelease Date: May 15, 2003\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nDirector: Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Monica Bellucci, Daniel Bernhardt, Jada Pinkett Smith, Matt McColm, Harold Perrineau Jr., Harry Lennix, Stuart Wells\n\nPlot Summary: In the second chapter of the Matrix trilogy, freedom fighters Neo (Reeves), Trinity (Moss) and Morpheus (Fishburne) continue to lead the revolt against the Machine Army, unleashing their arsenal of extraordinary skills and weaponry against the systematic forces of repression and exploitation. In their quest to save the human race from extinction, they gain greater insight into the construct of The Matrix and Neo's pivotal role in the fate of mankind.\n\nVisit the official movie site here.\n\nBuy the movie!\n\nComments?\n\nAs we hit midnight, it is officially Thursday and people are getting back from late Wednesday showings so talk about the movie right here.\n\nRelated Threads\n\nThe Matrix talkback\n\nMovie Soundtrack talkback\n\nDVD Talkback\n\nOh man. They took it in such a different direction than what I expected. We have, in the words of Douglas Adams, a \"trilogy of philosophical blockbusters\" on our hands. Matrix=Reality, Reloaded=Choice, Revolutions=Purpose (seems this one will focus more on Agt. Smith's nihilism).\n\nThe name symbolism was right up to snuff (Merovingian, Persephone... Nebuchadnezzar -- I knew this meant trouble when I heard it in the first film, and sure enough... ), the interview with the creator (so many layers, so many different interpretations, reflected in the constant zoom-ins, impossible to discover where it ends). Just incredible.\n\nAnd the fight scenes!! Saw it with a Chinese film student who was quite satisfied with our imitation of his filmmaking. That single shot in the park fight scene seemed to go on forever!! The virtual camera has officially arrived.\n\nI think, Barry, that the flying was the least creative part of the film. But I guess people have different priorities.\n\nNeedless to say I'm going again next week, just to catch what I didn't catch the first time. So much richness in every scene.\n\nAnd let me be the first to say, \"That's some cake!\"\n\nEDIT: It's funny that Ebert mocks the \"pop philosophers\" who are going to be analyzing the film, only to analyze the philosophy of the film at the end of his review. I think to an extent he's right, but most of the thrill for me comes from seeing these ideas on a movie screen, not from just seeing these ideas period. The Wachowskis are well-read and it's refreshing to see a script that brings to mind, as Ebert puts it, \"Philosophy 101.\"\n\nMost of the Zion stuff blew. Other than the nods to a couple of the Animatrix shorts (if you're foolish enough to be reading this before seeing the movie, try to catch 'Final Flight of the Osiris' and 'Kid's Story' before going), I really thought we were in trouble after the first half hour. The whole carnal dance/sex sequence is five+ minutes that I'll be fast forwarding in the future (Were the Wachowskis hungry for boobies or something?) and the chief counselor was just too... animated? He bugged me. If they had skipped the carnal dance and went straight to the core scene, perhaps I would've enjoyed it more, but it just felt like we were dragging further and further away from a plot.\n\nNow, going into this, I remember thinking that they had to have used up all of the philisophical stuff as well as eliminated most of the mystery, so I was really just hoping for a fun ride this time around, but once we got out of Zion, the story just started running and kept picking up steam, and managed to \"twist my noodle\", as the Oracle would say.\n\nBy the time we got about two-thirds through the movie, I did start to get a little frustrated again. So everybody's a rogue program now? I started to feel like we were losing track of the real enemy until the freeway scene finally hit.\n\nThe Keymaker really grew on me. I was sad to see him die.\n\nI'm going to need to see the movie again just to see if I can catch up with everything the Architect said, as well as going back and looking for hidden clues in the dialogue between Neo and the Oracle.\n\nBut my thoughts are this: obviously, what we thought was the real world is just another Matrix, but I'm sure this one operates under some kind of different rules that we'll have to discover. I also think that the Architect manipulated Neo somehow. Only a handful of people survived the destruction of Zion. I'm sure that once we take count, we're going to discover that exactly twenty some-odd men and seven women survived. The exact number that the Architect said Neo had to choose to rebuild Zion. Oh.... plus one. And that's when Neo's going to realize there's a traitor in their midst.\n\nAnd there's still a question about the boy that Neo saved in the Animatrix short. Animatrix Spoiler:\n\nSomehow, he survived death in the Matrix.\n\nIs this going to play into Revolutions, or was his presence in the movie just a nod to 'Kid's Story'?\n\nWhile I don't share as much disdain as Barry Allen did, the first 3/4 of this movie did nothing for me. I am not going to lie and say I didn't enjoy it, but it was all mindless action. The first movie had the action woven into the storyline well, here it was just filler.\n\nBut it was the last quarter that got me hooked. Being a math major, I understood what \"The Architect\" meant by the philosophy of choices. I won't get into it until more people respond but the one question I have for the final movie is the meaning of it all. Even if Neo, who just had to save the girl over the human race and who had to get his powers outside of the Matrix (didn't like either, BTW), succeeded in his quest to save zion, wouldn't \"The Architect\" simply create the seventh version? It's a brain-buster, and should make for a much better third installment.\n\nThis movie was a WWE PPV, with a bunch of high spots for most of the card. Two show stealers with Smith vs. Neo and Everyone against those twins, and an awesome main event with \"The Architect\" and a cliffhanger. Guilty pleasure: Not uttering \"What?\" inbetween every line of Morpheus' speech.\n\nOne thing I do find funny is the fact that this is a \"PG-13\" board, but we are talking about an R-rated movie, and a serious one at that. It has been done before, but I hope the little ones don't get offended .\n\nLater.\n\nI'm still laughing from that \"Duh duhn DUHN!\" at the end...aaahhahahahahaha...\n\nIn the end, I'm going to have to agree with a lot of the other \"poor\" reviews this movie recieved. They talked too preachy, too much. Zion is a hole. And ultimately...the end of the first movie left us with a lot of promise...and as soon as that promise was destroyed, a new light of promise had shown thru...some really awesome idea's...brilliant story possibilities...\n\n...which never happened.\n\nAltogether, one hell of a great movie. But...it's like a lost child, which wanders from it's mother, and hide's in the video game isle of a toy store. All I could think about while watching it was..\"this would be a great video game.\" And if only because after each so-well-triggered fight sequence, the story continued to progress, like a video game, only so you could once again reach your next fight sequence.\n\nAnd it has an R rating...which is entirely unnecessary. If Neo and Trinity wern't a couple of sex-fiends, it could have easily been a nice little PG-13 flick. Jeeze...all that was just unecessary.\n\n...I'm feeling so indifferent...I shouldnt even be talking anymore."
