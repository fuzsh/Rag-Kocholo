        "text": "This article has been included in The Leadhead's Pencil Blog Volume 7, now available here.\n\nIf you don't want the book but you enjoy the article, please consider supporting the Blog project here.\n\nThe early development of Sheaffer’s Fineline utility pencils, “in working togs,” is well-documented in Sheaffer’s catalogs. Recently, I found a better home for my crowded Sheaffer archive at an antique mall up in Amish County:\n\nThe bulk of my Sheaffer collection formerly resided in that short, gray printer’s cabinet - the move to the larger cabinet on the right gave me a long-overdue opportunity to stretch things out a little bit and reorganize things; time to show how things developed.\n\nSheaffer’s utility pencil program began in 1936 with the Model LL, a rear-drive pencil with a one-piece barrel. It was cataloged only in black in 1936 and 1937, and in its final year of production, 1938, it was joined by the Model MM, in “grey pearl” (see Volume 5, page 237):\n\nThe LL and MM models appear in the 1938 catalog on a page of “Sheaffer’s Regular Pencils.” Another page in the 1938 catalog passes the torch to Sheaffer’s new breed of utility pencils, using “Fineline” .9mm leads supplied by the Joseph Dixon Crucible Company. The “Working Togs” model is shown at the bottom of the page, and the text indicates it was available only in black as Model LE:\n\nNote that Sheaffer’s new model is the only one on this page fitted with a throwback clip, the flat-ball “Sheaffer’s” clip found on Sheaffer’s regular line earlier in the 1930s. Note also a thin metal band separating the top piece from the barrel, a carryover from the earlier MM and LL pencils.\n\nThe fact that these were offered only in black for 1938 probably explains why so many more of these are found in that color than any other:\n\nI theorize that all four of these are from 1938, because they also have the ordinary “Sheaffer’s” imprints, another carryover from the LL and MM line:\n\nAt the time, “Fineline” was a feature offered by Sheaffer, a slick mechanism for a thinner lead. Sheaffer would soon establish a dedicated “Fineline Division” to manufacture lower-priced and utility pencils. For the 1939 catalog, only “Working Togs” models appear on the “Fineline” page:\n\nSheaffer’s 1939 catalog indicates that these pencils were now offered in new colors – in addition to the black LE, there were also red, brown, green and blue pencils, somewhat unimaginatively designated RE, BE, GE and . . . well, since brown already took BE the blue was model TE.\n\nNo, I haven’t seen a red one yet. A pattern emerges from this small sampling: the colored ones have a “Fineline” imprint on the side opposite from the clip, as opposed to a “Sheaffer’s” imprint below it:\n\nThat leads me to believe that black examples, identical to those pictured earlier, were made in 1939 or 1940 when they are found with this Fineline imprint:\n\nMaybe . . . that green example is the exception to the rule, sporting what otherwise appears to be a 1938 imprint.\n\nIn 1940, Sheaffer’s catalog illustrates “pearl center” pencils for the first time; note, however, that the pencils illustrated abandon the flat ball clip in favor of a more streamlined version:\n\n“Working Togs” pencils with clips shown in the 1940 catalog remained in production for a number of years with only minor modifications. The black pearl center example second from top was made later, and is included here to illustrate these minor modifications. Sheaffers in 1940-1941 had all gold-filled tips, fully ribbed lower barrels, and that metal band around the pencil at the top of the clip. Later models had two-tone tips, barrels that were only ribbed part way up from the tip, and the metal ring was voided.\n\nAt some point Sheaffer decided green should look nicer than the mousy, pea-green in use since 1939. As for the red, white and blue example at bottom, of course those can be “made” by mismatching parts, but “red, white and blue” was specifically cataloged by Sheaffer in 1941, as model IRTE (I for pearl center, R for red, and T – since brown already hogged the letter B – stood for blue) along with one other interesting innovation in the series:\n\nIn February, 1948, Sheaffer’s company magazine, Sheaffer Review, illustrated the Fineline Division’s new budget fountain pens and pencils, which sported clips imprinted with a script “Fineline” rather than the Sheaffer name. A Sheaffer Fineline brochure in the Pen Collectors of America’s online library and dated June 1951 shows that the clip had been adopted on the Working togs line, as well."
