        "text": "Square-jawed Matt McColm has been an in-demand stuntman for over 30 years, during which time he's also worked as an actor and model. His first work as a stuntman came in the undistinguished 1979 television movie \"The Night Rider.\" Five years would pass until he returned to the industry, performing stunts on the medical drama \"St. Elsewhere,\" and he worked steadily in television for the next two years. McColm broke into film with the poorly received Eddie Murphy adventure film \"The Golden Child\" in 1986 and abandoned television stuntwork thereafter. From 1989 to 1994, it was rare for him not to perform stunts in anywhere from three to five films a year. In 1994, he set aside that career for five years to pursue acting, landing his most notable role as the lead in the syndicated science-fiction series \"Night Man.\" As Johnny Domino, a jazz musician who becomes an insomniac superhero after a lightning bolt leaves him incapable of sleep, McColm was able to combine his talent for action with his desire to act. When the series ended, McColm returned to stunt work in major blockbusters like the first \"Transformers\" movie. In addition to his film and television work, McColm appeared for years as a model in ads for Ralph Lauren's Chaps clothing line."
