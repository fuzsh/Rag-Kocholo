        "text": "Australian actor Bren Foster started acting in high school. His mother was of Cypriot heritage and his father of English/Irish heritage. After High school Bren studied Film and Video production, but felt the need to move toward his artistic development as an actor. Bren then traveled to New York to study at \"The Barrow Group Theater\". Upon his return to Australia Bren auditioned for and was selected into one of Australia's leading Drama schools \"The University of Western Sydney\" AKA Theater Nepean. Furthermore he spent 2 years at the Sanford Meisner based acting school \"The Actors Pulse\". Early in Bren's career he worked on many Australian television Dramas but his breakout role came when he landed a role in the critically acclaimed and award winning Australian feature film Cedar Boys (2009) where he was praised as \"a born star\" by Empire Film magazine for his portrayal of \"Jamal\" a criminal behind bars desperately trying to guide his younger brother away from the criminal path. Bren has studied Martial Arts for many years and has worked in the United States for \"The discovery Channel\" filming Extreme Martial arts and for the National Geographic Channel where his martial arts skills were put to the test against science in the feature length documentary \"Fight Science\". Bren has firmly established a solid acting career in both international film and television, both in Australia and the United States.\n\nJonathan was born and raised on the east coast, in a small town of northern New Hampshire. Growing up, Jonathan had some great theater performance opportunities, and thanks to his incredible family, a pure love for Walt Disney. While enrolled in a liberal arts program at the University of Vermont, Jonathan was accepted into the Walt Disney College Program in Florida, where he was exposed to one of the greatest entertainment experiences of his life. After graduating from UVM, he headed west, stopping in Tempe, Arizona for a few years. While there, he signed with the Ford/Robert Black Agency and consumed himself with acting classes, television commercials and print work. He produced and hosted his first television show, \"That's Showbiz,\" which gave him a wonderful foundation to take his next step, and move to Los Angeles in the late 1990's.\n\nSince living in Los Angeles, Jonathan has starred in several feature films, and held recurring, guest star and co-star roles in numerous popular sitcoms, episodic, and soap operas. This versatile actor is a regular on Jay Leno's, \"Tonight Show,\" having appeared in over 30 of Jay's comedy sketches. Jonathan is also a well established spokesman & host, and has starred in countless national/international television commercials. His recognizable face and physique have graced the covers of several national/international health & fitness magazines.\n\nMartin Henderson was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He began acting when he was 13, appearing in Strangers (1989), a local television production. He attended Westlake Boys High School and Birkenhead Primary. He first became a star in his home country when he starred in the series Shortland Street, playing the character Stuart Neilson from 1992 to 1995, in the early- to mid-'90s. He then moved to Australia to star in the short-lived soapie, Echo Point, and Sweat, which also starred a very young Heath Ledger. The pair became friends, and Martin convinced Heath to move to Sydney and make a go of his career, and the two lived together. Martin also worked on Home and Away and Big Sky, as well as getting an AFI Award nomination for his supporting role in the Aussie film Kick. Martin left Australia to study acting and theatre in New York, where he also looked up Heath in LA.\n\nHenderson spent more than a year unsuccessfully auditioning for film roles in Los Angeles, but in 2001, he was finally cast in a supporting role in the John Woo-directed war film Windtalkers. In 2002, he starred opposite actress Naomi Watts in the horror film The Ring. In 2005, he starred opposite Indian actress Aishwarya Rai in the romantic film Bride & Prejudice, and in the award-winning Little Fish starring Cate Blanchett. In 2010, it was announced Henderson had been cast in the creator of Grey's Anatomy new television series Off the Map wherein doctors travel to the end of the world to rediscover why they had initially wanted to become doctors.\n\nIn 2018, he starred in the horror film The Strangers - Opfernacht (2018).\n\nWhen someone told Brad Johnson he'd come a long way, his usual response was, \"Well, I had a long way to come.\" Born on a small ranch in Tucson, Johnson, the son of a horse trainer/used car salesman, did everything from shoeing horses to repossessing cars to serving as a hunting and fishing guide. His humble beginnings nurtured his modesty and quiet strength and had critics comparing him to John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and James Stewart.\n\nBrad's route to stardom was speedy, dramatic and somewhat circuitous. He joined the Pro Rodeo circuit in 1984 and was spotted wrestling steers in Wyoming by a casting director looking for cowboys to use as extras in a beer commercial. After this first break came a three-year run as the Marlboro Man, then numerous Calvin Klein print ads and more commercials. After a serious knee injury sidelined his rodeo career, Johnson headed for Hollywood.\n\nWithin five months of his arrival, Roger Corman cast him to star in Hells Angels in Vietnam (1989). Soon after, Steven Spielberg discovered Johnson and offered him the coveted role of Ted Baker, Holly Hunter's love interest in Always - Der Feuerengel von Montana (1989). When asked about her co-star, Holly described Brad as \"all twisted steel and sex appeal.\" The Spielberg film led Johnson to Paramount for John Milius's Flug durch die Hölle (1991). An exclusive three-picture deal at Paramount followed.\n\nWith 60 hours of television, 11 pilots and over 25 films to his credit, there was no slowing down. Johnson's Los Angeles-based High Lonesome Productions and his producing partner Lou Pitt had several projects in different stages of production.\n\nBrad lived with his wife Laurie and their eight children on a ranch in the mountains of Colorado.\n\nGiven his elaborate expertise in the martial arts especially the ancient form called Kalaripayattu (which he's trained in since he was all of 4 years old), Vidyut has committed himself to creating a platform for action and stunts in world cinema. His first Bollywood outing Force (a remake of the Tamil film Kaaka Kaaka) alongside John Abraham gave audiences a sneak peek into the kind of action they can expect from Vidyut. It earned him a clean sweep at the awards that year with him winning all the awards for Most Promising Debut for 2012.\n\nHe subsequently played noteworthy roles in the Telugu films Shakti and Oosaravelli, both starring NTR. In 2012, Jammwal made his debut in Tamil cinema with Billa II, alongside Ajith Kumar. For his role, he received tremendous critical appreciation and was lauded immensely for his action sequences. Post Billa II, he has worked in blockbuster Tamil films like Thuppakki, alongside actor Vijay and Anjaan alongside actor Suriya. Vidyut's performance in Thuppaki earned him a fan following and an award for Best Actor in a Negative Role at SIIMA Awards.\n\nSoon after, he was seen In his next Hindi film Commando, where he showcased some realistic combat based action, all performed and designed by him. With just the trailer launch, Vidyut created quite a stir and amassed over a million hits within a week of the trailer launch.\n\nAlthough the film received a mixed critical reception, Jammwal and his action earned phenomenal reviews. Noted critic Taran Adarsh mentioned in his review that: \"Commando clearly belongs to Vidyut and the liberty of watching him crushing everything and everyone in sight leaves you tongue-tied. By doing the stunts without a body double or cables, he fits into the definition of India's Next Gen action hero without a hitch. He's a fine actor too, although it's the action that takes precedence over histrionics here. Commando was also showcased internationally at the Fantasia Film Fest in Montreal followed by a screening at the Fantastic Fest in Texas in 2013. He received great feedback from international media and well known action directors, calling him India's answer to Bruce Lee and Tony Jaa.\n\nIn addition to earning the title of India's New Age Action Hero, the Indian media also went on to tag him as one of the sexiest men they'd seen. He featured in a number of popular lists - Times Most Desirable, Fittest men with Best Bodies and People magazine's Sexiest Men Alive being just a few.\n\nPost Commando, he was seen donning the avatar of a sharpshooter cop in Tigmanshu Dhulia's Bullett Raja and was loved for his action and his performance yet again. Vidyut followed up his on screen magic of Bullett Raja with the sequel of his action franchise Commando and then Milan Luthria's Baadshaho. Known for his gritty and edgy cinematic style, director Tigmanshu Dhulia went on to cast him once again for his next directorial venture: Yaara, a remake of the French film Les Lyonnais, where Vidyut will be seen in an entirely interesting retro avatar playing the character that ages from 21 to 50. Yaara is set to release early in 2018.\n\nVidyut is all set to kick start working on his most exciting project - Junglee directed by American filmmaker Chuck Russell - a name responsible for films like The Scorpion King and The Mask among many others. The film is going to be helmed entirely on Vidyut's shoulders with a solid focus on showcasing absolutely path-breaking action sequences without cables or body doubles - Vidyut's specialty. He and his very own team of stunt men are said be designing and choreographing all his action sequences for this film.\n\nIn the early 1980s, this ruggedly handsome young American actor of Norwegian parentage was seen as the \"next big thing\", and then suddenly he was dead from an accident via a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThe son of Thorleif Hexum (born in Norway) and Gretha Paulsen (born in Minnesota), Jon-Erik Hexum was born and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, where he was a musically gifted student at school playing both the horn and the violin in the school orchestra, and even the piano at home. He then attended Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, before transferring across to Michigan State University studying bio-medical engineering and then switching over to philosophy. At MSU, Hexum played football, and DJ'd at several local radio stations under the name of \"Yukon Jack\", before being discovered by John Travolta's manager, Bob LeMond.\n\nHe reportedly turned down opportunities to appear in such shows as Ein Duke kommt selten allein (1979) and CHiPs (1977) and many day time soap operas before finally making his debut in the TV series Die Zeitreisenden (1982) as time traveler Phineas Bogg. He was then cast as hunk Tyler Burnett alongside Joan Collins in Ein Traummann auf der Titelseite (1983), and then as ex-Green Beret Mac Harper in Mode, Models und Intrigen (1984).\n\nHowever, on October 12, 1984 after a long and draining day's shooting on the set of Golden Opportunity (1984), Hexum became bored with the extensive delays and jokingly put a prop .44 magnum revolver to his temple and pulled the trigger. The gun fired, and the wadding from the blank cartridge shattered his skull, whereupon the mortally injured Hexum was rushed via ambulance to Beverly Hills Medical Center to undergo extensive surgery. Despite five hours of work, the chief surgeon, Dr. David Ditsworth, described the damage to Hexum's brain as life-ending. One week later, on October 18th, he was taken off life support and pronounced dead. However, Hexum's commitment to organ donation meant five other lives were assisted or saved with organs harvested from him. He was 26 years old.\n\nJames Gregory Vaughan, Jr., was born in Dallas, Texas. Raised in both Dallas and Fredericksburg, Texas, graduating from Mesquite High in 1991. Vaughan was both a student-athlete, never shied away from a school talent production. At 16, before graduating high school, he was discovered in a community back-to-school fashion show and was immediately signed up by a local modeling agent.\n\nMonths after high school graduation, he ventured to Milan, Italy landing prestigious campaigns for Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace, as well as Banana Republic, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ralph Lauren all before the age of 21.\n\nIn pursuit of his acting, Vaughan's acting career began in 1996, when Vaughan made his television series debut as Josh Walker in the popular, Aaron Spelling, NBC series Malibu Shores. Followed by, which spins off into Beverly Hills 90210, where Vaughan played Cliff Yeager (1996-1997). Trying his hand at a few small independent films, he was cast in the popular cult films Poison Ivy & Children of the Corn V. In between crossing over to film, he spent time guest-starring in a number of television appearances. Spelling Entertainment soon created a role for Vaughan as a series regular, Dan Gordon, on Charmed (1999-2000).\n\nVaughan landed the highly anticipated Kevin Williams pilot, the role of Milo Mosley in Glory Days. After its short television run, Vaughan began his foray into Daytime drama as Diego on CBS's Young & the Restless, receiving a Daytime Best Newcomer nomination (2001), and People Magazine naming Greg Vaughan as \"One of the Sexiest Men Alive\" in 2002.\n\nWith guest roles on both Will & Grace and Still Standing before jumping from one daytime drama to another. Vaughan's opportunity to grab the highly acclaimed role of Lucky Spencer on General Hospital (2003 - 2009) seems to have simply happened before anyone knew it.\n\nAs he ventured to appear on the hit CW series 90210, followed up with indie-film Borderline Murder, along with spots on TNT's The Closer, ABC-Family Pilot Jane by Design, ABC series Good Christian Belles, and Fox's Lucifer.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of \"Grease 2\" in which he made his film debut. Another feature that attained genuine cult status following its' release in 1995 is \"Empire Records\" and has spawned the annual celebration of 'Rex Manning Day' every April 8th.

He has undertaken multiple tours of the UK and the US in comedies, dramas and musicals and continues to enjoy the ride that has taken him from aspiring teen idol to full blown character actor.\n\nDennis Newman is a former professional bodybuilder.\n\nHe began to get involved in sports at a fairly early age, already at the age of 15 Dennis began to practice his first weight training. Like many beginners, at first the future bodybuilder did not pay due attention to pumping his legs, completely concentrating on building big arms. After some time, the imbalance in the development of the body made itself felt. Then Dennis revised his training process, focusing on leg training. Having corrected the imbalances, Dennis began to think about the competitive podium and already in 1989 he fought at the 'Teen USA Championships' tournaments and 'California Championships', each of which won the title of vice-champion. In 1991, Dennis Newman explored the Musclemania amateur championship scene, where he took the highest place in the Heavyweight category. After 2 years, in 1993, he performed at the Nationals competition, where he stopped one step away from victory, taking 2nd place in the final protocol. In July 1994, Dennis Newman entered the U.S. Championship arena in excellent form, thanks to which he took the lead in the Heavyweight category and became the undisputed champion, which earned him the right to issue an IFBB professional card.\n\nScott Edward Adkins was born on June 17, 1976 in Sutton Coldfield, England, into a family that for generations were butchers. Along with his elder brother Craig, he was raised by their parents, John and Janet (Sanders) Adkins, in a loving middle-class family. Scott attended Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. Probably not the best of students, he used to sneak downstairs after his parents had gone to bed and watch films all night then fall asleep during lessons. A natural athlete, Scott enjoyed a variety of sports as he grew up, but when he was 10 years old, he accompanied his father and brother to the local Judo club. The attraction was instantaneous. Idolising stars such as Bruce Lee and Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott began to train everyday. He took over his Dad's garage and turned it into his own Dojo. He even had a shrine to Bruce Lee in there that he would bow to. He remembers being mugged on a bus when he was around 13 and that really kicked his training into overdrive. He wasn't ever going to let that happen again. At the age of 14, Scott went on to train in Tae Kwon Do under the instruction of Ron Sergiew with the T.A.G.B. After a few years, he moved on to Kickboxing under Anthony Jones. He is now a fully trained Kickboxing Instructor for the P. K. A. A self confessed \"film junkie\" Scott's attention was drawn to acting through the Hollywood Greats. He enrolled in a drama class at Sutton Coldfield College. Being a shy lad he initially found it difficult to be put on stage in front of an audience. Finally, at the age of 21, Scott was offered a place at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. However, as an impoverished student, he found it hard to make ends meet without a grant and was forced to leave without completing the course. Very dejected he thought that was the end.\n\nHis first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial arts film called Dei seung chui keung (2001) (aka Extreme Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and director Wei Tung and English-born Hong Kong movie expert Bey Logan, Adkins found himself in the East for the first time. Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema's leading action directors including Woo-Ping Yuen, Corey Yuen, Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and the legendary Jackie Chan. Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in BBC's Doctors (2000) filmed at Birmingham's Pebble Mill. A few episodes in BBC's EastEnders (1985) and City Central (1998), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama Mile High (2003) followed by a regular role in BBC's Holby City (1999) as Bradley Hume, the assistant General Manager of Holby General.\n\nStarring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of Talbot in Special Forces USA (2003) and Yuri Boyka\" in Undisputed II: Last Man Standing (2006). It was this film that broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka in what has been hailed as one of the best American made Martial Arts films of recent times. Along with lead actor Michael Jai White, fight coordinator J.J. Perry and the slick direction of Isaac Florentine this movie has some unbelievably heart stopping fight scenes. After this Scott has had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like Das Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and The Tournament (2009), and played Jean-Claude Van Damme's main adversary in Sony Pictures The Shepherd (2008)."
