Under rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 136 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the Committee on International Relations is authorized to exercise continuous surveillance of the execution by the executive branch of laws within the committee's jurisdiction. The review of ``oversight'' activities of the Committee on International Relations was augmented by the adoption of section 118 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-150), as amended by Public Law 92-136. This provision requires standing committees of the House and the Senate after January 1, 1973, to make reports to their respective Houses on their activities in reviewing and studying the ``application, administration, and execution of those laws or parts of laws, the subject of which is within the jurisdiction of that committee. House committees are required to file such reports ``not later than January 2 of each odd-numbered year.'' It is in fulfillment of the obligation of the Committee on International Relations to account to the House for its legislative review activities during the 104th Congress that this report has been prepared and submitted. The report was prepared by Laura L. Rush, Legislative Coordinator for the Committee. LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL ---------- House of Representatives, Committee on International Relations, Washington, DC, January 2, 1997. Hon. Robin H. Carle, Clerk of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Ms. Carle: I enclose herewith a report for the 104th Congress of the Legislative Review Activities of the Committee on International Relations in accordance with section 136 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended by section 118 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, as amended by Public Law 92-136. With best wishes, Sincerely, Benjamin A. Gilman, Chairman. Union Calendar No. 485 104th Congress Report HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 2d Session 104-883 _______________________________________________________________________ LEGISLATIVE REVIEW ACTIVITIES _______ January 2, 1997.--Committed to the Committee on the Whole House on the State of the Union and ordered to be printed _______________________________________________________________________ Mr. Gilman, from the Committee on International Relations, submitted the following R E P O R T I. INTRODUCTION: OVERSIGHT IN THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS FIELD A. Authorities for Legislative Review The responsibilities and potentialities of legislative review are reflected in the multiple authorities which are available to the Committee on International Relations. The most prominent is section 118 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-510): Legislative Review by Standing Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives (a) Scope of assistance. In order to assist the Congress in-- (1) Its analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of the application, administration, and execution of the laws enacted by the Congress, and (2) Its formulation, consideration, and enactment of such modifications of or changes in those laws, and of such additional legislation, as may be necessary or appropriate, each standing committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall review and study, on a continuing basis, the application, administration, and execution of those laws, or parts of laws, the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of that committee. Such committees may carry out the required analysis, appraisals, and evaluation themselves, or by contract, or may require a Government agency to do so and furnish a report thereon to the Congress. Such committees may rely on such techniques as pilot testing, analysis of costs in comparison with benefits, or provision for evaluation after a defined period of time.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Section 701 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344) amended the original mandate and authority of the 1970 act by adding the last two sentences regarding program review and evaluation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A second type of authority fostering legislative review is the special oversight granted by the House Committee Reform Amendments of 1974 (H. Res. 988, approved Oct. 8, 1974). Special oversight, which is intended to enable committees to conduct comprehensive oversight of matters directly bearing upon their specified responsibilities even if those matters fall within the jurisdiction of other standing committees, permits an expansion of the legislative review jurisdiction of a committee. The Committee on International Relations currently has special oversight jurisdiction in four areas under clause 3(d) of House Rule X. 3. (d) The Committee on International Relations shall have the function of reviewing and studying, on a continuing basis, all laws, programs, and Government activities dealing with or involving customs administration, intelligence activities relating to foreign policy, international financial and monetary organizations, and international fishing agreements. Frequently reporting requirements in legislation obligate various agencies, directly or through the President, to submit reports of certain activities to the Committee on International Relations to the Speaker of the House, who then transmits them to the committee. The House Committee on International Relations is the recipient of one of the largest quantities of required reports from the executive branch. In addition to the authorities noted above, the congressional budget process provides the committee with another important tool for oversight. Pursuant to section 301(c) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974, each standing committee of the House is required to submit to the Committee on the budget, no later than March 15 of each year, a report containing its views and estimates on the President's proposed budget for the coming fiscal year. This requirement affords the committee and its subcommittees the opportunity to review those items in the President's budget which fall under the committee's jurisdiction, and to establish possible guidelines for subsequent action on authorizing legislation. A final authority which can have an impressive oversight impact is implicit in the authorization process. Regular and frequent reauthorization of programs or agency operations by committees presents the opportunity to investigate administrative personnel hiring and promotion practices, agency organization, employee development and benefit programs, policy guidance, and administrative rules and regulations regarding the implementation and execution of policy, among other items. The authorization process also permits program evaluation, an important oversight technique. The legislative review activities of the Committee on International Relations are sanctioned by various and extensive authorities--the basic mandate of the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act, the broadened jurisdiction and special oversight provided by the House Committee Reform Amendments of 1974, statutory reporting requirements, and the authorization process. B. Oversight Developments in the Committee on International Relations During the 95th Congress, the committee received jurisdictional authority over export controls involving nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware, and international commodity agreements involving cooperation in the export of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware. This new jurisdictional authority was provided for by House Resolution 5, which passed the House on January 4, 1977. In the 96th Congress, the committee's jurisdiction was not enlarged. However, the committee in its organization for the 96th Congress reduced the number of subcommittees from nine to eight. Deleted was the Subcommittee on International Development whose jurisdiction included: (1) Dealing with the Agency for International Development and other U.S. agencies' operations affecting development; (2) administration of foreign assistance; (3) oversight of multilateral assistance programs; (4) population and food programs; and (5) legislation and oversight with respect to the Peace Corps, which was subsumed by the full committee. The subcommittees for the 96th Congress, representing a mix of geographical and functional responsibilities, were as follows: Subcommittee on International Security and Scientific Affairs; Subcommittee on International Operations; Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East; Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade; Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs; Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs; Subcommittee on Africa; and Subcommittee on International Organizations. In the 97th Congress, the subcommittees remained the same with the exception of the Subcommittee on International Organizations, whose name was changed to the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations, in order to delineate clearly its jurisdiction over the subject of human rights. In the 98th Congress, the subcommittees remained the same, however, the name of the Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs was changed to the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. In addition, a special task force was created under the aegis of the full committee, the Task Force on International Narcotics Control. The purpose of this task force was to provide oversight of narcotics-related developments and programs over which the committee has jurisdiction pursuant to rule X of the Rules of the House, which included the following: Narcotics control programs conducted by the Department of State; Narcotics-related projects carried out by the Agency for International Development (AID); Overseas activities of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Department of Defense; and the U.S. Customs Service; Narcotics control programs carried out by international organizations; Intelligence issues related to narcotics trafficking and control; Prisoner exchange programs and their impact on U.S. narcotics control efforts; Narcotics interdiction programs and agreement; Narcotics- related efforts by the U.S. Information Agency; and Relationship between international banking/financial transactions and narcotics trafficking. Because of the importance of narcotics control issues, the Task Force was reconstituted every six months through the 102nd Congress. Subcommittee structure remained the same for the 99th Congress; however, the name of the Subcommittee on International Security and Scientific Affairs was changed to the Subcommittee on Arms Control, International Security and Science. This change was made to reflect the committee's and subcommittee's concern over the important issues of arms control. The jurisdiction of the subcommittee was redefined in the rules of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to read, ``To deal with * * * all aspects of arms control and disarmament with particular emphasis on the investigation and evaluation of arms control and disarmament proposals and concepts; * * *''. Under the Rules of the House, the Committee on International Relations has jurisdiction over issues involving international terrorism pursuant to rule X of the Rules of the House, paragraphs (I)(1), (I)(4-10), and (I)(12-16). For the 99th Congress, two subcommittee jurisdictional changes were made to reflect the committee's concern with international terrorism. The Subcommittee on Arms Control, International Security and Science was given jurisdiction over ``* * * international terrorism with special focus on the U.S. Government's policies and programs for combating international terrorist movements and actions; * * *''. The Subcommittee on International Operations jurisdictional responsibility was redefined to include ``* * * international terrorism with special emphasis on policies and programs relating to the enhancement for embassy security and the protection of U.S. personnel and institutions abroad; * * *''. In addition, two subcommittees had language added to their respective definitions providing responsibility for oversight of international communication and information policy. Lastly, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations was given the responsibility for international law. No changes were made in subcommittee structure or jurisdiction for the 100th, 101st, or 102nd Congresses. In the 103rd Congress, the Committee was required by the Rules of the Democratic Caucus to reduce the number of subcommittees from eight to six. However, due to concern about retaining a subcommittee with exclusive focus on Africa, the Committee received a waiver of Rule 35(B) of the Democratic Caucus and retained seven subcommittees. The Subcommittee on Arms Control, International Security, and Science, and the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations were merged to create the Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights. The jurisdiction of that subcommittee was essentially a merger of the jurisdictions of the two subcommittees. However, specific reference to ``* * * law enforcement issues to include terrorism and narcotics control programs and activities * * *'' was added to the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, thereby consolidating all jurisdiction over narcotics and terrorism in one subcommittee. The Committee also added specific reference to environmental issues to the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade and changed the name of the subcommittee to the Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment to reflect that addition. In addition, jurisdiction over the operating expenses of the Agency for International Development and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was added to the Subcommittee on International Operations. Finally, the Committee made minor conforming changes to the names of two of its regional subcommittees. In the 104th Congress, pursuant to H. Res. 6, passed January 4, 1995, the name of the Committee was changed from ``Foreign Affairs'' to ``International Relations''. In addition, the number of subcommittees was decreased from seven to five. The Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights, and the Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East were dissolved. The Europe and Middle East Subcommittee jurisdiction was reabsorbed by the full Committee. The Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment dropped ``environment'' from its title, returning its name to the ``Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade.'' The Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights and the Subcommittee on International Operations were combined, with a name change to ``Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights''. C. Oversight Activities and Criteria The oversight activities of the Committee on International Relations include a variety of instruments and mechanisms--full committee and subcommittee hearings, members'' and staff study missions abroad, special Congressional Research Service studies, and General Accounting Office assistance and reports in the field of international relations. Committee and subcommittee hearings may be conducted for numerous purposes and may serve more than one function, i.e., oversight, legislation, public education simultaneously. Thus, oversight may exist even when the hearing is not explicitly intended for that purpose. The criteria for determining whether a hearing performs the oversight function were identified by the House Select Committee on Committees in 1973 and are as follows: \\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ U.S. Congress, House. Select Committee on Committees. Committee Reform Amendments of 1974. Report, 93rd Congress, 2d session, March 21, 1974 (H.Rept.No. 93-916, Part II). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) To review and control unacceptable forms of bureaucratic behavior; (2) To insure that bureaucracy implements the policy objectives of the Congress; (3) To analyze national and international problems requiring Federal action; and (4) To determine the effectiveness of legislative programs and policies. These same purposes help to define other committee activity which relates to its legislative review function. It should be noted that not all such activity can be included in this report. Oversight may occur informally, not only through the formal processes and mechanisms noted above. Informal discussions between committee members and executive branch officials may constitute oversight in certain instances as may staff examination of agency activity and behavior and staff consultation with agency personnel apart from the normal hearing process. In summary, the legislative review activities of the House Committee on International Relations for the 104th Congress rely on extensive authorities embodied in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 and reinforced through the authorization process, subsequent legislation, and reporting requirements. D. Oversight Activities of the Committee on International Relations-- 104th Congress The following section is set out in compliance with Clause (1)(d)(3) of Rule XI. Almost all of the Committee's day-to-day activities, including hearings and informal meetings, involve oversight of the Administration or afford the Committee the opportunity to learn the impact of United States foreign policy. The Committee's Oversight Plan is set out below in full. Although the Committee did not conduct every hearing planned, most oversight issues were accomplished to some degree or addressed in some way, such as through briefings or staff work. (Adopted by the Committee, February 14, 1995; numbering scheme adopted April, 1995). Committee on International Relations Oversight Plan Rule X, clause 2 (d) of the Rules of the House of Representatives requires that each standing Committee adopt an oversight plan for the two-year period of the Congress and to submit the plan to the Committees on Government Reform and Oversight and House Oversight not later than February 15 of the first session of the Congress. This is the oversight plan of the Committee on International Relations for the 104th Congress. It includes the areas in which the Committee intended to conduct oversight during this Congress. As the Committee's priorities change, the oversight work of the Committee may change. The fact that an issue is listed here does not mean that the Committee necessarily held a formal meeting devoted solely to that issue, but means that the Committee hoped to cover the issue during the course of its oversight work. general A. Ongoing Meetings with Administration and Foreign Leaders A-1. The Committee and its subcommittees, and individual members, especially the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, will continue to meet, informally and in formal sessions, with members of the President's Cabinet and officials at all levels within the Executive branch. These meetings allow the Committee and its members to raise issues relating to the conduct of foreign affairs and other matters within its oversight jurisdiction. A-2. Committee members meet, as an element of the oversight process, with heads of state and government, cabinet ministers, and parliamentarians from around the world. In the 103rd Congress, the Committee held over 200 meetings of this nature; in the 104th Congress, the Committee expects to maintain that pace. In addition, Committee staff meet with countless foreign visitors on an informal basis. These meetings, inter alia, allow the Committee to evaluate the effectiveness of U.S. diplomacy with respect to our relations with these visitors' countries and third countries. B. Evaluation of Foreign Assistance Programs; the Future of the Agency for International Development. B-1. Structure of Foreign Aid in the Post-Cold-War World: who, what and how? Including evaluation of foreign aid institutions. (Winter/Spring, 1995). B-2. Duplication/Overlap in Foreign Assistance. What foreign assistance (and technical cooperation) is being administered outside of AID/State Department? (Spring, 1995). B-3.

(Spring, 1995) C-5. Arms Control. Review implementation of arms control treaties and agreements including the START treaties, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the CFE Treaty, the ABM Treaty, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Missile Technology Control Regime and other arms control and nonproliferation agreements.

The Committee will examine Administration efforts to eradicate slavery throughout the world, with particular attention to the situation in Mauritania and the Sudan. Additional matters taken up included reports of political murders in Haiti, and matters related to Bosnia. Substantially all of the Committee's hearings (see section IV), involved oversight, with the exception of hearings held by the full Committee and Subcommittees on specific legislation. The results of the Committee's oversight have included the public attention to matters raised as a result of the Committee's hearings and other activities; the adoption of legislation such as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act and the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, and legislation reforming certain foreign assistance and ship transfer authorities (Pub. L. 104-164). In addition, the oversight activities of the Committee helped prepare for Committee and full House action on legislation such as H.R. 7 and H.R. 1561, described elsewhere, which were not enacted into law. The Committee believes that its attention to oversight has helped provide Congress and the American public with an opportunity to better evaluate the foreign policy developed by the Administration and has helped provide the Administration with feedback on these important matters from the Members of Congress and the public. II. GENERAL REVIEW ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE A. Executive Branch Reports Reporting requirements in legislation and the reports submitted in response to them constitute one of the oldest information systems used by Congress. On every subject with which Congress deals, required reports offer a way to oversee and review the implementation of legislation by the executive branch. In the foreign policy field, it is particularly important to insure that reporting requirements and the resultant reports submitted by the executive branch are an efficient mechanism for supplying Congress with information. Information on domestic problems is often easier to obtain from sources outside the executive branch than information on problems from abroad. Moreover, the executive branch has sometimes attempted to shield its activities in the foreign policy field from public view and treat it as its exclusive domain. The lack of information on foreign policy problems and executive branch activities has been one of the major reasons it has been more difficult for Congress to play its legitimate role in the making of foreign policy, although the Constitution expressly shares such powers between Congress and the President. For the Committee on International Relations, the improvement of the system of required reports offers another step toward a better supply of information that Congress needs to make foreign policy decisions. Through the careful placing of reporting requirements in legislation, Congress can improve its capacity for an effective foreign policy role. B. Reference Documents Periodically the Committee on International Relations compiles, prints, and distributes official documents which are useful to the membership in exercising the oversight function as well as other responsibilities. The following is a listing of those compilations for the 104th Congress: 1.

The volumes include all laws concerning foreign relations, codified and in force, treaties in force, as well as executive agreements and orders, State Department regulations and State Department delegations of authorities as of October 31, 1996. 2. Legislative Calendar.--This compendium of committee legislative information is published annually.
