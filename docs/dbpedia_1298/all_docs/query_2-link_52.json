        "text": "Night Man is an American action/adventure/sci-fi series that aired in syndication from 15 September, 1997 to 17 May, 1999. The series is loosely based on a comic book published by Malibu Comics and was created by Steve Englehart (the original comic title was The Night Man) and developed for television by Glen A. Larson.\n\nIt stars Matt McColm as the title character, a superhero whose real name was Johnny Domino, a saxophonist. Englehart would write three episodes of the series. Nightman is also one of the few series to cross over with characters from Larson's previous series: in the episode \"Manimal\", Johnny allies with Professor Jonathan Chase, the star of the short-lived 1980s' series Manimal. The show aired nationally on WGN Superstation from its premiere through 2005."
