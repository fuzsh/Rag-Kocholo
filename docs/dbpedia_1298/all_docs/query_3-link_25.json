        "text": "The Cape\n\nIf for no other reason than that its supporting cast included the magnificent Keith David, CBS’s The Cape should have had a long and healthy life on television. Alas, this 2010-11 midseason replacement was quickly doomed by lukewarm reviews and dismal ratings, more than likely the byproduct of a thoroughly convoluted (if still fairly exciting) premise involving an honest cop (David Lyons) framed for murder by a criminal mastermind (James Frain) who thinks he’s killed his patsy — but he’s really only driven him underground, where he’s been schooled in the ways of combat and trickery (as well as outfitted with a nifty cape, ergo the series title) and reborn as a hero hellbent on exposing the crimes of his nemesis. Originally booked for a 13-episode run, The Cape was cut to 10 installments, the last of which was subject to the then-unique indignity of airing only on the network’s website — but it did at least walk away with an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup For A Series, Miniseries, Movie Or A Special.\n\nCaptain Nice\n\nA sort of goofy precursor to The Greatest American Hero with a Captain America twist, 1967’s short-lived Captain Nice followed the clumsy adventures of Carter Nash (William Daniels), a nebbish police chemist who ingests a “super serum” that endows him with special powers (strength, invulnerability, flying) without making him particularly heroic. Garbed in a uniform made and monogrammed by his mother (the incredible Alice Ghostley), Carter Nash becomes Captain Nice and gets himself mixed up in all sorts of goings-on, all while remaining blissfully ignorant of the affections of meter maid Candy Kane (Ann Prentiss). Although it had a solid creative pedigree, springing from the mind of Get Smart co-mastermind Buck Henry, Captain Nice was always campier than funny, and after 15 episodes, NBC had seen enough.\n\nElectra Woman and Dyna Girl\n\nSid & Marty Kroft, better known for their puppet shows and Land of the Lost, attempted their own superhero show in 1976 with Electra Woman and Dyna Girl. Days of Our Lives’ Diedre Hall and actress Judy Strangis starred the titular Electra-duo. The pair used advanced “Electra” branded devices — like the Electra-Beam and the Electra-Strobe — to fight supervillains while aided by scientist Frank Heflin (Norman Alden) at the ElectraBase. After producing sixteen 12-minute segments for their Saturday morning Kroft Supershow, the Krofts chose not to produce additional material during Supershow’s second season. Forgotten by audiences at large, it was memorable to handful of TV executives, leading to an unaired 2001 WB pilot featuring Night Court’s Markie Post and a 2016 webseries starring Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart.\n\nMan-Thing\n\nUndoubtedly one of the odder heroes to shamble out of the Marvel hivemind during the publisher’s occasionally trippy late 1960s-mid-1970s run, Man-Thing is the unfortunate aftermath of a spy ambush meant to steal the work of a biochemist trying to recreate the “super soldier serum” that created Captain America — when he injects himself with the serum in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, then crashes his car into a swamp that also happens to house the Nexus of All Realities, Dr. Ted Sallis mystically merges with the muck to become the virtually indestructible creature who brings burning pain to all those who know fear (in other words, just about anyone who sees a lumbering red-eyed giant in the middle of a swamp). This 2005 TV movie, which originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel, altered vast chunks of the Man-Thing’s origin (Ted Sallis is now a Seminole chieftain rather than a scientist, for starters) and made it more of a murderous beast than an interdimensional guardian, leaving Man-Thing a low-budget horror movie that served as an adaptation of its alleged inspiration pretty much in name only — and a missed opportunity to present a fun, enthusiastically goofy B-movie version of one of Marvel’s cultiest cult favorites.\n\nMutant X\n\nFox’s ownership of the film and TV rights to Marvel’s X-Men characters enabled the publisher to see some of its heroes on the screen at a time when they weren’t able to adapt those titles themselves, but it has also been a source of persistent complication between the companies — and occasionally the basis for a lawsuit, as was the case when Marvel produced Mutant X, a syndicated series about a bio-geneticist named Adam Kane (John Shea) whose remorse over having helped create a generation of mutants leads him to round up and lead a group of genetically altered heroes on a mission to protect and train mutants at risk of being harmed or exploited. The story possibilities were fairly endless, and the ratings were sufficiently healthy for three full seasons’ worth of episodes, but Fox sued the various companies involved, arguing that Mutant X was a breach of their licensing agreement. Marvel eventually settled out of court, leaving its production partners Tribune Entertainment and Fireworks Entertainment to continue fighting on their own — and when Fireworks went bankrupt, Mutant X died a sudden death.\n\nNight Man\n\nYears after Manimal faded into the annals of misbegotten TV crimefighters, the show’s creator, Glen A. Larson, got a second shot at helping develop a small-screen superhero with Night Man, a syndicated (and loosely Marvel-derived) series about a saxophone player (Matt McColm) who acquires the ability to telepathically detect evil (but is no longer able to sleep) after being struck by lightning. Did we mention that this poor fellow’s name is Johnny Domino? Given its intensely silly premise, visibly low budget, and a supporting cast that briefly included Taylor Dayne, it’s perhaps most surprising that the show managed to last for two seasons, enjoying a 44-episode run (during which Night Man came across Little Richard and Donald Trump as well as Manimal) before disappearing into the darkness.\n\nNo Ordinary Family\n\nBefore ABC had access to the Marvel Comics library of characters, it tried to grow its own superhero TV show. The result was not fondly remembered, if recalled at all. The Shield’s Michael Chiklis starred as Jim Powell, the patriarch of a regular California family that survives a plane crash in the Amazon and gains special powers. Once home, they attempted to balance family dysfunctions with their new calling as heroes. Despite being co-created by future Arrow and Flash innovator Greg Berlanti, the show’s sci-fi dramedy format, a strange fit for ABC at the time, bled viewers. Picked up for a full season in October of 2010 thanks to a strong premiere, the order was cut to twenty episodes early the next year and canceled in May of 2011.\n\nPowers\n\nBased on the comic book by Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Avon Oeming, Powers had the best of intentions, but lacked a wide enough platform to be seen. District 9’s Sharlto Copley starred as Detective Christian Walker, a cop assigned to the LAPD’s Powers Division whose beat included crimes perpetuated by or against extranormal individuals. The first season saw Walker — once a costumed hero himself — investigating his former mentor and facing the temptation to regain his powers. While featuring an interesting premise and a handful of good performances, the production values left a lot to be desired. Also, the show was only available on Sony Playstation consoles via its Playstation Network; severely limiting its availability as a first-run program. A second season was ordered, but Sony soon pulled the plug after the series debuted in May of 2016.\n\nSwamp Thing\n\nDespite surviving for three seasons, USA’s Swamp Thing aired long before basic cable channels were known for quality original content. The series did little to change that reputation. Stuntman Dick Durock reprised his title role from the Swamp Thing feature films as Alec Holland, a scientist burned and left for dead by the twisted Dr. Anton Arcane (Mark Lindsay Chapman). Instead of dying, he became a supernatural vegetable creature dedicated to keeping the evil men do out of his swamp. Initially campy and family-friendly, the show would become a darker tale after its thirteenth episode. But with episodes aired out of order, and the generally poor quality of writing, the show never amassed more than cult following. Ironically, that following led to some of USA’s best ratings at the time — which gives you an idea of how small cable audiences were thirty years ago. Today, most are surprised to learn that the show ever existed."
