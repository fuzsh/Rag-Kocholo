American animated sitcomThe Simpsons, which ran its first episode in December 1989, has grown 500-episode old now.

The show, which began as filler in The Tracey Ullman Show, is in its 23rd season, but Homer and the rest of theSimpsonsshow no signs of retiring as the Simpsons family has been still around and entertaining.

The 500th episode of the show would be aired on Sunday. Not only is the show the longest running animated series, but it is also the longest running prime time comedy series in American television history.

Asked how long will theSimpsonsstay around, Nancy Cartwright -- known for her role as Bart Simpson -- said, "You know, as long as we stay healthy and alive."

"I think we can go, and I would personally like to be 82 years old and walking down Hollywood Boulevard... I think that would be way fun," she added.

The show has been successful because of many factors, its timelessness, the family's ability to reinvent itself and the fact that the Simpsons are completely immersed in pop culture.
