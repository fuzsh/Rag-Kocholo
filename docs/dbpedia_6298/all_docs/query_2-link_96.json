        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis is the first content-analysis study that focuses on instances of smoking in The Simpsons television show. This show depicts almost 800 instances of smoking over the 400 episodes in its first 18 years. Most instances of smoking involved male characters, which was not surprising, given that almost two-thirds of the characters on the show were male. Overall, the characters shown smoking were adults in most instances (76%), with children and adolescents only involved in 8% of instances.\n\nThere have been previous content-analysis studies assessing tobacco use and other health-related behaviours in television and the media that have included The Simpsons.3-5 A content analysis of New Zealand television in 2002–2004 reported that The Simpsons cartoon show had the highest number of characters smoking (average five per episode), compared with another 119 programs viewed as part of the analysis.4 In another content-analysis study, 63 episodes of The Simpsons (seven randomly selected from each of the first nine seasons) were watched to determine the types of health-related messages (HRMs) present in the show.3 The HRMs involved nutrition, smoking, alcohol, drug use, physical health, mental health, and others. This study found 129 instances (12% of all HRMs) associated with smoking (ranked third after nutrition and alcohol); of these, 104 were negative, 20 were neutral and 5 were positive. This difference may be the result of episodes being randomly selected or because of differences in the classification of the impact of each instance of smoking.\n\nOur study too reports the impact of instances of smoking in terms of their being positive, negative or neutral, and we found that most were neutral, fewer were negative and least were positive. An important finding in our study was that instances of smoking with a negative impact (reflecting smoking in an unfavourable way) occurred much more often among children or adolescents than among adult characters. We also observed several instances of drug use associated with smoking (eg, bong, crack cocaine, opium, marijuana) as well as alcohol consumption.\n\nThe most notable characters on The Simpsons who smoked cigarettes were Patty and Selma (Marge’s sisters), Krusty the Clown, and Mrs Krabappel (Bart’s school teacher), all of whom were main characters. It is also important to note that Patty and Selma, the show’s most prolific smokers, started smoking as teenagers, which caused them to develop their raspy voices as shown in an episode during Season 2. Another prominent smoking character is Krusty the Clown, who had the second highest number of smoking instances; in the series, he has his own television show, which is aimed at children, and he has many followers and much influence. Krusty has health problems (most likely the result of his smoking) which include requiring a pacemaker.\n\nPrevious studies have highlighted the influence of onscreen use of tobacco by movie stars on adolescents, and the increased likelihood of these adolescents taking up smoking.6 Moreover, other research has found that very young children (aged 3–6 years) see, understand and remember cigarette advertising,7 and the use of cartoon characters like Joe Camel by RJR Nabisco has been reported to be more effective in marketing cigarettes to children than to adults.8 A more recent study has suggested that children who watch a lot of television are more likely to start smoking at a younger age.9 Indeed, the consensus appears to indicate that there is a causal relationship between exposure to movie and television depictions of smoking and the initiation of smoking among children and adolescents.10 If this is true, children and adolescents who watch The Simpsons and observe the characters who smoke cigarettes may be influenced to take up smoking, despite more instances of smoking being reflected in a negative way (35%) or neutral way (63%) than a positive way (2%). Just being exposed to The Simpsons characters smoking in so many episodes may prompt children to consider smoking at an early age."
