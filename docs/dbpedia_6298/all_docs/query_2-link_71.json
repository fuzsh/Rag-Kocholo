        "text": "Bart’s desperately miserable teacher Mrs. Krabappel-Flanders was a longtime fan favorite, and Marcia Wallace won an Emmy in 1992 for portraying her. However, when Wallace passed away from cancer in 2013, the showrunners decided to retire the character rather than recast her. The Simpsons never explained how she died, but has indicated that it was once again Homer’s fault.\n\nMrs. Krabappel-Flanders’ final appearance comes in the 2014 episode “The Man Who Grew Too Much,” when Ned sees her in a dream. In 2021, The Simpsons gave the character a proper send-off by airing an episode in which Bart discovers her diary and learns that despite her cynical exterior she actually wanted him to succeed. The show used clips of previous lines by Wallace, cleared by her estate, to create a voiceover for the scene.\n\nSpringfield jazz legend “Bleeding Gums” Murphy made a handful of appearances across The Simpsons’s first six seasons, often serving as Lisa’s musical mentor, until he met his untimely death in the episode “Round Springfield.” In it, Lisa discovers Bleeding Gums is in the hospital while she’s visiting Bart, who’s eaten a “jagged metal Krusty-O.\" Bleeding Gums helps Lisa prepare for her school musical recital but passes away of unspecified causes before he can hear how it went, which prompts Lisa to go on a mission to share his music with the town. “Round Springfield” is considered one of the show’s most emotional episodes from the early seasons. “The Simpsons” continued the story of the Murphy family in Season 33, when Lisa meets his son Monk, who’s deaf, then helps him secure royalties for his father’s music.\n\nOn Mother’s Day 2008, The Simpsons gave fans a downer of an episode by killing off Homer’s mother, Mona, the free-spirited 1960’s radical who spent decades on the lam and thus didn’t have a relationship with her son. Voiced by Glenn Close, Mona made three visits to Springfield during The Simpsons run, all of which were given their own episodes. In the second of those, “My Mother, the Car Jacker” from 2003, the law finally catches up to Mona, and during her subsequent escape from prison she’s thought to have died when she commandeers a bus and drives it off a cliff. Her actual death five years later is a bit more prosaic, she simply dies while sitting in front of a fire. The episode explores her death’s impact on Homer, who gets the news just after deciding to reconcile with her. Homer is then tasked with scattering her ashes, which he of course screws up, accidentally dumping them into a missile launching system owned by Mr. Burns. It all works out in the end though, as the ashes prevent the missile from launching and depositing Springfield’s nuclear waste in the Amazon rainforest, thus giving Mona one last activist victory.\n\nThe demise of Maude Flanders has more to do with behind-the-scenes Simpsons drama rather than storytelling, although it did happen for that reason, too. First, some background. For most of the series, most of the recurring characters have been voiced by a “core six” of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. Obviously many other performers have lent their voices to the show, and one for the most prolific was Maggie Roswell, who voiced Reverend Lovejoy’a wife Helen, Lisa’s teacher Miss Hoover, Milhous’s mother Luann, and Maude Flanders, among others.\n\nAfter the core six negotiated for raises in 2000, Roswell attempted to do the same. When Fox refused, she quit - according to her version of events. Fox contended that the reason for her leaving was because she refused to commute to Los Angeles from her home in Denver. While the showrunners opted to recast Roswell’s other roles, Al Jean explained that he decided to kill off Maude to explore her death’s effect on Ned, Rod, and Todd. The show gave her a suitably silly death by having her get knocked off the bleachers at a stock car race by a t-shirt cannon barrage intended for Homer. Ned, meanwhile, became embittered but did eventually marry Ms. Krabappel - who also appears on this list. Poor Ned.\n\nJoe Mantegna’s mob boss character Anthony “Fat Tony” D’Amico first appeared in the Season 3 episode “Bart the Murderer,” and since then the underboss of Springfield’s mafia made several appearances, usually whenever the Simpson family dabbled in crime - one of the most memorable of those being the time when Marge enlisted them to muscle out the snack food competition to help her soft pretzel business.\n\nFat Tony meets his end in the 2010 episode “Donnie Fatso,” in which Homer is forced to infiltrate Fat Tony’s organization for the police. When Fat Tony eventually realizes Homer is a rat, the shock gives him a heart attack and kills him. However, for those who grew to love the character, all was not lost. In that same episode, Fat Tony’s cousin, a physically fit mobster nicknamed “Fit Tony,” arrives and takes over the crime family. The stress of the job causes him to overeat and become “Fit-Fat Tony,” identical to Fat Tony. Mantegna, who refused to allow anyone else to play Fat Tony, also voices Fit-Fat Tony.\n\nBeatrice, we hardly knew ye. She appeared in the seventh episode of Season 2, “Old Money,” and served as the catalyst for an episode that explores dating and loss in the senior citizen community - and it’s a classic example of an early Simpsons tearjerker episode.\n\nIn it, Grampa Simpson meets Beatrice at the Springfield Retirement Castle when their medicines get switched. They fall in love and start a relationship. But on Bea’s birthday, Homer unknowingly abducts Abe and forces him to attend the monthly family trip to “Discount Lion Safari.” Thinking Abe stood her up, Bea dies of a broken heart. Abe is furious with Homer until Bea’ ghost encourages him to reconcile. Then, Abe learns Bea has willed him a large sum of money, which he uses to renovate the Retirement Castle in her memory.\n\nBea is mentioned two more times in the series, once when her photo is seen and once when her tombstone is shown, and labeled (“Grampa’s Girlfriend”). Otherwise that’s the last we hear of her."
