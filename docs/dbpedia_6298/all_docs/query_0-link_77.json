        "text": "Anyone who has ever worked in the animation industry will tell you that cartoons are not just for kids. An animated primetime television program for children as well as adults. That’s why cartoon channels such as Cartoon Network are favored by kids and adults alike. MTV and Cartoon Network started running regular cartoon shows, showing people cartoons. With the advent of the animated show on FOX, an entire evening was devoted to it.\n\nThe first animated series produced for prime time\n\nThe Flintstones first premiered on the ABC Television Network (USA) in September 1960 and was the first animated television program. first in the world. A modern take on suburban life in the Stone Age, the cartoon was first broadcast in April 1966.\n\nSome have argued that Flintstones aren’t the first animated series to hit primetime television. In 1956, CBS aired The Boing-Boing Show from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., after prime time, and did not air until April 1957, when it was cancelled. Between May 30 and October 3, 1958, shows were rerun on Fridays between 7:30 p.m. and 8 p.m., and these were broadcast in the golden hour frame.\n\nAnimation show on-air’s trend after the first animated series on prime time\n\nHuckleberry Finn’s New Adventure and Where’s the Conversation was one of the first primetime animated shows to appear on television, both in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe Bugs Bunny /Road Runner Show aired in prime time on CBS for a brief period in the summer of 1976. Jokebooks, which began on NBC on April 23, 1982, were a compilation of cartoons aired weekly. The characters are played by real actors and the environment is created with animation.\n\nFor example, each episode of The Alvin Show has one part featuring Alvin and Chipmunks as well as two musical segments and one featuring Clyde Crashcup.\n\nThe series mark animation shows as mainstream on prime time\n\nIn 1989, an animated sketch on “The Tracey Ullman Show” introduced the world to The Simpsons’ family. This show, more than any other, has modeled for shows like The Simpsons and The Family Guy.\n\nIt was Flintstones who introduced the concept to America and the rest of the world. However, it was not until The Simpsons that the animated series began to receive the recognition it deserved from the mainstream.\n\nTechnical changes to make animation production process shortened to meet on-air speed requirements\n\nAnimation is a time – and money -consuming or lengthy and costly process. When it comes to TV animation, production companies can’t wait three years to launch a project. Jay Ward is a true pioneer of limited animated television programming, which help to cut down the production and shorten the animation process. He was one of the first to do so. Ward and animator Alex Anderson were among the first to use the “limited animation” technique.\n\n–\n\nAnimost – Vietnam 3D Animation Studio\n\nhttps://animost.com\n\nhello@animost.com\n\n–\n\nReference Sources:"
