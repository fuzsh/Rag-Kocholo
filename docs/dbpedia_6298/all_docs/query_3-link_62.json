So, let’s get the conversation going! Oh and remember…just because this is posted here today doesn’t mean you can’t comment on it all week long. This open thread will still be open for comments long after today is over!\n\nHere’s where you can talk about anything you want to talk about…TSTO Related, Simpson’s Related or ANYTHING. Just no Add me requests…those should go here. We’ll give you a few suggestions (like most Sunday’s you can talk about the current episode of the Simpsons or current Tapped Out event) but for the most part, you’re free to talk about ANYTHING your little Tapping Fingers desire…just keep it PG.\n\nSo, here is your Open Thread…..\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIt was nine years ago, just after the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs bracket was complete that I thought it might be cool to do a The Simpsons Tapped Out bracket. Here we are nine years later, and it’s time for our tenth TSTO Addicts Bracket Battle!\n\nFollowing a great Paris Summer Olympics, in which Canada set a record for most gold medals and most medals in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics, it’s time to think about all the different Olympic mascots The Simpsons has brought us. With that in mind, we present to you TSTO Addicts’ Favourite Olympic Mascot Bracket Battle.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nFirst up …\n\nIf you haven’t already I suggest reading these 2 posts:\n\nNew Land, New Limits and New Bugs\n\nand A Thanks to the Studio\n\nThe short version:\n\n• 960 new Land tiles, and yes it is new land\n\n• Item Limits upped from 16 to 18 thousand\n\n• Golden Goose Realty now in the Permanent Store\n\nWoohoo !! Thanks again to the Studio\n\nFor US players on Kindles:\n\nAmazon strikes again and the option to buy this is missing.\n\nIt is an Amazon mistake that needs Amazon to fix it, so go complain to them. Hopefully if enough of you do and they realise they’re missing out on making money they’ll sort it faster.\n\nThanks to all of you who commented to confirm this. I managed to flag it on Wednesday night so EA are aware and will be trying to resolve it with Amazon too.\n\nLet me know if it gets fixed, ta.\n\nRight, on with the post …\n\nIt’s time to take a look at the cash offering for this event:\n\nFuture Wiggum (Character)\n\nAs ever this isn’t exactly a Should I Buy, more like it’s a look at what you get if you decide to spend some real money so you can make your own minds up.\n\nHere’s what’s in this post:\n\n• Basic info\n\n• Questline with Dialog\n\n• Permanent tasks\n\nLets get started then, shall we . . .\n\nContinue reading →\n\nFirst up …\n\nIf you haven’t already I suggest reading these 2 posts:\n\nNew Land, New Limits and New Bugs\n\nand A Thanks to the Studio\n\nThe short version:\n\n• 960 new Land tiles, and yes it is new land\n\n• Item Limits upped from 16 to 18 thousand\n\n• Golden Goose Realty now in the Permanent Store\n\nWoohoo !!

Here it is for my C Town which does need it …\n\nTTFN\n\nThis is a good news / bad news kinda post, so I’ll get the bad news out of the way first …\n\nThe bad news:\n\nWith added good news following today’s patch (aug 8 2024)\n\nIn-app purchase woes:\n\nEA are aware of this.\n\nThanks to those of you who posted so I could flag it last night.\n\nThe advice to complain to Amazon still applies though …\n\nIt seems like Amazon US either never fixed this or they’ve done it again. It is an Amazon problem that needs Amazon to fix it, so do go and complain to Amazon and make them realise how many of you they’re causing problems for.\n\nIt works for Kindles in the UK, but not in the US it seems.\n\nI ask you also comment here for 2 reasons.\n\n1: so I know it’s really happening and 2: because if I get enough reports I can flag this for EA to weigh in on it for you too.\n\nI need you to confirm what country you’re in and what device so if the following is spot on copy n paste it into a comment, or edit the Country / Device to suit your problem if it’s close …\n\nI play in the US\n\nI play on a Kindle\n\nMy app store does not have the option to buy Future Wiggum\n\nBe nice to hear if it’s fixed too, ta.\n\nGround Tile woes:FIXED\n\nTested all the Ground Tiles and they now all work on the new land\n\n(aug 8 2024 patch)\n\nFirst up – EA are aware and I’m hoping this is patched quickly.\n\nAs I type if you go into Design Mode and pick any of theose Ground Tiles from the left-hand Build Menu then the game won’t let you place those on the new land. You also won’t be able to drag and drop an area with those tiles for now.\n\nContinue reading →"
