        "text": "Well, you say \"sitcom,\" so by that definition we're looking for an ongoing series of comedic television shows where the episodes involve the same characters in a more-or-less stable setting.\n\nThe first animated television series, by many accounts, was Crusader Rabbit, which ran from 1950-1959. It's not \"adult\" in any useful sense, and it's arguably too all-over-the-place to be a sitcom (but you include Rick and Morty in your examples, so your mileage may vary.)\n\nAnyhow, we know there weren't any adult animated sitcoms before 1950, because there weren't any animated television shows before 1950.\n\nThe real stickler here is what counts as \"adult.\" I see a few possible definitions:\n\nThe first is \"includes themes and jokes only adults will appreciate.\" This isn't that helpful, because a great many TV shows will throw in the occasional topical, or even risque, joke for the grownups in the audience.\n\nAnother definition is \"intentionally targeted at adults as well as kids.\" The answer by this definition is probably The Flintstones. It was based in large part on \"The Honeymooners,\" which certainly wasn't considered a kiddie show at the time, it was broadcast in the evening, and it included a lot of material that's more from adult experiences than kids'. There were lots of job-related issues, marriage-related issues, references to things like fraternal lodges and golf -- not the sort of thing you write if you're only looking to sell breakfast cereal.\n\nIt's a bit hokey now, but most TV was back then. For it's time, it was as much an adult show as the Simpsons."
