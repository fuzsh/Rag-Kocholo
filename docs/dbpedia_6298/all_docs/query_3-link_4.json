        "text": "Oregon is famous for a few things: Portland (it was just voted one of the best places to visit in the offseason by the Washington Post), our natural wonders like Mount Hood and Multnomah Falls, and having the REAL Springfield.\n\nOK, maybe it’s not really famous for that, but it should be. Springfield, Oregon, is the city that the Springfield of the beloved cartoon “The Simpsons” was modeled after, according to the show’s creator Matt Groening. In case you’ve missed it over the past 33 years and 34 seasons, “The Simpsons” follows a charming and often hilarious yellow animated family in their hometown of Springfield.\n\nIt had been long contested where the real Springfield was. But before the other Springfields get up in arms, Springfield, Oregon, has proof: In 2007, Groening signed a plaque that hangs proudly in City Hall and designates the city as the “real” Springfield.\n\nWhen you swing by Springfield, you’ll see how the city has leaned into the idea of being the inspiration for the show. You can go on a self-guided unofficial “Simpsons” tour and see things like murals of your favorite characters, the aforementioned plaque, a life size replica of the show’s famous living room and much more."
