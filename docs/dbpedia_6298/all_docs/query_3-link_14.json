        "text": "In episode 3G04 (Simpson Tide) there is a scene where Homer is correctly leading a submarine back to Springfield harbor. At the last second he decides to go the complete opposite direction and ends up in Russian waters. If you study a map the spot they were heading to was actually Cape Edgecumbe on the cost of Alaska.\n\nIn episode 5F03 (Bart Star) Hank Hill makes a cameo appearance and comments \"We drove 2000 miles for this?\" meaning that Arlen, Texas (which does not exist) is 2000 miles from springfield.\n\nThere are many other hints, but I just wanted to point out those two. I've stopped searching. Springfield isn't anywhere. The weather doesn't make sense and there are too many continuity problems for anybody to have answer to the question where is Springfield.\n\nIf you want to know more I suggest you follow this link:\n\nhttp://www.snpp.com/guides/springfield.list.html\n\nAccording to the \"Behind the Laughter\" episode, they are from Kentucky.\n\nAccording to the Halloween episode where Maggie is really an alien, they live on the southern coast, near Louisiana.\n\nSpringfield is a city in a constant state of change. Locations move from being within walking distance or field of view of one another to being on the other side of town. Furthermore, features spontaneously appear when convenient. Springfield apparently has a harbor, a mountain range, a forest, and much more, that do not appear in aerial views.\n\nThe Simpsons have been banned from 49 out of 50 states in the US, presumably including their home state because they are \"going to New Mexico\" or Arizona or somewhere in the Southwest.\n\nSpringfield has a number of \"towns\" like the Russian district, or \"Immigranttown\" (or whatever). Further, West Springfield is 3x the size of Texas.\n\nIn the end, there's too much evidence against any state for Springfield to be anywhere. It's just conveniently located where it is, to the advantage or disadvantage of whatever the story calls for.\n\nMy neighbor's son-in-law is a writer for The Simpsons. The reason that Springfield was chosen as the name of the city is because almost all 50 states have a Springfield. Don't count on them ever letting out which state the family lives in, because it'll never happen, unfortunately. That's why they love to tease us with it.\n\nDonno what episode or when, but I got the impression they where in Ohio, cuz Marge was on the phone, I believe ordering something and she started giving out the address...\n\nIn the middle of giving out the state, she said \"Hi\" to someone who walked in (Flander's Wife?), so it sounded like, \"Springfield, Ohi-Oh, Hi ___!\" (person who walked in).\n\nKinda sounds like SoCal the way you described it Arden, you can be at the mountains in snow (in winter of course), at the beach/harbor, forest, river in just an hour or two by car.\n\nI used to live about a mile from Bart!\n\nDonno if she still lives there, but now I'm about 12 miles from her. Wish I coulda met her. I knew someone who did too! Dangit!\n\nOriginally posted by Dlatu1983\n\nMy neighbor's son-in-law is a writer for The Simpsons. The reason that Springfield was chosen as the name of the city is because almost all 50 states have a Springfield. Don't count on them ever letting out which state the family lives in, because it'll never happen, unfortunately. That's why they love to tease us with it.\n\nI just saw an episode were the newscaster won a super lotto jackpot and cut off a breaking news story in cleveland, but that clue would be to obvious. That would only hold true assuming it was a local story.\n\nI might make sense. Springfield needs to be near water because there are a lot of episodes when they go to the beach, and take out a boat.\n\nSome people say there's no official state, but there is an episode were Lisa asked if we figured it out and to look closely because there are small clues. Also, there is an interview with a writer on E! that said that springfield is in a state.\n\nWell, let me know if anyone has anyother clues.\n\nMatt Groening grew up in Springfield Oregon. It's right next door to Eugene. He also went to The Evergreen State College, in Olympia, WA (the same Univ. that Rachel Corrie went to). Anyway, he chose the name because it is so common, it is meant to be every city USA. I think we can all identify with it in our own way because he does blend a little bit of every US city into it.\n\nThat is also part of its appeal in that nobody can say \"oh, those stupid ohioans, or oregonians or texans or whatever. I think we can rule out a few states though. Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming. Any others it wouldn't take place in?\n\nHere are two things that make it impossible.\n\nIn many episodes it snows. There are a lot of snowing equipment, so snowing is quite common.\n\nIn the episode where Marge is afraid to go out of the house (and latter gets all bulked up), she overcomes her fear by running out of the house and picking a lemon out of a tree.\n\nAnyone who has ever been to a place hot enough to grow lemons (Arizona, California) knows that there is no way that it would snow at all.\n\nTherefore, Sprinfield is obviously a mobile city (hey, it moved once, remember?)."
