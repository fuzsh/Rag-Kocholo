After 23 seasons and much guessing by fans, \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening has finally revealed the location of the show's town of Springfield, where his famous cartoon family resides.\n\nThe long-awaited answer? Springfield, Ore.\n\n\"The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show 'Father Knows Best' took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown,\" Groening explained to Smithsonian magazine.\n\nAs to why he's finally confirming the location after all this time? \"I don’t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it’s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, 'Yup, that’s right,' \" he further revealed.\n\nIt turns out that there have been hints as to Springfield's location since the beginning. Groening told the magazine that he named a number of characters after streets in Portland. Among them? Ned Flanders and Rev. Lovejoy. And the name of the street the \"Simpsons\" family lives on? It bears the same name as the street Groening's family lived on -- Evergreen Terrace.\n\nBut locations may not be all that the show's creator borrowed from his hometown and childhood. Groening told Smithsonian that as a kid, he was bullied. Though he wouldn't give up his tormentors' names, he noted, \"maybe they are characters named after themselves on 'The Simpsons.' \"\n\nEat his shorts, meanies.\n\nDid you pick up on the clues that Springfield was in Oregon? Does the reveal change how you might see the town on the show? Share your thoughts on our Facebook page!\n\nRelated content:"
