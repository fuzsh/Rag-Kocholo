        "text": "Netflix is looking to The Simpsons mastermind for its next animated series.\n\nThe Simpsons creator Matt Groening is prepping an animated show for the streaming service, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nDetails about the concept are being kept under wraps, but insiders say it could earn a two-season pickup for a total of 20 episodes (which would certainly help with the lead time required to produce an animated program).\n\nThe comedy would be Groening’s follow-up to Futurama and The Simpsons, the latter of which ranks as TV’s longest-running series with more than 500 episodes.\n\nThe news comes as Netflix continues to expand its roster of animated series. The streamer has BoJack Horseman, F Is for Family and Dr. Seuss entry Green Eggs and Ham.\n\nNetflix declined comment."
