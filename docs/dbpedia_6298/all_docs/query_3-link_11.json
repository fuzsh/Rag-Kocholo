        "text": "There is a beach so it has to be on the coast\n\nThe state it is in fought for the Union, so it has to be in the North\n\nSo either New England or the West Coast seems the most likely\n\nAnd since we know it was settled in the nineteenth century, by settlers looking for freedom (and one who wanted to marry his cousin in the next town over) it would have to be in an unincorporated part of the country, so the West Coast somewhere\n\nPretty sure Springfield and Shelbyville were both founded in the late 1700s, which opens up basically all of the midwest. Shelbyville also being the name of an actual town in Indiana while there's plenty of Springfield's in the Midwest gives it some credibility.\n\nAlthough this is all about feel and I dunno nothing about Springfield feels west coast to me, although when I think west coast I always think California, and exclude Oregon or WA which parts can definitely feel that the Springfield vibe\n\nPretty sure Springfield and Shelbyville were both founded in the late 1700s, which opens up basically all of the midwest. Shelbyville also being the name of an actual town in Indiana while there's plenty of Springfield's in the Midwest gives it some credibility.\n\nAlthough this is all about feel and I dunno nothing about Springfield feels west coast to me.\n\nI think in Lisa the Iconoclast Jedebiah Springfield says he didn't change his name until 1795 or something, so if it was founded in the 18th century it would have been the last five years or so\n\nHis coonskin hat makes me think it was probably around the time of the 1820s/1830s\n\nWe all know Springfield is not a real place, so I don't want to have an argument about semantics or city names or wizard's keys - but I'd love to know where people think the Simpsons takes place. I am talking deep down inside when you watch the Simpsons, either now or as a kid, where do you FEEL it is taking place?\n\nFor me, it absolutely has and always will be somewhere on the west coast of the United States. Giant evergreen trees, mountains, gorges, deserts, grizzly bears, bigfoot, towns founded by pioneers, radio stations that start with K - these all seemed so exotic to me as a kid growing up in the cookie cutter Maryland suburbs. I assumed Springfield was a generic town in California like from ET or countless other childrens movies. Once I learned Groening was from Portland it became even more obvious, and now having lived on the west coast for 15 years there's nothing that could change my mind. But would love to hear what other people's experiences were like.\n\nIt's loosely based off of Springfield Oregon, right next to Eugene.\n\nTo be fair, one of the examples cited above is from a Treehouse of Horror where rules hardly apply.\n\nBut there's plenty of evidence that Springfield borders an ocean.\n\nMost notably, The Squirt and the Whale had Lisa discovering a beached blue whale within biking distance of her house.\n\nView: https://streamable.com/6335lf\n\nKind of hard to do that in a midwestern state last I checked.\n\nThere was an episode where it was said Springfield is in state where George Bush Sr has lived. In his life, George Bush Sr has lived in Texas, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia, and Ohio.\n\nThere's a million instances of the show's writers contradicting themselves, which is why I asked the question of where it \"feels\", not where the clues point. Like to me, seeing Homer fall down that canyon in Season 2 when I was like 9 or 10 made Springfield feel thousands of miles away, since we didn't have anything like that on the east coast. You know what I mean?\n\nAnd anyway Bush Sr moved to Springfield because they had the lowest voter turnout in the country or something like that.\n\nIt's loosely based off of Springfield Oregon, right next to Eugene.\n\n\"Springfield\" reminds me more of Eugene, with actual Springfield being Shelbyville.\n\nYeah many such cases\n\nFor real, there's shown to be lighthouses, beach towns, oil spills, etc., all within a drive.\n\nI would've guessed Midwest until I moved to the PNW and realized Groening was from here, too. I can't *not* see the markers now.\n\nMy guess has always been that Springfield is in the Midwest/Great Lakes area (Illinois/Indiana/Ohio/Kentucky) but looks like a PNW town because that's what Groening knew from experience and didn't necessarily realize the differences.\n\nTo be fair, one of the examples cited above is from a Treehouse of Horror where rules hardly apply.\n\nBut there's plenty of evidence that Springfield borders an ocean.\n\nMost notably, The Squirt and the Whale had Lisa discovering a beached blue whale within biking distance of her house.\n\nView: https://streamable.com/6335lf\n\nKind of hard to do that in a midwestern state last I checked.\n\nHmm I guess it is unclear whether the location established in Treehouse of Horror isn't canon\n\nOne good argument for the East Coast; the New Kids on the Blecch or boy band episode.\n\nLieutenant L.T Smash commandeers the aircraft carrier anchored in Springfield Harbour for the Party Posse show, and sails it to New York to bomb MAD magazine.\n\nThis mostly takes place in the span of time Homer is in the bathroom during the concert, so if they were on the West Coast they'd have to go through the Panama Canal.\n\nThis would suggest Springfield is really close to New York by sea. Though apparently in Homer v New York City it takes a long time by bus, apparently overnight, though Bart mentions transferring through Atlanta twice which suggests the route they took wasn't efficient.\n\nView: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MRL1J25GOgU"
