        "text": "But what about Mayah Quimby’s accent?\n\nMike Reiss, a longtime writer for “The Simpsons,’’ broke the bad news Tuesday: The “Springfield’’ where the long-running show is set is not Springfield, Mass.\n\nReiss said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe’’ show that Springfield is basically in every state.\n\n“Nobody watches this show, right? So I can tell you. ’Cause it’s a closely guarded secret. We know in the writer’s room, the answer is, Springfield is in — Hawaii, ’’ he said, pausing a half-beat for (what else?) comic effect.\n\nThen Reiss fessed up. “It’s nowhere. . . . We chose the name because there are 48 Springfields in America in 43 states, which means five states had two Springfields.’’\n\nNoting a number of Massachusetts references in the show, some have said they think there’s a strong case to be made that Homer and his family live in Springfield, Mass.\n\nReiss has a book out, “Springfield Confidential: Jokes, Secrets, and Outright Lies from a Lifetime Writing for The Simpsons.’’ He said that in the early days of the show, no one had any idea it would become a success — and that gave the writers a kind of freedom.\n\n“We said no one’s going to see this, so let’s just fill it with the kind of stuff we want to see on TV. We’ll never get this chance again,’’ he said. The show is heading into its 30th season this fall.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPv-HVNTjGw"
