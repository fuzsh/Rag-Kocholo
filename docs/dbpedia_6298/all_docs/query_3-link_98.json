        "text": "#10: A Real “Family Guy”\n\n“The Wandering Juvie”\n\nWhen Bart is sent to juvenile hall in this episode, he escapes with a fellow inmate named Gina, someone he has a hard time getting along with. The two eventually get in a fight where Gina insults Bart by calling him a “family guy.” This “Simpsons” episode aired in early 2004, at a time when “Family Guy” was gaining popularity though DVD sales and reruns on Adult Swim. So Gina calling Bart a “Family Guy” was a nice nod to the series that was experiencing a tremendous comeback after having been cancelled.\n\n#9: Al “Family Guy” Jean\n\n“Treehouse of Horror XVI”\n\nDuring the end credits of “Treehouse of Horror XVI,” “Simpsons” showrunner Al Jean gave himself spooky credits with “Family Guy” as his nickname. It isn’t entirely clear how the “Family Guy” moniker is supposed to be interpreted, but it seems to have been meant ironically. In interviews, Jean has been critical of “Family Guy” and its cutaway gags, so the nickname doesn’t look like it’s an homage. When “Family Guy” had its crossover with “The Simpsons,” Jean took issue with a joke involving assault, and he openly discussed with “Simpsons” producer James L. Brooks whether they should ask “Family Guy” writers to have the joke cut.\n\n#8: Future Guy\n\n“Chief Wiggum’s Book of Crime and Punishment” (2010)\n\nThe Simpsons didn’t limit their references to “Family Guy” to their TV show. There’s also a dig at the animated sitcom in one of their books, “Chief Wiggum’s Book of Crime and Punishment.” One chapter of this book is dedicated to the evidence locker in Wiggum’s police department, and one of the items found there is a flatscreen TV playing “Future Guy.” This appears to be some show that has blended “Family Guy” and Matt Groening’s sci-fi classic, “Futurama” by fusing characters from one show with the other. One of these fusions is Peter and Dr. Zoidberg, and the other looks like Brian and Nibbler. All we know is this will be in our nightmares tonight.\n\n#7: TV’s Most Beloved Animation Visionary\n\n“The Simpsons Game” (2007)\n\nAnother “Simpsons” reference to “Family Guy” outside of the TV show can be found in this video game released in 2007. In one level, “Simpsons” creator Matt Groening appears as an exaggerated version of himself who encounters Bart and Homer. Groening is incensed when Homer confuses him with Seth MacFarlane, the creator of “Family Guy.” While Seth MacFarlane had two successful animated sitcoms on the air around the time of this video game’s release, no one would say he had a record with cartoons comparable to Matt Groening’s just yet.\n\n#6: Family Guy World\n\n“‘Tis the 30th Season”\n\nWhile the Simpson family is staying in Florida on vacation, a hotel manager tells Bart and Lisa that Disney World is building a Family Guy World park. It’s actually something that’s in the realm of possibility now that Disney owns 20th Century Studios. We then see construction of Family Guy World, where a photographer is taking pictures of people dressed in costumes of various “Family Guy” characters. Some of the attractions of the theme park include “Soarin’ over Quahog,” “Quagmires of the Carribean,” and “Dump on Meg.” Seth MacFarlane also sings Sinatra tunes. Not gonna lie … Family Guy World sounds kinda cool.\n\n#5: The Truth About “Family Guy”\n\n“Krusty the Clown”\n\nAt a meeting with the CEO of Google-Disney, Homer is filled in on a disturbing secret: that a bunch of shows we all thought were widely watched are actually fake. It’s part of an elaborate scheme to make it look like there’s more television content then there actually is. The CEO then shows a screen with a whole bunch of these fake shows, which includes “Family Guy,” in addition to other Seth MacFarlane shows such as “American Dad” and “The Orville.” But before you think that the “Simpsons” writers are just taking shots at Seth MacFarlane, look at the top line, and you’ll see “The Simpsons” is included as one of the fake shows too.\n\n#4: Couch Gag\n\n“Homerland”\n\nThis episode was the premiere of the 25th season of “The Simpsons, and to celebrate, there was a special couch gag. The Simpsons family was joined by various characters from the show, such as Mr. Burns , Ned Flanders, and Apu. Then the group got larger as they were joined by characters from other FOX shows, including the Griffins from “Family Guy.” However, Homer was turned away by the bouncer, even though it was his house where this event was taking place. The couch gag also included Cleveland’s family, although they were on the “The Cleveland Show” at the time.\n\n#3: PBS Pledge\n\n“Missionary: Impossible”\n\nIn an attempt to help out the struggling network, Betty White hosts a PBS-style pledge drive for FOX. To urge viewers to give money, she brings up the “crude, low-brow” content the channel has to offer. As she says this, “Family Guy” is shown on the television, suggesting that the show matches that description. Years later, Betty White would appear on “Family Guy” in the episode “Peterotica” where she provided narration for an audiobook written by Peter Griffin. And, fittingly, she was “crude” and “low-brow” for that appearance.\n\n#2: Homer Clones\n\n“Treehouse of Horror XIII”\n\nIn this Halloween segment, Homer has a magic hammock that can make clones of himself. Through his carelessness, Homer’s clones get a hold of the hammock and make clones of their own. As the scene pans out to the clones that are thus produced, Peter Griffin is shown as one of the clones. This implies that Peter is a lazy ripoff of Homer, a common knock on the Griffin patriarch. Sure, both are dim-witted, selfish oafs, who love beer, wear white shirts, and are married with three kids, but ...OK, no, we do see where that’s coming from ...\n\n#1: The Crimes of “Family Guy”\n\n“The Italian Bob”\n\nTo identify high profile criminals, an Italian police officer keeps a book that contains pictures of infamous criminals along with the crimes they committed. Among the criminals included in the book are Snake for “invasione di casa” and Mayor Quimby for “drinko drive-o.” Peter Griffin is also listed for the crime of “plagiarismo,” another example of the writers calling out Peter for being a copycat. Then Seth MacFarlane creation Stan Smith is shown as having committed “plagiarismo di plagiarismo,” making the accusation that MacFarlane even ripped himself off."
