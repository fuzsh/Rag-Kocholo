        "text": "On August 17th, Netflix brings us the next animated series from the great Matt Groening, creator of both “The Simpsons” and “Futurama”.\n\nIn “Disenchantment”, viewers will be whisked away to the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland, where they will follow the misadventures of hard-drinking young princess Bean, her feisty elf companion Elfo, and her personal demon Luci.\n\nThe show seems like a natural evolution to Groening’s series, with “The Simpsons” taking place during modern times, while “Futurama”, well, envisions an insane future. The latter two seemingly exist in the same universe (it’s up for debate), but what if “Disenchantment” actually bridges the two together?!\n\nAn eagle-eyed reddit user caught something interesting in the pilot episode of “Futurama”. After a pizza delivery-gone-wrong, Fry finds himself cryogenically frozen for 1,000 years. The viewer watches the years fly by as civilization is destroyed and rebuilt several times over. Along the way, after aliens destroy the planet, it’s rebuilt, bringing upon a second medieval age (only to be destroyed by aliens once again). Could this be when “Disenchantment” takes place?\n\nAll I know is that the series features a maniacal demon that possesses and torments people around it…\n\n“It’s like a hole opened up in the world… to the center of nothingness.” From Executive Producer Ryan Murphy (“American Horror Story”) comes the brand new FX horror series “Grotesquerie,” and FX has released the first official teaser trailer this morning.\n\n“Grotesquerie” will premiere September 25 on FX, arriving next day on Hulu.\n\nWatch the teaser trailer for Ryan Murphy’s “Grotesquerie” below.\n\nNiecy Nash-Betts (“Dahmer”) stars in the upcoming horror series alongside Courtney B. Vance (“Lovecraft Country”) and Oscar nominee Lesley Manville (Phantom Thread). Micaela Diamond, Nicholas Alexander Chavez, Raven Goodwin, and Travis Kelce also star.\n\nIn Ryan Murphy’s 10-episode drama series for FX, a series of heinous crimes have unsettled a small community. “Detective Lois Tryon” feels these crimes are eerily personal, as if someone—or something—is taunting her. At home, Lois grapples with a strained relationship with her daughter, a husband in long-term hospital care and her own inner demons.\n\nWith no leads and unsure of where to turn, she accepts the help of “Sister Megan,” a nun and journalist with the Catholic Guardian. Sister Megan, with her own difficult past, has seen the worst of humanity, yet she still believes in its capacity for good. Lois, on the other hand, fears the world is succumbing to evil. As Lois and Sister Megan string together clues, they find themselves ensnared in a sinister web that only seems to raise more questions than answers.\n\nWritten and created by Ryan Murphy, Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, “Grotesquerie” is directed by Max Winkler, Murphy, Alexis Martin Woodall and Elegance Bratton. The show is executive produced by Murphy, Woodall, Baitz, Baken, Winkler, Nash-Betts, Vance, Peter Liguori, Nissa Diederich, Eric Kovtun and Scott Robertson. It is produced by 20th Television."
