        "text": "The Simpsons have been a fixture in our living rooms for so long, they're practically part of the family. This animated sitcom has outlasted countless real-world events, pop culture phenomena, and even some of the celebrities they've parodied. We're talking about a show that's been around longer than the internet as we know it!\n\nBut The Simpsons' journey to becoming the longest-running animated series and scripted primetime show in TV history had humble beginnings. Creator Matt Groening, a cartoonist known for his \"Life in Hell\" comic strip, was waiting to pitch ideas to producer James L. Brooks. In a last-minute panic about potentially losing the rights to his beloved characters, Groening hastily sketched out a dysfunctional family based on his own (minus the blue hair and overbites).\n\nThose crude drawings evolved into the characters we know and love: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. From short segments on The Tracey Ullman Show to their own primetime slot, the Simpson family's rise to stardom was as unexpected as one of Homer's harebrained schemes actually working out.\n\nOver the years, The Simpsons has not only entertained us but also enriched our vocabulary. Who would have thought that words like \"embiggen\" and \"cromulent\" would find their way into actual dictionaries? The show's linguistic creativity is just one reason it's racked up an impressive 35 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and even a Peabody Award. Not bad for a cartoon family from Springfield!\n\nSpeaking of which, have you noticed how the look of Springfield and its inhabitants has changed since the early days? The animation has come a long way from the rough, sketchy style of the first season. The characters are more polished now, the colors more vibrant, and the backgrounds more detailed. But don't worry, Marge's hair is still blue and as tall as ever.\n\nBut let's get back to basics. We know The Simpsons have been around forever, but can you pinpoint exactly when this cultural juggernaut first hit the airwaves as its own show? When did viewers first tune in to watch the antics of Springfield's most infamous family in a full-length episode?\n\nClick START below to answer."
