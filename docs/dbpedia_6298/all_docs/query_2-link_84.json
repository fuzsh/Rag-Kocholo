        "text": "The Simpsons is a classic television show which has created some of the most beloved characters of all time. While it might be a cartoon show, the writers have done an amazing job in building these characters as people that everyone can relate to. One way the show has done that is by having the characters have totally different ranges of compassion, humor, and intelligence.\n\nSome of the characters on the show are incredibly clever, seemingly having an answer for everything, yet others aren’t quite as bright. While those characters shine through in a different way, having these differing intelligence levels has allowed the show to be more varied. Within this list we will be taking a look at some of the main characters, ranking from by their intelligence.\n\nOut of all the main characters there is no doubt about who the least intelligent person is. While he might be the most popular character to come from the show, Homer Simpson certainly isn’t the brightest. He’s incredibly clumsy, lazy, and lacks in common sense at times, but those characteristics all help make him as loveable as he is.\n\nHomer does have a few random moments of incredible intelligence, and when that happens it is normally a big surprise that leads to a comedic pay-off. His bright moments might be fleeting, with more “Doh’s” than anything else, but he is still a fantastic character.\n\nBarney Gumble has got his dear friend Homer Simpson to thank for ranking so low on this list because if it wasn’t for him his life would have been very different. In his youth, Barney was incredibly intelligent and was actually set to attend Harvard University.\n\nRELATED: The Simpsons: 10 Big Mistakes That Homer Committed That We Can Learn From\n\nHowever, the day before his SATs, Homer introduced him to beer. From that point on, things take quite the slide for the loveable Barney, who spends the majority of his time drunk. The constant drinking sadly does affect his intelligence, which sees him rank far lower than he might have done if things had worked out differently.\n\nUnfortunately for Bart Simpson, he takes after his father in many ways and one of those is that he’s not exactly the smartest of people. Intelligence just doesn’t come naturally for him and because of that, he resorts to humor as a coping mechanism, using pranks to entertain.\n\nWhile many might look at the pranks Bart does as borderline bullying at times (which is true in some instances), it is also a sign of intelligence. Bart has to put a lot of effort into some of them, and while he might not score great grades in school, his brains are used differently.\n\nApu\n\nApu is another character we see fairly regularly on The Simpsons, and even though he doesn’t always get to show his intelligence too often, it is clear that he is quite smart. Anyone who is able to run their own business is clearly a smart person, as it’s not something you can just do with ease.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe Simpsons: 10 Best Apu Episodes To Rewatch Now That Hank Azara Is Retiring The Character\n\nWhile he might often change the dates and prices to suit himself best, that also is a sign of intelligence as he knows how to keep his business thriving at all times. He’s a kind-natured character and is someone who fans have come to love, but not specifically for his brains.\n\nMarge Simpson\n\nThe Simpsons Marge Simpson\n\nMarge Simpson has a tough job, keeping her family together as much as possible, despite how absolutely crazy the Simpson family can be. However, she does a great job of that and that is mainly down to her intelligence, as Marge is a fairly smart character.\n\nShe might not be as smart as other people on the show who work in high-end jobs, but she certainly is intelligent. Marge knows how to fix human issues by talking to people, especially those within her family, which takes a lot of intelligence to be able to do.\n\nSideshow Mel\n\nSideshow Mel might not always get to showcase his intelligence as much as other characters on the show, but when he does talk it’s clear he’s very smart. Mel always comes across as a very well-educated and intelligent person who is very cultured.\n\nHe might not dress that way, but he certainly is one of the smarter people in Springfield. Sideshow Mel deserves a little more credit than he gets when it comes to the brains department, that’s for sure."
