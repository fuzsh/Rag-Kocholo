From Donald Trump's 2016 election victory to the shocking twist at the end of Game of Thrones, it seems that the show has a knack for predicting the future – however, it definitely didn’t see @demonflyingfox’s new video coming.\n\nSign up for our free indy100 weekly newsletter\n\nHow to join the indy100's free WhatsApp channel"
