Springfield, Oregon, is the city that the Springfield of the beloved cartoon “The Simpsons” was modeled after, according to the show’s creator Matt Groening. In case you’ve missed it over the past 33 years and 34 seasons, “The Simpsons” follows a charming and often hilarious yellow animated family in their hometown of Springfield."
