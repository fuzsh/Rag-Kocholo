        "text": "y\n\nThe Simpsons family sprang into life on 19 Apr 1987, when Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie debuted in a series of animated “bumpers” on The Tracey Ullman Show – a sketch show fronted by the British singer and comedienne on the US Fox network and produced by James L Brooks of Gracie Films. The 60-second shorts – aired on either side of commercial breaks – were devised and drawn by the comic artist Matt Groening, best known at the time for his Life Is Hell comic strips.\n\nGroening wanted to create a new cast of characters for these short segments so he conjured up a typical American family inspired by his own. He quickly drew the Simpsons – almost as we know them today – expecting the TV execs to have his hastily drawn sketches polished and smoothed out; instead, they were animated just as he’d drawn them, giving the early Simpsons featurettes a rough, shaky quality that may well have added to their quirky appeal.\n\nThe haul of trophies comprises:\n\nâ 11 for Outstanding Animated Program (one hour or less): 1990, 1991, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2019.\n\nâ 16 for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance: 1992 (six), 1993, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015\n\nâ Two for Outstanding Music and Lyrics: 1997, 1998\n\nâ Five for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation: 2010, 2013, 2014 (two) and 2018\n\nThe Simpsons also holds the record for the most People's Choice Awards by an animated series, picking up eight trophies in 1991, 2007–09, 2011 and 2015–17.\n\nAs well as winning awards, the show has also earned itself a raft of celebrity fans along its 31-year life, securing the record for the most guest stars featured in an animated series. As of 22 Apr 2020, at least 810 famous names have made cameo appearances. The first celebrity named as a guest was the late US actress Marcia Wallace – who played Springfield Elementary school teacher Edna Krabappel – and the first to appear as himself was American crooner Tony Bennett.\n\ny\n\nâ The longest uninterrupted broadcast of a TV franchise is 300 hr, achieved by FXX (USA), who broadcast 600 episodes of The Simpsons across the USA between 24 Nov and 6 Dec 2016.\n\nâ In 2012, Carin Shreeves and Jeremiah Franco (both USA) broke the record for the longest marathon watching television with an epic 86-hr 37-min viewing of The Simpsons from Episode One; the four-day \"Simpsonsathon\" earned the two men a GWR certificate plus $10,000 prize money presented by Fox Home Entertainment.\n\nThe most tattoos of characters from a single animated series is 203 different characters from The Simpsons, achieved by super-fan Michael Baxter (AUS), as verified in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, Australia, on 3 Dec 2014.\n\n\"The Duff Book of Records\"\n\nWorld records set in the fictional universe of The Simpsons are documented in The Duff Book of Records – a publication created by Duff Beer in order to settle pub arguments. Sound familiar?! The book also has a spin-off TV series of the same name, hosted by Johnny Herelately.\n\nRecords featured in the book and TV show include \"most lima beans shoved up the nose\" (183, attempted by Ralph Wiggum), the \"most people bouncing paddle balls\" (attempted by everyone in Springfield), \"most trampoline bounces\" (by Homer), \"fattest town\" (Springfield), \"best book you have ever seen\" (Tom Clancy's Op-Center) and \"most clothespins clipped to face and neck\" (116). Duff also organizes the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge.\n\nFUN FACT: Bart Simpson was the only fictional character in TIME magazine's list of the “100 Most Important People of the 20th Century”, alongside the likes of Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi and The Beatles!\n\nQ&A with Matt Groening\n\nAs part of the 50th anniversary edition of Guinness World Records, we spoke to The Simpsons’ co-creator Matt Groening about this much-loved TV phenomenon. We started by congratulating him on the show’s record-breaking success.\n\nMG: Thank you! It really is an unexpected thrill. I don’t care about awards but to be in the Guinness World Records book is really great. It’s something I’d never expected, and I’m glad it’s a record to be proud of. There are certain records you don’t want to have… I’m glad I’ve not been sitting in baked beans!\n\nGWR: The show also has a record for its many guest stars. Why are celebrities so keen to appear?\n\nMG: Firstly, it’s the easiest gig in showbusiness! You can show up in curlers and barefoot, speak into the microphone and be on your merry way. You can literally phone it in – we’ve done phone hook-ups with some big stars. But it’s more fun when we convince the stars to come in. When Mick Jagger was at the FOX studios, people on the show were very excited. That’s why we do it – to entertain ourselves! We’ve had Michael Jackson as a 300-lb white guy who thought he was Michael Jackson; we’ve had Elizabeth Taylor doing the voice of Maggie; Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr [from The Beatles]. But of all the people, I think The Simpsons' writing team was most excited to have Adam West, the original TV Batman!\n\nGWR: What advice do you have for kids who want to work in TV?\n\nMG: My advice to kids who want to work in TV is don’t spend all your time watching TV! One of the things about working in TV is that it’s like a voracious beast… you need to keep filling it with content. So cram your brain full of culture, history, science and politics, and you’ll do very well in TV.\n\nGWR: Do you have a favourite episode?\n\nMG: Ah, I like a lot of the very early episodes, particularly ones with Lisa. When Lisa first meets Bleeding Gums Murphy, her saxophone mentor, I was amazed that the show could actually be moving, given how garish the characters were drawn.\n\nGWR: Bart and co. have been on our screens since 1987, will they continue to be part of the pop-culture landscape 20 years from now?\n\nMG: Aaah, I hope so! I don’t see any end in sight. It doesn’t get easier to come up with new stories, but we continue to surprise ourselves. And that’s basically our goal – to keep things surprising. It gets harder as the decades toll by. Everybody who likes the show compares the latest episode to their favourite, and it’s hard to measure up to the past sometimes. But we’re trying!"
