        "text": "*All reviews contain spoilers*\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit. Any material, including images and/or video footage, is property of their respective companies, unless stated otherwise. The author claims no ownership of this material. The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the author and are not to be viewed as factual documentation.\n\nThis week, we’re taking it back twelve years to 2007, where we find The Simpsons Movie. One of a long line of films based on popular animated TV shows, this one was based on the hit Fox show The Simpsons (department of redundancy department, I know) and was directed by a veteran director from the show, David Silverman. It’s a real golden oldie that’s been in production longer than just about any other animated show – longer than Family Guy or SpongeBob (both from 1999), longer than South Park (1997) or Arthur (1996)… as far as I know, the only older animated show anywhere in the world is Japan’s Sazae-san, which has been going since as far back as 1969. Currently in its thirtieth season, The Simpsons is also heading for its thirtieth anniversary this December, a milestone that very few animated shows ever see – and that’s not counting its earlier incarnation as a segment on The Tracey Ullman Show between 1987 and 1989.\n\nThe idea of creating a Simpsons feature film was floating around from the very beginning, when creator Matt Groening dreamed of making one once the show had ended – but of course, that plan was “undone by good ratings”. Around the fourth season, in the early nineties, Groening then considered a parody of the Disney classic Fantasia, but that proved too difficult to write. Next came an idea from regular cast member Phil Hartman, who wanted to create a live-action project revolving around one of his characters, Troy McClure. This garnered a lot of support among the writers in the mid-nineties, but when Hartman was tragically murdered in 1998, the project fell apart.\n\nFinally, in 2001, the team began serious development of the project that would become the fully-fledged Simpsons Movie. Producers Groening, James L. Brooks, Al Jean, Richard Sakai and Mike Scully put together a writing team which included themselves and many other early-season veterans, such as Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. At various times, former writer Conan O’Brien and even the great Brad Bird considered joining the team, but the latter had his hands full directing Ratatouille over at Pixar.\n\nThe writing team came up with endless ideas, with many of the unused ones going on to become episodes on the show, or incorporated into video games; in the end, one of Groening’s was chosen for the film. His environmental theme about a town dealing with the effects of dumping pig faeces into its water supply was, somewhat surprisingly, drawn from a real-life story he read.\n\nTo direct, David Silverman was chosen – he’d already had a wealth of experience at both DreamWorks and Pixar, working on films like The Road to El Dorado (2000) and Monsters, Inc. (2001), but the main selling point was his familiarity with the show itself. He’d directed over twenty episodes of it himself by that time, including the 1989 debut episode Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire. Clearly, the film was going to be in good hands.\n\nWith the basic plot decided upon, the writing team then split it up into seven separate sections to continue working on it, refining every last joke and gag to ensure they had the best possible material. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin and Meyer each contributed twenty-five pages, which were later merged into one “very rough draft” about a month later. Just like any ordinary episode, the film’s script was written at informal meetings in which the writers gathered around a table and pitched ideas, trying to make each other laugh – in the end, it went through over a hundred revisions, even becoming a musical at one point (an idea that was discarded as the songs gradually grew shorter and shorter).\n\nThe many revisions led to plenty of cuts, with enough completed material cut from the final film to make two more films. Among the numerous cuts were several celebrity cameos by the likes of Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Kelsey Grammer and Edward Norton. Thankfully, Tom Hanks and the members of Green Day managed to remain; Hanks had been convinced to join the production after just one phone call, while the band had actively requested to be a part of it.\n\nThe rest of the cast features all the show regulars; Dan Castellaneta is Homer, Julie Kavner is Marge, Nancy Cartwright is Bart (as well as the near-silent Maggie in an uncredited role), and Yeardley Smith is Lisa. Cartwright, Kavner and Castellaneta had plenty of other roles, too, as is common in animated television; the latter is credited with nine more roles including Homer’s father, Abe, who has an important scene near the beginning. And that’s not even getting into his numerous uncredited bit-parts, either!\n\nHank Azaria and Harry Shearer lead the supporting cast with a staggering twenty credited roles between them, ten apiece – these include Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum and the infamous Apu Nahasapeemapetilon for Azaria, and Mr. Burns, Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Lenny, President Arnold Schwarzenegger, Seymour Skinner and Kent Brockman for Shearer. We also have Pamela Hayden as Milhouse Van Houten (and others), Tress MacNeille as the Medicine Woman (and others, such as Colin), and Albert Brooks (hey, it’s Marlin) as main antagonist Russ Cargill. Of course, with ninety-eight speaking parts in the film, there are far, far too many to list them all here!\n\nThe cast began table readings together in May of 2005, recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production. James L. Brooks directed these sessions, his first time directing the actors since the show’s earliest seasons – must have felt strange to be back after so long. Castellaneta considered the sessions to be “more intense” than the ones for the show, as well as being “more emotionally dramatic”. Some scenes, like the one of Marge’s video message, had to be done over a hundred times – incredible as it sounds – which of course left the cast exhausted.\n\nThe actual animation was begun early in 2006 and continued well into 2007, with the team continuing to make changes after test screenings as late as that March. Groening had rejected any notion of making the film in live-action or computer animation early on, describing the film’s animation as “deliberately imperfect” and “a tribute to the art of hand-drawn animation”. (Bravo, Mr. Groening, bravo!) The animators mainly used Wacom Cintiq tablets, allowing them to draw directly onto computer monitors, but the work was divided between four studios: Film Roman and Rough Draft Studios in California, and AKOM and Rough Draft’s division in South Korea. Most of the work was completed stateside – storyboarding, character work, backgrounds and animatics – with the overseas studios doing the inbetweening, digital ink and paint and rendering before sending the footage back to America.\n\nThe film had quite the grand lineage, with Silverman and the animators drawing inspiration from films like The Incredibles (2004), The Triplets of Belleville (2003) and Bad Day at Black Rock (1955); they were considered a “great education in staging because of how the characters are placed”. For the “Disney Acid Sequence,” they looked to actual Disney films like Dumbo (1941) and Pluto’s Judgment Day (1935), while the crowd scenes were based on It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). Silverman also reflected on some of his own episodes from the show, particularly favourites such as Homie the Clown (1995) and Three Men a Comic Book (1991). He directed Mike B. Anderson, Lauren MacMullan, Rich Moore and Steven Dean Moore, each of whom in turn directed roughly a quarter of the animation while supervising numerous others on individual scenes.\n\nThen, there was the music to consider. It needed to be more cinematic than the standard episode score, so regular series composer Alf Clausen was not selected for the film – as he put it, “sometimes you’re the windshield, sometimes you’re the bug.” (I like his attitude). Instead, producer James L. Brooks brought in the legendary Hans Zimmer, who was a good friend and regular collaborator of his.\n\nZimmer considered writing the score for The Simpsons Movie a “unique challenge” and felt he had to “try and express the style of The Simpsons without wearing the audience out”. He incorporated Danny Elfman’s signature opening theme but was also careful not to overuse it, creating new themes for each member of the family. Naturally, Homer’s leitmotif was the focus, but he also dedicated a lot of attention to Bart’s and Marge’s. The “Spider-Pig” song was turned into a full choral piece, originally a joke he never intended to include in the film; once the foreign-language dubs began to be created, Zimmer had to re-write the song in thirty-two different languages (apparently Spanish was the hardest one to translate it into). Impressively, the same choir also performed the song in each of those dubs.\n\nNow, I must be honest here – I’m coming into this one as someone who only saw a couple of episodes of the show. To be clear: I am not a hardcore Simpsons fan. You might think this disqualifies me from talking about this film (and you’re right, to some extent) but there is a reason for my disinterest. You see, as a kid, I had a friend who was absolutely obsessed with the show and would talk about little else; I got so sick of hearing each episode described in painstaking detail that I never really bothered to give it a chance, preferring my favourites from Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network.\n\nOn top of that, the show had already been around for nearly a decade by the time I was starting to pay attention to TV (even Rugrats wasn’t quite that old), so it wasn’t like it was some new hit with a premiere that I could get excited about. It simply passed me by, and that’s the reason I didn’t see this film in theatres back in 2007. However, as an animation fan, I couldn’t continue to ignore it all these years later; it enjoys an unusually strong reputation for a film based on a TV show, so I was curious to find out what the fuss was all about.\n\nFor what it was, I had quite a good time with this one, even if it didn’t necessarily blow me away. It has an “organic” feeling to it, like it’s an extended episode of the show – it’s simple, but somehow feels “big” at the same time. I think the key is that it keeps all the characters true to themselves and just ups the stakes of the adventure they’re caught up in; Homer is still the ignorant, insensitive but well-meaning doofus, Marge is more grounded and realistic but isn’t immune to the craziness around her, Lisa is preachy and logical but can also act like any other kid (crushing on boys, smacking her brother in the face etc.), Maggie is secretly smarter than anyone realises and Bart is the rebel acting out because he’s frustrated by his home life.\n\nIt’s nice to see how much development the titular family go through over the course of the film, particularly Homer, Marge and Bart, whose relationships with one another are put under a lot of strain thanks to Homer’s negligence. Watching the film, I gained an idea of why the show has remained so popular; underneath all its slapstick and silliness, the characters are caricatures of real people, with flaws and problems that are easy to relate to. Marge’s marital struggle with Homer was a particularly strong aspect which was handled with real maturity, showing us why she sticks with him despite the obviously uneven nature of their relationship – she knows that he loves her and that he does mean well, even if his stupidity often leads them into disaster.\n\nAs you’d expect, there are plenty of great gags to be found here, something that long-time fans of the show praised as they felt it marked a return to form following several seasons of stagnation. I especially liked the moment where the patrons of a bar and a church switch places during a crisis, perfectly capturing the essence of fickle human nature. Then there’s that line from bad guy Russ Cargill; “You ever tried going mad without power? It’s boring; nobody listens to you!” It felt like a smart comment on the state of modern politics, even more pertinent to today’s America than to the one under the Bush administration. Of course, being me, I also couldn’t get enough of that golden gag at the cabin in Alaska, where Homer and Marge are “assisted” in their love-making by an assortment of Disney-knockoff woodland critters – who are promptly horrified to witness the pair’s antics in bed. It reminded me of a similarly funny moment from the 2009 Family Guy episode Road to the Multiverse (although the cheap jab from Bart about Disney being an “evil corporation” felt a bit stale).\n\nWhat surprised me, though, was that the film actually had something to say about important topics like environmentalism, politics and religion, beyond the laughs. It was more than you might expect from a film based on an animated TV show, but then it’s not the first time such a film has surprised us – remember how dramatic films like Rugrats in Paris or The Wild Thornberrys Movie turned out to be? In addition to the semi-serious commentary on these themes, the film also features genuinely serious moments that catch you off-guard and hit you all the harder because of it, just like the show itself is known for.\n\nMarge’s video message to Homer after he’s refused to try and fix the Springfield mess he’s caused is particularly moving in its gravity – again, I’m not even a regular viewer, but I knew enough to recognise the significance of this moment… how hard it must have been for Marge to do, and how hard it is for Homer to hear. Moments like that are what give the show meaning – all the great animated classics have them – and I’m glad they chose to include one in the film, emphasising the high stakes.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox was anticipating the film long before it came out, even registering the internet domain SIMPSONSMOVIE.COM in 1997, four years before the actual film had entered production. When the time for its release finally rolled around, they held a competition among sixteen Springfields across the USA (there are over thirty of them, at least) to decide which one would get the honour of hosting the premiere, a nod to the Simpsons’ canonical hometown of a generic American Springfield. Each Springfield put together a film explaining why they felt they should be chosen, with the results being decided by vote on the USA Today website. After Springfield, Minnesota dropped out in May, the winner ended up being Springfield, Vermont, beating out Springfield, Illinois by over seven hundred votes. The remaining fourteen Springfields each held their own smaller screenings of the film on July 26th, with the Vermont premiere occurring on July 21st and featuring a yellow carpet in place of the traditional red – an honour enjoyed by other yellow-themed animated films like The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004) and Minions (2015). (Fun fact: The Simpsons Movie was actually banned in Myanmar due to the excessive use of the colours red and yellow, which is prohibited in that country).\n\nFox pulled out all the stops to promote the film in the run-up to its release. They began with marketing deals with Burger King and 7-Eleven, the latter of which turned eleven of its stores into Kwik-E-Marts that sold film-related merchandise; some saw a thirty percent increase in profits during their time in “disguise”. In the town of Springfield, Canterbury, New Zealand (seriously, another one?) Fox erected a giant pink doughnut to celebrate the town’s name, although it was torched by an arsonist in 2009 (and then replaced with a concrete version in 2012). In London, England, a gigantic parade balloon in the shape of “Spider Pig” was flown above the Battersea Power Station, while in Dorset, an image of Homer was painted next to the hill figure of the Cerne Abbas Giant – local neopagans were outraged and performed “rain magic” to try and get the image washed off. Even the DVD release enjoyed unusually pervasive promotion, with the Empire State Building being illuminated in yellow upon its release, the first time the building had ever been used in such a way.\n\nApparently, all this pushing paid off, as the film became a monster hit beyond anyone’s expectations. Although it did come in for its fair share of criticism, with some feeling the shift to the big screen didn’t suit the show’s style, it was generally seen as a major success both critically and commercially, remaining the second-highest-grossing traditionally-animated film to this day behind only The Lion King (1994). It won a string of awards and was also nominated for four Annies, but it ended up losing all four to Ratatouille (understandable, that is a terrific film). The idea of a sequel has been kicking around since at least 2014, but as of last year, it is now officially in development.\n\nSo, are you a major Simpsons buff? Did you see this film when it came out back in 2007? What did you think? As for me, I liked it just fine, but I know there are a wealth of details and cameos that I would have appreciated more had I watched it as a fan. The story was interesting, if a little convoluted, but what I really liked was watching the evolving relationship between the family members themselves – it didn’t need any fancy bells and whistles, their unique personalities were enough to keep me invested in their fates. I also enjoyed the lively colour palette and restrained use of computer effects, as well as many of the cleverer gags and Hans Zimmer’s excellent score. Personally, I’d recommend this even to non-Simpsons fans, although you will undoubtedly get more out of it if you take the time to brush up on the show first.\n\nThank you so much for reading, and I hope you’ve enjoyed this trip back to the mid-2000s. It’s taught me that the period wasn’t such an arid gulch for animation as I thought! Next time, we’ll be hopping forwards a bit in time to 2011, where we’ll be taking a look at the one and only animated film by that master of cinema, Steven Spielberg. After that, it’s off to Japan for some more anime, so I hope you’ll be back soon for that. Until then, take care and stay animated!\n\n… Oh, and despite the Disney merger, no, Marge is not a Disney princess!"
