        "text": "From its modest beginnings as a series of brief vignettes on the innovative Tracy Ullman Show to its establishment as the longest-running prime-time animated cartoon series on television, The Simpsons transformed the way both audiences and television programmers view the animated sitcom. In his earlier work, the irreverent comic strip “Life In Hell,” Simpsons creator Matt Groening displayed the subversive comic sensibility that would become the series’ trademark. Yet he added to the show’s appeal by refusing to let The Simpsons be consumed by cynicism. Amid the edgy humor and biting social and political satire, the dysfunctional yet honorable Simpson clan—Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie (all named after Groening’s own family members), and the incorrigible Bart (an anagram of “brat”)—each week delivered messages about family and society.\n\nTeamed with respected producer James L. Brooks, Groening launched The Simpsons as a weekly series in 1990. An immediate success, the show quickly claimed a spot in popular culture, with respected actors vying for guest spots alongside series regulars Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, and Yeardley Smith. By its ninth season, the critically acclaimed series had received numerous honors, including a Peabody award and 10 Emmy awards. In addition, the success of The Simpsons gave rise to a renaissance in prime-time animation, with many series, including King of the Hill, Dilbert, and Groening’s own Futurama, targeting an intelligent, adult audience with savvy, social humor. By using animation, producers such as Groening pushed the sitcom in directions often deemed too risky for live-action programming."
