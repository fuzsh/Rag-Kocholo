        "text": "South Park centers on four 8-year-old boys who live in a fictional Colorado town. You might think a show about little kids would be wholesome, but that's the exact opposite of South Park's vibe. In fact, it's probably the edgiest show on this list. In one episode, the kids could be trying to send a whale to the moon, while in another they might be making fun of Cartman's mom's sex life.\n\nThe show has been criticized for its willingness to mock literally everything - but that's also exactly why it's so popular.\n\nNumber of Episodes: 327+\n\nHave you ever wondered what life would be like 1,000 years in the future? One answer can be found in Futurama, a comedy series created by Matt Groening of The Simpsons fame. Philip J. Fry, a slacker from the modern day, gets cryogenically frozen for 1,000 years and has to adjust to a totally changed world. He ends up taking a job for the delivery company Planet Express, where he meets a range of quirky characters. The whole thing is a hilarious workplace sitcom with a sci-fi twist.\n\nAside from being fun and zany, Futurama was written by some highly educated people - the staff held a total of three Ph.D.s and seven master's degrees, and had spent a total of 50 years at Harvard between them. This allowed them to create some genuinely clever science-based gags, and to include small but complex details, like consistent alien languages.\n\nNumber of Episodes: 150+\n\nWhen most people think about animated sitcoms, The Simpsons is likely one of the first that pops to mind. And no wonder - it's been going strong since 1989. During that time, the series has received a staggering 35 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and two Peabody Awards. It's also had a major influence on all facets of pop culture.\n\nSo, what's this powerful show even about? To put it simply, it's about the everyday life of a suburban family: lovable oaf husband/father Homer, long-suffering wife/mother Marge, bad-boy Bart, principled and intelligent Lisa, and baby Maggie. Some of their adventures are ordinary ones, but others are totally absurd, ranging from problems with school and church to getting abducted by aliens or inducted into cults.\n\nNumber of Episodes: 761+\n\nKing of the Hill, created by Mike Judge and Greg Daniels, is a family sitcom based in the fictional town of Arlen, TX. Hank Hill is a propane salesman, while his wife Peggy is a substitute teacher. He also has a 12-year-old son named Bobby and a young adult niece named Luanne.\n\nWhile the comedy is usually on point, what really stands out is the show's sense of place. Judge based the setting and characters on the experiences he had living in the suburbs of Texas; this might be why it feels so genuine. From the conservative politics of the characters to the layout of the land, it evokes the nuances of that part of the US. Whether you're a native Texan who sees yourself in the show or you've never been to Texas in your life, King of the Hill will still feel real.\n\nNumber of Episodes: 259+\n\nPeople love Rick and Morty so much that when McDonalds offered a new dip for its Chicken McNuggets called Szechuan sauce (a product referenced in the show), fans practically rioted when they couldn't get ahold of it. While they shouldn't be harassing McDonalds employees, it's no surprise that they love the show.\n\nRick and Morty follows the adventures of Rick Sanchez - a mad scientist constantly traversing other dimensions - and his reluctant grandson Morty. If you're a sci-fi fan, there's plenty of spectacle to see. But underneath the flashier bits, the show delves into real philosophical concepts involving humanity's place in the universe. It's a smart show with a lot to say, but one can still enjoy it without dissecting the deeper stuff.\n\nNumber of Episodes: 71+\n\nIf your favorite part of American Dad was the secret service plot lines, then you might want to check out Archer, a workplace sitcom that parodies older spy media and takes place in a dysfunctional secret service agency in an anachronistic Cold War-like setting.\n\nBecause that could get stale after multiple seasons - and because the spy organization's name, ISIS, had some unwanted associations - several seasons tell self-contained stories unrelated to the spy plot line. This keeps things fresh.\n\nAnother noteworthy element is the art style. Archer uses thick lines similar to the work of comic artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, while also bringing in a Mad Men-esque aesthetic.\n\nNumber of Episodes: 145"
