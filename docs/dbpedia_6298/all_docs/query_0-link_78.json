        "text": "According to Variety, Netflix has given a 20-episode pickup to Matt Groening’s new animated comedy, Disenchantment.\n\nDisenchantment follows a hard-drinking princess known as “Bean,” as she navigates a world of twisted fairy tale tropes. The first 10 episodes are scheduled to be released next year.\n\nNetflix has been churning out original content to an extraordinary degree over the last couple of years, and Disenchantment is all but certain to be a hit. After all, Groening is creator of The Simpsons, one of the greatest television cartoons of all time, if not the greatest. He followed that up with Futurama, which wasn’t anywhere near as popular as The Simpsons, but slowly built up a dedicated cult following over the years.\n\nIndeed, there was somewhat of an outcry when Netflix removed Futurama from its library, as apparently there is a large amount of people out there who regularly fall asleep in front of Futurama, and they all gather online to talk about it. (Give the link a click, it’s one of the wonderful oddities of the internet).\n\nMatt Groening tackled American suburbia with The Simpsons, putting his own satirical spin on the traditional family sitcom. The result was nothing short of genius, at least during the show’s golden years. I don’t know anybody who admits to watching the latest episodes of The Simpsons, but apparently these people do exist.\n\nFuturama hilariously parodied well-worn sci-fi tropes, and managed to tell a complex story of destiny, farce, and unrequited love. Many of the high concept sci-fi ideas were put to better use than the stories that inspired them, and a notable handful of the episodes had an extraordinary amount of emotional resonance.\n\nGiven his success deconstructing Americana and science fiction, it makes sense for Groening to tackle the fantasy genre next, especially given its pop culture resurgence, thanks in no small part to Game of Thrones.\n\nGroening himself describes Disenchantment as a story “about life and death, love and sex, and how to keep laughing in a world full of suffering and idiots, despite what the elders and wizards and other jerks tell you.”\n\nIf there’s one thing Groening is good at, it’s crafting cold, unwelcoming worlds, and finding the humor within them. Despite his friendly, simple animation style, both of his animated series have an unrelenting bleakness, despite the warm relationships at their core."
