        "text": "Its known for its comedy, but The Simpsons has also given us its fair share of heartache in its 35 years.\n\nSince airing for the first time in 1989, we've got to know and love so many of the characters in the Simpsons' universe - not just the title family itself. The majority of Springfield's residents have been around since the early years of Matt Groening's imagination and remain on screen to this day.\n\nA select few have been less fortunate, however - most recently Larry Dalrymple, also affectionately known as Larry the barfly - part of the furniture somewhat in Moe's Tavern. In the latest episode, Cremains Of The Day, he dropped down dead in the bar he loved.\n\nREAD MORE: Another Simpsons prediction comes true – almost 30 years after the gag\n\nREAD MORE: The Simpsons 'did it again' predicting Willy Wonka experience with bored Oompa Loompa\n\nThe episode saw Homer, Moe, Lenny and Carl attend Larry's funeral, only to realise they knew so little about him, prompting Homer to ask if they were \"terrible people\". Adding to their sorrow, Larry's mum then paid tribute to her son and mentioned his drinking pals, as she said: \"My Lawrence always talked about his best friends, the fellows at Moe’s Tavern.\"\n\nNow, we look back at the other recurring characters who gone to live in the Simpsons' sky over the past three-and-a-half decades.\n\nBleeding Gums Murphy\n\nWe first met jazz musician 'Bleeding Gums' Murphy Hibbert in season one's Moaning Lisa. His saxophone skills proved inspiring for Lisa, who was mentored by him in later episodes.\n\nHe once famously sang a 26-minute version of the American National anthem \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at a Springfield Isotopes game, which sent the entire crowd to sleep - except Lisa.\n\nAfter Bart is hospitalised, Lisa bumps into Bleeding Gums for a final time, moments before he dies - presumably after suffering a heart attack. He later appears to Lisa from the Heavens in cloud form, however, thanking her for a radio tribute.\n\nMaude Flanders\n\nA next-door neighbour of the Simpsons, Maude was a regular on the show as the wife of Ned Flanders and mum to their two kids, Rod and Todd.\n\nA devout Christian like her husband, Maude joined Marge in campaigning against Itchy and Scratchy and often protested against other matters with Reverend Lovejoy's wife, Helen. She died in season 11, however, after being struck by shirts fired from t-shirt cannons at the Springfield Speedway, resulting in her being knocked from a grandstand.\n\nDr Marvin Monroe\n\nDr Marvin first appeared in season one, offering the Simpsons therapy under his \"family bliss or double your money back\" promise. After failing to succeed though, he threw the family out of his Family Therapy Center, paying up and demanding they never return.\n\nSporadic appearances followed, with the character hosting a radio show on KBBL up until his death was confirmed in the '138th Episode Spectacular'. The episode asked viewers: \"Which popular Simpsons characters have died in the past year?\", to which the answer was joked: \"If you said Bleeding Gums Murphy and doctor Marvin Monroe you are wrong, they were never popular.\"\n\nWhilst the cause of his death was never confirmed, later instalments showed his grave stone as well as the Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital. Bizarrely, however, he later resurfaced at Marge's book signing event, explaining that he \"had been very sick\".\n\nRabbi Hyman Krustofsky\n\nHyman was Springfield's respected Rabbi and father of Krusty the Clown. He was introduced to the show when Bart and Lisa attempted to reunite him with his then-estranged son - something that proved successful leading the pair to reconcile.\n\nHe died in series 26 after Krusty - offended and hurt at being on the receiving end of a comedian's jokes - sought comfort in him. When Krusty asked him if he thinks he is hilarious for reassurance, Hyman simply replies, \"Eh,\" and unexpectedly slumps back in his chair and dies.\n\nMona Simpson\n\nMona - Homer's mum - appeared as a guest in several early season episodes in flashback scenes recalling Homer's childhood. Homer always believed Mona had passed away years previously, only for his dad Abraham to later admit she was actually on the run.\n\nIn a later season her past catches up with her, which sees her carted off to jail on a prison bus, which plunges off a cliff presumably to Mona's doom. However, it becomes apparent that she narrowly escaped and returns in a future episode hoping to make up for lost time with Homer, only for him to refuse, concerned she will abandon him once more.\n\nWracked with guilt, Homer soon performs a U-turn, only to learn she has passed away.\n\nFat Tony\n\nFat Tony - real name Don Marion Anthony D'Amico was the mobster boss of the Springfield mafia, first appearing in season 3's Bart the Murderer episode. A regular in the years that followed, Tony embarked on several illegal enterprises in the town with the assistance of his henchmen, Louie and Legs.\n\nIn season 22 he died in the arms of Homer - believed to have been as the result of a heart attack. He was replaced in He was then replaced in the mob by his cousin, Fit Tony, who evolves into the new Fat Tony - who appears identical to the original character.\n\nEdna Krabappel\n\nBart's class teacher Edna first appeared in series one's Bart the Genius, and was a regular on the show up until her death. Unlucky in love for decades, she eventually marries widower Ned in series 22.\n\nHowever, following the death of Marcia Wallace in 2013 who voiced her, the show's bosses decided to retire the character indefinitely following her final appearance in season 25. The Simpsons first acknowledged Marcia's passing in the episode Four Regrettings and a Funeral, which saw Bart's customary chalkboard gag in the opening credits read: \"We'll really miss you Mrs. K\"."
