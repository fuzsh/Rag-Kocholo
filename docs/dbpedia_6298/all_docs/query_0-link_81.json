Not only is the show the longest running animated series, but it is also the longest running prime time comedy series in American television history.\n\nAsked how long will theSimpsonsstay around, Nancy Cartwright -- known for her role as Bart Simpson -- said, \"You know, as long as we stay healthy and alive.\"\n\n\"I think we can go, and I would personally like to be 82 years old and walking down Hollywood Boulevard... I think that would be way fun,\" she added.\n\nThe show has been successful because of many factors, its timelessness, the family's ability to reinvent itself and the fact that the Simpsons are completely immersed in pop culture.\n\nadvertisement"
