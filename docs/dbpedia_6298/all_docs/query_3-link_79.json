        "text": "The suspect involved in the first homicide of the year 2024 is reportedly 40-year-old Rabat resident Noel Azzopardi, NET News have revealed.\n\nAzzopardi is currently being interrogated by the police after 27-year-old Eric Borg was fatally shot in Rabat’s Nigret area on New Year’s Day.\n\nThe incident took place on Monday afternoon, at around 3.30pm, where an argument reportedly took place between the victim and the suspect in Triq il-Fidloqqom before Borg was shot twice and left on the sidewalk. A police and medical team were dispatched after calls from on-site witnesses but unfortunately, the victim was certified dead on site.\n\nA police spokesperson explained that investigators are attempting to establish what lead to the argument and subsequent shooting, with the suspect’s defense team made up of lawyers Dr. Arthur Azzopardi, Dr. Jacob Magri and Dr. Alex Miruzzi expected to speak with the accused’s family later today.\n\nMore on the story as it develops.\n\n#MaltaDaily\n\nNetflix has delighted fans of the hit series Money Heist with the arrival of its much-anticipated spin-off prequel, ‘Money Heist Berlin.’ Originally announced in 2021, the series has quickly gained popularity as viewers immerse themselves in the backstory of the enigmatic character Berlin, once again masterfully portrayed by Pedro Alonso.\n\n‘Money Heist Berlin’ takes audiences on a thrilling journey as the complex character orchestrates a grand heist in Paris before the events depicted in the original Money Heist series. Creator Álex Pina promises a captivating experience, describing the series as a trip through Berlin’s ‘Golden Age,’ filled with tension, travel, romance, and humour.\n\nDespite the overall positive reception, a notable point of discussion on social media revolves around the change in the English voice actor for Berlin. Some fans have expressed disappointment, noting that the new English-dubbed voice doesn’t match the one from Money Heist, adding an unexpected layer to the viewing experience.\n\nNevertheless, the spin-off continues to captivate audiences, offering a deeper understanding of the beloved character’s history and the events that led to the iconic heists of the original series.\n\nHave you watched the series yet?\n\n#MaltaDaily\n\nDar Tal-Providenza in Siggiewi, Malta, ushered in the New Year with a heartwarming display of generosity as they raised an impressive €1,520,517 during their Festa ta’ Ġenerożità fundraiser on New Year’s Day. The organisation expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the public for their overwhelming support, emphasising the impact of community contributions.\n\nIn a statement, Dar Tal-Providenza thanked the public and disclosed that the funds raised would play a crucial role in maintaining and enhancing their residential services for the 115 individuals with disabilities under their care.\n\nThe financial support will not only sustain the daily operations but will also contribute to the ongoing refurbishment and improvements at Villa Papa Giovanni in Siggiewi. The organisation revealed that extensive renovation work has already been initiated at the villa, and the additional funds will aid in the completion of these vital projects.\n\nThis successful fundraising initiative exemplifies the community’s commitment to ensuring the well-being and quality of life for individuals with disabilities, showcasing the power of collective generosity in making a positive impact on the lives of those in need.\n\n#MaltaDaily"
