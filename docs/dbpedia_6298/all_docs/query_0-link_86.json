        "text": "Danny Elfman, who penned the music of the iconic cartoon, suggests the long-running series is in its final months.\n\nOne of the most iconic TV themes of the last 30 years might soon be played for the last time.\n\nComposer Danny Elfman, who wrote the music for the series’ famous opening credits, has just given a hint that season 32 might be Bart and Lisa’s finale.\n\nIn a recent interview with Joe, Danny Elfman said: “Well, from what I’ve heard, it is coming to an end. So, that argument will also come to an end. I don’t know for a fact, but I’ve heard that it will be in its last year.”\n\nThe Simpsons, created by cartoonist Matt Groening, was first broadcast on 17 December 1989. Earlier this year, the series’ owners, Fox, approved a 32nd season of the show, taking the overall episode tally past 700.\n\nElfman says that the initial success of the show took him by surprise. “All I can say is that I’m so flabbergasted and amazed that it has lasted as long as it did. So, you have to realise, when I scored The Simpsons, I wrote this crazy piece of music, and I expected no-one would hear it, because I really did not think the show had a chance.”\n\nA composer for both big and small screens, Elfman holds four Academy Award nominations for his scores to the films Good Will Hunting, Men in Black, Big Fish and Milk.\n\nHe is also a composer of classical works, and his pieces have been championed by Classic FM’s Orchestra in Scotland, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. This Friday and Saturday the orchestra is presenting gala concerts of his music, taking place in both Edinburgh and Glasgow. Friday’s concert features the UK premiere of his Violin Concerto, Eleven Eleven.\n\nIn a recent interview with a prominent figure of the RSNO, Elfman spoke about being self-taught in composition, although he recommends conservatoire study for any young composers (and note, this interview, was conducted by the eight-month-old son of RSNO players Kennedy Leitch and Katherine Bryan)."
