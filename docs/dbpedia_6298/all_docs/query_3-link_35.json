        "text": "When you think of “The Simpsons,” the long-running animated series based on Portland’s own Matt Groening’s cartoon creations, you don’t necessarily think of romance. But it turns out that a behind-the-scenes love story featuring Yeardley Smith, who provides the voice of Lisa Simpson on the hit show, and a former Springfield, Oregon, police detective, bloomed after the two met during a “Simpsons” special event in Springfield.\n\nAccording to a story in The Hollywood Reporter, it all began in 2014, when Smith reluctantly agreed to represent the Fox show at an event in Springfield. Fans of “The Simpsons” know that Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie live in a town called Springfield. For years, debate raged about whether Groening had named the Simpsons’ hometown after Springfield, Oregon."
