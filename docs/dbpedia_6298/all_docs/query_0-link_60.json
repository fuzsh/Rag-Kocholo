        "text": "The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of the middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its titular family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons many aspects of the human condition including American culture, society, and television.\n\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of aninimated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the first Fox series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1992–1993).\n\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989 the show has broadcast 429 episodes and the twentieth season began airing on September 28, 2008. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007, and has grossed approximately US$526.2 million worldwide to date.\n\nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 24 Emmy Awards, 26 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Time magazine’s December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century’s best television series, and on January 14, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program and as of 2008 is tied with Gunsmoke as the longest running American primetime entertainment series. Homer’s annoyed grunt “D’oh!” has been adopted into the English lexicon, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.\n\n.\n\nGroening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks’s office. Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. However, when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life’s work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family. He named the characters after his own family members, substituting “Bart” for his own name.\n\nThe Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes.In 1989, a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house. Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show’s content. Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called “the mainstream trash” that they were watching. The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with “Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire”, a Christmas special.”Some Enchanted Evening” was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990 because of animation problems.\n\nThe Simpsons was the Fox network’s first TV series to rank among a season’s top 30 highest-rated shows. The show’s success prompted Fox to expand its schedule to a new night (Thursday) and put it head-to-head against the number one ranked The Cosby Show which ultimately hurt the ratings of The Simpsons. In 1992, Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series’ success. The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of The Simpsons—a claim rejected by the courts.\n\nThe show was controversial from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children. At the time, then-President George H. W. Bush said, “We’re going to strengthen the American family to make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons.” Several U.S. public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption “Underachiever (‘And proud of it, man!’)”. Despite the ban, The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated US$2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.\n\n.\n\nThe Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional “Middle American” town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant—a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, a baby who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. The family owns a dog, Santa’s Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball II. Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s (slight differences in animation style notwithstanding).\n\nThe show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV.\n\n.\n\nThe special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition. “Treehouse of Horror” first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode. These pieces usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres. They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the Treehouse series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years, new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox’s current contract with Major League Baseball’s World Series.\n\n.\n\nThe show’s humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show’s background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show. Kristin Thompson argues that The Simpsons uses a “…flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.”\n\nThe show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each. Notable expressions include Homer’s annoyed grunt “D’oh!”, Mr. Burns’ “Excellent…” and Nelson Muntz’s “Ha-ha!”. Some of Bart’s catchphrases, such as “¡Ay, caramba!“, “Don’t have a cow, man!” and “Eat my shorts!” appeared on t-shirts in the show’s early days. However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode “Bart Gets Famous” mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the Krusty the Clown Show solely for saying “I didn’t do it.”\n\n.\n\nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 24 Emmy Awards, 26 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. In a 1998 issue celebrating the 20th century’s greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, Time magazine named The Simpsons the century’s best television series. In that same issue, Time included Bart Simpson in the Time 100, the publication’s list of the century’s 100 most influential people. Bart was the only fictional character on the list. On January 14, 2000, the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Also in 2000, Entertainment Weekly magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named The Simpsons the greatest television show of the 1990s. Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 have voted “The Simpsons” at the top of two polls: 2001’s 100 Greatest Kids’ TV shows, and 2005’s 100 Greatest Cartoons, with Homer Simpson voted into first place in 2001’s 100 Greatest TV Characters. Homer would also place ninth on Entertainment Weekly‘s list of the “50 Greatest TV icons”. In 2002, The Simpsons ranked #8 on TV Guide’s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time; in 2007 it was included in TIME‘s list of the “100 Best TV Shows of All Time”; in 2008 the show was placed in first on Entertainment Weekly‘s “Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 Years”; and Empire named it the greatest TV show of all time."
