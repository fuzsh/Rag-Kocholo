A bequest from Leroy P Steele endowed this prize which was first awarded in 1970. It was set up to honour George David Birkhoff, William Fogg Osgood, and William Caspar Graustein. From 1970 to 1976 the prize was given for outstanding published mathematical research, preference given to work which was broad and particularly well written. In 1976 the Council of the American Mathematical Society decided to award three categories of Leroy P Steele Prizes. These were Lifetime Achievement, Mathematical Exposition, and Seminal Contribution to Research. In 1994 the last of these three categories was put onto a five year cycle of topics: analysis, algebra, applied mathematics, geometry and topology, and discrete mathematics/logic. This last area would alternate between the two topics so that discrete mathematics would be the topic of the award once every ten years.

1997 (For Lifetime Achievement) Ralph S Phillips

... for being one of the outstanding analysts of our time. His early work was in functional analysis: his beautiful theorem on the relation between the spectrum of a semigroup and its infinitesimal generator is striking as well as very useful in the study of PDEs. His extension theory for dissipative linear operators predated the interpolation approach to operator theory and robust control. He made major contributions to acoustical scattering theory in his joint work with Peter Lax, proving remarkable results on local energy decay and the connections between poles of the scattering matrix and the analytic properties of the resolvent. He later extended this work to a spectral theory for the automorphic Laplace operator, relying on the Radon transform on horospheres to avoid Eisenstein series. In the last fifteen years, Ralph Phillips has done brilliant work, in collaboration with others, on spectral theory for the Laplacian on symmetric spaces, on the existence and stability of cusp forms for general noncompact quotients of the hyperbolic plane, on the explicit construction of sparse optimal expander graphs, and on the structure of families of isospectral sets in two dimensions (the collection of drums that sound the same).
