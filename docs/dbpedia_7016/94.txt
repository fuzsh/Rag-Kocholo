The American Mathematical Society invites you to celebrate excellence in mathematics scholarship by nominating a colleague for the 2022 Leroy P. Steele prizes. Nominations run through March 31.

A total of three prizes will be awarded, one in each of the following categories:

Lifetime Achievement: Awarded for the cumulative influence of the total mathematical work of the recipient, high-level of research over a period of time, particular influence on the development of a field, and influence on mathematics through PhD students. The amount of this prize is $10,000.

Mathematical Exposition: Awarded for a book or substantial survey or expository research paper. The amount of this prize is $5,000.

Seminal Contribution to Research in Applied Mathematics: Awarded for a paper, whether recent or not, which has proved to be of fundamental or lasting importance in its field or a model of important research. The amount of this prize is $5,000.

Learn more about the nomination process for each prize, read about past recipients, and submit a nomination via the AMS website. The winners will be announced in January 2022.

Established in 1970 in honor of George David Birkhoff, William Fogg Osgood, and William Caspar Graustein, the Steele prizes are endowed under the terms of a bequest from Leroy P. Steele. The AMS Council formalized the three prize categories in 1993.
