        "text": "\"To his astonishment she came back a week later with correct solutions to all the problems. Not only were they correct, but also clear, original and some cases, brilliant. Weierstrass immediately made every effort to get permission for her to attend lectures; he was unsuccessful, so he offered to meet with her privately and share his lecture notes with her.\n\nShe worked with him for the next four years and received her doctorate in 1874. By the time she got her degree, Sonya had published several original papers in the field of higher mathematical analysis and applications to astronomy and physics. Now she was a significant researcher and expositor of mathematics, but she was still a woman and, therefore, unable to find a job in academia.\"\n\n“Sonya’s greatest success in mathematics occurred in 1888 when she won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Sciences for her paper On the Problem of the Rotation of a Solid Body about a Fixed Point. She won this prize despite the fact that she was a woman and this is how it happened. The rules of the Academy provided that the papers submitted for this honor had to be anonymous, so the judges were unaware that they had selected a paper that was authored by a woman. Actually, her paper was so impressive that the judges decided to double the prize.”\n\nIts headhunter - A smart man without an agenda who secretly wants one.\n\nSo reading between the paragraphs, I find this excerpt conspicuous by its absence:\n\n\"Weierstrass tried to find her an academic position worthy of her talents, but his every effort was blocked by bigotry and an unyielding attitude concerning women. When she could find no market for her mathematical training she got back together with her husband and began a life as poet, theatrical critic, novelist, wife and mother. But she could not stay away from mathematics and began looking for a job again.\n\nHer daughter was less than one year old in 1879 when Sonya again left her husband and moved back to Berlin, then to Paris. She continued to publish papers in the application of mathematics to physics and finally in 1883 she was able to obtain a position in the University of Stockholm as a lecturer on the theory of partial differential equations.\""
