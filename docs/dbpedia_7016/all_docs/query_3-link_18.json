        "text": "Every month in March (due to the 8th of March – International Women’s Day) I also write about great women in mathematics. This year, I have chosen 10 awesome ones, including my all time favourite – Emmy Noether. What people have inspired you to study mathematics?\n\nPhoebe Sarah Hertha Ayrton, born on 28 April 1854, was a British engineer, mathematician, physicist, and inventor.\n\nShe attended Girton College, Cambridge where she studied mathematics. In 1880, Ayrton passed the Mathematical Tripos (the taught mathematics course in the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge) but was not granted a degree because, at this time, Cambridge gave only certificates and not degrees to women. She successfully completed an external examination and received a B.Sc. degree from the University of London in 1881.\n\nUpon her return to London, Ayrton earned money by teaching and embroidery. She put her mathematical skills to practical use – she taught at Notting Hill and Ealing High School, and was also active in devising and solving mathematical problems, many of which were published in “Mathematical Questions and Their Solutions” from the Educational Times. In 1884 Ayrton patented a line-divider, an engineering drawing instrument for dividing a line into any number of equal parts and for enlarging and reducing figures.The line-divider was her first major invention and, while its primary use was likely to be for artists for enlarging and diminishing, it was also useful to architects and engineers. Ayrton’s 1884 patent was the first of many – from 1884 until her death, Hertha registered 26 patents: five on mathematical dividers, 13 on arc lamps and electrodes, the rest on the propulsion of air. She was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society for her work on electric arcs and ripples in sand and water.\n\nMarjorie Lee Browne was a noted mathematics educator. She was one of the first African-American women to receive a Ph.D in mathematics. After receiving her doctorate, Browne was unable to keep a teaching position at a research institution. As a result of this she worked with secondary school mathematics teachers, instructing them in “modern math.” She focused especially on encouraging math education for minorities and women.\n\nBrowne’s work on classical groups demonstrated simple proofs of important topological properties of and relations between classical groups. Her work in general focused on linear and matrix algebra.\n\nThroughout her career, Browne worked to help gifted mathematics students, educating them and offering them financial support to pursue higher education. In 1974 she was awarded the first W. W. Rankin Memorial Award from the North Carolina Council of Teachers of Mathematics for her work with mathematics education.\n\nFan Chung became interested in mathematics from an early age at school in Taiwan. She graduated the National Taiwan University with a B.S. in mathematics and went on to the University of Pennsylvania to pursue a career in mathematics. There she obtained the highest score in the qualifying exam by a wide margin. Her doctoral advisor suggested Ramsey Theory as a subject she could work on. During a single week studying material Chung had come up with new proofs for established results in the field. Chung was awarded a M.S. in 1972 and a Ph.D. two years later. She worked for 20 years at Bell Laboratories and Bellcore, then she decided to go back University of Pennsylvania to become a professor of mathematics. In 1998, she was named Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at University of California, San Diego. To date, she has over 200 publications to her name.\n\nGabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise du Châtelet was a French natural philosopher and mathematician during the early 1730s. I totally recommend you check the Infinitely Irrational Math Podcast about Emilie du Chatelet: http://bit.ly/3lcItno\n\nSofia Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya was a Russian mathematician who made noteworthy contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics. She was the first major Russian female mathematician and a pioneer for women in mathematics around the world. She was the first woman appointed to a full professorship in Northern Europe and was also one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor.\n\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women there were not allowed to attend universities. In order to study abroad, she needed written permission from her father (or husband). Together with her husband, she emigrated from Russia in 1867.\n\nIn Octoer 1870, she moved to Berlin, where she took private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, as the university would not even allow her to audit classes. In 1874 she presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn’s rings and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics summa cum laude, bypassing the usual required lectures and examinations.\n\nShe thereby became the first woman in Europe to hold that degree. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem, which gives conditions for the existence of solutions to a certain class of those equations.\n\nMaria Gaetana Agnesi – She was the first woman to write a mathematics handbook and the first woman appointed as a mathematics professor at a university. She is credited with writing the first book discussing both differential and integral calculus and was a member of the faculty at the University of Bologna, although she never served.\n\nShe also studied the curve – the witch of Agnesi – which has got her name by mistake actually (find out more: http://bit.ly/3c7fLBG).\n\nHypatia of Alexandria, was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, inventor, and philosopher in Egypt, then part of the Eastern Roman Empire. No written work widely recognized by scholars as Hypatia’s own has survived to the present time.\n\nIf you want to find out more about her, check “Hypatia of Alexandria” by Maria Dzielska (http://amzn.to/2AYJafk) *affiliate link*\n\nWang Zhenyi (1768–1797) was a scientist from the Qing dynasty. She breached the feudal customs of the time, which hindered women’s rights, by arduously working to educate herself in subjects such as astronomy, mathematics, geography, and medicine.\n\nZhenyi mastered trigonometry and knew the Pythagorean theorem. She wrote an article called “The Explanation of the Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometry,”. She admired the mathematician Mei Wending (1633–1721 A.D.). He was famous in the early Qing dynasty and wrote the book, “Principles of Calculation”. Wang Zhenyi became a master of this book, even rewriting it with simpler language, and made it available to others under the title, “The Musts of Calculation”. She was very dedicated in her study of mathematics and wrote a book called “The Simple Principles of Calculation” when she was twenty-four. Her studies were difficult and she once said, “There were times that I had to put down my pen and sigh. But I love the subject, I do not give up.”\n\nKatherine Johnson (August 26, 1918 – February 24, 2020) was an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. During her 35-year career at NASA and its predecessor, she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks.\n\nJohnson’s work included calculating trajectories, launch windows, and emergency return paths for Project Mercury spaceflights, including those for astronauts Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and John Glenn, the first American in orbit, and rendezvous paths for the Apollo Lunar Module and command module on flights to the Moon.\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2016, she was presented the Silver Snoopy Award by NASA astronaut Leland D. Melvin and a NASA Group Achievement Award. She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson as a lead character in the 2016 film Hidden Figures. In 2019, Johnson was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\nI kept my favorite mathematician for the last Amalie Emmy Noether – known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. Described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl, Norbert Wiener and others as the most important woman in the history of mathematics, she revolutionized the theories of rings, fields, and algebras.\n\nLastly, but not the least, we recommend you check our infographic post Great Women in Mathematics – I have to say that this topic has been one of the most interesting topics so far. I am very happy I decided to spend a full month reading more about these incredible women. It is very inspirational to find out more about their lives and what they had to do to follow their dreams. Enjoy the following infographics, let me know which is your favorite!\n\nHope you liked this post and you find it useful. Have a great day. If you have ideas for future blog posts, let us know.
