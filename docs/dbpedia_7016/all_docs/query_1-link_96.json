        "text": "Mathematics can help Art Historians and Art Conservators in studying and understanding art works, their manufacture process and their state of conservation. The presentation will review several instances of such collaborations, explaining the role of mathematics in each instance, and illustrating the approach with extensive documentation of the art works.\n\nSpeaker Biography\n\nIngrid Daubechies is a Belgian Physicist and Mathematician, one of the leaders in the area of wavelets, a part of applied harmonic analysis. Wavelets are widely used in data compression and image encoding. Indeed, a wavelet pioneered by Daubechies is the basis of the standard for digital cinema. Ingrid Daubechies has held positions at the Free University in Brussels, Princeton University, and is currently James B. Duke Professor at Duke University. She is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Ingrid Daubechies has received many awards including the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research of the American Mathematical Society."
