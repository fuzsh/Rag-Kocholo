        "text": "A bequest from Leroy P Steele endowed this prize which was first awarded in 1970. It was set up to honour George David Birkhoff, William Fogg Osgood, and William Caspar Graustein. From 1970 to 1976 the prize was given for outstanding published mathematical research, preference given to work which was broad and particularly well written. In 1976 the Council of the American Mathematical Society decided to award three categories of Leroy P Steele Prizes. These were Lifetime Achievement, Mathematical Exposition, and Seminal Contribution to Research. In 1994 the last of these three categories was put onto a five year cycle of topics: analysis, algebra, applied mathematics, geometry and topology, and discrete mathematics/logic. This last area would alternate between the two topics so that discrete mathematics would be the topic of the award once every ten years.\n\n1970 Solomon Lefschetz\n\n... for his paper \"A page of mathematical autobiography\".\n\n1971 James B Carrell\n\n... for his paper written jointly with Jean A Dieudonne \"Invariant theory, old and new\".\n\n1971 Jean A DieudonnÃ©\n\n... for his paper \"Algebraic geometry\", and for his paper, written jointly with James B Carrell \"Invariant theory, old and new\".\n\n1971 Phillip A Griffiths\n\n... for his paper \"Periods of integrals on algebraic manifolds\".\n\n1972 Edward B Curtis\n\n... for his paper \"Simplicial homotopy theory\".\n\n1972 William J Ellison\n\n... for his paper \"Waring's problem\".\n\n1972 Lawrence F Payne\n\n... for his paper \"Isoperimetric inequalities and their applications\".\n\n1972 Dana S Scott\n\n... for his paper \"A proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis\".\n\n1975 Lipman Bers\n\n... for his paper \"Uniformization, moduli, and Kleinian groups\".\n\n1975 Martin D Davis\n\n... for his paper \"Hilbert's tenth problem is unsolvable\".\n\n1975 Joseph L Taylor\n\n... for his paper \"Measure algebras\".\n\n1975 George W Mackey\n\n... for his paper \"Ergodic theory and its significance for statistical mechanics and probability theory\".\n\n1975 H Blaine Lawson\n\n... for his paper \"Foliations\".\n\n1979 Salomon Bochner\n\n... for his cumulative influence on the fields of probability theory, Fourier analysis, several complex variables, and differential geometry.\n\n1979 Hans Lewy\n\n... for three fundamental papers: \"On the local character of the solutions of an atypical linear differential equation in three variables and a related theorem for regular functions of two complex variables\", \"An example of a smooth linear partial differential equation without solution\", and \"On hulls of holomorphy\".\n\n1979 Antoni Zygmund\n\n... for his cumulative influence on the theory of Fourier series, real variables, and related areas of analysis.\n\n1979 Robin Hartshorne\n\n... for his expository research article \"Equivalence relations on algebraic cycles and subvarieties of small codimension\", and his book \"Algebraic geometry\".\n\n1979 Joseph J Kohn\n\n... for his fundamental paper \"Harmonic integrals on strongly convex domains.

His early work was in functional analysis: his beautiful theorem on the relation between the spectrum of a semigroup and its infinitesimal generator is striking as well as very useful in the study of PDEs. His extension theory for dissipative linear operators predated the interpolation approach to operator theory and robust control. He made major contributions to acoustical scattering theory in his joint work with Peter Lax, proving remarkable results on local energy decay and the connections between poles of the scattering matrix and the analytic properties of the resolvent. He later extended this work to a spectral theory for the automorphic Laplace operator, relying on the Radon transform on horospheres to avoid Eisenstein series. In the last fifteen years, Ralph Phillips has done brilliant work, in collaboration with others, on spectral theory for the Laplacian on symmetric spaces, on the existence and stability of cusp forms for general noncompact quotients of the hyperbolic plane, on the explicit construction of sparse optimal expander graphs, and on the structure of families of isospectral sets in two dimensions (the collection of drums that sound the same).\n\n1998 (For Lifetime Achievement) Nathan Jacobson\n\n... for his many contributions to research, teaching, exposition, and the mathematical profession.
