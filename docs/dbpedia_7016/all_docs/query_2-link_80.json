        "text": "Having written an article on Alpha generation (beating the share market) in 2016, I thought it would be worthwhile refreshing it with my recent experience in consulting and in industry.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to summarise 11 investment mental models to watch for to assess where a company is in its value cycle. Value creation is often transient and cyclical and very hard to sustain (and grow) over the long term.\n\nLike a living organism, companies battle external market forces wanting to gain the upper hand (e.g steal their customers) and battle their own internal defence mechanism which can impede their ability to react and adapt (e.g: bureaucracy, complacency, lack of vision and/or strategy, lack of agility, inability to execute ....)\n\nAs a result, value creation is not linear, a company value is likely to go through periods of over and under-performance over-time and wealth can be created by being able to assess where a company is in its value cycle ( detecting the value play early and buying at a reasonable price)\n\nWealth creation (in my opinion) can be realised by correctly identifying whether a company has a value play (see below, 11 different routes not in any particular order). Above all, if you detect an investment opportunity, the price you pay is the critical decision that will drive your alpha generation.\n\nAlpha generation 1 : Winners of tomorrow (the disruptors)\n\nCompanies, which are shaping or re-shaping an industry through market truly innovative business model, create significant value over-time as they gradually appropriate incumbents profit pool . Those companies have recently tended to be in technology/internet based companies bringing disruptive new business models. Those companies create (for themselves) a long run-way of positive structural tailwinds (example being shift from linear to streaming media consumption with Netflix) as customers change their consumption habits. The obvious difficulty is to identify new business model (that customer will embrace), identify the company that will become market leader and correctly quantify market size potential (scalability of business model).\n\nAlpha generation 2 : Fast growers (innovators/consolidators)\n\nFast growers tend to have a clear growth strategy, either through consolidation play (acquiring small players to gain scale) or through unique/differentiate service or product innovation. Whilst consolidation brings economies of scale and synergies, it implies ‘buying’ growth. As such, there is always a risk that a company over-pays or is not able to integrate acquired companies (and therefore not realised the synergistic value). Creating a culture of innovation tends to create more value over time (assuming developed internally/organically) and can deliver a long runway of growth (e.g the iPhone has given Apple a 10 years+ growth run way over 2007-2018). However, innovation leads to other company copying you and eventually, even the most innovative companies, run into innovation fatigue. Still, the trick is to identify early on whether a company has a consolidation play (and executing well) or has an innovation culture that is truly delivering unique/differentiate product desired by consumers.\n\nAlpha generation 3 : Turnarounds\n\nAnother way to generate alpha is to identify companies in a “turnaround” situation with potential for recovery. The questions lies in the timing of buying such a stock (is it the bottom ? is there another downgrading lurking in the next reporting season ?) and whether you are making the correct assessment that the company can recover. Companies finding themselves in such situation (driven by bad management, bad acquisitions, quick negative market shift impacting their core business) are forced to react (often sacking the previous management and bringing new management) to embark in a “turnaround” situation. The difficulty is to identify whether the core business model is still relevant (and can be salvaged, re-booted) or whether the company has found itself in such bad strategic and competition positioning that it just does not have the resources and capabilities to survive. Turnaround are notoriously difficult and take a long-time to achieve, requiring strong management skills and leadership but can generate significant alpha generation.\n\nAlpha generation 4 : Cyclicals upswing\n\nSome companies are more sensitive than others to external non-controlable/ hard to predict events, such as change in economic cycle, consumer sentiment, weather ...). Those companies’ economic fortune will fluctuate according to those events and often have limited ability to mitigate their impact. For instance, retail stocks are highly sensitive to consumer confidence and consumer disposable income growth, resources stocks value are highly sensitive to commodities price. The trick to generate alpha is to correctly estimate and anticipate (usually 6-12 months in advance) where and when the company 's macro drivers are turning (positive/negative). If the overall economic indicators are likely to deteriorate in the next 6-12 months, cyclicals stocks are likely to underperform. The difficultly again is to distinguish between cyclical vs structural factors and understand the company’s ability to flex its economic model (fixed/variable costs) to adjust its business to swing in its revenue.\n\nAlpha generation 5 : Asymmetry of information\n\nIn some cases, companies are not well known by the market (often at IPOs’ time) and can be mispriced (initially) or there is a lack of sell-side analysts coverage. When there is an information vacuum, there is high level of unknown on the company competitive advantage and growth drivers. The market will tend to “ignore” the stock and the company’ s growth story could remain under the radar until a particular catalyst (often growth surprise) triggers market interest. Those stocks tend to be in the small caps (market cap < $200m) or micro-caps ($50m) which are at the early phase of their growth or have an un-tested/un-proven products/business model.\n\nAlpha generation 6 : Take-over\n\nThis is the fastest way for alpha generation when a company is taken-over, usually buyers having to pay a 20%+ premium to gain shareholders approval/control. Some companies are more prone than others to be a take-over target. You will never know when a company will be taken-over, but you can apply some judgement that a company is just too small/weak to continue to exist by its own and that a natural buyer will eventually emerge and acquire it. The higher the potential synergies (cost/revenue or strategic) with a natural buyer, the more likely a company is likely to be acquired.\n\nAlpha generation 7 : Transformational acquisition\n\nSignificant alpha can be created if a company makes a positive transformational acquisition (buying cheap or buying a very complementary business with significant synergy potential). This type of alpha generation is hard to assess given the significant risk of acquisitions. First, it has to be meaningful to the business (is it another bolt-on acquisitions or truly transformational?). Second, the company needs to buy on relatively cheap metrics (to give enough margin for safety). Third, the acquisition needs to truly bring positive synergies (cost/revenue) with clear strategic rationale rather than buying growth. It has been well reported that few acquisitions actually create value (companies tend to over-pay in often in a competitive bidding process)\n\nAlpha generation 8 : Exceptional management leadership\n\nCompanies with exceptional leader can generate significant alpha generation over-time driven by the vision and execution of its leader and leadership team. The CEO drives the strategic agenda of a company and shape the success of its strategic execution. Exceptional leaders can generate significant alpha over-time by making visionary strategic decisions and empowering the whole organization towards a common goal and setting the pace for effective and timely execution (however this can create significant man risk). Again, it is often hard to spot those leaders early on in their position but regular interaction and analysis of their decision can help shape your views whether a particular CEO is indeed in this category.\n\nAlpha generation 9 : Right place, right time\n\nSome companies are just at the right place at the right time and benefits from strong positive structural tailwinds. However, this not sufficient to create value, the company also needs to execute well and have a strong market position/strategy in order to “catch and surf” the structural wave. Some companies are helped from being in a growth industry (example: Australia property boom in the past 20 years until 2018). You also need to be careful of macro cycles and assess whether you are the beginning/ or end of it.\n\nAlpha generation 10 : Slow disciplined growers with strategic assets\n\nCompanies can generate significant value creation over-time by just growing steadily organically and continuously invest above their cost of capital over-time in a disciplined and continuous basis. Those companies tend to not generate high annual earnings growth but just keep on delivering regular growth over-time based on their ability to continuously reinvent themselves (with new products/services), exert pricing power (for regular price increase) and make value creating projects investment in a discipline way. Those stocks tend to be more defensive with stable management and strong internal investment culture and discipline. Also, those companies tend to have strategic assets (often tangible assets) or long-term licences (intangible) given them competitive protection.\n\nAlpha generation 10 : Oversold\n\nLastly, there are times when a company can be oversold (share price significantly deviating below its historical PE average). This happens when market becomes overly bearish on the company's growth outlook, fear of negative news (e.g regulatory decision), large profit expectation miss, or/and a large seller depresses share price (example : large funds losing large mandate having to sell their position). The difficulty is to remove the market noise and make your own analysis on whether this situation is justified or is it transitionary stage. The market (the sum of all investors decisions at a point of time) feeds itself on fear and greed and can (sometimes) shows signs of irrational (even erratic) behaviour, especially when this an information vacuum or awaiting for a critical piece of information (which might significant affect the stock value-up or down)."
