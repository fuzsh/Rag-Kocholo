        "text": "Mathematics Professor Luis Caffarelli of The University of Texas at Austin received the 2009 Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement yesterday from the American Mathematical Society (AMS).\n\nThe award is one of the highest distinctions in mathematics.\n\nThe award citation describes Caffarelli as “one of the world's greatest mathematicians studying nonlinear partial differential equations.” He is considered the greatest authority on “regularity theory.\"\n\nCaffarelli, the Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents’ Chair in Mathematics Number One, joined the Department of Mathematics and the Institute for Computational Engineering and Science in 1997. He has been a professor at the University of Minnesota, the University of Chicago, the Courant Institute and the Institute for Advanced Study.\n\nHe is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has won the AMS Bocher Prize and Rolf Schock Prize of the Swedish Academy of Science."
