        "meta_description": "The aim of our mathematics degree programs is to provide students with a core knowledge of mathematics essential to the understanding of science and other disciplines. Students should gain substantial problem solving and critical reasoning skills and should develop an understanding of the conceptual underpinnings of mathematics. The knowledge gained through these programs should provide the necessary background in mathematics for those students planning to go on to graduate study in mathematics and related fields. This knowledge should also prepare those students who will be immediately entering careers in science, business, education or other fields which are increasingly making use of mathematics.",
