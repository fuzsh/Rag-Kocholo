        "text": "David Mumford is a world renowned mathematician whose work in Algebraic Geometry won him the Fields Medal in 1974. After getting his PhD from Harvard in 1961 under Oscar Zariski, Mumford joined the Harvard faculty before finally leaving for Brown in 1995 to pursue ideas in Computer Vision and Neurosciences. His work spans a broad range of mathematics, conforming to the formally rigorous and ironclad traditions of the Bourbaki in the initial years, while later going on to explore a highly intuitive and computer-assisted discovery of patterns and forms – with the latter passionately exemplified in a jointly authored, avant-garde book “Indra’s Pearls”. Here he relives his younger days, his strong India connection, and on the ideas that have held his attention all these years.\n\nCould you please tell us about your place of birth, and your parents?\n\nWere your parents themselves interested in the Sciences, and where did they hail from?\n\nWas there anyone in your own circles, or even from the extended family, whom you remember or count as a major early positive influence on your eventual life as a scholar?\n\nWWII started when you were barely two, and by the time you were ready to be admitted to school, the war had ended; but the world had been transformed into a vastly different place, in more ways than one. Since you were actually born in England, and have both European and American ancestry, what was the reason for your family shifting from Europe to America?\n\nWhere did your schooling take place, and was there again something ‘singular’ from those days that suggested to you that a full time career in academics was a distinct possibility?\n\nDo you remember any teachers, or mentors outside your family from those years, say between the ages 13 and 18, who influenced you positively?\n\nDid you participate in any major state or national level Science competitions of that era; and if so, what did you actually present there?\n\nYou joined Harvard for your undergraduate course, which given your then already very promising track record, was hardly a surprise. Did you contemplate joining any place other than Harvard?\n\nLead us through your undergraduate days at Harvard in the mid-50s, and of the general mood around the University, including its hallowed halls, and famed dorms. Was it, as the legend goes, buzzing with ideas, and also, did you make any friends from that era, and who continued to be friends with you from then on?\n\nWho were the dominant thinkers on campus then? Also, in particular, who were the stars of the Mathematics department at Harvard?\n\nGeorge Mackey introduced me to the Bourbaki vision of mathematics\n\nHow exactly did the legendary Russia-born, Italy-educated, American mathematician Oscar Zariski become your PhD thesis advisor? What were the circumstances that led you to choose Zariski as your advisor?\n\nLooking closely at Zariski’s mathematical genealogy, we encounter the legacy of Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques and Francesco Severi – legendary Italian mathematicians, all of whom taught Zariski during his own PhD days in Rome. Did Zariski speak about his student days in Italy with you? What were his own impressions on the Italian school’s approach, famed for its intuition, but which was supposedly less rigorous than the approach favored by mathematicians outside Italy?\n\nIn a real sense, Zariski perhaps even symbolized the discontent that a growing band of mathematicians of that age felt regarding the Italian school of Mathematics. As Serge Lang puts it poetically, Zariski was the one who cut the umbilical cord that bound modern Algebraic Geometry to its classical version. What did Zariski himself do mathematically, in order to correct what he clearly felt was an incomplete approach to the pursuit of mathematical truths?\n\nThe years that you found yourself at Harvard, roughly from the mid-50s up to 1961 when you graduated with a PhD, were exceptional years for the world of Mathematics in general. In fact it perfectly dove-tailed with the emergence and the eventual rise of the Bourbaki approach to Mathematics. When did you personally first encounter the Bourbaki style of Mathematics?\n\nGrothendieck breathed and thought mathematics 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\nAs you have remarked in some places, you have found the work of Alexander Grothendieck not only inspirational, but almost surreal. When was your first personal interaction with Grothendieck, and how did it happen? Also, why does his work compel you to admit that he is, in a real sense, even your mathematical hero?\n\nAll this math would then come simply roaring out of his mouth\n\nJean Dieudonné, a long time member of the Bourbaki, remarks that the real purpose underlying the philosophy of abstraction is not just generalisation, but actually the search for more simplicity, and greater clarity. From your own experience, could you please provide us with a simple, yet compelling concrete example that drives home this point.\n\nWhat was the problem that you dealt with in your PhD thesis? What did it set you up to think about during your later years? Did your work post-PhD (up to the Fields Medal) stem from your thesis, or did you also consider completely new problems, and if so, how did you embark on these different problems?\n\nFor the benefit of our young and eager readers, could you please motivate the need to even formulate the existence of a mathematical object such as the “moduli”? What is the simplest and most intuitive way to approach this fundamental idea in Algebraic Geometry?\n\nWe come to the ICM of 1962 held in Stockholm when you were barely 25, and where you presented an idea that had to do with the notion of the so-called “Stability” of vector bundles. Can you lead us to the essential ideas contained in your formulation of the idea of “Stability”, and how this idea unexpectedly ended up strongly influencing the works of two Indian mathematicians from TIFR Mumbai, M.S. Narasimhan and C.S. Seshadri?\n\nOther than Cambridge in Massachusetts, TIFR was the major center for Algebraic geometry in the world\n\nWhat are your impressions on Ancient Indian mathematics? In 2006, you even offered a course in Brown University, on the History of Mathematics, wherein you compared the major civilizational contributions to Mathematics, down the ages. In particular, we would like to hear your thoughts on the Indian invention of the idea of the numeral Zero, an ancient idea though recently reinvigorated again in public imagination, thanks to a more accurate dating of the Bakhshali manuscript?\n\nThere is one moduli space, one for each genus. It’s as real as having the planets of the Solar system\n\nIn a recent work you studied the method used by Chinese astronomers to predict Eclipses. This was followed by a work by Jayant Shah that compared contemporaneous methods by Indians, to predict eclipses. What do these findings teach us about the sophistication and the robustness of models of prediction used by our Indian ancestors?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the 7th Century Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, especially on his idea of composing any two known solutions of certain types of algebraic equations, in order to generate a third. Can this be seen as the genesis of an idea that simply had no precedence in the past, and thus truly engendered and bequeathed the seeds of the operational idea of symmetry, so central to modern algebraic thought? If so, happening as it did in the 7th Century, a full millennium before the likes of an Abel, Galois and Lie, does it qualify as the earliest known example of the seeds of modern algebraic thought? As you doubtless would have noted, this idea also directly bears on the very name of this publication, Bhāvanā!!\n\nComputers are quickly becoming both indispensable and intelligent, too. In the richly illustrated book titled “Indra’s Pearls”, you and your co-authors extend the role that computers usually play in fundamental research, going beyond generating streams of opaque numbers to actually unraveling hidden patterns, forms and insights. All of which would have arguably remained firmly out of reach of human imagination, especially of the visual kind. How do you see this coming together of computing and mathematics, and is it even a desirable union in the first place?\n\nThe story of the Indian mathematician C.P. Ramanujam presents a poignant case of a man blessed with exceptional abilities, but who could yet not conquer his own inner fears and insecurities. You collaborated with him, and even authored a book with him. How important is it to maintain a healthy balance between the inner mental worlds that mathematicians create and comfortably inhabit, and the external world, where their actual physical lives are really lived out?\n\nYour work has seamlessly straddled the worlds of both the purer and the applicable sides of mathematics, convincingly establishing that any divide that separates the two is not only limiting, but also artificial. Theta functions, traditionally studied by Algebraic Geometers and Number Theorists find themselves unexpectedly appearing in the dynamics of nonlinear wave propagation, so central to the transmission of information through light signals in Fiber Optic Cables. Is the time ripe to publicly dismantle the artificial barriers that stand between the pure and the applied aspects of Mathematics?\n\nWhat made you transition from Algebraic geometry to other areas of mathematics, including pattern theory/computer vision? Can you talk in detail about this transition, and your life at Brown University as a professor? Did it require mastering new jargon? What was that like? What was similar and what was different between the atmosphere at Brown University and Harvard University – both in terms of your colleagues, the Division, the broader university, as well as the curriculum and students?\n\nIn 1989, the world of academia was pleasantly surprised to note a paper that appeared in the Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, wherein you broke into the world of Computer Vision and Brain Studies. Please share your thoughts on this departure from Algebraic Geometry.\n\nWhat, in broad terms, is the philosophy underlying the use of Partial Differential Equations for problems in Computer Vision. Here we are referring to the idea that is now popularly called the Mumford-Shah functional, recognizing your work in this area, done with your collaborator, Jayant Shah, a mathematician at Northeastern University?\n\nWhat is the role of the late Swedish scientist, Ulf Grenander, in getting you interested in the area of Pattern Theory?\n\nAt the turn of this century, you had written an article about the “Dawning of the Age of Stochasticity”? Can you talk about the basic point you were trying to convey in this article? Did your own research touch upon these aspects? What led you to write this article, and what are your views on this subject twenty years later? Do you still see this as an important frontier? Or do you see new frontiers?\n\nHow do you compare the subject of Pattern Theory, versus the present rage in Computer Science, Deep Learning? Do you feel the latter field has scope for the development of deep mathematical theory?\n\nI lived 5 months on this boat going around the Caribbean\n\nFrom the Fields Medal in 1974, to the Shaw Prize, Steele Prize, Wolf Prize, and the National Medal of Science, you have won it all. Despite the difficulty in choosing one above the other, is there a body of work that you are truly happy to have done, and contributed to. If so, what is it? And why would you choose this over others?\n\nThe time has certainly come to dismantle the artificial barriers between pure and applied math\n\nYou are a keen sailor, and own a yacht. Can you talk about how you developed this interest? And whether you still pursue this avocation? Can you talk a bit about any other hobbies or passions that you have aside from mathematics?\n\nCan you talk a bit about the role played by the people in your life (family and non-mathematician friends), if any, in helping create an environment that allowed you to pursue mathematics at the highest level?\n\nHow did you meet your first wife, Erika? And what was her relationship with India? And how did the decision to adopt an Indian girl come about?\n\nFinally, do you have any advice for young and aspiring mathematicians?\n\nIn my view, any new abstraction should be justified by solving a traditional problem in traditional areas of mathematics\n\nOn that note, Professor David Mumford, we thank you for taking time to speak with us despite your various engagements. We wish you robust health, mathematical enjoyment and continued research productivity in the years to come.\n\nAcknowledement: The authors would like to thank Shilpa Gondhali of BITS Pilani–Goa campus, and Aditya R Bharadwaj, a 16 year old Junior High student from the class of 2022 of Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA for help in transcribing the article.
