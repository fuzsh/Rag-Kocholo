        "text": "Summary of ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault\n\nGÃ©ricault's short career had a huge impact on the history of modern art and the evolution of French 19th century painting in particular. His radical choice of subjects taken from contemporary life, his fusion of classical forms with an atmospheric, painterly style, his passion for horses, his attraction to sublime and horrific subjects, and his compassion for the weak and vulnerable in society make him a singularly complex artist, but one who helped set the path for Romanticism's emphasis on emotion and subjectivity. His most famous work, The Raft of the Medusa, was a watershed moment in the history of modern art, as it married the immediacy of current events and an eyewitness sensibility with the traditional, monumental format of a grand Salon painting. Much of Gericault's work relied on keen observation, social awareness and at times a politically engaged view of the world around him. Indeed, a unique combination of realism and raw emotion can be seen in many of his works, including the late series of monomaniacs and his earlier \"portraits\" of guillotined heads.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nGericault's art was utterly contemporary in its attention to current events and the realities of the human condition. He depicted dramatic scenes from real life on a monumental scale and found inspiration as a draughtsman in the most humble subjects. This can be seen in his colossal canvas, The Raft of the Medusa, his lithographs of London's poor and his late portraits of the criminally insane.\n\nThough he absorbed the lessons of the Old Masters - Michelangelo was particularly important - GÃ©ricault's use of brisk, energetic brushstrokes and contrasting light effects created atmospheric scenes which broke free from the refined NÃ©oclassical style of painting.\n\nMuch of Gericault's art typifies what we now think of as Romantic, with its attention to the exotic, the emotional, and the sublime. This can be seen in part as a reaction to the earlier Neoclassicism of David and Ingres, which embodied Enlightenment values of order and reason. With Gericault, the individual artist's subjective, emotional response is what counts, a concept that would carry forward into the 20th century.\n\nImportant Art by ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault\n\nBiography of ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault\n\nChildhood and Education\n\nJean-Louis-AndrÃ©-ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault was the only child of wealthy, conservative parents. His father was a lawyer and his mother's family were tobacco growers. When he was four his family moved to Paris, which allowed GÃ©ricault to be educated in the most prestigious schools. At age fifteen, his drawing talent was recognized and he began to seriously study art.\n\nGÃ©ricault's early years were not without loss. His mother died in 1808, even before he graduated from secondary school. The death of his grandmother four years later resulted in his being left a significant annuity that would allow him to live comfortably and gave him the independence to pursue his art without any financial worries.\n\nEarly Training\n\nGÃ©ricault was fortunate to have trained with Pierre Bouillon and Carle Vernet before joining the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied under Pierre-Narcisse GuÃ©rin. To avoid his son being conscripted into the army, in 1812 GÃ©ricault's father paid for a man to go into military service in his son's stead. This postponement of duty allowed the young artist time to create his painting Charging Chasseur (1812), which brought him both recognition and an award when presented at the Salon of 1812.\n\nThough GÃ©ricault was serious in his studies, he often tried to escape the studio to draw horses (a great passion of his). He was eventually expelled from GuÃ©rin's studio after an innocent fight with other students, during which he threw a pail of water that accidentally fell on his teacher's head.\n\nIn 1814 GÃ©ricault joined the Third Brigade of the First Company of the Royal Musketeers and served for a year. The prestige and romance associated with this position must have appealed to the artist, who was generally recognized as stylish, handsome and self-aware. He was even known to use paper curlers to make his naturally straight hair more fashionably wavy, though he kept this a secret.\n\nAs with many young artists of this period, GÃ©ricault competed for the coveted Prix de Rome, which included a paid study period in Italy. Though he failed to win the prize, he decided to travel to Italy on his own. While there he discovered the art of Michelangelo and the Baroque, both of which would have a profound influence on his own work, both in his figural representations and his dramatic use of light and dark. The trip also offered him a means of avoiding the complications of an affair he was having with his uncle's young wife.\n\nWhile in Italy GÃ©ricault made it his aim to study the great masters, adopting a strict and serious program for himself. He outlined his goals thus: \"To draw and paint after the great Old Masters. - Read and compose - Anatomy. Antiques - Music - Italian. [...] Concern myself only with the style of the Old Masters and compose, without going out and always alone.\" Nonetheless, he was also fascinated with everyday life in Italy, and followed accounts of Italian bandits, outlaws and peasants, all of which inspired some of his best works of the period. Gericault slowly began to move away from the traditional classical themes that were popular in French artmaking at the time and to adopt a more modern approach to painting that involved creating dramatic, compositionally complex narratives with a heightened use of color and light. This marks the beginning of the movement known as Romanticism, of which GÃ©ricault was an important early member.\n\nMature Period\n\nGericault's Romanticism was in full swing when he returned to Paris in 1817, as can be seen in his large-scale landscape paintings depicting the times of the day, Morning, Noon, and Evening, all completed in 1818. These works were commissioned by his uncle - the same uncle whose wife Gericault was having an affair with. When she bore an illegitimate son in August 1818 his uncle refused the works and they stayed in the artist's studio until his death. The fact that GÃ©ricault fathered a child out of wedlock would be kept a family secret until it was discovered by scholars in 1976.\n\nDuring his short career GÃ©ricault created groups of works focused on particular themes, including horses, scenes of military battle and soldiers, Latin American and Spanish revolutionary figures, and finally Orientalist subjects. These themes fit well within the Romantic approach to artmaking which so influenced GÃ©ricault's contemporaries. Indeed, many of the early proponents of the Romantic style, such as EugÃ¨ne Delacroix, Ary Scheffer, Paul Huet, and LÃ©on Cognet, studied, like GÃ©ricault, in the studio of GuÃ©rin. Despite the Neoclassical influence of their master, they pioneered a style which celebrated emotions and ideals such as freedom, heroism, loss, and wonder. The emphasis on human emotions and the search for exotic or contemporary subject matter were tantamount for the poets, writers, musicians, and artists associated with the movement that was later named Romanticism.\n\nAs with his fellow Romantics, GÃ©ricault was attracted to sublime and often horrific subjects. Some have caricatured GÃ©ricault as a brooding figure who was fascinated by the sight of violence, mental illness, and death, but it is more likely that these subjects provided fertile ground to push the boundaries of his artistic expression. In her book on Gericault, Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer described the artist as \"unfettered by prejudices and rules, and bent on the contemporary, horrific beauty ... of Romantic modernism.\"\n\nGericault applied his interest in macabre subjects to a contemporary subject in his most famous work, The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819). Providing one of the clearest and best examples of French Romanticism, the work dealt with the highly controversial shipwreck of the French ship the MÃ©duse (Medusa). GÃ©ricault was so focused on creating this work that it is believed that he shaved his cherished hair, knowing his vanity would prevent him from wanting to abandon his studio to appear in public.\n\nFollowing the polarized reception of The Raft of the Medusa at the 1819 Salon GÃ©ricault travelled to England, where he stayed for more than a year. He briefly returned to Paris in the middle of his sojourn stopping on the way in Brussels to visit the great Neoclassical painter, Jacques-Louis David, who was living there in exile. Gericault suffered ill health while in England, including bouts of sciatica (exacerbated by horse riding), pneumonia, and depression (the latter may have included a failed suicide attempt). However, despite these maladies, Gericault greatly enjoyed wandering the streets of London, as he describes in a letter to a friend: \"for relaxation, [I] wander about the streets which are so full of constant movement and variety that you would never leave them, I am sure.\" He fully immersed himself in London life, socializing with English artists, attending boxing matches, riding horses, and even maintaining a light-hearted affair with an upper-class British lady about whom he wrote: \"she calls me the god of painting and she adores me as such.\" He was, however, also moved by the plight of the English poor and created a series of lithographs on the subject, as well as other prints featuring English country life and sporting events. Indeed, Gericault experimented widely during his career with the relatively new medium of lithography, and became quite skilled as a printmaker. Monopolizing on the French interest in English life (there was a vogue for all things English in France at the time), upon returning from London in December 1821, GÃ©ricault continued to create works with English themes that found a ready audience in France.\n\nLater Period\n\nDespite having achieved great artistic success, the last years of GÃ©ricault's life were troubled. After returning from London, he invested in an industrial plan to create a factory which was to produce artificially manufactured stone. The plan failed and resulted in financial hardship with the loss of economic stability he had thus far relied upon. In addition, his health continued to degrade, he fell into a depression, and he began exhibiting destructive behavior. It is perhaps this darkening of his mood which inspired his last great works, the Monomaniacs: a series of haunting portrait paintings of the mentally ill. Of the ten originally painted works, five are accounted for today. They were discovered years after the artist's death in 1863 in the attic of a house in Germany by art critic Louis Viardot.\n\nDuring the last days of his life, GÃ©ricault had to have a tumor on his lower spine removed which was the result of three horse riding accidents that occurred in the spring of 1822. Forever interested in the body as a source of artistic inspiration, he refused anesthesia so that he could see, with the aid of a mirror, the elements of his body as the surgeon performed the operation. GÃ©ricault soon died of his numerous illnesses. His friend and admirer Ary Schefffer recorded the scene in his painting The Death of GÃ©ricault (1824).\n\nThe Legacy of ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault\n\nGÃ©ricault's impressive approach to artmaking helped to shape the Romantic art movement. His choice of modern subject matter, coupled with the use of complex poses and dramatic light effects inspired the work of future Romantic painters such as EugÃ¨ne Delacroix and Ary Sheffer. Like them, GÃ©ricault mined the depths of the human psyche, using the physical body as the outward symbol of the (often degraded) soul. In popular perception Gericault has come to exemplify the notion of the \"Romantic\" artist in a broader sense. Known for his highly individualistic and courageous creative spirit, but also for the suffering and torment he endured, GÃ©rcault's somewhat sentimentalized legacy can be found in the tragic portrayal of such artists as Vincent van Gogh and Amadeo Modigliani.\n\nThe Raft of the Medusa has become one of the legendary paintings of the Modern period. Sandra Cinto, Max Ernst, Jeff Koons, Vik Muniz, Peter Saul, and Frank Stella are just some of the artists who have drawn direct inspiration from that epic painting.\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault"
