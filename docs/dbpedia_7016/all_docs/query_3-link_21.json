        "text": "What A Strange Mathematician! = Here is what happened: David Bryant Mumford (born 1937) is an American mathematician known for his work in algebraic geometry and then for research into vision and pattern theory. He won the Fields Medal and was a MacArthur Foundation Fellow. In 2010 he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He is currently a University Professor Emeritus in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. The Wolf Prize in Mathematics is awarded almost annually by the Wolf Foundation in Israel. It is one of the six Wolf Prizes established by the Foundation and awarded since 1978; the others are in Agriculture, Chemistry, Medicine, Physics and Arts. According to a reputation survey conducted in 2013 and 2014, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics is the third most prestigious international academic award in mathematics, after the Abel Prize and the Fields Medal. Until the establishment of the Abel Prize, it was probably the closest equivalent of a \"Nobel Prize in Mathematics\", since the Fields Medal is awarded every four years only to mathematicians under the age of 40. The Wolf Prize includes a monetary award of $100,000. The American mathematician David Mumford, co-winner of the 2008 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics, announced upon receiving the award yesterday that he will donate the money to Bir Zeit University, near Ramallah, and to Gisha, an Israeli organization that advocates for Palestinian freedom of movement. In the rest of the post I reproduce the statement from this strange mathematician. = Mathematics in Israel flourishes today on this high international plane. Its lifeblood is the free exchange of ideas with scholars visiting, teaching, learning from each other, traveling everywhere in the world. But sadly this is not the case in occupied Palestine where education struggles to continue and travel is greatly limited. Therefore I have decided to donate my part of the Wolf Prize in Mathematics to the cause of helping the university community in occupied Palestine survive and flourish. Its continued existence affects crucially the opportunities and dreams of the next generation and specifically whether potential mathematicians there have the opportunity to join this international community of scholars. For this reason, I am giving half of my prize to the Israeli foundation ‘Gisha’ (www.gisha.org) which works to further the right to education and freedom of movement of Palestinians and half to Birzeit University (www.birzeit.edu) directly. This statement was made public as part of a press release by Gisha - Legal Center for Freedom of Movement the day after the ceremony. This resulted in a wave of emails in my inbox, comments on blogs, and letters to Haaretz. In these comments, I have been called a racist, an anti-semite and even a dingbat by some, but also a true mensch and “avec du panache” by others. I reject vehemently the first two and don’t feel the others are very accurate either.\n\nIndian mathematics Indian mathematics emerged in the Indian subcontinent from 1200 BCE until the end of the 18th century. In the classical period of Indian mathematics (400 CE to 1200 CE), important contributions were made by scholars like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara II,Varāhamihira, and Madhava. The decimal number system in use today was first recorded in Indian mathematics. Indian mathematicians made early contributions to the study of the concept of zero as a number, negative numbers,arithmetic, and algebra. In addition, trigonometry was further advanced in India, and, in particular, the modern definitions of sine and cosine were developed there. These mathematical concepts were transmitted to the Middle East, China, and Europe and led to further developments that now form the foundations of many areas of mathematics. Ancient and medieval Indian mathematical works, all composed in Sanskrit, usually consisted of a section of sutras in which a set of rules or problems were stated with great economy in verse in order to aid memorization by a student. This was followed by a second section consisting of a prose commentary (sometimes multiple commentaries by different scholars) that explained the problem in more detail and provided justification for the solution. In the prose section, the form (and therefore its memorization) was not considered so important as the ideas involved. All mathematical works were orally transmitted until approximately 500 BCE; thereafter, they were transmitted both orally and in manuscript form. The oldest extant mathematical document produced on the Indian subcontinent is the birch bark Bakhshali Manuscript, discovered in 1881 in the village of Bakhshali, near Peshawar (modern day Pakistan) and is likely from the 7th century CE. A later landmark in Indian mathematics was the development of the series expansions for trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and arc tangent) by mathematicians of the Kerala school in the 15th century CE. Their work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series). However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.\n\nNational Mathematics Day 2023 . National Mathematics Day is celebrated every year on December 22 to honor the birth anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a renowned mathematician known for his extraordinary contributions to number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. . Born in 1887 in Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan displayed an early affinity for mathematics, showcasing exceptional talent and intuition. By the age of 12, Ramanujan had delved into the complexities of trigonometry, hinting at the extraordinary mathematical mind that would later captivate the world. At 15, he acquired a pivotal resource, George Shoobridge Carr's \"Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics,\" a book that further fueled his passion and expanded his knowledge. . Ramanujan's contributions to mathematics were groundbreaking, particularly in the realms of number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite facing challenges and limited formal education, his insights led to the discovery of numerous theorems and formulas that continue to influence mathematical research. . National Mathematics Day serves to honor Ramanujan's legacy and promote the importance of mathematics in academic and practical contexts. On this day, like Srinivasa Ramanujan, who lacked formal education, children are encouraged to go beyond textbooks and engage in critical thinking and logical reasoning. On this occasion, schools and colleges organize several competitions, Olympiads, and other educational events. . https://lnkd.in/dK4KcmJb . . . #NationalMathematicsDay #RamanujanDay #MathematicsLegacy #MathematicsInspiration #CelebratingMath #NumberTheory #InfiniteSeries #MathematicalMind #MathematicsEducation #CriticalThinkingDay #LogicalReasoning #MathematicsForAll #MathematicsInnovation #MathematicsChallenge #MathematicsInfluence #MathematicsResearch #MathematicsCompetition #Olympiads #MathematicsAwareness #MathematicsDay2023 #csrindia #csreducationprograms #CorporateSocialResponsibility #SocialResponsibility #CorporateResponsibility #CSRInitiatives #csractivities #karnataka #stemlearning\n\nPopularize the Teaching of Mathematics in Nigerian Schools Recently, a mathematician, Michel Talagrand, won the 2024 Abel Prize, otherwise called the Nobel Prize in Mathematics. This makes sense in his work on researching probability theory and the existence of randomness with computer proofs. In it, he found a guaranteed way to win the lottery in 2023, among others. The subject mathematics involves the basic arithmetic manipulation of numeric numbers, figures, letters, alpha-numeric characters and sounds, embracing any of; additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and complementation, with the possible permutation and combination of the logical relational operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), equal to, etc. within a case scenario, with the intent to achieve some useful result to solve a particular problem. Consequently, according to a Greek philosopher and sage, Pythagoras, who made important developments in mathematics, “without mathematics, no true wisdom is possible.” Confirming this further, Nigeria’s late Professor Chike Obi, an icon in mathematics, advised that the possession of first degree or HND in mathematics should be a prerequisite to studying any professional courses, because, according to him, mathematics is the foundation for logic and through the knowledge of it, other understandings are enabled and established. In this regard, the federal government should, as a matter of urgency, make it mandatory for all tertiary institutions awarding the NCE to sponge their syllabi or curricula with arithmetic and basic mathematics courses, irrespective of their diverse disciplines and specializations. This will go a long way towards arresting the poor formative background and apathy towards mathematics now prevalent in present-day students. https://lnkd.in/e2G64s7a\n\nMao Zedong shakes hands with Chike Obi, Head of the Nigerian delegation at the Beijing Scientific Seminar, Beijing, China, August 1964. Chike Obi, born on April 7, 1921, achieved a historic milestone as the first Nigerian to earn a PhD in mathematics in 1950. Beyond his academic accomplishments, Professor Obi led a multifaceted life as a politician, mathematician, and professor. He dedicated years to academia before retiring and establishing the Nanna Institute for Scientific Studies in Onitsha. A distinguished Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Obi garnered international recognition for his groundbreaking work in mathematics. Notably, he was awarded the Ecklund Prize by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics for his original contributions to Differential Equations and pioneering efforts in advancing mathematics within Africa. Obi was educated in various parts of Nigeria before reading mathematics as an external student at the University of London. Immediately after his first degree, he won a scholarship to do research study at Pembroke College, Cambridge, followed by doctoral studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, becoming in 1950, the first Nigerian to receive a PhD in Mathematics. Chike Obi received acclaim in the field of mathematics, earning the Sigvard Eklund Prize for his original contributions to differential equations from the International Centre for Theoretical Physics. Serving as a university teacher, he dedicated his career to academia until his retirement as an Emeritus Professor in 1985. In 1997, Professor Obi made headlines by asserting that he was the third person to solve Fermat's Last Theorem, following Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor's breakthrough in 1994. Additionally, he claimed to have discovered an elementary proof for Fermat's Last Theorem, conducting this research at his Nanna Institute for Scientific Studies in Onitsha, Eastern Nigeria. The findings were published in the journal \"Algebras, Groups and Geometries.\" However, subsequent scrutiny through a review in Mathematical Reviews revealed that Obi's proof was ultimately deemed a false one. Despite this outcome, the significance of his attempt and the uniqueness of his approach garnered attention in the mathematical community. In 1962, Chike Obi was arrested and charged with treason alongside prominent figures, including Obafemi Awolowo. They were alleged to be plotting the overthrow of the government. Despite the gravity of the charges, Obi was later released due to a lack of sufficient evidence. With the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War in 1967, Obi aligned himself with Biafra and actively worked for the rebel leader Emeka Ojukwu. His involvement reflected the complex and divisive nature of the political climate during the war. Professor Chike Obi died on March 13, 2008, and was survived by his wife, Brenda, and their four children. He was 86. #HistoryVille"
