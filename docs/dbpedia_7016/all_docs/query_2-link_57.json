They are from seven different countries, and our discussions have been conducted in four different languages.\n\nWhile in office, I was the scientific advisor of fourteen doctoral students, who successfully defended their theses (1974—2005). Since then I have been the principal scientific advisor of four PhD students, who got their degrees in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2016; the first two at Uppsala University, the third a Stockholm University, and the last at l'Université des Sciences, des Techniques et des Technologies de Bamako (USTTB)."
