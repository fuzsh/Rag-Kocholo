        "text": "This 2006 article by Ed John Merriman and Jay Winter, titled “The Nobel Prize,” is about the history and importance of the Nobel Prize, and how it works. To understand the history of the Nobel Prize, we must start with the death of the Alfred Nobel. Alfred Nobel was known for his work with chemicals and explosives, and was actually the inventor of dynamite. Upon providing dynamite to the world, solely for the use of mining, he found his creation misused for violence, a new war tool that was used to kill thousands of people. In regret for bringing all this destruction, he decided to reserve all his money, to prize others who made notable differences in the world, specifically in the fields of physics, medicine, literature, chemistry, and peace (as stated in Alfred Nobel’s will). The economics prize would later be added and funded by the Bank of Sweden, in 1968. Once Nobel died on December 10th, 1896, his will was found and executed by his assistant Ragnar Sohlman. Sohlman then created the Nobel Foundation, whose purpose was to administer the capital, from Nobel’s will, for the prizes. Even though the Nobel Foundation is given the power of financing, they are not in charge of choosing winners, or laureates. Laureates are chosen by Nobel Committees, one for each prize. These committees receive thousands of nominations yearly, and narrow the candidates down to a little over a 100, per category. These committees then consult with field experts, to determine not only the quality of work, but also its impact on the field of study. As October comes, the candidates are narrowed down to a few, and a simple majority vote takes place, to choose the recipient. The decisions are then made public, and the recipient earns the prize at the ceremon...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...r than an opinion, to determine the difficulty of winning the prize. The author is a credible writer, because he is a historian specializing in World War One’s impact on Europe during the 20th century, and he is also from Yale University. The author has no personal gain with this article, because it is purely informational.\n\nI personally believe the Nobel Prize is the one of the most prestigious prizes in the world. Throughout history, Nobel winners have made large changes in today’s world, which have revolutionized the way we live our lives. Another reason I believe this, is the long selection process that ensures the quality of the candidate’s work. Upon reading this article, I am curious to learn more about the prize creator Alfred Nobel. Where did the majority of his money come from? Why did he make the prize? These are my opinions and questions on the topic."
