To date ICMI has supported five CANPs. On February 15–16, 2023, a workshop of all five CANPS was conducted in Bangkok. This was a significant event because all CANP teams and the ICMI Executive Committee (EC) were meeting in-person for the first time since the COVID pandemic. Moreover, several new members had joined CANP, and it was important for them to meet with the larger group and with the ICMI EC. Representatives of the IMU also attended the workshop.\n\nThe workshop aimed to further the dual goals of CANP, namely: (a) create sustained and effective regional networks of teachers, mathematics educators and mathematicians in low-income and middle-income countries, also linking these networks to international support networks, to enhance mathematics education at all levels; (b) develop the educational capacity of those responsible for mathematics teachers.\n\nFor further information on CANP please visit this webpage.\n\nJean-Luc Dorier\n\nICMI Secretary General\n\nYuri Ivanovich Manin passed away on January 7, 2023, at the age of 85. He was a towering figure who made fundamental contributions to several areas of mathematics ranging from number theory to algebraic geometry to mathematical physics. His ideas and insights have permeated the entire discipline, giving rise to many new fields of contemporary research.\n\nY. I. Manin was born on February 16, 1937, in Simferopol, USSR. He graduated from Moscow University in 1958 and obtained his PhD in 1960 and Habilitation in 1963. He worked as Principal Researcher at Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow from 1960 to 1993 and as a Professor at Moscow University from 1965 to 1992. After one year as a Professor at MIT he became a Scientific Member and a Collegium Member at the Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik in Bonn in 1993 and then was a Director at MPI from 1995 to 2005, when he became a Professor Emeritus. He was also a Board of Trustees Professor at Northwestern University from 2002 to 2011.\n\nHis talent manifested early and his first published paper appeared in 1956, followed by a series of fundamental works spanning the next decades.\n\nHis proof of the Mordell conjecture for function fields has led to the concept now known as the Gauss—Manin connection, a natural concept of parallel transport in the vector bundle formed by the cohomology of the fibers of an algebraic fibration. This concept by now is an indispensable tool in many areas of mathematics.\n\nThe Dieudonné—Manin classification theory of formal groups is at the origin of a host of developments in arithmetic geometry including p-adic Hodge theory.\n\nTogether with V. A. Iskovskih, Yuri Manin developed a method of proving non-rationality of algebraic varieties by analyzing their groups of birational isomorphisms. This allowed them to prove that 3-dimensional quartic hypersurfaces are not rational.\n\nIn diophantine geometry, a discovery of lasting and fundamental value is the so-called Manin (or Brauer—Manin) obstruction to the validity of the Hasse principle. This principle, originating in arithmetic theory of quadratic forms, says that the existence of points over all completions of a number field implies the existence of a rational point. However, it turns out that non-triviality of a certain element of the Brauer group (the Manin obstruction) can ensure failure of this principle.\n\nA very influential conjecture of Manin from the late 1980s concerns the asymptotic growth of the number of points of bounded height on a variety over a number field. It has stimulated a lot of subsequent research and anticipated, in a lot of ways, the later point of view on curve counting provided by the physical approach of mirror symmetry.\n\nThe now classical work of Manin (joint with M. F. Atiyah, N. Hitchin and V. Drinfeld) on the classification of instantons in 1978 (the so-called AHDM construction) gave a highly non-trivial application of abstract algebraic geometry to problems of gauge field theory in mathematical physics. Besides the intended application, it had an enormous influence on several other areas. On one hand, cohomological methods of classification developed in this work have led to systematic studies of derived categories of coherent sheaves as invariants of algebraic varieties. On the other hand, the very precise and beautiful form of the linear algebra data involved in the AHDM construction has lent itself to various generalizations constructing moduli spaces of instantons on other manifolds and more general symplectic manifolds of great importance in representation theory.\n\nIt is hard to do justice to the entirety of Manin's contributions. However, it is important to emphasize that they are not restricted to pure mathematics. Thus, along with Richard Feynman, he was one of the originators of the idea of quantum computers.\n\nA universal mind, Yuri Ivanovich viewed mathematics as an integral part of human endeavor in the wider, holistic sense. Among other things, he spent considerable time thinking about the role of language in mathematics, science and culture in general, about its historical genesis and about its underpinnings that can be found in neuro-physiology. Some of these thoughts found their expression in articles and essays collected in his book “Mathematics as metaphor”.\n\nManin's seminars and lecture courses at Moscow University were a legend and a fixture for several decades. They were the center of a thriving informal community of people for whom mathematics was the focus of their existence. In Manin's remarkable style, the seminars covered exciting new developments in sometimes quite diverse areas, work of seminar members as well as his own and (rather infrequently, due to restrictions on foreign travel) work of outside guests. He had a rule against seminar members, especially his students, talking about their own work, asking other members to present work of their colleagues. One of most famous examples was the series of talks of V. Drinfeld on the work of I. Cherednik and vice versa. Many famous mathematicians have been shaped by these seminars and courses. This includes not only people who have been his students in the formal sense but also many others who were influenced by him in a profound way. He was an extremely successful teacher and advisor with a unique ability to spark the student's own, original way of thinking. After moving to the Max Planck Institute, he continued his seminars in the same signature style, in Bonn. He created a remarkable scientific school, supervising more than 40 PhD theses.\n\nY. I. Manin was awarded a number of prizes including the Lenin Prize for Science (1967), the Brouwer Gold Medal (1987), the Nemmers Prize (1994), the Schock Prize in Mathematics (1999), the Faisal Prize in Mathematics (2002), the Cantor Medal (2002) and the Bolyai Prize (2010). He was a member of nine academies of sciences and an Honorary Member of the London Mathematical Society. He held honorary degrees from Sorbonne and from the Universities of Oslo and Warwick.\n\nHaving addressed International Congresses of Mathematicians four times during the years (the last time in 1990 in Kyoto), he further contributed to the success of the mission of the IMU by serving as the chair of the Fields Medal Committee for ICM 1998 (Berlin) and of the Program Committee for ICM 2002 (Beijing).\n\nYuri Ivanovich Manin has not only greatly advanced our discipline but has touched the lives of so many people. He will be dearly missed by all of us.\n\nMikhail Kapranov\n\nKavli IPMU (WPI), UTIAS\n\nUniversity of Tokyo"
