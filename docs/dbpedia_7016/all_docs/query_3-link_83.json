        "text": "In this essay, we will discuss Caroline Herschel’s life and achievements. Herschel was an amazing woman, not least because of the period in which she worked. Her achievements were many, but we will focus on the difficulties she faced in making them. Advancements in both science and feminism were made due to Herschel. She was also a skilled mathematician. She certainly deserves to be recognized.\n\nMarie Antoinette was born on November 2, 1755, to dominant and controlling Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa. She had a normal childhood, but when she was 12, her mother decided to arrange a marriage with France to solidify the connection between Austria and France. Maria Theresa chose Antoinette for her gentle disposition, (as well as lack of other daughters to offer), and she was sent off to Versailles. Antoinette however, did not lead the life she expected. She suffered through the humiliation not being able to produce children for another seven years, having a feeble husband who, at first, had no interest in romance, and the French Revolution, the event that would lead to her demise.\n\nMarie Antoinette was conceived on November 2, 1755 in the Austrian capital of Vienna. Her folks were Francis the first and Maria Theresa. She was the second to last kid, as her parents went on to have 15 children.. At a youthful age she was shown great ethics, due to her royal upbringing. When the child of Louis XV passed away, his demise permitted the ruler's 11-year-old grandchild to be next to inherited the French honored position. While Marie was just 14 years of age she had already been arragned to marriage. After Louis XV passed,, Louis Aguste, Marie's husband, went to the French position of royalty, making Marie Antoinette the ruler of France.\n\nAmalie Emmy Noether was a great and noble mathematician to be a woman, a Jew, living in the 19th and 20th century. She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl, and Norbert Wiener as one of the greatest women in mathematics history. Amalie Emmy Noether was born in Erlangen, Germany, April 15, 1882. She was born as Amalie Emmy Noether but was known as “Emmy”. Emmy was born to Ida Amalia Kaufmann and Max Noether, and was a Jew living in Germany. When Max Noether, who was Emmy Noether’s father, was 14, he was diagnosed with Polio and was paralyzed from the disease. Which probably affected her childhood. Her father was also a mathematician. She had three brothers, Fritz Noether, Alfred Noether, and Gustav Robert Noether, but Emmy was the oldest.\n\nShe excelled in scientific subjects versus subject such as language and philosophy. In 1966, she completed her baccalauréat degree and was undecided on which subject she would study for her university study medicine or biomedical sciences. Opting to go to the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Paris to obtain her undergraduate degree. The ultimate reasoning for choosing the Natural Science degree was that it was shorter and would be less expensive than a Medical degree. This decision was necessary so she wouldn't burden her family with further unnecessary expenses to support her during her\n\nFrom the past to the present, many famous women have played an important role in enhancing the world’s technological advancements. Not putting into consideration, all the gender stereotypes and discriminatory obstacles that stood in their way, these females displayed an unbreakable will and solid determination. Women have become increasingly notable in many areas, and are held responsible for all the positive changes they have created for our society today. Among these distinguished women, Amelia Earhart is very well-known in our community today. Amelia Earhart is one of the greatest female aviators the world has seen.\n\nIt was an academy founded to \"train mathematicians and scientists for the country\" (Perl 64). Women were not allowed to enroll in the academy, but Sophie was able to obtain the lecture notes for several of the courses and study from them. This gave her the opportunity to learn from many of the prominent mathematicians of the day. Sophie was particularly interested in the teachings of J. L. Lagrange. Under the pseudonym of M. LeBlanc ( a former student of Lagrange's), Sophie submitted a paper on analysis to Lagrange at the end of the term. He was quite impressed with the work and wanted to meet the student who had written it. Lagrange was amazed that the author of the work was actually a female, but he recognized her abilities and became her mentor. With a male to introduce her, Sophie could enter the circle of scientists and mathematicians that she never before could. Up until this point not only had her gender been a hindrance to her, but her social status had been too. It was socially acceptable for aristocratic women to be taught the sciences and mathematics so that they could talk about it casually with friends. Sophie was of the middle class so this opportunity had passed her\n\nHe concludes that Catherine’s mathematical knowledge, despite her lack of formal education, must be due to the fact that she has learned a lot from the years she spent living with her father, and in a way she may have his genius. Yet, Catherine fears she may tread down the path of her father’s eventual madness and dementia. Everything from her coping of loss to her sister Claire’s patronizing attitude causes her to follow logical steps to the seemingly illogical conclusion of her genius coming hand-in-hand with insanity. The abstract process is explored in an analysis of the play: “In life, if not in math, the axiomatic method does not provide a good tool for predicting the future. Personality traits or genes are not axioms pointing to some inescapable conclusion--at best, they're mental ticklers, worriers, and warnings. Nevertheless, we see Catherine trying to prove or disprove to herself that she is doomed to repeat her father's demise” (Rockmore). The central mystery of Catherine’s mental stability is the very reason for the doubt\n\nSophie of Anhalf-Zerbst was born on May 2, 1729 in the Germany city of Stettin (Szczecin, now Poland). She was born of a minor German prince, into a society that legally separated and isolated its female population. Though society was against her she was recognized by her father for her great ability to learn and remember concepts and ideas. After proving her ideas and abilities, she received a formal education. In 1744, at the age of 14, she married the Grand Duke Peter of Holstein who was heir to the Russian throne . Although Sophie was German she strove to be as Russian as her mother in-law. Sophie not only studied the Russian language, but she also took the name of Catherine II to honour her mother who was also named Catherine."
