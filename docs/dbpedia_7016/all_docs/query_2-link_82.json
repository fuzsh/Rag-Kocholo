        "text": "Here are a few books on the history of recent mathematics that I recommend:\n\nA History of Algebraic and Differential Topology, 1900 - 1960 by Jean Dieudonne.\n\nHistory of Topology by I.M. James.\n\nReciprocity Laws: From Euler to Eisenstein by Franz Lemmermeyer.\n\nThe Shaping of Arithmetic after C.F. Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n\nby Catherine Goldstein, Norbert Schappacher, and Joachim Schwermer.\n\nThe Mathematical Coloring Book: Mathematics of Coloring and the Colorful Life of its Creators by Alexander Soifer.\n\nOther examples (just to give an idea of the choice), thematic sample, with scholarly work, popular science, and other types :\n\nRecent theorems\n\nFour Colours Suffice: How the Map Problem Was Solved de Robin J. Wilson\n\nProofs and Confirmations: The Story of the Alternating Sign Matrix Conjecture de David M. Bressoud, William Watkins, Gerald L. Alexanderson, and Dipa Choudhury\n\nKepler's Conjecture: How Some of the Greatest Minds in History Helped Solve One of the Oldest Math Problems in the World de George G. Szpiro\n\n20th century\n\nThe Honors Class: Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers de Benjamin H. Yandell\n\nMathematical Analysis During the 20th Century de Jean-Paul Pier\n\nDevelopment of Mathematics 1900-1950 de Jean-Paul Pier\n\nThe Mathematical Century: The 30 Greatest Problems of the Last 100 Years de Piergiorgio Odifreddi\n\nBiography\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius de Ray Monk\n\nVon Neumann, Morgenstern, and the Creation of Game Theory: From Chess to Social Science, 1900-1960 de Robert J. Leonard\n\nThe Random Walks of George Polya de Gerald L. Alexanderson\n\nLogic's Lost Genius: The Life of Gerhard Gentzen de Eckart Menzler-Trott\n\nAuto biography\n\nIndiscrete Thoughts de Gian-Carlo Rota et Fabrizio Palombi\n\nDiscrete Thoughts: Essays on Mathematics, Science, and Philosophy de M. Kac\n\nA Mathematician Grappling With His Century de Laurent Schwartz = \"Un mathematicien aux prises avec le siecle\" original french title\n\nPhotographs\n\nMathematical People: Profiles and Interviews de Donald J. Albers\n\nSource books\n\n(because it is invaluable to read the original articles)\n\nFrom Frege to Godel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931 de Jean van Heijenoort\n\nYearly compilation\n\nWhat's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences 200x-200x+1 de Barry Cipra\n\nMath and society\n\nThe Rise of Statistical Thinking 1820-1900 de Theodore M. Porter\n\nother\n\nAbrégé d'histoire des mathématiques, 1700-1900\n\n6000 Jahre Mathematik: Eine Kulturgeschichtliche Zeitreise - 2. Von Euler Bis Zur Gegenwart de Hans Wussing\n\nI don't think that there is a shortage of books on \"recent\" history of mathematics - if anything, the growth has been exponential here as well! There are many recent books dealing with more specialized areas written by eminent scholars, e.g.\n\nCharles Curtis, Pioneers of representation theory: Frobenius, Burnside, Schur, and Brauer\n\nArmand Borel, Essays in the history of Lie groups and algebraic groups\n\nThomas Hawkins, Emergence of the theory of Lie groups. An essay in the history of mathematics 1869–1926\n\nand, although this is not a book on history of mathematics as such, the erudite\n\nMarcel Berger, A panoramic view of Riemannian geometry\n\nAmong broader views, I enjoyed reading\n\nPiergiorgio Oddifreddi, The mathematical century. 30 greatest problems of the last 100 years\n\nThe four-color problem, Kepler's conjecture, and the Monster have all been featured in popular mathematics books.\n\nThese have already been mentioned in comments, but I wanted to put them here explicitly:\n\nI Want To Be a Mathematician: An Automathography by Paul Halmos\n\nI Have a Photographic Memory by Paul Halmos\n\nAnd as for photographs, the recent Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World is another good one.\n\nThere's some good historical material in the Princeton Companion to Mathematics as well.\n\nI found the book \"The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept\", by Hans Wussing (I have the Dover reprint) very interesting.\n\nIt covers the development of group theory from its precursors in pre-19th century mathematics, and then traces the development of the concept of an abstract group through to the end of the 19th century. It makes (what seems to me to be) a detailed study of primary sources, and the fact that the author has a good command of the mathematics helps lend credence to his assessment of the various historical trends and developments.\n\nThe degree to which you like this answer is very dependent on the degree to which you find physics even in its own right of interest to mathematicians, but Abraham Pais is a wonderful historian of (relatively) recent physics; I'm most familiar with his biography of Einstein (Subtle is the Lord) and his history of particle physics (Inward Bound), but I understand he has many more books as well.\n\nI thought this book was terrific.\n\nLabyrinth of Thought: A History of Set Theory and Its Role in Modern Mathematics: Jose Ferreiros Dominguez\n\nI'm finding this useful in my research on a philosophy of mathematics dissertation:\n\nTool and object: a history and philosophy of category theory: Ralf Krömer\n\nOthers have mentioned Dieudonne's \"A History of Algebraic and Differential Topology\". As a philosopher (albeit one with some graduate math training) I found it very difficult to follow. Maybe I need to really commit to it, however.\n\nNicolas Bourbaki's Elements of the History of Mathematics covers the history of mathematics, and is a nearly unaltered reproduction of the historical notes from Bourbaki's Elements of Mathematics. The historical notes themselves are a great source for this type of information, and this book collects them in a nice readable format. It is pretty funny the way Bourbaki writes about the contributions of members of the group (from the chapter on uniform spaces: \"Uniform spaces have only been defined in a general way recently by A. Weil...\". He also plays up the importance of filters, in classic Bourbaki style.).\n\nEdit: Fixed.\n\nHistory, biography, and memoir are quite different genres for mathematics. But as long as some of the latter are being recommended, I'd have to add G.H. Hardy's short memoir A Mathematician's Apology. Like most memoirs this falls short of giving a full picture of Hardy's life and work. His life is by now impossible to document anyway, though the somewhat fictionalized account of his years in Cambridge during Ramanujan's visit given recently by David Leavitt in The Indian Clerk is quite readable. Leavitt's mathematics is weak at times, though corrections were made in the softcover reprint. But he has explored the documentary evidence thoroughly, including the detailed biography of Ramanujan by Kanigel (which however has been criticized by some Indian mathematicians for its portrayal of Indian culture and religion).\n\nTwo (very recent) books on (at least selected aspects of) the history of complex (holomorphic) dynamics, in the years >1850:\n\nAudin, Michèle: Fatou, Julia, Montel. The great prize of mathematical sciences of 1918, and beyond. Translated from the 2009 French original by the author. Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 2014. History of Mathematics Subseries. Springer, Heidelberg, 2011. viii+332 pp. ISBN: 978-3-642-17853-5 (the French original is from 2009)\n\nAlexander, Daniel S.; Iavernaro, Felice; Rosa, Alessandro: Early days in complex dynamics. A history of complex dynamics in one variable during 1906–1942. History of Mathematics, 38. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI; London Mathematical Society, London, 2012. xviii+454 pp. ISBN: 978-0-8218-4464-9"
