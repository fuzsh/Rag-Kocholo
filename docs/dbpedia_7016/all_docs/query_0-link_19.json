        "text": "3. Foliations\n\nThurston made his first visit to the Orsay department of mathematics in 1972, the year he obtained his PhD. He was invited by Harold Rosenberg, who was a professor there. Orsay is a small city situated south of Paris, about 40 minutes drive from Porte d’Orléans (which is one of the main south entrances to Paris) with the usual traffic jam. The Orsay department of mathematics was very young; it was created in 1965 as part of a project to decentralize the University of Paris, and in 1971 it had become part of the newly founded Université de Paris-Sud. Thurston was working on foliations and France was, at that time, the world center for this topic. Specifically, the theory was born some two-and-a-half decades earlier in Strasbourg, where a strong group of topologists had formed around Charles Ehresmann, including René Thom, Georges Reeb, André Haefliger and Jean-Louis Koszul. Reeb’s PhD thesis, entitled Propriétés topologiques des variétés feuilletées [38] which he defended in 1948, may safely be considered to be the birth certificate of foliation theory. Reeb described there the first example of a foliation of the 3-sphere, answering positively a question asked by Heinz Hopf in 1935. This question was communicated to Reeb by his mentor, Ehresmann (Reeb mentioned this several times). On the other hand, examples of the use of foliations of surfaces can be traced back to the early works on cartography by Ptolemy and others before him who searched for mappings of the 2-sphere onto a plane where the foliation of the sphere by parallels or by longitudes is sent to foliations of a planar surface satisfying certain a priori conditions (circles, ellipses, straight lines, lines that interpolate between circles near the North Pole and straight lines near the South Pole, etc.)\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s the theory of foliations was a hot research topic among topologists and dynamicists at Orsay. The results that Thurston obtained during his graduate studies and the years immediately following (ca. 1970–1975) constituted a striking and unforeseeable breakthrough in the field. In this period of 4 or 5 years, he solved all the major open problems on foliations, a development which eventually led to the disappearance of the Orsay foliation group.\n\nDuring his 1972 visit, Thurston lectured on his version of the hℎh-principle—as it is now called—for foliations of codimension greater than 1, and in particular on his result saying that an arbitrary field of 2-planes on a manifold of dimension at least four is homotopic to a smooth integrable one, that is, a field tangent to a foliation. Several young researchers interested in foliations attended the lectures, including Robert Roussarie, Robert Moussu, Norbert A’Campo, Michel Herman and Francis Sergeraert.\n\nThe Godbillon-Vey invariant (GV) had been born the year before in Strasbourg, but it was even unknown whether the invariant could be nonzero. Informed of this during a meeting at Oberwolfach which took place on May 23-29, 1971, Roussarie immediately found an example of a foliation with a non-zero GV invariant, namely the horocyclic foliation on a compact quotient of S​L2​(ℝ)𝑆subscript𝐿2ℝSL_{2}(\\mathbb{R}). Shortly after, Thurston proved the much stronger result saying that there exists a family of foliations whose GV take all possible real values. He also gave a geometric interpretation of the GV class of a foliation F𝐹F as a “helical wobble of the leaves of F𝐹F \". The paper was published in 1972 [48]. This was one of the first papers that Thurston published on foliations (in fact, it was his first paper on the subject after his thesis, the latter of which remains unpublished). Thurston sent the preprint of his paper to Milnor. On November 22, 1971, Milnor responded with a 5 page letter. We have reproduced here the first page of that correspondence. Thurston spent the next academic year at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, at the invitation of Milnor. It is interesting to note that the hyperbolic plane already appears in Thurston’s paper as a central object. Orbifolds also appear in the background (Thurston calls them “surfaces having a number of isolated corners, with metrics of constant negative curvature everywhere else\"). Shortly thereafter Sullivan, who was working at IHÉS in Bures-sur-Yvette (a few minutes walk from Orsay), gave another interpretation of the GV invariant using a notion of linking number for currents; this appeared in his 1976 paper Cycles for the dynamical study of foliated manifolds and complex manifolds [44].\n\nDuring his 1972 stay in France, Thurston also visited Dijon, and he then went to Switzerland to participate in a conference on foliations at Plans-sur-Bex, a village in the Alps. A’Campo recalls that at that time, Thurston was already thinking about hyperbolic geometry in dimension two. He asked Thurston how he came to know about this subject, and Thurston’s answer was that his father first told him about it.\n\nThurston’s most remarkable result during the period that followed his Orsay visit is probably the proof of the existence of a C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty} codimension-one foliation on any closed manifold with zero Euler characteristic. The result was published in 1976 [52], and it solved one of the main conjectures in the field. Before that, there were only particular examples of foliations of spheres and some other particular manifolds. Sullivan recalls that the first new foliation of spheres after Reeb’s was constructed by Lawson in Bahia in 1971, and Verjovsky helped in that. Other particular examples of foliations of special manifolds, sometimes restricted to a single dimension, were constructed by A’Campo, Durfee, Novikov and Tamura. On the other hand Haefliger had proved a beautiful and influential result saying that there is no codimension-one real-analytic foliation on a sphere of any dimension [19]. This emphasizes the fact that unlike manifolds, a smooth one-dimensional non-Hausdorff manifold—as is, in general, the space of leaves of a foliation—does not carry any analytic structure. It is interesting to note here that each of Haefliger and Reeb, at a conference in Strasbourg in 1944–1955, presented a paper on non-Hausdorff manifolds considered as quotient spaces of foliations [18, 39].\n\nIn his paper [49] published in 1974, Thurston obtained a generalization of the so-called Reeb stability theorem. This theorem, proved by Reeb twenty-eight years earlier in his thesis [38], says that if a codimension-one foliation of a compact manifold has a two-sided compact leaf with finite fundamental group, then all the leaves of the foliation are diffeomorphic. Thurston showed that in the case of a C1superscript𝐶1C^{1} foliation one can replace the hypothesis that the compact leaf has finite fundamental group by the much weaker one saying that the first real cohomology group of the leaf is zero. He also gave a counterexample in the case where the smoothness condition is not satisfied. As a corollary, he showed that there are many manifolds with boundary that do not admit foliations tangent to the boundary.\n\nAt the same time, Thurston proved in [51] a series of breakthrough results on codimension-k𝑘k Haefliger structures when k>1𝑘1k>1. Such a structure, introduced (without the name) by Haefliger in his thesis [20], is a generalization of a foliation: it is an ℝksuperscriptℝ𝑘\\mathbb{R}^{k}-bundle over an n𝑛n-dimensional manifold equipped with a codimenson-k𝑘k foliation transverse to the fibers of the bundle. (The normal bundle to a foliation is naturally equipped with such a structure.)\n\nTwo years later, Thurston solved the tour de force case of codimension-one: every hyperplane field is homotopic to the tangent plane field of a C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty}-foliation [52]. In the same paper, he writes that “the theory of analytic foliations still has many unanswered questions.\"\n\nThurston gave a talk at the 1974 ICM (Vancouver) whose title is On the construction and classification of foliations. The proceedings of this congress contain a short paper (3 pages) [50] in which he states his major results. The definition he gives of a foliation is unusual, but it delivers the meaning of the object defined better than any formal definition: “A foliation is a manifold made out of a striped fabric—with infinitely thin stripes, having no space between them. The complete stripes, or ‘leaves’, of the foliation are submanifolds; if the leaves have codimension k𝑘k, the foliation is called a codimension-k𝑘k foliation\".\n\nAfter Thurston proved his series of results on foliations, the field stagnated. In his article On proof and progress in mathematics [53] Thurston wrote:\n\nWithin a couple of years, a dramatic evacuation of the field started to take place. I heard from a number of mathematicians that they were giving or receiving advice not to go into foliations—they were saying that Thurston was cleaning it out. People told me (not as a complaint, but as a compliment) that I was killing the field. Graduate students stopped studying foliations.\n\nThurston was never proud of this, and it was not his intention to kill the subject. In the same article he explained that on the contrary he was sorry about the fact that many people abandoned the field and he thought the new situation arose out of a misunderstanding, by a whole group of mathematicians, of the state of the art of foliations. As a matter of fact, in the introduction to his 1976 paper [52] which supposedly killed the field, Thurston declares that further work on the subject is called for, especially using the geometrical methods of his predecessors and unlike his own method which, according to his words, is local and has the disadvantage that it is hard to picture the foliations constructed.\n\nThurston might be pleased to know that some problems on foliations that he was interested in have been revived recently. For instance, G. Meigniez recently revisited Thurston’s ideas and obtained new unexpected results [33]. In particular, he showed that there exist minimal, C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty}, codimension-one foliations on every closed connected manifold of dimension at least 4 whose Euler characteristic is zero. Since by definition every leaf of a minimal foliation is dense, this proves that there is no generalization to higher dimensions of Novikov’s 3-dimensional compact leaf theorem [36] (1965).\n\n6. Holomorphic dynamics\n\nDennis Sullivan was a major promoter of Thurston’s ideas in France, and he was probably the person who best understood their originality and implications. For more than twenty years Sullivan ran a seminar at IHÉS on topology and dynamics. Recurrent themes at that seminar were Kleinian groups (discrete isometry groups of hyperbolic 3-space), a subject whose foundations were essentially set by Poincaré, and holomorphic dynamics, another subject rooted in French mathematics, namely in the works of Fatou and Julia, revived 60 years later, by Adrien Douady and John Hubbard, in the early 1980s, but preceded sometime in the late 1970s by Milnor and Thurston who developed their so-called kneading theory for the family of maps x↦x2+cmaps-to𝑥superscript𝑥2𝑐x\\mapsto x^{2}+c. The topics discussed in Sullivan’s seminar also included the geometry of 3-manifolds, deformations of Kleinian groups and their limit sets, pleated surfaces, positive eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, quasiconformal mappings, and one-dimensional dynamics. Thurston’s ideas were at the forefront, and Sullivan spent years explaining them.\n\nIn 1982, while Sullivan was running his seminar on holomorphic dynamics, Douady gave a course on the same subject at Orsay. At the same time, Sullivan established his dictionary between the iteration theory of rational maps and the dynamics of Kleinian groups.\n\nIn the same year, Sullivan was the first to learn from Thurston about his theorem characterizing postcritically finite rational maps of the sphere, that is, rational maps whose forward orbits of critical points are eventually periodic. The proof of this theorem, like the proofs of several of Thurston’s big theorems, uses a fixed point argument for an action on a Teichmüller space. Specifically, Thurston associated to a self-mapping of the sphere which is postcritically finite a self-map of the Teichmüller space of the sphere with some points deleted (the postcritical set). The rational map in the theorem is then obtained through an iterative process as a fixed point of the map on Teichmüller space.\n\nIn addition to the map on Teichmüller space, the proof of Thurston’s theorem involves hyperbolic geometry, the action of the mapping class group of the punctured sphere on essential closed curves and the notions of invariant laminations. All of these notions form the basis for a beautiful analogy between the ideas and techniques used in the proof of this theorem and those used in the proof of Thurston’s classification of mapping classes of surfaces, and this correspondence is an illustration of the fact that mathematics, for Thurston, was a single unified field.\n\nThurston circulated several versions of a manuscript in which he gave all the ingredients of the proof of his theorem, but the manuscript was never finished. A proof of this theorem following Thurston’s outline was written by Douady and Hubbard. A first version was circulated in preprint form in 1984 and the paper was eventually published in 1993 [11].\n\nThree years later, Sullivan published a paper in which he gave the proof of a long-standing question formulated by Fatou and Julia [46] (1985). The result became known as the No-wandering-domain Theorem. It says that every component of the Fatou set of a rational function is eventually periodic. A fundamental tool that was introduced by Sullivan in his proof is that of quasiconformal mappings, one of the main concepts in classical Teichmüller theory. These mappings became a powerful tool in the theory of iteration of rational maps. It is interesting that Sullivan, in his paper [46], starts by noting that the perturbation of the analytic dynamical system z↦z2maps-to𝑧superscript𝑧2z\\mapsto z^{2} to z↦z2+a​zmaps-to𝑧superscript𝑧2𝑎𝑧z\\mapsto z^{2}+az for small a𝑎a strongly reminds one of Poincaré’s perturbations of Fuchsian groups Γ⊂PSL​(2,ℝ)ΓPSL2ℝ\\Gamma\\subset\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R}) into quasi-Fuchsian groups in PSL​(2,ℂ)PSL2ℂ\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{C}) where the Poincaré limit set changes from a round circle to a non-differentiable Jordan curve, and that Fatou and Julia, the two founders of the theory of iteration of analytic mappings, were well aware of the analogy with Poincaré’s work. He then writes: “We continue this analogy by injecting the modern theory of quasiconformal mappings into the dynamical theory of iteration of complex analytical mappings.\"\n\nThurston’s theorem, together with Sullivan’s dictionary, now constitute the two most fundamental results in the theory of iterations of rational maps.\n\nIn his PhD thesis, defended under Thurston in Princeton in 1985, Silvio Levy obtained several applications of Thurston’s theorem, including a condition for the existence of a mating of two degree-two polynomials that are postcritically finite [30]. The notion of mating of two polynomials of the same degree was introduced in 1982 by Douady and Hubbard. The idea was to search for a rational self-map of the sphere that combines the dynamical behavior of the two polynomials. Levy, in his thesis, formulated the question of mating in a more combinatorial way, and using Thurston’s characterization of rational maps was able to give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a mating of two postcritically finite degree-two polynomials in terms of their associated laminations. This result solved a question formulated in several precise forms by Douady in his Bourbaki seminar [10, Questions 11 and 12]. At the same time, also in his thesis, Levy established connections between Thurston’s geometric approach and Douady-Hubbard’s more analytical approach to the subject of iteration of rational maps. In particular, he established the relation between Thurston’s invariant laminations and the so-called Hubbard trees that were introduced by Douady and Hubbard in the context of degree-two polynomials. Both notions arise from identifications that arise on the boundary of the unit disc when it is sent by a Riemann mapping to the complement (in the Riemann sphere) of the so-called filled Julia set of a polynomial, in the case where this set is connected.\n\nTan Lei’s thesis, which she defended in 1986 at Orsay under the supervision of Douady, is in some sense the French counterpart of Levy’s thesis. It uses Thurston’s theorem in an essential way, but instead of laminations Tan Lei works with Hubbard trees. A criterion that Douady and Hubbard formulated in [10, III. 3] gives a necessary condition for the existence of a rational function realizing the mating two degree-two polynomials. Tan Lei provided sufficient conditions for this to happen, at the same time giving a more precise form of the criterion found by Levy.\n\nIn her paper Branched coverings and cubic Newton maps [29] Tan Lei applies Thurston’s theory of postcritically finite branched coverings of the sphere to a new family of maps. Specifically, she studies the dynamics of a class of degree-3 rational maps that arise in Newton’s method for approximating the roots of a cubic polynomial. She introduces the notion of a postcritically finite cubic Newton map and investigates the question of whether branched coverings of the sphere are equivalent (in the sense of Thurston) to such a map. The problem of understanding and giving precise information about the roots of a complex polynomial is one of those basic mathematical questions which Thurston was always interested in.\n\nIn 2011, about a year and a half before his death, Thurston posted a thread on math overflow concerning the intersection of the convex hull of level sets {z|Q​(z)=w}conditional-set𝑧𝑄𝑧𝑤\\{z|Q(z)=w\\} for a polynomial Q𝑄Q. He writes: “By chance, I’ve discussed this question a bit with Tan Lei; she made some nice movies of how the convex hulls of level sets vary with w𝑤w. (Also, it’s fun to look at their diagrams interactively manipulated in Mathematica). If I get my thoughts organized I’ll post an answer.\" Thurston never had a chance to post the answer.\n\nMotivated by this question, Tan Lei wrote an article with Arnaud Chéritat in the French electronic journal Images des mathématiques dedicated to the popularization of mathematics. In this article, they first present a classical result known as the Gauss–Lucas Theorem, saying that the convex hull of the roots of any polynomial P𝑃P of degree at least one contains the roots of its derivative P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}. Note that the roots of the derivative are the critical points of the original polynomial. Tan Lei and Chéritat present a result of Thurston which gives a complete geometric picture of the situation: Let P𝑃P be a non-constant polynomial. Let F𝐹F be a half-plane bounded by a support line of the convex hull of the roots of the derivative P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} of P𝑃P and not containing this convex hull and let c𝑐c be a root of P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} contained on this support line. Then there is a connected region contained in F𝐹F on which P𝑃P is bijective and whose interior is sent by P𝑃P onto a plane with a slit along a ray starting at P​(c)𝑃𝑐P(c). Tan Lei and Chéritat gave the details of Thurston’s proof that avoids computations, and they provided the computer movies that Thurston talked about in his post. Their article constitutes a tribute to Bill Thurston; it was published less than 3 months after his death. A more detailed version, including two more authors, Yan Gao and Yafei Ou, was later published in the Comptes Rendus [8].\n\nOver the years, Douady’s courses on holomorphic dynamics at Orsay were attended by a number of students and also by more senior mathematicians, including John Hubbard, Pierette Sentenac, Marguerite Flexor, Tan Lei, Pierre Lavaurs, Jean Ecalle, Sébastien Godillon, Arnaud Chéritat, Ricardo Pérez-Marco, Xavier Buff, and Jean-Christophe Yoccoz. Tan Lei, in her tribute to Thurston in [15], writes that he never stopped thinking about iterations of rational maps. She gives a lively description of her conversations and email exchanges with him on this subject in 2011 and 2012, the last two years of his short life.\n\nIn the realm of conformal geometry, Thurston introduced the subject of discrete conformal mappings, and in particular the idea of discrete Riemann mappings. In 1987, Sullivan, together with Burton Rodin, proved an important conjecture of Thurston on approximating a Riemann mapping using circle packings [47]. Colin de Verdière, motivated by Thurston’s work, proved the first variational principle for circle packings [9].\n\n20. Pierre Arnoux\n\nI started as a mathematics graduate student at Orsay at 1979, by following the lectures of Michael Shub on dynamical systems. , This was two years after the seminar on Thurston’s work on surfaces. At that time at Orsay, one was immersed, without even realising it, in a particular mathematical culture. I became quickly aware of the classification of surface automorphisms, foliations etc., even if I was far from understanding the proofs.\n\nMichel Herman suggested me to work on interval exchange maps for my PhD. thesis. I always thought of them geometrically, associated with surface foliations. At that time, very few explicit examples of surface automorphisms were known; most of them were related to coverings of automorphisms of the torus. We came across a paper by William Veech in which he started the parametrization of holomorphic forms (hence, particular strata of the cotangent bundle of Teichmüller space) using interval exchange maps; that gave a way of building self-similar foliations. I remember a night trip back from England (possibly Durham) with Jean-Christophe Yoccoz and Albert Fathi during which they built such an example with a cubic coefficient (I was rather a spectator than anything else). This was the first example of a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism which does not arise from a torus automorphism. This was also the kind of things that I enjoyed: to build explicit and concrete, yet slightly strange objects. Twenty years later, Maki Furukado, a Japanese mathematician, gave me a model of this foliated surface constructed by sewing rectangles of striped material; this is not a trivial thing to do, because the singularities of the foliation impose heavy constraints. But you can easily see why the suspension has to be on a surface of genus 2.\n\nA few years later, around 1984, I came across a paper by Gérard Rauzy in which he had built a self-similar fractal set associated with a substitution whose similarity coefficient is the same as the one of the pseudo-Anosov example. I thought that this was more than a coincidence. By using the symbolic models associated with the two systems, I was able to show that the interval exchange which had made possible this example was measurably conjugate to a rotation of the 2-torus by a continuous map 𝕋1→𝕋2→superscript𝕋1superscript𝕋2\\mathbb{T}^{1}\\to\\mathbb{T}^{2} whose image is a Peano curve filling the 2-torus. It followed easily that, by taking suspensions, the pseudo-Anosov at hand was measurably conjugate by a continuous map to a hyperbolic automorphism of the 3-dimensional torus 𝕋3superscript𝕋3\\mathbb{T}^{3}.\n\nIn Orsay, people were also familiar with the work of Adler and Weiss yielding an explicit Markov partition of the hyperbolic automorphisms of 𝕋2superscript𝕋2\\mathbb{T}^{2} and showing that these automorphisms are classified up to measurable conjugacy by their largest eigenvalue (their logarithm is the topological entropy, as well as the measure theoretic entropy for the Lebesgue measure). We also knew that any hyperbolic automorphisms of 𝕋nsuperscript𝕋𝑛\\mathbb{T}^{n} has a Markov partition. But, these partitions are not at all trivial; for instance, it follows from a very short paper by Rufus Bowen that for n>2𝑛2n>2 their boundary is a fractal set. It is indeed difficult to exhibit explicit examples of Markov partitions, except in the case of surface automorphisms, where they are made of explicit rectangles. The particular example we had found, by giving a measurable conjugacy between an automorphism of a surface with an explicit Markov partition and a toric automorphism, showed an explicit partition, with fractal boundary of known dimension, for the toral automorphism.\n\nIn this theory, there is a basic example easy to understand, that is, 𝕋2superscript𝕋2\\mathbb{T}^{2} with its Teichmüller space which is the hyperbolic plane, and its moduli space, which is the classical modular surface equipped with its geodesic flow. There are two simple ways for generalizing that case: taking higher dimensional tori, or taking surfaces of higher genus. Sometimes, one has the feeling that the two ways are but the same: a hyperbolic automorphism of the n𝑛n-dimensional torus 𝕋nsuperscript𝕋𝑛\\mathbb{T}^{n} can be often unfolded to an automorphism of a surface of the corresponding genus, a little like these kirigami, Japanese paper flowers which unfold when you put them in water.\n\nNow I would like to talk about the period 1992–2019 spent in Luminy-Marseille.\n\nI was more and more attracted by the arithmetic and combinatoric constructions of Rauzy and I went to work in the laboratory he had founded in Luminy. But I was still interested in the geometric side of these constructions. Thurston had also written a paper, not published but available as a xeroxed preprint, about tiles associated with algebraic numbers; this was parallel to what we were doing with substitutions.\n\nIn Luminy, we worked on symbolic sequences with low (sublinear) complexity, in particular the Sturmian sequences which appear in many different settings: dynamics of rotations on the circle, Farey sequences, dynamics of continuous fractions, and more curiously, dynamics of the Mandelbrot set. Here, the basic lemma, attributed to Thurston, states the following: an orbit of the map x↦2​x​mod​ 1maps-to𝑥2𝑥mod1x\\mapsto 2x\\ {\\rm mod}\\ 1 is cyclically ordered if and only if its binary encoding is Sturmian. In all the papers I have worked on since, there is the influence of the geometry I learnt at Orsay at that time, mixed with the discrete mathematics and the number theory which was the mark of Rauzy.\n\nIn Marseille, there was another group of mathematicians who were studying outer automorphisms of free groups. They included Arnaud Hilion and Martin Lustig, collaborating with Gilbert Levitt who was in Caen. Outer automorphisms of free groups have a lot of analogies with mapping class groups of surfaces. The substitutions that we studied in Luminy were simpler cases of these automorphisms, in the same manner as matrices with positive coefficients are simpler than general matrices (Perron-Frobenius). The two groups started to collaborate.\n\nIn the articles that I write or read today, I continue to feel what happened at Orsay around 1976, with Thurston, Douady, and Hubbard (who is now regularly in Marseille): tiles associated with automorphisms of free groups, generalized Teichmüller spaces, explicit conjugations between bifurcations for families of continuous fractions or for families of quadratic polynomials, etc.\n\n21. Albert Fathi\n\nBill Thurston’s impact on French topologists is certainly one of the best influences on the group.\n\nI first heard of Bill when I started my Graduate Studies in 1971. At that time he was already a legend for his work on foliations.\n\nI think I first met Bill at the CIME school on Differential Topology in 1976 at Varenna. Thurston was, along with André Haefliger and John Mather, one of the three people delivering the courses. It is unfortunate that he never delivered the manuscript of his lectures for publication. My most vivid impression of this meeting was the private explanation by André Haefliger on Thurston’s beautiful geometric argument on how to obtain that the (connected component of the) diffeomorphism group of a compact manifold is perfect from the case of the n-dimensional torus that was previously done by Michel Herman. This was an Aha! moment: how a deep insight in geometry can circumvent the impossible adaptation to general manifolds of Herman’s work on the torus. It used KAM methods and hard implicit function theorems in neighborhoods of irrational translations on the torus.\n\nThe work of Bill on diffeomorphisms of surfaces led to the monograph that we edited with François Laudenbach and Valentin Poénaru.\n\nIt was Valentin Poénaru who drew us to this subject. He came one day from IHÉS with a set of hand-written notes that Mike Handel produced while listening to Bill’s course in Princeton. He convinced François and myself to run a seminar on the subject. This seminar took place in 1976-77 in Université Paris-Sud (Orsay).\n\nThe group of diffeomorphisms of a surface up to isotopy is called the mapping class group (of the surface). Bill’s work essentially produced a “best” representative in each element of the mapping class group.\n\nValentin Poénaru gave us the Grand Tour on the subject in the first lectures of the seminar. I started to work almost everyday with François to be able to understand the details. It took us a couple of years to produce a usable manuscript. We benefited from advice of Francis Sergeraert who served as a referee. At this time, Bill used measured foliations rather than measured laminations which appeared after most of our manuscript was finished. This is why measured laminations are not in the monograph. Anyway, I find it very rewarding that 30 years later, it was still found useful to have an English version of our monograph. The mathematical world is smaller than we think it is: one of the two editors of the English version is Dan Margalit who now is my colleague at Georgia Tech.\n\nBill’s work was a revolution in the old subject of classification up to isotopy of surface diffeomorphisms. Before him, there was a remarkable work of Nielsen in the 1930s which pointed out the elements of finite order of the mapping class group. However, nobody really realized the existence and irreducibility of what Bill called pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms. Of course, the fact that Anosov diffeomorphisms were, by that time, extensively studied, in particular, through the properties of the stable and unstable foliations, is certainly what motivated Bill to introduce these pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms. Obviously, Nielsen could not have benefited from such a knowledge. What was also remarkable in Bill’s approach was that he also made strong connections with objects, besides pseudo-Anosov maps, that were subjects of intensive research in Dynamical Systems like interval exchange and entropy. For me, who was turning from Topology to Dynamical Systems, it was another Aha! moment.\n\nBill’s main tool is of course the compactification of Teichmüller space by the projectified space of measured foliations, yielding a space homeomorphic to a ball, on which the mapping class group acts naturally. Therefore by Brouwer’s fixed point theorem, each element has a fixed point in this compactification. The underlying geometrical nature of the fixed point gives the classification.\n\nThe Orsay seminar on Thurston’s work was very lively. The number of attendants was large. Jean-Christophe Yoccoz who was just starting graduate school told me that he attended it (I do not remember that, I really did not meet him till the end of that academic year) and it left on him a lasting impression.\n\nOne of the main challenges during the lectures was the discussions with complex analysts who had a compactification of Teichmüller space as a Euclidean ball by quadratic differentials. The discussions were driven by the belief that these two compactifications were the same. It was a surprise when, sometime during the year, we learned that Steve Kerckhoff, then a PhD student of Bill, showed that the two compactifications were distinct. Of course, both compactifications are nowadays important, and they can be used to prove the classification of elements in the mapping class group.\n\nAfter that, the lamination point of view pervaded the subject. It was quite remarkable that Bill Thurston and Mike Handel were able to show using laminations that the ideas of Nielsen that dated back to the 1930’s potentially contained the classification of elements of the mapping class group. At that time, I was already getting back to dynamics problems and lost track of the subject.\n\nTwenty years later laminations (not necessarily geodesic) came back to haunt me. There is hardly a day in my mathematical life without thinking about laminations.\n\nIn fact, about 1982, John Mather and Serge Aubry established the now so-called Aubry-Mather theory for twist maps of the annulus. Although not usually expressed that way, the Aubry-Mather set (or rather its suspension) is a lamination (not geodesic). When Mather generalized these results to higher dimensions in the setting of Lagrangian systems, the connection became much clearer. Aubry-Mather sets are foliated by 1-dimensional trajectories. They are therefore laminations. Mather’s graph theorem is in fact a proof that these laminations are Lipschitz (the speed of the trajectory is a Lipschitz function of the point). This is a crucial property for geodesic laminations in dimension two, which follows in that case from a simple (hyperbolic) planar argument.\n\nIn 1996, I discovered (like Weinan E and Craig Evans-Diogo Gomes) the relation between the Aubry-Mather theory and the viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The fact that I knew the lamination theory set up by Bill was definitely instrumental going deeper in this relationship that keeps me still mathematically busy today.\n\nI do not mention the work of Bill on Poincaré’s conjecture and on holomorphic dynamics both of which had immense influence on several French mathematicians. I personally had not been involved in these parts.\n\nIn the Fall of 1986, Université Paris-Sud (Orsay) gave a Doctorat Honoris Causa to both Bill Thurston and Don Knuth. At that time a plane ticket was a physical piece of paper that you actually needed to have to take the plane. Of course, the University President’s staff bought an expensive ticket and they were worried to send it by (regular mail): UPS, Fedex etc. with their overnight delivery were not operating in France or at least not thought of. Anyway, I was planning to spend the 1986-87 academic year at IAS in Princeton, so one day Jean Cerf came to my office and asked me to deliver the ticket to Bill as soon as I would arrive, and to ask Bill to notify by fax the staff of the University Presidency that the plane ticket has been delivered. It was very stressful: I seem to remember that the price of the ticket was more than my monthly salary. I arrived in Princeton late in the afternoon, hardly slept that night, first thing next day I ran to Fine Hall, found Bill, delivered the ticket and followed him to the secretary’s office to make sure that the fax was sent. I felt much better afterwards.\n\nI would like to end by mentioning New College in Sarasota (Florida) where Bill did his undergraduate studies (John Smillie was also an undergraduate there). I think that the informal and congenial atmosphere at this wonderful institution was instrumental in Bill’s mathematical formation. The (apocryphal?) story I heard is that Bill spent four years at New College essentially reading Fricke and Klein’s book (in German!). I discovered New College during my years at the University of Florida. After I returned to France to work at ENS Lyon, I visited several times New College trying (unsuccessfully) to attract some of the students to do their graduate studies in France. I was hoping that French mathematics would return to the next Bill Thurston, at least a small part of what Bill gave us.\n\n24. Dennis Sullivan\n\n(A Decade of Thurston Stories)\n\nFirst story. In December of 1971, a dynamics seminar ended at Berkeley with the solution to a thorny problem in the plane which had a nice application in dynamics. The solution purported to move N𝑁N distinct points to a second set of “epsilon near\" N𝑁N distinct points by a motion which kept the points distinct and only moved while staying always “epsilon prime near\". The senior dynamicists in the front row were upbeat because the dynamics application up to then had only been possible in dimensions at least three where this matching problem is obvious by general position. But now the dynamics theorem also worked in dimension two.\n\nA heavily bearded long haired graduate student in the back of the room stood up and said he thought the algorithm of the proof didn’t work. He went shyly to the blackboard and drew two configurations of about seven points each and started applying to these the method of the end of the lecture. Little paths started emerging and getting in the way of other emerging paths which to avoid collision had to get longer and longer. The algorithm didn’t work at all for this quite involved diagrammatic reason. I had never seen such comprehension and creative construction of a counterexample done so quickly. This combined with my awe at the sheer complexity of the geometry that emerged.\n\nSecond story. A couple of days later the grad students invited me (I was also heavily bearded with long hair) to paint math frescoes on the corridor wall separating their offices from the elevator foyer. While milling around before painting that same grad student came up to ask “Do you think this is interesting to paint?\" It was a complicated smooth one-dimensional object encircling three points in the plane. I asked “What is it?\" and was astonished to hear “It is a simple closed curve.\" I said “You bet it’s interesting!\". So we proceeded to spend several hours painting this curve on the wall. It was a great learning and bonding experience. For such a curve to look good it has to be drawn in sections of short parallel slightly curved strands (like the flow boxes of a foliation) which are subsequently smoothly spliced together. When I asked how he got such curves, he said by successively applying to a given simple curve a pair of Dehn twists along intersecting curves. The “wall curve painting\", two meters high and four meters wide dated and signed, lasted on that Berkeley wall with periodic restoration for almost four decades before finally being painted over a few years ago (see Figure 7).\n\nThird story. That week in December 1971 I was visiting Berkeley from MIT to give a series of lectures on differential forms and the homotopy theory of manifolds. Since foliations and differential forms were appearing everywhere, I thought to use the one-forms that emerged in my story describing the lower central series of the fundamental group to construct foliations. Leaves of these foliations would cover graphs of maps of the manifold to the nilmanifolds associated to all the higher nilpotent quotients of the fundamental group. These would generalize Abel’s map to the torus associated with the first homology torus. Being uninitiated in Lie theory I had asked all the differential geometers at MIT and Harvard about this possibility but couldn’t make myself understood. It was too vague/too algebraic. I presented the discussion in my first lecture at Berkeley and to Bill privately without much hope because of the weird algebra/geometry mixture. However the next day Bill came with a complete solution and a full explanation. For him it was elementary and really only involved actually understanding the basic geometric meaning of the Jacobi relation in the Elie Cartan d∘d=0𝑑𝑑0d\\circ d=0 dual form.\n\nIn between the times of the first two stories above I had spoken to my old friend Mo Hirsch about Bill Thurston who was working with Mo and was finishing in his fifth year after an apparently slow start. Mo or someone else told how Bill’s oral exam was a slight problem because when asked for an example of the universal cover of a space Bill chose the surface of genus two and started drawing awkward octogons with many [eight] coming together at each vertex. This exposition quickly became an unconvincing mess on the blackboard. I think Bill was the only one in the room who had thought about this nontrivial kind of universal cover. Mo then said “Lately, Bill has started solving thesis level problems at the rate of about one every month.” Some years later I heard from Bill that his first child Nathaniel didn’t like to sleep at night so Bill was sleep deprived “walking the floor with Nathaniel” for about a year of grad school.\n\nThat week of math at Berkeley was life changing for me. I was very grateful to be able to seriously appreciate the Mozart-like phenomenon I had been observing; and I had a new friend.\n\nUpon returning to MIT after the week in Berkeley I related my news to the colleagues there, but I think my enthusiasm was too intense to be believed: “I have just met the best graduate student I have ever seen or ever expect to see.\" It was arranged for Bill to give a talk at MIT which evolved into a plan for him to come to MIT after going first to IAS in Princeton. It turned out he did come to MIT for just one year 1973-74.\n\nFourth story, IAS Princeton 1972–73. When I visited the environs of Princeton from MIT in 72-73 I had a chance to interact more with Bill. One day walking outside towards lunch at IAS, I asked Bill what a horocyle was. He said “you stay here\" and he started walking away into the Institute meadow.\n\nAfter some distance he turned and stood still saying “You are on the circumference of a circle with me as center.\" Then he turned, walked much further away, turned back and said something which I couldn’t hear because of the distance. After shouting back and forth to the amusement of the members we realized he was saying the same thing “You are on the circumference of a circle with me as center\". Then he walked even further away, just a small figure in the distance and certainly out of hearing, whereupon he turned and started shouting presumably the same thing again and again. We got the idea what a horocycle was.\n\nThe next day, Atiyah asked some of us topologists if we knew if flat vector bundles had a classifying space. (He had constructed some new characteristic classes for such.) We knew it existed from Brown’s theorem but didn’t know how to construct it explicitly. The next day, Atiyah said he asked Thurston this question who did it by what was then a shocking construction: take the Lie structure group of the vector bundle as an abstract group with the discrete topology and form its classifying space.\n\nLater, I heard about Thurston drawing Jack Milnor a picture proving any dynamical pattern for any unimodal map appears in the quadratic family x↦x2+cmaps-to𝑥superscript𝑥2𝑐x\\mapsto x^{2}+c. Since I was studying dynamics, I planned to spend a semester with Bill at Princeton to learn about the celebrated Milnor–Thurston universality paper that resulted from this drawing.\n\nFifth story, Princeton University fall 1976. I expected to learn about one-dimensional dynamics upon arriving in Princeton in September 1976, but Thurston had already developed a new theory of surface transformations. The first few days, he expounded on this in a wonderful three hour extemporaneous lecture at the Institute. Luckily for me, the main theorem about limiting foliations was intuitively clear because of the painstaking Berkeley wall curve painting described above.\n\nAt the end of that semester Bill told me he believed the mapping torus of these carried hyperbolic metrics. When I asked why, he told me he couldn’t explain it to me because I didn’t understand enough differential geometry.\n\nA few weeks after, I left Princeton, with more time to work and without my distractions. Bill essentially understood the proof of the hyperbolic metric for appropriate Haken manifolds. The mapping torus case took two more years as discussed below. During the semester grad course that Bill gave, the grad students and I learned several key ideas:\n\n1) The quasi-analogue of “hyperbolic geometry at infinity becomes conformal geometry on the sphere at infinity\".\" (A notable memory here is the feeling that Bill conveyed about really being inside hyperbolic space rather than being outside and looking at a particular model. For me this made a psychological difference.)\n\n2) We learned about the intrinsic geometry of convex surfaces outside the extreme points: Bill came into class one day, and, for many minutes, he rolled a paper contraption he had made around and around in the lecturer’s table without saying a word until we felt the flatness.\n\n3) We learned about the thick-thin decomposition of hyperbolic surfaces. I remember how Bill drew a 50 meter long thin part winding all around the blackboard near the common room, and suddenly everything was clear. Including geometric convergence to the points of the celebrated DM compactification of the space of Riemann surfaces.\n\nDuring that fall ’76 semester stay at Princeton, Bill and I discussed understanding the Poincaré conjecture by trying to prove a general theorem about all closed three manifolds based on the idea that three is a relatively small dimension. We included in our little paper on “canonical coordinates\" the sufficient for Poincaré Conjecture possibility that all closed three manifolds carried conformally flat coordinate atlases. However, an undergrad, Bill Goldman, who was often around, disproved this a few years later for the nilmanifold prime. We decided to try to spend a year together in the future.\n\nMeeting in the Alps, spring 1978. In the next period Bill developed limits of quasi-Fuchsian Kleinian groups and pursued the mapping torus hyperbolic structure in Princeton while I pursued the Ahlfors limit set measure problem in Paris. After about a year Bill had made substantial positive progress (e.g., closing the cusp) and I had made substantial negative progress (showing all known ergodic methods coupled with all known Kleinian group information were inadequate: there was too much potential nonlinearity). We met in the Swiss Alps at the Plans-sur-Bex conference and compared notes. His mapping torus program was positively finished but very complicated while my negative information actually revealed a rigidity result extending Mostow’s, which allowed a simplification of Bill’s proof.\n\nSixth story, The Stony Brook meeting summer 1978. There was a big conference on Kleinian Groups at Stony Brook and Bill was in attendance but not as a speaker. Gromov and I got him to give a lengthy impromptu talk outside the schedule. It was a wonderful trip out into the end of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, combined with convex hulls, pleated surfaces and ending laminations …During the lecture Gromov leaned over and said watching Bill made him feel like “this field hadn’t officially started yet.\"\n\nSeventh story, Colorado June 1980 to August 1981. Bill and I shared the Stanislaw Ulam visiting chair at Boulder and ran two seminars, a big one drawing together all the threads for the full hyperbolic theorem and a smaller one on the dynamics of Kleinian groups and dynamics in general.\n\nAll aspects of the hyperbolic proof passed in review with many grad students in attendance.\n\nOne day in the other seminar Bill was late and Dan Rudolph was very energetically explaining in just one hour a new shorter version of an extremely complicated proof. The theorem promoted an orbit equivalence to a conjugacy between two ergodic transformations if the discrepancy of the orbit equivalence was controlled. The new proof was due to a subset of the triumvirate Katznelson, Weiss and Ornstein and was notable because it could be explained in one hour whereas the first proof took a mini-course to explain. Thurston at last came in and asked me to bring him up to speed, which I did. The lecture continued to the end with Bill wondering in loud whispers what the difficulty was and with me shushing him out of respect for the context. Finally, at the end, Bill said just imagine a bi-infinite string of beads on a wire with finitely many missing spaces and just slide them all to the left say. Up to some standard bookkeeping this gave a new proof. Later that day an awestruck Dan Rudolph said to me he never realized before then just how smart Bill Thurston really was.\n\nEighth story, La Jolla and Paris end of summer 1981. The Colorado experience was very good, relaxing in the Thurston seminar with geometry (one day we worked out the eight geometries and another day we voted on terminology “manifolded\" or “orbifold\") and writing several papers of my own on Hausdorff dimension, dynamics and measures on dynamical limit sets.\n\nLater closer to Labor day I was flying from Paris to La Jolla to give a series of AMS lectures on the dynamics stuff when I changed the plan and decided instead to try to expose the entire Hyperbolic Theorem “for the greater good\" and as a self imposed Colorado final exam. I managed to come up with a one-page sketch while on the plane. There were to be two lectures a day for four or five days. The first day would be okay, I thought: just survey things and then try to improvise for the rest, but I needed a stroke of luck. It came big time.\n\nThere is a nine hour time difference between California and Paris and the first day I awoke around midnight local time and went to my assigned office to prepare. After a few hours I had generated many questions and fewer answers about the hyperbolic argument. I noticed a phone on the desk that miraculously allowed long distance calls and by then it was around 4:00 a.m. California time and 7:00 a.m. in Princeton. I called Bill’s house, and he answered. I posed my questions. He gave quick responses, I took notes, and he said call back after he dropped kids at school and got to his office. I gave my objections to his answers around 9:30 a.m. his time and he responded more fully. We ended up with various alternate routes that all in all covered every point. By 8:00 a.m. my time I had a pair of lectures prepared. The first day went well: lecture/lunch/beach/swim, second lecture, dinner then goodby to colleagues and back to bed. This took some discipline but as viewers of the videos will see the audience was formidable (Ahlfors, Bott, Chern, Kirby, Siebenmann, Edwards, Rosenberg, Freedman, Yau, Maskit, Kra, Keen, Dodziuk,…) and I was motivated.\n\nBill and I repeated this each day, perfecting the back and forth so that by 8:00 a.m. California time each day, I had my two lectures prepared and they were getting the job done. The climax came when presenting Bill’s delicious argument that controls the length of a geodesic representing the branching locus of a branched pleated surface by the dynamical rate of chaos or entropy created by the geodesic flow on the intrinsic surface. One knows that this is controlled by the area growth of the universal cover of the branched surface which by negative curvature is controlled by the volume growth of the containing hyperbolic three space QED. There was in addition Bill’s beautiful example showing the estimate was qualitatively sharp. This splendid level of lecturing was too much for Harold Rosenberg, my astute friend from Paris, who was in the audience. He came to me afterwards and asked frustratingly “Dennis, do you keep Thurston locked up in your office upstairs?” The lectures were taped by Michael Freedman and I have kept my lips sealed until now. The taped (Thurston)-Sullivan lectures are available online.\n\nNinth story, Thurston in Paris fall 1981. Bill visited me in Paris and I bought a comfy sofa bed for my home office where he could sleep. He politely asked what would I have talked about had I not changed plans for the AMS lectures, and in particular what had I been doing in detail in Colorado beyond the hyperbolic seminar. There were about six papers to tell him about. One of the most appealing ideas I had learned from him. Namely the visual Hausdorff f𝑓f-dimensional measure of an appropriate set on the sphere at infinity, as viewed from a point inside, defines a positive eigenfunction for the hyperbolic 3-space Laplacian with eigenvalue f​(2−f)𝑓2𝑓f(2-f).\n\nI started going through the ideas and statements. I made a statement and he either immediately gave the proof or I gave the idea of my proof. We went through all the theorems in the six papers in one session with either him or me giving the proof. There was one missing result that the bottom eigenfunction when f𝑓f was >1absent1>1 would be represented by a normalized eigenfunction whose square integral norm was estimated by the volume of the convex core. Bill lay back for a moment on his sofa bed, his eyes closed, and immediately proved the missing theorem. He produced the estimate by diffusing geodesics transversally and averaging.\n\nThen we went out to walk through Paris from Porte d’Orléans to Porte de Clignancourt. Of course we spoke so much about mathematics that Paris was essentially forgotten, except maybe the simultaneous view of Notre-Dame and the Conciergerie as we crossed over the Seine.\n\nTenth story, Princeton-Manhattan 1982-83. I began splitting time between IHES and the CUNY grad center where I started a thirteen year long Einstein chair seminar on dynamics and quasiconformal homeomorphisms (which changed then to quantum objects in topology) while Bill continued developing a cadre of young geometers to spread the beautiful ideas of negatively curved space. Bill delayed writing a definitive text on the hyperbolic proof in lieu of letting things develop along many opening avenues by his increasingly informed cadre of younger/older geometers. He wanted to avoid what happened when his basic papers on foliations “tsunamied\" the field in the early 1970s.\n\nOnce we planned to meet in Manhattan to discuss holomorphic dynamics in one variable and its analogies with hyperbolic geometry and Kleinian groups that I had been preoccupied with. We were not disciplined and began talking about other things at the apartment, and finally got around to our agenda about thirty minutes before he had to leave for his train back to Princeton. I sketched the general analogy: Poincaré limit set, domain of discontinuity, deformations, rigidity, classification, Ahlfors finiteness theorem, the work of Ahlfors–Bers,…to be compared with Julia set, Fatou set, deformations, rigidity, classification, non-wandering domain theorem, the work of Douady–Hubbard,…which he perfectly and quickly absorbed until he had to leave for the train. Two weeks later we heard about his reformulation of a holomorphic dynamical system as a fixed point on Teichmüller space analogous to part of his hyperbolic theorem. There were many new results including those of Curt McMullen some years later and the subject of holomorphic dynamics was raised to another higher level.\n\nPostscript. Thurston and I met again at Milnor’s 80th fest at Banff after essentially thirty years and picked up where we had left off. I admired his checked green shirt the second time it appeared and he presented it to me the next day. We promised to try to attack together a remaining big hole in the Kleinian group/holomorphic dynamics dictionary: “the invariant line field conjecture\". It was a good idea but unfortunately turned out to be impossible. At the same conference, I recall a comment whispered by Bill who sat next to me during a talk by Jeremy Kahn about the Kahn–Markovich proof of the Subsurface Conjecture from decades before. Bill whispered : “I missed the ‘offset’ step.\"\n\nAcknowledgements.
