        "text": "Richard Stanley has been awarded an undergraduate research prize and four major prizes which we list below giving information about each.\n\nClick on a link below to go to that award\n\nEric Temple Bell Undergraduate Mathematics Research Prize\n\nSIAM George PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics (1975)\n\nLeroy P Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (2001)\n\nRolf Schock Prize in Mathematics (2003)\n\nLeroy P Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2022)\n\n1. Eric Temple Bell Undergraduate Mathematics Research Prize.\n\n1.1. The Eric Temple Bell Undergraduate Prize.\n\nIn 1963 the Department of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology established the Eric Temple Bell Undergraduate Mathematics Research Prize to honour the memory of Professor Eric Temple Bell and his illustrious career as a research mathematician, teacher, author, and scholar. It is awarded to one or more juniors or seniors for the best original research paper in mathematics. When submitting a paper, students should specify a faculty member who can attest to the quality of the work. The awards committee may award duplicate prizes in case of more than one outstanding entry.\n\n1.2. The 1965 Bell Prize.\n\nThe 1965 Eric Temple Bell Undergraduate Mathematics Research Prize was awarded to both Michael Ashbacher andÂ Richard P Stanley for outstanding entries. Stanley submitted the paper Zero Square Rings specifying Richard Albert Dean (1924-2022) as a faculty member who could attest to its quality. The paper was published in the Pacific Journal of Mathematics 30 (3) (1969), 811-824. It was the note:\n\nReceived September 9, 1968. This paper was written for the 1965 Bell prize at the California Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Professor Richard A Dean.\n\n1.3. Abstract of Richard P Stanley's Zero Square Rings.\n\nA ring RRR for which x2=0x^{2} = 0x2=0 for all xâRx \\in RxâR is called a zero square ring. Zero-square rings are easily seen to be locally nilpotent. This leads to two problems: (1) constructing finitely generated zero-square rings with large index of nilpotence, and (2) investigating the structure of finitely generated zero square rings with given index of nilpotence. For the first problem we construct a class of zero-square rings, called free zero-square rings, whose index of nilpotence can be arbitrarily large. We show that every zero-square ring whose generators have (additive) orders dividing the orders of the generators of some free zero-square ring is a homomorphic image of the free ring. For the second problem, we assume Rnâ 0R^{n} â 0Rnî â=0 and obtain conditions on the additive group R+R_{+}R+â of RRR (and thus also on the order of RRR). When n=2n = 2n=2, we completely characterise R+R_{+}R+â. When n>3n > 3n>3 we obtain the smallest possible number of generators of R+R_{+}R+â, and the smallest number of generators of order 2 in a minimal set of generators. We also determine the possible orders of RRR.\n\n2. SIAM George PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics (1975).\n\n2.1. George PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics.\n\nThe George PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics, originally established in 1969, is awarded by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) every four years for a notable application of combinatorial theory. The prize is broadly intended to recognise specific work. The award may occasionally be made for cumulative work, but such awards should be rare.\n\nThe prize committee will consist of a panel of five SIAM members appointed by the president. One of the members will be designated by the president as chair.\n\nThe recipient of the George PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics shall receive an engraved medal, a cash award, and reasonable expenses for travel to the award ceremony from the prize fund. The amount of the award is $10,000.\n\nIn the exceptional case of multiple winners, the prize money will be shared and reasonable travel expenses for one recipient to attend the award ceremony will be provided.\n\n2.2. Stanley wins George PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics.\n\nRichard Stanley writes in Enumerative and Algebraic Combinatorics in the\n\n1960's and 1970's:-\n\nThe first prize to be established in combinatorics was the George PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics, awarded by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). The recipients prior to 1980 were Ronald Graham, Klaus Leeb, Bruce Rothschild, Alfred Hales, and Robert Jewett in 1971, Richard Stanley, Endre SzemerÃ©di, and Richard Wilson in 1975, and LÃ¡szlÃ³ LovÃ¡sz in 1979. The 1975 prize was awarded in San Francisco, so as a bonus Richard Wilson and I (SzemerÃ©di was not present) were invited by PÃ³lya, then aged 87, to visit his home in Palo Alto. We spent an unforgettable evening being shown by PÃ³lya his scrapbooks and other memorabilia.\n\n3. Leroy P Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (2001).\n\n3.1. 2001 Steele Prize.\n\nThe 2001 Leroy P Steele Prizes were awarded at the 107th Annual Meeting of the AMS in January 2001 in New Orleans.\n\nThe Steele Prizes were established in 1970 in honour of George David Birkhoff, William Fogg Osgood, and William Caspar Graustein and are endowed under the terms of a bequest from Leroy P Steele. The prizes are awarded in three categories: for expository writing, for a research paper of fundamental and lasting importance, and for cumulative influence extending over a career. The current award is $4,000 in each category (in case of multiple recipients, the amount is divided equally).\n\nThe recipients of the 2001 Steele Prizes are Richard P Stanley for Mathematical Exposition ...\n\nThe Steele Prizes are awarded by the AMS Council acting through a selection committee whose members at the time of these selections were: Constantine M Dafermos, Bertram Kostant, Hugh L Montgomery, Marc A Rieffel, Jonathan M Rosenberg, Barry Simon, FranÃ§ois Treves (chair), S R S Varadhan, and Herbert S Wilf.\n\n3.2. AMS Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition: Press Release.\n\nRichard P Stanley, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has won the 2001 Leroy P Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition. Presented by the American Mathematical Society, the Steele Prize is one of the highest distinctions in mathematics. The prize will be awarded today (11 January 2001) at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in New Orleans.\n\nProfessor Stanley is being honoured for his two-volume work Enumerative Combinatorics (volume 1 published by Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole in 1986, and volume 2 published by Cambridge University Press in 1999). The citation for the prize says that the field of enumerative combinatorics \"has been expanding and evolving very rapidly, and it is quite remarkable that Stanley has been able to take a still photograph of it, so to speak, that beautifully captures its subject.\"\n\n3.3. Leroy P Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition: Richard P Stanley. Citation.\n\nThe Leroy P Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition is awarded to Richard P Stanley of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in recognition of the completion of his two-volume work Enumerative Combinatorics. The first volume appeared in 1986, and, to quote the review of Volume 2 by Ira Gessel, \"since then, its readers have eagerly awaited Volume 2. They will not be disappointed. Volume 2 not only lives up to the high standards set by Volume 1, but surpasses them. The text gives an excellent account of the basic topics of enumerative combinatorics not covered in Volume 1, and the exercises cover an enormous amount of additional material.\"\n\nThe field has been expanding and evolving very rapidly, and it is quite remarkable that Stanley has been able to take a still photograph of it, so to speak, that beautifully captures its subject. To appreciate the scholarly qualities of this work, one need look no further than the exercises. There are roughly 250 exercises in each volume, all graded according to difficulty, many being multipart, and all with solutions and/or references to the relevant literature being provided. There are more than 500 bibliographic citations in the two volumes.\n\nThe first volume begins with elementary counting methods, such as the sieve method, and works through the theory of partially ordered sets, ending with a beautiful treatment of rational generating functions. Volume 2 begins with an advanced, yet very clear, view of generating functions, with special attention to algebraic and D-finite ones, and concludes with a comprehensive discussion of symmetric functions.\n\nYet even with all of the information that is being transmitted, we never lose clarity or our view of \"the big picture\". As a small example, we note that the Catalan numbers seem ubiquitous in combinatorics. Every student of the subject is struck by the large number of questions that they answer and wonders if there are bijections between the various families of objects that are counted by these numbers. In a single exercise (ex. 6.19) Stanley has collected 66 such questions and asks the reader to provide the proofs which, in each case, establish the Catalan answer. All 66 of them are worked out in the solution, which is ten pages long, and this is just one of the 500 or so exercises. The author even has time for an occasional smile-generator (e.g., ex. 6.24: \"Explain the following sequence: un, dos, tres, quatre, cine, sis,....\" The solution tells us that they are the Catalan numbers.)\n\nThis is a masterful work of scholarship which is, at the same time, eminently readable and teachable. It will be the standard work in the field for years to come.\n\n3.4. Richard P Stanley: Biographical Sketch.\n\nRichard Stanley was born in New York City in 1944. He graduated from Savannah High School in 1962 and Caltech in 1966. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1971 under the direction of Gian-Carlo Rota. He was a Moore Instructor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology during 1970-71 and a Miller Research Fellow at Berkeley during 1971-73. He then returned to MIT, where he is now a professor of applied mathematics. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1975 he was awarded the PÃ³lya Prize in Applied Combinatorics from the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. His main mathematical interest is combinatorics, especially its connections with such other branches of mathematics as commutative algebra and representation theory.\n\n3.5. Richard P Stanley: Response.\n\nI have been interested in expository writing since graduate school and have long admired such masters as Donald Knuth, George PÃ³lya, and Jean-Pierre Serre. I think it is wonderful that the AMS awards a prize for mathematical exposition, and I am extremely pleased at having been chosen for this award. It is not just an award for me but for all of combinatorics, for which such recognition would have been unthinkable when I was starting out in the subject. I only regret that it is not possible for me to share the celebration of my prize with Gian-Carlo Rota, who inspired me throughout my career and who wrote the two forewords to Enumerative Combinatorics.\n\n4. Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics (2003).\n\n4.1. The Rolf Schock Prize.\n\nRolf Schock, who died in 1986, specified in his will that half of his estate should be used to fund four prizes in the fields of logic and philosophy, mathematics, the visual arts and the musical arts.\n\nThe fortune is managed by the Schock Foundation, which decides on the prizes on the basis of proposals from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (logic and philosophy and mathematics), the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (visual arts) and the Royal Swedish Academy of Music (musical arts).\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences appoint prize committees in logic and philosophy and mathematics that send out nomination invitations and then review the nominated candidates. It is not possible to nominate without an invitation from the committee, or to nominate yourself.\n\n4.2. The 2003 Rolf Schock Prizes\n\nThe Rolf Schock Prizes for 2003 amounting to SEK 1.6 million are awarded to the logician Solomon Feferman, USA, to the mathematician Richard P. Stanley, USA, to the artist Susan Rothenberg, USA and to the mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter, Sweden. The Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics is awarded to Richard P Stanley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA:-\n\n... for his fundamental contributions to combinatorics and its relationship to algebra and geometry, in particular for his important contributions to the theory of convex polytopes and his innovative work on enumerative combinatorics..\n\n4.3. Richard Stanley Receives the Schock Prize.\n\nFour Rolf Schock Prizes for 2003 have been awarded, two of them to mathematicians: Solomon Feferman and Richard P Stanley.\n\nThe versatile philosopher and artist Rolf Schock (1933-1986) describes in his will a prize to be awarded in such widely differing subjects as logic and philosophy, mathematics, the visual arts, and music. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Music have awarded these prizes every other year since 1993. Each prize carries a monetary award of SEK 400,000 (about US$51,400).\n\nRichard P Stanley\n\nThe Schock Prize in Mathematics was awarded to Richard P Stanley of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology:-\n\n... for his fundamental contributions to combinatorics and its relationship to algebra and geometry, in particular for his important contributions to the theory of convex polytopes and his innovative work on enumerative combinatorics.\n\nRichard P Stanley has made many pioneering contributions to combinatorics. In addition, he has forcefully and with great originality contributed to the discovery of new connections between combinatorics and other areas of mathematics, to great mutual benefit.\n\nAmong his most significant results are his contributions to the study of convex polytopes, the bodies that in higher dimensions correspond to three-dimensional polyhedra (such as cubes and pyramids), especially his proof of necessity in the characterisation of fff-vectors of simplicial polytopes via algebraic geometry (toric varieties). Furthermore, he has produced first-rate work prompted by enumerative problems, which he often solves in unexpected ways using techniques primarily from commutative algebra, algebraic and convex geometry, and representation theory. His ideas have not only influenced and altered combinatorics profoundly and permanently; they have also stimulated research in the other areas mentioned.\n\nStanley's scientific production is marked by clarity, breadth, substance, and originality. The methods he has introduced are innovative and have led to decisive progress in many areas of mathematics. He has also spent much effort in writing graduate-level textbooks that have rapidly set the norm.\n\nRichard P Stanley was born in New York in 1944. He studied at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University, where he received his doctorate in 1971. Since 1979 he has been professor of applied mathematics at MIT. He has been a visiting professor at a number of universities in the United States and France, and also at Stockholm University and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.\n\nMathematicians who have previously received the Schock Prize are: Elliott H Lieb (2001), Yuri Manin (1999), Dana S Scott (1997), Mikio Sato (1997), Andrew Wiles (1995), and Elias M Stein (1993).\n\n5.
