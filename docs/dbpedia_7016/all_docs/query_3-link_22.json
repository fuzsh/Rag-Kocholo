On December 16th, join Jean Shin (2004 Workspace Resident) and Saya Woolfalk (2012 Workspace Resident) in a conversation moderated by Re'al Christian (Writer & Curator) about the Workspace Residency Program at Dieu Donné.\n\nSince its inception, the Workspace Program has attracted a collection of artists who resist easy categorization—thematically, stylistically, and representationally different, our residents' individual practices reveal the broad range of possibilities inherent in hand papermaking. Throughout this conversation series, we will look back on the history of the residency and its artists, while reflecting on the theme of collaboration in a socially distant world.\n\nThis online event will take place on Wednesday, December 16th from 2 PM—3 PM EST. This conversation will last approximately 40 minutes, followed by questions. To attend, register via this Eventbrite Portal, as space is limited.\n\nPast Inside the Workspace conversations can be viewed here, with closed captioning available.\n\nThis program is pay-as-you-wish, with a suggested minimum donation of $5.00. After registering, attendees will automatically receive a registration confirmation from Eventbrite and a direct email from Zoom with the webinar link and password to join the program.\n\nAbout the Artists:\n\nJean Shin is nationally recognized for her monumental installations that transform everyday objects into elegant expressions of identity and community.
