        "text": "One-on-one collaboration with master technician was the most rewarding... Loved the process and concept of papermaking from its origin in fiber to its endless possibilities as an end product. It gave me new ideas for other sculptural projects that I want to explore, and was my first time working in paper but hopefully not my last. Great to have the Armory show open right after I finished my residency and to be able to exhibit the finished pieces. —Jean Shin, 2004\n\nKnown for her labor-intensive sculptural work of discharged objects, Jean Shin’s work is both retinal and conceptual. Her accumulations underscore a connection between craft and industry. Her elaborate displays of castaway objects connect us to everyday life because they are both individualistic and universal. By placing artistic meaning onto seemingly everyday objects, the viewer is offered a contemplative space that is both meaningful and mesmerizing.\n\nIn her series created at Dieu Donné, the flesh-colored paper alludes to the body, while the zippers make reference to elements of clothing; the individual and universal. The forms suggest the body in a state of flux, constantly shifting or mutating. The flat sheets of handmade paper can be zipped up, altering the shape of the piece and creating a three-dimensional form.\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nJean Shin (b. 1971, Seoul, S. Korea) received a BFA in Painting and MS in Art History and Criticism from Pratt Institute. She currently lives and works in New York.\n\nHer work has been widely exhibited in major national and international museums, including in solo exhibitions at the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art in Arizona (2010), Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC (2009), the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia (2006), and Projects at The Museum of Modern Art in New York (2004). She has received numerous awards, including the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships in Architecture/Environmental Structures (2008) and Sculpture (2003), Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant, and Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Biennial Art Award.\n\nFor more information, please visit their website: http://www.jeanshin.com/\n\nAdditional Links"
