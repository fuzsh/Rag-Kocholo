Bernard says he was slammed violently against his car, handcuffed and placed in the police car, as his stunned clients and several observers looked on.\n\n“They used extreme and unjustified force,” Bernard said in a complaint filed with Quebec’s police ethics commission, adding that his wrists and torso were sore.\n\n“I repeatedly asked them why I was being arrested and they kept saying: ‘You will find out,’” he said. “I was sitting in the police car confused and worried.”\n\nAfter searching his wallet, police went and spoke to Bernard’s two customers, he recalled.\n\nWhen Bernard told the officers he was going to contest his unlawful arrest, one of them replied that his customers had agreed to testify against him in court. The two customers cancelled their ride and told Uber their driver had been arrested.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAfter hearing about the arrest, Uber blocked Bernard’s account for several days pending a review. He has since been reinstated.\n\nBefore releasing Bernard, the officers gave him tickets totalling $1,700 for ignoring a police order, parking at an angle and not having his Uber sticker in the window. Bernard, who is a part-time student, is contesting the tickets in court.\n\n“It’s not normal that they would treat me this way,” Bernard said, adding that the encounter has left him feeling anxious and fearful of police officers.\n\nMontreal police don’t comment on complaints filed with the police ethics commissioner, a spokesperson said on Monday.\n\nLast fall, a report mandated by the city of Montreal showed that black and Indigenous people in Montreal were four times more likely to be subject to street checks by police than white people were. Arab people were two times more likely.\n\nMontreal police chief Sylvain Caron acknowledged the presence of “systemic or organizational bias” within the force, but maintained that Montreal did not have “any racist police officers.”\n\nRacial profiling incidents occur frequently in Montreal because of a lack of training and a lack of supervision of officers on the ground, said Fo Niemi, director of the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations.\n\n“There is a lack of leadership (on the force) and questions about the selection of candidates who join the SPVM,” Niemi said. “We see the same complaints year after year despite promises to change.”\n\nkwilton@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
