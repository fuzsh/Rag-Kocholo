With resilience and national pride, she witnessed a defining era, with Winston Churchill and Queen Elizabeth at the helm.\n\nIn 1952, marriage led Rebecca across the Atlantic, as she and Richard Bailey began a new adventure in Toronto, Canada. Their journey continued in 1965 to Walled Lake, Michigan, and later to Lapeer, where they raised their three children, Nicholas, Vanessa, and Fiona.\n\nShe was a lovely, proper, polite woman who preferred to live with a flourish of bold colors; pinks, purples, and dark reds! Rebecca was a wonderful watercolor painter, cook, decorator, and actress.\n\nRebecca volunteered for Hospice for many years and was active in her church, singing for funerals, cleaning the altar, and visiting elderly parishioners who were no longer able to attend mass. She was a long-term, devoted member of St. John Parish, in Davison Michigan, and lived out her final years there.\n\nToward the end of her days, she especially liked to go out for breakfast, but most of all, it was the coffee she loved. We will miss hearing her usual sweet greeting of “Hello dear.”\n\nRebecca Bailey is survived by her children, Nicholas Bailey, born in 1957, and his wife Kerry Bailey, Vanessa Bailey, born in 1961 and Fiona Bailey, born in 1965. Rebecca is also survived by four grandsons; Wynton Doty, Benjamin Bailey, Gus Doty, and Finian Bailey Garriott, and was predeceased by her husband, Richard Bailey, and her grandson, Samuel Bailey Welch.\n\nDavid Gerard Livingston\n\nDecember 3, 1955 – July 14, 2024\n\nDavid Livingston, 68, of Lapeer, was born and raised in Detroit, to the late Ronald and Alice (Rouhan) Livingston. He was one of eight children, 6 boys and 2 girls. The Livingston birthdays, holidays, and get- togethers were always fun-filled adventures. Dave’s father was a former police officer with the Detroit Police Department. His parents were devout Catholics who instilled a strong spiritual faith within their children. Dave carried his faith with him into every aspect of his life, and it helped to form and develop him to meet the challenges he would later face. The excitement, challenges, and love of police work that Dave’s father shared with his children inspired many of the boys to later pursue careers in law enforcement. Dave developed an interest in both education and law enforcement/criminal justice. He would eventually obtain degrees in both fields. Dave enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served his country with honor. During his stint in the U.S.M.C. he received training and became a military policeman.\n\nAfter his discharge, Dave still considered careers in either the educational field or law enforcement. He pursued several possibilities and in 1980 he was hired by the Troy Police Department as a Police Officer. During his 31 years with the Troy Police Department, Dave worked many assignments, received many awards and recognition, and was promoted first to Sergeant and then, to Lieutenant. Dave fully embraced every aspect of police work. He loved his job and he never hesitated in trying to have a positive impact on those individuals who he came into contact with. He became a friend, mentor, and inspiration to others. David never missed an opportunity to spread joy with others.\n\nDuring his childhood, Dave was influenced by many of the popular television shows of the time: Adam-12, Dragnet, Hogans Heroes, Get Smart, The Three Stooges, etc. Dave could recite many of the punch lines, verbatim, from some of the more popular episodes. Dave didn’t hesitate to share those punch lines or his sense of humor with any of his friends, family, or co-workers. Whether through a prank or witty joke (later known as “Crowisms”), he was always making people laugh.\n\nIn 2011, Dave was diagnosed with melanoma. He made the difficult decision to retire from Troy PD so as to focus his attention on his health. Although his health concerns would remain with him, his love and yearning for police work motivated him to pursue another career as a police officer with Mott Community College. Once again, his dedication, work ethic, and commitment enabled him to rise through the ranks; first to Sergeant, and then to Lieutenant. Eventually, he was assigned to manage the Law Enforcement Regional Training Academy (LERTA). His position provided him an opportunity to share the wisdom he gained through the many experiences of his law enforcement career, with those young officers just starting their careers. It also provided him with the opportunity to pursue both of the careers he was interested in as a young man; law enforcement and education.\n\nDavid was always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. He offered to assist any friend or neighbor with a project. Dave made a point of being available for his friends even if it required a personal sacrifice. When he was sick, Dave would still shovel snow from a neighbor’s driveway without being asked. David would drop anything for a friend in need.\n\nDave’s greatest love was spending time with his family. He cherished those moments spent with his wife Marsha, and their children; Jacob, Joanna, and Matthew. He shared his love and pride in his family with those who were close to him. He will be missed by many.\n\nGALLAGHER, Michael F. “Mike” – of Bonita Springs, FL, formerly of Davison, MI, age 72, passed away on Saturday, July 6, 2024 at his residence. Cremation has taken place.
