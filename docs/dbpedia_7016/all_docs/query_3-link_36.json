        "text": "The African Tobacco Control Alliance (ATCA) is proud to announce the winners of the 2024 edition of the Africa Tobacco Control Media Awards. This annual competition aims to encourage journalists across the continent to produce impactful and informative media works on tobacco control.\n\nThe Africa Tobacco Control Media Awards recognize the best media productions that expose the tactics of multinational tobacco companies aimed at undermining the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The submitted productions must have been created between January and October 2023 and must meet several stringent criteria, including the ability to create impact, journalistic and technical quality, and originality.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the three winners for 2024, each demonstrating journalistic excellence and a remarkable commitment to tobacco control:\n\nThese journalists have been awarded for their dedication to revealing the truth about the tobacco industry and for their efforts to raise public awareness about the dangers of tobacco. Their work perfectly illustrates the importance of media coverage in promoting public health and combating the harmful practices of the tobacco industry.\n\nATCA warmly congratulates Ms. Lumbiwe Mwanza, Mr. Dyson Bubala, and Mr. Sawadogo Jean Arnaud for their remarkable contributions. Their commitment and journalistic excellence are essential for protecting public health and educating the population about the dangers of tobacco.\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\n\ncommunication@atca-africa.org"
