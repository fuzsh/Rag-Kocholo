The Cumans were a nomadic Turkish people who settled in Hungary in the mid thirteenth century. Elizabeth, whose mother is not known, was born c.1240. She married Stephen V in 1247 (or perhaps 1254*); he ascended to the throne in 1270 and died in 1272. Elizabeth died after 1290. They had four daughters, including Catherine and Elizabeth who both became queen of Serbia, Maria who married Charles II, king of Naples, Anna, who married the eventual emperor of Byzantium, and two sons, Ladislaus IV, and Andrew.
