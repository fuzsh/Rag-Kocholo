        "text": "Jean I (November 15 – 20, 1316), called the Posthumous was King of France and Navarre, as the posthumous son and successor of King Louis X of France and Navarre for the five days he lived in 1316. The infant King’s mother was Clementia of Anjou and Hungary, the daughter of Charles Martel of Anjou, the titular King of Hungary, and Duchess Clemence of Austria.\n\nClementina of Anjou’s father, Charles Martel (1271 – 1295) of the Capetian dynasty was the eldest son of King Charles II of Naples and Princess Mary of Hungary, the daughter of King Stephen V of Hungary and his wife Elizabeth the Cuman.\n\nClementina’s mother, Clemence of Austria (1262 – ca.1293, or 1295) was a daughter of King Rudolph I of the Romans/Germany, Duke of Austria and Gertrude of Hohenberg. She was a member of the House of Habsburg.\n\nBoth of Clementina’s parents died during her early childhood, and Princess Mary of Hungary, her grandmother, raised her. The family claimed the Crown Hungary through Mary, and although Clementia was born a cadet member of the French Royal House of Capét and grew up in Naples; she was considered a Hungarian Princess.\n\nKing Jean I of France and Navarre is the youngest person to be King of France, and the only one to have been King from birth, and the only one to hold the title for his entire life. His reign is the shortest of any undisputed French king.\n\nAlthough he is considered a King today, his status was not recognized until chroniclers and historians in later centuries began numbering the Kings of France and they numbered Prince Jean de Valois of France, as King Jean II of France, thereby acknowledging Jean I’s brief reign. King Alfonso XIII of Spain is the only other European monarch to be born a King from birth.\n\nJean reigned for five days under the regency of his uncle, Prince Philippe the Tall, Count of Poitou, until his death on November 20, 1316. His death ended the three centuries of father-to-son succession to the French throne. The infant king was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis.\n\nKing Jean I was succeeded by his uncle, the Count of Poitou, as King Philippe V of France, whose succession led to the re-affirmation of the Salic law, which excluded women from the line of succession to the French throne.\n\nConsequences\n\nThe child mortality rate was very high in medieval Europe and King Jean may have died from any number of causes, but rumours of poisoning spread immediately after his death (including one which said that he had been murdered with a pin by his aunt), as many people benefited from it, and as John’s father had also died in strange circumstances. The cause of his death is still not known today.\n\nThe premature death of King Jean I brought the first issue of succession of the Capetian Dynasty. When Louis X, his father, died without a son to succeed him, it was the first time since Hugh Capét that the succession from father to son of the Kings of France was interrupted.\n\nIt was then decided to wait until his pregnant widow, Clementia of Hungary, delivered the child. The king’s brother, Philip the Tall, was in charge of the regency of the kingdom against his uncle Charles de Valois, Count of La Marche.\n\nThe birth of a male child was expected to give France its king. The problem of succession returned when Jean died five days after birth. Philippe the Tall ascended the throne at the expense of Jean’s four-year-old half-sister, Joan, daughter of King Louis X and Margaret of Burgundy.\n\nThere were a couple of reasons Joan was passed over for the French throne. First, Joan’s paternity was dubious because her mother was involved in a scandal, but King Louis X declared her his legitimate daughter before he died in 1316.\n\nEarly in 1314, Margaret of Burgundy was caught in an alleged act of adultery in the Tour de Nesle affair. Her sister-in-law Isabella of France was a witness against her, and Margaret was imprisoned at Château Gaillard along with her sister-in-law Blanche of Burgundy.\n\nSecondly, the French Lords were opposed to the idea of a female monarch and therefore elected Louis X’s brother, Prince Philippe the Tall, Count of Poitou, as King Philippe V of France instead.\n\nLadislaus IV (August 5, 1262 – July 10, 1290) also known as Ladislas the Cuman, was king of Hungary and Croatia from 1272 to 1290.\n\nLadislaus was the elder son of Stephen V, son of Béla IV of Hungary, and Stephen’s wife Elizabeth the Cuman, (1244-1290) was the daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans who had settled in Hungary. She was born as a pagan and was baptized before her marriage to Stephen. She was regent of Hungary during the minority of her son from 1272 to 1277.\n\nThe Cumans were the western tribes of the Cuman-Kipchak confederation. Her people followed a shamanist religion and were considered pagans by contemporary Christians of Europe.\n\nIn 1238, Khan Köten, her father according to historians, led the Cumans and a number of other clans in invading the Kingdom of Hungary while fleeing from the advancing hordes of the Mongol Empire. In time, King Béla IV of Hungary negotiated an alliance with Köten and his people, granting them asylum in exchange for their conversion to Roman Catholicism and loyalty to the King. The agreement was sealed with the betrothal of Elizabeth.\n\nAt the age of seven, Ladislaus married Elisabeth (or Isabella) of Sicily, a daughter of King Charles I of Sicily his first wife Beatrice of Provence. Charles I (early 1226/1227 – 1285), commonly called Charles of Anjou, was youngest son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile and was a member of the royal Capetian dynasty and the founder of the second House of Anjou. He was Count of Provence (1246–85) and Forcalquier in the Holy Roman Empire (1246–48, 1256–85), Count of Anjou and Maine (1246–85) in France. Charles of Anjou was also King of Sicily (1266–85) and Prince of Achaea (1278–85). In 1272, he was proclaimed King of Albania; and in 1277 he purchased a claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nConflicts between Ladislaus’s father (Stephen V) and grandfather (Béla IV) developed into a civil war in 1264. Béla IV’s troops, which were under the command of Ladislaus’s aunt, Anna, captured the castle of Sárospatak, where Ladislaus and his mother were staying and imprisoned him.\n\nBéla IV died on May 3, 1270, and Ladislaus’s father was crowned King Stephen V of Hungary and Croatia two weeks later; the new monarch, however, could not stabilize his rule. Béla IV’s closest advisors — Duchess Anna, and Béla IV’s former palatine, Henry Kőszegi — left Hungary and sought assistance from Anna’s son-in-law, King Ottokar II of Bohemia.\n\nThe newly appointed Ban of Slavonia, Joachim Gutkeled, also turned against Stephen V and kidnapped Ladislaus in the summer of 1272. Gutkeled held Ladislaus in captivity in the fortress of Koprivnica in Slavonia. Historian Pál Engel suggests that Joachim Gutkeled planned to force Stephen V to divide Hungary with Ladislaus. Stephen V besieged Koprivnica, but could not take it.\n\nLadislaus was still a prisoner when his father Stephen V fell seriously ill anddied on August 6, 1272. The young boy became King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and Croatia. Archbishop Philip of Esztergom crowned Ladislaus king in Székesfehérvár on about September 3. In theory, the 10-year-old Ladislaus ruled under his mother’s regency, but in fact, baronial parties administered the kingdom. In November of that year, Henry Kőszegi returned from Bohemia and assassinated Ladislaus’s cousin, Béla of Macsó. Duke Béla’s extensive domains, which were located along the southern borders, were divided among Henry Kőszegi and his supporters.\n\nDuring his minority, many groupings of barons — primarily the Abas, Csáks, Kőszegis, and Gutkeleds — fought against each other for supreme power. Ladislaus was declared to be of age at an assembly of the prelates, barons, noblemen, and Cumans in 1277. He allied himself with Rudolf I, King of Germany against King Ottokar II of Bohemia. His forces had a preeminent role in Rudolf’s victory over Ottokar in the Battle on the Marchfeld on August 26, 1278.\n\nHowever, Ladislaus could not restore royal power in Hungary. A papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus consolidate his authority, but the prelate was shocked at the presence of thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary.\n\nPhilip, bishop of Fermo, extracted a ceremonious promise from the Cuman chieftains of giving up their pagan customs, and persuaded the young King Ladislaus to swear an oath to enforce the keeping of the Cuman chieftains’ promise. An assembly held at Tétény passed laws which, in accordance with the legate’s demand, prescribed that the Cumans should leave their tents and live “in houses attached to the ground”.\n\nThe Cumans did not obey the laws, however, and Ladislaus, himself a half-Cuman, failed to force them. In retaliation, Bishop Philip excommunicated him and placed Hungary under interdict in October. Ladislaus joined the Cumans and appealed to the Holy See, but the Pope refused to absolve him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate’s partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans to submit to the legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary.\n\nLadislaus spent most of his marriage to Elisabeth chasing after the Cumans, encouraging them to come and live in Hungary. Ladislaus clearly preferred the society of the semi-heathen Cumans to that of the Christians; he wore, and made his court wear, Cuman dress; surrounded himself with Cuman concubines, and neglected and ill-used his ill-favoured Neapolitan consort.\n\nHungary also survived a Mongol invasion in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular that many of his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary.\n\nIn September 1286, After the Mongol invasion, Ladislaus had his wife Elisabeth arrested in so that he could live openly with his Cuman mistress. Ladislaus granted her all of Elizabeth’s revenues and had Elizabeth imprisoned on Margaret Island, where she stayed for the next three years.\n\nThe barons captured Ladislaus in the Szepesség in January 1288. Although his partisans soon liberated him, he acquiesced in concluding an agreement with Archbishop Lodomer. The archbishop absolved Ladislaus on condition that the king would live in accordance with Christian morals.\n\nArchbishop Lodomer liberated Queen Elizabeth and Ladislaus was finally reconciled with Elisabeth in 1289. When he found he did not have enough power to rule over his barons, he rejoined the Cumans…and his mistress.\n\nThe archbishop summoned the prelates, the barons, and the noblemen to an assembly in Buda and excommunicated Ladislaus. In response, the infuriated king stated that “beginning with the archbishop of Esztergom and his suffragans, I shall exterminate the whole lot right up to Rome with the aid of Tartar swords”, according to Archbishop Lodomer.\n\nLadislaus abducted his sister, Elizabeth, prioress of the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits’ Island, and gave her in marriage to a Czech aristocrat, Zavis of Falkenstein. According to Archbishop Lodomer, Ladislaus even stated, “If I had 15 or more sisters in as many cloistered communities as you like, I would snatch them from there to marry them off licitly or illicitly; in order to procure through them a kin-group who will support me by all their power in the fulfillment of my will”.\n\nLadislaus spent the last years of his life wandering from place to place. Hungary’s central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of King Ladislaus who was merelya figurehead at that time. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did not intervene, although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.\n\nThe Kőszegis offered the crown to the Árpád prince, Andrew the Venetian, who arrived in Hungary in early 1290. One of their opponents, Arnold Hahót, captured the pretender, however, and surrendered him to Duke Albert. Ladislaus appointed Mizse, who had recently converted from Islam to Christianity, palatine.\n\nPope Nicholas IV was even planning to proclaim a crusade against Ladislaus. However, ironically, Ladislaus, who had always been partial towards his Cuman subjects as we have seen, was assassinated by three Cumans, named Árbóc, Törtel, and Kemence, at the castle of Körösszeg (now Cheresig in Romania) on July 10, 1290.\n\nMizse and the Cuman Nicholas, who was the brother of Ladislaus’s Cuman lover, took vengeance for Ladislaus’s death, slaughtering the murderers.\n\nUpon Pope Nicholas IV’s orders, an inquiry was carried out to find out “whether the king died as a Catholic Christian”. The results of the investigation are unknown, but the Chronicon Budense writes that Ladislaus was buried in the cathedral of Csanád (now Cenad in Romania). His successor, Andrew III the Venetian, and Pope Benedict VIII recalled Ladislaus as “of renowned memory”.\n\nHere is a little information about his successor, Andrew III the Venetian. Andrew was the son of Stephen the Posthumous, the self-styled Duke of Slavonia, and his second wife, Tomasina Morosini, the daughter of wealthy Venetian patrician Michele Morosini.\n\nAndrew’s father was born to Beatrice D’Este, the third wife of King Andrew II of Hungary, but after the king’s death. However, Andrew II’s two elder sons, King Béla IV of Hungary and Coloman of Halych, accused Beatrice D’Este of adultery and refused to acknowledge Stephen the Posthumous as their legitimate brother.\n\nBeing the last male member of the House of Árpád, Andrew was elected King of Hungary and Croatia after the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew’s maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.\n\nJust as during the reign of Ladislaus IV, Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew III’s reign."
