She was a daughter of Stephen V of Hungary and his wife Elizabeth the Cuman.\n\nFamily\n\nMary's mother followed the Shamanist religion, like other Cumans. She was considered a Pagan by contemporary Christians of Europe and Elizabeth had to convert to Catholicism in order to marry Maria's father, Stephen.\n\nMary was the second of six children. Her sisters, Elizabeth and Catherine both became Queen of Serbia. Another sister, Anna married Andronikos II Palaiologos. Mary's only brother was Ladislaus IV of Hungary.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Béla IV of Hungary and his wife Maria Laskarina. Her maternal grandparents were Köten[citation needed], leader of a tribe of Cumans and Mstislawna [of Halicz ?], a Russian noblewoman, who may have royal connections.\n\nLife\n\nIn 1270, when Mary was only twelve years of age, she married the future Charles II of Naples [1] (1254–1309), the eldest son and heir of Charles I of Sicily and his wife Beatrice of Provence.\n\nOn the 10 July 1290, Mary's brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary died childless. The question now was who would succeed him: he had four sisters, three of them outlived him, all four had married powerful rulers and all four had had their own children. On the 21 September 1290, Mary claimed the throne of Hungary. She was up against her two sisters, Catherine and Elisabeth, and their children, plus the children of her younger sister Anna. Mary was crowned queen by a Papal legate in Naples 1291, but transferred her rights to her eldest son, Charles Martel of Anjou.[2] The Pope confirmed her sole rights in Hungary on the 30 August 1295. However, Catherine's son, Stephen Vladislav II of Syrmia, was still a dangerous rival for Maria and Charles Martel. In the end, Charles Martel gave his cousin Slavonia as a compromise.\n\nCharles Martel was only titular King of Hungary, it was Mary's grandson who became King, Charles I of Hungary. Ultimately the claims of the sisters Mary and Catherine were united in a common descendant when the pair's great-great-granddaughter, Mary of Hungary, ascended to the Hungarian throne in 1382. When the line of Charles Martel and the Angevins in Hungary died out, it was Sigismund, a remote descendant of Bela IV, whose family succeeded.\n\nDuring 1290, Mary's sister Elisabeth fled from Bohemia with her son because her husband had lost favour and was executed, Mary allowed Elisabeth and her son to stay in Naples with her, before she became a nun, but escaped and remarried to Stephen Uroš II Milutin of Serbia (brother of Catherine's husband) Elizabeth's stay in Naples is documented during July 1300.[3]\n\nMary's husband died in August 1309, Maria was now a widow. She lived in Naples for the rest of her life, where she died on 25 March 1323, she was buried in Naples at the Santa Maria Donna Regina.\n\nChildren\n\nMary and her husband, Charles had fourteen children:\n\nCharles Martel of Anjou (1271–1295), titular King of Hungary\n\nSaint Louis of Toulouse (February 9, 1275, Nocera – August 19, 1298, Chateau de Brignoles), Bishop of Toulouse\n\nRobert I of Naples, (1277–1343)King of Naples\n\nPhilip I of Taranto, (1278–1331)Prince of Achaea and Taranto, Despot of Romania, Lord of Durazzo, titular Emperor of Constantinople\n\nRaymond Berengar (1281–1307), Count of Provence, Prince of Piedmont and Andria\n\nJohn (1283 – aft.

Tu dal za manželku Karlovi Kulhavému, synovi Karla Velikého... “ — Dubnická kronika[2]\n\nKarel se stal po otcově smrti roku 1285 neapolským králem, sicilská koruna připadla již roku 1282 po krvavém povstání aragonskému králi Petrovi III. Roku 1300 je doložena na neapolském královském dvoře Mariina sestra Alžběta, vdova po Falkenštejnovi, nevlastním otci českého krále Václava.\n\nZ Mariina manželství s Karlem se narodilo čtrnáct dětí a téměř všechny se dožily dospělosti. Svého manžela přežila o mnoho let, je pohřbena v kostele Santa Maria Donna Regina v Neapoli.
