        "text": "It’s the 1060s, and William of Normandy is establishing a new and brutal regime in England, but there are those who would defy him. As Norman soldiers spread like a plague across the land, resistance builds, but will it be enough to topple William and restore the rightful king to his throne? The English have the courage to fight, but the Normans, already victorious at Hastings, now build castles seeking to secure their tenuous foothold in these lands.\n\nAnd what of the people caught up in these catastrophic events? Dispossessed but not defeated, their lives ripped apart, the English struggle for freedom from tyranny; amongst them, caught up in the turmoil, are a soldier, a thane and two sisters. As events unfold, their destinies become intertwined, bringing drastic changes that alter their lives forever.\n\nFirmly embedded in the history of the Conquest, ‘In the Shadows of Castles’ is ultimately a story of love, hope and survival in a time of war.\n\nA few years ago I read and reviewed G.K. Holloway’s fabulous novel 1066: What Fates Impose. It was the story of the most fateful year in English history, of Harold II, William the Conqueror and the Norman Conquest of England. The story revolved around the relationship between William and Harold and their ultimate, fatal confrontation at the Battle of Hastings. In the Shadows of Castles opens where 1066: What Fates Impose ended, with the English defeated and William the Conqueror receiving the submission of England’s earls and the atheling Edgar, who had hoped to take the crown himself.\n\nIn the Shadows of Castles feels more personal than did 1066: What Fates Impose. It is less concerned with the great events in history and concentrates more on the life and experience of Bondi, a housecarl who had been in the service of King Harold and was now a part of the English ‘resistance’. Bondi’s experiences in trying to halt the wholesale takeover of England contrast with King William’s systematic replacement of English lords with Norman ones and of handing out the lands, of those English killed at Hastings, to hie faithful followers.\n\nIn the Shadows of Castles follows the experiences of the English resistance, which culminates in the Harrying of the North over the winter of 1069-1070. The English fight back wherever and whenever they can against the relentless onslaught of the Norman army. Helped – and hindered – by the Danes, Bondi and his friends are forced to become fugitives after being separated from their forces. But there are lighter moments, where Bondi finds friendship and love in those surrounding him. And support from locals who risk everything to help the cause.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, everyone in London knew of the housecarls’ fate. People wondered if the future held the same in store for them. One of those unaware of the slaughter was Bondi Wynstanton. At the Blue Anchor, a small group talked animatedly at the bar.\n\n‘The Normans set fire to Berkamsted barracks,’ one man said.\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘They burned down the barracks, and no one’s left alive,’ the man said.\n\n‘Nobody? Are you sure?’\n\n‘I am. I’d make myself scarce,’ the man said, looking at the dragon tattoos on Bondi’s arms. ‘Go to the great hall. Somebody might help you.’\n\nBondi was still coming to terms with the news as he slinked across London’s back streets. The town seemed divided. One half contained the English, sullen and resentful behind their walls. The other was a Norman city, composed of two motte-and-bailey fortifications. It was as if each part of the city held the other under siege. In this atmosphere, Merleswein called the thanes together in London’s great hall. Bondi arrived just as the meeting started. It was a heated affair, acrimonious and loud.\n\nMerleswein stood up. ‘Thank you all for coming,’ he said. Gradually, the noise abated.\n\n‘You’re all aware of what happened the other night,’ Merleswein said. ‘We need to decide what we are to do next. I, for one, will leave London at the earliest opportunity. If you want to come with me or join me in Lincoln, you’re welcome. If you meet any housecarls, bring them with you.’\n\n‘What of Edgar and the earls? Why aren’t they here?’ an old thane said.\n\n‘William is keeping them close, but don’t concern yourself. They will have word of what’s happening and know they can join us if they escape.’\n\n‘So, they are prisoners, then?’ the old thane said. ‘What are we going to do?’\n\n‘Those who are able should go to Lincoln. William won’t bother us there. He would have to send his entire army to bring us back, and he won’t do that. When we’ve formed up there, we’ll make plans.’\n\n‘What if we can’t get away? Some of us have families and work here,’ someone yelled.\n\n‘All I can do for now is offer hospitality in Lincoln. Everyone is welcome,’ Merleswein said.\n\nThere was a general stir as people discussed what to do.\n\nMerleswein took his seat and turned to Waltheof. ‘Do you think many of them will accept my invitation?’ he said.\n\n‘No. Not unless they’ve lost everything. Those who still have a home or a business will stay here, hoping it won’t happen again. It will be those who have nothing to lose who follow you.’\n\nWhile they were talking, Bondi made his way over to them.\n\n‘Excuse me, my lord.’\n\nMerleswein looked down at him from the dais. ‘Bondi, isn’t it?’\n\n‘That’s right, my lord.’\n\n‘If I were you, I’d get as far away from London as possible.’\n\n‘I’ve considered that, so I’m going to Ireland.’\n\n‘Why Ireland?’ Merleswein said.\n\n‘I was there with King Harold when I was a boy. I heard his mother, Lady Gytha and Edyth, his wife, were going there to join his sons. My guess is they’ll be coming back with an atmy, so I thought I’d join them.’\n\n‘And avenge your fallen comrades?’\n\nG.K. Holloway brilliantly captures the confusion among the English as the implications of their defeat at Hastings dawns upon them. He expertly captures the hope, despair and confusion that must have been rife among the conquered English. He does not shy away from the hard facts and more unpleasant aspects of war, nor of conquest, especially for the women. His knowledge of the history of the period has been used to recreate the world of 1066 and the years following.\n\nAlthough the Normans are the bad guys in In the Shadows of Castles it was good to see William de Warenne, one of the subjects of my own research, given a prominent role among William the Conqueror‘s retinue. Indeed, G.K. Holloway has ensured that he used historical personages wherever possible and staying true to their story, which adds a sense of authenticity to the novel.\n\nG.K Holloway takes us on a sweeping trek through England and even into Scotland and Denmark, following the story of the conquered English and triumphant Normans. The post-Conquest years were years of struggle and betrayal on both sides and In the Shadows of Castles draws the reader into this amazing story. The characters are authentic, deep and beautifully written. You can almost imagine yourself in the Yorkshire of a thousand years ago!\n\nAnd entertaining and engaging novel, In the Shadows of Castles is an excellent read and I cannot wait to read the next instalment in the story, Fire in the Fens.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nG. K. Holloway did several jobs after leaving school before taking A Levels at his local college and later a degree in History and Politics at Coventry University. Once he had graduated, he spent the next twenty years working in education in and around Bristol. After reading a biography about Harold Godwinson, he studied the late Anglo-Saxon era in detail and discovered a time of papal plots, court intrigues, family feuds, loyalties, betrayals, assassinations and a few battles. When he had enough material to weave together fact and fiction, he produced his award-winning novel, ‘1066: What Fates Impose’, the first in a series about the Norman Conquest. G. K. Holloway lives in Bristol with his wife and two children.\n\nVisit G K Holloway’s website http://www.gkholloway.co.uk\n\nGK Holloway’s books on Amazon\n\n*\n\nMy Books\n\nSigned, dedicated copies of all my books are available through my online bookshop.\n\nOUT NOW!

But Henry was still a conservative Catholic and while others embraced the Reformation and the tenets of Calvinism or Lutheranism, Henry remained Catholic to his dying day, just not Roman Catholic. His break with Rome led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries, where monastic institutions and communities were broken up and sold off.\n\nThis, in turn led to the Pilgrimage of Grace, a popular revolt in Yorkshire in October 1536, led by Robert Aske, which spread to other parts of northern England. The rebellion was inspired by the failed Lincolnshire Rising, which had started on 1 October 1536 and it was said 22,000 people followed a monk and shoemaker, the vicar of Louth and Nicholas Melton (known as Captain Cobbler) to protest against the closing of the monasteries and the seizure of church land and plate. The figure was probably much smaller, perhaps some 3,000 rebels. However, by the time they marched on Lincoln and occupied Lincoln Cathedral, some 40,000 rebels were demanding the right to worship as Roman Catholics and protection for the treasures of Lincolnshire’s churches. The Rising was all but over by 4 October, when Henry sent word that the protesters should disperse or face retribution at the hands of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who had mobilised his troops to put down the revolt.\n\nBy 14 October, most of the host had returned home. The two ringleaders were hanged at Tyburn, while other leading rebels were executed in the following days. It was against this background and the fear that the Rising must have invoked throughout Lincolnshire, that Anne Askew came to the fore. Anne Askew, also spelt Ayscough or Ainscough, was born around 1521, probably at the family home at Stallingborough, near Grimsby in Lincolnshire. She was the daughter of Sir William Askew and his first wife, Elizabeth Wrottesley.\n\nAnne was the second oldest of five children, with an older sister Martha, a younger sister Jane, and two younger brothers, Francis and Edward. Her father, a landowner in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, was knighted in 1513. He attended the king at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in France in 1520 and in 1521 he was appointed High Sheriff of Lincolnshire. From 1529, he was a member of Parliament for Grimsby. After the death of Anne’s mother, he married twice more. He married the daughter of a Struxley or Streichley of Nottinghamshire, whose name is sadly now lost to history and married again in 1522 to Elizabeth, the daughter of John Hutton of Tudhoe, Co. Durham and the widow of Sir William Hansard of South Kelsey, Lincolnshire, with whom he had two more sons, Christopher and Thomas.\n\nBy about 1523, the family had moved to South Kelsey, just 20 miles from Lincoln. Anne was well educated, possibly by tutors, though we do not know the specifics of her education. Anne’s writings were published posthumously by reformist scholar John Bale, and it is from these that we get most of her story.\n\nAnne’s future was decided following the tragic early death of her older sister, Martha. Sir William had arranged for Martha to marry Thomas Kyme of Friskney, the son and heir of a neighbouring landowner. Sadly, Martha died before the wedding could take place. Rather than suffer a financial loss with the failure of the arrangement, Sir William offered 15-year-old Anne as a replacement bride, ‘so that in the ende she was compelled against her will or fre consent to marrye with hym,’ and, as John Bale put it, Anne ‘demeaned her selfe lyke a Christen wife’.1 Anne and Thomas had two children together.\n\nIt was about the time that Anne was preparing for her wedding, in 1536, that the Lincolnshire Rising erupted, starting in Louth and making its way towards Lincoln. Her father Sir William was one of the commissioners for the king’s tax subsidy who were due to sit in Caistor as the rebels arrived in the town. Sir William attempted to ride for home, ahead of the rebellious host. He was soon captured, aware that his own servants who were accompanying him supported the rebels. Anne’s brothers were also arrested by the rebels and their house watched. Sir William was then forced to write to the king to inform him of what had happened, with the complaint that ‘the common voice and fame was that all jewels and goods of the churches of the country should be taken from them and brought to Your Grace’s Council, and also that your said loving and faithful subjects should be put off new enhancements and other importunate charges.’2\n\nWith the failure of the rebellion, Sir William and his sons returned home. One wonders if the treatment of her menfolk, at the hands of those who were defending Roman Catholicism, was not a factor in Anne turning to the reformed faith. However the transformation came about, and in spite of her husband’s devout Catholicism, Anne did become a committed Protestant. She acquired a copy of an English Bible and began reading aloud from it, though her husband and brother had both forbidden her to do so. Anne explained that ‘in processe of tyme by oft reading of the sacred Bible, she fell clerelye from all olde superstycyons of papystrye, to a perfyght believe in Jhesus Christ.’3\n\nIn May 1543, the Act for the Advancement of True Religion was passed, forbidding any woman below the rank of noblewoman or gentlewoman from reading the Bible; and forbidding any woman, of any rank, from reading the Bible aloud. Anne was a gentlewoman and therefore still permitted to read the Bible, but only in private. She wanted to travel to Lincoln to see the cathedral’s Bible, but Kyme forbade it. Anne had been apprised of the hostility this would engender: ‘For my fryndes told me, if I ded come to Lyncolne, the prestes wolde assault me and put me to great trouble, as thereof they had made their boast.’4 Anne did travel to Lincoln and stayed there for about six days, reading her Bible in the cathedral. She said that one man confronted her, but he had said so little of significance that she could not recall his words.\n\nThis incident, and the fact that Anne continued to read aloud to whoever would listen, to such an extent that the local priest complained to her husband, infuriated Thomas Kyme. Angry and embarrassed at his wife’s actions, Kyme drove her from the house, with some violence. Driven from hearth and home – and from her children, Anne resumed her maiden name and sought a divorce. In late 1544 she travelled to London, accompanied by only a maid, in order to obtain a legal separation in the court of chancery. Two of her brothers were already in London. Edward, who had previously been in the service of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, was cup-bearer to Henry VIII and her half-brother, Christopher, who died around this time, was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber.\n\nHer cousin, Christopher Brittayn, was a lawyer at the Temple and Anne’s sister Jane was married to George St Poll, a lawyer in the service of the duke and duchess of Suffolk. Anne lodged in a house close to the Temple, London’s legal centre, and soon met others with like-minded religious views, many with connections. Several gentlewomen gave Anne money, including the countess of Hertford and the wife of Sir Anthony Denny. They both sent messengers to Anne with money.\n\nAnne found herself moving in exalted circles, these ladies were close friends of Henry VIII’s new queen, Kateryn Parr, though whether the queen and Anne ever met is uncertain. Anne made other connections in the city, including her religious advisor John Lascels and the chronicler Edward Hall. She was also close to the Kentish Anabaptist Joan Bocher, who would be executed in 1550.\n\nAfter preaching publicly in the streets of the capital, Anne came to the attention of the authorities. According to Anne’s nephew, writing after her death, she was arrested following the interception of a letter she was trying to send, while attempting to communicate with the queen. She was detained on 10 March 1545, under the Six Articles Act, which made deviation from the official tenets of the English church a civil offence. Anne was brought before Sir Martin Bowes, Lord Mayor of London, and the bishop of London’s chancellor, and interrogated as to her beliefs. She was told that St Paul forbade women from talking of the word of God, but Anne countered that St Paul only barred women from instructing a congregation.\n\nStill only 24 years of age, Anne was confident, fearless and bold in dealing with the great men of the city of London. Women were not meant to behave in such a way, they were supposed to be contrite and accept the superior intellect and authority of the men in charge. As a consequence, the Lord Mayor ordered her imprisonment. She spent 12 days in prison, visited daily by a priest sent by Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London. Her cousin, Brittayn, failed in his petition to have her released on bail, but succeeded in having her examined before the bishop himself, on 25 March. She was accused of subscribing to reformist beliefs concerning transubstantiation and the other sacraments and the dominion of the priesthood and asked to sign a declaration of orthodox faith.\n\nAnne took the paper and wrote ‘I, Anne Askewe do beleve all maner thynges contayned in the faythe of the Catholyck churche.’5 Bishop Bonner flew into a fury, but her cousin, Brittayn, persuaded him that she acted from her ‘weak woman’s wit’ and with the added voices of her friends, Hall, Hugh Weston and Francis Spilman, Anne was returned to prison for one more night before being freed on bail the next day. Whether or not Anne abjured is open to interpretation; the authorities say she did, Anne denied it.\n\nOnce freed, Anne continued to pursue her divorce from Thomas Kyme. The Privy Council became involved and ordered both Anne and Thomas to appear before them within ten days. Anne and Kyme were brought before the Council at Greenwich and were questioned about their relationship. The questioning, under the direction of Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, turned to the matter of Anne’s views in the sacrament and after an exchange of words whereby Anne evaded Gardiner’s questions, she was again committed to prison for the night, this time to Newgate, a harrowing place. Kyme returned home. Anne was brought before the Council the next day and questioned further by Bishop Gardiner, who declared that she should be burnt.\n\nAccording to Anne herself, they charged her ‘upon my obedience to show them if I knew any man or woman of my sect. Answered that I knew none. Then they asked me of my lady of Suffolk, my lady of Sussex, my lady of Hertford, my lady Denny and my lady Fitzwilliam.’6 These women were close associates of the queen, Kateryn Parr. The queen’s chambers were searched for heretical texts, though none were found.\n\nOn 28 June 1546, Anne Askew was arraigned for heresy at the Guildhall in London, alongside Nicholas Shaxton, former Bishop of Salisbury, and two other men. Shaxton abjured but Anne was condemned ‘without any triall of a jurie’.7\n\nThe next day, Anne was sent to the Tower and subjected to further questioning. It was hoped that this would force Anne to reveal her associates at court and, by extension, their husbands. When she refused to name anyone, her interrogators, Thomas Wriothesley and Richard Rich, took the exceptional step of having her undress to her shift and fastened to the rack. In Anne’s own words:\n\nThen they put me on the rack because I confessed no ladies or gentlewomen to be of my opinion; and there they kept me a long time, and because I lay still and did not cry, my lord chancellor and Master Rich took pains to rack me with their own hands till I was nigh dead. Then the lieutenant (of the Tower) caused me to be loosed from the rack. Immediately, I swooned away, and then they recovered me again. After that I sat two long hours reasoning with my lord chancellor upon the bare floor.8\n\nAs a woman, gently born and already condemned, Anne should have been exempt from such treatment. Anne was so severely tortured that by the end of it her body was broken, all four limbs were dislocated and she was unable to stand. She was eventually returned to Newgate from where, on 16 July 1546, Anne was carried to the site of her execution at Smithfield, sat on a chair in a cart, every movement causing her more pain. She was tied to another chair at the stake, where she was given one more chance to recant and receive a pardon.\n\nShe refused.\n\nShe died alongside three other Protestants, John Lascels, John Hadlam, who was a tailor, and John Hemley, formerly an Observant friar.\n\nAnne Askew holds the terrible distinction of being one of only two women to have ever been tortured in the Tower of London, the other being Margaret Cheyne, who had been involved in the Pilgrimage of Grace and was also burnt for heresy. Anne died bravely, never revealing her connections at court, thus, perhaps, saving a queen of England from the same fate. She was 25 years old.\n\nOn a national level, her death was a consequence of the growing fear that accompanied Henry’s failing health. On a personal level, although Anne’s journey to London had arisen from her marriage troubles, these troubles were always entwined within her own spiritual journey. Anne’s supreme confidence in her faith and her courage under torture deservedly earned her a place in the Protestant martyrology. Her own, first-hand account of her story was edited and published by John Bale and reprinted in John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, ensuring her legacy would pass down through the generations.\n\n*\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Led by the fearsome Viking warlord Guthrum, the fate of the men, women, and children at their mercy appears all but sealed. But underestimate the great king at your peril…\n\nGathering allies and bannermen to his cause, and building a strategy that will hopefully ensure victory, Alfred sets out to undermine the strength of the complacent invaders, and establish Wessex as the greatest territory in the British Isles.\n\nA final showdown awaits. Not only with Guthrum and his savage warriors, but with destiny. As the battle lines are drawn, the destiny of not just Wessex, but of every Anglo-Saxon in Britain, rests firmly on Alfred’s shoulders.\n\nAn utterly ferocious and gripping adventure, covering the fascinating middle years of Alfred the Great’s reign, one of Britain’s most influential monarchs.\n\nWar is coming!\n\nAt last! the second book in Steven A McKay’s new Alfred the Great series has arrived. To be fair to Steven, we haven’t had long to wait, even though it felt like an age. The problem was, we left King Alfred at the end of The Heathen Horde, rather down on his luck and looking like things could only get even worse. So it has been agony, waiting for Sword of the Saxons, to see how Steven would get Alfred out of it. We all know the history, Alfred is defeated and seeks shelter in the marshes of Athelney, burns some cakes in order to learn patience and then comes back with a vengeance. So we did know that Alfred’s defeat was not the end of the matter. However, when you get caught up in the story, you need more!\n\nAnd leaving Alfred, defeated and a fugitive, was a difficult pill to swallow.\n\nKing Alfred is the hero who fought to defeat the Danish and Norse invaders – collectively known as the Vikings by many – and unite the disparate kingdoms of England under one king. The kingdom of England would not come to pass in his lifetime, but he started the fight that would be continued by his son and daughter – Edward the Elder and Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians – and completed by his grandson, Athelstan, the first King of England.\n\nSword of the Saxons picks up where The Heathen Horde left off and takes us on Alfred’s journey to not only survive in the marshes, but rebuild his army, renew alliances and begin the fight back. In Sword of the Saxons, King Alfred becomes the leader that England needed, and demonstrates the abilities, both martial and political, that justify his epithet of ‘the Great’.\n\n‘I can almost – almost! – understand Ealdorman Wealdmar giving in to the Danes without a fight,’ Wulfric said to Alfred as they rode towards the little coastal village of Bryn on the outskirts of the Somerset marshes. ‘But his son, Diuma? Refusing to let us into the town when he knew the Danes were hunting us? Gods, I was starting to like the an, and I believed he was a fiercely loyal thane to you, my lord.’\n\nAlfred cleared his throat and spat into the bushes on the side of the road, disgust twisting his features at the memory of the night Wulfric was referring to. ‘So did I,’ he growled. ‘But it seems Diuma was only ever loyal to himself.’ He shook his head and made a cutting motion with his hand. ‘I might possibly be able to forgive some of the men who’ve betrayed me, like Ealdorman Wulfhere. Perhaps they felt like they had no choice. But Diuma? I treated him like a friend. And Brycgstow? That was far enough away from any of Guthrum’s forces to be a target for them! No, Diuma has no excuse for what he’s done. I hope the sea-wolves bleed him and his father dry, and then, eventually, I’ll come face to face with them and hear their excuses before…’ He trailed off, jaw clenched, knuckles white as he gripped his horse’s reins.\n\nThere were only two other men with them that morning, for they were merely riding to collect a few supplies but, more importantly, to make sure the good people of Bryn knew that Alfred was still very much alive and hadn’t abandoned his kingdom despite Guthrum’s invasion. The king believed it did the people good to see him in person, rather than his hearth-warriors simply carrying word of his survival to the towns and villages located around Athelney’s marshes. He was a man, after all, not a myth.\n\n‘When are we going to send out word to gather the fyrd, lord?’ The question came from one of the other riders who’d accompanied them, a small but sturdily built warrior called Dunstan. He’d been thane of a village in the north of Wessex which had been utterly destroyed six years earlier, by a party of Northmen led by Jarl Ubba. After that, Dunstan pledged himself to Alfred and now served as one of his fiercest hearth-warriors.\n\nThe fourth man in the small group was the sentry from the previous night, Aedan, and he too looked with interest at Alfred, wondering what his reply would be to Dunstan’s question.\n\nThe king shook his head slowly. ‘In truth, I don’t know,’ he admitted. ‘I’d like to make sure we have the support of as many people as possible in these nearby settlements. We need to know we can call upon a decent sized fyrd from the lands around Athelney before we look at enlisting people in towns further away.’ He noticed Dunstan and Aedan sharing uncertain glances. ‘I know you two are desperate to take the fight to Guthrum, but we can’t afford to act rashly. First, we build our foundation here in Sumosaete, and then we move on from there.’\n\nWith The Heathen Horde, it took me a few chapters to get into the story, to stop comparing Steven A. McKay’s version of King Alfred with the Alfred of Bernard Cornwell – and it took me a while to stop expected Uhtred of Bebbanburg to turn up and save the day, but in Sword of the Saxons Steven has made King Alfred his own. He portrays the great battles his way, has created a hero in Alfred that the reader can get behind wholeheartedly. He is much more likeable than Bernard Cornwell’s King Alfred! Less judgmental…\n\nAlongside Alfred the Great and his family, Steven A. McKay has created a wealth of characters with varying degrees of loyalty to the king. All must be moulded together to fight Guthrum and his men. I have to admit, I love the portrayal of Æthelflæd, Alfred’s oldest daughter and soon to be the Lady of the Mercians. She is a young woman who knows her duty – but also knows her worth and her abilities. She is very much the Æthelflæd I imagine.\n\nSword of the Saxons is the beginning of the fight back against the invaders. It shows King Alfred coming into his own, becoming the great leader who we know today. He has setbacks, he has doubts, and he has to overcome illness. But this is the Alfred who will lead the reconquest of England that will be completed by his grandson. Steven A. Mckay achieves a wonderful balance, between telling the personal stories of his characters and presenting the great history that they are living through.\n\nIt is a gripping read. The fast-paced story leaves the reader breathless – and reading into the early hours! I have no hesitation in recommending Sword of the Saxons to anyone and everyone. Read it! you will not be disappointed.\n\nBuy Sword of the Saxons\n\nAbout the author:\n\nSteven A. McKay was born in Scotland in 1977 and always enjoyed studying history.

Diane de Poitiers had joined the court at the age of 14 and had married to Louis de Brézé, a rich and powerful widower, the following year. An attractive young woman, Diane had a natural elegance and was careful of her looks. She never used make-up to enhance her appearance, using only cold water on her face and body; she went to bed early and took regular outdoor exercise, avoiding excesses of any sort. When she came to court, Diane was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude of France. When Claude died, she served Francis I’s mother, Louise de Savoie and the Queen Eleanor of Austria, King Francis’ second wife. Widowed in 1531, Diane wore black and white – the colour of mourning – for the rest of her life, and she retained control of her husband’s finances, the king allowing her to manage all her inherited estates without the supervision of a male guardian or relative, thus allowing Diane to be financially independent.\n\nThe younger son of Francis I and Queen Claude, Henri had spent 4 years in captivity in Spain from the age of 7. Following Francis I’s defeat at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, in order to obtain his own freedom, the French king had agreed to give up his 2 sons, Henri and his older brother, Francis, as hostages and had them despatched to captivity in Madrid. It was, perhaps, not surprising that Henri had returned from his four years in Spain at the age of eleven ‘an unpolished and silent boy.’1 The king asked Diane de Poitiers to become his son’s tutor. She and the prince developed a strong bond which would eventually develop into a romantic relationship, despite the fact she was 19 years older than Henri.\n\nIn 1533, Henri was married to Catherine de Medici and a year later, Diane became one of his mistresses. And in 1536, at the age of 18, Henri’s older brother, Francis, died suddenly, making the young prince dauphin of France. Two years later, Henri fathered a daughter on another mistress, Filipa Duci, who was the sister of one of his Piedmontese grooms. The baby girl was named Diane de France, in tribute to Henri’s favourite mistress. With his marriage to Catherine de Medici still childless, the birth of an illegitimate daughter was proof, as far as Henri was concerned, that the fault did not lay with him. It was, however, a humiliation for Catherine.\n\nOnce Henri became dauphin, the apparent barrenness of the prince and his wife became a serious concern. Talk at court began to centre around the possible repudiation of Catherine. Diane and Catherine, mistress and wife, formed a truce in order to ward off any attempts to force Henri and Catherine to divorce; concerned that Catherine was failing in her duty to produce an heir and that, although Henri liked Catherine well enough, he was not passionate with her. Aware that her own position would be threatened by the arrival of a new bride for Henri, Diane determined to help Catherine. To resolve the situation, Diane offered the dauphine advice on Henri’s preferred sexual positions and how to arouse the prince’s passion. Awkward! When this did not work, Catherine had spy holes made in her chamber floor so that she could watch Henri, in the chamber below, with Diane. Historian Estelle Paranque explains that; ‘the sight of their intimate encounter only succeeded in deeply hurting the dauphine, however, who realised that Henri did not perform the sexual act the same way with her as he did with his mistress.’2\n\nDiane continued to offer advice to Catherine, before eventually offering to stimulate the prince before sending him to his wife’s bedchamber. However awkward this must have been for both women, it apparently worked, with Catherine herself admitting to Henri showing more passion in their lovemaking. And by June 1543, Catherine was pregnant. A baby boy arrived on 19 January 1544, named Francis after his grandfather. And a year later, a baby girl named Elisabeth joined the little prince in the nursery. Catherine was finally able to feel safe from being discarded and abandoned. Ten children eventually filled the royal nursery, seven of whom reached adulthood.\n\nIn the autumn of 1544, probably somewhat to Catherine’s satisfaction, King Francis’ mistress, the duchesse d’Étampes, with whom Diane had a bitter rivalry, succeeded in arranging her banishment from court, after Henri had replaced one of the duchess’s protégés while campaigning against the English in Picardy. Diane retreated to her château at Anet, closely followed by a sulking Henri. She received permission to return to court the following year.\n\nIn spite of this, Catherine would remain in the shadow of Henri and Diane’s love throughout their marriage, with Henri continuing to shower his favourite mistress with patronage. He even had a monogram designed, interlacing the H and D of their names, and placed them everywhere he could. King Francis I died in 1547, and Henri was now King Henri II of France. But, while Catherine was now queen of France, she wielded little political influence and it was Diane’s star that rose still higher. She was made maitresse en titre and a permanent member of Henri’s privy council. She was showered with jewels and offices, as well as estates and other honours. The Venetian ambassador, Marino Cavalli noted Diane’s influence over the new king, stating that ‘this lady has made sure to indoctrinate, to correct, and counsel’ Henri.3 Wherever the king and queen were found, so too was Diane de Poitiers, walking right behind Catherine. In Paris, Diane was named in the same rank as the princesses of France, while in Rouen the aldermen brought her jewels and gifts made of gold and laid them at her feet. King Henri gave her the royal Château of Chenonceau, despite the protestations of Catherine, who thought it should be hers. Henri ignored Catherine’s pleas. Yet another slight the young queen had to endure due to her husband’s infatuation with Diane de Poitiers.\n\nAnd it was to Diane that the responsibility of impressing foreign ambassadors fell. In 1550 the English ambassador, William Pickering, was staying at the French court, at that time at Diane’s Château of Anet. After his audience with the king, Diane entertained the ambassador, showing him the magnificence of her château. And in 1552, Venetian ambassador Lorenzo Contarini remarked on Diane’s influence at court; ‘she knows about everything and every single day, after dinner, the king looks for her and spends an hour and a half with her to discuss everything that has happened.’4 At tournaments, it was Diane’s colours that the king displayed, not those of his queen. Created Duchess of Valentinois by Henri II, she was, quite literally, the love of his life. Although the king never had children with his maitresse en titre, he did have children with other mistresses and, of course, his wife.\n\nAs Henri’s reign progressed, he began to show greater confidence in his queen, but Diane still managed to thwart the Catherine achieving significant power. In 1548 and in 1552, when Henri was out of the country on campaign, he entrusted Catherine with the regency of France. However, in 1548 Diane managed to persuade Henri to appoint Anne de Montmorency (a man) as co-regent and in 1552, she had Chancellor Bertrandi named as co-regent, effectively forcing Catherine to answer to him.\n\nCatherine would, eventually get the upper hand.\n\nThe rivalry between Catherine de Medici and Diane de Poitiers would come to an abrupt end in the summer of 1559. In the March of that year, Henri had turned 40. He had spent the last 26 years of his life married to Catherine de Medici; for 25 of those years, he had been in love with Diane de Poitiers. On 22 June, Catherine and Henri’s daughter, Elisabeth, was married to Philip II, King of Spain, by proxy in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The wedding was followed by a series of celebratory tournaments. In 1552, Catherine had been warned by Simeoni, the famous astrologer, that Henri would die in a duel in his 40th year, and that the wound would first blind him. This knowledge made a superstitious Catherine quite anxious as the jousts started. However, the king was always eager to impress his mistress with his prowess in the lists, wearing her colours of black and white. The king performed admirably against his first opponent, winning when he hit his brother-in-law, the duke of Savoy, in the chest and unhorsed him. The second bout was a draw, and it was after this that Catherine asked him to retire, but Diane de Poitiers encouraged the king to continue and in the next joust, though unhurt, Henri fell off his horse. The king insisted on going again, against the same opponent, Gabriel de Montgomery, and it was at this moment that King Henri II’s luck ran out.\n\nMontgomery’s lance struck the king’s helmet, a fragment of the splintered lance having pierced Henri’s eye. Henri had fallen from his horse, and as his squires removed his helmet they revealed a face covered in blood. The mortally wounded king was carried to his chambers and placed in his bed, joined by Diane and Catherine, one at either side, both sobbing. Catherine called the renowned surgeon Ambroise Paré to attend the king, but after practicing the required surgery on executed prisoners, Paré had to tell the queen that the king could not be saved. Henri II lingered for 10 days, in agonising pain, before dying on 10 July 1559. He had been attended throughout by his queen. Henri is said to have called out for Diane, but she was not allowed to see him, nor attend the funeral. Diane was banished from court. Her influence ended with the king’s death and power now rested firmly in the hands of Queen Catherine, mother and regent to the new king, Francis II.\n\nOn hearing of Henri’s death, Diane wrote to Catherine asking for ‘pardon for my past offences against your person’ and signing the letter ‘your most obedient and loyal subject.’5 Diane sent back some crown jewels, items that had been gifted to her by Henri, in the hope that the queen would be compassionate. Diane de Poitiers knew that without the king’s protection, she was vulnerable to Catherine’s malice. The queen was not spiteful, however, and allowed Diane to keep all that she had acquired in her years at court. Except for the Château of Chenonceau. Diane retreated to her château at Anet, where she had once entertained ambassadors and lived there, a virtual exile. She would die there in 1566, following a fall from her horse the year before. For a quarter of a century, Diane de Poitiers had enjoyed more influence as the king’s mistress than any other woman in France, including the queen. Henri II had showered affection, riches and power on the woman who had held his heart, choosing to ignore the humiliations that he was heaping upon his wife.\n\nThe scandalous ménage-a-trois only ended with the king’s death.\n\n*\n\nImages:\n\nCourtesy of Wikipedia\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Carol Ann’s new book Courting the Virgin Queen: Queen Elizabeth I and Her Suitors is due to be released on 30 July by Pen and Sword. If it is anything like her first book, The Tudors By Numbers: The Stories and Statistics Behind England’s Most Infamous Royal Dynasty, it will be a fabulous read!\n\n“All the Queen’s Men: The Courtships of the Virgin Queen”\n\nCarol Ann Lloyd\n\nIt’s ironic that the child of the most-married English monarch ever is the only English monarch to rule as an adult and never marry! Elizabeth I, daughter of the famous (infamous?) Henry VIII never married. But it was not for lack of options.\n\nThe big question is “Why?” Did Elizabeth really want to marry anyone? What kept her from marrying? Did she ever intend to marry, or was she just keeping all her options open as she navigated the perilous landscape of European politics on her own?\n\nI think there are many ways on answering this question. Let’s start at the beginning of her reign. Elizabeth was the least likely of Henry VIII’s children to come to the throne, and when she did everyone had the same question on their mind. As the Spanish Ambassador, the Count of Feria, reflected in the early days of the reign, “The more I think over this business the more certain I am that everything depends upon the husband this woman may take.” Elizabeth was questioned about her choice of husband by her council, ambassadors, and parliament. It was considered a public not a private matter, and the queen was repeatedly encouraged and counseled to get married and produce an heir for the good of the kingdom.\n\nSo, if everything depended on the husband her would take, what realistically were her options?\n\nSome people might be surprised to learn that one of her first suitors was the husband of her recently deceased sister. Philip of Spain had been married to Mary I until her death, and the couple had no children. Still committed to bringing England back into the Catholic fold, Philip believed he could marry and control Elizabeth. I was surprised as I read his correspondence how convinced Philip was that Elizabeth was desperate for a husband and eager for his offer. Many Catholics never accepted the validity of the marriage between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, so Elizabeth’s hold on the throne was possibly tenuous. Philip believed he was the answer to Elizabeth’s problem. He thought she would jump at the chance.\n\nPhilip could not have been more wrong. Elizabeth knew very well that Philip would seek to involve England in Spain’s wars, as he had during Mary I’s reign. Using her skills in language, Elizabeth dallied with Feria and postponed giving a firm answer until it suited her. That answer was a definite “no.”\n\nThe offer from Philip was only the beginning. I discovered in my research that Elizabeth used the many marriage possibilities as a way of strengthening her position with the international community. She managed to keep several foreign leaders eager for an alliance with England and a marriage with her. Over the years, the king of Sweden, European dukes and archdukes, and even all three of Catherine de Medici’s sons in France were offered as possible husband. And that doesn’t take into account the Scottish and English nobles who wanted to marry the queen.\n\nSpeaking of men in England, was it really Robert Dudley who kept Elizabeth from marrying? He most likely was the love of her life, perhaps the only man she might have married if she had not been the queen. He was at the center of her life, from the day she learned Mary I had died, and she was queen. He became Elizabeth’s Master of the Horse, which meant he was always with her when she went riding, one of her favorite activities. And he was the only man in the kingdom with permission to touch the queen as he helped her onto and off horse.\n\nEven with Dudley’s favored position, there were a few problems in the way. For one thing, he was married. And then his wife died in very suspicious circumstances, making a future marriage potentially devastating for Elizabeth’s reputation. Dudley was unpopular among the council. And ultimately, I believe Elizabeth meant what she is reported to have shouted at him in anger: “I will have but one mistress here and no master.”\n\nSo, did everything depend upon the husband Elizabeth took? Yes, it turns out it did. I realized through the research that the one suitor that Elizabeth courted throughout her reign was the husband she had declared herself wed to when she became queen: her country and her people. Early in her reign, Elizabeth had responded to parliament’s request that she marry by responding that she was “already bound unto a husband which is the kingdom of England.” From the time she became queen, Elizabeth wooed her nation and her people, seeking their approval, favor, and love. That was the husband she took, and it meant everything to her.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nThe many courtships of the woman who became Elizabeth I began when she was an infant, displayed before foreign ambassadors who considered her as a possible clause of a contract between England and France. From such an unromantic beginning, Elizabeth grew to see her father marry multiple times and experienced frequent changes in stepmothers and status in the family. Eventually, she became the most eligible woman in Europe. From start to finish, her marriage prospects were as much political as they were personal.\n\nWhen she came to the throne in 1558, the primary question facing everyone from foreign monarchs to English nobles and ministers was which of her many suitors would finally win her hand. Through the longest Tudor reign, Elizabeth used courtship as a tool to consider foreign alliances, hold ambitious English courtiers in check, and navigate her role as a woman ruler in a world that considered her unnatural without a man at her side.\n\nElizabeth was, in fact, always the ‘Virgin Queen’, from the early days as a twenty-five-year-old presenting herself as a potential royal bride to her final years as an ageing and unmarried woman who was destined to end the Tudor dynasty. Ultimately, she became the only monarch in England to rule as an adult and never marry. Through it all, as friends and potential lovers faded away, she clung to the one true love of her life: England.\n\nCourting the Virgin Queen: Queen Elizabeth I and Her Suitors is available from Pen and Sword and Amazon.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nCarol Ann Lloyd turned an obsession with the Tudors into a speaking and writing career. She shares her love of history with Smithsonian Associates, Royal Oak Foundation, Agecroft Hall, Folger Shakespeare Library and other organizations.

The Blue Mountains may be beautiful, but with the frontier a complex patchwork of feuds and felonies,and ranchers as vicious as any back alley cut-throat in London, Gabriel finds himself unable to escape his past and the demons that drive him. Can he find a place for himself on the far edge of the New World?\n\nI have to confess, I haven’t read a Western in years, but Dark Frontier by Matthew Harffy has certainly got me in the mood for more. And for an author used to writing about warfare with guns and axes in the early medieval period, he certainly knows his way around a six-shooter. Though he does manage to get a sword into the action at one point, which was pretty impressive!\n\nDark Frontier is the story of a man heading west to escape his past, and his demons, only to find his demons are not that easy to avoid. He also finds that trouble is just as present in the American West as it was on the streets of London. And, a policeman at heart, trouble is not something he seems to be able to walk away from. Dark Frontier is a fascinating adventure based around a ranch war between a sheep farmer and a cattle baron. The cattle baron wants more land – the sheep farmer doesn’t want to oblige.\n\nThings turn nasty.\n\nThe man might be old, but Stokes had witnessed how deadly he was. As the boy ranted and screamed, the grey-haired man had watched, hand resting lightly on the butt of his holstered pistol. He didn’t move and had said nothing for a time until he uttered a few words that had sent the boy into such a blind rage that he had jerked his revolver out of its holster and fired wildly. The old man had not flinched, though there had been less than ten feet separating them. An instant later, his revolver, a gleaming Remington, had appeared to leap into his hand. It had barked once, silencing the boy and his frantic shooting forever.\n\n“You son of a bitch!” shouted a long-faced man with pox scars on his cheeks who had followed the boy out of the billiard hall. “You killed Wyc.” His face was growing redder by the second. “You didn’t need to kill him.” His hand dropped to the dark wooden butt of the revolver he wore in a black leather holster on his right hip.\n\n“Done a lot of things I didn’t need to,” said the old man who had shot the boy called Wyc. “Killing your friend ain’t one of ’em.” The barrle of his Remington did not waver as he pulled the hammer back with his thumb. He had fired only one shot, but the bullet had caught Wyc in the chin and exited from the back of his head, leaving a hole the size of a teacup saucer.\n\nSeveral men came out of the billiard hall with Wyc, voices raised and joining in his brash insults, but Stokes noticed that none of them had been foolish enough to reach for their own guns. Most had already fled, running off as the shots were fired. The few that remained now edged away from the angry man who vented his ire at the calm, grey-haired shooter.\n\nThe pock-cheeked man swallowed, perhaps suddenly aware of his predicament. He was staring into the smoking barrel of a revolver in the sure hands of a proven killer. His fingers trembled above the butt of his handgun.\n\n“Halt,” Stokes said, his voice cutting through the hubbub. “Both of you.” Everybody turned to look at him. Everybody except the old man with the Remington. HIs hand did not move and his gun remained trained on the red-faced cowhand. Stokes was used to having his voice listened to, but nobody here seemed inclined to obey him. He took a step closer and snapped his fingers.\n\nWith the West becoming more accessible with the expansion of the railroad, cattle barons are greedy for more land so they can fulfill government contracts. JT’s, the ranch belonging to Gabe’s best friend, John Thornford, is in the way of progress, as far one cattle baron is concerned. Throw in a murder mystery, budding friendships, violent attacks and a good fist fight or two – along with the odd pistol whipping and shoot-outs and you have the ingredients for a perfect Western novel.\n\nWhat makes Dark Frontier such an incredible story is the breadth and range of characters. Gabe Stokes is the quintessential, broken Englishman who finds that the rules are few and far-between when it comes to the wide open plains of frontier America. Mary Ann Thornford is a widow, with 2 young children, left alone to take on the oily, powerful and determined cattle baron, Tom Grant. She has a handful of farmhands to help out, and Her husband’s old friend, Gabe Stokes.\n\nWith a fast-paced, engrossing story and characters the reader can get behind, Dark Frontier has all the ingredients for an exciting adventure. And it doesn’t disappoint. Matthew Harffy has certainly made the switch from early medieval historical fiction to the Wild Wild West with great aplomb.\n\nEnjoyed it immensely!\n\nI do hope there are more Westerns to come!\n\nTo Buy A Dark Frontier:\n\nAmazon:https://geni.us/DarkFrontierBlogTour\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nAbout the author Matthew Harffy grew up in Northumberland where the rugged terrain, ruined castles and rocky coastline had a huge impact on him.

As the eldest surviving child of Mary Tudor, dowager Queen of France and Duchess of Suffolk, Frances was fourth in line to the throne after the children of Henry VIII, Edward, Mary and Elizabeth. When settling the succession, the king had instructed that his younger sister Mary’s line should be preferred over that of his older sister, Margaret. As a consequence, Frances was frequently at court.\n\nThe couple’s first child, a son, died young. They had three surviving daughters. The eldest, Jane, was born in October 1537, about the same time as her cousin Edward, the future King Edward VI; with the birth of the longed-for heir to the throne, Jane’s own birth went almost unnoticed. Jane would have been named after Henry VIII’s tragic queen, Jane Seymour, who died within two weeks of Edward’s birth.\n\nJane Grey would be known to history as the Nine Days’ Queen.\n\nShe was raised at the family home of Bradgate Park, near Leicester. Frances and Henry Grey are said to have been very strict parents who were not prone to expressions of love and affection; the children were used to sarcasm, cuffs and criticism. In her teenage years, Jane herself is said to have complained to the visiting scholar Roger Ascham:\n\n‘When I am in the presence either of father or mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit, stand or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be sewing, playing, dancing, or doing anything else, I must do it as it were in such weight, measure and number, even so perfectly as God made the world; or else I am so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea presently sometimes with pinches, nips and bobs and other ways (which I will not name for the honour I bear them) … that I think myself in hell.’1\n\nJane enjoyed study and excelled in all fields, including Greek and philosophy. She was afforded a first-class education and from 1545 her tutor was John Aylmer. Aylmer had been sponsored through his studies at Cambridge by Jane’s father, the Marquess of Dorset, and was a brilliant academic. As a future courtier, Jane was given lessons in dance and music; probably including the popular instruments, the lute, spinet and virginal. In religion, Jane and her sisters were raised as ‘evangelicals’, the common word in the first half of the sixteenth century for Protestants. From the age of nine, Jane’s mother would have taken her to court from time to time, to familiarise her daughter with the court and her future duties as a Maid of Honour. Frances was at the time serving as a Lady of the Privy Chamber to the king’s sixth wife, Kateryn Parr, Henry VIII’s 6th and final wife.\n\nIn January 1547, King Henry VIII died and was succeeded by his 9-year-old son, Edward VI. Jane and Edward were first cousins, once removed,and it is entirely possible – even likely – that Frances and Henry harboured hopes that Jane would marry the young king. It was Henry VIII’s will that shaped and dominated Jane’s future. More than ten years before his death, Parliament had granted Henry the right to bequeath the crown where he desired, rather than by strict primogeniture. In his final will, dated 26 December 1546, Henry excluded the Stuart line of his elder sister Margaret and settled the succession, should his children die without heirs, on the descendants of his younger sister, Mary, Duchess of Suffolk. Should Edward, Mary and Elizabeth all die without producing a child of their own, Jane would be queen; although Henry probably still held out hope that Frances would produce a son who could inherit ahead of the sisters.\n\nThe government of England was now in the hands of the boy-king’s uncle Edward Seymour, Earl of Somerset – soon to become duke of Somerset. Somerset and Henry Grey did not get along well and Grey, though he was the only marquess in England he was not appointed to the new king’s privy council. The younger brother of Somerset, Thomas Seymour, the Lord High Admiral of England and first Baron Seymour of Sudeley, having recently – and rather scandalously – married the king’s widow, proposed that he take on the wardship of Lady Jane. Henry Grey was reluctant, given the scandal attached to the hasty marriage of Queen Kateryn and Seymour just four months after the king’s death. However, Princess Elizabeth had already joined the dowager queen’s household and Seymour hinted at arranging a marriage between Jane and the young king when they were old enough, sweetening the deal with the offer of a payment of £2,000 for Jane’s wardship.\n\nJoining the household of the dowager queen was a great opportunity for Jane, which would provide her with connections that would benefit herself and her family. And so, at ten years-old, Jane was given into the custody of Thomas Seymour and from then on was frequently in the household of Kateryn Parr, at Chelsea and later at Sudeley Castle. This was one of the happiest periods of Jane’s short life.\n\nDuring her time in the dowager queen’s household, Jane got to know her cousin, Princess Elizabeth, better, though they never grew close. At thirteen, Elizabeth was too old to pay much attention to ten-year-old Jane. And despite her tender years, Elizabeth was rather self-contained and distant; she had already experienced the highs and lows of royal life, from being lauded as her father’s heir to being declared a bastard and knowing her mother was executed as a traitor. The princess had learned not to trust easily and to keep her own counsel. That Jane was, technically, Elizabeth’s heir, must have made the relationship more fractious in a world where one’s inheritance could be erased by an act of parliament.\n\nJane must have enjoyed living in a household of well educated, inquisitive women. One wonders, though, if she was aware of other goings-on in the household, as Thomas Seymour paid excessive attention to Princess Elizabeth. This caused tensions within the household, especially after the queen fell pregnant and began to fear that Seymour saw Elizabeth as a suitable replacement should she die in childbirth. Fearful for the princess’s reputation – and of her husband’s intentions – Elizabeth was sent away by Kateryn. Jane was now the most senior lady in the queen dowager’s household. And when Kateryn died a week after giving birth to her only child, Lady Mary Seymour, it was 11-year-old Jane who acted as chief mourner at her funeral, walking behind the queen’s coffin from the house to the chapel at Sudeley.\n\nAfter the funeral, the queen’s household was broken up and Jane sent home to her parents. Within a few weeks, however, Thomas Seymour, now over the first stages of grief at losing his wife, given the blow to his finances and status the queen’s death had caused, realised that he could yet regain some standing if he resumed his guardianship of Jane. It took some persuading, but Seymour assured Henry and Frances that Jane would be well cared for and under the supervision of his mother. Although the late dowager queen’s women were still in Seymour’s household, the atmosphere had changed; and as Seymour’s ambitions came under suspicion from the Privy Council, it must have been an uncomfortable place for Jane to be. Amid rumours that Thomas Seymour was intending to marry Princess Elizabeth, he was arrested, as were Elizabeth’s servants. Elizabeth herself continued to insist that she would never agree to marry anyone without the Council’s permission.\n\nSeymour was condemned for high treason by Act of Attainder and executed on 20 March 1549. On Seymour’s arrest, Jane had returned to Dorset House, her family’s London residence. Henry Grey may have seen his own hopes of advancement and Jane’s marriage to Edward VI disappear at Seymour’s arrest, but he must have been relieved that at least he had survived the affair with his head still on his shoulders. Besides, the wheel of fortune was about to turn his way. People were becoming increasingly disenchanted with Somerset’s rule and in the wake of Kett’s Rebellion in Norfolk, by 14 October it was Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, who was lodged in the Tower under arrest. John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and future Duke of Northumberland, took the reins of government. Henry Grey was finally appointed to the Privy Council and received numerous rewards of office and grants of lands and lordships.\n\nJane’s marriage was never far from the minds of those in power. Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset had wanted to marry Jane to his oldest son and heir, the earl of Hertford, also called Edward. Nothing had come of this plan by the time of Somerset’s fall. Before that, as early as 1541, the French Ambassador had proposed that she marry Charles, Duke of Orléans, third son of King Francis I, but the boy died in 1545. John Dudley initially favoured a marriage between Jane and the king. The children born of such a marriage would secure the succession and guarantee the continuance of the new religion within England’s borders. It would also resolve the problems associated with the succession of Mary or Elizabeth. Jane and Edward were good friends and corresponded regularly, but neither Jane nor Edward appeared enthusiastic about the suggestion and the idea was dropped, for the time being.\n\nBy February of 1553, the point was moot.\n\nThe young king was ill again, and it was becoming apparent that he was dying. Those around him started looking to the problem of the succession. The next in line was Princess Mary, a committed Catholic who would undo all the work Edward had done in advancing the Reformation. Edward could not pass over Mary’s claim to the crown in favour of Elizabeth, so chose to exclude all females from the succession and his ‘Device’ would leave the crown to ‘the Lady Jane’s heirs male’. As his health failed him, in June King Edward changed the wording of the Device to ‘The Lady Jane and her heirs male.’ Further arguments for excluding Mary and Elizabeth centred on their legitimacy – open to question after Henry VIII had, at various times, declared them both illegitimate – and the fear that they would marry outside of England.\n\nJane, on the other hand, was married to Lord Guildford Dudley, the fifteen-year-old son of John Dudley, now Duke of Northumberland and Lord President of the Council. Their parents saw the young couple as an alternative, Protestant king and queen to the Catholic Mary. The wedding had taken place in May 1553 in Dudley’s London home, Durham House. The young couple had been reluctant to marry and were bullied into it by their parents.\n\nAged just fifteen, King Edward VI died at Greenwich Palace on 6 July 1553. He was unmarried and left no heir. As the king lay dying Mary was summoned to the council, but instead rode to Kenninghall in Norfolk, with Robert Dudley despatched to intercept her with orders to take the princess to a place of safety. On 8 July, Mary heard the news of the king’s death and the following day proclaimed herself queen, despatching a letter to the Privy Council, ordering them to endorse her claim. She then moved to the formidable fortress of Framlingham Castle, where thousands flocked to her standard. Princess Elizabeth initially stayed away, pleading illness, watching and waiting to see how events played out. On 9 July the Privy Council summoned Lady Jane, recuperating from an illness at Chelsea, to appear before them. Dudley’s daughter, Mary Sidney, was sent to escort Jane by barge to Syon House, where she was greeted by two nobles who knelt before her, kissed her and informed her that Edward had nominated her as his successor. John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland and now father-in-law of the new queen, gave a lengthy speech, informing all present that King Edward’s wish had been for Jane to succeed him. Jane was left trembling and speechless before she fell to the ground, crying and declaring\n\nI am insufficient to fill the role.2\n\nJane’s reaction to the proclamation of her accession to the throne suggests that she was not aware of the plans of Edward, Dudley and her father to make her queen. Though she was a clever girl and may well have suspected what was afoot. The next morning, dressed in the green and white of the Tudors and accompanied by her husband Guildford dressed equally splendidly in white and gold, Jane was escorted to the Tower in a procession of barges. There were no flags being waved, and no crowds lining the river to get a glimpse of their new queen. London was only just learning of the king’s death. Jane was greeted at the Tower by the Marquess of Winchester and Sir John Bridges, Lieutenant of the Tower, and various other civilian and military officials. Winchester knelt before the young queen and presented the keys to the fortress. John Dudley stepped forward and took them. Jane then made her ceremonial entrance into the White Tower and, with flags flying, a fanfare of trumpets and guns firing in salute, was seated under the canopy of state. The crown was brought to her, but she initially refused to wear it, only putting it on when Winchester persuaded her that he wished to see how it suited her.\n\nOn one matter, Jane was adamant. She refused to make Guildford king: ‘If the crown belongs to me, I would be content to make my husband a duke. But I will never consent to make him king.’3 Royal blood flowed through Jane’s veins, not her husband’s. Apparently, Guildford fled the room in tears, but his parents were hopeful that Jane could be persuaded to change her mind. After all, they lived in a patriarchal society and no one expected that a woman could actually rule in her own right.\n\nThe Privy Council and leading judges declared Jane the new Queen of England.\n\nThat Sunday, at St Paul’s Cross, Bishop Ridley preached that as bastards, Mary and Elizabeth were unfit for the crown and that Mary’s Catholicism was a particular threat to the country, exposing it to foreign influence. A devout Protestant, Jane was seen as the symbol of continuity for the Protestant faith, untainted by any previous declarations of illegitimacy. However, there was no rejoicing and only the herald could be heard to shout ‘Long live the Queen!’\n\nFor 9 days, Jane was England’s first female monarch.\n\nBy 12 July, Mary and her supporters had gathered at Framlingham, Suffolk. Within days, the duke of Northumberland rode out of London with 3,000 men, promising to capture or kill Mary. Jane ordered the gates to the Tower be locked and the keys given to her. On 18 July, Jane began raising troops to be led against rebels in Buckinghamshire. But as Northumberland left London, everything began to fall apart. Rumours circulated that Mary had a force of 30,000. Londoners refused to rally to the duke’s army.\n\nNorthumberland’s coup collapsed.\n\nOn 19 July, Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, declared in favour of Mary. He entered his daughter’s chamber, where she sat at dinner under a canopy of state, and dramatically tore down the hangings. The next day, the Privy Council proclaimed Mary as Queen of England. And Jane went from being queen to a prisoner in the Tower of London; she was taken from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler’s lodgings. Her mother and ladies-in-waiting were allowed to return home, which they did without delay.\n\nMary was crowned on 1 October 1533, and Jane’s younger sisters Katherine and Mary became maids of honour to the new queen. Frances, too, was welcomed at court. John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, Jane’s father-in-law, had been tried and convicted of high treason and executed on 22 August 1553. After just a few days in the Tower, Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, was pardoned and allowed to go home to his wife.\n\nAs for Jane, in November, she, her husband and two of his brothers were tried and convicted of high treason. Mary was willing to be merciful and spared their lives, for the moment. Jane was kept in comfortable confinement and may have hoped that she would eventually be released, had her father not involved himself in yet another plot…\n\nOpposed to Mary’s proposed marriage to Philip of Spain, the Wyatt rebellion, led by Sir Thomas Wyatt, the son of the poet who was an admirer of Anne Boleyn, aimed to overthrow Mary. The intent was to marry Princess Elizabeth to Edward Courtney, Earl of Devon and a descendant of Edward IV, and put Elizabeth on the throne. As Wyatt raised an army in Kent, Grey was raising forces in the Midlands. However, Wyatt’s forces were overwhelmed as London closed its gates to them and Grey was arrested at his manor of Astley. He was taken prisoner, arraigned for his treason, condemned, and executed at the Tower on 23 February 1554, less than a month after his brief rebellion began.\n\nThough she was in no way implicated in the rebellion, her father’s actions had already sealed Jane’s fate; her very existence as a possible figurehead for Protestant discontent made her an unacceptable danger to the state. The queen could no longer afford to be merciful, and Mary signed the death warrant for Jane and Guildford; the sentence for Jane was commuted from burning to beheading. She received a few days’ stay of execution while Mary sent the dean of St Paul’s, John Feckenham, to her to try and persuade Jane to accept the Catholic faith. But Jane remained steadfast, writing ‘Lord, thou God and father of my life, hear me poor and desolute woman, arm me, I beseech thee, with thy armour, that I may stand fast.’4\n\nThe night before her execution, aware that her father, by now also imprisoned in the Tower, was in great distress over her fate, Jane wrote a final letter to him:\n\n‘Father, although it pleases God to hasten my death by one by whom my life should rather have been lengthened; yet can I so patiently take it, that I yield God more hearty thanks for shortening my woeful days, than if all the world had been given into my possession, with life lengthened at my own will. And albeit I am assured for your impatient dolours redoubled manifold ways, both in bewailing your own woe, and especially, as I hear, my unfortunate state; yet, dear father (if I may without offence rejoice in my own mishaps), herein I may account myself blessed, that washing my hands with the innocence of my fact, my guiltless blood may cry before the Lord, ‘Mercy to the innocent!’5\n\nAt ten the next morning Guildford Dudley was taken from the Tower and escorted to Tower Hill for his execution. Jane watched him leave from her window. As Jane walked to her own execution, Guildford’s body was carried into the Tower’s chapel, St Peter Ad Vincula, for burial. Dressed in black, Jane mounted the scaffold by the White Tower. Speaking to the assembled crowd, she performed the traditional admission of guilt, saying that she had acted against the queen’s highness, though qualified it with:\n\n‘Touching the procurement and desire thereof by me or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocence.’6\n\nHaving said her piece, and her prayers, Jane gave her gloves and handkerchief to Elizabeth Tilney and her prayer book to Thomas Bridges, the brother of the Lieutenant of the Tower. Jane then removed her gown, headdress and neckerchief as the executioner knelt to ask her forgiveness, which Jane gave willingly.\n\nJane knelt and, with her handkerchief tied over her eyes, she had to feel for the block and cried out ‘What shall I do? Where is it?’ when she couldn’t find it.7 One of those close by guided her to the block.\n\nHer final words were ‘Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!’8\n\nShe was despatched with one stroke of the axe.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 .Lady jane Grey quoted in Jill Armitage, Four Queens and a Countess: Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, Mary I, Lady Jane Grey and Bess of Hardwick, p. 54; 2.
