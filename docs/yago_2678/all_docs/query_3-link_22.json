He was called \"The Boy Wonder\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty and The Good Earth. [1]\n\nHis films carved out an international market, \"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\" states biographer Roland Flamini.[2]\n\nFamous in his own right as one of the greatest film producers of all time, Thalberg was also the first husband of Academy Award winning actress, Norma Shearer. He was instrumental in starting with the careers of many, many successful actors and actresses and involved with the production of many, many highly successful films. [3]\n\nIrving was born 30 May 1899 in Brooklyn, New York,[4] the son of William Thalberg and Henrietta Heymann.[5]\n\nHe was married to the actress Norman Shearer 29 September 1927 in Beverly Hills, California.[6] They were the parents of Irving Jr. (1930-1987)[7] and Katherine (1935-2006).\n\nIrving died 14 September 1936 in Santa Monica, California. His remains were buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.[8]\n\nAfter his premature death from pneumonia at the young age of 37, the motion picture industry created the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award, to reward excellence in producers in the movie business.[9]\n\nObituary:[10]\n\nIrving G. Thalberg Dies in Hollywood\n\nHollywood, Sept.14--Irving Grant Thalberg,motion picture production genius and husband of Norma Shearer, film star, died at 10:16 a.m. today after a brief illness which resulted in lobular pneumonia.\n\nThalberg, a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer vice-president, was 37, and rated as one of the industry's outstanding executives. With his passing, death struck at the very heart of Hollywood. In all of its amazing history the motion picture industry has had no man who made his life so much a part of it. He was the \"little Napoleon of the films. Almost as a boy he had directed the destiny of pictures.\n\nThe end came at his home in Santa Monica. At his bedside were his wife, Norma Shearer, Mr. and Mrs. William Thalsberg, his father and mother, Mrs. Edith Shearer, mother of Norma Shearer, Mr. and Mrs. Laurence Welngarten (his sister), and Mr. and Mrs. Berale Hyman.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Irving Grant Thalberg on Wikipedia.\n\n↑ Irving Grant Thalberg on Wikipedia.\n\n↑ Irving Grant Thalberg on Wikipedia.\n\n↑ \"United States World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918,\" Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KXY2-K6B : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving Grant Thalberg, 1917-1918; citing New York City no 71, New York, United States, NARA microfilm publication M1509 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,754,600.\n\n↑ \"United States Census, 1900,\" Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MSNL-7LX : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving Thalberg in household of Henry Heymann, Borough of Brooklyn, Election District 16 New York City Ward 28, Kings, New York, United States; citing sheet 9A, family 174, NARA microfilm publication T623 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,241,067.\n\n↑ \"California, County Marriages, 1850-1952,\" Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K8NV-HS7 : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving Grant Thalberg and Norma Shearer, 29 Sep 1927; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, county courthouses, California; FHL microfilm 2,074,707.\n\n↑ \"California Birth Index, 1905-1995,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VL13-HTK : accessed 25 July 2015), Shearer in entry for Irving Thalberg, 24 Aug 1930; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, Department of Health Services, Vital Statistics Department, Sacramento.\n\n↑ \"Find A Grave Index,\" Database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QVJ1-BGF4 : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving Grant Thalberg Sr, 1936; Burial, Glendale, Los Angeles, California, United States of America, Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale); citing record ID 1025, Find a Grave, http://www.findagrave.com.\n\n↑ Irving Grant Thalberg on Wikipedia.\n\n↑ Springfield Republican Thursday, Sep 17, 1936 Springfield, MA Page: 12.\n\n\"United States Census, 1910,\" Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MP14-FJN : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving Thalberg in household of William Thalberg, Brooklyn Ward 28, Kings, New York, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 902, sheet 14B, family 345, NARA microfilm publication T624 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,374,994.\n\n\"United States Census, 1920,\" Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MJRT-NXW : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving Thalberg in household of William Thalberg, Brooklyn Assembly District 20, Kings, New York, United States; citing sheet 4A, family 76, NARA microfilm publication T625 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,821,176.\n\n\"United States Census, 1930,\" Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XCFF-S33 : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving G Thalberg, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 0822, sheet 11B, family 249, line 69, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 124; FHL microfilm 2,339,859.\n\n\"New York, New York Passenger and Crew Lists, 1909, 1925-1957,\" Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/24V3-5RQ : accessed 26 June 2015), Irving G Thalberg, 1933; citing Immigration, New York, New York, United States, NARA microfilm publication T715 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,757,095."
