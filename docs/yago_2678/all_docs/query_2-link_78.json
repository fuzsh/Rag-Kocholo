        "text": "A divorced couple rekindles the spark after landing in adjoining honeymoon suites with new mates. But bliss is never easy with these two.\n\nStarring Norma Shearer, Robert Montgomery, Reginald Denny, Una Merkel, and Jean Hersholt. Based on the play by Noel Coward. Scenario by Hans Kraly and Richard Schayer. Continuity by Claudine West. Directed by Sidney Franklin.\n\nI have a personal history with Private Lives, having directed a scene from the play during my senior year of high school. The incredible wit, the unbridled hilarity, the moments of real honesty — it will always be one of my favorites. I just watched the MGM film adaptation first the first time this past week and was pleased to see that most of the play was kept in tact. Not surprisingly, the things that DON’T work are the things that were added for the picture — a scene in which Amanda (Shearer) and Elyot (Montgomery) go rock-climbing is especially inessential — but everything that is true blue Coward seems to hit the mark.\n\nThis is due in large part to the wonderful performances. Norma Shearer is truly the star of the picture, but also gives the most believable performance. Her best stuff comes in the first act when she realizes that her ex-husband is standing next to her on the adjoining balcony. Conveying a range of silent emotion in under a minute, this might be the best and the HOTTEST that I’ve ever seen her. (Okay, maybe she was hotter in A Free Soul when she was seducing Gable, but other than that, she’s extra WOW here.) More importantly, she manages to hit all of the comedic notes. She’s particularly brilliant in the second act fight with Elyot. Shearer’s line deliveries are unexpected, unique, and the perfect mix of fun and sophistication.\n\nMontgomery also does well in his role, but isn’t as memorable as Shearer. No doubt Elyot is the harder part; it was written by Coward FOR Coward. Montgomery only half-succeeds in making the character likable, and he doesn’t get nearly all the laughs that Shearer does. But he’s perhaps one of the few MGM A-listers who could even pull the role off. Besides, he and Shearer do have an establish rapport that works in the film’s favor. Meanwhile, Denny and Merkel aren’t nearly as interesting or likable as Montgomery is — with poor Merkel spending most of her screen time hysterically crying. But those roles are fairly thankless anyway.\n\nThe strength of the film lies primarily in the script and the interesting perspectives that both stars bring to their roles. As with most great stage works, there exists so many different ways to play each scene — and deliver each line, even. So, it’s a treat to see Montgomery and, in particular, Shearer take on Coward and bring their natural talents to the table. If you’re familiar with the play, this film is not a disappointment. If you’ve never seen the play, I’d recommend watching the movie and then reading the play. You’ll probably like the play better than the film, but reading it will give you more appreciation for the movie and the performers."
