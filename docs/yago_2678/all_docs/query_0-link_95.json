        "text": "By the mid-1920s, Norma Shearer was one of MGM's biggest stars and had every intention to remain one. For that purpose she regularly visited the office of Irving Thalberg (head of production at MGM), complaining about the routine films in which she was cast and pleading to be given better roles. Thalberg listened to Norma's complaints but said that MGM knew best and that the films they had chosen for her had ultimately made her a star.\n\nAttracted from the start by Thalberg's charm and commanding presence, Norma soon became romantically interested in her boss. While Thalberg didn't feel the same way about Norma, the two started going out together from July 1925 onwards (their first public appearance together was at the premiere of Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush). At the time Thalberg was still involved with Constance Talmadge and Rosabelle Laemmle, yet on occasion asked Norma to be his date. \"When Rosabelle or Constance are away, or someone stands him up, I'm always available. I'll break a date any time to be with him\", Norma had said to Irene Selznick, referring to herself as \"Irving's spare tire\". Norma waited patiently, which eventually paid off. After dating on and off for two years, she and Irving were married on 29 September 1927 and had two children, Irving Jr. (b. 1930) and Katharine (b. 1935). The marriage lasted until 1936 when Thalberg suddenly died as a result of a congenital heart defect, aged 37.\n\nIn 2011, a group of more than 40 telegrams exchanged between Norma and Thalberg was auctioned at Bonhams, offering an intimate peek into the couple's relationship. A few of these telegrams are seen below. The messages clearly suggest that the two were in love, despite rumours that their marriage had been one of convenience. (A persistent rumour was that Norma had married her boss purely for the sake of her career.) The first telegram is from Thalberg to Norma and was sent in April 1927, five months before the couple got married. The other three messages —two of them shown only in transcript— are from 1929.\n\nTranscript:\n\nSANTA MONICA CALIF APRIL 21 1927\n\nMISS NORMA SHEARER\n\nARROWHEAD SPRINGS CALIF\n\nJUST SO YOU WONT FORGET THAT I LOVE YOU DEAR\n\nIRVING\n\n_______\n\nA telegram from Irving to Norma dated 16 March 1929:\n\nDEAREST CUTEST SWEETNESS DARLING ANGEL BUNNY HOPE YOU HAVE MISSED ME AS I HAVE MISSED YOU LOVE PAPA\n\nAnother telegram from Irving to Norma dated 22 December 1929:\n\nHAVE FORD TRUCK FROM STUDIO MEET US PASADENA FIND OUT HOW LATE TRAIN IS SO LITTLE CUTIE DON'T WAIT LOVE=IRVING\n\nTo this Norma responded with the following message (written on the back of the telegram):\n\nTranscript:\n\nWill be counting every minute sweetest little fella\n\nwhats the truck for Eddie Loeb [MGM attorney]\n\nI’ll find out how late the train is going to be honey\n\n+ I’ll sue the railroad for every minute\n\nLove from your lonesome baby little momma\n\nSource: Bonhams"
