Shearer often played spunky, sexually liberated ingenues on the silver screen. She was the first person to be nominated five times for an Academy Award for acting, winning Best Actress for her performance in the 1930 film The Divorcee.\n\nShe was born as Edith Norma Shearer 11 August 1902 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the daughter of Andrew Shearer and Edith Fisher.[1] She immigrated from Canada to New York, U.S. with her mother and siblings. She later moved to California following her dream to be in the movies. She applied for US citizenship in Feb 1931.[2]\n\nShe was married twice. Her first husband was Irving Thalberg, a film producer, whom she married 29 September 1927 in Beverley Hills, California.[3] They were the parents of Irving Jr. (1930-1987)[4] and Katherine (1935-2006). Her husband Irving died in 1936.\n\nHer second husband was Martin Jacques Arrouge, whom she married 23 Aug 1942 in Los Angeles, California.[5]\n\nNorma died 12 June 1983 in Woodland Hills, California.[6] Her remains were buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.[7]\n\nObituary:[8]\n\nNorma Shearer, Movies' Elegant Heroine of '30s\n\nLos Angeles--Norma Shearer, one of the famed Hollywood stars of the 1920s and 1930s, died Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital near here, a hospital spokesman said yesterday.\n\nHer birth year has been variously given as 1900 and 1904. She was born as Edith Norma Shearer in Westmount, a Montreal suburb, and went to public schools in Montreal. Her penniless family sold its dog and its piano to pay the way to her first fling at show business in New York.\n\nFrom there it was not long before her beauty, her hard work, her charm and her marriage to film executive Irving Thalberg had made her a leading light of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios and a pillar of California film society.\n\nIn her early Hollywood days, she played innocent, girlish heroines on the silent screen. Her best known were \"He Who Gets Slapped,\" which starred Lon Chaney in 1924, and \"The Student Prince,\" in which Ramon Novarro had the title role in 1927.\n\nShe made the transition to sound movies with ease and success, and her voice was heard largely in sophisticated, somewhat daring parts. Again and again she played elegant heroines with a tinge of wickedness, as in \"The Last of Mrs. Cheyney,\" which appeared in 1929.\n\nHer starring role in a 1930 film, \"The Divorcee,\" won her an Academy Award, and she was nominated for four others.\n\nShe is remembered largely for her repeated portrayals of rich and worldly ladies in films that, though not very challenging,, were enlivened by a moderate raciness--or what seemed like raciness in those days. It was reflected in such titles as \"The Divorcee,\" \"Strangers May Kiss,\" \"A Free Soul,\" and \"Riptide.\"\n\nShe also made some forays into high comedy, such as Noel Coward's \"Private Lives,\" in 1931. ANd she plunged into costumed period films, such as the sentimental \"Smilin' Through,\" \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street,\" which was an enormous critical and commercial hit, and the lavish \"Marie Antoinette,\" her first film after Thalberg's death in 1937.\n\nIn 1942, she married Martin Arrouge, 28, a ski instructor. She is survived by two children of her marriage with Thalberg, Irving Thalberg Jr. and Katherine.\"\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"Recensement du Canada de 1911,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QVBW-K4CC : accessed 25 July 2015), Edith Norma Shearer in entry for Andrew Shearer, 1911; citing Census, Hochelaga Sub-Districts 31-51, Quebec, Canada, Library and Archives of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario; FHL microfilm 2,418,549.\n\n↑ https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-los-angeles-times-naturalization-pet/49253505/\n\n↑ \"California, County Marriages, 1850-1952,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K8NV-HSH : accessed 25 July 2015), Irving Grant Thalberg and Norma Shearer, 29 Sep 1927; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, county courthouses, California; FHL microfilm 2,074,707.\n\n↑ \"California Birth Index, 1905-1995,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VL13-HTK : accessed 25 July 2015), Shearer in entry for Irving Thalberg, 24 Aug 1930; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, Department of Health Services, Vital Statistics Department, Sacramento.\n\n↑ \"California, County Marriages, 1850-1952,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K8VT-WZG : accessed 26 July 2015), Martin Jack Arrouge and Norma Shearer Thalberg, 23 Aug 1942; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, county courthouses, California; FHL microfilm 2,114,961.\n\n↑ \"California Death Index, 1940-1997,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VP89-MPC : accessed 26 July 2015), Norma Shearer Arrouge, 12 Jun 1983; Department of Public Health Services, Sacramento.\n\n↑ \"Find A Grave Index,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QVJ1-BGF3 : accessed 25 July 2015), Norma Shearer, 1983; Burial, Glendale, Los Angeles, California, United States of America, Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale); citing record ID 1994, Find a Grave, http://www.findagrave.com.\n\n↑ Plain Dealer Tuesday, Jun 14, 1983 Cleveland, OH Page: 21.\n\n\"United States Census, 1930,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XCFF-S3Q : accessed 25 July 2015), Norma S Thalberg in household of Irving G Thalberg, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 0822, sheet 11B, family 249, line 70, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 124; FHL microfilm 2,339,859.\n\n\"United States Census, 1940,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K9WR-3R2 : accessed 25 July 2015), Norma S Thalburg, Tract 379, Santa Monica, Santa Monica Judicial Township, Los Angeles, California, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 19-779, sheet 15A, family 378, NARA digital publication T627 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2012), roll 257.\n\n\"United States, GenealogyBank Obituaries, 1980-2014,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QV5Q-XBTW : accessed 25 July 2015), Norma Shearer in entry for Irving G Thalberg Jr, New York, United States, ; from \"Recent Newspaper Obituaries (1977 - Today),\" database, GenealogyBank.com (http://www.genealogybank.com : 2014); citing , born-digital text.\n\n\"United States, GenealogyBank Obituaries, 1980-2014,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QV57-3RJN : accessed 25 July 2015), Norma Shearer in entry for Mr Irving Thalberg Jr, Illinois, United States, ; from \"Recent Newspaper Obituaries (1977 - Today),\" database, GenealogyBank.com (http://www.genealogybank.com : 2014); citing , born-digital text.\n\n\"United States, GenealogyBank Obituaries, 1980-2014,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QV57-3R8R : accessed 25 July 2015), Norma Shearer in entry for Mr Irving G Thalberg Jr, Illinois, United States, ; from \"Recent Newspaper Obituaries (1977 - Today),\" database, GenealogyBank.com (http://www.genealogybank.com : 2014); citing , born-digital text.\n\n\"United States, GenealogyBank Obituaries, 1980-2014,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QV57-7YBP : accessed 25 July 2015), Norma Shearer in entry for Irving G Thalberg Jr, Illinois, United States, ; from \"Recent Newspaper Obituaries (1977 - Today),\" database, GenealogyBank.com (http://www.genealogybank.com : 2014); citing , born-digital text.\n\nSee also:\n\nWikipedia: Norma Shearer\n\nWikidata: Item Q95019, en:Wikipedia\n\nNorma Shearer @IMDb.com"
