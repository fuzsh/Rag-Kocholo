Back then the branches still chose the nominees, as they continue to do today. Mary Pickford was part of the reason for the change as she and many of the Academy founders kept winning the awards. It was also the year Louise Brooks starred in Pandora’s Box, though it didn’t get anywhere near Oscar. We discuss the two Oscars in one year (there were two ceremonies, one in April and one in November) and the Louise Brooks film. Have a listen.\n\nOscar"
