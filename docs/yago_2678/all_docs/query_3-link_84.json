        "text": "From the early 1920s until his premature death in 1936, producer and studio executive Irving G. Thalberg walked the line between commerce and art in transforming the Hollywood system and shifting the balance of power from directors to the studios. Thalberg had his start with Carl Laemmle's Universal Studios, where he guided hits like \"Foolish Wives\" (1922) and \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1923) through production, famously clashing with director Erich von Stroheim on the former. In 1924, Thalberg left Universal for newly-formed rival MGM, where he thrived under head Louis B. Mayer with \"The Big Parade\" (1925), \"The Divorcee\" (1930) and \"Grand Hotel\" (1932). Regarded by the American film industry with a mixture of respect, awe, envy and fear, Thalberg was deemed a \"Boy Wonder,\" until suffering a heart attack in 1932 that led to his departure from MGM. He returned as a producer the following year and went on to make massive hits like \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" (1934), \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1935) and \"A Night at the Opera\" (1935), as well sharing his life with MGM's grand dame, actress Norma Shearer, who had married him in 1927. Though he died young, Thalberg remained eternal. His obsession with quality films and unwavering faith in public opinion turned him into a paragon of the studio factory system and an exemplar of public taste, all of which cemented his place as a Hollywood legend."
