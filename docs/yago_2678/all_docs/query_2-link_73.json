        "text": "When America entered World War II in December 1941, numerous Hollywood actors, directors and other film crew members joined the US Army, Navy or Air Force. After the war had ended, these men, while perhaps physically okay, came back emotionally changed. Trying to return to a life of normalcy, it wasn't always easy for them to immediately find work again. James Stewart, for instance, struggled to resume his acting career in the months following the end of the war. \"I don't know if I'm an unemployed actor or an unemployed pilot\", he famously said. Stewart's contract with MGM was about to expire and the lack of film offers made him wonder if he should return to the screen at all. He even considered going back home to Indiana to run the family hardware store. But then Frank Capra, who had previously directed Stewart in You Can't Take It With You (1938) and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), offered him the role of George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life (1946). Stewart accepted and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nJames Stewart remained in the U.S. Air Force Reserve after the war. In 1959, Stewart was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the highest-ranking actor in American military history.\n\nStewart was certainly not the only one to feel concerned about his film career after returning from the war. In a letter to influential columnist Hedda Hopper dated 31 October 1945, Frank Capra talks about all the other ex-service men — apart from actors, there were writers, directors, cameramen etc. — who were worried about their careers after years of absence, \"scared to death the public [had] forgotten them\". Thanking Hopper for the \"nice plug\" she had given him and Jimmy Stewart, Capra asks her to think of the other men too. He emphasises how grateful they would be for \"any crumbs of publicity thrown their way\" and how \"a word of encouragement\" from her would surely boost their spirits.\n\nTranscript:\n\n31 October 1945\n\nMrs. Hedda Hopper,\n\n6331 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nHollywood, California\n\nDear Hedda:\n\nThanks very much for the nice plug you gave me, Jimmy Stewart and \"MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON.\"\n\nWe are still hoping to get Jimmy for my first picture*, but the deal has not been closed. He is still not quite free from the MGM contract, although it looks certain he will be shortly.\n\nHowever I want to repeat again how appreciative these ex-service men are and will be for any crumbs of publicity thrown their way. Most of them are scared to death the public has forgotten them, and that their future is unsafe. They are amazed at how the public has lionized the 4-Fs. A good many of them feel that the public nausea for uniforms will react against them.\n\nIt's a pity if the careers of some of these public figures are to be jeopardized because they answered their country's call. Many of them did not have to go.\n\nThis applies not only to actors, but there are hundreds of writers, directors, cameramen and other technicians who are worried silly about their future after several years' absence. They are bewildered by the new faces, new producers, new directors, etc., some of whom have never heard of a good many who went into uniform.\n\nA word of encouragement from you now and then would do wonders for the low spirits of many worried and confused guys.\n\nAs ever,\n\n(signed 'Frank')\n\nFRANK CAPRA\n\nNotes\n\n-*It's a Wonderful Life was Capra's first picture for Liberty Films, an independent production company which was formed by Capra and fellow directors George Stevens and William Wyler. Following It's a Wonderful Life, the company would make just one more film, State of the Union (1948), also directed by Capra.\n\n-Frank Capra did not enlist in the army but was commissioned by the US government to make documentaries about the war. Capra's Why We Fight documentaries are war information films, explaining to soldiers \"why the hell they're in uniform\". The series is considered a masterpiece in its genre and won an Academy Award.\n\nFrank Capra receives the Distinguished Service Medal from General George C. Marshall in 1945.\n\nBosley Crowther, famed film critic of The New York Times, was quite critical of James Dean after seeing him in his first big role in Elia Kazan's East of Eden (1955). In his review, published on 10 March 1955, Crowther wrote: \"This young actor, who is here doing his first big screen stint, is a mass of histrionic gingerbread. He scuffs his feet, he whirls, he pouts, he sputters, he leans against walls, he rolls his eyes, he swallows his words, he ambles slack-kneed — all like Marlon Brando used to do. Never have we seen a performer so clearly follow another's style. Mr. Kazan should be spanked for permitting him to do such a sophomoric thing. Whatever there might be of reasonable torment in this youngster is buried beneath the clumsy display\".\n\nCrowther was not the only one to criticise Dean's acting and Kazan's direction. There were others, among them Lee Rogow of the Saturday Review, who wrote on 19 March 1955 that \"Kazan [had] apparently attempted to graft a Brando-type personality and set of mannerisms upon Dean, and the result [was] less than successful\". Dean, who idolised Brando, responded to the criticism inNewsweek: \"I am not disturbed by the comparison, nor am I flattered. I have my own personal rebellion and don't have to rely upon Brando.\"\n\nElia Kazan seemed more hurt by the criticism. Kazan greatly admired Brando — they had worked together on three films, i.e. A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Viva Zapata! (1952) and On the Waterfront (1954) — but being accused of encouraging Dean to act like Brando was \"really too ridiculous\", he thought. In the following letter to Helen Bower of the Detroit Free Press (one of several critics who had written quite favourably about Dean and the film), Kazan defends Dean and with it his own direction.\n\n[New York]\n\nMarch 22, 1955\n\nDear Miss Bower:\n\nThank you for your letter. The allegation about Dean was not concerted but was made in some rather disturbing places by people whom I felt know better.\n\nDean actually has a talent all his own and a sizeable one. He doesn't need to imitate anyone and was not imitating anyone. He admires Brando, as do practically all young actors today. In this respect I would say that he had excellent taste. Brando has no doubt influenced Dean to some extent but he has also influenced 100 others, just as Barrymore did 30 years ago, just as Cagney and Spence Tracy did 20 years ago. The thing about my grafting a Brando-like personality and set of mannerisms on Dean is really too ridiculous to answer. I supposed it was a way of speaking rather than a remark meant literally. I actually don't think he's much like Brando. He's considerably more introverted, more drawn, more naked. Whatever he is, though, he's not an imitation of anybody. He's too proud to try to imitate anyone. He has too much difficulty —as does any decent worker in our craft— thinking about anything except playing the part as written. Critics who say he's imitating Brando just reveal a naivete about acting, direction, and production.\n\nI would love to see your review of the picture. I gather you liked it. It meant a lot to me and I was rather upset by Crowther's reaction in New York. The other critics here, however, liked it very much indeed and the picture is doing well.\n\nSincerely\n\nSource: The Selected Letters of Elia Kazan (2014), edited by Albert J. Devlin\n\nNote:\n\nEast of Eden was a big commercial success. Both Kazan and Dean were nominated for an Oscar (Dean posthumously) but didn't win. Of the four Oscar nominations the film received only Jo van Fleet won. East of Eden also earned the award for Best Motion Picture–Drama at the Golden Globes and Best Dramatic Film at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nElia Kazan and James Dean behind the scenes of East of Eden, below pictured with Julie Harris and Marlon Brando during Brando's visit to the set.\n\n“I doubt if there is a greater, more exhaustingly emotional experience possible than hearing your own music brilliantly performed, performed big, by a great orchestra, with those twenty violins picking up the fugues that were imaginary to you, and a renowned conductor welding the whole thing into something far better and more impressive than you had dreamed.”\n\n—\n\nLionel Barrymore first started to write classical music when he was about thirty years old. Music was his greatest passion, besides art (he initially wanted to be a painter). Barrymore had a huge record collection and an amazing musical knowledge. He was even able to recognise a composer in the first two bars. The multi-talented actor had created numerous compositions, many of which he wrote when he was already in his sixties. Studying with Hungarian composer Eugene Zador, Barrymore had tried his hand at everything —symphonies, fugues, piano suites, operas etc.. He candidly admitted that, while composing his music, he had \"borrowed from everybody except the studio gateman\", thereby noting that \"nothing is new\" and that everyone else, with the possible exception of Richard Wagner and Claude Debussy, was a borrower too. (\"For the most part, every melody you hear is \"Tristan-like\" or taken straight from Debussy\", he thought.)\n\nBarrymore was quite modest about his musical achievements and ultimately felt that people shouldn't take him too seriously as a composer. Nevertheless, he was immensely proud and excited —as one can imagine— when several of his compositions were performed by real conductors and orchestras, some of them even renowned.\n\nThe first time a Barrymore composition was performed in public was in 1940. The symphonic suite Tableau Russe was played by the Los Angeles WPA Symphony Orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl and was next used in the film Dr. Kildare's Wedding Day (1941). Following the death of his brother John in 1942, Barrymore started working on a tone poem as a tribute to John, called In Memoriam. On 22 April 1944, it was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and broadcast nationwide on CBS radio.\n\nPartita was, as Barrymore himself called it, \"a more ambitious composition\" and was one of the highlights of his musical career. The piece was first played by Fabien Sevitzky and his Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra on 20 March 1944. The New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Artur Rodzinski also performed Partita on 31 March 1946, broadcast on national radio as part of a program that included a symphony by Beethoven and an overture by Brahms. It was about the latter performance that Barrymore later said: \"Listening to Partita with Rodzinski and the great New York Philharmonic was, I have to confess with no modesty and no shame, an enormous experience... An orchestra of one hundred pieces, the best musicians in the world, performing me! I took care to be alone that Sunday when they played Partita because I did not want anybody to see me weep.\"\n\nOther notable compositions by Barrymore include his piano compositions Scherzo Grotesque and Song Without Words, which were published by G. Schirmer in 1945; Opera Buffa, which was performed by the Burbank Symphony Orchestra under Leo Damiani in 1949; and the theme song of the radio program Mayor of the Town (1942-1949) of which Barrymore later said: \"... this had a pleasant ring which I always liked, though I could never quite decide where I stole it.\"\n\nArticle from THE ABC WEEKLY, 23 September 1944\n\nOne of the conductors Barrymore had worked with was Fabien Sevitzky of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra (already briefly mentioned above). Apart from Partita, Sevitzky had performed several of Barrymore's compositions, although the first piece he conducted was not an original composition but Barrymore's orchestration of Edward MacDowell's piano suite Sea Pieces. After that first collaboration the two men had stayed in touch through letters, with Barrymore from time to time submitting work for Sevitzky's consideration. Other Barrymore works that Sevitzky eventually performed include Preludium and Fugue in December 1944 and a Piano concerto in 1946.\n\nFrom the Barrymore-Sevitzky correspondence which lasted several years, here are two letters written by Barrymore in 1944. The New York concert mentioned in the second letter possibly refers to the concert at Lewisohn Stadium later that summer (on 2 August), where Sevitzky would again perform Partita, this time conducting the New York Philharmonic.\n\nTranscript:\n\nFebruary 4, 1944\n\nChatsworth,\n\nCalifornia.\n\nMy dear Mr. Sevitzky,\n\nYesterday I sent special delivery score and parts. Please tell me (as I know you will) whether you like it or not. If not, I will completely understand and try again.\n\nI think Hollywood would be indeed most fortunate and grateful if you consented to conduct here again.\n\nFor myself, (entirely off the record), Mrs. Irish has been kind enough to ask me to do the speaking in \"Peter and the Wolf\", and I have as cleverly as I could evaded it. But I am going to say that if they were lucky enough to get Dr. Sevitzky for some concerts I would be most happy to do it under him. In any case I will do this at once, and I feel sure you will be \"encircled\" and \"attacked\" by the Bowl immediately!\n\nSo, I am looking forward eagerly to seeing you here this summer!\n\nWith all fond wishes,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(signed 'Lionel Barrymore')\n\nLionel Barrymore\n\nTranscript:\n\nJune 7, 1944\n\nDear Dr. Sevitzky\n\nThank you very much for your letter of May 25th. Concerning your questions about tempi, everything you suggest is all right. The tempo of the Fugue, however, is about 120-124. #16, 2nd bar, the 5th note is C natural as in the score. The 5th bar after 16, 5th note is F natural, as you say.\n\nThank you in advance for sending the recording to me. I am anxiously awaiting it. I know the performance will be marvelous in spite of the short rehearsing time. I am praying to God that the New York concert will materialize, and since you are the conductor and knowing God's wisdom in all things, I know it will happen!\n\nSince you have done me the great honour of permitting me to submit a Prelude to you, I have thought of nothing else since I got your letter, and believe me, you will have it in ample time. I only pray that it will be worthy of your consideration.\n\nIt will be a great pleasure to see you in person on your visit to Hollywood, and I am looking forward to meeting you.\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n(signed 'Lionel Barrymore')\n\nSource letters: Heritage Auctions\n\nAll quotes in this post taken from We Barrymores (1951), by Lionel Barrymore and Cameron Shipp.\n\nBarrymore's tribute to his brother John In Memoriam can be listened to here; Tableau Russe here (as performed in Dr. Kildare's Wedding Day).
