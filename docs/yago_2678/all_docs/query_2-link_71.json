        "text": "Have you ever wondered why diamonds are the most popular gem for engagement rings? Considering natural diamonds make up over 80% of the engagement ring market you might have thought the answer had something to do with bridal tradition, like wearing a white wedding dress. Perhaps, you believed natural diamonds were the most beloved gems for engagement rings because they are simply so beautiful.\n\nThe history of diamond engagement rings, which dates back to the Renaissance and evolves at an elegant pace, reveals the inflection points of the romantic jewel. While the rate of change in engagement rings has sped up in recent years, natural diamonds have constantly remained the most popular choice. Read on to find out all about it.\n\nMany believe the first diamond engagement ring was given to Mary of Burgundy by the Archduke Maximilian of Austria in 1477. A letter written to Maximilian before he proposed read, “At the betrothal, your Grace must have a ring set with a diamond and also a gold ring.”\n\nLike all precious stones at the time there was symbolism behind the gem. Diamonds sparkled with the purity of fidelity or faithfulness and durability. Lapidaries did not have the tools to cut a diamond. Jewelers mounted them in their natural octahedral form, which looks like two pyramids joined at the base.\n\nA Niklas Reiser painting of Mary from the Renaissance era showing her wearing a solitaire on her right hand, is often used to illustrate the point of her engagement ring. Though it is not known with absolute certainty if the ring in the painting is her engagement ring, it could have been. During the time engagement rings were often worn on the second or the third finger of the right hand, because people believe that one or both of these fingers had veins connected to the heart.\n\nDiamond engagement rings were trendier than you might think from the 15th through the 19th centuries. Rings reflected prevailing jewellery styles as opposed to being made in a classical mode.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, for example, diamond engagement rings often displayed the same kind of decorative enamel found on all kinds of jewellery during the era. They usually centered on a table cut or flat diamond. The look came back as part of the 19th century Renaissance revival and was worn by brides with a passion for the period.\n\nIn 1886, the year the Tiffany Setting launched, the Statue of Liberty was open to the public and Coca-Cola appeared on grocery shelves for the first time. Like those other American icons from the era, the Tiffany Setting has endured.\n\nFounder Charles Lewis Tiffany conceived the Setting to glorify a single diamond as a symbol of everlasting love. The design had prongs lifting a diamond above a slender gold band. Light passed between the ring prongs and through the diamond, heightening its brilliance.\n\nThe deceptively simple style set the stage for the gem to shine as the star and established the new mode for modern engagement rings that dominated the 20th century and continues to be popular to this day.\n\nFirst Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the first high profile women to wear a Tiffany Setting engagement ring. She received the jewel centering on a 3.4-carat diamond from Franklin Roosevelt in 1904 and shortly after wrote him a note saying, “You could not have found a ring I would have liked better.”\n\nInnovations in diamond cutting brought fancy diamond shapes to the forefront in engagement rings during the 1920s. The advancement in lapidary techniques gave square shapes, the rectangular emerald cut and boat shaped marquise sharper edges. Lapidaries could also cut long slim sleek facets resulting in brighter gems for engagement rings.\n\nOne of the most well-known fancy-cut diamond engagement rings of the period belonged to the Hollywood movie star Norma Shearer. In 1927 when the young producer Irving Thalberg, known as “The Boy Wonder of MGM” proposed to Shearer in his office, he showed her a tray full of engagement rings and told her to pick one. The actress chose a large marquise shape diamond set on a slender platinum band. After she received the ring, Shearer wore it in all her movies where she played a married woman.\n\nThere are some who believe diamond engagement rings only came into vogue during the mid-20th century. The theory, which we have clearly proven wrong, is based on the success of the “A Diamond Is Forever” ad campaign conceived by N.W. Ayer copywriter Frances Gerety in 1948.\n\nWhile the line has become legendary and certainly helped encourage couples to choose a diamond at the time, there were other factors that added to the mid-century enthusiasm for the gem.\n\nIn 1947 a few years before she became Britain’s Queen, Princess Elizabeth announced her engagement to Prince Philip and showed the press and public her engagement ring with a 3-carat round diamond center stone flanked by smaller diamonds set in platinum.\n\nThe glamour of the fairy tale royal romance and the fascination with every detail of it was another source of inspiration for couples to get diamond engagement rings during the post war marriage boom.\n\nA few years after Marilyn Monroe sang “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend” in the 1953 classic film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes two iconic movie stars seem to be embodying the statement with their ginormous emerald cut diamond engagement rings that raised the bar and set the standard for Hollywood glamour.\n\nElizabeth Taylor received a 29.4-carat emerald-cut diamond engagement ring from film producer Michael Todd at the end of 1956. When asked about it by the press, Todd joked that “it was not quite 30 but twenty-nine-and-a-half carats.” Taylor referred to her big diamond as “My ice-skating rink.”\n\nPrince Rainier of Monaco gave Kelly a Cartier ring with a 10.48-carat-emerald cut diamond flanked by two baguettes. The jewel received international attention because Kelly was going to be leaving Hollywood to become royalty when she married the prince. Before she left, she wore the ring in her final film High Society (1956).\n\nIn 2002, shortly after Jennifer Lopez released her “Jenny from the Block” video which has been called a Y2K mood board and features Ben Affleck, the actor proposed with a 6.1-carat radiant-cut fancy intense pink diamond with two trapezoid white diamond side stones mounted in platinum and pink gold from Harry Winston.\n\nJ.Lo announced the couple’s engagement during an ABC Primetime: Special Edition interview with Diane Sawyer on November 13, 2002. “Bennifer” famously the called it quits before getting married, but the pink diamond engagement ring still launched a new found love for the fancy-colored diamond.\n\nIn 2004, Heidi Klum and Seal did for yellow diamonds what Ben and Jen did for pinks. The singer made his proposal to the super model a dramatic event that was extensively covered by the press after the fact. It began with a helicopter ride to an igloo built near a mountain top of a Canadian resort."
