        "text": "Applications within the chemical synthesis field remain nevertheless rare even though variety of studies have been reported targeting new photocatalytic processes via synthesizing of composite or doped catalyst. Wide range of reaction types has been presented by different authors, which includes oxidations [1,2,3], reductions [4], isomerizations [5], additions [6], cyclizations [7] and so on. As a fact, conventional industries tactics in this area rarely meet the present day sustainability requirements, environmental safety and power performance essentially for a green processes [6]. TiO2 inspected for photocatalytic techniques because of its economic manufacturing costs, lengthy-term stability upon corrosion photochemical affects and nontoxicity [7]. During the last decades, diverse TiO2 structures have been reported, like TiO2 fibers, hollow sphere and tubes and tested for photocatalytic reactions [8, 9]. TiO2 photocatalytic activity remains weak, that's because of week seen mild responsiveness because of its high band gap (3.0–3.2 eV) and rapid recombination of electron-hollow pairs [10], and in order to enhance capacity of TiO2 absorption for seen mild (43% of the whole sunlight), numerous techniques were deployed [11]. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is insoluble in water as a thermoplastic, while it decomposes in acids or bases. PHB tainted at when it be exposed to temperatures beyond its melting point (175 °C) [12]. Carbon dioxide, methane and water generally are the outcome of PHB biodegradation which can be done or achieved utilizing microorganisms in soil [13, 14] and could be accelerated utilizing plasticizers [15]. However, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is considered as the most widely used photocatalyst for the photocatalytic reactions even though it comes with its own limitations such as it is only active when irradiated by UV light, due to its wide band, which makes it not as effective under sunlight, since the solar spectrum only consists of about 4% of UV light. Adding to that, TiO2 has a high electron/hole pair recombination rate compared to the rate of chemical interaction with the adsorbed species for redox reactions [15]. The objective from the presented work was to observe PHB films photodegradation with different conditions and study the surface morphology of PHB films.\n\nChemicals, reagents and solvents were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (Gillingham, UK). The bacterial isolate of our study (Rhodococcus sp.) was isolated from soil sampled at Gunung Lang, Perak, Malaysia [16,17,18].\n\n2.1 Preparation of PHB\n\nPHB was extracted from Rhodococcus equi in existence of chloroform and crude palm kernel oil (CPKO; 1%) as a carbon giver [14, 19, 20], and the structure was authenticated using FTIR, 1H-NMR and GC techniques as shown in Fig. 1 [20].\n\n2.2 Thin films preparation\n\nA solution of PHB in tetrahydrofuran was stirred at 25 °C for 30 min; various concentrations of TiO2 (0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004 and 0.005 wt%) were added to the PHB solution, and these mixtures were stirred at 25 °C for 30 min. Each sample was cast onto glass plates, and the formed films were left for 24 h at 25 °C under a vacuum to dry [20, 21].\n\n2.3 UV light exposure\n\nUltraviolet light with below specifications was supplied to conduct the irradiation on RHB films samples: λmax = 365 nm and light intensity = 6.2 × 10–9 ein dm−3 s−1 nm. The PHB films were rotated consistently to ensure uniform supplying of light intensity on all the samples sides [20, 21].\n\n2.4 Observation of the photodegradation of PHB films\n\n2.4.1 FTIR spectroscopy\n\nBelow equation was used to calculate the indices for carbonyl (IC=O), polyene (IC=C) and hydroxyl (IOH) groups based of the data extracted from FTIR testes which have been performed to study the IR absorption bands amendments for carbonyl (1722 cm−1), polyene (1602 cm−1) and hydroxyl (3500 cm−1) groups. The functional group index (Is) as it is known depends on two conditions or variables which they are: peak absorbance in study (As) and as well, the reference peak (Ar) [22].\n\n$${I}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\frac{{A}_{\\mathrm{s}}}{{A}_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\left(1\\right).$$\n\n(1)\n\n2.4.2 Weight loss method\n\nThe percentage of PHB films weight loss (during processing the irradiation) was estimated based on the weight changes of the sample (before and after irradiation (W1), (W2), respectively) as in Eq. (2).\n\n$$\\mathrm{Weight}\\,\\mathrm{loss}\\, \\% = \\left[\\frac{{W}_{1}-{W}_{2}}{{W}_{1}}\\right]\\times 100 (2).$$\n\n(2)\n\n2.4.3 UV spectrophotometer\n\nSpectrophotometer (by A Shimadzu UV–Vis 160A-Ultraviolet) had been ran to record the UV–visible spectra changes of PHB films during irradiation (where λmax = 313 nm) [20]. kd factor which is known as photodecomposition rate constant for each prepared PHB sample was calculated using Eq. (3).\n\n$${\\mathrm{ln}({A}_{t}-A}_{\\infty })=ln\\left({{A}_{0}-A}\\right)-{k}_{d} t (3).$$\n\n(3)\n\nThe plot of \\({\\mathrm{ln}({A}_{\\rm t}-A}_{\\infty })\\) versus irradiation time (t) gave straight line. The slop is equal to kd, indicating that the photodecomposition of PHB obeys to first-order kinetics which is in line with Khan et al. finding [23].\n\n2.5 The surface morphology\n\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of PHB surface spotted utilizing voltage up to 15 kV, while PHB films depth (ca. 30 µm) deliberated utilizing Digital Vernier Caliper 2610 A micrometer apparatus.\n\nGenerally, photocatalysis is the changes of decomposition reaction under radiation within the sight of photocatalyst substance that retains under light as IUPC has defined it. This process is engaged with chemical transformation of the response accomplices [24]. The relationship between carbonyl (ICO), polyene (IPO) and hydroxyl (IOH) indices with irradiation time for PHB films photodegradation which containing different concentrations (0.001–0.005 wt%) of TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalysts as shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. All the results investigate PHB films, in the existence of TiO2 nanoparticles, have a higher growth rate with 250 h of irradiation time compared to blank films. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show that indices (ICO, IPO and IOH) were the highest when the concentration (0.005 wt%) was and lowest when the concentration (0.001 wt%) of TiO2 nanoparticles as a photocatalysts. Therefore, TiO2 nanoparticles, in particular high concentration (0.005 wt%), considered as a photocatalyst for PHB films (30 μm thickness) photodegradation.\n\nThe weight reduction of PHB films treated samples (30 µm thickness), at different TiO2 nanoparticles concentrations (0.001–0.005 wt%) against irradiation (250 h), extracted and referred to that acquired for unmodified PHB film. Figure 5 represents those changes in PHB weight loss percentage. Evidently, the PHB films with different concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles show higher weight loss compared to blank PHB. Therefore, TiO2 nanoparticles, in particular high concentration (0.005 wt%), demonstrate the most photocatalytic effectiveness with PHB photodegradation.\n\nThe irradiation led to a notified changing in modified PHB films samples, and dissociation had taken place. Figure 6 shows the changes in the \\({\\mathrm{ln}({A}_{\\rm t}-A}_{\\infty })\\) in 250 h of irradiation time for PHB films that containing different concentrations (0.001–0.005% by weight) of TiO2 nanoparticles. The photodecomposition rate constant (kd) was highest for PHB film which contains TiO2 with high concentration (0.005 wt%) [20].\n\nFigures 7 and 8 represent microscopic images for PHB films containing different concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles before and after irradiation. Discoloration and degradation could be noticed on the surface of PHB that containing the nanoparticles after irradiation via the optical images (Fig. 8), as indication for photodegradation. PHB (blank) and those samples treated with TiO2 before irradiation demonstrated a round cross section using optical microscopy with a relatively smooth surface; it has been observed formation of fine pigment particles with uniform distribution. Treated PHB after irradiation revealed characteristic surface cracks. Notwithstanding surface affected with the cracks, the sporadic and surfaces rakish states, particularly apparent at the edges, is steady with the mechanical breakage of bigger chains, maybe made weak through oxidative weathering.\n\nSEM gives clear idea about morphology of the polymers’ surface which reflects their internal structures [25]. The surface morphology of the PHB thin films doped with various concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles has been analyzed using SEM characterization from 5 to 200.00 Kx magnifications. Figure 9 shows that the PHB surface was damaged after 250 h of irradiation.\n\nIt can be observed from Figs. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 the formation of ice rock structure with sturdy feature and tiny mist morphology [26]. The presented SEMs morphology for PHB thin films doped with different concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles illustrates entirely rough surface structures was increased with increases in concentration of TiO2 for the prepared samples.\n\nFigures 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 show damages on the sample surfaces that treated with TiO2 particles after irradiation. These damages were more noticeable compared to the ones containing TiO2 nanoparticles beside the cracks that been discussed earlier.\n\nBasic mechanism built on the ROS formation which signifies i, the radical reactive oxygen forms as superoxide anion radical (·O2–) and highly reactive hydroxyl radical (·OH). Non-radical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is formed and singlet oxygen (1O2), ozone (O3) [13, 27] (Schemes 1, 2)."
