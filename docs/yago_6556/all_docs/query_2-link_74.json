Alero\n\nWhere it’s used: Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala\n\nAlthough alero literally means roof eaves, it’s most commonly used in these three countries to refer to a buddy or good friend, depending on the context.\n\nRodolfo es un buen alero.\n\n(Rodolfo is a good friend.)\n\n2. Amigazo\n\nWhere it’s used: Latin America\n\nSimilar to amigo (friend), the word amigazo is also an informal reference to a buddy, pal or close friend.\n\nHowever, you wouldn’t want to use this word in Chile, where it normally means bad company.\n\nAntonio, sos un amigazo.\n\n(Antonio, you’re a great friend.)\n\n3. Acere / Asere\n\nWhere it’s used: Cuba\n\nOriginating from the African-Efik language, this is the most popular word used in Cuba to refer to a friend or buddy. It’s also used by men to refer to other men.\n\nAsere, ¿qué bolá?\n\n(What’s up, buddy?)\n\n4. Boludo\n\nWhere it’s used: Argentina\n\nEven though the word boludo (idiot) or (jerk) and it’s shorter forms, bolú/bolu, can have different meanings, it’s quite often used when you want to get your friend’s attention.\n\nIt should also be noted that this word can have negative connotations and should only be used in context with your closest friends.\n\n¡Qué quilombo, boludo!\n\n(What a mess, dude!)\n\n5. Bro / Bróder\n\nWhere it’s used: Latin America\n\nAmerican English has had a significant influence on the way people speak Spanish slang in Latin America.\n\nGreat examples are the words bro/bróder (bro), which we’ve accepted as our own.\n\n¿Qué pasó, bróder?\n\n(What’s up, bro?)\n\n6. Cabrón / Cabro\n\nWhere it’s used: Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador\n\nThe word cabrón (bastard) is wildly popular among Spanish learners because it’s harshly used to describe an as*hole or bastard.\n\nThough, in several Spanish-speaking countries, it’s absolutely normal to refer to this word when referencing your buddy.\n\nThe short form cabro (goat) is mainly used in Chile and Costa Rica.\n\n¿Qué pasa, cabrón? ¿Cómo te trata la vida?\n\n(What’s up, buddy? How’s life treating you?)\n\n7. Cachanchán / Canchanchán\n\nWhere it’s used: The Dominican Republic\n\nThe word cachanchán roughly translates to toady or subordinate in Spanish, and that’s exactly how they use it in Cuba.\n\nHowever, if you go to the Dominican Republic, a cachanchán (or, rather, canchanchán, as they pronounce it) refers to a good friend.\n\nAhí viene mi canchanchán, Peralta.\n\n(Here comes my good friend, Peralta.)\n\n8. Camarada\n\nWhere it’s used: Latin America and Spain\n\nThe word camarada (comrade) can be used practically in every Spanish-speaking country to refer to your friends and pals informally.\n\n¿Qué hubo, camarada?\n\n(What’s up, pal?)\n\n9. Carnal\n\nWhere it’s used: Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua\n\nCarnal comes from the word carne (meat, flesh), and it’s used to refer to very close friends.\n\nThe word carnal can also be used with family members (the expression “flesh of my flesh” comes to mind), so a carnal is someone you’d consider family.\n\nSos mi carnal, Mario.\n\n(You’re family, Mario.)\n\n10. Causa\n\nWhere it’s used: Peru\n\nThere are two main theories as to where the word causa, with the casual meaning of friend or buddy, comes from.\n\nOn the one hand, causa formally translates to lawsuit, which would explain why in some parts of Peru this word also refers to thieves.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think it comes from the English word cousin.\n\nWhatever the case, causa is very commonly used to refer to your buddy or friend, so make sure you use it if you ever meet a Peruvian!\n\n¡Habla, causa!\n\n(Hi there, buddy!)\n\n11. Chamo / Chamito\n\nWhere it’s used: Venezuela\n\nVenezuelans use chamo when talking about children and teenagers, but they also use this word to refer to their buddies.\n\n¿Qué hubo, chamo?\n\n(What’s up, buddy?)\n\n12. Che\n\nWhere it’s used: Argentina\n\nThere are very few words more Argentinian than the word che.\n\nYou can use it to refer to your closest friends, your buddies and your colleagues.\n\nThis multipurpose word is so Argentinian that it means Argentinian person in countries such as Mexico and Chile.\n\nHey, che. ¿Qué hacés acá?\n\n(Hey, buddy. What are you doing here?)\n\n13. Chero\n\nWhere it’s used: El Salvador and Honduras\n\nChero comes from the French word cher (dear, beloved), and it’s used to refer to your close friends.\n\nSiempre la paso bien con mis cheros.\n\n(I always have fun with my friends.)\n\n14. Chochera / Choche\n\nWhere it’s used: Peru\n\nThe words Chochera (chauffeur or witchcraft), and its short form choche (car or driver), as you can see, can have two very different meanings.\n\nHow that word came to mean friend in Peruvian Spanish is something I can’t understand, but it does.\n\nPedrito es mi choche desde que teníamos seis años.\n\n(Pedrito has been my friend since we were six.)\n\n15. Cobio\n\nWhere it’s used: Cuba\n\nThere’s not much information available about this word, but all sources agree that it means partner/associate and it’s used on the island to refer to your friends.\n\n¿Qué bolá, cobio?\n\n(How are you doing, friend?)\n\n16. Colega\n\nWhere it’s used: Spain\n\nBy definition, a colega is a classmate or colleague, but it’s informally used to refer to your buddy.\n\nVamos a tomarnos una copas con mi colega, Paco.\n\n(Let’s go have some drinks with my buddy, Paco.)\n\n17. Compadre\n\nWhere it’s used: Latin America (very common in Mexico)\n\nCompadre describes the relationship between someone’s father and godfather (a literal translation from Latin could be co-father.)\n\nHowever, native Mexican speakers use this word to refer to their best mates or good friends.\n\n¿Qué onda, compadre? ¿Por qué tan triste?\n\n(What’s up, mate? Why so sad?)\n\n18. Compañero / Compa / Compi\n\nWhere it’s used: Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Argentina, Costa Rica and Honduras\n\nEvery native Spanish speaker will understand the word compañero or any of its short forms.\n\nIt officially translates to (partner or companion), but it can also be used to refer to your pals/buddies, as well.\n\nIf you’re in Spain though, avoid using the longer and shorter forms, since they can be taken out of context in some regions.\n\nMi cõmpanero Luis está por llegar.\n\n(My buddy Luis is about to arrive.)\n\n19. Compinche\n\nWhere it’s used: Latin America and Spain\n\nThe word compinche translates, and is used informally, to refer to your pals or buddies.\n\n¿Qué pasó, compinche?\n\n(What’s up, buddy?)\n\n20. Cuaderno\n\nWhere it’s used: Mexico\n\nIf someone from Mexico tells you they’re meeting their cuadernos (notebooks) in the evening, don’t think they’ve gone crazy. Cuaderno is actually a very popular way to refer to a friend in the country.\n\nJuan y Marco son mis cuadernos.\n\n(Juan and Marco are my friends.)\n\n21. Cuadro\n\nWhere it’s used: Colombia\n\nMany people in the world have cuadros (tables), but only Colombians will call their bros, buddies and friends the same word.\n\n¿Quiubo, cuadro?\n\n(What’s up, bro?)\n\n22. Cuate\n\nWhere it’s used: Mexico, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Bolivia and Venezuela\n\nCuate quite literally translates to buddy or dude.\n\nHowever, it can also be used to refer to people you don’t know or are just acquaintances.\n\nVendrá con un cuate mañana.\n\n(He’ll come with a buddy tomorrow.)\n\n23. Cúmbila\n\nWhere it’s used: Cuba\n\nCúmbila is another Cuban word of African origin.\n\nIt comes from the term camba (friend), and it’s used to refer to your buddies.\n\nGracias, cúmbila.\n\n(Thanks, buddy.)\n\n24. Fren\n\nWhere it’s used: Panama\n\nThe word fren is almost exclusively used in Panama, and it means—you’ve guessed it—friend.\n\nEs mi fren desde 2015.\n\n(She’s been my friend since 2015.)\n\n25. Gomía\n\nWhere it’s used: Argentina\n\nGomía is an anagram that results from transposing the word amigo.\n\nNot surprisingly, it’s another word you can use casually to refer to your friends.\n\n¡Ese es mi gomía!\n\n(That’s my man!)\n\n26. Güey\n\nWhere it’s used: Mexico\n\nThanks to Mexican TV shows and telenovelas, every Spanish speaker knows the word güey, and now you do, too!\n\nIt originally comes from the word buey (ox), so it’s no surprise it can also be used with the meaning of silly or clumsy.\n\nAdditionally, it can be used to refer to anyone you don’t know very well (similar to the English word dude) and even to a friend, depending on the context.\n\n¡Órale, güey!\n\n(Come on, dude!)\n\n27. Huevón\n\nWhere it’s used: Chile and Peru (less frequently in Venezuela)\n\nThe word huevón and all its different forms—weón/weon/won/güevón/güebón—literally translates to big egg.\n\nInformally, it can be used to describe someone who is lazy, a moron or stupid, but it can also be used jokingly to refer to your buddies. It also has a meaning very close to the English dude or guy.\n\nHola, huevón. ¿Cómo estái?\n\n(Hey, buddy. How are you?)\n\n28. Íntimo\n\nWhere it’s used: Latin América and Spain\n\nThe word íntimo is an adjective that means intimate/close.\n\nÍntimo normally appears in the collocation amigo íntimo (close friend).\n\nThis collocation is often reduced to just the adjective, which is used to refer to your closest friends.\n\nAntonio es mi íntimo, mi hermano.\n\n(Antonio is my close friend, my brother.)\n\n29. Llave\n\nWhere it’s used: Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela\n\nLlave quite literally translates to key in Spanish. Yes, the thing you use to open doors.\n\nIt’s said that if someone calls you their llave, they’ve opened themselves to you and accepted you as their friend.\n\nTodo bien, mi llave.\n\n(No problem, my friend.)\n\n30. Mae\n\nWhere it’s used: Costa Rica\n\nThe word mae is to Costa Rica as güey is to Mexico.\n\nIn other words, you can use mae to refer to friends, buddies and people you don’t even know. Context is key!\n\n¿Cómo estás, mae?\n\n(How you doin’, bud?)\n\n31. Mano / Manito\n\nWhere it’s used: Latin America\n\nThe words mano (hand) and manito (little hand) are the shortened forms of the word hermano (brother).\n\nThey’re used to casually and informally describe a friend or bro.\n\nEven though you’ll hear these words all throughout Latin America, the forms mano and manito are especially common in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic and Panama.\n\n¿Qué hubo, manito?\n\n(What’s up, bro?)\n\n32. Ñaño\n\nWhere it’s used: Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and some parts of Argentina\n\nBy definition, this word means year.\n\nHowever, it’s also used to define a close friend in some countries, similar to the context and usage of the word bróder (bro).\n\n¿Qué tal, ñaño?\n\n(What’s up, bro?)\n\n33. Pana\n\nWhere it’s used: Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Honduras and Nicaragua\n\nThere are several theories about the origin of the word pana (corduroy), but the one I like the most is that it comes from the indigenous word panaca (family).\n\nFor this reason, the word pana is normally only used with your deepest and closest soul friends.\n\nJuanito, sos mi pana del alma.\n\n(Juanito, you’re my soul mate.)\n\n34. Panadería\n\nWhere it’s used: Venezuela\n\nIn Venezuela, a panadería (bakery) isn’t only a place where you can buy bread and pastries. It’s also a place where you can meet your friends for a coffee or a piece of cake.\n\nBecause of this, it started to become a slang term for friends/friendship in the ’50s, and it’s kept its meaning until today.\n\n¡Gracias a toda mi panadería!\n\n(Thanks to all my friends!)\n\n35. Parcero / Parce\n\nWhere it’s used: Colombia and Ecuador\n\nThe words parcero (landlord) and parce come from the Portuguese word parceiro (partner).\n\nIt’s normally used to refer to your friends and acquaintances, but it can also be used to talk about people from the same region/country (compatriot/fellow countryman).\n\n¿Quiubo, parce?\n\n(What’s up, friend?)\n\n36. Pata\n\nWhere it’s used: Bolivia, Cuba, Peru and Chile\n\nThe definition of a pata oddly translates to leg and paw, but in these four countries, it refers to a close friend or a buddy, depending on the context.\n\nCarola es mi pata del alma.\n\n(Carola is my best friend/my soul mate).\n\n37. Pez\n\nWhere it’s used: Colombia\n\nYou probably know pez means fish in Spanish.\n\nHowever, in Colombia, people use this word to refer to their friends and buddies informally (especially if they don’t know their name).\n\n¿Todo bien, mi pez?\n\n(Is everything alright, buddy?)\n\n38. Pibe\n\nWhere it’s used: Uruguay (less frequently in Argentina and Paraguay)\n\nEven though this word can be used in some countries to refer to kids, people in Uruguay also use it to refer to their friends.\n\nVamos a festejar con mi pibes.\n\n(Let’s celebrate with my friends.)\n\n39. Primo\n\nWhere it’s used: Mexico, Venezuela (West), the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\n\nPrimo means cousin in Spanish. By calling someone your primo, you’re letting them know they’re your dearest friend, and part of your family.\n\n¿Cómo ‘tá la cosa, primo?\n\n(How’s everything going, dear friend?)\n\n40. Socio\n\nWhere it’s used: Peru and Colombia (less frequently in Cuba, Ecuador and Argentina)\n\nThe word socio refers to a partner or business associate, but it’s also used to refer to your close friends in countries like Peru and Colombia.\n\nHola, socio. ¿Cómo estás?\n\n(Hey, friend. How are you?)\n\n41. Tío\n\nWhere it’s used: Spain\n\nTío translates to (uncle) in Spanish, but if you go to Spain, you’ll mainly hear this word when people are referring to their mates.\n\nIt can also be used to refer to a guy in general, just like Mexico’s güey.\n\nMi tío no sabe de lo que habla.\n\n(My mate doesn’t know what he’s talking about.)\n\n42. Tronco / Tron\n\nWhere it’s used: Spain\n\nA tronco is a tree trunk and tron is a log. But in Spain, it refers to a very good friend.\n\nIt’s often incorrectly associated with lower-class people, but all youngsters use it.\n\nIt can also be used to refer to your boyfriend/girlfriend, but some people may tell you it sounds a bit distasteful, so avoid using it in this context if you can.\n\nMi tronca está de camino.\n\n(My good friend is on her way.)\n\n43. Valedor / Vale\n\nWhere it’s used: Colombia and Venezuela\n\nSimply put, a valedor is a person that is worthy.\n\nIt’s possible that because of this reason, a friend is referred to as a valedor(es) or vale(s) in these two countries.\n\nMi valedor, ¿cómo estás?\n\n(My friend, how are you?)\n\n44. Viejo\n\nWhere it’s used: Costa Rica, Argentina\n\nThe word viejo (old), can also be an informal way to refer to someone’s dad.\n\nIt can also mean bro or friend in Costa Rica and some parts of Argentina. But practically every native Spanish speaker will understand you’re referring to a friend if you use it anywhere else.\n\nViejo, no hables paja.\n\n(Bro, don’t talk nonsense.)\n\n45. Yunta\n\nWhere it’s used: Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Peru, Chile and Bolivia\n\nThe word yunta is translated into English as yoke and/or team, but in South America it’s used to refer to a trusted friend.\n\nAna es mi yunta.\n\n(Ana is my trusted friend.)\n\nSo, there you have it, my top list of 45 slang words to call your friends in Spanish. You can find more slang vocabulary and hear these in use on the FluentU program.\n\nThey’re not used in every Spanish-speaking country, but now you know how to refer to all your amigos (friends) based on the country you have your heart after.\n\nStay curious, cheros (friends), and as always, happy Spanish learning!"
