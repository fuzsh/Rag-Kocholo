The long-running hit group is shown (top photo) above receiving two RIAA-certified gold platters for their last two IP’s, “All Summer Long\" and “Beach Boys Concert,” from Alan W. Livingston, president of Capitol. No strangers to the singles field, of course, the boys are currently making the grade with “Do You Wanna Dance\" and “Please Let Me Wonder.” The quintet (left to right: Al Jardine, Carl and Dennis Wilson, Mike Love and Brian Wilson) is led by Brian Wilson, who supplies the team with most of its hit songs (his BMI Awards total for 1964 was 7, the most of any writer). Last week, the label released a new set by the crew, “The Beach Boys Today,” for which Brian penned nine of the 1 1 selections. The bottom shot shows the team in various spots during a European jaunt.

George Bernard Shaw once com- mented that the greatest difference between the U.S. and England was a common language. The aim of Shaw’s wit was certainly true when applied to pop music on disks, where, despite an essentially common language, it had been rough crossing on the Atlantic either way for the acceptance of disk product on the vocal level. The Beatles, et al, have taken care of this problem. For the past several years both the U.S. and English mar- kets are speaking exactly the same language business-wise. We needn’t go into the current, complex business arrangements that have practically made song and disk dealings between the two nations a “subway World Se- ries.\" But, events of immense Interest do keep occurring to further pin-point not merely a strengthening of musical ties, but, in a real sense, a merging of the two music markets. The British Best Seller List, for in- stance, has become a virtually infal- lible barometer of disks that are likely to make chart headway In the U.S. Ever on the look-out for new material to program, radio stations are looking at the British charts and are going to the expense of flying In hit English product to spotlight on U.S. radio. Just recently, this procedure forced the Kapp and Epic labels to issue Searchers and Dave Clark Five singles even with the knowledge that recent releases by the groups had just begun a chart climb here (fortunately, Eng- lish disk stars have proved that the teeners will sustain two concurrent single releases by a hot attraction). So strong is the prospect of a hit English side repeating its original success here that American labels — with few exceptions — don’t bother to cover that disk with their own, homegrown performers. While, as mentioned above, count- less business arrangements have brought product to both sides of the ocean, there seems to have been little done to coordinate the activities of the parties involved. It’s one thing to have the rights to a given artist for a terri- tory; it’s another matter to be aware of what disk doings are going on for that artist In his home area. Being forced — happily forced in most In- stances — to accommodate the mar- ket with a rush release of an artist can be costly for a label and result in ad- ministrative confusion within its ranks. U.S. labels and those with which they deal with abroad must see to It that they are well Informed on upcoming disk activities by mutually shared per- formers. The firms may be separate entities, but the artists they release in their respective areas give them a great common denominator. Effective, efficient and knowledgeable marketing of such product will mean greater profits for both parties.

Livingston Makes Strong Pitch For Uniform Auto Tape System .(HOLLYWOOD — ^Looking ahead to- tion. . ward wide-spread enjoyment of mu- sic on tape in autos, Alan Livingston, \"3; president of Capitol Records, is out to nip a sort of “battle of the speeds” J in the bud. j( In a letter to major auto and re- cording equipment manufacturers, the exec has called for the creation of “an industry-wide approach to the immediate development of one stand- ard automobile stereo-tape playback system.” Among those who received Living- ston’s letter late last month were chief execs and representatives of General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Gen- eral Electric, Motorola, Lear-Siegler, Philco, Westinghouse and Zenith. Re- plies received to date indicate, Capitol reports, wide-spread concern over the problem and general agreement vdth Mr. Livingston’s approach to a solu- “At the present time,” Livingston said, “there are a number of manu- facturers who are beginning to pro- duce a variety of different automobile tape-cartridge systems. Unless an agreement is reached on a uniform auto-tape system, we run the risk of another ‘battle of the speeds.’ ” Livingston’s major concern is that if each manufacturer develops his own tape system, they will be incom- patible with each other. “Before this happens,” he urged, “we should defin- itely have a meeting of the minds to discuss this new market.” One of his suggestions was to turn the matter over to RIAA engineering committee (Capitol’s Ed Uecke, administrator of recording operations and director of development engineering, is president (Continued on page 37) WINS^ A Top Rock Outlet^ Coing All-Talk NEW YORK— Radio station WINS, currently a major outlet for singles’ sounds in New York, is switching to on all news format. The switch, which has taken the New York music scene by surprise, will take place on April 19, and will entail the station’s 24 hours a day, seven days a week programming. One New York promo man was probably speaking for the entire New York trade when he said, “This has got to hurt.” He went on to explain that of all Top 40 radio stations in Gotham, WINS is where “you can start a record,” meaning that the programming schedules of the others (e.g. WMCA and ABC) generally go along with established disks. WINS is part of the Westinghouse group of radio stations that also in- cludes such strong Top 40 outlets as KYW-Cleveland; WBZ-Boston; and KDKA-Pittsburgh. The dee jay staff of WINS consists of Jack Lacey and Stan Z. Burns, two veterans at the station, and new- comers Joel Sebastian and Ken Gar- land. Murray the K (Kaufman), WINS’ biggest teen attraction, re- cently left the station. WINS started in-depth news re- porting at the time of its purchase by Westinghouse in 1962. Since that time, the station has received a num- ber of awards for the quality of its news coverage. Under the new set-up, Joel Chase- man remains as general manager, and Stan Brooks continues as news director. RIAA Artist Panel At NAB Confab NEW YORK— The Record Industry Association of America, continuing to establish stronger music industry ties with the nation’s broadcasters, will be on hand at this week’s con- vention of the National Association of Broadcasters at the Shoreham Ho- tel in Washington, D. C. (March 21-24). RIAA participation will take the form of sponsoring a panel discussion among recording artists representing various musical tastes. Panelists are Stan Kenton (jazz), Morton Gould (classics and semi-clas- sics), Gene Pitney (pop) and LeRoy Van Dyke (country). They will dis- cuss the music business in general and its relations with the radio & TV industry. Moderator will be Henry Brief, exec secretary of the RIAA. The discussion will take place on Tues. (23) at 11 a.m. at the Shore- ham. RIAA began to take part at NAB confabs several years ago. Last year. Brief offered the broadcasters a de- tailed talk-slide presentation on the music industry. RIAA has also been attending various regional meets of NAB, the next one due sometime this fall. In other activities directly involv- ing the music business, the NAB’s radio and TV committee will discuss the broadcasting industry and its re- lationship with the performing rights societies. Also, SESAC will be hosting a Discotheque Party during the conven- tion. The party will be held at the company’s hospitality suite in the Shoreham Hotel and will feature vo- calist Anita Bryant as its “ambassa- dress of goodwill.” Also to be featured at the conven- tion is the industry release of SESAC’s new “Pacemakers For Drive Time” LP, which has already been sold in approximately 110 markets throughout the U.S. and Canada. The package, highlighted in a special Montana Performance Fee Bill In Hands Of Gov. NEW YORK— The state of Montana fa^ed a blackout of music cleared by ASCAP and BMI last week as the societies made it clear that perform- ances of their material would end in the state if a bill to regulate per- formance fees became law. The bill has already passed the House and Senate of Montana, and was set to be acted upon by Gov. Tim Babcock last Fri. (19). By sign- ing the bill, the Gov. could make it law; a pocket veto would result if he ignored it. Besides its regulatory provision, the bill would also require ASCAP and BMI to register their copyrights with the state at a fee of 24 a song. ASCAP and BMI, deeply competi- tive as they are, are in complete agreement that the bill is against the best interests of their members. In a strong letter to Montana broadcasters. Bob Burton, president of BMI, declared that the society was ready to pull its catalog out of Mon- tana and would immediately institute copyright infringement suits — which could mean a reward of $250 per infringement — if the bill makes it on the books. edition of SESAC Music publication, consists of 8 recordings with more than 100 tunes, designed for program- ming during the heavily commercial commuter hours. Artists included in the series are Duke Ellington, Larry Elgart. Count Basie, Si Zentner, Woody Herman, Terry Gibbs. Warren Covington, Kai Winding, Marian McPartland and others. List Opening Bill For Paramount’s “Live” Re-Opening NEW YORK — The bill-of-fare for the first “live” presentation at the New York Paramount Theater sponsored by Morris Levy has been announced. Levy recently worked out a deal with the present landlord of the showcase to re-open it and present a series of star in-person attractions. For his first effort, a 10 day stint during the Easter Holidays, Levy, president of Roulette Records, has taken a cue from the Top 100 with such acts as the Detergents, the Ex- citers, Shirley Ellis, the Hullaballoos, and the Kinks. Also set are Little Richard, the Vibrations and Dee Dee Warwick, all with solid chart ex- perience. TV comedian Soupy Sales, whose local kiddie shows have attracted a strong audience among hipsters, will be the show’s headliner. Supporting instrumental sounds will stem from the King Curtis Orchestra. The package will present continu- ous daily performances starting April 16 at popular prices, with a flick presentation between each perform- ance. \"Diversify\" & \"Promote\" Key Words At Mills Music NEW YORK — The two big words in Mills Music’s business vocabulary are “diversification” and “promotion.” Pubbery, which recently underwent a realignment of personnel with its purchase by Utilities & Industries, is out to grab a bigger share of the current market, according to Stanley Mills, recently named general pro- fessional manager of the company. Mills is keeping his door open to writers (on a non-exclusive basis) of all types of pop music. In addition, the firm is eyeing material from abroad. Recent acquisitions in the latter area include such recently cut items as “I Forgot To Forget” by Kay Starr (Capitol), from France’s Tutti music company; “Last Fare- well” by Bill Justis (Smash), from Germany’s Rolf Budde; and “Star Of Love” by the Jack Gold Orchestra (Ascot), from England’s Lawrence Wright; and “Tell Another Lie” by Connie Smith (to appear in the country performer’s upcoming LP (Continued on page 37) Cash Box — March 27, 1965 7 David Houston The Ballad of the Fool KiUer’ 5-9782 (Inspired by the Ely Landau Production “The Fool Killer.’’) A great new release by the nation’s fastest rising C & W artist. ^iiSsu: SSBiSSsai S' EPIC\", ►arcs Bcj.

THE AMERICAN ^MDOJV GROUP THE AMERICAN ^JWON GROUP •k m ^ Cash Box— March 27, 1965 Trustees Named For Nat Cole Cancer Fund HOLLYWOOD — In her first meeting with newsmen since the death of her husband on Feb. 15, Mrs. Maria Cole last week discussed the formation of the Nat Cole Cancer Foundation and announced the board of trustees. This board will include Mrs. Richard Rodgers, Mrs. Nonnan Chandler, Glenn Wallichs, Sidney Poitier, Frankie Laine, Walter O’Malley, James Conkling and Mrs. Cole. This board will make decisions on the management and dispersement of funds received. These funds will be used for research in the battle against cancer. The foundation was established by a $10,000 contribution from Capitol Records, to which the late singer was under contract for two decades. Contributions have, according to Mrs. Cole, been coming in from all over the United States. Plans are now under way for a number of fund raising activities leading off with a television special to be produced by Nick Vanoff and Bill Harbach with all proceeds going to the foundation. For those wishing to make contri- butions Mrs. Cole announced that mail may be addressed to Nat Cole Cancer Foundation, Hollywood, Calif. 90028.

AM-5:00 PM iilllillllliiillliilllliliH Gash Box PLATTER SPINNER PATTER Mar. 21 was the kickoff date for an all-out fund-raising campaign launched by the New York Associ- ation for Brain-Injured Children, with WTFM’s Bryce Bond handling the radio-TV chairman functions. Brain injury is reportedly the number one affliction of children and has nearly 100,000 victims in the city, 230,000 in the state and 3,000,000 in the nation. The drive will be in gear for three months and will receive the backing of Mayor Robert Wagner and Gov- ernor Nelson Rockefeller. Good luck to Bond and all others concerned. A giant step across the country takes us to the city by the bay where KABL-San Francisco held a benefit for the AID Retarded Children, Inc., in the form of the station’s second annual St. Patrick’s Day Snake Race. A $5 entry fee donated to the non- profit organization qualified the local vipers (non-poisonous) to vie for top honors in the reptilean regata which was held in a special glass-enclosed racetrack at the station’s offices on Commercial St. The grand prize for the speediest slitherer was the Golden Fang Trophy Award engraved on a bronze plaque, plus a year’s free dinners, while the winner’s owner re- ceived a cash prize of $50. Norman Blanchett, a professional snake han- dler, was on the scene as the official handler and the station held a small supply of asps on hand for those who wished to enter (humans) but lacked entries ( reptiles ) . “Neither rain nor sleet nor snow . . can keep WOWO-Ft Wayne off the airwaves. When a recent knee- deep snowstorm held 467 schools and school systems in the area scoreless, the undaunted broadcaster kept right on knocking out the hits. The blitz, which closed factories, stores, clubs and institutions in 80 cities through- out Indiana, Ohio and Michigan saw several of the station’s staff trudging through the white maelstrom while a station jeep performed a shuttle serv- ice for other key personnel (The jeep also served as an ambulance for a heart attack victim). Getting to work seemed not as difficult as getting from work, as all those who arrived re- mained at the studios for two days. While blankets of snow were bring- ing on the chills and shivers in some areas, KEX-Portland, Oregon’s Bar- ney Keep and his Biscuit Burner along with 43 of his faith following finally finished a fun-filled fiesta in the sunny climes of Hawaii. This marks the third year in a row that the station, in conjunction with Churchill Tours, has conducted the week-long leisurely jaunt to the balmy Pacific Isles. . . . From the sunny scene it’s reported that the attendance record at Honolulu’s Waikiki Shell was broken when 9,750 fans filled the club’s coffers to see station KPOI’s first “Blastoff.” The show, produced by the broadcaster’s Tom Moffatt and Tom Rounds, con- sisted of 20 teen groups aiming for a Grand Prix of $1,500 and a Warner Bros. /Reprise recording contract. The same station is also reputed to have set a single night attendance high at the town’s new International Center with 14,000 paid admissions. Back in the continental sunshine WFUN-Miami is giving away $1,000 in greenbacks to any listener keen enough to catch the station’s spinners playing any selection which is not a “documented” hit, with the exception of “hits of tomorrow.” Challenges will appear before the musical control committee which then must produce documented proof of the popularity of a platter in question. A sharp listener can rake in the thousand-dollar jack- pot while a challenger who goofs is subject to pay the piper with such “penalties” as parading in sandwich signs which advertise the station’s faultlessness or continuously record- ing station slogans for several hours. In our Mar. 6 column we stated that a recent Pulse survey showed KYA to be the number one station in San Francisco. According to a note received from station KSFO, it, and not the aforementioned broadcaster, is the top audience-attractor in the bay area. Sorry for our faux pas.

The performance was marked by a mag- netism born of vigorous styling which held the audience captivated from the opening number through the conclud- ing series of freedom songs. One of the highlights of the evening’s enter- tainment was the folk-blues artist’s reading of several Bob Dylan tunes, which brought about a tremendous re- action from the listeners, thus boding well for her newest album from RCA Victor, “Odetta Sings Dylan.” . . .

Undercut, “Betrayed,” which is taken from the crew’s “Entertain You” LP is a pulsating, teen-oriented romantic triangle heart-throbber. Pick of the Week OUT IN THE STREETS (2:39) [Trio & Tender, BMI— Barry, Greenwich] THE BOY (2:10) [Trio & Tender, BMI— Morton] SHANGRI-LAS (Red Bird 10025) The gals, who are presently coming off their “Give Him A Great Big Kiss” triumph, are a cinch to repeat that success with this top-rung follow-up labeled “Out In The Streets.” The tune, a departure from the trio’s previous hit formula, is an interestingly oflp-beat, melodic, multi- 1 tracked ode all about a real lone wolf type of guy.

The coupler is a fast-moving hot rod ditty with an infectious swingin’ under- current. “. . . AND ROSES AND ROSES” (2:24) [Ipanema, ASCAP — Gilbert, Caymmi] MY CAROUSEL (2:25) [Noelle, BMI— K. & Y. Rankin] ANDY WILLIAMS (Columbia 43257) The chanter’s outrageously successful ways should certainly continue with this new odds-on choice for Top 10 honors called “. . .

Flip, “ ’Til I Met You,” is a pretty, low-key bluesey ballad sold with loads of poise by the crew.
