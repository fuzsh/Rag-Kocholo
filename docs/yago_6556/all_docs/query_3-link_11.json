        "text": "Danny Trejo is an American actor. His filmography consists of about 250 film and television roles.[1] His prominence in the B movie scene has resulted in disparate media sources referring to Trejo as an \"iconic actor\" and a \"film legend\", among other titles.[2][3]\n\nTrejo's film career began in 1985, when he \"accidentally\" landed a role in Runaway Train, playing a boxer for a daily fee of $320. Prior to that, Trejo had served time in prison on multiple occasions and worked as a drug counsellor after his release. Trejo credits the first film in which he was given a proper credited role as Art Sanella in Death Wish 4: The Crackdown.[4] He went on to star in a multitude of other films, including Desperado, From Dusk till Dawn, Con Air, Reindeer Games, and Grindhouse, among others.[5]\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Trejo appeared in the Robert Rodriguez-directed Spy Kids franchise as Isador \"Machete\" Cortez, in the films Spy Kids, Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams and Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over. He also voiced Uncle Machete in the video game Spy Kids: Mega Mission Zone. In 2007, Trejo reprised his role in a fictional trailer in Grindhouse, also directed by Rodriguez; subsequently, in 2010, Trejo reprised his role as Machete in a spin-off exploitation film of the same name as the protagonist, also directed by Rodriguez. The character is cited as his \"first major film role\".[6] Subsequently, Trejo reprised his role as Machete in Spy Kids: All the Time in the World, with the success of Machete also resulting in a direct sequel, Machete Kills, with Trejo once again reprising his role.[1] Trejo has been cast in many television programmes, including Baywatch, where he portrayed different characters for different episodes.[7] Outside of film and television appearances, Trejo has also been featured in a handful of music videos, including the video for Dustin Tavella's \"Everybody Knows (Douchebag)\".[8] He voiced the characters Umberto Robina for the video games Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, himself in Def Jam: Fight for NY (2004), Raul Tejada in Fallout: New Vegas, Trainer Duke in The Fight: Lights Out, himself in Call of Duty: Black Ops and Call of The Dead and Call of Duty Black Ops 4: Blackout and also himself in Far Cry 6: Danny and Dani vs. Everybody, and SCUM, among others.[7]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Note(s) Ref(s) 1983 Project A Lo Sam Pau Voice role 1985 Runaway Train Boxer Credited as Daniel Trejo\n\nAlso uncredited boxing coach: Eric Roberts[4][9] 1987 Bulletproof Sharkey [10] Penitentiary III See Veer [9][11]: 327- The Hidden Prisoner [12]: 1180 Death Wish 4: The Crackdown Art Sanella [4][9] 1989 Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects Prison Inmate [7] Lock Up Chink's Gang Member [11]: 257- Cage Costello's Bodyguard Uncredited [7] Bail Out 'Mean' Direct-to-video [7] 1990 Maniac Cop 2 Prisoner [13]: 110- Marked for Death Hector [7] Guns 'Tong' [7] 1991 Wedlock Tough Prisoner #1 [7] Femme Fatale Toshi [7] The Last Hour 'Spider' [7] Whore Tattoo Artist [14] Carnal Crimes Chandra the Ticket Agent Direct-to-video [15] Lonely Hearts Angry Client [7] By The Sword Assistant: Mr. Roberts) 1992 Sex Crimes Palmer 1993 Doppelganger Hard Hat [7] Blood In Blood Out 'Geronimo' [7] Sunset Grill Young Mexican [12]: 1053- Mi Vida Loca Frank [16] Love, Cheat & Steal Cuban [7] 1994 Angel of Desire Construction worker [7] Victor One Sergeant Aguilar 1995 The Stranger Hawk Direct-to-video [7] Dead Badge El Tango Bartender [7] Desperado Navajas [7] Heat Trejo [9][17] 1996 From Dusk till Dawn Charlie 'Razor Charlie' [5][9] Le Jaguar Kumare [7] 1997 Anaconda Poacher [18] Champions Max Brito [19] Con Air Johnny 'Johnny 23' Baca [5] Full Tilt Boogie Himself Documentary Trojan War 'Scarface' [7] Los Locos Manuel Batista [7] Dilemma Rudy Salazar [7] Sepultura: We Are What We Are Boxer Documentary short 1998 The Replacement Killers Collins [7] Point Blank Wallace [7] Six Days, Seven Nights Pierce [20] Soundman Duce's Father [21] An Eye for Talent Fred Short film 1999 From Dusk till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money 'Razor Eddie' Direct-to-video [13]: 621- Inferno Johnny 6 Toes [22] Whiteboyz Prisoner Uncredited From Dusk till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter 'Razor Charlie' Direct-to-video [7] Six Shots of Tequila 2000 Animal Factory Vito Also co-producer [23] Reindeer Games 'Jumpy' [7] Settled Account Hijacker #1 Credited as Daniel Trejo 2001 Skippy Hitman [7] Spy Kids Isador \"Machete\" Cortez [24] Bubble Boy 'Slim' [25] 2002 Simpilicity Barber Short film 13 Moons Hoodlum #2 [24] The Salton Sea Bill 'Little Bill' [26] Do It for Uncle Manny Pedro [7] Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams Isador \"Machete\" Cortez Cameo [27] XXX 'El Jefe' [28] Beat the Devil Bob Short film [7] Nightstalker Officer Frank Luis Also co-producer [29] Hiding in Walls Jose Short film 2003 Film is Dead: An Evening with Robert Rodriguez Himself Video documentary short [27] The Big Empty Lt.
