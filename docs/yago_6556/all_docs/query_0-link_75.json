Gordon\n\nI\n\nn 1965, when beginning my career as a research scientist, I published what was then a controversial essay review of the then-extant research literature on socially disadvantaged children (Gordon, 1965). I asserted what was at that time a “progressive” perspective by avoiding reference to such children as “culturally deprived.” But because I was writing about the research findings available at that time, I could not avoid reporting the prevailing view that these children were different in many ways from children whose characteristics were considered normative. However, the burden of my review was to reflect the consensus that socially disadvantaged children were essentially deficient in most of the characteristics that mattered. That modest suggestion of difference somehow gained traction, and within 10 years the widely held perspective had shifted from cultural deprivation and generalized deficiency to different, and then to diverse. There was perhaps an element of political correctness in this change in perspective. Certainly it better reflects the fact that the characteristics of children who have been placed at risk of academic failure by some of their life conditions include many highly adaptive features and behaviors, but it also tends to hide or ignore the fact that academic cultures are specialized cultures that require and reward specialized, developed abilities. Life conditions and circumstances that do not enable and encourage the development of those specialized abilities tend to produce children who are deficient in the ability to handle academic work. We know in the 21st century that the absence of\n\nix\n\nx Foreword\n\na certain developed ability because of the absence of opportunity to learn should not be interpreted as absence of ability to learn, and that the recognition of the fact of diverse human characteristics demands accommodation and differentiation in pedagogical treatment. In some circumstances, improved life circumstances are required. It is a source of shame that our society has moved slowly to achieve the necessary accommodations and differentiations in educational treatments, and has essentially avoided serious effort at providing improved circumstances of life for our most seriously socially disadvantaged children and those whose variance from colloquial norms is significant. It is the society’s good fortune that some of us have taken seriously the need for accommodation and differentiation in the teaching and learning transactions made available to diverse populations of students. The authors of the chapters in this handbook are among the growing number of educators who have engaged the need to adapt educational treatments to some of the diverse characteristics of learners who present themselves to our schools. In contrast to the article with which I began almost 50 years ago, these author-educators are not primarily concerned with documenting deficits but are thoughtfully and skillfully addressing the problems of accommodation and differentiation, without ignoring the fact that academic achievement and its derivative correlate, intellective competence, require some developed abilities that the life conditions of some of these children have not enabled them to achieve. The ideas and practices advanced in this book do not provide perfect solutions: Human learning, especially academic learning, is a complex process that pedagogical science cannot fully explain. Robert Schaeffer, for many years Dean of Faculty at Columbia University’s Teachers College, once described teaching as a process of inquiry. But I think such chapter titles as “What Do We Know about the Discourse Patterns of Diverse Students in Multiple Settings?,” “Engaging Diverse Students in Multiple Literacies in and Out of School,” “Roles of Engagement, Valuing, and Identification in Reading Development of Students from Diverse Backgrounds,” and “Teacher Knowledge in Culturally and Linguistically Complex Classrooms: Lessons from the Golden Age and Beyond” point us in the right direction so long as we remember that a discrete learner-characteristics-oriented pedagogy (English learner, socially disadvantaged, impoverished, learning disabled, etc.) may itself be insufficient. Learners bring more than the specific characteristics by which they can be identified to the teaching and learning situation. Rather, they come to school with a rich combination of both status and functional characteristics that constantly interact and sometimes change. Optimal interventions require the skillful orchestration of a comprehensive complex of interventions that go beyond the classroom practices. I am increasingly persuaded that effective academic learning is more likely to occur in the presence of exquisite orchestrations that exploit and enhance the complementarities between the learning and teaching opportunities that occur outside of schools, and the appropriate and sufficient teaching and learning transactions that occur in schools. Whether in school or out of school, complementar-\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nity should be the guiding principle. What is required is that teaching and learning transactions out of school must complement those that occur in school, and wherever the teaching and learning occur, these transactions should complement the characteristics of the learning person. Such sophisticated pedagogy can make every child into a visible and productive learner. The work that follows in this book can help us achieve those ends.\n\nReference Gordon, E. W. (1965).

A special focus of the volume is on issues of diversity, policy, and equity as they impact research, theory, and practice in literacy. Attention to these issues must be a top priority if national and state goals for closing the reading achievement gap are to be accomplished (International Reading Association, 2002). This is a daunting task, because students today more than ever need to be literate to succeed in the workplace. At the same time, there is clear evidence that the achievement of all children has not been equal. More than half of all American students score below proficiency in reading (National Assessment of Educational Progress, 2005). Ample evidence indicates a growing achievement gap in reading and math between (1) minority and nonminority students, (2) those from economically poorer and richer families, (3) students whose native language is English and those whose first language is not English, and (4) students identified for special education services and those in regular education. Nationally reported data point to four conclusions: (1) There are differences in the emerging literacy knowledge and performance of young children entering kindergarten from various racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds; (2) the gap is greater for children who enter school with a combination of risk factors (e.g., mothers with less education, living in a single-­parent family, whether the family receives welfare benefits, and whether the primary language spoken in the home is not English); (3) by grade 4, there is a significant discrepancy between the reading comprehension proficiency of European American, non-­Hispanic students and their African American and Hispanic peers, and this discrepancy continues through grade 12; and (4) these gaps have been stable for more than a decade. Research has documented stable differences over time between kindergarten and\n\n1\n\n2 Introduction\n\ngrade 7 (Tabors, Snow, & Dickinson, 2001) and between first grade and the end of high school (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997); therefore, as time progresses, it becomes increasingly more difficult to undo the “failure to read” syndrome (Al Otaiba & Fuchs, 2002). Concern about issues of diversity, policy, and equity has traditionally been viewed as a problem in urban and in poor rural districts. However, as the diversity in our country continues to grow daily, the preparation of all teachers must focus on developing proficiency in dealing with language diversity, cultural diversity, policy concerns, and equity (Lapp, Flood, & Chou, 2008; Leland & Harste, 2005; Weiner, 2006).\n\nThe Policy of No Child Left Behind: Putting Reading First Although it is very controversial, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) is the principal national legislative policy response to the illiteracy crisis in the United States and the problem of the failure to read proficiently. It is strongly driven by the recognition that illiteracy can no longer be tolerated as an inevitable state for too many groups of American students. NCLB also represents a departure from past national policy for low-­income parents in the education of their children. Parents now have a wider array of educational choices, including public charter schools, and, depending on the academic progress of their children’s school, the choice of external supplemental services. If children consistently fail in a given school, NCLB may include sanctions such as reorganization of that institution. Although there are countless problems with NCLB, it heightens awareness about our illiteracy problems; it stresses professional development of teachers and accountability; and it involves parents in decision making.\n\nIssues Related to Teacher Quality Two important features of NCLB underscore the importance of instruction. First is the emphasis on having well-­qualified teachers instructing all students, especially those at risk for school failure. Second is the emphasis on instructional practice based on educational research, that is, evidence-based practice. Well­qualified teachers and related educational specialists are essential both for early identification of students who have difficulty with early reading requirements and for tailoring reading instruction that results in mastery and continued achievement. One consequence of this legislation is that states and school districts are under great pressure to guarantee a skilled teacher in every regular education classroom. The legislation requires that all teachers of core academic subjects (English, reading/language arts, math, science, foreign language, civics/government, economics, history, geography, arts, etc.) must be highly qualified. This\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nmeans that regular education teachers must hold a state license or certificate in teaching, demonstrate competence in the subject(s) they teach, and also be able to demonstrate subject matter knowledge on the standardized tests that states select. One question regarding the emphasis on quality teachers is: What is an effective teacher? The short answer is: One whose students learn. The effective teacher is an individual with deep knowledge of the subject matter taught, and sufficient pedagogical expertise and experience to be effective with all students. One definition of an “effective teacher” is one whose students achieve at the proficient, or competent, level on a given state’s high-­stakes assessments. As desirable as this sounds, this general description of the effective teacher is narrow and vague. Poor students and students of color do underachieve in school for a variety of complex reasons, but it is clear that they often enter school lagging behind their peers in academic preparation. Although schools may have little control over what happens before students come to school, they are able to guarantee that all students receive the single most important resource to reach their potential, specifically, highly qualified teachers. One continuing issue related to opportunity to learn, however, is that research has shown that well-­prepared teachers often choose not to teach in communities with “at-risk” students (Peske & Haycock, 2006). When they do, they sometimes encounter little support; therefore, they are not as effective as they might be in higher-­achieving middle-class schools.\n\nabout\n\nResearch and Theory Effective and Exemplary Teaching\n\nA major concern in the study of exemplary teachers is to find a reliable and valid way to identify who is exemplary and to describe what these teachers do in their classrooms. Investigators have undertaken this task in several ways. Researchers have identified teachers as exemplary based on the following criteria: •• Selecting teachers with students who have excellent test scores in literacy achievement over a period of time. •• Selecting teachers whose students’ test scores are beyond what would be expected from children considered “at risk” from schools that beat the odds. •• Selecting teachers based on administrator recommendations. •• Selecting teachers nominated by their peers. •• Selecting teachers nominated by parents. •• Selecting teachers nominated by students. Researchers have used some or all of these characteristics when selecting samples to study (Block, 2001; Morrow & Casey, 2003; Pressley, Rankin, & Yokoi, 1996; Taylor, Pearson, Clark, & Walpole, 1999; Taylor, Peterson, Pearson, &\n\n4 Introduction\n\nRodriquez, 2002; Wharton-McDonald, Pressley, Rankin, & Mistretta, 1997). Taylor, Pearson, and Clark (2000), for example, studied the literacy practices of exemplary teachers in schools that beat the odds. Students in these teachers’ classrooms were considered to be at risk due to family poverty, yet they scored well in literacy achievement. Two teachers in grades K–3 in 14 schools across the United States participated in the study. Each teacher was observed five times, from December to April, for 1 hour of reading instruction. Teachers also completed a written survey, kept a weekly log of reading and writing activities in their classrooms, and were interviewed in May of that school year. These effective teachers focused on small-group instruction, provided time for independent reading, monitored student on-task behaviors, and initiated strong home communication. The teachers also focused on explicit phonics instruction and the application of phonics in the context of reading and writing, asked high-level comprehension questions, and were more likely to ask students to write their responses to reading. In a related study to determine exemplary practice, Wharton-McDonald and colleagues (1997) meticulously collected and described through surveys and interviews the most important literacy practices and routines among 89 K–3 regular education and 10 special education teachers identified by administrators as exemplary. These exemplary teachers were described by their peers and supervisors as “masterful” in the classroom, managing time, materials, and student behavior with finesse. These effective teachers held high expectations for their students and had a real sense of purpose, direction, and objectives. Topping the list of classroom characteristics and instructional practices reported by these effective, primary-level teachers was—not surprisingly—a literate classroom environment. In addition, these educators provided explicit instruction in literacy (reading and writing) skills, strategies, and concepts. They provided daily doses of both contextualized and isolated skills and strategy instruction, access to varied reading materials, and a variety of ways to engage students in reading and writing. They adapted instruction to the ability levels or needs of their students, worked to motivate students to engage in reading and writing, and consistently monitored student engagement and literacy progress through systematic accountability. Morrow, Tracey, Woo, and Pressley (1999) intensively observed six exemplary teachers from three different school districts. Teachers selected to be observed for the study were nominated by school administrators, peers, parents, and students. The selection process also included checking these six teachers’ student achievement scores over the preceding 5 years to confirm the effects of their exemplary status on student achievement measures. Approximately 25 hours of observation, as well as individual interviews, were completed on each of the six teachers. The major finding was that these six exemplary teachers provided “literacy-rich environments.” Within these literacy-rich classrooms, teachers orchestrated a variety of learning settings, such as whole-class, small-group, one-on-one, and teacher­directed learning centers and social interactions with adults and peers. A rich variety of print and print-­producing materials were available for the children’s use on a daily basis. Teachers provided various instruction, such as spontaneous,\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nauthentic, explicit, direct, systematic, meaning-­oriented, problem-­solving, and open-ended approaches. They engaged children on a daily basis in shared, guided, oral, silent, independent, collaborative, and performance reading and writing. They provided regular writing, word analysis, and comprehension instruction. Moreover, they made consistent efforts to connect reading and writing instruction to thematic content taught at other times of the day. Many of these same effective practices and instructional routines were reported and confirmed 2 years later by Cantrell (1999a, 1999b) in her study of the effects of literacy instruction on primary students’ reading and writing achievement. In summary, the time distribution among regular literacy activities and lessons, and the focus of these lessons, exert measurable influences on young children’s literacy growth and development. Effective teachers are masterful classroom managers who balance their instructional time, emphases, and content among a variety of alternative literacy learning activities. Effective literacy learning activities are integrally linked to activities in other parts of the day and curriculum; have an explicit purpose, with learning tasks clearly defined; and engage students across a wide variety of social settings. Synthesis of investigations about exemplary literacy practice in the elementary grades, such as those we have described, indicate that exemplary literacy teachers share the following characteristics: (1) They provide explicit literacy instruction; (2) engage students in constructive exchanges with the teacher; (3) create a supportive, encouraging, and friendly atmosphere; (4) weave reading and writing throughout the curriculum; (5) integrate content-area themes into the teaching of reading and writing; (6) create a literacy-rich environment in their classrooms, with a variety of literacy materials to support instruction; (7) teach to individual needs in small-group settings; (8) have excellent organization and management skills; and (9) develop strong connections with students’ parents. Teachers include daily organization and management routines, and organize their instruction so that the environment is filled with the necessary reading and writing materials to support that instruction, purposefully placed for accessibility when needed. There are explicit instructions and time for periods of social interaction for learning in whole-group, small-group, and one-on-one settings. The teacher provides many formats for reading and writing: reading aloud, shared reading, independent reading, collaborative reading, guided reading, performance of reading activities, partner/buddy reading, literature circles, and content-area reading. The teacher organizes the following writing activities: shared writing, journal writing, independent writing, reader response writing, collaborative writing, writing fiction and nonfiction, guided writing, performance of writing activities, content-area writing, and writing workshop (e.g., Allington, Johnston, & Day, 2002; Block, 2001; Cantrell, 1999a, 1999b; Morrow et al., 1999; Morrow & Casey, 2003; Pressley et al., 1996; Pressley et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1999, 2002; Wharton-McDonald et al., 1997). While many of the researchers phrase their findings differently, the categories are remarkably similar. Exemplary language arts classrooms are informed by sociocultural theory. According to this theory, student learning is dependent on social interaction that\n\n6 Introduction\n\nis heavily scaffolded, and on social organization of contexts that allows students to transform what they know with important academic knowledge and skills (Vygotsky, 1978). Well-­organized classrooms are collaborative communities, with teachers guiding instruction and student participation. These rich learning contexts take into consideration the relationships among the teacher, the student, the community of the classroom, and the larger community of the school. The sociocultural perspective is based on the belief that a community of learning occurs among individuals in a well-­organized and -managed classroom that is responsive to student learning needs and existing knowledge and skills, including those from home and community settings. Although many studies of exemplary teaching imply a concern for diversity, and attention to policy and equity, a gap in this research results because these terms are often not explicitly used, nor are concerns for differences in language and cultural background given prominence.\n\nOverview of the Book This book deals with issues of social class, dialect, first language, power, and privilege. The intended audience is college professors and their graduate and undergraduate students. It is also intended for classroom teachers of reading and reading specialists in districts with children from diverse backgrounds. The stage is set for the book in a foreword with a most appropriate title: “Every Child Must Be Visible If We Are to Succeed as a World-Class Nation.” This important piece is written by Professor Emeritus Edmund W. Gordon (from Columbia University). The book is divided into four major parts. Part I addresses perspectives about learning and diverse students. Special issues concerning literacy, diversity, equity, and policy are discussed in Part II. Strategies for teaching children from diverse backgrounds are elaborated in Part III, and preparation of literacy teachers to teach children with diverse languages, cultures, and experiences is discussed in Part IV. Part I begins with Chapter 1 by Honorine Nocon (from the University of Colorado at Denver) and Michael Cole (University of California at San Diego), who provide a historical context and discuss theory related to issues about diversity and literacy. In Chapter 2, policy related to diversity and literacy is discussed by Eugene E. García (from Arizona State University) and Ann-Marie Wiese (WestEd). Iliana Reyes, Leisy Wyman, Norma González, Eliane Rubinstein-Ávila, Karen Spear-­Ellinwood, Perry Gilmore, and Luis C. Moll (all from the University of Arizona) share ideas about the discourse patterns of diverse students outside of school in Chapter 3. An area of utmost importance when we talk about diversity is family. In Chapter 4, Patricia A. Edwards (from Michigan State University), Jeanne R. Paratore (Boston University), and Nancy L. Roser (University of Texas\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nat Austin) discuss family literacy and the importance of recognizing cultural significance. In Chapter 5, poverty and its effect on literacy are discussed by Pedro Portes (from the University of Georgia) and Spencer Salas (University of North Carolina). English language learners and literacy development are discussed by Robert T. Jiménez and Brad L. Teague (both from Vanderbilt University) in Chapter 6. Part II highlights special issues concerning literacy. It begins with Chapter 7 by Cynthia H. Brock (from the University of Nevada), Gwendolyn Thompson McMillon (Oakland University), Julie L. Pennington and Dianna Townsend (University of Nevada), and Diane Lapp (San Diego State University), which discusses teacher talk and academic English development. In Chapter 8, Cheryl McLean, Erica Boling, and Jennifer Rowsell (all from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey) look at engaging diverse students in multiple literacies in and out of school. This is followed in Chapter 9 by a discussion of the consequences of new literacies, poverty, and NCLB by Donald J. Leu, Gregory McVerry, W. Ian O’Byrne, Lisa Zawilinski (all from the University of Connecticut), Jill Castek (University of California Berkeley), and Douglas K. Hartman (Michigan State University), who find that the diverse students who often require the most assistance frequently receive the least. The next topic, in Chapter 10, focusing on guiding children from diverse backgrounds to become engaged readers, is written by John T. Guthrie (from the University of Maryland), Robert Rueda (University of Southern California), Linda B. Gambrell (Clemson University), and Danette A. Morrison (University of Maryland). Defining informal learning and describing such activities with children from diverse backgrounds is then discussed in Chapter 11 by Kris Gutiérrez (from the University of California Los Angeles) and Carol D. Lee (Northwestern University). Georgia Earnest García and Eurydice B. Bauer (both from the University of Illinois), in Chapter 12, discuss assessment of student progress as a guide to planning appropriate instruction. Finally, in Chapter 13, D. Ray Reutzel (from the Utah State University), Lesley Mandel Morrow (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey), and Heather Casey (Rider University) discuss organizing and managing the language arts program with children from diverse backgrounds. In Part III, the authors present strategies appropriate for teaching children from diverse backgrounds. Chapter 14 deals with language development in first and second languages by María S. Carlo (from the University of Miami). In Chapter 15, Linnea C. Ehri (from the City University of New York) presents studies on acquiring knowledge about print, specifically, phonological awareness and phonics. Issues related to vocabulary development are shared in Chapter 16 by Susan Watts Taffe (from the University of Cincinnati), and Camille L. Z. Blachowicz and Peter J. Fisher (both from National-Louis University). Comprehension through the construction of meaning with expository and narrative texts is discussed in Chapter 17 by Susie M. Goodin and P. David Pearson (both from the University of California Berkeley), and Catherine M. Weber and Taffy E. Raphael (from the University of Illinois, Chicago). The last strategy dealt with in this section addresses\n\n8 Introduction\n\nways to help diverse learners become fluent readers, and is discussed in Chapter 18 by Melanie R. Kuhn (from Boston University) and Timothy Rasinski (Kent State University). The fourth and final major part in the book is about preparing teachers to teach literacy to children who have diverse languages, cultures, and experiences. Chapter 19 by Django Paris (from Arizona State University) and Arnetha F. Ball (Stanford University) addresses teacher education that connects teachers’ and children’s knowledge. Next, in Chapter 20, Nancy Frey and Douglas Fisher (both from San Diego State University) discuss how to mentor teachers of children from diverse backgrounds during their induction year. Finally, Chapter 21, by Margarita Calderón (from Johns Hopkins University), discusses professional development that helps teachers continue to understand how to teach children from diverse backgrounds. We began the book with a foreword to set the stage; we end with an afterword—entitled “From ‘Just a Teacher’ to Justice in Teaching,” by Eric J. Cooper (from the National Urban Alliance for Effective Education)—to reflect.\n\nReferences Al Otaiba, S., & Fuchs, D. (2002).

Additionally, academics agree that we learn throughout our lifespans by building on what we have previously experienced (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000). As Snow (2001), Heath (1983), Cummins (2007), Lee (1995), Moll, Sáez, and Dworin (2001), and others have demonstrated, children with very different cultural heritages and quite different life experiences have developed rich linguistic backgrounds in their homes and home communities that teachers can use to build both learning and literacy. As a matter of common practice, however, many teachers ignore these potentially important experiential backgrounds. Often this lack of interest reflects teachers’ beliefs that home experiences of poor, minority group children are simply irrelevant to classroom learning. At other times, teachers actively seek to exclude from their classrooms what children have learned at home, because they devalue, stigmatize, or even pathologize the experiences of children whose cultures deviate from their own. This privileging of the norms of the teachers’ culture is supported by public schooling, the values and practices of which in the United States are consistent with white, English-­speaking, middle-class culture (Rogoff, 2003; Valencia, 1997). The children involved are not insensitive to this situation. For example, teachers report discovering students who hide their ability to read and write in Spanish owing to fear of ridicule by fellow students (Moll et al., 2001). Moll and colleagues (2001) argue that negative teacher and peer responses to linguistic diversity reflect broad societal attitudes that contribute to the ideological and material context for learning and literacy development in ordinary classrooms. Frequently\n\n13\n\n14 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\nthese broad societal attitudes deter teachers from recognizing the strengths that poor children, children of color, and linguistically diverse children (who are often the same children) bring to the classroom. As Lee (2001) argues, “Teachers who believe that these students cannot learn, that they contribute nothing of value from their home and community lives, and that their language is inferior are not likely to invest the energy, the tenacity, and the sheer will demanded to reengage students who have disengaged from school” (p. 118). Ruíz (1984), in addressing U.S. language policy, defined such broad social attitudes concerning language as “orientations,” or “complexes” about the role of language. Ruíz described two orientations to language that have dominated policy debate and schoolroom practice: language as problem and language as right. The language-as-­problem orientation assumes that speaking (or writing) a language other than the dominant language in a society (English, for our purposes in this chapter) is a handicap to children on a personal level, and a threat to national unity and commerce on the societal level. The language-as-right orientation assumes that one’s first language is so intertwined with identity and culture that its free use and maintenance are inalienable rights. After laying out the shortcomings of these opposing views, Ruíz (1984) proposed that language policymakers and educators concerned with social justice consider a language-as-­resource orientation—“language is a resource to be managed, developed and conserved,” an orientation that frames “minority communities as important sources of expertise” (p. 28). Such a reorientation would render linguistic diversity a resource for all, including those from the dominant culture, in commerce, diplomacy, and learning, based on research on the positive effects of knowing more than one language (Bialystok, 2007; Wolf, 2007). We believe that the resource orientation can be expanded to encompass many facets of diversity based on the documented value of honoring and building on students’ home and community cultures. For example, the contributors to the volume edited by González, Moll, and Amanti (2005) describe productive changes in teachers, family members, and students when the funds of knowledge in homes and communities become resources to enrich instruction of mandated curricula. Similarly, Banks and colleagues (2007), Ladson-­Billings (1995), Lee (1995), Mercado (2001), and Nieto (2002) have described the positive outcomes in student behaviors and academic achievement that ensue when teachers build their instruction on resources from community, youth, and popular cultures. The use of community cultural resources is also supported by Téllez and Waxman (2006), based on their meta-­analysis of 25 studies on instructional practices for students with a first language other than English. Whatever its merits, expanded use of the resource orientation in school learning and literacy development is unlikely to come about spontaneously. Collin and Apple (2007) argue that because nondominant literacies are subject to power relations favoring elites, a crucial step in the process of broadening opportunity for nonelite learners is “to collaborate in developing powerful literacies both for securing productive, rewarding labor in fast-­moving informational economies\n\nRelating Diversity and Literacy Theory\n\n15\n\nand for reshaping socio-­economic orders according to principles of justice and strong democracy” (pp. 436–437). We concur; this is the challenge that educators and activists for social justice in education face. Consequently, in this chapter we consider a broad range of long-standing social attitudes, or ideologies/theories, regarding literacy and diversity that play important, but not always recognized, roles in determining when and whether linguistic–­cultural diversity is treated as a resource or a problem for children in their formal schooling. Our discussion is guided by two assumptions. First, diverse linguistic–­cultural experiences and learning from the home are valuable resources for effective classroom teaching and learning. Second, proficiency in text literacy is an essential skill in broadening opportunities for participation in both informational economies and social change in the interest of justice. In theorizing the relationship between literacy and diversity, with particular attention to formal education, we argue the following in subsequent sections: •• A sociocultural–­historical perspective on literacy provides a useful lens through which to analyze the dynamic complexities of literacy development in and out of school. •• Ideologies regarding diversity shape school-based ideologies/theories of literacy in response to power relations and social conditions beyond school. •• The diversity-in-­literacy matrix, which lays out the interrelations of theories of diversity and literacy, is a useful tool for analyzing current approaches to literacy practice and literacy instruction. •• A resource orientation to diversity is supported by educational, linguistic, and psychological research, and is essential to effective teaching for nonmainstream children, but widespread adoption of that orientation is difficult to achieve in educational institutions designed with a diversity-as­problem orientation. We conclude with a discussion of implications of our review for classroom teaching and future research.\n\nA Sociocultural–­Historical Perspective on Literacy What we term a “sociocultural–­historical perspective on literacy” encompasses a broad family of theories that assumes human learning and development involve the interconnected contributions of historically evolved sociocultural practices, dominant belief systems, social rules and conventions, and institutionalized divisions of labor. Reading and writing are two important examples of human abilities that require such an inclusive, systemic approach. This view also includes the important fact that, as several authors have pointed out, oral language is central to the process of hominization and, consequently, is universal to all humans who have not experienced insult to the brain.\n\n16 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\nIn contrast, the process of becoming literate involves developing proficiency in the use of the tools (i.e., symbol systems) that are the historical and cultural products of the practices of literacy among social groups (Luria, 1976; Wolf, 2007). In short, our brains are not wired to read; writing systems developed too recently to be encoded in our genes. Consequently, although there is a great deal of interesting new research on the role of literacy in shaping the brain’s activities during ontogeny (summarized in Wolf, 2007), we focus on four sociocultural conceptions of literacy that have informed literacy instruction and have persisted across historical time. Each has important implications for how current researchers and practitioners think about cultural diversity and literacy.1\n\nLiteracy as Gatekeeper Human beings first became “literate,” understood as the process of becoming expert in the manipulation of a system or systems of graphic symbols to acquire, store, and communicate information, in order to keep track of accounts in the trade of animals and food products (Schmandt-­Besserat, 1996). As forms of social life and their associated technologies of production increased in complexity, and large numbers of human beings began to live in what we now refer to as “city­states,” social groups developed more complex systems of literacy, either independently or through borrowing.2 As part and parcel of increasing social complexity, the cultural legacies of literacy (i.e., the symbol sets and conventions for their manipulation), were kept under the control of social elites, who arranged for selected groups of people under their control to acquire and to use literacy in the interests of the state. The clear connections between state power and the benefits of literacy for those who aspired to better living conditions were made clear in an early letter from a father to a son living in ancient Egypt: I have seen how the belaboured man is belaboured—thou should set thy heart in pursuit of writing. . . . The small building contractor carries mud. . . . He is dirtier than vines or pigs from treading under his mud. His clothes are stiff with clay. . . . Behold, there is no profession free of a boss—­except the scribe, he is the boss. . . . Behold, there is no scribe who lacks food from the property of the House of the King—life property, health! (quoted in Donaldson, 1978, p. 84fn)\n\nSo pronounced have been the sociopolitical power consequences of literacy that many scholars argue that the main function of literacy from ancient to modern times has been to facilitate the enslavement of other humans (Collins & Blot, 2003; Diamond, 2005). For example, Olson (2001) describes Luther’s radical defiance of clerical textual authority, which had protected and restricted access to literacy for centuries. Luther stated “that the meaning of Scripture depended not\n\nRelating Diversity and Literacy Theory\n\n17\n\nupon the dogmas of the church [which had then to be interpreted by clerics and scribes], but upon a deeper reading of the text” (in Olson, p. 142). Luther’s statement ultimately led to the “mass literacy campaigns of the German Protestant Reformers of the 16th century to create a critical mass of readers who could take advantage of the pictures and texts that the printing press made available to them” (Tyner, 1998, p. 19). The Protestant Reformation opened the gates to mass literacy in Europe and the Western World, but as Gee (1988, p. 200), invoking Plato, commented, literacy has two sides: “literacy as liberator and literacy as weapon.” Freire (2001) made the same point, arguing that literacy has been used for both personal freedom and social control. Scribner (1984), in her analysis of literacy theory, described three metaphors for literacy, one of which was literacy as power. She notes that “it is an undisputed fact that illiteracy in America is concentrated among the poor and ethnic minorities whose problems of poverty and political powerlessness are deeply intertwined with problems of access to knowledge and literacy” (p. 12). Scribner points directly to the gatekeeping function of literacy with her metaphor of literacy as “a state of grace,” as revealed in “the tendency in many societies to endow the literate person with special virtues” (p. 13). Scribner describes this as the association of literacy with mysticism in some societies, and with being “cultured” in Western societies (p. 13). Both metaphors resonate with Bourdieu’s (1982/1991) formulation of exclusion and inclusion based on cultural and social capital, which we interpret as an alternative formulation of gatekeeping. One way in which literacy has been used by elites for social evaluation is as a marker of progress, to which we now turn.\n\nLiteracy as Progress According to several accounts, 19th-­century authors had a propensity to interpret history as a progression from savagery to civilization (Diamond, 2005; Goody, 1977). This tendency is described by Cole (2005, p. 197) as a “master narrative” equating history and social evolution with progress. Both Diamond and Cole argue that writing has contributed to social change and to the perception of writing as a marker of social superiority. Diamond notes that “peoples who pride themselves on being civilized have always viewed writing as the sharpest distinction raising them above ‘barbarians’ or ‘savages’ ” (2005, p. 215). Cole (2005, p. 206) questions the idea that school-based literacy produces generalized development of cognitive skills: At a minimum, it seems certain that practice in representing language using writing symbols improves children’s and adults’ ability to analyze the sound structure and grammar of their language [Morais & Kolinsky, 2001], a finding which Peter Bryant and his colleagues have made good use of in the design of programs for the teaching of reading [Bryant, 1995; Bryant & Nunes, 1998].\n\n18 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\nCole notes, in connection with his suspicions about the generality of the cognitive changes wrought by formal schooling, that Vai farmers from northwestern Liberia showed similar increased language-­analyzing abilities even though they had acquired literacy apart from schooling. Citing further research on schooling and literacy outside of schooling, Cole (2005) concludes that schooling may prepare people for specific practices (e.g., bureaucratic work 3) valued in modern, urbanized society; however, this is not equivalent to generalizable intellectual advancement for whole societies. Similarly, while literacy produces both individual cognitive and social change over generations, those changes are contextually situated in the practices of cultural groups and are neither neutral in terms of individual or societal change, nor are they unidirectional in terms of progress or success. As Diamond (2005, p. 215) points out, “civilized” peoples don’t always defeat the “barbarians,” and cultures that gave birth to literacy in what is now the Middle East and southern Mexico have faced both defeats and declines in power in the course of their histories. Still, the ideology of literacy as progress remains prevalent, informing both educational practice and policy (Cummins, 2007; UNESCO, 1951), and provoking a critical countertheory of literacy as discourse, which we now address.\n\nLiteracy as Discourse Tyner (1998, p. 26) summarizes the work of literacy scholars who have questioned assumptions about literacy as progress by arguing that “the elevation of print over oral cultures was a serious misstep in literacy research.” She points to the work of Goody and Watt (1963) and Scribner and Cole (1981), who found that literate people do not necessarily think clearly. As a response to theories of literacy as progress, Tyner describes a theory of literacy that emerged at the end of the 20th century as research began to focus on qualitative and quantitative studies of the meaning of literacy in particular contexts—­literacy as discourse. Consistent with Scribner and Cole’s finding that the practice of literacy has different consequences in different cultural practices, Tyner argues that “the theory of literacy as discourse offers these students [children in diverse, multicultural societies] the tools to switch fluently between a wide range of discourses available to them in order to apply communication in strategic ways” (p. 28). Delpit’s (1995) work provides a clear example of literacy as discourse. She argues that while maintaining their home discourse, members of nondominant cultural groups must master the discourses of power to access the culture of power. Stressing the importance of that home/primary discourse as the foundation for developing expertise in other discourses, Tyner (1998) cites Gee’s (1996) argument that discourses are mastered through a process of acquisition that is closer to apprenticeship than to formal and conscious learning. Nieto (1999, 2002) describes this process as an internally challenging negotiation that students who are not from the mainstream navigate in acquiring the discourse of school literacy. It also involves the institutionally and personally challenging negotiation\n\nRelating Diversity and Literacy Theory\n\n19\n\nthat teachers of nonelite students need to undertake in acquiring the discourses of multicultural literacies. Nieto’s work, as well as that of Gee (1996, 2003), provides a link between literacy as discourse and the associated concept of multiliteracies across languages, dialects, registers, and media forms. The New London Group (1996) articulated the need for new pedagogies to address the issue of new media literacies. This concern was taken up recently by Collin and Apple (2007), who analyzed what they refer to as the biopolitics of workplace and school-based literacies. A theory of multiple literacies as multiple forms of discourse links to the multiple uses or functions that literacy may serve in specific contexts. We turn to that issue in the following section.\n\nLiteracy as Tool and Practice4 Cole (2005) describes culture and education simultaneously as both processes and products. Similar to literacy, both culture and education use tools and serve as tools. “They overlap in their emphasis upon sustaining the life of the community by bringing about change in children” (p. 196). The life of the community is sustained by enculturating children in the practices of the community, including the practice of literacy. What is not so clear in today’s rapidly changing and complex societies, with overlapping cultural groups and practices, is what sorts of tools are most appropriate to the enculturation processes to which diverse children are subjected in schools. Gutiérrez and Rogoff (2003) address the complexity of culture and enculturation in modern society by describing “culture” as a process that entails participating in multiple practices that are at once culturally inherited and co-­created by individuals in interaction. These practices often cross the boundaries of groups of individuals who share cultural commonalities, providing an explanation for within-group variation. Literacies as practices, and as tools situated within practices, can similarly be used within and across cultural communities. With the concept of literacies as tools for human interaction in mind, we return to the last of Scribner’s (1984) three literacy metaphors, literacy as adaptation: This metaphor is designed to capture concepts of literacy that emphasize its survival or pragmatic value. When the term “functional literacy” was originally introduced during World War I (Harman, 1970), it specified the literacy skills required to meet the tasks of modern soldiering. Today, functional literacy is conceived broadly as the level of proficiency necessary for effective performance in a range of settings and customary activities. (p. 9)\n\nScribner argues that the broader conception of functional literacy essentializes people and situations by assuming that a shared minimal level of literacy is universal. Her critique was prescient in light of the Reading First pro-\n\n20 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\ngram and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) (Cummins, 2007). A sociocultural–­historical conception of literacy as a tool situated in practice represents a move counter to the essentializing concept of functional literacy. Additionally, a sociocultural–­historical approach that conceptualizes literacy as a practice, or practices, shared and transformed over time assumes that literacies themselves are dynamic. New literates not only acquire the tools of literacy but also contribute to the ongoing development of the practice of literacy, because the participation and identities of the participants themselves change in relation to the practice. Rogoff (2003) describes literacy as both dynamic and specific. On the one hand, she recounts the ways the definition of English literacy has changed over time in the United States, from reading and reciting passages without comprehension to making inferences and developing ideas through written material (pp. 260–261). On the other hand, she describes Scribner and Cole’s (1981) findings that the Vai people of Liberia used three literacies for three separate purposes (Vai script for personal writing, Arabic for memorization or study of the Qur’an, and English for business). These two examples suggest that as people engage with culturally specific literacy products in processes of becoming proficient users of different literacies, they at the same time contribute to changes in those literacies. These examples also resonate with Delpit’s (1995) and Nieto’s (2002) arguments that proficiency in, and navigation between, multiple literacies by diverse individuals in multicultural settings is a reasonable social goal. However, it is important to keep in mind that neither the processes nor the products of literacy are unidirectionally benign. Proficiency, for example, assumes both access and evaluation. As we have illustrated in earlier sections, access to literacy can be restricted. Similarly, the right to assess proficiency can be restricted. Both conditions suggest the differential relations that diverse people have to the practices of literacy and to dominant cultures in their societies.\n\nIdeologies of Diversity Banks and colleagues (2005) note that small hunting and gathering groups share a relatively narrow range of differences in comparison to people in modern and geographically accessible areas. Immigration, often of formerly colonized peoples, together with modern modes of transportation and communication, has increased contacts among peoples and created “amalgams and hybrids” as groups of varying ethnicities, cultures, languages, and religions come into contact in modern nation-­states (Banks et al., 2005, p. 18). Bearing in mind Banks and colleagues’ argument that those differences often correspond to differences in power, position, and access to resources as the historical legacy of colonization and empire building, we find valuable their definition of “diversity” as a descriptive term referring to “the wide range of racial, cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and religious\n\nRelating Diversity and Literacy Theory\n\n21\n\nvariation that exists within and across groups that live in multicultural nation­states” (p. 17).5 “Diversity,” then, as the term is used in contemporary discussions about American education, is the product of a historical process of diversification of populations occupying shared space. From a sociocultural–­historical perspective, diversity is the product of past processes of diversification, as well as current processes of “distinction,” or inclusion and exclusion, that re-­create stratification in societies, ultimately related to the distribution of resources, including literacy (Bourdieu, 1984). The process of producing diversity (in particular, current practices of inclusion and exclusion based on factors such as home language/culture, ethnicity, and social class), has contributed to three ideologies of diversity that have had significant impact on both the literacy development and the schooling of nondominant populations. We address each of these next.\n\nDiversity as Deficit The deficit ideology of diversity locates school failure in the endogenous deficiencies of children and families of color who live in poverty, particularly those whose heritage is Mexican or African American (Valencia, 1997, 2000). The deficit model has been used by both conservatives and liberals to explain the apparent inability of children from certain cultural groups to achieve academically and is code for their lack of motivation, cognitive abilities, and “culture.” Valencia and Black (2002) argue that the deficit ideology was supported by both myth and science in the cultural deprivation literature of the 20th century and has been advanced in educational policy circles by the “at-risk” literature. They note that the deficit assumption underlying both bodies of literature and the policy and practice they inform “turns students into burdens and trades potential for risk” (p. 87). Nieto (1999) notes that there is ample evidence that some educators believe that bicultural students [those whose home cultures are not the dominant culture which aligns with schooling] have few experiential or cultural strengths that can benefit their education. Teachers consider them to be “walking sets of deficiencies” . . . or “culturally deprived” just because they speak a language other than English as their native language, or because they have just one parent, or because of their social class, race, gender, or ethnicity. (p. 85)\n\nNurcombe, Lacey, and Walker (1999) refer to this deficit ideology as the hard­bitten attitude that “if they’re any good they’ll make it under their own steam; those that haven’t don’t deserve to” (p. 47). Nieto (2002) attributes the deficit thinking of some teachers to their whiteness and membership in the middle class. In their privilege, they are unaware that they have culture, and that that culture is the norm against which they judge students of color or students who speak\n\n22 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\nlanguages other than English, and students from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. These students are the “others”; they have culture. A deficit ideology of diversity often results in a compensatory approach to instruction, in which educators try to remediate the deficits of children who have been deprived of the cultural experiences valued in schools, or whose lack of English is construed as a lack of language and cognitive competence. Additionally, a deficit ideology in relation to SES can result in low expectations or the pobrecito syndrome, which refers to teachers who believe they are being compassionate in not asking poor students (who are most often students of color, and who frequently are learners of English as a second language) to perform, much less succeed, because they already suffer so much that it would be wrong to increase demands upon their already burdened lives. Nurcombe and colleagues (1999) locate the deficit ideology (also referred to as “cultural deprivation” or “disadvantage”) in research from the 1960s and 1970s that correlated low cognitive performance with poverty and malnutrition on the one hand, and limited language development with poverty and membership in nondominant groups on the other. They suggest that the deprivation–­deficit ideology evolved “in an attempt to explain why improvement in elementary and high school facilities had not had a more significant effect upon the scholastic attainment of minority children. Deprivation was described as affecting physical, personality, and cognitive development” (p. 68). This scientific investigation of diversity as a deficit was consistent with broad social attitudes associated with social Darwinism and white superiority that provided the rationale for European and U.S. colonialism and empire building. It was characterized in terms that are reminiscent of the white man’s burden and embraced in the War on Poverty in the United States. However, it was also criticized by educational researchers and scholars, who questioned the culturally biased tests used by psychometricians and the assimilationist assumptions that underlay the quest to find a solution to the “deficits.” This questioning, as well as qualitative studies of minority children and adults in situ, led to a new theory of diversity as difference.\n\nDiversity as Difference Nurcombe and colleagues (1999) argue that theorists of cultural difference placed “more weight upon differences in the expression of competencies. Minority-group children are described as having more competence than psychometricians have detected. These children do not express their competence in formal test situations, partly because of social inhibition and partly because of their poor comprehension of both tester and test” (p. 64). Nurcombe and colleagues include Cole and Bruner (1971) and Labov (1970) among theorists of cultural difference. Others whose research has supported the diversity as difference ideology include Scribner and Cole (1978), Sharp, Cole, and Lave (1979), and particularly Heath (1983),\n\nRelating Diversity and Literacy Theory\n\n23\n\nwhose seminal study of the ways that cultural difference plays out in schools contributed to the concept of mismatch between home and school cultures, which, as cultural difference theorists such as Rogoff (2003) would argue, were inherently equal. Gallego, Cole, and the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (2001) argue that the ideology of diverse cultures as different but equal led advocates to “seek to ameliorate the relatively poor performance of non-­mainstream children by creating some form of accommodation between the culture of school and the culture of the home” (p. 976). They add that educational researchers informed by the theory of diversity as difference fall into two groups—those who seek to organize classrooms to incorporate home cultural patterns, and those who seek to make the largely implicit culture of schooling explicit in a process of making children bicultural. Although both diversity as deficit and diversity as difference ideologies continue to inform educational research, policy, and practice, diversity as difference has become the dominant paradigm. Among those adhering to that paradigm are many scholars of color, whose work has contributed to a growing ideology of diversity as strength.\n\nDiversity as Resource Nieto (2002) argues that whereas teachers need to teach students the cultural capital they need to negotiate society, “teachers also need to make a commitment to become students of their students” (p. 217, original emphasis). By learning with and about their students, teachers can begin to build on the talents and strengths that students bring to schools. “Building on students’ strengths means, first, acknowledging that students have significant experiences, insights, and talents to bring to their learning, and second, finding ways to use them in the classroom” (Nieto, 1999, p. 109). González and colleagues (2005) located strength in the diverse funds of knowledge of families and communities that can be tapped to enrich curriculum and make learning meaningful for all children. Lee (1992) argues that three pedagogical models build on diverse students’ strengths. Signifying and the interpretation of speakerly texts (Lee, 1991), talk story (Tharp & Gallimore, 1988), and community funds of knowledge (Moll & Greenberg, 1990) are culturally relevant to specific populations and effective across broad populations. All three models view experience with cultural resources in the home, including oral tradition and dialogue, as strengths upon which to build literacy. Similarly, Moll and colleagues (2001) argue that bilingual children use the social processes and cultural resources at hand, both in school and out, to develop both Spanish and English literacies. They note that “becoming literate is not solely an individual accomplishment. Children inherit the historical conventions of written language and learn them with the assistance of others (adults and peers) in specific cultural contexts or settings” (p. 435). Whereas this is consistent with\n\n24 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\na practice/tool theory of literacy, Moll and colleagues add that they are referring to more than general circumstances for learning—“to how the specific ideas and activities that constitute those circumstances help determine what literacy (or literacies) may come to mean for children or how it may form part of their lives” (p. 436). Moll and colleagues document meta-­awareness about language in children who are becoming biliterate. This meta-level competence is consistent with meta-­awareness about language reported by Cole (2005) and others, and metalinguistic skills observed in bilinguals reported by Bialystok (2007) and others. It is also suggestive of the metacultural skills hypothesized by Gee (2003), Lee, Spencer, and Harpalani (2003), and others in regard to diverse students who become bicultural. In these cases, diversity of language and experience can be viewed as a resource in developing metacognitive thinking. Consideration of cognitive competencies takes the discussion of diversity as resource to a different level, unfortunately, beyond the scope of this chapter. Before moving on to the consideration of diversity in literacy development, however, we do want to point to what brain research has confirmed regarding diversity in literacy. According to Wolf (2007, p. 5), “Underlying the brain’s ability to learn reading lies its protean capacity to make new connections among structures and circuits originally devoted to other more basic brain processes that have enjoyed a longer existence in human evolution, such as vision and spoken language.” As we develop the ability to read, we build on the neural networks developed through our use of oral language and the associations we have learned to help us make meaning in our cultural milieu. As Wolf notes, “Comprehension of text is affected by everything the reader brings to the text. . . . The dynamic interaction between text and life experiences is bidirectional: we bring our life experiences to the text, and the text changes our life experiences” (p. 160).\n\nInterrelation of Ideologies of Diversity and Literacy Theory In the previous sections, we laid out four theories of literacy and three ideologies of diversity. We now organize these in a matrix that corresponds (on a diagonal from top left to lower right) to an attitudinal continuum, the extremes of which can be considered diversity as a problem in literacy development and diversity as a resource in literacy development (see Figure 1.1). These poles map onto other, related dichotomies in linguistics (prescriptive and descriptive approaches to grammar, second language as additive or subtractive) and epistemology (objective and subjective truth). These dichotomies and the two poles are associated with control by dominant groups in opposition to individual and group agency and contributions. Examples of approaches to literacy that correspond to the top left pole (i.e., literacy as gatekeeper, diversity as deficit) include the Ford English School, characterized by the “melting pot.” Some scholars locate early approaches to Head Start\n\nRelating Diversity and Literacy Theory Literacy as progress\n\nLiteracy as gatekeeper\n\nDiversity as Literacy is a deficit marker of cultural/ ethnic progress and superiority.\n\nLiteracy is the purview of elites, who have earned membership in the literacy club and who restrict access to members of the dominant culture.\n\nDiversity as difference\n\nLiteracy is available to all, but the pathways to academic literacy must be opened by the dominant culture (i.e., changes in schooling).\n\nDiversity as resource\n\n25\n\nLiteracy as discourse\n\nLiteracy as practice/tool\n\nLiteracies are discourses in which all participate, but access to the written discourse of the dominant culture must be negotiated by both educators and nonmainstream learners to expand opportunity.\n\nLiteracies are equal in value, and produce situated ontogenetic and cultural changes in cognition and the practice and tools of literacy, respectively.\n\nControl of more than one discourse leads to meta­awareness and access, while honoring home discourses strengthens identity.\n\nThe negotiation of multiple literacies by all will provide all with access to enriched learning and literacy practices and tools.\n\nFIGURE 1.1. The diversity-in-­literacy matrix.\n\nat this pole, along with Reading First. At the other extreme, literacy as practice/ tool, diversity as resource, we locate the funds of knowledge approach (Gonzáles et al., 2005) and the Fifth Dimension (Cole & the Distributed Literacy Consortium, 2006), an afterschool program that is co-­constructed with diverse children and adults, using locally valued content within a framework that develops print and media literacies valued in school, and that also welcomes community literacies. Other areas of the matrix correspond to programs like Achievement via Individual Determination (AVID; Mehan, Hubbard, & Villanueva, 1994), which makes the culture of schooling explicit and accessible to diverse students. AVID corresponds to the literacy-as-­discourse, diversity-as-­difference area. Interpretation of speakerly texts (Lee, 1991) and talk story (Tharp & Gallimore, 1988) correspond to the literacy-as-­discourse, diversity-as-­resource area. Of course, these examples rep-\n\n26 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\nresent our interpretations of the work cited. Others may well disagree with these characterizations, based on nuances of the programs under consideration. We consider that to be a strength of the diversity-in-­literacy matrix, which we offer as a tool for analyzing learning contexts and instructional approaches in terms of their relation of diversity to literacy development. In the quest to improve student outcomes, too often curricula and best practices are not analyzed critically in terms of the orientations and assumptions upon which they have been framed. Nor are the implications of those orientations and assumptions for instructional relationships and the development of diverse learners seriously considered. In considering how sociocultural–­historical approaches might help us think about diversity, Cole (1998) asked: Do we make diversity go away? Or do we harness it? Similarly, we may ask: Do we see diversity as a deficit in literacy development—a problem that we should make go away through assimilation or denial of access? Or do we see diversity as a resource in developing new practices and tools for literacy that will serve the needs of multiple groups, as well as the cause of social justice? These are the questions that educators and researchers need to ask themselves regularly to guide their work on behalf of all children. Of course, we and the contributors to this volume align with the resource–­discourse–­practice/ tool area of the matrix. Assuming that diversity is a resource in the development of literacy does not mean, however, that literacy development in classrooms with diverse learners is easily accomplished, or that the practices and tools of literacy are benign (cf. Bialystok, 2007). Diversity and literacy are complex phenomena interacting in complex ways. That said, in the following section we conclude with a further consideration of the resource orientation to diversity in literacy development and its implications for classroom teaching and further research.\n\nA Resource Orientation Sociocultural–­historical theory tells us to begin our analysis of social phenomena with history and context. Our consideration of literacy and diversity has been framed by broad social attitudes concerning both of these phenomena over time and in the present. We have sought to integrate the different theories or ideologies in the diversity-in-­literacy matrix, based loosely on the language orientations proposed by Ruíz (1984) and heavily on the additive and subtractive categories in relation to culture and language. Analysis of literacy theories in terms of the problem–­resource continuum of orientations to diversity provides a lens on power relations and the relative social positioning of diverse literacy learners. Our integration of these theories/ideologies invites consideration of their relevance for today’s teachers, teacher educators, and rapidly diversifying student populations. An important question for concerned educators is: What ideologies inform my classroom practice and materials, or my teacher education program, or my\n\nRelating Diversity and Literacy Theory\n\n27\n\nresearch agenda? We suggest that identifying and developing tools, strategies, and approaches to instruction informed by theories of literacies as discursive tools and ideologies of diversity as difference and strength are in the interest of diverse learners, social justice in public education, and academic achievement. This position is informed by decades of research, and decades of resistance, both public and scholarly, to embracing a resource orientation to diversity. It is clear that we have aligned ourselves with the area of the matrix that views diversity as a resource in literacy development. Yet we acknowledge that the development of literacy is, if not easier, at least less complex, when one is building literacy skills on the shared background of a common language and common experiences. We also know that apparently homogeneous groups mask significant forms of diversity. Teachers today must contend with rapidly increasing cultural and linguistic diversity, as well as differences in home culture and life experiences. Building learning and literacy on the backgounds of 20 or 30 elementary students or 170 secondary students is a daunting task, regardless of one’s dedication to culturally and individually differentiated instruction. Even when groups of students share linguistic and cultural heritage, asking teachers to become the students of their students is asking them to challenge the status quo of a historically assimilationist institution and traditional teaching practice that is teacher­centered and based on a transmission, or broadcast, model of teaching/learning (in addition to asking them to work longer hours with inadequate pay). Teachers need to be supported by teacher education and professional development that encourages them to integrate community funds of knowledge into their curricula and provides them with tools and models of how to do so. Teachers and teacher educators, as well as educational policymakers, need to be supported by rigorous research that expands our knowledge base about the efficacy of building on students’ backgrounds and the essential elements of students’ diverse resources for optimal instruction and learning. To assume that our increasingly rich, multicultural diversity is a resource for the development of literacy or literacies is to assume responsibility for helping teachers to access the core elements of the backgrounds of large groups of students, and to coordinate instructional practice with those backgrounds in an institutional context designed for batch processing, and a political context that favors both assimilation and gatekeeping. Additionally, as we engage in efforts to enculturate the young in the written discourses of the codes of power, we must acknowledge that control of the practice and tools of literacy and English as a second language change the relations of families and communities to schools and to each other, even as we view them as resources. Providing broad opportunities for access and agency in our increasingly diverse society involves change, not only for the society at large but also for our institutions and the diverse constituencies that comprise our society. Ensuring that this change is productive for learners and teachers, and socially just is our ongoing challenge, a challenge that must be met with rigorous research that contributes to resource-­oriented instructional and curricular design and teacher education.\n\n28 PERSPECTIVES ABOUT LEARNING AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS\n\nNotes 1. Wolf (2007) provides a fascinating and accessible history of literacy as a frame for discussions of brain research on language and literacy, dyslexia, and digital media. For more on the history of literacy, see Cole (2005) and Serpell and Hatano (1997). 2. Diamond (2005) makes an interesting case for the separate development of Sumerian and Mayan writing systems, the probable separate emergence of the Chinese system, and the possible but, in his view, unlikely separate emergence of the Egyptian system. 3. Collin and Apple (2007) argue that public schooling is a form of literacy sponsorship that “(re)produces technical/administrative knowledge and differently-­oriented workers ‘necessary’ for the US industrial economy of the 20th century” (p. 439). 4. McVee, Dunsmore, and Gavelek (2005) have written about this shift in theorizing literacy as researchers moving “toward exploring the tools and signs related to literacy practices situated within particular contexts and activities” (p. 540). See also FlorioRuane and McVee (2000). 5. We would add other categories, in particular, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nReferences Banks, J. A., Au, K. H., Ball, A. F., Bell, P., Gordon, E.
