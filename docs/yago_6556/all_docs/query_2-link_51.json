        "text": "2.2.1. Degradation Studies in Temperature and Humidity Stability Chamber\n\nAccelerated experiments were performed on EVOH and PVA composites to evaluate the pro-oxidant action of TiO2 and βCD-TiO2 in the absence of UV light. Color changes, L* (lightness), a* (red–green color), and b* (yellow–blue) parameters were recorded to analyze the degradation of the films after exposure to different conditions in the temperature humidity stability chamber. The L*, a*, and b* values of a nonprocessed sample using the same composition were taken as a reference to compare all other samples. In addition, the total color difference parameter (∆E) was obtained. A threshold value of ∆E = 1 was assumed to be a perceptible color change by human eye [39]. A color change of thermoplastic polymers typically entails intensive thermo-oxidative or photo-oxidative degradation [40,41,42]. and report the average values of color parameters L*, a*, b* (measured in triplicate), and the total color variation (∆E) measured according to the CIELAB system of samples of the EVOH and PVA composites, respectively, to visually evaluate the overall processes taking place. Samples were processed by heating (25 to 80 °C) and moistening (fixed 80% relative humidity) for time intervals ranging from one to seven weeks (first week and after every two weeks). For comparison purposes, and display only the results corresponding to the nanocomposites containing 1 and 5 wt% NPs and derivatized NPs (data from 0.1, 0.5, and 2 wt% NPs are omitted).\n\nTable 1\n\nAdditiveTemperature25 °C40 °C60 °C80 °CL*/a*/b*∆EL*/a*/b*∆EL*/a*/b*∆EL*/a*/b*∆ENone87.4/0.0/2.20.787.4/0.0/2.20.787.3/0.0/2.61.187.2/0.0/2.61.21% TiO287.3/−0.1/2.30.987.6/−0.1/3.01.185.8/−0.2/3.83.085.7/−0.3/6.75.35% TiO287.7/−0.5/2.80.388.5/−0.5/2.41.086.5/−0.9/129.785.3/−0.8/15121% βCD-TiO288.6/−0.2/2.50.287.5/−0.2/3.81.586.9/−0.2/3.41.787.1/−0.3/5.83.55% βCD-TiO286.8/−0.2/2.10.986.8/−0.3/3.41.086.0/−0.6/8.05.584.1/−0.6/1412\n\nTable 2\n\nAdditiveTemperature25 °C40 °C60 °C80 °CL*/a*/b*∆EL*/a*/b*∆EL*/a*/b*∆EL*/a*/b*∆ENone88.4/0.0/2.10.887.5/−0.2/4.01.385.6/−0.1/3.22.686.2/−0.2/6.94.51% TiO287.1/−0.4/5.20.688.7/−0.2/2.42.786.8/0.1/7.93.486.8/−0.2/8.13.45% TiO289.9/−0.6/2.33.789.3/−0.7/9.75.278.2/2.1/242283.6/0.5/26221% βCD-TiO287.4/−0.2/4.80.888.8/−0.2/2.93.087.2/−0.6/105.083.5/−0.9/106.05% βCD-TiO287.9/−0.6/2.81.587.5/−0.7/6.23.885.7/0.1/201773.8/4.5/3131\n\nshows the chromaticity values of the EVOH samples as a function of aging at different temperatures. The luminosity (L*) of the EVOH films remains practically unchanged while varying the composition and experimental environmental conditions in the climate chamber, except for the 5% TiO2 NPs composite, which underwent a slight decrease after 80 °C temperature and 80% humidity processing. The changes in the chromaticity value of a* on the studied EVOH composites were negligible throughout the aging tests. The most significant color variation on the polymer composites as the temperature rises was the yellowing of the material. It was indicated by the increase of parameter b* (blue–yellow axis) on the CIELAB scale, which, according to Cai [41] is the most accurate colorimetric coordinate to evaluate the potential degradation of polymers. Moreover, the yellowing of the material became more noticeable when increasing the NP concentration. The highest b* values were obtained with 5% TiO2 and 5% βCD-TiO2. The presence of βCD in the NPs does not significantly influence this parameter.\n\nThe results showed remarkable differences in the total color variation (∆E > 5), which enabled a quantitative comparison of the color changes of the polymers. These changes were caused by polymer thermo-oxidative and photo-oxidative degradation [43]. In the case of the EVOH polymer, the 5% TiO2 and 5% βCD-TiO2 composites experienced a substantial change in color at 60 °C, ∆E = 9.7, and ∆E = 5.5, respectively. At the highest temperature (80 °C), composites with 5% additive showed a substantial change in color, i.e., ∆E above 12. The color variations in presence and absence of βCD were minimal, taking into account the reduction in TiO2 when βCD was present, which was more remarkable in the case of 1% NPs.\n\nThe data obtained for parameters on PVA polymer matrix after processing at various temperatures are shown in . The luminosity (L*) of the samples declined to a small extent when increasing the temperature and the amount of additive in the polymeric matrix. The variations in L* parameter were similar in all the cases, with the exception of the significant variation observed in 5% βCD-TiO2 PVA. Here, L* decreased up to 0.16-fold after processing at the highest temperature (80 °C). Also, in this case, there was no significant impact of the processing parameters on the chromaticity value of a*, except for the 5% βCD-TiO2 performed at 80 °C, which changed slightly to a reddish coloration (a* turned to positive value). The chromaticity value of b* increased gradually with the temperature and the amount of additive in the polymer matrix. The PVA matrix showed more yellow with 5% βCD-TiO2 content with regard to the 5% TiO2 filling, as was the case of the 1% NPs.\n\nConcerning ∆E, a significant color variation of 5.2 was observed in the 5% TiO2 composite at a lower temperature of 40 °C. The difference in color ∆E between 5% TiO2 and 5% βCD-TiO2 was much higher at 80 °C: 22 and 31, respectively. Thus, in these extreme conditions, the temperature and the presence of βCD in the PVA matrix seemed to facilitate the aging of the film.\n\nThe second variable parameter of the assay, relative humidity (28–80%) showed no significant color variations (∆E < 5) in time at a fixed temperature (25 °C) for any of the EVOH and PVA composite films.\n\nConsidering the data in and , it can be concluded that temperature decreased lightness L*, increased the b* parameter (blue–yellow axis), and barely changed the a* value (green–red axis) in all the EVOH and PVA samples. The TiO2 NPs and βCD-grafted TiO2 additives acted as influential pro-oxidants under dark and moisten thermo-oxidative conditions. The PVA composites are noted to be more susceptible to weathering conditions than EVOH films; more intense discoloration when processing at high temperatures (up to 80 °C) was therefore observed.\n\n2.2.2. Photodegradation Studies\n\nThe three CIELAB coordinates (L*, a*, and b*) for EVOH and PVA composites as a function of aging at different UV light irradiation intensities are exposed in .\n\nThe luminosity of EVOH and PVA polymers followed a gradual decreasing trend as the light intensity and the amount of additive increased. In the case of the 5% TiO2 EVOH composite, the L* value fell from a value of 87.5 when the polymer was unprocessed to a minimum of 70.2 after 24 h under 1.02 mW/cm2 UV-A light irradiation. The PVA matrix reached its maximum decrease (L = 73.6) for 5% βCD-TiO2 under the most intense irradiation. Regarding the a* parameter, the lowest values were observed for those EVOH and PVA composites with the highest amount of additive (5% TiO2 and 5% βCD-TiO2 composites), which turned to a greenish tonality under UV light irradiation. The a* coordinate did not show a gradual trend throughout the processing. The composites with the highest amounts of NPs showed a small decline in the b* value, turning into a slightly bluish coloration.\n\ndisplays the total color variations (∆E) for EVOH and PVA films. UV light is known to have a negligible aging effect on EVOH and PVA polymers [14,24], which supports the low susceptibility to discoloration (∆E < 1) shown by plain EVOH and PVA during up to 24 h of UV light exposure. However, the degradation of the polymeric matrices was shown by the TiO2 and βCD-TiO2 composites. The color alteration in the case of the EVOH matrix was larger for the TiO2 composites than for the βCD-grafted NPs, reaching an ∆E value above 20 (5% TiO2). For the PVA polymer, the degradation rates were higher for the βCD-TiO2 additive than for TiO2 NPs at the same percentage, therefore, βCD-grafted TiO2 facilitated PVA degradation under photo-oxidative conditions.\n\nAt the end of the experiment, EVOH and PVA plain samples presented the same initial visual aspects, while the TiO2 and βCD-TiO2 polymer composites showed slightly more colored appearances. This was indicative of the photocatalytic oxidation of polymer matrices by TiO2 NPs under UV radiation. The same assay was performed for 48 h of UV light irradiation and similar results were obtained.\n\n2.2.3. FTIR Characterization\n\nThe chemical changes of EVOH and PVA films during the treatment in the stability chamber (80 °C and 80% humidity) and UV light irradiation were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. shows the FTIR spectra obtained for the plain polymers and the 5% TiO2 and 5% βCD-TiO2 composites of EVOH and PVA before and after processing. No additional peaks caused by the applied processing conditions for any of the composites were observed, however, changes in the intensity of the EVOH and PVA characteristic peaks were detected, probably due to polymer degradation, which was more evident than the effect of light irradiation and weathering conditions processing.\n\nThe degradation of the EVOH matrix was shown in the case of the 5% TiO2 and 5% βCD-TiO2-containing nanocomposites by the spectra displayed in c,e. The broad band at 3300 cm−1 was assigned to EVOH intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonded O–H stretching vibrations. The reduction in intensity of this band after irradiation was noticeable. The transformation of the O–H groups was also detected in the spectra at 1325 and 1437 cm−1 by the decrease in the intensity of the peaks associated with O–H deformation modes after processing [25]. The vibration at 1085 cm−1 related to C–O stretching hole its absorbance intensity after 24 h of UV light irradiation. These changes suggest that there was a decrease of hydrogen-bonding elements due to irradiation in the presence of TiO2, thereby inducing polymer matrix oxidation.\n\nRegarding the PVA spectra, all the characteristic bands can be observed in the spectra ( b,d,f). There is a broad band around 3300 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of O-H groups from the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The peaks observed between 2800 and 3000 cm−1 referred to the C–H stretching vibrations from the alkyl groups. A strong band at 1090 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of C–O of the C–O–H groups. The band at 1730 cm−1 was due to C=O stretching. The intensity of this band was strong for unprocessed and irradiated PVA and 5% TiO2 PVA but weak for the climate-chamber-treated films, indicating the loss of a few acetate groups by thermo-degradation [44]. The wide vibrational band between 1200 and 1450 cm−1 was the result of the bending and wagging vibrations of CH2 groups (1300–1450 cm−1) and the C–H wagging (1200–1300 cm−1). The processing with strong weathering conditions also resulted in a significant reduction of intensity of the absorption band at 1240 cm−1. Photo-oxidation results were also noticeable in the IR spectra. For the plain PVA, the UV light irradiation over 24 h resulted in a 3% and 4% increase in the intensity of the absorption bands at 1730 and 1240 cm−1, respectively. In contrast, the photo-oxidation of the 5% TiO2 PVA composite led to a significant increase in the intensity of the peaks at 1730 and 1240 cm−1, by 48% and 43%, respectively. As no additional bands appeared in the FTIR spectra, it may be concluded that thermo-oxidative and photo-oxidative degradation of EVOH and PVA was not sufficient to create significant amounts of low-molecular-weight polymeric chains. The slight variations between the 5% TiO2 EVOH and PVA composite and the 5% βCD-TiO2 composite FTIR spectra after processing under the same conditions were attributed to less TiO2 present in the grafted NPs. The presence of βCD did not have an influence on the polymer matrix decomposition."
