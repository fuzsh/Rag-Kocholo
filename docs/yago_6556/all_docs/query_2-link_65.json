        "text": "2.4.2Cytotoxicity assay\n\nCytotoxicity tests for TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles were performed using 3T3 fibroblast line (CCL-163, ATCC) by an indirect contact method (nanoparticles were exposed to Dulbecco modified eagle medium, DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% of FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin streptomycin, P/S (Gibco) (complete DMEM) and it was extracted a little of this solution and added to cells). 10mg of TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles (previously sterilized at UV light during 1h) were inserted in 24 wells plates, each well containing 1mL of complete DMEM. Then the plates were incubated with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24h. Indeed, the cells were grown in complete DMEM and allowed to grow until attaining 80% confluence and after detachment, 50μL of cell suspension with 1×105cells/mL were added to each well of a 96 wells’ plate. After, the plates were also incubated with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24h. Subsequently, 50μL of complete DMEM were extracted from each well of the 24 well plate where the nanoparticles had been inserted and added to 96 wells’ plate with adhered cells. At this point, the plate was again incubated with 5% CO2 at 37°C for further 24h. Then, 20μL of MTS were pipetted to each well of the 96 wells assay plates containing the samples in 100μl of culture medium. After 1h, the absorbance of the resulting solution was read at 490nm. In all performed assay, each wells’ plate was examined under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell growth was relatively even across the plate and before addition of MTS solution to verify whether there was alteration in the cells. The percentage of cellular viability was calculated using the following expression:\n\nwhere OD490S means the measured value optical density of sample (cells’ growth in the presence of sample) and OD490C means the measured value optical density of control (cells’ growth in the absence of sample). All experiments were carried out in triplicate per sample and repeated at least in three independent assays.2.5.2Antimicrobial properties\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of leathers uncovered and covered with both types of nanoparticles was tested against two bacteria strains and a fungus. The bacteria used were a Gram negative and a Gram positive, P. aeruginosa (PAO1) ATCC 15692 and S. aureus, ATCC 6538 obtained from American Type Cell Collection, respectively. The fungi strain used was C. albicans SC5314. Zone of inhibition (ZoI) tests, adapted from Kirby–Bauer test [23], were carried out to determine the antimicrobial activity of samples. The halo size was used as a qualitative measure of the sample activity.\n\nInitially, the inoculation of a single colony was carried out in 20mL Tryptic soy broth (TSB, Merck) or Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB, Merck) culture media for bacteria and fungi strains, respectively, and incubated at 37°C for 18h at 120rpm. The cells suspension obtained was adjusted to an optical density (OD) of 1.0 at 640nm for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and to counting by Neubauer chamber for fungus (C. albicans) and properly diluted in culture media to 1×107CFUmL−1. The incubation of the bacteria and fungus in agar was performed using 1mL of cell suspension added to 14mL of cooled solution (<50°C) Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck) or Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA, Merck) respectively and placed into sterile plastic petri dishes. After medium solidification, the samples (previously sterilized by exposure of ±1h to UV light) were placed separately on the top of an agar plate, with the treatment base side in contact with the agar, and incubated for 24h at 37°C. After the incubation period, the halo (zone of transparent medium, which means that there is no bacteria growth) formed around the sample was measured and photographed to record the results (images captured with Image Lab™ software). All experiments were repeated at least in three independent assays.\n\n3.2.1Chemical and morphological analyses\n\nFig. 5 shows the FTIR spectra of six leathers before coverage with TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles. Pieces L1 and L4, L2 and L5, and L3 and L6 are very similar, in agreement with the treatment carried out (see Table 1). The unfinished pieces L1 and L4 present characteristic bands of tanning materials; at ca. 3300cm−1, a strong band is assigned to the –O–H stretching vibration of phenol; at ca. 3100cm−1, the band is attributed to C–H stretching aromatic vibration; between ca. 3000 and 2850cm−1, the bands correspond to –CH3 stretching vibration, which are visible in all leathers and ascribed to organic compounds. The three bands located at ca. 1630, 1540 and 1450cm−1 are attributed to –CC– stretching aromatic vibration [26]. Pieces L2 and L5 show typical bands attributed to esters derived of the film forming polymer applied as finishing cover. Thus, bands located at ca. 1720cm−1 and 1155cm−1 correspond to –CO and –O–CH3 stretching ester vibration, respectively [27]. Finally, pieces L3 and L6 show characteristic bands of the nitrocellulose used as top layer. The two intense bands observed at ca. 1640cm−1 and 1280cm−1 are attributed to the different vibrations of the nitrate group, namely to antisymmetric NO2 stretching and symmetric NO2 stretching, respectively. In the region between ca. 1100–950cm−1 there are few peaks with medium intensity, which correspond to different vibrations of the CO group [28].\n\nFig. 5.\n\nFTIR spectra of six uncovered pieces of leathers (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 and L6). Main band assignments are shown above appropriate wavenumbers.\n\n(0.17MB).\n\nFig. 6 shows FTIR spectra of the six pieces of leather prior and after covering with TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles. The results show that the nanoparticles do not modify the composition of the leather substrate. However, a certain attenuation of the bands can be observed in Fig. 6a, b, d and e when covered with nanoparticles of TiO2 or Ag–TiO2.\n\nFig. 6.\n\nFTIR spectra of six leathers pieces (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 and L6) uncovered and covered with TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles.\n\n(0.39MB).\n\nFig. 7 shows the EDX spectra of uncovered pieces 1 to 6 (Fig. 7a) and the influence of NPs coverage on the EDX spectra of L4 (Fig. 7b).\n\nFig. 7.\n\nEDX analyses of: (a) six leathers pieces uncovered (L1–L6) and (b) piece 4 (L4) uncovered and covered with TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles. SEM micrograph of EDX analysis on aggregate zone.\n\n(0.32MB).\n\nFig. 7a shows, intense peaks of carbon and oxygen in all leathers, which are attributed essentially to their organic composition. The sodium, silicon and sulphur peaks are ascribed to the chemical products used in the leather processing (see Table 1). Peaks of titanium can be observed in L5 and L6 as a consequence of the rutile pigment that was applied in the base finishing coat (see Table 1). These peaks are less intense in L6 probably due to the nitrocellulose fixing coating.\n\nFig. 7b shows the EDX spectra of L4 prior and after coverage with TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 NPs. As expected, both samples covered with nanoparticles show the titanium peaks. In addition, the sample covered with Ag–TiO2 NPs shows a weak peak of silver due to the presence of Ag on the surface of the NPs. The regions where the EDX spectra were acquired are depicted in the SEM images enclosed on the right part of Fig. 7b, where the presence of the brighter NPs on top of the darker leather can be observed.\n\nAdditional information about the presence and distribution of NPs on the surface of L4 can be obtained in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a and b show the pristine surface of L4 sample prior to NPs coverage at two different magnifications. In contrast, the appearance of bright agglomerates (of several microns in size) can be detected in Fig. 8c and e, as observed in the images acquired at high magnification (Fig. 8d and f), which is much larger than the values obtained by XRD and TEM. It is clear that there is room for improving the uniformity of the NPs distribution on the surface of the leathers, by optimization of the dispersion of the NPs in the solution and the incorporation process on a substrate of complex topography. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that small bright spots can also be identified in these latter images, which were not observed in the images of the pristine samples (Fig. 8a), which are probably non-agglomerated NPs.\n\nFig. 8.\n\nSEM micrographs of piece L4: (a) and (b) uncovered, (c) and (d) covered with TiO2 nanoparticles (BSE images), and (e) and (f) covered with Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles (BSE images).\n\n(0.69MB).\n\n3.2.2Antimicrobial properties\n\nFig. 9 shows the halo tests carried out in pieces L1–L6 using P. aeruginosa (top), S. aureus (center), and C. albicans (bottom), respectively. Test performed to uncovered samples (left), samples covered with TiO2 nanoparticles (center) and covered with Ag–TiO2 nanoparticles (right) are depicted. The antibacterial activity ascribed to Ag can be clearly appreciated in the well-defined halos around all leathers (14±1.0mm) in Fig. 9c, while no inhibition zone is observed in Fig. 9a and b.\n\nFig. 9.\n\nHalo test of Leathers 1–6 using P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and C. albicans (top, center and bottom, respectively). The red circles highlight samples with the halo inhibition.\n\n(0.36MB).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that uncovered leathers L1 and L4 (Fig. 9d) exhibited a little zone of inhibition (11±0.2mm), indicating an antibacterial activity against S. aureus, contrary to what observed against P. aeruginosa. This interesting result can be explained when considering the cell wall of the bacteria; the S. aureus (Gram positive) has a thicker layer of peptidoglycans, but it is simpler than the Gram negative wall of the P. aeruginosa, which has an additional outer membrane with lipopolysaccharides and may prevent the entry of the chemicals present in the initial treatment of leathers (cf. Table 1). In the other samples, no antibacterial activity was observed, possibly due to the presence of the base coat and the applied fixing layer (cf. Table 1).\n\nAll samples covered with TiO2 NPs do not exhibit halo against S. aureus (Fig. 9e), probably because the nanoparticles covered the surface of the samples and avoid the influence of the chemicals in the growth of the bacteria. Finally, all samples covered with Ag–TiO2 (Fig. 9f) showed halos of inhibition (12±0.8mm), indicating again the antibacterial activity of Ag. The antifungal properties are studied in the bottom part of Fig. 9. It was observed that all the uncovered samples showed antifungal activity (Fig. 9g). Nevertheless, samples L1 and L4 showed the greatest zones of inhibition (17±0.7mm), followed by the L2 and L5 (15±0.8mm), and L3 and L6 (13±0.7mm). This is likely explained by the chemicals present in the initial treatment of the leathers, which are mostly antifungal. The acrylic polymer base coating and nitrocellulose fixative present in samples L3 and L6 may serve as a partial barrier to the diffusion of antifungal agents, which explains the comparably lower antifungal activity. The lack of fixative, the diffusion of the antifungal agents will be more facilitated and L4 have the largest zone of inhibition due to the absence of any type of base coatings.\n\nSamples covered with TiO2 NPs (Fig. 9h) do not show halo of inhibition around them. As happened in the case of the S. aureus (Fig. 9e), possibly the TiO2 NPs can cover and avoid the diffusion of chemicals from the surface of the leathers. Finally, Fig. 9i shows large diffuse halos (17±0.9mm) around all the Ag–TiO2 covered samples. In agreement with what observed with the bacteria, since the samples with TiO2 NPs showed no antifungal activity, these diffuse halos are a consequence of the antimicrobial properties of silver."
