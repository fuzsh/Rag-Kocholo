        "text": "Throughout the day Taxi driver Tadeo (Juanjo Menendez) meets heterogeneous roles get into his taxi . In the morning a couple of ¨Paletos¨or Rednecks (Juanito Navarro) gets in the cab and he drives them all aroung Madrid . Shortly after , a suspicious and allegedly wealthy man (Alberto Closas) getting in car , but Tadeo's eventually robbed and naked . Things go wrong when when he arrives in the Police Station to denounce and is interrogated by the cops (Antonio Ozores, Eduardo Fajardo) . Later on , a person leaves a baby in the taxi and Tadeo must find out where the little one belongs. Finally , Tadeo has an appointment with a strange woman (Concha Velasco) who apparently needs to tell him something very fundamental .\n\nFunny and amusing comedy , appointed for all kind of public about a cabman and his problems through the work services . The hilarious happenings are continuous , ridiculous and sometimes extremely silly , but in some moments here and there , they are also bold and risible . This film is made to entertain , and this movie , especially for a good time and a pleasant amusement . Bemusing story with enjoyable but also absurd moments and attractive acting by likable comedians , a real Spanish star-studded . An enticing and diverting Spanish comedy film and with its ups and downs ; here our protagonist , the great Juanjo Menendez , demonstrates her real comical skills . From the dawn and all day long our cabman is about to encounter a busy shift in which a lot of varied situations arise and burst up , as he tackles this daunting task while keeping in the back of his mind that at the end of the day . Here stands the uncountable the large numbers of secondaries appearing here and there , being the main distraction of the movie to guess the next player to show up , some of them are the following ones : Gracita Morales , Isabel Garcés , Tomás Zori , Fernando Santos , Manolo Codeso , Don Jaime de Mora y Aragón , Mari Carmen Prendes , Alberto Fernández , Armando Calvo , Paquita Rico , Alfredo Mayo, Roberto Camardiel, María Mahor , Lola Flores , Antonio Pica, Rafael López Somoza , Pilar Bayona , Félix Dafauce , Tito García, Venancio Muro, Massiel and Juan Diego .\n\nSpecial mention for the famous songs sungs by populer performers , such as : ¨Será el amor¨ Written by Antonio Guijarro (as Guijarro) and Augusto Algueró Performed by Carmen Sevilla ; ¨Corazón contento¨ Written by Palito Ortega Performed by Marisol ; ¨Que me coma el tigre¨ Written by Eugenio García Performed by Lola Flores and Antonio González 'El Pescaílla' and ¨Pleitos tengas¨ Written by Fernando Vizcaíno Casas (as Fdo. Vizcaino) and Peret Performed by Peret\n\nThe motion picture was professionally directed by José Luis Sáenz De Heredia , it had big success as critics as public ; but , nowadays , it results to be some dated . Controversial figure in Spain because of his strong and unabashed support of dictator Francisco Franco , Heredia made a lot of films : dramas and comedies , especially . He was a writer and director, known for : ¡¡Se Armó El Belén!! (1970) , Historias De La radio (1955) , La Verbena De La Paloma , Todo Es Possible En Granada , Faustina , Mariona Rebull , El Escandalo , Las Aguas Bajan Negras , Franco Ese Hombre and Raza (1942) whose screenwriter was Francisco Franco . Co-directed by prolific Mariano Ozores . This professional Mariano is a craftsman filmmaker and writer , in fact he wrote the fun screenplay , he recently won a Goya Award (2016) to his long and fruitful career . Mariano made with two famous comedians -Fernando Esteso and Andres Pajares- several films , as they had various years partnership between the two leads , such as ¨Agitese Antes Usarla¨ , ¨Al Este Del Oeste¨, ¨Los Liantes¨, ¨Los Energeticos¨, ¨La Lola Lleva Al Huerto¨ , ¨El Currante¨ , ¨El Hijo Del Cura¨...these films are filled with humor that still holds up , especially for those not easily offended ; being sometimes cheesy and gross-out with numerous naughty and picaresque situations such as sex jokes , adulteries , crazy events , nudism , absurd situations , jealousy , and erotic scenes . Plus , they partially reflected the mood and the reality of Spain in the immediate Post-Franco era , dealing with politic juncture about the post-Franquismo in similar style to other films from this period . Ozores has a long career , as writer and as director , especially in comedy genre such as : Disparate Nacional , Tahiti's Girl , Brujas Magicas , Los Presuntos , Cuatro Mujeres Y Un Lío , Tío ¿De Verdad Vienen De París? , Alcalde Por Elección , Ellas Los Prefieren...
