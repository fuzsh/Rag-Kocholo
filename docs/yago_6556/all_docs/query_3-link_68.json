        "text": "With Spanish being one of the most spoken languages in the world, you can imagine how often new words, phrases, and slang pop up in the everyday language of its speakers. While most Spanish speakers come from Central and South America (itâs the official language of more than 20 countries), each country has its own slang and way of speaking.Â\n\nBecause the countries of Central and South America are closer together and people frequently travel between them, itâs common for some words and phrases to travel throughout entire regions. Spain is a little different though.Â\n\nBecause itâs isolated from other Spanish-speaking countries, castellano, or the Spanish spoken in Spain, can sometimes take on a life of its own. With some words having different meanings in Spain than in Latin America and some phrases only existing in Spain, itâs important to know some of the differences. Here are 25 Spanish words and phrases youâll only hear in Spain. And if you want to learn more words like this, try Drops!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n1 Vale - âOkayâ in Spanish\n\nVale is one of the most popular expressions in Spain, and youâll hear it everywhere you go. Itâs the Spanish way of saying âokay,â and you can use it as a response for pretty much anything.\n\nÂ¿Me puedes ayudar? - âCan you help me?â\n\nVale. - âOkayâ\n\n2 QuÃ© chulo - âCoolâ in Spanish\n\nIf you see something really cool or amazing, you can use this phrase. Itâs mostly used to describe items, like a shirt in a store or a new video game. Be careful though - if you use it for a person, it means theyâre arrogant!\n\nTienes un nuevo coche. Â¡QuÃ© chulo! - âYou have a new car. How cool!â\n\nSerÃ­a tan chulo ir a Argentina. - âIt would be so cool to go to Argentina.â\n\n3 Ser un chaval - âto be gullibleâ in Spanish\n\nThis phrase means âto be a kidâ and is used to describe someone who is naive, gullible, or inexperienced. Itâs not necessarily a negative description though! More recently, chaval has also become a slang term like âdudeâ in English.\n\nÃl no entiende porque es un chaval. - âHe doesnât understand because heâs a kid.â\n\nChaval, Â¿dÃ³nde estÃ¡s? - âDude, where are you?â\n\n4 Ser mono - âCuteâ in Spanish\n\nThe word mono actually means âmonkey,â but Spanish people also use it as âcute.âÂ\n\nSu perro es tan mono. - âHer dog is so cute.â\n\nMi sobrina es tan mona. - âMy niece is so cute.â\n\n5 Ir a tapear - âTo get get tapasâ in Spanish\n\nTapas are one of the most popular things to eat in Spain. Theyâre small appetizers you can share with friends or family, like cheeses, cured meats, and olives. This phrase simply means youâre going to go out to eat tapas!\n\nVoy a tapear con mi familia. - âIâm going to eat tapas with my family.â\n\nÂ¿Quieres ir a tapear conmigo? - âDo you want to go eat tapas with me?â\n\n6 Â¡QuÃ© fuerte! - âWow!â in Spanish\n\nFuerte by itself means âstrong,â but in Spain, you can use it when youâre surprised or shocked, similar to âWow!â or âOh my gosh!â in English.\n\nÂ¡PerdÃ­ todo mi dinero ayer! - âI lost all my money yesterday!â\n\nÂ¡QuÃ© fuerte! - âOh my gosh!â\n\n7 Ser la leche - âTo be the milkâ in Spanish\n\nThis phrase literally means âto be the milk,â but itâs used to describe something amazing or terrible in Spain. Youâll actually hear a lot of things described as leche in Spain, and it can really mean anything. Itâs usually pretty easy to figure out if itâs a positive or negative meaning based on the context though.\n\nMi novia me comprÃ³ un coche. Â¡Es la leche! - âMy girlfriend bought me a car. Sheâs the best!â\n\nEl estudiante nunca me contesta. Â¡Es la leche! - âThe student never answers me. Heâs the worst!â\n\n8 TÃ­o/TÃ­a - âGuy/girlâ in Spanish\n\nThe literal meaning of these words is âuncle/aunt,â but Spaniards also use them as an informal way to say âman/girl.â\n\nÂ¿QuÃ© pasÃ³, tÃ­o? Â¿EstÃ¡s bien? - âWhat happened, man? Are you okay?â\n\nÂ¡Es la leche, tÃ­a! - âItâs the best, girl!â\n\n9 Guay - âCoolâ in Spanish\n\nThis is a truly Spanish word. It simply means âcool,â and youâll hear it used in pretty much every conversation in Spain.\n\nÂ¡Tu camisa es tan guay! - âYour shirt is so cool!â\n\nÂ¡QuÃ© guay la nueva pelÃ­cula! - âThe new movie is so cool!â\n\n10 Pinchos - Northern-style tapas\n\nPinchos are pretty much the same thing as tapas, but can be found mostly in the north of Spain. Theyâre usually prepared on a skewer and served on top of bread.\n\nEste restaurante tiene los mejores pinchos. - âThis restaurant has the best pinchos.â\n\nVamos a comer pinchos esta noche. - âWeâre going to eat pinchos tonight.â\n\n11 Pavos - âBucksâ in Spanish\n\nPavos are usually turkeys, but in Spain, theyâre also money. Using this is the equivalent of saying âbucksâ in English.\n\nEsa camisa cuesta demasiadoâ¦Â¡75 pavos! - âThat shirt costs too muchâ¦$75!â\n\nQuiero visitar el nuevo restaurante con mi novia, pero no tengo bastantes pavos. - âI want to go to the new restaurant with my girlfriend, but I donât have enough money.â\n\n12 Estar como una cabra - âTo be crazyâ in Spanish\n\nGoats can be a little skittish sometimes, so thatâs what Spaniards call people when theyâre acting crazy.\n\nÃl estÃ¡ como una cabra. No importa lo que le dije. - âHeâs crazy. He doesnât care what I said to him.â\n\nElla estÃ¡ como una cabra despuÃ©s de comer azÃºcar. - âSheâs crazy after she eats sugar.â\n\n13 Flipar - âTo flip outâ\n\nThis word actually sounds similar to its English equivalent. You use flipar when someone is âflipping out.â Used mostly by the younger population, it refers to something that leaves you surprised or that you canât believe.\n\nÂ¡Estoy flipando! Â¡GanÃ© la competencia! - âIâm flipping out! I won the competition!â\n\nÃl estÃ¡ flipando. Tiene un nuevo trabajo. - âHeâs flipping out. He has a new job.â\n\n14 Molar - âTo Likeâ in Spanish\n\nSpaniards use âmolarâ just like the verb âgustar.â Both verbs are also reflexive. Meaning âto likeâ.\n\nEsta pelÃ­cula me mola. - âI like this movie.â\n\nMe mola esta canciÃ³n. - âI like this song.â\n\n15 Estar en pelotas - âTo be nakedâ in Spanish\n\nThe literal meaning of this phrase is a little crude (âto be in ballsâ), but itâs common for Spaniards to use it when someone is naked.\n\nQuiero ir ahora pero estoy en pelotas. - âI want to go now but Iâm naked.â\n\nNo puedes estar en pelotas en pÃºblico. - âYou canât be naked in public.â\n\n16 Guiri - âTouristâ in Spanish\n\nHopefully, after using some of these phrases in Spain, you wonât hear anyone calling you a guiri. This is how Spaniards refer to tourists.\n\nHay muchos guiris aquÃ­ en el verano. - âThere are a lot of tourists here in the summer.â\n\nQuiero ir a la playa pero hay demasiado guiris. - âI want to go to the beach but there are too many tourists.â\n\n17 Â¡Hostia! - âOh my gosh!â in Spanish\n\nSimilar to vale, youâll hear this word in every conversation in Spain. Itâs an exclamation thatâs similar to âOh my gosh!â in English, but can also be used to emphasize words.\n\nÂ¡Hostia, tÃ­o! No sabÃ­a que trabajaste aquÃ­. - âOh my gosh, dude! I didnât know you worked here.â\n\nHoy el sol hace un calor de la hostia. - âToday the sun is so damn hot.â\n\n18 Coger - âTo getâ in Spanish\n\nIn Latin America, you may get a few stares if you use this word in a normal conversation because it has a sexual connotation. In Spain though, it simply means âto getâ or âto fetch.â\n\nNecesito coger dinero de mi casa. - âI need to get money from my house.â\n\nÂ¿Puedes coger a los niÃ±os despuÃ©s de la escuela? - âCan you pick up the kids after school?â\n\n19 Estar de paro Â - âUnemployedâ in Spanish\n\nHopefully, youâre never unemployed, but if you are, youâll need to know this phrase.\n\nA causa de la pandemia, estoy de paro. - âBecause of the pandemic, Iâm unemployed.â\n\nAhora mi hermana estÃ¡ de paro. - âNow my sister is unemployed.â\n\n20 Estar a dos velas - âTo be brokeâ in Spanish\n\nYou donât necessarily need to be unemployed to be broke, but no matter what your employment status, you can use this phrase to say you donât have any money. It literally means to âbe between two candles (because you donât have electricity)â.\n\nEstoy a dos velas porque he comprado tantos regalos para mi madre. - âIâm broke because I bought so many gifts for my mom.â\n\nEstoy de paro, tÃ­o. Estoy a dos velas tambiÃ©n. - âIâm unemployed, dude. Iâm broke, too.â\n\n21 Dar prisa - âTo rush someoneâ in Spanish\n\nWhen someone is rushing a Spaniard (which doesnât happen too oftenâ¦), you may hear them use this phrase.\n\nMis colegas siempre me estÃ¡n dando prisa. Ellos nunca planean nada. - âMy coworkers always rush me. They never plan anything.â\n\nTengo que darme prisa en comer. Tengo una cita en cinco minutos. - âI have to hurry and eat. I have an appointment in five minutes.â\n\n22 MogollÃ³n - âA tonâ in Spanish\n\nIn Spanish cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville, there are huge groups of people during the summer. Especially in these areas, youâll hear people use this word to describe the number of people.\n\nEsta playa tiene un mogollÃ³n de gente. - âThis beach has a huge amount of people.â\n\nHay un mogollÃ³n de guiris en Barcelona. - âThereâs a huge group of tourists in Barcelona.â\n\n23 Ser la caÃ±a - âTo be the bestâ in Spanish\n\nA caÃ±a is a small glass of beer in Spain, and youâll always see Spaniards drinking them in the bars. Itâs also a compliment to be called a caÃ±a! Itâs similar to saying someone is âthe bestâ in English.\n\nHas hecho todo bien. Â¡Eres la caÃ±a! - âYou did everything well. Youâre the best!â\n\nMi equipo ganÃ³ anoche. Â¡Somos la caÃ±a! - âMy team won last night. Weâre the best!â\n\n24 Ser un crack - âTo be the best at somethingâ in Spanish\n\nSimilar to being a caÃ±a, being a crack is also a compliment. You can use it to describe someone who is the best at something.\n\nMarilyn Monroe era una crack para su Ã©poca. - âMarilyn Monroe was the best for her time.â\n\nCeline Dion es una crack cantando estas canciones. - âCeline Dion is the best at singing these songs.â\n\n25 Se le fue la pinza - âTo lose itâ in Spanish\n\nThis phrase is a little less common than others on the list, but itâs still a good one to know if youâre talking to a Spaniard. You can use se le fue la pinza when someone has lost it, gone crazy, or is being completely unreasonable.\n\nMi profesor cree que podemos escribir 10,000 palabras esta noche. Â¡Se le fue la pinza! - âMy teacher thinks we can write 10,000 words tonight. He has lost it!â\n\nMi madre me dijo que soy el mejor futbolista del mundo. Â¡Se le fue la pinza! - âMy mom told me Iâm the best soccer player in the world. Sheâs crazy!â\n\nLearning Spanish can be difficult, especially when you factor in the cultural aspect. For this reason, itâs important to use an app like Drops that can teach you the right words to use in different Spanish-speaking countries, including Spain. Because the words, phrases, and slang can be really different, you donât want to get yourself in an awkward conversation!Â\n\n---\n\nAbout the Author: Chad Emery is an American currently living in Spain.
