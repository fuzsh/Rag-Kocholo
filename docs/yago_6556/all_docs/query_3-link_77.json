        "text": "Spanish riddles are one of the best ways to test out your language skills. They are a mental exercise where you need to understand the vocabulary, think in the language, and also be able to answer it in Spanish.\n\nTypically, a riddle includes a question that makes your brain think differently than it usually would, so for people learning Spanish, it’s one of the best ways to start getting your mind thinking in Spanish. So, let’s get started:\n\nHow many of these Spanish riddles can you figure out?\n\nHow to solve a Spanish riddle\n\nIn Spanish, exciting and funny riddles usually have some sort of rhyme and often include some kind of double meaning. So they’re usually quite fun, and often the riddles can double as jokes.\n\nFor example, typically, the verbs used in a Spanish riddle have more than one meaning, and they can be challenging to translate.\n\n¿Qué hace un pez? Nada. – What does a fish do? Swim/Nothing\n\nThat is one of the classic Spanish jokes since “nada” can mean “swim” from the verb “Nadar”, but it also means “nothing.” So in this context, it’s an excellent play on words.\n\nSo here is your first clue to solving Spanish riddles – pay close attention to the verbs to understand better. Let’s try it. First, you’ll have a list of ten riddles. You’ll find the Spanish riddles with answers at the end; this way, you can test out your Spanish critical thinking skills without accidentally seeing the answer.\n\n7 New Spanish Riddles For You\n\nSpanish Hints / Tip Una cajita redonda, blanca como el azar, todos la saben abrir, nadie la sabe cerrar. What is a “box” you can open but not close? Blanca por dentro,verde por fuera. Si no sabes, espera. Read it out loud many times Oro parece, plata no es. El que no lo adivine, ¡qué lento es! Read it out loud many times Guardada estoy en una estrecha cárcel rodeada de soldados de marfil y como una roja culebra me enrollo hasta que llegue mi fin. ¿Qué es? Try imagining the picture Nieto de su bisabuelo, padre de tus hermanos, de tus primos es el tío y de tus tíos, hermano. ¿Quién soy? Draw a family tree Una letra alta y delgada es. La luna y el sol la llevan, pero en el aire no la ves. ¿Qué es? Read the words “Luna” and “Sol”, What letes do they have in common that “Aire” don’t Bonita flor que gira buscando el sol. ¿Qué es? A “Flor” that “Gira” Looking for the “Sol” Vuelo de noche, duermo en el día y nunca verás plumas en ala mía. It’s an animal!\n\nSpanish riddles with answers\n\n1. Una cajita redonda, blanca como el azar, todos la saben abrir, nadie la sabe cerrar.\n\nIf you understand all the descriptions, this one isn’t too hard to figure out. It reads: “A little round box, white like luck, everyone knows how to open up, no one knows how to close it.”\n\nTo solve riddles in Spanish like this, you have to focus mostly on the descriptions. What kind of object is white and round that you can open but not close?\n\nThe answer should be too hard to guess: El huevo.\n\nAn egg is small, white, and round. You can open it (crack it open), but you definitely can’t close it again. If it was difficult, then get your brain ready for the next interesting riddle.\n\n2. Blanca por dentro,verde por fuera. Si no sabes, espera.\n\nThe way to solve the following two Spanish riddles is by saying them out loud. Pronounce them very slowly.\n\nSometimes, this type of mental exercise might be easier for Spanish learners than for native speakers.\n\nTo translate it for you: “White on the inside, green on the outside. If you don’t know, wait.”\n\nStill don’t have a clue?\n\nThe key to this one is in the last word: espera – es pera. La pera.\n\nPears are green on the outside and white on the inside, and if you say “espera” slowly, you’ll hear the answer. This is one of the most common Mexican riddles to help you learn Spanish. So get ready for the next Spanish brain teaser, and you can solve the next one the same way.\n\n4. Guardada estoy en una estrecha cárcel rodeada de soldados de marfil y como una roja culebra me enrollo hasta que llegue mi fin. ¿Qué es?\n\nIt’s probably the most difficult, so let’s get the translation:\n\n“I’m kept in a narrow jail, surrounded by ivory soldiers, and I’m like a red serpent. I roll myself up until I reach my end. What is it?”\n\nThis one is popular in many different Spanish-speaking countries, but again, you’ll find it in many children’s books of Mexican riddles. Just like the egg example, you have to think about the description and let your brain do the work.\n\nThe answer: La lengua, your tongue.\n\nYour tongue is surrounded by “ivory soldiers” and rolls up like a red serpent. Even if this one was too hard, it’s still a great way to work on your language skills and learn some new vocabulary.\n\n5. Nieto de su bisabuelo, padre de tus hermanos, de tus primos es el tío y de tus tíos, hermano. ¿Quién soy?\n\nCan you think of another riddle that would be better for practicing all of the words for family members? To find the answer to tricky brain teasers like this, you might need to draw a family tree.\n\n“Grandson of their great-grandfather, father of your brothers. For your cousins, they’re their uncles, and for your uncles, their brothers. Who am I?”\n\nThis is one of those funny Mexican riddles that sounds complicated, but in reality, it’s much easier than you think. In fact, for native speakers, it can be confusing as well, just because of how long it is.\n\nThe answer: El padre.\n\nIt’s your father. Who else could be the father of your brothers?\n\n6. Bonita flor que gira buscando el sol. ¿Qué es?\n\nGot a knack for Spanish? Then this riddle was a breeze for you!\n\nThe answer is ”Girasol,” which translates to ”sunflower” in English. The riddle describes a ”beautiful flower that turns seeking the sun,” perfectly capturing the essence of sunflowers. These bright blooms are known for their sun-chasing habits, always turning their heads to follow the sun’s path across the sky.\n\nSo, if you were already familiar with the name ”Girasol,” you should have nailed this one with ease! It’s a fun and clever way to test your Spanish knowledge and connect with the natural world. Keep shining bright and chasing those answers, just like a Girasol!\n\n7. Vuelo de noche, duermo en el día y nunca verás plumas en ala mía.\n\nYou’re on a roll with these riddles! The answer to this one is “Murciélago,” which means “bat” in English. Let’s break it down: “Vuelo de noche, duermo en el día” – that’s classic bat behavior, right? These fascinating creatures are nocturnal, meaning they’re active at night and catch some Z’s during the day.\n\nAnd the part about “nunca verás plumas en ala mía”? That’s a clever hint pointing out that, unlike birds, bats don’t have feathers on their wings. Instead, their wings are made of a thin, skin-like membrane.\n\nSo, if you connected the dots and thought of a “Murciélago,” give yourself a pat on the back – you’re becoming a Spanish riddle master! Keep up the great work and who knows what riddle you’ll solve next!\n\nSo here is your first clue to solving Spanish riddles – pay close attention to the verbs to understand better. Let’s try it. First, you’ll have a list of quick riddles.\n\nQuick and Easy Spanish Riddles to Tell Your Friends\n\nWant to impress your friends with some easy riddles in Spanish?
