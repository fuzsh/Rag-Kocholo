        "text": "1.Introduction. Our objective is to initiate a historic call to unite all those with Spanish-Surnames in the United States. While the Spanish surname identifies our lineage as historically connected to Spain, countless of us have Anglo, Irish, German, French, Italian, and many other non-Hispanic names and bloodlines. In short, we are a very large, inclusive assembly of U.S. citizens. As will be evident in the contents below, it is critical that we now unify under one umbrella and confront the many wrongs committed historically and currently against our group. This document identifies present problems, their scope, the need for unity, and goals.\n\n2.Problems.\n\na. Background. Recent events have turned the once-civil discourse of illegal immigration into a nasty combative issue. In short, it seems that all Spanish-surnamed Americans in the U.S. have become easy targets for politicians, contentious talk radio hosts, TV commentators, and vigilante groups. Fed by ignorance or ingrained biases, they are unwilling to accept the fact that not all citizens who speak Spanish are recent arrivals. They conveniently ignore the historical migrations of other ethnic groups into this country, including their own ancestors. Oversimplifying the debate, they conveniently lump all Spanish-surnamed people together. Sadly, they are encouraged by our perceived passive nature and inability to speak with one voice.\n\nb. Political. The Judge Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination issue, its debate in the senate hearings, and the media discussions show that most Anglo American politicians take Hispanic citizens for granted. For instance, it was disappointing to hear two Senators from a state with significant Spanish-surnamed constituents mockingly suggest that they were not concerned about a Hispanic voter backlash if they voted against the highly qualified nominee. Both implied that the Hispanics in their state dont count in such things and most do not bother to vote. That dismissive attitude is the ultimate insult to this specific group of citizens who have been deprived of their civil rights in their state for generations. Not realizing their potential power in getting things done, this class apart has yet to present a coordinated front to fight common challenges.\n\nc. Educational. Similar to the political issue above, school boards and state governments for generations perceive that Spanish-surnamed citizens are below normal in intelligence and are not interested in the educational system. For example, in Texas, where Spanish-surnamed citizens comprise nearly 40% of the population and whose ancestors gave birth to the state, the educational status quo is disgraceful.\n\nd. Social Justice. Since the 1950s, our government has invited several ethnic groups arriving from other countries with open arms, especially if they demonstrated a hatred for communism. Sadly, only several Spanish-speaking groups have been so privileged. Thus, feeling welcome has made their transition into mainstream U.S. society much easier. As such, guided by helpful media coverage, the general public tends to receive these select minorities with sympathy and compassion. In contrast, the more recent groups most of whom speak Spanish and who are seeking freedom not from communism, but from famine and poverty, are not so well received. It is important to note that the nations conscience is at issue here. The poem by Emma Lazarus at the Statue of Liberty that has welcomed millions of European immigrants does not mention communism as a reason to enter this country. It does invite all tired, poor, huddled masses, homeless, and wretched refuse which more aptly describe the plight of the illegal immigrant.\n\nb. The illegal immigration issue has turned ugly. Politicians, news pundits, and many others in the U.S. use it as their favorite scapegoat. Influenced by often vitriolic attacks repeated again and again on television, a number of Hispanic men within the recent past have been viciously beaten to death because they spoke Spanish and/or because they looked like illegal aliens. Hispanic women have been separated from their babies at birth, because they spoke an Indian dialect and were thus declared unfit to care for their children. Integral families have been divided. U.S. born children, who hardly speak Spanish, are summarily sent to other countries because their parents are deported. Very recently, workers at a hotel in the Southwest were directed to Anglicize their Spanish names and to stop speaking Spanish. The unpleasant acts occur in a part of the U.S. that was first settled by Spanish Mexican pioneers and possesses its distinct Hispanic and Indian culture. Dozens of Hispanic drivers in Dallas, Texas, have been given citations because they didnt speak English. Millions of tax dollars are being paid to build a questionable wall on our southern border. The list of examples of blatant discrimination continues to grow.\n\nc. Other Factors. The following critical issues are at the breaking point within the Hispanic community: school dropout rates, childhood obesity, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, and gangs.\n\n3.Reasons to Unite.\n\na. Ask ten Spanish-surnamed U.S. citizens today to explain their roots and youre liable to get at least ten different responses. The individual answer displays a deep pride in our most precious possession; our individual heritage. The answers run the gamut. Among the most used terms are these: Hispanic (or Hispano), Latino, Chicano, Mexican-American, Latin-American, and various other hyphenated Americans from different countries in America. Names include Argentinean, Bolivian, Chilean, Columbian, Cuban, Dominican, Filipino, Honduran, Panamanian, Peruvian, Puerto Rican, Salvadorian, and Venezuelan. The list goes on. Our racial differences are just as varied and just as complex. These include the blending of Caucasian, Mongolian (Amerindian, Native American), Black, and Asian bloodlines.\n\nb. As a group, we are descendants of people who came to this country through different paths; as the first pioneers (1600s to 1848) from Texas to California, the greatest majority having both European and indigenous blood. Others came as immigrants from Mexico after 1848. In fact, Spanish-surnamed U.S. citizens with a Mexico connection are by the far the largest sub-group of all. In addition, many of those who come from the various countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean also possess the same Spanish and indigenous bloodlines as those in New Spain. Other Hispanics (Latinos) came to this country when they married U.S. citizens. Still, the land of opportunity continues to beckon those whose survival needs are so dire that they are willing to risk death to enter the country illegally looking for a better life.\n\nc. Whichever way we arrived, Spanish-surnamed Americans are oddly enough bonded by our heritage. We all have Spanish names, but as in the coat of many colors, our individual cultures are unique and our appearance differs significantly from one Hispanic or Latino to another. As a result, the impressive tonic that runs through our veins adds yet more taste and body to the compelling soup. While it is by nature a robust mixture, it has a certain fragile trait that tends to bring out the individuality of each group. In a nutshell, that is what presents a dilemma to our apparently homogeneous group. That is the reason why we are unable today to speak with one voice on issues of common impact to all Spanish-surnamed citizens throughout the nation. That is why we need a united front.\n\nd. Here is another sobering wake-up call. Some Anglos in Texas are venting their anger today at illegal immigration, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Obama, the first Black President. They join vigilante-type Tea Parties and stoke their paranoia by wildly screaming in coded phrases that they want their country back or that they want the real America back. Several of these same Anglos are now inciting cessation. Such mob mentality can easily trigger a dormant anti-Mexican hysteria from California to Texas. Unprovoked hatred toward Spanish Mexican people in the Southwest has already been clearly demonstrated after the 1836 - 1848 era. Reminders of the repulsive intolerance are still felt today. That is why the majority of Spanish Americans are perennially entrapped in the lowest socio-economic, political, and educational rungs in the ladder. It is this aspect that many other sister Hispanic groups who arrived later are unaware of. As to seceding from the Union, Latinos have always been faithful, patriotic U.S. citizens. They have shed too much red, white, and blue blood on the battlefield in the name of all their fellow Americans. We are in the Union to stay! Our only hope is that we can begin to re-educate the general public regarding the long-standing presence of Spanish-surnamed people in the U.S., especially the Southwest.\n\n4.Projected Goals. As a united family with common bonds, Spanish-surnamed citizens have to assume a direct role in mapping our future. We must establish clear improvement goals, such as:\n\na. Raise the self-esteem of our youth;\n\nb. Establish a clearinghouse to educate Spanish-surnamed citizens on issues that impact their lives and encourage them to vote in great numbers, regardless of political affiliation;\n\nc. Motivate Spanish-surnamed students to stay in school, graduate from high school and college and become productive members of U.S. society; while not a cure-all, its clear that if we concentrate on educating Latino children and employing adult Latinos today, well avoid future increases in crime, while at the same time reduce the jail population;\n\nd. Improve the housing, health, and the civil rights of Spanish Americans citizens throughout the U.S.A,\n\ne. Let the media know immediately when their articles and news stories contain errors or project negative images of Hispanics. Let our elected representatives know that the only solution to the illegal immigration problem is immigration reform. Above all, take every opportunity to educate others about Hispanics significant contributions in U.S. history. If we dont act, no one else is going to do it for us!\n\nf. Continue to be proud of our individual roots of regional and country of origin.\n\n5.Summary. In sum, the illegal immigration has released an unwarranted attack on the Hispanic population in this country that must be confronted immediately. While the issue is considered a Mexican problem, the violence is aimed directly at all citizens who look Mexican. We must stop this knee-jerk reaction. The need to educate those who are unfamiliar with the long history of Hispanics in the U.S. is obvious.\n\na. There will be those who will accuse us of being unpatriotic, but as mentioned above, the patriotism of Hispanics is beyond reproach. We must stick together and do the right thing for the right reasons.\n\nb. On the other hand, there will be those within the non-Mexican Hispanic community who believe that the rage is only directed at illegal Mexican immigrants and so theres no reason for them to be concerned since it doesnt affect them or their families. They should be reminded that Hispanic men have been attacked and murdered because they looked Latino.\n\nc. We must begin to speak with one voice. The time to de-emphasize our regional or country-of-origin pride and reconcile our differences is now.\n\nd. The task ahead will be difficult and risky. To start, we will need to come up with a system heavily reliant on the internet and the public media to identify, process, and educate our people on those national, regional, state, or local issues that affect them. Likewise, we must convince the general public that they can be part of the solution. They must no longer stand idly by while violence is directed daily at their fellow citizens.\n\ne. Equally important is the need to educate non-Spanish-surnamed citizens of our unique makeup. With a united front, we will be better able to solve common problems, participate in forming shared goals, and defend ourselves from the anti-Hispanic sentiments and violence that is now being waged against all things Hispanic.\n\n6.Bottom Line: The need is urgent. The time has come for us to join our voices, hearts, and minds together, and begin to methodically attack the growing intolerance against Hispanic citizens once and for all. A coordinated effort by social agencies, churches, schools, business, and citizens is necessary. A concerted media system providing timely information heavily dependent on the internet, the printed media, and radio/television is a must. The question is how do we get there from here? There is no time to build a new infra-structure to get the word out. We must rely on current organizations that are already involved in seeking social justice, respect, acceptance and positive visibility for Spanish-speaking citizens. As a minimum, we need to do the following things:\n\na. Develop a timely two-way system to clearly identify significant issues.\n\nb. Develop a method to clearly describe the issue (what happened and why it is important).\n\nc. Classify the issue (such as local, state, regional, or nationwide).\n\nd. Develop an equally quick way to inform the particular community so that they can respond in the most effective manner.\n\ne. Recommend ways that they can address the issue, such as, letter-writing and/or phone call/email campaigns to elected representatives, TV networks and stations, radio stations, newspapers, and community leaders, and\n\nf. Identify need to attend meetings, hearings, marches, rallies, etc, in support of or against pertinent issues affecting the national Spanish-speaking community.\n\nIMPORTANT POINTS: Whatever approach we use, it must be with the goal of building respect for the history and contributions of our Spanish-surnamed ancestors. We should each (l) become actively involved in our local community, and (2) do everything in our power to help eliminate the ignorance, suspicion and distrust that many have of all things Hispanic.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: That all who read this paper will commit themselves to influence any organization to which they belong, increasing their groups understanding of the constant and continual contributions of Spanish-surnamed citizens and non-citizens to the welfare of the U.S.\n\nJOSE ANTONIO LOPEZ MIMI LOZANO JOSE M.

(Photo: RGG/Steve Taylor)\n\nAUSTIN, Nov. 3 - An award-winning author who was born and raised in Ysleta, Texas, and who now lives in New York wants to know what the Texas Library Association has against Latino writers.\n\nSergio Troncoso, author of The Last Tortilla and Other Stories, and The Nature of Truth: A Novel, was one of the featured writers at the Texas Book Festival this past weekend.\n\nWhile walking through the exhibitor tents he came across the Texas Library Associations booth. He picked up the TLAs list of recommended books for young adults. He was shocked to find only three books out of 68 on the list were either written by a Latino author or were about Latinos.\n\nIt was shocking to me to see only three books by Latino authors or about Latino subjects. This is in a state where if we are not the majority in student population we are pretty close to it. I thought it was terrible, Troncoso told the Guardian.\n\nTo read the list Troncoso is referring go to:\n\nhttp://www.txla.org/groups/yart/Assets/Files/tayshas/tay0910a.pdf\n\nTroncoso said he needs to find out how the TLA list is compiled. Our community right now has great young adult writers, Benjamin Saenz, for example, who has published two young adults novels to great acclaim and won major awards for them. Then there is Victor Martinez, author of Parrot in the Oven, which won the National Book Award for young adult fiction. There are so many names out there, Troncoso said.\n\nIt is not about being a Latino name and being happy with it. This is about high quality literature by writers who also happen to be Latino. There need not be a compromise any more between quality and having a good Latino story out there as well.\n\nThe list Troncoso is referring to is called the TAYSHAS. It is compiled by the Young Adult Round Table of the Texas Library Association.\n\nTroncoso said he knows there are some excellent librarians around the state. He cited Carol Brey-Casiano, currently director of the El Paso Public Library and immediate past-president of the American Library Association.\n\nCarol has readings in the El Paso Public Library promoting Latino literature all the time. She would have many books to recommend to this list. Why they do not make it, I do not know. I want to know. They (TLA) have to defend this list, Troncoso said. I want to know why only five percent are about or by Latinos in a place where you should be appealing to that Latino student who walks into your library and wants a book that reflects his or her life.\n\nTroncoso said that a quick scan of the Tayshas list shows one book about a Massachusetts boarding school for rich kids and another about Australian teenage life. Thats well and good, he said, but why almost no books about Latinos. Its incomprehensible, he said.\n\nTroncoso said he has already spoken to Saenz about the list and said Saenz was not surprised Latinos were not featured prominently.\n\nSo annoyed was Troncoso that when he got back to New York he blogged about the TLA list.

The quality is there. The great writers are there. I would never sacrifice quality of putting up a Latino surname. I dont think you have to do that anymore.\n\nTroncoso said he does not see himself as an activist. He said, rather, he was a serious writer that has a point to make. For me, it is not just about entertaining people. I want to change peoples minds. I do not know why people (in Texas) are being so placid about this. Maybe they are not and I have not heard about it. There needs to be a lot more activism, but intelligent activism, he said.\n\nMaribel Castro is president-elect of the TLA. She has served as a committee member on the Texas Lone Star Committee (which is the middle school book list and little sister to the TAYSHAS committee, the high school list). She said she is one of the thousands of hardworking librarians that volunteer their time to work on this and other literacy projects for the people of Texas.\n\nCastro said she found Troncosos blog interesting but disconcerting.\n\nShe said she agrees with Troncoso that we need more Latino literature in book lists and awards. She said there is a tremendous opportunity to do something about it right now. The process to submit titles to TLAs reading lists is not secretive or obscure; it's wide open to anyone who wishes to have a title considered for the list, Castro said.\n\nThe nomination form is available at: http://www.txla.org/groups/forms/tayshassuggest.html\n\nCastro said the book discussions for the Lone Star and TAYSHAS committees are open to the public. Any librarian who serves young adults through either a public or school library can apply to be on one of these two committees, she said.\n\nServing on the Lone Star Committee has been one of the most memorable and rewarding experiences of my career as a school librarian, Castro said.\n\nCastro said that having served for three years on the Lone Star Committee she can vouch for the \"open-mindedness and good will\" of the members of these two selection committees. \"Many of us on the committees serve majority Latino populations in our schools and schools districts and have a clear understanding of the literary interests and taste of these young adults, she said.\n\nCastro said that while, as one colleague put it, no student has ever come to her to ask for Hispanic-themed books, we strive to give our students quality and diverse reads, which of course includes materials written by Latino authors.\n\nCastro said multicultural literature titles from publishers both small and large are sought. All titles submitted to the selection committees are thoughtfully considered, and its members conscientiously strive to create a list that is inclusive of diverse cultural/ethnic backgrounds, varied teen topics and interests, and genres, she said.\n\nThe committee, through a vigorous review process, evaluates hundreds of books nominated. We believe exposing teens to topics, not only about their communities but outside of their communities  like Australian teenagers and boarding schools  is not a bad thing. Inherently, it matters not where you come from or where you go to school. We all have many things in common despite socioeconomic and geographic boundaries, Castro said.\n\nCastro added that the TLA has been on the leading edge in supporting multiculturalism and Latino programming, literature, and services for decades.\n\nFrom creating the pilot program for statewide Dìa de los Niños/Dìa de los libros celebrations to conducting multitudes of programs and workshops on Latino literature, authors, services, and other resources and programming, TLA has worked tirelessly to promote Latino and multicultural literacy, Castro said.\n\n© Copyright of the Rio Grande Guardian, www.riograndeguardian.com, Melinda Barrera, Publisher.
