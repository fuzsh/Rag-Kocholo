        "text": "I suppose what we watch as kids on the TV or at the cinema shapes us somewhat, or does it? If it was the case, then I think I would probably be living on a ranch herding cattle and fighting off marauding Apache’s. As a kid, and into my teenage years, I watched and still watch an awful lot of westerns. I think the earliest memories of the western was things like Davy Crocket on the TV in black and white, well the version I saw was in black and white because we only had a black and white TV at the time. The series spawned a feature film because it became so popular. Yes, Davy, Davy Crocket the king of the wild frontier, or at least that is what the title song said.\n\nEven then I think I was taking notice of music for television and film, but things were so much simpler then. I also remember things such as F Troop, which was a comedy series about the US cavalry, and then Boots and Saddles, which was a more dramatic take on the cavalry and their day-to-day services in the west. I am not sure when I first saw these.\n\nBut, it was probably in the early 1960’s, I also remember a series called Hawkeye, as well as Zorro, Daniel Boone, Bonanza, Rawhide, Wagon Train, The Lone Ranger, and wasn’t there one about Wyatt Earp?\n\nYes, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp began in the September of 1955, and aired through until around 1962, so I was born the same year as it begun, and celebrated my seventh birthday when it finished, but being in the UK it probably did not air until the start of the 1960’s. I have to say it was not one of my own favourites, but it must have been popular to continue as long as it did in both the States and in England. It starred Hugh O’Brian in the title role, a character who uses his pistols and what seemed like an army of deputies to enforce the law.\n\nThe series ended in the classic gunfight at the OK Corral, which took six seasons to get to, with 227 episodes. The series was as I say not my own personal favourite, even now I remember it being far too busy and drawn out, and looking at the credits the cast was like something out of an Epic block buster, as it looked like a cast of thousands, many of them being instantly forgettable.\n\nThe star Hugh O’ Brian, decided to quit the series, if he had not it was said that the show would have continued.\n\nThe Emmy nominated series along with other western series such as Gunsmoke, and Cheyenne pathed the way to launch a fruitful era of television Westerns. The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp was one of the most watched half-hour shows that featured changes in its locale and was always adding characters to the storyline as it progressed.\n\nThe title role was in fact originally offered to George Montgomery, who had become popular due to his role in the motion picture Davy Crocket Indian Scout (1950). The actor also refused lead roles in Wagon Train and Gunsmoke to work on his own series Cimarron City (1958), a series that lasted for just one season.\n\nThe Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp is looked upon now as being one of the best series that was produced by Desilu during this period. Music was by a handful of composers and lyricists, that included Harry Warren, Herman Stein, Ken Darby, and Harold Adamson. The credits also list over sixty writers for the series and four main producers, and five directors.\n\nIt was also in 1955 that audiences saw the launch of Gunsmoke, which starred James Arness as Marshal Matt Dillon who oversees Dodge City, a town in the wild west where people often have no respect for the law. He takes on many problems and deals with them as only he can, as we discover as the series progresses. Arness played Matt Dillon in every episode, and it was probably this series that also launched the career of actor Dennis Weaver who made the role of Chester, the marshal’s sidekick his own.\n\nThe series also featured several actors who would later become TV and movie stars in their own right such as Leonard Nimoy, Kim Darby, Shanni Wallis, Claude Akins, Burt Reynolds, and Kurt Russel to name but a handful.\n\nThe series was associated with frontier life: cattle rustling, gunfights, brawls, and so many other issues, all of which required firm action and just rulings of the law, which is something that the series central character was good at. The love interest was provided by Amanda Blake who played Kitty, with another ally of the Marshal being Doc, who was portrayed by actor Milburn Stone. The musical reins for the series were held by over thirty composers in its twenty-year run-on TV, with Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein, Bruce Broughton (who also featured in an episode as a piano player), Jerold Immel, Franz Waxman, Gerald Fried, Van McCoy, and William Lava being amongst these.\n\nThe cast list is even bigger than The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, (so its big) with actors such as Chuck Connors, Russ Tamblyn, Neville Brand, Betty Hutton, Rory Calhoun, all popping up. The series also had over a hundred writers and in access, of sixty directors, and ran for just over twenty years from 1955 through till 1975, with a total of six hundred and thirty-six episodes.\n\nAnother series which began in 1955 was Cheyenne, set after the American Civil War, it followed the wandering fortune hunter Cheyenne Bodie, as he roamed the West looking mainly for trouble or did trouble just find him? It entailed numerous fights, and many bad guys to beat up, plus hints of romance sprinkled here and there, turning his hand to whatever, he could, to earn his keep. Cheyenne was a master of many trades as his job changed from episode to episode. The series starred Clint Walker in the title role, it first aired in 1955 and had a run of eight years with a total of one hundred and eight one-hour episodes. Bodie earned his name from the Cheyenne Indians who had murdered his parents when he was a child, but then took the boy in and raised him as one of their own.\n\nAlong with Gunsmoke, Cheyenne became essential viewing. Music was like many series at the time courtesy of more than one composer, with William Lava, Jon Neel, Stan Jones, Leith Stevens, Paul Sawtell, and Howard Jackson all making contributions. I\n\nn 1957 the series Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans came to the small screen, Nat Cutler, known as Hawkeye, is a fur trader, and with his faithful Indian companion Chingachgook, the last living member of the Mohican tribe, he fights to protect settlers against the raiding Huron Indians.\n\nThis became essential viewing for many in the USA and also in Europe, it starred Jon Hart as Hawkeye, with popular horror genre actor Lon Chaney Jnr as Chingachgook, the series had a run of just thirty-nine episodes, but made an impact with audiences, so much so that footage from a couple of the episodes were edited into a motion picture entitled Along the Mohawk Trail, which was also released in 1957.\n\nMusic for the series was provided by Sigmund Nuefeld Jnr, Jill Campbell and there were some cues by Bernard Herrmann which were most likely library or stock music tracks, which were utilised in one of the early episodes.\n\nThe series was filmed in Canada, because production costs were less expensive there, it was the last project that B movie director Sam Newfield worked on, the director is considered to be among the most prolific filmmakers in the history of American motion pictures, with an output estimated at approximately three hundred films, which encompassed everything from one-reel black-and-white training shorts, to full-length colour features which he worked on during his thirty plus year career.\n\nHe spent the last few years making films and TV shows outside the USA. He died on November 10th 1964.\n\nBack a few years now to 1949, and a tale of a masked crusader (no not Batman), The Lone Ranger, who is the last surviving Texas ranger, and after being near to death has been nursed back to health by a Potawatomi tribesman Tonto. The two ride together on their horses Silver and Scout respectively, working their way throughout the West, doing good whilst they live off a silver mine that provides them with income and bullets. The first episode of this man in the mask, Robin hood type figure aired in mid-1949, with Clayton Moore in the title role. Who played the part in one hundred and sixty-nine episodes between 1949 and 1957, the role was at times played by John Hart who joined the production in 1950 through to 1953 and portrayed the ranger in fifty-four episodes.\n\nThe Lone Ranger’s faithful sidekick Tonto was portrayed by Jay Silverheels, who was in no less than two hundred and seventeen episodes from 1949 to 1957.\n\nThe total amount of episodes in the series was a staggering two hundred and twenty-one. With a feature film being released in 1958.\n\nAnother masked hero, but this time one who preferred the blade to the pistol. Zorro came to the small screen in 1957, but was short lived and was cancelled after three seasons which included eighty two episodes in 1959, because of dwindling audiences.\n\nThe title character was portrayed by Guy Williams who would later appear in the very successful Lost in Space. Williams followed in the footsteps of the likes of Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks, who had portrayed the elusive character on the big screen.\n\nIt is the tale of the masked swordsman Don Diego de la Vega, who opposes corrupt tyrants in Spanish California under the identity of Zorro. Helping the poor and standing up against injustice, leaving his mark wherever he went. Music for this Disney series was provided by two composers, William Lava who scored eighty episodes and Buddy Baker who worked on two.\n\nComedy westerns were a rare thing, so one does stand out because it was just such an oddball production. F. Troop, is a goofy, off beat series, that tells the story of an officer who Becomes a hero by accidentally leading a cavalry charge the wrong way.\n\nCaptain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry) is given command of Fort Courage, because of his heroics. But the fort’s crafty Sergeant O’Rourke (Forest Tucker) has struck a deal with the local Hekawe Indians to market their wares to the tourists. So, they must at certain times pretend to be enemies, its a hilarious and unconventional series, that for all the wrong reasons was a great success in the States and in England.\n\nComposer William Lava who was much in demand during the 1950’s and 1960’s scored sixty episodes of the series, with Frank Comstock and Richard La Salle scoring a further six between them. The catchy title song opened and closed each episode and was one of those tunes that once heard you will never forget.\n\nThe end of the Civil War was near\n\nWhen quite accidentally,\n\nA hero who sneezed abruptly seized\n\nRetreat and reversed it to victory.\n\nHis medal of honour pleased and thrilled\n\nhis proud little family group.\n\nWhile pinning it on some blood was spilled\n\nAnd so it was planned he’d command F Troop.\n\nWhere Indian fights are colourful sights\n\nand nobody takes a lickin’\n\nWhere, pale face and redskin\n\nBoth turn chicken.\n\nWhen drilling and fighting get them down,\n\nThey know their morale can’t droop.\n\nAs long as they all relax in town\n\nBefore they resume with a bang and a boom\n\nF Troop.\n\nWatching the series recently it did make me smile, but it has I must admit aged as in some of the things seem silly now rather than funny. But like another series that was out the same time or there abouts Hogans Heroes, which was a send up of The Great Escape more or less, I still have fond memories of it.\n\nI also recall Laramie, which began in 1959, I always remember the opening theme, it had to it a slightly romantic sound, with strings playing a big part in shaping the melody. I probably would have caught the series late as I was just four years of age when it was first screened in the USA, so it was probably not shown in UK for a year or even two after that. Laramie had a total of one hundred and twenty-four episodes and ran from 1959 through till 1963. The series was set In the Wyoming Territory of the 1870s, and focused upon Slim Sherman, played by John Smith and his fourteen-year-old brother Andy, portrayed by Robert Crawford Jnr, who were aided by Jess Harper (Robert Fuller) as they try to hang on to their family’s ranch after their father is shot by a land grabber. They increase their income from their slight cattle-ranch by serving as a stagecoach station near Laramie. The series music was written and arranged by a handful of composers and supervisors that included Cyril J. Mockridge, Stanley Wilson, Nathan Scott, R. Dale Butts, Arthur Morton and Albert Sendrey. Mockbridge was responsible for the series theme, and most of the scores, but these were made up of stock music by the composer.\n\nThe next series I’m going to mention started is run on TV in 1957, its last episode was shown in 1965, and a total of two hundred and eighty-four episodes were shown. Wagon Train is probably one of the better-known TV westerns, its music credits alone are impressive, with numerous composers working on it.

Many stories featured the trustworthy Assistant Wagon master, Bill Hawks, grizzled old cook Charlie Wooster, and a young orphan, Barnaby West.\n\nAnother popular series that had an amazingly successful run was The Virginian (later renamed The Men from Shiloh in its final year after a bit of a re-vamp by the TV company) was an American Western television series starring James Drury in the title role, along with Doug McClure, Lee J. Cobb, and many others. It originally aired on NBC from 1962 to 1971 and had a total of two hundred and forty-nine episodes.\n\nDrury had played the same role in 1958, in a pilot for the show but it was thought it was not a viable proposition and consequently was shelved. But in 1962 the pilot was revived and became part of the opening season. Filmed in colour, The Virginian became television’s first ninety-minute Western series. Lee J. Cobb left the series after four seasons and was replaced over the years by well-known character actors John Dehner, Charles Bickford, John McIntire, and Stewart Granger, all who portrayed different characters. It was set in the 1890’s, in Wyoming Territory, before it became a state.\n\nThe series was built around a story The Virginian: Horseman of the Plains, which was a 1902 Western novel by Owen Wister, the formula had been used many times before by Hollywood and its familiar storyline had cropped in many movies. Composer Percy Faith provided the shows infectious and rousing theme, that introduced the show for eight years until it was replaced in 1971 by The Men from Shilo theme composed by Italian Maestro Ennio Morricone, the producers wanting a more current sounding theme for the series. The Italian western was popular at the time so the opening titles of the show were also altered and updated and had to them a more Italian western style, with photos of settlers and western towns being accompanied by Morricone’s haunting theme.\n\nThe first episode with Morricone’s theme also contained a vocal performance mid-way through the storyline, that was not unlike Home to my Love which was another Morricone penned song from the movie The Hills Run Red. The Virginian had an original run of nine seasons, making it network television’s third-longest running Western series, behind shows like Bonanza and Gunsmoke. And it is not unusual to see episodes on TV and streaming stations now.\n\nRawhide was another popular series, that led to the discovery of Clint Eastwood, when he swapped his role of ramrod Rowdy Yates for The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone’s first Dollar film A Fistful of Dollars. The series began in 1959, and focused upon a cattle drive that was managed by trail boss Gil Favor, (Eric Fleming). It showed the crew running into various troubles and characters along the way.\n\nOf course, it had its regulars such as the scout Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley) and the cook on the drive Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) and Mushy (James Murdock), Jim Quince (Steve Raines) and Joe Scarlet (Rocky Shahan) playing drovers and Jesus “Hey Soos” Patines (Robert Cabal) is the wrangler. Like so many other long running TV series made in America,\n\nRawhide featured performances from actors who were already established or were about to become familiar faces to the cinema and TV watching public, such as Charles Bronson, Neville Brand, Julie London, Martin Balsam, and so many more.\n\nThe series also had a familiar title song performed by Frankie Laine, with the music for Rawhide being provided by many composers, and the credit list today reads like a who’s who in film and TV music, with the likes of Rudy Schrager …Fred Steiner …Leon Klatzkin …Nathan Scott …Richard Shores …Bernard Herrmann …Lyn Murray …Leith Stevens …Jerry Goldsmith …Paul Sawtell …Gerald Fried … Hugo Friedhofer …Harry Geller …Johnny Green …and Billy May, all adding their musical support to the series, which had a total of two hundred and seventeen episodes. Around about the same time as Rawhide we saw other western sagas hitting the small screen, with the likes of Bonanza, making a huge impact of the TV viewing public.\n\nThe series began in 1959, and it ran until 1973, which is a testament to the show’s popularity and its mix of drama, romance, comedy and shootouts. The series was about a ranch called the Ponderosa and focused upon the family that owned it and ran it The Cartwrights. I have no doubt that it inspired the later successful series\n\nThe High Chapparal, but we will come to that soon enough. Bonanza, concentrated on Ben Cartwright (Lorne Green) and his three sons, Adam (Pernell Roberts), Joseph or Little Joe (Michael Landon) and Eric who went by the name of Hoss (Dan Blocker).\n\nThe storylines also included the Cartwrights housekeeper and cook Hop Sing played by Victor Sen Yung. The Cartwrights’ one-thousand-square-mile Ponderosa Ranch is located near Virginia City, Nevada, site of the Comstock Silver Lode, during and after the Civil War.\n\nEach of the three sons was born to a different wife of Ben’s; none of the mothers are still alive. The adventures in the series are I suppose typical Western slanted tales, many of them containing personal relationships and the problems that these caused. The series had a total of four hundred and thirty episodes, each of them starting and ending with a theme tune that is still familiar with many of a certain age today. The series was helmed by no less than seventy-six directors, the list is an impressive one, with Robert Altman and Joseph Sergeant directing episodes.\n\nOne of the stars Michael Landon also made his behind the camera debut on the show and was to direct fourteen episodes in all. Stars such as Strother Martin, Ben Johnson, Bradford Dillman, Harry Cary Jnr, Joan Blondell, Stella Stevens, and Chief Dan George made appearances during the shows run. And the series music being taken care of by the likes of William Lava, David Rose, Harry Sukman, Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone, Walter Scharf, Fred Steiner, and Jack Lloyd. I think Bonanza was a family friendly show and that is why it ran for such a long time. A little while ago in the UK there was even a TV channel called Bonanza TV which showed episodes of the show on loop, much to the delight of its many fans.\n\nThere were also series such as The Rifleman, and Branded which although did not seem to be as popular with audiences, should also be mentioned.\n\nBranded starred Chuck Connors, as Jason McCord, who is the only survivor of the battle of bitter creek, and because of this is court-martialled and disgraced by the army and kicked out because of his alleged cowardice at the battle. Rather than humiliate the good name of the Army commander who was to blame for the massacre, McCord travels the old West trying to restore his good name and reputation. The series premiered in 1965 and had a very short run of just a year ending in 1966. The series had a total of forty-eight, thirty-minute episodes. All of which were scored by composer Dominic Frontiere. Who went on to provide the music for movies such as Hang em High (1968), and the John Wayne western The Train Robbers in 1973.\n\nConnors had previously found success in a series that had found slightly more favour with audiences.\n\nThe Rifleman started its life in 1958 and ran through until 1963, with one hundred and sixty-eight episodes in total. Directed by the likes of Sam Peckinpah, Ida Lupino, Bud Botteicher, Richard Donner, Ted Post, Don Taylor, and Arthur Hiller, to name just a few, the series proved to be a popular one. Music for the series was the work of composer Herschel Burke Gilbert, who although may not be a familiar name to many was a composer, arranger and orchestrator who had a prolific output. He trained on violin and became the leader of his own dance band by the age of fifteen. Studied at the Juilliard Institute of Musical Art (1939-41), subsequently learning composition under the tutelage of Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, and Lukas Foss. He briefly joined the big band of Harry James as arranger and violist in 1943. In Hollywood between 1944 and 1958, he was under contract with Columbia, United Artists, and 20th Century Fox as arranger/music director. His most productive period was between 1952 and 1954, when he became the first person to receive Oscar nominations for the categories of Original Score, Song and Musical Adaptation in three successive years. From 1958 to 1965, he worked as Music Director for the Four-Star Television Company and also for the CBS TV Network. He was acclaimed for numerous television background scores, including such seminal series as The Detectives (1959), and Burke’s Law (1963). In 1974, he founded his own music label, Laurel Records, as an outlet for classical chamber music and jazz, featuring mainly American composers. Gilbert was a former president of the Screen Composers of America (SCA) and of the American Society of Music Arrangers. He also served as president and vice president of the Society for the Preservation of Film Music.\n\nThe High Chapparal became essential viewing for so many people, like Bonanza it focused upon a family run ranch, but it was slightly harder edged than Bonanza.\n\nThe Cannon family runs the High Chaparral Ranch in the Arizona Territory in the 1870s. Big John Cannon (Leif Erikson) wants to establish his cattle empire despite Indian hostility. He’s aided by brother Buck (Cameron Mitchell) and son Billy Blue (Mark Slade). When Blue’s mother is killed (in the first episode). John joins his family with the powerful Montoya family by marrying their daughter Victoria (Linda Cristal) whose brother Manolito (Henry Darrow) takes up residence with the Cannon’s.\n\nIt was a series that one could watch forever and never really become tired of it, as I say it was slightly harder edged than Bonanza, with regular encounters with Apache’s. And had the feel of a European or Mexican made western. Its opening theme was an infectious piece penned by composer David Rose, with the music scores being the work of Harry Sukman.\n\nThe series began in 1967 and ran till 1973, with ninety-eight episodes in total. In 1955 Champion the Wonder horse burst onto TV screens, in the series The Adventures of Champion.\n\nIn which we are treated to the many exploits of Champion, a wild stallion who befriends twelve-year-old Ricky North in the American Southwest in the 1880’s. Although Ricky, who lived on his Uncle Sandy’s ranch, had a magnetic attraction for trouble, he was always rescued by the Wonder Horse, aided by the boy’s other bosom companion, German shepherd dog, Rebel. The series ran for just a year, and there were a total of twenty six thirty minute episodes, considering it was now sixty eight years ago, and there were just twenty six episodes so thirteen hours of TV, it’s surprising that this series still holds a special place in many people’s hearts. But you know what they say about Animals and kids in the film and TV industry… The title song was performed by the powerhouse voice of Frankie Laine. With the central roles being taken by Barry Curtis who played the child hero Ricky North, Champion the wonder horse as himself, Blaze who played Rebel and Jim Bannon who portrayed Sandy North. I think sometimes it was the song I wanted to hear more than see the episode, but there again that’s just me, I guess. Staying with animals in TV westerns and how could we not mention Rin Tin Tin.\n\nRusty (Lee Aaker) was orphaned in an Indian raid. He and his dog Rin Tin Tin are subsequently adopted by the troops at Fort Apache in Arizona and help to establish law and order in and around Mesa Grande, getting into all kinds of adventures along the way. The series also starred James Brown as Lt Rip Masters and Joe Sawyer as Sgt Bif O Hara. It ran from 1954 to 1959, and towards the end of the 1970s in the nostalgia boom, the series was re-released in sepia-tone, with new colour wraparounds featuring the actor James Brown in character as Lt. Masters, “telling” each instalment’s story to a group of children. Music for the series was as in many cases of episodic TV the work of more than one or two composers, with Ray Carter, Hal Hooper, Henry Walsh, and Stanley J Keyawa, all contributing.\n\nAt the same time as Rin Tin Tin was doing well on TV, another western series Boots and Saddles, came to screens, it began in 1957 and ran for just two years. It had a total of thirty-nine episodes, which were thirty minutes each in duration. Music was by Fred Steiner, it was the story of the US cavalry, with Captain Shanks Adams (John Pickard) in charge of Fort Lowell, where we see the army patrolling in the dangerous Arizona territory, where Adams combats all sorts of trials assisted by his scout Luke Cummings (Michael Hinn) and Lt. Binning (David Willock).\n\nAnother series from the late 1950’s was Lawman, which originally came to TV in 1958, it is the story of Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie, Wyoming, and his Deputy Johnny McKay, who was an orphan that Troop took under his wing.\n\nIn the second season, Lily Merrill opens The Birdcage Saloon, where she sings and entertains and has a close, unspoken relationship with Troop.\n\nIt’s a series I vaguely recall, although I am told it was shown in the UK, there were one hundred and fifty-six episodes that ran from 1958 to 1962.\n\nIt starred John Russel as Troop, Peter Brown as McKay, and Peggy Castle as Lily. Music was by John Neel, Herman Stein, and Ken Darby.\n\nThe 1950’s boasted numerous TV westerns, The Restless Gun for example, which starred John Payne. Which followed the adventures of Vint Bonner, a cowboy in the post-Civil War era. The basis for the series was the 1953 to 1954 radio series The Six Shooter, starring James Stewart, and created by Frank Burt.\n\nMany of the series’ season one episodes were adapted from episodes that had been aired on the radio. It’s an interesting fact that the series was referenced in Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). The series ran for seventy-eight thirty-minute episodes between 1958 and 1959. Music by Paul Dunlap, Stanley Wilson, and Dave Kahn.\n\nAnd there was also Wanted Dead or Alive, with Steve McQueen as a Civil War veteran with a sawn-off rifle as a holstered weapon making a living as a bounty hunter in the Wild West of the 1870s.\n\nIts examples such as this that maybe were the pre cursor to the Italian or European western genres. Music for Wanted Dead or Alive was by composer Rudy Schrager, who was born on August 28, 1900, in Czernowitz, Bukovina, Austria-Hungary now Ukraine. He was known for Deadline for Murder (1946), Sleep, My Love (1948) and The Last Voyage (1960). He died on August 24, 1983, in Santa Monica, California, USA.\n\nHave Gun Will Travel is a series that still pops up either late at night or on daytime television in the afternoons. Richard Boone plays professional gunfighter Paladin, who was a West Point graduate that after the Civil War, settles into San Francisco’s Hotel Carlton, where he awaited responses to his business card: over the picture of a chess knight is written Have Gun, Will Travel…Wire Paladin, San Francisco.\n\nThe series began its run in the latter part of 1957 and continued through until 1963, there were two hundred and twenty-five episodes, each of which had a duration of just under half an hour. The series included appearances from actors such as Charles Bronson, George Kennedy, Strother Martin, James Olson, and Ben Johnson, with directors Andrew V McLaglen, (116 episodes to his credit), Don Taylor, Buzz Kulik and star of the series Richard Boone himself helming various episodes, Boone worked behind the camera on twenty-eight episodes.\n\nThere were twenty composers for the series, Bernard Herrman, Wilbur Hatch, Jerry Goldsmith, Jerome Moross, Leonard Rosenman, amongst them. For a 1950’s/1960’s series it was more violent than most that were around at the time but was popular in both the USA and Europe.\n\nThe Big Valley (1965-1969), was I suppose a cross between the movie The Big Country, and a TV series that was to come later Dynasty, Victoria Barkley (Barbara Stanwyck) heads her family on the Barkley Ranch in California’s San Joaquin Valley, near Stockton, in the 1870s. Heath (Lee Majors) is the illegitimate son of Victoria’s husband, Tom (who has died at the time of the series).\n\nWith her three legitimate children Nick (Peter Breck) Audra (Linda Evans) and Jarrod (Richard Long) helping their mother to deal with various adventures and troubles that include Bank robbers, horse thieves, revolutionaries, and land grabbers. Composer George Duning provided the Emmy Award winning series with its memorable opening theme, and the scores were the work of the likes of Elmer Bernstein, Lalo Schifrin, and others.\n\nAt times the series being tracked with stock music. The series included one hundred and twelve one-hour episodes.\n\nMaverick was also a popular series, as was a show called The Wild Wild West, so much so that both were made into motion pictures a long while after they first aired on TV, and the film based on Maverick became a popular one with Mel Gibson in the leading role.\n\nThe TV series The Wild Wild West was like a fusion of The Avengers,Mission Impossible and Gunsmoke With its central characters James West and Artemus Gordon played by Robert Conrad and Ross Martin respectively, they portray two secret agents of President Grant who take their private train through the west to fight evil. It’s a mix of espionage, sci-fi and the western. Artemus designs a series of interesting gadgets for James that would make James Bond proud.\n\nIt was a light-hearted adventure series, which ran from 1965 through to the latter part of 1969. With some familiar names on the credits for music such as Dave Grusin, Morton Stevens, and Fred Steiner.\n\nThe show consisted of one hundred and four fifty-minute episodes. The film version came to cinemas thirty years after the last TV episode aired. Premiering in 1999, it starred Will Smith, Kenneth Branagh, and Kevin Kline, and had a score by Elmer Bernstein, but its soundtrack was sprinkled with songs, the film was not a great success at the box office.\n\nMaverick began its TV run in 1957 and it continued to be a firm favourite until 1964, with a total of one hundred and twenty-four episodes. Bret and Bart Maverick (and in later seasons, their English cousin, Beauregarde) are well-dressed gamblers who move from town to town always looking for a good game. Poker (five-card draw) being their favourite, but they’ve been known to play such odd card games as Three-toed Sloth on occasion.\n\nThe show would occasionally feature both or all three Mavericks, but usually would rotate the central character from week to week. Bret who featured in sixty-four episodes, was portrayed by James Garner, with Bart played by actor Jack Kelly, and it was Kelly who was the real mainstay of the series appearing in over eighty episodes. Beauregarde Maverick was played by British actor Roger Moore, who was featured in just sixteen storylines. Music is credited to just one composer, John Neel.\n\nThen there was The Rebel, in which the series central character Johnny Yuma is an angry young former Confederate Army soldier drifting through an apparently meaningless existence in the 1860s Wild West. While in search of his identity, he defends people from hostile Indians, crooked land developers, and evil ranchers. It premiered in 1959 and ran for two years ending in 1961 after seventy plus episodes. This is an elusive series as I cannot remember it at all but looking at episodes on the likes of you tube, found it quite interesting. Music was by Richard Markowitz who scored fifty-five episodes, and Robert Drasin, who also contributed to the series. The theme song was performed by Johnny Cash. Well, that’s my recollections and memories and opinions of the TV western, I have probably missed one or two, but there were so many. Oh, I almost forgot, there is one more and its British, Four Feather Falls, was a Gerry Anderson series, with Anderson utilising puppets as characters. And using the voices of actors, Kenneth Connor, Nicholas Parsons, Denise Bryer, and Michael Halliday, it followed Sheriff Tex Tucker, who makes sure all is well in Four Feather Falls with the help of his dog Dusty and Rocky the horse.\n\nEven the animals talk and sing along with the humans as problems are quickly wrapped up. It contained music by Barry Gray who of course went on to work on other Anderson productions such as Thunderbirds. There were thirty-nine episodes which were fifteen-minute slots the series began and ended in 1960. Looking at most TV westerns, they have become dated, but there is just something about this genre that holds an attraction for me. And looking at a few of them I can see why the likes of Sergio Leone, Sergio Corbucci and Quentin Tarantino were influenced by them, and took on the ideas within them and elaborated and developed them further. The music too for these western shows, should I think be preserved in some way or another, as the themes have become a part of TV and film history.\n\nCHRISTMAS COMES BUT ONCE A YEAR, AND WHEN IT DOES THE TV SCHEDULES ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE 12 MONTHS AGO.\n\nCandles burning low, Lots of Mistletoe, Lots of vintage shows, Cheesy Films, and more. It’s a time when adverts on TV go into overdrive, and subsequently the so-called top toys suddenly become hard to find, but they were there just a minute ago, they were honestly, I saw them!!!!!. (which is I think a bit of a conspiracy to make us spend, spend, spend, set up by the toy companies themselves who as we all are aware are in cahoots with the sweet companies who do the same at Halloween), it’s also when Turkeys decide maybe it’s a good time to take that long overdue vacation to… Turkey, where else?\n\nAnd then it starts, we get overzealous and very talkative DJs playing all those old songs on the radio. Plus, various TV channels dedicating whole days, weeks, and even months to the likes of Shaking Stevens, Elvis Presley, Mariah Carey, Kirsty McColl and the Pogue’s, Johnny Mathis, Greg Lake, Andy Williams, Bing Crosby (with or without David Bowie,) Slade, Queen and Wizard, all of whom have their hits from three decades or more ago dusted off and aired again and again.\n\nWe must also mention Sir Cliff Richard, who just keeps going and produces some great Christmas numbers that do convey the true meaning of the season, even if the BBC do refuse to play them, which I think is wrong, but we won’t get into that here and now, or Cliff might just get a bit Wired for Sound and turn into a Devil Woman.\n\nThe same old songs are heard on loop from the 1st of November through till the 26th of December, with Elton John stepping into Christmas, Paul McCartney and Wings hoping to spread A Wonderful Christmas time, the Wombles inviting everyone to have a Wombling Merry one, the band Mud telling us how lonely they will be without a certain person, Chris Rea still driving home to make the big day, Elvis purveying his thoughts on having a Blue Christmas, John and Yoko asking for War to Be Over, and Jonah Louie pleading with us to Stop the Cavalry. Plus, we are invited to feed the world over and over by a lineup of artists that are now no longer so popular, in the form of Band Aid 1 and 2. (Give us yer money). Yes, everyone, in the words of Noddy Holder “Itssssss Christmas”, (Bah Humbug, sour Clementines and has anyone seen the nutcrackers).\n\nI have always wondered why there is always a shortage of new songs at Christmas, after all they have all year to get ready for the festive season, and they do it for Eurovision year on year, (but maybe don’t use that as an example), it’s not like it’s a surprise that Christmas is coming, it happens every 25th of December after all. But maybe it’s because your granny tells you that the old songs are the best, (see what I did there) and we are in fact stuck in the proverbial rut, when it comes to festive songs, and it seems that is the same for movies too.\n\nWhen the season of joy starts to be mentioned it is inevitable that many people start to have thoughts of movies that are shown every year. (is this anticipation or dread?). But why are these same films always shown? Well, its’ because they are familiar, and to many are the embodiment of what Christmas is. The films I am thinking of, and you are too most probably, are movies that we have grown up with, and associate with the yuletide season because we first saw them at Christmas, and because they are associated with a nice time of the year from maybe our childhood, we return to them again and again, but also sit and watch them with our children and grandchildren, so they in turn associate them with nice times and festive frolics.\n\nFor each generation there is a Christmas classic from the silver screen, The Wizard of OZ, The Sound of Music, and Mary Poppins are regulars on the TV screens in the UK, and even though these are not strictly Christmas movies, they are always linked with that time of year more than any other season.\n\nAnd there are evergreen classics such as The Snowman with that amazing soundtrack by Howard Blake. And Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, and so many others.\n\nOf course, there are movies that are set during the so-called period of goodwill to all, that do not radiate any tidings of great joy, Gremlins, Silent Night Deadly Night, and more recently the rather odd, Fatman, and the very irreverent and no holds barred foul language fest that is Violent Night.\n\nThen there are examples such as Bad Santa, which is most definitely not for the youngsters.\n\nIt’s also something of a weird and funny thing that we love to be scared especially at this time of year, and ghost tales are told by parents to their kiddywinks in the hope that they will settle down and await the arrival of Santa. Hang on a minute! Let’s rewind. So, you tell your child a scary tale and then send them to bed with them knowing that at some point during the night, a large man dressed in red and white with a big beard will break into their house, steal their milk, cookies, mince pies, and anything else that is left lying around that is edible, and let a reindeer into the kitchen so that it can chomp on the carrots for Christmas dinner,(which I think you will find is against all the health and safety rules, so there goes your clean food certificate).\n\nThis intruder also leaves dirty footprints all over the place, and steals the Elf on the shelf. And you really expect them to sleep? But its ok, the burglar or should I say festive thief makes up for his intrusion by leaving an array of gifts, which in theory could be seen as a bribe, but no one wants the police involved, do they?\n\nI think one of my earliest memories of a festive film, was the 1951 version of A Christmas Carol, entitled Scrooge, and starred Alistair Sim in the title role. This is the traditional Dickens tale of ghosts, melancholy and warmth that was brought to the screen by director, Brian Desmond Hurst, and featured the talents of Mervyn Johns, Hugh Williams, Michael Horden, Kathleen Harrison, and Jack Warner.\n\nThe score for the film was the work of Richard Addinsell, who wove into his original music compositions, elements from traditional carols and an arrangement of nursery rhymes such as, Oranges and Lemons, here we go round the Mulberry Bush, and others. The composer also incorporated the familiar sound of a church choir singing Silent Night and other Christmas carols. The soundtrack was a wonderful accompaniment to the narrative and underlined the drama purveying true emotion.\n\nAt times a darker sound being achieved for scenes that included the Ghost of Marley and the ghost of Christmas yet to come. A fifteen-minute suite from the soundtrack was recorded by the BBC Philharmonic under the baton of Rumon Gumba in 2003, for a Chandos records compilation, entitled The Film Music of Richard Addinsell.\n\nThe suite encompassed all the principal thematic material from the score. The compilation also included music from other movies that Addinsell had worked on, these included, Goodbye Mr Chips, Love on the Dole, Blithe Spirit, The Black Rose, Out of the Clouds, Tom Browns Schooldays, The Admirable Crichton, and Dangerous Moonlight which featured Addinsell’s timeless and powerful composition entitled The Warsaw Concerto. The retelling of the famous Dickens tale is a triumph, as is the score.\n\nThe tale of A Christmas Carol is one that has been committed to celluloid many times, and even has taken animated form in films such as Mr. Magoo’s Christmas Carol in 1962.\n\nIt’s a story that lends itself well to cinematic re-imaginings, and I would think that everyone is familiar with the tale in some form or another, whether it be a serious incarnation, or a musical adaptation as in the 1970 version of the story entitled Scrooge with Albert Finney in the title role, supported by Alec Guinness, Edith Evens, Michael Naismith, David Collings, and Kenneth Moore.\n\nDirected by Ronald Neame, the film featured songs and music penned by Leslie Bricusse.\n\nThen there is the version of the tale which stars George C Scott, that is so underrated, with many favouring this than all others. especially the score by Nick Bicat and The Muppet Christmas Carol, where Kermit and the gang take on the roles of the well-known characters with Michael Caine playing Scrooge.\n\nAll these versions and so many more are crammed into the TV schedules for Christmas, there are so many in fact, it’s a wonder that we have the time to watch them all, thank goodness for catch up TV, which will allow us to watch up until Easter and beyond.\n\nA film that I always enjoy is the Holly and the Ivy, a heartwarming and intimate tale, that was released in 1952, it’s a warm but at the same time sobering story about an English minister and his family reunited at Christmas time. Their tale includes a remembrance of their World War II trials. Which goes to make this a poignant and emotion filled story.\n\nDirected by George Moore O Ferrall, the movie starred Ralph Richardson, Celia Johnson, John Gregson, Denholm Elliot, and Margaret Leighton, and had a score by esteemed British composer Malcolm Arnold. Arnold incorporated numerous Christmas songs and carols into the soundtrack and added to these dramatic and romantic tones. The score boasts a rousing and suitably emotive medley of Christmas songs which is still to this day featured in concert.\n\nThe Fantasy or suite features The Holly and The Ivy, Joy to the World, The First Noel, Away in a Manger, I saw three Ships, etc. I saw it performed at the Brighton Dome a few years ago as an encore and it was a fitting conclusion to a concert of British film music. And yes, it was Christmas.\n\nAnother movie that is a regular on our TV screens on and around the festive season is It’s a Wonderful Life, which was directed by Frank Capra and starred James Stewart. It’s a tale of sorrow and one of hope, that has stood well the test of time. Released in 1947, this is a classic in every sense. The film also starred Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers, and Thomas Mitchell. George Bailey (Stewart) has lived his life helping so many people in the small town of Bedford Falls, and although George has often thought of travelling and seeing other places, he never seems to have found the time to do so. He runs a building company and loan business, which his Father established, and he has carried on in his dad’s footsteps helping others.\n\nBut the greed filled Mr Potter (Barrymore) wants the town for himself and is intent on buying it up to control it and its people. The only thing stopping him is George, but after a sum of money goes missing when it is lost, George finds himself in an awkward position, and realises that if he cannot find the money he could go to jail. Which would leave the way open for Potter to carry out his plan. George decides that he cannot face being accused and also that he has let his friends and family down, so thinks that the best way is to commit suicide, thinking if he were not there or even had not been born, that things would have been better for all concerned. His family however disagree, and they pray for him, their prayers are heard in heaven, who dispatch an angel named Clarence to help George, Clarence is told if he succeeds then he will earn his wings. So, Clarence goes about trying to convince George that if he were not around how bad things would have been or at least how different things would have turned out.\n\nThis is a heartwarming piece of cinema and its story I think is not unlike A Christmas Carol. The score is by Dimitri Tiomkin and is a soundtrack that has been available on LP CD and now on digital platforms. All you need on a Christmas weekend is a nice glowing fire, some delicious nibbles, and The Sound of Music, It’s a Wonderful Life and then Mary Poppins in that order.\n\nChristmas TV does have a habit of repeating itself each year, the TV companies thinking to themselves “Well it worked last year and the year before, in fact it worked back in 1968, so why not now”? And why not indeed, does anyone even notice? I can only talk for the UK here, but at Christmas time we invariably get a lot of historical movies and war films being screened, now these are really nothing to do with Christmas, but again I think it’s a case of the film was popular at that time of year, so they continue to show it every time the festive season starts. Dads movies include, The Great Escape for example, which I can guarantee will be on at some time over the festive holiday, along with Zulu, Where Eagles Dare, The Dirty Dozen and maybe even Kelly’s Heroes.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, these are all great movies, and every one of them has a brilliant score, but every year, really! (and Dad is normally asleep when they are on, but he is sitting on the remote, so everyone has to watch them). But what is the alternative?\n\nThink about it, Yes, the dreaded brain numbing waste of air time reality shows,(cue the Psycho strings) or the mundane and send you to sleep quiz shows, (more sinister strings Maestro please) and the talent, or untalented shows, which again raises the question, does Britain really have talent or is it all about the judges here? I am sure if you looked back you would see a schedule from a few years ago that was almost identical to the one that is being shown this year.\n\nLike I say all great movies yes, but why not shake it up a bit and instead of showing The Wizard of Oz, live dangerously and show Return to Oz, just a thought. The Christmas TV schedule is full of non-festive films that are mostly associated with December the 25th or around about that time because they have been shown on the box at this time, but there are many films that are shown over and over at Christmas that themselves are set during the season of good will. Some are syrupy, filled with melancholy and warmth but others have a darker side.\n\nGremlins, for example wasreleased in 1984, Joe Dante directed this horror/comedy which has a lot going for it and has remained popular over the years. It did spawn a sequel, yes, Gremlins 2, but this is best left unmentioned, as they should have left the story where it concluded in 1984. Gremlins is a quirky, madcap fast paced tale about little monsters that literally rip their way through the small town of Kingston Falls. Malice and mayhem ensue, as our hero Billy, who is a quiet and mild-mannered bank teller unwittingly releases a whole gang of malevolent loonies after gaining a new pet and violating two of three simple rules that came with it: No water or food after midnight and no bright light. (see I told you read the instructions).\n\nAfter he does this the original pet spawns more of the same, but the new ones are different, they are not cute or cuddly, but violent and murderous. They set out to destroy the town and eliminate anyone or anything that gets in their way (that poor dog). So, when your washing machine blows up or your TV goes on the fritz, before you call the repair man, turn on all the lights and look under all the beds. Because you never can tell, there just might be a gremlin in your house.\n\nThe infectious score was by Jerry Goldsmith, who’s Gremlin rag is just as, and if not more mental and quirkier than the film. At the time of the film’s release, a soundtrack album was issued on vinyl, which had just a selection of the score represented on side A, the other cues being songs from the movie, but thankfully Goldsmith’s masterful soundtrack did get a full release later, and there is a thirty-four-track album available now on digital platforms.\n\nOne cannot help but think of the movie when hearing Goldsmith’s music, it is a score which works on so many levels, and not only supports the darker moments but wonderfully punctuates the comedic moods in the story. It also has a subtle and lullaby like central theme to accompany Gizmo (he is the nice one).\n\nAnother movie set at Christmas is Home Alone, the original in the series being the best in my humble opinion, and although it might be a nice idea to leave a troublesome child at home for Christmas whilst you swan off on holiday, who would actually do that? As once could be seen as a mistake, but after that, surely social services should be informed. I am sure Kevin would appreciate some honesty here from his parents, a simple “Look kid we don’t like you” would suffice, yes? The first movie was brilliant and it’s a film that I would gladly sit and watch right now, I felt sorry for those poor wet bandits who did not know what hit them. Joe Pesci is superb as is his buffoon like partner Marv played by Daniel Stern. Macauly Culkin is the star of the movie though and is a cherub like but at the same time sinister Dennis the menace character. Culkin did the first two movies as Kevin, but Home Alone 3, was certainly a lack lustre affair, and being minus Culkin also meant that it was less popular, going straight to video in the UK. Every movie after this in the series got progressively worse, the concept becoming rather stale and unappealing. The music for the first two tales in the series was by John Williams, and his score for the original movie is in a word joyous.\n\nHis artistry on the film shows us why he is still one of the most sought-after composers of film music today. The music being precise and supportive throughout, the composers timing for the comedic and hap hazard thieves being a highlight. Williams created new Christmas slanted themes such as Somewhere in my Memory for the movie and combined these with already established festive melodies.\n\nThe Carol of the Bells acting as a foundation of the work, with the composer building everything around this and his original central theme, fashioning a dramatic, sometimes dark, and suspenseful soundtrack, that also contains numerous moments of poignancy, melancholy and levels of emotion that are affecting as well as being effective. The original score is embellished with popular Christmas songs, which are also colourful and supportive, and add much to the impact of the storylines many moods and scenarios. It is without a doubt one of the composers most entertaining works.\n\nI suppose a Christmas movie or a film that is shown at that time of year does not really have to be about Christmas or indeed contain nice warm thoughts and actions. As in Die Hard, and Lethal Weapon etc. It is more about the individual who is watching the movie, and if they associate it with the festive season. But so as not to confuse things I will for the next couple of examples at least stick with more traditional fare.\n\nAn example that I think is very overrated is Santa Claus the Movie, I have always thought that the film was a wasted opportunity, with lack lustre performances and FX that when you see them now are quite badly executed. The best thing about the movie is probably the score by Henry Mancini, and this is even somewhat disappointing in areas. When originally released the soundtrack was issued on an LP record, then a CD became available and then much later the score was re-issued onto CD again but with far superior sound quality (or so they told us). But even then, some collectors were not happy with it. The movie was I thought a pointless exercise,\n\nDudley Moore was not good as Patch the wayward Elf, and John Lithgow seemed to be somewhat uncomfortable in his role, however David Huddleson was a wonderful Santa, it’s a modern-day tale of how Santa fails to keep up with modern tech as in the production of toys etc and keeping up with the ever-growing demand from children all over the world. With one of the big man’s elves Patch basically going over to the dark side after being manipulated by an unscrupulous company executive.\n\nIt was directed by Jeannot Szwarc and was to be the last major fantasy film produced by the Paris-based father-and-son production team of Alexander and Ilya Salkind, who were responsible for making us believe a man could fly in the Superman movies.\n\nMancini’s score was cliched and far too sentimental, and yes I know the film too was filled with sentimentality and sugary lines and scenarios, but it was a score that I thought fell short and although there were a few “Nice” moments, it was under par and whimsical.\n\nIts also a score and movie that certainly does not improve with age, as the music has not stood the test of time well and the storyline is predictable, and the effects stand out like the proverbial sore thumb. But remember this is just my opinion.\n\nA movie that also had an elf as its main focus was Elf, (well there’s a surprise). This is I have to say on my nice list of movies that should be watched every Christmas, very much like Hocus Pocus must be seen at Halloween. It is a far-fetched and somewhat predictable film, but also is a fun filled romp that like Home Alone has some classic screen moments and slaying one liners and situations.\n\nThe central character Buddy the Elf is played convincingly by Will Ferrell, who accidently is taken to the north pole one Christmas by Santa after baby Buddy hides in Santa’s sack whilst he is delivering presents. Buddy is raised as an Elf at the North pole, (even if he is a very tall one). Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tries to guide him but things become increasingly difficult as Buddy reaches adulthood. It is then that Buddy decides he will go to New York and find his real Father Walter Hobbs (James Caan), who is a successful businessman, and it soon materialises that he is in desperate need of some Christmas spirit.\n\nThings don’t go exactly to plan and Buddy ends up upsetting his new family, but on Christmas eve Santa finds himself being pursued in central park by the mounted park rangers after his sleigh breaks down, and its then, Buddy to the rescue, as the Elf enlists the help of everyone to generate some much needed Christmas spirit so that Santa and his reindeer can escape and carry on delivering presents around the world. The film is an hilarious and emotional tale, with an effective and catchy score by composer John Debney.\n\nThe music was released at the time of the film being in cinema’s and is available on digital platforms, with an expanded edition of the score being released a little while ago onto compact disc.\n\nLet’s go back to the connection between ghost stories and Christmas shall we. like I have already said not all ghost tales are Christmas based or even related, but it is something of a tradition that ghost tales and Yuletide go hand in hand. So, there are normally a fair few movies that deal with the paranormal around on the small screen at the festive time of the year. The Others, The Haunting, The Legend of Hell House, The Innocents, The Amazing Mr Blunden, and Ghost.\n\nAll of which are regulars mostly for late night viewing, except for maybe The Amazing Mr Blunden. Which although a Ghost story has to it a kind of Railway Children ring. The score for Mr Blunden was by Elmer Bernstein, who composed a quintessentially British sounding work for the movie. It was a soundtrack that went unreleased for many years and was finally issued onto CD in 2019, thirty-seven years after the film was originally in cinemas in 1972. The movie was based upon the 1969 novel written by Antonia Barber entitled The Ghosts and directed by Lionel Jefferies. A mysterious old solicitor visits a Mrs. Allen and her young children in her squalid, tiny Camden Town flat, and makes her an offer that she cannot really say no too. Her and her family of three children become the housekeepers to a derelict country mansion in the charge of the solicitors. After a while the two eldest children meet the spirits of two other children who died in the mansion when it was gutted by fire a century before.\n\nThe children prepare a magic potion that allows them to travel backwards in time to the era of the ghost children in a bid to help them. The movie featured Laurence Naismith, Graham Crowden and Dorothy Allison, with Lynne Frederick and Gary Miller as the mortal children, who attempt to put things right. It also contained performances from Diana Dors, and Madeline Smith.\n\nAn effective ghostly tale that will delight many younger film buffs. Staying with Ghost tales and Elmer Bernstein, we could not discuss paranormal events on the small screen at Christmas without mentioning the 1984 movie Ghostbusters, it’s a firm favourite with many of all ages, and is one that screens regularly. It is a movie that does show signs of time not being kind to it, but nevertheless is still entertaining in a zany kind of way, and recently we have seen more additions to the Ghostbusters franchise via streaming channels such as Netflix.\n\nIt’s a film that is certainly not just for Christmas but can be returned to at any time of the year. I suppose because it was so quirky and different, is why it remains so popular.\n\nThe other ghost films I mentioned as in, The Others etc, are all in my opinion terrifying tales, The Haunting from 1963, especially being one that is superbly unsettling and harrowing. It’s a film to sit down and immerse oneself in, maybe even on Christmas night, but please do not watch it alone. At Christmas,\n\nTV channels tend to show an entire series of movies or at least the movies that are available to them from the series, such as Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc,(even though they had already been shown on one of the other channels around a week before), and I remember last year one of the channels screened the entire Rocky series, over two nights just after Christmas, I did think at the time they missed a trick as they should have shown at least the first three on Boxing Day!!!!!But maybe that’s just too cliched even for British TV.\n\nWe can take comfort in the fact that whatever TV channels have lined up for us, it will invariably be familiar, as in repeats of various shows such as Morecombe and Wise, which is no bad thing (I hope they show the one with the Singing in the Rain sequence or the Andre Previn or even The Stripper).\n\nAnd whilst talking about musicals, (yes, I mentioned Singing in the Rain-which leads us nicely into this). Musicals do feature large at Christmas time. Whether they be old or more recent, the musical seems to appeal to all, the films shown could be or are invariably things such as The Sound of Music, or even West Side Story (the original).\n\nChristmas seems to be a time that TV companies think is the time to burst into song. I don’t mind a musical, especially if its Sondheim, his Into the Woods is brilliant. But channels such as the BBC seem to favour the more traditional type of movie musical as in Fiddler on the Roof, South Pacific, Oliver, Paint your Wagon, Camelot, The King and I, etc, etc etc, and let’s not forget The Wizard of Oz which was also a musical.\n\nSo, if you love Lerner and Lowe, or favour Rogers and Hammerstein, or maybe prefer something more contemporary like La La Land and The Greatest Showman, there will be I am sure something on the box for you this year. Then there are the old faithful’s as in Disney’s animated tales, not necessarily Christmas based but always welcomed at this time of year. With some of these being musicals as well as magical animated stories. Then there are the Gothic horrors from the likes of Hammer, Amicus, and American International etc, and we always have the old TV shows as in the Christmas specials, from the likes of Eric and Ernie, and repeats of Open all Hours, Only Fools and Horses, and there is the Doctor Who Christmas special, where he or she will probably save the world again.\n\nPlus, on Christmas day a guilty pleasure in the form of Call the Midwife.\n\nSo, I suppose the TV companies have got it right, because at Christmas all we really want is to relax and feel comfortable, Yes? So, sit back, turn the lights down, get the nuts and nibbles ready, and look out for those ads for Easter Eggs. It’s like jumping in your own private time machine and going back a few years for a bygone Christmas of Entertainment sometimes, but its familiar and there are very few surprises, which can at times be something of a comfort. With songs that we probably know all the words to, and films where we could easily play every character and know what music comes in where. Happy Easter everyone.\n\nA look at the films that inspired so many to make movies. I just scratch the surface with a handful of titles, that I would refer to as iconic Italian Cinema.\n\nWhen Italy entered the second world war on the side of the Nazi’s in 1940, the Cinecitta studios were commandeered by Mussolini who put his army in charge of them. This meant that filmmakers found themselves without a location to make movies, and thus it was at this time that directors decided to take to the streets of Rome and other cities to commit to celluloid their hopes, dreams, and visions.\n\nFilmmakers such as Visconti, Rossellini, and De Sica, who were to become known as the pioneers of the neorealism movement in Italy, went onto the streets and began filming in real locations, shooting their movies in natural light without the assistance of any artificial or studio lighting.\n\nThe movies that they produced were seen as true to life, the people of Italy taking them as more realistic documentations of life in the country at the time, rather than the contrived and flawless visions of utopia as conveyed by the Fascists.\n\nThese Golden age productions as they were also referred to, included seminal Italian films, such as Roma Citta Aperta, Ladri di Bicicletti, I Vitelloni, La Strada, and Viaggio in Italia.\n\nThe movies often using unknown actors or even just ordinary members of the public, setting the story in depraved areas of a city, and focusing upon the poorest people in the country. Whilst also at the same time concentrating upon the struggles of the working class. This type of film was at its most prominent from 1943 to 1952 and showed a side to life that was directly the opposite to that which was being purveyed by Hollywood filmmakers, Ironically the films now referred to as Neo Realism proved to be popular with audiences outside of Italy and being more appealing mostly to audiences more in the States and the UK. It was the realism, the grittiness and the more often than not, monochrome photography that too added an attraction to this genre. In the spring of 1945, the grip of Mussolini over the Italian people came to an end, when Il Duce was executed, and Italy was liberated from German occupation.\n\nThis period became known as the Italian Spring, which saw a break from old ways in the country and fostered a more realistic approach to making films. Italian cinema and movie producers stopped utilizing elaborate studio sets and began more frequently shooting on location in the countryside and city streets in a realist style.\n\nAlthough the birth of neorealism in Italy has been widely disputed by academics and filmmakers alike, the first neorealist film is thought to be Luchino Visconti’s Ossessione, which was released in 1943, during the German occupation of the country. The genre itself was influenced by Poetic Realism, Marxism, and Christian Humanism, and in turn it influenced, French New Wave Cinema, Cinema Novo and Iranian New Wave as well as others.\n\nThe style employed within the Italian films in the genre was influential through the decades, and a similar style of filming and using non actors in various scenes can be seen in films such as in Kubrick’ Spartacus, and Pontecorvo’s Battle of Algiers, and Quemada. Even the films of British directors Ken Loach, Ken Russel, and Mike Leigh are too a degree influenced by this style of filming, the filmmakers very often opting to go with lesser-known actors in some of the roles and camera work that resembles a documentary style at times, as in Peterloo in the case of Leigh.\n\nBoth Leigh and Loach have a lifelike social and practical style of direction, their movies often focusing on the British working class, very like Italian directors focused upon the day-to-day struggles of the working class in Italy. With actors speaking in their native language or in the case of British movies the accent/dialect of the region that they came from. Loach said that using subtitles would be preferable rather than asking actors to change the way they speak, because by asking them to do this, would make the performance false. The neorealist style in Italy was developed by a circle of film critics that contributed to the magazine Cinema, including: the already mentioned Visconti and the likes of Gianni Puccini, Cesare Zavattini, Guiseppe De Santis and Pietro Ingrao. Who at the time were restricted in what they wrote in the way of politics because Mussolini’s son was editor in chief of the publication. Several of the filmmakers involved with neorealism, learnt their craft whilst working on the Calligrafismo genre of movies which were popular during the early part of the 1940’s. This genre is a complex form of cinema, which is adept at recalling many cultural tendencies and, at the same time, of co-ordinating them in a comprehensive communicative, and dramatic form.\n\nI am going to begin my look at films in the category of Neorealism with Roma Citta Aperta, or Rome open City. I will begin with the musical score because I am not sure why but the scores for many of the neo realism movies seem to have faded into obscurity.\n\nThe music for Rome Open City was penned by Renzo Rossellini. Who was the younger brother of Roberto Rossellini who directed the movie. Renzo was born on February 2nd, 1908, in Rome, Lazio, Italy. He was a composer and actor, known for Rome, Open City (1945), I Fratelli Karamazoff (1947) and Paisan (1946). He died on May 13, 1982, in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n\nThe soundtrack from Rome Open City was never released, although there is a two-minute cue from the score on Amazon music, which has very bad sound quality. For most of the movie’s duration the music works as a good film score should, extenuating and supporting without being intrusive or overpowering, even if the music is almost continuous, which was the style at this time.\n\nSet in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Rome the eternal city, the film Rome Open City is the first in a trilogy of war movies helmed by Filmmaker Roberto Rossellini, the film shows the watching audience what life was like under the heel of a cruel and oppressive occupier in the form of Nazi Germany. It focuses upon the day-to-day existence that ordinary people are enduring under ever increasingly difficult circumstances, concentrating of a handful of figures working for the resistance who are attempting bravely to resist the occupiers. Many say that the movie is a propaganda exercise, but there is so much more to this iconic piece of cinema.\n\nThe director sees the resistance against the invaders through the eyes of not just the people, but via the actual city itself. With the familiar sights of Rome taking centre stage to the narrative, becoming more like a character within the storyline rather than just a location.\n\nIt is a powerful and compelling tale that was co-written by Federico Fellini, and the way in which Rossellini navigates the production in a very documentary like style, adds greater impact and creates higher levels of emotion to the proceedings. The images created being some of the most touching and moving in the history of cinema.\n\nThe next movie I suppose can be compared to the work of the likes of Chaplin on The Kid and maybe might have served as some of the inspiration, emotion, courage, and sentiment that we see in the Hollywood blockbuster The Champ. Ladri di Biciclette / The Bicycle Thieves from 1948 is maybe the most intense drama about a boy and his father in the history of cinema. One of the main characters Antonio, earns a living from, and feeds his family by using his bicycle. One day the bicycle is stolen, and Antonio wanders the streets of Rome trying to find it.\n\nHis son Bruno accompanies him in his search, the relationship that we see between father and son on screen is somewhat like that of the relationship we will witness in a later De Sica movie between an elderly man and his dog, in the superb Umberto D (1952). Antonio and his son lose their faith in finding the stolen bike and at the same time lose faith in humanity and life itself.\n\nThe musical score by Alesandro Cicognini, is superb, and is a wonderfully supportive and expressive soundtrack. I often think that there could be a compilation of the music from these Italian classics, in a similar way that CAM records released the scores from the films of Fellini, which were by the likes of Rota and Bacalov. But, apart from the odd track here and there on digital platforms and you tube the genre goes musically unrepresented as it were.\n\nI suppose because of the age of the films and the sound quality of some of the recordings which were made during World War two or just after, it’s hardly surprising that full scores do not exist. However, maybe a selection of suites from a handful of the movies could be reconstructed and re-recorded and given a new lease of life and thus preserving them for future generations. But I am dreaming again. Because Neo-realism had a short life only running from 1945 through to 1952, it is a genre or a collection of movies that stand out because there are relatively few of them, but they are all wonderfully expressive and made with a care and precision by the directors and the producers that were involved under extraordinary conditions. It is a genre of film that has endured and maintained a fascination for many as well as attracting new followers of all ages and continues to do so after all these years.\n\nThe next movie is from director, Luciano Visconti, La Terra Trema /The Earth Trembles which was released in the same year as The Bicycle Thieves, tells the story of poor Sicilian fishermen who are being exploited by fish wholesalers. One of the families involved is trying to escape the restrictions that the rich employers have imposed upon them and buy their own boat. But even their fellow fisherman and villagers refuse to help them in any way, because they fear the ramifications from the bosses if they do. Even the weather it seems is against them and their venture. The movie is divided into five sections, that include three main narratives, a prologue or introduction and an epilogue. The first part of the story explains who the Valasros family are, and their attempt to improve their standard of living by breaking away from greedy employers and buying their own fishing vessel.\n\nThey tell the wholesalers at the market that they deserve better prices for their catch, but this ends in chaos and one of the family the eldest son Ntoni being arrested and put into jail for throwing a set of weighing scales into the sea. But the bosses soon realise it is better to have them out of jail and working so that they can continue to profiteer from the fisherman’s hard work. The family had previously attempted to form a co-operative of all the fisherman to make sure everyone got a fair price, but this was stopped, and no one joined. So, the family then mortgage their home and buy a boat and start their own business. The second part of the story shows the watching audience how vulnerable and alone that the family are, and their realization that maybe being your own boss is not as glamorous and profitable as they first thought, not considering that being their own boss also made them responsible for the costs of maintenance etc on the boat. When they set off and a violent storm strikes it damages their craft badly. But they have no money to repair it, at this stage in the story the other fishermen encouraged by the wholesalers begin to ridicule them.\n\nThe third part of the story focuses upon how the family becomes even more vulnerable and how their lives decline, with the social aspects of the situation for the family being revealed. Basically, they have done all of this for nothing, to make no progress because even though they had their own boat the wholesalers still set a price for the fish that they caught. In the movies Epilogue, the eldest son of the family Ntoni, swallows his pride and goes back to work for the bosses again as a labourer in the wholesale market, because they have plenty of work as their profits have made it possible for them to purchase a new fleet of boats. The movie is shot in one place, and apart from the scenes that are filmed on the ocean and the scenarios of when a family member is jailed and then when the family go to the bank to sign the contract for the mortgage, we remain in the village of Aci Trezza, which at times purveys a mood that is somewhat claustrophobic. Whilst thinking of making the movie as early as 1941,\n\nDirector Visconti, was conscious that music would play an important role within the narrative, he enlisted the help of composer and conductor Willy Ferrero who had also directed the music for The Bicycle Thieves, the composer adapted Sicilian folk songs and tailored these to meet the needs of the film. But on watching the movie one does notice that the use of any kind of music is rather sparing, until that is we move towards the story’s conclusion, when we hear more underscore beginning to edge its way into the proceedings. This has a tragic style that effectively underlines and supports the family’s fate, containing shades of melancholy and purveying a mood of isolation. Other than this the director relies upon the natural sounds of the sea and the wind, shouts and sounds from the village streets, whistling from one of the characters in the movie, plus emotive and melodic pieces played by another family member on screen.\n\nThe composer Willy Ferrero was born in the United States to Italian parents, he was to become an important figure in the musical world of the neo realism movies as produced in Italy, born May 21,1906 in Portland, Oregon, he began his career surprising everyone by directing orchestral concerts at the age of six years. He was known for being a very sensitive and elegant musician and preferred rhythmical motifs. He has the great merit of having acquainted the wider public to the expressionism of Ravel. He died prematurely on March 23, 1954, in Rome, Italy, after working on a handful of Italian movies, but although his output may not have been in the same league as Nino Rota, his contributions were as expressive and effective as Rota. After the film was completed, a voice-over commentary written by Antonio Pietrangeli had to be added, since no Italian was spoken by the participants. At the beginning of the film, the narrator states that “Italian is not a language of the poor.” Another brilliant example of the neo realism genre.\n\nLuchino Visconti was a director who was to coin a phrase way ahead of his time, he like many other directors that were making movies in the 1940’s through to the 1950’s understood well the impact of cinema upon the masses, Visconti more than other filmmakers took chances with the movies he made, but these more often than not paid off with the director being one of the most successful filmmakers in Italy and now hailed as a genius around the world. He displayed his unquestionable flair for story telling early in his career with the movie Ossessione, which was a movie based upon James Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice, a story that was later committed to celluloid by American filmmakers, but the later version of the tale significantly fades in the shadow of Visconti’s version of the story.\n\nWhen watching the movie, one straight away picks up upon the intensity and passion that the director managed to extract in the performances of the key characters. Clara Calamai is in a word amazing as Giovanna, who decides that she wants to be free from the older man who has given her so many opportunities and transformed her life for the better. Within the last part of the movie, we see the actress at her best in the biting and effective twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed.\n\nEqually excellent is actor Massimo Girotti, who appears as Gino the man who awakens a passion and an obsessive side within Giovanna. Girotti makes the character come to life and makes him so believable, that one forgets that this is a movie. Juan DeLanda portrays Giuseppe, who is the older man who fell in love with Giovanna and her vivacious and lively character. DeLanda also creating a believable and at the same time sorry looking character.\n\nCinematography is the work of Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti, who’s stylish and creative camera work gave the movie a natural appearance. The score was by Giuseppe Rosati, Director Visconti also added the operatic arias of Verdi and Bizet to the soundtrack, which work in the context of the narrative. Ossessione is a film that should be treasured and is a movie that should be shown regularly so that future generations can savour and enjoy it, as this is a master filmmaker at his best.\n\nLet us now turn to Vittorio De Sica’s Umberto D from 1952, which I mentioned briefly at the beginning of this article. As I watched the movie for about the 50th time, I marvelled again at the high level of acting excellence on display by the title character actor Carlo Battisti, who portrays convincingly a retired civil servant called Umberto Domenico Ferrari. Watching the performance, one might think that he is a polished professional, but wait that is not the case, Battisti was a non-pro-actor, which means that he has to be congratulated even more for his stunning performance in the role. It is like he knows instinctively what the director wants from him, the films story is one of loss, and the central character is someone that could be either you or I, having reached the final stages of our lives and taking tentative steps in case we make yet another mistake.\n\nUmberto now retired and has had a life that is filled with work and even more work, for which his past employers are grateful. But now he resides in a damp and desolate looking room that is infested, with his outlook on life being bleak, as is in keeping with numerous neo-realistic examples from Italy. He becomes unwell and is sent to a hospital but upon his return he is told by his landlady that she wants him out, his dirty dank room being ripped apart. He is on the streets, alone and miserable, I say alone but he does have one companion, a small dog called flag, who we soon realise is Umberto’s only friend.\n\nI suppose this part of the story can be to a certain extent likened to a Chaplin film, but there are no comedic interludes, and the central character has no companions apart from the dog. The cinematography is excellent with the camera work of Aldo Graziati following the unlikely friends, with the affection and care for each other shining through all the gloom and misery. It shows us that no matter how bad things are that the strength of a real friendship between a man and his dog can be stronger in dire times than the relationship between two humans.\n\nThe score plays a vital part in creating even more emotion and underlining various scenarios, composer Alessandro Cicognini providing an effective and suitably melancholy soundtrack for the movie, which is subtle but also powerful because of the way the music is placed and orchestrated.\n\nOur next example of Neo realism is set in Northern Italy, in which we see women leave their families and jobs and move to the rice fields to work harvesting the crop. A pair of lovers Francesca (Doris Dowling) and Walter (Vittorio Gassman) are second rate criminals who stage a robbery at a hotel where they steal a valuable gem, after which Francesca joins a group of workers to try and elude capture by the police. One of her fellow workers a young and sensual woman called Silvana (Silvana Mangano), befriends Francesca, and start to become close to her. She finds a beautiful piece of jewellery hidden in in Francesca’s mattress.\n\nAfter arriving at a lodge, they encounter a recently de-mobbed army sergeant Marco portrayed by Raf Vallone, it is not long before he becomes attracted to Sivana. Which leads to a relationship that has tragic consequences. Riso Amaro or Bitter Rice (1949) is an innovative neo-realistic drama that is laced with romance, very much like it’s storyline the visual style of the movie is a combination of both Hollywood melodrama and Italian neorealism.\n\nIt was the film that introduced Silvana Mangano to cinema audiences, who portrays an extremely beautiful and sexy woman. Doris Dowling is also excellent, performing as the long-suffering Francesca, a woman who has been abused by her lover.\n\nDirected by Giuseppe de Santis, the film was scored by Goffredo Petrassi, Petrassi of course is known for his involvement with composers such as Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai who he tutored, the composer scored very few motion pictures as he was primarily known for concert hall compositions.\n\nPetrassi was born near Rome in 1904 and was considered by many to be one of the most significant and influential Italian composers of the 20th Century. At the age of fifteen the young Petrassi began to work in a music shop to support his family, and this is probably where his love and interest of music was expanded and cemented. He is however. more associated with music for the concert hall, with his output in this area being prolific. Because of the composer’s commitments to teaching and the world of classical music his forays into scoring movies were few and far between, although when the composer did work on movie score’s he always produced works that were supportive as well as being thematic. Petrassi began to write for films back in the 1940’s and in total during his career he wrote the music for ten pictures, these included six feature films and four shorts.\n\nThe composer’s credits for film include Bitter Rice, (1949), Under the Olive Tree (1950), La Pattuglia Sperduta (1954), and Cronaca Familiare, (1962).\n\nLa Strada, is the film that established Federico Fellini as a renowned filmmaker. It is the tale of a sweet and angelic girl Gelsomina (Guilietta Masina), who is sold by her mother to a travelling showman Zampano (Anthony Quinn) for 10,000 lire and a few kilos of food.\n\nZampano who exhibits feats of strength by breaking a chain wrapped around his chest, performs in village squares and then passes the hat for whatever the normally small crowd is prepared to give. He teaches Gelsomina a drum roll, as part of his introduction. But he doesn’t treat her well and when she tries to run away, he beats her.\n\nThey eventually join a small traveling circus where they meet a tight-rope walker who convinces Gelsomina to question her what choices she has. Directed by Federico Fellini in 1954, it is aa sad and affecting story, which contains some wonderful performances from Anthony Quinn, Guilietta Masina, and Richard Basehart.\n\nThe haunting an effective music is by Nino Rota, a composer who was to have a long association with Fellini, as well as collaborating with many other Italian filmmakers and then in later years working with American directors.\n\nRota also scored Rocco E I Suoi Fratelli, aka Rocco and His Brothers, which was directed by Luciano Visconti and released in 1960, this is seen as one of the last neo realism movies to come out of Italy during what is termed as the golden age and is also a movie that the director has said is his favourite out of all his films. It acted like a bridge between vintage neo realism and a more contemporary form of the genre. Like many neorealism movies it is at times complex, but then there are joyous and simplistic interludes which makes the movie a delight to sit and watch. All of the cast members are excellent in their portrayal of their characters, each performance being genuine and entertaining.\n\nA young Alain Delon is outstanding as Rocco: who is a gentle and caring individual, who at times because of these qualities is somewhat weak. His brother Simone is quite the opposite and is played by Renato Salvatori who convincingly assumes the persona of the character on screen.\n\nSimone is wild, and unstable, he is also a person who is easily led to fear, addiction, and despair. Another performance in the movie that certainly deserves a mention is that of Katina Paxinou’s in the role of the boy’s mother Rosaria: she is religious and at times a little superstitious but has a domineering control over her sons. But saying this she is mostly good hearted and kind.\n\nA mention should also be made of a minor role played by Claudia Cardinale as Ginetta. Rocco E I Suoi Fratelli, is probably Visconti’s most powerful movie, though on watching the film today it may seem a little dated, but that is to be expected as it was made over four decades ago, I think it is a window into the Italy of the 1960’s at a time when cinema in Italy was developing and becoming a medium that many other countries were taking their lead from.\n\nNino Rota’s haunting score is rich, but also subdued, the composer relying on sparse sounding motifs to accompany the storyline. As one sits and listens to the score one can pick out slitters of themes that the composer used in later movies with one reoccurring theme in particular baring a striking resemblance to his work of The Godfather some twelve years later.\n\nIn 1955 Rota also penned the score for Il Bidone, which focuses upon three men, Augusto, Carlo, and Roberto who are all con artists, but sometimes work together. Augusto is the oldest, and the most experienced in his role of a deceiver. They all seem to be immune from any feelings of guilt, and to the idea that their victims are not wealthy highflyers but are mostly uneducated peasants. Each of the trio of villain’s is at a different stage of life, Carlo and Augusto begin to examine what they’re doing more critically, their doubts about what they do to make money stemming from a certain incident. But Roberto, who is the youngest of the three is still living for the moment as it were, never thinking of the future, and always prepared to take money from anyone, without any conscious. Carlo yearns to make a legitimate living as an artist, and this is why he is nicknamed Picasso, he knows that he can do it but can he earn a living from it? Carlo’s wife Iris, and their adolescent daughter Silvania stand by him no matter what. Carlo has told Iris that his frequent absences is because of his job as a travelling salesman with Augusto, but she decides enough is enough as she can no longer bury her head in the sand about what he’s doing. Carlo meets his young daughter who he at first does not recognise, as he has not seen her for years. He must decide to either help her further her education and or change his lifestyle. The movie featured two American stars Richard Basehart as Carlo, and Broderick Crawford as Augusto, with Italian actress Giulietta Masina as Iris and Franco Fabrizi as Roberto.\n\nBorn in Milan in 1911 into a family of musicians, Nino Rota was first a student of Orefice and Pizzetti. Then, still a child, he moved to Rome where he completed his studies at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1929 with Alfredo Casella. Nino Rota began his involvement with film scoring in 1933 with his work on Treno Popolare, he was 22 years of age, since that first assignment the composer was to work on literally hundreds of film and TV projects and was responsible in my opinion for placing Italian film music on the map and paved the way for the likes of Ennio Morricone, Bruno Nicolai and their like.\n\nRota was able to create numerous themes and scores that had to them a haunting and lasting appeal, they were also appealing because of their simplicity and their ability to mesmerize and attract both in the context of the music and image working in unison and as melodic and alluring music away from those images. And although he was much in demand during the 1940’s, 1950’s and the 1960’s when he created memorable themes and scores such as Romeo and Juliet, The Leopard, The Taming of the Shrew and Juliet of the Spirits to mention but a few. He continued to fashion quirky but at the same time classically laced works for the silver screen into the 1970’s.\n\nScoring many movies for the respected and esteemed filmmaker Federico Fellini and working on blockbusters that included Waterloo, and box office draws such as Death on The Nile. Rota had a distinct style of scoring, at times his music was an integral component of the storytelling, on other occasions it was a subdued background to the action, but his style and sound lent much to every movie that he was involved with.\n\nWhat would Amacord be without its now familiar theme. The last motion picture he worked on was The Hurricane in 1979. He died relatively young at the age of 67, in Rome on April 10th, 1979.\n\nA group of women wait silently and nervously at a mine in Sicily, their menfolk are underground. The sulphur mine where they are employed is shutting down and the miners have decided to stay underground to change the minds of the owners of the mine. But they also know that if they stay underground more than three days they could die. After they return to surface somewhat despairingly, they all go to a bar where workers are being recruited to work for a French employer, the man doing the recruiting Cicco (Saro Urzi) tells the miners he can get them over the border for 20,000 lire per person. A bus load of people decides to take a chance and head for the border with their belongings, paying out the money in a last-ditch attempt to get decent jobs with fair wages. This is the story or at least the beginning of it for the movie The Path of Hope which was released in 1950.\n\nAmongst the bus passengers are Saro (Raf Vallone), and his three young children, Barbara (Elana Varzi), and her partner Vanni, (Franco Navarra) the latter pair are in trouble with the police and being hunted. They transfer from the bus to train and when it arrives in Napoli Cicco tries to run off with everyone’s money but is stopped by Vanni. Vanni makes plans with Barbara to meet at the border if anything should go wrong. When they arrive in Rome, Cicco alerts the police to Vanni, and in the ensuing gunfight both Vanni and Cicco manage to escape. All the other people on the bus are arrested and are ordered to return to Sicily, or they will be charged with illegal entry into the country and jailed. Which they agree to do, but instead Saro takes charge and the group head north to reach France.\n\nThe journey is a difficult one and the hardship that they suffer on the trek brings Saro and Barbara closer together. Director Pietro Germi’s Il Cammino Della Speranza / The Path of Hope fits perfectly into the genre of Italian neo- realism and has stood the test of time admirably, despite negative critical reviews.\n\nMany see Saro as the hero of this tale, but it is the group of ordinary people who are trying to better themselves that are heroic. Leaving their homes and place of birth to go out into the unknown and risk everything for the chance of employment in another country and a chance to better themselves and their families.\n\nMusic for the movie was the work of revered Italian Maestro Carlo Rustichelli, who wrote a symphonic classically slanted score for the movie, utilising strings and brass to create romantic and dramatic interludes.\n\nBecause of the year in which it was released a soundtrack was never issued, and now I do not think it will ever be. There are so many scores from Italian Neo-realism movies that are not available or at least not available in their complete form. Yes, there are snippets on the likes of you tube, and even a handful of tracks are now available on digital platforms, but the sound quality is distorted and scratchy. At least we have the movies which are a delight to watch and also listen to. This has been a look at the Italian neo-realism genre, there are many other movies within this genre and also movies that came later that were inspired by these black and white classics. If you have not seen these films now is the time to seek them out and I promise that you will not be sorry, they are superb pieces of cinema.\n\nPEPLUM! SWORD AND SANDAL, SWORD, AND FANTASY,\n\nOR ADVENTURE, THAT IS THE QUESTION.\n\nA brief look at the genre that was dubbed Sword and Sandal or Peplum.\n\nHercules, Goliath, Samson, Maciste, and other such characters were regularly featured in Italian produced Sword and Sandal movies, or to give them their correct genre name, Peplum or Pepla. (the latter being the plural). I must say now that I have never been a great fan of this genre, but I also have to admit that the films were bountiful in the action and imagination departments, rich in colours and had wonderful costumes, they also did from time to time have an interesting or quirky storyline, but I personally found these mini epics or Biblical leaning tales a little too slow and at times downright boring.\n\nThey became the staple fodder of many Saturday morning picture clubs that were so popular in the 1960’s in the UK, I am proud to say that I was an ABC Minor, and was one of the kids cheering on the hero and hissing and booing the in the traditional pantomime way. At the time of seeing my first Peplum I was very young, probably about eight or nine years of age, so this would have been around 1963 or 64, but I knew even then that these movies were different as in sometimes the actor’s mouths did not move when dialogue was being heard. (not that you could hear it most of the time above the hullabaloo of the kids screaming).\n\nOf course, dubbing improved as the years rolled forward, but I still never appreciated fully the antics of Gladiators, Romans, Greeks, Barbarians, and Saracens as various scenarios played out on screen in these dramas that were set in ancient times. But saying that I did enjoy films such as El Cid and Spartacus.\n\nCompared to the adventures of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon, which were also regulars at the Saturday morning fracas, the Sword and Sandal tales seemed rather tame, after all Buck and Flash were real heroes who fought the bad guys and always won. And the episodes all had cliffhanger endings, with a trailer for the next episode being shown as soon as the action had finished with a voice over telling everyone in the cinema “Don’t Miss the Next Thrilling Episode”.\n\nI think it was the duration of those early peplums that I had the problem with, a serial would be twenty or maybe thirty mins in length whereas a feature film would be at least eighty, which for an eight- or nine-year-old is a long time to sit still in itchy seats dodging kia-ora orange drink cartons that were being thrown everywhere and trying to make head or tail of what was going on up there on the screen.\n\nAs I said I think my first real encounter with an Italian sword and sandal epic was in the early 1960’s, when the Astoria cinema was showing Goliath and the Barbarians, starring the muscle-bound American actor, Steeve Reeves who was supported by Chelo Alonso as the love interest (she played a small part in Leone’s The Good the Bad and The Ugly at the beginning of the movie, Angel eyes killed her husband).\n\nThe original title of the film was Il Terrore dei Barbari, which I found out years later, so was it really anything to do with Goliath at all? Its tag line said it all, A Thousand and One Women Dream of his Embrace! I think I enjoyed it, I say I think because I can’t really recall much about it, all I knew at the time that there was a lot of swordfights going on, displays of strength and nasty baddies, with the central character being the hero of the piece even if he did kiss that girl in the film (Yuk).\n\nSo maybe I will start my look at the Peplum or The Sword and Sandal adventure genre with this movie from 1959. Although it was produced in the final year o"
