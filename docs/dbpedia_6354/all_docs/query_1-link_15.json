        "text": "Kind of funny to look back on posts you made years ago. Looking back, I don't remember Black Hawk Down being that bad. Honestly don't remember it leaving a huge impression on me either way. Not really sure why I put it on this list, I get the feeling I'd probably appreciate it more on a rewatch. Certainly didn't seem like \"worst movie I've seen\" material.\n\nI'd also toss Secret Life of Pets on here with the Illumination movies. I've had the displeasure of sitting through that movie at least twice, and it's such a slog. It blatantly copies story/emotional beats from better movies like Toy Story without really adding a new spin. Feels less like taking inspiration to craft something new, and more like just cynically plugging in tropes that worked in other movies. This movie could be the poster boy for \"created-by-committee trash\". Not Illumination, but I'd toss the Boss Baby movies in that camp too.\n\nI'm cautious about labeling newer franchise movies \"the worst\" because it's easy to have that knee-jerk reaction, but I think five years is enough time to cement The Rise of Skywalker as one of the worst movies I've seen. Bad Star Wars movies are nothing new, but even stuff like the Prequels and Last Jedi have personality and vision. TROS is just bland and forgettable, while somehow also being nauseating and obnoxious. I disagree with a lot of the story decisions in TLJ, but at least that movie's watchable. I'm fine with a lot of TROS's story decisions (I actually like Rey being a Palpatine), but find the execution unwatchably bad.\n\nI just finished rewatching it.\n\nCredits are rolling as I type.\n\nBest part of this movie is Frank & Lonette’s tragic romance. Since he’s human, they can’t really “be together.” It’s the only conflict in the movie that’s interesting. Kind of a Rogue & Gambit deal.\n\nFrank (Brad Pitt) is basically holding this movie together, but it’s like trying to keep the tide from coming in.\n\nThe character designs are unappealing save for 1 or 2 characters. Holli & Lonette, being drawn to look the most human with semi-realistic proportions, look out of place next to literally everything else in the toon world.\n\nAnd the animation- yes, I would agree that most of it appears no better than tv quality. The Disney Afternoon was doing better stuff than this at the time. Batman the Animated Series came out at the same time & looked better than this.\n\nI will credit Holli’s animations though. They spent a lot more time & money on those. But again, it looks so weird with her fluid animations next to the more choppily animated characters.\n\nAnd then there’s all the random stuff dancing around the borders of the screen. This clip here highlights some of the worst examples of stuff appearing in the foreground, blocking the characters and needlessly distracting from what’s going on.\n\nAnimation aside, the “Cool World” itself is just a constantly annoying setting. Nearly every character there seems hyper-active and crazed.\n\nThe story has a glimmer of something interesting with the concept that this cartoon world has existed in another dimension for a long time & this guy, Jack Deebs, has been having visions of the place for years & has used those visions as inspiration for his own comic book.\n\nHe thinks he created the Cool World, but nope. So that was kind of cool. But very little is done with it other than to tell Jack that no, he didn’t create Cool World.\n\nAnd crossing over between the real & toon world seems to just happen whenever people feel like. This toon doctor at the start uses a Spike device to transport Frank over.\n\nBut then later Holli just wills Jack into the Cool World. And then no one seems to have any trouble going back to the real world. They didn’t need the Spike to travel back.\n\nThe finale has Jack literally turn into a Superman ripoff & become a totally clueless goofball. He’s literally a different character. It’s not Jack anymore.\n\nThere’s a neighbor girl that helps them out & is right there when all this crazy stuff is happening. So you might think that they’ll kick off a little romance, but nope. She’s left in the real world, while everyone else bails.\n\nInstead Super Jack ends up with Holli, despite the fact that she’s the main antagonist of the movie & had killed Frank a few minutes earlier. She doesn’t seem super thrilled about being stuck with Jack, but still.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve watched it since it came out in 1992, and I don’t think I’ll ever watch it again.\n\nSometimes, the worst movie is not one that's just a bad movie; it's a movie that's either forgettable or simply lost its point halfway. Here are a couple of examples:\n\nThe Time Machine (2002). A modern adaptation of H. G. Wells' 1895 novel and a remake of the 1960 film, this version was directed by Wells' great-grandson Simon Wells, who was previously known for directing the animated films An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, We're Back! A Dinosaur Story, and Balto, as well as a co-director of The Prince of Egypt. The film stars Guy Pearce, Samantha Mumba, Orlando Jones, and Jeremy Irons. While a modern version of The Time Machine sounds like a good idea, the execution of this version completely falls off the rails once the aforementioned time machine is activated. This film is a complete snoozefest that feels like forever for a 96-minute feature. The acting is forgettable and the CGI effects have not aged well at all. With a box office gross of $123.7 million against a budget of $80 million, The Time Machine was a financial flop for DreamWorks and Warner Bros. A Rotten Tomatoes rating of 28% and a Metacritic score of 42 out of 100 shows that critics were not fans of this adaptation, either. As for Simon Wells, he would not direct a live-action film again. Then he committed career suicide with Disney's Mars Needs Moms in 2011.\n\nSky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004). Written and directed by Kerry Conran and starring Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bai Ling, and Angelina Jolie, as well as a digital resurrection of Sir Laurence Olivier, this is supposed to be a modern homage to comic books, pulp magazines, and film serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Sure, it sounds like a great idea on paper, but the finished product is all sorts of \"meh\". The concept and plot become forgettable after first viewing. Worse is that the CGI effects are PlayStation 2 level, and have aged like milk. It also crashed and burned at the box office, making only $57.9 million against a $70 million budget. Conran would never direct another full-length feature again after his dream project that was Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow."
