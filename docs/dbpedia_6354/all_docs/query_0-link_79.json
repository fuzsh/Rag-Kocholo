        "text": "If you are of a certain age, you will probably like myself remember the many horror movies that were produced by Hammer Films in the UK.\n\nThe name of Hammer became synonymous with the horror genre and was linked invariably to films which were referred to as Gothic Horrors. These included tales of Vampires, Unmentionable Horrors, Zombies, Werewolves, and the occasional Mummy or two.\n\nThe Hammer movies from the late 1950’s through to the late 1970’s were always popular even when shown on a re-run, and when eventually the cinema going audiences appetite for such tales began to wane, the studio were able to rest upon their substantial laurels, releasing many of their films onto video and later to DVD and Blu Ray, plus of course the movies were regularly shown on television, attracting even more fans who had missed them first time around. The name of Hammer had always been at the forefront of British Horror, and even now some sixty years on when people see the name Hammer on screen, they know instinctively it is often a horror film.\n\nThe earlier Hammer productions such as Dracula, The Curse of Frankenstein, The Mummy and The Curse of the Werewolf, had to them a look that was shall we say easy on the eye, the colours the sets, and of course the storylines were outstanding, with the photography on many of them being vibrant, with rich and luxurious colours giving the storylines an almost opulent appearance.\n\nFilms such as The Plague of the Zombies, and The Curse of the Werewolf, just had a look that (forgive the pun) screamed quality. The studio too invested in having top notch actors, and beautiful leading ladies. Familiar faces would crop up in each movie, with many of the sets being re-cycled and utilised over and over in varying scenarios, and for the most part being filmed at Bray studios.\n\nAnother important component within Hammer productions was the music, again the company invested wisely and heavily in this side of things, often engaging composers and musicians at the top of their game at the time to score and perform on their soundtracks. They also operated a studio system whereas they appointed a musical director, who would select various composers for each movie depending on their experience, whilst at the same time seeking out fresh talent. Over the years I have spoken to many composers that were involved in providing the rich musical tapestry for Hammer productions that we all as film music collectors appreciate greatly. Like many of Hammer’s movies the film scores for their productions have gone down into cinematic history and are oft called classics and iconic works.\n\nOver four decades or maybe more, I have spoken to many Maestros, who have become part of the Hammer musical story, James Bernard, Harry Robinson, Malcolm Williamson, Tristram Carey, David Sinclair Whittaker, Carlo Martelli, Laurie Johnson, Christopher Gunning, Roy Budd, etc, and have also written biographies on so many others, Don Banks, Phillip Martell, Benjamin Frankel, Mario Nascimbene, Malcolm Arnold, John Hollingsworth, Ivor Slaney, Frank Spencer, Don Ellis, and Doreen Carwithen, to name a few.\n\nPlus, have spoken to the surviving spouses or family members of others such as Franz Reizenstein, and Humphrey Searle. The wealth and the quality of the music that was written and recorded for Hammer movies was outstanding, this quality still shining through today. Many of these conversations were recorded and placed onto Movie Music International, thus preserving them for what I hope will be forever, but were presented as separate pieces, features, and articles.\n\nAfter discussing a possible interview with composer Blair Mowat about his music for Hammer’s most recent movie Doctor Jekyll, in 2023. I thought why not combine them all, make these into a long article, a tome, or even a book. Which would chart the history of Hammer’s musical heritage. So here it is, a look into the world of the composers, and the musical directors for The House of Horror.\n\nIt would only be correct to begin with a composer and conductor who is probably mostly associated with Hammer and figures large within British film music. Although John Hollingsworth was not the studios first MD he was certainly the most well-known, he was responsible for scoring, conducting, and supervising the music at Hammer from the early fifties through to the early sixties, it was Hollingsworth that gave composers such as James Bernard, Richard Rodney Bennett, Malcom Williamson, Don Banks and Gary Hughes their breaks into writing for film. Hollingsworth began his duties at Hammer in 1954, his first assignment being The Stranger Came Home. A score that was composed by Leonard Salzedo.\n\nHollingsworth had worked for Hammer previously in 1951, when he acted as musical director on Never Look Back.\n\nBut it was when he took over from the studios MD Frank Spencer full time in 1954, that Hollingsworth began to make his mark upon the high quality of the scores that were utilised by the studio.\n\nHollingsworth had conducted for James Bernard before Hammer, and they collaborated on the music for two BBC radio plays, The Death of Hector and The Duchess of Malfi, and it was the latter score that made Hollingsworth think of Bernard when it came to assigning a composer on The Quatermass Xperiment, the score had originally been given to John Hotchkiss, but because the composer fell ill and could not continue, a composer had to be found quickly.\n\nHollingsworth approached James Bernard, who accepted, and the rest as they say is History as far as Bernard and his association with Hammer films is concerned.\n\nAs the composer recalled, “John Hollingsworth played a tape of my music from The Duchess of Malfi to the director of Quatermass, which was Anthony Hinds, and he agreed to let me write the score. This was my first project for Hammer and more importantly I think my first film score. But I was not allowed to use a full orchestra. I think that John Hollingsworth had decided to see how I got along with just strings and percussion, before letting me loose with a full orchestra,”\n\nJohn Hollingsworth was born in Enfield Middlesex on March 20th, 1916, he was educated at Bradfield college and then went on to study at the Guildhall School of Music. As early as 1937, Hollingsworth had become an accomplished conductor, and found himself directing the London Symphony Orchestra. During the second world war, he joined the RAF, and in 1943, became the first RAF sergeant to conduct The National Symphony Orchestra, he toured with the NSO and gave concerts in both the UK and the USA. He conducted concerts in front of many dignitaries and world leaders, which included, Stalin, Truman, and Churchill. After the war Hollingsworth became much in demand and was made assistant to Muir Matheson and worked on films such as Brief Encounter. After three years he became musical director at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, and Sadlers Wells London. Which was an association that would endure some ten years, he also became principal conductor for The Tunbridge Wells Symphony Orchestra during this time and was assistant conductor to Sir Malcolm Sargent at the Proms. Hollingsworth, stayed at Hammer until 1963, his last full scoring assignment being The Devil Ship Pirates, which had music by Gary Hughes, but Hollingsworth contributed several themes to the score. He had also begun working on The Evil of Frankenstein, which was composed by Don Banks, but became seriously ill and was unable to continue. He died of T.B. on December 29th, 1963.\n\nThere were Musical directors or conductors associated with Hammer before John Hollingsworth, and after his death the studio turned to the likes of Marcus Dods to take over in the interim of Hammer securing a more permanent MD in the form of Phillip Martell. Dods conducted scores such as The Secret of Blood Island in 1965, which had a score by James Bernard. (not to be confused with The Camp on Blood Island, which the studio also produced).\n\nBut before John Hollingsworth there was Frank Spencer who was a composer that contributed to numerous motion pictures and shorts during the 1940, s and up to the late 1950, s.\n\nTo say his contributions to British cinema were immense is certainly something of an understatement, as he was like a Muir Mathieson figure, yet his name is not more widely recognised amongst collectors and aficionados of film music. He was for a short time associated with Hammer films scoring their version of the Dick Barton tales in the form of Dick Barton Strikes Back and writing the scores for movies such as Cloudburst and The Adventures of P.C. 49. Spencer was born on July 19th, 1911, in Edinburgh Scotland. He was the first musical director/supervisor for the Hammer studios, and it was his job to ensure that each of the films that Hammer produced and released received a score that was appropriate, although he was given the title of musical supervisor Spencer often wrote the scores himself.\n\nHis first scoring assignment is documented as The Jack of Diamonds in 1949, directed by Vernon Sewell the film was an adventure tale which focused upon an ex-soldier who persuades the owners of a yacht to take him to the Belgian coast to attempt to recover a treasure chest which he had hidden there during the second world war.\n\nThe film starred, Nigel Patrick, Cyril Raymond and Joan Carrol who was the director’s wife. The film was released by Exclusive films who later also distributed many of the early Hammer movies. During his time at Hammer from 1949 to 1952 Spencer was involved with many movies, Cecilia, (for which he shared a credit with Rupert Grayson), Room To Let, To Have and Hold, The Last Page, (U.S. A. title Man Bait), Two on the Tiles, (which was a Van Dyke release), The Dark Light, Death of an Angel, and The Rossiter Case are just a handful of pictures he wrote for.\n\nHe also worked on a few non-Hammer movies during the same period these included The Cat Girl (for AIP) and The Master Plan, where his stock or library music was used without him being given any credits, he also acted as conductor on a handful of projects these included The Black Widow, which was a thirteen-part serial produced by Republic films in 1951. Spencer contributed much to film as a composer, mentor and musical director, and it is somewhat disconcerting that he is overlooked and almost forgotten.\n\nHis score for Man Bait, is an exciting and dramatic work, with the music at times being placed over sequences that do not contain dialogue, which displays just how much music supports and underlines scenarios and scenes in film. The composer died in 1975.\n\nComposer Ivor Slaney was also someone who contributed much to the world of British cinema and worked on a handful of Hammer productions at times under the supervision of Spencer, this was mainly before the studio became known for producing horror films. Born in West Bromwich in the Midlands of the United Kingdom on May 27th, 1921, his father Ernst Slaney had a big influence upon his leanings towards embarking on a career in music.\n\nErnst was the principal cellist in several orchestras including The Scottish national Orchestra, The Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra and also held positions in the South African broadcasting Corporations Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic. Ivor became a member of the choir at St Stephens church in Bournemouth as a child and it was from here that his love of music began to develop. The young musician began to play the oboe and took a keen interest in the saxophone. Slaney went into the British army and was a member of the band whilst in service which gave him a good basic knowledge of music, this knowledge was increased when he began to be given tuition at Kneller Hall and later when he entered the Royal College of music, where he was given music lessons by Leon Goossens. It was at this time that Slaney met Malcolm Arnold, and the pair of aspiring musicians would often be seen together busking on the streets of London mainly around Kensington. Both Arnold and Slaney would join the London Philharmonic, but Slaney would not stay in a position with the orchestra unlike Arnold who would become one of its principal players. After the second world war Slaney became an oboist in the Covent Garden Opera house orchestra and at times would play in the Boyd Neel orchestra, Slaney being able to change styles and genres and on occasion performing jazz and acting as an accompanist for pianist George Shearing.\n\nAs the 1950, s progressed and the sixties dawned Slaney became in demand as a conductor at times for the BBC on the popular programme Morning Music, he also would conduct the 101 strings on several of their recordings of popular songs and tunes. It was also during this period that Slaney began to become involved with the writing of music for films, at first, he was musical assistant to Herbert Wilcox and would conduct and also do arrangements and orchestrations for Anthony Collins who scored The Lady with the Lamp. In 1952 Slaney worked for Hammer films for the first time, this was for The Lady in the Fog, and it was probably his old friend Malcolm Arnold that suggested Slaney as a possible choice for this assignment, as Arnold had worked on two productions for the company the previous year after Frank Spencer had parted company with them.\n\nSlaney continued to score Hammer productions and decided to do something different on the movie Spaceways, where he employed a big band sound rather than the more conventional use of a symphony orchestra, his approach on this was groundbreaking with the brass section being given a larger slice of the musical pie. He also worked on Face the Music for Michael Carreras in which jazz giant Kenny Baker featured.\n\nWith the advent of commercial television, the composer became even more in demand writing pieces of music to accompany numerous advertisements, as well as writing music for the De Wolfe library which was utilised in radio shows and TV productions of the period, in fact Slaney’s music is still being used today and was featured in more recent productions such as the animated series The Simpsons, and the feature film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The composer also worked on several Children’s film Foundation productions and was responsible for the music and songs for Here Come the Double Deckers, which was a very successful children’s TV series that aired in 1970.\n\nSlaney provided the music for two non-Hammer horror movies Prey and Terror both of which were released in 1978 and directed by Norman J Warren. The music for these movies was not the normal run of the mill horror fare, but were more complex works, working wonderfully with both the storylines and the images on screen. Ivor Slaney passed away in Milford on Sea on March 20th, 1998, he contributed much to the world of film music and made great contributions to the world of music in general.\n\nA name that graced Hammer pictures during the 1960’s was Gary Hughes, who worked on a few historical/adventure dramas for the studio. Born Gareth McClean Hughes on March 21st, 1922, in Nanaimo Canada, Hughes initially began his working career as a print setter but always had a passion for music. Whilst being employed in the printing industry he began to study music in his spare time, he eventually achieved his goal and became a musician, at first as a trombone player and then progressed to doing arrangements, and then finally to becoming a composer. He re-located to England in 1955 with his wife Grace and settled in Richmond Surrey.\n\nHughes continued to do arrangements and work on his own compositions and was asked to arrange music for Sir William Walton, which threw him immediately into the limelight, and it was then that he began to work for several composers who were popular at that time. In 1960, he wrote the music for Linda which was conducted by Muir Mathieson, soon after this and on the recommendation of Mathieson he was recruited by John Hollingsworth for Hammer films and worked on a handful of movies, these included the period dramas, Devil Ship Pirates, The Viking Queen, Pirates of Blood River, A Challenge for Robin Hood, and most notably the swashbuckling English civil War drama The Scarlet Blade which starred Oliver Reed and Lionel Jefferies. Hughes worked with Muir Mathieson for the second time in 1964 on the Cy Enfield directed Hide and Seek. At the age of just 56, the composer passed away in Farnham Surrey, on April 25th, 1978, this was after a series of strokes, the fourth of these proved to be fatal. I feel that the world of film music was a poorer place after his death at such a relatively young age, as I am certain he would have continued to be a sought-after composer of film scores, his music was particularly suited to the adventure movies of the 1960’s but he was a versatile and talented composer, and arranger.\n\nThere is not a great deal of his music available on any format, although GDI records did include a cue by Hughes on The Music from Hammer Films Vol 2, which was the rousing theme from The Pirates of Blood River. The compilation is a must have as it contains so many themes and cues that are now what I would call Hammer classics, the collection and its predecessor volume one, are both crammed with the familiar sounds and rare music from Hammer’s musical archive. The two compilations were the pre-cursor to several releases from GDI the majority of which focused upon the horror scores from the House of horror. Many of these were full score releases for the first time, with others being themed compilations as in The Quatermass Collection, The Frankenstein Collection and The Vampire Collection. The label also released She and The Vengeance of She, by James Bernard and Mario Nascimbene respectively on one compact disc.\n\nThe Music from Hammer Films Volume one.\n\nWhen GDI records first came on the scene, one has to remember that music from the Hammer horrors had not been that readily available, yes ok admittedly there had been a few compilations that had mainly been re-recordings and some of these were released as stories of Dracula etc with music tracked behind the narration, but I think you will agree with me that it was Silva Screen records in the UK that was the first label to make a concerted effort to release music from the Hammer Gothic Horrors, at first they concentrated upon James Bernard, simply because he was the composer that so many associated with the house of horror, because of his memorable and foreboding Dracula soundtracks. But Silva also turned its attention to other composers that had written music for Hammer, but of course these were all re-recordings as the label were told that the original tapes were either lost or destroyed.\n\nThen up popped Gary Wilson and the GDI label, who had the original tapes to many of the Hammer soundtracks. The logical thing for GDI to do was release a compilation, a sort of best of Hammer if you will. The Hammer Film Music Collection,was to be the first compact disc of many in a series dedicated to the rich musical legacy of Hammer.\n\nThis first volume which includedtwenty-fivethemes is a real stunner of a collection, the disc opens with the taught and virulent theme from The Devil Rides Out as composed by James Bernard and is a perfect opener for what is to follow, a compilation that thrills, excites,and oozes evil musical renditions which evoke numerous memories of those brilliant looking horrors. James Bernard is quite rightly given the lion’s share of the disc’s running time, which is a fitting tribute to the man who was the studios composer in residence (or might as well have been) he scored movies for them from the mid 1950’s through to 1974 and was also involved on the TV series that the studio produced for ITV. The compilation boaststen pieces by Bernard, including Dracula and The Devil Rides Outwhich are both still as threatening and atmospheric as they were when I first heard them.\n\nAlso included from Bernard we have The Curse of Frankenstein, Frankenstein Must be Destroyed, The Scars of Dracula, Taste the Blood of Dracula, The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires, Plus, She, The Gorgon, and for me what I consider the best of Bernard in the form of The Kiss of the Vampire, which has a powerful and magnificent piano solo from Douglas Gamley.\n\nScottish born composer Harry Robinson or Robertson is well represented with four themes Twins of Evil, Vampire Lovers, Lust for a Vampire, all from the Karnstein family horrors as produced by Hammer. ,Plus there is also a brief piece from Countess Dracula, which starred the wonderful Ingrid Pitt as the noblewoman who murdered maidens and bathed in their blood to regain her youthful looks. Robinson provided all four of the films with highly atmospheric scores, but it was Twins of Evilthat had been on many a collectors wants list to get some sort of release, its brooding opening building into a full blown riding theme that if tracked onto a western would fit like the proverbial glove, a style that composer Robinson turned to again on his Hawk the Slayer soundtrack a few years later. Vampire Lovershad been available before as a re-recording on an EMI long playing record alongside three other themes from Hammer horrors, but it appeared in the form of a suite which was arranged by Hammer’s musical director Phil Martell, what is included here is the film’s opening theme, a short but romantically tinged melody that is underlined wit a mood of virulence.\n\nLust for a Vampireis a very lush and opulent sounding theme, full of seductive layers which in my humble opinion was far too good for the film it enhanced. Countess Draculawas probably the most authentic sounding score that Robinson composed for a Hammer horror, he utilised cimbalom to great effect and further enhanced the film with lavish sounding strings that created an air of mystery.The film itself was not a great success at the box office, and that is probably why Robinsons score is at times overlooked.\n\nAnother theme that is most certainly deserved of a mention is The Mummy, which was released in 1959, its vibrant score was the work of German born concert pianist, turned composer Franz Reizenstein.\n\nThe collection is magnificent and will delight any fan of Hammer films and the gothic horrors that they produced. This excellent compilation takes us on a musical journey of terror and spans from the 1950’s through to the early 1970’s.\n\nOther titles that are also included are, The Brides of Dracula, Hands of the Ripper, Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb, Moon Zero Two,Quatermassand the Pit, Captain Kronos Vampire Hunter, and so much more. The music is conducted by Marcus Dod’s, John Hollingsworth, Phil Martell, and Franco Ferrara and all taken from the original sound recordings, there are no re-recordings here. And this was just the beginning.\n\nGDI went on to release numerous CDS and license some of the scores and compilations to other labels. I spoke with the label’s director Gary Wilson in 2005 about the recordings and what he had planned.\n\nQ; Why Hammer film music?\n\nWell why not, there is so much quality music from these films, and it’s never been released before, well at least the original stuff has never been issued, people have had to make do with re-recordings. OK they are faithful re-recordings but there is nothing that can beat the original sound of Hammer. Hammer movies have always been special to me they were a big part of my growing up, I remember seeing The Brides of Dracula, it scared the pants off me, but at the same time I found that I was very attracted to the movie, not just the story but the look of it, the rich colours the actors and also the music. I think I was about thirteen at the time so I should not have really been in the cinema watching it.\n\nQ: So how did you manage to persuade Hammer to release the music into his care, as many record companies had tried and failed?\n\nIt was a pure fluke, an accident or maybe fate if you like. I was at Hammer’s offices to discuss another project that I was toying with and was talking to Roy Skeggs whom I knew very well anyway. I noticed a big pile of boxes in one of the offices that were just dumped by the look of it and were not labelled. Being the curious person I am I asked Roy what they were, to which he replied, “Oh they are just some of the music tapes to a few of the Hammer movies”. I sort of held my breath for a moment because I could not believe my luck and was amazed that this stuff was just laying in old boxes in an office literally rotting away. A lot of the tapes were not labelled so it was a bit of a mammoth job sifting through them all matching music to videos etc. Obviously, I was familiar with things like Dracula and lots of other James Bernard material but when it came to other items it took quite a time to sort them all out. A few were in very poor condition, but things like Twins of Evil, Countess Dracula, Crescendo and Demons of the Mind were in very good condition considering the way the tapes had been stored – it was a difficult but also a rewarding task to find music that I had been told had been lost.\n\nGary told me that there were approximately eight boxes in all, so he certainly had his work cut out for him, he had to first identify music tracks, then index everything – but why had no-one noticed them before?\n\nI suppose the answer to that is nobody had bothered to be nosey enough (laughs). No seriously what had happened was Phil Martell who was Hammer’s musical director had died and his daughter had gone to clear his house and found all these tapes plus manuscripts and other musical items. So because she did not realise what they were, she decided to clear the house and try and sell the things but luckily Hammer found out about the sale and instructed their lawyers to re-possess what was rightfully theirs. Phil Martell had been approached on numerous occasions by various record companies to see if they could release the original scores, but Martell had always stopped any such contract being signed. He did however authorise and supervise the Silva Screen re-recordings, which were conducted by Neil Richardson, but even David Whitaker admitted that he was not keen on the way things were done on those sessions – so I was very lucky to get the tapes and for Hammer to grant permission for the music to be issued on CD.\n\nSo, did you pick up any of the actual manuscripts when he acquired the tapes?\n\nNo, it’s a shame but I am not sure if they survived the move from Martell’s house to Hammer, although I did manage to see a few things when we were discussing the tapes with Hammer. But the manuscripts are no real use to me as a music producer/record label because we have the tapes and that’s all we need.\n\nThe collectors, I don’t think would be interested in the manuscripts, our recordings are the originals – so when collectors put them on their CD player they are hearing the music as it was heard in the movies.\n\nSome of the tapes must have needed a lot of restoration work – and were there any at all that did not make it?\n\nA few were no good at all but most survived. I was disappointed that the original Dracula score by James Bernard was in a very sorry state, and we only managed to salvage a couple of tracks from it. The Curse of was also in very poor condition but we did some work on it and got it into a fair state. But considering the amount of time that they had been in storage, well dumped in boxes at Martell’s house, the majority were OK. I handed them over to a guy called Peter J. Reynolds who is a wizard at things like this, he is amazing, and he and his assistant Steve Cook worked their magic on them – these guys are the best as far as I am concerned.\n\nThe first GDI release was a compilation The Hammer Film Music Collection Volume One, and then the Comedy compilation followed, and soon after came a volume two of Hammer film music, Why did you not release a full soundtrack to start things off?\n\nI wanted to make fans and collectors aware that we had a lot of Hammer music to release, so I thought I would get their attention by releasing a few compilations, then sort of hit them with a full score.\n\nThe full score was The Mummy which has music by Franz Reizenstein – why did you choose this particular score?\n\nI just had so many memories of this movie. I think it is one of Hammer’s best from this period, it looks so good, rich in colour and there are some great performances in it. Peter Cushing is magnificent and Christopher Lee is very convincing in the role of the Mummy and the music is wonderful – again it is so rich and strong, it had to be this score.\n\nQ: Going back to the comedy compilation – this included music from all of Hammer’s On The Buses movies and also things like That’s Your Funeral, Man About the House etc, It also had in its running order music from non-Hammer movies such as George and Mildred and Rising Damp. Why did you go for this type of compilation instead of another horror collection at first?\n\nI thought it would be better to release the comedy collection because then the collectors would know that we were not just going to concentrate mainly on the Hammer horror stuff. After all, Hammer did make a lot of films away from the horror genre and this was our way of saying we had all types of music from Hammer and not just the horror material. I personally think that the Hammer made comedies were on a par with the Carry On movies, if not in some ways better, and the soundtracks were all very good, written by top composers and including loads of catchy little songs and musical cues.\n\nTalking of songs, on the first Hammer collection compact disc, you included the song from Moon Zero Two, why did you include this after all the movie did bomb out big time for the studio?\n\nI know, the film was a disaster for Hammer, but nowadays it’s something of a cult movie. The score by the trumpet player Don Ellis was a departure for Hammer, but the song is great – I know at times it’s irritating to listen to but maybe that’s the appeal of it. Hopefully we will be releasing the full score on CD in the future.\n\nSo to the future then, what’s up on the agenda for GDI in 2006?\n\nThe soundtrack market is not good at the moment, but there again the music market place in general is in a downward spiral, sales are very slow, no-one has any spare cash to waste on music, so a lot of things are being downloaded. Luckily soundtracks from Hammer movies are not widely available on the world wide web but because of slow sales and not wanting to put a lot of work into a project for it to lie on the shelves forever, or end up in the mark down bins, I have been very cautious and have been talking to a number of other record labels about the option of licensing things to them to release. LA LA LAND RECORDS in the States was one of them but that looks as if it won’t be going ahead. I have been talking to Ford Thaxton who is a great guy, and he has a few ideas that just might come to fruition – we will have to wait and see.\n\nSo you have a catalogue of around thirteen albums now, and also have licensed three compilations to another label in the UK – what came after The Mummy?\n\nIt was the Quatermass Collection. I wanted this one to come out because the first Quatermass movie was an important one for Hammer and a very important one for composer James Bernard. It was his first ever Hammer score – of course he went on to do so many films for them that are considered to be iconic. He is Hammer music as far as I am concerned – of course the album also included music by Tristram Carey for the movie Quatermass and the Pit. When you listen to James Bernard’s Quatermass it reminds me of Psycho but then when you think about it, it was written before that, so maybe Bernard Herrmann was influenced in some way by James Bernard – I would like to think so anyway”.\n\nAfter The Quatermass Collection, you issued The Vampire Lovers. Now this is a classic Hammer movie and Harry Robinson’s music at times really hits home as being virulent and foreboding. You said at the time that Lust for A Vampire was coming soon, but this has never been issued as a complete score, only in the form of a few tracks on the Vampire Collection. Is there any reason that the complete score has not been released?\n\nYes, the tapes were not as good as I thought, so maybe after some work Lust for A Vampire will get a release, I cannot say. Twins of Evil was however issued and out of all the CDs was I think probably one of our best sellers. I also wanted to do Countess Dracula another Harry Robinson score, but things have not been good in retail outlets for soundtracks, so I have held this off for a while, and again the tapes do require some work.\n\nI was stunned when James Bernard passed away but he was always very supportive of you wasn’t he?\n\nHe certainly was. He came to a couple of launch parties, along with Veronica Carlson and Ingrid Pitt but James was one in a million it was very sad when he died.\n\nWhat reaction have you had from the composers of the scores you have released?\n\nNot many have really said much. Carlo Martelli telephoned me to say that he thought the CDs were well done and as I have just said James Bernard was always complimentary. Carlo even offered me some tapes of his scores. He is a very underrated composer – he wasthe ghost writer on a number of scores for other composers during the 1960s and 1970s, receiving no credits at all.\n\nWhat about Captain Kronos by Laurie Johnson, a great score and a really ingenious take on the Vampire legend. Will we ever see this; it has been announced and then delayed so many times?\n\nYou will see this on CD, when I cannot say, but it will come out I promise.\n\nAnd it did on BSX records a few years later.\n\nAswell as GDI let’s not forget the work done by British label Silva Screen on re-recording music form Hammer films, previous to the appearance of GDI,the labels Music from the Hammer Films compilation was originally released onto LP record in 1989 with a lavish and ominous looking gatefold cover. The label also released the collection onto CD, with extensive notes and several stills from the movies included on the recording.\n\nThe compilation featured James Bernard, David Whitaker, and Christopher Gunning, with music from Dracula, Dracula Prince of Darkness, Taste the Blood of Dracula, Dracula has Risen from the Grave, Hands of the Ripper, and a gloriouslypowerful suite from Vampire Circus.The music was prepared by the composers and Hammer’s MD Phil Martell who supervised the recording with Neil Richardson conducting The Philharmonia Orchestra. At the time this was a groundbreaking releaseand included music that collectors and Hammer fans had been requesting for many years. After the success of this release Silva focused upon other Horror film music producing the excellent Horror compilation, and then an album showcasing the music of James Bernard entitled The Devil Rides Out the Adventure film music of James Bernard, all were re-recordings, but these were faithful renditions, and snapped up by collectors. I was fortunate to be able to attend the sessions for both of these releases at Whitfield Street studios in London.\n\nThe Sessions Part One.\n\nThe Horror Album.\n\nIn November 1995, I travelled to London’s Whitfield Street recording studios to sit in on the recording sessions for two albums that were being recorded by the British soundtrack label Silva Screen. These were The Horror collection and The Devil Rides Out music for Hammer films composed by James Bernard. The label had found success previously when they re-recorded music from other Hammer horrors in their landmark album Music from The Hammer Films and were hoping to repeat this success with these two re-recordings of classic horror music. On this occasion the first sessions were to focus more upon non-James Bernard scores and to my delight Witchfinder General was on the schedule, Philip Lane had reconstructed the music from the score by composer Paul Ferris and had arranged the principal themes into a wonderful suite, which included the haunting love theme and opening theme from the movie.\n\nThe recording engineer for the sessions was Mike Ross Trevor who was a familiar face to many collectors of movie scores.\n\nThe orchestra was The Westminster Philharmonic, which numbered nearly one hundred musicians, under the very able guidance of conductor Kenneth Alwyn. I arrived late thanks to British rail and was met with a crowd of young girls and boys making a bit of a din and holding cameras in hand. Sadly theses were not for James Bernard, Carlo Martelli or Buxton Orr, but for Madonna who was recording an album in the studio next door. I got through the crowd and into the studio, the session had already started, and the orchestra were in full flight giving a thunderous performance of Buxton Orr’s Corridors of Blood, I have to admit I did not recognise this at first but soon was reminded of what it was by David Wishart. I also did not recognise David Stoner, which was a little remiss of me! I had spoken to David Many times but only met him the once before, I soon however recognised the voice when he told me “It’s going really well”. Also in attendance at that time were composers Carlo Martelli, Buxton Orr plus Dimitri Kennaway (Benjamin Frankel’s stepson) and his Mother Frankel’s widow.\n\nThe music recorded that first day was mainly that penned by Buxton Orr and also sections of The Curse of the Werewolf by Frankel, this I found to be a thrilling experience as Frankel’s music in particular just oozed energy and contained a melodic pastorale theme. Carlo Martelli’s music for The Curse of the Mummy’s Tomb, should also have been recorded in that session but due to a few problems with The Curse of the Werewolf, which is a very difficult score to perform Martelli’s music was postponed until the next session which was on the following day.\n\nDay two I was looking forward to because Witchfinder General would be recorded, the session was running late because of the previous day getting behind with Frankel’s score for Hammer’s lupine classic, and still proved quite a challenge for the orchestra, it was after all a more or less fully atonal work, and the Westminster philharmonic had to have a few attempts at it before they got it sounding the way it should. After approx; nine takes and the marvellous conducting skills of Kenneth Alwyn everything fell into place and it sounded marvellous.\n\nCarlo Martelli was present once again and I took a few minutes to speak with him, the composer was somewhat worried about how the orchestra would cope with his music for Curse of the Mummy’s Tomb as it too was involved and difficult. However, the orchestra took things in their stride and turned out a polished performance which the composer seemed pleased with.\n\nNext up was the classic British horror The Night of The Demon, this surely is one of the most iconic pieces of music from a horror movie, composed by Clifton Parker, for this recording the orchestra performed the overture, and filled the studio with the sound of horror and foreboding and evoked memories of the demon in question seeking out its victims and ending their existence, swiftly and mercilessly.\n\nWitchfinder General came next, and after a short break the orchestra came back into the studio to prepare for this, the music was by Paul Ferris, who had sadly passed away just one month before this recording.\n\nThe orchestra acquitted themselves marvellously, and special mention must be made of the string section and the beautiful delicate guitar solos of Harvey Hope. The re-construction by Philip Lane included an arrangement of the principal themes, which were condensed into a six-minute suite, Lane combining the prelude and also the love theme which was arranged by Ferris in the movie to accompany Ian Ogilvy’s character as he rode home to his fiancée. During this part of the recording, I was invited to sit in the middle of the orchestra which is an experience that I will never forget.\n\nAlso, during this session, the music of Humphrey Searle was on the agenda, and included his brilliant music for Robert Wise’s chiller The Haunting and the Hammer movie The Abominable Snowman, both re-recordings went well with The Haunting still making me feel slightly edgy and uneasy.\n\nComposer James Bernard arrived, The Devil Rides Out was to be recorded, but time was running out and the recording was a little rushed, but they decided to just go for it and try and get it in one take, so after a very quick run through Kenneth Alwyn raised his baton and the orchestra launched into the virulent sounding composition The Power of Evil, This concluded the session, but we would return in two weeks for more dark delights.\n\nThe Sessions Part Two.\n\nThe Devil Rides Out.\n\nThis was for the James Bernard compilation, that would include, The Devil Rides out, The Kiss of the Vampire, She, and music from both Quatermass movies as scored by the composer. Kiss of the Vampire, I think was the main attraction for me at least. The wonderful piano music from the score had been arranged by the composer for this re-recording into The Vampire Rhapsody. I spoke to the composer who told me that the solo piano part had originally been performed by fellow composer Douglas Gamley, but for this session it would be played by Paul Bateman, who produced a flawless performance par excellence. The stunning performance remains with me and a highlight of this recording, and without sounding clichéd or corny I was literally mesmerized by Bateman’s performance. Which was eloquent and elegant.\n\nMusic from She which he had arranged into a suite, was also recorded, with Bernard confessing this was one of the hardest scores he had composed and had more problems with it than all of his other works for Hammer, but it also turned out to be his own personal favourite. The suite included Ayesha Theme, The Desert Ride, Bedouin Attack, and In the Kingdom of She, they also recorded the music used for the end sequence where Ayesha enters the flames and perishes.\n\nThe Quatermass Suite, David Wishart said was “Real Horror stuff” and after hearing it I totally agreed. The suite again arranged by Phillip Lane was terrific, it is tense and dramatic music that is performed on strings and percussion only, this rivals the work of Herrmann in my opinion and is more complex and certainly more harrowing in its overall sound than Psycho or Vertigo. The sessions had gone well, and we had time to record additional tracks which were destined for The Horror album. Gerard Schurmann’s Konga, and The Horrors of the Black Museum, and Buxton Orr’s The Fiend Without A Face among these. As the sessions ended, I was confident that both these compilations would do well for Silva Screen and also that the label had once again restored and preserved some wonderful music from film, which might have been lost forever.\n\nGDI records first full score release was The Mummy, which had a brilliantly atmospheric soundtrack by Franz Reizenstein. The composer was born in Nuremberg on June 7th, 1911, his father was a doctor and also an excellent amateur pianist, his elder sister was an artist, and his elder brother played the violin. Reizenstein’s Mother was also very musical and was astonished when her two-year-old son could sing back any of the songs that she had just sung to him in perfect pitch and time. At the age of just four Franz began to teach himself to play the piano, and it was also at this time that he begun to compose short pieces of music. When Franz was a teenager the sudden death of his father inspired him to compose a piece in his memory. At 17, Reizenstein decided to study composition under Paul Hindemith in Berlin. Despite opposition from his uncle he eventually went to Berlin in 1930. As the thirties progressed the Jewish Reizenstein relocated to the Royal College of Music in London, where he continued to study composition under Vaughn Williams and also continued his piano studies under Solomon. Reizenstein never returned to Germany, instead he adopted British nationality and remained in London until his untimely death at the age of 57. He left a wife, Margaret, and a son John.\n\nAlthough Reizenstein was thought of as a serious musician and composer, by this I mean he composed mostly for concert hall performance. He did make several forays into the world of film music, most notably the The Mummy, which was the composer’s film music debut. His score is sweeping and dramatic but remains romantically laced and highly melodicand lavish. The central theme that he wrote for the movie doubles as a love theme of sorts and depicts the Mummy’s (Kharis) centuries old obsession for Princess Ananka. Reizenstein reprised the principal theme throughout his score and it was performed in a number of variations and arrangements which utilised an assortment of instrumentation. Although the central theme is essentially the heart of Reizenstein’s score, the composer also created secondary and other minor themes for the soundtrack which are just as important and integral to the movie and the story that is unfolding upon the screen. The images of the Mummy frantically smashing its way into John Banning’s (Peter Cushing) library and study is underlined and accompanied by rasping brass, which blares out over driving and urgent sounding strings that are themselves supported and punctuated by a chaotic sounding Xylophone.\n\nThis exciting composition stops abruptly as Banning’s wife Isobel enters the room, Kharis sees her and believes her to be he lost love Ananka at which point he ceases his attack on Banning and beats a retreat out of the house and into the night. The sense of excitement and atmosphere of Kharis’s ferocious attack on Banning is assisted greatly by Reizenstein’s highly volatile and vibrant musical score. The movies climatic scene is another example of how much the score aided the impact of the images and just how images and music can and should work in film as one. Kharis returns to Banning’s house, this time the evil Mummy is intent on killing him, things however do not go to plan and Kharis abducts Isobel, pursued by the Police, villagers and Banning, Kharis is chased into a swamp. Booming percussion racing timpani and short brass stabs underline the scene. When Kharis is shot down Reizenstein’s urgent timpani begins to slow as if to be the heartbeat of the Mummy, and as the creature disappears below the swamp Reizenstein’s musical accompaniment fades and eventually stops. Reizenstein was at the top of his musical game when Hammer asked him to write the score for The Mummy, his music being quite unique with the composer placing his stylish and original musical fingerprint upon the production, the idiom of his music being unmistakably 20th Century but not avant-garde.\n\nMany composers in the first half of the century became beguiled with the twelve tones series system, but Reizenstein found that the strict system cramped his natural style and he never cared for the tight intellectual music it produced. Reizenstein’s music flows naturally from melodic ideas and harmonies with which the listener can easily identify. He composed concertos for piano, violin and cello with orchestras, and two large-scale choral works, Voices of the Night, and Genesis. The latter was commissioned for the Three Choirs Festival of 1958, which was held at Hereford Cathedral. The success of Voices of the Night led the BBC to commission him to write the first opera for radio, entitled Anna Krasus. It was the British entry for the prestigious Italia Prize. Reizenstein also composed music for several documentaries and provided incidental music for a number of BBC productions. Shortly after completing his score for The Mummy, he wrote the music for Sydney Hayers movie shocker Circus of Horrors which was also released in 1959. As a composer Reizenstein was versatile and this became even more evident when Gerard Hoffnung asked him to write two works for the Hoffnung Concerts.\n\nAt first Reizenstein was reluctant and refused, he argued that he was a serious composer who would be reluctant to let his hair down at the Royal Festival Hall, Hoffnung persevered, however and Reizenstein contributed the witty Concerto Popolare or (the piano concerto to end all piano concertos) and the hilarious Lets Fake an Opera.\n\nA composer that by his own admission was the odd man out at Hammer was Harry Robinson, he had originally been a pop or rock and roll musical director, whereas the majority of the other Hammer composers were classically trained. Robinson was a regular composer at Hammer and worked on some of the studios most popular horrors. Films such as The Vampire Lovers, Lust for A Vampire, and Twins of Evil, became firm favourites with Hammer devotees and soundtrack collectors. (but at the time of this interview had not been released). I met Harry some years ago, and eventually got around to interviewing him during the summer of 1994. He was a gentle and courteous Scotsman, who was always prepared to answer questions and give you as much information as possible. The interview I did with Harry was on a Saturday afternoon which was a hot and very dusty day in London. We sat by his pool at his home, and I remember him telling me he had managed to get out of going to a wedding reception by telling his wife he was being interviewed by a very important journalist. Which is something I did giggle about for some time.\n\nHarry was born in Elgin in Scotland on November 19th 1932; his real name was Henry MacLeod Robertson. Harry’s career was a varied one. He not only composed music for motion pictures, but acted as musical director on West End shows such as Lionel Bart’s Fings ai’nt Wot they Used to Be, and Maggie May, and took care of the musical duties on show such as Oh Boy and Six Five Special, Harry worked with some of the best-known artistes from the 1960s including The Beatles, Liza Minelli, Tommy Steele, and Judy Garland,\n\nQ: I began by asking the composer how he became interested in writing music.\n\nHarry Robinson: It was a film that got me interested in music, I went to see Dangerous Moonlight as a kid. The film I don’t think I can remember but I did take notice of the music which was The Warsaw Concerto, by Richard Addinsell. The melody kept going around in my head; even after a few days I still kept hearing it. It virtually haunted me and I felt that I had to do something about it. I became determined that I would have piano lessons and learn how to play this music, but I set myself a time limit of just 12 months. I don’t think I realised just how difficult that would be, but I was young and I suppose a little bit naive. I pestered the life out of my mother and finally she gave in and agreed to let me have piano lessons; I think because I was so enthusiastic I learnt very quickly and soon managed to play the Richard Addinsell piece. I even performed it in front of an audience and won a competition for my rendition of the music. I would have been contented with that but as time went on, I began to discover other types of music and wanted to learn more. I pestered my mother again, who found a music teacher who was English, but was living close to my hometown of Elgin in the Highlands of Scotland. He was recovering from the illness tuberculosis and had been told that the air in Scotland would help his path back to fitness. He was a composer but had begun to teach to pay his way. I had instruction in composition, harmony, and counterpoint from him. After finishing my lessons with him I became bored with music; probably one of the many phases that I went through, and I decided that I would become an archaeologist. I went to university to study the subject, but I then contracted TB myself and had to cease my studies; after all I could not go into damp places etc. with a weak chest, so my days in archaeology were cut short. I went back to music and I ended up teaching but this I found so tedious. I don’t think that I am one of these people that can relay to others my love of music via lessons, so I decided to head south and ended up in London.\n\nWhen Harry first arrived in London, it was a bit of a struggle as he was not known and needed to try and establish himself.\n\nI must tell you and also any aspiring young musician out there that might read this in years to come, that the streets of London are not paved with gold, far from it London can be one of the loneliest cities in the world. After a while I eventually began to pick up jobs here and there and started to work as an arranger in a recording studio in Denmark Street. After a chance meeting in a coffee bar, I ended up doing some work for DECCA and arranged and conducted the music on a record called The Tommy Rock Story, which was basically a send up of Tommy Steele, but it must have caught his attention because I ended up being his musical director for a while. It was whilst working at DECCA that I had to change my name. This was because the cheque that they paid me with was made out to Harry Robinson and not Robertson. It would have been a nightmare to try and change it and the bank would have been difficult, so out of laziness I suppose I opened an account in the name of Robinson. And that’s how Harry Robinson came about, plus I was living almost from day to day then and I needed the cash to eat.\n\nWas this around the time that you became interested in writing for films?\n\nNo, not really, I had not actually thought about doing that at this time; this was in the late 1950’s remember, so I did not start writing music for films till around the mid 1960’s. It was at this time that I had a number one record. I formed a group, well sort of formed a group, it was session musicians really, we called ourselves Lord Rockinhams XI. The record was one of these novelty tunes called Hoots Mon, that was quite fun. But I never started writing for films until I became involved with the Children’s Film Foundation, this was firstly as a writer and then I started to direct the films. OK they were not blockbusters or Hollywood material, but these movies gave young talented actors their first break into the world of film.\n\nWhen did you first become involved with Hammer films?\n\nThis was in 1968, but not for a film, I was asked to write the theme tune for a television series called Journey into the Unknown. Hammer were the line producers for this; it was a 20th Century fox production overall. Phil Martell, who was Hammer’s musical director at that time was going to be conducting the music. I had heard that he could be somewhat difficult, or at least I had heard he liked to get his own way, so as you can imagine I was a little apprehensive about even walking into the studio. But after our initial frosty meeting, we went for some liquid lunch and things settled down. I ended up writing the theme for the series and scored four of the episodes. It was about a year later when I had a call from Martell, asking me if I would be interested in doing a film for him. Of course, I said yes, and the movie turned out to be The Vampire Lovers. I must admit I was worried when I first started work on the movie, after all Hammer had a reputation for using classically trained composers, such as James Bernard, Benjamin Frankel, Malcolm Williamson, and their like. I was basically a pop music arranger, so it was all very new to me, I felt like the odd man out. I had however had some indication of what it was like scoring films because of my connections with the Children’s Film Foundation and I had in that same year scored another horror picture for American International Pictures entitled The Oblong Box, which was produced by James Nicholson. I think this is why I got The Vampire Lovers, because A.I.P. were co-producing the picture with Hammer. So maybe someone at A.I.P. had asked Hammer if I could do it. This helped me also as I had a fair idea of what A.I.P. expected from composers and was not going in completely blind – anyway Phil was there to guide me. Both Hammer and A.I.P. were tuned into what they wanted musically and were very supportive of composers. I did think that maybe there would have been some sort of conflict between the two, but they left me to my own devices I composed the score in a style that I thought suited the film and apart from a few timing tweaks by Phil Martell, the music you hear on the soundtrack is what I wanted to do. I had always been a big fan of American International’s Edgar Allan Poe stories, and of course Hammer’s gothic horrors had always impressed me, so it was a privilege and something of a dream come true to be working for both the companies at the same time.\n\nYou worked on a spoof horror during the 1970s called House in Nightmare Park, I asked him about this assignment.\n\nHouse in Nightmare Park – that still sends a shiver up my spine (laughs). It was a comedy horror with Frankie Howard and Ray Milland if I remember correctly, strange little film, the producers asked for a meeting because they wanted to hear what music I had written but the budget was quite small and they would not let me have any musicians until they were satisfied with the music so I had to play the entire score to them on piano. Now I am not the best piano player in the world, and I was a little nervous, so I kept stumbling over the keys and making mistakes; I think they thought this was all part of the score, anyway they liked it, and approved the use of musicians.\n\nYour next Hammer assignment was Lust for A Vampire.\n\nYou know, I did not like that movie, I thought it was a very weak picture. There was no real story, just a load of tits and bums wobbling around; some of the acting was less than professional – it relied on the uncovering of flesh rather than the unfolding of a storyline. 1971 was a very busy year for me with Hammer. I scored three pictures for them; one being Lust for A Vampire, the others were Twins of Evil, and then Countess Dracula. It felt like I was constantly in the studio. It’s funny, all the vampire movies I scored for Hammer have in recent years attained something of a cult status, probably for all the wrong reasons, but they are popular.\n\nCountess Dracula, was not really a vampire movie, was it?\n\nNot as such, apart from the title. It was based on some factual material, and I think the movie worked well but it was not that popular at the box office. I think audiences felt cheated that it was not a vampire movie in the time-honoured Hammer tradition.\n\nTwins of Evil is a bit of a swashbuckler; loads of action plenty of bare flesh and your score which sounds like a western soundtrack. What made you decide to score the picture like this?\n\nYou know, I had always wanted to score a western and had never been asked, so when I saw the first rushes of Twins of Evil I thought, well there’s horses in it and people dashing around the countryside so why not. I will do a western theme of sorts to match this. Surprisingly it worked and everyone loved it.\n\nI spoke to Harry about a recent Silva Screen release Music from the Hammer Films. This was a re-recording of some of the Hammer horror music, but Harry was not represented at all on this recording. Had he been approached by Silva at all?\n\nNo, I only heard about this after it happened. I remember that some of my Vampire Lovers music made it onto an EMI LP some years ago. It was a studio-two record with a Dracula story on the A side and I think four suites of music on the B side. They were arranged and conducted by Phil Martell; I had nothing to do with them. I would like to see the original Hammer music released; and now with the popularity of the compact disc there are so many possibilities. Technology has moved on so much it might even be possible to release some of Hammer’s real vintage scores (remember this interview took place before GDI records came on to the scene JM). I have often thought that I could arrange some of the music I wrote for the vampire movies, Twins, Lovers and Lust into a suite and have it recorded or maybe performed at a concert. We could call it music to watch Tits and Bums by, or something like that (laughs). But seriously, I would like to do something so that my music will be heard away from the movies.\n\nHave you heard the Silva Screen re-recording?\n\nYes, as I said it was a bit of a surprise, but I did get the CD. I thought it was OK; faithful on the James Bernard music but I thought Vampire Circus was a little lethargic and drawn out to be honest, which is surprising because Phil Martell was present at the recordings, so I am told. I thought Phil would have said something – maybe he has mellowed in his old age.\n\nWhat would you say was your favourite score for a Hammer film?\n\nHarry Robinson: It’s always difficult when you get asked a question like this. I always feel if I say “Oh, loved that score” I might sound a bit full of myself; do you know what I mean? Well, you will probably be surprised at my answer, I think I prefer Demons of the Mind to any of the others. I also thought the film was very good. It was a horror I suppose but a film that made you think a little. It was to be called Blood will have Blood, but the censors decided that you could not have blood in the title twice – why I am not sure? The film called for a score that obviously matched its storyline, but I also got a chance to be melodic on this picture which was a nice change from all the atonal and loud non-musical stuff. I used traditional instrumentation and enhanced this with a Moog synthesiser. I also liked my score for Countess Dracula, a lot. I tried to infuse some sort of credibility into the sound of the score – I used cimbalom and romantic sounding strings for the main title, which seemed to work well.\n\nYou worked on Doctor Jekyll and Sister Hyde, what happened on this assignment?\n\nI am so glad that you asked me that (laughs). Yes, well, let’s just say that I had artistic differences with the director and the producers. I did not like the movie – I thought it was a rather shoddy production, so I asked Phil Martell to get me off of it. I have one saying in life and that is IF YOU ARE NOT HAVING FUN THEN GET THE HELL OUT and I was certainly having no fun on that film. Phil was great about it and suggested another composer for the picture; David Whitaker I think.\n\nQ: That’s right. It was his first Hammer film I think; so, I suppose he has you to thank for becoming involved with Hammer.\n\nHarry Robinson: Don’t know whether he would say thank you for that or not.\n\nQ: Have you got any particularly fond memories of a movie at all?\n\nHarry Robinson: Well, there was the time when I nearly caused a strike at Hammer. I was on the set of Twins of Evil, where I had to play piano off set for a scene and during a break in the filming, I was talking to one of the movie producers. I picked up a chair and sat in it discussing some things with him and when filming resumed, I forgot to put the chair back where I had got it from. You would not believe how much trouble this caused. The crew were up in arms, the set director went mad – in fact the whole thing came to a standstill. I said sorry very quietly and departed.\n\nSo, did that put you off going on location at all? I ask this because some time ago there was a programme on TV called Cinema and they ran a feature on Hawk the Slayer, which you produced I think – it showed footage of you in a very wet forest.\n\nMy God. You have got a good memory John, that was an age ago, that’s right I did co-produce Hawk and of course wrote the score. It was unfortunately not a great success. It was at the same time as things like Krull and Dragonslayer were around – both of those flopped as well. Hawk did reasonably well at the cinema because it was a quite low budget film, so we did not have a lot riding on it. I wrote some of the score whilst on location. I would see how the scenes were coming out and then do a bit of writing or just jot down some ideas as and when I got them. It was an interesting experience because I had most of the score ready before the cameras had stopped rolling.\n\nSomething like Morricone does with Leone you mean?\n\nWell, I would not say I am in the same league as Morricone but yes, I suppose so. We did try and emulate Kurosawa on Hawk the Slayer with camera angles and the style of direction etc. but I think we sort of leaned more towards Leone in that respect – Hawk being a fantasy western if you like. That’s why the score has little trills and motifs on it when we see the hero or the villain of the piece; it was my homage to Morricone and the spaghetti western score.\n\nThere was a rumour that Hawk the Slayer would have a sequel – was this true?\n\nYes. I did want to do a sequel, but the film studios were very cautious after the bad ratings of the first picture. After all, if a big movie like Krull had bombed what chance did we stand with a film with a fraction of the budget. I did not give up though, I tried to get television companies interested in doing a series based on Hawk; we even went to New Zealand to do some location scouting but it never came to fruition.\n\nHave you ever turned down an assignment or had a score rejected?\n\nHarry Robinson: I have been very fortunate not to have anything thrown out. I of course refused to work on Doctor Jekyll and sister Hyde but other than that, everything has gone according to plan.\n\nYou worked with Freddie Francis on The Legend of the Werewolf – what was he like to work with?\n\nFreddie was great, quite a character in fact He knew very little about music, so just let me go my own way on the picture. I can tell you something about directors; not many of them know anything about music but very few of them will admit this, so when you come across someone like Freddie it’s a breath of fresh air.\n\nDid you ever meet up with any of the other composers that worked on Hammer pictures?\n\nHarry Robinson: Can’t say I did. There was the occasional Christmas party but, as I said, I felt like the odd man out in the company of many of them; after all they were real composers, and I was a pop arranger that just happened to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nHow long did you normally get to score a movie; maybe you could use Vampire Lovers as an example?\n\nI think I got about four weeks to score that movie; obviously it does vary from assignment to assignment. Countess Dracula, I had six weeks to complete the score and Twins of Evil was about the same. It also depends on the editing on the film; you know, you write a cue, and it sounds good and fits perfectly, and then the editor rings up and says I have had to cut out fifty seconds from that scene and all the timings go out of the window and you must start again. It’s a nightmare sometimes.\n\nAt what stage of a project do you like to become involved?\n\nAs early as I can get involved really. I do like to see a script, if possible, but the next best thing is to go and see what is happening on set and get a feel for the movie or TV programme. Invariably though, the composer is the last thing that the director will even think of, so we have to come in when the film is in it’s rough cut stage; spot the movie with the director or producer and then go away and have the score ready by the day before we got the job (laughs); well it’s not that bad but nearly.\n\nAs a writer and also a producer have you ever hired other composers to score your projects?\n\nNo, but obviously I have worked on certain projects and other composers have scored them, as a producer/composer. I am very conscious of both the production side of things and the music. I think that is why I have scored most of my own productions. I don’t think I would leave the composer alone and probably would end up doing it myself or changing things around.\n\nWhat is Virtual Murder?\n\nThat’s a TV series which I co-produced and also wrote the theme for. It was shown on the BBC and we are talking about another series of six episodes. It’s a bit like Dr Who meets The Avengers.\n\nWhat size orchestra did you use to score the Hammer movies?\n\nSadly, by the time I got to Hammer the music budgets had been reduced so we had to be a little bit clever. I think we utilised around sixty musicians/players, but this was not all at once; many sessions would just have fifteen to twenty players, so we are not talking about a huge symphony orchestra. I would try and make the music sound fat, or bigger than it was by using strings and brass – I hate what I call spidery sounding music. So, I adapted things to suit each individual film or scene. It was quite easy to make a score sound grand even if we were only using a maximum of thirty musicians. On Lust for A Vampire, I think I started out with fifty players and then reduced them down as we progressed in the scoring schedule. Horror movies in particular need a powerful and atmospheric score; it’s often the music in a horror movie that scares the pants off the audience rather than the gruesome scene on screen.\n\nHow do you work your musical ideas out – do you write them straight to manuscript, use a piano or maybe a synth?\n\nRecently, because of my arthritis, I have taken to using a computer. It works rather like a word processor but with music. That way I can store what I have done – but I did use piano at one time. Also, I was a very quick writer, so as you can imagine because of my illness, it is very frustrating when I can’t get the notes down as quickly as I want to. That is why I have not been doing anything musical I am just not able to write quick enough.\n\nSo, what is next for Harry Robinson?\n\nGood question – I am still writing scripts and stories; this is easy with the word processor, but I think my days of writing film scores are over. This illness is horrible; I have good days, bad days, and just bloody awful days. Today has been a good day, and I have enjoyed our chat.\n\nSo have I. Thank you very much for your time.\n\nHarry Robinson/Robertson passed away on January 17th 1996 in Wandsworth, London.\n\nA composer who certainly belonged to the world of “Serious Music” was Elisabeth Lutyens, who worked on a few Hammer films, and wrote a groundbreaking soundtrack for the Freddie Francis directed, Amicus films horror The Skull (1965). Born Agnes Elisabeth Lutyens on July 9th 1906, in Bloomsbury London. She began her musical studies in Paris and then continued these at the Royal College of Music.\n\nShe was to become the first Female composer to write music for films in Gt Britain. During the early 1930s she made various attempts to break into the world of film scoring, but it was finally via the efforts of Muir Mathieson that she actually became involved in film music, it was because of this well know British movie music icon that Lutyens was given her first scoring assignment in 1944, this was not a full motion picture score however, but was for a Royal Air force newsreel film for which she provided a march entitled Bustle for WAAF,s which was likened in style to the quirky theme and scores that Malcolm Arnold composed for the St. Trinians films was received well.\n\nIt was at around the same period that Lutyens also composed music for Crown Film Unit productions in which the composer decided to give the documentaries she worked on music that has more of an epic sound abandoning at this time her normal twelve-tone style approach to composition. After this she became in demand and worked on a further four documentaries and with these completed, she was commissioned to work on several short films. Her approach to scoring films was somewhat different from other composers working in film during this time, Lutyens preferring to wait until the movie was completed or in its rough-cut stage before even viewing it and then deciding what music should be provided, her outlook and opinion of music in film was that it should not be overpowering or overbearing but should underline and maybe punctuate discreetly. Whilst other composers at this time such as Sir Arthur Bliss, saw music as a more integral component and an equal part of the film making process with composers being involved at times long before the cameras had started to roll and the scores running continuously in the background. In 1960, Lutyens began to work more regularly on feature length movies, her first foray into this area being Don’t Bother to Knock, it was at this time that Phil Martell began to work with Lutyens and he would conduct the majority of her work for the cinema, whether it be for Hammer or Amicus and was of the opinion that She had a natural flair and aptitude to create music for film.\n\nIt was Martell, who eventually guided her in the art of film scoring and at times was the voice of restraint when Lutyens occasionally employed a more experimental style. But it was her twelve-tone system that attracted Hammer films and othe Horror producing companies to the composer, as her sound and style proved to be more than effective, with the collaboration between Hammer and the composer being very productive, and it is probably true to say that it was Lutyens music for horror films that brought her recognition and monetary security more than any other genre. Dr. Terrors House of Horrors, The Earth Dies Screaming, The Skull, and The Terrornauts. all benefited from Lutyens original and distinctive sound. Her Hammer scores included Never Take Sweets from a Stranger (1960), and Paranoiac (1963).\n\nLutyens did not regard her film scores as highly as her concert works, but she still relished being referred to as the “Horror Queen”, which went well with the green nail polish she habitually wore. She, passed away on April 14th 1983. Very little of her film music has been released, which is a great pity, as she was a composer way ahead of her time. There is an interesting suite of music from The Skull on a compilation entitled, Love from A Stranger -Four British Film Scores, which is available now also on digital platforms. I say a suite but in fact it is seven cues from the score, which have been arranged into longer pieces, in many ways the music mirrors the style employed by James Bernard on films such as The Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula, but there are to be fair more hints of melodies, although the majority of Lutyens music is atonal and action led. Which was considered the norm for music in horror movies at this time. It is probably the most interesting section on the compilation;\n\nThis is a movie that was based upon the book The Skull of the Marquis De Sade which was penned by Psycho author Robert Bloch. The movie was a moderate success at the box office, but since its original release has become a much-revered addition the British made Horror Genre. Lutyens score was a considerable asset to the movie and the composer really came into her own when scoring an almost twenty-minute dialogue free sequence which occurred in the latter part of the movie. The orchestration of the score is particularly interesting as the composer included inventive use of percussion, brass, organ, cimbalom and two bass clarinets but omitted the use of violins.\n\nThe music on this NMC records compilation comprises of an almost eighteen-minute suite. Which includes seven sections from the score. I would not say that this is a typical horror score although it does contain its fair share of foreboding and fearsome sounds. It is a formidable and intelligently constructed work that can easily be put into the category of being classic British film music. The music is performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Jac Van Steen.\n\nElisabeth Lutyens was the first Female composer to work on a Horror score in England, but she was not the only Female composer to write for Hammer Films. Doreen Carwithen wrote the suitably robust and swashbuckling soundtrack to the studios production The Men of Sherwood Forest in 1954 which was conducted and supervised by John Hollingsworth. It was in my own opinion a case of the music being far better than the film it was intended to support. Carwithen was born in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire on 15th November 1922. As a child she began to take music lessons from her mother who was a music teacher the young Doreen starting both piano and violin with her aged just four. Her Sister Barbara was also highly musical, and the two siblings had perfect pitch. At age sixteen Doreen began composing by setting Wordsworth’s I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (Daffodils) to music and wrote a piece for voice and piano. In 1941 she began her training at the Royal Academy of Music and performed cello in a string quartet and would at times play with orchestras. She was a member of the harmony class that was overseen by British composer William Alwyn, who after seeing her enthusiasm and potential also taught her composition. Her overture One Damn Thing After Another, received its premier performance at Covent Garden under the baton of Adrian Boult in 1947. The same year she was selected by the Royal Academy to train as composer of film music on a scheme that was sponsored by J Arthur Rank.\n\nIn 1961 she became William Alwyn’s second wife, and decided to change her name to Mary Alwyn, as she disliked the name Doreen, and took her middle name Mary as her Christian name. She later worked as a Sub Professor of Composition at the RAM. She was devoted to her husband and acted as his secretary. After he died in 1985, she decided to establish the William Alwyn Archive and William Alwyn Foundation to promote his music and initiate related research projects. She then also returned to her own music. In 1999 a stroke left her paralysed on one side. She died in Forncett St Peter, near Norwich, on 5 January 2003. During her time as a film music composer, she wrote over thirty scores, her first scoring assignment being for segments of the documentary short, This Modern Age (1946).\n\nOther assignments soon followed and she was particularly busy during the late 1940,s through into the mid-1950,s when she also acted as assistant to Muir Mathieson and at times often acted as an arranger or orchestrator on film scores by other composers, and was used many times to assist composers who were running out of time on certain assignments, most of these she received no credit for. She also composed the music for Elizabeth is Queen in 1953 which was the official film of the coronation her other documentaries included Teeth of the Wind (1953), The Stranger Left No Card (1952) and On the Twelfth Day (1956) where her music took the place of dialogue. Her film music is showcased on an entertaining compilation that is released on Dutton Epoch records.\n\nThe compilation which was released in 2011 includes music from a handful of films and projects that Carwithen scored during the late 1940,s and into the early to mid-1950,s. The compact disc opens with an overture from the 1954 Exclusive films or Hammer production The Men of Sherwood Forest as you can probably work out from the title the film is about Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws who in this particular adventure battle to put Richard the Lionheart back on the English throne. The film which was released a while before Hammer decided to resurrect Dracula and friends was directed by Val Guest and is not a movie that would win any awards or indeed be nominated for any, but the rousing and robust musical score which Carwithen penned is certainly an asset to the production. The music is not as glamorous or shall we say as anthem like or lavish as Erich Wolfgang Korngold’s famous foray into writing for the famous long bow archer in tights, but nonetheless it’s a work that is certainly more than just interesting, it has to it a depth and substance that oozes character and also possess subtle but affecting melodies that are fleeting but attractive.\n\nThe central themes from the score were taken by Philip Lane and arranged into an overture which can also act as a concert piece, the majority of the more melodious parts of the score came from the opening trumpet flourishes which Lane took as his starting point, it was a well-known fact that Carwithen always wrote the main title or opening themes for her film scores last, firstly concentrating on the main fabric of the score or individual themes for certain characters and then fashioning her main credits theme from all aspects of the score. The Men of Sherwood Forest, is regarded as Carwithen’s finest score and an important milestone in her career which outshone the movie for which it was composed, in fact the composer thought that the film was, and I quote, “Ghastly”.\n\nThe performances on this compilation are by the BBC Concert orchestra under the direction of Gavin Sutherland, who has been particularly active in resurrecting British film music and also a champion of light music, the quality of the performances within the compilation are second to none also the sound achieved is authentic and it is as if we are hearing the scores from the films rather than a re-recording. The compilation also includes music from The Boys in Brown (1948). Directed by Montgomery Tully the film included an impressive cast list Richard Attenborough, Barbara Murray, Dirk Bogarde, Jack Warner and Jimmy Hanley, the films storyline focuses on a group of young offenders who are in a Borstal and the governor played by Warner attempts to reform them and turn their lives around. The opening movement, Main Titles and Opening Scene, includes a fanfare of sorts that is performed by trombones, this introduces a taught and dramatic sounding theme that is performed by the string section with violins taking centre stage and being supported by rich but dark cellos that are themselves aided by basses and underlined and punctuated by timpani. The mood of the cue changes quite dramatically as brass and percussion take the piece to a more urgent level, the composer adding low woodwinds and quite sinister and apprehensive strings to create an uneasy mood.\n\nThis section more than any of the others included on the compilation for me has a familiar sound to it and reminded me so much of the work of British composer William Alwyn, which I suppose is not surprising as it was Alwyn who schooled Carwithen in composition. Carwithen was given guidance by two giants of film music the aforementioned Alwyn and also Muir Mathieson and it was whilst working as Mathieson’s assistant that Carwithen began to write for film, very often un-credited and stepping in for other composers who for whatever reason had fallen behind deadlines etc.\n\nCarwithen,s first film score was for the 1948 production To The Public Danger directed by Terence Fisher who as we all know was to go on to become one of Hammer studios most prolific and respected directors. Produced by Highbury studios this was in essence a public information film, I say public information as it was a film that was produced to highlight the dangers of drink driving. Carwithen wrote just the opening and closing music for the film which is presented on the compilation in a short arrangement, this was the first of two films that Carwithen scored for Fisher the second being Mantrap in 1952/53 and music from that movie is also included on this compilation in a thirteen-minute suite. It is a compilation worth having and displays the way in which British film music evolved.\n\nHammer returned to Robin Hood a few times, with director Terence Fisher helming the 1960 movie, The Sword of Sherwood Forest. It starred Richard Greene who reprised his popular TV role as Robin for the big screen in glorious technicolour. The movie also starred Peter Cushing who was excellent as The Sheriff of Nottingham and had a suitably rousing musical score by Welsh Born composer Alun Hoddinott, the composer was not actually a film music composer, in fact during his long and illustrious career as a composer of serious or classical music. Hoddinott working on just this movie but also writing for two or three projects for television, but his main focus was composing music for concert hall performance. The movie also featured Nigel Green as Little John and Richard Pasco as Edward Earl of Newark and included small parts for Oliver Reed and Derren Nesbitt. Basically, it was an extension of what TV audiences had been served up from 1955 through to 1959. The soundtrack also included songs penned by composer Stanley Black. Hoddinott was born in Bargoed, Glamorganshire, Wales. He was educated at Gowerton Grammar school before attending the University College, Cardiff, and later studied privately with Arthur Benjamin. His first major composition, the Clarinet Concerto, was performed at the Cheltenham Festival of 1954 by Gervase de Peyer with the Hallé Orchestra and Sir John Barbirolli.\n\nThis brought Hoddinott to the attention of many, the composer following this with a string of commissions by leading orchestras and soloists. These commissions continued up to his death, in 2008, he was championed by some of the most distinguished singers and instrumentalists of the 20th century. These include singers such as Dame Margaret Price, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Sir Thomas Allen, Jill Gomez, Sir Geraint Evans and more recently Claire Booth, Helen Field, Gail Pearson, and Jeremy Huw Williams. Instrumentalists have included Ruggiero Ricci, Dennis Brain, Osian Ellis, Cecil Aronowitz, Nia Harries, Roger Woodward and John Ogdon to name but a few, and more recently euphonium player David Childs, cellist Kathryn Price, trombonist Mark Eager and song pianist Andrew Matthews-Owen.\n\nThe composer was prolific, writing symphonies, sonatas, and concertos: his style evolved over a long and distinguished career, from the neo-classicism of the Clarinet Concerto to a brand of serialism which allowed a tonal framework to the structure, combining a penchant for dark textures and brooding harmonies like that of another British composer, Alan Rawsthorne. However, his move into opera from 1970 helped to expand his style and range. His music often displayed a brooding, and darkly expressive persona. One of the best examples is his rhapsodic Poem for violin and orchestra, inspired by a line from James Joyce, The Heaven tree of Stars.\n\nAlun Hoddinott was also a gifted teacher and as Professor of Music at University College, Cardiff, was responsible for the expansion of the Department of Music (with a purpose-built building) which became the largest in Europe in the 1980s. Hoddinott taught a number of talented composers during his time at Cardiff, including the Irish composer John Buckley and Welsh composers Karl Jenkins, Jeffrey Lewis, Gwyn Parry-Jones, John Metcalf and Christopher Painter.\n\nIt was I think during the 1960’s that Hammer became more prominent and prolific, their horror tales becoming infamous amongst the cinema audiences of the day. But of course, Hammer did turn its hand to other genres, including Sci-Fi, Comedy, Adventure and Drama, and although we do not readily associate the studio with these genres, they made a good job of bringing them to the big screen.\n\nA series of movies that comes to mind is the Prehistoric tales with the likes of Hammer glamour trio Rachel Welch, Victoria Vettri, and Julie Ege sporting those animal skin bikinis, and the stop-go action special effects of dinosaurs doing battle with man and other beasts. One Million Years BC, When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth, Creatures the World Forgot, and the ill-fated Prehistoric Women or Slave Girls as was entitled in some countries.\n\nThe first three titles were all successful at the box office, but the lesser-known Prehistoric Women fared not so well, the composer on the movie was Carlo Martelli, who told me in interview about his experience on this movie and his less than fruitful experience with producer/director Michael Carreras.\n\n“Carreras was a total philistine when it came to music. He did not have the remotest feeling for or understanding of it. As for taking an active role in where any music was to be placed, or what style of music etc, he did unfortunately try and do this, in common with many other composers that work in film, I had to sit and listen to vast amounts of preposterous and ill-informed drivel, and whilst doing this try to keep a straight and serious face. It is a sad fact that nowadays many directors, producers and so-called music supervisors are musically illiterate. Many composers such as I have to suffer a great amount of indignity from these people. There is nothing worse than being engaged to score a film, and when the music is ready being told that it is unsuitable or wrong by someone who is tone deaf”.\n\nSo, if the composer did not get on with Carreras, why, did he return to Hammer for Slave Girls?\n\n“I suppose it was all down to money again, but Slave Girls was really a favour for Phil Martell, the film was a fiasco, I was deliberately set up on this by Martell, It happened as follows, Phil had not been able to find a composer for the film, I think that Carreras first choice was a European composer but they had turned it down. So, Martell came to me and misled me about the film, he originally told me that the score he required would only be a very sparing one, fifteen minutes at the most. He also said I would have three weeks to complete it. This to me sounded like a schedule made in heaven, it was sheer luxury compared with other scoring assignments. Well in the end it transpired that the movie required fifty minutes of score, and I would have less than ten days to complete it. As a result of this deceit the music I had already written was totally unsuitable, and I had to start again, thus another session had to be booked, which took us way over budget, and then I had to do some re-writes, which again added more to the cost By this time Carreras was very annoyed indeed, but obviously he did not know the full facts of the story, Martell made sure I took all the blame for his mistakes. As a result, I never worked directly for Hammer again”.\n\nAlthough the composer had bad memories of Slave Girls, his music was still supportive and interesting, the score was never released, but sections of it have made their way onto the likes of You Tube and the odd track has appeared on compilations of music from Hammer movies. The composer scored The Curse of the Mummy’s Tomb which was also issued as part of the Hammer film music series on GDI records, listening to the score its sounds as if it is performed by a very large orchestra, I asked the composer what size orchestra was he allowed to utilise for this score?\n\n“I was encouraged to use a larger brass section; this was to achieve a big sound where it was necessary. This section consisted of 8 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones and 2 tubas. The remainder of the orchestra was made up of, 2 flutes (which doubled as piccolos), cor anglais, bass, clarinet, double bassoon, timpani, percussion, harp, 4 cellos, 14 violins, 3 double basses and a heckelphone. Hammer had only a small budget for music on their films, or at least that is what I was told. But they did employ some of the best musicians around at the time. Thus, the performances were always very good, and by writing in a certain fashion, I was able to make the orchestra sound larger than it actually was”.\n\nCarlo Martelli and fellow composer Gerard Schurmann collaborated on a few things some being Hammer films, so I enquired about their association.\n\n“Gerry, taught me the technique of writing music for film, he had heard a performance of my second symphony on the radio, and had marked me as someone that he would approach if ever he were hard pushed for time on a project and required some assistance. In 1963, I worked with him on two movies, Dr. Syn, and The Ceremony, and then indeed on all of his subsequent film scores. A great deal of the music in these movies is mine, indeed much of it reappears in scores that I have written, so it becomes confusing at times, who has written what. The music for The Ceremony for example was re-cycled and arranged differently and used again on The Lost Continent, so this is why I said I never directly worked for Hammer again but was involved indirectly”.\n\nThe scoring process is different for every composer, did Martelli have a set way of scoring a picture,and did he consider the orchestrating of a score as important as the composing?\n\n“I would normally just look at the movie I was asked to score just once. This was normally with either the director or the producer and editor, and in hammers case the MD. We would reach a decision as to where the music was to be placed etc, and then go home and await the cue sheets. I never read a script, this was a pointless exercise, because by the time I would get to scoring the movie, the script had probably been altered umpteen times. I have at times written music for films without seeing them, this was when I was ghost writing for certain composers. As for the question of orchestration, yes, totally, it’s all part and parcel of the same thing. It would be unthinkable to hand over my music to an orchestrator or arranger, and yes, the orchestration of the score is just as important as the composing”.\n\nThe scores for the three successful Prehistoric tales as produced by Hammer were by Italian Maestro Mario Nascimbene. Born in Milan, Lombardy Italy as Mario Ernesto Rosolino Nascimbene on November 28th 1913. Mario Nascimbene as he became known was to become one of the most successful Italian film music composers of the 20th Century.\n\nHe studied composition and conducting at the Guiseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan under Ildebrando Pizzetti, after which he began to write various pieces of chamber music and ballet’s, he began to write music for Italian motion pictures in the 1940,s, his first assignment being L‘amore Canta (Love Song) in 1941. He was certainly one of the most original composers to come out of Europe during this period as he was not frightened to experiment with sounds, and created a unique electronic process where he enhanced the sound of everyday things turning them into musical instruments of sorts, items such as bicycle bells and typewriters would feature within his soundtracks and even the sound of clocks. The utilisation of this type of experimental writing would be passed on to composer Ennio Morricone who worked with Nascimbene on a handful of film scores, most notably Barabbas in 1961, where Morricone provided additional music.\n\nThe composer often incorporated instruments such as the harmonica and jaws harp into his works, which gave it a unique sound, thus attracting film makers from outside of Italy to his somewhat quirky but effective style of scoring. Nascimbene however also wrote more conventional sounding film scores which were highly melodic the composer creating lush and lavish works that were sublime and romantic sounding, these included The Barefoot Contessa A Farewell to Arms Room at the Top, and The Vikings. Nascimbene also worked on the Hammer production The Vengeance of She which was laced with jazz elements in the form of a theme written for tenor sax and strings, that accompanied the young girl at the centre of the film’s storyline. All, of Nascimbene’s Hammer scores were recorded in Rome at the forum studios under the baton of famous musical director Franco Ferrara who also conducted many of his other film soundtracks including Solomon and Sheba,(1959) Alexander the Great (1956) and Romanoff and Juliet (1961), to name but three. He died on January 6th 2002 in Rome Lazio. Nascimbene’s scores for the Hammer dinosaur sagas, were released on both LP record and then to compact disc in Italy by intermezzo music, appearing on the Legend record label, but the sound quality of these recordings was not without distortion, which is something I hope will be remedied at some point in the future.\n\nGDI did include cues from the movies on their compilations, as well as releasing the full score for The Vengeance of She which was paired with James Bernard’s soundtrack for She and presented on one CD.\n\nA composer who scored several movies for Hammer was Don Banks, The Australian-born composer and multi-instrumentalist, trained on piano, saxophone, violin and trombone. The son of a jazz musician, he grew up and was educated in Melbourne. After serving with the Army Medical Corps during the war years, he studied at the University Conservatorium of Music and graduated with a diploma in composition. Banks moved to England in 1950 to continue his training under the Hungarian émigré Matyas Seiber, while supporting himself financially as a sideman in a dance band.\n\nDuring the fifties he composed a few concertos and chamber music which attracted critical notice. He won several prestigious awards, including the Sir Arnold Bax Society Medal (1959). One of his works, ‘Four Pieces for Orchestra’ was performed by the London Philharmonic in 1954. Due in part to his father’s legacy, he also remained very much steeped in jazz, both as a player and as arranger. He became more prolific as a jazz composer after cultivating a friendship with Cleo Laine and John Dankworth.\n\nThe resulting creative partnership spawned a series of works which fused classical music and jazz, including “Settings from Roget” (1966). He later created pieces like ‘Nexus’ (1971), for jazz quartet and symphony orchestra; and ‘Take 8’ (1973) for jazz and string quartet.\n\nFurthermore, Banks was at the cutting edge of combining traditional acoustic instruments with electronics, including using some of the first available synthesizers, eventually becoming a founding member of the British Society for Electronic Music.\n\nPrimarily for commercial reasons, Don Banks joined Hammer studios in 1962. He wrote several atmospheric scores for thrillers and horror films, collaborating with two of Hammer’s musical directors Philip Martell and John Hollingsworth. Banks also scored films for Hammer’s rival Amicus at the same time. Outstanding examples of his work for film include his jazzy, typically 60’s ‘film noir’ score for Hysteria (1965); his eerie, dramatic theme for Nightmare (1964), which was full of foreboding and terror, Rasputin the Mad Monk (1966) and the equally polished and diverse score for The Reptile (1966), with its predominant Indian influences. Banks decided to part company with Hammer after five years to resume what he referred to as more serious musical pursuits.\n\nIn 1972, he returned to Australia to take up a position with the Canberra School of Music, followed thereafter by appointments to the music board of the Australian Council for the Arts and as head of composition to the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music. Physically frail and having had leukaemia for the last eight years of his life, he died in September 1980, aged 56.\n\nAnother Australian born composer that worked on Hammer films during the 1960’s and early 1970’s was Malcolm Williamson, again he was what one would refer to as being a serious music composer as in classically trained and writing predominantly for the concert hall. Born on November 21st, 1931, his Father was a Minister and his Mother acted for a living. The composer took an interest in films from an early age and began to focus upon music during his pre-teen years, studying French horn, Piano and Violin at the Sydney Conservatory. The composer later studied composition with Sir Eugene Gossans. Whilst a teenager and growing up in Australia Williamson worked on a handful of documentaries, scoring them with music that was largely atmospheric and atonal as opposed to being melodic with developed thematic properties. In 1950 Williamson travelled to London where he continued to study music under the tutelage of Elizabeth Lutyens and Erwin Stein. In 1952 the composer settled in England and was already at this time in his early twenties considered by many to be a performer of note, with the assistance of Benjamin Britten and Sir Adri"
