        "text": "1974 has to rank as one of the high water mark years for movies – in particular American movies. The studios were at their most daring this year, and gave young filmmakers a chance to make pretty much anything they wanted to – and they didn’t disappoint. When critics wax nostalgic about American movies in the 1970s, 1974 could be the year they are thinking of. Any of the top five films could have easily been a number one in more recent years.\n\n10. Blazing Saddles/Young Frankenstein (Mel Brooks)\n\nI hate putting ties on my top 10 lists – after all by doing so, you are making them a top 11. But in this case, I made an exception as both of these Mel Brooks films are spoofs of classic movies, and I cannot tell you which one is better or funnier – as both are genius. Blazing Saddles sends up the Westerns brilliantly, with Gene Wilder as the shakiest gun in the West, and of course having a – gasp – Black sheriff. There are more funny moments in this movie than practically any comedy made in the last decade. Young Frankenstein is just as good, sending up the Universal Horror films with Gene Wilder as the mad scientist, and Peter Boyle excellent as the monster. In one of the most inspired cameos in film history, Gene Hackman is wonderful as the blind man who befriends – then maims – the monster. Both of these films are the work of a comedic genius at the top of his form.\n\n9. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Tobe Hooper)\n\nTobe Hooper’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes place in a world without hope, without joy. It is a depraved film, but one that speaks to something deeper than just it’s surface level. Yes, it is a violent, vile, depressing movie where a psychopath with a chainsaw, and a mask made of human skin, cuts, stabs, impales and other brutally kills a group of young people one by one – including one poor sap in a wheelchair. And yes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the scariest films I have ever seen – making great use of its dark cinematography, it’s top notch low budget production design, which is creepy in the extreme, it’s hulking villain, and the screams of the innocent people he hacks to pieces. Yet somehow, I think this movie works magnificently well, and never resorts to the type of torture porn that we have seen in many recent horror films – films that their makers insist were inspired, at least in part, by this film. It is a dark portrait of the times in which is was made, where the hope of the 1960s had given way to cynicism. Is the film a statement on the Vietnam war? I have read some convincing pieces that argue that this group of young people, wandering around in a land they do not understand, and are hacked to pieces by an enemy that they don’t see coming and is completely ruthless. But I’m not sure it really matters if it’s about Vietnam, or America as a whole in that time. Yes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best, scariest horror films ever made – but it is so much more than just that.\n\n8. California Split (Robert Altman)\n\nFor some reason, when the great films of Robert Altman come up, I rarely hear California Split mentioned. It is one of his funniest, most cynical movies – and one that ultimately ends in sadness – not just for the characters, but for the audience, as even though the two characters at the center of the film are not really sympathetic – we feel for them anyway. That is how acutely Altman observes them – and how wonderful the performances by George Segal and Elliot Gould are at creating them. They meet at a poker game and bond when they are mugged in the parking lot afterwards. They don’t know much about each other – and neither do we – except that they both like gambling. They have found someone else to share in their obsession. The film is funny – perhaps as funny as Altman’s MASH – but it is a film that is still full of despair. This is the film that defines the phrase “We laugh so as not to cry”. The two characters are constantly tired, constantly drunk or hung over, and exist on sheer nervous energy – the high they get while they are gambling. The film gives an insight into gambling and gamblers that we have not really seen before. The film has an energy brought on by Altman’s style – the overlapping dialogue, the almost documentary feel of some scenes. By the end of the film, one of the characters at recognizes he has a problem. Will he be able to stay away, or will it drag him back in again. He has nothing else in his life, and if he does walk away, he’ll lose his only friend. California Split belongs on any list of the best Altman movies.\n\n7. Harry and Tonto (Paul Mazursky)\n\nWith all the great films in 1974, it may seem odd to some that I put Harry and Tonto on this list. Surely, there are more accomplished films that didn’t make the cut, but Harry and Tonto is such a simple, beautiful, sad film it is one that I love beyond all reason. Art Carney won an Oscar for his performance as an old, stubborn man who is forced to move out of his apartment before the wrecking ball comes and destroys it. This was his home for decades, and he didn’t want to give it up. Other than his cat, Tonto, it meant more to him then anything in the world. After he is forced to leave, he goes on a road trip and meets all sorts of fascinating people. Tonto is the only constant in his life, and he loves that cat. The people he meets along his journey are sometimes kind, sometimes not, but all are interesting for the time they are on screen. The variety of actors include Geraldine Fitzgerald and Chief Dan George. But to me, this will always be a movie about a relationship between this old man and his beloved cat. When Tonto gets sick, and has to be put down, the movie wisely does not show us the scene with the injection. Rather, it gives us a scene where Carney goes to the back and finds Tonto in a cage, lying down. The scene between them in so touching, so honest, so real that just writing about it now, I’m feeling the urge to cry. Harry and Tonto is a film that is not mentioned much anymore – but it is a wonderful story of an old man and his cat – and to me, will always be the best film Paul Mazursky ever made.\n\n6. Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (Sam Peckinpah)\n\nSam Peckinpah is one of the best directors in history, despite the fact that many of his films don’t live up to the standard he set in his few masterpieces. His early films were interesting – showed us a gifted director – but were also compromised by interference. In his later films, he had descended so far into alcoholism that at times they are a complete mess. But there was a brief period – perhaps no longer than five years – between The Wild Bunch in 1969 and this film – where Peckinpah was a master. If Roger Ebert is right, and Peckinpah had already descended deeper into depression and alcoholism at this point, it is still clear that he had his faculties about him to make this masterwork. The film stars Warren Oates as a sad American piano player living in Mexico, lost in his own alcoholic abyss. But he hears of a reward offered by an angry father who wants the head of the man who impregnated his beloved daughter. Oates finds out that the man is already dead – all he has to do is find his grave, dig it up and chop off the head. He travels with a prostitute to find the head, and the two shares a common delusion – they love each other, perhaps because no one else will love either one – and they will make a fortune and live happily ever after. But things don’t turn out that way. During the course of the movie there will rape and murder – brutal and ugly as only Peckinpah can do it. But Oates has the head, and it is his fortune. He will do anything to protect it, even if it costs him his life. As Peckinpah said ''I did 'Alfredo Garcia' and I did it exactly the way I wanted to. Good or bad, like it or not, that was my film.'' This is one of the masterpieces of Peckinpah’s career.\n\n5. The Conversation (Francis Ford Coppola)\n\nBetween the two Godfather movies, Francis Ford Coppola made this film. But if he was at all rushed, it doesn’t feel like it here. Inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up, The Conversation is about a security expert (Gene Hackman) who specializes in plant sound devices on people to gather information – mostly in infidelity cases. In one such case, he overhears a conversation that haunts him. He believes what he is hearing is two people plotting the murder of another person. He starts to dig deeper, and gets in way over his head. Hackman is great in the lead role – but perhaps most fascinatingly, he isn’t very good at his job, despite how often people praise him. He allows himself to be bugged, and doesn’t realize it, the tapes he gets are often garbled, and he completely and totally misunderstands what he is hearing in that conversation. Coppola has structured The Conversation as a thriller – and it works as a merciless one as we only gradually see all the pieces come together over the course of the film. Yet, it is even better as a character study of Hackman’s lonely, pathetic character – who tries to be a hero, and fails miserably. Coppola has a long, great career but he has really only made four masterpieces – the first two Godfather films, Apocalypse Now and this film. I can think of no higher praise than to say that this film deserves to be mentioned in the company of those ones.\n\n4. Scenes from a Marriage (Ingmar Bergman)\n\nIngmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage is exactly what the title implies – a portrait of a long marriage, giving us single scenes that take us through the years they have been together. When we meet them Erland Josephson and Liv Ullman have been married for 10 years, have children and claim to be the personification of a happy couple – but we sense something underneath that false happiness, and perhaps see their future in the other couple they have dinner with. When we next see them, time has passed, and they are not quite as happy – she has become uninterested in sex, and he is flirting with younger women – but they continue to pretend they are in love. The third episode is when Josephson admits his affair, and tells his wife that he is going away with her lover – devastated Ullman tries to stop him, and enlists the help of her “friends” who admit they have know about the affair for a while. Next, Josephson is tired of his mistress, and comes back to Ullman, who now has a lover of her own, they discuss divorce, try and fail to make love, and decide to perhaps try again. The next segment is the two of them meeting at a lawyers to sign the divorce papers, and soon arguments ensue. The final segment takes place years later, when both have married other people, but are unhappy, so get together one last time to have an affair of sorts. This is the only time they seem happy. Originally made for Swedish television, in six one hour segments, Bergman edited the film down for theatrical release to a lean three hours – but the result is the same. The movie is really about these two people who love each other, hate each other, but cannot get away from each other. Their lives are intertwined, and no matter how they try, they cannot stay away from each other forever. Bergman’s film is one of the best I have ever seen about marriage – about love and relationships and the impossibility of ever truly moving on when you’re so involved with the other person. 30 years later, Bergman would make his final film, Saraband, which essentially adds a seventh segment to this movie, and while it isn’t as good as this – one of Bergman’s very best films – it is still wonderful.\n\n3. A Woman Under the Influence (John Cassavetes)\n\nAnother film about a terribly complicated marriage, A Woman Under the Influence is without a doubt the best film of John Cassavetes career. It gives us a portrait of a woman, played with amazing ferocity by Gena Rowlands, who is somewhat beaten down by life. She has no privacy in her own home, and tries so hard to be exactly what her husband (Peter Falk) wants her to be, but can never quite pull it off. It’s clear that she has emotional and psychological problems – and the movie essentially focuses on the period right before and right after she is checked into a mental hospital. And yet, I think that perhaps the key to A Woman Under the Influence is that everyone in the film is as crazy as Rowlands is, but they seem to fit in better. Surely, Peter Falk has problems of his own – highlighted by the scene where he tries to force his kids to have fun at the beach, and then gets them drunk, and his ill planned party he plans for Rowlands on her release. Rowlands mother, played by her real mother Lady Rowlands, tries to help her daughter, but doesn’t know what to do. Her father seems completely weak willed, and beaten down, and when he eventually does try to help his daughter, it is far too little too late. And then there is Falk’s mother – played in a great performance by Cassavetes real life mother Katherine, who still exerts control over her son, to the detriment of his marriage, and is capable of becoming as hysterical as Rowlands herself. The film is one of the most honest depictions of a marriage I have ever seen – a dark, penetrating, and at times funny, depiction of two people who are equally mad, but somehow work together.\n\n2. Chinatown (Roman Polanski)\n\nChinatown is one of the most detective movies and film noirs of all time – perhaps the best that wasn’t made in the noir heyday of the 1940s and 50s. It functions as a mystery if you want it to – a twisty, turny complex plot that reveals layer after layer of corruption in Los Angeles in the 1940s. But what elevates the movie is that Polanski, and screenwriter Robert Towne, create characters who are not merely pawns in the plot. They are real. Jack Nicholson’s performance as JJ Gittes is not just him donning the old Humphrey Bogart role as detective. They are similar, but there are differences. Gittes is sadder and lonelier – and later angrier – than Bogart ever got. This is not one of those performances where he goes over the top brilliantly, but one where it plays it exactly how it should be played. He looks ridiculous with that bandage on his nose (“You know what happens to nosy people? They lose their noses”). He gets involved with what seems to be a normal adultery case, but then things spiral out of control as he digs deeper, and people aren’t who they appear to be. The two other major characters are Faye Dunaway, as the femme fatale, but not a typical one. She is damaged, and Gittes senses that, but he is still angry when she lies to him. Her father is played by John Huston – who is one of the best screen villains of all time. Think of Charles Foster Kane crossed with Daniel Plainview (who, in his performance, you can tell Day-Lewis is channeling Huston) and you’re on the right track. Yes, there is murder, there is incest, there are brutal beatings in Chinatown. But the real crime is much bigger. As Huston says, it’s “the future”. The movie is bleak – both in its magnificent visual look and its outlook on life. The ending is justly famous because it doesn’t fit in with the typical noir ending. Things don’t work out, the wrong people die. And things continue just as they were before. This, out of all of the film is his career, is Polanski’s masterpiece.\n\n1. The Godfather Part II (Francis Ford Coppola)\n\nWhat can one say about The Godfather Part II that hasn’t already been said? Certainly the film is the equal of its predecessor – perhaps even greater, even though it certainly isn’t quite as entertaining. It is a darker, more nuanced film and has an epic scope to it, covering the early lives of Vito Corleone (now played by Robert DeNiro), as he leaves Siciliy, comes to America and becomes a gangster, as well as his son Michael’s (Al Pacino) complete fall from grace. When we see Michael in the first film, he doesn’t want anything to do with the family business. By the start of this film, he is running it, and over the course of the movie he will fall even farther – climaxing with his having his simple minded brother Fredo (John Cavalze) murdered on that boat. Michael, who was perhaps the only moral character in the first film (although Vito certainly has his own set of morals he lives by), has completely lost them by the end of this film – where he sits completely alone, isolated from everyone around him. The performances in the movie are all amazing – there is a reason why this film tied the record by having 5 acting nominations – and Coppola has perhaps never been in such full control of his films narrative drive and structure. The filmmaking is impeccable – not just in the films big set pieces, like the stalking and murder of the local Don by Vito which is justly infamous – but in every scene. The Godfather Part II is one of the very best films ever made.\n\nJust Missed The Top 10: Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (Martin Scorsese),Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (Rainer Werner Fassbinder), The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (Ted Kotcheff), Death Wish (Michael Winner), F For Fake (Orson Welles), Lacombe Lucien (Louis Malle), Lenny (Bob Fosse), Murder on the Orient Express (Sidney Lumet), The Parallax View (Alan J. Pakula), Phantom of the Paradise (Brain DePalma), The Sugarland Express (Steven Spielberg),Thieves Like Us (Robert Altman), The Yakuza Papers Volume IV: Police Tactics, The Yakuza Papers Volume V: Final Episode,\n\nNotable Films Missed: Alice in the Cities (Wim Wenders), Celine and Julie Go Boating (Jacques Rivette), The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (Werner Herzog), Female Trouble (John Waters), India Song, Lancelot du Lac (Robert Bresson), The Phantom of Liberty (Luis Buneul), The Towering Inferno (John Guillerman), Xala (Ousmane Sembene).\n\nOscar Winner – Best Picture & Director: The Godfather Part II (Francis Ford Coppola)\n\n1974 represents one of the few years where the Academy went against critical consensus, and actually ended up picking the better film in my opinion. At the time, the most critically acclaimed American films of the year were Chinatown and The Conversation – both also would have been worthy choices – but the Academy recognized before many critics did just how great The Godfather Part II was, and gave the film its very deserving Best Picture prize. In doing so, they gave it to one of the most violent, darkest best picture winners ever. The Godfather was easy – because it was so entertaining – but this film is much more complex, so you have to give them credit for giving it the Award. The nominees this year – among them Chinatown, The Conversation and Lenny represent the darkness of the country at the time. You can almost forgive them for nominating The Towering Inferno for the fifth spot for at least lightening the mood a little.\n\nOscar Winner – Best Actor: Art Carney, Harry and Tonto\n\nThis was a year when four of the nominees would have been deserving winners. Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman, along with Carney were all excellent in their films (although my choice would have been Pacino). But Carney’s win shocked a lot of people, who expected one of the younger actors, who had already been nominated for a bunch of Oscars prior to this year, to prevail. Carney carries Harry and Tonto from beginning to end, and creates such a lovable, touching character that you cannot help but love him and his performance. Yes, I think Pacino and Nicholson delivered better performances that Carney. But I will not insult this win, as it really is a wonderful performance.\n\nOscar Winner – Best Actress: Ellen Burstyn, Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore\n\nI feel somewhat bad that the years on either side of this – 1973 and 1975 – were such weak years for leading actresses in American movies, because 1974 has any number of great performances that deserved to win this award. Among the other nominees here were Faye Dunaway, Gena Rowlands and Valerie Perrine (who, if she had of been nominated in her proper category – supporting – would have gotten my vote). While personally, I think Rowlands delivered the best performance, it is hard to fault the Academy for giving the Oscar to Burstyn for her excellent work in Martin Scorsese’s only movie to center on a female protagonist. Burstyn plays a recently widowed mother of a somewhat demanding child, who takes him on the road to try and start a new life for herself. She is not all that much unlike Rowlands, as both women are struggling with the gender roles that have been forced upon them, while the world outside seems to be constantly changing. In many year, Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore would have made my top 10 list, and Burstyn’s performance would have been my clear choice – but this year it wasn’t.\n\nOscar Winner – Best Supporting Actor: Robert DeNiro, The Godfather Part II\n\nThe Academy nominated three actors from The Godfather Part II in this category, but made the right choice in giving the award to DeNiro (although, it would have been a tougher choice for me had they nominated John Cavazle, who was better than the other two nominees Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg). DeNiro captures the mannerisms and voice that Brando used in the first film wonderfully, so what we are really watching here is an extension of that performance. And yet, DeNiro brings other notes to the role as well, and creates a portrait of an ambitious young man on the rise. It must have seemed impossible to fill Brando’s shoes – few actors would have even attempted it – but DeNiro pulls it off brilliantly. Good call.\n\nOscar Winner – Best Supporting Actress: Ingrid Bergman, Murder on the Orient Express\n\nI really do love Ingrid Bergman, but like her first two Oscar wins, for Gaslight and Anastasia, I cannot say her work in Murder on the Orient Express as a Swedish missionary just back from Africa where she helped all those “little brown babies”. I will admit that I think Bergman is a riot in this role, and is probably the best thing about the film (although Albert Finney is a lot of fun as Hercule Poirot as well), but I cannot say she deserved to win. Out of the nominees, Valentina Cortese in Day for Night would have been my favorite (that film is actually a 1973 film, so you’ll find my write up of it there), although the nominees – Diane Ladd’s over the top best friend in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, Talia Shire as Michael’s grieving sister in The Godfather Part II and Madeline Kahn, hilarious in Blazing Saddles, were all worthy as well. I can’t say that this win bothers me too much – it is the best of her three Oscar winning performances – but still does not represent Bergman anywhere near her finest.\n\n1968 saw a lot of bold, innovative films from great filmmakers. Audiences wanted something different and these filmmakers supplied to them. I have a feeling that I need to watch a few more films from this year, but the ones I have seen are great.\n\n10. Who’s That Knocking at My Door (Martin Scorsese)\n\nWho’s That Knocking at My Door is Martin Scorsese’s first film as a director, and you can already see the master filmmaker he would become at work. Yes, the film is a little rough around the edges, but it is also a film that is honest and thoughtful about its subject matter. Obviously inspired by the work of John Cassavetes, the film details the relationship between Harvey Keitel, a “good” Catholic boy and Zina Bethune, a not so good girl. Keitel spends his time carousing with these friends and picking up “dames”, but when he meets Bethune, he thinks he has met the “girl” of his dreams. There is a difference between dames and girls you see – you’ll fuck a dame, but never marry her, but marry a girl who is, of course, as pure as the driven snow. Keitel sees no contradiction in his logic. There are several wonderful, honest moments in the film – a scary sequence where it appears Keitel and his friends maybe on the verge of raping a girl, and later when Bethune confesses her past to Keitel, who cannot deal with it. No, the film does not rank among Scorsese’s best. It is rough around the edges, and the fantasy sex sequence that was added at the distributer’s request certainly doesn’t belong in the film (although, it must be said that it is wonderfully filmed), but there is an honesty, an integrity to the film that is rare – and makes it a worthy addition to this list.\n\n9. Planet of the Apes (Franklin J. Scaffner)\n\nThere are some movies that you know a hell of a lot about before you ever watch them. Planet of the Apes is one of those movies. Who hasn’t seen the clips of Charlton Heston saying “Get your paws off me you damn, dirty ape”, or lamenting his species for blowing it up, when he realizes that he was on earth all along (which gets me singing the final song from the Planet of Apes musical as seen on The Simpsons). But despite that, and all the unnecessary sequels, and Tim Burton’s completely unnecessary remake (which was good only to see Tim Roth’s evil bad guy), Planet of the Apes remains a hell of exciting, fun and at times surprisingly intelligent movie. Yes, Charlton Heston was one of the cheesiest, most ham fisted actors of all time, but there are times when that works for a movie – and this is one of them.\n\n8. The Lion in Winter (Anthony Harvey)\n\nThe 1960s were so full of stylistic innovations that sometimes people forget the more classically entertaining, intelligent films like Anthony Harvey’s magnificent The Lion in Winter. Peter O’Toole gives a wonderful performance as King Henry II, who is aging and needs to decide on an heir to his throne. He has three male children, but he worries that if he names one heir, the others will revolt, or perhaps we will be pushed off the throne himself by his son’s ambition. The movie takes place over one long day – Christmas Eve – where Henry even does his wife, Eleanor (Katherine Hepburn) the honor of letting her out of prison for the occasion. The King of France is there as a guest, and wants to know when his daughter will marry the heir to the throne – the problem is, that Henry has taken her as his mistress, and is thinking perhaps the two of the them can produce the heir themselves. After all, that would give him a lot more time. O’Toole dominates the movie with his larger than life performance – he had played Henry II before (in an even better performance and movie in 1964’s Becket), but Hepburn equals his performance with a grand one of her own. A young Anthony Hopkins is great as one of the sons – who has the line that I remember more than any other in the film when it appears like Henry may have his sons killed, and he wants to fight back and is told by another brother that they will fail no matter what, and why does it matter how they fall and he responds “When the fall is all that’s left, it matters”. Many costume dramas – even the most handsomely mounted among them, feel rather bloodless. The Lion in Winter is one of those rare costume dramas that feel real and immediate.\n\n7. Yellow Submarine (George Dunning)\n\nBy 1968, The Beatles didn’t want to make another movie. They were in the process of creating the White Album, and their band was on the verge of collapse, but they had signed a three picture deal, and had to deliver something. What they came up with was Yellow Submarine, a daring, innovative, trippy animated movie that uses their songs and their likenesses, but allowed The Beatles not to be overly involved – although they loved the final product. The film tells a story of Pepperland, where the evil Blue Meanies, who hate music, invade and turn the colorful Pepperland into a blue, depressing place – until The Beatles arrive to save the day. The plot doesn’t really matter, and neither really does the dialogue which is at times so nonsensical that you simply have to smile and go with the flow. The songs, of course, are a highlight of the movie, but so is the imagery which is whimsical, funny and inventive. Yellow Submarine is a movie that doesn’t have to make sense – it is precisely what it wants to be, no more and certainly no less.\n\n6. The Producers (Mel Brooks)\n\nMel Brooks has got to be considered the father of the dirty comedy – yet unlike many of the people who came after him; his best films are also intelligent and satirical. Brooks’ first film, The Producers, may just be the best thing he ever made. Zero Mostel gives a deliriously funny performance as a down on his luck theater producer who hits upon an idea given to him by his accountant, Gene Wilder. They will produce the worst play in Broadway history – and yet all of Mostel’s old lady backers to put up the money for it – pocketing the extra money, and never having to pay them any of the profits, because there won’t be any. The find the play – called Springtime for Hitler – written by deranged Nazi Kenneth Mars, which they describe as a “love letter to Hitler”. They cast a drugged out hippie, Dick Shawn, to play the lead, and hire the worst director on Broadway, Christopher Hewitt to direct. The resulting show is so offensive that they feel they have succeeded in their goal. Brooks film is hilarious for many reasons – the wonderful cast, the great songs, the staging of the musical the title musical number – but mainly because Brooks is fearless in how he presents it. He knows people will be offended by the movie, and doesn’t care. He goes for broke. That’s what great comedies are supposed to do.\n\n5. Night of the Living Dead (George A. Romero)\n\nNight of the Living Dead is one of the most groundbreaking horror films in history – and other than my number 1 film, probably the film that has had the greatest influence on film history of anything released this year. Director George A. Romero made the film for practically no money in 1968 – and the independent nature of the production allowed him to create precisely the movie he wanted to make. The film was grisly, violent and shocking by the standards of the times, and while the shock value has faded, the film still has an undeniable visceral impact when viewed today. Night of the Living Dead was also daring in that, although it was a horror film, it took on many social issues – the destruction of the American family, the war in Vietnam and racism. Romero has continued his zombie apocalypse movies for the past forty years – most recently with 2010’s Survival of the Dead. He has become one of the giants of horror films – and it all started with this shocking little film.\n\n4. Faces (John Cassavetes)\n\nFaces is an appropriate title for John Cassavetes film about a marriage that is slowly imploding. Here is a film where the characters are constantly talking, laughing, singing, dancing, yelling and yet it is in those rare quiet moments, where Cassavetes simply concentrates on the actors faces that we truly get the see the real people inside. John Marley and Lynn Carlin are excellent as a married couple whose marriage is simply crumbling down around them. He spends time with a prostitute (Gena Rowlands), comes home and ends up in an argument with his wife that ends with him demanding a divorce. Then he goes back to the prostitute. Perhaps the forget the pain she is feeling, Carlin and some friends go out, and end up back at her place with a charming younger man – Seymour Cassell. Soon all her friends are gone, and it’s just Cassell and Carlin together. These four characters are so acutely observed by Cassavetes, avoiding all stereotypes and simply allowed to be themselves. There is a lot of false bravado in the film – a lot of laughing and joking, but these characters are really insecure below it all. This is one of the greatest triumphs of Cassavetes career – because he sees these people who are trapped in their own little worlds, hung up with their own issues that they are unable to see the other people around them for who they are. The performances are all wonderful, and Cassavetes trademark style (which infuriates some, I should point out) is put to full use here. There are some movies that are mere time capsules of their era, that age badly over time – Faces seems just as relevant today as it must have in 1968.\n\n3. Rosemary’s Baby (Roman Polanski)\n\nRosemary’s Baby still has the power to shock, scare and titillate over 40 years after it was released. The film works so well all these years later, because it does not depend on the surprise ending for its effectiveness. I’m sure most viewers were like me the first time they saw the film – and knew the ending heading in. But Roman Polanski does a masterful job in Rosemary’s Baby precisely because he does not depend on that shock for the ending. There is a sense of foreboding throughout the entire film, a sense that something is not quite right, and not that Mia Farrow is simply crazy – but that her husband (John Cassavetes) and her next door neighbors (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) really are up to something evil. We watch in horror not to find out what is going to happen, but because we cannot stop it from happening. Farrow is marvelously effective as Rosemary, and Gordon is perhaps even better as the seemingly kindly old woman next door. Polanski keeps the plot moving along, and the sense of dread gradually building until it becomes nearly impossible to watch. He keeps us involved in the story, believing the story right up until the final moment. Polanski hit it out of the park in his first American film.\n\n2. Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone)\n\nPerhaps because it doesn’t star Clint Eastwood, Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America isn’t as well known by the public as his previous spaghetti Westerns were. Yet the film has enjoyed a huge, and deserved critical reputation. It just maybe the best film of Leone’s career. The film’s plot is almost endless complex – involving a new wife (Claudia Cardinale) of a wealthy man who arrives at her new home to discover her family is dead, and she is now the sole owner of a prime piece of land. Henry Fonda is magnificent as the cold blooded bad guy who killed them, and wants the land, and has framed Jason Robards for the crime. Then there is Charles Bronson, a man with no name, who rides in and has a score to settle with Fonda. What score? Leone doesn’t tell us until very late in the movie. The film is masterfully photographed, contains a wonderful score by Ennio Morricone, and great performances all around – especially Fonda whose icy blue eyes are full of evil and malice. Leone captures the atmosphere just about perfectly – a large, expansive set, lots of extras who feel real, and he wrings every last ounce of drama and tension out of the films set-up, and gun battles. I’m not sure if Once Upon a Time in the West in Leone’s best film – but it ranks right alongside The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon in America as the masterpieces of his career.\n\n1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick)\n\nStanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey is the kind of big budgeted, epic mind trip movies that no one in their right mind would ever green light to day – where audiences are not as adventuresome, or perhaps just not on as many drugs, as they were in 1968. It is one of the best films of all time, which is even more impressive when you remember that the most intriguing character in the film is little more than a blinking light, and an eerily calm voice of the computer HAL. None of the human characters offer any real complexity – but then again they do not have to, because they are not the point of the movie. 2001 may just be the ultimate atheist movie – a movie that proposes an alternate version of human history from that proposed by the bible. The story of human is not the great tragedy of how far we have fallen from our biblical roots – where Eve damned mankind forever by eating that apple – but how far we have come from the our roots as savage primates. Kubrick’s movie suggests the next step in human evolution, how we are constantly changing, shifting into something greater than ourselves. The film is innovative and groundbreaking in its use of special effects, masterful in its direction from the longest flash forward in cinema history – representing millions of years when that monkey at the beginning throws the bone in the air – to the breathtaking “murder” of HAL, but the film is so much more than just those elements. This truly is one of the greatest films ever made – and the supreme achievement by one of the true masters of cinema.\n\nJust Missed The Top 10: The Boston Strangler (Richard Flesicher), Bullitt, Greetings (Brian DePalma), Hour of the Wolf (Ingmar Bergman), Madigan (Don Siegal), The Odd Couple (Gene Saks), Shame (Ingmar Bergman).\n\nNotable Films Missed: The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach (Jean Marie Straub), Funny Girl (William Wyler), Hour of the Furnaces (Octavio Getino & Fernando E. Solanas), L’Amour fou (Jacques Rivette), Memories of Underdevelopment (Tomás Gutiérrez Alea), The Party (Blake Edwards), Rachel Rachel (Paul Newman), Romeo & Juliet (Franco Zefferelli), The Salesman (David & Albert Maysles & Charlotte Zwerin), The Subject Was Roses (Ulu Grosbard), Teorema (Pier Paolo Passolini), A Touch of Zen (King Hu).\n\nOscar Winner – Best Picture & Director: Oliver (Carol Reed)\n\nContrary to what many of my readers probably think of me by now – considering how often I have picked on the musical winners of the Best Picture Oscar – I can, and do musicals – even large scale ones at times. But, don’t count me among the people who think that Charles Dickens’ dark tale of orphans needed a toe tapping update and lively music to make it worthwhile. Worse still, the boy who plays Oliver is a consummate bore – he has zero personality and is so bland he fades into the background in practically every single scene. Ron Moody’s Fagin is Jewish stereotyping at its worst, providing no complexity to the character, and essentially making him an evil clown. The only actor in the film who is truly wonderful is young Jack Wild as The Artful Dodger, who is full of energy and charisma. The rest of the movie is a big, bloated bore. I love Carol Reed as a director – see his 1940s films like The Fallen Idol, Odd Man Out and The Third Man to see what he is really capable of, and forget this mess of a film.\n\nOscar Winner – Best Actor: Cliff Robertson, Charly\n\nThere are some choices the Academy has made over the years that I not only don’t agree with, but that absolutely mystify me. I may not like Oliver as a film for example, but I understand why others did and why it won the Best Picture Oscar. But this win for Cliff Robertson in Charly is one of those ones where I simply shake my head and wonder what the hell they were thinking. Robertson plays a mentally challenged janitor who wants to become smarter – but after years of night school, he still cannot spell his name properly (hence the title). He undergoes an experimental treatment to make him smarter – and it works, as he soon surpasses his teacher, Claire Bloom, and then falls in love with her, and she with him, until it is realized that the affect is only temporary, and that he will revert back to his former state. The film, when viewed today is so horribly dated, that at times it borders on unwatchable (the two montage sequences, first with Charly growing a mustache, riding a motorcycle and kissing lots of women, the second as he and Bloom fall in love are the most glaring examples, but the whole movie suffers). Robertson isn’t all that convincing as a mentally challenged man, and isn’t that much better when he regains his intelligence. I suppose a good movie could be made out of this material – but this movie certainly is not it – and Robertson is among the main reasons why. When you think that they nominated Peter O’Toole’s great performance in The Lion in Winter – an actor who holds the record for the most nominations without a win – and still went with this bad performance in this bad movie, it simply boggles the mind.\n\nOscar Winner – Best Actress: Katherine Hepburn, The Lion in Winter/Barbara Striesand, Funny Girl\n\nFor only the second time in history, The Academy had a tie for an acting Oscar win. The strange thing about it is, that this was the only year that the Academy allowed nominees who were not previously part of the Academy to vote in the winning round – normally, although they become automatic members, they have to wait until the next year – meaning that if assuming Striesand voted for herself, this strange quirk in the rules (that no one could possibly see resulting in this) was the cause of the tie! Due to my completely irrational hatred of Striesand (other than The Prince of Tides and Meet the Fockers, I have never see any of her other films), I cannot comment on her performance. However, Hepburn was marvelous and forceful in her performance in The Lion in Winter. While I wouldn’t say it was her best performance, it is certainly the best of her performances to win an Oscar (and there were 4 of those!).\n\nOscar Winner – Best Supporting Actor: Jack Albertson, The Subject Was Roses\n\nAs far as I know, The Subject Was Roses has never been released on DVD, so Jack Albertson’s Oscar winning turn has eluded me up to this point – although I am very interested to see the film, and Albertson is a fine character actor, so I suspect it’s a quality performance. Out of the nominees, I would have probably chosen either Gene Wilder’s hilarious turn in The Producers, or Seymour Cassell’s wonderful hippie performance in Faces – although I think the best performance in this category this year was by Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in America.\n\nOscar Winner – Best Supporting Actress: Ruth Gordon, Rosemary’s Baby\n\nRuth Gordon is great in Rosemary’s Baby – the seemingly sweet old woman next door to Mia Farrow who at first simply seems kind and overly concerned and nosy regarding her pregnancy, but gradually starts to become creepier and creepier leading up the finale of the film, where she reveals her true colors. Gordon, along with her husband Garson Kanin wrote some wonderful comedies in the 1940s and 50s – including Oscar nominations for her work on A Double Life, Adam’s Rib and Pat and Mike. She had also been acting for years, but never really got good roles until the 1960s. Her work in Rosemary’s Baby is legendary. Considering how infrequently work in the horror genre is recognized by the Academy – in any category, but especially acting – her win is a cause for celebration for fans of the genre."
