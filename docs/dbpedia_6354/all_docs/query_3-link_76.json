        "text": "The term neorealism was first widely used in the late 1940s to describe what became the most famous and influential film movement. It sprang up in Italy as a reaction against the artificiality of the so-called “white telephone” school of upper-class comedies and melodramas then popular under fascism, favouring instead naturalistic pictures shot on authentic locations using non-professional actors. Luchino Visconti’s gritty Ossessione (1943) is usually identified as the first genuine example. But the name that will always be associated with neorealism is Roberto Rossellini, and most especially his Rome, Open City (1945) and Paisà (1946), two rough, grainy movies set in Italy during the second world war. They helped change the face of world cinema and, with Germany Year Zero (1948), set in the ruins of postwar Berlin, came to be known as his War Trilogy.\n\nBorn in Rome, where his father’s construction firm put up the city’s first purpose-built cinema, Rossellini (1906-77) was fascinated from childhood by the movies. Although a man of the left (his final, unrealised project was a biography of Karl Marx), he began his movie career at the invitation of his friend Vittorio Mussolini, Il Duce’s son, and made his name with three wartime propaganda films dubbed his Fascist Trilogy. So the War Trilogy represents an apparent volte-face. It is, however, neither triumphalist nor apologetic.\n\nShot on a shoestring budget shortly after the events it re-creates, Rome, Open City is a vivid, fast-moving melodrama about the last violent days of the German occupation of Rome, with magnificent performances from Anna Magnani as a resistance leader’s wife and Aldo Fabrizi as an anti-Nazi priest. This was followed by the uneven but equally memorable Paisà, six stories, mostly of death and disillusion, following the American liberators from Sicily to the Po Valley. The deeply pessimistic Germany Year Zero centres on an 11-year-old German boy attempting – with tragic consequences – to understand the shattered world of postwar Berlin. Dedicated by Rossellini to his son Romano, who died suddenly in 1946 aged nine, it was poorly received and never widely shown, though Chaplin called it “the most beautiful Italian film” he’d ever seen.\n\nThis excellent three-disc set is essential viewing, and in addition to the trilogy contains two short features starring Magnani and a pair of illuminating documentaries."
