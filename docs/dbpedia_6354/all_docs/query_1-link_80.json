        "text": "The themes and tropes of the most famous film noirs created a blueprint for many of the crime dramas and thrillers we watch today. The best modern crime thrillers and mystery movies, from Se7en to Prisoners to The Batman, borrow their grisly aesthetics from the darkened streets and sketchy characters of these classics. And the most heralded neo-noirs, from Mulholland Drive to Nightcrawler to Blade Runner (one of the best movies ever from the 1980s), owe a debt of gratitude to film noir’s highly stylized portrayal of corrupt society and collective existential crisis. These films, often shot in stark black and white, paint a grim picture of a post-war society, exploring moral conflicts through characters caught in the fray of social upheaval.\n\nThis list aims to honor the best and most important entries in this genre. From hard-nosed detectives to femme fatales and all the commentaries on violence, aggression and social isolation that surrounds them in these gritty, shadow-laden streets, each movie on this list stands as a testament to film noir’s enduring legacy. Whether you're a long-time aficionado or a newcomer interested in an introduction to classic cinema, this collection promises a compelling journey through the murderous alleys and the twisted narratives that define the genre.\n\nWhat Is Film Noir?\n\nThe term “film noir” has been a subject of fascination and study (and debate, as we’ll soon discuss) amongst cinephiles since its inception. The history of the genre dates back to the 1930s and 1940s, originating from a blend of American crime dramas and French poetic realism, as well as German Expressionist cinema. This period, known as the classic era of film noir (1940-1950), introduced audiences to a new form of storytelling that was unconventional and dark, both in narrative and visual style. The term itself, translating to \"black film,\" was first used in a 1938 review by Francois Vinneuil and became widely recognized after Nino Frank's 1946 analysis of American films that had been released in France post-WWII. These films, including The Maltese Falcon (1941), Out of the Past (1947) and In a Lonely Place (1950), among others, were pivotal in defining what we now know as film noir.\n\nThe debate over whether film noir is a distinct genre or a stylistic approach persists. However, its identifiable characteristics — low-key lighting, unbalanced compositions, themes of crime and moral ambiguity, and the presence of elements such as the femme fatale and the cynical detective — suggest a specific, though flexible, framework that influences both the narrative and visual aspects of these films. These atmospheric qualities can vary from oneiric (dream-like) musicals to gritty gangster films, embodying a mood that is strange, smoky, cruel and ambivalently moral.\n\nDistinguishing film noir from neo-noir involves understanding the evolution of the genre into a modern context. While film noir refers specifically to the mid-20th century films that adhered to certain thematic and stylistic conventions, neo-noir is a term used to describe films produced after the classic era (post-1959) that reinterpret, update or expand upon these conventions. Neo-noir often incorporates color, contemporary settings and themes that don’t necessarily adhere to post-war angst (such as our relationship with technology in the case of tech-noir), while still maintaining the essence of noir. This evolution allows the noir tradition to continue influencing modern cinema, forming a bridge between the past and the present as we continue to explore humanity’s darker facets.\n\nTop Film Noir Movies\n\nIt must be stated up top that my curated list of the 25 best film noirs ever made is purely subjective and based on my personal tastes. That means some of the most famous and influential movies will not be on this list — which is why I’d like to use this section to highlight the important film noirs we cannot sidestep. I also had to make some concessions on the movies included in this list. For instance, I do not consider Night of the Hunter, one of my favorite movies of all time, to fit the widely accepted definition of the genre. I also have chosen to exclude movies in the neo-noir genre and strictly focus on films made before 1960.\n\nAs far as box office earnings, the genre was not prone to breaking the box office. Sometimes a popular filmmaker would hit it big — such as Alfred Hitchcock with Notorious, which pulled in $24.5 million back in 1946 — but it was rare for a genre film to make as much money as a traditional drama or comedy back in the 1940s and 1950s. But it is worth noting the cultural impact these films have had on audiences and critics alike. Among these classics, movies like The Third Man, Leave Her to Heaven and The Big Sleep stand out not only for their critical acclaim but also for their impressive box office earnings in $5-10 million range.\n\nThe architects behind these masterpieces include some of the most revered directors in cinema history. Icons like Billy Wilder, with his unflinching cynicism in Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard, and Otto Preminger, whose Laura and Fallen Angel play with romance and femme fatales in a stylistically delicious manner, are just two of the most notable visionaries who have left an indelible mark on the genre. Their works are joined by those of other legendary directors such as Samuel Fuller, Joseph H. Lewis, Nicholas Ray, Robert Aldrich and Fritz Lang, whose contributions have been instrumental in defining the contours of film noir.\n\n25. This Gun for Hire (1942)\n\nMeet Philip Raven, a hitman who embarks on a dark journey after being double-crossed by his employer. Portrayed by the incomparable Alan Ladd, this character’s path entwines with singer and secret agent Ellen Graham, portrayed by the equally comparable Veronica Lake, leading them through a narrative filled with espionage and complex emotions. Directed by Frank Tuttle, the film is an adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, and has been noted by critics and historians for its significant contribution to the film noir genre, particularly through its exploration of betrayal and redemption within its classically shadow-laden visual style. The film not only solidified Ladd's status in Hollywood but also celebrated the magnetic on-screen chemistry between him and Lake, making This Gun for Hire a seminal work.\n\nHere is where you can stream This Gun for Hire.\n\n24. Shadow of a Doubt (1943)\n\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock, Shadow of a Doubt finds the director once again challenging and penetrating the seemingly idyllic American family through a malignant force. In this suspense-laden film, young Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton, played by Teresa Wright, discovers her beloved uncle, Charles Oakley, played by Joseph Cotten, may be a serial murderer. The film's brilliance lies in its ability to weave the ordinary with the menacing, as the charm of small-town life is juxtaposed with the creeping horror of Charlie's realization. One of Hitchcock's only and true contributions to the film noir genre was met with great critical acclaim, as were the compelling performances by Wright and Cotten. The film’s exploration of the hidden yet undeniable seedy side human nature and the fine line between innocence and guilt allowed Hitchcock’s unique stylistic take on the genre to stand apart from the rest.\n\nHere is where you can stream Shadow of a Doubt.\n\n23. Gun Crazy (1950)\n\nWith Gun Crazy, film noir superstar Joseph H. Lewis directs a stark, gripping narrative of obsession and doom, centered around the tumultuous relationship between two sharpshooters. Bart Tare, an ex-Army man with a deep-seated passion for guns, finds his match in Laurie Starr, a carnival sharpshooter with a penchant for danger. Played with entertaining intensity by John Dall and Peggy Cummins, the couple's whirlwind romance quickly spirals into a desperate life of crime. The film's raw energy and daring cinematography, capturing the lovers' crime spree with an almost documentary realism, was praised by critics and broke new ground in film noir. The film’s innovative storytelling and dynamic visual style expanded the psychological depth of its characters and ultimately offered a poignant exploration of American gun culture.\n\nHere is where you can stream Gun Crazy.\n\n22. In a Lonely Place (1950)\n\nNicholas Ray's In a Lonely Place delves into the dark undercurrents of Hollywood, focusing on the turbulent life of Dixon Steele, a screenwriter played by Humphrey Bogart with an exquisite blend of cynicism and vulnerability. When Steele becomes a murder suspect, his relationship with neighbor Laurel Gray, played by Gloria Grahame, evolves from romantic to something more sinister as the pressures mount and suspicions rise. This heralded film stands out for its critical examination of fame, love and the destructive power of doubt, earning it widespread critical acclaim for its nuanced portrayal of complex characters and its decidedly bleak perspective on human nature. In a Lonely Place is celebrated not only as a high point in Bogart and Grahame's careers but also as a profound, introspective, meta take on the film noir tradition.\n\nHere is where you can stream In a Lonely Place.\n\n21. The Third Man (1949)\n\nSet against the backdrop of post-war Vienna, The Third Man is a masterpiece of atmosphere and intrigue from director Carol Reed. The film follows Joseph Cotten’s character Holly Martins, an American writer who finds himself in a web of mystery and deception as he investigates the mysterious death of his friend Harry Lime — played by Orson Welles in one of the most memorable character reveals ever. With its iconic zither score, strikingly angular cinematography and morally questionable characters, The Third Man has been hailed by critics and lovers of the genre for its stylish execution, as well as the haunting presence of Welles. The film's exploration of the bleak realities of post-war America has made it a landmark in cinema history, revered for its artistry and its profound commentary on the human condition.\n\nHere is where you can stream The Third Man.\n\n20. Detour (1945)\n\nA journey into the dark heart of the American Dream, Detour chronicles Al Roberts' descent from a New York nightclub pianist to a man ensnared in a web of fate and murder on the long road to Hollywood. Tom Neal's portrayal of Roberts provides a haunting look at desperation and despair, while Ann Savage's Vera embodies the fatalistic pull of noir's doomed relationships. Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer on a famously shoestring budget of less than $100,000, this film transcended its limitations through its experimental approach to storytelling. Detour is lauded for showcasing how rich atmospheric depth and deep character development can emerge from the constraints of low-budget filmmaking.\n\nHere is where you can stream Detour.\n\n19. The Glass Key (1942)\n\nThrough the entangled lives of Ed Beaumont and his unyielding loyalty to a political boss, The Glass Key spins a tale of murder, betrayal and the quest for power. Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake once again team up to bring their signature dynamic chemistry to the screen, navigating a world where trust is as brittle as glass. Stuart Heisler directs this adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel, crafting a story that delves into the complexities of friendship and corruption. Lake, embodying both allure and mystery, complements Ladd's stoicism with her performance, weaving a narrative fabric that is as visually engaging as it is narratively compelling. The film's acclaim stems from its ability to articulate the shadows of the human heart through the lens of political machinations, establishing The Glass Key as an important piece of the noir playbook.\n\nHere is where you can stream The Glass Key.\n\n18. Too Late for Tears (1949)\n\nIn the twisting narrative of Too Late for Tears, Lizabeth Scott's portrayal of Jane Palmer takes us on a dark journey driven by greed and deception. Byron Haskin directs this tale of a seemingly innocuous roadside encounter that spirals into a deadly game of cat and mouse, highlighting the lengths to which people will go when consumed by greediness and cupidity. This richly melodramatic story expertly navigates the murky waters of temptation, showcasing Scott's ability to embody the complexities of her character's journey from innocence to something far more sinister. This film stands as a testament to the enduring fascination with the femme fatale archetype, offering a fresh perspective by placing her at the center of the action, driving the plot forward with a mixture of cunning and desperation that has come to define the genre's exploration of flawed humanity.\n\nHere is where you can stream Too Late for Tears.\n\n17. Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nNightmare Alley explores the dark corners of ambition and desperation through the rise and fall of Stanton Carlisle, played mesmerizingly by Tyrone Power. Set against the backdrop of a traveling carnival, the film delves into this unique noir protagonist’s manipulation and deceit as he seeks to climb the social ladder — only to find that the top is as perilous as the bottom. Power's performance, a departure from his typically heroic roles, showcases his versatility and emptathetic understanding of flawed characters. Edmund Goulding directs with a keen eye for the visually and emotionally grotesque, painting a picture of ambition run amok that is both cautionary and wildly watchable. Nightmare Alley's critical success stemmed from its fearless exploration of the psyche, rendered in stark detail against the vivid setting of the carnival world, marking it as a unique and unforgettable entry in the film noir canon.\n\nHere is where you can stream Nightmare Alley.\n\n16. Raw Deal (1948)\n\nAnthony Mann's Raw Deal captures the essence of film noir's fascination with fate and morality through the lens of Joe Sullivan, portrayed by Dennis O'Keefe. After escaping prison with the help of his loyal girlfriend and a scheming femme fatale (played respectively by Claire Trevor and Marsha Hunt), Sullivan's journey is fraught with danger and betrayal in this fascinating take on the genre. Mann's timless direction, aided greatly by the unmatchable cinematography of John Alton, elevates the story beyond a simple tale of escape to a nuanced examination of skittish loyalty, of dubious love, of ultimate desperation. The film's visual style, marked by its assured use of shadows and light, mirrors the internal conflicts of its characters, creating a moody atmosphere that is both captivating and evocative.\n\nHere is where you can stream Raw Deal.\n\n15. Fallen Angel (1945)\n\nThe enigmatic allure of Fallen Angel lies in its exploration of deception, desire and the dark underbelly of small-town America. Film noir superstar Dana Andrews delivers a compelling performance as Eric Stanton, a drifter whose quest for easy wealth leads him into the complex lives of two women in a small California town. The film's examination of moral ambiguity is enriched by its atmospheric setting and shadow-laden cinematography, capturing the ever-present tension between appearance and reality. Preminger's direction and the nuanced performances by the cast, especially the enigmatic performances from Linda Darnell and Alice Faye, elevate Fallen Angel beyond a simple crime drama to a poignant study on the duality of human nature. The movie's critical acclaim is well-deserved, spotlighting Preminger's skill in navigating the dark waters of film noir.\n\nHere is where you can stream Fallen Angel.\n\n14. Lured (1947)\n\nSet against the backdrop of London's foggy streets, Lured follows Lucille Ball’s character Sandra Carpenter as she dives into the city's underworld to unmask a serial killer. Ball's acting transformation from comedy to drama/thriller is seamless and inspiring, showcasing her depth and versatility in ways that surprised critics and the general public. Director Douglas Sirk, known for his later melodramas, injects this noir with a unique blend of suspense and elegance, creating a riveting thriller that's also a visual feast. The film's blend of mystery, romance and drama, along with standout performances by George Sanders and Charles Coburn, makes Lured a distinctive and engaging entry in the film noir genre. Its acclaim rests on its ability to entertain and intrigue, proving that noir can cross boundaries to capture a wide array of human experiences typically showcased by more traditional dramas.\n\nHere is where you can stream Lured.\n\n13. Kiss Me Deadly (1955)\n\nKiss Me Deadly is a quintessential noir thriller that dives headfirst into the paranoia and existential angst of the Cold War era. Ralph Meeker's portrayal of Mike Hammer is both brutal and charismatic, embodying the anti-hero at the heart of many noir narratives, while Robert Aldrich's direction ensures the film's place in noir lore, with a narrative that's as explosive as its climax. The film's complex plot, involving a mysterious box that everyone seems willing to kill for, serves as a metaphor for the era's nuclear fears. Aldrich's ever-innovative direction, coupled with the film's edgy script (which ruffled some feathers back in the day) and striking cinematography, makes Kiss Me Deadly a landmark in the genre. It is celebrated for pushing the boundaries of film noir into new, more nihilistic territory, blending traditional detective story elements with a pervasive sense of doom.\n\nHere is where you can stream Kiss Me Deadly.\n\n12. Night and the City (1950)\n\nHarry Fabian's desperate quest for greatness in the seedy world of London wrestling serves as the pulsating heart of Night and the City. Richard Widmark's performance as Harry Fabian, a small-time hustler with grand dreams, captures the essence of noir's doomed protagonist who’s only true ending could be the death of the self. The film's stark black-and-white cinematography and Jules Dassin's direction skillfully highlight the shadowy realms of the city and the moral ambiguity of its inhabitants. Night and the City is a critical triumph for its intense narrative drive and its unflinching examination of the lengths to which a man will go to achieve his aspirations. Dassin's work stands as a testament to the power of film noir to explore the darker facets of ambition and the human condition.\n\nHere is where you can stream Night and the City.\n\n11. They Made Me a Fugitive (1947)\n\nAlberto Cavalcanti's They Made Me a Fugitive thrusts viewers into a grim post-war British landscape, where Trevor Howard's Clem Morgan, a disillusioned ex-RAF pilot, becomes ensnared in a criminal underworld that leads to his wrongful conviction. Cavalcanti weaves a tale of betrayal and revenge with a distinctly British flavor of noir, blending stark realism with a pervasive sense of fatalism. Howard's portrayal of Morgan's descent and quest for redemption is both compelling and nuanced, offering a stark examination of post-war disillusionment and the search for justice in an unjust world. The film's critical success is attributed to its gritty atmosphere, complex characterizations and Cavalcanti's skillful direction, which together create a riveting narrative that stands out in the film noir genre.\n\nHere is where you can stream They Made Me a Fugitive.\n\n10. He Ran All the Way (1951)\n\nHe Ran All the Way is a gripping tale of fear and desperation, marking the exceptional John Garfield's final screen performance as Nick Robey, a petty criminal whose attempt to escape the consequences of a botched robbery leads to a hostage situation fraught with tension. The film is notable for its intense character study and the palpable sense of dread that permeates the narrative, all of which can clearly be found in modern home invasion thrillers. Directed by John Berry, He Ran All the Way explores themes of alienation and redemption with a raw emotional power, with Garfield's sympathetic and harrowing performance offering a poignant reflection on the human capacity for both violence and vulnerability. The film's critical acclaim rests on its compelling performances, tight pacing and its ability to encapsulate the existential angst at the heart of film noir.\n\nHere is where you can stream He Ran All the Way.\n\n9. The Naked Kiss (1964)\n\nA stark departure from conventional narratives, The Naked Kiss by Samuel Fuller is a film that begins with a jarring confrontation and never relents, constantly challenging and reinventing the tropes of the film noir genre. Constance Towers delivers a riveting, powerhouse performance as Kelly, a woman with a tumultuous past who seeks a fresh start in a new town, only to find herself in the middle of its darkest secrets. Fuller’s storytelling choices employ striking visuals to peel back layers of social hypocrisy, challenging us to question the true nature of redemption. This film's critical acclaim stems from its unflinching look at difficult subjects, such as domestic turmoil and sexual abuse, making The Naked Kiss an enduring piece of provocation.\n\nHere is where you can stream The Naked Kiss.\n\n8. Double Indemnity (1944)\n\nDouble Indemnity unfolds with the precision of a chess game, where Fred MacMurray's insurance salesman Walter Neff gets caught in a deadly scheme of lust and murder alongside Barbara Stanwyck's unforgettable femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. The film's narrative is a tightrope walk of suspense and moral questions, crafted with razor-sharp dialogue co-written by Wilder and famous noir novelist Raymond Chandler. Wilder's direction creates a palpable tension that envelops the viewer, making Double Indemnity not just a film about murder, but a profound exploration of the darker aspects of human nature. Its legacy is cemented by its innovative storytelling, iconic performances and its profound influence on the noir genre, making it a timeless classic that’s continued to shape how modern movies approach complicated characters.\n\nHere is where you can stream Double Indemnity.\n\n7. On Dangerous Ground (1951)\n\nNicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground diverges from the urban jungle that populates so many film noirs to the snow-covered countryside, offering a tale of redemption through its troubled protagonist, Jim Wilson. Robert Ryan's portrayal of this violent yet vulnerable city detective finds unexpected salvation in the character of Mary Malden, a blind woman portrayed with sensitivity by the incomparable Ida Lupino. Ray's film explores the transformative power of human connection with an emotional depth that, rarely seen in the noir landscape, is pointedly empathetic and delicate. The stark contrast between the corrupt city and the cleansing snowscapes serves as a backdrop to Wilson's internal journey from despair to hope. On Dangerous Ground is revered for its lyrical approach to noir, blending suspense with a deeply humanistic touch.\n\nHere is where you can stream On Dangerous Ground.\n\n6. Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950)\n\nWhere the Sidewalk Ends is a classically gritty story that delves into the life of Detective Mark Dixon, a role imbued with complexity by Dana Andrews. Dixon's struggle with his own violent impulses and his quest for redemption after accidentally killing a suspect weave a tense tapestry of noir themes. Director Otto Preminger crafts a noir that is as much about the shadows within us as the ones that fall across our darkened city streets. To be expected, Gene Tierney adds a rich layer of depth to the proceedings, rekindling the chemistry she shared with Andrews in Preminger’s other successful noir, Laura. Where the Sidewalk Ends is celebrated for its atmospheric direction, psychological depth and the moral complexities it navigates, making it a pivotal film in the noir canon and a testament to Preminger's mastery of the genre.\n\nHere is where you can stream Where the Sidewalk Ends.\n\n5. Leave Her to Heaven (1945)\n\nLeave Her to Heaven is a visually stunning noir that distinguishes itself with lush Technicolor cinematography, exploring the obsessive love of Ellen Berent, played by Gene Tierney, in a performance that is both beguiling and terrifying. Directed by John M. Stahl, the film is a melodramatic departure from the genre’s typical shadowy aesthetic, and offers perhaps noir’s greatest character study. As sick and sadistic and unforgiving as Ellen seems to be, she is ultimately misunderstood — and, thus, cast aside. Everyone sits around waiting for Ellen to pull herself together. She has to come around eventually… right? But she never does. And she punishes the world for it. Tierney's portrayal of this tortured figure whose desire for control leads to destruction is both nuanced and chilling. Leave Her to Heaven is celebrated for its unique blend of noir elements with a visually rich palette, making it a groundbreaking and unforgettable entry in the genre.\n\nHere is where you can stream Leave Her to Heaven.\n\n4. Ivy (1947)\n\nA fascinating and under-appreciated entry in the film noir genre, Ivy centers around Ivy Lexton, a woman in Victorian England whose exterior charm and grace hide a manipulative and murderous ambition. Venturing outside her typical dramatic roles during Hollywood’s Golden Age, Joan Fontaine's ruthless performance is a masterclass of duplicity as she climbs the alluring social ladder by ensnaring men with her wiles, leaving death and destruction in her wake. Ivy stands out for its uncommon period setting, which adds a layer of opulence to the typical noir narrative of greed and moral uncertainty. The film's lush settings and costumes contrast sharply with its barbaric themes, creating a unique visual and thematic blend that enriches the genre. This movie might be hard to find, but it’s worth a watch for Fontaine’s riveting performance alone — as well as it’s cold look at the monstrosity required to channel from within in order to achieve a superficial sense of social superiority.\n\nHere is where you can stream Ivy.\n\n3. The Big Combo (1955)\n\nThe Big Combo showcases just how deceivingly optimistic film noirs can be. Seemingly, with their dark and grisly demeanors, noirs scream defeatedness — American society is a mess, lawlessness runs amok and powerful politics are out of control. But by going so far in the “negative” direction, film noirs had an immense opportunity to highlight the solution to such disorder. In The Big Combo, Police Lieutenant Leonard Diamond, played arduously and affectionately Cornel Wilde, is obsessed with taking down the ruthless gangster Mr. Brown, who constantly gets away with murder and pushes Diamond to the edge of sanity, the edge of morality. Brown, played devilishly by Richard Conte in one of the best villain roles ever, teases Diamond and questions his manhood, forcing our protagonist to question his way of life and what’s important. But defeating Brown — defeating hate and evil — requires Diamond to look inward, to love himself and embrace the people around him. Every enrapturing character dynamic extracted from director Joseph H. Lewis, every beautifully lit shot from cinematographer John Alton, every emotional crossroads faced by the impeccable cast is efficiently mapped out and masterfully conveyed — it’s a high point for film noir.\n\nHere is where you can stream The Big Combo.\n\n2. Sunset Boulevard (1950)\n\nBilly Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, a film that would go on to influence so many dark Hollywood tales such as Mulholland Drive and The Player, remains an indelible critique of Los Angeles, weaving a tale of fame, delusion and despair with unparalleled wit and insight. Gloria Swanson's performance as the forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond is iconic (her famous final words, “All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up,” still haunt us to this day), capturing the tragic descent into madness with a blend of vulnerability and grandeur. William Holden, as the down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis, delivers a nuanced portrayal of a man caught in Desmond's delusional web, providing a grounded counterpoint to her delusion. Wilder's direction and his sharp, acerbic script dissect the illusions of fame and the price of oblivion with a precision that makes the film as haunting today as it was upon its release. Its legacy as a critical and cultural touchstone of American cinema is undisputed, offering a stark, enduring vision of the allure and dangers of Hollywood's golden age.\n\nHere is where you can stream Sunset Boulevard.\n\n1. Laura (1944)\n\nWhat stands today as one of the greatest and most haunting mystery movies ever, Otto Preminger’s Laura is a masterpiece of intrigue and romance, enveloped in the shadowy, impenetrable ambiance of film noir and headed by two of the most significant genre specialists, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney. The film unfolds around the murder of a successful advertising executive named Laura Hunt (Tierney) and the subsequent investigation led by Detective Mark McPherson (Andrews), who becomes increasingly obsessed with the victim. Preminger designs a narrative that is at once a compelling detective story and a profound exploration of overwhelming obsession and spellbinding love. The hauntingly beautiful score by David Raksin and the elegant cinematography from Joseph LaShelle contribute to film’s unmatchable atmosphere of longing and mystery. Everything about Laura, from its sophisticated storytelling to its colorful cast of characters (especially Clifton Webb’s delightfully flashy performance) to its constant narrative teasing, make it a timeless classic in the noir genre and a pivotal film in Preminger's career.\n\nHere is where you can stream Laura.\n\nAs a bonus, here is an “honorable mention” list on an extra 25 notable film noirs that are also worth checking out.\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle (1950)\n\nThe Big Heat (1953)\n\nThe Big Sleep (1946)\n\nBlind Alley (1939)\n\nGilda (1946)\n\nHangover Square (1945)\n\nThe Hitch-Hiker (1953)\n\nHouse on Telegraph Hill (1951)\n\nI Wouldn’t Be In Your Shoes (1948)\n\nThe Killing (1956)\n\nThe Lady from Shanghai (1947)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nMildred Pierce (1945)\n\nMinistry of Fear (1944)\n\nOdd Man Out (1947)\n\nOut of the Fog (1941)\n\nOut of the Past (1947)\n\nPanic in the Streets (1950)\n\nPickup on South Street (1953)\n\nThe Red House (1947)\n\nThe Set-Up (1949)\n\nScarlet Street (1945)\n\nSweet Smell of Success (1957)\n\nThey Live By Night (1948)\n\nWhite Heat (1949)\n\nBottom Line\n\nHere you have a great deep dive into the film noir genre. Both newcomers and lifelong fans will find both classic and hidden-gem picks that showcase the depth of this timeless saga of filmmaking that would go on to influence many modern crime thrillers and mystery movies."
