        "text": "\"I think one can really be at peace with the lord without removing themselves from the world. After all, it was created for us.\"\n\nLogistics of war and the human costs surrounding them. Firstly, in revisiting this film after a few years I hoped I would have more concrete, articulate thoughts about it - as that old cliche goes, one is supposedly more impulsive and emotional when they are younger. Yet, my response seeing this as a 26 year old in 2017 was almost identical as it was to seeing it as a 20 year old in 2011. Different episodes (1 particularly) do nothing for me, while some hit me in ways never before (4), but even if there were…\n\nFor his follow-up to the neorealist masterpiece Rome, Open City, Rossellini trades in intimacy for scope with Paisan; a film that examines the importance of communication, connection and commitment during wartime. Told through six vignettes, with each penned by a different screenwriter (including a young Fellini), what we have here are essentially moral tales set against the backdrop of the allied invasion of Italy. Each vignette takes place in a different city, from when the Americans first land, to the Winter prior to the conclusion of WWII, and tell varying tales of struggles with lingual or culture barriers, moments of realization and courage, and the atrocities of war. Barring a few flubs in the editing room, the film is a…\n\n“Paisà.” A corrupted word from the Italian-American “paesano,” roughly translated as “buddy,” “countryman,” or “neighbor,” often used by American soldiers during the war as a friendly way of greeting their Italian comrades.\n\nThe word underscores the entire philosophical tenor and humanist soul of Rossellini’s avant-garde masterpiece, a defining film of the neorealist movement that is much closer to traditional definitions of neorealism than his previous work. Nonprofessional actors, authentic locations, and documentary newsreel techniques are all in full force, with less melodrama, less narrative, and less convention at the helm.\n\nThere is nothing original about Rossellini relying upon these elements, as they were also used during the fascist period, but the degree to which he moves away from traditional, Hollywood-style…\n\nIf ever there was a stark vision of wartime Italy and a transforming nation, this could be it. As a piece of dramatic history, Roberto Rossellini's Paisà is entirely compelling.\n\nMade in six parts, the film delivers its messages among scenes of the allied invasion into the Italian heartland in a way that largely focuses on the human reaction rather than the 'muck and bullets' of war. Focus, determination, fear, loss and most of all, hope.\n\nThe start of the film sets the scene for what is to come. US troops arrive in a Sicilian village, searching for German soldiers. Local girl Carmela leads the boys north... The clouds darken. The soundtrack turns sombre. The lighting shifts to highlight the…\n\nBazin said this film's individual unit was not the \"shot\" but the \"fact,\" and if PAISAN's sketches indulge in types and ordered mini-narratives, it is Rossellini's open but nevertheless controlled aestheticization and his minute, compartmentalized vignettes depict realism as it should be. Rossellini excels at setting up a social backdrop but working resolutely through an intimate focus that digs into characters in means that stretch beyond social conditions. If De Sica's films, for example, are directly a product of the surrounding rubble and poverty, Rossellini's themes in PAISAN—miscommunication, perspective, loneliness—stretch so far outside the military and socioeconomic context that at times it is the characters who seem to birth the stark ruin around them, a collapsed Tower of Babel.\n\nRossellini's…\n\nIf Rossellini’s first entry in his ‘war trilogy’ encompassed the emotional flaying of one city by conflict, its sequel, “Paisan,” depicts the devastation it wrought across an entire country.\n\nCities have souls. Countries have nationalism. And that is where the cores of “Rome, Open City” and “Paisan” diverge.\n\nPart one, “Rome, Open City,” had a concentrated focus on a small group of anti-fascist revolutionaries. Their anger and losses were personal and palpable, even though their stakes were small.\n\nIts ‘sequel,’ “Paisan,” is a six-segment anthology film that tracks the allied liberation of Italy from south to north. Characters do not overlap between the stories, but the theme is consistent:\n\nThere are gaps in language and communication, but they are nothing…\n\nFilmed in the ruins of post-war Italy, Paisan is a vital neorealist portrait of a country in chaos. Across six stories, it starts with the Allied invasion of Sicily and then moves up the Italian Peninsula, following liberation through the eyes of ordinary people. Paisan is a collage of a country, centered on a series of friendships between Italians and Allied soldiers. It is a film of human understanding, about crossing the language barrier to find hope and kindness. In the very first story a woman and a foreign soldier are able to find a peace with nothing but a few words. At times Paisan is harsh, filled with impoverished people and the suffering of civilians in wartime. Bloodied bodies…"
