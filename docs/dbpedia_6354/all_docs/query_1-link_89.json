        "text": "In the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood (1910sâ1960s), directors turned California into a cinematic wonderland. While today's movie shoots often occur in far-flung locations, American directors in the early days took advantage of their backyard, using Californiaâs variety of terrains to work as stand-ins for global destinations. While many locations have faded away, some are still visibleâand accessible. (Angels Flight, for instance, a classic film noir location, also appeared in 2016âs La La Land.) Some areas even play up a locationâs famous past, with museums and guided tours.\n\nThese classic movie locations only scratch the surface of Californiaâs film appearances. Want even more cinematic magic? Take a Movie Locations Road Trip, go on a Lost Boys tour in Santa Cruz, or learn how movies are made on the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nHere, listed north to south, are some of Californiaâs most recognizable cinematic time capsules, and the stories behind them.\n\nBodega Bay, The Birds\n\nThe coastal Sonoma County villages of Bodega and Bodega Bay exude a sense of moody isolationâand thatâs part of the reason Alfred Hitchcock chose them as a backdrop for 1963âs The Birds. In Bodega you can still see the two-story Potter Schoolhouse, where the birds first menaced the townâs children. To go inside a location, book a table at The Tides Wharf Restaurant at The Inn at the Tides to enjoy the Dungeness crab and views over the waterâfeaturing happy (and non-homicidal) shorebirds.\n\nFort Point, Vertigo\n\nIn the 1850s, Fort Point in San Francisco was an integral part of the Pacific defense. While the fort never saw any real military action, it has seen some drama: Kim Novakâs character Madeline attempted suicide here in the 1958 Hitchcock classic Vertigo. Tours at the fort focus more on its history with candlelit tours and cannon-loading demonstrations. To recreate other parts of the film, stroll through the cemetery at Mission Dolores, or stay at the Hotel Vertigo (called the Empire in the movie), where Vertigo plays endlessly on the lobby ceiling.\n\nSpreckels, East of Eden\n\nThe tiny town of Spreckels was the location for 1955âs East of Eden, based on John Steinbeckâs tragic tale of sibling rivalry set in Salinas Valley. The Spreckels Sugar Factory, seen in the opening frames, is still operational today and many early-20th-century homes dot the townâs Historic District. In nearby Salinas, you can tour the National Steinbeck Center, which showcases letters and equipment that inspired East of Eden, as well as other Steinbeck books-turned-films, such as The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men.\n\nBig Bear Lake, Kissinâ Cousins\n\nThe San Bernardino Mountains and valleys around Big Bear Lake frequently stood in for various mountain ranges in early films, such as 1936âs The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, 1941âs The Shepherd of the Hills, and Elvis Presleyâs 1964 Kissinâ Cousinsâall stories of family feuds and moonshine. The sawmill featured in the Presley film is still standing, and you can see it at the Cedar Lake Camp, which was part of the areaâs âback lot,â and is now rented out to groups.\n\nGriffith Observatory, La La Land and Rebel Without a Cause\n\nCompleted in 1935, the Griffith Observatory is almost as iconic as the Hollywood sign. For today's movie fans, the Observatory may be recognized as where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone waltzing under a star-filled ceiling in La La Land. The Observatory also served as a location for 1955âs Rebel Without a Cause, when James Deanâs character tries to impress his classmates in the planetarium, only to get caught up in a knife fight. In real life, before his death at age 24, Dean commissioned a bust of himself, which is now on prominent display near the Observatory lawn.\n\nAngels Flight, film noir\n\nIn 1901, Angels Flight was built on Los Angelesâ Bunker Hill to ferry locals up the steep incline. During the â40s and â50s, the neighborhood and its funicular became a familiar sight in noir films like The Turning Point (1952), M (1951), and Kiss Me Deadly (1955). The recently restored Angelâs Flight is open to ride and provides a great start to a noir walking tour. Get a guided tour from the Los Angeles Conservancy or go it alone, stopping at the Bradbury Building (1950âs D.O.A.) and City Hall (1945âs Mildred Pierce and 1946âs The Blue Dahlia).\n\nPioneertown, westerns\n\nIf Pioneertown reminds you of an Old West cowboy flick, your memory serves you well. Back in 1946, Gene Autry and Roy Rogers (plus other investors), created this frontier town-style movie set near Joshua Tree National Park. Visit today and you can still see the camera-ready faÃ§ades resembling saloons, jailhouses, and stables. Browse the shops before grabbing a cold one at Pappy & Harrietâs. Once a cantina set for movies, Pappyâs is now a quirky music venue and restaurant/bar, attracting big-name acts as well as local bands.\n\nVenice Beach, Touch of Evil\n\nVenice Beach first opened in 1905, paying homage to its Italian namesake with a Grand Canal, bridges, piers, an amphitheater, and a mini railroad. By the late 1950s, the Los Angeles neighborhood had turned rough from civic neglect, prompting Orson Welles to cast it as a seedy border town in Touch of Evil. Visit the colonnade, where the movieâs famous opening sequence was shot. For a deeper dive, book a Venice in the Movies Walking Tour. Or, get a birdâs-eye view of the area (and perhaps a blood-orange julep) from the High Rooftop Lounge.\n\nPalm Springs, various films\n\nPalm Springs has a reputation as Hollywoodâs getawayâbut the city and its signature mid-century modern architecture have also served as a location for a number of films. For example, The Damned Donât Cry was famously shot at Frank Sinatraâs Twin Palms Estate. Visit the home through a city tour during Februaryâs Modernism Week, or rent the place for a few thousand clams a night. You can more easily access another local film site: the Riviera Palm Springs, which served as the hotel in 1963âs Palm Springs Weekend.\n\nHotel Del Coronado, Some Like It Hot"
