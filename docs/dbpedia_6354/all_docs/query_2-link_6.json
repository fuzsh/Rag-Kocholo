        "text": "Made in the aftermath of the Second World War, Paisà is constructed as a series of six encounters which take place during the liberation of Italy as Allied troops advance through the country from Sicily to the northern Po Valley, via Rome and Florence.\n\nShot on location using a non-professional cast alongside actors, the semi-documentary aesthetic and epic sweep of Paisà is both both charming and devastating in its portrayal of the final days of war and the confusion that follows in its wake. Paisà forms the second part of Rossellini’s acclaimed War Trilogy and is a classic of neo-realist cinema.\n\nFeatures\n\nCinema in the rubble: movies made in the ruins of postwar Germany\n\nBy Matthew Thrift\n\nCinema in the rubble: movies made in the ruins of postwar Germany\n\nLists\n\nTop up your watchlist... 31 classics of Italian cinema\n\nTop up your watchlist... 31 classics of Italian cinema\n\n10 great\n\n10 great films of 1946\n\nBy David Parkinson, Christina Newland and others\n\n10 great films of 1946"
