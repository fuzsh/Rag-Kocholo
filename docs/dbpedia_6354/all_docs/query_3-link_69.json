        "text": "Paisan (Italian: Paisà)\n\n) is a 1946 Italian film directed by Roberto Rossellini, the second of a trilogy by Rossellini. It is divided into six episodes. They are set in the Italian Campaign during World War II when Nazi Germany was losing the war against the Allies. A major theme is communication problems due to language barriers.\n\nThe film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) and the BAFTA Award for Best Film from any source. It was the most popular Italian film at the box office in 1945-46, finishing ahead of Mario Mattoli’s melodrama Life Begins Anew.\n\nPlot\n\n1st Episode\n\nDuring the Allied invasion of Sicily, a small American reconnaissance patrol makes its way to a Sicilian village at night. Only one of the Americans speaks Italian. Local Carmela (Carmela Sazio) agrees to guide them past a German minefield. They take shelter in the ruins of a seaside castle.\n\nWhile the others take a look around, Joe (Robert Van Loon) is assigned to keep an eye on Carmela. Despite the language barrier, Joe starts to overcome her indifference. However, he is shot by a German sniper. Before the Germans reach the castle, Carmela hides Joe in the basement. When the Germans send her for water, she sneaks back and checks on Joe, only to find him dead. She takes his rifle and starts shooting at the enemy. The Germans throw her off a cliff to her death and leave. When the Americans return, they find Joe’s body and assume Carmela killed him.\n\n2nd Episode\n\nThe Allies invade mainland Italy and capture the port of Naples. An orphaned street urchin named Pasquale (Alfonsino Pasca) happens upon Joe (Dots Johnson), an embittered, somewhat drunk African-American soldier. When Joe falls asleep, Pasquale takes his boots. The next day, Joe, a military policeman, nabs Pasquale in the act of stealing supplies from a truck. Joe demands his boots back, but when the boy takes him to where he lives, the sight of the squalor causes Joe to leave without them.\n\n3rd Episode\n\nFred (Gar Moore) is one of the soldiers who helps liberate Rome. During a rest stop, he gets out of his tank and persuades city resident Francesca (Maria Michi) to let him wash up in her apartment. In the little time they spend together, they are attracted to each other, and Fred promises to return.\n\nSix months later, Fred is back in Rome, where he is taken by a street prostitute back to her place. He wants nothing to do with her; instead he tells her how he futilely searched for Francesca, not recognizing her as the prostitute. When he falls asleep, Francesca slips out, asks the building manager to give her home address to Fred when he wakes up. However, she waits in vain; the now-cynical Fred, who thinks the address given him is of a whorehouse, throws away the piece of paper away and heads back to his unit.\n\n4th Episode\n\nThe southern half of Florence is freed, but fierce fighting continues across the river in the other half between Italian partisans and the Germans and their die-hard fascist supporters. All the bridges other than the Ponte Vecchio have been blown up, stalling the Allied advance. American nurse Harriet (Harriet Medin) is frantic to get across and be reunited with a painter.\n\nShe learns that he is now “Lupo”, the leader of the partisans. She and partisan Massimo (Renzo Avanzo), a man desperate for news of his family, risk their lives and find a way across. However, Harriet is devastated to learn that Lupo has been killed.\n\n5th Episode\n\nThree American chaplains are welcomed to stay the night at a newly liberated Roman Catholic monastery. However, the monks are later dismayed to find that only Captain Bill Martin (William Tubbs) is a Catholic; his friends are a Protestant and a Jew. When they sit down to supper, Martin learns that the monks have decided to fast in hopes of gaining the favor of Heaven to convert the other two.\n\n6th Episode\n\nIn December 1944, three members of the OSS are operating behind German lines with Italian partisans. They rescue two downed British airmen, but run out of ammunition during a battle with the enemy and are captured. The partisans are summarily executed the next day, as they are not protected by the Geneva Conventions; two of the outraged prisoners of war are shot when they try to interfere."
