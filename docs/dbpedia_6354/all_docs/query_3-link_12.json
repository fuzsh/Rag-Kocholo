        "text": "IN the immediate aftermath of World War II, Roberto Rossellini made three films that helped to lay the foundations of modern cinema: “Rome Open City” (1945), “Paisan” (1946) and “Germany Year Zero” (1948). It’s almost impossible to underestimate the importance of these movies, both for the impact that their startling realism had on the audiences and filmmakers of the time and for the influence they continue to exert on directors.\n\nAndrea Arnold’s current “Fish Tank” is only the latest example of work that continues to draw on Rossellini’s open, observational approach, which mixed location filming with studio sets, professional actors with amateurs asked to play variations on themselves, and screenplays that were not set in stone, Hollywood style, but roughed out in advance and improvised on the spot. Whenever we see a film by François Truffaut (“The 400 Blows” was directly inspired by “Germany Year Zero”), John Cassavetes or Mike Leigh, we are in some sense experiencing Rossellini’s vision, his determination to cast aside refinements of form and style and penetrate to the heart of his human material, captured on the fly with all of its rawness and complexity intact.\n\nYet for decades now it’s been impossible to see Rossellini’s War Trilogy, as the films have come to be called, in any kind of decent condition. All we’ve had are ugly dupes, made from damaged, dirty prints many generations removed from the original negatives, and in the case of “Germany Year Zero,” with the actors dubbed into a language not their own.\n\nWhich is why I’m feeling particularly grateful to the Criterion Collection for its newest release. The three-disc “Roberto Rossellini’s War Trilogy” uses photochemical and digital techniques to reclaim these masterworks, removing speckles and scratches (more than 265,000 individual fixes were hand-applied to “Paisan” alone) and vastly improving definition and contrast. “Germany Year Zero” has been refitted with its original German-language dialogue (though the disc includes the opening of the Italian-dubbed version as well, with its different introduction), and the soundtracks of all three films have been scrubbed of pops and hisses.\n\nWisely, there has been no attempt to make these films look pristine. Many flaws are still apparent (as they probably were in the original release prints), and the graininess of the image has been maintained. This is all very much in the spirit of Rossellini, who felt that technical perfection was a minor virtue compared to the warmth and spontaneity that could be captured once technique was thrown away.\n\nAt the beginning he may have had little choice. Although his first three films  all propaganda features made with the support of the Fascist regime  find Rossellini experimenting with location shooting and nonprofessional actors, his manner doesn’t really emerge until “Rome Open City,” filmed in the chaos and desperation of a Rome recently liberated by Allied forces. Using bits of scrounged film stock, a studio improvised on the ground floor of a bordello and electricity diverted from the nearby offices of Stars and Stripes, the United States military’s newspaper, Rossellini and his colleagues pieced together a story of the Italian resistance under the Nazi occupation.\n\nIt is difficult to underestimate the effect “Rome Open City” had when it arrived in 1946 in New York, where it struck initial audiences with the impact of a documentary. Italian audiences knew better, if only because they could recognize the popular comedian Aldo Fabrizi playing the priest who aids the Communist underground forces, and the music-hall star Anna Magnani, who plays Pina, the pregnant widow  and the embodiment of Roman grit  caught up in the conflict. But its impact was that of a raw slice of reality, something that had seldom been seen in the movies since the general retreat from the streets to the studio in the late 1910s.\n\n“Paisan,” a more complex and ambitious film, tells the story of the Allied campaign in Italy through six separate episodes, beginning in the south with the landings in Sicily and ending with a last-ditch conflict between German troops and Italian partisans, aided by American O.S.S. agents, in the swampy delta of the northern Po River. Rossellini often expressed an aversion to form, but somehow “Paisan” (with its battery of writers, including Sergio Amidei, Klaus Mann and Federico Fellini) acquired an elaborate network of interrelations among the episodes  thematic parallels (difficulties of communication, across languages and cultures), spatial relations (the zigzag route of the Allied campaign is echoed in the jagged itineraries of characters crossing different war zones) and dramatic devices. (Most of the episodes end with characters embracing or rejecting their ties to the grand mass of humanity that swirls around them.)\n\n“Germany Year Zero” pushes further northward, to Berlin, where Rossellini discovers a city even more devastated than Rome, and filled with far more desperate people. As difficult as it must have been at the time the film was shot, Rossellini strains to observe the German people with fairness and compassion. His protagonist, a 12-year-old boy (Edmund Meschke, a nonprofessional Rossellini recruited from a family of circus performers), is both a symbol of the Reich (he would have been born in 1934, the year Hitler assumed his title as Führer) and a victim of it. He shares his home, a cramped apartment with no electricity, with his invalid father, an older brother who fought to the last for the Führer, and a sister who is slipping into prostitution in order to bring home some money.\n\nWhen a former teacher suggests to Edmund that his family might be better off without his “socially useless” ailing father, the boy dutifully takes this backdated bit of Nazi ideology to heart and poisons the old man. In the film’s extraordinary final sequence the child wanders the streets, the camera following him closely as he sometimes seems to sink under his burden of guilt, sometimes to be as unconcerned as any boy on a sunny afternoon. He climbs into a decimated building, and after toying with a bit of broken pipe as if it were a gun, and scooting down a collapsed girder as if it were a playground slide, he turns and impassively walks off an open ledge, tumbling into the void.\n\nRossellini dedicated “Germany Year Zero” to his young son Romano, who had died of a ruptured appendix before the shooting began. The act of identifying his own innocent son with the adolescent killer of “Germany Year Zero” suggests extraordinary moral courage on Rossellini’s part, an ability to see a common humanity in the most disparate figures, to find sorrow where so many others had only, and understandably, found horror and disgust.\n\nBeginning with his next film, “Stromboli” (1950), Rossellini would move more deeply into the Roman Catholic theology that underlay his beliefs, exploring notions of compassion, commitment and acceptance of the world in its awful and glorious contradictions. But that is a subject for another day, and, one hopes, for a future installment in Criterion’s Rossellini collection. (Criterion Collection, $79.95, not rated)\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nMICHAEL JACKSON’S THIS IS IT Kenny Ortega directed this documentary edited from the more than 100 hours of rehearsal footage shot for Jackson’s planned series of concerts in London. “At once a greatest-hits compendium and a suggestive glance at what might have been,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times in October, the movie is “a rushed and ragged monument to the man, his work and the commercial interests of those he left behind.” (Sony, Blu-ray $39.95, standard definition $28.96, PG)\n\nWHIP IT Drew Barrymore directed this coming-of-age story about a small-town teenager (Ellen Page of “Juno”) in Texas who discovers her true self as a feisty member of a women’s roller derby team filled with underachieving misfits. The film “has an easygoing spirit, a lightness of touch in spite of occasional excursions into melodrama, that makes it hard to mock and easy to like,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times in October. With Marcia Gay Harden, Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig. (Fox, Blu-ray $39.99, standard definition $29.98, PG-13)\n\nBRIGHT STAR Jane Campion’s costume drama recounts the romance between the poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish). Though there are times when Mr. Whishaw’s performance “trembles on the edge of caricature,” Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in September, “these moments, rather than feeling studied or obvious, arrive with startling keenness and disarming beauty, much in the way that Keats’s own lyrics do.” (Sony, $27.96, PG)\n\nPARIS, TEXAS Wim Wenders’s fanciful 1984 vision of the American Southwest, written by Sam Shepard, stars Harry Dean Stanton as a man who tries to reclaim his memories and his wife (Nastassja Kinski) after four years of wandering. It “begins so beautifully and so laconically that when, about three-quarters of the way through, it begins to talk more and say less, the great temptation is to yell at it to shut up,” Vincent Canby wrote in The Times in 1984. “If it were a hitchhiker, you’d stop the car and tell it to get out.” (Criterion Collection, Blu-ray and standard definition, $39.95, R)\n\nWORLD WAR II IN HD Gary Sinise narrates this History Channel documentary series that draws on rare color footage of the war newly transferred to high-definition video. (A&E Home Video, Blu-ray $39.95, standard definition $29.95, not rated)"
