We were students during\n\nthe same period, me doing undergraduate work and he doing graduate. I\n\nnever took a class from him but simply listened to him and learned,\n\nprobably more than I learned from most of my official classes. That\n\nwas a difficult period in film studies in that there was a strong\n\nresistance to not only auteurism but to the very concept of pleasure\n\nin cinema. Roger's application to the doctoral program at NYU was\n\ninitially rejected by the faculty since he was perceived to be a\n\nlightweight. This objection came primarily from the department\n\nchair, who did not approve of auteurism and whose own Intro to Film\n\ncourse regularly began with a screening of Flashdance -- which he\n\nthen got up and denounced. (That kind of teaching.) Roger did get\n\nin, though, on his second application. The only class they allowed\n\nhim to teach was one on violence in fifties American cinema: Oswald,\n\nBoetticher, Fuller, Mann. After that, he adjuncted at various places,\n\nending up in Florida, before he died. At any rate, my enthusiasm for\n\nRossellini was one that I largely developed through Roger. But I\n\ncan't help recalling now my initial access to Rossellini, a year\n\nbefore I entered NYU. On television one night in Ohio, a station\n\nprogrammed Stromboli (the English-language version) followed by the\n\nEnglish-language version of Elena et les hommes, Paris Does Strange\n\nThings. Maybe Langlois was their guest programmer.\n\nBy the way, Bill, if you're still reading this I had dinner with\n\nHoward Mandelbaum the other night (speaking of Roger!). Since Howard\n\nis the biggest Dwan fan I know of I mentioned the Dwan essay you\n\nwrote for senses. Now he's very excited and wants to read it. (He\n\nweeps during Dwan films and I'm not always sure why. Anyway, he\n\nloaned me his video of The Gorilla.) But he asked me if the Dwan\n\nessay was about capitalism. When I looked puzzled he said, \"When I\n\nknew Bill Krohn he used to say that Dwan's films were all about\n\ncapitalism.\" Is this true?\n\n>\n\n> So all that seems to have combined to give you access and\n\ninformation\n\n> that the Sarris Generation as such didn't really have, although\n\n> Rossellini's most intelligent champions in NY included members of\n\nthat\n\n> generation - Marty, Roger - and stretched back to Jonas Mekas, who\n\nhad\n\n> Little Flowers on the loop at Anthology. So, no, he wasn't burried,\n\nbut\n\n> I don't think Sarris did a lot to help the cause. (I'm sure Gary\n\n> Sherman's students out here got an earful, too - he named his son\n\n> Cosimo.) On the other hand, I don't recall Sarris championing the\n\ntv\n\n> movies when they were playing, although he includes and italicizes\n\n> Prise de pouvoir in the very brief RR item in The American Cinema.\n\n>\n\n> Anyone else like Rossellini?\n\n27302\n\nFrom: David Ehrenstein\n\nDate: Wed May 18, 2005 11:13pm\n\nSubject: Re: Re: Viva Rossellini!
