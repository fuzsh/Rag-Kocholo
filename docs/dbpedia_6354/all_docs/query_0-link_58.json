This document provides an introduction to the book \"The Historical Film: History and Memory in Media\" which contains essays examining how film and television portray history. The introduction outlines the goals of the book, which are to identify changing theoretical perspectives on how history is portrayed in media and to establish methods for evaluating popular portrayals of history. It also summarizes some of the key debates around historical representation, such as whether we have reached the \"end of history\" or if alternative perspectives deserve examination. The essays in the book analyze issues like cultural politics involved in portraying the past and developing responsible methodologies for analyzing historical films and television.",
