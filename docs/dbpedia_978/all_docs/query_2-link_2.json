        "text": "In the song 'We Wish You A Merry Christmas'... are the lyrics 'good tidings we bring to you and your king' or 'kin'? It's a hotly debated subject in my family and I wondered what you guys had been singing all these years. The elderly and teenagers tend to say 'king' and the middle-aged say 'kin'... personally I say king...\n\nThis has just popped up in a very widely known survey, so it seems OK to bring this back to life. In short, the vast majority of us will only ever learn it in primary school. Due to the comparative sounds, it will only take a tiny proportion adding the \"g\" for kids to hear it as King. The net effect is that those learning it by sound are far more likely to respond with king. Those learning it with paper printouts and clearer dictation more likely to respond with kin. Both frankly sound close enough that if you find yourself arguing the point and dwelling on it too heavily, perhaps you should be finding something more meaningful to do with your life"
