        "text": "Eugene Byrne, our man at your front door demanding figgy pudding, has teamed up with Bristol University Library’s Special Collections archive, to try and trace the story.\n\nWe wish you a merry Christmas\n\nWe wish you a merry Christmas\n\nWe wish you a merry Christmas\n\nAnd a happy new year\n\nGlad tidings we bring\n\nTo you and your kin\n\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\n\nAnd a Happy New Year!\n\nMost of us imagine that the famous song is about as old as they come. It was probably something that originated in the Middle Ages, and which was first written down in Tudor or Stuart times, right?\n\nWrong. Old it may be, but the oldest documented arrangement of the song that we know of was only written in 1935 by Bristol choirmaster Arthur Sydney Warrell.\n\nHe’s not the author of the song. It’s thought to have been a traditional West Country tune, possibly from Somerset. Its origins remain obscure; one reference book speculates that it originated in Tudor times, but no-one knows for sure.\n\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s there was a craze for “collecting” folk songs; music enthusiasts travelled the country, visiting villages and homing in on the oldest inhabitants to coax them to sing the songs they had learned at their mothers’ knees.\n\nNone of the published collections appears to have anything resembling ‘We Wish You a Merry Christmas’ in any recognisable form.\n\nSo until anyone can provide an earlier score, every proud Bristolian should claim the credit for Arthur Warrell, Bristol University’s director of music and organist at Clifton Parish Church, because he got there first.\n\nArthur Sydney Warrell was born at Farmborough near Bath in 1882. His later education was at the Merchant Venturers Technical College in Bristol and he went on to become assistant organist at Bristol Cathedral. He was later appointed organist at Clifton Parish Church (St Andrews, damaged in the Blitz and later demolished; the famous Birdcage Walk goes through its cemetery.)\n\nIn 1909 Warrell was appointed Lecturer in Music at Bristol University and would spend the next 30 years at the heart of the cultural life of the University and of the wider city.\n\nHe founded the University Choir in 1925 – this was all-male; a separate women’s choir followed in 1930. He also started the University’s orchestra and the University Madrigal Singers. He played the organ at numerous churches, conducted the Bristol Royal Orpheus Glee Society and in later years made a number of broadcasts on the BBC Radio from Clifton.\n\nAt the University he directed an endless round of concerts, most of them featuring music by some of the leading composers of the day, including Ralph Vaughan Williams (a particular hero of his), Peter Warlock, Herbert Howells and others. Many big names came to Bristol in person to conduct at his behest.\n\nWarrell was a composer in his own right, but his real love seems to have been in writing arrangements of existing tunes.\n\nAs everyone took their seats for the Christmas concert at the University Great Hall on the evening of Friday December 6 1935, most would probably have been looking forward to the end of term and going home to spend Christmas with their families. The concert, by the University of Bristol Madrigal Singers, would probably have marked the start of the festive season for many.\n\nThey were treated to a resolutely “modern” event; the programme mostly featured carols and choral works by British composers. William Walton’s carol ‘Make we Joy now in this Fest’ shared the bill with a “vigorous and boldly harmonised” setting of an old Swedish carol, ‘On this day, Earth shall ring’, arranged by Haldane Campbell Stewart, who was as well known as a cricketer as a composer.\n\nOne of the highlights of the evening, though, must have been Warrell’s arrangement for unaccompanied voices of ‘A Merry Christmas’. Though it wasn’t quite as we know it now. In Warrell’s version it was “I” wish you a merry Christmas, not “we”.\n\nIt was certainly performed again by the Madrigal Singers. A review in the University’s ‘Nonesuch’ magazine of the 1938 Christmas Concert says its “encore being an appropriate end to the concert.”\n\nWe don’t know where Warrell got the song from. Perhaps even in the 1930s carollers were singing it on people’s doorsteps, or maybe it was something he remembered from his rural Somerset childhood.\n\nBut his arrangement certainly spread its popularity. It was performed by the BBC Chorus on the radio in December 1940 and through the war years and beyond you can find reviews of Christmas concerts in papers from all over the country attesting to its popularity. Some of these make it clear that the song was previously unknown outside the west country.\n\nThe score was published by the Oxford University Press in 1935 and Warrell seems to have been granted copyright in 1939.\n\nAlas, he would have seen little benefit from it. By then he was in poor health, and died in his sleep at his home at 12 St Matthews Road, Cotham on August 12 1939. He was survived by his wife Daisy.\n\nObituaries of Warrell were fulsome in praising his energetic work around the local music scene. Some spoke of how as a teacher he was not prepared to put up with any sloppiness or nonsense, but that he was always informal and funny. An appreciation in Nonesuch magazine said: “If he ever made a slip, a resounding cheer would be heard (though before the noise had died down he had general managed to think of the perfect reply; and after a performance of … ‘Old Mother Hubbard’ an astonished audience saw him presented with an enormous bone.”\n\nOthers spoke of his sense of humour – apparently he had a loud and infectious laugh - and the warmth of his personality.\n\n“He was one of those rare men in whose presence it felt a shameful thing to be petty and small-minded; so large was the generosity of his heart, and so overwhelming his enthusiasm for the best.”\n\nAnd until someone can come up with a score of the song from before 1935, Bristol can claim that one of the most famous Christmas tunes of them all was first written down here.\n\nTo hear a scratchy early recording of Warrell’s arrangement, see https://tinyurl.com/yb4cdrkg and go to one minute 57 seconds in.\n\nThe Bristol Post is very grateful to Bristol University Library’s Special Collections staff, particularly Ian Coates, for their help with this article.\n\nWhat is figgy pudding anyway?\n\n‘A Merry Christmas’ probably originated as a “wassailing song”, something to be sung by people going around the neighbourhood during the Christmas season. Different places had different traditions, so sometimes these well-wishers would be mummers, sometimes just the local children, sometimes both. They would sing at the doors of houses and be rewarded with fruit, food and/or beer or wine (yes, even the children.)\n\nThere are several variants on the words, but the gist is pretty clear: Happy Christmas, now make with the vittles. As in:\n\nNow bring us some figgy pudding (repeat x3)\n\nAnd bring some out here\n\nFor we all like figgy pudding,\n\nWe all like figgy pudding,\n\nFor we all like figgy pudding,\n\nSo bring some out here\n\n“Figgy pudding” was a catch-all term for any sort of boiled pudding involving fruit, whether the traditional “plum pudding” or one made with dried fruit.\n\nFigs, dates, raisins and currants had long since been imported from warmer climes and as early as the 17 century puddings made with dried fruit were popular with all classes. “Figgy dowdy,” for instance, was a favourite treat for sailors in Nelson’s navy and ships’ cooks probably used whatever fruit was to hand, whether actual figs or not.\n\nBy the 1840s, liberalised tariff laws and growing prosperity meant that all but the very poorest could afford it more often. By then, currants appear to have been the most favoured ingredient.\n\nIf you were to serve a modern Christmas pudding to a Victorian they’d like as not tell you it was “figgy pudding”. They might add that figgy pudding, figgy dowdy or plum pudding were popular all year round. The idea that boiled fruit puddings were specifically for Christmas didn’t catch on until the later 1800s. As with so many seasonal traditions, “Christmas pudding” isn’t as old as we might think.\n\nBy the way: that business about the good tidings we bring to you and your king makes a lot more sense if you assume that originally it was “kin” and not “king”. The song seems to have been completely secular, and the use of “king” might have been an attempt to put a religious spin on it.\n\nOther Christmas tunes with Bristol connections\n\nIn Dulci Jubilo\n\nA long-time seasonal favourite, famously recorded by Mike Oldfield in 1975 and a mainstay of carol services. The original was a medieval Christmas song from Europe but which was translated into English by J.M. Neale as ‘Good Christian Men, Rejoice’. The better-known version was written by Bristol composer, Robert Lucas Pearsall (1795-1856). Pearsall was from a wealthy local family and became a lawyer but in 1825 he sold the family home at Willsbridge and went to live in a ruined castle in Switzerland. He was one of the founders of the Bristol Madrigal Society and a keen amateur composer. After he moved to Switzerland he regularly sent them compositions to perform. He published ‘In Dulci Jubilo’ in 1836 and presented a copy to the Madrigal Society who have been proud to include it in their repertoire ever since.\n\nAs with Gladness Men of Old\n\nAs with gladness, men of old/Did the guiding star behold/As with joy they hailed its light/Leading onward, beaming bright … etc.\n\nThe words were written in 1858 by William Chatterton Dix (1837-1898), who was born and brought up in Bristol but spent most of his working life running an insurance company in Glasgow. A devout Anglican, he publishing over 40 hymns; he died in Cheddar in 1898 and is buried at Cheddar parish church. His words to ‘As with Gladness …’ were set to music by German composer Conrad Kocher. Dix disliked the tune intensely.\n\nHark! The Herald Angels Sing\n\nHark! The herald angels sing/\"Glory to the new-born King/Peace on earth, and mercy mild/God and sinners reconciled!”\n\nThis is one of the 9,000-plus hymns and poems written by Charles Wesley, who lived in Bristol for some time. The words were first published by Felix Farley in Bristol in 1749 and were supposedly inspired by the sound of bells as Wesley was walking to church one Christmas morning. The version sung nowadays was set to a score by German composer Felix Mendelssohn by organist William Cummings in the 1850s. Mendelssohn’s tune had originally been written to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the invention of the printing press, and he had stated firmly that it should not be used for religious purposes."
