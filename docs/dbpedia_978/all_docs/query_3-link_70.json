        "text": "Dudley Gerald Sparks passed away on July 26th at the age of 93 years. Much loved husband of 71 years to Shirley (Seney) Sparks. Dudley attended Blenheim High School. He was a past member of Merlin Kinsmen, Past Noble Grand of Merlin 100F Lodge, a member of the Charing Cross United Church and a long time member of Merlin Legion where he enjoyed the Dart and Euchre Leagues. He was an avid hunter and enjoyed his hunting trips to Northern Ontario with his hunting buddies. He was a Blue Jays and Leafs fan. Dudley was a member of The Boosum Beauties where as “Darling, Debbie”, he played first base for the team to raise funds for charities. He loved to tease everyone, especially his grandchildren. Dudley was the son of the late Burvil and Viola (English) Sparks. He is survived by his daughters, Lori (Bill) Thompson and Lisa Sparks, his grandchildren, Aaron (Nadia), Lauren (Chris), Adam, Kendra (Jake), Shannon (Matt), Lisa-Ray (Anthony) and Dakota (Ryan). He was Poppy to his great-grandchildren, Koen, William, Marlee, Maddox, Miles, Luca, Maverick, Nora, Layla-Rae and Beatrix. Also survived by daughter-in-law Janice Vince and son-in-law Paul Deneve, his sister Audrey (Orville) and in-laws Diana (Jim), Jim (Late Nancy), Bev (Lynda) and many nieces and nephews. Predeceased parent to his son Danny, great grandson Andrew and his in-laws Alena and Harry Seney. Dudley was a well known builder and Craftsman who built many beautiful homes in Chatham-Kent with his father Burvil, later with his son Danny and friend Cyril. Dudley had a lot of one liners… “Keep your stick on the ice and the puck toward the net”. Or when saying goodbye, he would say “Be good. If you can’t be good, be careful. If you can’t be careful, don’t name it after me.” We will all miss him and his wonderful sense of humor. He was an amazing, talented man.\n\nGoodbye my love.\n\nVisitation for Dudley will take place at the Blenheim Community Funeral Home on Sunday August 11, 2024 from 2:00 – 5:00 p.m. A Celebration of his life will take place at the Merlin Legion on September 29, 2024 from 2:00 – 5:00 p.m.\n\nNettie Apthorp of Blenheim passed away surrounded by the love of her family at the Chatham-Kent Health Alliance on Monday July 29, 2024. Born in Fargo 83 years ago to the late Mildred & William Tye, she married the love of her life Dan Apthorp on April 4, 1964 and began a journey that would span over 60 years. Together they raised three children; Mike Apthorp (Lisa), Lori Jones (Ron) and Jason Apthorp (Rachel). Their blessings grew with the addition of three grandchildren Megan, Cassie (Cameron) and Ronni Jones. Nettie will be missed by her sisters Dona Holling (Bill) and Joyce Clark (John), her sister-in-law Mary Lou Tye (late Jim) and by her chosen daughter Heather. She will also be missed by Ken Apthorp, Wendy Apthorp and many nieces and nephews.\n\nNettie was a kind and wonderful lady who was cherished and loved by all. She will be remembered fondly by all her family and friends for her gift of hospitality, always sending cards or just checking in with a phone call to let you know he had been thinking about you. She was a lady who put others before herself.\n\nNettie could be found frequently sharing in her ministry by serving, not only with her church family, but also the community. You would typically find her in the church kitchen, helping to prepare meals or luncheons for a variety of different functions. As well, you could find her at home in her own kitchen preparing pies, cookies or even simple chocolates for Christmas. Nettie was a lady who loved to bake and share with all. If she wasn’t found in the kitchen at church, you could always find her in the lobby, welcoming all her church friends and family on Sunday mornings.\n\nNettie’s love for young children was evident through the many years she spent teaching Sunday School and caring for infants in the nursery. She also took care of children in her own home for various families throughout Blenheim. If she wasn’t at home or church, you could find Nettie at the Blenheim Community Senior Center doing whatever was needed of her.\n\nIf you had the chance to know Nettie, you would have understood that her life was fulfilled by serving her friends and family, just as Jesus Christ had shown her through his own examples during his time here on earth.\n\nVisitation will be held at the Blenheim Community Funeral Home on Thursday from 2 – 4 & 6 – 8 p.m. A funeral service for Nettie will be held in Glad Tidings Community Church on Friday August 2, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. (visitation will take place from 10 – 11 a.m.) Interment in Evergreen Cemetery. Friends wishing to remember Nettie with a memorial donation are asked to consider Glad Tidings Community Church.\n\nIt is with great sadness we announce the very sudden and tragic passing of Jessica Stoehr.\n\nLoving mother of Elena Stoehr-Yeo. Loving sister of Melissa Stoehr and Jordan Zimmerman. Loving aunt of Ryker Stoehr. Loving daughter of the late Tawnya Stoehr-Stevens. Granddaughter of Albert and Joanne Brown, the late Wayne Stoehr and Debra Stoehr. Loving niece of Trina Hrdlicka, Scott Brown, Brian and Tammy Brown aw well as many other distant aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nJessica passed away suddenly in a motor vehicle accident in Valley View, Alberta, just months after her thirtieth birthday. Jessica always had the biggest, most contagious smile on her face! She was an amazing mother and friend. Jessica also loved her daughter more than anything in this world! No matter what Jessica was going through or faced, Elena was always the first thought in her mind and she loved her unconditionally. Jessica also loved her kitty cats and they always brought her comfort when she was sad.\n\nJessica loved being anywhere near the beach or any running water as it brought her peace and tranquility. She was also an avid gamer and could be found playing video games in her free time, as well as spending time with friends and family. Jessica spent the last seven years living in Alberta, but was born in London, Ontario. We all know Jessica as being a very loving but stubborn lady who always had your back and could definitely make you laugh.\n\nCremation has taken place. Jessica’s family will be hosting a Celebration of Life in the very near future which will be posted on Facebook through her sisters, with interment to follow at a later date.\n\nIf friends would like to make a donation in Jessica Stoehr’s memory, a Go Fund Me account has been created and is located on the go fund me website under her name.\n\nMay she rest in the sweetest peace.\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Joyce Ellen Bliss at Brantford General Hospital on June 29, 2024.\n\nJoyce is predeceased by her husband of 65 years, Elwyn Bliss.\n\nAlso mourning is her family:\n\nMother to: Jeff (Marg), Eric (Kandace) and Sharon (Kim)\n\nGrandmother to: Drew, Erica (Mike), Karla (Stu), Dan (Alexandra) and Bianca (Shawn).\n\nGreat Grandmother to: Atticus, Estelle, Charlotte and Lily.\n\nSister to Anne (the late Bob) and Sister-in-law to Corienne (the late Gary) and Connie (the late Galen).\n\nPredeceased by Brothers: Gerald (the late Priscilla), Donald (the late Eileen), Lester (the late Judy), Graydon (Wendy).\n\nJoyce’s loving and determined attitude will be greatly missed by innumerable brother and sister in laws, nieces, nephews, relatives and friends.\n\nOver 100 kids had the privilege to call Joyce “Mommy Bliss” and spent their preschool and after school hours with her. Many kids learned to count by helping her count the cups of flour going into the bread or bun recipe.\n\nJoyce was very active in the Blenheim United Church for many years. She also co- ordinated and organized the Christmas Basket Program for the Blenheim Ministerial Association for 23 years.\n\nOur family is grateful for the support received from friends and family during this time. We are also very thankful for the care that our mother received at the Brantford Hospital, especially from the nursing staff on the 7th floor palliative care unit.\n\nA celebration of Joyce’s life will be held at the Blenheim Community Funeral Home on Monday July 29, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Following the interment in Evergreen Cemetery, a reception will be held at the Blenheim Legion.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Blenheim Ministerial Association Christmas Basket Program or the Hatley Cemetery Association c/o Dorinne McIntyre, 1035 Ch Descente-Cass, Ayers Cliff, Quebec J0B 1C0 or to a charity of your choice.\n\nIt is with profound sadness that the Houweling family announces the passing of their mother Johanna Houweling who passed away at the Blenheim Community Village on Wednesday June 26, 2024 at the age of 88.
