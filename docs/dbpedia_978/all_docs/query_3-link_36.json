        "text": "Most of these are older tunes. They were written during the transition from the Renaissance to the Baroque (several centuries). Many have melodies written before the ideas behind minor and major keys were codified. They tend to sound a bit (or a lot) like they were written analogously to Chant and other earlier pieces. Some come from folk-song traditions that do not conform to modern major and minor keys either.\n\n\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" can be analyzed as either Dorian or (depending on which theorist one is using) Aeolian. It conforms more to a modal (in a general sense) or pre-tonal style of harmony. Many of Bach's chorals are based on Cruger's and other composers' works; Bach harmonized them in either modal or harmonic styles. Later composers also wrote in a modalish style in order to sound archaic.\n\nI think what people hear is attempts to sound \"different\" or \"Christmas-like\" by using modal melodies.\n\nAlso, minor vs major isn't as strong an indicator as sad vs happy as is popularly though. (Modal pieces seem to sound minor if not too deeply analyzed, also.) Quick example, \"Faded Love\" by Bob Wills sounds rather sad though it's a 3-chord major harmony."
