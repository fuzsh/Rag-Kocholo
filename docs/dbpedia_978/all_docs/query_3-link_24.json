        "text": "Christmas will come early this year to the Shawnee Playhouse, with the comedy revue “Christmas Musical Memories of the 1950s” set to open Friday.\n\nRod Foote — a New York City native and 60-year resident of Rome, New York — penned the show with some input from his wife of nearly 46 years, Janet, a native of Nanticoke who was an “Air Force brat” in her youth.\n\n“I wrote the script for this show, although she would throw in a suggestion now and then, which is basically how we work-one writes, the other critiques,” Foote said. “Then, after the fight, we go out to dinner.”\n\nThe playwright, whose parents served during World War II, came to Rome in late 1955 as a young airman in the U.S. Air Force. He first met his wife in Mississippi “when she was 13 and I was 18, when I chased her and her bratty friends off the airman's outdoor basketball court,” Foote said. The couple has acted together in a number of productions. His first show was “Life with Father” at age 8.\n\nAfter working for 32 years as a Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controller, Foote retired in 1988. During that time, “I developed my writing skills on midnight shifts between the lulls of traffic,” he said. “It was many years later that my wife and I started our own theater company that the writing bug came back to me. Since that time in 1978, I have written over 50 produced scripts for our company, The Chatham Theatre Company, plus several comedy shows that we produced for special functions.”\n\nChristmas meets the '50s\n\nFoote conceived the two-act “Christmas Musical Memories...” in January 2016, following the completion of his previous Christmas show, “The Hap-hap-happiest Season.” He finished writing the former, the last show he had written before the Footes retired from an active 37-year producing career, in September of that year.\n\n“The owner of the venue where we had been producing asked for something such as a 1950s memory show for a mostly senior audience,” Foote said. “Being a senior — I'm 80, my wife is 75 — a lot of the research, both events and music of the time, was already in my head. Easy peasy, an easy write.”\n\n“The first act is built specifically around the '50s,” he continued, “taking place in a soda shop with both Christmas and popular tunes of that era, and bringing to life through projections and monologues ‘the way we were.’ The four characters take on many personas, not in an imitative way but rather through the sense of the characters. The second act changes from a '50s soda shop to a contemporary home, and features traditional Christmas songs in various styles of performance, ranging from island calypso to a cast addition of little kids being both naughty and nice to very reverent renditions of well-loved carols.”\n\nAs it turned out, Foote added, “we never got to produce this show due to a whole litany of circumstances that befell the cast during the rehearsal period two weeks prior to opening — broken bones, major illness, knee replacement. It seemed like a daily something or other that we couldn't sustain, forcing us to cancel the show.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Shawnee Playhouse's Midge McClosky, a longtime friend of the Footes, asked if they had a Christmas show she could produce for the 2017 season.\n\n“I had already written a couple of earlier shows for Shawnee,” Foote said. “All's well that ends well.”\n\nGiven Foote's interest in history from the 1800s on, “Christmas Musical Memories...” fits snugly among the writer's repertoire of time-period pieces, which includes works like “A Roaring Good Time” and “Brother, Can You Spare a Song?” — set in the 1920s and 1930s, respectively — and “All This and World War, Too,” set in the 1940s.\n\n“Long before Google, and now, even with so much information available with the click of a mouse, I still find my primary source of genuine information to be the local library,” Foote said. “Making history interesting to a live audience is always a challenge and I've had good fortune so far.”\n\nAmong recent projects, Foote recently completed a three-act comedy “Many Happy Returns,” while Janet teaches “The Rising Stars” class for kids. In addition, twice a year, she writes, produces and directs a major main-stage production. “I lend a hand with sets and tech and music direction,” Foote noted. “Now being retired with nothing to do, I get to help. A lot.”\n\nBringing ‘Musical Memories’ to life\n\n“Christmas Musical Memories...” features four performers: Gabriella Simmons, Britte Steele, Joseph Ambrosia and Brandon Hanks. Ambrosia — a graduate of Lehigh Valley Charter High School for the Arts with a major in vocal performance — also serves as choreographer and co-director. He acknowledged the challenges in wearing three hats.\n\n“It's most difficult to give each job its rightful attention,” he said. “Directing the cast throughout the production process, setting material and also stepping onstage to perform that material, is a hard equation to get right. It wouldn't be possible without the help of this cast, and co-director/stage manager Shannon Felletter.”\n\nCurrently residing in his hometown of Stroudsburg, Ambrosia's interest in the arts “budded very young, as there was always music being listened to, played or sung in my home, and the theater bug bit me once I did my first middle school musical. Once diving into the community arts scene as a child, it's all history. I've since never stopped performing, directing and teaching professionally, both locally and nationally.”\n\nAmbrosia added that Shawnee Playhouse “is a second home. My first show, I was 14. Since, I have performed, directed, choreographed, taught, built and painted in this theater on over 15 projects. It's a special place, and holds such a huge part of my artistic development and fulfillment.”\n\nWith Christmas an important time for Ambrosia and his family, the artist was easily drawn to Shawnee's latest holiday show.\n\n“‘Christmas Musical Memories...’ pays homage to a simpler Christmas time,” Ambrosia said. “It celebrates the fellowship and camaraderie that I find this holiday to be losing with every year that passes. An opportunity to remind folks of the truest glad tidings with some singin' and dancin', I was sold.”\n\nAside from balancing multiple jobs, Ambrosia explained the show's other challenges. “Because it is in revue style, the performers have to adapt to many different styles of vocalizing, moving and performing. I'd say that is most challenging, to keep all those styles unique, different, but equally polished and refined.”\n\nIn addition, “when doing a show in revue style, the score utilizes songs not composed for the particular show. As designers, we take the playwright's text and try to adapt it around these popular tunes and give them a new connotation and intention. This can pose a challenge, but also an opportunity for artistic exploration and development.”\n\n‘Exaggerations of ourselves’\n\nEven though characters in “Christmas Musical Memories...” lack names — they're labeled as “Man 1,” “Woman 1,” etc. in the script — “they're exaggerations of ourselves,” said Hanks, who recently directed productions of “Annie Jr.” and \"Legally Gray” at Shawnee Playhouse. “For the most part, I'm playing myself — which is terrifying — but I also play/pay homage to various characters from the past. There's a nod to Elvis and some other comedy-sketch-type characters in the show. My character track seems to be more of the narrator/educator role.”\n\nHanks, who splits his time between Bushkill and Queens, New York, loves “singing classical Christmas carols like ‘Angels We Have Heard on High,’ ‘Gloria,’ ‘Oh Holy Night,’ etc. I don't really get to show that part of my voice, so it's always cool to revisit that style of music.”\n\nBack in August, Hanks — co-founder of Emerald Masks Productions and producing artistic director of Rebel Stages — served as director/choreographer of Emerald Masks' “Buddy! The Buddy Holly Story.” Since that time, “I decided to try to tackle this theatre thing all by myself,” he said. Among his goals with Rebel Stages: to nurture, support and embrace theater artists of all types and “rebel against the traditional and often stagnant box in the performing arts industries.”\n\nUpcoming Rebel Stages productions include: “Broadway on the Red Carpet 3,” a musical revue based on musicals-turned-movies and vice versa, set to open the first weekend in January at Notre Dame Elementary School; and “Romeo and Juliet,” a co-production with the Shawnee Playhouse, slated to open in February.\n\nStirring up nostalgia\n\nWith “Christmas Musical Memories...” playing through Dec. 23, viewers will have ample time to reflect on the '50s and Christmases past. Foote hopes theater goers experience “a pleasant feeling that will stir up some memories in the seniors and enjoyment in the ‘juniors’ about the way we were.”\n\nIf nothing else, Ambrosia hopes viewers “have a moment of authentic nostalgia. To hear one of these popular '50s tunes or Christmas songs and remember when they first heard them, who they were with, or what they were doing. This season is filled with precious moments, but only if you can separate from its hustle and bustle. We hope ‘Christmas Musical Memories...’ is one of those moments, this holiday.”\n\nHanks, who loves Christmas, referenced a classic holiday song to express his feelings. “Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year,” he said, laughing. “I just want everyone to get into the spirit. Have a blast and walk out smiling.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n“Christmas Musical Memories of the 1950s”\n\nWHEN: 2 p.m. Friday and Sunday, and 8 p.m. Saturday; additional dates through Dec. 23\n\nWHERE: Shawnee Playhouse, 552 River Road, Shawnee-on-Delaware\n\nCOST: $28 for adults, $25 for seniors and $15 for ages 17 and under\n\nINFORMATION: 570-421-5093, theshawneeplayhouse.com"
