        "text": "Close your eyes and listen for the bells. Imagine the snow falling softly in the cozy glow of evening. Expect the smell of evergreen. You've arrived at a place somewhere between your heart and soul: the world of Christmas songs.\n\nIf you've yet to discover the stories behind some of the Christmas standards you've been hearing -- and playing and singing -- your entire life, you're in for a treat. Some of the carols you will read about in this article are steeped in the mystery of medieval chants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers began as church sermons, prayers, or meditations. From famed classical composers to pop lyricists, from Broadway theater producers to simple pastors, the lyricists and composers included here are filled with the results of faith and talent -- rich musical gifts that have transcended centuries.\n\nTo help guide you though your own Christmas season, we've selected a holiday menu of favorites -- songs you never grow weary of hearing. Learn a bit about how these songs came to reach our ears as you peruse the included histories. We've also included lyrics to each of these Christmas songs and -- for you musicians out there -- sheet music that can be downloaded.\n\nAll told, we cover 35 Christmas songs in this article, including:\n\n\"Deck the Halls\" \"Deck the Halls\" -- one of the all-time Christmas favorites -- is a \"melting pot\" song. Its melody has traditional Welsh roots, but its lyrics came from the United States in the nineteenth century. You can't listen to this buoyant song without getting into the Christmas spirit. Learn about its history and reacquaint yourself with the lyrics.\n\n\"Good King Wenceslas\" \"Good King Wenceslas\" is a tribute to a beloved ruler whose kindness has never been forgotten. King Wenceslas (who was actually the Duke of Bohemia) was silenced by a jealous brother in 929, but centuries later, his memory surfaced as the subject of this children's song written by John Mason Neale.\n\n\"Christmas is Coming\" \"Christmas is Coming\" is a classic Christmas round. The author of the lyrics is unknown, but the music was composed by Edith Nesbitt in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.\n\n\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" was written sometime during the sixteenth century to honor the Christmas custom of giving 12 gifts to loved ones, one every day from Christmas to Epiphany. Whether singing of golden rings or fat geese, those unable to buy such luxuries could at least hold these lyrics as promises of heartfelt gifts to come during this glittering season of giving.\n\n\"Ave Maria\" Few sacred hymns are as universally known as \"Ave Maria.\" Originally a Roman Catholic prayer, \"Ave Maria\" was actually derived from biblical scripture: Luke 1:28. Franz Schubert orchestrated this version of the hymn in 1825. Many people consider \"Ave Maria\" to be the most sacred of all hymns.\n\n\"Here We Come A-Wassailing\" Also known as \"Here We Come A-Caroling\" and \"The Wassail Song,\" this jolly English ditty is steeped in tradition. Imagine a British cobblestone street, snow soft in the streetlight's glow. Despite constant hardship, beggars and orphans would dance and sing in the streets at Christmas, hoping to receive a bowl of wassail, which combines ale, wine, and spices to warm the heart as well as the soul.\n\n\"Jingle Bells\" Some songs are known for their appeal to adults; others for their popularity with children. \"Jingle Bells\" enchants both audiences, but it might surprise you to know that the original music, composed by Boston Sunday school teacher James Pierpont, was conceived as a Thanksgiving song in 1857.\n\n\"O Christmas Tree\" Folktales describing how evergreen trees came to symbolize Christmas can be found in nearly every culture. Centuries-old lore describes evergreen trees blooming in every forest on earth the night Jesus was born. These stories are the basis of the ageless German song that praises all trees at Yuletide: \"O Tannenbaum,\" or \"O Christmas Tree.\"\n\n\"The Holly and the Ivy\" \"The Holly and the Ivy\" likely originated as a print ad posted in England around 1700. The song was published in 1861 by Joshua Sylvester, who admitted to its commercial heritage. Though lavished with symbols predating Christianity, this song's lyrics don't completely explain the meaning behind the greenery in its title.\n\n\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky completed his ballet \"The Nutcracker\" in 1893. First performed at St. Petersburg's Maryinsky Theater the following Christmas, \"The Nutcracker\" continues to thrill audiences -- particularly those eagerly awaiting the ballet's crown jewel: \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.\" To read the story \"The Nutcracker,\" click here.\n\n\"Up on the Housetop\" When Clement Clarke Moore penned \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" as Christmas entertainment for his children, he probably had no idea that his story would continue to be told for hundreds of years. The charming tale of Santa's annual visit has been chronicled for all time as \"Up on the Housetop.\" If Moore hadn't revealed Santa's entry point and Benjamin Russell Hanby hadn't later set it to music, children everywhere might still wonder how all those Christmas presents are delivered!\n\n\"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\" This traditional American jingle sums up every child's Christmas dream -- finding out what treasured gifts Santa will be leaving under the tree this year. \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\" is a bouncy and fun-filled Christmas classic.\n\n\"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" got its lyrics from a poem by Edmund Hamilton Sears, a Unitarian minister. American poet Oliver Wendell Holmes described this hymn as \"one of the finest and most beautiful ever written.\" Listen to it, and you'll realize that Holmes was right.\n\n\"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\" \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\" is especially beloved by those who appreciate a literal interpretation of the nativity story. This hymn closely replicates the Bible's description of events on the night of Jesus' birth.\n\n\"Angels We Have Heard on High\" \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" began as a shepherd's exclamation (\"Gloria in excelsis Deo!\") shouted from hill to hill to celebrate Christmas. The version we sing today was first published in 1855.\n\n\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" Composer Felix Mendelssohn wrote the music for \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" for a cantata dedicated to Johannes Gutenberg. The tune was later matched with words written by Charles Wesley, a Methodist poet.\n\n\"We Three Kings of Orient Are\" \"We Three Kings of Orient Are\" was written in 1857 for an elaborate holiday pageant. It depicts the journeys of the three wise men who traveled from separate parts of the globe to pay homage at the crib of Jesus in Bethlehem.\n\n\"Angels from the Realms of Glory\" \"Angels from the Realms of Glory\" is a reverential carol by James Montgomery and Henry Stuart. It celebrates the angels who first told shepherds in their fields of the Messiah's birth. For those who want to really get into the Christmas spirit, it's well worth a listen.\n\n\"Coventry Carol\" It is speculated that \"Coventry Carol\" has its roots in melodies that women of Bethlehm would sing to their firstborn sons during King Herod's reign of terror, when he ordered the murder of all infant sons to ensure the death of newborn Jesus. As you can see from the subject matter, this Christmas song is known for its intensity.\n\n\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" Minister Phillips Brooks wrote \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" after traveling to Bethlehem and finding himself deeply moved by the experience. It was premiered by his church's children's choir in 1868 and developed into a Christmas classic in the ensuing years.\n\n\"Silent Night\" In 1818, a broken organ forced Father Joseph Mohr and organist Franz Gruber to pull together \"Silent Night\" for voices and guitars at the last minute. They barely finished in time for their Bavarian village's Christmas Eve celebrations. It's a good thing the song was completed -- \"Silent Night\" has enchanted generations of listeners. To read the inspirational story of how \"Silent Night\" came to be, click here.\n\n\"Away in a Manger\" \"Away in a Manger\" is of unknown origins, although many people have been considered possible composers (including Martin Luther and James R. Murray). While the mystery surrounding \"Away in a Manger\" continues, one thing is certain: This lullaby continues to soften hearts during the holidays.\n\n\"Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella\" \"Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella\" probably originated as a a lively court dance in fourteenth-century France. The song as we know it was first published in 1553 by a well-to-do nobleman. Read the lyrics, and you'll see that it's an interesting addition to our collection of Christmas songs.\n\n\"What Child Is This?\" \"What Child Is This?\" shares its melody with that of the traditional English song \"Greensleeves.\" Words from the Dix poem \"The Manger Throne\" were added to \"Greensleeves\" to form the Christmas carol we know today.\n\n\"Good Christian Men, Rejoice\" \"Good Christian Men, Rejoice\" originated as \"In Dulci Jubilo\" in 1601 and has undergone many transformations since then. The version we sing today was translated from German by Reverend Dr. John Mason Neale. The fact that the song has survived so many revisions speaks to its power and durability.\n\n\"O Holy Night\" This song was composed in France by Adolphe Charles Adam. Although \"O Holy Night\" was not initially well received by French church authorities, audiences have long loved this popular Christmas Eve solo.\n\n\"The First Noel\" This is a quintessential Christmas song. \"The First Noel\" most likely originated in thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Mystery Plays (dramatizations based on Bible stories) to tell the tale of Jesus' birth. The version we know was first published in 1833.\n\n\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" celebrates Jesus' promise of liberation for all people. The upbeat tempo reflects the power of that promise. This rousing spiritual became popular after a performance by Fish University's Jubilee Singers in 1879.\n\n\"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" The originally German \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" was written in 1905 and, once English lyrics were added by Ballard Macdonald, quickly became an American Christmas standard. But even if you listen to the American version of the song, you'll probably notice that it has German origins.\n\n\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" Almost everyone is familiar with this Christmas classic, which is a traditional caroling tune. Caroling groups in England, known as \"waits,\" often employed this tune in hopes of earning a sweet treat for themselves.\n\n\"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" This is another song that seemingly everyone knows. \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" (or \"Adeste Fideles,\" as it was originally known) was first published around 1751. About a century later, it became a popular church hymn when Frederick Oakeley translated it into English from Latin.\n\n\"Joy to the World\" Here's yet another Christmas standard. The lyrics to \"Joy to the World\" were first attributed to George Frideric Handel -- probably a ploy by the composer to increase the song's popularity. We now know, after much research from musicologists, that the words for this melody come from the Psalms of David.\n\n\"I Saw Three Ships\" The imagery represented in \"I Saw Three Ships\" is still puzzling to historians. Does it represent the Trinity? Columbus's voyage? Whatever the lyricist's intent, the song has been popular since its publication in 1666.\n\n\"God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen\" \"God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen\" was another favorite of the caroling groups, or \"waits,\" in seventeenth-century England. It was also used by Charles Dickens in his classic holiday story \"A Christmas Carol.\" To read \"A Christmas Carol,\" click here.\n\n\"Auld Lang Syne\" How can anyone ring in the New Year without a rousing round of \"Auld Lang Syne?\" This traditional song finds its roots in Scotland and was made popular by Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Deck the Halls'\n\nThe classic Christmas carol \"Deck the Halls\" is a true blending of international style. Its melody is steeped in Welsh tradition, but the lyrics were added in 19th-century America when the country was experiencing a wave of affinity for all things English -- especially Charles Dickens' colorful writings.\n\nThe following lyrics recall the home-crafted decorations of holly, boughs of evergreen, and Christmas florals that were strung from pillar to post inside England's vaulted estates. Though harkening back to days of British splendor, this song reminds us of our passion for lavishing our homes with colorful decorations to accent the Christmas season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Deck the Halls\" Lyrics\n\n1. Deck the halls with boughs of holly\n\nFa la ...\n\n'Tis the season to be jolly,\n\nFa la ...\n\nDon we now our gay apparel\n\nFa la ...\n\nTroll the ancient yuletide carol,\n\nFa la ...\n\n2. See the blazing yule before us,\n\nFa la...\n\nStrike the harp and join the chorus,\n\nFa la...\n\nFollow me in merry measure,\n\nFa la...\n\nWhile I tell of Christmas treasure.\n\nFa la...\n\n3. Fast away the old year passes,\n\nFa la...\n\nHail the new! Ye lads and lasses;\n\nFa la...\n\nSing we joyous all together,\n\nFa la...\n\nHeedless of the wind and weather.\n\nFa la...\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Deck the Halls\"\n\nOur next Christmas song memorializes a long-dead leader who was so well loved that we still sing about him. Read on to learn more about \"Good King Wenceslas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Good King Wenceslas'\n\nThough history is laden with wicked royalty, one titled ruler stands tall: King Wenceslas (who was actually the Duke of Bohemia). His kind heart was silenced by a jealous brother in 929, but, centuries later, his memory surfaced as the subject of a children's song written by John Mason Neale.\n\nTo add the perfect melody to his tribute, Neale picked an unlikely Latin tune: \"Tempus adest floridum\" or \"Spring has unwrapped her flowers,\" first published in a Swedish song collection in 1582. Its application to Neale's lyrics proved to be a remarkable tribute to a beloved ruler whose kindness has never been forgotten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Good King Wenceslas\" Lyrics\n\n1. Good King Wenceslas looked out,\n\nOn the feast of Stephen,\n\nWhen the snow lay round about,\n\nDeep and crisp and even.\n\nBrightly shone the moon that night,\n\nThough the frost was cruel,\n\nWhen a poor man came in sight,\n\nGath'ring winter fuel.\n\n2. \"Come now, page, and stand by me,\n\nI must hear thy telling,\n\nYonder peasant, who is he?\n\nWhere and what his dwelling?\"\n\n\"Sire he lives a good league hence,\n\nUnderneath the mountain,\n\nRight against the forest fence,\n\nBy Saint Agnes' Fountain.\"\n\n3. \"Bring me flesh and bring me wine,\n\nBring me pine logs hither,\n\nThou and I shall see him dine,\n\nWhen we bear them thither.\"\n\nTherefore Christian men, be sure,\n\nWealth or rank possessing,\n\nYe who now will bless the poor,\n\nShall yourselves find blessing.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Good King Wenceslas\"\n\nChildren and adults alike can join in our next song, a classic Christmas round. Keep reading to learn about \"Christmas is Coming.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Christmas Is Coming'\n\nEdith Nesbitt wrote the lyrics to this traditional Christmas round more than a century ago, and the song has been popular ever since. It reminds us that the Christmas season is one of charity and giving, a time to think of those less fortunate than ourselves.\n\n\"Christmas Is Coming\" Lyrics\n\n1. Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat;\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease to put a penny in the old man's hat,\n\nPlease to put a penny in the old man's hat.\n\n2.

From the grandest of lords to the poorest peasants, the tradition was celebrated with great enthusiasm.\n\n\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" was written sometime during the sixteenth century. Although predominantly about the tradition of giving extravagant gifts, this tune also glorified society's passion for \"counting songs.\" Whether singing of golden rings or fat geese, even those unable to buy such luxuries could hold these lyrics as promises of heartfelt gifts to come during this glittering season of giving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" Lyrics\n\n1.

Imagine a British cobblestone street; snow soft in the streetlight's glow.\n\nDespite constant hardship, beggars and orphans would dance and sing in the streets at Christmas, hoping to receive a pork pie, a penny, or some time in front of a blazing fire in return. However, the most prized pittance was a bowl of wassail -- which combines ale, wine, and spices -- to warm the heart as well as the soul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Here We Come A-Wassailing\" Lyrics\n\n1.

See the next page to learn more about \"Up on the \"Housetop.\"\n\n'Up on the Housetop'\n\nWhen Clement Clarke Moore penned \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" as a Christmas entertainment for his children, he probably had no idea that his story would continue to be told for hundreds of years. But thanks to its retelling and the fact that Ohio composer and lyricist Benjamin Russell Hanby decided to use it as the inspiration for his holiday tune, the charming tale of Santa's annual visit has been chronicled for all time as \"Up on the Housetop.\" If Moore hadn't revealed Santa's entry point and Hanby hadn't agreed, children everywhere might still wonder how all those Christmas presents are delivered!\n\n\"Up on the Housetop\" Lyrics\n\n1. Up on the housetop the reindeer pause,\n\nOut jumps good old Santa Claus.\n\nDown through the chimney with lots of toys,\n\nAll for children's Christmas joys.\n\nHo, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go!\n\nHo, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go!\n\nUp on the housetop, click, click, click,\n\nDown through the chimney with good Saint Nick.\n\n2. First comes the stocking of little Nell;\n\nOh, dear Santa, fill it well;\n\nGive her a dolly that laughs and cries,\n\nOne that can open and shut its eyes.\n\n3. Look in the stocking of little Bill;\n\nOh, just see that glorious fill!\n\nHere is a hammer and lots of tacks,\n\nWhistle and ball and a set of jacks.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Up on the Housetop\"\n\nOur next song is another Christmas classic about the man in the sleigh. On the following page, read about \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas.\"\n\n'Jolly Old Saint Nicholas'\n\nDoesn't every child dream of asking Santa Claus the following question: \"Which presents will be showing up under the Christmas tree this year?\" \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\" is a traditional American Christmas song that sets that desire to music.\n\n\"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\" Lyrics\n\nJolly old Saint Nicholas,\n\nLean your ear this way,\n\nDon't you tell a single soul\n\nWhat I'm going to say.\n\nChristmas Eve is coming soon,\n\nNow, you dear old man,\n\nWhisper what you'll bring to me,\n\nTell me if you can.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\"\n\nAmerican poet Oliver Wendell Holmes called our next hymn \"one of the finest and most beautiful ever written.\" Read about \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" on the following page.\n\n'It Came Upon a Midnight Clear'\n\nWhen Massachusetts Unitarian minister Edmund Hamilton Sears published his poem \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" in a church magazine, his anonymity came to a resounding end. The words he wrote were instantly deemed profound by readers, and then set to music by Richard Storrs Willis the following year.\n\nAn unlikely collaborator, Willis was an editor and music critic for the New York Tribune. Fortuitously, he had also received extensive musical training in Europe, and his work with Sears produced a hymn that was deemed \"one of the finest and most beautiful ever written,\" by American poet Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n\n\"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" Lyrics\n\n1. It came upon a midnight clear,\n\nThat glorious song of old,\n\nFrom angels bending near the earth,\n\nTo touch their harps of gold.\n\n\"Peace on the earth, good will to men,\n\nFrom Heaven's all gracious King.\"\n\nThe World in solemn stillness lay\n\nTo hear the angels sing\n\n2. Still through the cloven skies they come,\n\nWith peaceful wings unfurled,\n\nAnd still their heav'nly music floats\n\nO'er all the weary world.\n\nAbove its sad and lowly plains\n\nThey bend on hovering wing.\n\nAnd ever o'er its Babel sounds\n\nThe blessed angels sing.\n\n3. And ye beneath life's crushing load,\n\nWhose forms are bending low,\n\nWho toil along the climbing way\n\nWith painful steps and slow:\n\nLook now, for glad and golden hours\n\nCome swiftly on the wing;\n\nO rest beside the weary road,\n\nAnd hear the angels sing.\n\n4. For lo! the days are hastening on,\n\nBy prophet-bards foretold,\n\nWhen, with the ever-circling years,\n\nComes round the age of gold.\n\nWhen peace shall over all the earth\n\nIts ancient splendors fling,\n\nAnd the whole world give back the song\n\nWhich now the angels sing.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\"\n\nThe next song offers a literal version of the Biblical account of Jesus' birth. You'll find \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\" on the following page.\n\n'While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks'\n\nAdvocates of a \"literal interpretation\" of the nativity story in church liturgy and hymns greeted \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\" with enthusiasm. The reason was simple: The hymn closely replicates the Bible's description of events on the night of Jesus' birth.\n\nIt also helped that a distinguished group of musicians contributed to the hymn's creation. George Frideric Handel, composer of the famed oratorio Messiah, wrote the music. Years later, Richard Storrs Willis of \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" fame infused Handel's old melody with text adapted from an even older work published by Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brody in 1696. And the result is timeless.\n\n\"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\" Lyrics\n\n1. While shepherds watched their flocks by night,\n\nAll seated on the ground,\n\nThe angel of the Lord came down,\n\nAnd glory shone around,\n\nAnd glory shone around.\n\n2. \"Fear not\" said he, for mighty dread\n\nHad seized their troubled minds;\n\n\"Glad tidings of great joy I bring\n\nTo you and all mankind.\n\n3. \"To you, in David's town, this day\n\nIs born of David's line\n\nThe Saviour, who is Christ the Lord\n\nAnd this shall be the sign:\n\n4. \"The heav'nly babe you there shall find\n\nTo human view displayed,\n\nAll meanly wrapped in swathing bands,\n\nAnd in a manger laid.\n\n5. \"All glory be to God on high,\n\nAnd to the earth be peace;\n\nGood will henceforth from heav'n to men\n\nBegin and never cease!\"\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\"\n\nShepherds in southern France used to shout \"Gloria in excelsis Deo, Gloria in excelsis Deo!\" from hill to hill to celebrate the coming of Christmas. The song on the next page, \"Angels We Have Heard on High,\" is based on that jubilant cry.\n\n'Angels We Have Heard on High'\n\nFor many years, the hills of southern France were home to shepherds whose duties required their presence day and night, year-round. To celebrate the birth of Jesus, a custom evolved among the shepherds that can't be traced to an exact date. On Christmas Eve, these shepherds shouted \"Gloria in excelsis Deo, Gloria in excelsis Deo!\" from hill to hill, spreading the celebratory news.\n\nThere is speculation that this spirited chant originated in a medieval Latin chorale. Eighteenth-century music later fused words with melody to become the French carol \"Les Anges dans nos Campagnes.\" The version we sing today was first published in a collection of holiday carols in 1855.\n\n\"Angels We Have Heard on High\" Lyrics\n\n1. Angels we have heard on high,\n\nSweetly singing o'er the plains,\n\nAnd the mountains in reply,\n\nEchoing their joyous strains\n\nGloria, In excelsis Deo, Deo.\n\n2. Shepherds why this jubilee?\n\nWhy your joyous strains prolong?\n\nWhat the gladsome tidings be\n\nWhich inspire your heav'nly song?\n\nGloria ...\n\n3. Come to Bethlehem and see\n\nHim whose birth the angels sing;\n\nCome, adore on bended knee\n\nChrist the Lord, the newborn King.\n\nGloria ...\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Angels We Have Heard on High\"\n\nOur next song is a hymn with music originally composed by Felix Mendelssohn. To learn about \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,\" go to the following page.\n\n'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing'\n\nGifted composer Felix Mendelssohn wrote the spirited musical undercurrent that propels the hymn \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\" This melody was once part of a cantata that he had written in 1840 and dedicated to the inventor of the printing press, Johannes Gutenberg.\n\nIn 1855, W. H. Cummings became convinced that the music deserved lyrics. He matched Mendelssohn's melody with words that had been written by Charles Wesley in 1739. Despite extensive editing of the song's first line, this hymn bore the trademark phraseology of Wesley, the renowned Methodist poet.\n\n\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" Lyrics\n\n1. Hark! The herald angels sing\n\nGlory to the new born King\n\nPeace on earth and mercy mild,\n\nGod and sinners reconciled.\n\nJoyful all ye nations rise,\n\nJoin the triumph of the skies,\n\nWith angelic host proclaim\n\nChrist is born in Bethlehem!\n\nHark!

The Herald Angels Sing\"\n\nMelchior, Caspar, and Balthazar -- the three Biblical wise men -- were given new musical recognition with the song on our next page, \"We Three Kings of Orient Are.\"\n\n'We Three Kings of Orient Are'\n\nJohn Henry Hopkins, Jr., was instrumental in organizing an elaborate holiday pageant for the students of the General Theological Seminary in New York City in 1857. Hopkins, the seminary's music director, wrote and staged the pageant, which included his upbeat composition \"We Three Kings of Orient Are.\"\n\nThis piece depicts the journeys of the three wise men, who traveled from separate parts of the globe to pay homage at the crib of Jesus in Bethlehem. Hopkins' words and music elevated Melchior, Caspar, and Balthazar -- following a fabled star and carrying gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh -- to new musical heights.\n\n\"We Three Kings of Orient Are\" Lyrics\n\n1. We three Kings of Orient are\n\nBearing gifts we traverse afar.\n\nField and fountain, moor and mountain,\n\nFollowing yonder star.\n\nO, Star of wonder star of night,\n\nStar with royal beauty bright\n\nWestward leading, still proceeding\n\nGuide us to thy perfect light.\n\n2.

Learn about \"Angels From the Realms of Glory\" on the following page.\n\n'Angels From the Realms of Glory'\n\n\"Angels From the Realms of Glory,\" written in 1816 by James Montgomery, celebrates the messengers who first told shepherds of the birth of Jesus. This reverent carol recalls the angels' flight to earth to share their joy with all mankind.\n\n\"Angels From the Realms of Glory\" Lyrics\n\n1. Angels from the realms of glory\n\nWing your flight o'er all the earth.\n\nYe who sang creation's story\n\nNow proclaim Messiah's birth.\n\nCome and worship, come and worship,\n\nWorship Christ the newborn King.\n\n2.

Read about it on the next page.\n\n'Coventry Carol'\n\nIt would be difficult to find a hymn with roots that run deeper than \"Coventry Carol.\" The melody and lyrics are said to have originated in the songs that Bethlehem women would sing as they held their firstborn sons during King Herod's reign of terror (when he ordered the murder of all infant sons in order to ensure the death of the newborn \"King of the Jews\").\n\nThe melody later reemerged in Christmas pageants that were performed by the sheep shearers and tailors of Coventry, England, on the steps of the city's cathedral between 1534 and 1584. Today, \"Coventry Carol\" not only commemorates its sixteenth-century English roots, but also memorializes the innocent children who died due to King Herod's jealous proclamation.\n\n\"Coventry Carol\" Lyrics\n\n1. Lullay, thou little tiny child,\n\nBy, by, lully, lullay:\n\nLullay, thou little tiny child,\n\nBy, by, lully, lullay.\n\n2. O sisters, too, how may we do,\n\nFor to preserve this day?\n\nThis poor Youngling for whom we sing,\n\nBy, by, lully, lullay.\n\n3. Herod the king in his raging,\n\nCharged he hath this day\n\nHis men of might, in his own sight,\n\nAll children young to slay.\n\n4. Then woe is me, poor child for thee,\n\nAnd ever morn and day,\n\nFor thy parting nor say nor sing\n\nBy, by, lully, lullay.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Coventry Carol\"\n\nThe following carol was inspired by a minister's visit to the town of Bethlehem. Go to the next page to read more about \"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\"\n\n'O Little Town of Bethlehem'\n\nWhen Phillips Brooks, a well-known Philadelphia minister, traveled to the Holy Land in 1865, the experience so moved him that he returned home with new resolve to bring the story of Jesus' birth to his congregants. With memories of his trip \"still singing in his soul,\" Brooks wrote the words his heart felt as he walked the streets of Bethlehem.\n\nHe then turned to Sunday school teacher and part-time organist Lewis H. Redner to aid in the song's completion. This delicate hymn was premiered by the church's children's choir to a thrilled congregation in 1868.\n\n\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" Lyrics\n\n1. O Little Town of Bethlehem,\n\nHow still we see thee lie.\n\nAbove thy deep and dreamless sleep,\n\nThe silent stars go by.\n\nYet in thy dark street shineth\n\nThe everlasting light\n\nThe hope and fears of all the years\n\nAre met in thee tonight.\n\n2. For Christ is born of Mary,\n\nAnd gathered all above,\n\nWhile mortals sleep, the angels keep\n\nTheir watch of wondering love.\n\nO morning stars together\n\nProclaim the holy birth!\n\nAnd praises sing to God the King\n\nAnd peace to men on earth.\n\n3. How silently, how silently,\n\nThe wondrous gift is given!\n\nSo God imparts to human hearts\n\nThe blessings of His heaven.\n\nNo ear may hear His coming,\n\nBut in this world of sin,\n\nWhere meek souls will receive Him, still\n\nThe dear Christ enters in.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\"\n\n\"Silent Night\" is among the most beloved Christmas carols. But did you know it was hurriedly written at the last minute for a Bavarian village's Christmas Eve celebration? Learn more about \"Silent Night\" on the next page.\n\n'Silent Night'\n\nFather Joseph Mohr was in a quandary. Christmas Eve was only hours away, but his seasonal hymn was still incomplete due to a broken organ (some say mice were the cause of the damage). Father Mohr feared that if the tune was left unfinished, Christmas 1818 would forever be remembered as Oberdorf, Germany's, \"tuneless Yuletide.\" Happily, organist Franz Gruber rescued Mohr with a simple arrangement for voice and guitars.\n\nWhen the clocks struck midnight, the just-written \"Silent Night\" echoed across the Bavarian village. This simple, haunting carol traveled quickly from town to town, but it took 30 years for news of its popularity to reach its amazed composers.

Keep reading to learn more about \"Away in a Manger.\"\n\n'Away in a Manger'\n\nMartin Luther is rumored to have authored \"Away in a Manger,\" but the hymn more likely debuted anonymously around 1885. The song served as inspiration to James R. Murray, who included the hymn under the title of \"Luther's Cradle Hymn\" in his 1887 book \"Dainty Songs for Lads and Lassies.\" This is probably the reason for its attribution to the great German religious leader.\n\nGiven so circuitous an evolution, you won't be surprised to learn that some people think that Murray was the composer. Others are convinced that the lyric is derived from the Scottish poem, \"Flow Gently, Sweet Afton,\" written by Robert Burns. No matter what its origin, this lullaby of a hymn continues to soften hearts every Christmas.\n\n\"Away in a Manger\" Lyrics\n\n1. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,\n\nThe little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head.\n\nThe stars in the sky looked down where He lay,\n\nThe little Lord Jesus a sleep in the hay.\n\n2. The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes\n\nBut little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.\n\nI love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky\n\nAnd stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.\n\n3. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay\n\nClose by me forever, and love me, I pray.\n\nBless all the dear children in Thy tender care,\n\nAnd take us to Heaven to live with Thee there.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Away in a Manger\"\n\nOur next song probably started out as a fourteenth-century French dance. Keep reading to find out more about \"Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella.\"\n\n'Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella'\n\nFourteenth-century French socials often included the ritournelle, a lively court dance. One ritournelle melody survives as the song that became the French Christmas carol \"Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella.\" The central characters of the song might have served as inspiration for the two serving maids depicted at the nativity in a famous painting by Georges de La Tour.\n\nThe lyrics are said to have originated in either Anjou or Burgundy. They were paired with the melody and first published in 1553 by a wealthy nobleman in Cantiques de Premiere Advenement de Jesus-Christ.\n\n\"Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella\" Lyrics\n\n1. Bring a torch, Jeannette, Isabella!\n\nBring a torch to the cradle run!\n\nIt is Jesus, good folks of the village;\n\nChrist is born and Mary's calling:\n\nAh! ah! beautiful is the mother!\n\nAh! ah! beautiful is her Son!\n\n2. It is wrong when the Child is sleeping\n\nIt is wrong to talk so loud;\n\nSilence, all, as you gather around,\n\nLest your noise should waken Jesus:\n\nHush! hush! see how fast He slumbers:\n\nHush! hush! see how fast He sleeps!\n\n3. Softly to the little stable,\n\nSoftly for the moment come;\n\nLook and see how charming is Jesus,\n\nSee how He smiles, Oh see how rosy!\n\nHush! hush! see how the Child is sleeping;\n\nHush! hush! see how He smiles in dreams.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella\"\n\nYou might recognize the tune for our next Christmas carol -- it shares its melody with the traditional English song \"Greensleeves.\" Learn the history of \"What Child is This?\" on the following page.\n\n'What Child Is This?'\n\nYou probably recognize the melody of England's \"Greensleeves\" as identical to the Christmas hymn, \"What Child Is This?\" Initially, Richard Jones was credited with writing \"Greensleeves\" in 1580, but some believe that King Henry VIII, rather than Jones, authored it.\n\nRegardless of the true composer, Queen Elizabeth I, Henry's daughter, enjoyed dancing to it. This traditional song was also mentioned by William Shakespeare in The Merry Wives of Windsor. In 1865, three stanzas of the William Chatterton Dix poem \"The Manger Throne\" were set to the tune, giving birth to \"What Child Is This?\"\n\n\"What Child is This?\" Lyrics\n\n1. What child is this who, laid to rest,\n\non Mary's lap is sleeping,\n\nWhom angels greet with anthems sweet\n\nWhile shepherds watch are keeping.\n\nThis, this is Christ the King,\n\nWhom shepherds guard and angels sing.\n\nHaste, haste to bring Him laud,\n\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary!\n\n2. Why lies He in such mean estate\n\nWhere ox and ass are feeding?\n\nGood Christians fear: for sinners here\n\nThe silent Word is pleading.\n\nNail, spear shall pierce Him through,\n\nThe Cross be borne for me, for you;\n\nHail! Hail the Word Made Flesh,\n\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary!\n\n3.

Joy! for Christ is born,\n\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary!\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"What Child Is This?\"\n\n\"Good Christian Men, Rejoice,\" our next song, was written in the fourteenth century and has undergone many transformations since then. Keep reading to learn about it.\n\n'Good Christian Men, Rejoice'\n\nThis song has survived several complex revisions since its anonymous fourteenth-century creation. In 1601, Bartholomaeus Gesius wrote a modern arrangement of the traditional tune, now called \"In Dulci Jubilo.\"\n\nLater, Johann Sebastian Bach included Gesius's theme in his Chorale Preludes for the organ. In its next generation, Sir John Stainer made further refinements to the tune under its new title, \"Nun singet und seid froh.\" The Christmas song that we enjoy today is courtesy of Reverend Dr. John Mason Neale, who translated the lyrics into English from German.\n\n\"Good Christian Men, Rejoice\" Lyrics\n\n1. Good Christian men, rejoice\n\nWith heart and soul and voice,\n\nGive ye heed to what we say, News!

See the following page for more on \"O Holy Night.\"\n\n'O Holy Night'\n\nThe composer of \"O Holy Night,\" Adolphe Charles Adam, found himself in the midst of controversy when his song received a negative reaction from French church authorities. The nineteenth-century composer, known for his ballet Giselle, was accused of having \"a lack of musical taste\" by a French bishop.\n\nHappily, society disagreed. Poet Cappeau de Roquemaure added lyrics to Adam's music, renaming it \"Cantique de Noel.\" Later, a translation by American composer John Sullivan Dwight brought the English version to our shores. Today, the solemn \"O Holy Night\" is sung as a popular Christmas Eve solo.\n\n\"O Holy Night\" Lyrics\n\nO holy night, the stars are brightly shinning,\n\nIt is the night of the dear Savior's birth.\n\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining,\n\nTill He appeared and the soul felt its worth.\n\nA thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,\n\nFor yonder breaks a new glorous morn.\n\nFall on your knees, O, hear the angel voices!\n\nO night divine!

A favorite play topic was Jesus' birth. These events were often orchestrated by singers, writers, and musicians.\n\nPossibly of French or English origin (\"Noel\" is French for \"Christmas\"), \"The First Noel\" remains a descendant of these productions. Words added by William Sandys for his 1833 compendium of hymns, Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern, mark the first time that the lyrics and music were published together.\n\n\"The First Noel\" Lyrics\n\n1. The first Noel the angels did say,\n\nwas to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay.\n\nIn fields where they lay keeping their sheep,\n\nOn a cold winter's night that was so deep.\n\nNoel, Noel, Noel, Noel,\n\nBorn is the King of Israel.\n\n2. They looked up and saw a star\n\nShining in the East beyond them far,\n\nAnd to the earth it gave great light,\n\nAnd so it continued both day and night.\n\nNoel, Noel, Noel ...\n\n3.

Therefore, Jesus' promise of liberation for all people, combined with the imagery of The Sermon on the Mount, was cherished by African Americans.\n\nChances are, this became the inspiration for the rousing spiritual, \"Go, Tell It on the Mountain.\" Though its author is unknown, the hymn is assumed to have originated in the early 1800s. \"Go, Tell It on the Mountain\" was popularized in 1879 when performed by the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University, a school that once specialized in educating freed slaves.\n\n\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" Lyrics\n\n1. Go tell it on the mountain,\n\nOver the hills and everywhere,\n\nGo tell it on the mountain,\n\nThat Jesus Christ is born!\n\nWhen I was a seeker,\n\nI sought both night and day,\n\nI asked the Lord to help me,\n\nAnd He showed me the way.\n\nOh!

Our next Christmas carol paints just such a scene -- keep reading to learn about the origins of \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers.\"\n\n'Parade of the Wooden Soldiers'\n\nOne hearing of the upbeat \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" and you'll likely guess the song's German origins. It was written in 1905 and then \"imported\" to Paris after a Russian producer heard the lively beat, declaring it an ideal dance tune for the new musical review that he was preparing. The song was destined for international fame.\n\nWhen the production moved to New York City, \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" attracted the attention of lyricist Ballard Macdonald who had written for the great Ziegfeld as well as other producers. Though not as recognizable as the melody, his lyrics helped make this tune an American Christmas standard.\n\n\"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" Lyrics\n\nThe toy shop door is locked up tight\n\nAnd everything is quiet for the night.\n\nWhen suddenly the clock strikes twelve,\n\nThe fun's begun.\n\nThe dolls are in their best arrayed\n\nThere's going to be a wonderful parade\n\nHark to the drum, oh, here they come,\n\nCries everyone.\n\nHear them all cheering, now they are nearing,\n\nThere's the captain stiff as starch.\n\nBayonets flashing, music is crashing\n\nAs the wooden soldiers march.\n\nSabers a clinking, soldiers a winking\n\nAt each pretty little maid.\n\nHere they come, here they come\n\nHere they come, here they come.\n\nWooden soldiers on parade.\n\nDaylight is creeping, dollies are sleeping,\n\nIn the toy shop window fast;\n\nSoldiers so jolly, think of each dolly,\n\nDreaming of the night that's past,\n\nWhen in the morning, without a warning,\n\nToy man pulls the window shade,\n\nThere's no sign the wood brigade\n\nWas ever out upon parade.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\"\n\nCaroling through the streets is a holiday tradition. See the next page to learn about a caroling classic, \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas.\"\n\n'We Wish You a Merry Christmas'\n\nThe custom of caroling through the streets originated in England when wealthy businessmen hired street singers to accompany their strolls. The tradition quickly extended to all types of choruses.\n\nThese singers became known as \"waits,\" because the group would perform and then wait around for any sweet rewards. Finding the perfect group of singers became a lengthy process; everyone vied for the waits who knew the best carols. \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" was definitely on everyone's list.\n\n\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" Lyrics\n\n1. We wish you a merry Christmas,\n\nWe wish you a merry Christmas,\n\nWe wish you a merry Christmas\n\nand a happy New Year.\n\nGood Tidings we bring to you and your kin,\n\nGood tidings for Christmas and a happy New Year.\n\n2.

Reacquaint yourself with \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" by going to the following page.\n\n'O Come, All Ye Faithful'\n\nRelocating to France in the eighteenth century, Englishman John Francis Wade earned his living by transcribing sheet music and giving music lessons to children. It is not known whether he actually wrote the lyrics for \"Adeste Fideles,\" or if he came across it in his line of work.\n\nWhatever its origin, Wade is credited with the words. He then collaborated with Britain's John Reading to give the hymn a melody and published it around 1751. Revived a century later, \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" became a popular church hymn when Frederick Oakeley translated it into English from Latin.\n\n\"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" Lyrics\n\n1. Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,\n\nO come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.\n\nCome and behold Him, born the king of angels.\n\nO come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him,\n\nO come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.\n\n2. Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation;\n\nSing, all ye citizens of heav'n above:\n\nGlory to God, glory in the highest.\n\nO come ...\n\n3. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;\n\nJesus to Thee be glory giv'n;\n\nWord of the Father, now in flesh appearing.\n\nO come ...\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\"\n\nThe lyrics to our next song came from the psalms of King David, although they weren't always credited to him. Keep reading to learn more about \"Joy to the World.\"\n\n'Joy to the World'\n\nThe history of the popular \"Joy to the World\" is truly unusual. Its lyrics originated in the Old Testament as published in Isaac Watt's 1719 translation of the Psalms of David. When American composer Lowell Mason set these words to music in 1839, he added a notation alluding to George Frideric Handel as lyricist (it was common to attribute a song to Handel in those days in order to generate popularity).\n\nThus, for over a century, the world believed that Handel had composed the song's lyrics. Ultimately, careful sleuthing by musicologists unearthed the truth, and credit was restored to the rightful source: King David.\n\n\"Joy to the World\" Lyrics\n\n1. Joy to the world, the Lord is come,\n\nLet earth receive her king,\n\nLet every heart prepare Him room,\n\nAnd heav'n and nature sing,\n\nAnd heav'n and nature sing,\n\nAnd heav'n and heav'n and nature sing.\n\n2. Joy to the world, the Savior reigns,\n\nLet men their songs employ,\n\nWhile fields and floods,\n\nRocks, hills, and plains,\n\nRepeat the sounding joy,\n\nRepeat the sounding joy,\n\nRepeat, repeat the sounding joy.\n\n3. He rules the world with truth and grace,\n\nAnd makes the nations prove,\n\nThe glories of\n\nHis righteousness,\n\nAnd wonders of His love,\n\nAnd wonders of His love,\n\nAnd wonders, wonders of His love.\n\nChristmas sheet music: \"Joy to the World\"\n\nNo one is quite sure what the imagery in our next song is meant to represent, but despite that confusion, the song remains a classic Christmas carol. Go to the next page to learn more about \"I Saw Three Ships.\"\n\n'I Saw Three Ships'\n\nHistorians love to debate the symbolism found within the words of the Christmas hymn, \"I Saw Three Ships.\" Do the seafaring vessels represent Columbus's voyage? Or are they indirect references to: the Holy Trinity, the three Wise Men, or I Corinthians 13:13 (King James Version, \"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity\")?\n\nWhatever the intent of the song's lyricist, \"I Saw Three Ships\" has been a popular hymn since its publication in 1666. Notably, Cecil Sharp, an English collector of folk songs, discovered several versions of this melody throughout the British Isles.\n\n\"I Saw Three Ships\" Lyrics\n\n1. I saw three ships come sailing in;\n\nOn Christmas Day, On Christmas Day,\n\nI saw three ships come sailing in;\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\n2.
