        "text": "Florence Price\n\nFlorence Price (1887-1953)\n\n- She was the first African-American woman to have her music performed by a major symphony orchestra.\n\n- She was from Arkansas (said like Arkansaw), United States.\n\n- Price was a classical composer, pianist, organist and music teacher.\n\n- Despite growing up in a time where there were deep racial prejudices, Price and her family were well respected in their community and her father was the only African American dentist in their city!\n\n-She went on to play at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and to avoid any racial discrimination against African-Americans, she wrote her hometown as being Mexico.\n\n- As well as being inspired by composers such as Tchaikovsky and Dvorak, she tried to incorporate African-American tunes and music into her compositions.\n\nThis fortnight's piece: Symphony No.1 E Minor\n\nFlorence Price: Symphony No. 1 in E minor - YouTube\n\nThis piece was composed whilst Price was recovering from a broken foot. This piece won first place prize for an orchestral work and it caught the attention of the conductor for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n\nPrice drew inspiration for the piece from our previous composer of the fortnight, Dvorak and his New World Symphony.\n\nAaron Copeland\n\nAaron Copland (1900- 1990)\n\nCopland was an American composer and was sometimes recalled as the 'Dean of American Music'.\n\nHe single-handedly gave American classical music a voice and sound that people recognised as American. As the political situation worsened in Europe (World Wars), many composers from there moved to America such as Rachmaninov making American composers try very hard to create a distinctive American musical voice.\n\nCopland trained in Paris under the influences of composers such as Debussy and Ravel. He then returned home and tried to create American music. It didn't begin well, but soon he was composing works that represented Latin America and the Wild West, incorporating cowboy songs in his works His most famous words are Fanfare for the Common Man, Rodeo, Appalachian Spring, Billy the Kid and El Salon Mexico.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Hoedown. It is from Copland's work 'Rodeo' (1942).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsReWx9XdNs&list=RDLsReWx9XdNs&start_radio=1\n\nIt was first composed as a ballet suite but in 1943 it was rearranged as an orchestral suite. It has four pieces to the suite called Buckaroo Holiday, Corral Nocturne, Saturday Night Waltz and Hoedown. The suite uses traditional cowboy folk songs and also traditional Irish music to give the music the western feel. In Hoedown, a square-dance tune called Bonypart was used in the composition. He also includes some Irish reels and an Irish tune called Gilderoy.\n\nHere is the original choreography for the ballet- you can see they are line dancing!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKChyxd9MnM\n\nHere is a great BBC resource about this piece. You can watch the orchestra play it as well as some more facts about the composer and piece.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/xHY4YjcsgN1Tp31Zdc6Ws1/rodeo-hoe-down-by-aaron-copland\n\nHow does the music make you feel? What instruments can you hear?\n\nJohn Williams\n\nJohn Williams (1932- present)\n\nWilliams is a famous composer, conductor and pianist\n\nWidely and arguably regarded as one of the greatest film composers of all time.\n\nHe has won 25 grammy awards, 7 BAFTAs, 5 Academy awards and 4 Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHe composed the music for Star Wars and in 2005 was selected as the greatest American film score of all time.\n\nHe has composed the music for these films (you may recognise some!): Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T. , Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, Superman, Harry Potter, Home Alone, Fiddler on the Roof, Hook, Indiana Jones, Tintin, BFG and many more! Listen to as many of these as you want!\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Flying Theme from ET\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-qrMz-JAzo\n\nWe call a musical and orchestral work produced for film a score.\n\n1982- This score for E.T. won awards such as an Academy Award and a Grammy. E.T. is a children's film about an alien who accidentally landed on Earth and made a friend with a boy called Elliot. However, some people wanted to use E.T for science but E.T. just wanted to go home.\n\nIt is composed for a very large, full orchestra. What instruments can you hear?\n\nTips for listening to music with your children!\n\nThis piece is for a film, what do you think is happening in the film when this music is playing?\n\nThis piece is a great piece to ask your children what they think is happening. It doesn't matter what they say but hopefully they can make connections between what is happening in the music with what they think could be happening in the film. E.g. when the tempo is fast your child might think that there is running, or chasing going on.\n\nMusical tips: This is the famous flying theme music from the film. The pitch is high which could show flying as well as little flutters of flutes. Flutes are often used in music to represent birds- in this piece it could be doing that or showing that E.T. and Elliot are flying high like the birds.\n\nThis piece is for a film, can you draw what do you think is happening in the film when this music is playing?\n\nChildren can also listen to the piece and draw what they think might be happening in the film. Film music is the perfect opportunity to get your children to really imagine what might be happening in the film because it is music composed for a particular reason and scene.\n\nIt is a great skill for your child to learn so practise with as many different pieces from this composer as you'd like. You can maybe even reveal the scenes (within reason of course!) that the music accompanies to show your children if their guesses were right.\n\nLouis Armstrong\n\nLouis Armstrong (1901-1971)\n\nHe was an American trumpeter, composer and singer and was one of the most influential people in the style of jazz.\n\nHe was from New Orleans, one of the main places that jazz developed.\n\nHe moved the idea from group jazz to individual improvisation on an instrument. Improvisation means making music up on the spot as you play.\n\nHe has a very distinctive gravelly voice and also was very skilled at skatting. This is a jazz technique when people sing using nonsense syllables, using the voice as an instrument rather than speaking.\n\nHe was the first African- American entertainer to also be popular amongst international audiences and was able to access upper class American society during a time when it was extremely hard for black men to do so.\n\nThis fortnight's piece: What a Wonderful World\n\nAlthough not composed by Louis, it is sung by him using his unique and recognisable voice. It was released in 1967 and topped the UK music charts.\n\nIt didn't do well in the USA because the current president of a large music company didn't like it and refused to promote it throughout the country.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPt7ecosbyA\n\nTo hear some of his wonderful trumpet playing listen to his cover of the song 'La Vie en Rose'.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IJzYAda1wA\n\nCecile Chaminade\n\nCecile Chaminade (1857-1944)\n\nShe was a French composer and pianist.\n\nHer mother pushed her music because her father did not approve of it.\n\nShe even performed some of her work to the composer, Bizet (who has also been one of our composers of the fortnight) who absolutely loved her performing.\n\nChaminade went on many tours and was well received in England and America. She visited these countries many times to perform due to her popularity there.\n\nSome of her smaller pieces of work were enjoyed but her more serious musical pieces were not recognised during her time. This was most likely because she was a woman and many didn't take her music seriously. Therefore she mainly composed short piano pieces.\n\nShe was the first female composer to receive the award 'Legion d'Honneur' for her work, the highest French award for merit.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Concertino composed in 1902. In this video one of the world's best flute players, James Galway, plays the piece.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Gn_FpTXD0\n\nIt was commissioned by the Paris Conservatoire for their flute students to play for their exams. Shortly after composing it, she arranged it for the flute and orchestra for her friend to play at a London concert. It is a popular piece today for flautists to learn. Here is the link if you want to hear her play!.\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/36101dff735549fc966505ac4c1273e1)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRILEJ7zBMw\n\nHere is the piece with the orchestra instead of the piano. Which one do you prefer? Which family of instruments does the flute belong to?\n\nRichard Wagner\n\nRichard Wagner (1813- 1883)\n\nWagner was a German composer, conductor and theatre director\n\nHe was best known for his operas and changed the style of opera forever and his opera Tristan und Isolde was seen to mark the beginning of modern music.\n\nHe had a strong interest and love of theatre and took part in many different plays.\n\nHe had a great musical ear but wasn't very good at performing it. He did write lots plays and dramas that he then set some to music.\n\nHe wrote incredibly long operas , including the Ring Cycle which is between 15 and 18 hours long (depends how fast it is played) and it consists of 4 operas played in sequence!\n\nThe Ring Cycle has to be played over four nights with the longest opera of the cycle being 5 hours long.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Ride of the Valkyries. It is from the second of the four operas of the Ring Cycle. It is one of the most famous tunes of Wagner's. It is a 5 minute piece from Wagner's 5 hour opera, Die Walkure.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V92OBNsQgxU\n\nIt is this piece that gives the opera its popularity. It is used in lots of television adverts and films. The opera is based on mythology, telling the story of the god, Wotan who was a curse inflicting king of the gods. The Valkyries are his daughters and this piece opens the third Act with them riding on flying horses.\n\nWhat instruments do you hear? What are the dynamics of the piece? How does the music make you feel? How does the music make you think the horses could be flying?\n\nHere is a link that has activities and ideas surrounding the piece as well as a live orchestra performance of it!\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4gdCGV8y3gxdkKrq3HP8S3M/ride-of-the-valkyries-from-die-walkure-by-richard-wagner\n\nGeorge Bizet\n\nGeorges Bizet (1838- 1875)\n\nBizet was a French composer of the Romantic period.\n\nHe was best known for his operas before his early death.\n\nHe began playing music from a young age, taught by his mother. His father was a singer and a teacher so Georges used to listen in through the door and learn difficult songs by memory.\n\nDue to this amazing ability he was let in to the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 9 when then age limit is actually 10.\n\nHe was influenced by composers such as Wagner, a pioneer of the opera.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Overture from Carmen. This was Bizet's most famous opera and he died before it really took off in the musical world.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuFOuh3QHs\n\nIt is set in the south of Spain and tells the story of a soldier who falls for the Roma gypsy, Carmen. This is the overture from the opera. An overture is found at the beginning of any musical or opera and it gives listeners a sneak peak into the songs and music they will here later on.\n\nThe percussion section brings the Spanish setting to life- can you name any instruments from the percussion section of an orchestra?\n\nOne famous piece from the opera is Habanera and it is sung by the main character, Carmen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSsNFPk2vNA\n\nThe tune is by a Spanish composer that Bizet believed to be a folk song. A habanera is a genre of Cuban dance music and was brought back to Spain by sailors and so the rhythm of this piece is that of the Cuban dance. Can you clap the rhythm that you hear at the beginning?\n\nThis rhythm does not change throughout the whole piece.\n\nAram Khachaturan\n\nAram Khachaturan (1903-1978)\n\n-Khachaturian (said Ka-ka-ture-ree-an) was a Soviet Armenian composer and was considered one of the leading Soviet composers and eventually the most renowned Armenian composers of the 20th century.\n\n-He studied music at the Moscow conservatory, composing ballets, symphonies, concertos and even film scores.\n\n-His most famous words were his ballets Gayane and Spartacus.\n\nSpartacus was his only internationally acclaimed work.\n\nCheck out this piece as well- you might have heard it before!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqg3l3r_DRI\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia composed in 1954.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ETMtbcKrc\n\nIt is a ballet based on the real life gladiator Spartacus. The ballet begins Spartacus and his wife Phrygia being captured by the Romans. They were separated and sent to do horrible thing so Spartacus decided to lead other captives to fight back against the Romans. They freed themselves and managed to find Phrygia again. They celebrate together and this is where the 'adagio' begins to play.\n\nAdagio means slow, so what is the tempo like in this piece?\n\nHow does the music make you feel?\n\nWhat instruments can you hear?\n\nSergei Rachmaninov\n\nSergei Rachmaninov (1873- 1943)\n\nRachmaninov was a Russian composer, virtuoso pianist and conductor during the late Romantic Period.\n\nHe was influenced by many Russian composers including Tchaikovsky. Rachmaninov started playing piano at the age of four and graduated at the Moscow conservatory.\n\nHe loved including the piano in most of his compositions and explored the many different qualities the instrument possessed through his own piano skills.\n\nFun fact: Rachmaninov's piano music always had large chords (a group of notes played at the same time) because he had extremely large hands.\n\nOther pianists had to find different ways to play the chords because they were too hard to play.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini (1934)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg76YTPpgcs\n\nIt is one of his most famous works for solo piano and orchestra. Paganini was a violinist who composed some small tunes- one of these pieces became the inspiration for composers such as Rachmaninov for this piece.\n\nHe took the tune, and made little changes to it called 'variations'. Our piece is just one of the variations.\n\nIf you want to listen to the whole of this beautiful piece you can!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33q87s03h4\n\nEdvard Grieg\n\nEdvard Grieg (1843 -1907)\n\nGrieg was a Norwegian composer and pianist of the Romantic period.\n\nHe used lots of Norwegian folk music in his compositions which made many people more aware of Norwegian music.\n\nHe came from the city of Bergen, which now has many museums, statues and even halls named after him for this legacy that he left in the city.\n\nWhen he was 15 his talent was recognised and was sent to a conservatory in Leipzig to develop his piano performance.\n\nHe sadly had poor health, in particular his lungs and heart were weak and he was in and out of hospital for a lot of his life.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is The Little Bird\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1mSepq-pEU\n\nThis piece isn't one of Grieg's famous pieces, however it is a favourite for young pianists to learn. Liten fugl- which means little bird is one piece from a collection of 66 short pieces for the piano. What can you hear in the piece that makes you think of a bird? (Listen to the beginning in particular)\n\nThese short pieces were published from 1867-1901- his most famous ones being Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, To Spring, March of the Trolls and Butterfly. If you can, try and have a listen to these other little pieces (parents you might recognise them!).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq83dUB37rI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALCpt_ScLl0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFhy0yCaTIA\n\nBedrich Smetana\n\nBedrich Smetana (1824 -1884)\n\nSmetana was a Czech composer and was considered the father of Czech music.\n\nHe was a gifted composer and first performed at the age of 6.\n\nHe moved to Prague where he established himself as a champion of the new music of Czech opera with his most famous called 'The Bartered Bride'.\n\nIn 1874 Smetana had become completely deaf but he still managed to compose.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is The Moldau\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4NKzmfC-Q\n\nThe piece is one of six symphonic poems (a short musical piece which represents a poem, short story, painting or a landscape) that Smetana wrote. It is his most famous piece of music.\n\nThis piece is called Vltava and but translated in the Moldau. It is a piece that represents the river of its name and its course through the land.\n\nSmetana describes its course: it begins as two small springs, flowing through woods and meadows, past ruins of castles and palaces, round the mermaids in the moonlight, through swirls rapids and then flows through Prague and then vanishes into the distance.\n\nCan you hear any of these things in the music? Can you hear the swirls of the rapids or the mermaids in the moonlight?\n\nPyotr Tchaikovsky\n\nPyotr Tchaikovsky (1840- 1893)\n\nTchaikovsky was a famous Russian composer of the Romantic Period. He was the first Russian composer who was known internationally in his time, conducting concerts in both Europe and the United states.\n\nTchaikovsky was offered a place to learn and perform music at Saint Petersburg Conservatory.\n\n*A musical conservatory is a place where very talented musicians are trained by the best musicians from around the world- they are very hard to get into!*\n\nMany Russian composers did not like Tchaikovsky's music because it didn't sound very Russian. In those times it was important to Russians to have a national identity and Tchaikovsky's music did not follow that.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is the Waltz of the Flowers, it is from Tchaikovsky's most famous ballet The Nutcracker(1892).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxHkLdQy5f0\n\nPeople didn't like the ballet when it was first shown and played. However, in the 1960s it became very popular and many ballet companies perform the ballet every year.\n\nYou can watch and listen to The Nutcracker here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLoaMfinbU (it's long so maybe watch it in parts!)\n\nIsaac Albeniz\n\nIsaac Albeniz (1860- 1909)\n\nAbeniz was a spanish virtuoso pianist, composer and conductor from the Post-Romantic era.\n\nHe is best known for his piano pieces that are based on Spanish folk music.\n\nHis piano music had then be transposed for classical guitar and became very important repertoire for a guitar player to learn- however Albeniz never composed for the guitar.\n\nHe was born in Camprodon part of the northern province of Catalonia.\n\nHe was considered a child prodigy and began performing at the age of 4. He even passed the entrance examination to the prestigious Paris Conservatory at the age of 7 but wasn't allowed in as he was too young.\n\nBy the age of 15 he had travelled and performed concerts worldwide.\n\nThis fortnight's piece is Asturias. It was composed originally for piano in 1892 as a prelude of a three movement work, Chants L'Espagne. This is it played on the piano and also on guitar. Which one do you prefer?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P8BQVhOv5A\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A\n\nIt is meant to have features of Andalusian flamenco music. Does it make you want to dance?\n\nAsturias is meant to make you think of the flamenco dancing. Here is some flamenco to inspire you:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbMDH3-lBqM\n\nAlexander Borodin\n\nAlexander Borodin (1833-1887)\n\nRussian composer and chemist and even considered science his primary profession. He even founded the 'School of Medicine for Women' in Russia\n\nHe was part of Russia's “The Five” who were a group of composers who created a uniquely Russian kind of music.\n\nAlthough many people told his parents he was a musical prodigy they didn't want to get him extra lessons and attention for his talent. However, he made his first public performance at the age of 9.\n\nThis fortnight's piece: Polovtsian Dances\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiexn6O9To4\n\nThese dances were part of Borodin's opera, Prince Igor.\n\nThe opera remained unfinished when Borodin died but other composers tried to finish it and these versions involved a chorus of singers. The dances are a much loved part of the opera so are often given a special place in concerts without the context of the rest of the opera.\n\nPolovsty is the name given by Russians to the wandering Turkic people who existed in the middle ages that lived in the grasslands of Europe such as Mongolia and Kazakhstan. The music comes at a point when these people are dancing and have titles such as 'Dance of the Maidens' and 'Wild Dance of the Men'.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVURal-QYsA\n\nHere is the dance from the opera with the chorus.\n\nWhich version do you like?\n\nJohann Strauss 11\n\nJohann Strauss 11 (1825-1899)\n\n-Austrian composer of 'light music' in particular dance music such as waltzes and polkas.\n\n-He was known as the “Waltz King”\n\n-His father, Johann Strauss 1, was also a composer of dance music but wanted his son to become a banker rather than a composer.\n\n-His father was so well known that many people did not want to work with his son in case it made him angry. They became rivals!\n\nThis fortnight's piece is The Blue Danube (also called On the Beautiful Blue Danube) composed in 1866.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnTibyca6x8\n\nThe River Danube is Europe's second largest river and flows through 10 countries!\n\nStrauss's piece is one of the most popular pieces in classical music. However, when it was first played it wasn't considered a great success and was actually a song. He was asked to compose an instrument only version and this was the version that we know today.\n\nHere is the original choir version sung by boys from Vienna, where Strauss was from.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY2M4t_3uEo\n\nWhich version do you prefer? Why do you prefer it?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6t318FgFdc\n\nHere is a version with people dancing to the music! I hope you enjoy!\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\n(1770-1827)\n\n- German composer and pianist.\n\n- His work is considered some of the most performed classical music ever.\n\n- He was very talented from a young age and was initially taught music by his very harsh father.\n\n-When he was 28, he started losing his hearing and by the time he was 45 he was completely deaf. He used vibrations to help him compose and as he lost his hearing he used lower notes a lot more because he could feel those vibrations the most.\n\n-Beethoven's housekeepers remembered that as his hearing became worse, he would sit at the piano, put a pencil in his mouth and touched the other end of the pencil on the soundboard the piano to feel the vibration of the notes through the pencil.\n\nThis fortnight's piece: Moonlight Sonata\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU\n\nOn of Beethoven's most loved and known piece of piano repertoire. It was composed in 1801. Beethoven dedicated the piece to a student of his at the time. The name of the piece is in reference to a poet who reviewed the music and likened the first movement of the piece to a boat floating in the moonlight in Switzerland.\n\nWhat do you think about the music that might have made the poet think of this?\n\nThomas Tallis\n\nThomas Tallis (1505-1585)\n\n- Tallis was an English Renaissance composer.\n\n- There is almost no records about him and his birth or death. The dates we know are just estimates.\n\n- He served as a composer for the court of Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary I and Elizabeth I.\n\n-He also played the organ and lived in Greenwich, London with his wife.\n\nThis fortnight's piece: If ye love me\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqt005j1dB0\n\nThis is a four part anthem. The four parts are Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass.\n\nIt was first published during Elizabeth I's reign in 1565.\n\nThe text is taken from William Tyndale's translation of the Bible from verses from the Gospel of John. They are words spoken by Jesus foretelling his own death:\n\nIf ye love me, keep my commandments,\n\nAnd I will pray the Father,\n\nand he shall give you another comforter,\n\nthat he may abide with you forever\n\nE'en the spirit of truth."
