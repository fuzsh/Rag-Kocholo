        "text": "Music is a great way to expose yourself to new English expressions, especially since a lot of countries listen to English-language music even where English isn’t the primary language. Although the English found in some songs is not always grammatically correct, it’s a great way to get used to native accents and practice your listening skills.\n\nLet’s take a look at some Christmas songs lyrics and get ourselves in the Christmas music mood as we learn some new expressions. Many traditional Christmas songs were written many years ago and use words a bit differently than they would be used today, so sometimes these can be a bit tricky!\n\nWe've prepared some exercises with christmas songs in youtube. Have a look!\n\nIt's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year - lyrics\n\nThis song was first recorded and released by Andy Williams in 1963 and has since became one of the most famous Christmas classics. We’ve written all the lyrics below, but some of the words repeat again at the end of the song.\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year,\n\nWith the kids jingle belling\n\nAnd everyone telling you, \"Be of good cheer!\"\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year.\n\nIt's the hap-happiest season of all,\n\nWith those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings\n\nWhen friends come to call.\n\nIt's the hap- happiest season of all.\n\nJingle belling – A jingle bell, or sleigh bell, is an instrument commonly associated with winter and Christmastime because many years ago they would be attached to horse-drawn sleighs in the snow so that people could hear them coming. Although “jingle bell” is a noun, not a verb as used in the song, English words are very flexible, especially in songs and poetry, so the lyricist has invented this usage to mean “playing with sleigh bells.”\n\nBe of good cheer! – “Good cheer” is a feeling of happiness (although a cheer would be the excited shout you make when you’re happy). “Be of good cheer” is a little old-fashioned, but it means, “Have fun and enjoy yourself!”\n\nHap-happiest – In order to fit the rhythm of the song, the first syllable of the word “happy” is repeated\n\nGay happy meetings – Many Christmas songs include the word “gay,” an old word for “happy” that has taken on a different meaning in recent years.\n\nCome to call – “To call on someone” used to be a popular way of saying “to visit someone.” When friends come to call, they are stopping by for a visit.\n\nThere'll be parties for hosting,\n\nMarshmallows for toasting,\n\nAnd caroling out in the snow.\n\nThere'll be scary ghost stories\n\nAnd tales of the glories of\n\nChristmases long, long ago.\n\nCaroling – A carol is a song of praise or joy, and nowadays is usually used to refer to a song sung at Christmas. A carol is the song sung, and to carol or to go caroling is to sing these songs.\n\nGhost stories – Although this was popular in Victorian times, telling scary stories has gone out of fashion at Christmastime. One exception is the famous A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (which, despite its name, is a novella or mini nobel, and not a song!)\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year.\n\nThere'll be much mistletoeing\n\nAnd hearts will be glowing\n\nWhen loved ones are near.\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year.\n\nMistletoeing – Mistletoe is a plant that is traditionally hung at Christmas; people that meet underneath it are expected to kiss. Like “jingle belling,” this usage as a verb has been made up. What do you think this action might look like?\n\nHearts will be glowing – To glow means to shine brightly, usually referring to a light or a fire. However, a person can glow as well, when they are very happy or embarrassed and their cheeks turn red. Hearts that are glowing are not actually letting out light; it’s a way of saying that everyone will be happy.\n\nHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - lyrics\n\nThis song was first introduced by Judy Garland in the musical Meet Me in St. Louis in 1944. Frank Sinatra recorded a version with slightly altered lyrics that has become the most popular recording. In honor of Frank Sinatra’s 100th birthday tomorrow, December 12, 2015, here are the lyrics as sung by him.\n\nHave yourself a merry little Christmas.\n\nLet your heart be light.\n\nFrom now on,\n\nour troubles will be out of sight.\n\nLet you heart be light – A heavy heart would have lots of worries. However, if you let your heart be light, you’re being happy and thinking positively. Christmas is the time to be merry!\n\nOur troubles will be out of sight – Along the same lines as being light-hearted, this line is saying that only good things will happen; we won’t let our problems bother us.\n\nHave yourself a merry little Christmas.\n\nMake the Yuletide gay.\n\nFrom now on,\n\nour troubles will be miles away.\n\nYuletide – Yuletide is the period of time around Yule, which is an old word for Christmas and the Christmas season.\n\nMiles away – Miles are usually a measurement of physical distance, but here are used metaphorically to mean that any troubles or problems will be far away and not important.\n\nHere we are as in olden days,\n\nHappy golden days of yore.\n\nFaithful friends who are dear to us\n\nGather near to us once more.\n\nOlden – Olden is related to the word old, and a somewhat formal way of saying “from a long time ago.” It’s most commonly used in the expressions olden days or olden times.\n\nYore – Another word you hear commonly in Christmas songs, this is an old word meaning “time long past.”\n\nThrough the years\n\nWe all will be together,\n\nIf the Fates allow.\n\nHang a shining star upon the highest bough.\n\nAnd have yourself a merry little Christmas now.\n\nThe Fates – The Fates were the three goddesses from Greek and Roman mythology who controlled human destiny. In poetry, they’re often used to represent fate or destiny – things that are going to happen to someone – even though modern audiences don’t actually believe in the goddesses themselves.\n\nBough – A bough is a branch of a tree. (The word bough rhymes with now)\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - lyrics\n\nThe character of Rudolph first appeared in a 1939 booklet written by Robert L. May, and was written into a song by Johnny Marks, May’s brother-in-law, in 1949. Before that, the names of Santa’s eight reindeer had been decided by Clement Clarke Moore’s popular poem A Visit from St. Nicholas, otherwise known as ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas. Rudolph became the ninth, and has been an important part of Christmas tradition ever since.\n\nYou know Dasher, and Dancer,\n\nAnd Prancer, and Vixen,\n\nComet, and Cupid,\n\nAnd Donner and Blitzen,\n\nBut do you recall\n\nThe most famous reindeer of all?\n\nThese are all the names of the other reindeer as they appeared in Moore’s famous poem.\n\nRudolph the red-nosed reindeer\n\nHad a very shiny nose\n\nAnd if you ever saw it\n\nYou would even say it glows.\n\nRed-nosed – in English, you can often turn a body part into a past participle to use as a description: big-nosed, long-legged (pronounced “long leg-ged”), short-armed, etc.\n\nAll of the other reindeer\n\nUsed to laugh and call him names:\n\nThey never let poor Rudolph\n\nJoin in any reindeer games.\n\nCall him names – “To call someone names” is another way of saying “to make fun of someone.” You give them mean names that they probably don’t like!\n\nThen one foggy Christmas Eve\n\nSanta came to say:\n\n“Rudolph, with your nose so bright,\n\nWon't you guide my sleigh tonight?”\n\nThen how the reindeer loved him\n\nAs they shouted out with glee,\n\n“Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,\n\nYou'll go down in history!”\n\nGlee – Glee is an old word for “extreme happiness.” We don’t use it very much anymore, although you might recognize it as the name of a TV show. This is because “glee clubs” are choral groups, often attended as an afterschool activity in schools.\n\nGo down in history – It might be easier to understand “go down in history” as “be written down in history books.” This means that someone or something will be remembered for a specific reason.\n\nAll I want for Christmas is you - lyrics\n\nI just want you for my own\n\nMore than you could ever know\n\nMake my wish come true\n\nAll I want for Christmas is you\n\nI won't ask for much this Christmas\n\nI won't even wish for snow, and I\n\nI just wanna keep on waiting\n\nUnderneath the mistletoe\n\nMistletoe – it's an evergreen plant, placed on top of doors or ceilings during Christmas. it is said that two people must kiss everytime they meet undeneath the mistletoe.\n\nI won't make a list and send it\n\nTo the North Pole for Saint Nick\n\nI won't even stay awake\n\nTo hear those magic reindeer click\n\nSaint Nick – Santa Claus is also known by the name of Saint Nicholas. Nick here is an abbreviation of his full name.\n\n'Cause I just want you here tonight\n\nHolding on to me so tight\n\nWhat more can I do\n\nOh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you\n\nCarol of the bells - lyrics\n\nHark how the bells,\n\nSweet silver bells,\n\nAll seem to say,\n\nThrow cares away\n\nHark: This archaic word means to pay close attention\n\nChristmas is here,\n\nBringing good cheer,\n\nTo young and old,\n\nMeek and the bold.\n\nMeek: The lyrics are comparing both, people who are brave (bold) and people who aren't as much (meek)\n\nDing dong ding dong\n\nThat is their song\n\nWith joyful ring\n\nAll caroling.\n\nOne seems to hear\n\nWords of good cheer\n\nFrom everywhere\n\nFilling the air.\n\nOh how they pound,\n\nRaising the sound,\n\nO'er hill and dale,\n\nTelling their tale.\n\nGaily they ring\n\nWhile people sing\n\nSongs of good cheer,\n\nChristmas is here.\n\nMerry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas,\n\nMerry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas."
