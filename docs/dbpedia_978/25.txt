How do you say I hope you and your family have a merry Christmas?

We wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! Good tidings we bring, to you and your kin, good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year! We wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! That was the version we did in school for the Winter Show we did :D
