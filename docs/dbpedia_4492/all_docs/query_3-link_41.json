        "text": "MAKO signals the re-emergence of Declan O'Shea and Christian Montagne, both former members of acclaimed band Cyclefly, onto the music scene. During their time with the alternative rock band Cyclefly, Declan (vox) and Christian (bass guitar) toured throughout America and Europe with bands such as Linkin Park, Iggy Pop, Live, and Bush. The band also garnered places on the 'Best New Artist' lists of NME, Rock Sound, and Kerrang!\n\nFor the past two years Declan, a singer-songwriter from East Cork, and Christian, a songwriter-guitarist from Antibes, have concentrated all their energies on MAKO. While their new project retains the slightly edgy alt-rock sound that gathered so many fans for Cyclefly, it also possesses a more mellow maturity reflecting Declan and Christian's growth as songwriters and musicians.\n\nDeclan's voice, which has been compared to people such as Bowie, Richard Butler (Psychedelic furs), and Annie Lennox, permeates MAKO'S unforgettable lyrics in a charismatic and evocative manner. For the recording of their debut album, the band returned to Christian's native Antibes on the CÃ´te D'Azur. MAKO flawlessly encapsulates the musical development of the two artists who have combined raw talent with past experience.\n\nThe National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences placed Mako on the Official Ballot for the 2011 Grammy Awards in the following categories:\n\nBest Rock Performance By A Duo or Group with Vocals Mako - Unstoppable\n\nBest Rock Song Mako - Miss Alison\n\nBest Rock Album Mako - Living On Air\n\nBest Short Form Music Video Mako - Unstoppable"
