        "text": "A transitional year sees innovations in post-hardcore/industrial/punk, early grunge, hip hop and metal.\n\nTop 100 Albums of 1989 | Spotify Mix | Breakdown: Genre Lists | Videos | Movies | Books\n\n1989 was a transitional year. In the mainstream, rock music was about as unfashionable as it is today, with the charts being dominated by Madonna, Janet Jackson, Phil Collins, Cher, Garth Brooks, Michael Bolton and Milli Vanilli. Only Queen and Aerosmith had albums that made the top ten for the year, with Motley Crue, Tom Petty and Skid Row just outside it. A good number of bands in the indie/alt scene were making concerted pushes with major label albums to try to crossover to the mainstream, including Pixies, XTC, The Mighty Lemondrops, Camper Van Beethoven, The Cult, Soundgarden, Eleventh Dream Day, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Ministry, Throwing Muses, The Psychedelic Furs, New Order, Love And Rockets, Hoodoo Gurus, Screaming Blue Messiahs, The Godfathers, even Naked Raygun. The only bands to have much commercial success was the top seller of the Lucky 13, The Cure at #39 overall for the year. Nine Inch Nails also made the top 40. Not even Beastie Boys sold very well. Looking at it from that perspective, with most of the above bands having passed their peak, it looks pretty dismal compared to say, 1986.\n\nThat said, these artists did reach the top 10 of the British charts for at least a week: New Order, Elvis Costello, The Cult, Pixies, Simple Minds, The Cure, The The, Queen, Neneh Cherry, Tom Petty, The Pogues, Alice Cooper, Tears For Fears, Marillion and Kate Bush.\n\nHowever, the underground scenes of post-punk, post-industrial metal, death metal, dream pop, ambient pop were bubbling up and more than make up for the lackluster charts with groundbreaking creativity that will fuel innovation and creative energy into the 90s. Fugazi and NoMeansNo would show how it’s possible to be uncompromising, stay independent and charge affordable prices for shows and be successful. Godflesh and Beastie Boys pioneered new sounds while Melvins, Nirvana and Pixies gave glimpses of the near future. So even a slightly off year is still a good year for new music.\n\nGenre\n\nAmbient Pop & Sophisti-Pop were quietly brewing up some pretty influential albums from The Blue Nile, Julee Cruise and A.R. Kane, sowing the seeds for Trip Hop and Post-Rock.\n\nComeback\n\nIn the 80s, six years and two disappointing albums seemed like a big deal, a career-ending sort of thing. But Lou Reed proved he could bounce back fully invigorated on New York. If only he’d gone on to collaborate with tourmates The Feelies. Similarly Black Sabbath made a good album after the same time period lull.\n\nDebut\n\nThe Lucky 13 had four stellar debuts from Fugazi, The New Christs, Godflesh and Nirvana. Three would make significant, and very different cultural impacts on the following decade. Bubbling under were De La Soul, Bitch Magnet, Mudhoney, Slint, Buffalo Tom and The Stone Roses.\n\nMemoriam\n\nVincent Crame (45, Arthur Brown/Atomic Rooster), John Cipollina (45, Quicksilver Messenger Service), Pete de Freitas (27, Echo & the Bunnymen), Irving Berlin, Woody Shaw, Perez prado, King Tubby, Roy Eldridge. Also Salvador Dali, John Cassavetes, Mel Blanc, Laurence Olivier, Raul Seixas.\n\nUnderrated\n\nI had friends who were fans of legendary underground down under garage punkers Radio Birdman, but no one seemed to know about Rob Younger’s new band, The New Christs. To be fair it was released only on Australian label Citadel. Not that they were all that new, having issued singles most of the decade, but it was certainly one of the coolest albums of the year. Also Garage Noir as a genre tag should have taken off.\n\nDisappointment\n\nIt’s hard to limit to just one. Despite still making the Lucky 13, I was pretty savagely disappointed by the Pixies’ second album. Hey, I was 19/20 and very passionate. Runner up was H.R.’s homophobic lyrics on Bad Brains’ “Don’t Blow No Bubbles.” Or perhaps XTC’s gaudy, busy production on Oranges and Lemons. New Order, Elvis Costello.\n\nSurprise\n\nJust like how death metal re-calibrated the amount of speed and intensity I could handle the previous year, I did not see Godflesh coming. Like a sneak attack from a steamroller, I SHOULD have heard it coming, having seen Head of David live, but no. I was taken by surprise.\n\nFester’s Lucky 13 – The Best Albums of 1989\n\n1. Fugazi – 13 Songs (Dischord)\n\nTechnically 13 Songs is a compilation of Fugazi’s first two EPs. But it was also their first CD release, the same year as Margin Walker EP. I stopped buying vinyl records for the most part in 1985, so as far as I was concerned, this was their debut album, and an amazing one at that.\n\n2. The New Christs – Distemper (Citadel)\n\nThe New Christs album featured in the previous year’s Lucky 13, Divine Rights (1988) was a singles compilation, but a great one up there with Singles Going Steady. The long-time coming debut album Distemper (1989) is without a doubt their masterpiece, the culmination of everything they learned making the singles into a cohesive, fiery album, screwing down the seething anger into a boiling menace. “No Way On Earth” and “Another Sin” kick off the album with tight, terse rockers, but the album progressively gets more unhinged as Younger battles with his emotional demons, with the anguished dirges “The March,” “Afterburn” and “Bed Of Nails” influencing the next generation of bands like The Drones, The Volcanics and Hits. “Circus Of Sour” seems to confront the distorted circus monster of the cover from his childhood nightmares. The epic “Disconnected” wraps up the album with the suitably mixed feelings of closure and ennui. This album deserves to be enshrined and worshipped as one of the all-time greats. It’s still available direct from Citadel. Shortly after its release, the band disintegrated during a European tour, which contributed to this album’s lost classic status.\n\n3. NoMeansNo – Wrong (Alternative Tentacles)\n\nFugazi wasn’t the only post-hardcore art punk band pushing boundaries and setting pristine examples for integrity. Canada’s NoMeansNo was at it since 1980, saying no to big labels and expensive concert tickets. Their fourth full length has them both at their most experimental, and fiercest. More people need to hear this highwater mark.\n\n4. Godflesh – Streetcleaner (Earache)\n\nJustin Broadrick’s quest for the ultimate heavy sounds began with the grindcore of Napalm Death and industrial rock of Head of David, and continued with Fall Of Because, essentially an early prototype for Godflesh. After an impressive EP, the debut landed on earth like a fallen moon, crushing everything under it. I saw this played at the radio station on the metal show alongside Death and Carcass. It featured on my post-punk show, and others’ industrial rock. Everyone who heard it was in awe of it’s power. 30 years later it’s still melting brains.\n\n5. The Cure – Disintegration (Elektra)\n\nFor some reason, The Cure’s Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me (1987) is known as the sprawling double album, but Disintegration not, despite the fact that, at 1:12:12, it’s just a minute shorter. Blame it on the confusing CD era. While I still favor Pornography (1982) and even Faith (1981), this is unsurprisingly considered by most as the band’s peak, as it’s a perfect balance of gloomy and gorgeous, pop and dirge. Goth and dream pop are bonus add-ons to their venerable post-punk, but on the strength of the trio of singles “Pictures of You,” “Lovesong” and “Fascination Street,” The Cure has transcended genre and become their own stadium-filling brand.\n\n6. Melvins – Ozma (Boner)\n\nWhile RYM tags Melvins’ second full-length as sludge metal, doom and grunge, the band defies categories. There were no words really to neatly describe the Melvins, because they were blazing trails, and also they were a freakin’ mess. Rhythms were unpredictable, switching from a slow trudge to explosive ferocity with no warning. King Buzzo’s vocals sounded like Bobcat Goldthwait having a breakdown. And while they would test fans’ patience with drones and other indulgences in the future, Ozma was also a really fun rock album.\n\n7. Nirvana – Bleach (Sub Pop)\n\nMudhoney was still my favorite Sub Pop band when Nirvana released their debut on June 15. I had it on a tape along with The Fluid and Cat Butt, and had no special expectations for them. However, their nice, chonky low-end sound influenced by their mates the Melvins got my attention, and Kurt’s voice held it. Come November, Mudhoney’s debut full-length failed to meet expectations, and Nirvana became the best band on the roster.\n\n8. Pixies – Doolittle (Elektra)\n\nI seemed to be in a minority thinking that the Pixies would never top Surfer Rosa (1988), but it goes to show how great they were that they could lose some of the untethered feral beauty of their debut but still multiply their fanbase with a batch of unforgettable songs. What they lost from moving on from the Steve Albini-assisted explosive noise rock, they gained in shimmering beauty worthy of the best bands on the 4AD label. The secret weapon wasn’t Kim Deal, who’s best work would come with the Breeders, but Joey Santiago’s surf noir guitar licks.\n\n9. Blue Nile – Hats (Virgin)\n\nI suspected the post-adult contemporary sophisti-pop of The Blue Nile was what “adulting” sounded like. Not quite. Adult live would never live up to the elegantly stylish and lush perfection of this meticulously recorded sophomore release, which the band spent five years on. In the 1980s, that’s a long time. RIYL: Robert Wyatt, John Cale, Tears For Fears, Talk Talk, Sade.\n\n10. Breathless – Chasing Promises (Tenor Vossa)\n\nDespite the fact that singer/keyboardist Dominic Appleton appeared on This Mortal Coil’s Filigree And Shadow (1986) and Blood (1991), Breathless are truly obscure. It seems the reason is that they released all seven of their albums themselves on their Tenor Vossa label. Running your own label isn’t always a bad choice if you do it right, like Dischord or Merge. But from the quality of their music it’s clear that had they signed to, say, 4AD, they could easily have been at least as successful as Cocteau Twins. The band has never released a weak album, including their most recent, See Those Colours Fly (2022). Schoolmates Appleton and guitarist Gary Mundy played together in A Cruel Memory before forming Breathless in the early 80s, rooted in the sweeping, anthem-like qualities of Echo & the Bunnymen and lush, darkly atmospheric stylings of The Chameleons. Their debut The Glass Bead Game (1985) sees them emerged fully formed and firing on all cylinders, while Chasing Promises (1989) is a fan favorite amongst their tiny cult audience. RIYL: Comsat Angels, Cocteau Twins, The Cure.\n\n11. Beastie Boys – Paul’s Boutique (Capitol)\n\nI was not a big fan of the Beastie Boys’ debut album. No matter how ironic their intentions in supposedly satirizing misogynist frat lout culture, they also inevitably embodied and promoted it. I engineered my life to stay far away from the douchebros. And yet, I did like hip hop, and the band’s growth on their second album was undeniable. The Dust Brothers had amassed a dense collection of sample heavy music, and when they were set to work with the band, they offered to strip it down so they could rhyme over it more easily. To their credit, they said leave the the complexity in, they’ll work until it works. And man, did it work, pushing the genre forward into new territory. Somehow, despite featuring several hundred samples and even several Beatles snippets, they were able to afford to license everything, or at least not get sued into oblivion. That situation quickly changed so most other artists did not have that opportunity to use such a dense, sample-heavy patchwork. So whether they deserved it or not, Beastie Boys’ landmark album was one of a kind.\n\n12. The The – Mind Bomb (Epic)\n\nI loved Matt Johnson’s first two albums as The The so much, it was puzzling why his third left me cold at first. Perhaps I was distracted by the fact that Johnny Marr joined forces with him, but there was no sign of his signature jangle riffs. This is smooth, sophisticated art pop with lyrics that still snap at your fingers, and continued to grow on me in subsequent decades.\n\n13. New Model Army – Thunder & Consolation (Capitol)\n\nConsidered by some as the new Clash, a title New Model Army at least deserves more than The Alarm, they released their masterpiece with their fourth album. Lead by legendary producer Tom Dowd (tons of jazz greats, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Cream, Allman Brothers), they balance their punk fury with anthemic folk rock. This should have been good enough to achieve close to U2 level success, but alas, it stalled at mere Waterboys level.

F/i formed in Milwaukee in 1981 as an electronic project influenced by early Cluster, Tangerine Dream, and industrial like Throbbing Gristle and SPK, they released a series of cassettes. By the time they released their first LP, Why Not Now? … Alan! (1987) they had evolved into a full-blown space rock band with amp shredding guitar noise and cosmic synth swoops. Their third albums sees them at a peak. The band reunited in 2005 and recorded Blanga, as well as remastering and reissuing the early albums on Lexicon Devil in 2006, adding two bonus tracks from their vast archives, “Satellite Surfer” and “Five Crowns of the Saxon King.” Australia’s Sorcerer records has put the first two on Bandcamp, and hopefully will do the same with this one and Blue Star (1990).

Green Monkey compiled most of their material on this collection, unearthing a potent mix of psych pop, jangle and fuzzed out grunge. It’s too band they didn’t stick together, they could have at least gotten the level of success as Screaming Trees. | Bandcamp\n\nXTC  Oranges And Lemons (Geffen) | UK\n\nChemistry Set  The Incomplete Fabulous Stinking (Green Monkey) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nThe Steppes  Enquire Within (Voxx/Music Maniac) | USA\n\nThe Crystal Set  Umbrella (Red Eye) | Australia\n\nPaul Roland  Duel (New Rose) | UK | Bandcamp\n\nUnion Carbide Productions  Financially Dissatisfied, Philosophically Trying (Radium) | Sweden\n\nTears For Fears  The Seeds Of Love (Fontana) | UK\n\nTelevision Personalities  Privilege (Fire) | UK | Bandcamp\n\nTyrnaround  Succeeds When Daylight Fails (PolyEster) | UK\n\nThe Deep Freeze Mice  The Tender Yellow Ponies of Insomnia (Cordelia) | UK\n\nThee Hypnotics  Live’r Than God (Sub Pop) | UK\n\nNoir (Folk, Garage, Psych, Punk, Surf)\n\nIt was no easy task matching Eleventh Dream Day’s absolutely scorching debut Prairie School Freakout (1988), and basically they didn’t. The major label debut sands down the rough edges in a subtle but still noticeable manner, making the guitars more beefy but less unruly. And the sprawling Gun Club/Crazy Horse epic jams are reigned in. In hindsight, the compromises done for Atlantic were a waste of time, as they never caught on to a wider audience. They went back to making excellent indie albums a couple times a decade and playing occasional shows mostly in their hometown of Chicago. But in retrospect, they’ve rarely matched the best songs here, which make up just over half the album.\n\nThe New Christs  Distemper (Citadel) | Australia\n\nCrime & The City Solution  The Bride Ship (Mute) | Australia\n\nEleventh Dream Day  Beet (Atlantic) | USA\n\nDead Moon  Unknown Passage (Tombstone/Music Maniac) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nSnatches Of Pink  Dead Men (Dog Gone) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nStone By Stone  I Pass For Human (SST) | USA\n\nProg\n\nProg wasn’t on a lot of people’s radar in 1989, but there was some very interesting crossover happening with metal bands. Case in point, Montreal’s Voivod, who evolved from early speed metal in 1982 to thrash, to a trilogy of wildly creative fusions of technical thrash and avant-garde metal, prog on Killing Technology (1987) and Dimension Hatröss (1988), and on their latest, even some post-punk and post-hardcore. Down in Austin, Watchtower was doing similarly impressive things, but wouldn’t get much credit until long after their sole two albums were released.\n\nVoivod  Nothingface (Mechanic) | Canada\n\nSavatage  Gutter Ballet (Atlantic) | USA\n\nKing Diamond  Conspiracy (Roadrunner) | Denmark | Bandcamp\n\nWatchtower  Control And Resistance (Noise) | USA\n\nToxik  Think This (Roadrunner) | USA\n\nCardiacs  On Land And In The Sea (Alphabet) | UK | Bandcamp\n\nFates Warning  Perfect Symmetry (Metal Blade) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nMekong Delta  Principles Of Doubt (Aaarrg) | Germany\n\nDevil Doll  The Girl Who Was… Death (Hurdy Gurdy) | Slovenia\n\nMarillion  Seasons End (EMI) | UK\n\nKing’s X  Gretchen Goes to Nebraska (Atlantic) | USA\n\nRush  Presto (Atlantic) | Canada\n\nPunk & Post-Punk\n\nPost-Punk was mutating in fascinating ways in 1989, and given that the top six from this list were also in the overall Lucky 13, I was all in. My Dad Is Dead started as a one man project by Chapel Hill via Cleveland’s Mark Edwards as a morose, Joy Division influenced tribute to his deceased father. His vocals, songwriting, arrangements and recording improved with every album, and his fifth, a double album, is Edwards at his peak, adding diverse elements like jangle pop, with an assist from Chris Burgess (bass, production) of Prisonshake. A remixed version with bonus tracks was reissued in 2014, sounding better than ever. 30 years later, it’s charms continue to unfold.\n\nFugazi  13 Songs (Dischord) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nThe New Christs  Distemper (Citadel) | Australia\n\nNoMeansNo  Wrong (Alternative Tentacles) | Canada | Bandcamp\n\nThe Cure  Disintegration (Elektra) | UK\n\nMelvins  Ozma (Boner) | USA\n\nNirvana  Bleach (Sub Pop) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nBreathless  Chasing Promises (Tenor Vossa) | UK\n\nNew Model Army  Thunder & Consolation (Capitol) | UK\n\nBitch Magnet  Umber (Communion) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nMy Dad Is Dead  The Taller You Are, The Shorter You Get (Homestead) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nBad Brains  Quickness (Caroline) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nNaked Raygun  Understand?

Compared to that, their debut full length was actually a big disappointment. It lacked the explosive power and originality of the EP, instead relying too much on Stooges influences, and even plagiarizing Blue Cheer (“Magnolia Caboose Babyshit” is an uncredited cover of “Magnolia Caboose Babyfinger”). Nevertheless, compared to their later even more uninspired albums, this at least reminds us of what could have been. Garage punkers Bored! from the small but feisty Geelong scene in Australia (a book was just released about it, just $215) demonstrate what SHOULD have been. They too had a promising EP in 1988, and their scorching debut was much more satisfying. With five entries in the top ten Australia was kicking all kinds of ass.\n\nThe New Christs  Distemper (Citadel) | Australia\n\nPixies  Doolittle (Elektra) | USA\n\nCosmic Psychos  Go The Hack (Sub Pop) | Australia\n\nBored!  Negative Waves (Bang!) | Australia\n\nMudhoney  Mudhoney (Sub Pop) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nGod  For Lovers Only (Au-Go-Go) | Australia\n\nCrime & The City Solution  The Bride Ship (Mute) | Australia\n\nEleventh Dream Day  Beet (Atlantic) | USA\n\nThe Steppes  Enquire Within (Voxx/Music Maniac) | USA\n\nThe Cynics  Rock ‘n’ Roll (Get Hip) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nDead Moon  Unknown Passage (Tombstone/Music Maniac) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nThe Telescopes  7th# Disaster EP (Cheree) | UK | Bandcamp\n\nThe Original Sins  The Hardest Way (Skyclad ) | USA\n\nHard Rock\n\nMy favorite albums by The Cult are Love (1985) and Electric (1987), but the fan favorite appears to be their fourth album, produced by Bob Rock. It took me a while to get on board with it, but when I saw The Cult perform Love in it’s entirety a decade ago, the tracks from Sonic Temple were a fun encore. If ever an album should have pushed them into mainstream stardom it would have been this. But the end of the 80s was a weird time of transition, as heavy metal was evolving into death metal, technical trash and dozens of other extreme subgenres, glam rock making way for alt rock (Jane’s Addiction were kind of both) and grunge. They got some spins on MTV with “Fire Woman,” “Edie (Ciao Baby)” and “Sun King,” and were at least able to headline medium sized venues if not stadiums.\n\nBullet Lavolta  The Gift (Taang! ) | USA\n\nThe Cult  Sonic Temple (Sire) | UK\n\nSoundgarden  Louder Than Love (A&M) | USA\n\nAlice Cooper  Trash (Epic) | USA\n\nKingdom Come  In Your Face (Polydor) | Germany\n\nTesla  The Great Radio Controversy (Geffen) | USA\n\nMeat Puppets  Monsters (SST) | USA\n\nBadlands  Badlands (Atlantic) | USA\n\nKing’s X  Gretchen Goes to Nebraska (Atlantic) | USA\n\nDrivin’ n’ Cryin’  Mystery Road (Island) | USA\n\nSkid Row  Skid Row (Atlantic) | USA\n\nQueen  The Miracle (EMI) | UK\n\nGiant  Last of the Runaways (A&M) | USA\n\nHeavy Metal\n\nBlack Sabbath’s popularity kind of hit a nadir in the late 80s with two of their least rated albums, Seventh Star (1986, originally meant to be an Iommi solo album) and The Eternal Idol (1987). Their fourteenth album didn’t fare much better commercially, partly due to having one of the least iconic singers, Tony Martin. While he’s not as strong a personality as Ozzy or Dio, he did a fine job, and in hindsight this album is grossly underrated. Along with Dehumanizer (1992), it’s one of the essential late period Sabbath albums, and arguably much better than Ozzy Osbourne’s solo albums from that period.\n\nBubbling under: Titan Force, Lizzy Borden, X, Scanner, Viper, Anthem, Heavens Gate, Rage. | More.\n\nMetal Church  Blessing In Disguise (Elektra) | USA\n\nRunning Wild  Death Or Glory (EMI/Noise) | Germany\n\nSavatage  Gutter Ballet (Atlantic) | USA\n\nHelstar  Nosferatu (Metal Blade/Roadracer) | USA\n\nCloven Hoof  A Sultans Ransom (HR) | UK\n\nBlack Sabbath  Headless Cross (IRS) | UK\n\nKing Diamond  Conspiracy (Roadrunner) | Denmark | Bandcamp\n\nCandlemass  Tales Of Creation (Enigma/Peaceville) | Sweden\n\nW.A.S.P.  The Headless Children (Capitol) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nTestament  Practice What You Preach (Atlantic) | USA\n\nLost Breed  Wino Daze (At War With False Noise) | USA\n\nPaul Chain  Life And Death (Minotauro) | Italy | Bandcamp\n\nAlice Cooper  Trash (Epic) | USA\n\nPower Metal, Epic Adventure & Symphonic/Dark Romance Metal\n\nHeavy metal runs deep in the veins of German bands to the point that power metal flourished and never went away.

So it makes sense that Sub Pop would pick up their second, and probably best album. Obviously, even more than the mighty Godflesh and even Ministry, Nine Inch Nails would take the industrial world by storm with their debut, which mixed industrial rock, synthpop and The The influenced songs with the angst turned to 11. But I preferred the much more wild and edgy Tragic Mulatto from San Francisco, who’s potent mix of noise, post-hardcore, art punk and free jazz seemed to point to the future. I was wrong, they would be forgotten after their third album, but I still prefer them over NIN.\n\nAs mentioned in the 1988 Lucky 13, Caspar Brötzmann Massaker, who topped last year’s list, would improve on second album Black Axis.

Kate Bush’s sixth album followed up her most acclaimed album, Hounds of Love (1985), and was considered by most a disappointment. But in retrospect, the problem was with the listeners, not the artist. Bush was 30 years old and accomplished exactly what she set out for, an atmospheric album that explores lush sound textures and sensuality. The album includes her early mentor David Gilmour, the spectral Bulgarian Trio Bulgarka on backing vocals, and Celtic and Middle Eastern sounds. Nothing that could soundtrack a climactic scene in Stranger Things, but most certainly has provided the background for other types of, uh, climaxes.\n\nI was a massive fan of When Iowa native Julee Cruise was employed by soundtrack composer Angelo Badalamenti as a talent scout, she was at the right place at the right time to contribute music to David Lynch’s Twin Peaks franchise. Initially dismissed as just trendy elevator music, her debut album was more than that, becoming a well-studied influence of ambient pop, dream pop and ethereal wave, with plenty of dramatic surprises within the soothing textures.\n\nBubbling under: Love And Rockets, Tears For Fears, Microdisney, Nona Hendryx, The Beautiful South, Devil Doll, Peter Gabriel, Howard Jones, Danny Wilson, China Crisis, Swans, The Creatures. | More.\n\nThe Cure  Disintegration (Elektra) | UK\n\nThe Blue Nile  Hats (A&M/Virgin) | UK\n\nThe The  Mind Bomb (Epic) | UK\n\nKate Bush  The Sensual World (EMI) | UK\n\nHugo Largo  Mettle (Opal) | USA\n\nThe Band of Holy Joy  Manic, Magic, Majestic (Rough Trade) | UK | Bandcamp\n\nJulee Cruise  Floating Into the Night (WB) | USA\n\nA.C.

Using Steve Albini on four of the tracks and some prickly noise rock guitar, they threw some fans for a loop that may have hindered any mainstream crossover potential. Nevertheless, it’s a great album, and is a lot more fun than much of the Britpop that would follow.\n\nOne of my random vivid memories from 30 years ago was running into my old freshman floormate at Motor Oil Cafe/Speedboat Gallery. He had a sweet set up, bringing in his own furniture and even an expresso machine. We’d listen to things like Felt and Monochrome Set. He raved to me about the new British band The Stone Roses. I liked his previous recommendations, so I quickly sought it out, only to be underwhelmed. I liked the psych and jangle pop bits, but they had become the figureheads of one of the worst new developments in music at the time, Baggy. Nevertheless I’ve reluctantly returned to it to glean why it would inspire such rapid devotion, and it mostly holds up as a good indie pop album, even though the band hit a wall trying to follow it up.\n\nBubbling under: The Windbreakers, The Brilliant Corners, The Lilac Time, Throwing Muses, Miracle Legion, Love Tractor, McCarthy, Green. | More.\n\nThe Wedding Present  Bizarro (RCA) | UK\n\nFelt  Me And A Monkey On The Moon (Cherry Red) | UK\n\nMy Dad Is Dead  The Taller You Are, The Shorter You Get (Homestead) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nThe Stone Roses  The Stone Roses (Silvertone) | UK\n\nThe Mighty Lemon Drops  Laughter (Sire) | UK\n\nAdrian Borland and the Citizens  Alexandria (SPV) | UK\n\nThe Band of Holy Joy  Manic, Magic, Majestic (Rough Trade) | UK | Bandcamp\n\nXTC  Oranges And Lemons (Geffen) | UK\n\nAndy Pawlak  Shoebox Full Of Secrets (Fontana) | UK\n\nLowlife  Godhead (Nightshift/LTM) | UK\n\nThe Smithereens  11 (Enigma) | USA\n\nThe Crystal Set  Umbrella (Red Eye) | Australia\n\nThe Rainyard  A Thousand Days (Pretty Olivia) | Australia | Bandcamp\n\nGlobal, Reggae, Dub & Afrobeat\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan & Party started releasing cassettes of his traditional Qawwali music with his uncle Mubarak Ali Khan in 1973. Somewhere in the process of releasing 50 of these he became the most revered singer of this style, and thanks to Peter Gabriel’s Real World label, he finally was introduced to Western audiences with a well recorded introduction to his music. He would soon experiment with non-traditional instruments, synths and arrangements on subsequent audiences to appeal to white audiences, with varying success. For those looking for a pretty authentic representation, this Shahen-Shah (Brightest Star) and the double Love & Devotion (1992) set are the places to start.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan  Shahen-Shah (Real World) | Pakistan | Bandcamp\n\nMahlathini & The Mahotella Queens  Paris – Soweto (Polydor) | South Africa\n\nPeter Gabriel  Passion (Geffen) | UK | Bandcamp\n\nYoussou N’Dour  The Lion (Virgin) | Senegal\n\nMano Negra  Puta’s Fever (Virgin) | France\n\nFela Kuti & Egypt 80  Beasts Of No Nation (Universal) | Nigeria | Bandcamp\n\nDiblo Dibala With Loketo  Super Soukous (Shanachie) | Congo\n\nMaleem Mahmoud Ghania  Mahmoud Guinia (Tichkaphone) | Morocco\n\nDavid Byrne  Rei Mono (Luaka Bop) | USA\n\nFemi Kuti & The Positive Force  No Cause For Alarm?

Sure, Depeche Mode had become global stars, but in general the style was out of fashion outside of various horrid dance fads that I don’t have the stomach to revisit right now. The early minimal synth (characterized by a “bleak and naive aesthetic” per RYM) cassette debut by Sweden’s Art Fact, in contrast, is charming as hell.\n\nThe Blue Nile  Hats (A&M/Virgin) | UK\n\nMadonna  Like A Prayer (Sire) | USA\n\nNew Order  Technique (Qwest/WB) | UK\n\nXymox  Twist of Shadows (Wing) | Germany\n\nArt Fact  In Fact (Sing Your Life!) | Sweden | Bandcamp\n\nStan Ridgway  Mosquitos (Geffen) | USA\n\nSwing Out Sister  Kaleidoscope World (Fontana) | UK\n\nErasure  Wild!

Here fifth album offers a pioneering hybrid of pop soul and art pop, while pointing forward to future trends in ambient pop. It’s her most adventurous and best album. 28 years later she would record an album of amazing Captain Beefheart covers with Gary Lucas!.

Rather than progress from there, as good as their subsequent albums may have been, they seemed to retreat into a more defensive posture as they were constrained by expectations. Because how dare they be joyous and irreverent.\n\nBubbling under: Kool G Rap & DJ Polo, Ice-T, L.L.

It’s hard to nail down exactly what the prolific Paul Roland specializes in, but suffice to say that folk rock is one of the elements on this album, his fourth. His gothy, theatrical art rock also has had one-time labelmate Robyn Hitchcock describe him as the male Kate Bush.

I didn’t know much about Miracle Legion from New Haven, CT, but I taped it at the radio station to get better acquainted. It was stolen from the studio when I stepped out, and probably at least fifteen years passed before I got around to finally hearing it. By then it already had become a kind of folky jangle pop cult classic, for good reason.\n\nSouled American  Flubber (Rough Trade ) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nMiracle Legion  Me And Mr. Ray (Rough Trade) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nJayhawks  Blue Earth (Twin/Tone) | USA\n\nTom Petty  Full Moon Fever (MCA) | USA\n\nDrivin’ n’ Cryin’  Mystery Road (Island) | USA\n\nGiant Sand  Long Stem Rant (Homestead) | USA\n\nNeil Young  Freedom (Reprise) | Canada\n\nJazz, Jazz Fusion\n\nI didn’t listen to a ton of current jazz at the time, but one artist I was well into was John Zorn. From his adventurous avant-garde takes on Spaghetti Westerns (The Big Gundown, 1986) and film noir soundtracks (Spillaine, 1987) to his incredible Naked City (1990) project that incorporates grindcore metal and brutal prog, he was the most exciting artist for me. This album is a tribute to the great Ornette Coleman that skips the traditional and also veers into grindcore territory at times.\n\nJohn Zorn  Spy Vs.

Over in Chapel Hill, Bitch Magnet took those ingredients and honed them down to something more precise, with finely tuned dynamics and a touch of melody. With Slint and Bastro exploring similar sounds, something interesting was definitely brewing.\n\nSquirrel Bait were a huge favorite on my early Bucket O’ Nasties radio shows, and I was gutted when they broke up. However from the ashes of the Louisville, KY band arose something strange and unique, largely instrumental noise rock with occasional spoken words and shouting. Slint’s debut may have been formative, but the new direction would be hugely influential. Interestingly, some of the lower end guitar tones and chord shapes resembled some of Godflesh’s material from the same time. Something was in the air, which would eventually form into post-rock and post-metal.\n\nSon of legendary free jazz saxophonist Peter, Caspar Brötzmann Massaker’s free jazz guitar playing came of age in the Berlin post-punk/goth scene, with an impressively sprawling, largely improvised second album that’s just about as powerful as Einstürzende Neubauten’s post-industrial music.\n\nNoMeansNo  Wrong (Alternative Tentacles) | Canada | Bandcamp\n\nBitch Magnet  Umber (Communion) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nSlint  Tweez (Jill) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nEinstürzende Neubauten  Haus der Luege (Rough Trade/Thirsty Ear) | Germany\n\nCaspar Brötzmann Massaker  Black Axis (Marat/Southern Lord) | Germany | Bandcamp\n\nMinistry  The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste (Sire) | USA\n\nNine Inch Nails  Pretty Hate Machine (TVT/Halo) | USA\n\nHelios Creed  The Last Laugh (Amphetamine Reptile) | USA\n\nBastro  Diablo Guapo (Homestead) | USA\n\nHelios Creed  Superior Catholic Finger (Subterranean) | USA\n\nPrimus  Suck on This (Caroline) | USA\n\nSevered Heads  Rotund for Success (Nettwerk) | Australia\n\nOxbow  Fuckfest (Hydra Head) | USA | Bandcamp\n\nLabels\n\nVirgin (11)\n\nEnigma (9)\n\nRough Trade (9)\n\nWB (9)\n\nFlying Nun (8)\n\nSST (7)\n\nSire (7)\n\nCreation (6)\n\nTouch and Go (5)\n\nA&M (5)\n\nAmerican (5)\n\n4AD (4)\n\nSub Pop (4)\n\nSingles\n\nNah.\n\nVideos\n\nShows\n\nMany of the bands I saw that year were friends playing on campus or basement house parties.\n\nThe Feelies (The Orpheum)\n\nFugazi (7th St. Entry)\n\nNirvana (Uptown Bar)\n\nThe Pixies (7th St. Entry)\n\nEleventh Dream Day (7th St. Entry)\n\nNoMeansNo (Speedboat Gallery)\n\nNaked Raygun (7th St. Entry)\n\nLou Reed (The Orpheum)\n\nWalt Mink\n\nSoul Asylum (First Avenue)\n\nRun Westy Run (U of MN)\n\nBone Club (7th St. Entry)\n\nThe Draghounds\n\nMovies\n\nThis was a particularly great year for movies, full of all-time favorites. The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is one of my top three from one of the best directors, Terry Gilliam (Monty Python, Time Bandits, Brazil). Amazing surrealist humor, an unhinged cameo from Robin Williams, and Uma Thurman, who would haunt my 19 year-old brain, for, well, decades. I love Meet the Feebles nearly as much, though most people I’ve shared it with are traumatized. It really needs a blu ray remaster though, as the sound on my DVD is terrible.\n\nThe Adventures Of Baron Munchausen – Terry Gilliam (fantasy/comedy)\n\nMeet The Feebles – Peter Jackson (comedy)\n\nSay Anything – Cameron Crowe (comedy/romance)\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally – Rob Reiner (comedy/romance)\n\nSex, Lies & Videotape – Steven Soderbergh (drama)\n\nHeathers – Michael Lehmann (black comedy)\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas – Tim Burton (drama)\n\nThe Unbelievable Truth – Hal Hartley (drama)\n\nDrugstore Cowboy – Gus Van Sant (drama)\n\nJésus de Montréal – Denys Arcand (drama)\n\nNew York Stories – Various (drama)\n\nKiki’s Delivery Service – Hayao Miyazaki (anime)\n\nThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover – Peter Greenaway (black comedy)\n\nBubbling under: How To Get Ahead In Advertising, My Left Foot, Metropolitan, Earth Girls Are Easy, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Mystery Train, Santa Sangre, Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser,\n\nTelevision\n\nI was in college and watched almost zero TV that year, with the exception of MTV’s 120 Minutes, hosted at the time by Dave Kendall.\n\nBooks\n\nAs a kid I was a voracious reader of sci fi and fantasy, but college somehow rewired my brain and I mostly lost my taste for it beyond those with comedic elements. Too much post-structuralist theory perhaps broke my brain. Nevertheless, Dan Simmons’ brooding, harrowing Hyperion got under my skin, and that goddam Shrike.
