        "text": "The Union Trade : Why we need Night.\n\nCinematic post-rock. The Union Trade follow the contours of proven terrain and map the outlines of an evolving sound. In moments throughout, the band strips away the epic layers of their first album to expose the intimacy of a beautiful guitar line, the gravity of a simple piano progression, or the emotion and lyricism of a vocal performance. Energized by dynamic rhythms, the EP progresses from the familiar into new territory marked by a broader range of analog and acoustic keyboards, electronic elements and The Union Trade's most concise song structures to date. \"Why We Need Night\" captures The Union Trade as they continue to define the space where instrumental rock influences meet a more mainstream indie rock sound.
