        "text": "For nearly one century of media, the cheerleader has been one of the most persistent tropes in pop culture. Cheerleaders are always depicted as the most popular, attractive, and dominant forces in any school. They sit atop the social hierarchy and look down upon their fawning masses with a strange mix of pity and admiration. For a school full of teenagers, the death of a cheerleader would be tantamount to England losing their queen; it’s a loss that would make their respective domains stand still. Death of a Cheerleader takes this dynamic and upends it in a collection of 14 poppy indie rock tracks that reframe this all-too-familiar narrative with a definitively queer perspective.\n\nIn its best moments, Cheerleader feels like an assembly of cult faves funneled through a pastel-colored pep rally lens. Whether taking visual inspiration from films like Heathers and The Virgin Suicides or channeling iconic left-field creatives like John Waters and David Lynch, the album still feels like it was created with a holistic perspective. Song topics range from things as heavy as questioning gender roles and weathering abusive relationships but still maintain the energy of a cheerleader facing the crowd during the first homecoming game. In the album’s most simple moments, the songs can feel like a reminder to allow yourself to indulge in rage or simply feel emotions in the first place. Most notably, a cover of “Crimson and Clover” sits smack dab in the middle of the tracklist, echoing Joan Jett’s famous gender-swapping cover from 40 years earlier. Whether consumed in one sitting or snacking on the album’s bite-sized singles, Death of a Cheerleader is an undeniable new landmark for queer poppy indie rock.\n\nQuick Hits\n\nHoly Profane - Jettison Yr Dreams - The latest album from Holy Profane tackles disillusionment, disjointed memories, and the hangover of youthful folk punk idealism.\n\nDanny Elfman - Big Mess - Essentially the closest we’ll ever get to a Nightmare Before Christmas sequel.\n\nSleater-Kinney - Path of Wellness - A back-to-basics course-correction after 2019’s disastrous The Center Won’t Hold.\n\nWolf Alice - Blue Weekend - Explosive and ever-shifting, Blue Weekend effortlessly winds its way from heartfelt ballads, soaring indie rock, and sneering punk rock with impressive finesse.\n\nMigos - CULTURE III - The third entry in the Culture series comes after a trifecta of solo albums and omnipresent trap features over the last few years.
