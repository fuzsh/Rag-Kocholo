        "text": "Ritual Union was back for the 3rd edition of Bristol's best multi-venue festival. The festival sees over 50 acts playing in independent venues in close proximity to Bristol’s city centre and each other. SWX, Strange Brew, Rough Trade, and The Island played host to a diverse mix of music for over 12 hours.\n\nI arrived early at SWX to catch Bristol’s very own Noisy Punk band Mould upstairs on the SWX 2 stage. They are exactly that! They blew the cobwebs out of my ears, eyes and face. Despite Singer Jo claiming to be a “Little Hoarse” before the gig, he sang like a true punk rocker thoroughbred, proving midday is not too early to be in a dark room screaming your heart out. They flew through their set which set the bar high for the rest of the acts to try to maintain. Bird Song drives like an HST - it twists, bends and breaks strings as it speeds along and is a must-listen. I attained two Mould badges after the show, which may make me their biggest fan ever. What a start to the day!\n\nI stayed in Place at SWX 2 where Handcuff picked up the punk rock baton and sprinted with it seamlessly, complementing Mould’s start. All I could think to myself was “this is awesome!” I think they played a 12-song set in half an hour with songs both from their debut self-titled EP and new single which was ‘loud-in-your-face punk rock’ with plenty of smiling in-between. I think I got a setlist but it may be a Poem? This band should surely tour with Mould, what a double act that would be!\n\nI then found myself bumping into gig friends left right and centre, some of which had big fur coats on and some shared some rum, nothing strange there, it is Bristol after all! The Bristol’s gig community seemed to have congregated in Strange Brew to catch Oslo Twins. It was finally time to take a breather, for my ears to recover with something far more chilled. Oslo twins filled the room with Synths, Smoke and Soul with the band happily experimenting with new tracks, this being their first show back for a while. Their music has a soothing calming sensibility as the songs glide. Claudia Vulliamy’s vocals on ‘The Edge’ are an embodiment of all of the above.\n\nWith so much to see, I was keen to leave and catch something random somewhere else. As I walked across to to leave, Pem took to the stage at Strange Brew. She had a voice that stopped me in my tracks and I didn't care what else was on, I had to stay put. ‘Lullaby London’ is pure beauty, and is stored on my phone instantly as one to remember. Getting goosebumps from an act you've not heard before is quite a feeling. I was left in awe come the end, what a discovery!\n\nAfter an overpriced, and quite frankly pointless jagerbomb shared with a friend, Liz Lawrence is up next on the main stage back over at SWX with the sets now stretching out a little longer to a full hour. She lit up the room with an indie-pop sensibility and sense of humour throughout. The songs I'd been listening to before this festival came alive to become songs to rejoice in, ‘I Wish I Was There’ becomes an anthem when performed live. I'm drawn to my left where there is an obsessive dancer and lyric reciter who is well into it. You can’t blame him, as Liz Lawrence turns this from a festival to a party. I’ll be going to her next show in Bristol in November at Strange Brew for sure.\n\nFrom the relative serentity downstairs, I pop back upstairs to see the Bristol’s highly recommended Knives…. JESUS CHRIST THEY BLEW MY SOCKS OFF! Knives mix noise with humour and about 200 high kicks to boot! The set is chaotic and had me predictably getting carried away, surfing the crowd backwards but disappointingly not all the way to the bar. There were paper planes, heavy sarcastic posing and hardcore mosh pits throughout their set. I had so much fun with yet another discovery. Their cover of Kate Bush’s ‘Babooshka’ is a delight. I can't work out whether they like the song or not, but it’s class either way. As singer Jay Schottlander leapt into the crowd to get involved halfway through ‘Headcase’ screaming, “I’m a Headcase, I'm a bastard, I’m a punk!!”. Saxophonist Maddy Hill strokes dramatic poses and glues the band together as Knives manage to be aggressive whilst not taking themselves too seriously. Right up my street. Ace!\n\nMasca took to the SWX 2 stage next and was yet another great recommendation from a friend, who was highly biased knowing the band and wearing a Masca T-shirt proudly throughout the day, His face was beaming throughout as the Bristol-based trio wowed a very appreciative and sweaty crowd playing old and new tracks. ‘Sweet Tooth’ is pop rock perfection and makes it very hard not to dance to. The show ended with a crescendo of fuzzy noise and my friend is handed the bass guitar to do with what he likes!"
