        "text": "The Clark Family invites you to enjoy a day of FAMILY FUN! Where else can you watch a famous Black Bear Show, be chased by the Infamous Wolfman while on a train, plus enjoy great rides and museums?\n\nGuests like to cool off on the Water Blaster Boats, scale the walls of the Old Man Climbing Tower and learn to glide on a Segway. The Anaconda Escape water raft ride will speed you through 300 feet of twists and turns. Merlin will turn your world upside-down and will keep you wondering, \"What just happened?\" From late June through Labor Day the Yandong Chinese Acrobats will amaze you with their contortion, balancing, and agility!\n\nThere are five museums to enjoy on the Victorian Main Street and four Specialty Shops to browse where you are sure to find a treasure or two. Kids love to dip their own candles or create a wax jar candle, much like sand art. Christmas ornaments are available to be personalized and you can even create your own stuffed animal. Everyone likes to mine for gemstones or fossils at the River City Mining Sluice. Don't forget to buy a popgun and candy at the Maple Cabin before your train ride.\n\nExplore our website and see all the excitement that awaits your next visit."
