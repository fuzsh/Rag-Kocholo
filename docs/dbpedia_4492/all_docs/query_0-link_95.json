        "text": "What’s NEW? Just this week, treated to the newest releases from Native Lights (self-titled debut album out March 17 on Passive Recordings), the full-length album from Winter, Supreme Blue Dream, full of shimmering reverb-drenched pop songs, and the brand new Pointless EP from Light FM (out today!). Speaking of shimmering, we’re going deep with the new post-rock shoegaze textures from The Union Trade, whose A Place of Long Years shows a grand return to form, and features occasional guest vocals from Ann Yu of (staff favorites) Silver Swans. That’s a can’t-lose proposition no matter how you look at it. The debut album from Italy’s Human Colonies, whose Calvary LP only cements their position as impressive artists. Not content with just that, we’ll sprinkle in new music from Mexico’s Bleak Boys, and New York’s Malka. Plus we’ll go deep with a release we missed last August, but simply cannot be ignored: Stockton’s Monster Treasure, with a self-titled album that caught us entirely off-guard. Fuzzy guitars plus Lush-like harmonies equals pure win. New music from Crush. And we’ll probably be stuffing buy metronidazole tablets online more in right up to air time. As we do.\n\nAnd of course, we’re not forgetting Winnebago, Boca River, Princess, Westkust, Cherry Crush, Carnival Animals, Satsuma, Angel Falls, Wall of Stars, Alter, Jennie Vee, Kimono Lights, Honey Frequency, Fury Things, Brilliant Beast, mandarinaduck, Flashes, Cheatahs, Depth & Current, Venera 4 and more. All of the things.\n\n8 pm Eastern, 5 pm Pacific, and continuing through Sunday at midnight Eastern, 9 Pacific. It’s the first weekend we’ll spin some of these tracks, and may be the last weekend for some others. Live365 listeners: it’s your votes that count!
