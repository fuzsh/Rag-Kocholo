        "text": "Ready for another edition of Tattoo Talk? Today, we feature a recent conversation with Crispin Earl, the tatted-up frontman of Vancouver hard rock band The Veer Union. After fourteen years together, and several studio albums and EPs, the group is fully entrenched as one of today’s premiere, North American rock groups.\n\nThe band recently released their very first box set Decade: History of Our Evolution, a comprehensive collector’s item which features the six Decade albums, including demo and B-side discs. To promote the release, The Veer Union are currently out on the “Evolution Tour” which is sweeping across the U.S. until mid-October when they quickly shift gears and join up on “The RED Unstoppable Tour” until mid-November. We were able to snag a few minutes to speak to Crispin and ask him some specific questions regarding his many tattoos.\n\nOkay, so word on the street is that you have some pretty special tattoos. First off, how many do you have in total and what age did you first get inked?\n\nCrispin Earl: I have six in total and got my first tattoo when I was 19 years old.\n\nThe music video for “Living Not Alive,” literally just came out, off of Decade: II Rock & Acoustic!\n\nWhat tattoo do you have that you find to be the most appealing or pleasing to you personally?\n\nCrispin: I would say all of my tattoos have meaning to me, I have always felt that a tattoo should be a reflection of who you are, but my first tattoo was the Rebel Alliance symbol from Star Wars that myself and my best friends got all together. That will always be a special one to me cause it still means the same to me today as it did then.\n\nWhat is it about tattoos that make them so special for you? Do you find yourself attracted to them being an outlet for self-expression?\n\nCrispin: I think of tattoos the same way I think of a lyric. I believe it should speak to you from a place of meaning. My tattoos personify hope and struggle which is also what I write about lyrically a lot.\n\nHave your tattoos ever been the subject or topic of a Veer Union song?\n\nCrispin: I wouldn’t say specifically any tattoo no, but as a whole yes, because many songs I write are about finding the light in life and trying as hard as you can to hold on to it for as long as you can.\n\nCheck out some exclusive pics of Crispin’s tattoos here.\n\nDo you ever consider how your life may be different had you not decided to ever start getting tattoos?\n\nCrispin: Not really. To be honest, I think I would always be the same person to the core with or without tattoos, people around me may just have a slightly different perception based on judging my exterior, instead of the inner being.\n\nAlthough tattoos are really incredible works of art and self-expression, there are those who still look at them in a negative light. What would you say to anyone who may look down somewhat on those who have tattoos?\n\nCrispin: I would say, “This is 2018, welcome to the present” (laughs). They are here and more prevalent than ever.\n\nDo you think you’ll ever get sick of tattoos in general or do you feel it will remain a lifelong hobby or interest of yours?\n\nCrispin: I think when a person gets a tattoo it’s a commitment, and I have always stayed committed to my beliefs…. So, there shall be more to come for sure.\n\nYou just released your new album Decade II: Rock & Acoustic. Do you have any tattoos that are related to this album release?\n\nCrispin: Not at the moment, but it could definitely happen in the future!\n\nThe “Evolution Tour” Tour Dates:\n\n09/28 – Dirty Dog – Austin, TX\n\n09/29 – Jack’s Bar – San Antonio, TX\n\n10/03 – Boozer’s Rock Bar – Corpus Christi, TX\n\n10/04 – Ethos Live – Laredo, TX\n\n10/05 – BFE – Houston, TX\n\n10/06 – The Brick House – Houma, LA\n\n10/07 – Olde Towne Tavern – Slidell, LA\n\n10/10 – The Warrior – Tallahassee, FL\n\n10/11 – South Street City Oven & Grill – Naples, FL\n\n10/12 – West End Trading Company – Sanford, FL\n\n10/13 – Brass Mug – Tampa, FL\n\n10/14 – Nighthawks – Jacksonville, FL\n\n10/17 – Furnace 41 – Jonesboro, GA\n\n10/19 – Southern Shakers Bar & Grill – Summerville, SC\n\n10/20 – The Rabbit Hole – Charlotte, NC\n\n10/21 – Blind Tiger – Greensboro, NC\n\nCheck out the official lyric video for the recently released single “City of the Sun” below.\n\n“The RED Unstoppable Tour” Tour Dates:"
