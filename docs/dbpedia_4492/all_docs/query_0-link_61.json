        "text": "‘caroline’ by caroline Out Now\n\nThe self-titled debut album from London-based eight piece caroline is out now. On it, songs can cascade like an avalanche with the full force of so many instruments, squalling and rumbling on the edge of all-out collapse. At other times they slip back into impossibly fragile moments of quiet – a simple bassline or a rattle of snare the only sound amid a dark sea of silence. caroline know exactly the right balance between restraint and release. “Sometimes things sound much better when there’s empty space,” says Llewellyn. “Sometimes you might populate [a song] with too many things and forget that an element on its own is enough.” Listen now.\n\nOrder from our webstore available on Limited Edition Transparent Red Japanese Import LP + standard black) and you will receive a signed postcard and bonus poster illustrated by the band.
