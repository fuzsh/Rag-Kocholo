        "text": "The Union County Board of County Commissioners is excited to present a special performance by Five Against One, a tribute band dedicated to celebrating the music of Pearl Jam.\n\n“Echo Lake Park provides a beautiful backdrop for an evening of great music and relaxation with family or friends,” said Commissioner Chairwoman Kimberly Palmieri-Mouded. “We are excited to host Five Against One, so I encourage our residents to bring their yoga mats for a rejuvenating yoga session before the concert, and then settle in for an evening of live music with all of those who attend. See you there!”\n\nThis concert will take place on Wednesday, August 7th, at Echo Lake Park in Mountainside. The evening begins with a yoga session with Fearvana Yoga from Kenilworth at 6:30 p.m., followed by the concert at 7:30 p.m.\n\nFive Against One pays homage to Pearl Jam, one of the seminal bands of the Seattle grunge rock movement that captivated America in the early ‘90s. The band passionately re-creates iconic hits like “Yellow Ledbetter,” “Alive,” and “Better Man,” offering concertgoers a nostalgic journey back to that unforgettable era in music history.\n\nFor more information or updates about the 2024 Summer Arts Concert Series, visit www.ucnj.org/summer24."
