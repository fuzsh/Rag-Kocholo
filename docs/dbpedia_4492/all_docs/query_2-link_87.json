        "text": "Wild Animal Sanctuary\n\nDistance from Denver: 30 miles (48 km)\n\nLions, Tigers and Bears, Oh My! Visit this 320-acre rescue and educational facility, located just 30 miles outside of Denver, where more than 300 large carnivores roam free. The Wild Animal Sanctuary is one of the only places in America where you can see lion prides and groups of other carnivores living in natural habitats.\n\nCentral City\n\nDistance from Denver: 39 miles (64 km)\n\nHistoric Central City is nestled in the majestic Rocky Mountains, a short 39-mile scenic drive west of Denver. It is a quintessential Victorian Colorado town founded in 1859 during the Gold Rush era and offers a host of mountain activities, casinos, walking tours, dining, shopping and free parking.\n\nBlack Hawk\n\nDistance from Denver: 39 miles (64 km)\n\nBlack Hawk is home to a motherload of casinos with blackjack tables, craps, roulette, poker games and more than 10,000 slot machines. In 2009, gambling stakes were raised to $100, to the delight of high rollers, and casinos began opening their doors 24 hours a day. It's located near Central City. The two cities are also known for having some of the best-preserved Victorian architecture in the West.\n\nGeorgetown Loop Railroad\n\nDistance from Denver: 54 miles (87 km)\n\nThe Georgetown Loop Railroad is a reconstruction of one of Colorado's most famous railroads, which was originally built in 1877. Steam-powered locomotives make the climb up the valley and across Devil's Gate Bridge, giving riders panoramic views and a glimpse into Colorado's railroad-centric past. From the open-air viewing cars, it is possible to see bighorn sheep and other wildlife.\n\nMount Blue Sky Scenic Byway\n\nDistance from Denver: 60 miles (97 km)\n\nMount Blue Sky Scenic Byway is the highest paved auto road in North America, snaking its way to the 14,260-foot (4,346 m) summit. Please note: online reservations are now required for timed slots. The road is open only from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and frequently has snow on it, even in August. The view from the top takes in the entire Front Range. The summit is 60 miles (97 km) from downtown Denver. On your way up the mountain, be sure to stop at M. Walter Pesman Trail (maintained by Denver Botanic Gardens) for a wildflower hike; you won't see anything like the rare flowers and 1,500-year-old bristlecone pine trees anywhere else in the world. The trail winds through subalpine and alpine areas where wildflowers and animals of the fragile tundra live. Volunteer guides from Denver Botanic Gardens give interpreted hikes that follow the trail throughout the summer.\n\nRocky Mountain National Park\n\nDistance from Denver: 71 miles (114 km)\n\nOne of the U.S. National Park System's crown jewels, Rocky Mountain National Park features 400 square miles of scenic beauty, including Trail Ridge Road, the highest continuous highway in the world, crossing the Continental Divide at more than two miles above sea level. With hundreds of miles of hiking trails, tranquil lakes, waterfalls, wildlife and horseback riding, visiting the Park is a truly unforgettable experience. Estes Park is a resort town on the edge of the park with restaurants and shops.\n\nMountain Town Adventures Near Denver\n\nIdaho Springs\n\nDistance from Denver: 29 miles (47 km)\n\nIdaho Springs is the perfect spot to launch on a myriad of adventures close to Denver. Take a trip back into Colorado's gold mining history at the Argo Mill and Tunnel. If you're looking for adventure, Colorado Adventure Center offers eight zip lines, an aerial adventure park with more than 60 challenging elements and, along with Clear Creek Rafting Co., exciting rafting trips on Clear Creek. Nearby Lawson Adventure Park & Resort boasts cabins and yurts for rent, as well as a via ferrata, zip line, zorb balls, rafting, disc golf, ATV tours, fly-fishing and more.\n\nGeorgetown\n\nDistance from Denver: 42 miles (68 km)\n\nLocated west of Denver, Georgetown is a delightful Victorian village set in a spectacular mountain valley with 200 restored buildings from the 1870s. The main street has shops and restaurants, and many of the old homes have been turned into antique stores. The Georgetown Loop Railroad operates in the summer months with narrow-gauge steam locomotives curling down a mountain ledge, at one point crossing over a 90-foot-high (27 m) trestle.\n\nEvergreen\n\nDistance from Denver: 28 miles (45 km)\n\nAs its name hints, Evergreen is a pine tree–surrounded escape. A picturesque alpine lake is located right in town, with paddleboard, kayak and (in the winter) ice skate rentals available. You'll also want to hike the trails at Alderfer/Three Sisters Park — once a working ranch but now a hiker's paradise — and Flying J Ranch Park — formerly a runway for the area's onetime landowner but now a boon for hikers and bikers, with peaceful meadows, forests and wetlands. Historic downtown Evergreen is nestled right into the area's natural landscape and boasts a number of art galleries, shops and eateries. Spend the day golfing, hiking beautiful nature trails, touring small local museums, relaxing at day spas or catching a local theater performance.\n\nPikes Peak Country\n\nDistance from Denver: 60 miles (97 km)\n\nPikes Peak Country is located south of Denver and features more than 40 attractions centered around 14,000-foot-high (4,267 m) Pikes Peak. Things to see include the Air Force Academy, one of three United States military colleges; the famous Broadmoor Resort, with its lake and three golf courses; the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame, with its exhibits on this exciting professional sport; and Garden of the Gods, made of naturally formed, 500-foot-high (152 m) red sandstone rock monuments at the base of Pikes Peak.\n\nColorado Ski Country: Summit County, Vail and Beaver Creek"
