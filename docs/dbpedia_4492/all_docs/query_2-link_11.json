        "text": "Baggins is back with Ranges, baby!\n\nIt‚Äôs been aaaages. Last time I saw these guys was 2018. We‚Äôd planned on reuniting in 2020 but the pandemic cancelled those plans, and I was too cautious to try international travel when they next toured Europe in 2022. They‚Äôve released three albums since I last saw them: Babel (2019), Cardinal Winds (2021) and 33 (2023), as well as re-releasing ‚ÄúNight & Day‚Äú, the release that first introduced me to Ranges. So I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing them play some fresh material.\n\nA few updates since I last toured with Ranges: Jared the bass player moved to Ohio. And Joey on guitar moved to Idaho, where he is currently playing in a heavy band called Onsetter.\n\nSo Ranges are down to a core trio.\n\nWilson Raska contributes to the overall vision, concepts, and art. Seems a bit weird to include someone who doesn‚Äôt play the instruments, but anyone familiar with Ranges will know that their art and overall concepts are vital to who the band is. Wilson and CJ co-own A Thousand Arms ‚Äì a record label, printing workshop and distro. Chances are high that if you‚Äôre a post-rock fan, you‚Äôll have seen Wilson‚Äôs art on t-shirts or posters.\n\nCJ Blessum is the band dad. The most driven person I know. He‚Äôs the guy up at all hours, coordinating with people, running merch stalls, driving all through the night to get to the next gig. On top of that, he writes some pretty damn good post-rock music. CJ used to contribute to Will Not Fade now and again, and invited me to tour with Ranges across America in 2017. That was one of the greatest things to ever happen to me.\n\nAnd then we have Mark Levy. New York Hardcore drum legend. He‚Äôs a bit older than the others, and talks different, being from Brooklyn. And he is always the life of the party, and has a million amazing stories to share. He‚Äôs the guy I always turn to if I need drum advice.\n\nDamn, I‚Äôve really missed these guys. It‚Äôs amazing how spending time stuck in a van with a bunch of dudes for a few weeks can galvanise such friendships.\n\nLast time I came to Europe I was in an absolute state for the entire tour. One of my flights ‚Äì Auckland to Doha ‚Äì was the longest commercial flight in the world at the time. Jetlag hit me hard and I felt too out of sorts to really enjoy myself. So this time I‚Äôve opted to get to Europe a week earlier, hoping that the extra time would help me recover from jetlag before I join the band.\n\nAlso joining Ranges are Tim (guitar) and Tom (bass) from Astodan ‚Äì an incredible Belgian post-rock band who Ranges first played with back in 2018. Tim is keeps up with Mark in terms of being larger than life and also being a drummer in a bunch of other bands in Belgium. He also finds it very hard to understand my New Zealand accent, which leads to lots of confusion and big laughs. Tom is a lot quieter, but he is by far the funniest person of the group when he cracks a joke.\n\nWe also have sound engineer Chuck Goodwin, who has also made the trip from Montana to keep the guys sounding great, and Sean Oliver is the Fanta-loving driver from Utah, charged with transporting us in the huge van.\n\nDay 1\n\nMonday 6 May 2024\n\nRough Trade Bristol, Bristol, England\n\nw/ Fort, Din of Celestial Birds\n\nI flew into London a week before meeting up with them, and arranged to meet them in Bristol on the day of the first show. They‚Äôd spent some time in Belgium rehearsing with Tim and Tom from Astodan. We were due to meet at Rough Trade, the venue, at 4pm for load in. But they‚Äôd encounters issues when trying to come across the channel on the train. They‚Äôd been sent back to Belgian to obtain signatures that disclose something to do with taxes before they were allowed across into the UK. This put them way behind schedule and they were pushing it to make it to Bristol in time for their set.\n\nIn the meantime I introduced myself to the other two bands, and helped Nick the sound tech set up. The house drum kit was a Natal ‚Äì a brand I‚Äôd not encountered before. It was a really cool orange vistalite.\n\nI‚Äôd seen El Ten Eleven play at a Rough Trade in Brooklyn, New York in 2017, so I‚Äôm assuming it is a chain of record stores. It was a nice venue. There were loads of cool records and books and posters for sale, as you‚Äôd expect. The venue was a great size and I got along great with Nick the sound tech. They had these interesting extractor fans that Nick told me they had been required to install before reopening after the covid pandemic. They suck fresh air into the room and filter viruses out, or something along those lines.\n\nThe first band to play, FORT, are Welsh. I‚Äôd been in communication with them leading up to this and I found them very friendly. They are high energy and the best part was during the final song when Gavin jumped down into the audience with his guitar and they all went nuts during the big climactic part.\n\nDin of Celestial Birds are also playing dunk!fest at the end of the week, and have recently signed to A Thousand Arms. They give a more professional vibe, using backing tracks and even bringing their own fog machine and a lighting rig similar to the one Ranges had when I toured with them in the USA. There‚Äôs a lot more to take in, with six of them onstage.\n\nWe‚Äôd been nervous about when Ranges would arrive, given their big delay, but they arrived just in time. It was a rushed set up and line check, and then they played at their scheduled time. It was such a buzz to see the guys again after six years. It was mostly newer material that they‚Äôd written since I‚Äôd seen them last, but I got a bit emotional when they played a few Ascensionist songs. Tim and Tom were feeling a bit nervous about playing the set, being fill ins, but they did a stellar job and honestly, I don‚Äôt think anybody would have known that the band had only just arrived, or that they hadn‚Äôt played together much.\n\nAfter the gig we drove to Bath and stayed at a YMCA. I bunked with Tim, Tom and Chuck.\n\nDay 2\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024\n\nThe Deaf Institute, Manchester, England\n\nw/ Fort, Din of Celestial Birds\n\nBath was named after ancient Roman public baths that were situated there, taking advantage of the natural hot springs. Like many English cities, there were grand, stately buildings everywhere with ornate masonry. I gave Sean a hat I‚Äôd bought for him at Primark that had the Fanta logo all over it. He was chuffed. Sean is a Fanta connoisseur, and loves trying the Fanta in every country he goes to because they‚Äôre all slightly different. French and Belgian Fanta are among his favourites, and American Fanta is sadly not up to par. We spent the morning soaking in the hot pools and steaming in the saunas. It was a great relaxing way to start the day.\n\nSean had stayed somewhere else, and had managed to maim his left hand when returning the key to the lock box. He showed up at the van at the agreed time, with a bunch of bloody napkins held to his palm. We stopped in at an emergency room on the way to Manchester, but there was going to be at least a three hour wait, so we got some dressings at the pharmacy and continued on our journey.\n\nMark was quite excited to go to Manchester because he‚Äôs a fan of The Smiths. He insisted on having a photos taken outside the Salford Lad‚Äôs Club, which I thought was the name of a brothel. He wanted to replicate a photo from God Save The Queen, by The Smiths. I don‚Äôt really know much about it, but please enjoy this photo that I edited of Mark, Sean and I at the Lad‚Äôs Club.\n\nTonight‚Äôs venue was The Deaf Institute. The facade read ‚ÄúADULT DEAF & DUMB INSTITUTE‚Äù. Tom cracked a joke about there being a translator up the front to sign the lyrics, which was hilarious because all the bands are instrumental. There was another gig happening in the same building on the floor above.\n\nSean managed to get his hand seen to while we were setting up, which was a relief.\n\nI liked the venue but the stage was tiny. Two members of Din of Celestial Birds had to stand on the floor in front of the stage because there was no way all six of them would fit. The lighting was also terrible. But the show was good and the band sold lots of merch.\n\nLots of people had mentioned that Manchester is great to visit. I had a little wander round during soundcheck but didn‚Äôt really see enough to form an opinion. I did find a place with a huge MF Doom mask though, which I loved.\n\nAfter the gig we found a pizza joint that was still open after midnight, before heading back to the hotel we stayed at.\n\nDay 3\n\nWednesday 8 May 2024\n\nThe Portland Arms, Cambridge, England\n\nI would say this was the best day of the UK leg of the tour.\n\nWilson and I had matching shirts.\n\nWe stopped in at Croxden Abbey. I‚Äôve been seeing lots of old churches and castles during my time in the UK, but I still get super excited about it every time. Many have been bombed during the WWII, or fell casualty to prior wars. Henry VIII also disbanded many churches, convents etc when he formed the Church of England so that he could divorce his wife. I love walking amongst the old ruins, admiring the workmanship that is still so evident hundreds of years later, and getting the sense of history of those locations. We did some cool/cheesy photoshoots before grabbing lunch.\n\nLunch was at a quaint countryside tavern. We all ordered fish and chips. I didn‚Äôt think they were very good, but the others all loved the novelty of having such a distinctly English meal, complete with pints of ale, mushy peas, tartare sauce and lashings of malt vinegar.\n\nI really liked The Portland Arms, our venue for the night. The stage lighting was on point, Chuck had the sound dialed in, and the green room was a welcome haven where we could relax, charge our devices, and use WiFi.\n\nCJ took us on a walk around Cambridge. We climbed an old motte ‚Äì the hill from a former castle where they would have built the defensive keep. We walked around some university grounds (around, not through. They were very clear that visitors are unwelcome), and saw a small apple tree that is theoretically linked to Isaac Newton somehow. The place reminded me of Oxford, although nowhere near as impressive. We finished up with some great doner kebabs from a street vendor before heading back to the gig.\n\nI met a local photographer, Dobbin Thomas, who took some incredible shots of the night. He was happy for me to feature some here. Give him a follow: https://www.instagram.com/robin_dobbin_t\n\nFORT by Dobbin Thomas\n\nDin of Celestial Birds by Dobbin Thomas\n\nRanges by Dobbin Thomas\n\nAnd here are some of my photos below\n\nIt looked and sounded fantastic. Ranges really came together tonight and locked in well. Everyone was on a high.\n\nDay 4\n\nThursday 9 May 2024\n\nEn route to dunk!festival\n\nWe got up bright and early for a 7am departure. Touring can sound fun and glamourous, but the reality is often it means late nights, inadequate sleep, eating crappy food obtainable at petrol stations, spending all day in a van. Sometimes it wears you down. We spent hours at customs. The government wanted to ensure that we aren‚Äôt selling items that they could be claiming tax on. It just meant sitting parked up in a bay with hundreds of trucks and a lot of waiting.\n\nThis pushed back our departure time for our train to Europe. Which meant more waiting around. There were more confusions about the carnet at border security and the feeling in the van was starting to get tense, but Tim was able to talk things through with the police and it was fine. Thankfully he speaks French and was able to explain things. We finally got on the train to France and left just before 2pm.\n\nWe‚Äôve got a long day of travelling ahead, but we‚Äôre excited to get to Belgium for dunk!festival. Din of Celestial Birds are scheduled for 17:40, and Ranges are on at 22:00\n\nUPDATE WRITTEN LATER ON\n\nWe missed Din of Celestial Birds, but lots of people insisted that they were one of the better acts at dunk!fest that weekend so well done to them.\n\nWe made our way to Ghent, unloaded our gear, and then the Americans and I took our personal belongings to our accommodation. The accommodation was across the road from Kinky Star, the venue Ranges first played in Europe, back in 2018.\n\nWe made our way back to the venue. Last time I‚Äôd come to dunk!festival it was held at a magical space in Zottegem. There was a forest stage and a mainstage tent. People camped onsite and it had a wonderful culture where everyone reveled in the music, fueled by fries and the finest Belgian beers. They‚Äôve switched venues, and now it is in Ghent. Regulars mourn the loss of the camping experience associated with the festival, and the stages didn‚Äôt have the same magical atmosphere as the forest, but it wasn‚Äôt a bad set up.\n\nIt was a pretty immense building, with four different stages as well as a bar/restaurant and artist green rooms. I was constantly getting lost as I tried to navigate the numerous staircases, but always found my way eventually.\n\nWe met back up with Tim and Tom. Their better halves had come to meet them. Tim‚Äôs wife is from Spain so I tried conversing with her in Spanish. Ironically enough, everyone understood me a lot more clearly when I spoke broken Spanish than when I just spoke in English with my New Zealand accent‚Ä¶\n\nWe visited catering, had a fantastic meal, and then began to set up our gear.\n\nChuck was getting a bit nervous, but he had the sound dialed. And people were already flooding into the room to listen to the soundcheck.\n\nThe Balzaal was full long before the band came onstage. I found this interesting. They could have chosen to watch other bands play downstairs. But they were that eager to see Ranges that they came early.\n\nAnd that eagerness was justified.\n\nI‚Äôve seen Ranges play 22 times now. And this was the best by far. Tim and Tom bring an extra energy to the band that has elevated Ranges to new heights. They do jumps and kicks and move about, feeding off each other. I could see that they were all loving it, turning and looking at each other and just savouring the experience throughout their set. Being a drummer, I notice Mark‚Äôs playing the most, and I could tell he was giving it more oomph than usual. The lights looked incredible. Chuck had them sounding great. And the packed out audience was so enraptured to take it all in.\n\nI took photos from backstage and ensured their drinks were topped up. I tried to get front of stage to take photos at one point but there were so many people that I didn‚Äôt want to push past. Tim was dripping with sweat and asked me to fetch him a towel. I looked all around backstage and eventually stole the handtowel from the toilet because I couldn‚Äôt find anything else.\n\nRanges set was a triumph. They were all just beaming. And rightly so.\n\nAt the end of the night we celebrated the end of the tour. Ranges had made a custom vodka to be released alongside their album Babel, and Wilson had specially bought a bottle and some cigars all the way from Montana. I don‚Äôt usually drink alcohol these days, but I joined in and got a bit silly. I‚Äôm sure Wilson has some embarrassing footage that will appear in a future Ranges release.\n\nThe rest of dunk!fest was cool. My highlights were Maserati and sleepmakeswaves. sleepmakeswaves was quite late on the final night and we were all tired and fading by that stage, but I‚Äôm glad I stuck it out because smw bring me so much joy. They faced a number of difficulties like pedals not working and straps breaking, but none of these hiccups dampened the mood.\n\nIt was nice to spend some quality downtime with the Ranges guys outside the festival as well, especially once the pressures of touring had finished. We enjoyed seeing some local sites (castles, canals and cathedrals!) and eating some great food like delectable French pastries, Belgian meatballs, and of course, frites. Last time I‚Äôd been in Ghent I was horrendously jetlagged and also got fairly drunk, so it was also nice to see more of the place in a less messy state.\n\nCJ commented how dunk!festival always happens on Ascension weekend, Ascension Day being a public holiday. And that is the day that Ranges have played, on the three times they‚Äôve played dunk!fest. And the first time, in 2018, they were touring their album The Ascensionist. There‚Äôs something especially fitting and special about that.\n\nWe had a teary goodbye at Brussels airport on the Sunday. These guys are like brothers to me. We‚Äôve been through so much together. Over the years I‚Äôve spent 4 weeks in the van with them, driving countless miles together. Drunken, late nights. Sampling local foods. Sharing beds in cramped sleeping quarters. Meeting crazy characters. So many laughs and stupid in jokes. Jokes that don‚Äôt make sense and we can‚Äôt even remember the origins of, but that we still find hilarious. Lots of bonding over incredible music.\n\nI‚Äôm so thankful that CJ invited me to join them on tour back in 2017. And I‚Äôm thankful that he insisted that I join them on tour again this time.\n\nGreets and great times to you all.\n\nJoseph James AKA Baggins\n\nsleepmakeswaves are the following:\n\nFun\n\nEnergetic\n\nExcellent riffs\n\nOne of my favourite post-rock bands\n\nAbsolutely awesome\n\nHot, cool and sexy\n\nI‚Äôve seen sleepmakeswaves play twice. The first time was at San Fran, a local venue here in Wellington. They were opening for This Will Destroy You, and were incredible and definitely made TWDY look lame by comparison. The next time was in Melbourne, at Monolith Festival. Monolith was an awesome day featuring a unbelievably stacked lineup of Australian post and prog bands, and sleepmakeswaves played a stand out set that made me feel so giddy and happy that I think they should look at somehow packaging their music in pill form to be used as antidepressants.\n\nI will be seeing them play in Belgium at dunk!festival this coming May as well and they are the band I am most excited to see.\n\nBut let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nI reviewed their album Made of Breath Only back in 2017. I loved it, of course. Since then sleepmakeswaves have released an ambitious 3 EP trilogy, a live album, and a split 7‚Ä≥ with Cog [Another fantastic Australian band. They also played the aforementioned Monolith Festival, and I‚Äôve written about one of their side projects ‚Äì The Occupants]. And now they‚Äôre treating us to a new record: It‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It.\n\nWhat a beautifully meta title. It‚Äôs basically called Untitled, but in the spirit of ridiculous long run-on names that are somewhat common in the post-rock scene [other examples: maybeshewill, 65daysofstatic, worriedaboutsatan]. I see other glimpses into their sense of humour when watching their Metallica cover [shaving a chopper mo just for the video is definite commitment to the bit!] and their 8bit computer game promo video for this album, and I get the impression that these lads would be great to hang out with.\n\nLet‚Äôs engage in an imagination exercise. Picture me pressing play on this record. I‚Äôm listening to an advanced digital download, but it‚Äôs cooler if you picture me placing the needle onto the groove of the record while it spins on the turntable. Probably a splattery green pressing, to match the album art. It doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äì this is an imagined scenario anyway.\n\nCue fuzzy droning, a cool metallic metronome, a wicked drum beat, and a big build up. My face lights up more and more with each addition. There‚Äôs a pause, and then a huge bombastic drum fill. Suddenly I‚Äôm jumping around the room, playing air-drums, with a big pulsing quarter notes on the crash cymbal, whilst simultaneously wielding a sick air guitar and shredding. I‚Äôm full stank face mode, and we‚Äôre only a minute into the album.\n\nLet that visual inform you of the tone of this review. sleepmakeswaves make me so excited and I need everyone to know about it.\n\nLead single ‚ÄúSuper Realm Park‚Äù is big, energetic and driving. It has loud parts and quiet dynamic sections. There‚Äôs some glitchy electronic elements at times, and lots of tremolo playing. It finishes with a lovely piano outro. It showcases exactly what sleepmakeswaves are capable of.\n\nHere‚Äôs an extract from the press release for the second single, ‚ÄúRitual Control‚Äù:\n\nThe band comments: ‚ÄúRitual Control was originally demoed as Dr. Riff Has Arrived. I still wonder whether we were mistaken to have not kept the old title.\n\nOtto originally presented the skeleton of the song to us with the concern that maybe the riff were ‚Äútoo dumb‚Äù. In fact, Tim and I responded, they are the perfect quantity of dumb. Sure, these riffs aren‚Äôt going to earn a PhD but they will hold down a full-time job, get the kids to school on time and read the occasional piece of challenging non-fiction on weekends. These kinds of courageous and heartfelt conversations are the core of what effective post-rock songwriting is all about.‚Äú\n\nBig dumb riffs. That‚Äôs what we want. Why think when you can headbang? Local doomlords Beastwars have the slogan ‚ÄúObey the Riff‚Äù, which is both marketing genius and an apt phrase, and summarises exactly the feeling I‚Äôm trying to convey. Most sleepmakeswaves songs are instrumental. We don‚Äôt need to get caught up pondering meaning and . Dumb riffs = good music. Also, Soundgarden have a song entitled ‚ÄúBig Dumb Sex‚Äù. Not sure how that‚Äôs relevant but I feel it supports my case somehow.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure which riff in ‚ÄúRitual Control‚Äù riff is the ‚Äúdumb riff‚Äù in question, but there‚Äôs a great part at 2:30 where everything drops out, and an extremely raunchy riff comes centrestage, and I must draw your attention to that part of the song.\n\nThe album starts of extremely strong, and you definitely know about this. Things shift gear down from such bombastic heights and begin to take a turn with the fourth track, ‚ÄúBlack Paradise‚Äù, which features quiet guitar picking for the first half, followed by pretty synth drone and guitar swells in the following song, ‚ÄúVerdigris‚Äù.\n\nTwo songs features ethereal vocals, which is a point of difference for an instrumental band. We hear singing on ‚ÄúTerror Future‚Äù ‚Äì with its especially outstanding basslines, and also on the titular track.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It‚Äù is truly beautiful. The serene fingerpicking and searing yet calm guitar playing reminds me of Dan Caine‚Äôs work. It builds up with an anthemic rock feel, but there‚Äôs something special about this track that sets it apart from the others. It feels more considered and emotive, and somehow befitting of it‚Äôs name. To quote the band again: ‚ÄúThe title is a line from zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, about not needing to find words for everything all the time.‚Äù I can‚Äôt explain it, but I somehow understand how fitting that is when I hear the song.\n\nThis is what I wanted. This is what I needed. sleepmakeswaves delivers, yet again. It‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It sounds simply huge. The album feels short, but it packs such a punch that perhaps more music would cause fatigue. It is an album of two halves. The immense, high energy rock songs at the start of the album are incredible and fill me with such incredible joy and excitement. And then the later half of the album features a few quieter tracks to show that sleepmakeswaves aren‚Äôt just a one-trick-pony. But trust me, it‚Äôs all fantastic. Or maybe don‚Äôt trust me ‚Äì I‚Äôve painted a picture of a madman when describing my reactions to sleepmakeswaves‚Äô music. ‚Äì but at least check out this excellent album.\n\nsleepmakeswaves have Australian, American and European tours lined up to promote this album. They are playing alongside their countryfolk Meniscus and Tangled Thoughts of Leaving, as well as Taiwanese math-rockers Elephant Gym. I encourage you to attend one of those shows if you get the opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, I will be seeing them at dunk!festival in Belgium, and I am fizzing with excitement for it.\n\nIt‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It will be released on 12 April 2024\n\nsleepmakeswaves links:\n\nOrder: https://sleepmakeswaves.bandcamp.com\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/sleepmakeswavesaus\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/sleepmakeswaves\n\nLabel: https://birdsrobe.com\n\nReview and photos by Joseph James\n\nI first discovered Winter Dust through the first A Thousand Arms compilation, Open Language. I was instantly hooked. The song was called ‚ÄúThere‚Äù, from the Thresholds EP ‚Äì one of the best EPs I can name from any genre of music. It was emotive, passionate, raw, compelling. It just sucked me in completely.\n\nTheir next release, Sense By Erosion, was just as incredible, channeling more of that intense emotion into truly incredible music. In my review I wrote: ‚ÄúBy taking the beauty of post-rock, the intensity of hardcore and the emotional aspects of emo, Winter Dust have fused their own sound that ticks all the right boxes for me.‚Äú\n\nThat was in 2018. The ‚Äúbefore times‚Äù, if you will. Things have changed a lot since then.\n\nWinter Dust faced some tragedies. In December 2019 they were involved in a car crash, totaling their van and destroying a lot of their instruments and musical equipment. And then in 2020 the world came to a standstill, with Italy hit especially hard.\n\nI was planning to return to Europe in 2020 with my American brothers in Ranges, and we were to tour and play at dunk!Festival. I was really excited for that trip, and was planning to visit Italy for the first time to meet the members of Winter Dust, and possibly even see them play live. I‚Äôm online friends with a some of the members of the band. I remember them painting a scene that I interpreted with absolute terror, discussing how the pandemic was ripping through Italy at a pace that the medical professionals couldn‚Äôt defend against. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I think I recall someone discussing mass graves. I do recall the sense of shock and disbelief. It was gut wrenching. The world was coming to an end.\n\nIn March 2020 Winter Dust made a post on their band page: ‚ÄúHere in Italy shows are banned, and so will be everywhere, soon.‚Äù And sure enough, their damning prophecy came true.\n\nI felt so isolated, living on a small island nation, stranded in the Pacific. Just a few months earlier I was so full of hope ‚Äì so excited ‚Äì with plans to see the world and go traveling and meet up with foreign friends. And in a short space of time that was taken from me. It‚Äôs not fair to compare ‚Äì and New Zealand had a lot better experience of the pandemic than most ‚Äì but I found it extremely difficult to process. I grieved the loss of live music, and struggled with the feeling of complete helplessness over what was happening throughout the world.\n\nA lot of what I just discussed hasn‚Äôt got much to do with the songs that Winter Dust write. But it provides context for what I‚Äôm reliving as I listen to this new album. The music is so emotionally potent already, and now brings up strong personally feelings and memories.\n\nI‚Äôve just scrolled back through the Winter Dust Facebook feed and found two posts from that time. I remember the feeling of dread and uncertainty, but looking back with hindsight on my side, I commend how they worded those posts. They were pragmatic, sending a message that yes, times are hard. But they also shared a message of hope: that we will get through this. Here is a post not long after their car crash, and here is a post about the looming pandemic. They were so strong in the face of all they were going through, and I‚Äôm so glad that they survived. And I‚Äôm grateful for this new album: Unisono.\n\nSomething to differentiate Unisono from Winter Dust‚Äôs previous works is that it features Italian singing. Which is awesome. Why wouldn‚Äôt a band from Italy sing in Italian? In a recent interview with DafenProject, Marco Vezzaro (vocals and guitar) explained that he could only express the things he needed to convey on this record accurately in his native tongue.\n\nI don‚Äôt understand Italian and I feel that to put the lyrics through an online translator would somehow tarnish the music or cheapen the experience. But I don‚Äôt see this as a barrier. The music is still beautiful, the singing compelling. I don‚Äôt understand the words, but I can hear the emotion.\n\nThe magnificent guitar tone that opens ‚ÄúCastelli de Sabbia‚Äù is one of my favourite moments of the record. I don‚Äôt play guitar so won‚Äôt be able to do it justice with any description, but it‚Äôs so full sounding, especially when coupled with Vezzaro‚Äôs throaty vocals. It‚Äôs so central to what I love about Winter Dust‚Äôs sound, so familiar. Almost homely, in a weird way.\n\nMy two favourite tracks on Unisono involve guest appearances by fellow Italian duo Six Impossible Things. ‚ÄúBuio Presto‚Äù features such sweet singing courtesy of SIT singer Nicole Fodritto, with the music slowly elevating the mood, especially with snare-heavy drumming. And then BOOM, the guitar comes in and everything steps up a notch, with Vezzaro‚Äôs impassioned hardcore vocals bringing a touch of anger.\n\nAnd lead single ‚ÄúDue Novembre‚Äù launches straight into it, with the band coming in full force, while Fodritto and Vezzaro harmonise. It a wonderful blending of textures. I love how they bring the song down to a simmer, Fodritto easing us out as the galloping drums cease and the other music trails off.\n\nSome of these songs are shorter than I would have expected, and could use a bit more fleshing out, with more instrumental breaks for breathing room. I guess I‚Äôm used to the post-rock passages that take the time to unpack and explore musical ideas. These elements are still present, but Unisono leans more on the hardcore aspect of Winter Dust‚Äôs sound, being more direct, aggressive and concise.\n\nThere are many layers within the music, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it dense. It feels well balanced. Twinkling piano sits beside the distorted guitar. Overdriven intense passages are spaced out with reverberating breathing moments. There are six musicians in the band, plus the guest appearances from two members of Six Impossible Things. And together they pool their expertise to span the spectrum of music and the feelings that it can convey.\n\nThe last record, Sense by Erosion, featured a single called ‚ÄúDuration of Gloom‚Äú. I know it‚Äôs not the correct lyric, but I always hear the opening line as ‚ÄúSetting fire to the sun!‚Äù. That doesn‚Äôt even make sense, but the vocal delivery is so visceral. I picture Vezzaro delivering his searing call to arms as he cries out to the universe, shouting out to any who will listen. This is often what comes to mind as I listen to Winter Dust‚Äôs music. The impassioned vocals of someone crying out to the void, with brilliant music that carries just as much power and emotion to match.\n\nAnd this is what has always struck a chord with me about Winter Dust. And it remains true with this latest album as well. We hear pain and anguish and frustration. But we also hear tenderness and beauty within the melodies. Unisono, is cathartic, to say the least.\n\nI‚Äôm passionate about music. I wouldn‚Äôt have gone to the efforts of creating this website if I wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a busy guy, but take time to write about music that inspires me; that I believe more people should hear about. And of the many bands I‚Äôve written about over the years, I think Winter Dust is one of the bands most worthy of more attention.\n\nListen to Unisono. It‚Äôs an absolute triumph. And listen to Winter Dust‚Äôs older material too. Buy their records and a t-shirt. They are truly one of the best bands out there and they deserve all the support they can get.\n\nWinter Dust are Marco Belloni (keys, piano, programming), Giulia De Paoli (grand piano, keys), Fabio Gallato (guitar), Marco Macchini (drums), Marco Lezzerini (bass), Marco Vezzaro (vocals, guitar, looping).\n\nThey‚Äôre based between Padua (IT) and London (UK).\n\nWinter Dust links:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/winterdust\n\nBandcamp: https://winter-dust.bandcamp.com/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/winterdustmusic/\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@winterdust\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/winterdustmusic\n\nKeep an eye on Voice of the Unheard Records for potential physical releases.\n\nJoseph James"
