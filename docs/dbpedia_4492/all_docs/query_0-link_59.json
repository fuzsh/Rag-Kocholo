        "text": "File your initial claim online using EZARC (Easy Arkansas Claims).\n\nezarc.adws.arkansas.gov | Monday–Friday, 6 AM- 6 PM and Sunday, 7 AM- 6 PM\n\nOnce you have completed the filing process, information will be mailed to you.\n\nWhen filing for UI, you must present your ID in person or verify your ID online. This confirms it’s YOU trying to file the claim, not someone pretending to be you. After you file your initial claim, you will click the ‘Verify Identity’ link on your confirmation page to choose how you would like to verify your ID. You will have three options.\n\n3 Ways to Verify ID:\n\n1. Online- Login.gov: Your confirmation page will provide a link to Login.gov. Select this method to upload photos of your ID with your phone or computer for verification. Follow the instructions provided. Login.gov accepted identification documents.\n\n2. Post Office (ID and Barcode): Present your valid government-issued ID in person at one of over 200 participating USPS locations in Arkansas. After choosing this method on your confirmation page, a barcode will be generated that you must present at the designated post office along with your ID. You can print the barcode or present it on your mobile device.\n\n3. Arkansas Workforce Center: Present your valid government-issued ID at a local Arkansas Workforce Center."
