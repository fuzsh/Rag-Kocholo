        "text": "Baggins is back with Ranges, baby!\n\nIt‚Äôs been aaaages. Last time I saw these guys was 2018. We‚Äôd planned on reuniting in 2020 but the pandemic cancelled those plans, and I was too cautious to try international travel when they next toured Europe in 2022. They‚Äôve released three albums since I last saw them: Babel (2019), Cardinal Winds (2021) and 33 (2023), as well as re-releasing ‚ÄúNight & Day‚Äú, the release that first introduced me to Ranges. So I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing them play some fresh material.\n\nA few updates since I last toured with Ranges: Jared the bass player moved to Ohio. And Joey on guitar moved to Idaho, where he is currently playing in a heavy band called Onsetter.\n\nSo Ranges are down to a core trio.\n\nWilson Raska contributes to the overall vision, concepts, and art. Seems a bit weird to include someone who doesn‚Äôt play the instruments, but anyone familiar with Ranges will know that their art and overall concepts are vital to who the band is. Wilson and CJ co-own A Thousand Arms ‚Äì a record label, printing workshop and distro. Chances are high that if you‚Äôre a post-rock fan, you‚Äôll have seen Wilson‚Äôs art on t-shirts or posters.\n\nCJ Blessum is the band dad. The most driven person I know. He‚Äôs the guy up at all hours, coordinating with people, running merch stalls, driving all through the night to get to the next gig. On top of that, he writes some pretty damn good post-rock music. CJ used to contribute to Will Not Fade now and again, and invited me to tour with Ranges across America in 2017. That was one of the greatest things to ever happen to me.\n\nAnd then we have Mark Levy. New York Hardcore drum legend. He‚Äôs a bit older than the others, and talks different, being from Brooklyn. And he is always the life of the party, and has a million amazing stories to share. He‚Äôs the guy I always turn to if I need drum advice.\n\nDamn, I‚Äôve really missed these guys. It‚Äôs amazing how spending time stuck in a van with a bunch of dudes for a few weeks can galvanise such friendships.\n\nLast time I came to Europe I was in an absolute state for the entire tour. One of my flights ‚Äì Auckland to Doha ‚Äì was the longest commercial flight in the world at the time. Jetlag hit me hard and I felt too out of sorts to really enjoy myself. So this time I‚Äôve opted to get to Europe a week earlier, hoping that the extra time would help me recover from jetlag before I join the band.\n\nAlso joining Ranges are Tim (guitar) and Tom (bass) from Astodan ‚Äì an incredible Belgian post-rock band who Ranges first played with back in 2018. Tim is keeps up with Mark in terms of being larger than life and also being a drummer in a bunch of other bands in Belgium. He also finds it very hard to understand my New Zealand accent, which leads to lots of confusion and big laughs. Tom is a lot quieter, but he is by far the funniest person of the group when he cracks a joke.\n\nWe also have sound engineer Chuck Goodwin, who has also made the trip from Montana to keep the guys sounding great, and Sean Oliver is the Fanta-loving driver from Utah, charged with transporting us in the huge van.\n\nDay 1\n\nMonday 6 May 2024\n\nRough Trade Bristol, Bristol, England\n\nw/ Fort, Din of Celestial Birds\n\nI flew into London a week before meeting up with them, and arranged to meet them in Bristol on the day of the first show. They‚Äôd spent some time in Belgium rehearsing with Tim and Tom from Astodan. We were due to meet at Rough Trade, the venue, at 4pm for load in. But they‚Äôd encounters issues when trying to come across the channel on the train. They‚Äôd been sent back to Belgian to obtain signatures that disclose something to do with taxes before they were allowed across into the UK. This put them way behind schedule and they were pushing it to make it to Bristol in time for their set.\n\nIn the meantime I introduced myself to the other two bands, and helped Nick the sound tech set up. The house drum kit was a Natal ‚Äì a brand I‚Äôd not encountered before. It was a really cool orange vistalite.\n\nI‚Äôd seen El Ten Eleven play at a Rough Trade in Brooklyn, New York in 2017, so I‚Äôm assuming it is a chain of record stores. It was a nice venue. There were loads of cool records and books and posters for sale, as you‚Äôd expect. The venue was a great size and I got along great with Nick the sound tech. They had these interesting extractor fans that Nick told me they had been required to install before reopening after the covid pandemic. They suck fresh air into the room and filter viruses out, or something along those lines.\n\nThe first band to play, FORT, are Welsh. I‚Äôd been in communication with them leading up to this and I found them very friendly. They are high energy and the best part was during the final song when Gavin jumped down into the audience with his guitar and they all went nuts during the big climactic part.\n\nDin of Celestial Birds are also playing dunk!fest at the end of the week, and have recently signed to A Thousand Arms. They give a more professional vibe, using backing tracks and even bringing their own fog machine and a lighting rig similar to the one Ranges had when I toured with them in the USA. There‚Äôs a lot more to take in, with six of them onstage.\n\nWe‚Äôd been nervous about when Ranges would arrive, given their big delay, but they arrived just in time. It was a rushed set up and line check, and then they played at their scheduled time. It was such a buzz to see the guys again after six years. It was mostly newer material that they‚Äôd written since I‚Äôd seen them last, but I got a bit emotional when they played a few Ascensionist songs. Tim and Tom were feeling a bit nervous about playing the set, being fill ins, but they did a stellar job and honestly, I don‚Äôt think anybody would have known that the band had only just arrived, or that they hadn‚Äôt played together much.\n\nAfter the gig we drove to Bath and stayed at a YMCA. I bunked with Tim, Tom and Chuck.\n\nDay 2\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024\n\nThe Deaf Institute, Manchester, England\n\nw/ Fort, Din of Celestial Birds\n\nBath was named after ancient Roman public baths that were situated there, taking advantage of the natural hot springs. Like many English cities, there were grand, stately buildings everywhere with ornate masonry. I gave Sean a hat I‚Äôd bought for him at Primark that had the Fanta logo all over it. He was chuffed. Sean is a Fanta connoisseur, and loves trying the Fanta in every country he goes to because they‚Äôre all slightly different. French and Belgian Fanta are among his favourites, and American Fanta is sadly not up to par. We spent the morning soaking in the hot pools and steaming in the saunas. It was a great relaxing way to start the day.\n\nSean had stayed somewhere else, and had managed to maim his left hand when returning the key to the lock box. He showed up at the van at the agreed time, with a bunch of bloody napkins held to his palm. We stopped in at an emergency room on the way to Manchester, but there was going to be at least a three hour wait, so we got some dressings at the pharmacy and continued on our journey.\n\nMark was quite excited to go to Manchester because he‚Äôs a fan of The Smiths. He insisted on having a photos taken outside the Salford Lad‚Äôs Club, which I thought was the name of a brothel. He wanted to replicate a photo from God Save The Queen, by The Smiths. I don‚Äôt really know much about it, but please enjoy this photo that I edited of Mark, Sean and I at the Lad‚Äôs Club.\n\nTonight‚Äôs venue was The Deaf Institute. The facade read ‚ÄúADULT DEAF & DUMB INSTITUTE‚Äù. Tom cracked a joke about there being a translator up the front to sign the lyrics, which was hilarious because all the bands are instrumental. There was another gig happening in the same building on the floor above.\n\nSean managed to get his hand seen to while we were setting up, which was a relief.\n\nI liked the venue but the stage was tiny. Two members of Din of Celestial Birds had to stand on the floor in front of the stage because there was no way all six of them would fit. The lighting was also terrible. But the show was good and the band sold lots of merch.\n\nLots of people had mentioned that Manchester is great to visit. I had a little wander round during soundcheck but didn‚Äôt really see enough to form an opinion. I did find a place with a huge MF Doom mask though, which I loved.\n\nAfter the gig we found a pizza joint that was still open after midnight, before heading back to the hotel we stayed at.\n\nDay 3\n\nWednesday 8 May 2024\n\nThe Portland Arms, Cambridge, England\n\nI would say this was the best day of the UK leg of the tour.\n\nWilson and I had matching shirts.\n\nWe stopped in at Croxden Abbey. I‚Äôve been seeing lots of old churches and castles during my time in the UK, but I still get super excited about it every time. Many have been bombed during the WWII, or fell casualty to prior wars. Henry VIII also disbanded many churches, convents etc when he formed the Church of England so that he could divorce his wife. I love walking amongst the old ruins, admiring the workmanship that is still so evident hundreds of years later, and getting the sense of history of those locations. We did some cool/cheesy photoshoots before grabbing lunch.\n\nLunch was at a quaint countryside tavern. We all ordered fish and chips. I didn‚Äôt think they were very good, but the others all loved the novelty of having such a distinctly English meal, complete with pints of ale, mushy peas, tartare sauce and lashings of malt vinegar.\n\nI really liked The Portland Arms, our venue for the night. The stage lighting was on point, Chuck had the sound dialed in, and the green room was a welcome haven where we could relax, charge our devices, and use WiFi.\n\nCJ took us on a walk around Cambridge. We climbed an old motte ‚Äì the hill from a former castle where they would have built the defensive keep. We walked around some university grounds (around, not through. They were very clear that visitors are unwelcome), and saw a small apple tree that is theoretically linked to Isaac Newton somehow. The place reminded me of Oxford, although nowhere near as impressive. We finished up with some great doner kebabs from a street vendor before heading back to the gig.\n\nI met a local photographer, Dobbin Thomas, who took some incredible shots of the night. He was happy for me to feature some here. Give him a follow: https://www.instagram.com/robin_dobbin_t\n\nFORT by Dobbin Thomas\n\nDin of Celestial Birds by Dobbin Thomas\n\nRanges by Dobbin Thomas\n\nAnd here are some of my photos below\n\nIt looked and sounded fantastic. Ranges really came together tonight and locked in well. Everyone was on a high.\n\nDay 4\n\nThursday 9 May 2024\n\nEn route to dunk!festival\n\nWe got up bright and early for a 7am departure. Touring can sound fun and glamourous, but the reality is often it means late nights, inadequate sleep, eating crappy food obtainable at petrol stations, spending all day in a van. Sometimes it wears you down. We spent hours at customs. The government wanted to ensure that we aren‚Äôt selling items that they could be claiming tax on. It just meant sitting parked up in a bay with hundreds of trucks and a lot of waiting.\n\nThis pushed back our departure time for our train to Europe. Which meant more waiting around. There were more confusions about the carnet at border security and the feeling in the van was starting to get tense, but Tim was able to talk things through with the police and it was fine. Thankfully he speaks French and was able to explain things. We finally got on the train to France and left just before 2pm.\n\nWe‚Äôve got a long day of travelling ahead, but we‚Äôre excited to get to Belgium for dunk!festival. Din of Celestial Birds are scheduled for 17:40, and Ranges are on at 22:00\n\nUPDATE WRITTEN LATER ON\n\nWe missed Din of Celestial Birds, but lots of people insisted that they were one of the better acts at dunk!fest that weekend so well done to them.\n\nWe made our way to Ghent, unloaded our gear, and then the Americans and I took our personal belongings to our accommodation. The accommodation was across the road from Kinky Star, the venue Ranges first played in Europe, back in 2018.\n\nWe made our way back to the venue. Last time I‚Äôd come to dunk!festival it was held at a magical space in Zottegem. There was a forest stage and a mainstage tent. People camped onsite and it had a wonderful culture where everyone reveled in the music, fueled by fries and the finest Belgian beers. They‚Äôve switched venues, and now it is in Ghent. Regulars mourn the loss of the camping experience associated with the festival, and the stages didn‚Äôt have the same magical atmosphere as the forest, but it wasn‚Äôt a bad set up.\n\nIt was a pretty immense building, with four different stages as well as a bar/restaurant and artist green rooms. I was constantly getting lost as I tried to navigate the numerous staircases, but always found my way eventually.\n\nWe met back up with Tim and Tom. Their better halves had come to meet them. Tim‚Äôs wife is from Spain so I tried conversing with her in Spanish. Ironically enough, everyone understood me a lot more clearly when I spoke broken Spanish than when I just spoke in English with my New Zealand accent‚Ä¶\n\nWe visited catering, had a fantastic meal, and then began to set up our gear.\n\nChuck was getting a bit nervous, but he had the sound dialed. And people were already flooding into the room to listen to the soundcheck.\n\nThe Balzaal was full long before the band came onstage. I found this interesting. They could have chosen to watch other bands play downstairs. But they were that eager to see Ranges that they came early.\n\nAnd that eagerness was justified.\n\nI‚Äôve seen Ranges play 22 times now. And this was the best by far. Tim and Tom bring an extra energy to the band that has elevated Ranges to new heights. They do jumps and kicks and move about, feeding off each other. I could see that they were all loving it, turning and looking at each other and just savouring the experience throughout their set. Being a drummer, I notice Mark‚Äôs playing the most, and I could tell he was giving it more oomph than usual. The lights looked incredible. Chuck had them sounding great. And the packed out audience was so enraptured to take it all in.\n\nI took photos from backstage and ensured their drinks were topped up. I tried to get front of stage to take photos at one point but there were so many people that I didn‚Äôt want to push past. Tim was dripping with sweat and asked me to fetch him a towel. I looked all around backstage and eventually stole the handtowel from the toilet because I couldn‚Äôt find anything else.\n\nRanges set was a triumph. They were all just beaming. And rightly so.\n\nAt the end of the night we celebrated the end of the tour. Ranges had made a custom vodka to be released alongside their album Babel, and Wilson had specially bought a bottle and some cigars all the way from Montana. I don‚Äôt usually drink alcohol these days, but I joined in and got a bit silly. I‚Äôm sure Wilson has some embarrassing footage that will appear in a future Ranges release.\n\nThe rest of dunk!fest was cool. My highlights were Maserati and sleepmakeswaves. sleepmakeswaves was quite late on the final night and we were all tired and fading by that stage, but I‚Äôm glad I stuck it out because smw bring me so much joy. They faced a number of difficulties like pedals not working and straps breaking, but none of these hiccups dampened the mood.\n\nIt was nice to spend some quality downtime with the Ranges guys outside the festival as well, especially once the pressures of touring had finished. We enjoyed seeing some local sites (castles, canals and cathedrals!) and eating some great food like delectable French pastries, Belgian meatballs, and of course, frites. Last time I‚Äôd been in Ghent I was horrendously jetlagged and also got fairly drunk, so it was also nice to see more of the place in a less messy state.\n\nCJ commented how dunk!festival always happens on Ascension weekend, Ascension Day being a public holiday. And that is the day that Ranges have played, on the three times they‚Äôve played dunk!fest. And the first time, in 2018, they were touring their album The Ascensionist. There‚Äôs something especially fitting and special about that.\n\nWe had a teary goodbye at Brussels airport on the Sunday. These guys are like brothers to me. We‚Äôve been through so much together. Over the years I‚Äôve spent 4 weeks in the van with them, driving countless miles together. Drunken, late nights. Sampling local foods. Sharing beds in cramped sleeping quarters. Meeting crazy characters. So many laughs and stupid in jokes. Jokes that don‚Äôt make sense and we can‚Äôt even remember the origins of, but that we still find hilarious. Lots of bonding over incredible music.\n\nI‚Äôm so thankful that CJ invited me to join them on tour back in 2017. And I‚Äôm thankful that he insisted that I join them on tour again this time.\n\nGreets and great times to you all.\n\nJoseph James AKA Baggins\n\nsleepmakeswaves are the following:\n\nFun\n\nEnergetic\n\nExcellent riffs\n\nOne of my favourite post-rock bands\n\nAbsolutely awesome\n\nHot, cool and sexy\n\nI‚Äôve seen sleepmakeswaves play twice. The first time was at San Fran, a local venue here in Wellington. They were opening for This Will Destroy You, and were incredible and definitely made TWDY look lame by comparison. The next time was in Melbourne, at Monolith Festival. Monolith was an awesome day featuring a unbelievably stacked lineup of Australian post and prog bands, and sleepmakeswaves played a stand out set that made me feel so giddy and happy that I think they should look at somehow packaging their music in pill form to be used as antidepressants.\n\nI will be seeing them play in Belgium at dunk!festival this coming May as well and they are the band I am most excited to see.\n\nBut let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nI reviewed their album Made of Breath Only back in 2017. I loved it, of course. Since then sleepmakeswaves have released an ambitious 3 EP trilogy, a live album, and a split 7‚Ä≥ with Cog [Another fantastic Australian band. They also played the aforementioned Monolith Festival, and I‚Äôve written about one of their side projects ‚Äì The Occupants]. And now they‚Äôre treating us to a new record: It‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It.\n\nWhat a beautifully meta title. It‚Äôs basically called Untitled, but in the spirit of ridiculous long run-on names that are somewhat common in the post-rock scene [other examples: maybeshewill, 65daysofstatic, worriedaboutsatan]. I see other glimpses into their sense of humour when watching their Metallica cover [shaving a chopper mo just for the video is definite commitment to the bit!] and their 8bit computer game promo video for this album, and I get the impression that these lads would be great to hang out with.\n\nLet‚Äôs engage in an imagination exercise. Picture me pressing play on this record. I‚Äôm listening to an advanced digital download, but it‚Äôs cooler if you picture me placing the needle onto the groove of the record while it spins on the turntable. Probably a splattery green pressing, to match the album art. It doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äì this is an imagined scenario anyway.\n\nCue fuzzy droning, a cool metallic metronome, a wicked drum beat, and a big build up. My face lights up more and more with each addition. There‚Äôs a pause, and then a huge bombastic drum fill. Suddenly I‚Äôm jumping around the room, playing air-drums, with a big pulsing quarter notes on the crash cymbal, whilst simultaneously wielding a sick air guitar and shredding. I‚Äôm full stank face mode, and we‚Äôre only a minute into the album.\n\nLet that visual inform you of the tone of this review. sleepmakeswaves make me so excited and I need everyone to know about it.\n\nLead single ‚ÄúSuper Realm Park‚Äù is big, energetic and driving. It has loud parts and quiet dynamic sections. There‚Äôs some glitchy electronic elements at times, and lots of tremolo playing. It finishes with a lovely piano outro. It showcases exactly what sleepmakeswaves are capable of.\n\nHere‚Äôs an extract from the press release for the second single, ‚ÄúRitual Control‚Äù:\n\nThe band comments: ‚ÄúRitual Control was originally demoed as Dr. Riff Has Arrived. I still wonder whether we were mistaken to have not kept the old title.\n\nOtto originally presented the skeleton of the song to us with the concern that maybe the riff were ‚Äútoo dumb‚Äù. In fact, Tim and I responded, they are the perfect quantity of dumb. Sure, these riffs aren‚Äôt going to earn a PhD but they will hold down a full-time job, get the kids to school on time and read the occasional piece of challenging non-fiction on weekends. These kinds of courageous and heartfelt conversations are the core of what effective post-rock songwriting is all about.‚Äú\n\nBig dumb riffs. That‚Äôs what we want. Why think when you can headbang? Local doomlords Beastwars have the slogan ‚ÄúObey the Riff‚Äù, which is both marketing genius and an apt phrase, and summarises exactly the feeling I‚Äôm trying to convey. Most sleepmakeswaves songs are instrumental. We don‚Äôt need to get caught up pondering meaning and . Dumb riffs = good music. Also, Soundgarden have a song entitled ‚ÄúBig Dumb Sex‚Äù. Not sure how that‚Äôs relevant but I feel it supports my case somehow.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure which riff in ‚ÄúRitual Control‚Äù riff is the ‚Äúdumb riff‚Äù in question, but there‚Äôs a great part at 2:30 where everything drops out, and an extremely raunchy riff comes centrestage, and I must draw your attention to that part of the song.\n\nThe album starts of extremely strong, and you definitely know about this. Things shift gear down from such bombastic heights and begin to take a turn with the fourth track, ‚ÄúBlack Paradise‚Äù, which features quiet guitar picking for the first half, followed by pretty synth drone and guitar swells in the following song, ‚ÄúVerdigris‚Äù.\n\nTwo songs features ethereal vocals, which is a point of difference for an instrumental band. We hear singing on ‚ÄúTerror Future‚Äù ‚Äì with its especially outstanding basslines, and also on the titular track.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It‚Äù is truly beautiful. The serene fingerpicking and searing yet calm guitar playing reminds me of Dan Caine‚Äôs work. It builds up with an anthemic rock feel, but there‚Äôs something special about this track that sets it apart from the others. It feels more considered and emotive, and somehow befitting of it‚Äôs name. To quote the band again: ‚ÄúThe title is a line from zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, about not needing to find words for everything all the time.‚Äù I can‚Äôt explain it, but I somehow understand how fitting that is when I hear the song.\n\nThis is what I wanted. This is what I needed. sleepmakeswaves delivers, yet again. It‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It sounds simply huge. The album feels short, but it packs such a punch that perhaps more music would cause fatigue. It is an album of two halves. The immense, high energy rock songs at the start of the album are incredible and fill me with such incredible joy and excitement. And then the later half of the album features a few quieter tracks to show that sleepmakeswaves aren‚Äôt just a one-trick-pony. But trust me, it‚Äôs all fantastic. Or maybe don‚Äôt trust me ‚Äì I‚Äôve painted a picture of a madman when describing my reactions to sleepmakeswaves‚Äô music. ‚Äì but at least check out this excellent album.\n\nsleepmakeswaves have Australian, American and European tours lined up to promote this album. They are playing alongside their countryfolk Meniscus and Tangled Thoughts of Leaving, as well as Taiwanese math-rockers Elephant Gym. I encourage you to attend one of those shows if you get the opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, I will be seeing them at dunk!festival in Belgium, and I am fizzing with excitement for it.\n\nIt‚Äôs Here, But I Have No Names For It will be released on 12 April 2024\n\nsleepmakeswaves links:\n\nOrder: https://sleepmakeswaves.bandcamp.com\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/sleepmakeswavesaus\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/sleepmakeswaves\n\nLabel: https://birdsrobe.com\n\nReview and photos by Joseph James\n\nMonolith Festival\n\nfeat. Karnivool, Cog, Ocean Grove, Plini, sleepmakeswaves, Reliqa, Yomi Ship\n\nPICA, Melbourne\n\nSaturday 26 August 2022\n\nAustralia hits well above its weight when it comes to excellent prog-rock and post-rock bands. Belgium does well, possibly because dunk!records is based there. Japan has an incredible scene, especially with the math-rock offshoot. America is obviously well represented, but that‚Äôs a given because America is huge and is there anything that they don‚Äôt dominate at? But honestly, give me the choice, and I‚Äôd most want to see Australian post/prog bands.\n\nMonolith Festival was my chance. When I first saw the announcement I was almost too scared to hope. The lineup seemed too good to be true. Karnivool AND Cog? I‚Äôd consider coming over for either one of those acts, let alone both of them together. But this is the time of covid. A time of ruined dreams and cancellations and postponements and lockdowns and all those nasty things a pandemic can cause. It was too risky.\n\nAnd sure enough, the gigs were postponed. But this worked for me. It meant that it took us to a time beyond extreme border restrictions and mandatory isolation. Travel was viable again. I could afford a glimmer of hope.\n\nI‚Äôve come to Melbourne for gigs a few times in the past: Into It. Over It. and Download Festival. Both were amazing, truly treasured memories. It was time for a hat-trick. Monolith Festival, here we come!\n\nYomi Ship\n\nI arrived at PICA with my friend Francie half way through Yomi Ship‚Äôs set. Navigating Melbourne‚Äôs public transport had proven more difficult than anticipated, with some train services being closed for maintenance. PICA ‚Äì Port Melbourne Industrial Centre for the Arts ‚Äì was a cool spot. As the name suggests, it was in the port area. It used to be a warehouse of some sort, that had been repurposed as a venue. A bunch of old shipping containers had been converted into bars, and there were a few bars spaces that didn‚Äôt look quite so industrial. It was covered in corrugated iron and the walls didn‚Äôt come down far, giving it a half open-air feel ‚Äì like an industrial gazebo of sorts. There was a designated area with picnic tables and an assortment of food trucks, and the obligatory merch tent and portaloos. It was a great set up.\n\nPerth‚Äôs Yomi Ship ‚Äì named after a Yu Gi Oh card ‚Äì were a trio playing very technical-sounding post-rock. It was fairly laid-back, despite some time-signature changes that bordered on jarring. Melbourne had put on an unexpected beaut of a day, and this dreamy music was wonderful as we enjoyed the sun.\n\nReliqa\n\nReliqa is one of the acts I hadn‚Äôt heard of before seeing the Monolith line up. I figured I better check out all the acts about a month ago, and was blown away with how much I loved their music. They‚Äôve been on very heavy rotate ever since.\n\nI came in with high expectations, and Reliqa more than delivered. They draw from a range of styles, with elements borrowed from prog-rock, metalcore, djent and and similar alternative styles. They‚Äôre a young band, but showed great mastery as musicians and songwriters. Frontwoman Monique Pym stood out especially with her powerful pipes.\n\nMikey from local metalcore band Gloom in the Corner came on for a guest spot on their latest single ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù, with some pretty heavy hardcore vocals. After that the band previewed unreleased material from their forthcoming EP: I Don‚Äôt Know What I Am. I tell you what: it‚Äôs great music. Uplifting passages, thunderous breakdowns, infectious riffing ‚Äì I was absolutely lapping it up.\n\nI was very impressed with their set. Note Reliqa down as a band to watch out for.\n\nsleepmakeswaves\n\nBack in 2017 I tagged along with Montana post-rockers Ranges on a two week tour across America. I saw a lot of post-rock bands during those two weeks, especially because the tour involved a few days in Vermont at the inaugural dunk!USA festival. I remember discussing with Ranges guitarist Joey Caldwell what it took for post-rock bands to stand out in a live context. They need either memorable melodies or great energy. Anything less, and they‚Äôre just not up to par.\n\nsleepmakeswaves have both. Delicious riffs, interesting effects, great dynamics. And energy! Such energy! I‚Äôd seen them open for This Will Destroy You when they came to Wellington in 2015, hot off a three-month long tour. They, well, destroyed TWDY. Their energy was incredible. I‚Äôve long awaited the chance to see them play again.\n\nSound check for their set had me giggling. Certain frequencies had the corrugated iron on the roof of the venue rattling sympathetically, like the wire snares on a snare drum.\n\nRight from the opening notes of ‚ÄúTundra‚Äù, I was transported into my happy place. Pure euphoria. It reminded me just why Made Of Breath Only is one of my favourite post-rock albums. As I already mentioned, they are an incredibly energetic band. And that energy was contagious. The three string players were bounding all over the stage, leaping up and off the foldbacks. I could tell there were some issues with the bass guitar because a roadie kept coming up to adjust the pedal board and swap out the lead, but I couldn‚Äôt hear anything wrong.\n\nThey dismissed their music as mere ‚Äúinterlude songs‚Äù, but honestly, their set was the highlight of my day. It has been a tough few years. I wouldn‚Äôt usually consider myself a happy person and life is often a struggle. But sleepmakeswaves made me experience such elation that I struggle to remember when I was in such joyful spirits.\n\nPlini\n\nThe sun had set by this stage, so the lights finally looked effective onstage. It was quite comical how much stage smoke was deployed, with the band often engulfed in clouds.\n\nLike sleepmakeswaves, Plini plays guitar driven instrumental music. But I‚Äôd call Plini technical guitar metal, rather than energetic post-rock. I‚Äôd seen Plini play in Wellington once at a sold-out gig, in many ways reminiscent of the Intervals gig that had taken place maybe 6 months before. It was a great night.\n\nI don‚Äôt have too much to say about his music. It‚Äôs a lot of widdly widdly wizardry. Once you‚Äôve heard one of his songs you‚Äôll have a fair idea what the rest will sound like. Very tappy and technical, bridging the gap between melodic and heavy.\n\nOne of the reasons that I love the prog/post styles of music is that the artists are often pushing their abilities as musicians. Plini doesn‚Äôt put on much of a show ‚Äì he‚Äôs quite unassuming and self-deprecating ‚Äì but he is a phenomenal guitarist. And his band members also have to be incredible as well. This was an act that you just stand and watch, mouth agape, in awe of their talent.\n\nOcean Grove.\n\nNow you have to understand that I am from New Zealand. The internet does wonders for connecting us all, but some big Australian bands just don‚Äôt have a presence over the ditch. I‚Äôd never heard of Ocean Grove. But based on their streaming stats, and the of bands they‚Äôve opened for, I‚Äôd wager they‚Äôre pretty big here in Australia.\n\nI gave them a few listens online leading up to Monolith. And to be honest, I never lasted long before switching to something else. I didn‚Äôt really get the appeal. But they made sense live. Their music was definitely more commercial sounding and catchy, something I could easily imagine gaining radio play. And they had great presence. They‚Äôre local to Melbourne, so I imagine that many people in attendance had seen them plenty of times.\n\nTheir sound reminded me of Limp Bizkit and Sum 41, switching from rapping to hook laden choruses. Their visuals weren‚Äôt exactly cohesive, but you can tell they‚Äôd put some thought into their image. The singer wore a boiler suit, and the lead guitarist had a skeleton hoodie and sequined jeans.\n\nThey encouraged everyone to get up on shoulders and crowd surf, with singer Dale Tanner jumping out into the crowd rows of the audience himself.\n\nCog.\n\nCog are incredible. How can a mere trio be such a powerhouse act? One of my mates put my onto them a when I started university and I was instantly hooked. Cog were old news by that stage, and inactive. There was the wonderful side project from The Occupants that they released around that time, but I thought Cog was over. Thankfully after a few years, Cog reunited, released a few singles, and I was able to see them play on a trip to Sydney. It was everything I wanted and more. I even caught one of Lucius‚Äô drum sticks that night, but regretfully left it in the hotel room when I returned to NZ a few days later.\n\nThey were obviously a huge drawcard for tonight. Looking around, you could see most people singing along to most songs. Guitarist Flynn Gower mentioned that they‚Äôd been coming down to Melbourne for close on 25 years, and felt that Melbourne was a musical home for the band.\n\nAs is the case with every band on the bill, the musicians in Cog were amazing players. All three of them sang. I was especially in awe of drummer Lucias Borich. He had a huge DW kit, flanked by sample pads with a huge Zildjian gong at the rear. And splash cymbals for Africa. He seemed like an octopus at times, utilizing so many different percussive elements in his playing.\n\nSome of the mix wasn‚Äôt quite right. Flynn had two microphones with slightly different effects (I‚Äôd seen Faith No More‚Äôs Mike Patton do this in the past too) and the secondary one wasn‚Äôt working for the start of the set. And the samples from the drum trigger pads were a lot louder than the band at times, but all in all, none of this really detracted from the gig.\n\nEveryone knew the songs so well, so it was neat to see how the band gave these songs live treatment. The song ‚ÄúOpen Up‚Äù (A Leftfield/Public Imaged Ltd cover) stood out somewhat, having a more dancy/electronic feel. I loved the handful of songs which had extended jams, with ‚ÄúNo Other Way‚Äù having an especially big build up.\n\nBassist Luke Gower was having the time of his life. You could see him dancing and grooving onstage, even between songs. You could even see how much fun he was having as he sang some of the non-lyrical vocal parts, playing with what his voice could do. I chatted to him briefly after his set and he said to me ‚Äúoh yeah, you could tell that tonight was a great set‚Äù. I have to say I agree with him.\n\nKarnivool\n\nI dreamt of becoming a music journalist as a teen. Imagine being given albums to review, getting passes to concerts, interviewing rock stars. I never managed to make a career of it, but I did start this music blog so I‚Äôve had a taste of it. My favourite magazine at the time was Rip It Up, a long standing NZ music mag that was celebrating its 30th birthday around the time I started reading it. Annual subscriptions worked out cheaper than buying each issue, and you‚Äôd get a free CD too. From memory I got a Velvet Revolver album the first year. The second year I got a CD from a band I hadn‚Äôt heard of: Sound Awake by Karnivool. I‚Äôm so grateful for that. I wonder if I would have ever discovered Karnivool if not for that chance subscription bonus?\n\nThat album was a game changer. As a teenage bogan, I was dutifully a huge Tool fan. This was a band who came incredibly close in terms of musicianship and feel, yet didn‚Äôt feel derivative. I loved the moodiness, the emotion. As a beginning drummer, I was in absolute awe of the drumming. There are plenty of brilliant drumming moments found within, but the intro to ‚ÄúThe Caudal Lure‚Äù stood out, because Steve Judd plays around the beat. I couldn‚Äôt comprehend it.\n\nI was even more fortunate to see them play at Big Day Out the following year. It was amazing, but criminally early in the day, and not a very long set. That was 12 years ago. I‚Äôve craved more live Karnivool ever since.\n\nSound Awake remains one of my favourite albums. Now and again I meet someone who is a fellow Karnivool fan and it feels like we instantly form a special bond. I remember chatting to some of the guys in OHGOD (who opened for Karnivool in South Africa) at dunk!fest 2018, who share my reverence for the Vool. And my mate Josh (Tides of Man) talks about touring with Karnivool, and just being completely floored as he got to watch them from side of stage every night on tour. They‚Äôre on another level.\n\nTonight was the night. I would have come over just for Karnivool. I couldn‚Äôt miss Karnivool AND Cog, along with the other incredible bands.\n\nThey‚Äôd hung a huge transparent curtain in front of the stage during set up and sound check. I couldn‚Äôt tell what the point of this was from where I was to the side, but I assume it added a theatrical element, dropping to the floor half way through their first song.\n\nAs I said before, Sound Awake is a huge album for me, so songs like ‚ÄúSimple Boy‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Day‚Äù were big highlights. But they treated fans to works from throughout their catalogue. Their encore was their newest song, ‚ÄúAll It Takes‚Äù, followed by ‚ÄúFade‚Äù ‚Äì one of their oldest.\n\nIt had seemed like most of the crowd had been singing along to Cog‚Äôs set when they played. Well for Karnivool, it seemed like that number had doubled. It was a sight to behold, seeing everyone mouth along to the words, arms in the air. One of the best moments was the outro to ‚ÄúWe Are‚Äù, which the band slowly faded out to. It felt magic, everyone singing along in unison at the last notes lingered in the still night.\n\nMonolith Festival was a huge success. Incredible bands, great venue, sold out show.\n\nKarnivool guitarist Mark Hosking to summed it up well: ‚ÄúIf there is one thing that this tour has made abundantly clear, it is that Australian music is alive! And here! And relevant!‚Äù\n\nThe pandemic stole a lot from us. But it didn‚Äôt defeat us. And tonight was a testament to that. Great music unites people, and reminds us what we have to live for.\n\nLet‚Äôs do it again. Add Meniscus to the lineup. I‚Äôll come back to Australia for that in a heartbeat.\n\nWords and photos by Joseph James\n\nRegular Will Not Fade readers should need no introduction to Ranges. I‚Äôve been covering music from the Montana post-rockers since they released ‚ÄúNight & Day‚Äù in 2015. I also joined them on tour across America for their 2017 tour in support of their breakthrough album The Ascensionist, and again when they went on tour in Europe and played dunk!festival the following year. CJ (guitar) and Wilson (art direction) also co-own A Thousand Arms, the screen-printing company come distro/record label responsible for the awesome Open Language and Hemispheres post-rock compilations that come out every year.\n\nMost Ranges releases have an underlying concept. ‚ÄúNight & Day‚Äù was a 24 minute song that mirrored the 24 hour day. Gods of the Copybook Headings was inspired by the Rudyard Kipling poem of the same name. I‚Äôve always liked how their music had extra elements that you could chose to delve into and find deeper meaning in.\n\nThe albums often have amazing physical elements as well, especially with the two most recent albums, The Ascensionist and Babel. Handmade booklets for liner notes on recycled paper; ceramic mugs and shot glasses; screen printed b-side records, wall banners, t-shirts, guitar pedals, cassette tapes with riddles and maps, black market currency‚Ä¶ Seriously, the band made their own coins which could be redeemed in exchange for exclusive merch items that were only accessible on certain days discovered by decoding a calendar.\n\nLoads of their releases and merch have cryptic hidden puzzles and codes and meanings that hint at upcoming releases or unlocking more secret b-sides. I know Aaron ‚ÄúFoofer‚Äù Edwards was the first to decipher on of the puzzles that came with a cassette tape the band released.\n\nSo it‚Äôs interesting how they‚Äôve approached this record. It seems clear that something is coming. They‚Äôve dropped a lot of singles in quick succession over the past month. But no clear news about what was coming. No album title, no pre-order. I guess they‚Äôve always loved the air of mystique attached to their music, and now they‚Äôve built up a big enough fanbase that they can really have fun keeping people speculating.\n\nThey‚Äôve even kept me in the dark ‚Äì and for all intensive purposes I‚Äôm an honorary band member. I‚Äôve been able to listen to the album for a month or two, but they haven‚Äôt given me any hints. I guess I can review the music, but any true Ranges fan knows that the music is only one component of a release. I guess information about artwork and physical media will be revealed in good time‚Ä¶\n\nOK, here are some juicy details you‚Äôve been after. You‚Äôve actually heard most of the songs if you‚Äôve been keeping up with their recent releases. There‚Äôs the four tracks we‚Äôve already heard; four interlude tracks named after the directional points of the compass; and the title track: ‚ÄúCardinal Winds‚Äù\n\nCJ was responsible for a lot of recording and mixing duties in the past because he ran a studio, The Low Country. For Babel they chose to give CJ a break so he could focus on songwriting, rather than worrying about taking on too much responsibility. They drove down to Texas and recorded with Chris Commons, an experience that they all enjoyed. But the a global pandemic made it harder just to get out of the house, let alone out of the state, so Ranges went back to self-recording.\n\nThis album also saw Ranges reduced to a trio of musicians. Jared Gabriel was the the bass player in Ranges for quite a while, but he moved from Montana to Ohio last year to live with his fianc√©, so doesn‚Äôt feature on this record. Hope you‚Äôre doing awesome Jared!\n\n‚ÄúDeluge‚Äù was the first track we heard, featuring on the recent Open Language compilation put out by A Thousand Arms. It‚Äôs a great song to create first impressions with, but actually features as the last track on the album. It starts out with a murky sound that makes me think of whale song, and a great bass tone that gives off Kerretta vibes. The guitar line is fantastic. You can always trust Joey to come up with a great melody and it‚Äôs what makes this song what it is. Mark plays some tasty rolling beats on the toms that sound thunderous but not overpowering. And CJ brings the swells and ambience. It‚Äôs a solid song but watch out: that melody will get so stuck in your head!\n\nThe actual album opener ‚ÄúAbyss‚Äù (debuted on Everything is Noise) comes in strong and intentional. We‚Äôre hit by a barrage of overdriven guitar. I remember CJ saying how he wants to incorporate more tremolo strumming into his playing during the writing of Babel, and I can picture him here rocking back and forward, hands a blur as they flutter over the guitar pickups. Mark is really laying into his cymbals too and you can feel the intensity of his hits.\n\nThis subsides somewhat to allow an opening for the melody line. Joey and CJ work well together, both playing just what they need to complement the other. There‚Äôs some lush beauty that the two work together to weave throughout the song, a very rewarding listen. ‚ÄúAbyss‚Äù is a strong statement as an opener and it works brilliantly.\n\nWe have four tracks that I‚Äôll call the ‚Äòcompass‚Äô tracks. They serve as interludes, giving breathing space and breaking up the album. They sound like samples of cassette tapes; of needles on record grooves; static on the radio; or of some forms of analogue media at the very least. It‚Äôs ethereal and we hear gales of wind howling through ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù atop a speaker crackling. It‚Äôll be interesting to hear how the four ‚Äòcompass‚Äô tracks sound on vinyl. Very meta, I assume.\n\nMark is one of my drum heroes. I have so much love for the guy. I even have a photo of him up on my bedroom wall. He gave me advice when I needed to buy a snare drum, and often recommends music to listen to. My old band just released an album that I drummed on and in all honestly, Mark‚Äôs thoughts are the main thing I care about. If Mark approves of my playing then that‚Äôs all I need. Mark has a custom drum company named Duradero and if he ever makes me a snare drum I will die a happy man.\n\nMark had been accused of ‚Äòplaying it safe‚Äô in the past, and he openly confesses that it was true. But it‚Äôs not true on this album. His playing is just what the music needs. It‚Äôs driving and passionate. You can hear the energy of his strokes and how it propels and elevates everything. It sounds great. It‚Äôs tight, it‚Äôs creative, it‚Äôs musical. He‚Äôs a beast but his playing serves the music instead of overshadowing it.\n\n‚ÄúSojourner‚Äù [featured on Heavy Blog is Heavy] feels majestic and powerful, with a pulsing beat. There‚Äôs some really cool electronic sounds at play ‚Äì a wavering, shimmery sound and some warm synth bass ‚Äì that provide nice textural elements for the guitars and drums to build upon.\n\nTitle track ‚ÄúCardinal Winds‚Äù is the song that they‚Äôve saved for the big reveal. I‚Äôm guessing that they wanted to keep the album name secret. It commences with a neat percussive sampled intro before launching into the big crescendo sound that is recognisably Ranges. It comes in at just under nine minutes long, so it‚Äôs fair to say it‚Äôs an epic, comprised of a number of movements.\n\nIn fact, there are two other songs of similar length, the aforementioned ‚ÄúAbyss‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSolace‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúSolace‚Äù [premiered on the YouTube channel wherepostrockdwells] gives of feelings of solitude freedom, as the name would suggest. 2017‚Äôs The Ascensionist was the soundtrack to conquering a mountain, and we return to similar feelings of finding ourselves reckoning with the wild forces of nature here. This is the lull in the album, focused more on ambient textures and tender guitar picking than sheer force or melody. Of course, there‚Äôs the obligatory crescendo, but ‚ÄúSolace‚Äù is the song that helps you catch your breath.\n\nIt‚Äôs a shame I can‚Äôt comment on the artwork, packaging or merch. Wilson always knocks it out of the park with that side of things. They did such an amazing job with Babel that I‚Äôm excited to see what they have planned. I feel that my review is incomplete, but I can at least assure you that the music is worth your time.\n\nThese guys are my good friends. I‚Äôve spent 3 weeks in a tour van with them traveling around the world. Of course I have favourable things to say about them. But I truly mean it when I say this is a great album. Their last album Babel was their best work to date, but Cardinal Winds tops it. This record really is a triumph of songwriting. I can‚Äôt wait to receive a physical copy and let me neighbours experience it as well when I blast it on my turntable.\n\nCardinal Winds is out on Friday 27 August. There‚Äôs a countdown clock at https://www.rangesmusic.com/ but I‚Äôm not staying up til 3am local time to see what happens. I imagine there‚Äôll be some awesome content available to purchase at the A Thousand Arms and dunk!records websites.\n\nRanges links:\n\nA Thousand Arms store (USA): https://www.athousandarms.com/collections/ranges\n\ndunk!records store (EU): https://dunkrecords.com/collections/dunk-records-on-vinyl/ranges?sort_by=manual\n\nBandcamp: https://ranges.bandcamp.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/rangesmusic\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rangesmusic/\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJg41ELchEChCEtIRKz4NA?app=desktop\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/rangesmusic\n\nJoseph James (Baggins)"
