        "text": "Pro trade-union or anti? No one seems to sure but that didn’t stop The Strawbs 1973 song, Part of the Union, becoming a hit record.\n\nthe strawbs fax\n\nBelieve it or not, the Strawbs were originally a bluegrass band known as the Strawberry Hill Boys.\n\nThe band’s line-up has changed over the years and has featured notable musicians, Dave Cousins, Sandy Denny, Rick Wakeman, and Rick’s sons Oliver and Adam (both keyboard players). Also part of the band were John Ford and Richard Hudson who went on to form the duet with the imaginative name, Hudson Ford.\n\nBy 1972, The Strawbs had morphed from a country to a folk to a harder rock band. Their third album, Bursting at the Seams featured two singles, Lay Down, which peaked at #12 on the UK charts, and Part of the Union.\n\nBursting at the Seams made it to #2 on the UK album charts.\n\nThe Strawbs separated ways in 1980 only to reunite in 1983. They have been playing in various forms ever since.\n\npart of the union fax\n\nPart of the Union was the second single from The Strawbs album, Bursting at the Seams. It was released on October 13, 1972.\n\nThe song is written by Richard Hudson and John Ford, although the lyrics are often likened to the Woody Guthrie song Union Maid.\n\nPart of the Union peaked at #2 on the UK singles chart – the band’s highest charting single.\n\nThe song was, not surprisingly, adopted by the trade union movement in the UK, although some see the lyrics as being sarcastically union. Indeed, Rick Wakeman, a strong supporter of the Conservative Party, has said that the lyrics were supposed to be sarcastic.\n\nPart of the Union lyrics.\n\npart of the union – the strawbs – 1973 – video\n\nfollow seventiesmusic on facebook.\n\nYou’ll find out when the latest blog is posted and every Monday you’ll get “This Week in 70s Music.” Click the Facebook logo to go to the seventiesmusic Facebook page and click “Like.”"
