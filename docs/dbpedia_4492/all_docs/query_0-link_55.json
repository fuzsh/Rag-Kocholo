However, since then they have carried a different torch together, fueled by the sorts of tensions ubiquitous in the rock and roll lexicon: love, ennui, anger, desperation, poverty, aesthetic differences, and above all, the love of making music. Together. The Lovemakers' latest full-length record, transparently entitled Let's Be Friends, is set for a September release. The album was produced by Talking House Productions in San Francisco and was mixed by Times of Romance producer Clif Norrell. Keeping with tradition, the songs range from the sweet melodic intensity of The Cure to the unapologetic ass-shaking of Prince. In other words, if Katy Perry's mall-sass joined forces with cult heroes Sparks' eclectic, fun and witty style you'd get The Lovemakers. The album boasts big, 80s narrative-driven pop songs instructed by plenty of dirty, gritty fun.\n\nThe Union Trade\n\n-Don Joslin: Guitar Nate Munger: Bass, Vocals Eric Salk: Guitar, Piano, Rhodes Eitan Anzenberg: Drums\n\nfrom San Francisco, CA\n\nTo date, San Francisco based The Union Trade’s sound has lived somewhere between the instrumental rock sound of bands like Explosions In the Sky, Caspian and This Will Destroy You and a more vocal driven shoegaze sound. On their upcoming sophomore full-length album, “A Place of Long Years”, set for release February 3rd 2015 on Tricycle Records, The Union Trade make a natural progression into the true instrumental post-rock realm they first explored on the track “Everyday Including Holidays” from their debut 2008 LP Everyday Including (Tricycle)\n\nAfter a nearly three year hiatus following the release of their last studio release, the 2011 EP Why We Need Night, the band began to write again, but this time without a drummer. In this slower, quieter process, the founding trio of Don Joslin, Nate Munger and Eric Salk found space to begin composing what would develop into an entirely instrumental set of songs to be finalized with the singular energy of new drummer Eitan Anzenberg.\n\nBrasil\n\nJPL - guitar & ld vox, P.W.

With Yoel Bibas on drums, the duo began to refine their recording and production skills and released a 5-song self titled EP and music video (“Fish Me”) in November. After only a handful of shows, it is obvious that Paisano is a blossoming band with a refreshing new sound and swagger. The band blends sounds from psych rock to latin and tropicalia, and even hip hop with appealing hypnotic melodies and harmonies. Joined with Luis Mayorga on bass, this sexy supergroup is bound to excite.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Paisano by Paisano&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; DJ Pegasister\n\n~Julie Schuchard\n\nDJ"
