        "text": "One of Spotify’s core goals is to give “a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art.” Yet, to generate a single dollar on the platform, a song needs to be streamed 263 times.\n\nTo put that in perspective, it would take 786 streams to generate enough revenue to buy an average cup of coffee. To pay the median American monthly rent ($1,078) an artist needs to generate 283,684 recurring streams monthly. And to earn $15/hr each month working full time, it would take 657,895 streams per band member.\n\nWe are asking Spotify to raise the average streaming royalty from $.0038 to a penny per stream. Doing so would give artists a better chance at making a living from their art, and begin to restore the public valuation of music.\n\nMajor record labels own a huge percentage of Spotify’s catalog. With their leverage they are able to dictate the terms of their own streaming royalties and negotiate their own complex payment structures. It also gives them preferential treatment when it comes to editorial and algorithmic playlisting, something that all artists depend on.\n\nWe are calling on Spotify to be more transparent with their finances, their platform, and their relationships with artists. Make all deals with major labels public, and to end practices that resemble payola. In addition, we urge Spotify to give due credit to all engineers, musicians and laborers on all recordings.\n\nSpotify positions itself as the ultimate tool for artists to connect with and acquire new fans – but those aspirations frequently come in conflict with their bottom line and their business model. They ask artists to generate more and more content, saying “You can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.”\n\nTheir own director of economics, Will Page, has stated that switching the platform to a user-centric model would be too difficult to implement because of “significant financial costs to adopting and implementing user-centric distribution.” Spotify should be fighting for the artists who built it, instead of further undercutting our economic well-being.\n\nAnd earlier in 2020, Spotify along with several other streaming giants took to the DC circuit courts to appeal the 44% increase in mechanical songwriter royalty payments set in 2018 by the Copyright Royalty Board. Spotify along with other streaming giants have invested millions of dollars into this legal battle to deny songwriters their due. Spotify cannot legitimately claim to be helpful to artists if they continue to fight songwriters in court."
