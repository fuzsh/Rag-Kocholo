        "text": "The Union Trade made their debut in 2007 with the release of their first EP, Now the Swell (Tricycle), which was quickly followed up by their first full-length album. 2008's Everyday Including (Tricycle) laid out the band's vision of a lush cinematic post rock sound built on heavily distorted guitars awash in delay, epic dynamics, and minimalist vocals. Garnering the band praise in national and international press, and fans around the world, Everyday Including also earned The Union Trade an official showcase at SXSW 2009.\n\nWith the addition of new drummer David Elrod to the founding line-up of Don Joslin (guitar), Eric Salk (guitar & keyboards) and Nate Munger (bass & lead vocals), The Union Trade add a dynamic new element to their sound. This new energy is captured on their upcoming EP, Why We Need Night, set for release on February 8th 2011 on Tricycle Records."
