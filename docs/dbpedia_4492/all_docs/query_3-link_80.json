        "text": "In 1833, a group of six farm workers from the Dorset village of Tolpuddle were concerned that their wages had been reduced, so they formed a trade union to ask for guarantees that their wages wouldn’t be cut any further. Other farm workers wanted to join their trade union, and prospective members were asked to swear an oath and pay a fee to join.\n\nThe authorities were concerned by the growing popularity of the group and wanted to break it up, but it wasn’t illegal to form a trade union, so the authorities had to find another way to stop them. Eventually, in 1834, they were able to charge the group’s leaders with swearing a secret oath, which was illegal, and the group was disbanded. The leaders of the trade union were put on trial and found guilty, and received the maximum punishment for their crime: seven years of transportation to Australia. The severity of the punishment shows how desperate the authorities were to prevent others from forming trade unions.\n\nThe public were outraged by the sentence the men received, and they became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. A petition in favour of the martyrs received 200,000 signatures, and there were several demonstrations and protests about their treatment which drew large crowds. In 1836, the Tolpuddle Martyrs were pardoned and were permitted to return home.\n\nAll six men returned to Tolpuddle in 1837. George Loveless was first to arrive home, in June, 1837. Four men were later welcomed at a grand dinner in London, with around 2,000 guests. James Hammett was the last of the men to return home, and was welcomed at the Victoria Theatre – now known as The Old Vic.\n\nUnions exist to help people at work, Unions make the workplace a better place.\n\nUnions give workers a say at work.\n\nUnions provide a range of advice, support and legal back-up\n\nUnions help provide learning opportunities, fight discrimination and make work safer\n\nUnions fight for good public services, pensions, minimum wages and laws to protect people at work"
