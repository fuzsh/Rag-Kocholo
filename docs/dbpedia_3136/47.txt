Part 1: Introduction to Cryptography- Alfred Menezes

Education

He received B.Math, M.Math, and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 1987, 1989, and 1992, respectively.

Academic career

Menezes is a professor in and the chair of the Department of Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo. He is also the Managing Director of the Centre for Applied Cryptographic Research.

He was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Auburn University from 1992 until 1997, before moving to the University of Waterloo.

In 2001 he won the Hall Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications.
