Foreword by R.L. Rivest As we draw near to closing out the twentieth century, we see quite clearly that the information-processing and telecommunications revolutions now underway will continue vigorously into the twenty-first. We interact and transact by directing flocks of digital packets towards each other through cyberspace, carrying love notes, digital cash, and secret corporate documents. Our personal and economic lives rely more and more on our ability to let such ethereal carrier pigeons mediate at a distance what we used to do with face-to-face meetings, paper documents, and a firm handshake. Unfortunately, the technical wizardry enabling remote collaborations is founded on broadcasting everything as sequences of zeros and ones that oneâs own dog wouldnât recognize. What is to distinguish a digital dollar when it is as easily reproducible as the spoken word? How do we converse privately when every syllable is bounced off a satellite and smeared over an entire continent? How should a bank know that it really is Bill Gates requesting from his laptop in Fiji a transfer of $10,000,000,000 to another bank? Fortunately, the magical mathematics of cryptography can help. Cryptography provides techniques for keeping information secret, for determining that information has not been tampered with, and for determining who authored pieces of information. Cryptography is fascinating because of the close ties it forges between theory and practice, and because todayâs practical applications of cryptography are pervasive and critical components of our information-based society. Information-protection protocols designed on theoretical foundations one year appear in products and standards documents the next. Conversely, new theoretical developments sometimes mean that last yearâs proposal has a previously unsuspected weakness. While the theory is advancing vigorously, there are as yet few true guarantees; the security of many proposals depends on unproven (if plausible) assumptions. The theoretical work refines and improves the practice, while the practice challenges and inspires the theoretical work. When a system is âbroken,â our knowledge improves, and next yearâs system is improved to repair the defect. (One is reminded of the long and intriguing battle between the designers of bank vaults and their opponents.) Cryptography is also fascinating because of its game-like adversarial nature. A good cryptographer rapidly changes sides back and forth in his or her thinking, from attacker to defender and back. Just as in a game of chess, sequences of moves and counter-moves must be considered until the current situation is understood. Unlike chess players, cryptographers must also consider all the ways an adversary might try to gain by breaking the rules or violating expectations. (Does it matter if she measures how long I am computing? Does it matter if her ârandomâ number isnât one?) The current volume is a major contribution to the field of cryptography. It is a rigorous encyclopedia of known techniques, with an emphasis on those that are both (believed to be) secure and practically useful. It presents in a coherent manner most of the important cryptographic tools one needs to implement secure cryptographic systems, and explains many of the cryptographic principles and protocols of existing systems. The topics covered range from low-level considerations such as random-number generation and efficient modular exponentiation algorithms and medium-level items such as public-key signature techniques, to higher-level topics such as zero-knowledge protocols. This bookâs excellent organization and style allow it to serve well as both a self-contained tutorial and an indispensable desk reference. xxi

Foreword

In documenting the state of a fast-moving field, the authors have done incredibly well at providing error-free comprehensive content that is up-to-date. Indeed, many of the chapters, such as those on hash functions or key-establishment protocols, break new ground in both their content and their unified presentations. In the trade-off between comprehensive coverage and exhaustive treatment of individual items, the authors have chosen to write simply and directly, and thus efficiently, allowing each element to be explained together with their important details, caveats, and comparisons. While motivated by practical applications, the authors have clearly written a book that will be of as much interest to researchers and students as it is to practitioners, by including ample discussion of the underlying mathematics and associated theoretical considerations. The essential mathematical techniques and requisite notions are presented crisply and clearly, with illustrative examples. The insightful historical notes and extensive bibliography make this book a superb stepping-stone to the literature. (I was very pleasantly surprised to find an appendix with complete programs for the CRYPTO and EUROCRYPT conferences!) It is a pleasure to have been asked to provide the foreword for this book. I am happy to congratulate the authors on their accomplishment, and to inform the reader that he/she is looking at a landmark in the development of the field. Ronald L. Rivest Webster Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Massachusetts Institute of Technology August 1996

Preface This book is intended as a reference for professional cryptographers, presenting the techniques and algorithms of greatest interest to the current practitioner, along with the supporting motivation and background material. It also provides a comprehensive source from which to learn cryptography, serving both students and instructors. In addition, the rigorous treatment, breadth, and extensive bibliographic material should make it an important reference for research professionals. Our goal was to assimilate the existing cryptographic knowledge of industrial interest into one consistent, self-contained volume accessible to engineers in practice, to computer scientists and mathematicians in academia, and to motivated non-specialists with a strong desire to learn cryptography. Such a task is beyond the scope of each of the following: research papers, which by nature focus on narrow topics using very specialized (and often non-standard) terminology; survey papers, which typically address, at most, a small number of major topics at a high level; and (regretably also) most books, due to the fact that many book authors lack either practical experience or familiarity with the research literature or both. Our intent was to provide a detailed presentation of those areas of cryptography which we have found to be of greatest practical utility in our own industrial experience, while maintaining a sufficiently formal approach to be suitable both as a trustworthy reference for those whose primary interest is further research, and to provide a solid foundation for students and others first learning the subject. Throughout each chapter, we emphasize the relationship between various aspects of cryptography. Background sections commence most chapters, providing a framework and perspective for the techniques which follow. Computer source code (e.g. C code) for algorithms has been intentionally omitted, in favor of algorithms specified in sufficient detail to allow direct implementation without consulting secondary references. We believe this style of presentation allows a better understanding of how algorithms actually work, while at the same time avoiding low-level implementation-specific constructs (which some readers will invariably be unfamiliar with) of various currently-popular programming languages. The presentation also strongly delineates what has been established as fact (by mathematical arguments) from what is simply current conjecture. To avoid obscuring the very applied nature of the subject, rigorous proofs of correctness are in most cases omitted; however, references given in the Notes section at the end of each chapter indicate the original or recommended sources for these results. The trailing Notes sections also provide information (quite detailed in places) on various additional techniques not addressed in the main text, and provide a survey of research activities and theoretical results; references again indicate where readers may pursue particular aspects in greater depth. Needless to say, many results, and indeed some entire research areas, have been given far less attention than they warrant, or have been omitted entirely due to lack of space; we apologize in advance for such major omissions, and hope that the most significant of these are brought to our attention. To provide an integrated treatment of cryptography spanning foundational motivation through concrete implementation, it is useful to consider a hierarchy of thought ranging from conceptual ideas and end-user services, down to the tools necessary to complete actual implementations. Table 1 depicts the hierarchical structure around which this book is organized. Corresponding to this, Figure 1 illustrates how these hierarchical levels map xxiii

onto the various chapters, and their inter-dependence. Table 2 lists the chapters of the book, along with the primary author(s) of each who should be contacted by readers with comments on specific chapters. Each chapter was written to provide a self-contained treatment of one major topic. Collectively, however, the chapters have been designed and carefully integrated to be entirely complementary with respect to definitions, terminology, and notation. Furthermore, there is essentially no duplication of material across chapters; instead, appropriate cross-chapter references are provided where relevant. While it is not intended that this book be read linearly from front to back, the material has been arranged so that doing so has some merit. Two primary goals motivated by the âhandbookâ nature of this project were to allow easy access to stand-alone results, and to allow results and algorithms to be easily referenced (e.g., for discussion or subsequent crossreference). To facilitate the ease of accessing and referencing results, items have been categorized and numbered to a large extent, with the following classes of items jointly numbered consecutively in each chapter: Definitions, Examples, Facts, Notes, Remarks, Algorithms, Protocols, and Mechanisms. In more traditional treatments, Facts are usually identified as propositions, lemmas, or theorems. We use numbered Notes for additional technical points,

while numbered Remarks identify non-technical (often non-rigorous) comments, observations, and opinions. Algorithms, Protocols and Mechanisms refer to techniques involving a series of steps. Examples, Notes, and Remarks generally begin with parenthetical summary titles to allow faster access, by indicating the nature of the content so that the entire item itself need not be read in order to determine this. The use of a large number of small subsections is also intended to enhance the handbook nature and accessibility to results. Regarding the partitioning of subject areas into chapters, we have used what we call a functional organization (based on functions of interest to end-users). For example, all items related to entity authentication are addressed in one chapter. An alternative would have been what may be called an academic organization, under which perhaps, all protocols based on zero-knowledge concepts (including both a subset of entity authentication protocols and signature schemes) might be covered in one chapter. We believe that a functional organization is more convenient to the practitioner, who is more likely to be interested in options available for an entity authentication protocol (Chapter 10) or a signature scheme (Chapter 11), than to be seeking a zero-knowledge protocol with unspecified end-purpose. In the front matter, a top-level Table of Contents (giving chapter numbers and titles only) is provided, as well as a detailed Table of Contents (down to the level of subsections, e.g., Â§5.1.1). This is followed by a List of Figures, and a List of Tables. At the start of each chapter, a brief Table of Contents (specifying section number and titles only, e.g., Â§5.1, Â§5.2) is also given for convenience. At the end of the book, we have included a list of papers presented at each of the Crypto, Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt/Auscrypt and Fast Software Encryption conferences to date, as well as a list of all papers published in the Journal of Cryptology up to Volume 9. These are in addition to the References section, each entry of which is cited at least once in the body of the handbook. Almost all of these references have been verified for correctness in their exact titles, volume and page numbers, etc. Finally, an extensive Index prepared by the authors is included. The Index begins with a List of Symbols.

Our intention was not to introduce a collection of new techniques and protocols, but rather to selectively present techniques from those currently available in the public domain. Such a consolidation of the literature is necessary from time to time. The fact that many good books in this field include essentially no more than what is covered here in Chapters 7, 8 and 11 (indeed, these might serve as an introductory course along with Chapter 1) illustrates that the field has grown tremendously in the past 15 years. The mathematical foundation presented in Chapters 2 and 3 is hard to find in one volume, and missing from most cryptography texts. The material in Chapter 4 on generation of public-key parameters, and in Chapter 14 on efficient implementations, while well-known to a small body of specialists and available in the scattered literature, has previously not been available in general texts. The material in Chapters 5 and 6 on pseudorandom number generation and stream ciphers is also often absent (many texts focus entirely on block ciphers), or approached only from a theoretical viewpoint. Hash functions (Chapter 9) and identification protocols (Chapter 10) have only recently been studied in depth as specialized topics on their own, and along with Chapter 12 on key establishment protocols, it is hard to find consolidated treatments of these now-mainstream topics. Key management techniques as presented in Chapter 13 have traditionally not been given much attention by cryptographers, but are of great importance in practice. A focused treatment of cryptographic patents and a concise summary of cryptographic standards, as presented in Chapter 15, are also long overdue. In most cases (with some historical exceptions), where algorithms are known to be insecure, we have chosen to leave out specification of their details, because most such techniques are of little practical interest. Essentially all of the algorithms included have been verified for correctness by independent implementation, confirming the test vectors specified.

1.1 Introduction Cryptography has a long and fascinating history. The most complete non-technical account of the subject is Kahnâs The Codebreakers. This book traces cryptography from its initial and limited use by the Egyptians some 4000 years ago, to the twentieth century where it played a crucial role in the outcome of both world wars. Completed in 1963, Kahnâs book covers those aspects of the history which were most significant (up to that time) to the development of the subject. The predominant practitioners of the art were those associated with the military, the diplomatic service and government in general. Cryptography was used as a tool to protect national secrets and strategies. The proliferation of computers and communications systems in the 1960s brought with it a demand from the private sector for means to protect information in digital form and to provide security services. Beginning with the work of Feistel at IBM in the early 1970s and culminating in 1977 with the adoption as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard for encrypting unclassified information, DES, the Data Encryption Standard, is the most well-known cryptographic mechanism in history. It remains the standard means for securing electronic commerce for many financial institutions around the world. The most striking development in the history of cryptography came in 1976 when Diffie and Hellman published New Directions in Cryptography. This paper introduced the revolutionary concept of public-key cryptography and also provided a new and ingenious method 1

for key exchange, the security of which is based on the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem. Although the authors had no practical realization of a public-key encryption scheme at the time, the idea was clear and it generated extensive interest and activity in the cryptographic community. In 1978 Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman discovered the first practical public-key encryption and signature scheme, now referred to as RSA. The RSA scheme is based on another hard mathematical problem, the intractability of factoring large integers. This application of a hard mathematical problem to cryptography revitalized efforts to find more efficient methods to factor. The 1980s saw major advances in this area but none which rendered the RSA system insecure. Another class of powerful and practical public-key schemes was found by ElGamal in 1985. These are also based on the discrete logarithm problem. One of the most significant contributions provided by public-key cryptography is the digital signature. In 1991 the first international standard for digital signatures (ISO/IEC 9796) was adopted. It is based on the RSA public-key scheme. In 1994 the U.S. Government adopted the Digital Signature Standard, a mechanism based on the ElGamal publickey scheme. The search for new public-key schemes, improvements to existing cryptographic mechanisms, and proofs of security continues at a rapid pace. Various standards and infrastructures involving cryptography are being put in place. Security products are being developed to address the security needs of an information intensive society. The purpose of this book is to give an up-to-date treatise of the principles, techniques, and algorithms of interest in cryptographic practice. Emphasis has been placed on those aspects which are most practical and applied. The reader will be made aware of the basic issues and pointed to specific related research in the literature where more indepth discussions can be found. Due to the volume of material which is covered, most results will be stated without proofs. This also serves the purpose of not obscuring the very applied nature of the subject. This book is intended for both implementers and researchers. It describes algorithms, systems, and their interactions. Chapter 1 is a tutorial on the many and various aspects of cryptography. It does not attempt to convey all of the details and subtleties inherent to the subject. Its purpose is to introduce the basic issues and principles and to point the reader to appropriate chapters in the book for more comprehensive treatments. Specific techniques are avoided in this chapter.

1.2 Information security and cryptography The concept of information will be taken to be an understood quantity. To introduce cryptography, an understanding of issues related to information security in general is necessary. Information security manifests itself in many ways according to the situation and requirement. Regardless of who is involved, to one degree or another, all parties to a transaction must have confidence that certain objectives associated with information security have been met. Some of these objectives are listed in Table 1.1. Over the centuries, an elaborate set of protocols and mechanisms has been created to deal with information security issues when the information is conveyed by physical documents. Often the objectives of information security cannot solely be achieved through mathematical algorithms and protocols alone, but require procedural techniques and abidance of laws to achieve the desired result. For example, privacy of letters is provided by sealed envelopes delivered by an accepted mail service. The physical security of the envelope is, for practical necessity, limited and so laws are enacted which make it a criminal

keeping information secret from all but those who are authorized to see it. ensuring information has not been altered by unauthorized or unknown means. corroboration of the identity of an entity (e.g., a person, a computer terminal, a credit card, etc.). corroborating the source of information; also known as data origin authentication. a means to bind information to an entity. conveyance, to another entity, of official sanction to do or be something. a means to provide timeliness of authorization to use or manipulate information or resources. restricting access to resources to privileged entities. endorsement of information by a trusted entity. recording the time of creation or existence of information. verifying the creation or existence of information by an entity other than the creator. acknowledgement that information has been received. acknowledgement that services have been provided. a means to provide an entity with the legal right to use or transfer a resource to others. concealing the identity of an entity involved in some process. preventing the denial of previous commitments or actions. retraction of certification or authorization.

offense to open mail for which one is not authorized. It is sometimes the case that security is achieved not through the information itself but through the physical document recording it. For example, paper currency requires special inks and material to prevent counterfeiting. Conceptually, the way information is recorded has not changed dramatically over time. Whereas information was typically stored and transmitted on paper, much of it now resides on magnetic media and is transmitted via telecommunications systems, some wireless. What has changed dramatically is the ability to copy and alter information. One can make thousands of identical copies of a piece of information stored electronically and each is indistinguishable from the original. With information on paper, this is much more difficult. What is needed then for a society where information is mostly stored and transmitted in electronic form is a means to ensure information security which is independent of the physical medium recording or conveying it and such that the objectives of information security rely solely on digital information itself. One of the fundamental tools used in information security is the signature. It is a building block for many other services such as non-repudiation, data origin authentication, identification, and witnessing, to mention a few. Having learned the basics in writing, an individual is taught how to produce a handwritten signature for the purpose of identification. At contract age the signature evolves to take on a very integral part of the personâs identity. This signature is intended to be unique to the individual and serve as a means to identify, authorize, and validate. With electronic information the concept of a signature needs to be

4

Ch. 1 Overview of Cryptography

redressed; it cannot simply be something unique to the signer and independent of the information signed. Electronic replication of it is so simple that appending a signature to a document not signed by the originator of the signature is almost a triviality. Analogues of the âpaper protocolsâ currently in use are required. Hopefully these new electronic based protocols are at least as good as those they replace. There is a unique opportunity for society to introduce new and more efficient ways of ensuring information security. Much can be learned from the evolution of the paper based system, mimicking those aspects which have served us well and removing the inefficiencies. Achieving information security in an electronic society requires a vast array of technical and legal skills. There is, however, no guarantee that all of the information security objectives deemed necessary can be adequately met. The technical means is provided through cryptography. 1.1 Definition Cryptography is the study of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, and data origin authentication. Cryptography is not the only means of providing information security, but rather one set of techniques. Cryptographic goals Of all the information security objectives listed in Table 1.1, the following four form a framework upon which the others will be derived: (1) privacy or confidentiality (Â§1.5, Â§1.8); (2) data integrity (Â§1.9); (3) authentication (Â§1.7); and (4) non-repudiation (Â§1.6). 1. Confidentiality is a service used to keep the content of information from all but those authorized to have it. Secrecy is a term synonymous with confidentiality and privacy. There are numerous approaches to providing confidentiality, ranging from physical protection to mathematical algorithms which render data unintelligible. 2. Data integrity is a service which addresses the unauthorized alteration of data. To assure data integrity, one must have the ability to detect data manipulation by unauthorized parties. Data manipulation includes such things as insertion, deletion, and substitution. 3. Authentication is a service related to identification. This function applies to both entities and information itself. Two parties entering into a communication should identify each other. Information delivered over a channel should be authenticated as to origin, date of origin, data content, time sent, etc. For these reasons this aspect of cryptography is usually subdivided into two major classes: entity authentication and data origin authentication. Data origin authentication implicitly provides data integrity (for if a message is modified, the source has changed). 4. Non-repudiation is a service which prevents an entity from denying previous commitments or actions. When disputes arise due to an entity denying that certain actions were taken, a means to resolve the situation is necessary. For example, one entity may authorize the purchase of property by another entity and later deny such authorization was granted. A procedure involving a trusted third party is needed to resolve the dispute. A fundamental goal of cryptography is to adequately address these four areas in both theory and practice. Cryptography is about the prevention and detection of cheating and other malicious activities. This book describes a number of basic cryptographic tools (primitives) used to provide information security. Examples of primitives include encryption schemes (Â§1.5 and Â§1.8),

hash functions (Â§1.9), and digital signature schemes (Â§1.6). Figure 1.1 provides a schematic listing of the primitives considered and how they relate.

be evaluated with respect to various criteria such as: 1. level of security. This is usually difficult to quantify. Often it is given in terms of the number of operations required (using the best methods currently known) to defeat the intended objective. Typically the level of security is defined by an upper bound on the amount of work necessary to defeat the objective. This is sometimes called the work factor (see Â§1.13.4). 2. functionality. Primitives will need to be combined to meet various information security objectives. Which primitives are most effective for a given objective will be determined by the basic properties of the primitives. 3. methods of operation. Primitives, when applied in various ways and with various inputs, will typically exhibit different characteristics; thus, one primitive could provide

6

very different functionality depending on its mode of operation or usage. 4. performance. This refers to the efficiency of a primitive in a particular mode of operation. (For example, an encryption algorithm may be rated by the number of bits per second which it can encrypt.) 5. ease of implementation. This refers to the difficulty of realizing the primitive in a practical instantiation. This might include the complexity of implementing the primitive in either a software or hardware environment. The relative importance of various criteria is very much dependent on the application and resources available. For example, in an environment where computing power is limited one may have to trade off a very high level of security for better performance of the system as a whole. Cryptography, over the ages, has been an art practised by many who have devised ad hoc techniques to meet some of the information security requirements. The last twenty years have been a period of transition as the discipline moved from an art to a science. There are now several international scientific conferences devoted exclusively to cryptography and also an international scientific organization, the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), aimed at fostering research in the area. This book is about cryptography: the theory, the practice, and the standards.

1.3 Background on functions While this book is not a treatise on abstract mathematics, a familiarity with basic mathematical concepts will prove to be useful. One concept which is absolutely fundamental to cryptography is that of a function in the mathematical sense. A function is alternately referred to as a mapping or a transformation.

1.3.1 Functions (1-1, one-way, trapdoor one-way) A set consists of distinct objects which are called elements of the set. For example, a set X might consist of the elements a, b, c, and this is denoted X = {a, b, c}. 1.2 Definition A function is defined by two sets X and Y and a rule f which assigns to each element in X precisely one element in Y . The set X is called the domain of the function and Y the codomain. If x is an element of X (usually written x â X) the image of x is the element in Y which the rule f associates with x; the image y of x is denoted by y = f (x). Standard notation for a function f from set X to set Y is f : X ââ Y . If y â Y , then a preimage of y is an element x â X for which f (x) = y. The set of all elements in Y which have at least one preimage is called the image of f , denoted Im(f ). 1.3 Example (function) Consider the sets X = {a, b, c}, Y = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and the rule f from X to Y defined as f (a) = 2, f (b) = 4, f (c) = 1. Figure 1.2 shows a schematic of the sets X, Y and the function f . The preimage of the element 2 is a. The image of f is {1, 2, 4}. Thinking of a function in terms of the schematic (sometimes called a functional diagram) given in Figure 1.2, each element in the domain X has precisely one arrowed line originating from it. Each element in the codomain Y can have any number of arrowed lines incident to it (including zero lines).

Often only the domain X and the rule f are given and the codomain is assumed to be the image of f . This point is illustrated with two examples. 1.4 Example (function) Take X = {1, 2, 3, . . . , 10} and let f be the rule that for each x â X, f (x) = rx , where rx is the remainder when x2 is divided by 11. Explicitly then f (1) = 1 f (2) = 4 f (3) = 9 f (4) = 5 f (5) = 3 f (6) = 3 f (7) = 5 f (8) = 9 f (9) = 4 f (10) = 1. The image of f is the set Y = {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}.

1.5 Example (function) Take X = {1, 2, 3, . . . , 1050 } and let f be the rule f (x) = rx , where rx is the remainder when x2 is divided by 1050 + 1 for all x â X. Here it is not feasible to write down f explicitly as in Example 1.4, but nonetheless the function is completely specified by the domain and the mathematical description of the rule f . (i) 1-1 functions 1.6 Definition A function (or transformation) is 1 â 1 (one-to-one) if each element in the codomain Y is the image of at most one element in the domain X. 1.7 Definition A function (or transformation) is onto if each element in the codomain Y is the image of at least one element in the domain. Equivalently, a function f : X ââ Y is onto if Im(f ) = Y . 1.8 Definition If a function f : X ââ Y is 1â1 and Im(f ) = Y , then f is called a bijection. 1.9 Fact If f : X ââ Y is 1 â 1 then f : X ââ Im(f ) is a bijection. In particular, if f : X ââ Y is 1 â 1, and X and Y are finite sets of the same size, then f is a bijection. In terms of the schematic representation, if f is a bijection, then each element in Y has exactly one arrowed line incident with it. The functions described in Examples 1.3 and 1.4 are not bijections. In Example 1.3 the element 3 is not the image of any element in the domain. In Example 1.4 each element in the codomain has two preimages. 1.10 Definition If f is a bijection from X to Y then it is a simple matter to define a bijection g from Y to X as follows: for each y â Y define g(y) = x where x â X and f (x) = y. This function g obtained from f is called the inverse function of f and is denoted by g = f â1 .

1.11 Example (inverse function) Let X = {a, b, c, d, e}, and Y = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and consider the rule f given by the arrowed edges in Figure 1.3. f is a bijection and its inverse g is formed simply by reversing the arrows on the edges. The domain of g is Y and the codomain is X. Note that if f is a bijection, then so is f â1 . In cryptography bijections are used as the tool for encrypting messages and the inverse transformations are used to decrypt. This will be made clearer in Â§1.4 when some basic terminology is introduced. Notice that if the transformations were not bijections then it would not be possible to always decrypt to a unique message. (ii) One-way functions There are certain types of functions which play significant roles in cryptography. At the expense of rigor, an intuitive definition of a one-way function is given. 1.12 Definition A function f from a set X to a set Y is called a one-way function if f (x) is âeasyâ to compute for all x â X but for âessentially allâ elements y â Im(f ) it is âcomputationally infeasibleâ to find any x â X such that f (x) = y. 1.13 Note (clarification of terms in Definition 1.12) (i) A rigorous definition of the terms âeasyâ and âcomputationally infeasibleâ is necessary but would detract from the simple idea that is being conveyed. For the purpose of this chapter, the intuitive meaning will suffice. (ii) The phrase âfor essentially all elements in Y â refers to the fact that there are a few values y â Y for which it is easy to find an x â X such that y = f (x). For example, one may compute y = f (x) for a small number of x values and then for these, the inverse is known by table look-up. An alternate way to describe this property of a one-way function is the following: for a random y â Im(f ) it is computationally infeasible to find any x â X such that f (x) = y. The concept of a one-way function is illustrated through the following examples. 1.14 Example (one-way function) Take X = {1, 2, 3, . . . , 16} and define f (x) = rx for all x â X where rx is the remainder when 3x is divided by 17. Explicitly, x f (x)

Given a number between 1 and 16, it is relatively easy to find the image of it under f . However, given a number such as 7, without having the table in front of you, it is harder to find

x given that f (x) = 7. Of course, if the number you are given is 3 then it is clear that x = 1 is what you need; but for most of the elements in the codomain it is not that easy. One must keep in mind that this is an example which uses very small numbers; the important point here is that there is a difference in the amount of work to compute f (x) and the amount of work to find x given f (x). Even for very large numbers, f (x) can be computed efficiently using the repeated square-and-multiply algorithm (Algorithm 2.143), whereas the process of finding x from f (x) is much harder. 1.15 Example (one-way function) A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 whose only positive integer divisors are 1 and itself. Select primes p = 48611, q = 53993, form n = pq = 2624653723, and let X = {1, 2, 3, . . . , n â 1}. Define a function f on X by f (x) = rx for each x â X, where rx is the remainder when x3 is divided by n. For instance, f (2489991) = 1981394214 since 24899913 = 5881949859 Â· n + 1981394214. Computing f (x) is a relatively simple thing to do, but to reverse the procedure is much more difficult; that is, given a remainder to find the value x which was originally cubed (raised to the third power). This procedure is referred to as the computation of a modular cube root with modulus n. If the factors of n are unknown and large, this is a difficult problem; however, if the factors p and q of n are known then there is an efficient algorithm for computing modular cube roots. (See Â§8.2.2(i) for details.) Example 1.15 leads one to consider another type of function which will prove to be fundamental in later developments. (iii) Trapdoor one-way functions 1.16 Definition A trapdoor one-way function is a one-way function f : X ââ Y with the additional property that given some extra information (called the trapdoor information) it becomes feasible to find for any given y â Im(f ), an x â X such that f (x) = y. Example 1.15 illustrates the concept of a trapdoor one-way function. With the additional information of the factors of n = 2624653723 (namely, p = 48611 and q = 53993, each of which is five decimal digits long) it becomes much easier to invert the function. The factors of 2624653723 are large enough that finding them by hand computation would be difficult. Of course, any reasonable computer program could find the factors relatively quickly. If, on the other hand, one selects p and q to be very large distinct prime numbers (each having about 100 decimal digits) then, by todayâs standards, it is a difficult problem, even with the most powerful computers, to deduce p and q simply from n. This is the wellkno
