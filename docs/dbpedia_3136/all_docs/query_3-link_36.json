        "text": "Suppose $P = NP$ and a fast linear-time algorithm for SAT appears tomorrow. Suddenly RSA is insecure, much of our modern communication system is broken, and we need to reconsider how to keep secrets from each other.\n\nQuestion: Is there a good single reference (or short list) to gain a big-picture view of what is possible in crypto (and in the allied field of \"security\") without intractability assumptions? This could save civilization one day, and would also be nice to peruse in the meantime.\n\nDiscussion: Most of the cryptographic tasks we now study (OWFs, PRGs, PKE) are provably impossible in the $P = NP$ world (a world dubbed \"Algorithmica\" in an influential essay by Impagliazzo), but some things remain possible: communication with a one-time pad; distributed secret sharing; private info retrieval; and some other nice things. (Certain kinds of physical mechanisms such as locked boxes, devices implementing oblivious transfer, and quantum states can also come in handy. Of course there is always some kind of physical assumption about who can see what information.)\n\nOne can distinguish between information-theoretic security (which works against a computationally unbounded adversary) and \"unconditional\" security (which may require a bounded adversary, but still shows security under no unproven assumptions). I'm most interested in the info-theoretic case.\n\nFor starters, here is one bibliography of information-theoretic security (which, for my purposes, is unmanageably long and disparate).\n\n$\\begingroup$\n\nSome research groups in Europe have pursued this line of research; more specifically, because of my interest in information theory I have ran into the work of Ueli Maurer and his school, which is both significant from purely information theoretic point of view (which I am more familiar with) and also offers some practical approaches to information theoretic security.\n\nRelated to the above line of work, some places you might want to consider looking at are the PhD thesis of Christian Cachin and also Renato Renner (more quantum).\n\nOf course, there is a whole different approach with keywords including BB84, Preskill-Shor, Artur Ekert, etc.\n\nThe above of course only reflects my limited experience, and surely there are many more approaches and interesting lines of work.\n\nanswered Dec 5, 2013 at 4:32\n\nMohammad BavarianMohammad Bavarian\n\n33111 silver badge77 bronze badges\n\n$\\endgroup$"
