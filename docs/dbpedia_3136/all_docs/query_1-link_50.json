        "text": "This is SAC week (i.e. Selected Areas in Cryptography). Now in its twenty first year, this is the annual meeting for cryptographers in Canada. There is always an international programme of papers being presented, and the location is a Canadian city. Given the name there is always a specific focus for the SAC conference; there is a definite bias towards symmetric cryptography and number theory. Given this it is fitting that Antoine Joux was the non-Canadian PC chair for this year, since Antoine's work spans both symmetric and number theoretic aspects of cryptography. The local PC chair was Amr Youssef from Concordia University in Montreal.\n\nThere were three invited talks this year, one by myself and one by my co-author Pierrick Gaudry, who talked about the Number Field Sieve (NFS) algorithm as applied to factoring integers and discrete logarithms. The third invited talk was by another co-author of mine, this was by Alfred Menezes, who gave a talk celebrating the life, achievements and impact of Scott Vanstone who sadly died earlier this year."
