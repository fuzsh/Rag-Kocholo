It gathers together all the Koblitz-Menezes papers critiquing provable security:\n\nanotherlook.ca\n\nThere is plenty of stuff in these papers about elliptic curves and elliptic curve public key cryptography.\n\nThe papers contain a number of interesting remarks and valid points. But there is plenty to argue about and disagree with as well. They are great papers to read in a group of crypto researchers/students.\n\n— Steven Galbraith"
