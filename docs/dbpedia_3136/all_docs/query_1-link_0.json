        "text": "Cryptographer\n\nAlfred Menezes is co-author of several books on cryptography, including the Handbook of Applied Cryptography, and is a professor of mathematics at the University of Waterloo in Canada.[2]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nAlfred Menezes' family is from Goa, a state in western India, but he was born in Tanzania and grew up in Kuwait except for a few years at a boarding school in India. His undergraduate and post-graduate degrees are from the University of Waterloo.[3]: 302\n\nAcademic career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter five years teaching at Auburn University, in 1997 he returned to the University of Waterloo, where he is now a professor of mathematics in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization. He co-founded and is a member of the Centre for Applied Cryptographic Research, and has served as its Managing Director.[4] Menezes' main areas of research are Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), provable security, and related areas. He is a Canadian citizen.\n\nMenezes' book Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptosystems, published in 1993,[5] was the first book devoted entirely to ECC. He co-authored the widely-used reference book Handbook of Applied Cryptography.[6]\n\nIn 2001 Menezes won the Hall Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications.\n\nMenezes has been a conference organizer or program committee member for approximately fifty conferences on Cryptography.[7] He was Program Chair for Crypto 2007, and in 2012 he was an invited speaker at Eurocrypt.[8]\n\nMenezes, in co-operation with Neal Koblitz, authored a series of Another Look papers that describe errors or weaknesses in existing security proofs, the first being Another look at HMAC (2013). The two now maintain a website dedicated to this type of papers.[9]\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nAlfred J. Menezes; Paul C. van Oorschot & Scott A. Vanstone (1996). Handbook of Applied Cryptography.
