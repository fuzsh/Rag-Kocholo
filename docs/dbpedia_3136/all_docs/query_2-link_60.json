This document summarizes and analyzes a statement released by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) in August 2015 regarding the need for post-quantum cryptography. The statement was puzzling because it suggested that the NSA was distancing itself from elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and viewed it only as a temporary solution until quantum-safe algorithms are ready, surprising many in the cryptography community who believe ECC will be widely used for decades. The document aims to evaluate various theories for the NSA's change in stance regarding ECC.",
