        "text": "This is a simpler statement than it seems. If a language $\\mathcal{L}$ is in $\\mathsf{NP}$, and you prove that $\\mathcal{L} \\not\\in \\mathsf{P}$, then this is a proof that $\\mathsf{P} \\neq \\mathsf{NP}$.\n\nThe book itself doesn't define a decision version of the ECDLP problem, so I'll define one here. Given $(\\mathcal{E}, n, d, G, H)$ where $\\mathcal{E}$ is an elliptic curve, $G \\in \\mathcal{E}$ is a point of order $n$, $d \\leq n$ is an integer, and $H \\in \\mathcal{E}$, is there an integer $k \\leq d$ such that $kG = H$?\n\nThis problem is in $\\mathsf{NP}$, with the witness being $k$. It is also equivalent to the search-ECDLP problem, since you can find $k$ in logarithmically many steps by doing binary search with the choice of $d$ (there's some bookeeping necessary here, e.g., what if the adversary is fallible; this is resolved by running the reduction multiple times using the rerandomization property: you can create a fresh ECDLP problem by setting $G' = rG$ and $H' = rH$ for a uniform $r \\gets \\mathbb{F}$).\n\nSince the above problem in $\\mathsf{NP}$, proving it to not be in $\\mathsf{P}$ implies $\\mathsf{P} \\neq \\mathsf{NP}$."
