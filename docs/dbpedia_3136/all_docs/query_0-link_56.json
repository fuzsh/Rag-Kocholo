        "text": "A New Approach on Bilinear Pairingsand Its Applications Tatsuaki Okamoto\n\nAre Alfred Menezes, O. and Scott Vanstone such persons by their attack to ECC in 1990? No, it is not true! Who Used Bilinear Pairings in Cryptography for the First Time?\n\nUnsung Hero in Pairing-Based Cryptography Burt Kaliski In his PhD thesis in 1988, he did a pioneer work on bilinear pairings for a cryptographic application.\n\nContents • A general construction of pseudo-random generatorsover general Abelian groups. • A typical example: construction on general elliptic curves. • It is necessary to determine the group structure of the underlying curve. Weil pairing is employed.\n\nMOV Reduction • 1988: PhD Thesis of B. Kaliski • 1990: Menezes, O. and Vanstone read his thesis and learnt the cryptographic application of the Weil pairing and Miller’s algorithm. We then found the reduction of ECDL to MDL by using the Weil pairing.\n\nReply message from Kaliski Victor Miller visited Ron Rivest when I was a graduate student, and he met with me about my research. If I recall correctly, I asked him if he knew a way to determine whether an elliptic curve group was cyclic, and he suggested the Weil pairing. He also gave me a copy of his algorithm for computing the Weil pairing, and agreed that I could implement it for my thesis.\n\nA New Approach on Bilinear Pairingsand Its Applications Joint Work with Katsuyuki Takashima (Mitsubishi Electric)\n\nPairing-Based Cryptography\n\nWhy Did Pairing-Based Cryptography So Succeed?
