        "text": "My dear fellow colleagues,\n\nAfter having passed CISSP last year I would like to get more knowledge on cryptography. Practical stuff like lifecycle, key management, crypto-period, best type of algo for specific usage, cloud & in-house HSM for keygen and signing etc...\n\nThe intro in CISSP was great but I want more hands on, use-case knowledge etc... Any books or online courses that you could recommend me ? Fyi, I'm less interested in the mathematical side of things.\n\nThank you for your advice\n\nHi @benjaminb\n\nThere is a stack of resources available on this subject: Just doing an Amazon.com look for books on cryptography for instance will turn up:\n\nSerious Cryptography: A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption - November 2017\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593278268/ref=s9_acsd_zwish_hd_bw_b10V_c_x_2_w/143-9844400-565591...\n\nApplied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C - 20th edition\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1119096723/ref=rdr_ext_tmb#reader_1119096723\n\nBut if you have access to University or IEEE resources, they have plenty of resources open to you to study with the appropriate level of mathematics.\n\nRegards\n\nCautim_Cautim\n\nBut whilst you at it, I suggest you also look at Quantum Cryptography, which will make most of the traditional algorithms redundant.\n\nIf you have a CA you need HSM's to protect your private keys. Cloud HSM's are in their infancy and VERY costly. I am still recommending on-prem HSM's until the market has more competition/saturation/security to be able to recommend cloud solutions for that. One of my close fishing buddies is with a leading HSM vendor and over plastic baits and missed hooksets we discuss this. Amazon uses this vendors gear and I know firsthand how it is designed. Remember that unless the HSM is FULLY in YOUR control you are NOT in control of your private keys.\n\nIn my world, as contractor to FEDCIV and DoD, I'm always supporting the internal CA for those tokens issued to admins and internal certs issued to servers (SSL).\n\nPersonally, I read vendor literature more then I do anything else. That is where you learn the technology. Key in on MS AD and CA tech. When you have LDAP, CA and auth all tied together you learn a lot!\n\nIs a good rabbit hole to go into. I have worked both offensive and defensive security in my 15 yrs. Currently focusing on Cryptographic solutions for a financial services organization. I recommend further reading as suggested, but to also follow what some of the vendors are doing.\n\nhttps://software.microfocus.com/en-us/products/voltage-data-encryption-security/overview\n\nhttps://www.pkware.com/\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/guardium-file-and-database-encryption\n\nIn the grand scheme of things it is all about data protection. Protecting data at rest, data in use, data in transit. Congrats on passing your exam and welcome to the ISC2 family...."
