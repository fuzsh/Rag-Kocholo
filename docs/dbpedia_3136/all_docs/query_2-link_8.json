        "text": "In our current era, we are continuously witnessing remarkable and rapid advances in quantum computing. However, at a recent meeting in Princeton, I recall a leading experimentalist telling me: ‚ÄúThe idea that quantum computing is just an engineering problem now is total nonsense!‚Äù That is, achieving reliable large-scale quantum computers will still critically rely on novel innovations coming from fundamental research in the field. This perspective motivates the Foundations of Quantum Computational Advantage collaboration (FoQaCiA) and their exciting conference, which Perimeter Institute will be hosting next month. The deadline for the submission of abstracts is coming up soon: April 2nd.\n\nGlad to hear that the United Nations has declared 2025 as the of International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. 100 years ago scientific breakthroughs led to an entirely new understanding of nature at its fundamental level. Based on this, we are now seeing amazing advances in the fundamental engineering of controlling individual quantum states and their interactions. And this is opening up radically new technological avenues, for example for high-precision measurement processes and new methods for transmitting and processing information. Much more to come in the next years and decades. https://lnkd.in/dEkxANmu https://lnkd.in/dNaXytRi\n\nIn the current issue of Nature Physics (Nature Portfolio), I argue with my always-inspiring colleagues Eline de Jong and Mauritz Kop that the time has come to consider appropriate #guardrails to ensure quantum technology benefits humanity and the planet. With quantum development still in flux, we call upon the science community to define principles and practices for responsible quantum innovation. https://lnkd.in/ej7EuY4J The governance of quantum-based technologies is one of the core areas of inquiry at the Quantum Social Lab at TUM Think Tank, co-led by Fabienne Marco, in collaboration with the Stanford Center for Responsible Quantum Technology led by Mauritz. Up next is the 2nd Annual Stanford Responsible Quantum Technology Conference, where Constanze Albrecht and I will present initial findings from Thailand as part of our project \"Building Global Capacity for Responsible Quantum Technologies.\" https://lnkd.in/ezYvfDMH #guardrails #quantum #responsibleinnovation cc: Technical University of Munich, Stanford University Hochschule f√ºr Politik M√ºnchen More on GUARDRAILS in our new book https://guardrails.design/, with Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger\n\nüì£ On April 25, experts from leading knowledge institutions in the Netherlands gathered at the invitation of Centre for Quantum and Society and Rathenau Instituut to share their analyses of the societal impact of quantum technology and how they influence its development. üí° The purpose of the meeting was not only to learn from each other's analyses and efforts but also to foster collaboration and strengthen each other's activities. Given the multifaceted impact of quantum technology, a wide range of topics were addressed, including: ‚úîThe geopolitical dimension of quantum technology and bridging gaps between countries. ‚úîStrategic autonomy and informing political and governance entities. ‚úîHarnessing the economic potential of quantum technology and promoting responsible innovation. ‚úîDifferent transformation phases of embedding the technology and roles of stakeholders in key processes. ‚úîSecurity and sustainability considerations of quantum technology. ‚úîSocietal participation in decision-making and shaping perceptions. ‚úîBridging businesses with science, education, and skills. Key stakeholders in this field, such as WRR - Netherlands Scientific Council for Government Policy ECP Platform voor de InformatieSamenleving, Stichting Toekomstbeeld der Techniek (STT) and @WAAG Society were invited, to engage in discussions. ü§ùThe afternoon will lead to further actions, with Centre for Quantum and Society and the Rathenau Instituut taking on coordinating roles. Quantum technology is standing at the crossroads of science and society, with some parts already in the market, others being worked on in laboratories, and some still in the realm of future possibilities. In this developmental phase, it is of most importance to look at choices and opportunities to align developments with societal values, and to ensure that technology contributes responsibly to the economy and societal challenges. üß† Would you like to contribute to these discussions?
