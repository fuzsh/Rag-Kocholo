        "meta_description": "1 recommender | 1 mention | 1 collection | After 18 years of research and development, elliptic curve cryptography has gained widespread exposure and acceptance in the commercial world. Industry, banking, and government standards have been drafted to facilitate widespread deployment.\n\nThis book is the first to provide a comprehensive treatment of the practical aspects of elliptic curve cryptography. It explains the basic mathematics, provides detailed descriptions of state-in-the-art in methods for efficient implementation, and presents standardized protocols for public-key encryption, digital signatures, and key establishment. Also considered are some issues that arise in software and hardware implementation, side-channel attacks and countermeasures, and efficient parameter generation.\n\nWritten by professors who have extensive experience studying the security of elliptic curve cryptography, its implementation, and industrial applications, this book is an important resource for security professionals, developers, and implementers.\n\nA broad overview and guide to one of the most widely used cryptosystems in wireless devices and smartcards today. The authors are some of the key researchers and developers of the EEC standards technology. Essential reference for any practitioners or professionals incomputer science, computer engineering, network design, and network/data security.\n\n(From Goodreads)",

        "text": "If you want to implement elliptic curves, this book is a must read. It’s essentially a comprehensive guide on all of the arithmetic needed to implement curves, from finite fields, to various approaches to adding points, to scalar multiplication, etc.\n\nA lot of less popular kinds of elliptic curves are also prominently feature in this book, such as optimal curves over optimal extension fields. This probably reflects the point in time where this book was written, where we hadn’t yet settled on a few curves over prime fields.\n\nI still use this book as a reference quite a bit. Most recently, I needed to implement a binary field, and I referenced the algorithms in this book heavily.\n\nOne downside of this book is its age, so it doesn’t feature some of the newer constant time ladders for scalar multiplication, among other things. There’s been some interesting work here in recent years, like “Complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic curves”. Obviously, this book couldn’t have referenced a paper written 10 years in the future, but an updated version of this book might be interesting to incorporate these aspects. Some material on pairings would be nice in an updated version as well.\n\nIf you want to implement elliptic curves from scratch, this book is a valuable reference."
