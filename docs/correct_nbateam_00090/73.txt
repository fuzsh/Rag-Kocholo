The Golden State Warriors re-signed centre Andris Biedrins to a six-year, $62-million US contract on Monday.

Biedrins, a restricted free agent, was the third core player retained by the Warriors in the past week, joining Monta Ellis and Kelenna Azubuike.

"I'm looking forward to building on some of the success that we have had in the last couple of years," Biedrins said.

Biedrins played 76 games last season, averaging 10.5 points, 9.8 rebounds, 1.2 blocked shots, 1.0 assists and 27.4 minutes.

The Latvian native led the NBA in shooting at 62.6 per cent.

Biedrins has averaged 7.6 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and 22.8 minutes in 256 NBA appearances since he was drafted 11th overall by the Warriors in 2004.

"We're extremely happy to have Andris under contract for many years to come," Warriors executive Chris Mullin said. "He is clearly one of the top young centres in the NBA and, much like [Ellis], he has continued to improve every season.

"It is not easy to find quality young big men in this league. But we certainly think we have one of them and he is only 22 years old."

Golden State made several other moves this off-season, replacing Baron Davis with fellow free agent Corey Maggette, inking Ronny Turiaf to an offer sheet and trading for Marcus Williams.
