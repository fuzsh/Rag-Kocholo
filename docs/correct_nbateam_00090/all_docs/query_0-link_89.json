        "text": "by Marcel Mutoni\n\nIn less than a week’s time, the Golden State Warriors have committed themselves to over $120 million on the salaries of two young (largely unproven players). Even the Knicks are blushing.\n\nIt turns out that Andris Biedrins isn’t going to bolt for Europe after all; the Latvian big is all set to sign his name on a new six-year deal with the Warriors.\n\nFrom the San Fransisco Chronicle:\n\nThe Warriors completed their mission of retaining their top two young players by reaching an agreement with Andris Biedrins on a six-year, $63 million deal Sunday.\n\nBiedrins flew to the Bay Area on Sunday night, according to his agent Bill Duffy, and plans to sign the contract today. “This shows the Warriors following through on their commitment to Monta and Andris,” Duffy said. “Andris is absolutely thrilled.”\n\nHe should be thrilled; that kind of money is going to buy a lot of hair gel.\n\nBiedrins, who averaged a virtual double-double last season, left Golden State with little choice but to pay him – frighteningly enough, he’s practically their lone presence on the inside.\n\nNow, quick, someone take away Chris Mullin’s checkbook before it catches fire."
