He certainly has the tools to suceed, it will remain to be seen whether he has the will to grab hold of his talent. Biedrins played for BK Skonto representing his hometwon of Riga, Latvia. In eleven games for the Euro league (2003-2004), Andris averaged 18.6 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.82 blocks.\n\nDuring the 2006-07, under the eye of Don Nelson, Biedrins (and Monta Ellis) started to blossom. Biedrins found himself in the starting lineup regularly and playing during crunchtime despite his poor free-throw shooting. As of this posting, Biedrins is averaging 10pts and 9.7 rebounds.\n\nIBN Facts: Andris earns about 1.5 millions a year which makes Biedrins the youngest millionaire in Latvia.\n\nQuotes: Andris Biedrins should be a top-five center at some point… – Kelly Dwyer of CNN/SI.com"
