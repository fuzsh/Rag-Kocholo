        "text": "Barbieri: Howard may not like it much, but I think you’re right – I think it did give you the best chance to win, especially shorthanded like that. Mark Jackson: The score is 22-13 in the first quarter, and after Dre (Andris Biedrins) picks up his foul we have to take him out, and Ekpe Udoh comes into the game. The very first play, Dwight Howard spins, gets to the rim and dunks it. We were smaller, and physically he’s so dominant, so we had no other option – and he’s a bad free-throw shooter. If you look at the numbers, 21-for-39 is nothing to be proud of. It gave us a chance to be in control of that game. We did it for three reasons: because he’s a bad free-throw shooter, to eliminate his dominance and then to eliminate their three-point shooting. It took them out of rhythm offensively.\n\nAfter the draft, teams got to (and get to) determine the height of their employees. This is what you see on the player card, and this is what largely informs the public idea of how tall a player is. There is a yearly physical to keep tabs, though teams rarely make changes. For example, the Warriors informed me that Andris Biedrins is their only player to receive a height alteration over the last decade, due to a spurt that took him from 6-11 to 7-0.\n\nJackson is also the coach who, when asked on the first day of camp whether Biedrins was definitely his starting center, replied, “He’s definitely a center on this basketball team.” So at least no one is hiding the fact that Biedrins begins the season needing to win over his own team. “It is what it is,” said Biedrins, who put on 15 pounds in the offseason. “Obviously I didn’t play my game the last two seasons, and I don’t blame them if they started looking for another guy because I was not really great the last two seasons. That’s the way the business is. There is nothing you can do about it. Just come back and play strong and show them again that you are worth having around now.”\n\nAt this point, the Warriors’ brass only whispers about his progress, afraid to mess with it. But the buzz heading into Saturday’s exhibition opener at Oracle Arena against Sacramento can be best described by three words from point guard Stephen Curry: “Dre is back.” “I worked as hard as I’ve ever worked,” said, Biedrins, 25, entering his eighth season. “I got my life together. Had a son. There was a lockout, so I had a long offseason. Everything just came together. It was the perfect time to work on everything.”"
