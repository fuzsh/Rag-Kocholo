        "text": "ATLANTA — Warriors center Andris Biedrins will not play today in Atlanta because of a sprained left ankle, and might miss this entire five-game road trip. And he said it’s irritating him to no end.\n\n“I know it’s nothing major,” Biedrins said after watching the team’s Tuesday evening practice at Philips Arena. “It’s an ankle. But still. I mean, I want to play all the time. I missed so much last year. Now this injury is taking a little bit longer than we thought. It’s just frustrating.”\n\nAfter missing most of last year with abdominal issues, Biedrins now has missed five straight games. Today’s game against the Hawks will make six, and there is no end in sight.\n\nBiedrins said he hasn’t been able to do anything on his left ankle. It’s still a little swollen and painful.\n\nBefore the team’s flight Tuesday, Biedrins received his second PRP shot — an injection of concentrated platelets to stimulate recovery — which keeps him out for 48 hours.\n\nBiedrins called it “frustrating” to have to sit and watch, especially watching the Warriors get dominated on the boards.\n\nIn their past four games, the Warriors have been out-rebounded by an average of 12 per game. During that same span, opponents have grabbed 76 offensive rebounds.\n\n“That second guy you know is going to rebound,” coach Keith Smart said. “The most important thing for us is to rebound. David (Lee) is doing his job, getting to the glass and rebounding. We’re just not having the other guys do their part right now. You miss the traffic rebounds, that’s what you’re missing (without Biedrins).”\n\nBiedrins said he’s hoping to see some signs of progress in the next couple of days. But he said he won’t rush back, even if it means skipping this road trip so he can be fully healthy for the upcoming homestand.\n\nAfter this road trip, the Warriors play 18 of the next 22 at home. Biedrins said that stretch is perhaps the most critical of the season and he doesn’t want to come back too soon, get reinjured, and miss time during that stretch.\n\n“January and February, we have so many home games,” Biedrins said. “I’m not rushing things. We haven’t set any date for me to come back, whether it’s going to be on this road trip or not. I’ll make sure it is totally healthy. I’d rather be 100 percent for all those home games coming up because that’s the most important push of the season. We have to really take care of the next month and a half.”\n\nBut more frustrating than watching his absence hurt his team, Biedrins said, is thinking he’s back and ready to play, only to be hurt again.\n\nLast season, Biedrins missed most of November and December with a abdominal injury. He returned, played 28 more games, then was lost for the rest of the season after surgery to repair a tear in his abdominal muscle.\n\n“I had this experience before,” Biedrins said. “You think you can play. You just have to make sure you take the time. That injury will bug you all season long. Better to wait some more days than to (come back early and) miss a lot after that.”\n\nNote: Warriors rookie guard Jeremy Lin was in uniform Tuesday night for the Reno Bighorns, who are led by former Warriors coach Eric Musselman. Lin, who was assigned to the NBA Development League to get some game experience, is with a familiar face. The starting point guard for the Bighorns is Aaron Miles, who was in Warriors training camp with Lin."
