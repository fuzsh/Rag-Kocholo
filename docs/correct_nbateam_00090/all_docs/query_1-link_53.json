He played his last six NBA games with the Jazz before he was waived. Biedrins spoke to the Bay Area News Group over the phone from Latvia.\n\nStephen Curry: Curry is playing his 12th season with the Warriors. Already the franchise’s all-time leader in assists and 3-pointers, he’s on track to catch several all-time greats.\n\nMonta Ellis: Ellis was traded by Golden State to Milwaukee in 2012, where he played two seasons before finishing his 12-year career in Dallas and then Indiana. In seven seasons with the Warriors, Ellis averaged nearly 20 points and five assists per game. Now he lives in Dallas, where he runs a basketball training school called “Ellis Elite.”\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/1GRrVIqXr2i5GysbR78cDW?si=VKRyAKBlT3CYbb18OKED9g\n\nStephen Jackson: Since he last played in the NBA in 2014, Jackson has remained in the public eye with his podcast “All The Smoke” and through his activism following the 2020 death of his friend George Floyd.\n\nRonny Turiaf: Turiaf, who grew up in France and played collegiately at Gonzaga, played 10 seasons in the NBA. After stints with the Warriors, Lakers and Knicks, Turiaf won the 2012 championship as a member of the Miami Heat. He last played in 2015. He spoke to the Bay Area News Group over the phone from Portugal.\n\nREAD THE STORY: As Steph Curry nears Wilt’s Warriors record, ’09-10 teammates recall his first basket\n\nWarriors’ all-time leaders in points (for now)\n\n1.
