        "text": "The new amnesty clause in the NBA labor deal could be the Knicks’ salvation.\n\nThe Knicks are hampered during upcoming free agency because they are only willing to hand out one-year deals to protect 2012 cap space for the free-agent bonanza. Signing a player who gets through the new amnesty process may be an alternate solution.\n\nTwo names who have popped onto the Knicks’ radar as potential amnesty casualties are Warriors 7-foot defensive center Andris Biedrins and Heat small-forward sharpshooter Mike Miller, whom the Knicks coveted during free agency in 2010.\n\nThe Knicks are desperate to land a defensive big man to slot alongside Amar’e Stoudemire, and the pickings are slim in free-agency for players willing to take one-year contracts. Knicks brass held meetings yesterday to discuss options.\n\nBiedrins, a good shot-blocker, rebounder and post defender, has been mentioned as a potential amnesty casualty with $27 million left on his pact, especially if the Warriors land a big man during free agency as they plan to do.\n\nThe Heat reportedly may amnesty Miller, who has already put his house up for sale. The kicker to the new amnesty clause is the players first are made available to teams under the cap, and those teams will each make bids for the players they want. The Knicks are over the cap this season.\n\nThe marquee amnesty candidates — including Brandon Roy, Baron Davis, Marvin Williams, Richard Jefferson and Rashard Lewis — probably will be scooped up before they hit the free-agent market.\n\nBiedrins, who has disappointed offensively, and Miller, coming off an injury-plagued season in which he injured both thumbs and his shoulder, will probably slip through the cracks.\n\nWhether they’d accept one-year deals for the veterans’ minimum ($1.4 million) or a portion of the Knicks’ $5 million mid-level exception is the question.\n\nMiller showed great interest in the Knicks 16 months ago. In fact, he was the first player they met with once the free-agent signing period began.\n\nReports are Miami so desperately needs a center and would be constricted with its mid-level exception under the new CBA if Miller puts it into the luxury-tax bracket.\n\nThe 6-7 Miller, limited to 41 games last season and a dud in The Finals, does nothing to help the Knicks’ height or defense, but coach Mike D’Antoni could use a 3-point sniper off the bench for his speedball offense after the Carmelo Anthony trade.\n\nBiedrins, from Latvia, is the most intriguing Knicks option. Though his offense has not improved in his six seasons in Golden State, he would be a blessing in the paint with that wingspan.\n\nBiedrins played 59 games last season, averaging 7.2 rebounds and 5 points. Recent reports have Golden State leaning toward using Charlie Bell as an amnesty, which would leave the Knicks still desperate for a center.\n\nKurt Thomas, Kwame Brown, Aaron Gray, Tony Battie and Theo Ratliff also are on the Knicks’ wish list. But in this condensed free-agency period and camp, the club probably will re-sign Jared Jeffries, who knows the system well despite his lack of impact late last season.\n\nThe Knicks also haven’t ruled out re-signing Shelden Williams, who was picked up in the Anthony trade and started Game 1 against the Celtics . Williams has a working knowledge of the system, too.\n\nThough the Knicks drafted Kentucky 6-foot-9 center Josh Harrellson, sources indicated they probably will get a look at their 2010 second-rounder, 7-footer Jerome Jordan, who is playing in Slovenia with an opt-out clause. The agent for Jordan, Todd Ramasar, told The Post Sunday he would demand a trade if Jordan isn’t invited to camp."
