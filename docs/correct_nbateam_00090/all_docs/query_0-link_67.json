Hixson did not clear waivers like the Golden State Warriors had hoped, being picked up by the Portland Trailblazers in the 11th hour before the W's take on the New Orleans Hornets. Golden State had hoped to nab him after he cleared to help with some extra front court depth, but Portland got to him first.\n\nVia Matt Steinmetz on Twitter:\n\nTo further put salt in the W's wounded big men, Andris Biedrins will not be suiting up this evening either, leaving an already hobbled David Lee to take even more of the Lion's share tonight with Stephen Curry on the bench with injury as well.\n\nHopefully the dubstitues are ready to go tonight, because it's going to take the whole team to get out of their current losing streak tonight."
