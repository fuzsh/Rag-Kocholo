        "text": "For the Warriors, Andris Biedrins is worth … (FILL IN THE BLANK).\n\nThis is a good mental exercise, coming off of MT-2’s confirmation and amplification/explanation yesterday of Richard Justice’s post-draft report that the Rockets tried to get Biedrins from the Warriors on draft night and will continue to try to get him.\n\nMT-2 reports that the Rockets have offered Jordan Hill and/or Hasheem Thabeet (the two players’ salaries combined would make the numbers work), and that the Warriors aren’t interested in those names so far.\n\nThey want more than two players who, even with Biedrins bottoming out last season, probably won’t ever be as good as Biedrins is now.\n\nFirst natural reaction: The Warriors have a taker for Biedrins’ remaining $27M and they’re not jumping at the offer?\n\nBut then you think about it a little…\n\nReally, it’s like a personality/attitude/history test, because Biedrins is worth many different things to many different people, and it does change every season or every month or perhaps every week.\n\n* If you realize he just turned 25, is a career 59.5% FG shooter with good rebound numbers for most of his six-season career, and that young centers always have value in the NBA, you can easily conclude that Biedrins does and should have value.\n\n-That’s what a few NBA execs have cotinued to believe over the last two years, even as Biedrins retreated into a shell of lost confidence and utter offensive uselessness.\n\n“Somebody’s going to want him,” one exec warned me when I casually said that Biedrins has zero worth recently. “They’re going to think they can bring him back.”\n\n* If you’ve watched him during his last two seasons with the Warriors, and know that he’s still owed $9M per over the next three seasons, with a FT% plummeting to horrific levels, you might rightly conclude that Biedrins is worth nothing or less than nothing.\n\n-That has been my main position recently, with the caveat that it only takes one team to believe there’s something worth salvaging in Biedrins to boost his trade stock.\n\nIt’s pretty clear now that Houston is one of those teams. Maybe the only team? Not shockingly, the Rockets are a very stats-oriented team, and three years ago, Biedrins was one of the most efficient centers in the game.\n\nWhen he was only 22. Summary of his high ponits: He doesn’t demand shots, when he’s right he makes them, he plays help defense and he can rebound.\n\nAgain: He’s only 25.\n\nMy general thesis on Biedrins is that he had no value for the Warriors, that they could get almost nothing for him, but that he might do fairly well in another situation if that team understood his limitations and played to his strengths.\n\nHouston’s interest shows that, at least by degree, I was wrong on that, depending, of course, on what the Rockets were and are actually offering.\n\n* I’d guess the Warriors find themselves in the middle of the two extremes.\n\n-They realize that Biedrins has value, especially because they have few other options at center. He’s better than Thabeet. Period.\n\nBiedrins is still probably a better center option at this moment than Ekpe Udoh.\n\n-But the GSWs have had an up-close view of Biedrins’ plummet, they’ve winced through all those free-throw clunkers, they’ve been frustrated (Riley, especially), and logically aren’t counting him to do much for them in the short- or long-term.\n\nAgain, it’s a multi-faceted situation.\n\nJoe Lacob & Co. realize that part of Biedrins’ decline is due to Biedrins’ fragile offensive game, which might now be lost forever, and if he can’t do anything offensively, his defense struggles, too. And Biedrins has never been a great one-on-one defender vs. big centers.\n\nWhich means you can never play him next to David Lee. Ever.\n\nSo how valuable is Biedrins practically to the Warriors, strictly as a player? Not very.\n\nBut the Warriors also have to know that when Biedrins is healthy and tied into a good situation–as he was with Baron Davis and Stephen Jackson–he can do a lot of good things, and he will always be 6-11.\n\nA lot of Biedrins’ remaining value is also tied into a tacit condemnation of the Warriors’ past management style of hyping up young players beyond their actual performance level, then carelessly letting them atrophy with under-coaching, then getting enraged at them when they do not meet the hyped expectations.\n\nA few teams just believe the GSWs (mostly Don Nelson) screwed up Biedrins beyond belief and that there still is some good basketball left in him.\n\nMy belief is that Lacob wants a new center, and he turned down the potenetial Hill/Thabeet trade proposals because he wants more salary-relief out of a Biedrins deal than that would give him.\n\nIf it’s Hill + Thabeet, that would cut $18M in payroll starting with summer 2012, but would do very little for the coming year’s bottom line.\n\nAnd what Lacob wants is cap flexibility THIS offseason, when he wants to chase Nene (potential unrestricted F/A), Marc Gasol (restricted), DeAndre Jordan (restricted) and maybe a few other centers.\n\nThe Warriors probably would have at most $7-8M to spend on free agency if the payroll stands as it is now, and that probably won’t get one of those A or B-level free-agent centers (in an outright signing of sign-and-trade deal).\n\nSo Lacob needs more money under the cap to do it.\n\nOf course, this all presumes there will be free agency, and that presumes a labor agreement and that would lead to a new CBA, with rules that we cannot yet know.\n\nAnyway…\n\nI think the Warriors aren’t ready to give Biedrins away, unless it’s for substantial cap savings immediately. If Houston can come up with that, then the Warriors should do the deal.\n\nThe Rockets have a $7.3M trade exception (which they got in the Shane Battier deal to Memphis), but my understanding is that TPEs have to fit the incoming salary within $100,000, and that would not work with Biedrins’ $9M slot.\n\nSo it has to be players coming to the Warriors. (You can’t combine a TPE with another player’s salary to make the money work.)\n\nWhich means, to give Lacob big salary relief, it has to be with a team that is under the cap.\n\nThe Rockets won’t be under the cap… until the new league year starts July 1 and Yao comes off (and if they renounce his rights).\n\nBut once July 1 (Friday) is here, the lockout will have started and all movement will cease.\n\nEven if the Warriors wanted to do a relatively salary-neutral deal, it’s going to be almost impossible to do in the next few days–all deals have to be finalized before Friday.\n\nThat includes physicals and other complications, and believe me, any team acquiring Biedrins, with his recent injury history and $27M on the books, is going to want a long look at his X-rays and charts.\n\nBut it is a fascinating exercise. Biedrins is more valuable than I thought, if only because one team thinks it.\n\nWell, counting the Warriors, that’s two teams."
