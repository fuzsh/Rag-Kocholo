        "text": "Free agent forward Andre Iguodala is leaving Denver for the Bay Area — Yahoo! Sports reports that Iggy and the Warriors reached an agreement on a four-year, $48 million deal. This was made possible due to Richard Jefferson, Brandon Rush and Andris Biedrins heading to the Utah Jazz. Per the Contra Costa Times: “Golden State GM Bob Myers and Iguodala’s agent, Rob Pelinka, who worked together as agents, executed complex maze to get a deal done … Golden State drops out of the Dwight Howard chase, clearing the way for long-standing frontrunner Houston to close with the free agent star. […] The Warriors cleared the cap space by trading the expiring contracts of Andris Biedrins, Richard Jefferson and Brandon Rush to Utah. The deal may include multiple picks as well. The deal lands the Warriors an upgrade on the perimeter. According to multiple sources, Iguodala — who Golden State has wanted for a while — wants to play for the Warriors. He’s a big fan of coach Mark Jackson and Stephen Curry, and his game fits the Warriors style of play. Part of the reason, per one source, Iguodala did not sign Sacramento’s four-year, $52 million offer was because he wanted to see if there were a chance he could play for the Warriors.”"
