However in 2003, he delivered his first hit, Sathyam, co-starring Genelia D'Souza. In 2004, he acted in another hit film, Gowri. The year 2005 didn't prove to be lucky for Sumanth as he starred in flop films like Dhana 51 and Mahanandi. However in 2006, Sumanth played the male lead in Sekhar Kammula's Godavari, which is so far the biggest commercial and critically acclaimed film in Sumanth's career.Godavari gave face lift to the motley troop that etched them on to the telugu film field. Dialogues were splendid coming straight from the director Sekhar Kammula. Though it beared resemblances to directors previous film (film)Anand this was unique artwork , highlighting synergy of river backdrop, dialogues, camera , and actors.In 2006, Sumanth had another release, Chinnodu, co-starring Charmme Kaur, who was cast opposite Sumanth in Gowri. Chinnodu turned out to be an average grosser at the box office. His most recent film was Madhumasam and Classmates.

He is most known as Srikanth.\n\nCareer\n\nSrikanth was born in Gangavathi Dist. Koppal, Karnataka. He did B.Com from Karnataka University , Dharwar ,Karnataka, India and got a diploma from film institute. He played minor roles in many films before playing a hero. His first hit film as a hero was PELLI SANDADI which was directed by famous director K.Raghavendra Rao.After that S.V Krishna Reddy gave good hit movies like vinodam,Egire Pavurama.His hit movies are Khadgam,Sankar Dada M.B.B.S,Pellam Orelithe,Kshemanga Velli Labhanga Randi,Oo Chinadana. He currently lives in Jubilee hills, Hyderabad. He is very close to 'Tollywood Mega Star Chiranjeevi'.\n\nHe recently acted in the movie operation duryodhana which was a decent hit and reached the expectation of audience. His character in the movie was bhagavathudu\n\nProfile\n\nHow often do we see people who are outsiders to the film industry, enter it, endeavor through the hardships and secure a unique place for themselves. Srikanth, often referred as the hero with chocolate looks, has come far from the time he entered tollywood with his debut film Peoples Encounter. Born on 23rd March of 1968 in Vijayawada, Srikanth was born and brought up in Gangavathi in Karnataka and studied there till his tenth standard. Later Srikanth graduated from B.Com and being very interested in acting and movies, joined Madhu Film Institute to get experience in acting.\n\nBut as we all know, acting experience alone is not enough to bag great roles in the movie industry. Through lot of dedication and hardwork, Srikanth achieved his first break with the movie, People's Encounter produced by Usha kiran movies under the direction of Mohan Gandhi. After that, he was able to bag villain roles in movies like Sitaratnam Gari Abbayi. The break from villain roles came through when Thammareddy Bharadwaja offered him a role as a hero in One By Two. The movie became a success and paved the way for Srikanth to secure more movie offers. He continued to act in all movies that came in his way for the next one year. One of these movies that is to be mentioned specially is Aame. He co-starred in this movie with Ooha, who is to be his wife in future. The first notable hit came to him in 1995 with TajMahal. With the box office hit Pelli Sandadi that released in 1996, Srikanth became known to one and all and did not have to look back again.\n\nIn coming years, Srikanth and Ooha married and now they have a son, Roshan and daughter, Medha. His career also took off, except for the occasional flops which no hero can really escape from. Over the years, Srikanth did not constrain himself to a particular image or particular genre of roles. He has proved that he can handle comedy roles as well as serious roles with equal ease.\n\nFilmography\n\nShankardada Zindabad (2007)\n\nOperation Duryodhana (2007)\n\nEvandoi Srivaru (2006)\n\nSoggadu (2005)\n\nRadha Gopalam (2005)\n\nSankranthi (2005)\n\nSwarabhishekam (2004)\n\nShankar Dada MBBS (2004)\n\nBose (2004)\n\nDonga Ramudu & Party (2003)\n\nPellam Oorelithe (2003)\n\nKhadgam (2002)\n\nTappu Chesi Pappu Koodu (2002)\n\nDevullu (2001)\n\nMaa Nannaki Pelli (1997)\n\nPelli Sandadi (1996)\n\nGhatotkachudu (1995)\n\nTaj Mahal (1995)\n\nAaghata (1994)\n\nAame (1994)\n\nSobhanbabu, one of the senior Telugu film artistes, quietly disappeared from the Telugu film industry. Though some of his contemporaries are still making their presence in films, Sobhanbabu voluntarily opted to stay away from the film industry. Not only in films, he is keeping himself off from any functions or festivals related to the film industry like audio releases, film releases or Nandi award kind of prestigious dos.\n\nSobhanbabu's real name is Uppu Shobana Chalapathy Rao. His date of birth is January 14, 1937. He is the son of Uppu Suryanarayana Rao. He has three sisters Dhanaranga, Jhansi and Nirmala, besides a brother Sambasiva Rao.\n\nHe had completed his schooling in Kuntamukkula Mylavaram. He pursued his Intermediate in Vijayawada and finished his degree in Vijayawada. Later, he joined law course in Madras, but discontinued it.\n\nHe got married to Kanta Kumari on May 15, 1958. He has a son Karuna Seshu and three daughters Mrudula, Prashanti and Nivedita.\n\nThough he was in the glamour field, he did not allow either his sons, daughters, brothers or sisters into the film industry.\n\nHe made his debut into films through Daivabalam directed by Vasanthkumar Reddy, but the first film that hit the screen is Bhakta Sabari and his first crush is with L Vijayalakshmi. Chitrapu Narayana Murthy is his first director, while BD Naidu was the first producer. It is Pendyala Nageswara Rao who gave music for his first ever film. His film Manushulu Maarali was run for 25 weeks which was a recording during those days. By the time Sobhanbabu entered, it was black and white era. His first colour film is Kannavari Kalalu. For the first time he went abroad for a film shooting for Ramudu-Parasuramudu. He made a dual role in Potti Pleader for the first time.\n\nDuring those days Sobhanbabu is the only stylish star. Even if he wears a T-shirt or if he wears a suit, it is perfect fit for him. It is Sobhanbabu who used to wear goggles in song sequences and it is worth watching on screen. He had received Filmfare Awards for four times, Nandi awards for five times, AP Cine Goers Award for eight times of which he bagged the award consecutively for six years from 1970 to 1975. Likewise he had bagged Madras Film Fans award for nine times. Vamsi Berkely Award, AP Film Fans Award, Andhra Patrika Award, Film World Award were only a few to mention. He bagged the Central Govt award for the best classical film hero for Bangaru Panjaram in 1970. Filmalaya, Cine World, Cine Express, Kalasagar, and Kalasravanthi were few more awards that came in his way.\n\nSobhanbabu had paired up with Sarada for several films and they were said to be a hit pair of all times. It is really a unique combination. Sobhanbabu is known for his glamour and performance for about 30 years in the filmdom and Sarada is known more for her outstanding, performance-oriented roles, especially for sober roles.\n\nHe was popularly called as \"Andhra Andagadu\" meaning, \"Most handsome person in Andhra Pradesh\". He was honored several Nandi Awards by the state of Andhra Pradesh Government. He probably earned maximum number of awards among any Telugu hero for his diverse roles spanning over 30 years. He was the most popular ladies hero for over 20 years. In fact, he earned so much ladies popularity that even to this day any good ladies family entertainer is referred to as \"Shoban Babu type movie\" by the telugu movie lovers.
