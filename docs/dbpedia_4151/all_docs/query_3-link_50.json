The commentaries of the prominent Vaisnava Acharyas such as Sri Ramanuja, Srimat Madhva Muni, and Sri Sridhar Swamipad are most noteable, whilst among the proponents of jnana-marg, or the monistic path, the commentaries of Srimat Sankar Acharya and Sri Madhusudan Saraswati are well-known. The commentaries of Sriyuta Bala Gangadhar Tilak and Sri Aurobindo favour the school of karma-yoga, or the path of action, and are also familiar to modern scholars. Great thinkers of both East and West have ardently sung the glories of Sri Gita, being inspired by the ideals of its teachings.\n\nHowever, the achintya-bhedabheda-siddhanta, theology of inconceivable oneness and difference, as revealed by the proponents of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu—Gaudiya Acharyas Srila Visvanath Chakravarti and Srila Baladev Vidyabhusan—is concluded by the learned devotees to be most favorable to exclusive devotion. The devotees also embrace Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur’s Bengali commentary on Sri Gita as a harmonious, spiritual mine of the treasure of divine love for Sri Krishna (Krishna-prema), the fifth and transcendental goal of life, beyond the four general human objectives of religion, wealth, sense enjoyment, and liberation.\n\nIn his introduction my worshipful Divine Master, Sri Guru Pada-padma Om Visnupad Paramahamsa Parivrajakacharya Sri Srimad Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj, has revealed to the readers glimpses of his own deep devotional realisations. Although numerous editions of Sri Gita are presently available, few commentaries can be said to nurture pure devotion according to the teachings of bona fide divine succession, which has given us the opportunity of service in producing this edition. We shall consider ourselves blessed if the fortunate readers take the all-auspicious essence of this sincere attempt to heart.\n\nSri Bhakti Sundar Govinda\n\nSri Chaitanya Saraswat Math,\n\nNabadwip\n\nAll glory to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga\n\nIntroduction\n\n[of the first bengali edition]\n\nवन्दे श्रीगुरुगौराङ्गौ राधागोविन्दसुन्दरौ ।\n\nसगुणौ गीयते चाथ गीतागूढार्थगौरवम् ॥\n\nvande sri-guru-gaurangau radha-govinda-sundarau\n\nsa-gunau giyate chatha gita-gudhartha-gauravam\n\nBowing down to the holy feet of Sri Guru, Sri Gauranga, and Sri Sri Radha-Govindasundar, all accompanied by Their associates, I sing the glories of the hidden treasure of Srimad Bhagavad-gita.\n\nSince Srimad Bhagavad-gita is very familiar to the learned society, an acquaintance of the conceptions of this edition may be given here. We are followers of the school of thought descending from Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so this edition is based on the Sri Gita commentaries of the pre-eminent, exalted Sri Gaudiya Vaisnava Acharyas—Sri Visvanath, Sri Baladev, and Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur.\n\nBy the grace of our worshipful Spiritual Master, Om Visnupad Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupad, and from indications in the commentaries given by the aforementioned great pure devotees, in places some new light has been shed, revealing deeper meanings. The devoted reader will appreciate this particularly with regard to the four verses (10.8–11) which were described by Sri Visvanathpad as the four essential verses (chatuh-sloki) of the book.\n\nGenerally, Sri Gita is known as an excellent study of the science of religion. The language of Sri Gita is simple and sweet; its mood is grave, extensive, and radical; its thought is succinct, lucid, and impartial; and its logic is sound and natural. The eloquence of the prologue, epilogue, exposition, review, analysis, synthesis, and delivery of Sri Gita is unprecedented and charming in the extreme. Sri Gita is activation for the lazy, courage for the fearful, hope for the hopeless, and new life for the dying. Sri Gita unifies and sustains all ranks, whether revolutionary, occultist, optimist, renunciationist, liberationist, or full-fledged theist. From the atheist of grossly crude vision to the most elevated saint, the essential conceptions of all classes of philosophers are illustrated with clear and powerful logic. The devotees of the Lord (bhagavad-bhaktas) and persons on the paths of action, knowledge, and yoga (karmis, jnanis, and yogis) will each find the essence of their paths dealt with in a comprehensive and illuminating manner, and thus the book is highly esteemed by all.\n\nThe essential and inner purport of the Vedas and Upanisads of the Aryans is directly explained, and the essence of various non-Aryan doctrines can also be found. Sri Gita teaches us enlightenment through the selfless execution of scripturally ordained actions. When the consciousness is thus purified, self-realisation or spiritual realisation is attained. In its maturity, this pure realisation blossoms into loving service in the joyful, divine plane.\n\nFrom the standpoint of sambandha-jnan or ‘knowledge of relationship’, Sri Gita gives us the conception that the Absolute Reality is a transcendental personality; from the standpoint of prayojan or ‘the objective’, spiritual love for the Absolute Reality is given as the highest attainment; and from the standpoint of abhidheya or ‘the means’, we are taught that one must initially offer all his actions to the Supreme Lord, followed by the cultivation of self-realisation favourable to realisation of the Lord, and finally surrender to the Lord, to the exclusion of all other endeavours. Ultimately, the means will culminate in the objective when, in one’s perfected spiritual form, one whole-heartedly engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.\n\nSri Gita has clearly shown the distinctions between the various paths, such as the path of action, including worship of the gods for worldly fulfillment, and the path of knowledge, for the attainment of liberation. The thoughtful reader can note that Sri Gita, by its comparative study, refutes the misconception that the many paths and goals are ‘all one’. Rather, it is stated, “Yo yach chhradhah sa eva sah: a man is known by his faith.”\n\nThese verses would warrant deep consideration in this respect:\n\n“The yogi is superior to persons engaged in austerities, superior to the person of knowledge, and superior to the person of action. Therefore, O Arjuna, be a yogi. And best of all yogis is My faithful devotee for whom I am the only goal, and who serves Me whole-heartedly. This is My opinion.” (6.46–47)\n\nShowing the inferiority and meaninglessness of dry renunciation, the gift of Sri Gita is most substantial and positive. Rather then merely renouncing action, one should selflessly offer one’s actions to the Supreme Lord (karma-yoga). Ultimately, based on one’s surrender, one will be inspired to act in devotion (bhakti) for the Lord alone. This is the conclusive and sublime teaching of Sri Gita. In the finest conception, the overall excellence of Sri Gita is found in its gift of devotion. In its full manifestation, such devotion is prema-bhakti, loving devotion to the all-attractive Supreme Personality—Sri Krishna, Reality the Beautiful.\n\nSecret, more secret, and the most secret of all teachings have been given, as the congregational chanting of the Holy Names of the Lord (sankirtan), and service in spontaneity (bhava-seva), with exclusive surrender and dedication to the transcendental pleasure of Krishna as the ultimate goal of life, as sung by the vibrant clarion call of Sri Gita—sarva-dharman parityajya Mam ekam saranam vraja—and as deeply contemplated by the followers of the lotus footsteps of the Supreme Lord who mercifully appears as the saviour in this Age of Kali—Sri Chaitanyachandra, and as corroborated by the divine succession of saintly teachers.\n\nMay Lord Sri Krishna accept the offering of this edition.\n\nSwami B.

Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable.\n\nअव्यक्तादीनि भूतानि व्यक्तमध्यानि भारत ।\n\nअव्यक्तनिधनान्येव तत्र का परिदेवना ॥२८॥\n\navyaktadini bhutani vyakta-madhyani bharata\n\navyakta-nidhanany eva tatra ka paridevana [28]\n\n(he) bharata–O Arjuna; bhutani–of the living beings; avyaktadini–the situation before birth is unknown; vyakta-madhyani–the period between birth and death is known; avyakta-nidhanany eva–and the situation after death is again unknown; ka paridevana–so what cause is there for grief; tatra–in that matter?\n\n28 O Bharat, when all living beings are unmanifest before birth, manifest between birth and death, and again unmanifest at death, why lament for them?\n\nआश्चर्य्यवत्पश्यति कश्चिदेनम्\n\nआश्चर्य्यवद्वदति तथैव चान्यः ।\n\nआश्चर्य्यवच्चैनमन्यः शृणोति\n\nश्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित् ॥२९॥\n\nascharyavat pasyati kaschid enam\n\nascharyavad vadati tathaiva chanyah\n\nascharyavach chainam anyah srnoti\n\nsrutvapy enam veda na chaiva kaschit [29]\n\nkaschit–Some persons; pasyati–see; enam–the soul; ascharyavat–as astonishing. tatha eva–Similarly; anyah cha–others, too; vadati–describe; (enam)–the soul; ascharyavat–as astonishing; anyah cha–and others; srnoti–hear; enam–of the soul; ascharyavat–as astonishing; kaschit cha eva–and some; srutva api–though hearing about it; na veda–do not know; enam–the soul.

[32]\n\n32 O Partha, only the most fortunate warriors are blessed with the opportunity of such a battle, which has come to you like an open door to heaven.\n\nCommentary\n\nOne’s natural duty or ‘svadharma’ is of two types—relative or absolute—according to the soul’s state of either material bondage or liberation respectively. In the liberated state, the natural function of the soul is purely spiritual devotional service, for the transcendental pleasure of the Supreme Lord alone. But in the state of material bondage, a person’s natural duty possesses mundane attributes. The conditioned soul accepts various births throughout the 8,400,000 species of life according to his actions, until by the influence of piety he obtains a human birth. Then, according to his nature, he may adopt a position and prescribed duty in the God-centred socio-religious system (Daiva-varnasram), which helps one attain the natural duty of the liberated state.\n\nIn this respect, the natural duty of the liberated soul is somewhat covered by the relativity of the material world; yet, within the God-centred socio-religious system, it is nonetheless considered a person’s natural duty, as, for example, smoke-covered fire is still considered fire, despite its covering.\n\nअथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्म्यं सङ्ग्रामं न करिष्यसि ।\n\nततः स्वधर्म्मं कीर्त्तिञ्च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि ॥३३॥\n\natha chet tvam imam dharmyam sangramam na karisyasi\n\ntatah svadharmam kirtin cha hitva papam avapsyasi [33]\n\natha–Otherwise; chet–if; tvam–you; na karisyasi–do not engage; imam dharmyam sangramam–in this battle for justice; tatah–then; hitva–leaving; svadharmam kirtim cha–the ksatriya’s duty and glory; avapsyasi–you will incur; papam–sin.

Now hear from Me how to act in this knowledge (bhakti-yoga), through which you will be able to free yourself from the bondage of action.\n\nCommentary\n\n“It will be revealed that buddhi-yoga (yoga of wisdom) is a singular path. When buddhi-yoga is seen to be limited by the ideal of action, it is known as karma-yoga; when it extends beyond action up to the peak of knowledge, it is known as jnana-yoga or sankhya-yoga; and when, transcending the limitations of both action and knowledge it touches bhakti or devotion, it is then known as bhakti-yoga, or perfectly pure and complete buddhi-yoga.”\n\n—Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur\n\nनेहाभिक्रमनाशोऽस्ति प्रत्यवायो न विद्यते ।\n\nस्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्म्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् ॥४०॥\n\nnehabhikrama-naso ’sti pratyavayo na vidyate\n\nsvalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat [40]\n\niha–In this (bhakti-) yoga; na asti–there is no; abhikrama-nasah–failure in the beginning; na vidyate–and there is no; pratyavayah–diminution of results. svalpam api–Even the slightest practice; asya dharmasya–of this bhakti-yoga; trayate–saves one; mahatah bhayat–from the great fear of birth and death in the material world. [40]\n\n40 On this path there can be no loss and no harm. The slightest practice of such a spiritual ideal saves one from the greatest fear.\n\nCommentary\n\nMahabhay, the greatest fear, is generally considered to be the fear of repeated birth and death in this world. But mahabhay also refers to sayujya-mukti, the liberation of merging into the impersonal non-differentiated consciousness of Brahmaloka, Viraja, or a kind of impersonal samadhi. Renunciation alone leads to sayujya-mukti, the cessation of birth and death, but not to a life in the positive plane. It takes one to a permanent ‘burial’ in Brahmaloka. The demon of mukti will devour one wholesale, and therefore it is even more dangerous than this ordinary life of action and reaction. Mukti means a strike in the organic system, so it must be avoided. For example, to either ignore duties in a factory or to declare a strike by cessation of duties are both abnormal.\n\nBhukti, exploitation, and mukti, renunciation, are both fearsome ghosts. Therefore, here, mahabhay means the great apprehension of falling prey to both the ghost of exploitation leading to birth and death, as well as the ghost of committing suicide by merging into the impersonalism of incarceration in Brahmaloka—fear of both bhoga-bhumi, the land of exploitation, and tyaga-bhumi, the plane of renunciation. It is stated in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.22, 1.1.9):\n\nभुक्तिमुक्तिस्पृहा यावत् पिशाची हृदि वर्त्तते ।\n\nतावद्भक्तिसुखस्यात्र कथमभ्युदयो भवेत् ॥\n\nbhukti-mukti-sprha yavat pisachi hrdi vartate\n\ntavad bhakti-sukhasyatra katham abhyudayo bhavet\n\n“The ecstasy of devotion to Krishna will never appear in a heart that is haunted by the ghosts of exploitation and renunciation.”\n\nअन्याभिलाषिता शून्यं ज्ञानकर्म्माद्यनावृतम् ।\n\nआनुकूल्येन कृष्णनुशीलनं भक्तरुत्तमा ॥\n\nanyabhilasita sunyam jnana-karmady anavrtam\n\nanukulyena krsnanusilanam bhaktir uttama\n\n“The highest devotion is that which is cultivated for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna, with no desire except to serve Him, and divested of all external attempts such as worldly action, knowledge in search of the impersonal Absolute, or the meditational attempt to become one with God.”\n\nOnly the Supreme Lord is abhay, beyond apprehension. Therefore nothing but participation in His service can free one from the ghosts of exploitation and renunciation, bhukti and mukti. If we subtract bhukti and mukti, then only positive bhakti, devotion, is the remainder. Therefore, without devotion, everything is mahabhay, great danger.\n\nव्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन ।\n\nबहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् ॥४१॥\n\nvyavasayatmika buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana\n\nbahu-sakha hy anantas cha buddhayo ’vyavasayinam [41]\n\n(he) kuru-nandana–O Arjuna, descendant of the Kuru dynasty; vyavasaya-atmika buddhih–the resolute intelligence; iha–to practise this (bhakti-) yoga; eka (eva)–is onepointed; (tu)–but; buddhayah–the intelligence; avyavasayinam–of the irresolute—those who nurture mundane desires; hi–is certainly; anantah–endlessly; bahu-sakhah cha–many-branched, splayed. [41]\n\n41 O descendant of the Kuru dynasty, resolute intelligence dedicated to Me is one-pointed—I am its only objective. But irresolute intelligence is splayed by endless desires for mundane enjoyment.\n\nयामिमां पुष्पितां वाच प्रवदन्त्यविपश्चितः ।\n\nवेदवादरताः पार्थ नान्यदस्तीति वादिनः ॥४२॥\n\nyam imam puspitam vacham pravadanty avipaschitah\n\nveda-vada-ratah partha nanyad astiti vadinah [42]\n\n(he) partha–O Arjuna; avipaschitah–the unwise; veda-vada-ratah–who are fond of interpreting the Vedas, not knowing the true directive of the Vedas; vadinah iti–say that; na asti–there is no; anyat–other (divine or controlling) principle beyond beasts, food, offspring, heaven, etc.; pravadanti–and they glorify as supreme; yam imam vacham–those statements which; puspitam–momentarily please the ear (which, thus taken out of context, are effectively poisonous as they do not help the spiritual progress of the soul). [42]\n\n42 O Partha, unwise persons, not knowing that the chief directive of the Vedas is the attainment of the Supreme Truth, are fond of interpreting the fleetingly enchanting words of the karma-kanda section of the Vedas as ultimate.\n\nकामात्मानः स्वर्गपराः जन्मकर्म्मफलप्रदाम् ।\n\nक्रियाविशेषबहुलां भोगैश्वर्य्यगतिं प्रति ॥४३॥\n\nkamatmanah svarga-parah janma-karma-phala-pradam\n\nkriya-visesa-bahulam bhogaisvarya-gatim prati [43]\n\nkama-atmanah–Their hearts filled with selfish desires; svarga-parah–heaven is their goal; kriya-visesa-bahulam–and they advocate the various ceremonies and rituals; janmakarma-phala-pradam–which yield high birth; bhoga-aisvarya-gatim prati–and lead to enjoyment and opulence. [43]\n\n43 Their hearts are filled with desires and their goal is heaven. They advocate the many sacrifices and rituals that yield wealth, worldly pleasures, and high birth.\n\nभोगैश्वर्य्यप्रसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम् ।\n\nव्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ न विधीयते ॥४४॥\n\nbhogaisvarya-prasaktanam tayapahrta-chetasam\n\nvyavasayatmika buddhih samadhau na vidhiyate [44]\n\nbhoga-aisvarya-prasaktanam–Of those persons attached to enjoyment and opulence; apahrta-chetasam–whose minds are deluded; taya–by those flowery words of the Vedas; vyavasaya-atmika buddhih–the resolve; samadhau–in dedication to the Supreme Lord; na vidhiyate–is not accomplished. [44]\n\n44 Thus attached to enjoyment and opulence, deluded by these flowery words of the Vedas, they do not attain the resolve to dedicate themselves to the Supreme Lord.\n\nत्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्ज्जुन ।\n\nनिर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान् ॥४५॥\n\ntraigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna\n\nnirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho niryoga-ksema atmavan [45]\n\n(he) arjuna–O Arjuna; vedah–the Vedas; trai-gunya-visayah–deal with the modes of material nature—worldly subjects. nirdvandvah–Give up duality (honour and dishonour, etc., in the purview of these modes); nitya-sattva-sthah–be always situated in the truth (or remain with the true devotees); niryoga-ksemah–free from acquisition and preservation; (cha)–and; atmavan (san)–engaging in this buddhi-yoga, yoga of wisdom that I teach you; bhava–become; nistraigunyah–transcendental to the three modes of material nature. [45]\n\n45 O Arjuna, the Vedas deal with the three modes of material nature (by accommodating fruitive action and liberation as an allowance and incentive for persons who are ignorant of the true objective of the Vedas). But you, Arjuna, give up duality and all pursuits for gain and preservation, stand ever in the plane of truth, and by the yoga of wisdom, transcend the modes of nature.\n\n(The objective of the Vedas is transcendental. Without fruitive action or liberation, O Arjuna, follow the transcendental path of devotion to the Lord as taught by the Vedas.)\n\nयावानर्थ उदपाने सर्व्वतः सम्प्लुतोदके ।\n\nतावान्सर्व्वेषु वेदेषु ब्राह्मणस्य विजानतः ॥४६॥\n\nyavan artha udapane sarvatah samplutodake\n\ntavan sarvesu vedesu brahmanasya vijanatah [46]\n\nyavan arthah–Of various purposes; (sidhyati)–achieved; udapane–by a well or pond; tavan (eva arthah)–all the purposes; sarvatah–of all these wells; (sidhyati)–are achieved; (tato ’pi vaisistyena)–better than that; sampluta-udake–by a large expanse of water, a lake.

[56]\n\n56 One who is undisturbed by sorrow, whose hankering for pleasure has gone, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is known as a silent sage of steady mind.\n\nयः सर्व्वत्रानभिस्नेहस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम् ।\n\nनाभिनन्दति न द्वेष्टि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥५७॥\n\nyah sarvatranabhisnehas tat tat prapya subhasubham\n\nnabhinandati na dvesti tasya prajna pratisthita [57]\n\nyah–One who; anabhisnehah–is without attachment; sarvatra–for anything in this world; na abhinandati–neither joyful; na dvesti–nor resentful; prapya–in the event of; subha-asubham–auspiciousness or inauspiciousness; tat tat–respectively; tasya–his; prajna–wisdom; pratisthita–is firmly established.

[58]\n\n58 When one’s senses are controlled and totally withdrawn from their objects, like the limbs of the tortoise withdrawn in its shell, his wisdom is firmly established.\n\nविषया विनिवर्त्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः ।\n\nरसवर्ज्जं रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्त्तते ॥५९॥\n\nvisaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinah\n\nrasa-varjam raso ’py asya param drstva nivartate [59]\n\ndehinah–For the embodied; niraharasya–who restricts the senses; visayah–the objects of the senses; vinivartante–recede; rasa-varjam–but not the taste to enjoy them. rasah api–But even the taste; nivartate–disappears; asya–for the man of wisdom; drstva–by the vision; param–of the Supreme. [59]\n\n59 The embodied being may renounce the sense objects, but the taste for them remains. But that, too, vanishes for the man of wisdom, by his vision of the Supreme.\n\nयततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः ।\n\nइन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः ॥६०॥\n\nyatato hy api kaunteya purusasya vipaschitah\n\nindriyani pramathini haranti prasabham manah [60]\n\n(he) kaunteya–O Arjuna; hi–yet; indriyani pramathini–the turbulent senses; prasabham–forcibly; haranti–snatch away; manah–the mind; vipaschitah purusasya api–of even the wise person; yatatah–striving for liberation. [60]\n\n60 And yet, O son of Kunti, the turbulent senses can forcibly plunder the mind of even the wise person striving for liberation.\n\nतानि सर्व्वाणि संयम्य युक्त आसीत मत्परः ।\n\nवशे हि यस्येन्द्रियाणि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥६१॥\n\ntani sarvani samyamya yukta asita mat-parah\n\nvase hi yasyendriyani tasya prajna pratisthita [61]\n\nsamyamya–Controlling; tani sarvani–all these senses; mat-parah–the person absorbed in consciousness of Me, devoted to Me; yuktah asita–should remain one-pointed in concentration; hi–for; yasya–he whose; indriyani–senses; vase–have been brought under control; tasya–his; prajna–intelligence; pratisthita–is steady. [61]\n\n61 Devoted to Me, the bhakti-yogi brings his senses under proper control. Firmly established is the wisdom of one whose senses are controlled.\n\nध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः सङ्गस्तेषूपजायते ।\n\nसङ्गात्सञ्जायते कामः कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते ॥६२॥\n\ndhyayato visayan pumsah sangas tesupajayate\n\nsangat sanjayate kamah kamat krodho ’bhijayate [62]\n\ndhyayatah–(Otherwise, without devotion, renunciation alone fails:) By thinking of; visayan–the objects of the senses; pumsah–a person’s; sangah–attachment; tesu–to them; upajayate–is born. sangat–From attachment; kamah–desire; sanjayate–is born. kamat–From desire; krodhah–anger; abhijayate–arises. [62]\n\n62 But one whose thoughts dwell on the objects of the senses becomes attached to them. From attachment, desire is born, and from desire, anger arises.\n\nक्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहः सम्मोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रमः ।\n\nस्मृतिभ्रंशाद्बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति ॥६३॥\n\nkrodhad bhavati sammohah sammohat smrti-vibhramah\n\nsmrti-bhramsad buddhi-naso buddhi-nasat pranasyati [63]\n\nkrodhat–From anger; sammohah–delusion; bhavati–occurs. sammohat–From delusion; smrti-vibhramah–forgetfulness of scriptural morality; (bhavati)–occurs. smrti-bhram sat–From forgetfulness; buddhi-nasah–loss of truth-seeking intelligence; (bhavati)–occurs. buddhi-nasat–From loss of intelligence; (puman)–a person; pranasyati–falls into samsara, the cycle of birth and death in the material world. [63]\n\n63 Anger gives rise to delusion, and the power of delusion causes forgetfulness; forgetfulness destroys the intelligence, and when the intelligence is lost, one loses all.\n\nरागद्वेषविमुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन् ।\n\nआत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति ॥६४॥\n\nraga-dvesa-vimuktais tu visayan indriyais charan\n\natma-vasyair vidheyatma prasadam adhigachchhati [64]\n\ntu–But; vidheya-atma–the person who can control his mind at will—whose mind is obedient to him; raga-dvesa-vimuktaih (or -viyuktaih in another reading)–free from attraction and repulsion, adopting yukta-vairagya or devotionally integrated detachment; charan–actively accepting; visayan–objects; atma-vasyaih indriyaih–through senses under his own control; adhigachchhati–attains; prasadam–tranquillity. [64]\n\n64 But the integrated person who can control his mind at will, and who, free from attraction and repulsion, accepts his worldly necessities through his controlled senses, attains tranquillity.\n\nप्रसादे सर्व्वदुःखानां हानिरस्योपजायते ।\n\nप्रसन्नचेतसो ह्यशु बुद्धिः पर्य्यवतिष्ठते ॥६५॥\n\nprasade sarva-duhkhanam hanir asyopajayate\n\nprasanna-chetaso hy asu buddhih paryavatisthate [65]\n\nprasade (sati)–When the heart is tranquil; asya–for such a person; hanih–the end; sarva-duhkhanam–of all sorrows; upajayate–occurs; hi–since; buddhih–the wisdom; prasanna-chetasah–of the peaceful-hearted person; asu–swiftly becomes; pari-avatisthate–steadfast. [65]\n\n65 When one attains a peaceful heart, all his sorrows are dispelled. The tranquil person’s wisdom swiftly becomes steadfast.\n\nनास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना ।\n\nन चाभावयतः शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुतः सुखम् ॥६६॥\n\nnasti buddhir ayuktasya na chayuktasya bhavana\n\nna chabhavayatah santir asantasya kutah sukham [66]\n\nayuktasya–For a person without self-control; na asti–there is no; buddhih–wisdom, self-knowledge. ayuktasya–For such a person devoid of this intelligence; na cha (asti)–there is no; bhavana–meditation on the Lord, purity of thought. abhavayatah–For one without meditation; na cha (asti)–there is no; santih–peace. asantasya–For a person who has no peace; kutah–where is; sukham–happiness? [66]\n\n66 A person bereft of self-control can have neither wisdom nor meditation. Without meditation there is no peace, and without peace, where is the hope for happiness?\n\nइन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते ।\n\nतदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि ॥६७॥\n\nindriyanam hi charatam yan mano ’nuvidhiyate\n\ntad asya harati prajnam vayur navam ivambhasi [67]\n\nhi–Because; iva–as; vayuh–an unfavourable wind; (harati)–carries away; navam–a boat; ambhasi–on the ocean; (tadvat)–similarly; indriyanam–of the senses; charatam–that wander about their objects; yat–whichever sense; manah–the mind; anuvidhiyate–follows; tat–that sense; harati–carries away, lures towards its object; prajnam–the wisdom, intelligence; asya–of that person bereft of self-control. [67]\n\n67 As a boat on the ocean is thrown off course by an unfavourable wind, similarly, the wisdom of a person lacking self-control is carried away by even one of the roaming senses that the mind might follow.\n\nतस्माद्यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्व्वशः ।\n\nइन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥६८॥\n\ntasmad yasya maha-baho nigrhitani sarvasah\n\nindriyanindriyarthebhyas tasya prajna pratisthita [68]\n\n(he) maha-baho–O subduer of the enemy; tasmat–therefore; yasya–he whose; indriyani–senses; nigrhitani–are withdrawn; sarvasah–fully; indriya-arthebhyah–from the sense objects; tasya–his; prajna–wisdom; pratisthita–is firmly established. [68]\n\n68 Therefore, O subduer of the enemy, one whose senses are fully withdrawn from their objects is a person of firmly established wisdom.\n\nया निशा सर्व्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्त्ति संयमी ।\n\nयस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः ॥६९॥\n\nya nisa sarva-bhutanam tasyam jagarti samyami\n\nyasyam jagrati bhutani sa nisa pasyato muneh [69]\n\nsarva-bhutanam ya nisa–That which is night for all living beings (who, immersed in ignorance, remain asleep to spiritual knowledge); tasyam–in that night; samyami–the self-disciplined person; jagarti–remains awake (joyful in his spiritual intelligence). yasyam–That (mundane intelligence) in which; bhutani–all living beings; jagrati–remain awake (experience the pleasures and pains, sorrows and delusions of worldly life); sa–such (mundane intelligence) is; nisa–night; muneh–for the sage; pasyatah–who sees (the futility of mundane endeavours and remains indifferent to the dualities). [69]\n\n69 That which is day for the self-controlled sage is night for all beings, and that which is day for all beings is night for the sage who sees. (The living beings absorbed in mundane life are asleep to the spiritual joy of the realised soul, who remains indifferent to their quest for the pleasures of the senses, devoid of spiritual joy.)\n\nआपूर्य्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं\n\nसमुद्रमापः प्रविशन्ति यद्वत् ।\n\nतद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्व्वे\n\nस शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी ॥७०॥\n\napuryamanam achala-pratistham\n\nsamudram apah pravisanti yadvat\n\ntadvat kama yam pravisanti sarve\n\nsa santim apnoti na kama-kami [70]\n\nyadvat–As; apah–water; pravisanti–enters; samudram–the ocean; apuryamanam–which is always full; achala-pratistham–it remains steady, its water never crossing the shore; tadvat–similar is; yam–that sage who; sarve kamah–all desires; pravisanti–enter to be enjoyed (for they cannot disturb his mind). sah–He alone; apnoti–attains; santim–peace; (tu)–but; kama-kami–a person who nurtures desires; na (tad apnoti)–cannot achieve that. [70]\n\n70 As the ocean remains full and unchanged though many rivers and streams enter into it, the person of firmly established wisdom attains peace despite all desires entering him. But a person who nurtures desires cannot know peace.\n\nविहाय कामान्यः सर्व्वान्पुमांश्चरति निःस्पृहः ।\n\nनिर्म्ममो निरहङ्कारः स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥७१॥\n\nvihaya kaman yah sarvan pumams charati nihsprhah\n\nnirmamo nirahankarah sa santim adhigachchhati [71]\n\nyah puman–That person who; vihaya–giving up; sarvan kaman–all desires; charati–moves through the world; nisprhah–free from hankering; nirahankarah nirmamah–free from the false ego of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ in relation to the body and its attachments (having a divine relationship with the Supreme); sah–he; adhigachchhati–attains; santim–peace. [71]\n\n71 Only a person who lives his life abandoning all desires, hankering, ego and possessiveness, can know real peace.\n\nएषा ब्राह्मी स्थितिः पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति ।\n\nस्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्व्वाणमृच्छति ॥७२॥\n\nesa brahmi sthitih partha nainam prapya vimuhyati\n\nsthitvasyam anta-kale ’pi brahma-nirvanam rchchhati [72]\n\n(he) partha–O Arjuna; esa brahmi sthitih–this is the state of realising Brahma, the Absolute. enam prapya–Having reached this; (narah)–a person; na vimuhyati–is freed from the delusion of mundane existence. rchchhati–He attains; brahma-nirvanam–liberation from matter and entrance into the divine plane; sthitva–being situated; asyam–in this state; anta-kale api–even at the time of death. [72]\n\n72 O Partha, this is realisation of the Absolute, attaining which a person is freed from the delusion of mundane existence. Even at the time of death, only a momentary attainment of this state leads one to the divine abode.\n\nइति श्रीमहाभारते शतसाहस्र्यां संहितायां वैयासिक्या भीष्मपर्व्वणि\n\nश्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूपनिषत्सु ब्रह्मविद्यायां योगशास्त्रे\n\nश्रीकृष्णार्ज्जुनसंवादे साङ्ख्य योगो नाम द्वितोयोऽध्यायः ॥२॥\n\niti sri-mahabharate sata-sahasryam samhitayam vaiyasikyam\n\nbhisma-parvani srimad-bhagavad-gitasupanisatsu brahma-\n\nvidyayam yoga-sastre sri-krsnarjuna-samvade\n\nsankhya-yogo nama dvitiyo ’dhyayah [2]\n\nEnd of Chapter Two\n\nThe Contitution Of The Soul\n\nfrom the conversation\n\nof Sri Krishna and Arjuna\n\nin Srimad Bhagavad-gita Upanisad\n\nthe yoga scripture of transcendental knowledge\n\nin Bhisma Parva of Sri Mahabharata, the holy scripture\n\nrevealed by Srila Vyasadev in a hundred thousand verses.\n\nतृतीयोऽध्यायः\n\nChapter Three\n\nKarma-yoga: The Path of Action\n\nअर्ज्जुन उवाच ।\n\nज्यायसी चेत्कर्म्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्द्दन ।\n\nतत्किं कर्म्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव ॥१॥\n\narjuna uvacha\n\njyayasi chet karmanas te mata buddhir janardana\n\ntat kim karmani ghore mam niyojayasi kesava [1]\n\narjunah uvacha–Arjuna said: (he) janardana–O Janardan; (he) kesava–O Kesava; chet–if; te mata–it is Your opinion that; buddhih–wisdom; jyayasi–is superior; karmanah–to action; tat kim–why, then; niyojayasi mam–do You urge me to engage; ghore karmani–in the terrible action of warfare?
