        "text": "Monthly Newsletter\n\nLoving Sairams dear fellow devotees in this spiritual journey.\n\nBy the Divine grace of Lord Sai and all your support and encouragement Sai Times completes 6 years and is now moving into the 7th year.\n\nThis is our humble effort to spread Lord Sai’s messages and glory through value-based stories, experiences and Seva activities.\n\nHope you find this meaningful in your spiritual path. Looking forward to your continued support.\n\nShirdi Sai Gayatri\n\nOM Shirdi Vasaya Vidamahe Sachidanandaya\n\nDhimahi tanno Sai Prachodayath\n\nOm, Let me meditate on the God who lives in Shirdi,\n\nOh, God who is the ethereal truth and happiness, give me higher intellect,\n\nAnd let that Sai illuminate my mind\n\nSai Leela\n\nFor next few months we will be sharing the experiences of the blessed devotees of Baba who were fortunate to be with Him physically when He was in Shirdi.\n\nDevotee for this month- Bhagoji Shinde\n\nBhagoji was a sort of attendant (personal companion) to Baba, engaged in regular service to him. He was the first to enter the mosque in the early morning, and every day he used to massage first Baba’s right arm and then his body. Then he would light a chillim and the two of them would share it. Bhagoji also had the privilege of carrying the umbrella for Baba when he went to Lendi.\n\nWhen Bhagoji came in contact with Baba he had black leprosy so outwardly he looked, miserable and unfortunate. He was indeed very fortunate to do seva and be with Baba constantly.\n\nOnce when Baba thrust his hand into the dhuni (the sacred fire) and was badly burnt (thus saving the life of a devotees’ baby), Bhagoji was allowed to clean and dress the wound with a bandage. Even though Baba lived for a further eight years after the incident, Bhagoji would daily continue the ritual of bandaging Baba’s arm long after it had healed.\n\nHis elder brother Raguji says, “Once Bhagoji was suffering from high fever and he was at deaths door and Baba came to our home. He branded Bhagoji with a hot iron rod on his back and temples and he recovered soon after” It is said that once Baba asked Bhagoji to ask for a boon, of being cured of his Leprosy, however Bhagoji said, “Baba I am not concerned about my physical appearance, or my disease. But I would like you to me this wish, which is that I be allowed to be with you at all times and that I be allowed to come to the Dwarka Mai whenever I wish” and Baba granted him the wish.\n\nThus Bhagoji was the first person to enter the Dwarka Mai early in the morning when Baba sat in front of the Dhuni, and massage Baba’s burnt hand. After doing his seva he would prepare Baba’s chillum for Him and they would smoke it together. And only after Bhagoji left would the other devotees be allowed to come up. This seva he did without fail every day till 1918.\n\nBhagoji had the good fortune of holding the ornamental umbrella for Baba when Baba went to Lendi Baugh. Thus Baba immortalized him because he is seen in the photograph behind Baba holding the umbrella. And when the devotee sees that photo years later they will remember him.\n\nThere are many lesson to be learnt from the life of this remarkable devotee. Bhagoji had transcended body consciousness. He was the least concerned about how he looked he had lost most of the fingers of his hand, and also a part of his nose, and the nose is a prominent feature of the face. Although his body oozed pus and blood, that was fowl smelling he was not unconcerned about the sneers and disgusted looks that the others gave him, nor did the unkind words of people have an effect on him. This is the state of complete “Stitha Pragjna” (equanimity).\n\nHe was determined to do seva for his Sadguru come what may and he persevered. Never once did he fail to come to massage Baba’s burnt hand regardless of the bitter cold or torrential rain. This is “Druda Buddhi”. In the Nava Vidha Bhakti, Bhagoji is an apt example of “Daasya” or all kinds of seva to the Sadguru. Bhagoji had surrendered totally at his Sadguru’s feet and thus he was able to soak up Baba’s divine energy by being in His Divine presence, and also being able to touch Him and Baba transferred His divine energy to Bhagoji Shinde’s very soul.\n\nCourtesy: Sai Amritdhara- Mahabkhatas of Sai\n\nSathya Sai Gayatri\n\nOm Saieshwaraya Vidmahe\n\nSathya Devaya Dheemahi\n\nThanna Sarvah Prachodayath\n\nWe know Sri Sathya Sai as Supreme Divinity Incarnate\n\nWe meditate on this God of Truth\n\nMay Almighty God lead us to Liberation\n\nSwami’s Janmashtami message\n\nArjuna and gopikas are supreme examples of devotees who knew the secret of surrender. Their love and devotion was not tainted by any selfishness.\n\nSwami says, “For those who bargain and crave for profit, reverence is equated with the returns; they sell homage at so much per unit of satisfactory response. They are like paid servants, clamouring for wages, overtime allowance, bonus, etc. They calculate how much they are able to extract for the service rendered. Be, on the other hand, a member of the family, a kinsman, a friend. Feel that you are the Lord’s own. Then, the work will not tire; it will be done much better; it will yield more satisfaction; and, the wages? The master will maintain you in bliss.\n\nWhat more can any one aspire for? Leave the rest to Him; He knows best; He is All; the joy of having Him is enough reward. This is the secret of human happiness. Live out your lives on these lines and you will never come to grief. Na me bhakthaah pranashyathi, says Krishna―My devotees never suffer sorrow.”\n\nStory Time\n\nDraupadi’s Devotion to Lord Krishna- Power of Namasmarana\n\nValue: Love\n\nSub-Value: Devotion\n\nLord Krishna saved Draupadi, the consort of the Pandavas, from ignominy and disgrace on many occasions. Satyabhama and Rukmani, Lord Krishna’s consorts often wondered why Lord helped and bestowed so much grace on Draupadi.\n\nIn order to clear their doubts, one day Krishna asked Satyabhama and Rukmani to accompany Him to Droupadi’s place.\n\nWhen they reached there, Draupadi had just finished her bath and was brushing her hair. Krishna instructed them, Satyabhama and Rukmani to brush Draupadi’s hair. Though indignant, Satyabhama and Rukmani complied with Krishna’s instruction.\n\nAs they brushed Draupadi’s hair, they were wonder-struck to hear the constant chant of ‘Krishna, Krishna’ emanating from each strand of hair. They realised that Draupadi, rightfully deserved all the Grace, Krishna showered on her.\n\nThe Name of Krishna had permeated every pore of Draupadi’s body. Her yearning, her love, her devotion for Krishna had saturated into the very core of her being. Krishna could not but respond to the whole-hearted devotion of this devotee of His.\n\nDraupadi had achieved the highest stage of securing the constant companionship of the Lord, through the simple sadhana of Namajapa.\n\nhttp://saibaba.ws/teachings/namasmaranasupreme.htm\n\nLearning\n\nChanting the name of the Lord is the best spiritual practice in Kali-yuga. Constant remembrance of the Lord’s name ensures His abundant grace and love.\n\nNamasmarana is the best path to attain Lord.\n\nPodcasts–Sai Prem– Podcast for spreading the human value stories.

Looking forward to your continued support.\n\nShirdi Sai Gayatri\n\nOM Shirdi Vasaya Vidamahe Sachidanandaya\n\nDhimahi tanno Sai Prachodayath\n\nOm, Let me meditate on the God who lives in Shirdi,\n\nOh, God who is the ethereal truth and happiness, give me higher intellect,\n\nAnd let that Sai illuminate my mind\n\nSai Leela\n\nShirdi Sai and Guru Purnima\n\nEfficacy of the Touch of Guru’s Hand\n\nWhere Real or Sadh-Guru is the helmsman, he is sure to carry us safely and easily beyond the worldly ocean.\n\nThe word Sadguru brings to mind Sai Baba. He appears to me, as if standing before me, and applying Udi (scared ashes) to my fore-head and placing his hand of blessing on my head. Then joy fills my heart and love overflows through my eyes. Wonderful is the power of the touch of Guru’s hand.\n\nThe subtle-body (consisting of thoughts and desires), which cannot be burnt by the world dissolving fire, is destroyed by the mere touch of the Guru’s hand, and the sins of many past births are cleaned and washed away. Even the speech of those, whose heads feel annoyed when they hear religious and Godly talks, attains calmness. The seeing of Sai Baba’s handsome form, chokes our throat with joy, makes the eyes overflowing with tears, and overwhelms the heart with emotions. It awakens in us ‘I am He (Brahman)’ consciousness, manifests the joy of self-realization, and dissolving the distinction of I and Thou, then and there, makes us one with the Supreme (One Reality).\n\nWhen I begin to read scriptures, at every step I am reminded of my Sadguru, and Sai Baba, assumes the form of Rama or Krishna and makes me listen to his Life.\n\nFor instance when I sit to listen to Bhagwat, Sai becomes Krishna from top to toe, and I think he sings the Bhagwat or Uddhava Gita (song of teachings by Lord Shri Krishna to His disciple, Uddhava) for the welfare of the devotees. When I begin to chitchat, I am at once put in mind of Sai’s stories for enabling me to give suitable illustrations.\n\nWhen I myself start to write anything, I cannot compose a few words or sentences, but when He of his own accord makes me write, I go on writing and writing and there is no end to it. When the disciple’s egoism props up, He presses it down with His hand, and giving him His own power, makes him gain His object, and thus satisfies and blesses him.\n\nIf any one prostrates before Sai and surrenders heart and soul to Him, then unsolicited, all the chief objects of life viz. Dharma (righteousness), Artha (wealth), Kama (Desire) and Moksha (Deliverance), are easily and unsolicitedly attained. Four paths, viz., of Karma, Jnana, Yoga and Bhakti lead us separately to God. Of these, the path of Bhakti is thorny and full of pits and ditches, and thus difficult to traverse, but if you, relying on your Sadguru, avoid the pits and thorns and walk straight, it will take you to the destination (God). So says definitely, Sai Baba.\n\nSathya Sai Gayatri\n\nOm Saieshwaraya Vidmahe\n\nSathya Devaya Dheemahi\n\nThanna Sarvah Prachodayath\n\nWe know Sri Sathya Sai as Supreme Divinity Incarnate\n\nWe meditate on this God of Truth\n\nMay Almighty God lead us to Liberation\n\nSwami’s Guru Purnima message\n\nSathya Sai Baba declares that the true guru is one who can raise the student to his own level and who has no ego or selfishness. He cautions that there are many in the world today who profess to be gurus and that we must use our discrimination and look for the signs of a true guru— one who is completely selfless, equal-minded and without envy. He teaches that the true guru will lead us to discover that we are our own guru—the God within.\n\nMany unwary spiritual aspirants are attracted by the magic of words and the verbal gymnastics of such showy gurus. The ‘gurus’ may be called pundits and may give lectures; but, just because of this, they do not become entitled to grant the boon of wisdom. That can be done only by Avatars, people who represent Divine attributes and glory, and wise people who have attained the highest good of spiritual discipline and have tasted the supreme bliss, who have realised the Absolute. It is no use claiming a fraction of this or that experience. The experience must be of the full and itself full. Those who know only a fraction will take you up to a certain point and leave you there, in the middle region, like Thrisanku, who was hung between heaven and earth.\n\nGita Vahini, p.45\n\nStory Time\n\nValue: Love\n\nSub-Value: Faith, Devotion\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived many fish in a pond. Everyday, they would wake up in the morning with a dread – the fisherman’s net!\n\nThe fisherman would be there every morning, without fail to cast his net. And without fail every morning, many fish would get caught in it. Some would be taken by surprise, some were caught napping, some would not find any place to hide while some others, even though aware of the lurking danger, would simply find no means to escape the deadly net.\n\nAmong the fish, there was one young fish that was always cheerful. It had no fear of the fisherman’s net and it seemed to have mastered the art of being alive and staying lively.\n\nAll the senior fish wondered as to what might be the secret of this little fish. How could it manage so well when their cumulative experience and wisdom were not enough to save them from the net. Unable to bear their curiosity and desperate to find a way to escape the net, all the fishes went to this little fish one evening.\n\n“Hey little one! We have all come here to talk to you.”\n\n“Me!?” said the little fish, “What do you want to speak to me about?”\n\n“We actually want to ask you something. Tomorrow morning, the fisherman will be back again. Are you not scared of getting caught in his net?”\n\n“The little fish smiled, “No! I will not be caught in his net ever!”\n\n“Share with us little one, the secret behind your confidence and success”, the elders pleaded.\n\n“Very simple”, said the little fish. “When the fisherman comes to cast his net, I rush and stay at his feet. That is one place that the net can never reach, even if the fisherman wants to cast! So, I never get caught.”\n\nAll the fish simply marvelled at the simplicity of the little fish’s wisdom.\n\nLearning\n\nWe must have complete faith in God or our master or teacher. God can be considered as our Master. We must put in our best efforts in whatever we do and leave the rest to Him; hold on to Him. Then, He will take care of us and do what is right for us, and thus, we will be able to handle trial and tribulations better and be saved from many troubles.\n\nPodcasts–Sai Prem– Podcast for spreading the human value stories.

As He always mentions “ I am around you, above you, below you, next to you, within you”,, is absolutely true. We just need the vision to look out for Him both outside and within.\n\nNow to the biscuit leela. Our last day in Kumbakonam was on 8th June. After visiting Tirukadaiyur temple we were to head back to Trichy and then fly to Bangalore that evening. That morning as we were approaching the Amritakadeshwara temple at Tirukadaiyur just a few minutes before the temple to my right side I saw a familiar gopuram.. felt so much like Shirdi and just as we passed that place I realised it was indeed Shirdi Sai Temple and I told my husband we should have a quick darshan on our way back.\n\nThe previous day and also that day morning it was in my mind to buy a biscuit packet for us to have in Bangalore as we were to stay in our house there only for a day and we didn’t have any groceries except some packets of 3 in 1 tea which we had left there on our last visit. So a small biscuit packet would be good to have along with the tea. However we would be reaching Bangalore around 10pm and on the way to Trichy airport there was heavy rains too. So just left the thought at that!!\n\nWe finished the main temple darshan and came to Sai temple for a brief darshan. The temple is very beautiful and as I prayed to the life size statue there; to my utter surprise I saw a biscuit packet offered as prasad there along with cucumber. Such a strange combination naivedyam I thought!! For a second I remembered my biscuit packet purchase plan and wondered if Baba had kept it for me?? :)) That was a fleeting thought and after darshan we came out. There was a annadaan contribution counter where my husband was handing out some donation. The person there gave us the udi packet prasad and as we were proceeding to leave another man came from inside the temple and promptly handed over the biscuit packet along with the cucumber to me!!!\n\nOMS!!! What a divine parent!! What love for His children… A simple fleeting thought was answered by Him.. where is He not?? HE is the omnipresent omniscient indweller who takes care of our smallest needs. This experience may seem not so significant but for me it is His love of a mother.. just as a mother ensures her children have something to eat during the travel.

Balaram Dhurandhar’s name is mentioned in Chapter 50 of Holy Shri Sai Satcharitra. He lived during the year 1878 to 1925 as per the information available in Holy Shri Sai Satcharitra.\n\nShri.Balaram Dhurandhar belonged to the Pathare Prabhu community, of Santacruz, Bombay. He was an advocate of the Bombay High Court and sometime Principal of the Governament Law School, Bombay. The whole Dhurandhar family was pious and religious.\n\nShri.Balaram served his community, and wrote and published an account of it. He then turned his attention to spiritual and religious matters. He studied carefully Gita, and its commentary Jnaneshwari; and other philosiphical and other metaphysical works. He was a devotee of Vithoba of Pandharpur. He came in contact with Sai Baba in 1912 A.D. Six months previous to his visit to Shirdi, his brothers Babulji and Vamanrao came to Shirdi and took Baba’s darshan. They returned home, and mentioned their sweet experiences to Balaram and other members.\n\nThen they all decided to see Sai Baba. Before they came to Shirdi, Baba declared openly that – “Today many of my Darbar people are coming.” The Dhurandhar brothers were astonished to hear this remark of Baba, from others as they had not given any previous intimation of their trip.\n\nAll the other people prostrated themselves before Baba, and sat talking to Him. Baba said to them- “These are my Darbar people to whom I referred before” and said to the Dhurandhar brothers- “We are acquainted with each other for the last sixty generations.” All the brothers were meek and modest; they stood with joined hands, staring at Baba’s Feet. All the Satvic emotions such as tears, horripilation, choking, etc., moved them and they were all happy.\n\nThen they went to their lodging, took their meals and after taking a little rest again came to the Masjid. Balaram sat near Baba, messaging His Legs. Baba Who was smoking a chillam advanced it towards him and beckoned him to smoke it. Balaram was not accustomed to smoking, still he accepted the pipe, smoked it with great difficulty and returned it reverentially with a bow.\n\nThis was the most auspicious moment for Balaram. He was suffering from Asthma for six years. This smoke completely cured him of the disease, which never troubled him again. Some six years later, on a particular day, he again got an attack of Asthma. This was precisely the time when Baba took his Mahasamadhi.\n\nThe day of this visit was a Thursday; and the Dhurandhar brothers had the good fortune of witnessing the Chavadi. Balaram saw the lusture of pandurang on Baba’s face and next morning at the Kakad-Arti time, the same phenomenon – the same lusture of his Beloved Deity- Pandurang was visible again on Baba’s face.\n\nShri.Balaram Dhurandhar wrote, in Marathi, the life of the Maharashtra Saint Tukaram, but did not survive to see its publication. His brothers published it, later on, in 1928. In a short note on Balaram’s life given in the beginning of the book, the above account of Balaram’s visit has been fully corroborated therein (Vide page 6 of the book).\n\nhttp://saiamrithadhara.com/mahabhakthas/balaram_durandhar.\n\nSathya Sai Gayatri\n\nOm Saieshwaraya Vidmahe\n\nSathya Devaya Dheemahi\n\nThanna Sarvah Prachodayath\n\nWe know Sri Sathya Sai as Supreme Divinity Incarnate\n\nWe meditate on this God of Truth\n\nMay Almighty God lead us to Liberation\n\nSwami’s message\n\nWhat exactly is the aim and purpose of all the sastras, the Bhagavatam, the Puranas, these discourses and the harikathas? It is to tell man the truth about himself. There is no plot to mislead you. That is not the desire of the Sages who wrote down these annals and their own experiences. You know only the present and what is happening before your eyes.\n\nYou do not know that the present is related to the past and is preparing the course for the future. It is like the head-lines and titles of a film on the screen; as the letters gleam one after the other, you read them and pass on to the next that comes to view. Each new letter or word wipes out the one already before your eye, just as each birth wipes out the memory of the one already experienced.\n\n– Sri Sathya Sai Baba\n\nStory Time\n\nValue: Devotion\n\nSub-Value: Discrimination, Mindfulness\n\nAman was guarding a large herd of sheep. He sat on a small mound and drove away all the wolves that tried to approach the herd, even when the wolves were at a great distance.\n\nThe evening set in.\n\nThe man thought to himself, “throughout the day, I could deal beautifully with the wolves; not one could ever come anywhere near the herd. Nothing would happen at night either. The wolves might not come at all. Even if they come, I would deal with them properly.”\n\nNight fell.\n\nWhenever the wolves howled near the herd, the man would scream at the top of his voice and imagine the wolves had run away. But throughout the night, the wolves were busy carrying away several sheep.\n\nWhen the sun rose again, the man discovered that more than half the herd had been taken away from him. He became wiser and while the sun was shining the next day, he gathered enough fuel and lit a very big torch which he thought would drive the wolves away.\n\nIn the blazing light of the torch, he was able to see clearly, and thus, kept the wolves away.\n\nLearning\n\nThis is akin to us, sadhakas. So long, as we live in the presence of the sun- the brightness or the wisdom of our guru/ teacher and satsang or good company; we will be able to guard sheep of our good qualities, values, and samskaras from being devoured by the wolves of vices.\n\nHowever, the deluded and misled mind thinks that as we have learned enough and now can manage on our own without even truly grasping the teachings of our teacher. For example, we imagine that we are able to guard sheep of vices by just repeating a few lines or messages of the teacher without actually experiencing or grasping them.\n\nBut, when the darkness of ignorance manifests in the absence of the guru near us, we lose many of our virtues. Silently, the wolves of vices, against which we ourselves had been shouting all the time, enter us and rob us of the greater part of our virtues. It is then we realise our folly and return to the guru by God’s Grace.\n\nTherefore, we must become wise and soak in our lives the knowledge of the Guru, thus, while we are in the living presence of our Guru, we light up the torch of discrimination. When this torch is lit, darkness does not approach us at all, and the wolves of vices do not trouble us anymore. The light of the guru shines forever in and through us.\n\nA story from the ‘Parables of Sivananda.’\n\nPodcasts–Sai Prem– Podcast for spreading the human value stories.

That day we had committed for Narayan seva at the Sai centre. In the morning after cooking the rice and channa required for the seva we went to drop it off at the centre. Initially some one was to pick it up from our place but the plan changed and we had to drop it off.\n\nUsually monthly once on a certain nakshatra (star) day we definitely try to visit a close by temple and the closest one to us is the Ganesha temple. That star happened to be on 12th too. But since we had to drop off the food around 11.30/45am and temples usually shut by 12pm we thought we will visit Ganesha temple in the evening as usual. However the divine had another plan.\n\nWe also had to collect food items from other devotees place and thought we could reach centre by 11.30/40am. But to our surprise we had collected all the food by 11 and were on the way to the centre. My husband took another route to the centre to avoid road blockages due to some marathon happening in our area. And on this route was a shiva temple which we used to often visit earlier. It was only 11.11am by then and I suggested we could visit this temple instead of going to the other temple in the evening since we still have time to go to the centre. And we proceeded to this temple. It was a bit crowded and Lord Shiva Sannidhi was yet to open after some abishekam. We prayed at the Ganesha Sannidhi and just as i completed that; a lady with a whole plate of colourful bangles approached me and asked me to take a few bangles. I was happy and politely took just 2 and turned to face the Ambal Sannidhi.\n\nIt was beautifully decorated and as I finished praying there another lady approached me and said I should take more bangles as Ambal was giving it. I really felt blessed and took a few more. After doing pradakshina we went to the Sannidhi again and by then Lord Shiva Sannidhi had opened and they were offering deeparadhana to the Lord. We had a divine darshan of the lord and feeling full of bliss. As I was leaving the temple I asked one of the temple people if there was any important function as all the deities were adorned so wonderfully and promptly he answered “Today is Annair dinam.. Mother’s day”.. as soon as I heard that I was filled with gratitude for the love showered by the Divine Mother my Sai Ma who orchestrated the entire drama of us having to drop off the food, change of route and plan so that She could bless this daughter of Hers.\n\nAfter that we were on our way to the Sai centre to drop off the food and it was exactly 11.45 am. Blessed with divine darshan and seva on Mother’s day.\n\nOnly gratitude at Thy Divine lotus feet\n\nJai Sai Ram\n\nMonthly Newsletter\n\nLoving Sairams dear fellow devotees in this spiritual journey.\n\nBy the Divine grace of Lord Sai and all your support and encouragement Sai Times is now into our 6th year.

She went to Shirdi and met Sai Baba for the first time in the year 1898. Baba used to give her udhi every day with his own hand in small quantities and Chandrabai preserved that carefully as it had great healing power.\n\nShe had deep devotion towards Sai Baba and at the same time powerful response to her devotion from Sai Baba. When she went to him in the year 1898, the present masjid had not been built, nor the Wada of Sathe which came after rebuilding of the masjid. Baba was then sitting under the neem tree which is now in Sathe Wada. She saw Baba filling his panathi’s, i.e., lamps with water, instead of oil, after drinking away the little remnant of oil mixed with some water. She also saw his lying on a plank in the Masjid hung up from the ceiling with strings made of slender shreds of cloth. There were lamps on the plank, whereon he lay. No ‘bigwigs’ were coming then. Whenever she went to Shirdi, she used to stay in the house of some villagers.\n\nBaba’s kindness to her was very great. Her husband Mr. Borkar never went and saw Baba; but even to him, Baba showed great kindness. In or about 1909 her husband, who was an engineer, was engaged for the construction or repair of a bridge at Pandharpur. His residence was, therefore, at Pandharpur. When he was there, she had gone to Baba at Shirdi and was serving him.\n\nOne day Baba told her, ‘you had better go to Pandharpur and I will go with you’ and added that there was no difficulty for him to travel and that she should start expeditiously. So she started. She did not know what had happened there. When she reached that place, she found that her husband was not there, that he had resigned his work there and gone away to Mumbai. That information she got there for the first time and she was in great straits and sorrow. She had just a few rupees with her and had taken two companions with her. She had just money enough to take them back upto Kurdwadi. They went there. She had got thoroughly moody and was brooding over the situation. Suddenly a Fakir appeared before her, and asked her what she was brooding over. She evaded replying to him. He told her that her husband was at Daund and that she should go at once with her two companions to Daund. But, where was the railway fare to come from, she enquired. Then, he immediately delivered 3 tickets for Daund and went away. She took the tickets and with her companions boarded the train for Daund.\n\nMeanwhile, her husband was at Daund drinking tea and sinking into half dozed condition or a reverie. A Fakir appeared before him and said, “How is it you are neglecting my mother? She is coming down by the train in carriage No. such and such” and gave him the number of her carriage.\n\nHe was startled and got up saying, ‘Who is this that is taking me to task?’ and looked up. But the Fakir disappeared. When the train arrived, she stepped down and her husband was there to receive her and take her to his quarters. Her husband told her of the Fakir’s appearance before him and wanted to see a photo of Sai Baba whom she was worshipping. She showed him the photo and he recognized therein the Fakir who came to him.\n\nChandrabai’s husband Ramachandra was a railway employee. In the year 1912, he was serving at Pandharpur railway station. In that year Ashadhi Adik Maas came and Baba advised Chandrabai, “You do Kokila Vrat, Lord Shiva will be pleased with you and He will take care of your family’s welfare”.\n\nAdhering to Baba’s words, Chandrabai chose a pure and clean place near the River Godavari in Kopergaon village. One fine day, when Chandrabai was doing Pradikshana in the Shiva temple after finishing Arti, a young Fakir came and stood before her. He said thus, “Maai Mala Guda Chi Poli Ani Lasan Chi Chatani Dyaa meaning O mother please give me jaggery chapati with garlic paste (garlic pounded with spices, salt )”.\n\nChandrabai said, ” We observe vrat of Chaturmaas – four months from July to October and so we do not consume onion and garlic during these four months. Moreover, I don’t have any house of mine here. I am staying here to observe Kokila Vrat”. The Fakir said with a smile on His face and without any sign of disappointment, “Dennar Pan Chaangla Naahi Denaar Pan Changlaa meaning Welfare be to the one who gives and also to the one who does not give”.\n\nAfter the Fakir left, when Chandrabai recalled that incident she felt that the Fakir had the same glow on his face which she saw on Baba’s face in Shirdi.She thought, “To conclude my Kokila Vrat I cannot go to Shirdi and offer anything to Baba, but when He came to me, I sent him empty handed!!! Who is more unfortunate than me? God came to my place and I sent him without giving Him anything”. She became very restless at night and said to herself, “The night is not passing away quickly”. She mentally started praying to Baba, “O my loving Sai Nath! Please pass away this black long night quickly, so that I can come to Shirdi to have your Darshan”.\n\nSomehow the night passed and she woke up early, quickly finished off her morning chores, prepared jaggery chapati and garlic paste for Baba and set off for Shirdi.\n\nOn reaching Shirdi, she saw that Baba was returning from Lendi Baag. She immediately fell at Baba’s feet. She was very content with Baba’s Darshan and her love flowed in the form of tears. After the noon arti was performed by Bapusaheb Jog in the Dwarkamai,Baba sent all devotees to their lodgings and homes and Chandrabai then offered jaggery chapati and garlic paste made out of love to Baba.\n\nBaba said, “When I came to you to get my desired thing, you did not give me, now why have you come to me with these things?” Chandrabai said, “Ignorant being as I am, I could not recognize you but now I have come to you with your desired food”.\n\nBaba said to others, “She is my sister in my last seven births. Wherever I go she finds me and comes to me” and turned to Chandrabai and said, “Go, your Vrat will be fruitful”. In this way Baba blessed Chandrabai.\n\nChandrabai realised that Lord Shiva had taken form of Sai Baba for completing Kokila Vrat and thus her joy knew no bounds. She concluded Kokila Vrat and returned to Pandharpur quite contended and happy.\n\nhttp://saiamrithadhara.com/mahabhakthas/chandrabai_borkar.html\n\nSathya Sai Gayatri\n\nOm Saieshwaraya Vidmahe\n\nSathya Devaya Dheemahi\n\nThanna Sarvah Prachodayath\n\nWe know Sri Sathya Sai as Supreme Divinity Incarnate\n\nWe meditate on this God of Truth\n\nMay Almighty God lead us to Liberation\n\nSwami’s Vesak day message\n\nEightfold Path\n\nThe Eightfold Path is Right Vision, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. It is the path of the spiritually noble.\n\nMukti, or liberation, is freedom from suffering. The Triple Jewels, Triratna Sharanam, are means to achieve Mukti and to reach the goal of Nirvana, which is the only truth. These are closely inter-related. It is said that in order to attain Nirvana, one should have a pure heart. Indeed, the Buddha’s emphasis was entirely on purity in every aspect of daily life.\n\nThe Buddha also recognized the principle of unity of the Self and based His life on this Truth.\n\nIn Gita Vahini, Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba wrote: “The bliss in which the person of steady wisdom is immersed does not arise from external objects; that person has no need of them, either. Bliss is in everyone as part of their very nature. Those with pure consciousness find the highest bliss in the realization of their own reality, the Atma (Self).”\n\nThe Buddha lives forever and not just in the noble and sacred story of the Crown Prince who sacrificed his royal birthright to seek, and eventually achieve, Self-Enlightenment and to declare a new path that leads one to Nirvana. The Buddha lives on as the supreme ideal of man’s potential for Buddhahood. Within us all lies the potential to become a Buddha, an ‘Awakened One’.\n\nStory Time\n\nValue- Peace\n\nSub value- Patience\n\nOne day Buddha was walking through a village. A very angry and rude young man came up and began insulting him. “You have no right teaching others,” he shouted. “You are as stupid as everyone else. You are nothing but a fake.”\n\nBuddha was not upset by these insults. Instead he asked the young man, “Tell me, if you buy a gift for someone, and that person does not take it, to whom does the gift belong?”\n\nThe man was surprised to be asked such a strange question and answered, “It would belong to me, because I bought the gift.”\n\nThe Buddha smiled and said, “That is correct. And it is exactly the same with your anger. If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, then the anger falls back on you.”\n\nLearning\n\nOne must learn to control our anger. Our words and actions can affect others. Think before you speak. Also develop patience and tolerance towards someone who behaves angrily.\n\nSource- buddhajourney.net\n\nPodcasts–Sai Prem– Podcast for spreading the human value stories.

The cymbals provide the ‘taala’ (beat) and the tambura provide the ‘shruti’ (tune/pitch). As both of these are required to enhance the effect of glory of God sung from the mouth; the experiences of the world will one day surely lead us to understand the glory of the Lord.\n\nStory based on message 2.2\n\nMaster’s messages-2.3- Three types of devotion\n\nOne must move on from one stage to the other through devotion and love for God.\n\nEssence\n\nThere are 3 types of devotion/sadhana namely- Vihanga- It is like the bird swooping a ripe fruit; in which the devotee is impatient and loses the fruit obtained. Next is Markata- which is like a monkey; jumping from one fruit to another; not knowing what one actually wants and what is the actual goal; and the final is Pipeelika which is like an ant moving towards sweetness, a devotee moves towards the Lord and attains His grace.\n\nStories based on the above message\n\nDevotee’s steadfast faith\n\nA Tapasvi’s Determination\n\nDevotion and Faith\n\nThe two oars to cross the worldly ocean- Devotion and Faith\n\nEssence\n\nBhakti (devotion) and Shraddha (faith) are 2 oars required to the cross this samsara. When there is faith; devotion comes on its own. Complete faith and trust in God with pure devotion can help one cross this world with all its ups and downs. It gives one strength and confidence to face challenging situations in life. Faith in our own self as well as in God. The lord melts at the devotion of the devotees and takes care of their needs; whatever is best for them will happen.\n\nStory based on the above message\n\nOne can realise the real and unreal world only through experience.\n\nEssence\n\nExperience is needed for one to realise that this world is unreal. Just like a fire is taken to be only as a light till one touches and experiences the heat from it; one realises that it has both heat and light. Similarly through experience man can realise that the world is real as well as unreal.\n\nStory based on the above message\n\nNever judge anyone. One cannot understand one’s own self properly and we try judging others.\n\nEssence\n\nMany of us tend to judge others often by their past actions or their nature as we know, see or understand them. Most of the times we end up being wrong and regret our quick action of judging others. The way a person behaves, responds or reacts is dependent on the situation and nature of the person. We are no one to judge others. This is not only seen in day to day mundane activities but in spirituality as well. We easily judge others by how much they pray, do good or attend satsangs etc and label them as theist and atheist. Always what is seen is not necessarily true. Some seekers may be quietly moving forward in their spiritual journey. All need not act in the same way. There is no particular right or wrong path. Each one may be following his or her own path. Spiritual arrogance is the worst kind of arrogance. The sign of progress in spirituality is when one starts eliminating his/her ego, anger, jealousy, habit of judging others etc\n\nStory based on the above message"
