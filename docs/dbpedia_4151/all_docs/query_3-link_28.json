        "text": "Battle lines are drawn for the Sankranthi war in 2020 and now intense speculation is going on among fans and movie lovers as to who will win the Sankranthi war.\n\nStylish Star Allu Arjun and Super Star Mahesh Babu are locking horns releasing their films Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo and Sarileru Neekevvaru on January 12th.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven before the super star wars on-screen, Victory Venkatesh and Naga Chaitanya are getting ready to attract movie lovers as Venky Mama on January 11. In between Kalyan Ram sprang a surprise by announcing the release of his film Entha Manchi Vadavura on Jan 12.\n\nLet us see which star's film has the chance to emerge as a Sankranthi winner.\n\nSarileru Neekevvaru: Mahesh Babu has huge Sankranthi sentiment. His films Takkari Donga, Okkadu, Businessman, Seetamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, Nenokkadine released during the festival. Among them, Takkari Donga and Nenokkadine failed at the box office. Producer Dil Raju too has Sankranthi sentiment. His films Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, F2, Shatamanam Bhavati, Yevadu which released during Sankranthi turned out to be super hits. Anil Ravipudi too scored a hit with F2 during Sankranthi and the trio are confident of repeating the sentiment with a sensational hit.\n\nAla Vaikunthapurramuloo: Allu Arjun very rarely entered the Sankranthi rate. His films Desamuduru, Yevadu (guest role) released during Sankranthi. Both turned out to be super hits. Trivikram Srinivas' Agnyaathavaasi failed at the box office during sankranti. However both Allu Arjun and Trivikram have a sentiment. Their two films Julayi and S/O Satyamurthy turned out to be hits and expectations are high on Ala Vaikunthapuramlo.\n\nVenky Mama: The film sprang a surprise by entering the Sankranthi race and many expect that Venkatesh sentiment will work for the film. Venkatesh's Rakta Tilakam, Prema, Chanti, Pokiri Raja (average), Dharma Chakram, Kalisundam Ra, Devi Putrudu (Flop), Lakshmi, Namo Venkatesa, Bodyguard, Seethamma Vakitlo Srimalle Chettu, Gopala Gopala , F2 released during Sankranthi. Except for few films, most of them turned out to be hits.\n\nEspecially Venkatesh's multi starrers Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, Gopala Gopala and F2 turned out to be good hits. So this sentiment may work for Veky Mama. Naga Chaitanya till now did not have Sankranthi release.\n\nEntha Manchi Vadavura: Kalyan Ram is testing his luck for the first time during Sankranthi. However, director Satish Vegesna scored a hit with Shatamanam bhavati which even won the national award."
