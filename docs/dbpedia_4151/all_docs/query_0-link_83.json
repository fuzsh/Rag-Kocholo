        "text": "Daggubati Venkatesh (born on December 13, 1960) is an Indian film actor who stars in Tollywood films. He is the son of veteran Tollywood producer D. Rama Naidu. He is popularly known as Victory Venkatesh in Tollywood.\n\nVenkatesh also known as \"Victory Venkatesh\" graduated with an MBA degree from Monterey Institute of International Studies, USA. After his return to India, he wanted to get into production. He became an actor in telugu films. His father, D. Rama Naidu and his brother D.Suresh Babu successfully runs one of the most prestigious banners in Telugu Cinema, Suresh Productions. He is married to Neeraja(Madanapalle,Chittoor District) and has a son Arjun Ramnath(6) and three daughters, Aashritha(19), Hayavahini(14) and Bhavana(8).He is won of the family heroes of telugu film industry.Career\n\nVenkatesh debuted through Kaliyuga Pandavulu in the year 1986. The movie was not only a hit but also got him his first Nandi award, which is a rare accomplishment for an actor who has just completed his debut film. At an early phase of his career, Venkatesh got to work with Kasinadhuni Viswanath, who is considered a great classical director. Just two years old as an actor, Venkatesh acted in Swarnakamalam directed by Kasinadhuni Viswanath. The movie got him his second Nandi. Varasudochadu, released in the same year, was another trophy. After a few flops, he got a break in the form of Bobbili Raja. Added to the name and performance of Venkatesh was delightful Divya Bharati, good comedy and melodious music. Bobbili Raja was a musical hit and also entertained audience from all sections because of it's ingredients. In Shathruvu, Venkatesh played angry young lawyer who takes law into his hands after failing to fight the corruption through the court. Venkatesh has also worked with famed Bollywood director (originally Telugu) Ram Gopal Varma in the film Kshana Kshanam, which was a huge success at the box office[citation needed]. Chanti, a remake of Tamil movie Chinna Tambi, happened in 1991. Chanti was definitely a challenging project for Venkatesh. Chanti was a box office hit and Venkatesh's career benefitted hugely by it. Starting with Chanti, he went for continuous remakes - that got him branded as a \"remake actor\". Anari was the remake of Chanti in Bollywood's Hindi cinema. Venkatesh started becoming a family hero and turned out a huge fan following among women. Venkatesh has acted in a lot of blockbusters. His recent film, Adavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule is a hit.Awards\n\n* 1986, Nandi Award for Best Male Debut, Kaliyuga Pandavulu\n\n* 1986, Kinnera Award for Best Actor, Kaliyuga Pandavulu\n\n* 1988, Kinnera Award for Best Actor, Brahma Putrudu\n\n* 1988, Nandi Award for Best Actor, Swarnakamalam\n\n* 1989, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu), Prema\n\n* 1989, Nandi Award for Best Actor, Prema\n\n* 1991, Madras Filmfans Award for Best Actor, Coolie No.1\n\n* 1991, Cinegoers Award for Best Actor, Coolie No.1\n\n* 1991, Bagyanagar Award for Best Actor, Shatruvu\n\n* 1992, Cinegoers Award for Best Actor, Sundarakanda\n\n* 1992, Yuvavahini Award for Best Actor, Sundarakanda\n\n* 1993, Cinegoers Award for Best Performance, Abbai Garu\n\n* 1993, Kalasagar Award for Best Actor, Abbai Garu\n\n* 1996, Vamsee Berkley Award for Best Actor, Dharma Chakram\n\n* 1996, Kalasagar Award for Best Actor, Dharma Chakram\n\n* 1996, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu), Dharma Chakram\n\n* 1996, Nandi Award for Best Actor, Dharma Chakram\n\n* 1998, Kinnera Award for Best Actor, Ganesh\n\n* 1998, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu), Ganesh\n\n* 1998, Nandi Award for Best Actor, Ganesh\n\n* 2000, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu), Jayam Manade Raa\n\n* 2000, Nandi Award for Best Actor, Kalisundam Raa\n\n* 2006, Santosham Best Actor Award, SankranthiFilmography\n\n2009\n\nMarma Yogi\n\n2008\n\nChintakayala Ravi Ravi\n\n2007\n\nTulasi Tulasi Ram\n\nAdavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule Ganesh\n\n2006\n\nLalshmi Lakshmi Narayana\n\n2005\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose Ashok/Subash Chandra Bose\n\nSankranthi Raghavendra Winner, Santosham Best Actor Award\n\nNomination, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu)\n\nSoggadu Cameo2004\n\nGharshana DCP Rama Chandra\n\nMalliswari Prasad\n\n2003\n\nVasantham Ashok\n\n2002\n\nGemini Gemini\n\nVasu Vasu\n\n2001\n\nNuvvu Naaku Nachav Venkateswarlu aka \"Venky\"\n\nPrematho Raa Chandra Sekhar\n\nDevi Putrudu Krishna/Balaram\n\n2000\n\nJayam Manade Raa Abhiram/Rudrama Naidu/Mahadeva Naidu Winner, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu)\n\nKalisundam Raa Raghu Winner, Nandi Award for Best Actor\n\n1999\n\nSeenu Seenu\n\nRaja Raja\n\n1998\n\nPremante Idera Murali\n\nGanesh Ganesh Winner, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu)\n\nSurya Vamsham Harischandra Prasad/Bhanu\n\n1997\n\nPellichesukondam Anand\n\nPremichukondam Raa Giri\n\nChinnabbai Chinnabbai alias Sundaram\n\n1996\n\nPavithra Bhandam Vijay\n\nSarada Bullodu Vijay\n\nIntlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu Sriram\n\nSahasa Veerudu Sagara Kanya Ravi Chandra\n\nDharma Chakram Rakesh Winner, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu)\n\n1995\n\nTakdheervala Hindi\n\nPokiri Raja Balaraj Raja\n\n1994\n\nMuddula Priyudu Raju\n\nSuper Police Vijay\n\n1993\n\nAbbaigaru Dora Babu\n\nKondapalli Raja\n\nAnari Hindi\n\n1992\n\nSundarakanda Venkateswarlu\n\nChinarayudu Chinarayudu\n\nChanti Chanti\n\n1991\n\nKshana Kshanam Chandu\n\nSuyra IPS Surya\n\nCoolie No.1 Raju alias Bharath\n\nShatruvu Ashok\n\n1990\n\nBobbili Raja Raja\n\nAggi Ramudu\n\n1989\n\nTwo Town Rowdy Shakthi\n\nDhruva Naksthram Dhruva Kumar\n\nOntari Poratam\n\nPrema Pruthvi Winner, Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu)1988\n\nVarasudochadu Raghu\n\nSwarna Kamalam Chandra\n\nBrahma Putrudu\n\nRaktha Tilakam\n\n1987\n\nSreenivasa Kalyanam Srinivas\n\nVijetha Vikram Vikram\n\nTrimurthulu\n\nBharatamlo Arjunudu\n\nAjeyudu Murali\n\n1986\n\nBrahma Rudrulu Prasad\n\nKaliyuga Pandavulu Vijay\n\nRam Gopal Varma (born April 7, 1962) is an Indian film director, writer and film producer from Andhra Pradesh. He is popular for his slick, grisly films and his penchant for horror and gangster films. He owns a production house which churns out a large number of small budget Indie films every year, with great success. He has a cult like fan following in India and abroad. His most successful films include Shiva, Rangeela, Satya, Company and Sarkar.\n\nEarly years\n\nRam Gopal Varma was born to Krishnam Raju and Suryamma. He was a dropout from V.R.Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada before taking up a career initially as the owner of a video shop and then became one of India's leading film directors. He was not a regular at classes, but was known more as a big movie buff during his college days and used to analytically watch both American and Indian films through repeat viewings. He and his uncle were crazy about movies and would often skip classes to watch them in spite of beatings from his mother. He used to get very excited each time he saw the ‘Directed by’ and ‘A Film by’ title card and had the same passion when he saw his own name on the title card of his debut Shiva. There was no support from his family and even his uncle thought he was crazy.\n\nHe is highly influenced by Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, however has his own style. He doesn’t bother with reviews and says, “Why should I worry about what the faceless reviewer thinks about my film? If he doesn’t like it, there is nothing that I could do about it.” Varma also does not respect any film awards and never attends award functions, regardless of whether he is nominated.\n\nHe is currently working on a project Amaanush a remake of X-Men, a story which was conceived by noted storywriter Chandra Ram Malvotta from Bangalore\n\nCareer\n\nRam Gopal Varma started his film career in the Hyderabad film industry as an assistant director for the films Raogarillu and Collectorgari Abbai produced by S.S.Creations. Ram Gopal Varma made a huge mark in the telugu industry with his debut film Shiva , a violent stylized crime drama with a college backdrop. At the age of 28, with no film background and training, he was able to convince Nagarjuna, then a young telugu star to do his debut movie. Nagarjuna liked the narration of the script and energy displayed by Varma, and produced the movie himself. Shiva became a landmark film for the Telugu industry and was later remade by Varma in Hindi, but was not able to repeat the same commercial success as that of the original.\n\nHis another bilingual (Telugu/Hindi) film Kshana Kshanam (starring Venkatesh and Sridevi in the lead) was loosely based on a Hollywood flick Romancing the Stone and was another huge blockbuster for the young Varma. Raatri (a bilingual horror flick with Revathi in the lead),Antham (a hard hitting bilingual crime drama with Nagarjuna and Urmila Matondkar in the lead, all failed to repeat the commercial success of his first two films.\n\nGovinda Govinda (with Nagarjuna and Sridevi in the lead) became controversial because the villain of the film steals the diamond studded crown from the sacred Lord Venkateshwara idol. Despite it being purely fiction, the scene was considered sacrilegious. Indian censor boards asked Varma to delete this scene and the movie became a dud at the box-office.\n\nOne of his release Gaayam with newcomer Jagapati Babu and Urmila Matondkar was about the politics of a city, most people consider it to be Vijayawada during his college days in the city. The screenplay was provided by popular Tamil film director Mani Ratnam, and Ratnam wrote the script based on The Godfather. It became a huge success and put Varma back on top.\n\nHe would then start his own production banner Varma corporation limited and produced Telugu films such as Money, Money Money, Gulabi, Wife of Mr. Vara Prasad, Anaganaga oka roju, Deyyam (with the last two directed by Varma himself). His assistant directors Krishna Vamsi, Shiva Naageshwar Rao and Teja who worked as a cinematographer for his movies, later became big names in the telugu industry.\n\nWhile popular Indian Cinema was either over the top action films or glamorous love stories, his movies were more deep and realistic. Though Indian Cinema has always produced ace movie-makers who reveled in the portrayal of realism, he is credited for bringing realistic films into the mainstream and creating his own niche as a maker of stylish yet realistic commercial cinema.\n\nHe has been known for remaking his own movies. He remade Shiva(Telugu) into Shiva(Hindi) then re-remade the same movie in 2006 as Shiva 2006(Hindi) with a different cast and tasted commercial failure. He then remade Raatri(Telugu) as Raat(Hindi). He made Antham(Telugu) into Drohi(Hindi).\n\nHis first success in Bollywood started with the commercial blockbuster Rangeela, a romantic drama. Urmila Matondkar became a big Bollywood star overnight. A. R. Rahman also became a star in Bollywood with this film. Attempting to recreate the success of Rangeela, Varma followed Rangeela with Daud, a romantic adventure, which was a huge dud.\n\nVarma decided to switch tracks and released the ground breaking film Satya, a film based on the Mumbai underworld. The film was brutally realistic as Varma did extensive research on Mumbai organized crime and shot the film documentary style along Mumbai slums, chawls and streets. Made with a shoe string budget and non-stars, this film made famous actors like Manoj Bajpai, J.D Chakravarthy, and writers like Saurabh Shukla and Anurag Kashyap and music composers like Sandeep Chowta and Vishal Bharadwaj. The film was widely considered Varma’s first true masterwork, and with the film Varma single-handedly created a genre which would be popularly known as the ‘Mumbai-noir’. Some critics bashed Varma for his glorification of Mumbai hoodlums, causing Varma to add a cautionary message during the end credits of the film. Varma decided afterwards to only direct films in Bollywood from then onwards. The mega blockbuster film spawned many imitations in Bollywood, but all were largely inferior.\n\nAnother hard hitting masterpiece followed shortly after with ‘Shool’, written and produced by Varma. The film looked into the life of a police officer, in the harsh rural setting of Bihar. The film repeated Varma favorite Manoj Bajpai and was a commercial and critical success.\n\nWith movies like Kaun, Bhoot and his award winning masterpiece Company he cut out song and dance sequences commonplace in Bollywood films, so as not to interrupt the flow of the narration. He is also known to be very particular about the background scores and for a long time collaborated with composers Sandeep Chowta and Vishal Bharadwaj.\n\nRam Gopal Varma often criticises the popular Bollywood film fraternity. He does so with sarcastic humor. His films almost always deal with the contemporary and urban. The scheme is mostly set in the city of Mumbai, however, the scope is allowed to expand as per the story. He is also known for introducing new actors and technicians in his films, rather than using established actors and technicians. He often uses Indian stage actors in his films rather than Bollywood stars. Critics say his movies don't just sketch a macro perspective but go deeper into the minds of the protagonists attempting to uncover their motivations.\n\nHis recent release Naach, which Ram Gopal Varma called his best film yet, was a self reflective piece and was an intense drama about the relationship between an idealistic choreographer who wants to revolutionize the film world and an ambitious actor who just wants to become rich and famous. The film did not do well commercially but was a critical success. In a recent interview with the Indian Express newspaper the filmmaker criticized Indian audiences saying \"I gave Ayn Rand to a Municipal School.\"\n\nHis next film as a director was Sarkar and released in June 2005. The film had the father-son Bollywood superstar duo Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan playing a father-son role in the film. Varma had said that Sarkar was a mix of Marlon Brando from the The Godfather, and the real life tale of respected Mumbai politico Bal Thackeray. Amitabh Bachchan played the character of Sarkar who is a self righteous and powerful politician.\n\nHe spends most of his time these days producing small budget films for his production house Varma Corp, for most of which he often is the ‘ghost director’. He produces films at a rapid rate that is unfamiliar to the Indian Film Industry. He has had many successes including Ab Tak Chhappan - based on the life of infamous Mumbai police officer Daya Nayak, 'D' - a prequel to his earlier hit \"Company\" based on real life Mumbai ganglord Dawood Ibrahim and Ek Hasina Thi. Also with the Darna series, 'Darna Mana Hai' and 'Darna Zaroori Hai', he created an innovative path breaking Bollywood horror series but unfortunately both met with critical and commercial failure. Varma is still primarily known for his 'Mumbai noirs'. His Production company - popularly known as \"Factory\" recently started making a remake of legendary Hindi movie (King of all remakes) - Sholay starring Amitabh Bachchan (for the role of Gabbar Singh) and many other Bollywood stars.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nRam Gopal Varma has won the Nandi award (Awards given by Government of Andhra Pradesh yearly) for Best Director thrice for 'Shiva','Kshana kshanam'and 'Prema Katha'.\n\nHe also has won Best Director (in Bollywood) four times for Satya, Jungle, Company and Bhoot.\n\nRelationships\n\nAllegedly Ram gopal varma has had numerous relationships with the actresses he has discovered, most notably Urmila Matondkar, Antara Mali. Ram Gopal Varma counters these rumors by saying that all the heroines in his films are his sisters. He also has one daughter from an earlier marriage (to someone outside film-industry, but which did not last long).\n\nFILMOGRPHY\n\nShiva (1989)\n\n• Kshana Kshanam (1991)\n\n• Raat (1992)\n\n• Antam (1992)\n\n• Drohi (1992)\n\n• Gaayam (1993)\n\n• Govindha Govindha (1993)\n\n• Rangeela (1995)\n\n• Great Robbery (1996)\n\n• Deyyam (1996)\n\n• Anaganaga Oka Roju (1997)\n\n• Daud: Fun on the Run (1997)\n\n• Satya (1998)\n\n• Prema Katha (1999)\n\n• Kaun (1999)\n\n• Mast (1999)\n\n• Jungle (2000)\n\n• Company (2002)\n\n• Bhoot (2003)\n\n• Naach (2004)\n\n• Sarkar (2005)\n\n• Shiva (2006)\n\n• Darna Zaroori Hai (Story 2) (2006)\n\n• Nishabd (2007)\n\n• Ram Gopal Varma Ke Sholay (2007)\n\n• Sarkar 2\n\nProductions\n\nMoney (1993)\n\n• Money Money (1994)\n\n• Gulabi (1996)\n\n• W/O V.Varaprasad (1998)\n\n• Dil Se (1998)\n\n• Shool (1999)\n\n• Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya (2001)\n\n• Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega (2001)\n\n• Road (2002)\n\n• Darna Mana Hai (2003)\n\n• Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon!

He grew up in his native village with his grand parents, while his family was elsewhere because of his father's occupation. The sense of discipline and hard work which he still embraces were introduced at a very young age in his life and the tough childhood he had, being the eldest in his family, have helped him to handle many such events of higher proportion with great expertise in the later stages of his life. Little did he imagine, even in the wildest of his dreams that he would, one day, be a Megastar and rule the Telugu Film Industry. Years later, this youngster, dearly called \"Chiru\" in the Film Industry, with his hard work and dedication to his profession could make it really big in the field hitting the limelight, with an unparallel fan following emulating his every act, word, dress and dance. What makes this ordinary human being such an extraordinary one - Hardwork and Dedication!\n\nVaraprasad’s education was nomadic accounting to his father Venkat Rao’s frequent transfers to Ongole, Bapatla, Chirala, Nellore etc, which didn’t really defer Vara Prasad as he gained a great friend circle wherever he was. Varaprasad is really fortunate for his father has constantly encouraged him after having discovered the undaunted liking of his son towards cultural activities. Varaprasad did his schooling in Nidadavolu, Gurajala, Ponnuru, Mangalagiri and Mogalturu. He also won first prize for his first performance as Parandamayya Panthulu. After high school, Varaprasad joined Bi.P.C in P.R.Sharma Jr. College at Ongole. Following that he finished his B.Com from Narasapur college.\n\nAfter graduation, Varaprasad moved to Madras to seek a career in his chosen field of acting in the Film Industry. To get himself ready for the camera, he joined in a film institute. This was in 1977. Varaprasad was offered the lead role in the film Punaadi Raallu, produced by Sheikh Abdul Khadir in the direction of Raj Kumar, which has laid the foundation stone to the acting career of Vara Prasad as Chiranjeevi. Even though Punadi Raalu was his first movie, it was Pranam Kareedhu that was his first release. Pranam kareedhu directed by K Vasu was released on September 22nd, 1978. The second movie to release was Manavuri Pandavulu from which Chiranjeevi started gaining recognition as hero among the spectators. In the beginning of his career, Chiranjeevi donned villain roles in films like Kukka Kaatuki Cheppu Debba, Kotthapeta Rowdi etc. His focused concentration in speedy dance movements, risky hair rising fights evoked immense response from the spectators.\n\nChiranjeevi tied the wedding knot to Surekha, daughter of eminent yesteryear comedian Allu Ramalingayya, on 20th of February, 1980. The auspicious time was 11:50 AM. The couple is blessed with 2 daughters, Susmitha and Srija and a son, Ram Charan Teja.\n\nFilms like 'Kothala Raayudu', 'Punnami Naagu', 'Mogudu Kaavali', 'Kiraayi Rowdeelu', 'Subhalekha', 'Maga Maharaju', 'Intlo Raamayya-Veedhilo Krishnayya', 'Abhilasha', 'Manthri Gaari Viyyankudu' etc are the super-hits in his first phase. 'Khaidi', released in 1983, gave Chiranjeevi a thrusting progress towards a commercial career. His fights and dance movements in this film are still a rage among the movie lovers. He never looked back after this. The films ala Goonda, Donga, Nagu, Adavi Donga, Yama Kinkarudu, Kirathakudu, Rusthum proved his fighting skills in action roles. He is referred to as Dynamic hero during that time.\n\nThe films ala Vijetha, Magadheerudu, KondaveetiRaja, Chantabbayi, Challenge, Rakshasudu, DongaMogudu showed his versatility in performance.\n\nThe film Pasivadi Pranam, released in 1987, gave Chiranjeevi a super stardom. New style of dances were introduced. Chiranjeevi created waves with his steps which is known as \"Break Dance\". In the same year he acted in SwayamKrushi in the direction of kalatapasvi K. Viswanath and won Nandi Award for his performance.\n\nChiranjeevi is a Saleable Product, Chiranjeevi is a Hot cake - is what both industry people and the spectators chant beyond any doubt. He gave super duper hits such as YamudikiMogudu, AthakiYamudu Ammayiki Mogudu.\n\nChiru became Supreme Hero with Yamudiki Mogudu. The title \"Megastar\" was used for the first time while publicizing K.S.Rama Rao’s movie Marana Mrudangam which released in August 1988. In the same year was released Rudraveena directed by K.Balachander, which bagged the \"Nargis Dutt\" award for Chiranjeevi in the national arena.\n\nThe first half of 90’s decade peaked Chiranjeevi’s career graph to soaring heights for every movie released rewrote the box-office history. Gang Leader, Rowdi Alludu, Jagadeka Veerudu-Athiloka Sundari, Gharana Mogudu are only a few to be cited.\n\nUnfortunately, even the much bright star, Sun, encounters a phase of eclipse. And Chiranjeevi is no exception. Movies like Mechanic Alludu, SP Parasuram, Big Boss, Rickshavodu proved to be commercially disastrous. Mugguru Mongallu, Alluda Majaka did average at the box office. Big Boss and Rikshavodu were mere formula films. The controversy raked by Alluda Majaaka for some double-intender dialogues and few scenes affected Chiranjeevi’s image among his fans.\n\nChiranjeevi threw a self-declared 'gap' after Rickshavodu to have a self-scanning of his conscience and thus emerged out with much mature and versatile portrayal with the film Hitler followed by 'Master', 'Baavagaaru Baagunnara', 'Choodaalani Vundi', ''Sneham Kosam', 'Sneham Kosam', 'Iddaru Mithrulu', 'Annayya', 'Indra', 'Stalin', 'Shankar Dada MBBS' and Chiranjeevi fans are eagerly awaiting the release of Shankar Dada Zindabad.\n\nChiranjeevi didn’t limit himself only to Telugu spectators. He is well acclaimed by Bollywood for his films 'Prathibandh', 'Aaj ka Goondaraj'. The dubbed version of 'Gang Leader', The hunters of the Indian treasure, introduced Chiranjeevi to foreign spectators as well.\n\nCharity and Services:\n\nOn October 2, 1998, he founded the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust (CCT), which includes Chiranjeevi Blood and Eye Banks. It is the state's largest recipient of Blood and Eye Donations. The Blood Bank of the CCT helped over 80,000 people and the Eye Bank has helped about 1000 people in the state of Andhra Pradesh since its opening.\n\nSo far around 3.5 lakh people have pledged their eyes to CCT so far, giving 1600 people eye sight through CCT. CCT has also won the \"Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award\" by the AP State Government for the past 4 years.\n\nOn June 10, 2006, The President of India, Dr. Abdul Kalam, inaugurated the Chiranjeevi Charitable Foundation (CCF) at the Jubilee Hills Check post in Hyderabad.\n\nRecently chiranjeevi charitable trust has reached one more landmark by crossing the one lakh mark in collecting the blood and more than 96,000 people were helped with blood by this blood bank.\n\nChiranjeevi Trivia:\n\n* Chiranjeevi won Southern Filmfare Award (Best Actor) for seven years\n\n* Chiranjeevi is one of the highest paid actors in India.\n\n* Chiranjeevi's \"Thriller\" music video is one of the most viewed videos on Youtube.\n\n* Chiranjeevi's old hit movies are given to the distributors and exhibitors for free when ever they loose money on his new movie. And his old movies are still good grossers at box office\n\nAwards\n\nIn January 2006, Mr Chiranjeevi was honored with the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award in India. In November 2006, Chiranjeevi was awarded with a honorary doctorate by Andhra University for his services to the Telugu film industry and for his social work, A P Govt Nandi Awards for Swayankrushi (1987) and Apatbandhavudu (1992). Over 10 Filmfare Awards won.Address of Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust:\n\nChiranjeevi Charitable Trust, 6-3-345/16, Hindi Nagar, PanjaGutta, Hyderabad - 500 034Telephone: (040)-335
