        "text": "By Sage Leela Shuka aka Vilwamangalathu Swamiyar, Bilwamangala Thakura\n\nTranslated By P.R.Ramachander\n\nNectar to the ears of Lord Krishna.\n\nThis great work was composed by Sage Leela Shuka according to the last sloka of the first chapter. Elsewhere he mentions that he is a Shaivite but attached to Lord Krishna. It is generally agreed by historians that Leela shuka was his pseudonym and he was known as Vilwamangalathu Swamiyar. He is known as Bilwamangala Thakura in the North India and his samadhi is in Mathura. According to local legend (in Mathura) as well as a majority of the literary commentators agree that he was from Kerala. Some of the reasons for this are\n\nIn several slokas the poet mentions the child Lord Krishna as wearing the golden chain with Tiger’s nail. This was and is done in Kerala only.\n\nThe famous stotra starting “Kararavindam…” is the first sloka of Balamukundashtakam which is written by Vilwamangalathu Swamiyar of Kerala.\n\nThis work was spotted by Chaithanya Maha Prabhu of Bengal on his visit to Andhra Pradesh. There is a story that people were sent to Trivandrum to get a full book as only the first chapter was available in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nVilwamangalthu Swamiyar is believed to a great scholar who was a great devotee of Guruvayurappan, the lord of Guruvayur. It seems the child Krishna used to come whenever he was called by the Swamiyar. He is also believed to be responsible for spotting and building many of the temples of Kerala.\n\nSome of his works are\n\nSreekrishna Karnaamritham\n\nSreechinham\n\nPurushakaaram\n\nAbhinava-Kausthubha-Maala\n\nDakshinaamoorthy-Sthavam\n\nKaalavadha Kaavyam\n\nDurgaasthuthi\n\nBaalakrishna Sthothram\n\nBaalagopaala Sthuthy\n\nSreekrishna Varadaashtakam\n\nVrindaavana Sthothram\n\nBhaavanaamukuram\n\nRaamachandraashtakam\n\nGanapathy Sthothram\n\nAnubhavaashtakam\n\nMahaakaalaashtakam\n\nKaarkotakaashtakam\n\nKrishnaleelaa-Vinodam\n\nSankara-Hridayamgamaa\n\nSubanda-Saamraajyam\n\nThinganda-Saamraajyam\n\nKramadeepika\n\nIt is also believed that Lord Krishna used to shake his head as a sign of approval for the slokas of this great work( Sri Krishna Karnamrutham) that He approved. The Swamiyar used to reject all those sloka that did not get His approval. On the days when he did not approve any of the Slokas, it seems the Swamiyar did not partake in any food.\n\nThis book has three chapters containing respectively 110, 109, and 108 shlokas. The author sings mainly about two stages of the life of Krishna-the childhood and youth with a few references to later stages of His life.\n\nThere are several translations available of this shloka[1][2].\n\nThis translation follows the Malayalam commentaries and the Tamil translation by Sri Anna[3].\n\nSri Krishna Karnamrutham / Prathama Aaswasa (first chatper)[edit]\n\nChinthamanir jayathi Soma girir gurur may, Siksha guruscha Bhagawan Shikhi pincha mouli, Yath pada kalpa tharu pallava sekhareshu, Leela swayamvara rasam labhathe jaya sri.., 1-1\n\nVictory to my Guru Somagiri, who is like a gem of thought,\n\nVictory to my Lord, who wears a peacock feather,\n\nFor he who wears his feet, which are like the leaves of wish giving tree,\n\nWould certainly be, sought, after by the goddess Vijayalakshmi.\n\nAsthi swastharuni karagra vigalal, Kalpa prasoonaplutham, Vasthu prasthutha venu nadha lahari, Nirvana nirvyakulam, Srastha srastha nirudhanee vivilasad, Gopee sahasravrutham, Hastha nyastha nathapa varga makhilom,Daram kisorakruthi.., 1-2\n\nThere exists in the epics, a form of a child,\n\nWhich is drowned, in the kalpaka flowers,\n\nFalling from the tender hands of deva maidens,\n\nWhich is drowned, in the ever lasting\n\nAnd still joy of the thousands of,\n\nGopis whose dress is slipping often,\n\nAnd which is always ready to give,\n\nGifts of salvation,to those who salute it.\n\nChathuryaika nidhana seema chapala- Panga cchata mandharam, Lavanyamruthaveechi lalitha drusam, Lakshmi kadaksha drutham, Kalindhee pulinangana pranayinam, Kama vatharanguram, Balam neela mami vayam madhurima, Swa rajya maaradh numa.., 1-3\n\nI worship that sweet child with blue colour,\n\nWho is the boundary of cleverness,\n\nWho is source of very temporal glances,\n\nWho has pretty eyes nurtured by the waves,\n\nOf the nectar like sea of prettiness,\n\nWho is honoured by the side long glances of Lakshmi,\n\nWho is interested in playing by the sandy shores of river Yamuna,\n\nAnd who begot a son who was the God of love.\n\nBarhothamsa vilasi kunthalabharam, Madhurya mgnaananam, Pronmeelanna youvanam pravilasa Dwenu pranadhamrutham, Aapeena sthana kudmalabhirabhitho, Gopibhir aaradhitham, Jyothischedasi naschakasmi jagathaa, Mekabhi ramadhbutham.., 1-4\n\nMy mind is illuminated by the pretty wonderful light form,\n\nWhose shining hair is decorated by peacock feathers,\n\nWho has a face which is ebbing with sweetness,\n\nWho shines with the new youthfulness,\n\nWho plays the flute that produces the nectar like music,\n\nAnd who is surrounded and worshipped by Gopis,\n\nHaving slightly thick breast tips.\n\nMadhura thara smithamrutha vimgdha mukhambhuruham, Madha shikhi pincha lanchitha manogna kacha prachayam, Vishaya vishamisha grasana gradhnu nichethasi may, Vipula vilochanam kimapi dhama chakasthu chiram.., 1-5\n\nLet my mind be lit by that which has broad eyes and is beyond words and sight,\n\nWhich has lotus like face, shining with the very sweet nectar like smile,\n\nWhich is decorated, by the feather of a peacock, with the great zest,\n\nWhich has the very prettily made up bundle of hair,\n\nAnd which wants to eat the piece of meat of pleasures of the world,\n\nMukulay manana nayanambhujam vibho, Murali ninadha makaranda nirbharam, Mukuraya mana mrudhu ganda mandalam, Mukha pankajam manasi may vijrumbhathaam.., 1-6\n\nLet the lotus like face of my Lord Krishna,\n\nWhich has two eyes, similar to the lotus buds,\n\nWhich is full of the honey from, the pollen of the music from his flute,\n\nAnd which has clear cheeks shining like glass,\n\nShine completely in my mind.\n\nKamaneeya kisora mugdha moorthe, Kala venu kwanithaa druthan anandho, Mama vachi vijrumbathaam murare, Mmaudhurimna kanikaapi kaapi kaapi.., 1-7\n\nOh God,with the attractive pretty form of a child,\n\nOh god,whose face wears the very sweet sound of flute,\n\nPlease make at least a small part of your innate sweetness,\n\nDescend and shine in my words.\n\nMadha shikhandi shikhanda vibhooshanam, Madana mandha mugdha mukhambujam, Vraja vadhoo nayananchala vanchitham, Vijayatham mama vang maya jevitham.., 1-8\n\nPallavaruna pani pankaja sangi venu rava kulam.
