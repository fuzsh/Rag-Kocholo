        "text": "Venky was born to Dr. D. Ramanaidu and Rajeshwari in Karamchedu, a village of Prakasam District, A.P. He has an elder brother, D. Suresh Babu, who runs one of the most prestigious banners in Telugu Cinema, Suresh Productions and a younger sister, Lakshmi. Venkatesh did his schooling in Don Bosco, Egmore, Chennai, Graduated in B.Com from the Loyola College in Chennai and done Masters in MBA from the Monterey Institute of International Studies, USA\n\nAfter his return to India, he wanted to get into production but, became an actor in Telugu films.\n\nVenky is married to Neeraja and they have four children. A son named Arjun Ramnath and three daughters, Aashritha, Havyavahini and Bhavana. His Ex brother-in-law is Akkineni Nagarjuna who divorced his sister Lakshmi. His nephew Rana Daggubati, son of popular producer D. Suresh Babu is also a movie star. Venky being a die hard fan of cricket makes sure that he doesnt miss the live experience of the match, supports his home team Deccan Chargers (Hyderabad) in the Indian Premier League.\n\nAs per the \"Padutha Teeyaga - ETV Grand Reality Show - 5th April 2010\" show, D. Suresh Babu (brother of Venkatesh) said that Venkatesh has acted as \"Chinna Satyanarayana\" in Premnagar movie. Never revealed earlier.\n\nVenkatesh debuted through Kaliyuga Pandavulu in the year 1986. The movie was not only a hit but also got him his first Nandi award, which is a rare accomplishment for an actor who has just completed his debut film. At an early phase in his career, Venkatesh acted in Swarnakamalam directed by K Viswanath, which got him his second Nandi award. Bobbili Raja with the delightful Divya Bharti, was a big comedy and a musical hit. Venkatesh has also worked with Bollywood director Ram Gopal Varma in the film Kshana Kshanam. In 1991, Chanti, a family drama, was a box office hit that got him a huge fan following among women in both Telugu and Hindi films. Having donned a variety of characters from that of a lover boy in Premichukondam Raa to the dual role of a father and son in Suryavamsam and that of an intense and socially conscious journalist in Ganesh, Venkatesh has been able to get kudos both from the classes and masses. He also has a natural streak of comedy in him, which revels his admirers ranging from puny little kids to adoring adolescents and appreciating adults. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his commitment towards his work and uncompromising audacity in venturing into the risky and the slippery plots that catapulted him to the abode he now occupies among the all time greats. He is well known for his down to earth nature and probably the only actor who is not involved in any conflicts.\n\nFrom the regular masala movies to meaningful roles in other commercials, Venky has come a long way. Today he is one actor who is in the top bracket in Telugu cinema Take his films, Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu, Pavithra Bandham apart from of course the award winning films Dharma Chakram, Ganesh, they are without the gimmicks or fiery fights. We don't see the angry young man as he was known earlier, but as a man next door. And the trend continued with block busters such as Premichukondam Raa, Premante Idera, Raja, Jayam Manade Raa and Kalisundam Raa which is the biggest hit in 70 years of Telugu Cinema. His recent films, Adavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule and Tulasi were big hits. Last year he teamed up with his friend Kamal Haasan and acted in a movie called Eenadu, which got released in September 2009. His latest movie is Namo Venkatesa directed by Sreenu Vytla was released as a pongal special and celebrated its grand 100 days function on 26th April, being 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s first 100 days film. Venki is doing a very special role in Kamal Haasan starrer film Marmayogi, which is expected to release soon and also promised to do a straight Tamil language movie in the future. Recently, he has given a nod to act in a film to be directed by P.Vasu, which is to be a reamake of Aptharakshaka, a kannada film, a sequel to the 2005 blockbuster film Chandramukhi and regular shooting will starts from next month May 12th onwards.\n\nHe won 7 Nandi awards, 4 Filmfare awards and many others awards as best actor for playing a variety of challenging roles in his career spanning 64 feature films in 23 years. His brother D. Suresh Babu, a very successful producer, has produced most of his hit films. He is riding high on the crest of success both as an artiste of caliber and as a box-office. Probably he is the only actor in telugu film industry who has a success rate of more than 70%.\n\nVENKATESH FILMOGRAPHY:\n\n* Kaliyuga Pandavulu\n\n* Premante Idera\n\n* Raja\n\n* Seenu\n\n* Brahma Rudrulu\n\n* Ajeyudu\n\n* Bharatamlo Arjunudu\n\n* Trimurthulu\n\n* Vijetha Vikram\n\n* Sreenivasa Kalyanam\n\n* Raktha Tilakam\n\n* Brahma Putrudu\n\n* Swarna Kamalam\n\n* Varasudochadu\n\n* Prema\n\n* Ontari Poratam\n\n* Dhruva Naksthram\n\n* Two Town Rowdy\n\n* Aggi Ramudu\n\n* Bobbili Raja\n\n* Shatruvu\n\n* Kooli No1\n\n* Surya IPS\n\n* Kshana Kshanam\n\n* Chanti\n\n* Chinarayudu\n\n* Sundarakanda\n\n* Anari (Hindi)\n\n* Kondapalli Raja\n\n* Abbaigaru\n\n* Super Police\n\n* Muddula Priyudu\n\n* Pokiri Raja\n\n* Takdheervala(Hindi)\n\n* Dharma Chakram\n\n* Sahasa Veerudu Sagara Kanya\n\n* Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu\n\n* Sarada Bullodu\n\n* Pavithra Bhandam\n\n* Chinnabbai\n\n* Premichukondam Raa\n\n* Pellichesukondam\n\n* Surya Vamsam\n\n* Ganesh\n\n* Kalisundahm Raa\n\n* Jayam Manadera\n\n* Devi Putrudu\n\n* Prematho Raa\n\n* Nuvvu Naku Nachavu\n\n* Vasu\n\n* Gemini\n\n* Vasamtham\n\n* Malliswari\n\n* Garshana\n\n* Sankranthi\n\n* SubashChandraBose\n\n* Lakshmi\n\n* Adavari matalaku ardhale verule\n\n* Tulasi\n\nFirst Nandi : Award for Kaliyuga Pandavulu in 86"
