        "text": "Since 2009, actress Prema (Venkatesh’s heroine in ‘Dharma Chakram) is absent from South Film Industry. Now she is making a comeback to movies through a Kannada remake of a blockbuster hit film from Telugu.\n\nAlso Read – Why Kanguva Trailer Is Misleading?\n\nPrema is going to essay the role Ramya Krishna essayed alongside Nagarjuna in ‘Soggade Chinni Nayana’. Nag’s film is being remade in Kannada as ‘Matte Hutti Baa, Inti Prema’ starring Upendra as the male lead playing dual roles Nagarjuna essayed in the original.\n\nUpendra had been Prema’s co-star 17 years ago in film titled ‘Upendra’ in 1999. It’s not the only film she did with Upendra. Once again their pairing is considered to look fresh. At present Upendra is busy with another remake into Kannada (Oh My God! from Hindi). More details are awaited very soon."
