        "text": "Sobhanbabu, one of the senior Telugu film artistes, quietly disappeared from the Telugu film industry. Though some of his contemporaries are still making their presence in films, Sobhanbabu voluntarily opted to stay away from the film industry. Not only in films, he is keeping himself off from any functions or festivals related to the film industry like audio releases, film releases or Nandi award kind of prestigious dos.\n\nSobhanbabu's real name is Uppu Shobana Chalapathy Rao. His date of birth is January 14, 1937. He is the son of Uppu Suryanarayana Rao. He has three sisters Dhanaranga, Jhansi and Nirmala, besides a brother Sambasiva Rao.\n\nHe had completed his schooling in Kuntamukkula Mylavaram. He pursued his Intermediate in Vijayawada and finished his degree in Vijayawada. Later, he joined law course in Madras, but discontinued it.\n\nHe got married to Kanta Kumari on May 15, 1958. He has a son Karuna Seshu and three daughters Mrudula, Prashanti and Nivedita.\n\nThough he was in the glamour field, he did not allow either his sons, daughters, brothers or sisters into the film industry.\n\nHe made his debut into films through Daivabalam directed by Vasanthkumar Reddy, but the first film that hit the screen is Bhakta Sabari and his first crush is with L Vijayalakshmi. Chitrapu Narayana Murthy is his first director, while BD Naidu was the first producer. It is Pendyala Nageswara Rao who gave music for his first ever film. His film Manushulu Maarali was run for 25 weeks which was a recording during those days. By the time Sobhanbabu entered, it was black and white era. His first colour film is Kannavari Kalalu. For the first time he went abroad for a film shooting for Ramudu-Parasuramudu. He made a dual role in Potti Pleader for the first time.\n\nDuring those days Sobhanbabu is the only stylish star. Even if he wears a T-shirt or if he wears a suit, it is perfect fit for him. It is Sobhanbabu who used to wear goggles in song sequences and it is worth watching on screen. He had received Filmfare Awards for four times, Nandi awards for five times, AP Cine Goers Award for eight times of which he bagged the award consecutively for six years from 1970 to 1975. Likewise he had bagged Madras Film Fans award for nine times. Vamsi Berkely Award, AP Film Fans Award, Andhra Patrika Award, Film World Award were only a few to mention. He bagged the Central Govt award for the best classical film hero for Bangaru Panjaram in 1970. Filmalaya, Cine World, Cine Express, Kalasagar, and Kalasravanthi were few more awards that came in his way.\n\nSobhanbabu had paired up with Sarada for several films and they were said to be a hit pair of all times. It is really a unique combination. Sobhanbabu is known for his glamour and performance for about 30 years in the filmdom and Sarada is known more for her outstanding, performance-oriented roles, especially for sober roles.\n\nHe was popularly called as \"Andhra Andagadu\" meaning, \"Most handsome person in Andhra Pradesh\". He was honored several Nandi Awards by the state of Andhra Pradesh Government. He probably earned maximum number of awards among any Telugu hero for his diverse roles spanning over 30 years. He was the most popular ladies hero for over 20 years. In fact, he earned so much ladies popularity that even to this day any good ladies family entertainer is referred to as \"Shoban Babu type movie\" by the telugu movie lovers. He was honored \"Natabooshana\" title and it became his last name in movie credits.\n\nThough several senior artistes had lost their earnings either by producing films or in some other way, Sobhanbabu had a planned career. He invested all his earnings in real estate business and is leading a peaceful life with a complete happy family with sons, daughters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law and grandchildren. He acted in films that suits his age all the times. At the fag end of his career, he chose some character artiste roles and finally took retirement from films for a happy and fruitful life. He celebrated his 70th birthday on January 14, 2007.\n\nActor:\n\nAasthi Mooredu Asha Baaredu\n\nAbhimanyudu\n\nAdavi Raja\n\nAdavidora\n\nAgni Nakshatram\n\nAlludugaru Zindabad\n\nAmma Maata\n\nAndaroo Manchivaare\n\nAndharoo Dongale (1974)\n\nAnna Chellellu\n\nAshwametham\n\nBabu\n\nBalaramakrishnulu\n\nBalidaanam\n\nBalipeetham\n\nBandhalu Anubandhalu\n\nBandham\n\nBangaru Chellelu\n\nBangaru Panjaram\n\nBangaru Thalli\n\nBavamaradallu\n\nBhakta Pothana\n\nBhakta Sabari\n\nBhale Gudhachari\n\nBharya\n\nBharyaabhartalu\n\nBharyamani\n\nBheeshma\n\nBuddhimanthudu\n\nChaduvkunna Ammaayilu\n\nChakkanodu\n\nChakravaakam\n\nChandipriya\n\nChattamto Chadarangam\n\nChelleli Kapuram\n\nChesina Baasalu\n\nChinnanati Snehithulu\n\nDaivabalam\n\nDanavudu\n\nDandayathra\n\nDebbaku Thaa Dongala Muthaa\n\nDeepaaradhana\n\nDesadrohulu\n\nDesamante Manusuhuloi\n\nDevalayam\n\nDevudu Chesina Pelli\n\nDevudu Mamayya\n\nDharma Chakram (1980)\n\nDharma Peetam Daddarillindi\n\nDoctor Babu\n\nDonga Pelli\n\nDorababu\n\nDoragarintlo Dongodu\n\nDorikithe Dongalu\n\nDoshi Nirdoshi\n\nDriver Babu\n\nEetaram Manishi\n\nEnki Naayudu Bava\n\nEnki Nayudubava\n\nEvandi Aavida Vachindi\n\nGadusu Pillodu\n\nGanga Manga\n\nGharana Gangulu\n\nGorintaku\n\nGudhachari 116\n\nGunavanthudu\n\nHello Guru\n\nIda Lokam\n\nIddaru Ammaayilu\n\nIddaru Dongalu\n\nIddaru Iddare (1976)\n\nIllalu Priyuralu\n\nInti Gauravam\n\nIrugu Porugu\n\nJackie\n\nJagajjantreelu\n\nJagajjatteelu\n\nJagan (1984)\n\nJailu Pakshi\n\nJebu Donga (1975)\n\nJeevana Jyothi\n\nJeevana Poraatam\n\nJeevana Raagam\n\nJeevana Tharangalu\n\nJeevita Bandam\n\nJeevitha Khaidi\n\nJeevitha Nauka\n\nJeevitham\n\nJeevitharatham\n\nKaalaanthakulu\n\nKaalam Maarindi\n\nKaksha\n\nKalisina Manasulu\n\nKalyana Mandapam\n\nKalyana Tamboolam\n\nKambhojaraju Katha\n\nKannathalli\n\nKannavaari Kalalu\n\nKanula Panduga\n\nKartheeka Deepam\n\nKartheeka Pournami\n\nKathanayarakuralu\n\nKhaidi Babai\n\nKhaidi Kalidas\n\nKhiladi Bullodu\n\nKodallosthunnaru Jagrattha\n\nKodenagu\n\nKodetraachu\n\nKongumudi\n\nKoothuru Kodalu\n\nKorukunna Mogudu\n\nKrishnarjunulu (1982)\n\nKumkumabharini\n\nKurukshetram\n\nLakshmi Nivasam\n\nLava Kusa\n\nLoguttu Perumallakeruka\n\nMaa Manchi Akkayya\n\nMaatru Devatha\n\nMaayani Mamata\n\nMahalakshmi\n\nMaharaju\n\nMahasangraamam\n\nMairaavana\n\nMalle Poolu\n\nMallepuvvu\n\nMana Samsaram\n\nManavude Mahaneeyudu\n\nManavudu Danavudu (1972)\n\nManchi Babai\n\nManchi Manasulu (1974)\n\nManchi Mithrulu\n\nMande Gundelu\n\nMangalya Bhalam (1985)\n\nManushulu Maarali\n\nMister Bharath\n\nMister Vijay\n\nMonagadu (1976)\n\nMooga Prema\n\nMosagadu\n\nMugguru Mitrulu\n\nMugguru Monagaallu\n\nMundadugu\n\nNaa Thammudu\n\nNaidu Baava\n\nNarthanasaala\n\nNavagraha Poojaa Mahima\n\nNindu Hrudayalu\n\nNindu Manishi\n\nPandanti Jeevitham\n\nPanthaalu Pattimpulu\n\nParamanandayya Sishyula Katha\n\nParuvu Prathishta\n\nPasidi Manasulu\n\nPedda Koduku\n\nPettamdaarlu\n\nPicchi Maaraaju\n\nPinni\n\nPogarubothu\n\nPotti Pleader\n\nPrameelarjuna Yuddham\n\nPratheekaram\n\nPratijnaa Paalana\n\nPremabandham\n\nPrivate Master\n\nPunnami Chandrudu\n\nPunya Dampathulu\n\nPunyam koddu purushudu\n\nPunyavathi\n\nPuttinillu Mettinillu\n\nRaamalayam\n\nRadha Krishna\n\nRaghuramudu\n\nRaja (1976)\n\nRajkumar\n\nRaju Vedale\n\nRakta Sindooram\n\nRamabaanam\n\nRamalayam\n\nRamudu Parasuramudu\n\nSaanthi Nilayam\n\nSampoorna Ramayanam\n\nSamsaram (1988)\n\nSannaayi Appanna\n\nSarada\n\nSarpayaagam\n\nSathyame Jayam\n\nSati Anasuya\n\nSattekalapu Satayya\n\nSisindri Chittibabu\n\nSoggadi Kaapuram\n\nSoggadu (1975)\n\nSomavaara Vrata Maahaatyam\n\nSravana Sandhya\n\nSreekrishnaavataaram\n\nSri Krishna Pandaveeyam\n\nSri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna\n\nSrivaru\n\nSumangali\n\nSwayamvaram (1982)\n\nTaaraasashankam\n\nTahsildar Gaari Ammaayi\n\nTallidandrulu (1970)\n\nThalli Koothullu\n\nThodu Needa\n\nUmmadi Mogudu\n\nVamsodharakudu (1972)\n\nVeeraanjaneya\n\nVeerabhimanya\n\nVichitra Dampathyam\n\nVichitra Kutumbam\n\nVijrumbhana\n\nVooriki Soggadu\n\nAwards:\n\nFilm fare Awards: 1971, 74, 76, 79\n\nNandi Best Actor Award from AP Govt : 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1976\n\nAP Cinegoers Award : 1970, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 85, 89,\n\nMadras Film Fans Award : 1971, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 84, 85\n\nVamsi Berkely Award : 1978, 84, 85\n\nAP Film Fans Award : 1971, 1974\n\nAndhrapatrika Award : 1970, 1985\n\nFilm World : 1971, 1975\n\nCentral Govt Award for the best classical film hero award : Bangaru Panjaram 1970\n\nFilmalaya : 1975\n\nCine World : 1975\n\nKalasagar : 1975 1986\n\nKalasravanthi : 1992"
