        "text": "Born into a farmer's family, Rama Rao Taraka Nandamuri got his bachelors of arts degree and took a job with the government. Married to Nandamuri Basavatarakam, he began acting in films, his first being Mana Desam (1949), in which he played a police officer. His first movie as a hero was Palletoori Pilla (1950), which was a huge hit. His subsequent movies--Showkar (1950), Pathala Bhairavi (1951), Malliswari (1951) and Chandraharam (1953)--established him as the premier hero in the Telugu film industry. He acted in a mythological role as Lord Krishna for the first time in Maya Bazaar (1957) and acted in most of the major roles in \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharatam\", even in Tamil films. He acted in a total of 254 films, including some Tamil and Hindi films. He suffered some career reversals in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but came back with a bang in the late 1970s with some major hits like Adavi Ramudu (1977), Yamagola (1977), Vetagadu (1979). Some of his major hits in the early 1980s include Sardar Papa Rayudu (1980), Bobbili Puli (1982), Kondaveeti Simham (1981). He became the first superstar of the Telugu films a position which was held by Chiranjeevi till around 2001. An intensely emotional person, he also directed films, built a studio and produced films. He established the TeluguDesam party in 1982 and within a year became the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. He was an avid advocate of Telugu Pride and made sure his native state. He married Lakshmi Parvathi in 1993. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1994, but was ousted from power by an internal party coup in which his son-in-law and the present Chief Minister, Mr. Chandrababu Naidu, took over in 1995. He died less than six months later, in 1996 because of heart attack. His son Nandamuri Balakrishna is a famous actor in Telugu films. He is survived by six sons and three daughters.\n\nThis Telugu Star was a student at the Madras Film Institute and an amateur stage actor. His first public performance was in the Republic Day parade ballet of Andra Pradesh on 26 January, 1976. His film debut was Punadhirallu (1978). His brother-in-law is producer Allu Aravind. His success started with Initilo Ramayya Vidhilo Krishnayya (1981). He is known for his extraordinary dances and fights apart from his power packed performances in movies. His movies carry a reputation of being the best entertainers along with carrying a social message across to the audience. He has done a couple of Hindi movies as well viz., Pratibandh (1990), Aaj ka Gunda Raaj etc and was well recognized for them too.\n\nHe is one of the highest paid actors in India today and commands an extraordinarily huge (and cult-like) fan following not only in Andra Pradesh, his native state but all over India and other countries as well. His films are released in US, Europe and Asia Pacific.\n\nApart from movies, he is also widely known for his philanthropy. He set up a Chiranjeevi Trust for Eye and Blood donations and his fans take an active part in it.\n\nHe was awarded the 'Padmabhushan' recently along with a 'Doctorate'.\n\nKamal Haasan was born November 7, 1954 in Paramakudi, Ramanathapuram District, Tamil Nadu. He debuted as a child artiste in the film \"Kalathoor Kannamma\" (1960). Since then, he has starred in nearly 220 films in the major Indian languages - Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi. He has been a part of the film industry for 60 years, as of 2020. His journey in cinema has seen him do various roles - from child artiste, to romantic lead to one of the most respected and revered heroes of the film industry today.\n\nHe has famously said that he is a reluctant actor. He has an avid interest in every aspect of film making and is known for his work as a choreographer, director, and writer, as well.\n\nHe wrote his first script at age 18 for the film \"Unarchigal\" (1976), which was then followed by films that have gone on to become cult classics - Rajapaarvai (1981), Sathya (1988), Apoorva Sahotharargal (1989), Thevar Magan (1992), Mahanadi (1994), Kurudhippunal (1995), Avvai Shanmugi (1996), Hey Ram (2000), Pammal K Sambandam (2002), Panchathanthiram (2002), Anbe Sivam (2003), are a few of the films etched in popular memory for having set the bar for craftsmanship in the fields of screenplay, script, and dialogue.\n\nHe is also a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction in Tamil and his published work is testament to his constant exploration of structure and form.\n\nKamal Haasan's strong convictions in his art have led to some of Indian cinema's most path-breaking films like Pushpak / Pushpaka Vimaanam / Pesum Padam (1987). Kamal Haasan also worked as a choreographer while transitioning as a well-known child artiste to the lead actor in a feature length film. Some of his best-known work as a dancer can be seen in Saagara Sangamam (1983) and the popular hit Punnagai Mannan (1986).\n\nKamal Haasan is also a student of Carnatic music, studying under musical maestro Dr. Balamuralikrishna. One of his biggest hits as a playback singer was the song \"Inji Iduppazhagi\" for the film Thevar Magan.\n\nHis career as a director began with the film Chachi 420 (1997), the Hindi remake of Avvai Shanmugi. Since then he has called the shots for critically acclaimed films like \"Hey Ram\" and \"Virumaandi\".\n\nHe has never hesitated to state his opinions and encourage debate about topics that are socially relevant. He is a rationalist in thought and moderate in opinion and a humanist in philosophy. The need to be socially conscious is seen in the way his fan clubs have revamped themselves into entities that carry out charity and volunteer work.\n\nKrishna was born to Veeraraghavayya Chowdhary and Nagaratnamma Ghattamaneni in a remote village called Burripallem, near Tenali in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India. He was the eldest of the five children from a middle income agrarian family. He could not afford to have convent education, so he attended the school in his village to get his primary education before moving to Tenali and Narsapur to do his S.S.C and Intermediate. Impressed by his scholastic achievements, his father raised money to send his son to the prestigious C.R.R. college in Eluru. There, he shared a room with two aspiring actors, Shoban Babu and Murali Mohan, who later became stars in their own right. Krishna played an active role in various cultural events organized by his college. His performance in the play \"Cheesina Paapam Kaasiki Velleena\" brought him critical acclaim, thus encouraging him to pursue acting more seriously. After he graduated from college, he married Indira Devi on November 1, 1962. She provided him emotional support during his salad days. In 1965, she gave birth to their first child Ramesh Babu Ghattamaneni about the same time when Krishna made his feature film debut with \"Tenemanasulu\", which became a big hit and made him an overnight star. He soon developed a reputation as a trend-setter by starring in the first Telugu detective film \"Gudachari 116.\" He was the hero of the first Telugu cowboy film in \"Mosagallkau Mosagadu.\" He played a James Bond type in \"Agent Gopi\" and became known as \"Andhra James Bond\" during that time. He also starred in \"Alluri Sitarama Raju,\" which is the first color scope film. He later starred in the first 70 MM film that he also produced and directed titled \"Simhasanam.\" \"Simhasanam\" was the first of 17 feature films he directed.\n\nIn 1968, Krishna's daughter Padmavathi was born. In 1969, Krishna married his frequent leading lady Vijaya Nirmala and this created fodder for the gossip columns as they were still married to their respective spouses with children. Krishna continues to be married to his first wife Indira Devi and would have three more children with her: Manjula Ghattamaneni in 1970, Mahesh Babu in 1975, and Priyadarshini in 1979. He never had children with Vijaya Nirmala but he apparently raised her son Naresh from her first marriage as his own. He also supported Vijaya Nirmala's directorial aspirations by starring in the films she directed and was later proud when she made the Guinness Book of Records as the most prolific female director in 2002. Krishna established the prestigious \"Padmalaya Studios\" with his brothers in 1983 and has won respect for donning several hats as actor, producer, director, distributor and exhibitor. He also acted in many political targeted movies. During Rajiv Gandhi times, he was inclined towards Congress and even won from the Eluru constituency. After the death of Rajiv Gandhi, Krishna quit politics and has continued to be involved in films and supporting his son Mahesh Babu's success as an actor.\n\nMohan Babu, christened Bhaktavatsalam Naidu by his parents, is known throughout the Indian continent for his film work on and off screen. As a child he was more interested in the stage than in schoolwork, appearing regularly in school plays from the age of 14.\n\nHis father was a head teacher and was keen for his son to follow an academic career. However, after graduating, he left home for Madras where he worked in the YMCA College of Physical Education as an instructor, eventually entering the film industry in the mid 70s as an assistant director.\n\nAfter some years in the industry, Mohan Babu was keen to move from directing to acting, but had no luck until he met his guru Dr. Dasari Narayana Rao, who rechristened him Mohan Babu. His first break was in the film Swargam Narakam (1975) directed by Dr. Dasari in 1975.\n\nTo the present day, Mohan Babu has made 502 films in the 25 years since he began working in the industry, 80 of them featuring him as lead male, and including a dual role in Peda Rayudu (1995). Sivaji Ganesan initiated him into Tamil films, and to date he has 20 Tamil films to his credit.\n\nHe produced his first hit film Prathigna (1983) in 1982, and in all has produced more than 30 films to date, including \"Major Chandrakanth\" which was a tribute to the late actor Dr. N.T.
