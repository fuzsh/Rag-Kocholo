        "text": "ABOUT Birth name Daggubati Venkatesh Born December 13, 1960 (age 46) Karamchedu, India Spouse(s) Neeraja BRIEF Daggubati Venkatesh (Telugu: దగ్గుబాటి వెంకటేష్) (born on December 13, 1960) is an Indian film actor who stars in Tollywood films. He is the son of Telugu veteran producer D. Rama Naidu. He is popularly known as Victory Venkatesh in Tollywood. BACKGROUND Venkatesh graduated with an MBA degree from Monterey Institute of International Studies, USA. After his return to India, he wanted to get into production. He became an actor in telugu films. His father, D. Rama Naidu and his brother D.Suresh Babu successfully runs one of the most prestigious banners in Telugu Cinema, Suresh Productions. He is married to Neeraja and has a son Arjun Ramnath(6) and three daughters, Ashritha(19), Hayavahini(14) and Bhavana(. CAREER Venkatesh debuted through Kaliyuga Pandavulu in the year 1986. The movie was not only a hit but also got him his first Nandi award, which is a rare accomplishment for an actor who has just completed his debut film. At an early phase of his career, Venkatesh got to work with Kasinadhuni Viswanath, who is considered a great classical director. Just two years old as an actor, Venkatesh acted in Swarnakamalam directed by Kasinadhuni Viswanath. The movie got him his second Nandi. Varasudochadu, released in the same year, was another trophy. After a few flops, he got a break in the form of Bobbili Raja. Added to the name and performance of Venkatesh was delightful Divya Bharati, good comedy and melodious music. Bobbili Raja was a musical hit and also entertained audience from all sections because of it's ingredients. In Shathruvu, Venkatesh played angry young lawyer who takes law into his hands after failing to fight the corruption through the court. Venkatesh has also worked with famed Bollywood director (originally Telugu) Ram Gopal Varma in the film Kshana Kshanam, although it was not a success at the box office. Chanti, a remake of Tamil movie Chinna Tambi, happened in 1991. Chanti was definitely a challenging project for Venkatesh. Chanti was a box office hit and Venkatesh's career benefitted hugely by it. Starting with Chanti, he went for continuous remakes - that got him branded as a \"remake actor\". Anari was the remake of Chanti in Bollywood's Hindi cinema. Venkatesh started becoming a family hero and turned out a huge fan following among women. His last release was Lakshmi, which was a big hit.
