        "text": "Actor:-Super Star RajiniKanth\n\nBiography:-\n\nRajinikanth (Kannada,Marathi,Tamil,Telugu) (born Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, December 12,1949) is one of the most influential and bankable movie stars in the Indian film industry and is a superstar in Kollywood. He received India's third highest honour, the Padma Bhushan, for his contribution to Indian cinema in 2000.He was reportedly paid Rs. 25 crores (about USD 6.25 Million) for his latest blockbuster Sivaji, which would make him the highest paid actor in all of India if all the other publicly available compensation figures for other high profile Indian stars are accurate.\n\nRajinikanth was born to a Maratha family in Karnataka. By birth he admired Kannada Film star Rajkumar.He was the fourth child of his parents, Jijabai and Ramojirao Gaekwad.He was named Shivajirao Gaekwad. Gaekwad is a family name among the Marathas. He lost his mother at the age of five. He did his schooling at the Acharya Paatashala in Bangalore and then at the Vivekananda Balaka Sangha. Rajinikanth struggled a lot during his early age because of poverty. Although his mother-tongue is Marathi,he has not acted in any Marathi movies yet. He began his career doing various jobs in Bangalore. He also attended a theatre for stage plays. Before starting his career in the film industry, he worked as a bus conductor for the Bangalore Transport Service in Bangalore.It was during this time that he nurtured his acting interests by performing in various stage plays.\n\nHe married Latha on February 26, 1981, at the age of 31 in Tirumala - Tirupati and they have two children: Aishwariya and Soundarya. Latha currently runs a school named The Ashram.\n\nHis elder daughter Aishwariya married actor Dhanush on November 18, 2004 and they have one son, Yathra.\n\nIs he merely a mega star? People unfamiliar with the intricate ways Tamil films, its popularity and its sway over politics would wonder.\n\nSuch is his clout over the Tamilians all over the world that many of them are more than happy to sacrifice their life for their hero of reel life! One would, for one’s intellectual boorishness, tend to dismiss it as classic case of hyper-emotions. But that is disdainful to meteoric rise of a bus conductor to super stardom and his unparalleled charisma, unrivalled mannerism, unmatched talents and uncanny knack of stirring the sentiments of millions. He is Shivajirav Gaikwad alias Rajnikant. The living legend of Tamil films.\n\nAn insightful film critic since childhood, Rajnikant also learned the finer nuances of cinema from Madras film institute. Though Katha Sangama was his debut film, it was Apoorva Ragaangal, directed by K Balachander, which brought him into limelight. He admits that K Balachander is his mentor as it was under his tutelage that he flourished as an actor.\n\nA veteran of more than 150 films, Rajni, as he is popularly known, may not be a critics’ choice. But he essentially is mass’ choice. He may not match the histrionics of some of his contemporaries. But none of his contemporaries matches his superlative style of acting and action. His flipping a cigarette before he catches it in his mouth would send the masses in hysteric delight. He has an uncanny knack of delivering the dialogues, which are carefully worded to strike straight at souls of masses. Perhaps none in Indian cinema matches his acumen to reach out to the masses through dialogues and actions. No wonder he enjoys a peerless position not only in Indian cinema but in socio-cultural and political realm of Tamil Nadu as well.\n\nOver the years he has outgrown the status of mega star. The phenomenal success of his latest flicks Bhasha, Muthu, Arunachalam, Padayappa, underlines that fact. In Mani Ratnam-directed Dalapati, he gave a fitting reply to those critics who doubted his range of histrionics.\n\nRajni is one of the few south Indian heroes who successfully crossed over to the North. Andha Kannon , Giraftarr, Chal Baaz , Gangwa etc speak for his success in Bollywood.\n\nOf late, his stock of actions and idiosyncrasies has been a huge success abroad too. That his latest film Padayappa was sold to a Japanese distributor for a mind-boggling sum of 50,000$ is testimony to his popularity in Japan. This amount is termed to be highest amount any Indian film fetched for a commercial release.\n\nHe is rare phenomenon in terms of commercial success of films. Even Amitabh Bachchan, the super star of Indian cinema, has given flops. But Rajni’s films never flop in box-office. What is the secret of his enviable success? Critics attribute his success to his mysterious ability (whatever may be the role he enacts on the screen) to identify with the common folk.\n\nIn 1999, Rajni completed 25 years in cinema. The Government of Indian in recognition of his outstanding contribution conferred on him Padmabhushan the same year.\n\nRajinikanth's first film was in Tamil cinema, where he was initially cast in supporting roles, debuting as a cancer patient in Apoorva Raagangal in 1975.The film was directed by K. Balachander, who is constantly referred to by Rajinikanth as his own guru or mentor. The following year, Rajinikanth acted in his first Kannada film, Katha Sangama, directed by Puttanna Kanagal. Though Rajinikanth refers to director K. Balachander as his \"guru\" or mentor, it was director S. P. Muthuraman who actually revamped Rajinikanth’s image entirely. Muthuraman first experimented with him in a positive role in Bhuvana Oru Kelvikkuri (1977), as a villain in the first half and a do-gooder in the second, accepting a woman with a child abandoned by her lover. Around this time Mullum Malarum (1978), directed by J. Mahendran, established Rajinikanth in the Tamil film arena. The success of Bhuvana Oru Kelvikkuri prompted Muthuraman to make a mushy melodrama with Rajinikanth as a hero sacrificing everything for his siblings in Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai (1979). These films were the turning points in Rajinikanth’s career — he changed from an actor who merely enthralled the audiences, to one who could also make them cry. The acceptance of Rajinikanth sans his mannerisms proved he had at last become a \"star\" from a \"common actor.\" His film roles were mainly as a villain during the period 1975 to 1977, frequently with Kamal Haasan as the hero, in movies like Pathinaaru Vayadhinilae , Moondru Mudichu and Avargal (All 1977).\n\nRajinikanth is known for philanthropic activities.\n\n* He converted his Raghavendra Marriage Hall to a charitable trust to help the needy.\n\n* He shared his income from the film \"Arunachalam\" with eight other people from the film industry as profit shares.\n\n* He is planning to construct a new hospital and a new school on a piece of land near Chennai.\n\n* He has distributed Rs 12 Lakhs as relief to the family members of the bereaved in the Coimbatore bomb blast.\n\n* He had donated Rs 21 Lakhs to Tsunami Relief Fund, Government of TamilNadu during Jan 2005 in Person as a cheque to then Chief Minister Ms. J. Jayalalitha.\n\n* Dance choreographer cum director cum actor Lawrence Raghavendra is running a home for differently abled people in Chennai where there are many residents. It has been reported by the actor that super star Rajinikanth has agreed to completely pay the food expenses of the centre. While talking to the media on this Lawrence said, “I am very thankful to Rajini sir. We all know about his generosity and benevolence but he has reiterated this by agreeing to foot the expenses of food bills of the centre irrespective of its strength.\"\n\nFilmography:-\n\nShivaji (2007) - Shivaji Arumugam\n\nChandramukhi (2005) - Dr.Saravanan (as Super Star Rajinikanth)\n\nBaba (2002)\n\nAaghaaz (2000) - Himself (a scene from a movie)\n\nBulandi (2000) - Ghajraj Thakur\n\nPadaiyappa (1999) - Padaiyappa\n\nDancing Maharaja II - Yajaman (1998)\n\nArunachalam (1997) - Arunachalam\n\nKrantikari (1997)\n\nAatank Hi Aatank (1995) - Munna (as Rajnikant)\n\nBadsha (1995) - Badsha/Manickam\n\nMuthu (1995) - Muthu\n\nPeda Rayudu (1995) - Murdered Village Chief\n\nZameen (1995)\n\nVeera (1994) - Muthuveerappan \"Veera\"\n\nEjamaan (1993)\n\nInsaniyat Ke Devta (1993) - Anwar\n\nUzhaippaali (1993)\n\nValli (1993)\n\nTyagi (1992) - Shankar G.

His father, an attorney by profession, gave all his sons (Charu Haasan, Chandra Haasan, Kamal Haasan) the suffix of \"Haasan\" as a sign of his friendship to one Mr. Haasan. Kamal is also a playback singer and sometimes pens the lyrics for the soundtracks of some of his recent films. He is an able performer of the Bharatanatyam dance form. He had assisted in choreography early in his career. He is multilingual.\n\nHe began his career as a child artist in many films, while also attending a theatre for stage plays. Kamal Haasan gained the Indian cinema's attention in his first blockbuster, \"Kalathur Kannamma\" (1960) and since then he has acted in over two hundred Indian films.\n\nHe is the only actor other than Mammooty who received three National film awards for Best Actor. Moreover, Kamal Haasan also received a National award for best performance as a child artist. Kamal Haasan along with Mammootty, Anil Kapoor, Om Puri, and Naseruddin Shah are called the Famous Five of Indian Cinema.\n\nKamal Hassan has received India's fourth highest civilian honour, the Padma Shri for his services to Indian cinema in 1990. Kamal Haasan performs predominantly in leading roles in high-budget and major studio films, ranging from romantic comedies and drama to action thrillers. His most popular films include \"Moondram Pirai\" (1982), \"Saagara Sangamam\" (1983), \"Nayagan\" (1987), \"Indian\" (1996) and \"Hey Ram\" (2000). In his currently unreleased film \"Dasavatharam\", he has attempted to portray ten different characters.\n\nIn the 1960s, Kamal made his screen debut with \"Kalathur Kannamma\" produced by AVM production at the age of six and it won him the first National Award for Best Child Artist. He followed it with appearances as a child actor in movies that featured MGR, Sivaji Ganesan, Nagesh and Gemini Ganesh.\n\nAs an actor in adult roles, he received a lukewarm response for his initial few films like \"Avargal\", \"Aval Oru Thodarkathai\", \"Solla Thaan Ninaikkiren\", \"Maanavan\" and \"Kumara Vijayam\".\n\nHis first highly popular movie was \"16 Vayathinile\" with Sridevi. This established him as a popular teen idol at the age of 23. Kamal Haasan and Sri Devi were a popular acting pair and have acted together in 23 films. The year following his appearance in \"16 Vayathinile\", Kamal Haasan acted in director K. Balachander's Telugu hit \"Maro Charithra\".In many of his late 1970s films, he was usually the hero, with Rajinikanth as the villain.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he has played a host of characters that include-a ventriloquist in Avargal (He actually learnt ventriquilism for his role in the movie),a village innocent in \"16 Vayathinile\",a disco jockey in \"Ilamai Oonjaladugiradhu\",a psychopath serial killer of women in \"Sigappu Rojakkal\",a buck-toothed villager in \"Kalyanaraman\",Aladdin in \"Alavudheenum Arpudha Vilakkum\".\n\nHis first attempt at direction came through an unfortunate turn of events with the demise of director T.N. Baalu during the filming of \"Sankarlal\" in 1981. Kamal reached stardom in 1979 with multiple classics and mass blockbusters which coincided with the decline of MGR/ Sivaji era in movies (MGR quit movies in 1977 while Sivaji, nevertheless continued to act till the 90s). A huge factor behind Kamal's success is his versatility.\n\nIn the 80s, he has played amongst other roles, :a blind violinist in \"Raja Paarvai\" at the age of 27 (first screenplay by Kamal), a classical dancer in \"Saagara Sangamam\",a mentally challenged man who falls in love in \"Swathi Muthyam\",an undercover cop in \"Kaaki Sattai\",a benevolent underworld don in \"Nayagan\" (Leader) at the age of 33 (directed by Mani Ratnam), an unemployed youth who chances upon a week of opulence in the silent movie \"Pushpak\", an honest cop, a dwarf circus clown and a fun-loving mechanic in \"Apoorva Sagodharargal\"at the age of 35 (screenplay by Kamal),a corrupt mayor in Indrudu Chandrudu, a spy in \"Vikram\", an illiterate villager in \"Sakalakala Vallavan\"\n\nApoorva Sagodharargal, which released in 1989, was the first Kamal film to gross almost Rs.25 million at the box office.\n\nIn the 1990s Kamal's second attempt at direction came through another unfortunate turn of events when the original director Shantanu Sheroey failed to do a good job while filming \"Chachi 420\" in 1997. Inspired by the European style of closer-to-reality docu-dramas, Kamal moved decisively towards making films for select classes in the 90s, isolating some of his ardent fans.\n\nIn this period, he has played as a Doctor in the Tamil comedy movie \"Sathy Leelavathy\", as quadruplets in the comedy \"Michael Madhana Kamarajan\",as an old and highly-corrupt mayor in \"Indiran Chandiran\", a mentally-challenged man in the very dark film \"Guna\",a modern youth-turned-villager in \"Thevar Magan\" at the age of 38 (written and produced by Kamal), a hapless familyman who lost and re-discovers his family in a metropolis in \"Mahanadhi\", a revolutionary lecturer in \"Nammavar\",a special police squad officer against terrorism in \"Kuruthipunal\",a righteous old revolutionary as well as his corrupt son in \"Indian\", an old nanny in \"Avvai Shanmugi\" at the age of 42.\n\nUnlike the eighties, Kamal films in the nineties lost sheen and were unsuccessful, barring \"Thevar Magan\", \"Michael Madhana Kamarajan\", \"Avvai Shanmugi\" and \"Indian\". \"Indian\" directed by Shankar which released in 1996 , grossed almost Rs.100 million at the box office marking a new peak in his career.\n\nKamal continues scripting directing and acting in his productions, and has met with considerable success at the box office.Again, he has played diverse roles in this period, which include: a Hindu fundamentalist in \"Hey Ram\",a mentally affected Sri Lankan Tamil in the comedy \"Thenali\",a pair of twins (one of which is a deranged psychopath) in \"Aalavandhan\",an ardent bachelor-stuntmaster-turned-lover in \"Pammal K. Sambandam\",a randy pilot in the comedy caper \"Panchathantiram\",a disabled altruist (Communist) in \"Anbe Sivam\",a rustic wrongly jailed for the murder of his lover in \"Virumaandi\" (directed by Kamal),a deaf circus stuntman in \"Mumbai Express\" at the age of 51,an affable mafiaman enrolled in medical school,\" Vasool Raja MBBS\" a remake of Hindi film, Munna Bai M.B.B.S,as DCP Raghavan, a smart and suave policeman with his \"Raghavan instinct\" out to trace a serial psychopath killer duo in \"Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu\".\n\n\"Thenali\" which released in 2000, was the first Kamal film to gross almost Rs.100 million at the box office. \"Vasool Raja MBBS\" and \"Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu\" mopped up over Rs.150 million and Rs.300 million each at the box office.\n\nKamal has an uncanny ability to remake Hollywood movies in Tamil. His remakes are not lift-offs. His remakes are usually inspired by Hollywood originals, but the story and screenplay are customized for Indian Audiences. The central plot/theme of the movie is from the Hollywood original, \"Nayagan\" was inspired by Godfather. \"Avvai Shanmugi\" and \"Chachi 420\" were inspired by \"Mrs. Doubtfire\". \"Anbe Sivam\" was inspired by \"Planes, Trains & Automobiles\". \"Sathi Leelavathi\" was inspired by \"She-Devil\" (film) and \"Magalir Mattum\" was inspired by \"Nine to Five\".\n\nKamal is a three-time winner of the National Film Award for Best Actor for the films \"Nayagan\", \"Moondram Pirai\" and \"Indian\". He also won the national award for Best Child Actor for his performance in \"Kalathur Kannamma\". He has also received the best actor award at the Asian Film festivals held in 1983 and 1985 for \"Saagara Sangamam\" and \"Swathi Muthyam\" respectively.\n\nSix of his movies have been sent as India's official entry to the Oscars- The only actor to achieve this feat in the sub-continent. Kamal has won the Filmfare awards 18 times. In fact, he wrote to the FILMFARE committee not to give him any more awards and that be used to encourage the upcoming and promising young actors.\n\nHe was awarded the fourth highest recognition given to Indian civilians - the Padmashri in 1990. He was conferred an honorary doctorate by Sathyabama University, Chennai in 2005. Kamal Haasan has won a total of 172 awards which is more than any other actor in the world living or dead. He was named as \"kalaignani\" - an idol of art, by M. Karunanidhi for his classical work towards Tamil cinema. In his upcoming film Dasavatharam, he plays 10 different roles, an act which is the second of its kind in the world, after the Tamil movie Navarathri (1936).\n\nKamal was also conferred with a very unique honour this year(2007) as \"Living Legend\" in the film business by FICCI,India.\n\nKamal started his foray into film production with 'Raaja Paarvai' in 1981. The film was a commercial failure, though critically well received. A more recent production was the film \"Virumaandi\" in 2004. His privately held production house Raj Kamal Films produced several classics like \"Apoorva Sagodharargal\",\" Thevar Magan\", \"Kuruthipunal\" etc. His more recent production ventures include the films \"Virumaandi\" and \"Mumbai Xpress\".\n\nHis magnum opus, \"Marudha Naayagam\", is a period film set in early 18th century Madurai about a warrior/freedom fighter Yusuf Khan Sahib or Muhammed Yusuf Khan. The film's launch was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II. However, the film is still under production or shelved due to many reasons.\n\nIn 2005, he launched a new business unit called Raj Kamal Audio in a drive to corporatise all his film commitments. In 2006, he purchased prime real estate for a state-of-the-art multiplex cinema.\n\nFilmography:-\n\nDasavatharam (2008)\n\nVetayadu Vilayadu (2006) - Raghavan\n\nMumbai Express (2005) - Avinash/Mumbai Express\n\nVirumandi (2004) - Virumandi\n\nVasoolraja M.B.B.S (2004) - Vasool Raja\n\nAnbe Sivam (2003) - Nallasivam\n\nNala Damayanthi (2003) - Himself\n\nPammal K.

He did his B.Com in YNR college of Narsapur.Later on, he wanted to become an actor. However, his father wanted him to finish studies. Therefore, he took the easy way out by joining ICW and he started learning acting simultaneously. He joined acting school in 1971.\n\nA director called Raj Kumar has given Chiranjeevi a chance as an actor in a film called 'Punadi Rallu'. Later on, Kranthi Kumar as a producer offered him a role in the direction of K Vasu for the film 'Pranam Kharidu. Incidentally, Pranam Kharidu was the first film to be released.\n\nChiranjeevi made his debut in 1978 with the film Pranam Khareedu. After playing a series of minor and negative roles in films like Manavoori Pandavulu, Mosagadu, and 49 Rojulu, Chiranjeevi got a breakthrough in the form of Khaidi in 1983 under the direction of A. Kodandarami Reddy. Khaidi, was a huge hit at the box office and Chiranjeevi became one of the top heroes in Tollywood.\n\nHe established his dominance in the 1980's with blockbusters like Abhilasha (1983), Challenge (1984), Pasivadi Pranam (1987), Athaku Yamudu Ammayiki Mogudu (1989) and others. He extended his success into the 1990s with Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari (1990), Kodama Simham (1990), Gang Leader (1991), Rowdy Alludu (1991), and Gharana Mogudu (1992).\n\nThe mid 90's were a career low for Chiranjeevi with box office failures like Mechanic Alludu (1993), S.P.Parshuram (1994), Big Boss (1995), and Rikshavodu (1995), but he made a comeback in the late 90's with blockbusters like Master (1997), Choodalani Vundi (1998), Bavagaru Bagunnara (1998), and Sneham Kosam (1999).\n\nIn 2002, Chiranjeevi had one release, Indra, which was a huge hit and the highest grossing film at that time.\n\nHe won the Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu) and the Nandi Award for Best Actor, for his performance in Indra. Again in 2003, Chiranjeevi had only one release, Tagore, which was a hit at the box office. In 2004, Chiranjeevi's long awaited film Anji finally released but did not make a big impact at box office as it was expected to. But later that year, his next release Shankardada MBBS became a huge hit.\n\nHe got married to Ms. Surekha, daughter of Sri Allu Rama Lingaiah in 1980 when Chiranjeevi was 11 cinemas old. Allu Rama Lingaiah met Chiranjeevi first at the shooting of 'Manvoori Pandavulu'. Sri NT Rama Rao was the chief guest for the marriage.\n\nChiranjeevi is known for his dare devil stunts. During the shooting of Sangharshana, he was injured while doing the climax. He went to London to get operated. He was also injured when he tried fighting using Tube light in Intiguttu. In Donga cinema, he gave the producer anxious moments while fighting on a wall on 11 storied building by balancing himself. In the latest 'Bavagaru Bagunara', he did a Bungee Jumping with the carefree attitude of a teenage boy.\n\nOn October 2, 1998, he founded the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust (CCT), which includes Chiranjeevi Blood and Eye Banks. It is the state's largest recipient of Blood and Eye Donations.The Blood Bank of the CCT helped over 80,000 people and the Eye Bank has helped about 1000 people in the state of Andhra Pradesh since its opening.So far around 3.5 lakh people have pledged their eyes to CCT so far, giving 1600 people eye sight through CCT. CCT has also won the \"Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award\" by the AP State Government for the past 4 years.\n\nOn June 10, 2006, The President of India, Dr. Abdul Kalam, inaugurated the Chiranjeevi Charitable Foundation (CCF) at the Jubilee Hills Check post in Hyderabad.Recently Chiranjeevi charitable trust has reached one more landmark by crossing the one lakh mark in collecting the blood and more than 96,000 people were helped with blood by this blood bank.\n\nIn January 2006, Mr Chiranjeevi was honored with the Padma Bhushan., the third highest civilian award in India. In November 2006, Chiranjeevi was awarded with a honorary doctorate by Andhra University for his services to the Telugu film industry and for his social work.\n\nChiranjeevi won the Southern Filmfare Award (Best Actor) for seven years.\n\nChiranjeevi is one of the highest paid actors in India.\n\nChiranjeevi's \"Goli Mar (Thriller)\" music video is one of the most viewed videos on Youtube.\n\nChiranjeevi's old hit movies are given to the distributors and exhibitors for free when ever they lose money on his new movie. And his old movies are still successful at the box office.\n\nFilmography:-\n\nShankardada Zindabad (2007) - A.T.M\n\nStalin (2006) - Chitra\n\nStyle (2006) - Cameo\n\nAndarivaadu (2005) - Govindarajulu & Sidhartha\n\nJai Chiranjeeva (2005)\n\nShankar Dada MBBS (2004) - Shankar Dada\n\nAnji (2004) - Anji\n\nTagore (2003) - Ravindranath Tagore\n\nIndra (2002) - Indrasena Reddy/Shankar Narayan\n\nMrugaraaju (2001) - Raju\n\nDaddy (2001) - Raj Kumar\n\nSri Manjunatha (2001) - Manjunatha Swamy/Lord Shiva\n\nAnnayya (2000) - Rajaram\n\nIddaru Mitrulu (1999) - Vijay\n\nSneham Kosam (1999) - Simhadri & Chinnayya\n\nBavagaru Bagunnara?
