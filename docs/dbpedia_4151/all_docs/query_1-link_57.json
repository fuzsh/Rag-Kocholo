        "text": "Actor Nani's recent observation during a promotional interview for the films 'Animal' and 'Hi Nanna' sparked an intriguing discussion about the narrative element in this upcoming movie.\n\nWhile discussing the 'Animal' teaser, Nani drew a parallel with the 1996 film 'Dharma Chakram,' focusing on the intense father-son relationship portrayed in both films. He highlighted how 'Animal,' starring Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor, delves into the complexities between a powerful businessman father and his son, much like 'Dharma Chakram' depicted the conflict between a father and his angry young man son played by Venkatesh.\n\nNani pointed out a significant shift in the portrayal of fatherly characters in movies, particularly noting the evolution from softer portrayals pre-1990s to a more transformative approach post-'Dharma Chakram.' However, after watching the 'Animal' trailer, he noted a departure from the similarities observed in 'Dharma Chakram,' indicating a unique narrative angle in the new film.\n\nIn interaction with director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, he was questioned about the resemblance of 'Animal' to films like 'Dharma Chakram' and 'Kiratakudu,' known for their focus on strained father-son relationships. Sandeep expressed a different perspective, mentioning that he didn't perceive the resemblance or recall those specific movies, despite having watched them years ago.\n\n-by Vishnupriya"
