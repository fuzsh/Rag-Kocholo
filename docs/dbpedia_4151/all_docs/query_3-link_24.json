        "text": "Jayalalithaa Jayaram (Tamil: ஜெயலலிதா ஜெயராம்) (born 24 February 1948), commonly referred to as J. Jayalalitha, is the formerChief Minister and current leader of the opposition of the Government of Tamil Nadu, India. She is the incumbent General Secretary of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), a Dravidian party in the state. She is called Amma (English: Mother) by her supporters and Puratchi Thalaivi (English: Revolutionary Leader) by her followers.[1] She was a popular film star in Tamil and Telugu cinema before entering politics.\n\nEarly Life\n\nShe was born Komalavalli in Melukote in Pandavapur taluk of Mandya district, Karnataka,[2] in a Tamil Iyengar family, native of Srirangam,Trichy.[3] She was initially educated at the Bishop Cotton Girls’ High School in Bangalore[4] but later moved to Madras State (now Tamil Nadu) along with her mother Sandhya, who ventured as an actress into Tamil cinema.[3] She was then schooled at Sacred Heart Matriculation School (popularly known as Church Park Presentation Convent) in Chennai (then, Madras).[3] She excelled in academics and has claimed that she was offered a scholarship for higher studies from the Government of India[4] but with guidance from her mother, young Jayalalitha moved into film industry. She started acting most of her well known hits when she was 15. She had an older brother, Jayakumar, who died in the early 90’s. He was married to Vijaya and has two children.\n\nFilm Career\n\nPrior to her venture into politics, she had a successful career in the Tamil film industry as an actress. She acted in the English language movie Epistlereleased in 1961 and produced by Shankar Giri, son of former president of India Dr. V. V. Giri. Chinnada Gombe, her first film in Kannada, was a major hit. Her first Telugu film Manushulu Mamathalu made her famous. In 1972, she was honored by the Tamil Nadu State Government with theKalaimamani award. She has acted opposite Dharmendra in the Hindi Movie Izzat. Her last film was Nadhiyai Thedi Vandha Kadal in 1980.\n\nShe has sung the following songs in her film career;\n\nSong Movie Singer(s) Lyrics Music amma endraal anbu AdimaippeN (1969) J.

Eswari Vaali Shankar-Ganesh maaRi varum ulaginilay J. Jayalalitha Kunnakkudi Vaidyanathan\n\nPolitical Career\n\nIn 1981, she joined the AIADMK and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 1988, marking her entry into the Parliament of India. Her association with politics grew from her friendship with the Late M. G. Ramachandran (popularly known as M.G.R), a movie star and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,[5][6][7][8][9][10] and her position as MGR’s mistress helped her become his political heir.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] On M.G.R’s death, she was alienated by a faction of the party who, instead, chose to support M.G.R’s wife, Janaki Ramachandran. Drawing on her massive popularity and her image as the “wronged woman”,[citation needed] in 1989, she won the elections to the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly, incidentally, becoming the first woman to be elected Leader of the Opposition. In 1991, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, just days before the elections, her alliance with the Indian National Congress paid off as a sympathy wave propelled the coalition to a massive victory. She was re-elected to the legislative assembly and became the first elected woman chief minister of Tamil Nadu, serving the full tenure (24 June 1991 – 12 May 1996) (Janaki Ramachandran technically became the first woman chief minister following her husband’s death, but she was unelected and presided over a transitional ‘caretaker’ government). Due to an anti-incumbency wave, and several allegations of corruption and malfeasance against her and her ministers, she lost power to the D.M.K in 1996, in a landslide defeat. All the ministers in her erstwhile cabinet, including her, were defeated in the elections and six of them even lost their deposits, meaning that they did not even secure the minimum number of votes expected of them. She returned to power with a huge majority in the 2001 elections, having mustered a bigger coalition and defying many pre-poll predictions. In the last assembly elections held in 2006, her party had to relinquish power to the DMK government.\n\nControversies and Lawsuits\n\nDuring her years out of power, she has had to face a number of criminal lawsuits stemming from her first term rule mostly dealing with embezzlement and monetary fraud. In 2001, a specially designated court convicted her of criminal breach of trust and of illegally acquiring governmental property belonging to TANSI, a state-run agency, and sentenced her to five years’ imprisonment. She appealed against the sentence to the Supreme Court of India. While the appeal was under judicial consideration, the conviction disqualified her from contesting the 2001 elections. However, having led her party to victory, she controversially became the Chief Minister as a non-elected member of the assembly in Tamil Nadu.\n\nOn 21 September 2001,[18] a five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India ruled that “a person who is convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than two years cannot be appointed the Chief Minister of a State under Article 164 (1) read with (4) and cannot continue to function as such”. Thereby, the bench decided that “in the appointment of Ms. Jayalalithaa as Chief Minister there has been a clear infringement of a Constitutional provision and that a writ of quo warranto must issue”.\n\nIn effect, her appointment as Chief Minister was declared null and invalid. Therefore, technically, she was not the Chief Minister in the period between 14 May 2001 and 21 September 2001.[19] O. Panneerselvam, a minister in her party, was subsequently installed as the Chief Minister. However, his government was widely believed to have been puppeted and micro-managed by Jayalalithaa. In 2003, the Supreme Court acquitted her in the specific case, for lack of conclusive evidence to convict her. This cleared the way for her to contest a mid-term poll to the Andipatti constituency, after the elected representative for the seat, gave up his membership. Winning the election by a handsome margin, Jayalalithaa took over the Chief Ministership again. She is still a party in a few criminal litigations, from her first term rule, in the courts in the neighbouring Karnataka state.[20]\n\nAfter the 2006 assembly elections, O. Panneerselvam was elected the AIADMK legislature party leader and hence the Leader of the Opposition in the assembly after she decided not to attend the assembly except if “absolutely necessary”. However, she, by virtue of her strong control over her party, was considered to be the de-facto leader of the opposition in the state. Later that month when all the attending AIADMK MLAs were suspended, she started attending the assembly. She was elected the legislature party leader and now (as of 2006) leads the opposition in the assembly.\n\nMember of Legislative Assembly(MLA)\n\nYear Status Place 1989 Elected Bodinayakkanur 1991 Elected Bargur 1996 Lost Bargur 2001 Elected Andipatti 2006 Reelected Andipatti\n\nChief Minister\n\nFrom Year To Year Election 1991 1996 1991 Tamil Nadu state assembly election 2002 2006 2001 Tamil Nadu state assembly election\n\nMajor Legislative Achivements\n\nBanning of High interest private loans.\n\nCompletion of New Veeranam Water Supply Scheme for Chennai.\n\nBanning lottery tickets to encourage savings.\n\nElimination of the bandit Veerappan.\n\nIntroduction of Video conferencing in Jails and Courts, thus eliminating the need to physically bring the accused to court to extend the parole or remand every time.\n\nRain water Harvesting Scheme, relief to water shortage.\n\nFree cycles to all graduating school students.\n\nThottil Kuzhandai Thittam initiated by her won widespread accolades.\n\nCriticisms\n\nAllegations of oppressive style of governance\n\nHer detractors consider her style of governance oppressive. The following incidents are a few which are popularly held against her, to justify such claims;"
