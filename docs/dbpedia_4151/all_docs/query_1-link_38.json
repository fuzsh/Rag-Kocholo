        "text": "Dharma Chakram is a Telugu-language drama film released in 1996, directed by Suresh Krissna and starring Venkatesh Daggubati, Ramya Krishnan, and Brahmanandam. The movie revolves around the life of Venkateswarlu (Venkatesh), who is a truck driver by profession. He meets a woman named Vaidehi (Ramya Krishnan) who is a social worker by profession and gets involved with her in her noble work of rescuing young girls from the clutches of prostitution. The relationship between Venkatesh and Vaidehi develops, and they fall in love. Later on, Venkatesh finds out that Vaidehi's father is none other than the powerful industrialist Bapineedu (Gollapudi Maruthi Rao), who is against their union. Despite obstacles from both Bapineedu and Vaidehi's ex-boyfriend Chakravarthy (Kota Srinivasa Rao), Venkatesh and Vaidehi are determined to stay together.\n\nThe film's story is a reflection of the issue of human trafficking and prostitution that is persisting in society. Venkatesh's character takes a stand for the social cause and tries to bring about social justice for the victims of trafficking. Throughout the movie, we see his struggles to make a difference, and the challenges he faces along the way, including threats and physical violence. The film explores how society is often reluctant to face the reality of the problem, and how it is the responsibility of individuals to take steps towards needed solutions.\n\nThe performance of the lead actors in the film is noteworthy. Venkatesh delivers a standout performance as Venkateswarlu, the truck driver who takes on the task of rescuing trafficked women. His portrayal of the character's dedication and determination to fight for the helpless is commendable. Ramya Krishnan, who plays Vaidehi, delivers an impressive performance as well. The chemistry between the two actors is also worth a mention, and their love story is portrayed with sensitivity and depth.\n\nMoreover, Brahmanandam, who plays the role of Venu, Venkatesh's friend, brings in the much-needed comic relief in the movie. His character's humorous antics provide a much-needed break from the intense storyline. The other supporting cast, including Gollapudi Maruthi Rao, Kota Srinivasa Rao, and Srividya, also deliver great performances that add value to the movie.\n\nThe music composed by M.M. Keeravani is another highlight of the film. The songs \"Yennirandu Asale\" and \"Dharti Ki Tarah\" are popular even today with fans of Telugu cinema. The background score by the composer is also noteworthy, adding the required emotional depth to the intense scenes.\n\nOverall, Dharma Chakram is an impactful movie that sheds light on the social issue of human trafficking and prostitution. This movie was ahead of its time when it came out in 1996, and it still resonates with audiences who are abhorred by these social issues that plague society. The film is a must-watch for Telugu cinema fans who appreciate meaningful cinema that highlights social issues."
