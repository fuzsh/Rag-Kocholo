        "text": "I usually laugh at the titles given to heroes, but for some it is truly deserving. One such actor is Venkatesh. With so many hit movies, it is only fitting that he be called Victory Venkatesh. Thirty years, and his winning streak at the box office is still going strong. Of all the actors in the industry, his movies are the ones I enjoyed the most, growing up. His movies are such, that the very mention of his name brings a smile on your face. Whether you are watching his film for the first time or the hundredth, he can make you laugh and cry, every single time. With his charming personality and over all good looks, he is undoubtedly one of the most loved actors in the industry. Everyone may not be his fans, but I have yet to hear anyone say that they do not like him.\n\nI was first introduced to Venkatesh thirty years ago, with the movie Brahma Rudrulu. Being ardent fans of ANR, my parents took us to watch this movie when it first released. Though very young, I remember thinking that he was much nicer looking than the other actors in the industry. However, the first time I realized as to how handsome he is, is three years later, when I saw him in Prema, a beautiful love story with a very important message regarding the dangers of addiction to over-the-counter / prescription drugs. Both Venky and Revathy steal our hearts as the adorable Prithvi and Maggie. With its beautiful music and impressive performances, the movie is still one of my favorite love stories. Equally impressive was his performance in Swarna Kamalam, my all-time favorite movie by Viswanath. With its light hearted comedy, beautiful music, excellent performances, and a great screenplay, it touches everyone who watches it. Venky’s portrayal of the charming neighbor Chandra Shekhar is one of his best characters to date.\n\n1990 was a big year for the Telugu film industry. It saw the birth of two superstars, Nagarjuna with Shiva and Venkatesh with Bobbili Raja. Though they had already acted in a few films before, it was these movies that made them the stars they are today. These two movies took the state by storm. While Shiva was the dawn of a new style of movie making, Bobbili Raja was very much old school, but both were very entertaining in their own way. Bobbili Raja is special for me, because it brings back fond memories of watching it with my family, and having a great time. And who can forget Venky’s adorable “Ayyo ayyo ayyyayyo”.\n\nThe following year gave us one of Venky’s all-time best movie, Kshana Kshanam. Everything about this film is perfect!! Though declared a flop in its first release, it went on to become a big hit upon being re-released two months later. All thanks to word-of-mouth. The fact that this all happened in an age when social networking did not exist just goes to show as to how good the film is. I lost count of the number of times I have watched this film, but I still crack up every time I watch it. With a good screenplay and great performances, Venkatesh and Sridevi are unforgettable as Chandu and Sathya.\n\nWith Chanti, came the innocent, loving, funny but strong Venky, who became an instant favorite for most women, especially the older generation. This led to many more family dramas, each different than the other, but all equally loved. But Venky is someone who knows his audience very well. While he made movies like Abbaigaru and Suryavamsam for the older generation, he made sure he had a steady flow of movies like Preminchukundam ra, Premante Iddera and Malliswari for the young and romantic, and movies like Gharshana for his action loving fans.\n\nOf all the movies that were released during this time, Nuvvu Naku Nachav is my favorite. The highlight of the movie is its story and dialogues. If there is one thing Venkatesh has mastered over the years, it is his flair for both comedy and drama. He excels in almost every scene, making us laugh and cry with him, throughout the movie. Some of my favorite Venky characters during this period are Pellikani Prasad of Malliswari, Ganesh of Adavari Matalaku Ardhale Verule and Anand of Pellichesukundam. While I love Pellikani Prasad and Ganesh for obvious reasons, the reason I like Anand is because unlike most movies till then, his character addresses a very sensitive issue like rape and all that is wrong with the way it is handled in society. Growing up in the eighties and nineties, I was always horrified at how some movies preached that if a rapist married the girl he raped, then everything should be forgiven and forgotten (and this includes Venkatesh’s own film Brahmaputrudu). So to finally have a movie, with some sensitivity towards the issue, was refreshing. Soundarya as the victim, and Venkatesh as the guy who helps her get through the whole ordeal were exceptional.\n\nIt is impossible to write about all of his roles in one article, because when it comes to memorable performances or favorite movies, the list goes on for Venky. As big as that list is, we all know that it is only half-done. As someone who is very aware of himself as an actor, we can expect to see many more memorable performances from him. Movies like Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, Drushyam, and Gopala Gopala, are just the beginning for this second phase of what is already an illustrious career."
