There was a time when Prema was one of the most sought-after actresses in both Telugu and Kannada. That was in the 1990s and early 2000s, when she was seen in titles such as 'Devi', 'Devi Putrudu', 'Rayalaseema Ramanna Chowdary', among others.

The 44-year-old actress, who divorced her husband Jeevan Appachu in 2016, is now in the news over the unfounded rumour that she is looking to get remarried to someone. Prema herself has opened up on the issue and said that the news is totally fake.

Last seen in the Kannada film 'Upendra Matte Baa' in 2017, Prema shot to fame with her second Kannada film 'Om' (1995), which was directed by Upendra. Starring Shiva Rajkumar, it fetched her the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actress. After this, Prema didn't have to look back. 'Dharma Chakram' opposite Venkatesh was her first Telugu movie. Notable Telugu titles such as 'Chelikaadu', 'Omkaram', 'Maa Aavida Collector', 'Naga Devathe', and 'Ammo Okato Taariku' followed.

After the 2004 Kannada film 'Apthamitra', which was remade as 'Chandramukhi', Prema went on to do some small films in Kannada and Telugu before retiring in 2009. She made a tentative comeback only in 2017.
