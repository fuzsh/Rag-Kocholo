        "text": "1.what are the requirements for report of birth?\n\nFor the list of requirements, please click here.\n\n2. hoW SHOULD THE REGISTRANT’S NAME APPEAR IN THE REPORT OF BIRTH (ROB)?\n\nThe registrant’s name should be consistent with Philippine naming convention, such that all given names form part of the first name (entry #2 on the ROB form).\n\nFor registrants born legitimately:\n\nSurname = Father’s surname\n\nMiddle name = Mother’s maiden last name\n\nFor registrants born out of wedlock and the mother has no prior subsisting marriage with a person other than registrant’s father:\n\nPursuant to RA 9255, the illegitimate child shall bear no middle name and the mother’s maiden name as surname.\n\nIf the biological father admits paternity, he should execute the Affidavit of Admission of Paternity (AAP) so the ROB can be annotated accordingly.\n\nIf an AAP is executed by the father, the registrant has the option to adopt the surname of the father as his/her surname. To do so, the mother/registrant, depending on registrant’s age, shall execute the Affidavit to Use the Surname of the Father (AUSF). The mother’s surname subsequently becomes registrant’s middle name, similar to the format of legitimate children.\n\nFor registrants born out of wedlock and the mother has a prior subsisting marriage with a person other than registrant’s father:\n\nPursuant to Article 167 of the Family Code of the Philippines, the registrant is presumed legitimate and shall bear the surname of the mother’s legal husband.\n\n3.WHEN IS A CHILD CONSIDERED DUAL FILIPINO AND AMERICAN AT BIRTH?\n\nA child born in the US on or after 17 January 1973 to at least 1 Filipino citizen parent is considered dual Filipino and American at birth. The birth would need to be reported to the Embassy/Consulate with jurisdiction over the place of birth so that the child can be recognized as a Filipino citizen. The child may apply for a Philippine passport upon completion of the Report of Birth.\n\n4.IS IT MANDATORY TO APPLY FOR A PHILIPPINE PASSPORT AFTER THE REPORT OF BIRTH IS COMPLETED?\n\nIt is not mandatory to apply for a Philippine passport after completing the Report of Birth process. However, whenever traveling to the Philippines, especially if staying for an extended period and/or dealing with various public and private establishments such as the Philippine Bureau of Immigration, schools, banks, and real estate entities where proof of Philippine citizenship is required, possession of a Philippine passport, in addition to an approved ROB, facilitates transactions.\n\n5.IN CASE OF LOSS OF PERSONAL COPY, HOW CAN I OBTAIN ANOTHER COPY OF MY APPROVED REPORT OF BIRTH (ROB)?\n\nAll approved ROBs are forwarded to Manila and become part of the permanent record of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). After approximately six (6) months from the time of approval of the ROB, registrant may request for an authenticated copy from the PSA online at www.psahelpline.ph or www.psaserbilis.com.ph or by visiting the various PSA Serbilis Centers.\n\nFor ROBs filed with the Philippine Embassy in Washington DC from April 2016 onwards, registrants may also apply for a certified true copy of the approved ROB with the Embassy for a fee of USD25.\n\n1.WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORT OF MARRIAGE?\n\nFor the list of requirements, please click here.\n\n2. IS IT MANDATORY FOR THE WIFE TO ADOPT HER HUSBAND’S SURNAME AFTER THE REPORT OF MARRIAGE IS COMPLETED?\n\nIt is not mandatory for the wife to adopt the husband’s surname following reporting of marriage. Under PH laws, the wife has three (3) options:\n\nOption 1: Retain complete maiden name.\n\nOption 2: Adopt husband’s surname as surname. Maiden surname becomes the middle name.\n\nOption 3: Affix husband’s surname to maiden surname by hyphenating (MAIDEN SURNAME-HUSBAND’S SURNAME). Middle name remains as is.\n\nIt should be noted that once the maiden surname is changed, the wife cannot simply revert back to her maiden name, unless supported by documentation evidencing death of husband (death certificate) or dissolution of marriage under PH laws (PSA-annotated marriage certificate / Report of Marriage).\n\n2.IN CASE OF LOSS OF PERSONAL COPY, HOW CAN I OBTAIN ANOTHER COPY OF MY APPROVED REPORT OF MARRIAGE (ROM)?\n\nAll approved ROMs are forwarded to Manila and become part of the permanent record of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). After approximately six (6) months from the time of approval of the ROM, registrants may request for an authenticated copy from the PSA online at www.psahelpline.ph or www.psaserbilis.com.ph or by visiting the various PSA Serbilis Centers.\n\nFor ROMs filed with the Philippine Embassy in Washington DC from April 2016 onwards, registrants may also apply for a certified true copy of the approved ROM with the Embassy for a fee of USD25.\n\n3.IF THE FILIPINO SPOUSE/S HAVE PRIOR MARRIAGE/S, WHAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS ARE REQUIRED?\n\nIf widowed, applicant must present the original and (4) photocopies of the death certificate of deceased spouse. In case the applicant’s name is not indicated in the death certificate as spouse of the deceased, the applicant shall likewise present the original and (4) photocopies of the PSA marriage certificate / ROM.\n\nIf annulled in the Philippines, applicant must present the original and (4) photocopies of the PSA marriage certificate / ROM from previous marriage, with annotation of the declaration of nullity by a Philippine court.\n\nIf divorced outside of the Philippines, applicant must present the original and (4) photocopies of the PSA marriage certificate / ROM from previous marriage, with annotation of the recognition of the foreign judgment of divorce by a Philippine court.\n\n1.WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DUAL CITIZENSHIP?\n\nFor the list of requirements, please click here.\n\n2. WHY DO YOU NEED MY CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH/MARRIAGE/NATURALIZATION?\n\nThese documents help your application by establishing the natural-born Filipino status, civil status, foreign citizenships and other relevant information as required on the application form.\n\n3.CAN I NOW RESIDE IN THE PHILIPPINES?\n\nHaving retained/reacquired your Philippine citizenship, you can reside in the Philippines for as long as you want without having to apply for entry visa and paying immigration fees. You can choose to retire or permanently settle in the Philippines.\n\n4.IS THERE A RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR DUAL CITIZENSHIP?\n\nResidency in the Philippines is NOT a requirement for those who retain/reacquire Philippine citizenship. Those who intend to vote in local elections, however, must establish residence in the locality where they wish to vote.\n\n5.WHAT ARE THE OTHER PH GOVT ISSUED DOCUMENTS THAT I CAN BRING / USE?\n\nOther Philippine-government issued document may be submitted such as the marriage certificate issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority whereby the details of the applicant’s birth date, place of birth, gender and, the citizenship of the parents are clearly indicated.\n\nA Certificate of Election of Filipino citizenship issued by the Bureau of Immigration will also have to be submitted, if applicable.\n\n6.WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS ON PAYMENT OF INCOME TAXES?\n\nUnder the Philippine Comprehensive Tax Reform Program of 1997, incomes earned overseas by Filipinos from 1998 onwards are no longer taxable by the Philippine government. Hence, all Filipinos abroad, including those who have retained/reacquired their Philippine citizenship, have been exempted by the Philippine Government from paying Philippine income tax on incomes earned abroad.\n\nIncomes earned in the Philippines, however, will be subject to Philippine income tax.\n\nProspective applicants are advised to visit and read the contents of the website of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which contains information about current U.S. government policy on taxes on incomes earned worldwide, or to seek legal advice from a U.S. tax lawyer.\n\n7.WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES THAT I WOULD ENJOY WHEN I RETAIN/REACQUIRE PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP?\n\nOnce you reacquire/retain your Philippine citizenship, you will again enjoy full civil, economic and political rights under existing Philippine laws.\n\nAmong these rights are:\n\n1. The right to travel with a Philippine passport;\n\n2. The right to own real property in the Philippines;\n\n3. The right to engage in business and commerce as a Filipino; and\n\n4. The right to practice one’s profession, provided that a license or permit to engage in such practice is obtained from the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), or the Supreme Court in the case of lawyers.\n\nYou may also vote in the Philippine national elections (for President, Vice President, Senators and sectoral representatives) in accordance with the provisions of the Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003.\n\nYour foreign spouse also automatically becomes eligible for an immigrant visa.\n\nYou will enjoy all other right and privileges enjoyed by Filipino citizens.\n\n8.DO I HAVE TO BE A DUAL CITIZEN TO OWN PROPERTY IN THE PHILIPPINES?\n\nNo, former natural-born Filipinos can still own land in the Philippines even if they do not re-acquire Filipino citizenship, but subject to limitations prescribed by Philippine Republic Act 8179 (for residence purposes- up to 1000 square meters of urban land or one hectare of rural land) and Batas Pambansa 185 (for business or investment purposes 5000 square meters of urban land or three hectares of rural land).\n\nBy becoming a Filipino citizen, you remove these limitations from yourself.\n\n9.WHAT ABOUT PAYMENT OF PHILIPPINE TRAVEL TAXES?\n\nTravel Tax exemption is being granted to dual citizens departing the Philippines and returning to the US whose arrival is stamped on the Philippine passport and whose stay does not exceed one (1) year. For this purpose, a Travel Tax Exemption Certificate is issued upon presentation of both the Philippine and US passports. Processing fee of PHP 200.00 is collected for every certificate issued.\n\nDual citizens whose stay in the Philippines exceed one (1) year will pay the travel tax irrespective of which passport they use for travel.\n\n10.WILL MY APPLICATION FOR DUAL CITIZENSHIP UNDER RA 9225 AFFECT MY US CITIZENSHIP?\n\nThe Act does not require one to renounce his or her US citizenship. Also, generally there is no prohibition against dual citizenship in the US. Nonetheless, you are encouraged to ask your employer if obtaining dual citizenship will affect your employment status especially those who intend to work for a US Federal government agency or the US military.\n\nNonetheless, the US Supreme Court, as early as 1952, has stated that dual citizenship is a “status long recognized by law” and that “a person may have and exercise rights of nationality in two countries and maybe be subject to the responsibilities of both. The mere fact he asserts the rights of one citizenship does not mean that he renounces the other” (Kawakita v US, 343 US 717). In 1964, the US Supreme Court also ruled that a naturalized US citizen has the right to return to his country of origin and resume his former citizenship while remaining a US citizen, even if he never returns to the US (Schneider v. Rusk, 377 US 163).\n\n11. UPON RETENTION/REACQUISITION OF PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, AM I REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR A PHILIPPINE PASSPORT?\n\nApplication for a Philippine passport is not mandatory. However, a passport serves as evidence of Philippine citizenship and is easier to carry around than your Identification Certificate.\n\nIn case you need to conduct business in the Philippines (e.g. in a bank), a Philippine passport is a universally recognized government-issued ID.\n\nTraveling with a valid Philippine passport also enables visa-free entry to several countries neighboring the Philippines, among them Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and Indonesia.\n\n12. I STILL HAVE A VALID PHILIPPINE PASSPORT, WHICH I RENEWED BEFORE I GOT NATURALIZED AS A US CITIZEN. NOW THAT I HAVE RETAINED/REACQUIRED MY PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, CAN I STILL USE THIS PASSPORT?\n\nNo, your old Philippine passport was rendered null and void the moment you were naturalized as a US citizen. You are, however, eligible to apply for a new Philippine passport filing retention/reacquisition of your Philippine citizenship.\n\nIndividuals that have just retained/reacquired their Philippine citizenship, who wish to apply for a Philippine passport, will need to make a separate application and submit the requirements for passport renewal, one of which is the birth certificate issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\n13. CAN MY SPOUSE, WHO IS NOT A FORMER FILIPINO, APPLY FOR DUAL CITIZENSHIP?\n\nNo, only former natural-born Filipinos may apply for dual citizenship under RA 9225.\n\n14. WILL MY FOREIGN SPOUSE, WHO WILL TRAVEL WITH ME TO THE PHILIPPINES, BE REQUIRED TO SECURE ADDITIONAL TRAVEL DOCUMENTS FROM THE PHILIPPINE EMBASSY BEFORE LEAVING?\n\nThe answer would depend on the intended period of stay in the Philippines and if the spouse is a visa-required national under the Philippine visa regulation.\n\nForeign spouse (as well as children) included in the visa waiver category may avail of the Balikbayan-Program for stays of up to 1 year. Otherwise, they would need to apply for an appropriate visa.\n\n15. CAN MY SPOUSE, WHO IS NOT A FORMER FILIPINO, LIVE IN THE PHILIPPINES?\n\nAn immigrant visa may be issued to a Filipino citizen’s foreign spouse which entitled him/her to permanently reside in the Philippines. The visa may be obtained by applying at the Philippine Embassy of Philippine Consulate General. The effectivity of the visa, however, is contingent upon the Filipino citizen’s retention of his Filipino citizenship.\n\n16. DO ADOPTED CHILDREN OF FORMER FILIPINOS QUALIFY FOR DUAL CITIZENSHIP?\n\nYes. Under the principle of derivative citizenship, unmarried children below eighteen (18) years of age, whether legitimate, illegitimate, or adopted, of former Filipino parents who retained/reacquired their Philippine citizenship under RA 9225, may also be deemed Filipino citizens, if they are included in the parent’s application for retention/reacquisition of Philippine citizenship and the corresponding fees are paid.\n\n17. WHAT SHOULD I WEAR TO THE OATH TAKING CEREMONY?\n\nThere is no prescribed dress code for the Oath Taking Ceremony. However, the ceremony is a solemn and meaningful event. Please dress in proper attire to respect the dignity of the event.\n\n1.WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR NOTARIAL Services?\n\nFor the list of requirements, please click here.\n\n2. WHAT IS AN APOSTILLE AND WHEN DO I NEED ONE?\n\nAn Apostille is a certificate that authenticates the origin of a public document. It is issued by a country that is party to the Apostille Convention to be used in another country which is also a party to the Convention.\n\nOn 14 May 2019, the Philippines will officially become a party to the Apostille Convention. Authentication is still required for all Philippine documents to be used abroad, but this time with an Apostille instead of an Authentication Certificate (“red ribbon”) as proof of authentication.\n\nAfter authentication (Apostillization) by DFA-OCA, as Competent Authority, there is no more need for authentication (legalization) by the Foreign Embassies or Consulates except for non- Apostille countries and those that objected to the Philippine accession.\n\n3.IN WHICH COUNTRIES DOES THE APOSTILLE CONVENTION APPLY?\n\nThe Apostille Convention only applies if both the country where the public document was issued and the country where the public document is to be used are parties to the Convention. For the updated list of all “Apostille Countries,” please visit this link:\n\nhttps://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/convaentions/status-table/?cid=41\n\nAside from countries that have not acceded to the Apostille Convention, the Philippine Apostille will not yet apply to Austria, Finland, Germany and Greece. Documents from and to such countries will still require legalization by the concerned Embassy or Consulate.\n\n4.WHAT DO I DO IF THE COUNTRY WHERE I NEED TO USE MY PUBLIC DOCUMENT IS NOT AN APOSTILLE COUNTRY?\n\nBy 14 May 2019, DFA-OCA will issue Apostille Certificates to all documents submitted for authentication. If your public document is to be used in a country where the Apostille Convention does not apply, you should contact the Embassy or Consulate of the country where you intend to use the document in order to find out what your options are. This usually means that you need to present your documents to the said country’s Embassy or Consulate in the Philippines for its authentication/legalization.\n\nYou may also ask the intended recipient of your document whether an Apostille is necessary in your particular case.\n\n5.TO WHICH DOCUMENTS DOES THE APOSTILLE CONVENTION APPLY?\n\nThe Philippine Apostille will apply to the same types of documents that are subject to authentication by the DFA prior to the effectivity of the Apostille Convention in the Philippines. For more information on the apostillization of Philippine government-issued documents and private documents, please visit https://dfa-oca.ph/authentication/.\n\nMoreover, an Apostille may never be used for the recognition of a document in the country where that document was issued. Apostilles are strictly for the use of public documents abroad. Thus, if your document is to be used in the Philippines, it cannot be submitted to the DFA for authentication/Apostillization.\n\n6.WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF AN APOSTILLE AND HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE AUTHENTICATION CERTIFICATE (“RED RIBBON”)?\n\nThe Apostille streamlines the whole authentication procedure of documents for use abroad resulting to more convenience, less cost and processing time for the applicants. Before Apostille, a Philippine document to be used abroad needs a Certification by the relevant government agency or office, Authentication by the DFA and Authentication (Legalization) by the Embassy of the country of destination.\n\nWith the Apostille, the aforementioned document will no longer require legalization by the Foreign Embassy if the country of destination is already a Member of the Apostille Convention (or an “Apostille Country.”) Once Apostillized, the document can be validly used in any and all Apostille Countries.\n\nThe Apostille Convention also establishes conditions that are more conducive to foreign investment thereby improving the country’s global competitiveness. It makes it easier for companies to start up a business in a foreign country such as the Philippines. More direct investments in the Philippines mean more jobs for the Filipinos.\n\n7.I AM AN OVERSEAS FILIPINO, HOW WILL THE APOSTILLE CONVENTION AFFECT ME?\n\nJust as Philippine documents for use in Apostille countries will no longer need to pass through another authentication by the foreign embassies in Manila after they have been authenticated (Apostillized) by the DFA-OCA, foreign documents from Apostille countries will only need Apostillization by the host government for them to be validly used in the Philippines or in another Apostille country. (Note: DFA-OCA will not authenticate/Apostillize all types of foreign documents.)\n\nThere shall be no change in the authentication process in non-Apostille countries and in Austria, Fintand, Germany and Greece.\n\n8.WHAT IF I STILL WANT MY DOCUMENT, EXECUTED IN AN APOSTILLE COUNTRY, TO BE AUTHENTICATED BY THE PHILIPPINE EMBASSY?\n\nBy 14 May 2019, Philippine Embassies/Consulates shall no longer authenticate documents originating from Apostille countries. Such documents will still need the Apostille from the host government but not the authentication by the Philippine Embassy/Consulate.\n\nEmbassies and Consulates are not authorized to issue an Apostille.\n\n9.WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF AN APOSTILLE?\n\nJust like the Authentication Certificate (or “red ribbon”), an Apostille only certifies the origin of the public document to which it relates: it certifies the authenticity of the signature or seal of the person or authority that signed or sealed the public document and the capacity in which this was done.\n\nAn Apostille does not certify the content of the public document to which it relates.\n\nAn Apostille may never be used for the recognition of a document in the country where that document was issued — Apostilles are strictly for use of public documents abroad. Thus, DFA- OCA will not issue an Apostille for documents that will be used in the Philippines.\n\n10.IF THE RECIPIENT OF MY APOSTILLE WANTS TO VERIFY MY APOSTILLE, WHAT SHOULD I SUGGEST?\n\nEach Apostille Country is required to keep a register in which it records the date and number of every Apostille it issues, as well as information relating to the person or authority that signed or sealed the underlying public document. Recipients may contact the Competent Authority identified on the Apostille and ask whether the information on the Apostille corresponds with the information in the register.\n\nIn order to verify a particular Apostille, recipients may contact the Competent Authority. Contact information for the Competent Authorities, including phone numbers and website information, is available in the Apostille Section of the Hague Conference website: https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/authorities1/?cid=41\n\nIssued Philippine Apostilles may be verified through this link: www.dfa.gov.ph/verify-apostille. You may also scan the QR Code on the Apostille, using your smartphone, for a quick access to the verification link.\n\nFor questions/clarification, please send an e-mail to notarials@phembassy-us.org or call +1-202-467-9319.\n\n1.WHAT ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR OVERSEAS ABSENTEE VOTING?\n\nFor the qualifications, please click here.\n\n2. HOW CAN I VOTE?\n\nThe method of voting in the US and Caribbean is postal. There is no need to request the Embassy to mail your ballots.\n\nThe Embassy will mail all electoral packets to the registered addresses of overseas voters.\n\n3.I HAVE CHANGED MY REGISTERED ADDRESS.

There are designated drop boxes at the Embassy.

Should you find yourself in that list, please immediately contact the Embassy at consular@phembassy-us.org for further coordination.\n\n7.CAN I PICK UP MY BALLOT?\n\nYou can signify your intent to pick up your ballot by emailing wdcpeov@phembassy-us.org on or before April 13. If you signified your intent and received confirmation from the Embassy, you will have to pick up your ballot on or before 22 April 2022.\n\nAll unclaimed ballots after 22 April 2022 will be mailed out to the registered addresses of those voters.\n\n8.CAN I STILL REGISTER TO VOTE?\n\nNo, overseas voters’ registration ended on 14 October 2021.\n\n9.WHEN DOES THE OVERSEAS ELECTION PERIOD END?\n\nVoters are reminded that only ballots received by the Embassy before Monday, 09 May 2022, 7:00AM ET (concurrent to the close of polls in Manila on 09 May 2022, 7:00 PM Philippine Time) will be counted. Ballots received after this time will be considered INVALID and not be counted.\n\n10.WHEN AND WHERE WILL BALLOT FEEDING TAKE PLACE?\n\nBallot feeding will take place every Monday and Thursday at 9:00AM during the voting period, beginning on 10 April – 09 May 2022. The venue for all proceedings will be at the Quezon Hall of the Philippine Embassy Chancery Annex, 1617 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington D.C. 20036.\n\n1.WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A PASSPORT?\n\nFor the list of requirements, please click here.\n\n2.

Refer to the schedule and …\n\n7.WHAT IS THE VALIDITY OF A PHILIPPINE PASSPORT?\n\nIn accordance with Department Order No. 010-2017 or the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 10928 (2017), Philippine passports issued to Filipino 18 years or older have a ten-year validity period. Filipinos below 18 years of age will still be issued five-year valid passports.\n\n8.WHERE CAN I GET A PASSPORT APPLICATION FORM?\n\nYou may download the passport application form from this link.\n\n9.HOW LONG BEFORE I RECEIVE MY NEW PASSPORT?\n\nIt takes 6 to 8 weeks for the processing and release of new passport to applicant.\n\n10.HOW MANY ENVELOPE/S DO WE NEED TO BRING IF WE ARE A FAMILY/OR RESIDING IN ONE ADDRESS?\n\nOne envelope per applicant.\n\n11.

This may extend beyond the period of validity of the visa, depending on the date of arrival in the country.\n\n3.CAN I STAY LONGER THAN THE AUTHORIZED PERIOD OF STAY ON MY VISA?\n\nYes, you may extend your stay in the Philippines through the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. You will find information on how to extend your stay in the Philippines on this page: https://immigration.gov.ph/faqs/extensionofstay\n\nTo illustrate: Dave Semartates may enter the Philippines any time from 18 December 2017 to 17 December 2018. Assuming he enters on 14 December 2018, he may stay for 59 days until 10 February 2019.
