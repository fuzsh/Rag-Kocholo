        "text": "Early life and mayor of Davao City\n\nDuterte’s father served as governor of the province of Davao, and his mother was a community activist who had a prominent role in the “people power” movement that deposed the authoritarian president Ferdinand Marcos and restored democratic rule to the Philippines. Duterte earned a political science degree (1968) from Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila and a law degree (1972) from San Beda College. In 1977 he joined the Davao City prosecutor’s office, where he remained until he was appointed (1986) vice mayor of that city.\n\nDuterte was elected mayor in 1988, and he was reelected to that post twice over the subsequent decade. Because of term-limit restrictions, he was barred from seeking reelection in 1998, but he successfully ran for a seat representing Davao in the Philippines House of Representatives. Upon the completion of that term in 2001, he returned to Davao City and was once more elected mayor. Because the term-limit restriction again came into force in 2010, he was elected vice mayor, and his daughter Sara served as mayor. In 2013 Duterte returned to the mayor’s office, this time with his son Paolo (“Pulong”) serving as vice mayor.\n\nDuring his more than two decades as mayor of Davao City, the controversial politician transformed the city from a haven of lawlessness into one of the safest areas in Southeast Asia. Duterte’s harsh crime-fighting tactics earned him the nicknames “the Punisher” and “Duterte Harry” (in reference to the film character Dirty Harry, the ruthlessly effective police inspector portrayed by actor Clint Eastwood), but critics such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch claimed that Duterte was responsible for more than 1,000 extrajudicial killings. Rather than denying such allegations, he embraced them. The death squads that had carried out the killings operated with an impunity that implied official sanction, and Duterte openly praised both their methods and their apparent results. In that way he cultivated the image of a coarse pistol-toting vigilante in the months leading up to the presidential election. His antiestablishment message took hold among a Filipino public weary of official corruption, and his brash over-the-top rhetoric led to comparisons of him to U.S. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump.\n\nDuterte’s position on the contested Spratly Islands—arguably the Philippines’ most-pressing foreign policy issue—caused consternation among the country’s allies. He wavered unpredictably between a negotiated settlement with China and a claim that he would ride a jet ski to one of the disputed islands and plant a Filipino flag on it. On May 9 nearly 80 percent of eligible voters turned out for the election, and Duterte captured nearly as many votes as his two closest competitors combined. Within days of his landslide victory, Duterte vowed to reintroduce the death penalty—abolished in the Philippines in 2006—in concert with his promise to “fatten all the fish” in Manila Bay with the bodies of criminals. In a televised address in June, he endorsed vigilantism by members of the public, stating that he would personally reward anyone who shot and killed a drug dealer.\n\nThe Duterte presidency\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Duterte was inaugurated as president of the Philippines. In his first six months in office, more than 6,000 people were killed in Duterte’s “war on drugs.” A fraction of those deaths occurred during police operations. The overwhelming majority were extrajudicial killings by death squads. Metro Manila’s funeral parlours were strained beyond capacity, and hundreds of unidentified or unclaimed bodies were interred in mass burials. Human rights organizations and Roman Catholic officials spoke out against the bloodshed, but Duterte responded by accusing the church of corruption and the sexual abuse of children.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The United States had suspended the sale of 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines as a result of the human rights abuses, and in May 2017 Duterte met with Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin to discuss the prospect of an arms deal. While Duterte was in Moscow, a series of deadly clashes erupted in Marawi between Filipino troops and Islamist fighters linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also called ISIS). Duterte cut short his trip and declared a state of martial law covering the entire island of Mindanao. Although government forces retook Marawi and quashed the rebellion, the declaration was renewed through the end of 2019, making it the longest period of martial law in the Philippines since the Marcos era.\n\nIn February 2018 the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened a preliminary investigation into the more than 12,000 deaths that had occurred during Duterte’s “war on drugs.” The following month Duterte responded by announcing his intention to withdraw the Philippines from the ICC; that withdrawal became official in March 2019. In September 2021 the ICC authorized a full investigation into Duterte’s actions, but the probe was suspended two months later when officials in Manila asserted that they were conducting their own inquiries into the extrajudicial killings.\n\nInternational and domestic human rights organizations continued to remain sharply critical of Duterte, but he dismissed them, going so far as to instruct police to shoot activists if they were “obstructing justice.” Press freedoms were also curtailed, and Maria Ressa, cofounder of a news website that had documented the worst excesses of Duterte’s antidrug campaign, was arrested numerous times on questionable charges. In a pointed rebuke of Duterte and his policies, in 2021 Ressa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (along with Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov) for using “freedom of expression to expose abuse of power, use of violence, and growing authoritarianism in her native country.”\n\nDuterte remained widely popular with the Filipino public, however, and voters in May 2019 delivered a resounding endorsement of the president’s agenda by backing a slate of pro-Duterte candidates. Duterte maintained his hold on the House of Representatives, and, by taking control of the Senate, he removed what was the only effective check remaining on his administration. Although constitutionally limited to a single presidential term, Duterte flirted with methods of remaining in power. In September 2021 his party nominated him as its candidate for vice president, but he unexpectedly withdrew from that race the following month. After a short-lived bid for a Senate seat, Duterte then announced that he planned to retire from politics after overseeing the peaceful transfer of power to his successor. By the time Filipinos went to the polls in May 2022, Duterte had endorsed his daughter, Sara Duterte, in her ultimately successful bid for the vice presidency, but he had remained surprisingly aloof of the presidential race. That contest was won by Ferdinand ( “Bongbong”) Marcos, Jr., son of the authoritarian leader who was ousted in 1986.\n\nMichael Ray"
