        "text": "Synopsis\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr. takes an oath to serve as the 17th President of the Philippines on Thursday, 30th June 2022, after winning elections on 9th May 2022 with 31.6 million votes.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, the son of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, won the elections on 9th May with 31.6 million votes and was swore as the 17th President of the Philippines on Thursday, 30th June 2022. He took the oath at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Manila before the Supreme Court Justice, Alexander Gesmundo. The former President’s daughter and his running mate, Sara Duterte Carpio, swore as vice president on 19th June. The two will be serving the nation until 2028.\n\nThis inauguration has ended Duterte’s presidential term of 6 years, whose legacy is known for putting an end to drugs that claimed the lives of more than 6,000 citizens. He was also known for targeting the media and civil society by imposing tax evasion charges on those who challenged his government policies.\n\nMarcos Jr. is more popularly known as “Bongbong” in the country and won on the platform of national unity, promising more jobs, lowering prices, and increasing investment in agriculture and infrastructure.\n\nMarcos Jr. thanked his 92-year-old mother, Imelda Marcos, in his speech and mentioned his father. He spoke about bringing unity to the country and helping its economy recover from the pandemic and grow to become prosperous.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Sr. was a dictator who ruled the country from 1965 to 1986 and was laid off due to abuse of human rights and increased corruption. During his reign, the country observed martial law from 1972-1981, where several people were tortured, imprisoned or killed for criticizing the government.\n\nAccording to the Presidential Commission on Good Governance, the Marcos family had stolen $10 billion from Filipino citizens during his reign. Although the family denies using state funds for personal use, campaigners say martial law victims are still fighting for justice.\n\nAfter 36 years, his son has restored his family’s dynasty to the Malacañang Palace. However, critics say this may bring back corruption and martial law in the country.\n\nDue to the crimes committed by his father, Marcos Sr., many activist groups protested the inauguration. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court had rejected two petitions for cancelling his candidacy on the grounds of tax offences.\n\nMarcos Jr. had requested the public to make their decision based on his actions instead of judging him based on his family history. However, his father’s legacy ended up dominating his election campaign.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
