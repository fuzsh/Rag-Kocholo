        "text": "75.8 million Filipinos are registered to Philippine’s national ID system PhilSys.\n\nThe Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) says it intends to fast-track a digital ID ecosystem with the help of the private sector, to tap transactions across businesses and government agencies.\n\nIt comes after consumer rights group CitizenWatch Philippines rallied the government – and enterprises – to press forward with the rollout of the Philippine National ID, stressing the digital transformation impact on all sectors in the public and private sector.\n\nUpon enacting the Philippine Identification System Act in 2018, the government’s aim was to issue a single national identity system.\n\nA digital PhilSys app will provide crucial validation of identity as well as in the context of facilitating “public and private transactions”, promote business and a healthy e-commerce environment, combat fraud and allow citizens to contribute to their digital economy and government.\n\nPhilippine’s President Marcos Jr. made the order to accelerate the digitalisation of the National Identification (ID) system during a meeting with the Private Sector Advisory Council on Digital Infrastructure in Malacañang.\n\nAn issuance strategy was initiated by the PSA to build a website for registered citizens to download a PDF copy of their ePhillD on to a mobile device.\n\n“PhilSys is a foundational, digital lD system, so its functionality is geared towards digital use – whether as a card, printed on paper, or PDF tile. This ensures an inclusive national lD system that can be used across government agencies and private entities for more efficient delivery of services for Filipinos. This is a move closer to realising the vision of a Makabagong Pilipinas,” said Usec. Mapa.\n\nDigital IDs can also be successfully integrated into a digital wallet with other service applications, for example ePrescription, online banking apps, drivers’ licences and government documents."
