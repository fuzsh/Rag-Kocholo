        "text": "New headquarters located in Pasig City will be home to Sony Music Entertainment and label services company The Orchard to Continue Support of Local Artists and Repertoire\n\nManila, September 30, 2022 – Sony Music Entertainment (SME) Philippines today announced the opening of its new office in Manila, to continue the Company’s business to discover and develop the next generation of Filipino artists.\n\nLocated in Pasig City, a major business, entertainment and cultural hub, the new Office will be the home for SME Philippines and The Orchard Philippines, housing specialists in A&R and digital marketing to support SME Philippine’s roster of more than 70 local artists, discover and develop up-and-coming musical talent, and promote music from the country.\n\nSME Philippines is home to some of the most well-known artists and musical groups in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, including Ben&Ben, SB19, NOBITA, Ace Banzuelo, and Clara Benin.\n\nThe opening event was attended by Pasig City Deputy Mayor Dodot Jaworski, as well as senior executives from Sony Music Group, artists, and business partners. Guests enjoyed performances by local SME stars Ace Banzuelo, I Belong to The Zoo, Alex Bruce, Clara Benin, Young Cocoa, and Of Mercury.\n\n“The Philippines is a music-loving nation. It is exciting to witness the growth of the local music industry and see local musicians making it big regionally and internationally. We are heartened to see that Sony Music Philippines is calling Pasig City its home,” said Vice Mayor of Pasig City, Dodot Jaworski.\n\n“Here, in the Philippines, the vibrant cultural fabric of the country has given rise to a new generation of artists who are pushing boundaries with their music and showcasing the best of local music,” said Shridhar Subramaniam, President, Corporate Strategy and Market Development, Asia and Middle East, Sony Music Entertainment. “The cultural diversity and creativity in the Philippines coupled with the pace of digital adoption presents enormous opportunities for artists to create and share their music, and we are committed to supporting their efforts.”\n\n“Over the years, we have worked closely with musicians, creators and partners to build an impressive roster of local artists and provide each of them with best-in-class support,” said Roslyn Pineda, General Manager, Philippines, Sony Music Entertainment. “As a result, we’ve created numerous international hits and local favorites, as well as making our mark as the only music company with a Christian music sub label in the country. Looking ahead, we are ready to further our efforts to support Filipino music both in the country and beyond.”\n\nAmong the homegrown artists who have made a name for themselves regionally and internationally are Ben&Ben and SB19.\n\n“Sony Music has been a lovely partner in helping us reach out to our fanbase, Liwanag, with our music,” said Ben&Ben. “They have opened so many doors for us, making it possible to bring the emotions and messages of the songs we’ve made to the people who need it. They have constantly given us renewed energy to keep pushing boundaries and keep moving forward, no matter what direction the wind blows. It’s an honor to be working alongside an organization full of passionate and dedicated people. As we embark on a new adventure with our first North American Tour, it’s sad that we’ll miss the opening of the new office, but we’re proud to see how far Sony Music Philippines has come.”\n\nFive-member sensation SB19 debuted in late 2018 and has received widespread recognition with their singles, “What?”, “Alab (Burning)” and “Go Up”. The pop group was nominated for “Top Social Artist” at the 2021 Billboards Music Awards and has the longest-running number one hit in the history of Billboard’s Hot Trending Songs chart for “Bazinga”.\n\n‘Sony Music has been a key and vital partner for us through the years, helping us reach our fans and audiences through their wide and extensive network’, added SB19 in a statement. ‘From working with us on our first album, to supporting us on our recently released international single ‘WYAT’ and helping us with our upcoming world tour, we couldn’t have asked for a better team. From the bottom of our hearts, we would like to congratulate them on the opening of their new office.”"
