        "text": "June 30, 2022 – present\n\nFerdinand R. Marcos Jr.\n\nCabinetSee listPartyPartido Federal ng PilipinasElection2022SeatMalacañang Palace, Manila\n\n← Rodrigo Duterte\n\nOfficial website\n\nBongbong Marcos began his presidency at noon on June 30, 2022, following his inauguration as the 17th president of the Philippines, succeeding Rodrigo Duterte. His term is expected to expire six years later, on June 30, 2028. He entered into office amid COVID-19 Omicron variant, and the impact of Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMarcos initially downsized government bureaucracy, especially in the executive branch of the government.[1] His administration oversaw the post-pandemic return to normalcy with the gradual reopening of the economy, return of face-to-face/physical classes, removal of stringent travel restrictions,[2] and the lifting of the mask-wearing mandate for outdoor and indoor settings. He also sought to address the rising inflation and shortage of the country's food supply during the beginning of his presidency.\n\nAs president, Marcos signed into law the creation of the Maharlika Investment Fund, the first sovereign wealth fund of the Philippines.[3] Under his term, the Philippines ratified the RCEP in February, and entered into force in June 2023.[4][5] Marcos also went on many foreign trips in hopes to attract more foreign investments in the country. During his term, many Filipinos said they felt unsafe on streets, and the country's drug problem has increased.[6] By the first quarter of 2024, Marcos' performance and trust ratings had dropped significantly, marking an erosion of public trust in him and his administration.[7][8]\n\nAs the son of 10th president Ferdinand Marcos (who was in power from 1965 to 1986), Bongbong Marcos's presidential candidacy has been controversial, receiving criticism from several groups due to his father's regime—a period characterized by violence and oppression against those opposed to his regime,[9][10] political turmoil, and widespread corruption.[11] Some scholars have noted that his campaign was driven by a massive misinformation campaign aimed at revamping the Marcos brand and smearing his rivals;[12][13] Marcos has stated he won't engage in negative and hateful campaigning and has repeatedly declined joining debates that may lead to such.[14][15]\n\nWith just less than two years in office, more Filipinos have become dissatisfied with the administration of Bongbong Marcos, according to the survey conducted by Publicus Asia Inc. from November 29 to December 4, 2023. Economic concerns, rising inflation, joblessness, low wages, and a perceived lack of productivity are some of the emerging factors behind the drop in pro-administration support. The survey also noted that the \"Duterte effect\" still persists, with opposition parties grappling with the discreditation of the previous administration.[16]\n\nElection, transition, and inauguration\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos ran for president on a campaign platform centered on national unity and continuity of the policies of Rodrigo Duterte, his predecessor.[18][19] He won the 2022 elections, receiving 31,629,783 (58.77%) votes out of a total of 56,097,722, beating his closest rival, Liberal Party member and Vice President Leni Robredo by over 15 million votes.[20]\n\nMarcos became the first candidate in the history of the Fifth Republic to win by a majority, scoring nearly 59 percent of the vote. His 31,629,783 votes was not only the highest count ever recorded in a presidential election, but close to the sum total of the two previous records combined.\n\nMarcos's presidential transition began on May 25, 2022, when the Congress of the Philippines proclaimed his candidacy as the winner of the 2022 Philippine presidential election held on May 9, 2022.[21]\n\nMarcos was inaugurated as the seventeenth president of the Philippines on June 30, 2022, at the National Museum of Fine Arts. He was sworn in by Alexander Gesmundo, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.[22] The inaugural ceremony was notable for his meeting with outgoing president Rodrigo Duterte at the Malacañang Palace whose departure honors were also held at the complex, the military-civic parade, and his 25-minute speech that gives a view of what his presidency will look like.[23][24]\n\nQuirino Grandstand was the original venue for Marcos's inauguration. It was moved to the National Museum since the Manila COVID-19 Field Hospital still occupied the site at the time of the inauguration.\n\nMajor activities\n\n[edit]\n\nSpeeches\n\n[edit]\n\nInaugural Address (June 30, 2022)[25]\n\nFirst State of the Nation Address (July 25, 2022)[26]\n\nSecond State of the Nation Address (July 24, 2023)[27]\n\nThird State of the Nation Address (July 22, 2024)[28]\n\nMajor acts and legislation\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos has signed 84 bills into law, 31 of which are national in scope.\n\nExecutive issuances\n\n[edit]\n\nBongbong Marcos has signed a total of 67 executive orders, 661 proclamations, 23 administrative orders, 27 memorandum orders, 57 memorandum circulars, and one special order.[29]\n\nNational budget\n\n[edit]\n\nR. A. No. Title Principal Sponsor Date signed Ref(s). 11936 General Appropriations Act of 2023 Sonny Angara December 16, 2022 [30][31][32] 11975 General Appropriations Act of 2024 December 20, 2023 [33]\n\nLeadership style\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos's leadership style was described by his press secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles as being \"more systematic and efficient\", compared to his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who was driven by passion.[34] Cruz-Angeles described Marcos as \"conservative\", and \"very up to date\" with technology and global issues.[35]\n\nMarcos, in contrast with his predecessor Duterte, is noted for consistently limiting his exposure to journalists and the media. During his presidential campaign, Marcos was criticized for eluding debates and media interviews. After assuming office, he signed his second executive order abolishing the presidential spokesperson position and replacing it with a press secretary. Under Marcos, the Malacañang Palace holds fewer press briefings than the Duterte administration, typically holding a single press briefing per week. The Marcos administration also created a \"pool\" system, in which the Presidential Communications Office limits the number of media members who could attend press briefings or cover certain events.[36]\n\nMarcos said he would sometimes consult his wife, Liza Araneta, who is a lawyer, regarding \"legal matters\", saying \"I'm not a lawyer, so I need an expert opinion\".[37]\n\nAdministration and cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos began naming his Cabinet members on May 12, 2022.[38] Following his presidential inauguration, he administered a mass oath-taking of his Cabinet officials.[39]\n\nMarcos appointed his long time chief-of-staff and spokesperson, Vic Rodriguez as his Executive Secretary.[40] Upon the recommendation of his Chief Presidential Legal Counsel, Juan Ponce Enrile, Marcos rejected the plan of Rodriguez to grant himself additional powers as Marcos's new Presidential Chief of Staff following his resignation as Executive Secretary on September 17 due to issues involving his roles in the sugar importation order fiasco and contentious appointments of some government officials.[41][42] He was replaced by former Supreme Court Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin on September 27.[43]\n\nOn October 4, Marcos reappointed 10 cabinet members after they were bypassed by the Commission on Appointments (COA) on September 28;[44] COA chairperson Jose Calida and Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles resigned the same day.[45][46]\n\nFirst 100 days\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marcos administration faced challenges during this period such as a domestic sugar supply shortage in mid-2022, rising inflation rate brought about by the pandemic, and the economic effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[citation needed]\n\nImmediately after taking his oath of office on June 30, 2022, Marcos, in an attempt to \"achieve simplicity, economy, and efficiency in the bureaucracy\", issued his first executive order abolishing both the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission created by President Duterte in 2017 and the Office of the Cabinet Secretary.[82] The Marcos administration launched its COVID-19 booster shot campaign, PinasLakas, to administer booster doses to at least 23 million Filipinos during Marcos's first 100 days,[83] but managed to boost only 3.5 million.[84] Marcos issued an executive order allowing voluntary use of face masks in outdoor settings,[85] and extended from September 13 to December 31, 2022, the period of the state of calamity declared by his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, due to the COVID-19.[86]\n\nThe Marcos administration launched its anti-illegal drug campaign, Buhay Ingatan, Droga'y Ayawan (BIDA), which commits to continue the war on drugs \"within the framework of the law and with respect for human rights and with focus on rehabilitation and socio-economic development\".[87]\n\nDomestic affairs\n\n[edit]\n\n10-point agenda\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos launched a 10-point agenda as part of his vision to further boost economic growth and rejuvenate the country's prosperity in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Marcos's agenda includes the following:[88]\n\nNational Reopening- aimed to reopen the face to face classes in schools throughout the country, and revitalize the country's tourism sectors.[88]\n\nPublic-Private Partnership- aimed to further deepen the engagements of the public and private sectors to further boost investments.[88]\n\nInfrastructure Development- expansion of the Build! Build! Build! program under the Build Better More program.[88]\n\nFiscal Discipline- aimed to efficiency in tax collection through digitization.[88]\n\nTransparent & Efficient Governance- establish efficiency in government processes through online systems and combat red tape.[88]\n\nDigital Philippines- implementation of the Broadband ng Masa (BBM) program set to improve the country's internet services.[88]\n\nEnergy Security- boost local power generation and capacity through renewable energy sources and proper distribution.[88]\n\nFuture-ready Filipinos- provide quality education through top notch learning materials and technology tools.[88]\n\nAffordable Healthcare- lower cost of medicines, expand pandemic preparedness, and build regional specialty hospitals.[88]\n\nFood for All- increase agricultural output and improve the supply chain.[88]\n\nAgriculture and agrarian reform\n\n[edit]\n\nAgrarian reform\n\n[edit]\n\nOn his 65th birthday, September 14, 2022, Marcos signed his fourth executive order imposing a one-year moratorium on the amortization and interest payments of agrarian reform beneficiaries, which is seen to \"lead to freedom of farmers from debts\".[105]\n\n‘Bagong Pilipinas’ hymn, pledge and slogan\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Marcos Jr., through Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, signed Memorandum Circular No. 52, directing all government agencies and schools to include the recitation of the Bagong Pilipinas hymn - Panahon na ng Pagbabago and Panata sa Bagong Pilipinas pledge in weekly flag ceremonies. Critics argued that the memorandum violates Republic Act No. 8491 or the \"Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines\".[107] The new hymn has also been noted for resembling the Bagong Pagsilang hymn of the martial law era of Marcos' father. Earlier in July 2023, Marcos Jr. also ordered government agencies to include Bagong Pilipinas slogan in their programs and projects.[108]\n\nCensorship\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the Marcos administration, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) in December 2023 suspended for 14 days two shows of media network SMNI, Laban Kasama ang Bayan (LKB) and President Duterte's platform Gikan sa Masa, Para sa Masa; the MTRCB said the suspension was made due to an \"unverified news report\" made by a LKB host and former communist rebel Jeffrey \"Ka Eric\" Celiz suggesting that House Speaker Martin Romualdez had travel funds worth ₱1.8 billion and complaints that a death threat to leftist ACT Teachers Representative France Castro was allegedly made by Duterte in the Gikan sa Masa, Para sa Masa show.[109] Two days later, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) suspended SMNI for 30 days after the House of Representatives adopted a resolution filed by PBA Partylist Representative Margarita Nograles, who claimed that the network was propagating false information.[110] On January 23, 2024, the NTC ordered the indefinite suspension of SMNI on all radio and TV stations, on grounds that SMNI \"failed to strictly comply with the thirty-day suspension order\".[111]\n\nCrime\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing a meeting on July 27, 2022, with Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, Presidential Legal Adviser Juan Ponce Enrile, Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, and lawyer Harry Roque, Marcos, on August 1, said that the Philippines has no intention of rejoining the International Criminal Court (ICC), maintaining that deaths linked to the War on Drugs of the Duterte administration are already being investigated by the Philippine government.[112] By September 9, the deadline imposed by the ICC Office of the Prosecutor's (OTP) for the Philippine government to comment on the resumption of the investigation on the war on drugs, Guevara formally requested the ICC to deny the request of the ICC-OTP to resume the investigation; Guevara maintained that \"the alleged murder incidents that happened during the relevant period do not constitute 'crimes against humanity', considering that said incidents do not qualify as an 'attack' against the civilian population\".[113] In January 2024, Marcos stated he considers the ICC investigation a threat to the Philippines' sovereignty, adding he \"will not lift a finger\" to assist any ICC investigation.[114] However, former Senator and President Duterte's staunch critic Antonio Trillanes remarked on April 24, 2024, that ICC investigators have \"already directly communicated with more than 50 active and former PNP [police] officials\" regarding their implication in the drug war.[115]\n\nAccording to the Philippine National Police, index crimes dropped 11.67% in Marcos's first two months compared to the same period a year prior.[116] Amid a series of reported abductions in the country, several senators urged Marcos to issue a strong directive and act swiftly on the matter.[117] On September 15, the Senate initiated a probe into the series of kidnapping cases.[118]\n\nDrug policy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos declared his intention to continue the war on drugs of the Duterte administration. By September 13, Marcos explained that the war on illegal drugs is \"of internal matter\", opting to leave it out of his First State of the Nation Address; he said a working group was still formulating policies for his anti-drug campaign, with a focus on prevention and rehabilitation.[119]\n\nOn October 7, the Marcos administration launched its anti-illegal drug campaign, Buhay Ingatan, Droga'y Ayawan (BIDA), which commits to continue the war on drugs \"within the framework of the law and with respect for human rights and with focus on rehabilitation and socio-economic development\".[120]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2023, Marcos signed an executive order forming an advisory and management center to ensure efficient management of the Malacañang Heritage Mansions.[121][122] On August 24, 2023, he signed into law Republic Act No. 11961, strengthening the conservation and protection of Philippine cultural heritage.[123]\n\nDecentralization\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos suspended for one year and ordered a review of Executive Order 138 (EO 138) issued by President Duterte in 2021 that directs the full devolution of some executive functions to local government units. Marcos maintained that under EO 138, 4th, 5th, and 6th class municipalities will get poorer due to the extra functions that will be devolved; he added that \"functions that belong to the national government should belong, should stay with the national government\".[124][125][126]\n\nDefense\n\n[edit]\n\nDisaster resilience\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Luzon a few weeks after his presidential inauguration, Marcos rejected creating an executive department dedicated to disaster resilience, agreeing with his sister (Senator Imee Marcos), who said that creating a disaster response body under the Office of the President instead would \"save the government a lot of money\".[137][138] In April 2023, Bongbong Marcos signed an executive order creating a disaster preparedness and response task force.[139]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nReal GDP growth rate (year-on-year) under the Marcos Jr. administration Year Quarter Growth\n\nrate (%) 2022 3rd 7.6[140] 4th 7.2[141] 2023 1st 6.4[142] 2nd 4.3[143] 3rd 6.0[144] 4th 5.6[144]\n\nTwo days after his inauguration, Marcos vetoed a bill creating the Bulacan Airport City Special Economic Zone and Freeport covering New Manila International Airport (which was sponsored by his sister), citing \"substantial fiscal risks\", incoherence with existing laws, and the proposed economic zone's location near the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone.[148] To foster partnership between the national government and the private sector, Marcos formed the Private Sector Advisory Council, an advisory council tasked to make recommendations to the President of the Philippines in assisting government initiatives to revitalize the economy.[149][150]\n\nAmid a 14-year high inflation, in February 2023, Marcos shifted his previous stance on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and expressed support for an increase in agricultural imports; the Senate then ratified the RCEP on February 21, 2023.[151]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos appointed his then-running mate and now Vice President Sara Duterte to concurrently serve as the Secretary of Education. Public schools in the Philippines started full in-person classes on November 2, 2022, after two years of hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[152]\n\nIn August 2022, the Commission on Audit (COA) flagged the Department of Education (DepEd) for the purchase of allegedly overpriced and outdated 39,583 laptops worth ₱2.4 billion back in 2021 for online classes at the height of the pandemic. In response, Duterte requested from the COA a \"fraud audit\" of the laptop deal.[153] Starting August 25, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, headed by Senator Francis Tolentino, held a series of hearings with previous officials of the DepEd and the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM), to look into the matter.[154]\n\nAmid a low full vaccination rate of 19% among Filipino students nationwide, the Marcos administration reopened classes in 46% of all schools in the country, or 24,000 schools on August 22, implementing five days of face-to-face classes; 29,721 schools were allowed to continue implementing blended learning from August to October 2022.[155] A department order was signed, on September 2, by Duterte, automatically suspending all classes from kindergarten to senior high school during calamities and disasters; the order also prohibited the use of schools as long-term evacuation centers.[156]\n\nUnder Sara Duterte's authority, the Department of Education in August 2023 launched the \"Matatag curriculum\", a new \"less congested\" curriculum for Kindergarten to Grade 10. The new curriculum reduced the learning areas for students from seven to five, and removed Mother Tongue as a separate subject; it also emphasized a \"Makabansa\" learning area to instill Filipino identity and nationalism among students.[157]\n\nEnergy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos considers battery farms as a solution to the country's energy needs.[158] In his first State of the Nation Address, Marcos presented his plan to increase energy production by including renewable energy and nuclear energy in the country's energy mix.[159] In May 2023, Marcos renewed the Malampaya gas field contract which was to expire on February 22, 2024, extending it for 15 more years until 2039 and allowing oil companies to continue extracting natural gas from the field.[160]\n\nGambling policy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2022, Marcos issued an executive order formalizing President Rodrigo Duterte's spoken order earlier that May to suspend e-sabong (online cockfighting) operations in the country.[161] In January 2023, Marcos said he was in no rush to ban Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs); he urged the government to continue monitoring POGO's social costs and its illegal operators.[162]\n\nGovernment reorganization\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an attempt to achieve \"simplicity, economy, and efficiency\" in the bureaucracy, Marcos, on June 30, 2022, issued his first executive order abolishing the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) created by Duterte in 2017, and the Office of the Cabinet Secretary.[163] The powers and functions of PACC were transferred to the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs, while the existing Cabinet Secretariat will be under the Presidential Management Staff.[163]\n\nA day after Marcos's inauguration, Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez signed a memorandum circular declaring certain positions in the executive department held by officials appointed by Duterte as vacant, leaving at least 4,000 government positions needing to be filled up. Next-in-rank and most senior officials were to fill up the positions as officer-in-charge (OIC), although casual employees whose contracts were to expire on June 30, 2022, were allowed to serve only until July 31, 2022, unless earlier terminated or renewed.[164] Rodriguez, on July 29, extended the terms of the OICs until December 31, or until a replacement has been made, \"to ensure the continuous and effective delivery of government services\".[165]\n\nOn July 23, 2022, Marcos vetoed a bill strengthening the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) of the Department of Justice, citing \"excessive grant of remuneration, incentives, benefits, allowances, and honoraria\" to employees and hired lawyers.[166] A week later, he vetoed a bill creating transportation safety board, explaining that the proposed board has functions already being \"undertaken by the different agencies\" under the Department of Transportation, the Philippine National Police, and the National Bureau of Investigation.[167]\n\nMarcos, on September 16, signed his fifth executive order, transferring the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).[168]\n\nIn an attempt to \"accelerate reconstruction and recovery efforts\" in Marawi, on December 22, 2023, Marcos signed an administrative order abolishing the Task Force Bangon Marawi and directing regular line agencies to take over the rehabilitation of the city. Marcos further ordered the agency's unused funds to be surrendered to the Office of the President.[169]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nThrough Proclamation No. 297, Marcos lifted the state of public health emergency issued in March 2020 by President Duterte following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proclamation lifted all established medical protocols, including the mandatory use of face masks; it also allowed emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for vaccines to remain for one year in order to exhaust the remaining vaccines.[170][171][172]\n\nMarcos allowed the controversial Vape Regulation Bill to lapse into law on July 25.[173] The bill has been approved in January 2022 by both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the 18th Congress, but has been transmitted to Malacañang for Duterte to act upon only on June 24, six days before his presidency ended.[174]\n\nThe Department of Health (DOH) launched on July 26 its \"PinasLakas\" campaign to continue administering COVID-19 booster doses to at least 39 million Filipinos, or 50% of the eligible population of 77 million, in Marcos's first 100 days of presidency. In September, the DOH lowered its target population to 23 million after seeing minimal progress in the booster campaign, which DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire attributed to pandemic fatigue. By the end of Marcos's first 100 days, a total of 20 million Filipinos received their booster doses,[175] of which 3.4 million received their first booster doses under the administration's booster campaign.[176]\n\nOn August 31, Cebu City mayor Michael Rama signed an order making the wearing of face masks \"non-obligatory\" in his city,[177] prompting the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to raise the issue of the lifting of face masks before the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).[178] The DOH maintained that face masks give 80% protection against COVID-19 and other contagious diseases, and expressed worry that other local government units would follow Rama's action;[179] the DOH later agreed to allow the lifting of face masks only among low-risk individuals and in low-risk settings. On September 12, Marcos signed his third executive order, allowing voluntary use of face masks in outdoor settings with good ventilation.[180] Following the recommendation of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, Marcos, on September 13, signed a proclamation extending from September 13, 2022, to December 31, 2022, the period of the state of calamity declared by his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, due to the COVID-19.[181]\n\nTo provide medical assistance to more people, in August 2023, Marcos signed a law establishing specialty centers in government hospitals in every region.[182]\n\nInfrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Build Better More\n\nThe Marcos administration decided to continue the Build! Build! Build! infrastructure program of President Duterte by superseding it with the Build Better More (BBM) program which added more infrastructure projects.[183][184] The Marcos administration approved 194 infrastructure projects, with a total cost of PHP 9-trillion.[185] It includes projects in public transport, physical connectivity, water resources, digital connectivity, health, agriculture, and power; 77 of these projects were carried from past administrations while 123 are \"new and initiated\" by the Marcos administration.[186]\n\nOn August 23, the Marcos administration requested ₱1.196 trillion from Congress to fund in 2023 its BBM infrastructure program.[187]\n\nPublic housing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marcos administration aims to build 1 million housing units annually to address the country's backlog of 6.5 million housing units.[188] Twenty-eight local government units (LGUs) have signed a memorandum of understanding with the DHSUD to pursue housing projects; 11 of them are in the construction stage.[189] As of April 19, 2023, about 1.2-1.3 million housing sites have been started since Marcos assumed office.[190]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2023 Philippine airspace closure\n\nThe Marcos administration promised to improve the transportation system of the Philippines and said it will pursue more projects.[191][192][193] Marcos pursued the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP), which will phase out old traditional jeepneys and replace them with modern public utility vehicles; it resulted in a weeklong nationwide transport strike in March 2023, forcing Marcos to order the government to review the PUVMP \"to ensure that everything is taken into consideration under the program, including the grievances of our drivers and operators\".[194]\n\nIn July 2022, former Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III canceled the loan applications for three China-funded railway projects—the PNR South Long Haul, Subic-Clark Railway, and the Mindanao Railway (Tagum-Davao-Digos)—due to China's inaction on funding requests by the Duterte administration during Duterte's tenure.[195] A month later, the Marcos administration resumed talks with China to renegotiate and \"resume\" the major railway projects, with the Transportation department citing the funding will \"strengthen bilateral relations and enhance the partnership between the Philippines and China\".[196]\n\nOn July 1, a day after his inauguration, Marcos signed a memorandum seeking to provide free train rides to students, and extend the free EDSA Carousel rides until December 2022.[197][198] Shortly after, the free train rides for students was recalibrated and limited only to LRT-2; the Department of Transportation said that train fares were \"already heavily subsidized\", especially when free train rides were implemented at MRT-3 for three months during the Duterte administration, and that Line 2 has the highest number of student ridership.[199]\n\nIn August, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board started reopening several pre-pandemic public utility vehicle routes in Metro Manila in preparation for face-to-face classes.[200][201]\n\nInsurgency\n\n[edit]\n\nTo harmonize the Bangsamoro peace agreements of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement, the 1996 Final Peace Agreement and the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity facilitated the participation of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA). On August 14, Marcos appointed new members of the BTA, and included Abdulkarim Misuari and Nurrheda Misuari, son and daughter of Moro National Liberation Front leader Nur Misuari, in an effort to unite former warring members of the MNLF and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front under one Bangsamoro autonomous government.[202][203]\n\nCommunist policy\n\n[edit]\n\nAmid the weakening of the communist fronts by the military, in May 2023, Marcos directed the \"recalibration\" of the NTF-ELCAC to shift its previous \"aggressive\" policy and become \"bringers of peace\".[204] Marcos appointed Vice President Sara Duterte as co-vice chair of the NTF-ELCAC.[205] As part of his administration's peace initiatives, in November 2023, Marcos granted amnesty to former rebels of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF), Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF); he also granted amnesty to members of the Rebolusyonaryong Partido ng Manggagawa ng Pilipinas/Revolutionary Proletarian Army/Alex Boncayao Brigade (RPMP-RPA-ABB).[206]\n\nIn a surprise reversal of Duterte's policy, Marcos announced in November 2023 the revival of peace talks with the communists, a move critics see as a grave mistake. Negotiations between the Marcos administration and the NDF began in Oslo as early as 2022, but were withheld to the public.[207]\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled in May 2024 that red-tagging threatens a person's right to life, liberty, or security, Human Rights Watch and Karapatan called on Marcos to abolish the NTF-ELCAC. Marcos rejected the calls for abolition, saying the task force was instrumental in reducing the country's internal security threat.[208][209]\n\nSocial policies\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 2, Social Welfare (DSWD) Secretary Erwin Tulfo revealed that Marcos ordered for the list of 4Ps beneficiaries to be \"cleaned\" due to reports of unqualified beneficiaries receiving cash grants and refusing to surrender their accounts.[210] About 1.3 million beneficiaries identified by the social welfare department as no longer poor were to face removal from the cash assistance program, which may free ₱15 billion to be distributed to \"other qualified persons\".[211] In late August, the DSWD earmarked ₱500 million to be distributed as cash assistance for poor students, prohibiting walk-ins after an initial chaotic distribution involving beneficiaries gathering in huge crowds at the central and regional offices of the DSWD;[212] by September 24, 676,922 students nationwide received cash aid, which totaled ₱1.652 billion, in the DSWD's six-week program.[213]\n\nOn July 30, Marcos vetoed a bill granting tax exemption on poll workers' honoraria; he cited the bill will \"negate the progressivity of the reforms introduced under RA 10963 or the TRAIN law\".[214]\n\nLabor\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Kuwait suspended all types of visas issued to Filipinos in May 2023, Marcos rejected proposals to impose a total deployment ban against Kuwait, saying he did not want to \"burn any bridges\"; he maintained the Philippine government will continue negotiating with Kuwait to improve the situation.[215]\n\nPoverty alleviation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2023, Marcos appointed Marcos loyalist and disbarred lawyer Larry Gadon in a newly created position, the presidential adviser on poverty alleviation, which has a monthly salary grade of ₱278,434.[216][217] Gadon said his first project would be to launch \"BBM: Batang Busog, Malusog\", a feeding program for the youth.[218]\n\nTelecommunications\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2022, the Marcos administration launched the BroadBand ng Masa Program (BBMP) to provide free WiFi connections in remote areas.[219] To \"boost government initiatives against scams committed through text and online messages\", Marcos signed his first law, which mandated SIM card registration;[220] by the end of the July 2023 deadline, a total of 113.9 million SIM cards were registered, and about 54 million unregistered mobile numbers were deactivated.[221]\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2023, the Marcos administration's tourism department launched a new branding campaign worth ₱49 million; it included a new tourism slogan \"Love the Philippines\" which replaced the decade-old \"It's More Fun in the Philippines\". The tourism department contracted a creative agency, DDB Philippines, to produce a campaign video. A few days later, the tourism department deleted the video from its Facebook page after Agence France Presse had the video analyzed and confirmed that stock footages of places in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Indonesia, and Switzerland were used in the video.[222][223] Shortly after, the tourism department, under Secretary Christina Frasco, terminated its branding campaign contract with DDB Philippines; Frasco asserted no public funds were spent on the video,[224] and decided to continue using the new slogan.[225] Marcos then said he still trusts Frasco despite the stock video controversy.[226]\n\nIn an effort to enhance the overall experience of tourists in the country, the Department of Tourism (DOT), under Secretary Christina Frasco, began establishing Tourist Rest Areas (TRAs) in strategic areas across the Philippines in 2022.[227] By June 2024, about nine TRAs had been constructed by the DOT and turned over to the various local government units; at least 20 more TRAs are awaiting construction.[228]\n\nForeign affairs\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos sought to continue his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte's \"friends to all, enemies to none\" approach to foreign policy.[229] Under Marcos, who pursued improved relations with the United States, China-Philippine relations became tense.[230]\n\nFollowing a French court of arbitration ruling instructing Malaysia to pay $14.9 billion to the descendants of the Sulu Sultanate for breaching an international private lease agreement by not paying the cession money under the agreement since 2013,[231] Malacañang, on August 2, said that the claim to Sabah is \"not an issue of sovereignty\" as it is \"in the nature of a private claim\".[232]\n\nMarcos made his inaugural state visits in Indonesia from September 4 to 6, and Singapore from September 6 to 7, securing $USD14.36 billion (₱804.78 billion) in investment pledges.[233] On September 18 to 24, he made his first working visit to the United States, where he attended the 77th United Nations General Assembly and received $3.9 billion in investment pledges.[234] Marcos was criticized upon his unannounced return to Singapore in October 1 to 2 to watch the F1 Grand Prix; Malacañang later confirmed Marcos's trip as \"productive\" in enjoining continued foreign investment in the country with Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin later explaining that the visit was \"partly official, partly personal\".[235][236]\n\nChina and the South China Sea\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon his election as president, Marcos pledged to continue outgoing president Duterte's policy of strengthening relations with China, whom he labeled the Philippines' \"strongest partner.\"[237] Marcos sought to resolve the territorial disputes in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea),[238] \"through diplomacy and dialogue\",[239] further urging his fellow ASEAN leaders to complete a code of conduct for the South China Sea in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea signed between ASEAN and China in 2002.[240]\n\nWhile campaigning for president in January 2022, Marcos promised to \"set aside\" the South China Sea Arbitration in favor of direct negotiations with the Chinese government over the disputes, stating that the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling was \"no longer available\" to the Philippine government because China, among many other parties, had rejected it.[241] However, following his election in May, then-president-elect Marcos reversed his previous stance and declared he would uphold the Arbitration ruling, vowing to invoke the ruling \"to assert [the Philippines'] territorial rights\" if and where necessary.[242]\n\nWhile addressing the Asia Society in New York City in September 2022, Marcos clarified that his country has \"no territorial conflict with China\" but rather, \"China [is] claiming territory that belongs to the Philippines.\" He acknowledged the necessity of closer cooperation with his country's allies if the disputes escalated to war, as China's military capabilities are nearly 15 times \"stronger\" than the Philippines.[243]\n\nUnited States and the West\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike President Duterte, whose foreign policy lessened the country's dependence on the United States, Marcos strengthened the Philippines' relations with its traditional ally.[244][245]\n\nMarcos shifted the Philippines' defense policy by approving five additional sites across the country for the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement following the visit of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Manila in February 2023,[246] risking invoking China's fury and dragging the Philippines into a US-China conflict over Taiwan.[247][248]\n\nAmid growing tensions between China and Taiwan, in August 2022, Marcos and United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed both countries' commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty.[249]\n\nInternational Criminal Court\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos asserts that his administration does not intend for the Philippines to re-apply for International Criminal Court (ICC) membership following the country's withdrawal from the international tribunal under his predecessor that took effect in March 2019.[250] In 2023, the Marcos administration submitted two separate requests in February and March to suspend the ICC's probe into the war on drugs during Duterte's presidency and the killings in the Davao area between November 2011, and June 2016; the administration argued that the Philippine government is investigating and has already investigated cases of alleged crimes against humanity, and that the ICC investigation would encroach on the Philippines' sovereignty.[251][252] After the ICC rejected the Philippines' requests, Marcos, on March 28, said the Philippines is \"disengaging\" from any contact and communication with the ICC, saying he considers the ICC jurisdiction over the Philippines as an interference and \"practically attacks on the sovereignty\".[251]\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcos has expressed opposition to the war between Russia and Ukraine during his presidency. In the early days of the conflict, while he was still campaigning, Marcos initially suggested there was no immediate need for the Philippines to take a stand on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He has since called for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, stating that the confrontation should be resolved through diplomatic channels rather than continued military engagement. Marcos cited the extensive repercussions of the war, particularly its impact on global economies and food supply chains, as reasons for his stance.[253]\n\nOn June 3, 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Manila to invite Marcos to a peace summit in Switzerland later that month. Marcos assured Zelenskyy of Philippine participation in the summit, which the European leader said sent \"a very strong signal\". Following Zelenskyy's request, Marcos pledged to send mental health professionals to assist soldiers in Ukraine.[254]\n\nOpinion polling\n\n[edit]\n\nOpinion polling, commonly known as surveys in the Philippines, on the presidency of Bongbong Marcos has been conducted by various pollsters since the start of his tenure. The tables below show the latest polls that were administered.\n\nA Pulse Asia September 2022 survey of 1,200 respondents nationwide revealed that the Marcos administration received high approval ratings on its addressing of 11 of 13 key issues in the country; calamity response and controlling the spread of COVID-19 were both rated the highest, at 78%, while performance in poverty reduction (39%) and control of inflation (31%) ranked the lowest.[255]\n\nApproval ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nTrust ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nProtests\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Protests against Bongbong Marcos\n\nProtests against President Bongbong Marcos have occurred mainly in the Philippines even before the inauguration of the president on June 30, 2022.[260] Protest have been mostly conducted by progressive and opposition groups due to the violent and plunderous legacy of the Marcos family during the martial law era and throughout the rule of his father, former President Ferdinand Marcos;[261] unpaid real-estate taxes;[260] alleged electoral fraud[260] during the 2022 presidential elections; instances of fake news and historical distortion;[260] cases of human rights violations such as extra-judicial killings and the continuing war on drugs;[262] and other social issues.[263][264] Protests against the president have also included grievances against Vice President Sara Duterte[265] as well as seeking of accountability from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.[266] Mobilizations have also been held by Filipino-Americans and other solidarity and progressive groups abroad such as in United States, Australia, and Canada.[264]\n\nFormer President Duterte and his supporters have also organized protests against Marcos.[267] In a \"prayer rally\" held in Cebu City, the former president made numerous remarks denouncing Marcos' People's Initiative and the subsequent economic constitutional amendments.[268] During the rally, Duterte also made statements alluding to the deposal of President Marcos similar to his father yet through military force.[269] In the same rally, Duterte called President Marcos a drug addict,[270] Marcos responded that Duterte's use of fentanyl impaired his judgement.[271] Duterte has since softened his position [272] yet states that him and his coalition are no longer allies with President Marcos, reinforced by Vice President Sara Duterte stating that the Uniteam Alliance was dissolved immeadietly after the 2022 Philippine General Election.[273]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
