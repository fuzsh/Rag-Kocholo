Prior to becoming president, he served in government from the 1980s to the 2010s as senator, congressman, governor, and vice governor.\n\nEarly life and public service\n\nBongbong is the scion of a prominent political family in the Philippines. He was born to Ferdinand Marcos, who would rule the Philippines for 20 years, and to Imelda Romualdez Marcos, who would wield great power as first lady during her husband’s rule. His father’s regime, noted for its authoritarian nature and corruption—the family had looted the Philippines’ economy of billions of dollars—was overthrown by a popular uprising (known as People Power Revolution) in 1986, which resulted in the Marcos family going into exile in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, after graduating from elementary school in the Philippines, Bongbong completed (1974) his secondary education at Worth School, a private boarding school in West Sussex, England. He then attended the University of Oxford to study social sciences but reportedly did not complete an undergraduate degree; he was instead awarded a special diploma in 1978. Shortly thereafter Bongbong enrolled (1979–81) in the business administration graduate program at the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania; however, he did not graduate.\n\nBongbong started his political career in 1981 when he became vice governor in his home province of Ilocos Norte. After serving in that role, Bongbong continued to steadily build his reputation in government, becoming governor of the province twice (1983–86 and 1998–2007), a member of the House of Representatives for Ilocos Norte’s 2nd district twice (1992–95 and 2007–10), and a member of the Senate (2010–16). While serving as senator, Bongbong worked on resolutions to support Filipinos working overseas and on environment-related projects.\n\nAscent to the presidency\n\nIn 2016 Bongbong ran for vice president of the country; however, Filipino lawyer Leni Robredo defeated him by a small margin. In 2021 Bongbong announced his bid to become the country’s president through a video he posted on YouTube and Facebook. During the 2022 presidential campaign, Bongbong emphasized the unity of the country, which some analysts viewed as an attempt to move past his family’s controversies. Bongbong also advocated for tackling inflation and poverty.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

His support was further propped up when he formed an alliance with vice presidential candidate Sara Duterte, the former mayor of Davao City and the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, who was president of the Philippines at the time. The alliance between Marcos and Duterte showed two powerful political families in apparent unity. However, President Duterte was heavily criticized for alleged extrajudicial killings, which resulted in more than 12,000 deaths, and human rights violations during his “war on drugs” campaign, and some were concerned that Bongbong would adopt harsh policies similar to those of President Duterte or of his father. In response to such concerns and to further differentiate himself from his father, Bongbong said in a speech in 2022, “To the world: Judge me not by my ancestors, but by my actions.” Some, however, criticized Bongbong for intentionally ignoring the abuses by his father and spreading disinformation by recasting his father’s rule as a “golden age.”\n\nThe presidential election was held on May 9, 2022, and Bongbong was officially declared the next president on the 25th. He reportedly won by a landslide with more than 31 million votes, about 58.8 percent of the total vote, the highest margin of victory in the country since 1981. Robredo—who had defeated Bongbong in the 2016 vice presidential election—placed second, with about 28 percent of the total vote.\n\nThe Bongbong presidency\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Bongbong was sworn in as the 17th president of the Philippines, signifying the Marcos family’s successful political rehabilitation since exile. Early in his presidency, Bongbong focused on economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, while president-elect, he had appointed himself agricultural secretary, which gave him direct responsibility to tackle challenges in the agricultural sector as well as inflation of food products. In January 2023 Bongbong signed an executive order to adopt a six-year development plan (officially the Philippine Development Plan) to help with the economic recovery.\n\nIn foreign policy, Bongbong showed interest in developing closer ties with the United States, in contrast to his predecessor, who appeared to have steered away from such relations. Bongbong’s efforts to strengthen the alliance have been apparent: in April 2023 he hosted the largest military exercise between the two countries, and in May he visited Washington, D.C., to meet with several U.S. political leaders, including Pres. Joe Biden. While visiting the United States, Bongbong agreed to further strengthen ties between the two countries as well as to clarify the conditions under which the United States would come to the Philippines’ defense (per the 1951 mutual defense treaty signed by the two countries) in light of territorial disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.\n\nIn March 2023 Bongbong stated that the Philippines would not rejoin the International Criminal Court (ICC); former president Duterte had withdrawn from it in March 2019 in response to the ICC’s preliminary investigation into the alleged extrajudicial killings during his drug war campaign. Furthermore, Bongbong indicated that he would suspend any contact with the ICC after it rejected the Philippines’ appeal to end the investigation, as the country was conducting its own inquiries into the extrajudicial killings."
