        "text": "It’s a campaign about nothing: as gentle and ephemeral as the breeze that spins its emblem, a magical white pinwheel.\n\nYet gauzy ads and flashy rallies are about to bring Bongbong Marcos — the son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda, the world’s most notorious shoe fetishist — to the pinnacle of power in the Philippines.\n\nA Marcos campaign spot released last weekend, days before the nation’s May 9 presidential election, shows off his slick yet content-free rhetoric.\n\n“Close your eyes and forget about your worries,” a little girl sings in Filipino.\n\n“As long as we’re together, our mornings will always be beautiful,” beaming supporters chorus as they gather around Marcos, 64 — who notched a massive 33-point lead over current Vice President Leni Robredo, his nearest rival, in the latest national poll.\n\n“Together we will rise again!” he promises.\n\nIf the survey numbers hold, Marcos will win the presidency with 56 percent of the vote in a 10-candidate field, an unprecedented margin in modern Filipino history.\n\nNot since the EDSA or “People Power” revolution of 1986, when the Marcos family was driven into exile after looting up to $10 billion of the nation’s wealth, has any presidential candidate won an outright majority.\n\nThat means Bongbong could become the most popular incoming president since Ferdinand Marcos himself, in one of the most stunning political resurrections of all time.\n\nAnd observers are spooked.\n\n“The absence of any concrete and coherent platform of government means there is no reliable way to measure [his] readiness … to govern the country,” said Michael Henry Yusingco, a senior research fellow at Manila’s Ateneo Policy Center. “There is a very real fear … that authoritarian rule can return.”\n\nBongbong — né Ferdinand Jr., he is nicknamed for his childhood habit of clinging to his father’s back like a bumbong, a bamboo tube traditionally used to carry water — seems to believe this is his destiny.\n\n“She’s wanted me to become president since I was three years old,” he said of his mother in 2015. “Imagine how disappointed she is.”\n\nHe was eight when Ferdinand was first elected president. In 1965, the Marcos family moved into Manila’s Malacanang Palace from their sleepy home province of Ilocos Norte.\n\nThere they remained for more than 20 years, as Ferdinand and Imelda imposed their autocratic rule — and plundered the treasury to feed their insatiable extravagance.\n\nFerdinand imposed martial law in 1972, becoming the nation’s de facto dictator. Up to 70,000 Filipinos were arrested and held as political prisoners; many were tortured, and 3,200 died in custody. He outlawed independent media and stuffed the military with loyalists. Meanwhile, he ran up massive foreign debts that tanked the economy and siphoned borrowed cash to pay off relatives and cronies.\n\nWhen a young Bongbong would come home from boarding school, he hosted shooting parties on Calauit Island, Imelda’s private animal sanctuary, which she stocked with giraffes and zebras imported from Africa — and cleared of the 254 humans who had lived there for generations. Filipinos called it “Bongbong’s Safari Park.”\n\nLater, when he came to the US for college, Imelda bought him two suburban spreads in Cherry Hill, N.J. — one for Bongbong to live in, another for his entourage — and gave him a $10,000 monthly allowance, paid out of multiple US bank accounts funded by the treasury of the Philippines.\n\nIt’s been reported that Imelda once had a private plane turn around when she realized there was no cheese onboard. Staying at New York City’s Waldorf Towers, “she tipped bellboys $100 and kept a standing order for $1,000 in fresh flowers daily,” according to People. On one such trip, she snapped up $1.43 million of Bulgari jewels; on another, in 1981, she spent $4.5 million on art and furniture.\n\nThe Post’s Cindy Adams has written about how Imelda “built a new theater, open on three sides. One day before showtime, a killer hurricane headed for the island of Leyte. We panicked. Imelda ordered her air force to ‘seed the clouds.’ What that meant, I didn’t understand. I only know the hurricane floated out to a 50-mile radius surround and didn’t return for 24 hours.”\n\nThe 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, widely blamed on Ferdinand, led to his downfall. When a 1986 ballot-fraud scandal sparked a bloodless revolution, the family fled to Hawaii, where Ferdinand died in 1989.\n\n“I would amount to nothing there, so I needed to come home,” Bongbong said later.\n\nIn 1991, loyalists welcomed him back to Ilocos Norte and he plunged into politics, serving as governor, congressman and senator over a 30-year career.\n\nBut six years ago, when he lost his bid to become vice-president in the election won by incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, it seemed that national office might be beyond Bongbong’s grasp.\n\nIn the Philippines, the president and vice-president are elected separately and can only serve a single six-year term, under the new constitution ratified after his father’s ouster. The two positions almost always come from opposing parties.\n\nThe elections of May 2016 gave the vice-presidency to the Liberal Party’s Robredo, who edged out Bongbong by just 0.64 percent of the vote. Claiming ballot fraud, Bongbong launched a sore-loser lawsuit that was finally resolved in Robredo’s favor last year.\n\nThe left-leaning Robredo has spent her time as VP clashing openly with the populist Duterte. His violent war on drugs, which has killed at least 6,000 alleged dealers, has drawn international scorn — but made him popular among ordinary Filipinos.\n\nMeanwhile, the out-of-work Bongbong began a careful image makeover for his clan, using social media to woo young Filipinos.\n\n“A majority of voters today were born after the 1986 EDSA revolution,” Yusingco noted. “That huge segment of the electorate may have very little comprehension of the political and economic destruction caused by the Marcos dictatorship.”\n\nThe charm offensive began on YouTube in 2018. In more than 200 weekly video shorts, dubbed “BBM Vlogs,” Bongbong doled out sanitized morsels of family history amid appearances by his three sons — Sandro, now 28; Simon, 27; and Vinny, 25 — to draw millions of young fans. Liza, his attorney wife of 29 years, remains discreetly out of view. “I really like my anonymity,” she said in March.\n\nVarious episodes showed the modern Marcoses playing quiz games or reacting to TikTok videos made by supporters. In one, the boys had their father reach inside a closed box to identify different items (spaghetti, peanut butter, a live mouse) by touch.\n\nIn another clip, son Sandro — a London School of Economics grad with a substantial Instagram following who’s now running for a congressional seat — took his dad to a boutique for a wardrobe update, where Bongbong mugged for the camera while modeling crazy outfits.\n\n“The last 10 years, he still has the same clothes,” Sandro said with a shrug, subtly denying his family’s hidden riches. Bongbong has refused to release any information about his current finances, but a 2015 disclosure statement declared a net worth of about $4 million US, mostly in real estate and art.\n\nSeveral of the video segments whitewashed the reputation of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nBongbong has recalled private father-son memories — like the way Ferdinand, a former boxer, toughened him up with sparring sessions in his “BBM Vlog” videos, often while sharing family photos.\n\nIn 2018, he insisted that his father’s administration was an “objective success.”\n\n“What we hear from … those in opposition to him is more of a caricature,” he said. “The demonization doesn’t have any connection to what he really was as a man.”\n\nThe polarizing Imelda Marcos, now 92 and living in a Manila high-rise, has been seen only rarely in her son’s video campaign.\n\nIn a 2021 vlog episode, she proudly described the hospitals, theaters and housing projects constructed on her husband’s watch.\n\nAs her husband cracked down on the opposition, Imelda indulged her insatiable appetite for jewels, art, real estate, fashion and, of course, shoes. She swanned about the globe as the president’s emissary and hosted glamorous pals like actor George Hamilton and heiress Doris Duke at her 30-room Manhattan townhouse, her waterfront Long Island estate, or any of her dozens of luxe properties.\n\nThere is no mention in her video the 2,800 pairs of shoes she infamously left behind when she left Manila — or the estimated $5.5 billion of stolen assets that the state is still trying to claw back from her family.\n\nBongbong, meanwhile, claims complete ignorance about his clan’s loot.\n\n“I’m not familiar with the cases,” he said in a rare TV interview on April 26, when pressed on the whereabouts of money currently in litigation.\n\n“Let the courts do their work,” he added. “If a court orders us to do something, we’ll do it.”\n\nHe pooh-poohs critics who accuse him of pushing revisionist history about the Marcos regime.\n\n“If you don’t like what I’m saying, then don’t watch me,” he told Business Mirror last year. “I’m not spouting lies … that is my experience with my father.\n\n“The peddling of hate, what do we get from that?”\n\nThe current Marcos surge is fueled by his running mate, Sara Duterte, 43, the mayor of Davao City in the Philippines’ south — a job she inherited from her own father, the sitting president.\n\nLast fall, before Marcos announced his candidacy, polls showed him with just 15 percent of the vote. But joining forces with a Duterte vaulted him into front-runner status. Sara, too, looks like a shoo-in, with a 37-point lead over the second-place VP candidate.\n\nThe Philippines’ almost feudal political system — “nepotism plus plus, a dynasty on steroids,” as Bongbong’s sister Sen. Maria “Imee” Marcos ruefully described it in 2012, while she was the reluctant governor of Ilocos Norte — gives Sara Duterte a formidable power base of her own.\n\nWith the Marcos family’s domination of the northern Philippines, the double-dynasty ticket appeals to traditionalists, but also offers an alternative for disillusioned voters angry at the current establishment candidates they see as corrupt.\n\nBongbong and Sara “have certainly capitalized on a profound sense of frustration that has been brewing in Filipino society,” Yusingco said.\n\n“The segment brought in by the Duterte alliance are willing to turn a blind eye, if you like, to the atrocities of the Marcos dictatorship,” he said, explaining that their disdain for Manila’s political elite “is much stronger.”\n\nThat leaves the progressive candidates — including Robredo, ex-boxing champ Manny Pacquiao, Manila mayor and former actor Isko Moreno, and Sen. Panfilo Lacson — squabbling among themselves.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, Moreno scolded Robredo directly, saying that her tactics are “not effective against Marcos” and urging her to withdraw, but refusing to quit the race himself.\n\nBongbong and Sara Duterte, for their part, dubbed their ticket the “UniTeam” and launched a relentlessly upbeat campaign. Instead of the standard mud-slinging, they have blithely ignored their opponents.\n\nNeither has bothered to appear at debates or candidates’ forums, allowing them to float above the fight without engaging with critics — or laying out an actual platform.\n\n“Unity is the answer to achieve progress,” Bongbong has repeated at the 60 huge rallies they have held throughout the archipelago since February. “I run because my goal, my dream for our country, is to reunite the Filipino people.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bongbong and his loyalists deck themselves out in the crimson colors of the Marcos dynasty; the mayor and her team wear the Dutertes’ emerald green.\n\nImelda has not been allowed to make public appearances on her son’s behalf. “She’s a little frustrated,” Bongbong said last week. “But we say, Mom, it’s COVID.”\n\nPresident Duterte has also stayed out of the race — furious, it’s said, that his daughter chose not to go for the top slot.\n\nBongbong claims not to mind the snubbing. “I understand,” he said last month. “It’s good for the president to remain above the fray.”\n\nBut the pair’s apparent glide path to victory could signal danger ahead for the Philippines’ people, Yusingco said.\n\nAn overwhelming Marcos landslide, combined with a congress already dominated by political dynasties, will likely give the new president a compliant legislature unwilling to stand up to his excesses.\n\n“He will find himself in a political environment very similar to the one enjoyed by the dictator, Marcos Sr.,” Yusingco predicted.\n\nAnd Bongbong has never repudiated his father’s authoritarianism. Even the dictator’s harshest actions “came from love,” the likely soon-to-be president said in 2018.\n\n“His soft side,” Bongbong explained, “is what motivated him to do all of these hard things.”"
