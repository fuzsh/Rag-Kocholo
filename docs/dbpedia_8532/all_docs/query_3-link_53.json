        "text": "Sara Duterte, the eldest daughter of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, is to run for vice-president in next year's elections.\n\nThe move ends months of speculation about whether she was planning to run in the polls.\n\nShe had been widely expected to bid to succeed her father, who cannot stand for another term as president.\n\nMs Duterte, who is mayor of the major city of Davao, led opinion polls all year as the top presidential candidate.\n\nShe has joined a new political party (Lakas-CMD) headed by former President Gloria Arroyo, replacing another candidate who had withdrawn.\n\nShortly after filing her candidacy, she was picked as the running mate for Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the late Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who is running as president.\n\nIn the Philippines, the president and vice-president are elected separately.\n\nOther presidential candidates include popular former boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, and the mayor of Manila.\n\nMr Duterte, a controversial \"strongman\" figure, came to power in 2016 promising to reduce crime and fix the country's drug crisis.\n\nBut critics say that during his five years in power, Mr Duterte has encouraged police to carry out thousands of extrajudicial killings of suspects in what he has called his \"war on drugs\".\n\nThe International Criminal Court has called for a formal probe into the thousands of killings that happened during the deadly crackdown.\n\nMr Duterte had initially said he would stand as vice-president, before changing his mind last month and announcing his retirement from politics.\n\nHowever, reports emerged on Saturday - quoting his communications secretary - that he would file to stand as vice-president himself ahead of a 15 November deadline.\n\nDuterte senior \"will file his certificate of candidacy for the vice-presidency on Monday, that's what he said,\" presidential communications chief Martin Andanar told local broadcaster ABS-CBN.\n\nHowever, he said the outcome remains uncertain, adding: \"I would like to believe that that is the plan for now. We don't know if this will be the same plan by tomorrow or by Monday.\""
