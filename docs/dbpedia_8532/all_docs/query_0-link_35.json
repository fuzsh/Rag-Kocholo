        "text": "The Philippines is holding presidential elections on 9 May.\n\nAmong the controversial candidates are the daughter of the country's notorious outgoing president, the son of a former dictator and a world-famous boxer.\n\nWhen do the polls open, and when will the results be announced?\n\nMore than 67 million people are eligible to vote in the elections.\n\nPolling stations are open from 06:00 to 19:00 local time, and the results could be known just a few hours after they close.\n\nA total of 10 candidates are running for president.\n\nWho are the main candidates?\n\nFerdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr\n\nThe current frontrunner for president is Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, son of the former president, Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nPresident Marcos declared martial law in 1972 and took control of the country's courts, businesses and media. The army and police arrested and tortured thousands of dissidents.\n\nHe, his wife Imelda Marcos and his cronies plundered an estimated $10bn from public funds. He was forced out of power in 1986 and died soon afterwards.\n\nBongbong Marcos was convicted in 1995 for tax evasion while serving as a public official, and his political opponents say that should disqualify him as a presidential candidate.\n\nCritics also say he has used his wealth to whitewash the history of his father's dictatorship on social media platforms.\n\nBongbong Marcos has also refused to take part in several prime-time TV debates and independent media interviews, citing perceived bias or unfavourable formats.\n\nSara Duterte\n\nSara Duterte is the daughter of the current president, hardliner Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nShe is running for vice-president alongside Bongbong Marcos.\n\nThey brand themselves the \"Uni-Team\" and have vowed to make the Philippines \"rise again\".\n\nWhile Ms Duterte wants to make military service mandatory for 18-year-olds, Bongbong Marcos says he's open to imposing the death penalty on criminals who cannot be rehabilitated.\n\nLeni Robredo\n\nThe main opponent to Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte is Leni Robredo, the current vice-president of the Philippines.\n\nMrs Robredo is a former lawyer and human rights advocate.\n\nHer supporters - who include many celebrities and leading figures in Philippines life - wear pink, her campaign colour.\n\nThey are hoping for a \"pink revolution\" to steer the country back to family values and the rule of law.\n\nCritics of Ms Robredo say she represents the elitist oligarchs of the Philippines. She is a member of the Liberal party, which has traditionally been connected with the richest and most powerful families in the country.\n\nManny Pacquaio\n\nAlso running for president is celebrated boxer Manny Pacquaio, who is now a senator. He is known as \"Pac-man\" to his fans.\n\nMr Pacquaio appeals to poor voters because of his rags-to-riches story.\n\nHe grew up starving and hungry in the southern city of General Santos and often slept in the streets as a youth. He went on to win 12 major world boxing titles and become one of the wealthiest sportsmen in the world.\n\nWhere are the Philippines?\n\nThe Philippines is a South East Asian country made up of more than 7,000 islands in the Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 110 million.\n\nIt was colonised first by Spain in 1565, by America in 1898 and then invaded by Japan in 1942. It gained full independence in 1946.\n\nWhat kind of country is it?\n\nThe Philippines has an emerging market economy with a stark rich-poor divide. The average income is $3,300 (£2,445) a year, and 26 million Filipinos live in poverty, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nThere are parts of the densely populated capital city, Metro Manila, where some people have to scavenge to survive. Elsewhere, the rich live in luxurious, gated communities.\n\nThe country is split into three main island groups - Luzon in the north, The Visayas in the centre and Mindanao in the south.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the country's dominant faith, although there is a large Muslim population in Mindanao.\n\nWhat are the main issues in the election?\n\nMay's presidential election takes place alongside elections for Congress and regional governments.\n\nThe key election issues are how to revive the Philippine economy from a sharp recession brought about by the Covid pandemic, and how to stamp out corruption in public office.\n\nAnother issue is China's increasing military presence in the seas between it and the Philippines, where it has been building strategic bases and using vessels to threaten Philippine shipping.\n\nWhat is the record of the current president, Rodrigo Duterte?\n\nPresident Duterte is close to the Marcos family.\n\nHe had the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos buried in the country's Heroes' Cemetery."
