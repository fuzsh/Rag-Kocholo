        "text": "Dick Van Dyke was one of many famous dads who spent Father's Day with his loving brood, taking to social media to share snippets from his day.\n\nThe legendary 97-year-old entertainer was joined by some of his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren at his spectacular estate and part-time Halloween haunt, Vandy Manor in Malibu.\n\nTake a look at more of the Disney Legend's family, spanning three generations and several more entertainers, starting with his four children.\n\nChristian Van Dyke\n\nThe eldest, Christian, 73, and his three siblings were born to Van Dyke and his first wife, Margie Willett, who he was married to from 1948-1984. (Dick married Arlene Silver in 2012, a make-up artist who is 40 years his junior.)\n\nLike many others in the family, Christian made his acting debut in a 1962 episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, playing the character of Frankie, and appeared as himself in the 1964 short Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere.\n\nMORE: Al Pacino's life with his three other children as he welcomes fourth child at 83 – see rare photos\n\nHowever, he didn't stick around in show business, opting to pursue law instead and earning a law degree from Arizona State University. In 1981, he was appointed district attorney in Marion County, Oregon.\n\nChristian has largely kept his personal life under wraps. He was first married to wife Caroline Heller. Their daughter Jessica died aged 13 in 1987 of Reye syndrome, a brain disease, which inspired Dick Van Dyke to star in several commercials to spread awareness about the disease.\n\nChristian and Caroline eventually separated and in 1988, he married Christine Shihadeh, who he has been with since. It's unknown if they have any other children.\n\nBarry Van Dyke\n\nPossibly the most well-known of the Van Dyke children, Barry, 71, is an actor just like his dad, making his own TV debuts on The Dick Van Dyke Show and The New Dick Van Dyke Show in the '60s and '70s.\n\nMORE: Robert De Niro, 79, welcomes seventh child: all we know about his family\n\nHis most well-known credit, however, is detective Steve Sloan on the action-comedy-murder Diagnosis: Murder, which ran from 1993-2001 and also starred his famous dad. Many of their family members made cameos on Diagnosis: Murder as well.\n\nBarry has been married to Mary Carey since 1974, and they're parents to Carey, 47, Shane, 43, Wes, 38, and Taryn, 37. Through their four children, Barry and Mary are also grandparents to eight.\n\nMORE: Harrison Ford's rarely seen children and blended family with wife Calista Flockhart – photos\n\nWhile all of Barry and Mary's children have tried their hands at show business, Carey and Shane have been the most successful as actors and writers, even writing a spec script in 2019 which eventually became Olivia Wilde's 2022 film Don't Worry Darling.\n\nStacy Van Dyke\n\nStacy, who was born around 1955, has kept her life mostly away from the spotlight compared to her siblings, only making minor appearances in The New Dick Van Dyke Show in 1971, and Diagnosis: Murder in 1996.\n\nMORE: Matt Damon's four rarely-seen daughters and blended family with wife Luciana Barroso – see photos\n\nInstead, she pursued music, performing with the group the Barnstormers in the '70s in Arizona, where she lives now.\n\nIt was reported in 1979 that she married Barnstormers member Mike Breen, a singer-songwriter and guitarist, and they have two children, with their son Ryan also following in their footsteps as a musician.\n\nCarrie Beth Van Dyke\n\nThe youngest of the Van Dyke siblings, born in 1961, Carrie Beth also kept her life out of the spotlight, making two appearances in The New Dick Van Dyke Show in the '70s as well.\n\nLike her sister, she married a musician, Kevin McNally, who also played a recurring role in Diagnosis: Murder. She and sister Stacy's families share a close relationship, as evidenced by their social media.\n\nShe and Kevin are parents to two children as well, a son and a daughter, with their son Tyler also working as a musician and producer."
