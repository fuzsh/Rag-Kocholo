        "text": "Dick Van Dyke is enjoying his retirement in style.\n\nThe veteran entertainer has made a number of renovations on his three-bedroom, two-bathroom Malibu, California mansion in the 37 years he's owned it, as evident in newly-snapped exterior photos of the mansion that sits in a luxe gated community.\n\nThe West Plains, Missouri-born actor, 97, bought the home for $750,000 in September of 1986, and it is now estimated to be worth $7.7 million, according to Redfin.\n\nAmong the amenities the Mary Poppins star has set up in his home include a water slide into an adjacent pool, which features a bar, a surfboard and a boogie board. The outdoor area also includes a small patio area over a rectangular patch of grass.\n\nThe Hollywood legend's home also features a golf putting area, a dance studio, an art studio and an entertainment hut.\n\nThe Chitty Chitty Bang Bang actor - who has been married to wife Arlene Silver, 51, since 2012 - traverses around the property and community via a golf buggy and vintage caravan.\n\nThe Emmy-winning actor's home sits across 2,226 square feet and was built 50 years ago, in 1973.\n\nHe has been a staple in the community, hosting Halloween events at the one-of-a-kind abode in past years, according to Malibu Surfside News.\n\nThe October 31 celebrations included gestures such as special effects, animatronic humans and candy barrels, according to the paper.\n\nIn October of 2022, Van Dyke handed out $5 bills to people seeking employment at the Malibu Community Labor Exchange\n\n'Whenever I have some fives I come by,' Van Dyke told DailyMail.com. 'You can't do it all the time, though.'\n\nOne worker at the nonprofit organization described the actor as 'an angel from God' for his good deeds at the venue.\n\nThe Bye Bye Birdie star has seemingly recovered smoothly after being involved in an auto accident in March in Malibu.\n\nIn the March incident, Van Dyke was driving a Lexus LS 500 and careened into a gate, lacerating his lip and receiving stitches.\n\nWeeks after the incident, he told photographers he was 'sore all over' in the wake of the auto accident.\n\n'The airbag did not deploy, so I just did a face plant right into the steering wheel and it just made me a little dumber,' said the actor, who filmed a cameo for the soap opera Days of Our Lives earlier this year. 'I’m 97, all my friends are dead.'\n\nThe actor's name was in the headlines this week as Georgiana 'Noopy' Guy Rodrigues - the daughter of his late costar on The Dick Van Dyke Show, Rose Marie - spoke with Fox News about the behind-the-scenes ongoings of the CBS series, which ran from 1961 thru 1966.\n\nShe said that her mother Rose Marie and Mary Tyler Moore - who both died in 2017 - did not always get along as they played the respective roles of Sally Rogers and Laura Petrie.\n\n'Mary was up-and-coming,' Rodrigues said. 'There was a little bit of conflict between my mother and Mary on the show,' adding that 'they never became close.'\n\nShe said that the storyline of the series, created by the late Carl Reiner, gravitated to different areas over its five-season run.\n\n'Originally, my mother was told that the show was about the writers,' Rodrigues said. 'And then as the show progressed, it started to go more toward the home life with Dick and Mary.'\n\nRose Marie, who died December 28, 2017, spoke with the New York Post in August that year about her relationship with Moore, who had passed away in January of that year.\n\n'We were friendly enough but we weren’t very close,' Rose Marie said. 'Mary knew the minute she did the show how her life was going to be; she wanted to be a big star and she accomplished that.'\n\nShe said that when they worked on a 2004 reunion for the show, The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited, they 'got to be very close' and 'said to each other that we wasted a lot of time not being that close.'"
