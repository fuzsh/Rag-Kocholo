        "text": "Love Under the Big Top\n\nDorothy is in a serious relationship with a lawyer and jumps to the conclusion that he's on the verge of proposing. However, his announcement is a shocker: he's leaving law to become a circus clown. Meanwhile, Rose and Blanche put together a protest to save some dolphins.\n\nTwo of a Kind\n\nFrankie and Mike find themselves caught in the middle of a longstanding family feud when Frankie's Uncle Dutch (guest star Dick Van Dyke) contacts her dad, Tag, in an attempt to reunite and bury the hatchet with his estranged brother. Meanwhile, a fearful Sue receives her first detention ever for being caught going off campus for lunch and seeks advice from Axl on how to survive the ordeal unscathed.\n\nMy Brother, My Keeper\n\nDr. Kelso (Ken Jenkins) assigns J.D. (Zach Braff) to work on a patient with Dr.Townshend (Dick Van Dyke, \"Diagnosis Murder\") -- his longtime friend and colleague -- but things go downhill when Dr. Townshend insists on using his \"old school\" treatment method which proves to be an alien concept to an inept J.D. While Kelso defends his friend's technique, Dr. Townshend's lack of current medical knowledge forces Kelso to admit his mistake. Meanwhile, Carla (Judy Reyes) tells Turk (Donald Faison) she needs time to consider his proposal because she thinks he is still too immature, prompting Turk to invite his married brother (D.L. Hughley, \"The Hughleys\") for a visit to show Carla how seriously he is. In addition, Elliot (Sarah Chalke) learns the sex of Jordan's (guest star Christa Miller Lawrence) baby, but Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley) and his ex-wife can't agree if they want to know."
