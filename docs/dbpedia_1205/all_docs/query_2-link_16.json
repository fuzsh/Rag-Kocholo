        "text": "Dick Van Dyke has been entertaining the world for seven decades.\n\nThe multiple-award-winning singer, dancer, actor and comedian has had a storied career that's spanned the stage and screen, notably originating the role of Albert Peterson in Broadway's Bye Bye Birdie, for which he won a Tony Award, as well as taking centre-stage with classic roles in The Dick Van Dyke Show, Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\n\nHis life off the stage and screen, however, has been no less under the spotlight – with two near-death experiences, complicated marriages and military service, the 96-year-old, by all appearances, is as colourful in his personal life as in his professional life.\n\nREAD MORE: Brisbane woman's ravenous hunger caused by common condition\n\nCheated death twice under terrifying circumstances\n\nVan Dyke left high-school during his senior year in 1944 – three years after the United States started its engagement with WWII – to join the United States Army Air Forces as a pilot, but his near-death experiences were not from seeing combat.\n\nIn fact, Van Dyke was denied enlistment several times for being underweight before he was accepted to the service as a radio announcer, and he ultimately transferred to the Special Services to entertain troops across the Americas.\n\nIn 2004, Van Dyke received his high-school diploma, and six years later, the Diagnosis: Murder star fell asleep on a surf board – and awoke to the sight of fins encircling him.\n\n\"I woke up out of sight of land,\" Van Dyke told Craig Ferguson at the time. \"I started paddling with the swells and I started seeing fins swimming around me and I thought, 'I'm dead!'\"\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Charlotte joins royals at Commonwealth Games\n\nDick Van Dyke through the years: 1948-2018\n\nVan Dyke's fears of an untimely demise were eased when he realised the fins belonged to porpoises, and those porpoises actually helped push him back to the shore.\n\nIn 2013, Van Dyke once again was caught up in a scary situation, when his car burst into flames as he was driving along a freeway in California, and he was completely trapped in the vehicle.\n\nLuckily, a passer-by noticed someone was stuck inside the smoky Jaguar, and forced the car door open and dragged Van Dyke to safety. Two off-duty nurses, who happened to be nearby, also checked the veteran actor was okay – and he was, he didn't require further medical attention.\n\nVan Dyke even made a cheeky joke about the incident on Twitter the next day, writing, \"Used Jag for sale REAL CHEAP!!\" alongside a photograph of his wrecked car.\n\nREAD MORE: The cost of restaurant cancellations around the world\n\nDick Van Dyke's three great loves\n\nThe performer's love life is, in a word, complicated.\n\nIn 1948, Van Dyke married Margie Willett on the radio show Bride and Groom at Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. Van Dyke and Willett's marriage included the birth of four children – Christian, Barry, Stacy and Carrie Beth – but their relationship was troubled.\n\nVan Dyke has been open about his battle with alcoholism, and he once spent three weeks in hospital for alcoholism-related treatment. Weeks later, in 1972, Willett checked into the same hospital for treatment related to an addiction to prescription pills, and shortly after, she started to retreat to the couple's desert ranch more frequently as she pursued a sober lifestyle.\n\nREAD MORE: Monica Lewinsky calls out Beyoncé for crude Bill Clinton lyrics\n\nIt was at this time Van Dyke began growing closer to Michelle Triola, his agent's secretary.\n\n\"She was easy to talk to, she understood me,\" he wrote of Triola in his 2012 memoir My Lucky Life In And Out Of Show Business. \"I was drawn into a relationship. I was involved with a woman other than my wife. It was unbelievable. I was writhing in guilt. By 1976 I had to do something. I needed to be honest.\"\n\nIn 1976, Van Dyke and Willett separated, but the former couple didn't divorce until 1984 – at that stage, they had been married for 36 years. Willett, in 2008, died of pancreatic cancer, which is something Van Dyke said \"deeply affected\" him.\n\n\"Even though we were long divorced, with her death I lost a part of myself,\" he said of Willett.\n\nREAD MORE: Richard Wilkins pays tribute to 18-year-old daughter for her birthday\n\nWithin one year of his ex-wife's passing, Triola, the Night at the Museum star's then-partner, died from lung cancer. The duo had been together since 1976.\n\n\"She spent her last week in a coma,\" Van Dyke explained in his memoir of Triola's passing in 2009. \"Her doctor said she could still hear, so I sang and talked to her until the hospice nurses told me she was gone.\"\n\nThree years later, he married Arlene Silver, a make-up artist. The duo had met in 2006 at the SAG Awards, and at the time of their wedding, Van Dyke was 86 and Silver was 40.\n\n\"She's just delightful, a great cook and a woman of great patience,\" Van Dyke told Closer of Silver in 2020. \"She's given me a third life, and I'm tickled to death with it.\"\n\nLast year, the couple made headlines for their sweet dance to 'Everybody Loves a Lover' ahead of their 10-year wedding anniversary. Watch above.\n\nREAD MORE: Dane Cook, 50, engaged to Kelsi Taylor, 23, after five years of dating\n\nWhat Dick Van Dyke is up to now\n\nVan Dyke, despite being 96, is in no way retired – his most recent film is Capture the Flag, which is currently in pre-production, and prior to that, in 2018, Van Dyke played Angel in Buttons: A Christmas Tale. That same year, he notably made a cameo a Mr. Dawes Jr. in Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nThe Murder 101 star's last television role was as the voice of Hopscotch the Sasquatch in Kidding in 2020, and his last stage role was as himself for two days in 2006 with Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Van Dyke's estimated net worth is $US50 million (approx. $72.2 million).\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
