He has one older brother, Christian Van Dyke, and two younger sisters, Stacy Van Dyke and Carrie Beth Van Dyke. Barry's TV debut was as \"Florian\", a violin-toting nine-year-old in The Talented Neighborhood (1962) episode of the classic Dick van Dyke Show (1961) show. He worked behind the scenes on subsequent ventures of his father's, and has co-starred with him in three series, The Van Dyke Show (1988), Diagnose: Mord (1993) and Murder 101 (2006).

They have four children, Carey Van Dyke, Shane Van Dyke, Wes Van Dyke and Taryn Van Dyke. All four children have guest-starred with their Dad and Grandpa, in scripts written by Barry, on Diagnose: Mord (1993). Barry is an avid motorcyclist with special enthusiasm for dirt bikes.
