        "text": "De Geer (also: De Geer van Jutphaas and De Geer van Oudegein) is a family of Walloon origin (the name possibly derived from the town of Geer near Liège) which became notable in Sweden and the Netherlands. They have played an important role in Swedish and Dutch history since the early 17th century, mainly centered around the iron foundry company town Finspång, but often extending to science, art and national politics. The family retained its contacts with the Netherlands even after the main branch settled in Sweden. Some of them hold the title count or baron. Both branches are still in existence and continue to thrive.\n\nNotable members"
