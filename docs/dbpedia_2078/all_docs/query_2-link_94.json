Compared with the previous fiscal year, the receipts for 1877 have decreased as follows: In customs revenue, $17,115,491 54; in proceeds of sales of public lands, $153,213 27; in sales of coin, $3,473,965 02; in semi-annual tax on banks, $250,022 33; in prize-money, $321,370 92; in sales of public property, $1,288,212 73; and in miscellaneous items, $934,512 81. There was an increase in the following items: In internal revenue, $1,929,675 80; in ^profits on coinage, $1,532,121 27; and in miscellaneous items, $1,593,539 01—making a net decrease in the receipts from all sources, for the year, of $18,481,452 54. The expenditures show a decrease a;s follows: In the War Department, $988,152 74; in the ISTavy Department, $4,003,374 46; in the Interior Department, $983,194 37; in civil and miscellaneous, $10,706,307 18; and in the interest on the pubhc debt, $3,118,759 65—due to the funding of six per cent, bonds ih new fives and four-and-a-half per cent, bonds— making a total reduction in all ofthe Departments of $19,799,788 40. The large apparent reduction in the expenses of the IsTavy Department, however, is not real; for, by reason of insufficient appropriations to pay the current liabilities of that Department, Congress has, by deficiency bill, during the recent session, appropriated the sum of $2,003,861 27, which is properly chargeable to the expenditures of the last year; but, including such deficiency, the reduction in receipts has been nearly met by the reduction of expenditures. I t will also be noticed that more than one-half of this reduction has been made in the civil and miscellaneous ex]3enditures, and is in part due to the reduction of the salaries and office-expenses of the civil officers and employ6s of the Government.

VII there wlU be a deficiency^t the close of the year of $11,438,796 38. The following estimates are in excess of the expenditures, for the same purposes, for the last fiscal year: Judicial Military establishment Naval establishment..,. Indian affairs Pensions Public works: War Department ISTavy Department Interior Department Department of Agriculture Postal service : '.... ' $8, 654 4,030, 790 . 2,246,783 138, 883 36,247 39 21 61 98 73 2,941,417 1, 526,228 221, 744 8, 910 2, 059,112 53 65 00 00 28 Assuming that Congress will not increase the aggregate national taxation at a time when aU industries are oppressed by the weight of local taxation, the Secretary recommends that the aggregate appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30,1879, exclusive of interest and sinking-fund, should not exceed $140,000,000. This will require the appropriations to be reduced at least $11,000,000 below the estimates submitted above—a reduction that, in the opinion of the Secretary, can be made without crippling any branch of the public service. Eeduction in public expenditures cannot be secured merely by a reduction of appropriations. I t must be accompanied by a careful revision of tlie laws which fix the salary and number of employes; by a reduction of the amount expended on public works now in progress; by postponement of all new works not indispensable for the public ser^dce; .\"and by judicious scrutiny of disbursements. The rapid appreciation of our current money to the coin standard should be accompanied by diminished expenses in the pubhc service. The revenue from duties on imports having largely diminished, the expenses of its collection should be reduced. Old claims should be closely scrutinized; and any increase in any branch of public expenditure should be arrested. The Secretary will not undertake, in this report, to revise the estimates of the different Departments—many items of which are submitted without recommendation—but urges that the apprppriations based upon them, including the amount estimated for the sinking-fund, should not, in any event, exceed in the aggregate the estimated revenues of the Government. SINKING-FUND. In the last annual report, (page x,) my predecessor stated that, had the resources of the Treasury during each fiscal year, coinmencing with VIII REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. 1862, been sufficient to make a literal comphance with the conditions of the sinking-fund law practicable, a total of $433,848,215 37 would have been applied to that fund July 1, 1876, whereas the actual reduction of the debt, including accrued interest,\" less cash.in the Treasury at that date, amounted to $658,992,226 44. On the same basis the amount in the sijiking-fund would have reached $475,318,888 78 on the 1st of July, 1877, on which datethe reduction of'the debt, includ\" ing accrued mterest, less cash in the Treasury, since its highest point in 1865, amounted to $696,273,348 17, or $220,954,459 39 in excess of the amount required by law to be proAdded for that fund. FUNDING, ETC. The contract of August 24, 1876, made by the Secretary^of the Treasury with certain parties, for the negotiation of $300,000,000 four -and one-half per cent, bonds, had so far been executed on the 1st of March, 1877, that $90,000,000 had been sold to the associated contractors, and calls had been made for the redemption of a like amount of five-twenty bonds. While the contract expired in terms on the 30th day of June, 1877 it contained a stipulation that it might be terminated by the Secretary of the Treasury, upon ten days' notice, after the 4th of March, 1877. In May last it became apparent to the Secretary that, by a favorable change in the money market, four per cent, bonds could be sold at par? in coin, with great advantage to the Government; and, availing him\" self of the privilege secured by the contract, he gave notice that he would limit the sale of four and one-half per cent, bonds to $200,000,000. On the l l t h day of May it was agreed that a portion of the latter should be sold under the authority of the resumption act for resump. tion purposes, and subscriptions were rapidly made until the aggregate reached $200,000,000, of which $185,000,000 were applied to the redemption of an equal amount of six per cent, bonds. On the Oth day of June, 1877, the Secretary entered into a contract with a portion of the previously-associated parties for the sale at par, in coin, of the four per cent, bonds of the United States,' authorized to be issued by the refunding act. This contract was, in substance, similar to previous contracts, but was to terminate on the 30th day of June, 1878, with the right reserved to the Unite'd States to terminate it at any time after the 31st of December, 1877, by giving ten days notice thereof to the contracting parties. This contract also contained a stipulation, as follows: ^^It is also agreed that the parties of the second part.shall offer to REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. IX the people of the United States at par and accrued interest in coin, the four per cent, registered consols and four per cent, coupon consols of the denominations of $50 and $100 embraced in this contract, for a period of thirty days from the public notice of such subscriptions, and in such cities and upon such notice as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe prior to the opening of the lists; and further, to offer to the subscribers the option of paying in instalments extending through three months.\" Under this contract, invitations having been published, subscriptions to this loan were opened on the 16th of June, 1877. Within the period of thirty days thereafter the subscriptions had reached the sum of $75,496,550, which were payable within ninety days from the date of subscription, or on or before the 16th of October. Every subscription to these bonds has been paid, and of the proceeds $50,000,000 have been applied to the redemption of an equal amount of six per cent^ bonds. The residue has been applied to resumption, purposes, as hereafter stated. The annual reduction of interest on the public debt thus made is as follows: By the sale of $185,000,000 four and one-half per cent. bonds . $2, 775, 000 By the sale of $50,000,000 four per cent, bonds 1,.000, 000 , Aggregating 3, 775, 000 In October last, after the payment of the popular subscriptions, arrangements were perfected to open further subscriptions to the four per cent, loan, and a call was about to issue for ten millions of six per cent, bonds, but it was temporarily postponed by reason of the agitation of the repeal of the resumption act and the remonetization of silver, which the associates believed would prevent further sales of these bonds. For this reason they declined to offer them, and no further call of six per cent, bonds was therefore made. O n t h e 19th of June, pending the subscriptions, the Secretary informed the associates, in an official letter, that, as the Government exacts in payment for these bonds their face value in gold coin, it was not anticipated that any future legislation of Congress, or any action of any Department of the Government, would sanction or tolerate the redemption of the principal of these bonds, or the payment of the interest thereon, in coin of less value than the coin authorized by law at the time of their issue—being gold coin. The general confidence of the pubhc that so just a principle of good faith would be observed by the Government, no doubt, largely contributed to the success of the loan. Whatever policy the Government may adopt, at any time, in its- X REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. system of coinage, it should not reduce the value of the coin in which it pays its obligations below that it demanded and received. The Secretary earnestly urges Congress to give its sanction to this assurance. The high credit of the United States, the faithful observance of its pubhc obligations, the abundance of its wealth and resources, the rapid reduction of its debt, the great accumulation of savings among the people, the favorable state of foreign trade—all contribute to enable the United States to borrow both from its own people and in foreign markets on the most favorable terms. The Secretary does not doubt that, if no questions had arisen disturbing the pubhc credit, the six per cent, bonds would be rapidly paid off by the proceeds of the four per cent, bonds, sold at par in coin or its equivalent. The highest pubhc credit can be secured only by a constant observance of every public engagement, construed according to its letter and spirit. Thus far this course has been faithfully pursued by the United States. Without it, our ample resources and abihty to pay are of no avail. At a time when we are enjo^dng such credit, and rapidly securing the benefit of it by the reduction of the rate of interest from six to four per cent., it Avould seem to be a grievous error to raise a question about the coin in which the interest is payable. Self-interest alone, without respect to pride in public credit, would lead us to secure so great a benefit as would be the sa\\i.ng of one-thkd of the interest of the pubhc debt. Of the six per cent, loans about $660,000,000 are now redeemable at the pleasure of the United States, and of the whole debt $1,452,000,000 ^re redeemable before, or on the 1st of May, 1881. By the reduction of the interest, from six to four per cent., on the public debt now redeemable, there would be a saving of $13,200,000 annually, and bythe reduction to four per cent, of the interest on the total debt, redeemable by the 1st of May, 1881, there would be a saving of $22,006,205 50 per annum. Any measure that creates distrust or doubt will arrest this process, and, by disabling the United States from borrowing, will compel the continued payment of the high rate of six per cent. If, therefore, the public interests demand the issue .of silver dollars— a subject hereafter discussed—it is respectfully submitfeid to Congress that an express exception be made requiring that gold coin alone shall be paid for principal or interest on bonds issued to pubhc creditors, ^since February 12, 1873, the amount of Avhich is $592,990,700. These bonds have entered into the markets of the world. If the market REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XI value of the silver in the new coin is less than the gold dollar, a forced payment in the new coin is a repudiation of a part of this debt. The saving that would thus be made is utterly insignificant compared with the injury done to the public credit. And even as to bonds issued prior to February 12,1873, public policy and enlightened self-interest require us to pay them in the coin then in circulation and contemplated by both parties as the medium of payment. Silver dollars have not been in circulation in the United States since 1837, and since 1853 fractional silver coins have been in circulation and a legal tender only for limited sums, and have not been contemplated as the medium of payment since any considerable portion of the outstanding bonds were issued. The silver dollar was. In fact, more valuable than the gold dollar. I t does not become a nation like ours to avail itself of the market depreciation of silver to gain a smaU saving by the payment of silver dollars instead of the coin contemplated when the bonds were issued. A far greater saving and higher public honor can be secured by the sale of four per cent, bonds under the refunding act and the payment of outstanding bonds in gold coin. An assurance given by Congress of such payment would at once secure the complete success of the refunding process and greatly advance the present high credit of the United States. Another practical impediment in the sale of bonds was, that, under . the law, the Secretary could receive coin alone in payment for them, and the only existing coin that could be received, under the law, was gold coin. As this was not in general circulation, it was impracticable for^ the people to pay it into the Treasury for these bonds. Therefore, it became necessary to conduct all sales through third parties, who could receive bank-bills. United States notes, drafts, certificates, and other forms of commercial paper, and convert them into coin. The Secretary, therefore, recommends that he be authorized to sell such bonds either for coin or for its equivalent in United States notes. . . : RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS. By the resumption act approved January 14, 1875, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to redeem legal-tender notes to the amount of eighty per centum of the sum of natioiial-bank notes issued, and to continue such redemption, as circulating-notes are issued, until there shall be outstanding the sum of $300,000,000 of such legal-tender United States notes, and no more. In obedience to this act, there.have been issued, since March 1,1877, to national banks, $16,123,995 of circulating-notes, and there have XII REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. been redeemed, retired, and cancelled, $12,899,196 of United States notes, leaving outstanding, on the 1st instant, the sum of $351,3.40,288. By the same act it is provided that, on and after the first day of January, 1879, the Secretary of the Treasury shall redeem, in coin, the United States legal-tendernotes then outstanding, on their presentation for redemption atthe office ofthe assistant treasurer of the United States, in the city of New York, in sums of not less than fifty dollars. \"And, to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and provide for the redemption in this act authorized or required, he is authorized to use any surplus revenues, from timeto time, in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and to issue, sell, and dispose of, at not less than par, in . coin, either of the descriptions of bonds of the United States described in the act of Congress, approved July 14, 1870, entitled ^ An act to authorize the refunding of the national debt,' with like qualities, privileges, and exemptions, to the extent necessary to carry this act into full effect, and to use the proceeds thereof for the purposes aforesaid.\" In obedience to this provision, the Secretary has sold at par, for coin, $15,000,000 four and one-half per cent, bonds, or $5,000,000 during each of the months of May, June, and July last, and has sold $25,000,000 at par, in coin, of four per cent, bonds, or $5,000,000 for each of the months of August, September, October, November, and December. Of the coin thus received, $4,000,000 have been sold for the redemption of United States notes, and the residue is in the Treasury. The surplus revenue has also, under the same authority, been applied to the redemption of the residue of United States noteSj.not redeemed by the sale of coin as above stated, and the balance is held in the Treasury in preparation for resumption. These operations, aided greatly, no doubt, by the favorable condition of our foreign commerce, have advanced the market value of United States notes to 97f per cent., or within nearly two and a half per cent, of coin. They have also conclusively demonstrated the practicabihty of restoring United States notes to par, in coin, by the time fixed by law, and that without disturbing either domestic or foreign trade or commerce. Every step has been accompanied m t h growing business, with the advance of public credit, and the steady appreciation of United States notes. The export of bullion has been arrested, and our domestic supply has accumulated in the Treasury. The exportation of other domestic products has been largely increased, with great advantage to all industries. The course adopted under the resumption act, as herein set forth, if i3ursued, will probably be followed with like favorable results, ahd a sufficient fund for the maintenance of resumption will REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OP THE TREASURY. XIII doubtless accumulate in the Treasury at or before the-date fixed by law. The provision for free banking has aided this process by allaying imaginary fears that would otherwise have been aroused by the withdrawal of United States notes. . The Secretary cannot too strongly urge the firm maintenance of a policy that wiU make good the promise contained in the United States notes when issued—a promise repeated in the act \"to strengthen the public credit,\" approved March 18, 1869, and made definite and effective by the resumption act. Dishonored notes, less valuable than the coin they promise, though justified by the necessity which led to their issue, should be made good as soon as practicable. The public credit is injured by failure to redeem them. Every holder who was compelled by law to receive them has been deprived of a part of his just due. Now, when our national resources are ample, when the process of appreciation is almost complete, when the wisdom of the existing law has been demonstrated, it is the dictate of good policy and good faith to continue this process of preparation, so that at or before the time fixed by law every United States i;Lofe will have equal purchasing power with coin. To reverse this policy in the face of assured success will greatly impair the public credit, arrest the process of reducing the interest on the public debt, and cause anew the financial distress our country has recently suffered. The resumption act contemplates the reduction by the first day of January, 1879, of the amount of United States notes to $300,000,000, by the cancellation of such notes to the extent of 80 per cent, of the circulation issued to national banks. The amount of circulation so issued may not be sufficient to accomphsh the reduction contemplated; the Secretary, therefore, recommends that authority be given to gradually fund into four per cent, bonds all United States notes in excess of $300,000,000, the bonds to be issued at par for coin or its market equivalent in United States notes. This will be in harmony with the declared object of existing law, and will open an easy way by which the people may invest their sa^dngs in a public security. Or the reduction of United States notes to the maximum of $300,000,000 may be accomplished if Congress will authorize the coinage of the silver dollar, to be exchanged for United States notes on the demand of the holder, such notes to be retired and cancelled. ^ ' Existing laws do not clearly define whether United States notes, when redeemed after January 1,1879, may be reissued. The first section of the resumption act plainly provides for the permanent substitution of silver XIV REPORT O F ' T H E SECRETARY OF T H E TREASURY. coin for the whole amount of fractional currency outstanding. Section 3 plainly provides for the permanent reduction of United States notes to an amount not exceeding $300,000,000. No distinct legislative declaration is made in the resumption act that notes redeemed after that limit is reached' shall not be reissued; but section 3579 of the Eevised Statutes of the United States provides that \"when any United States notes are returned to the Treasury they may be reissued, from time to time, as the exigencies of the public interest may require.\" The Secretary is of the opinion that, under this section, notes, when redeemed after the 1st of January, 1879, if the amount outstanding is not in excess of $300,000,000, may be reissued as the exigencief of the public service may require. A note redeemed with coin is in the Treasury and subject to the same law as if received for taxes, or as a banknote when redeemed by the corporation issuing it. The authority to. reissue it does not depend upon the mode in which it is returned to the Treasury. But this construction is controverted, and should be settled by distinct provisions of law. It should not be open to doubt or dispute. The decision of this question by Congress involves not merely the construction of existing law, but the pubhc policy of maintaining in circulation United States notes, either Avith or without the legal-tender clause. These notes are of great public convenience—they. circulate readil^^; are of universal credit; are a debt of the people without interest; are protected by every possible safeguard against counterfeiting; and, Avhen redeemable in coin at the demand of the holder, form a paper currency as good as has yet been devised. I t is conceded that a certain amount can, with the aid of an amiDle reserve in coin, be ahvays maintained in circulation. Should not the benefit of this circulation inui'e to the people, rather than to corporations, either State or national^ The Government has ample facility for the collection, custody, and care of the coin reserves of the countrj^ I t is a safer custodian bf such reserves than a multitude of scattered banks can be. The authority to issue circulating-notes by banks is not given to them for their benefit, but for the public convenience, and to enable them to meet the ebb and flow of cuixency caused by varying crops, productions, and seasons. I t is indispensable that a power should exist somewhere to issue and loan credit-money at certain times, and to redeem it at others. This function can be performed better by corporations than by the GoA^ernment. The Government cannot loan money, deal in bills of exchange, or make advances on property. The Secretary ventures to express the opinion, that the best currency for the people of the United States Avould be a carefully-hmited REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XV. amount of United States notes, promptly redeemable on presentation in coin, and supported by ample reserves of coin, and supplemented by a system of national banks, organized under general laws, free and open to all, 'with power to issue circulating-notes secured by United States bonds deposited with the Government, and redeemable on demand in United States notes or coin. Such a system will secure to the people a safe currency of equal value in all parts of the country, receivable for. all dues, and easily convertible into coin. Interest can thus be saved on so much of the public debt as can be conAT-eniently maintained in permanent circulation, leaving to national banks the proper business of such corporations, of proAdding currency for the varying changes, the ebb and flow of trade. The legal-tender quahty given to United States notes was intended to maintain them in forced circulation, at a time when their depreciation was inevitable. When they are redeemable in coin this quality may either be withdrawn or retained, without affecting their use as currency ' in ordinary times. But aU experience has shown that there are periods when, under any system of paper money, however carefully guarded, i t ; is impracticable to maintain actual coin redemption. Usually contracts will be based upon current pai^er money, and it is just that, during a sudden panic, or an unreasonable demand for coin, the creditor should not be allowed to demand payment in other than the currency upon which the debt was contracted.^ To meet this contingency, it would seem to be right to maintain the legal-tender quality of the United States notes. If they are not at par with coin it is the fault of the Government and not of the debtor, or, rather, it is the result of unforeseen stringency not contemplated by the contracting parties. In estabhshing a system of paper money designed to be permanent,, it must be remembered that heretofore no expedient has been dcAdsed, either in this or other countries, that in times of panic or adA^erse trade,, has prevented the drain and exhaustion of coin reserves, however large or carefully guarded. Every such system must provide for a suspension of specie payment. Laws may forbid or ignore such a contingency^ but it will come; and when it comes it cannot be resisted, but should b e acknowledged and declared, to prevent unnecessary sacrifice and ruin In our free Government the power to make this declaration will not b e willingly intrusted to individuals, but should be determined by events and conditions known to all. It is far better to fix the maximum of legal-tender notes at $300,000,000, supported by a minimum reserve of $100,000,000 of coin, only to be used for the redemption of notes not t a be reissued until the reserve is restored. A demand for coin to exhaust XVI REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. such a reserve may not occur, but, if events force it, its existence would be known and could be declared, and would justify a temporary suspension of specie payments. Some such expedient could no doubt be proAdded by Congress for an exceptional emergency. In other times the general confidence in these notes would maintain them at par in coin, smd justify their use as reserves of banks and for the redemption of bank-notes. NATIONAL BANKS. In this connection, the Secretary calls the attention of Congress to the report of the Comptroller of the Currency. The number of national banks in existence on the first day of November last was 2,080. The amount of their circulating-notes retired within the year prior to NoA^ember 1, 1877, is $20,681,637. The amount of circulating-notes issued, to national banks during the same period is $16,306,030. The aggregate amount of their circulation outstanding is $316,775,111. Their loans and discounts amount to $888,243,290 17. The general solvency of the national banks, as now organized, and their benefit to the people, have been demonstrated during a period of fourteen years. No one has lost a dollar by receiving their notes. They have been less subject to reAoilsion and failure than any other corporations or firms. Their organization under a general law containing •every safeguard which experience has suggested—the superAdsion OA^^er them by the Comptroller of the Currency, the frequent and unforeseen examinations to which they are subject, the sworn statements required «of them of every detail necessary to disclose their condition, the absolute security of their issues—makes this system of banking as safe .and efficient as any yet devised. The remaining condition to perfect this system is, that their notes should be readily convertible into coin. While United States notes were irredeemable and depreciated, it was not possible that bank-notes should rise above the par of United States notes. The true test of this systein of banking Avill come when the United States notes are maintained at par with coin; then the banks must redeem their notes in coin or United States notes equal to coin. The ample statistics given by the Comptroller, and his comparison of the reserves and condition of the national banks with the reserves and condition of other systems of banking in specie-paying times, give assurance that the national banks are able to\"redeem their circulatingnotes in coin at any date fixed upon by the Government. They certainly should not enjoy the franchise of circulating as money ctheir non-interest-bearing notes, unless they are prepared to redeem them. REPORT OF T H E SECRETARY OF T H E TREASURY. XVII The present system of redemption of bank-notes at the Treasury of the United States can be continued after United States notes are at par with <coin as well as now. If experience should show that additional reserves are necessary they can be required. Then, as now, their notes wiU be. amply secured by the deposit of bonds, and confidence in this security will dispel the fear of failure, which, under former systems, has been. the cause of sudden runs or demands on banks for payment of their notes. If the policy of the Government should be to maintain in circulation at par with coin, a maxunumfof three hundred millions of United States notes, and to support them with a reserA^e of not less than one hundred milhons in coin, these notes will be the natural reserves of the banks, and more convenient for that purpose than a deposit of coin in their vaults. The real danger that in former systems threatened a bank was its liability for deposits. If these were suddenly withdrawn, or greatly diminished, the note-holder was the chief sufferer. The first rumor of weakness about a bank brought a demand from depositors and noteholders alike, but under the national-banking system the note-holder is secure and indifferent whether the bank breaks or not, and tho depositor, who is a voluntary creditor of the bank, is not likely to hasten its fall. He is usually paid by a transfer of credits, and in most cases is a debtor as well as a creditor of the bank. Scarcely ^ve per •cent, of deposits are paid by currency. The capital stock of national banks paid in is now $479,467,771, and the surplus fund andother undivided profits is now $166,348,799 96. The banks are exceptionally strong in their cash reserA^es. Their condition is as faA^orable to maintain redemption in coin as in United States notes, and the Secretar}^ concurs in the opinion of the ComptroUer that they ought to be, can be, and will be prepared for redemption of their circulating-notes in coin or in United States notes equal to coin by the time fixed by law, without interfering with their ability or disposition to render their aid, as now, by loans and discounts, in conducting the business and exchanges of the country. The market A'-alue of their circulating-note is 97f per cent. The difference is not equal to six months' interest on the bonds deposited for the security of the notes, and not five per cent, of their surj3lus on hand. It is scarcely to be credited that the payment of thi3 Avill disturb in any way the even course of their business. Complaint is made by the banks and bankers of tjie country of the tax on their dei)Osits, and attention is called to what is said by the Comptroller of the Currency as to the repeal of this tax. While the II F XVIII REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. necessity exists for collecting the amount of revenue now required, the Secretary is not prepared to recommend such repeal, but whencA'-er a sufficient amount of revenue for the support of the Government can be derived from the other articles now subject to taxation, a reduction ol bank taxation will then be advisable. The cost of the redemption of bank-notes in United States notes at the Treasury, under the present system, does not exceed one-sixth of one per cent, on the amount redeemed, and is refunded to the GOA^ernment h j the banks, The redemption is a great convenience to them and to the public, and should be continued. The act creating the national-banking system recognizes the character of these banks as Government agents or depositaries. They could greatly assist in the process of refunding; they are conveniently distributed so as to be Avithin easy reach of the people of the United States. The Secretary is of the opinion that they can be, under exist. ing law, and ought to be, made the ag.ents of the Government in the sale of bonds, upon conditions that will make it for their interest to promote such sales, and will be safe and advantageous to the Government. Various plans have been submitted to secure their co-operation, and the best \\Adll be adopted. SAVINGS-BANKS. The attention of Congress is called to the ^great value to our fellowcitizens of the organization of some plan for the coUection, safe-keeping, and profitable employment of small deposits by the people. How far this can be done without trenching upon the proper functions of the State governments is a question of difficulty; yet it is important to secure, if possible, a general system throughout the United States. This can hardly be effected by the organization of a multitude of savings-banks^ depending upon the fidelity, integrity, and skiU of their officers, but the beneficial object of such banks might be secured by authorizing the deposit of small sums with any postal money-order office in the United States, and the issue of GoA^ernment certificates, convertible on demand of the holder into four per cent, bonds of the United States of such character, description, and amount as AVLU enable and induce prudent persons to convert their earnings into a public security of stable value. The money thus received could be employed in the redemption of outstanding bonds bearing a higher rate of interest. By some such system it is behoved that the great body of our public debt, reduced to its smallest possible burden, could be distributed among our OAvn people. With a slight modification of existing law this beneficial result would REPORT OF T H E SECRETARY OF T H E TREASURY. XIX be secured. The deposits now held by savings-banks throughout the country amount to $843,154,804, deposited by 2,300,000 persons, and mostly by deserving citizens, who thus wisely seek to preserve small savings for future need. No object could more strongly appeal to the considerate judgment of Congress. The heavy losses that have been sustained through savings-banks, whose funds haA^e been improAddently loaned upon insufficient security, have inflicted far greater injury upon the depositors than would a similar loss suffered by persons engaged in banking or commercial pursuits. The Secretary, therefore, recommends that authority be granted to issue certificates for small deposits, convertible into four per cent, bonds noAv. authorized by law, the proceeds to be used solely for the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate of interest, and now redeemable at par. COINS AND COINAGE. The Secretary calls the attention of Congress to the reportof the Director of the Mint. The general management of the mints and assay offices, and the amount, accuracy, and perfection of their work, are highly satisfactory. The coinage of gold and silver, their relative value to each other, and their legal-tender qualities, are now the subjects of discussion and legislation in aU civilized countries. These questions are especially important to the United States, now in transition from an irredeemable paper currency to a mixed currency, redeemable in coin, and wiU justify the Secretary in a fuUer presentation of these toi)ics than is usual in his annual report. The resumption act of Januarj^ 14, 1875, provided for the exchange and substitution of silver coin for fractional currency. To facUitate this exchange, the joint resolution approved July 22, 1876, provided that such coin should be issued to an amount not exceeding $10,000,000, for an equal amount of legal-tender notes. It also provided that the aggregate amount of such coin and fractional currency outstanding should not exceed, at any time, $50,000,000. That limit would haA^e been reached sometime since, if the whole amount of fractional currency issued and not redeemed, had been held to be \"outstanding.\" I t was well known, however, that a very large amount of fractional currency issued had been destroyed, and could not be presented for redemption, and could hardly be held to be \"outstanding.\" The Treasurer of the United States, the ComptroUer of the Currency, and the Director of the Mint concurred in estimating the amount, so lost and destroyed, to be not less than $8,083,513. A 8 it was evident that Congress intended to provide an aggregate XX REPORT OF T H E 'SECRETARY OF T H E TREASURY. issue of $50,000,000 of such coin and currency in circulation, the Secretary directed the further issue of sih^er coin equal in amount to the currency estimated to haA'-e been lost and destroyed. I t is submitted that the hmitation uiDon the amount of such fractional coin to be issued tn exchange for United States notes should be repealed. This coin is readily taken, is in great faAT'or with the people, its issue is profitable to the GoA^ernment, and experience has sliown that there'is no difficulty in maintaining it at par with United States notes. The estimated amount of such coin in circulation in the United States in 1860, at par Avith gold, was $43,000,000. Great Britain, with a Ijopulation of 32,000,000, maintains an inferior fractional coin to the amount of $92,463,500,* at par AAdth gold, and other nations maintain a much l^TgeTper-ca2nta amount. The true hmit of such coin is the demand that may be made for its issue, and if only issued in exchange for United States notes there is no danger of an excess being issued. By the coinage act of 1873 any person may deposit silver bullion at the mint to be coined into. trade-dollars of the weight of 420 grains troy, upon the pajnnent of the cost of coinage. This proAdsion was made at a time when, such a dollar was Avorth in the market $1 0 2 ^ ^ in gold, and was designed for the use of trade in China, where silver was the only standard. By the joint resolution of July 22, 1876, passed Avhen the trade-dollar in market value had fallen greatly below one doUar in gold, it was provided that it should not be thereafter a legal tender, and the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized \" t o limit the coinage thereof to such an amount as he may deem sufficient to meet the export demand for the same.\" Under these laws the amount of trade-doUars issued, mainly for exportation, Avas $30,710,400. In October last it became apparent that there was no further export demand for trade-dollars, but deposits of silver bullion were made, and such doUars were demanded of the mint for circulation in the United States, that the owner might secure the difference between the value of such buUion in the market and tJnited States notes. At the time, the mints were fully occupied by the issue of fractional and other coins on account of the Government. Therefore, under the authority of the law referred to, the Secretary directed that no further issues of trade-doUars should be made untU necessary again to meet an export demand. In case another silver dollar is authorized, the Secretary recommends that the tradedollar be discontinued. *|As estimated by Mr. Freeman tie, deputy master of the Royal Mint, December, 1875. • REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXI The question of the issue of a sih^er dollar for circulation as money has been much discussed and carefully examined by a commission organized by Congress, which has recommended the coinage of the old silver doUar. With such legislative provision as A^U maintain, its current value at par Avith gold, its issue is respectfully recommended, A gold coin of the denomination of one doUar is too small for couA^enient circulation, while such a coin in silver would be couA^enient for a multitude of daily transactions, and is in a form to satisfy the natural instinct of hoarding. Of the metals, silver is of most general use for coinage. It is a part of CA^ery sj^stem of coinage CA^en in countries where gold is the sole legal standard. I t best measures the common wants of life, but, from its weight and bulk, is not a couA^enient medium in the larger exchanges of commerce. Its production is reasonably steady in amount. The relative market value of silver and gold is far more stable than that of any other tAA^o commodities—still, it does vary. It is not in the poAyer of human laAV to prevent the variation. This inherent difficulty has compelled all nations to adopt one or the other as the sole standard of A^aliie, or to authorize an alternative standard of either, or to coin both metals at an arbitrary standard, and to maintain one at par Avith the other by limiting its amount and legal-tender quality, and receiAdng or redeeming it at par Adth the other. It has been the careful study of statesmen for many years to secure a bi-metaUic currency not subject to the changes of market value, and so adjusted that both kinds can be kept in circulation together, not alternating Avith each other. The growing tendency has been to adopt, for coins, the principle of \"redeemabihty\" applied to different forms of paper money. By limiting tokens, silver, and paper money to the amount needed for business, and promptly receiving or redeeming all that may at an}^ time be in excess, all these forms of money can be kept ih circulation, in large amounts, at par Avith gold. In this Av^ay, tokens of inferior intrinsic value are readily ckculated, but do not depreciate beloAv the paper money into which they are couA^ertible. The fractional silver coin UOAV in circulation, though the sih^er of Avhich it is composed is of less market value than the paper money, passes readily among aU classes of people and answers all the puri)oses for which it was designed. And so the sih^er dollar, if restored to our coinage, would greatly add to the convenience of the people. But this coin should be subject to the same rule, as to issue and conA^ertibility, as other forms of money. If the market value of the sUver in it were less than that of gold coin of the same denomination, and it were issued XXII R E P O R T OF T H E SECRETARY OF T H E TREASURY. in unlimited quantities, and made a legal tender for all debts, it would demonetize gold and depreciate our paper money. The iinportance of gold as the standard of A^alue is conceded by all. Since 1834, it has been practically the sole coin standard of the United States, ahd since 1815, has been the sole standard of Great Britain. Germany has recently adopted the same standard. France and other Latin nations have suspended the coinage of silA^er, and, it is supposed, will gradually either adopt the sole standard of gold or provide . for the convertibility of sih^er coin, on the demand of the holder, into gold coin. . In the United States, scA^eral experiments have been made with the view of retaining both gold and silver in circulation. The Second Congress undertook to estabUsh the ratio of fifteen of silver to one of gold, with free coinage of both metals. By this ratio gold was underA^alued, as one ounce of gold was worth more in the markets of the world than fifteien ounces of silver, and gold, therefore, was exported. To correct this, in 1837 the ratio was fixed at sixteen to one, but sixteen ounces of silver were worth in the market more than one ounce of gold, so that silA^er was demonetized. These difficulties in the adjustment of gold and sih^er coinage were fuUy considered by Congress prior to the passage of the act approved February 21,1853. By that act a new, and it was believed a permanent policy, Avas adopted to secure the simultaneous circulation of both sih^er and gold coins in the United States. Silver fractional coins were proAdded for at a ratio of 14.88 in sih^er to one in gold, and were only issued in exchange for gold coin. The right of priA^ate parties to deposit silver bullion for such coinage was repealed, and these coins were issued from bullion purchased by the treasui'er of the mint,' and only upon the account and for the profit of the United States. The coin was a ' legal tender only in payment of debts for all sums not exceeding five dollars. Though the silver in this coin was worth in the market 3.13 cents on the dollar less than gold coin, yet its couA^enience for use as change, its issue bythe GoA^ernment only in exchange for, and its practical convertibility iiito, gold coin maintained it in circulation at par with gold coin. If the slight error in the ratio of 1792 prevented gold from entering into circulation for fort^^-five years, and the slight error in 1837 brought gold into circulation and banished sih^er until 1853, hoAv much more certainly will an error now of nine per cent, cause gold to be exported and silver to become the sole standard of A^alue *? Is it worth while to travel again the round of errors, when experience has demonstrated that both metals can only be maintained in circulation together by adhering to the policy of 1853 '^ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXIII The silver dollar was not mentioned in the act of 1853, but from 1792 until 1874 it was worth more in the market than the gold dollar proAdded for in, the act of 1837. It was not a current coin contemi)lated as being in circulation at the passage of the act of February 12, 1873. The Avhole amount of such doUars, issued prior to 1853, was $2,553,000. Subsequent to 1853, and until it was dropped from our coinage in 1873, the total amount issued was $5,492,838, or an aggregate of $8,045,838, and this was almost exclusively for exportation. By the coinage act, approA^ed February 12, 1873, fractional silver coins were authorized, simUar in general character to the coins of 1853, but with a slight increase of silver in them, to make them conform exactly to the French coinage, and the old dollar was replaced by the trade-dollar of 420 grains of standard silver. Much complaint has been made that this was done with the design of depriving the people of the privilege of paying their debts in £i cheaper money than gold, but it is manifest that this is an error. No one then did or could foresee the subsequent fall in the market value of silA^er. The sih^er dollar AA^' as an unknown coin to the people, and was not in circulation even on the Pacific slope, where coin was in common use. The trade-dollar of 420 grains was substituted for the silA^er dollar of 412J grains because it was believed that it. was better adaxDted to supersede the Mexican dollar in the Chinese trade, and experiment proA^ed this to be true. Since the trade-dollar was authorized $30,710,400 have been issued, or nearly four time.s the entke issue of old silA^er dollars since the foundation of the Government. Had not tlie coinage act of 1873 passed, the United States would now be compelled to suspend the free coinage of silA^^er doUars, as the Latin nations did, or to has^e sUver as the sole coin standard of value. Since February, 1873, great changes have occurred in the market value of sUA^er. Prior to that time the sih^er in the old dollar Avas worth more than a gold dollar, while at present it is worth about 92 cents. If by laAV any holder of silver bullion might deposit it in the mint and demand a full legal-tender dollar for every 412J grains of standard. silA^er deposited, the result AA'ould be incAdtable that as soon as the inints could supply the demand the silver dollar would, by a financial laAV as fixed and invariable as the law of graAdtation, become the only standard of value. All forms of paper money would fall to that standard or below it, and gold would be demonetized and quoted, at a premium equal to its A^aliie in the markets of the world. For a time the run to deposit bulhon at the mint would give to silver an artificial value, of which the holders and producers of sih^er bullion would have XXIV REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. the sole benefit. The utmost capacity of the mints would be employecl for years to supply this demand at the cost of and Avithout profit tothe people. The silA^er dollar would take the place of gold as rapidly as coined, and be used in the payment of customs duties, causing an accumulation of such coins in the Treasury. If used in paying the interest on the public debt, the grave questions already i)resented would arise with public creditors, seriousl}^ affecting the public credit. I t is urged that the free coinage of silver in the United States Adll restore its market value to that of gold. Market value is fixed by the world, and not by the United States alone, and is affected by the whole mass of silver in the Avorld. As the enormous and continuous demand for silver in Asia has not prcA^ented the fall in silver, it is not likely that the limited demand for sUA^er coin in this country, where paper money is now and AviU be the chief medium of exchange, AVUI cause any considerable advance in its A^alue. This adA^ance, if anj^, wiU be secured by the demand for silver bullion for coin to be issued by and for the United States, as Avell as if it were issued for the benefit of the holder of the bullion. If the financial condition of our country js so groAdous that we must at CA^ery hazard haA^e a cheaper dollar, in order t a lessen the burden of debts already contracted, it is far better, rather than to adopt the single standard of sih^er, to boldly reduce the number of grains in the gold dollar, or to abandon and retrace all efforts to make United States notes equal to coin. Either expedient AVUI do greater harm to the public at large than £bjxj possible benefit to debtors. The free coinage of silver wUl also impair the pledge made of the customs duties, b^^ the act of February, 1862, for the payment of the interest of the pubhc debt. The policy thus far adhered to, of collecting these duties in gold coin, has been the chief cause of upholding and advancing the public credit, and making it possible to lessen t h e burden of interest by the process of re-funding. In view of these considerations, the Secretary has felt it to be his duty to earnestly urge upon Congress the serious objections to the free coinage of sUA'-er on such conditions as will demonetize gold, greatly disturb all the financial operations of the Government, suddenly rcA^olutionize the basis of our currency, throw upon the GoA^ernment theincreased cost of coinage, arrest the re-funding of the public debt, and impair the public credit, with no apparent advantage to the people at large. The Secretary belicA^es that all the beneficial results hoped for from a liberal issue of silver coin can be secured by issuing this coin, in pursuance of the general pohcy of the act of 1853, in exchange for United States notes, coined from bullion purchased in the open market REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXV by the United States, and maintaining it by redemption, or otherAvise, at par A\\dth gold coin. I t could be made a legal tender for such sums and on such contracts as would secure to it the most general ckctilation. It could be easily redeemed in United States notes and gold coin, and only reissued when demanded for public convenience. If the essential quality of redeemabihty given to United States notes, bankbills, tokens, fractional coins, and currency maintains them at par, how much easier it Avould be to maintain the silver doUar, of intrinsic market A^aliie, nearty equal to gold, at par with gold coin, by giving to it the like quality of redeemabUity. To still further secure a fixed relative A^alue of silver and gold, the United States mighl^ iuAdte an international convention of commercial nations. Even such a convention, while it might check the fall of sih^er, could not prevent the operation of that higher law which places the market value of sUver above human control. Issued upon the conditions here stated, the Secretary is of opinion that the silver dollar wUl be a great public adA^antage, but that if issued Avithout limit, upon the demand of the owners of sih^er bullion, it wiU be a great public injury. EXPORTS AND IMPORTS, The receipts from customs for the year ended June 30, 1876, were $148,071,984 61, and at the corresponding date of 1877 they were $130,956,493 07—a decrease of $17,115,491 54. The receipts for the first quarter of the last fiscal year were $37,554,728 53, while, for the corresponding period of this year, they were $36,983,531 56—a decrease of $571,196 97. The embarrassments attendant upon the collection of the rcA^enue at the port of New York—alluded to in the report of my immediate predecessor—growing out of the large number of suits brought to recoA^er alleged excess of duties, have not ceased; but a considerable number of such suits have been pressed to trial, with results in favor of the Government in the majority of cases. Owing to the multiplicity of such suits, a considerable delay necessarily occurs before they can be brought to trial; which delay is adA^erse to the interests both of the Government and the imi)orters. The recommendation of my predecessor, that a special tribunal be created by law for the trial of customsrevenue cases at the port of New York, is renewed. In compliance vdth the fourth section of the act approved August 15, 1876, and since the 4th of March last, commissions haA^e been organized, under direction, of the President, to iuA^estigate generally the manner in which the customs business has been conducted at many of the iDrincipal ports. They were also directed to inquire into the manner XXVI REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. in which appointments in the customs service have been heretofore made, and to suggest such changes in existing laws as would more fully meet the necessities of commerce at the present time, and promote economy in the coUection of the customs revenue. The action taken by this Department, in pm^suance of the recommendation of these commissions, has worked a marked improA^ement in the conduct of the customs serAdce. A copy of the sixth report of the commission, appointed to iuA^estigate the NCAV York custom-house, is herewith transmitted, and the changes, recommended in existing laws, are commencled to the consideration of Congress. Other changes, recommended by the A^arious commissions, Avill be presented to Congress, in due tune, for such action as may be deemed necessary. Embarrassment has occurred during the past year in the collection of duties on sugar, under schedule G, title 33, of the EcAdsed Statutes. These duties are assessed by the. Dutch standard, according to color; and it has been alleged that sugars haA'-e been artificially colored in the country of export, to secure their passage at the custom-house at a. less rate of duty than would be charged according to the color acquired in the ordinary process of manufacture. While the truth of such allegation has not been established in any positive manner, notAAdthstanding the thorough examination AAdiich has been made by the officers of this Department, it has been ascertained that the suspected sugars, Avhich pay the loAvest rate of duty at the <3ustom-house, were of a higher intrinsic grade in many cases than those paying higher rates of duty. Statistics show that, from some 'Cause, a marked increase has occurred in the importation of sugar subject to the lowest rate of duty, and a corresponding decrease in the importation of unrefined sugars paying the higher rates. This is doubtless due in part to the act of March 3, 1875, (Stat, at Large, vol. 18, page 339,) which mposed an additional duty of 25 per cent, ofthe duties prescribed in schedule G, and thus increased the discrimination in favor of the lower grades of sugar. The Dutch standard is an unsatisfactory basis for the assessment of duty, founded as it is on color alone, which bears no definite relation to the A^aliie of the sugar. If, however, the Dutch standard is to be retained, it is recominended that the grades be reduced in number, so that there shall be but three rates of duty, one for sugars not above No. 13, one for sugars aboA^e 13 and not above 20, and another for all sugars above No. 20, including all refined sugars. Based upon the quantities of the various grades imported during the past two j^ears, the following rates Avoiild yield about the same amount of rcAT^enue as was collected REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXVII during that time: Sugars not above No. 13, perpound, 2^-^^', above No. 13 and not above 20, 3^^%; above 20,.and all refined sugars, 5 cents. This is incliisiAT^e of the 25 per cent, additional duty imposed by the act of March 3, 1875. Extensive iinderA^aluations in the entries of silk goods haA^e occurred during the past j^ear, and the persistent efforts of the officers of the Department at the principal ports to prevent and break up such frauds on the revenue haA^e not been attended Avith entire success. This is due in part to the practice of shipping goods to agents in the United States on consignment for sale on the manufacturers' account, for which goods, it is claimed, there is consequently no market value abroad. I t has been suggested, as a preventiA'-e for such CAdls in the future, that the duty on silks be changed to one per pound, instead of the present ad-valorem duty. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of Congress. For the reasons already stated the aggregate rcA^enue from imports cannot be decreased Avith due regard to the wants of the Government. A rcAdsion of the tariff seems desirable, and the Secretary recommends that a duty of two cents per pound on coffee and ten cents per pound on tea be adopted, which Avould yield a revenue, based on the aA^erage annual consumption of the last five years, of over twelve million dollars. By the adoption of such a measure opportunity will be ^ giA'en for a moderate enlargement of the free list, and for the reduction of some internal taxes. A large number of isolated articles are now included in the dutiable list which ^deld less than ten thousand dollars a year each, and the cost of collecting the duty on these articles is proportionally greater than on the staple articles. The addition of inany such articles to the free list, in the event of the duty being placed on tea and coffee, would be beneficial. The coin values of the exports and imi)orts of the United States for the last fiscaFyear, as ai:)pears from returns made to and compUed by the Bureau of Statistics, are as follows: Exports of domestic merchandise $589, 670,224 Exx3orts of foreign merchandise 12, 804, 996 Total Imports , : Excess of exports OA^er imports For the fiscal year 1876 there was an excess of exports over imports amountiiig to Showing an excess for the last fiscal year oA^er the preceding year of 602, 475, 220 451, 323,126 151,152,094 79, 643,481 71, 508, 613 XXVIII REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.

The total exportation of specie and bulUon was less than that for the preceding year by $344,165, while the exports of domestic goods increased in A^alue $64,087,977. Importations of merchandise decreased to the ainount of $9,418,064, as compared Avith those of the preceding fiscal year; and of $81,682,310, as compared Avith the year ended June 30, 1875. There was an increase in the A^alue of imports of the following articles, Avhich are free of duty: Hides and skins, $1,927,994; crude India-rubber and gutta-percha, $1,478,507; raw silk, $1,368,529. The largest increase in the value of dutiable goods was in broAvn sugar, chiefly for refining purposes, $25,484,601. OAving to the fact that there is no law requiring persons exporting merchandise by land-couAi^eyance to Canada to file manifests containing the quantities and values thereof, the A^alue of our exports of domestic merchandise to the ProAdnces of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba is not fully exi)ressed in the returns made to the statistical bureau. From the detailed statements prepared by the Commissioner of Customs for the Dominion of Canada it appears that the Canadian value of our exports to those ProAdnces during the last fiscal year amounts to $13,051,798 in excess of that returned by the customs officers of the United States. Assuming that the Canadian value is identical with the A^-alue taken as a basis for returns by the Bureau of Statistics j. the A^alue of the total exports of the year, with this addition, amounts to $615,527,018. The attention of Congress is called to the defects of law which prevent the collection of accurate returns of our exports to Canada, and the recommendation of my predecessor that, remedial legislation may be enacted is renewed. The effect of the act of June 22, 1874, (Statutes at Large, volume 18, page 186,) entitled an act to amend the customs-revenue laws and to repeal moieties, has not been salutary. The proceeds of fines, penalties, and forfeitures recovered for the violation of customs laws and paid into the Treasury from June 30, 1870, haA^e been as folloAvs: R E P O R T OF THE SECRETARY OF T H E TREASURY.

The commission which examined the custom-house at San Francisco, makes the following recommendation in regard to a modification of the law: 1st. That from the gross proceeds of any sale of goods seized in the act of being smuggled, there should be paid all legal and other costs of seizure and sale. 2d. That the Government should receive the amount of duty properly chargeable upon the goods so seized in full satisfaction for its claims. 3d. That the remainder be equally divided between the informer and seizing-officer, and where there is no informer, the whole of the remainder, after deducting expenses and duty, shaU go to the seizing-officer: ProAdded, That neither seizing-officer nor informer shall be entitled to receive exceeding five thousand dollars for any one seizure: And provided further. That no officer of the customs in receipt of a salary or fixed compensation exceeding twenty-five hundred dollars per annum, shall be entitled to a j^^ro rata of a seizure for acting as informer. The collector of customs at New York submitted to the commission which examined that custom-house, a table which shows that in 1873 seizures at that port amounted to $773,310 09, and that in 1877, the total amount was $120,131 09. The collector, in submitting that table, remarks that, without any desire to argue in behalf of informers or detective officers, he is yet strongly of the opinion that the above figures represent a loss of many miUions to the Government, caused by a comparative safety to those who are undertaking and accomplishing great frauds upon the Gov ernment. I t is recommended that such a change be made in existing laws as Anil offer increased inducements to parties who may be able to secure a knowledge of such frauds to bring the same to the attention of the customs officers. The greatest loss to the revenue from cutoms xxx REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF , THE TREASURY. arises, not from smuggling, but from undervaluation of goods subject to an ad-valorem duty. It is, therefore, also recommended, for the purpose of securing simplicity and uniformity in the collection o f t h e reA-'cnue from customs, that specific duties be adopted as far as practicable. ALASKA. Since the withdraAval of the troops from Alaska last spring, the management of the territory has practically dcA^olved upon the Treasury Department. The only officers Avho could exercise any authority were the collector of customs at Sitka and his deputies stationed at other i)oints within the territory, the duties of the officers at the seal islands being confined exclusiA^ely to the protection of the seal interests. I t was feared that the sudden withdrawal of the troops might result in a conflict betAveen the whites and Indians; but thus far little disturbance has occurred. The white population at Sitka is very limited, and the expense of maintaining customs officers there, and at other points within the territory, has aggregated, in the past two years, $17,418 32, while the receipts from customs haA^e, duringthe same period, been A^eiy much less. It is, therefore, recommended that the port of Sitka be abolished. The receipts from the tax on seal-skins taken on the islands of St, Paul and St. George, including the rent paid by the Alaska Commercial Company, have been as folio AVS : 1876 $317, 584 00 1877 291,-155 50 The decrease of receipts from that source is consequent upon the fact that a less number of seals Avere taken the past year than the maximum alloAved by laAv.

XXXI The tabular statement of amounts received includes cominissions on sales of stamps paid in kind, which do not appear as cash receipts of the Treasury, and certain suins reported as collected, but not deposited, during their respective fiscal years. Hence there AAdll be an ai)i)arent variation between the amounts of collections tabulated, and those shown by the covering-warrants of the Treasury. The increase in the aggregate receipts from the sources specified,, during the past fiscal year, amounts to a little more than one and three-quarter millions of doUars, and is chiefly derived from spudts and tobacco. The increase in the receipts from spirits is due in part to the greater quantity of whiskey withdrawn from Avarehouse at ninety cents per gallon during the current year than was withdrawn in 1876, and in part to the greater quantit}^ of brandy distilled from fruit the past year. The aggregate quantity of tax-paid spirits withdrawn at seventy cents per gaUon under the act of June 6, 1872, and at ninety cents per gallon under the act of March 3, 1875, Avas nearly the same; whereas the number ^of gaUons withdrawn pajdng ninety cents was greater by 3,795,369 gaUons during 1877 than in 1876. The quantity of manufactured tobacco on which a tax of twentyfaur cents per pound was paid in 1876, was 107,040,234 pounds; in 1877 the quantity amounted to 112,716,534 pounds, the increase being 5,676,300 pounds. The number of collection districts on July 1, 1876, was one hundred and sixty-five; on June 30, 1877, one hundred and thirty. By consolidation, the number of districts has been further reduced to one hundred and twenty-six.. The number of collectors was, on July 1, 1876, one hundred and sixty-five, and is now one hundred and twenty-six. For further particulars relating to the operatious of the bureau, attention is respectfuUy iuAdted to the report of the Coinmissioner ot Internal Eevenue, herewith transmitted. ACCOUNTING- OFFICES. The present system of accounting has been the result of many years' experience, and thus far, it is beUeved, has proven sufficient to protect the Government in all its ordinary and current disbursements. Your attention is iuAdted to the statements of several officers concerning the crowded condition of the files of their respective offices. These files include the vouchers upon which the disbursements of the GoA^ernment tn all branches have been made, and the importance of securing them from destruction and providin'g for them such room as wUl make them readily accessible can hardly be over-estimated. Such XXXII . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. action for this purpose as you may deem necessary should be taken as soon as practicable. CLAIMS AaAlNST THE aOVERNMENT. The attention of Congress is called to the laws imposing upon this Department the adjudication of a multitude of claims. Its organization is admirably adapted for the investigation and statement of accounts accruing in the ordinary course of cuiTcnt business, but it is not adapted to the investigation of claims long since accrued, and supported in most cases by ex-parte affidaAdts. The Department ha^ no authority to cross-examine Avitnesses, no agents to send to examine into alleged facts, and no facUities, such as are in common use by courts, to ascertain truth and expose falsehood. It is respectfully suggested that this class of claims, not already acted upon, be transferred from the Treasury Department, and its business of accounting be confined to cu.rrent accounts, payable from appropriations made within a short period of time. Most of these claims are paid out of what are classed as \"permanent annual appropriations,\" contained in section 3689, Eevised Statutes, which do not come under the annual supervision of Congress. These appropriations, though declared to be annual, have been used for the payment of claims, however old, including nearly CA^ery case of fraudulent or exaggerated claims paid by this Department. I t is respectfully urged that this important section be carefully revised; that the appropriations contained therein be made annually; and that only such claims as accrue Avithin a brief period be paid by the Department, unless proper evidence in thek faA^or appears upon the public records, as in the case of the principal or interest of the funded debt. By the act approved June 20, 1874, (18 Stats., 110, sec. 5,) it was provided: \"That from and after the first day of July, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and of each year thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause all unexpended balances of appropriations which shaU haA^e remained upon the books of the. Treasury for two fiscal years to be carried to the surplus fund and covered into the Treasury,\" &c. , Under a construction of this act, placed upon it after a full examination by the Department, it was held that most of the appropriations made by this section, and which accrued prior to July 1, 1874, are not within the exceptions stated in the act, and they were accordingly coA^ered into the Treasury, and are not available except for current purposes and for claims accruing within th'e time fixed by that act. I t REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXXIII seems to be the clear purpose of this act to include permanent annual appropriations within its operation, and to thus include them is a AVISO public poUcy. Among the permanent annual appropriations made in the section referred to, is that to repay to unporters the excess of deposits for unascertained duties, or duties or other moneys paid under protest, from which the greater part of the refunds of customs duties are made. These include a class of claims commonly knoAvn as the \" charges and commissions cases,\" which arose under the act of March 3, 1851. About fourteen hundred suits were brought by importers against the collector of customs at the port of New York, to recover alleged excessive duties coUected by him in obedience to the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury that, to ascertain the dutiable value of imported goods at the port of entry, there should be added to the actual market value of the goods at the port of exportation, a commission of two and one-half per cent., and certain costs and charges. This act was repealed June 30, 1864, so that aU these claims accrued prior to that date. Over tAVO million doUars have ,been.paid on these claims, the items of interest and costs forming a very large proportion of that amount. The remaining cases are still pending tn various stages of progress, and, to satisfy these, two miUion doUars more AVLU probably be required. Upon fuU consideration, the Secretary is of the opinion that no money should be appropriated for the payment of these claims until after a thorough investigation has been made into the nature, character, and justice, not only of those stUl pending, but also of those paid. Full details of these claims, as fa^r as it is possible for the Department to ascertain them, wiU be submitted to Congress. Under the same section claims for\"refund of taxes, iUegally imposed under internal-revenue-tax laws, are paid. Claims under these laws are very numerous and varied in character, and some are stUl pending for refund of taxes wrongfully imposed under statutes which have been repealed and are no longer in force. In internal-revenue cases, the law now in force in regard to informers' rewards (Section 3463, Eevised Statutes) authorizes the Commissioner of Internal Eevenue, vdth the approval of the Secretary, to pay such sums as he may deem necessary for detecting and bringing to trial persons guilty of violating the laws. I t is respectfuUy submitted that aU such discretionary powers be more carefully limited by law. Questions are constantly arising as to the allowance to be made to district attorneys for their compensation. The statutes have been so in F ' . XXXIV REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. often amended and so variously construed that it is almost impossible to determme what allowances should be made. In the southern district of New York the allowances haA^e been such that in some years the compensation of the district attorney has exceeded $30,000, while in some meritorious cases there has hardly been sufficient authority for making a fair aUowance. To avoid excessiA^e compensation, the Secretary has limited the aggregate amount of allowances to any district attorney within one year^ including salary, to ten thousand dollars; but the better way is to estabUsh by law the salary of each district attorney, and to forbid all allowances. Under the act of July 4,1864, and acts amendatory thereof, and Section 300, Appendix to EcAdsed Statutes, claims of loyal citizens, in States not tn rebeUion, for quartermaster's stores and subsistence supplies received or taken for the use of the Army, are to be reported by the quartermaster general or commissary general, if satisfied that they are just, to the Third Auditor for settlement. The action of the accounting officers ofthe Treasury Department upon this class of claims is required, by the act of June 16,1874, to be reported by the Secretary to Congress, at the commencement of each session, for consideration, before payment by appropriation. The number of claims of this character is A^ery large, and the amount aUowed thereon and reported tn the Digest of Appropriations for 1877 is $270,357 22. , Other classes of claims under the jurisdiction of the same accounting officers, but not required by statute to be reported for speciffc appropriation, include those for compensation for horses and equipments lost in the military service, and for use and loss of steamboats and other vessels, railroad engines, &c., under the act of March 3,1849, amended and construed by the acts of March 3,1863, and June' 22, 1874, and sections 3482 to 3489, Eevised Statutes. These claims are numerous and involve a large amount in the aggregate. By the act of May 18, 1872, section 5, the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized and directed to pay to the lawful owners, or their legal representatives, the net proceeds actually paid into the Treasury of all cotton seized after the 30th day of June, 1865, by agents of the Government unlaAvfuIly and in Adolation of their instructions. The Secretary was tuA^ested Avith sole jurisdiction as to the construction of the act, and the methods by which the facts should be ascertained. ' Under certain regulations of the Department, thirteen hundred and thirty-six claims were filed, claiming the proceeds of one hundred and thirty-six thousand bales of cotton, the estimated value of Avhich is $13,600,000. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXXV These claims have been acted, on as follows: Number of claims rejected Number of claims dismissed Number of claims.aUowed Number of claims pending The amount paid on allowed claims is : :....: 1,189 96 49 2 $194, 801 77 The act is strictly limited in its scope, and was apparently intended to afford relief in a comparatively small number of cases, not disposed of by the Secretary before the proceeds of captured property were covered into the Treasury under the joint resolution of March 30,1868,. and in which wrongful or erroneous seizures were made by the agents of the GoA^ernment engaged, after the close of active hostUities, in coUecting and securing the many thousand bales of cotton scattered through the Southern States, which had been sold by its former owners to the Confederate States. The amount of cotton taken was known to be greatly in excess of that which came uito the hands of authorized agents of the GoA'-ernment subsequent, to June 30, 1865; and, tn Adew of the facts, that almost aU of the fifty thousand bales of cotton , collected after, that date, the proceeds of which reached the Treasury, had been sold to the Confederate States during the war, or was unlawfully acquired by companies formed for the purpose of running the blockade, and that the restrictions of the act whereby the power of the Secretary to grant relief was confined Avithin very narrow limits-, the reason for the payment of so small an amount, as contrasted with the vast sum demanded, is apparent. ' Upon the summary statement thus made, the Secretary respectfully recommends that all authority or power in this Department to pass upon claims that do not accrue Avithin a brief period before they are presented, and which are not steadily prosecuted by the claimants, be taken away; that no claim once passed upon by the Department shall be reopened, and that the decisions heretofore rendered shall be final. I t is possible that, in acting upon the multitude of claims growing out of a great war, injustice has tn some cases been done, and that honest claims have not been paid, whUe some fraudulent claims have been paid. But greater injustice would be done by reopening claims growing out of the war. I t is the best policy to consider all such claims not heretofore paid as closed, unless Congress, by special acts in particular cases, shall extend appropriate relief. There should be a limitation of time within which a claim should be presented, and a like limitation Avithin which a suit in behalf of the United States should be commenced. Such a limitation is especially XXXVI REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. needed as to suits brought by the United States against sureties on official bonds. In some cases, claims against the principal debtor, long delayed by the neglect of the Government, are unjustly pressed against .the surety. Nearly all the fraudulent and exaggerated claims that have been presented to this Department are alleged to have accrued long since, and the evidence of the facts that would be a complete defence is lost by time. Such claims are supported by plausible affidaAdts, and, in some cases, by forgery and perjury. A statute of Umitations in all cases would be a proper measure, not only as to claims between citi-. zens, but as to claims for or against the Government. The Secretary recommends this subject to the attention of Congress. BUREAU OF ENGRAVINa AND PRINTING. Of the appropriation of $800,000 for the payment of labor and expenses in this bureau for the present fiscal year, $600,000 AVUI remain unexpended at the close of the year. The internal-revenue stamps for cigars, hquors, snuff, and tobacco, printed under contract by the New York bank-note companies last year, wUl be printed in the bureau the current year, at a reduction in cost to the Government of $68,841 89. The printing of the backs of legal-tender notes and of the five-doUar national-currency notes, last year done by the Columbian Bank-Note Company, of this city, wiU also be executed in the bureau, and at a reduction in cost, as compared with the rates paid last year, of $40,254 30. The act making appropriations for the legislatiA^e, executive, and judi<}ial expenses of the Government for the present fiscal year, (19 Statutes .at Large, p. 152,) appropriates for dies, paper, and stamps for the internal revenue, $466,000, the engraving ahd printing to be done in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the Treasury Department, provided the cost does not exceed the prices paid tinder existing contracts. The contracts referred to were made in 1874 with the American, National, and Continental Bank-Note Companies, and were terminable *on ninety days' notice. On the 20th day of June last, the Secretary xequested the Chief of the Bureau to make such observations as he desired upon the comparative cost of printing internal-revenue stamps by private companies and by the bureau, and in T&plj received, on the 23d of June, a statement that the stamps referred to could be done by the bureau for $227,590, as against $296,431 89 paid to the bank-note companies last year, all of the printing to be done by plate and surface-printing from steel-plates. Being satisfied that this saving could be effected, and the law preferring that the work be done in the Treasury Department, the Secretary, on the 25th of June, gave the required ninety days' notice, and on the 1st of October REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXXVII authorized the work to be done in the bureau. The adhesive and proprietary stamps used by the Commissioner of Internal Eevenue are stiU printed by the National Bank-Note Company, under a contract made August 15, 1875, which took effect September 1, 1875, and is stUl in • force. As these classes of stamps have ncA^er been executed by the bureau, and may not have been intended to be included by Congress in the pro Adsion referred to, no disturbance has been made of the preAdously existing arrangements. On the accession of the present Secretary to the Department, all the printing upon the notes, bonds, and securities ofthe United States and the notes of the national banks Avas done in the bureau and department except the green backs ofthe legal-tenders and the. black backs of the national-bank fives. These were executed by the Columbian Bank-Note Company of this city under a contract made February 20, 1877, and terminable on ninety days' notice. Inasmuch as the prices named in this contract were fixed in the original contract dated June, 1874, when the cost of labor and material was much higher than now, the Secretary deemed it for the interest of the GoA^ernment to terminate it, so that the whole subject of engraving and printing by private companies would be within the power of the Government at the meeting of Congress. The act providing for the expenses of the bureau for the current fiscal year requires that the work shaU be performed at the Treasury Department if it can be done as cheaply, as perfectly, and as safely as elsewhere. (19 Statutes at Large, p. 353.) To determine the question of the cost of'executing work in the bureau and elsewhere, the Secretary issued an adA^ertisement, September 6, iuAdting proposals, on the 25th of t h a t month, for printing the green backs on legal-tender notes and the black backs on national-currency notes, for the period of one year from the 1st of October. The estimate of the bureau on both classes of work, being an average of $8 71 per thousand perfect sheets, as against $18 per thousand paid the bank-note company last year, and less than the bid of any of the companies, the Secretary deemed it to be his duty, under the law, to bring this work vdthin the bureau, at least for the present. After careful examination the Secretary is satisfied that the work, as done in the bureau, is more perfectly done than that heretofore done in private establishments, even at the high rates paid. Upon the question of safety, the Secretary cannot see how it is possible for the GoA^ernment to be better protected from fraud or mistake than it now is. But the question of safety being one of public poUcy, the consideration of which properly belongs to Congress, the Secretary respectfully submits it to that bod}^, Avith XXXVIII R E P O R T OF T H E SECRETARY OF T H E TREASURY. the remark that, as the Government has been able with absolute safety by its OAvn agents, to \"make and issue its gold and silver coin, analogy would indicate a similar course as to its paiDer circulation, and experience shows its practicability. On the 20th of March last, the Secretary appointed a committee consisting of three experienced officers of the Department, to make a thorough examination of the bureau as then organized and conducted. Upon the report of that committee, there v^ere discharged, April 18 and April 30, five hundred and thu-ty-eight persons, whose annual pay was about $390,000. On the first day of May, the bureau was put in charge of new officers, who have re-organized it in every branch, and have transformed it into an admirable workshop, as it was the purpose of the law it should be—where the public work can be done vdth cheapness, safety, and excellence;. All the i3apers relating to the various transactions referred to are transmitted hercAvith. The Secretary respectfully recommends that Congress appropriate a sum sufficient to erect a substantial fire-proof building for. the work performed by this bureau, and for such other serAdce of a mechanical nature as may from time to time be required. For considerations which justify this recommendation, and for details, the Secretary refers to the accompanjdng report of the Chief of the bureau. , PUBLIC MONEYS In the report of the Treasurer of the United States, herewith submitted, there is set forth a detaUed statement of the monetary trans-' actions of the GoA^ernment during the past year. I t Avill be seen that the coin resources of the Treasury on all accounts from September 30, 1876, to September 30, 1877, had increased from $67,586,7,05 95 to $133,585,072 24, and the currency resources from $100,437,766 44 to $110,096,039 01. ' Since the issue of sih^er coin commenced there has been returned to the Treasury for redemption a largely-increased amount of minor coins for which there is no demand. On September 29, 1877, there was on hand of these coins an amount of $870,140 54, constituting a portion of the currency balance of the Treasury practically unaA^ailable for current use, and occupying the Treasury vaults to an inconvenient extent. The necessary legislation for their proper disposition is recominended. SPECIAL AGENTS. The Secretary calls attention to the accompanying report, showing the transactions in the DiAdsion of Special Agents of Customs. Only REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. XXXIX twenty agents are now authorized to be employed. Until recently the number was fifty-three, and, in view of the extent and character of the duties devolAdng upon them, it is recomm'ended that the number be increased to at least thirty. COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION. The Eegister of the Treasury reports the total tonnage of vessels of the United States to be 4,242,600 tons, a decrease of 36,858 tons from that of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1876. The actual decrease is beUeved to be about 13,563 tons, this amount being the excess of the losses over the gains during the last fiscal year, the balance being accounted for by dropping canal-boats, exempt under the act of Congress approved AprU 18, 1874. The foUoAving table exhibits the total tonnage for the last two years: 1877. 1876. 'Vessels. Registered, engaged in foreign t r a d e . Enrolled and licensed, engaged in domestic commerce Total Tons.

The number of vessels built is 1,029. Official numbers have been aAvarded by the Bureau of Statistics during the fiscal year to 1,291 vessels, whose carrying capacity amounts to 217,541 tons, and since July 1, 1877, to 563 vessels, of the aggregate tonnage of 119,639, as the follovdng statement more fully shows: Statement. showing the numher, class, and tonnage of vessels officially numbered during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1877.

For many years this class of vessels has been increasing, and the water-transportation of merchandise upon such rivers has been graduaUy passing from steamvessels to barges and other craft of temporary structure, which are towed or propelled by steam or sail-vessels. The act of 1874 exempted canal-boats and boats employed on the internal waters of States from enrolment, so that a discrimination now practically exists between vessels propelled neither by steam nor saUs, as regards their UabUity to enrolment, dependent simply upon the question whether they are or are not iisuaUy employed on the internal waters of a State, in connection Avith their employment on naAdgable waters of the United States. The purely temporary character of many of these vessels renders it difficult to apply to them the proAdsions for enrolment that are applicable to Aressels propeUed by steam or sails, especiaUy as they are so constructed as to admit neither of a permanent crew nor of a master who remains on board. The discrimination as regards enrolment is, besides, a gratuitouscause of dissatisfaction among that portion ofthe mercantile community wiiich makes use of craft not propelled directly by steam or sails. All these vessels should be subjected to a system of hcense and enrolment different from that now in force, or all should be exempted firom enrolment. I t is belicA^ed t h a t the mercantile community- would prefer enrolment, if the, fees for the preliminary admeasurement were moderate, and the system of enrolling now tn force were less complex.
