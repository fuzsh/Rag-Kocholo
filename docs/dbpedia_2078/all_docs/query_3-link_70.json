        "text": "Countess Monica Bonde (the daughter of count Carl Johan Bernadotte af Wisborg) hosted a dinner to her friends at Svensk Damtidning's serie.\n\nMonica tells that when she was a child, neither she or her brother Christian were allowed to go to the kitchen. The housemaids took care of cooking and of the household. Only when Monica got married and got children she really started to cook more. She has made simple food, her children have eaten a lot of panncakes and macaroni, and casseroles. Monica worked 27 years for Svensk Damtidning. She tells that she was raised at a home where order was important. Monica says that her father could not even cook an egg, but he was extremely careful about the food. They had always mealtimes and then the table was set fine with inherited porslin and napkins in napkin rings. They got to learn an exemplary table manners and to thank for the food. And they had many fun parties at home with fine food. There were always exciting celebrities visiting, like Greta Garbo, Jarl Kulle, Holger Löwenadler, because Monica's parents had a wide network and gladly had their friends at home for a nice meal.\n\nMonica (called Mica) was sent to a boarding school for girls in Switzerland, where she would learn both languages, housework and good conduct. But the only thing she learned was to dance, Monica tells with a smile. She instead went into her mother's footsteps and became a journalist. She has three grown children - Ebba, Marianne and Carl Johan - and three grandchildren. She lives beautifully in a villa on Djurgården in a home that contains royal memories, with lots of art and with a lot of things Monica has inherited from her father. The table is decorated with a silver saucer from Gustaf VI Adolf, and the napkins come from Prince Eugen. The porcelain from Gustavsberg she inherited from her father. The champagne glasses are also from Carl Johan Bernadotte. On a table in the lounge there are a variety of silver items which belonged to Queen Louise, and on the walls hangs art, also from Prince Eugen and Crown Princess Margareta.\n\nOne of Monica's guests for this dinner was countess Marianne Bernadotte.\n\nImage Upper.com - Free Image Hosting - View Image\n\nImage Upper.com - Free Image Hosting - View Image\n\nHappy Birthday to her!\n\nJust for curiosity - list of her descendants:\n\n12.2.2.1.Dagmar Bernadotte, Countess af Wisborg (*1916), m.1936 Nils-Magnus von Arbin (1910-1985)\n\n12.2.2.1.1.Marianne von Arbin (1937-2006), m.1958 (div 1967) Miles Flach (1934-2011)\n\n12.2.2.1.1.1.son (1959-1959)\n\n12.2.2.1.1.2.Camilla Flach (*1960), m.1990 (div 2006) Steven Wearing (*1957)\n\n12.2.2.1.1.2.1.Fredrik Wearing (*1991)\n\n12.2.2.1.1.2.2.Maxine Wearing (*1993)\n\n12.2.2.1.2.Louise von Arbin (*1940), m.1961 (div 1971) Per-Erik (Dick) Bergström (1936-2007), m.2nd 1980 Gustaf Mårtensson (*1938)\n\n12.2.2.1.2.1.Thérese Bergström (*1963), m.1st 1990 (div 2005) Peter Aspelund (*1958), m.2nd 2009 (div) Håkan Johansson (*1958)\n\n12.2.2.1.2.1.1.Oscar Aspelund (*1991)\n\n12.2.2.1.2.1.2.Marcus Aspelund (*1996)\n\n12.2.2.1.2.2.Michael Bergström (*1965)\n\n12.2.2.1.3.Cathrine von Arbin (*1946), m.1st 1970 (div 1984) Johan Ryding (*1943), m.2nd 1989 (div) Olle Ljungberg (*1946)\n\n12.2.2.1.3.1.Gustaf Ryding (*1971), m.1st 2006 (div 2010) Baroness Louise Barnekow (*1972), m.2nd 2016 Alexandra Ekman (*1978)\n\n12.2.2.1.3.1.1.Nils Ryding (*2006)\n\n12.2.2.1.3.1.2.[by 2nd wife] son (*2015)\n\n12.2.2.1.3.2.Charlotta Ryding (*1974)\n\n12.2.2.1.3.3.Carl Ryding (*1978), m.2010 Sanna Billestedt (*1980)\n\n12.2.2.1.3.4.Victor Ljungberg (*1988)\n\n12.2.2.1.4.Jeanette von Arbin (*1951), m.1976 Esben Colfach (*1947)\n\n12.2.2.1.4.1.Fredrik Colfach (*1978), m.2008 Louise Pålsson (*1977)\n\n12.2.2.1.4.1.1.Oscar Colfach (*2010)\n\n12.2.2.1.4.1.2.Ian Colfach (*2013)\n\n12.2.2.1.4.2.Peder Colfach (*1981), m.2016 Sara Persson (*1983)\n\n12.2.2.1.4.3.Christian Colfach (*1983), m.2013 Emilie Jürgenthal (*1982)\n\n12.2.2.1.4.3.1.Ebba Colfach (*2015)\n\n12.2.2.1.5.Madeleine von Arbin (*1955), m.1981 (div 2000) Baron Gerard De Geer af Finspång (*1954)\n\n12.2.2.1.5.1.Baroness Jana De Geer af Finspång (*1983), m.2016 Johan Gummesson (*1980)\n\n12.2.2.1.5.2.Baroness Adrienne De Geer af Finspång (*1984), m.2014 Gustav Heurlin (*1985)\n\n12.2.2.1.5.3.Baron Louis De Geer af Finspång (*1988), m.2014 Josefin Maria Bakos (*1982)\n\n12.2.2.1.5.3.1.Baron Edward De Geer af Finspång (*2012)\n\n12.2.2.1.5.3.2.Baroness Iselin De Geer af Finspång (*2014)"
