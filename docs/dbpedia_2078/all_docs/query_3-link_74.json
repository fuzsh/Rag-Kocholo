CHAPTER XXXIX. The Tenth Expedition, i 653-1 654. I. We have seen that no ship was dispatched to New Sweden after 1649, although Printz had written several times, implor- ing for aid. The letters to Brahe and Oxenstierna of April 26, 1653, stating that new supplies were absolutely necessary in the colony, arrived at Stockholm in the late summer. These seem to have Impressed the authorities with the fact that the settle- ment could no longer be neglected and there were at last signs of awakened interest In the same and renewed activities In Its behalf at the capital. The company was discussed In the Coun- cil of State and the Queen once more instructed the Commercial College to take over its management. Eric Oxenstierna, who in August, 1652, had been made General Director of the col- lege, returned to Sweden In the summer of 1653 and new life was put into that body.* He was also greatly interested in the colonial work and to him was largely due the efforts that were soon made to send out a new expedition. Further consultations were had in the council about the mat- ter in August, at which reports and suggestions were presented, and it was at last decided that the various requests of Printz for ammunition, supplies for his new ship and other things should be granted. The Admiralty, as has been seen, was in arrears to the company for several thousand R.D. As a conse- quence It had been proposed on several occasions that the gov- ' Cf. Fries, E. Oxenstierna, p. 124 ff. 469 470 The Swedish Settlements on the Delaware. ernment should prepare the ships for the next expedition. The question was brought up again at this time and the Queen agreed to the plan, instructing the Admiralty on August 13, to fit out the Wismar for a voyage to New Sweden. The Queen had determined, says the instruction, to send 300 colonists and a large cargo to the South River, in order that the undertaking there should not go to ruin. On the same day the war depart- ment was ordered to supply ammunition for the colony accord- ing to an enclosed list and the preparations for the expedition were soon in full progress.^ For some reason \" the Crown's ship Orn,^ lying at anchor in the harbor of Stockholm, was selected to make the voyage instead of the Wismar and Cap- tain Bockhorn* was appointed to sail the vessel. As the expedi- tion was to consist of two ships, the company arranged to pre- pare the Gyllene Haj,^ and on the day before the above instruc- tions were issued the Commercial College had ordered Hans Kramer to deliver 600 D. to Peter Friedell to be used for the supplies of the ship. About two weeks later (August 25) Kramer, through orders from the college, supplied 2,550 D.s.m. to Admiral Anckar- hjelm, who was also to buy provisions and pay the wages of the colonists and sailors at Gothenburg before they set sail. On Sep- tember 28 an instruction was sent to the admiral concerning the journey of the ship to Virginia and, as some changes had been ''R.R., August 13, 1653, fol. 1572-3. ^ The Eagle.

Served on the \" Gotheborgiske confardie \" ship for some time until in April, 1652. March 30 he was ordered to report to Stockholm for service. In the fall of 1653 he was ordered to sail to New Sweden on the Orn. In 1656 he left Swedish service to try his luck in other places, receiving good recommendations from the government. But he again returned to Sweden and during the winters of 1660 and 1662 he made journeys to Germany and Holland for private purposes and passes were given him by the Admiralty. Am.

On the same day the cashier of the Admiralty was ordered to deliver 68 D. s.m. for one \"Am \"* French brandy to be put on the Orn. Kramer also purchased quantities of supplies in Stockholm about this time and several hundred barrels of bread and flour and a large sup- ply of nails and other goods were soon brought on board the ship.'' A great number of colonists were to be collected for the ex- pedition. Many had, from time to time, applied for permission to go to New Sweden, but the number of settlers, who had expressed their willingness to immigrate, was not sufficient. Ac- cordingly Sven Skute was appointed to hire soldiers and laborers and to prevail upon others to go as settlers. On August 23 Kramer gave him 300 D.s.m. for which he should engage the people, a letter being sent to Governor Per Ribbing on the following day, requesting him to assist in the matter, and on the twenty-fifth an instruction in six paragraphs was issued for him. He should hire 50 soldiers, including those already engaged, especially such as had a trade, and he was to collect 250 colonists \" of which the greatest part [must be] good men, fewer women and fewest children.\" He was to offer the soldiers at the most 4 R.D. a month (less if possible) and he should especially endeavor to find farmhands* and colonists, who were willing to go without pay, but such as needed financial aid he was to promise a certain sum, always as small as possible and in no case more than 30 D.k.m. a year until they could be settled on land in New Sweden. First of all he was to gather as many as he was able at Vasteras, sending them at once to the capital, that they might go to Gothenburg by the Orn. From there he Â°Cf. above, Chap.

When the recruits at these places were all hired, they should be kept in readiness to proceed to Gothen- burg as soon as Skute heard from President Broman^ that the Orn had passed through the Sound.\" It is probable that Skute proceeded at once to carry out these instructions for it seems he had completed his work at Vasteras in the beginning of September, as Johan Rising wrote to him on September lo that he should continue his work in Varmland and Dalsland, keep the people in readiness until he heard from his \" Excellency [E. Oxenstierna] and report all matters of im- portance to Rising or the Commercial CoUege.\"^^ The people hired in Vasteras gradually made their appear- ance at Stockholm, where a number of men had been hired by Kramer,^^ among whom was a millwright,^^ engaged at a sal- ary of 40 D. a month. Twelve children (boys) from the Bild- ing College of the city of Stockholm were also sent to New Sweden on these ships.\" The Orn was now almost ready to sail, and in the beginning of October a memorial was given to Captain Bockhorn by the Admiralty, instructing him to set out at once for Gothenburg and requesting him to follow the orders he was to receive from the Commercial College In all matters pertaining to the journey.*^ The ship left Stockholm on October 8, touching at Helsingor, Copenhagen and other ports, and arrived at Gothenburg on November 8.\" The soldiers and colonists were now rushed to \"President in Gothenburg. \"Instruction for S.

Twelve barrels of butter, twenty barrels of bread, one hundred and thirty-six barrels of beer and several hogsheads of wine and other food stuffs, obtained for the journey, as well as shoes, clothes, imple- ments, sails and supplies for the new ship and a great variety of other goods,^^ which had been bought by Anckarhjelm through orders from the Commercial College, were gradually loaded upon the vessel. Anckarhjelm showed great diligence in these preparations. He bought most of the goods with his own money and supplied large sums to the sailors. Upon the arrival of the ship he caused new barrels to be made for the packing of the provisions and cabins to be built for the people. Disputes arose between the officers, threatening to retard the work, but the admiral was instructed to preserve discipline and his interference seems to have restored order. ^* In the meantime the Gyllene Haj was detained at Stockholm as she was not in a sea-faring condition.

He had been appointed captain of the ship in August,^^ but he was now old and unfit for such service. On October 6 the Admiralty issued a memorial to him. He should sail to New Sweden by way of Porto Rico, where he was to de- mand damages for the Katt according to the revised bill of the losses and the orders which were to be given him by the Com- mercial College. On December 13 an instruction In eleven paragraphs was drawn up for him, relating to his duties on the journey, his commission In Porto Rico and his office In New Sweden, and a letter of appointment with special reference to his labors In the colony was signed the same day. Both docu- ments were issued by the Commercial College and they were probably sent with Rising to Gothenburg on December 19.^^ About the beginning of December, as the Instructions and let- ters were ready, Gustaf Printz arrived in the capital after a long voyage. The ship Marie, on which he had left Amer- ica, touched at Portsmouth in September and reported that it came from New Sweden under the command of Printz. It was put under arrest by order of the Commissioners of Customs in London and, although demands were made for Its release, It was not freed for some time. 2=* But Printz succeeded In reach- ing Stockholm, where he appeared before the Commercial Col- \" \" Small herring.\" ''Journal, nos. mo, 1115, 1137-39, \"4i-3, \"46-52, 1156-63. \"\"Pass for Capt.

This gave fur- ther impetus to the preparations and a letter was written to Governor Printz requesting him to remain in the country, as assistance would immediately be sent and he would be rewarded for his service.^* While the preparations for provisioning the ships and gather- ing colonists were going on, steps were also taken for the reor- ganization of the company and for the further development of New Sweden. Printz had at various times earnestly requested to be released from his services as he found his duties too arduous and the means at his disposal too small. He had on each occasion been commanded to remain. Now his request was partly to be granted, but not in the form of a recall â€” a commissary was to be sent out, who should aid him in his work. Johan Rising, the secretary in the Commercial College, was ap- pointed to this position. Rising, being greatly interested in economic and judicial questions, had studied abroad for some time and paid much attention to the colonial policy and com- mercial activity of Holland. He had visited England and be- come acquainted with English economic theories and colonial views and, as he had given much time to the study of com- merce, trade and agriculture, he was engaged to write a treatise on these subjects. He was of a practical bent of mind and a patriot, whose thoughts were ever occupied with problems that concerned the welfare of Swedish shipping, Swedish trade and Swedish colonies and he was therefore particularly well equipped and apparently most suitable for the position of coun- cillor and assistant to Governor Printz. He was recommended to the position by Eric Oxenstlerna and the chancellor and ad- vised by them to accept the office.*^ The offer seems to have been agreeable to him and he willingly accepted It. He has given us his own reasons for doing so. In the first place he considered the colony a splendid sphere for the exercise of his \"^Com. Col.

Rising left his services in the Commercial College towards the end of October,''* and December 9 the government issued a commission formally appointing him to his position as well as defining his duties.^^ On December 12a number of documents concerning Rising's commission were issued by the government (a Certificate of Appointment, a Memorial,^* etc.) and an order was sent to the \" Kammar KoUegium,\" assigning 1,500 D. for his travel- ling expenses.^Â® A few days later the treasurer was ordered to pay this money to Rising, including 536 D. which remained on his salary in the Commercial College for 1653. He was also knighted and a large donation of land was given to him. About the middle of December^** a long instruction was pre- pared by the Commercial College and on the same date a \" memorial \" concerning his journey to Gothenburg and the voy- age across the ocean was signed by the officers of the college. He was to proceed to Gothenburg without delay. On his arrival there he was to inform the magistrates of the new regu- lations that had been issued concerning New Sweden and he was to prevail upon private parties to send goods on the ship at their own risk for tradie in the colony. He was to have free passage to New Sweden and he could bring over from ten to twelve colonists without expense except that he must pay for their provisions. He was to have supervision over the ships during the voyage and he was to see that Divine services were \"The last signature by Rising as secretary of the college is found on page m, of the Reg., for October 29, 1653.

In the bay they experienced another sudden gust of wind, which snapped the foresail and mizzen sail from the rigging, as though they had been cut with a knife, and carried them far out to sea, while the ship was thrown violently on her leeward side.

On February i the Com- mercial College requested Kramer to send them the bills and inform them whether or not money could be supplied in Stock- holm by the company or through draft on Joachim Korts in Riga,^ but there was no money in the treasury before the \"tobacco participants\" paid part or all of the 12,800 D. k.m. * Amundsson to E.

He hired a mate, supplied more money to the sailors and did everything in his power to rush the sailing of the ship. In the beginning of March the preparations were completed, except for some flour and a large quantity of rye for seed. Since no seed corn was on the Orn Rising proposed that \" 20 or 30 barrels \" of good rye and barley be sent in the Haj. Later, however, it was decided not to load the rye into the ship, as it would take too much room and could be bought cheaply in New England. Printz had asked that the expedition be delayed until he arrived in Sweden, as he had some suggestions to make, but the Commercial Col- lege ordered the vessel to sail as soon as there was a favorable wind.\" We have seen that the discipline among the sailors on the Haj was not of the best. Amundsson, who had been appointed captain on the journey and supervisor of the ship-building in New Sweden, had proved himself incompetent. Repeated com- plaints were made against him, so that the college found it advisable to have him removed. Two new men, Sven Hook and Hendrick von Elswick, were already in sight for the position. Lieut. Hook, who sought a post in New Sweden, was appointed to perform Amundsson's duties in the colony as well as to com- mand the vessel on the voyage and a commission was signed for him on March 4.Â® Hendrick von Elswick was a merchant in Stockholm, who had applied to Rising for permission to go to New Sweden as \"Commiss or head-merchant\" and, as Rising knew him per- sonally, he recommended him to Eric Oxenstlerna.'^ His ap- pointment was talked about In the Commercial College and * Cora.

Within the next ten days he appeared before the college, received his commission as factor in New Sweden, being also appointed to have charge of the expedition to Porto Rico in the place of Amundsson.

At the same time the Admiral, being informed of the change in the appointments by the Commercial College, was ordered by the Admiralty to take the instruction as well as all other documents from Amundsson and give them to Elswick and' Hook.

A sail-maker from Bergen was also engaged at the rate of thirteen florins a month and two months' wages were given him in advance.^^ But a carpenter could not be hired, although Elswick did his best to find one. He went to Kongelf'^* and Marstrand\" and \"inquired with diligence for a ship-carpenter,\" but all to no avail. There were two carpenters on the Hercules, one of whom desired to go to America, but Anckarhjelm had no authority to give him leave, consequently Elswick requested the college to apply to the Admiralty for his permission to sail on the vessel, suggesting that \" he could be used to great advantage at ship-building in New Sweden.\" Admiral Anckarhjelm also wrote to Stockholm about It, but since only Fleming was present in the Admiralty, no definite order could be given, and Anckar- hjelm was advised to find a carpenter elsewhere.

On the way many of the people became sick, the water supply became low and it was found necessary to touch at the island of St. Christopher, which they did on the 17th of June, being informed that the Orn had been there two months before. New supplies were again brought on board and on June 26 they continued their journey, arriving at Porto Rico on June 30.^^ Governor Jacobus de Aquilera was aware of their coming, for \" he waited on the shore with his Carethe and many prominent persons, immediately sending a large boat, which brought . . .

Several settlers having been politely denied per- mission by Stuyvesant, at least for a time, to settle in New Netherland, \" inasmuch as he did not know whether it would be well or ill received\" by the Dutch West India Company,^ made secret application to the authorities in Virginia and Mary- land to be allowed to go there. Here they received a hearty welcome and fifteen settlers deserted and fled to the English colony on the south. When Papegoja was aware of their flight, he hired some Indians \"to bring them back,\" but they resisted \" and put themselves on the defense against the sav- ages, who had been sent after them [so that two] . . . were struck down whose heads were brought into Fort Christina.\"^ The assistant commissary, Gotfried Harmer, being one of the deserters, seems to have been the chief instigator and he wrote letters to some of the Swedes after his arrival in Virginia, ad- vising them to leave the colony and go over to the English. It was also said that Hendrick Huygen played false to the Swedes.^ We know nothing further about the events in New Sweden from October, 1653, until May, 1654, except that the Indians ^Doc, I. 590, 600-t; XII. 73.

It was the Swedish salute ; ships had arrived at last! A few hours later, \"Vice-Commissary Jacob Svensson with some Swedish freemen \" was sent down the river to ascertain the facts. They went on board the Orn and \" all proved that they were happy on account of the arrival\" of the ship. A little later Vice-Governor Papegoja also went down to the Swedish vessel, welcomed Rising and reported the condi- tion of the country. The immigrants \"were now very ill on the ship and the smell was so strong that it was impossible to endure it any longer. It was therefore agreed that Papegoja should bring the people ashore in the morning with the sloop, the yacht and other crafts, which was accordingly done on the twenty-second. The people were partly distributed among the freemen up in the river, partly taken to Fort Christina, where they were nursed with all care.\" The same day Rising and his officers also entered the fort \" and were well received by the vice-governor and the other Swedes.\"^ The instructions and memorials given to Rising before his departure from Upsala in December, 1653, authorized him, in case the governor had left the country or would not remain, to take charge of the government. He as well as Lindestrom and other officers were indisposed the first few days after their landing, due to the hardships and inconveniences of the journey and the change of climate, but already on May 23 arrange- ments were made for the new form of government, which the departure of Printz made necessary. \"The Orders of Her Royal Majesty as well as the Instructions and Memorials of the Commercial College were read in the presence of [Director Johan Rising], Capt.

These instructions and memorials (minute and de- tailed, in several of their provisions resembling those given to Printz eleven years before) intrusted to Rising the \"direction of the political, judicial and commercial affairs of the colony,\" leaving the military management to other officers. \" His duty should especially be to bring the country on a prosperous foot- ing;\" he should occupy and clear new land and assign planta- tions to the freemen ; he should plant tobacco, sow grain, hemp and linseed, cultivate grapes and fruit trees and experiment with silk-worms and the growing of ginger and sugar-cane; he should found cities, select harbors and begin commerce, seeking to draw all the trade in the river into the hands of the Swedes ; he should prospect for minerals; he should select land for the company and work it for the benefit of the same; he should establish ropewalks, saw-mills, tanneries, tarburneries and man- ufactories of wooden utensils of all kinds, as well as fisheries in the rivers, streams and lakes ; he should keep peace with the Indians, Dutch and English as far as possible, but he should also fortify the country with all vigor and ward off attack with the best means at hand ; he should seek to increase the popula- tion of the colony and extend its settlement by inviting all valuable and industrious colonists to settle under the Swedish jurisdiction, but he should send away and remove (with cau- tion) all who might be a disturbance or a hindrance to the prosperity of the settlement; he should draw up good ordi- nances, make rules for hunting and the preservation of the forest, preventing all indiscriminate cutting of trees, as well as ordinances concerning the trade, the agriculture and other pur- suits ; he should institute commercial relations with Africa ; he should send game, beer, bread and brandy to Spain and lumber and wood-materials to the Canary Islands; he was to handle the money sent from the Mother Country, supervise the hand- ling of the merchandise and see that proper and correct books were kept; he was to raise money for the purpose of the colonial government, and finally he was to appoint \"persons who could judge according to the law of Sweden and Its right- 500 The Swedish Settlements on the Delaware. ful custom In order that justice and righteousness may have their course in the land.\"\" Rising now took over the leadership of the colony with the title of Director of New Sweden, appointing Sven Skute and Johan Papegoja as his assistants, who together with the direc- tor \"would rule the country . . . under the authority of Her Royal Majesty and the Crown of Sweden until other orders were received,\" in special cases in connection with a council of \" other good men,\" appointed for the purpose. With the first opportunity the director summoned the free- men and proclaimed to them the new Royal privileges concern- ing the settlement. The private colonists were granted the right to trade freely with the neighbors and the Indians; they could buy their lands direct from the savages or from the com- pany and, by paying an export duty of 2 per cent, they could ship every form of produce from the colony, including gold and silver (other minerals being excluded), to Sweden and its dependencies duty free.'^ The land in New Sweden had been purchased from the savages for the company (by goods be- longing to it) under the protection and jurisdiction of the Swedish government and the Crown regarded its colony on the Delaware in the same light as its European possessions, with right to grant lands and allodial freedoms to its servants. Several such grants were made in 1653. They were to be in force only after the governor or the director had given an admission and certificate to the effect in order to prevent con- fusion.^ The land, that might be bought by individual free- men either from the company or from the savages, would be- '\" Instruction,\" December 15, 1654; \"Memorial for Rising,\" December 18, 1653 ; Authorization for Rising, December 18, 1653, Com.

But, since there had been mutinies and much trouble during Printz's time, it was found necessary to examine into the charges and counter-charges that were made and it was hoped that all the inhabitants of New Sweden from now on would act as \" true subjects of Her Royal Majesty and honest colonists.\" An oath of allegiance and promise of good conduct was then read to them and signed by forty-eight persons, eight of whom were widows of freemen.^\" In the summer and autumn of 1654 provisions were made for carrying out certain paragraphs of the instructions and memorials regarding the Internal affairs of the colony. Towards the end of July several new appointments were made, the gunner, Johan Stalkofta, being commissioned to \"pre- pare material and planks for the buildings that were to be erected from time to time,\" the corporal, Anders Olofsson, to superintend the agriculture and the ensign, Peter Hansson Wendel, to manage the plantations and the clearing of the land.

Three days later these letters (from the gov- ernment and the Commercial College) were read to the people, who were assembled at a court in Fort Christina. There were promises of aid and it seems that Rising and his council took a bright view of the situation, for plans were now made for partly reorganizing the internal government of the settlement and for providing a sort of constitution or rule of conduct.^^ \" On October 27 the best men [in the colony] were called together at Fort Christina and an ordinance was drafted.\" Rising says that It \" was made by us jointly,\" but it is more than probable that he presented a draft of the ordinance to the commission and that the different points were taken up and dis- cussed. Several changes and suggestions may have been offered by the members, but the draft as presented by Rising undoubtedly underwent few changes.^* The ordinance was proclaimed both among the Swedes and Dutch colonists, \"but it could not be put into execution before succor should arrive from the fatherland.\" In 1653, when preparations were on foot for the sending of a new expedition to New Sweden, a tentative budget was made. The salaries and wages of the officers (including the preacher, Nertunius, and the barber-surgeon, Stidden) and fifty soldiers were estimated at 3,722 R.D. \"A budget was also drawn up for one hundred and fifty landspeople, skilled workmen and peasants, with wages amounting to 1,200 R.D.

Concerning the people, their passage hither and their stay in the country, etc. 1. Soldiers are to serve at least three years or more and, if they then have anything coming to them, they may be rewarded not only in merchandise and money but also with pieces of land for an everlasting possession. When a soldier has served for three years he shall not be required to pay for [his] passage or transportation, but, if he leaves the service sooner, then [he shall] pay his passage according to the time, which is left on his term of three years of service, namely â€” one half, one third, one fourth, etc. 2. If anyone should desire to hire one or more soldiers for his own work, he shall apply to the one who is in command of the soldiers at that place, and if the service of the company will allow it, he may hire one or more of the soldiers by the week and deduct from it the pay of the soldiers, etc. 3. All the officers of the company shall be free from [the payment of their] passage and transportation as well as any servant of the Crown, above [the rank of] a corporal, etc. 4. The passage, board and transportation of the freemen, their wives and children, widows, male servants and maid servants shall be esti- mated at the rate of sixteen riks daler per head over three years of age, besides their monthly rations here in the country, which they are after- wards to pay here in time, etc. 5. Every freeman brought over shall pay this passage and transporta- tion of sixteen riks daler in the third year after he has settled here, whether he is a workman or a farmer, etc. 6. Whoever desires to take into his service a laborer or a freeman, his children, his male servant or maid servant, he must pay the above mentioned transportation money after the lapse of a year and these engaged servants shall serve him in three years for board and necessary clothes, but if they, before the expiration of three years, take service with another or enter marriage, then the one, who takes them out of the service of the first, shall give so much of the transportation money as remains of their time of service, namely one half, one third, one fourth, etc., unless the master will remit it out of good will or in whatever So6 The Swedish Settlements on the Delaware. manner they may best agree according to the quality of the persons, etc. 7. Whoever takes children to himself who have been brought over [from Sweden] to bring up shall pay for them the said transportation money of sixteen riks daler when they have become fourteen years of age whereupon they shall serve for wages. If such children are brought up with several, the one shall pay the said money who has them in his service (when they are full fourteen years old). If such a child dies before the age of fourteen the transportation shall also die, etc. 8. Whoever hires from the company an indented servant over four- teen years of age shall give, besides the said transportation money, addi- tional twenty-four riks daler and then the servant shall serve him in six consecutive years. The servant shall annually be given board, shoes and shirts. After six years of service an indentured servant shall be entirely free, etc. 9. If an indentured servant has served the company here in the coun- try a year more or less, then so much of the servant's time and service shall be deducted from his second engagement in order that an inden- tured servant may become free after six years, etc. 10. Whatever a servant may gain through work, handicraft or manual labor, hunting or fishing, commerce or trade or with anything else, that shall all belong to his employer unless the latter grants it to him. 1 1 . Every master shall give his indentured servants or employees suffi- ciently good board and proper clothes so that there can be no just cause for complaint. If anyone is found to do otherwise, he shall be brought to court and fined according to the case, etc. 12. No one shall entice or prevail upon another's [servant] people [to leave him] on penalty of 8 riks daler's fine for the first offence, twice as much for the second and three times as much for the third. . . .^2 And in all these cases he shall be obliged to bring back the servant to his master, etc. 13. If anyone's servant or hired man runs away from his master out of spite, then no one shall knowingly conceal the same in his house over 24 hours on penalty of 24 riks daler's fine, but shall make it known at once to the master if he is near enough or otherwise to the neighbors and try to return the servant to his master, which everyone shall do to the other. The one who intentionally conceals another's servant shall pay a fine as already said, etc. 14. The hire of servants reckoned either according to days, weeks, ^ The text or my copy is corrupt here. Government and Courts of New Sweden. 507 months or years shall be reasonable and approach the monthly wage of the soldiers and no one shall raise the salary or outbid another, on penalty according to the case. 15. The said hire of the servants shall have preference above all other debts except that of the Crown and of the company, etc. II. Concerning land and agriculture. 1. Whoever buys land of the company or of anyone else shall pay in whole or according to the area in whatever manner they agree for cleared land as clear and for uncleared land as uncleared and shall pay for it more or less according to the situation for forest, streams, places for mills, fishing and the like, etc. 2. If anyone buys or receives as a gift a certain piece of land from the savages and the same has in general or particular been bought or given to the company by the same or other savages, it will remain the property of the company, but if the land has not been given or bought in general or in particular then he shall be free to possess it, etc. 3. A tunnland^^ holds according to Swedish land measure eighteen rods in length and nine rods in breadth, at nine ells to a rod {stangY^ making 13,122 sq. ells.^Â° But since the land here in New Sweden is much richer and needs less seed, we have found it expedient to let it be tried and estimated through Engineer Mr. Per Lindestrom, how large a piece of land is needed here in New Sweden for a barrel of seed and he has found that it ought to hold nineteen rods in length and ten in breadth, each rod being nine ells, making 15,390 sq. ells, etc. 4. A tunnland is worth, when one buys it for everlasting property of the company or other possessor, namely: 1. Cleared land as stated before . . . 2. Cleared land but unprepared and uncultivated. 3. Cleared prepared and cultivated land. 5. But if one buys cultivated land of a freeman, living upon it, he is to pay according to the situation or the agreement for each tunnland namely: \"^ Cf. above. Chap. VI. ^ Stdng, about nine English feet. \"'The legal tunnland at this time was to be 7^,000 sq. alnar (ells) and not 13,122 sq. alnar. Cf. above, Chap. VI. A modern tunnland is 53,1384 sq- ft- or about i acre and i sq. rod. So8 The Swedish Settlements on the Delaware. 1. If it is cleared . . . sixteen to twenty fl. 2. Prepared so that one can sow there, thirty to fifty florins, but if the freeman, living upon it, has used it for three years [the buyer is to pay] one fourth less, if for five to six years one half less, if for eight years two thirds less and if it has been used for ten years he shall pay nothing for the clearing, but give tax according to the estimate besides the transportation, the ration and other bills if they have not been paid before,^' etc. 6. Whoever takes possession and uses the land of another shall have right to it above others, children after children, and [he] cannot be driven off unless he is in arrears for tax for three years. 7. If a renter wishes to use and cultivate the land of the company or of anyone else with the oxen and beasts of burden of the latter, then ^.}jgy26a shall give half of the seed each and the owner of the land shall furnish oxen and beasts of burden. But the renter must use the land and keep the oxen and beasts of burden over the winter at his own cost as well as harvest the hay and the grain and thrash it and then each part shall take half of the grain and of the straw, estimating according to the proof and rooketahlet{l).\" But if anyone furnishes all the seed, then the other party shall pay the other his half part of it, when- ever it is demanded. 8. If several renters live together on the same land, build, clear, plant or sow, and if one or several wish to withdraw from the others, then their entire plantations shall be valued, clearing or seeding altogether, according to the estimate of good men, and those who remain shall then pay him or them, who withdraw according to their share, or otherwise to help him or them to clear, build, plant or sow on a new place, as much as his or their share demands, etc. III. Concerning forestry. I. No one shall cut down, destroy or ruin on his own clearing, planta- tion or anywhere else any useful large tree or pine or oak tree from which wainscot,^* planks or anything else useful can be made, unless he makes it known either to the governor or other person appointed for â„¢ The Swedish is not clear, cf. text. \"'Â° I. e. the renter and the owner. \" Rafcnetalet ( ?) , estimate ?. ^Rising uses the Dutch word nuagenskott (wagenschot).

If he makes his intentions known in time and he is not supplied [with in- formation] and ordered [what to do] by those whose business it is to see to it, he shall be without blame, etc. 2. Whoever manufactures, cuts or saws, planks, clapboards, timber, wainscot or any other wood material, that can be brought out, manu- factured, cut or sawed, he shall offer it first to the company or to the one owning the land for a reasonable price and then he is free to try his best [to sell it elsewhere], etc. IV. Concerning cattle. 1. If anyone buys cattle of another he shall .pay their value according to the market and execute it as in the case of other purchase, etc. 2. If anyone rents cattle to another for half of the offspring and the produce, then he shall receive every other calf a year old, well fed and the renter shall receive every other calf, to which the cow gives birth and he shall bring the calves up well at his own expense and give to the owner annually a lispund^\" of butter in rent, but if the cow dies before the owner receives his calf the renter shall pay for her ac- cording to her price, this to be continued as long as they agree to it, etc. 3. For the offspring of goats, sheep and swine there shall be the same law yet in these cases for milk, butter, cheese and wool of the goats and sheep according to the manner in which the owner and renter may best agree, etc. This to whom it concerns for a submissive regulation.
