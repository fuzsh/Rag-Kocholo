        "text": "What Does Louis Mean?\n\nIn French, Louis means “famed warrior” or “loot bringer.” It also has German origins, where it similarly means “renowned warrior” or “famous in battle.” The meaning “famous warrior” is associated with the Latin Ludovicus, a form of Ludwig, also meaning “famous warrior.”\n\nLouis first appeared in French as the Old French Loeis, based on the Old German Hluodowig, meaning “famous in war.” The original version means “plunder (bringing) warrior.”\n\nWhat Is the Origin of the Name Louis?\n\nLouis is the proper French spelling of the colloquial Louie. It relates to the Old Frankish Chlodowig and Old German Hluodowig, made up of the Germanic “hluod,” meaning “famous,” and “wīg,” meaning “strife.”\n\nLouis is famous as the name of 18 French monarchs. It was first used in the form of Clovis (the first king of the Franks in the 5th-century). Louis became well known as a king’s name with Louis I, the son of Charlemagne. Even today, British royals Prince William and Prince George’s middle names are Louis in honor of their uncle, Louis Mountbatten.\n\nA stand-out offshoot of Louis became Ludovic, associated with the Gaelic Maol Dòmhnaich, meaning “devotee of the Lord.” Lewis and Louis are the most common modern forms of the original French name Louis.\n\nHow Popular Is the Name Louis?\n\nLouis has consistently ranked in the top 500 names for U.S. boys, peaking at number 20 in 1914. Louis has recently proved super popular in France, ranking 5th for boys in 2019 and 8th in Switzerland. Louis similarly ranked 85th in England over the last five years.\n\nMany credit the 1957 hit “Louie, Louie” with the resurgence of Louis and Louie as a boy’s name. In the U.S., Louis ranked 1,000th in 2015 and most recently ranked 616th for boys.\n\nHow Do I Pronounce Louis?\n\nLouis is pronounced “Lew-EE” in French, “loo-EE” in Dutch, and “LEW-ihs” or “LOO-ee” in English.\n\nIs Louis a Boy or Girl Name?\n\nLouis is traditionally a boy’s name, while Louisa is the girl’s version. Louis very rarely appears as a girl’s name, although some may use it for their little girls.\n\nVariations of Louis\n\nJust a few letters can determine multiple stunning Louis variations in different cultures:\n\nLewes (English)\n\nLewis (English)\n\nLewys (Welsh)\n\nLluís (Catalan)\n\nLodewijk (Dutch)\n\nLodovico (Italian)\n\nLoizos (Greek)\n\nLoudovik (Armenian)\n\nLuay (Arabic)\n\nLuděk (Czech)\n\nLudovic (English)\n\nLudovico (Italian)\n\nLudwig (German)\n\nLudwik (Polish)\n\nLuigi (Italian)\n\nLuijs (Latvian)\n\nLuis (Spanish)\n\nLuiz (Portuguese)\n\nLùyi (Chinese)\n\nLyudovik (Russian)\n\nNicknames for Louis\n\nFind the best nickname for Louis when your famous warrior enters the world:\n\nLew\n\nLews\n\nLoo-Loo\n\nLou\n\nLouie\n\nLou Lou\n\nLu\n\nLucky Louie\n\nSimilar Names to Louis\n\nThese names are similar to Louis, especially when a regal feel is what you’re after:\n\nAlexander\n\nCalvin\n\nCharles\n\nElliot\n\nEllis\n\nElvis\n\nEverett\n\nFrancis\n\nFrederick\n\nGeorge\n\nHenry\n\nHugo\n\nJack\n\nJames\n\nKillian\n\nLance\n\nLeo\n\nLeopold\n\nMiles\n\nSamuel\n\nMiddle Names for Louis\n\nUse one of these adorable middle names for special baby boys called Louis:\n\nAngus\n\nBenedict\n\nCormac\n\nDonald\n\nDorian\n\nDuncan\n\nFinn\n\nFrasier\n\nGael\n\nJames\n\nJerome\n\nMagnus\n\nMatthew\n\nMurdoch\n\nOliver\n\nPhilippe\n\nRobert\n\nSebastian\n\nThomas\n\nVictor\n\nSibling Names for Louis\n\nEven a kingly boy named Louis needs a stylishly named brother or sister:\n\nAlfred\n\nBeau\n\nCalvin\n\nEsme\n\nFelix\n\nGemma\n\nGigi\n\nJasper\n\nLucien\n\nMatilda\n\nMaude\n\nNatalia\n\nNoel\n\nOtto\n\nSolange\n\nSophia\n\nSpencer\n\nSylvia\n\nVera\n\nYvonne\n\nFamous People Named Louis\n\nThere are almost too many famous people named Louis in history, so here are a few of the best:\n\nLouis II: Prince of Monaco from 1922 to 1949.\n\nLouis XVI: Last king of France before the French Revolution.\n\nLouis Alphonse Koyagialo: Deputy Prime Minister of the Congo.\n\nLouis Costello: American comedian and one-half of Abbott and Costello.\n\nLouis Daguerre: French photographer who invented daguerreotype photography.\n\nLouis Delétraz: Swiss racing driver in the European Le Mans Series.\n\nLouis (Lou) Diamond Phillips: American actor known for “La Bamba.”\n\nLouis Dobbs: American news host of “Lou Dobbs Tonight.”\n\nLouis Farrakhan: American civil rights leader and head of the Nation of Islam.\n\nLouis Gerard De Geer: The first prime minister of Sweden.\n\nLouis Gerstner: American businessman and CEO of IBM.\n\nLouis Jani: Canadian judoka who competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\nLouis Pasteur: French chemist known for vaccination.\n\nLouis Rubenstein: Canadian figure skater called the Father of Canadian Figure Skating.\n\nLouis Sachar: American young-adult writer known for the “Wayside School” series.\n\nLouis Saha: French footballer for the French national team.\n\nLouis Smith: English gymnast and bronze medalist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nLouis Theroux: English-American journalist who won a Royal Television Society Television Award.\n\nLouis Wain: English artist known for his drawings of cats and kittens.\n\nPrince Louis of Wales: Member of the British royal family and 4th in line to the throne.\n\nLouis in Popular Culture\n\nFind out how Louis has made an appearance in popular culture recently.\n\nDr. Louis Faraday: Character in the 1986 film “Flight of the Navigator.”\n\nLouis: Character in the 1980s sitcom “Kate & Allie.”\n\nLouis: Lead character in the Japanese manga series “Beastars.”\n\nLouis: Protagonist in a first-person shooter video game, Left 4 Dead.\n\nLouis de Pointe du Lac: Character appearing in Anne Rice’s “Vampire Chronicles.”\n\nLouis Gara: Character in 2013’s “Life of Crime” film.\n\nLouis Huang: Character appearing in the series “Fresh Off the Boat.”\n\nLouis Litt: Character in the American legal series “Suits.”\n\nLouis Michaelson: Character in the 1986 fantasy film “The Boy Who Could Fly.”\n\nLouis the Alligator: Animated character from the film “The Princess and the Frog.”\n\nLouis Tully: One of the main characters in “Ghostbusters” and “Ghostbusters II.”\n\nLouis Wu: Character appearing in Larry Niven’s “Ringworld” books.\n\nLouis FAQs\n\nHere’s some more interesting information regarding the boy’s name, Louis."
