        "text": "Quick Facts about Calla Lilies\n\nBotanical name: Zantedeschia aetheopica\n\nHeight: 12-24 in. (30-61 cm.)\n\nSpread: 18-24 in. (46-61 cm.)\n\nSun exposure: Full sun, part shade\n\nSoil requirements: Neutral, slightly acidic\n\nHardiness zones: USDA Zones 8-10\n\nWhen to plant: Spring\n\nCalla Lily Care\n\nCalla lily plants make a beautiful addition to the ornamental landscape. Though the graceful white calla lily flowers are the most common, available cultivars come in a wide range of colors. Below, we will explore the basic needs of this stunning perennial in greater detail.\n\nLight\n\nCalla lilies grow best where they can receive part, or full sun, throughout the day. Ample light is essential to the production of flowers. Still, gardeners living in areas that are especially warm or receive intense sunlight may want to consider planting them in beds that are shaded throughout the hottest parts of the afternoon.\n\nWater\n\nCaring for calla lilies includes paying special attention to soil moisture. Indoor plants, as well as those grown directly in the garden, appreciate consistent moisture throughout the season in addition to adequate humidity.\n\nIn most regions, supplemental watering callas in the garden is not required. However, the plants can benefit from drip irrigation or soaker hoses in regions that are especially dry or prone to prolonged periods of drought.\n\nTemperature & Humidity\n\nCalla lily plants grow best where conditions are warm with temperatures of at least 70 F (21 C) during the day. Humidity in the environment also plays a key role in maintaining adequate levels of moisture. Calla lily flowers can tolerate high temperatures in most gardens, provided the humidity conditions are ideal. Extreme heat can be detrimental to the plant, specifically, in regions that are dry or arid.\n\nSoil\n\nCalla lilies should be planted into well-amended beds with good drainage. Since they are quite adaptable, the rhizomes will grow well under a wide range of soil conditions, including those that consist of sand or clay. Their ideal garden soil should be neutral or slightly acidic with a pH of 5.6 to 6.5. To successfully grow callas indoors, the plants can be placed into containers filled with high-quality potting mix.\n\nFertilizer\n\nCalla lilies require annual feeding to keep them looking their best. Well-balanced fertilizers can be used any time before the plants start to flower. Both granulated and liquid feeds are good options, depending upon one's specific needs. As with most perennials, make certain to avoid using fertilizer after the plant has finished blooming\n\nProblems, Pests & Diseases\n\nWhile care for calla lilies is relatively simple, there are some common problems that gardeners need to be aware of. Notable among these are diseases that directly affect the plants' rhizomes and/or foliage. Rot, powdery mildew, and various kinds of wilt may be the direct result of excess moisture. Several types of pests may also target calla lily plants. Slugs and Japanese beetles being the most problematic.\n\nPruning\n\nCalla lily flowers can be removed as they begin to fade from the plant. Deadheading each stem prevents the production of seed, as well as encouraging bloom. Each spent flower stem should be removed carefully all the way back to the base of the plant. Dead or yellowing foliage can also be pruned in this manner, helping to maintain a healthy and tidy appearance within garden beds.\n\nPropagation\n\nThough it is possible to grow calla lily plants from seed, most gardeners prefer to divide those that have already established themselves in the garden. This can occur every 3-5 years, and will result in flowers that are identical to the parent plant. This process should be done in the fall while each plant is dormant. After carefully lifting rhizomes from the soil the roots can be cut apart. New divisions should have at least one healthy, viable growing eye.\n\nRepotting\n\nTo perform their best, calla lilies that have outgrown their containers will need to be repotted. This should occur in the fall, when the plants are dormant. Repot calla lilies every 1-2 years, allowing for division and replanting into new or larger containers.\n\nVarieties\n\nHere is a list of some common varieties of calla lily.\n\nCrystal Clear Calla Lily\n\nGarnet Glow Calla Lily\n\nOdessa Calla Lily\n\nMorning Sun Calla Lily\n\nPicasso Calla Lily\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
