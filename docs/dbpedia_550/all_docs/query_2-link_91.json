Published 17 July <strong>2013</strong>. ISSN 2153 733X <strong>THE</strong> <strong>NATIONAL</strong> <strong>WETLAND</strong> <strong>PLANT</strong> <strong>LIST</strong>: <strong>2013</strong> <strong>WETLAND</strong> RATINGS ROBERT W. LICHVAR U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory 72 Lyme Road Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-1290 ABSTRACT The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers the National Wetland Plant List (NWPL) for the United States (U.S.) and its territories. Responsibility for the NWPL was transferred to the Corps from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006. The list had not been updated since 1988, and the Corps led an interagency effort to revise the list by 2012. As part of the authorization of the revised NWPL in 2012, new methods were adopted for annual updates to the scientific names and wetland ratings. This paper presents the first annual update of the 2012 list. The 2012 list contained 7,828 species, and the <strong>2013</strong> update presented here contains 7,937 species. The increase of 109 species is due to nomenclature and taxonomic changes, species that were added by request, and new records from the literature and herbarium records. There was a change of 327 wetland ratings nationally during the <strong>2013</strong> update. Background Since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) assumed administrative responsibilities for the National Wetland Plant List (NWPL) in 2006, the list has gone through an extensive updating process that culminated in its authorization for national use in May 2012 (Federal Register 2012, Lichvar 2012). The development of the 2012 list was a cooperative effort between four federal government agencies: the Corps, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The effort was managed by a National Panel consisting of representatives from the four agencies. The 2012 NWPL is the standard reference for wetland indicator status ratings of vascular plants in the United States and is used for many purposes, including wetland delineation, assessment, mitigation, and habitat restoration. The NWPL is available to all users through a web application (http://wetland_plants.usace. army.mil/). The 2012 update built on the legacy of the FWS’s 1988 (Reed 1988) and draft 1996 wetland plant lists. It integrated all current taxonomic views along with revised wetland ratings (Lichvar and Minkin 2008). Additionally, the 2012 revision included several changes to the management of the NWPL, along with revised definitions of wetland categories, new Corps geographic wetland regions, protocols for challenging wetland ratings, and procedures for annual revisions. The five wetland rating categories in the NWPL were developed in the 1980s by Reed (1988). Each plant species was assigned a rating representing the estimated probability, or frequency, with which it is thought to occur in wetlands, as opposed to non-wetlands, across its entire range. The 1988 ratings were divided into categories based on quantitative ranges of frequency, but the 2012 ratings were based on simpler qualitative definitions (Lichvar et al. 2012) (Table 1). Indicator status ratings are now assigned to each species based on a thorough review of the botanical literature and herbarium records, along with the best professional judgment of national and regional experts. Longer quantitative rating definitions are still used, but only for field testing of wetland ratings."
