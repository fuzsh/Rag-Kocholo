        "text": "This study was conducted to assess the influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the flowering and quality of Zantedeschia albomaculata (Hook.) Baill ‘Albomaculata’ plants. Before planting, the rhizomes were soaked in water or an aqueous solution of GA3 at a concentration of 150 mg dm−3 for 30 min. A mixture of AMF was applied to the rhizomes a week after planting. The AMF treatment increased the yield of inflorescences of the ‘Albomaculata’ cultivar by 100%. AMF and GA3 had a favourable effect on the quality of inflorescences, expressed by the length of peduncles, whereas AMF individually positively affected the length of the spathes. AMF and GA3 had no effect on the level of macroelements in calla lily leaves, with the exception of calcium (Ca). The leaves of mycorrhized plants had a high content of sodium (Na) and micronutrients, except for iron (Fe). The results of the study showed that GA3 could be replaced by mycorrhizal inoculation when app...\n\nSince the 1990s, the world has seen an increased interest in Zantedeschia with colourful inflorescence spathes. In Poland, its cultivation began much later. The reasons for this phenomenon can be traced to the high price of rhizomes reproduced in the United States of America, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Kenya. The area of reproductive plantations is increasing every year, but this does not affect the decrease in the price of rhizomes, which is the main reason that only a few producers are cultivating Zantedeschia cultivars in Poland. Producers offer rhizomes in various sizes, with flowering expected only from the largest ones. However, the yield of cut flowers that can be obtained from them is often not very satisfactory and is not compensated by the price that can be obtained from the sale of the flowers. It is the low yield of cut flowers that is the main problem in the cultivation of Zantedeschia cultivars, hence research conducted worldwide focuses on the use of growth regu...\n\nThe study involved the application of a top dressing of a multicomponent Peters Professional fertiliser at concentration of 100 and 200 mg/l in the amount of 100 ml/plant, once every 7 days regardless of the fact whether the rhizomes had been mycorrhized before or not. Mycorrhization caused an increase in the quality of flowers, as expressed by peduncle length and their yield in Zantedeschia albomaculata cv. Albomaculata at both levels of top dressing, which shows that it is possible to reduce the top dressing dosage to a concentration of 100 mg/l. Mycorrhization had a favourable effect on the accumulation of nitrogen and manganese in the leaves of the calla lily. In mycorrhized plants the mean nitrogen content in 12 leaves ranged between 5.35 and 5.55% d.w. Mycorrhized plants accumulated more manganese in19 their leaves irrespective of the level of top dressing.\n\nFlowering and nutritional status in Gladiolus hybridus L. ‘Black Velvet’ were assessed following gibberellic acid treatment (GA3). Treatment were applied to corm (12–14 diameter) by soaking for 30 min in water solutions of GA3 at 100, 350 and 600 mg/dm3 with a control consisting of soaking-in water. All GA3 treatments inhibited elongation of inflorescence shoots and stimulated spike elongation. None of the tested concentrations affected the number of developing flowers in the spike, except for the 100 mg/dm3 in the 2nd year of the study. All GA3 treatments stimulated calcium uptake, but had no effect on the uptake of other macronutrients. All the GA3 treatments increased manganese content in leavesbud did not affect copper content. GA3 at 600 mg/dm3 stimulated uptake of iron and boron at 600 mg/dm3 but inhibited both at lower concentrations. Zinc uptake was stimulated at 100 mg/dm3 but inhibited at higher concentration.\n\nThe conditioning of flowers of the calla lily cultivar &#39;Albomaculata&#39; in BA at concentrations of 50-150 mg×dm-3 extends their postharvest longevity by 6.2-14.5 days. An extension of the longevity of the flowers by 15 days can be obtained after the application of a solution of 8HQS with saccharose on a continuous basis. Effective in improving the longevity of leaves of cultivar &#39;Sunglow&#39; is GA3 at a concentration of 400 mg×dm-3. What is more, its application at concentrations of 300-400 mg×dm-3 boosts their greenness index. GA3 at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg×dm-3 extends the postharvest longevity of leaves of the cultivar &#39;Black Eyed Beauty&#39; by 18 and 11 days, respectively, while BA shortens it. A combined application of BA and GA3 inhibits chlorophyll degradation, while GA3 and a mixture of BA and GA3 inhibit protein degradation.\n\nThe aim of the study was to assess the post-harvest life of the leaves of Hemerocallis × hybrida ‘Agata’, Limonium latifolium, and Heuchera hybrida ‘Chocolate Ruffles’ after the application of growth regulators from the group of gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinins (CKs), ionic liquids (2-hydroxyethyl)dimethylethylammonium gibberellinate [Chol][Gib] and acetylcholine gibberellinate [Gib][Ach]), as well as quaternary ammonium salts with the gibberellinate anion (1-ethyl quinine gibberellinate [Q-C2][Gib]) and 1-dodecyl acetylcholine gibberellinate [Q-C12][Gib]). The leaves were conditioned for 4 h in aqueous solutions of benzyladenine (BA), meta-methoxytopolin (MemT) and its riboside (MemTR), gibberellic acid (GA3), [Q-C2][Gib], [Gib][Ach], [Chol][Gib], and [Q-C12][Gib] at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg·dm−3. Conditioning of Hemerocallis × hybrida ‘Agata’ with MemT and [Chol][Gib] at both concentrations, [Q-C2][Gib] (100 mg·dm−3) and [Gib][Ach] (50 mg·dm−3), extended the vase life of t...\n\nThe effect of mycorrhization on development and flowering of Tagetes patula L. ‘Yellow Boy’ and Salvia splendens Buc’hoz ex Etl. ‘Saluti Red’ was assessed. Control treatments were those in which plants were grown in peat substrate, as opposed to the treatments in which the substrate was supplemented with mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhiza-treated plants of T. patula ‘Yellow Boy’ produced more inflorescence buds. In S. splendens ‘Saluti Red’, thanks to symbiosis with fungi, more flowers per inflorescence developed. Mycorrhization had no effect on plant height in T. patula ‘Yellow Boy’ and S. splendens ‘Saluti Red’. However, after its application plants tillered more intensively forming more primary lateral shoots. Mycorrhiza-treated cultivars of both species had a higher index of greenness.\n\nThe flowers have been considered as the symbol of grace and elegance and a feast for our eyes. With changing lifestyles and increased urban affluence, floriculture has assumed a definite commercial status in recent times. Appreciation of the potential of commercial floriculture has resulted in the blossoming of this field into a viable agri-business option. Availability of natural resources like diverse agro-climatic conditions permits the production of a wide range of temperate and tropical flowers, almost all through the year in some part of the country or other. Among the different management practices in flower crops, plant growth regulators have a great bearing in influencing the growth and flowering attributes. Now a days these growth regulators can be easily available in the market. They play an important role in dormancy breaking, production of quality cut flowers and corms or bulbs. In bulbous flower crops benzyl adenine and kinetin helps in stimulating cell division, they ..."
