        "text": "Geophytes are a very important group among ornamental plants, for which more and more plant growth regulators (PGRs) are being used to improve the plant quality, flowering intensity, and vase life of flowers and leaves. PGRs constitute a large group of naturally occurring or synthetically produced organic chemical compounds. There are many factors that influence the efficiency of PGRs, and the method of their application plays a key role in determining their success. In the case of geophytes, the most common method of application is spraying and soaking the storage organs before planting."
