        "text": "Tropical members of the arum family are among the most diverse and finest of all house plants – easy to grow, shade tolerant and boasting exotic, even unearthly, good looks\n\nIn the wild, most aroids (arum family members) live in tropical forests. To see them you'd have to search dimly-lit forest floors or look up to see vines climbing trees or epiphytes in the canopy. These three niches are home to the majority of the 3,700 plus species making up the splendidly exotic, notably diverse Araceae family.\n\nSome aroids are hardy enough to survive in temperate climes; Arum italicum, Arisaema and British native lords-and-ladies (Arum maculatum) to name a few. When you look at their flowers, their relation to tropical species becomes obvious. Botanically, these are inflorescences, made up of many tiny individual flowers, and their distinctive structure defines aroids (see box, below).\n\nMany tropical aroids make handsome and amenable long-term houseplants; they can be divided into those grown mainly for their blooms, and those grown for foliage.\n\nAlocasias, devil's ivy and peace lilies make a colourful and long-lasting display\n\nFlowering aroids\n\nIf you have a peace lily (Spathiphyllum), calla lily (Zantedeschia) or flamingo flower (Anthurium), you already grow a tropical aroid. All show characteristic spadix and spathe inflorescences and are stylish additions to the home. Peace lily blooms are white, but breeding work in the other genera is producing spathes in an ever-widening colour range.\n\nFlamboyant flamingoes\n\n© RHS\n\nAnthuriums have bright, long-lasting blooms\n\n© thejoyofplants\n\nDarker-flowered varieties can make a dramatic statement\n\nFlamingo flowers (Anthurium) – have spathes in white, red, pink, green, chocolate-brown and purple, all easy to grow in bright but indirect light. Spathe shape varies from round to teardrop-shaped, with a crinkled texture in some cultivars. Foliage is usually glossy and arrowhead-shaped. Most are complex hybrids from Central American Anthurium andraeanum, hence Andraeanum Group. Typically plants reach 60cm in height and width, but there are more compact ones half this size, such as purple-flowered Zizou (‘Anthevex’). Anthurium crystallinum is an epiphytic species grown more for its lovely leaves – heart shaped and dark green with paler veining – than its greenish flowers. It can climb to 50cm. Anthuriums do best at 16–22°C.\n\nTough peace lilies\n\n© thejoyofplants\n\nPeace lilies come in a range of sizes\n\nPeace lilies (Spathiphyllum) are among the easiest of all house plants. They send up long-lasting, pure white spathes cupping spiky little cream spadices, above glossy, elongated leaves. Most widely grown is S. wallisii; its\n\nGardeners often use the word variety when referring to a specific plant, but the correct botanical term is 'cultivar'. Whichever word you use, it means a distinctive plant or plants, given a specific cultivar name and usually bred to enhance certain characteristics, such as flower or fruit size, colour, flavour or fragrance, plant size, hardiness, disease resistance, etc. Additionally, it is worth knowing that, botanically, variety has another meaning - it refers to a naturally-occurring distinct plant that only has slight differences in its looks. For example, Malva alcea var. fastigiata differs from typical plants by having an upright habit.\n\ncultivar ‘Bellini’ is compact, to 45cm. By contrast, spectacular Spathiphyllum ‘Mauna Loa Supreme’ is a giant of a plant, with broad, glossy leaves forming a clump at least 1m across. All are similarly easy to care for: 18–24°C is ideal.\n\nColourful callas\n\n'Red Alert'\n\n'Captain Promise'\n\nCalla lilies (Zantedeschia) hybrids: relatives of white-flowered arum lily (Z. aethiopica), compact and colourful calla lilies have Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmannii in their ancestry. Breeding work has produced an explosion of new hybrids in yellow, pink, red, purple, orange and near black, plus pastel bicolours, some delicately vertically striped. Some show marked colour changes as spathes age, and flecked foliage. Callas can also do well outdoors used as\n\nBedding plants are usually colourful half-hardy, short-lived or annual plants, grown for displays in beds or containers. They may be changed seasonally, with spring, summer and winter bedding displays each using different plants of appropriate hardiness and flowering times.\n\nbedding plants in summer. A good rich yellow-flowered selection is ‘Summer Sun’ while ‘Picasso’ has cream and purple spathes (plants reach 60cm). Store dry\n\nTubers are swollen, usually underground, parts of a stem or root used to store food by the plant. They have buds that can produce new plants. Examples are tuberous begonia, cyclamen, dahlia and potato.\n\ntubers\n\nFrost-free environments, such as a cool greenhouse or conservatory, have a nighttime minimum of 4°C (39°F). This is ideal for plants tolerant of low temperatures, but will not survive being frozen, such as tender plants being overwintered including pelargoniums; frost-tender rooted cuttings such as penstemon; and bedding plants in spring.\n\nfrost free over winter, or keep in growth indoors above 10°C.\n\nWhat makes an aroid?\n\nThe definitive feature of the Araceae family is their compound flowers, or inflorescences; each bloom is made up of many tiny flowers.\n\nAroid inflorescences are formed of a fleshy central column (a spadix) of many tightly packed flowers.\n\nA spadix is usually surrounded by a brightly-coloured spathe (a highly modified leaf). Not all aroid species have spathes, but all have spadices.\n\nA family portrait\n\n1) Spathicarpa hastifolia 2) Zantedeschia 'Summer Sun' 3) Monstera 'Monkey Mask 4) Alocasia x amazonica 'Polly' 5) Zamioculcas zamiifolia 'Raven' 6) Dieffenbachia 'Reflector' 7) Syngonium podophyllum 'Neon Robusta' 8) Anthurium (Andreanum Group) 9) Anthurium crystallinum 10) Alocasia lauterbachiana 11) Spathiphyllum wallisii 'Bellini' 12) Epipremnum aureum 'Neon' 13) Anthurium 'Zizou' 14) Aglaonema 'King of Siam'\n\nFoliage aroids\n\nMany aroids are grown primarily for their foliage and will grow well in dimly-lit corners few other house plants can tolerate. They can cope with irregular watering and put up with dry indoor air, making them among the most useful and lowest-maintenance of all indoor plants.\n\nElephant's ears – striking veins\n\nTruly tropical, these plants enjoy maximum warmth and humidity\n\nAlocasias, some of which are large-leaved plants known as elephant’s ears, prefer warm, humid conditions, regular misting and good but indirect light. Alocasia × amazonica ‘Polly’ has striking pale veining on dark green, spearhead-shaped leaves to 30cm long; minimum 16°C. Alocasia lauterbachiana is a handsome plant with narrow, upright, wavy-edged leaves, undersides and stems a contrasting red. Grows to 1.5m; ideal temperatures are 20–25°C; keep above 15°C.\n\nDumb cane – pretty patterns\n\nDumb cane has delightfully patterned leaves\n\nDieffenbachia: dumb\n\nA cane is a slender, straight, length of woody plant material, usually bamboo. Canes are primarily used as plant supports. The fruiting stems of blackberries, raspberries and hybrid berries (such as loganberries and tayberries) are also known as canes, so these crops are often referred to as cane fruit.\n\ncane or leopard lily has long been a popular houseplant. Typically, cultivars have fresh green leaves striped and splashed with cream or white; D. ‘Reflector’ is more spotted than striped, in pale green on a darker green leaf than most. Min 15°C; prefers between 18 and 25°C.\n\nA great beginner plant: devil's ivy\n\nEasy-going and bright, devil's ivy earns its keep\n\nEpipremnum (devil’s ivy) is a climbing vine that will trail attractively, or grow up a moss pole. Also known as Ceylon creeper, it is extremely tough and shade tolerant. It is an excellent plant for beginners or for brightening dark corners. Epipremnum aureum has irregular yellow\n\nVariegated means having leaves or other plant parts with streaks, blotches or patches of different colours. Typically, these would be a combination of two colours, such as green and gold or green and white.\n\nvariegation on green, heart-shaped leaves, but those of Epipremnum aureum ‘Neon’ emerge solid bright gold, ageing to unvariegated pale green. To 1.8m in pots; keep above 15°C.\n\nBold and beautiful monsteras\n\nSwiss cheese plants have distinctively shaped leaves\n\nMonstera contains the undisputed heavyweight champion of the indoor garden: M. deliciosa (Swiss cheese plant). Large, well-grown specimens can single-handedly transport a room to the tropics. The biggest, most perforated leaves will be on mature plants grown in good light and high humidity. A far more compact relation, usually sold as ‘Monkey Mask’ also has holes in the leaves, but these do not reach the leaf margins as in M. deliciosa. The look is lacy, unusual and attractive. ‘Monkey Mask’ likes high\n\nThe amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Different plants require different levels of humidity. Houseplants that need high humidity are best grown in a steamy bathroom, misted regularly or the pot placed in a saucer of damp pebbles. In a greenhouse, humidity can be raised in hot weather by damping down (wetting) the floor, overhead watering or misting. However, high humidity can cause fungal problems, in which case open vents to improve ventilation.\n\nhumidity and bright light; ideally 15–18°C during the day and 12°C at night. Can climb to 1m given support, or let it trail.\n\nGrow something different – philodendron\n\n© Hans Braxmeier (Pixabay)\n\nLess commonly seen than Swiss cheese plants, philodendrons are equally dramatic\n\nPhilodendron is a large genus of plants in a wide range of sizes and bold leaf shapes. Some thrive in even the darkest corners. Philodendron bipinnatifidum (tree philodendron; syn. P. selloum) rivals Swiss cheese plants for scale indoors – its huge leaves grow to 1m across. Tree philodendron copes with shade; in a pot it makes around 1.5m. An attractive\n\nVariegated means having leaves or other plant parts with streaks, blotches or patches of different colours. Typically, these would be a combination of two colours, such as green and gold or green and white.\n\nvariegated selection of sweetheart vine that can climb to 4m indoors given support (or let it trail) is P. hederaceum ‘Brasil’, with large, dark green leaves showing variable splashes of yellow. Most philodendrons do well at around 15–20°C.\n\nSculptural in the shade – the ZZ plant\n\n© thejoyofplants\n\nCome sun or shade, Zamioculcas adds a unique touch to houseplant displays\n\nThe ZZ plant or Zamioculcas zamiifolia is a species that marries architectural, glossy green looks with drought tolerance. The upright, pinnate leaves grow to 45–60cm and it even tolerates deep shade. It is best at 18–26°C; minimum 15°C. Zamioculcas zamiifolia Raven (‘Dowon’) is aptly named for its dark purple to near-black, gothic foliage. Every plant was micropropagated from a single leaf mutation on a plant on a South Korean nursery in 2006, but not introduced until 2017. New leaves emerge green, turning dark over six to eight weeks, even when grown in shade.\n\nAroids include some of the most dramatic plants we grow indoors. Some are true jungle giants and need space, but even a shaded windowsill can offer some smaller ones a home.\n\nThis article first appeared in the January 2020 issue of The Garden magazine – an exclusive monthly publication for members of the RHS."
