        "text": "Yellow flowers symbolize cheerfulness, hope, and energy. Also, yellow is probably one of the favorite colors of an avid gardener. I like calling the yellow flowers the sunshine of a backyard. Now that may sound a little cheesy, but yellow flowers stand out as happy and vibrant when mixed with other flowers. Furthermore, yellow flowers come in many shades, from pale lemon to deep gold. It means there is something for everyone here.\n\nWant to add some color and life to your garden? These yellow perennials will do the trick.\n\nPlanting yellow flowering perennials is a fantastic way to brighten your property and bring pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds to your garden. What makes yellow perennials even better is the fact that you do not need to plant them year after year. Once established, yellow perennials will return yearly and fill your little piece of earth with dazzling, ever-improving, pretty yellow flowers.\n\nSo, which yellow perennials should you plant? Let’s figure it out!\n\nRELATED: Common Lawn Weeds With Yellow Flowers (And How To Get Rid Of Them?)\n\nConsider This Before Picking A Yellow Perennial\n\nConsider your region, plant size, and bloom times when picking a yellow perennial for your garden.\n\nWhen planning your garden and choosing which yellow perennials to grow, you must thoroughly survey your property. For instance, many gardeners, even some of the expert ones, find working with yellow flowers challenging. So, if you are new to this, you may find it hard to fit the yellow perennials properly in place with other plants.\n\nMaking Yellow Flowers Work!\n\nThere are two shades of yellow flowers in the gardening world, i.e., cool and warm. Warm yellow flowers are either deep gold or tinted with shades of red. In contrast, cool yellow flowers are either slightly green in color or purely bright yellow.\n\nThere are four ways you could make yellow perennials work in your garden:\n\nUse yellow perennials as focal points to bring dark areas to life\n\nPair them with opposite-colored flowers, such as purple, to make them both pop\n\nPlant yellow-colored ribbons throughout your garden using only one shade\n\nOr sprinkle yellow flowers here and there in your garden in pots or beds\n\nConsider The Blooming Season\n\nNot all plants bloom simultaneously, and the same goes for yellow perennials.\n\nSo, when choosing a yellow flowering plant for your garden, please consider its blooming time. Ideally, you want to pick something that blooms all spring and summer.\n\nIt will keep your property looking its loveliest throughout most of the year.\n\nWatch The Sun\n\nIf you want to ensure that you give your chosen yellow flowering perennials the best chance of success, you should pay close attention to how the sun moves over your garden.\n\nAll plants need sunlight to survive and make their food. However, some might need more sunlight than others. So, to ensure that your yellow perennials bloom to their maximum, you must ensure they receive sufficient sunlight.\n\nPopular Yellow Perennial Flowers\n\nNow that you know what to look for when choosing yellow flowers in your garden and how to plant them on your property, let’s go ahead and look at some of the most beautiful and common yellow flowering perennials.
