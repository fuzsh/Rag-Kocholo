They are bulbous perennials, some evergreen, associated with rocky and arid habitats. They bear spherical umbels of lily-like flowers in shades from white through pink to crimson. In the case of deciduous species, the flowers may appear on naked stems before the leaves develop. Native to South Africa, there are about 30 species in the genus. Though described as lilies, they are not significantly related to the true lilies Lilium, but more closely resemble their relatives, Amaryllis and Lycoris. The genus was established by the cleric and Amaryllidaceae specialist William Herbert in 1820. Nerines have been widely cultivated and much hybridized worldwide, especially Nerine bowdenii, N. sarniensis and N. undulata (previously known as N. flexuosa). The hybrid cultivar 'Zeal Giant' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The other 20 species are rarely cultivated and very little is known regarding their biology. Many species are threatened with extinction due to the loss or degradation of their habitat. Species of Nerine are herbaceous flowering plants that grow from bulbs. Their leaves are linear, obviously flat in some species and appearing threadlike in others. Their flowers are borne in an umbel on a solid leafless stem (scape). Individual flowers are either radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) or have one plane of symmetry (zygomorphic). Each flower has six narrow red or pink tepals joined at the base to form a short extended or recurved tube. The free parts of the tepals are generally wavy. There are six stamens that are inserted in the base of the petals and frequently protrude from the flower. The stamens can be straight or curved with thin filaments and oblong anthers that attach to their filament at the back (dorsifixed). The inferior ovary has one to many ovules. The style is threadlike and has a three-lobed stigma. The fruit is a capsule. Many species of Nerine have petals with wavy edges, such as Nerine humilis. Profusion of flowers in Nerine filifolia, note the filiform leaves of this species.\n\nNerine species can be either evergreen or deciduous; the deciduous species can either grow during the winter or the summer. The growth cycle thus defines three groups. There is a strong association between a species' growth habit, the shape of its leaves and the amount of DNA in its cell nuclei. The largest group of 12 species contains the evergreen nerines that retain their leaves throughout the summer and winter (N. angustifolia, N. appendiculata, N. filamentosa, N. filifolia, N. frithii, N. gaberonensis, N. gibsonii, N. gracilis, N. masoniorum, N. pancratioides, N. platypetala and N. rehmannii). Their leaves are narrow and they have the smallest amount of DNA per nucleus (18.0â24.6 pg). Four deciduous species grow in the winter and do not have any leaves during the summer (N. humilis, N. pudica, N. ridleyi and N. sarniensis). They have wide leaves and more DNA per nucleus (25.3â26.2 pg). A final group of seven species only grow during the summer and have no leaves in the winter (N. bowdenii, N. duparquetiana, N. krigei, N. laticoma, N. marincowitzii, N. pusilla and N. undulata). They have wide leaves and the most DNA per nucleus (26.8â35.3 pg). The earliest published name for the genus was Imhofia, given by Lorenz Heister in 1755. The later name Nerine, published by William Herbert in 1820, was widely used, resulting in a decision to conserve the name Nerine and reject the name Imhofia. The genus name derives from the Nereids (sea-nymphs) of Greek mythology that protected sailors and their ships. When Herbert chose the name of these nymphs for the first species of the genus, Nerine sarniensis, he alluded to the story of how this South African species arrived on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel.

The boxes of bulbs were washed up on the island and the bulbs became established and multiplied around the coast.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nTo view more in this series, please click \"here\" !\n\nNerine is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae.

(How's that for alliteration?) According to Wikipedia, \"The Zantedeschia species are very poisonous, capable of killing livestock and children.\" Gee. And they look so innocent.\n\nThese lilies remind me of one of the more interesting searches that I've been on. This was back in 2002, when I was working my first SAR dog, Hopi, and my current one, Cielo (both Vizslas). The assignment was to see if the dogs could find additional grave sites at a remote, private burial grounds, which was thought to belong to a historically prominent family. None of the three dogs that were working alerted on anything until we were just leaving, when Cielo ran over to me and sat and barked, which is his alert for finding cadaver. I hadn't seen him show any particular interest in anything, but I decided to give him the \"show me\" command, which means that he is supposed to run back to the location where he made the find, while I run behind him. Darned if he didn't take me to one of the graves marked with a head stone. The year on it was 1921, so Cielo had alerted on an 81-year old grave. Amazing! Being the skeptic that I am, I tried to figure out how he could do that and noticed that he kept sniffing near an out of season (appeared to be dead) and out of place plant, with leaves just like the ones above, growing near the headstone. I thought the plant was probably started by some lilies that were placed on the grave, all those years ago. It's possible that the plant aided in some of the scent escaping through the hardened ground. Of course, it's also possible that I'm nuts, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nView On Black\n\nHike around the Coteau Maigre.\n\nWanderung um den Coteau Maigre.\n\nCalla (Zantedeschia aethiopica) blossom\n\nCalla (Zantedeschia aethiopica) Blüte\n\nZantedeschia /ˌzæntɪˈdɛskiə/ is a genus of eight species of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants in the aroid family, Araceae, native to southern Africa (from South Africa northeast to Malawi). The genus has been introduced, in some form, on every continent (minus Antarctica).\n\nCommon names include arum lily for Z. aethiopica, calla and calla lily for Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmannii. However, members of this genus are not true lilies (which belong to the family Liliaceae), and the genera Arum and Calla, although related, are distinct from Zantedeschia, despite visual similarities. The colourful flowers and leaves, of both species and cultivars, are greatly valued and commonly grown as ornamental and garden plants.\n\nDescription\n\nZantedeschia species are rhizomatous, herbaceous, perennial plants with some species, e. g., Zantedeschia aethiopica, growing to 1.2m tall, while Zantedeschia rehmannii does not exceed 60 cm in height, growing in clumps or clusters.\n\nRoots: Contractile, emerging from the top of the tubers in Group II.\n\nStem: The underground portion is variously described as a thick underground stem, i. e., a rhizome or tuber. While the literature is confusing as to the exact terminology, generally the Zantedeschia aethiopica-Zantedeschia odorata group (Group I) is considered to have rhizomes and the remaining species tubers. The rhizomes are fleshy and branched.\n\nLeaves: Petioles are long, spongy, sheathed at the bases, and of varying lengths, from 15 cm (Zantedeschia rehmannii) to 1.5 m (Zantedeschia aethiopica). The lamina is simple, elongated, and coriaceous with a variety of shapes, including triangular, oval (ovate), with or without a point (elliptic), heart-shaped (cordate), spear-shaped (hastate), lance-shaped (lanceolate), oblong, or circular (orbicular). 15–60 cm in length, 5–25 cm in width. The leaves are dark green in colour, feather-veined (pinnate), and may be erect or spreading with undulate margins. Some species exhibit transparent flecking (maculation), and are therefore described as maculate, while others are immaculate. (see Table I, also New Zealand Calla Council Leaf Shape Images The leaves contain hydathodes that result in guttation.\n\nInflorescence: Takes the form of a solitary pseudanthium (false flower), with a showy white or yellow spathe (a specialised petal like bract) shaped like a funnel with a yellow, central, finger-like spadix, which carries the true flowers. Both spathe and spadix are carried on or above the leaves on the fleshy flower stem. The shape of the spathe whose overlapping margins form the tubes varies from trumpet shaped (Z. pentlandii) to a tight tube with a tapering tip (Z. rehmannii). The spathe is initially green, but as it unfolds becomes coloured. This may be white as in Z. aethiopica, but other species include yellow and pink. Cultivars have a wide variety of other spathe colours including orange and purple. Inside the spathe, the throat may be darkly coloured. The spathe acts to attract pollinators.\n\nFlowers: Zantedeschia is monoecious, in which separate male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (\"imperfect\" or \"unisexual\" flowers) are carried on the spadix. The flowers are small and non-blooming without a perianth. The male flowers contain two to three stamens fused to form a synandrium, and the female flowers have a single, compound pistil with three fused carpels and three locules.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nZantedeschia is the sole genus in the tribe Zantedeschieae in a 1997 classification of the Araceae.\n\nSpecies\n\nEight species are currently recognized:\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng. – giant white arum lily or common arum lily - South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho\n\nZantedeschia albomaculata (Hook.) Baill. – spotted arum lily - widespread from South Africa north to Nigeria and Tanzania\n\nZantedeschia elliottiana (W.Watson) Engl. – yellow or golden arum lily - Mpumalanga Province of South Africa\n\nZantedeschia jucunda Letty - Leolo Mountains of northern South Africa\n\nZantedeschia odorata P.L.Perry - Western Cape Province\n\nZantedeschia pentlandii (R.Whyte ex W.Watson) Wittm. - Mpumalanga Province of South Africa\n\nZantedeschia rehmannii Engl. – pink arum lily - South Africa, Eswatini, Mozambique\n\nZantedeschia valida (Letty) Y.Singh - KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name of the genus was given as a tribute to Italian botanist Giovanni Zantedeschi (1773–1846) by the German botanist Kurt Sprengel (1766–1833).\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nAll species are endemic to central and southern Africa, from Nigeria to Tanzania and South Africa. Z. aethiopica grows naturally in marshy areas and is only deciduous when water becomes scarce. It grows continuously when watered and fed regularly and can survive periods of minor frosts. Z. aethiopica is a very strong and sturdy plant, being able to grow in many soils and habitats, multiplying by rhizome-offsets; it is naturalised and regarded as a weed throughout much of the world. Z. odorata is a rare species, resembling Z. aethiopica, but deciduous and smelling like freesia, endemic to a few localities in South Africa. Z. albomaculata is a widespread and variable species, growing from South Africa north to Kenya, varying in shades of white to cream and pink to orange-shades. Z. jucunda and Z. pentlandii are rare species with large yellow showy flowers. Z. rehmannii is a pink-flowered species with sword shaped leaves. Z. elliotiana is known from horticultural sources only and is probably of hybrid origin.\n\nIntroduction\n\nZantedeschia was introduced to Europe in the seventeenth century as Z. aethiopica, and is now widely naturalised in Europe, North America, Central America, South America, Oceania, and Australasia. In many places it is considered a dangerous invasive species that displaces native vegetation. In the South-West of Western Australia, Z. aethiopica was introduced for horticulture, but has become a widespread and conspicuous weed of watercourses, heath, and wet pastures to the extent that it has been declared a pest in Western Australia and landowners must control it and attempts to sell plants must be reported. Zantedeschia in North America is primarily grown as ornamental cultivars in home gardens.\n\nHabitat\n\nZ. aethiopica grows naturally in marshy areas and is only deciduous when water becomes scarce. It grows continuously when watered and fed regularly and can survive periods of minor frosts. Z. aethiopica is a very strong and sturdy plant, being able to grow in many soils and habitats, multiplying by rhizome-offsets.\n\nCultivation\n\nAll Zantedeschia produce large, showy flowers spathes and are often grown both as ornamental plants and for cut flowers. Zantedeschia are relatively hardy plants, but some are more winter-hardy than others. In this regard there may be considered two groups, a hardy outdoor group with large white flowers (arum lilies) and less hardy group with white-spotted leaves and flowers in many colours (calla lilies), such as yellow, orange, pink and purple.\n\nHardy forms (arum lilies)\n\nThese include Zantedeschia aethiopica and Zantedeschia pentlandii and their cultivars. Zantedeschia aethiopica and some of its relatives can survive at minimum winter temperatures below -23 °C (USDA Zone 6) and many others can be grown in even warmer areas where all the ground does not freeze (USDA Zone 7). Z. pentlandii hybrids include 'Millennium Gold'.\n\nTender forms (calla lilies)\n\nThe more tender specimens are mainly cultivars (hybrids) of Zantedeschia elliotiana and Zantedeschia rehmannii (referred to as elliotiana or rehmannii cultivars or hybrids, or as e.g. Z. × rehmanii), but also Zantedeschia albomaculata and Zantedeschia jucunda. These less hardy forms can only survive winter temperatures to −12 °C (Zones 8). This plant must be grown as tender bulbs or houseplants in cooler areas. Species and hybrids between Z. elliotiana, Z. jucunda, Z. pentlandii and Z. rehmannii appear to have an optimum temperature for growth near 25 °C, with growth being suppressed once daily average temperatures persist at 28 °C.\n\nSeasonal grouping\n\nOther classifications consider two groups based on their seasonal habits. Zantedeschia aethiopica and Zantedeschia odorata form one group (Group I) typified by retaining their leaves in winter, and flowering from late winter to late spring, while the remaining species (Group II) are in leaf from spring to late autumn shedding their leaves in winter (deciduous) and flower during the summer. Zantedeschia aethiopica may retain its leaves all year round (evergreen), otherwise from autumn to late summer, while Zantedeschia odorata retains its leaves from late winter to late spring. The two groups also vary according to the arrangement of the male and female organs. In the first group they are arranged together in the lower part of the spadix, whereas in the latter they are separate, with the female at the base. The Z. aethiopica group also have a fruit that turns soft and orange, whereas the other retains a firm green fruit.\n\nToxicity\n\nZantedeschia shares the general properties of the family Araceae in causing contact irritation. Zantedeschia species are also poisonous due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the form of raphides. All parts of the plant are poisonous, typically producing local irritation or a burning sensation in the mouth and occasionally vomiting and diarrhea. However leaves are sometimes cooked and eaten.\n\nUses\n\nExtensive commercial production of Zantedeschia for cut flowers and/or planting material occurs in California, Colombia, New Zealand and Kenya. Plant breeders in California and New Zealand continue to produce an extensive range of new hybrid cultivars. The so-called white calla derived from Z. aethiopica. All varieties with flowers with shades of yellow, orange, red, purple are mainly derived from Z. albomaculata, Z. pentlandii, Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmanni.\n\nCulture\n\nZantedeschia has often been used in paintings and is featured in many of Diego Rivera's works of art (see The Flower Vendor, amongst others). It was a favourite subject of the painter Georgia O'Keeffe.\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nDie Zantedeschien (Zantedeschia) sind die einzige Pflanzengattung der Tribus Zantedeschieae in der Familie der Aronstabgewächse (Araceae).\n\nBei vier der acht Zantedeschia-Arten verwendet man Calla, Kalla oder selten Calla-Lilien als Trivialnamen, sie sollten jedoch nicht mit Lilien oder Pflanzenarten der Gattung Calla verwechselt werden. Manche Arten und Sorten sind seltene Zimmerpflanzen. Der Name Calla leitet sich vom altgriechischen Wort καλός kalós ab und bedeutet „schön“. Namensverwandte aus der griechischen Mythologie sind die Nymphe Kallisto („die Schönste“) und die Muse der Dichtung und Wissenschaft Kalliope („die Schönstimmige“).\n\nBeschreibung\n\nZantedeschien sind ausdauernde krautige Pflanzen, die Wuchshöhen bis 2,5 Meter erreichen. Sie bilden ein kriechendes Rhizom oder Knollen als Überdauerungsorgan aus. Manche Arten sind immergrün, andere ziehen zu ungünstigen Jahreszeiten ihr Laub ein. Die grundständigen Laubblätter sind – im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Gattungen der Einkeimblättrigen Pflanzen – gestielt; die Blattspreiten sind glänzend grün und oft pfeilförmig.\n\nAuf einem unbeblätterten Blütenstandschaft ist der Blütenstand wie bei allen Aronstabgewächsen ausgebildet: Ein einzelnes, oft auffällig gefärbtes Hochblatt, die Spatha, umgibt den Kolben. Die große und deutlich zugespitzte Spatha[2] kann weiß oder gelb sein, selten auch rot, bei Züchtungen gibt es eine große Bandbreite an unterschiedlichen Farben. Zantedeschien sind einhäusig getrenntgeschlechtig (monözisch). Im Kolben (Spadix) stehen viele Blüten zusammen. Im unteren Bereich des Kolbens befindet sich eine Zone nur mit weiblichen Blüten; im längeren oberen Bereich befinden sich nur männliche Blüten. Die kleinen Blüten sind reduziert und besitzen keine Blütenhüllblätter. Männliche Blüten enthalten zwei bis drei Staubblätter. Bei den weiblichen Blüten sind drei Fruchtblätter zu einem synkarpen Fruchtknoten verwachsen.\n\nSie bilden grüne oder orange Beeren. Die Samen sind kugelig bis eiförmig.\n\nAlle Teile von Zantedeschia aethiopica sind leicht giftig und verursachen starke Schleimhautreizungen. Die Flüssigkeit, die die Zantedeschien über die Blattspitzen absondern, ist ebenfalls giftig und verursacht bei Berührung Hautausschlag und Nesselfieber.\n\nVerbreitung\n\nAlle Arten sind in Afrika heimisch. Am häufigsten sind sie in den Provinzen Südafrikas in der Capensis (Kapprovinz, KwaZulu-Natal und Freistaat) sowie in den Ländern Eswatini und Lesotho. Es gibt die Gattung aber auch weiter nördlich in Angola, Kenia, Malawi, Sambia, Simbabwe und Nigeria. Das natürliche Habitat der sommerblühenden Formen ist ein warmtemperates Klima mit Niederschlägen, die hauptsächlich im Winter fallen. Die anderen Arten, wie beispielsweise Zantedeschia aethiopica und Zantedeschia odorata wachsen in Gebieten mit Sommerregen und blühen im Winter. Oft gedeihen die Pflanzen in sumpfigen Gebieten.\n\nDie Zantedeschienarten benötigen als ursprüngliche Sumpfpflanzen viel Wasser. Gerade in der Wachstumsphase sollte eine Austrocknung der Wurzeln vermieden werden. Nach der Blüte hat die Zantedeschie eine Ruhephase in der die Pflanze keinen Wasserbedarf hat. Bei Zimmercallas handelt es sich meist um die Zantedeschia aethiopica, die von Januar bis April blüht. Auch sie hat ihre Ruhephase im Anschluss an die Blütephase. Zantedeschien brauchen zum optimalen Wachstum leicht sandigen und vor allem äußerst nährstoffreichen Boden.\n\nSystematik\n\nDie Gattung Zantedeschia wurde 1826 durch Kurt Sprengel in Systema Vegetabilium, editio decima sexta, 3, S. 756, 765[4] aufgestellt. Der botanische Gattungsname Zantedeschia ehrt den italienischen Arzt und Botaniker Giovanni Zantedeschi (1773–1846). Typusart ist Zantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng., die von Carl von Linné als Calla aethiopica erstveröffentlicht wurde. Syn. für Zantedeschia Spreng. sind Pseudohomalomena A.D.Hawkes, Richardia Kunth. Zantedeschia ist die einzige Gattung der Tribus Zantedeschieae in der Unterfamilie Aroideae in der Familie der Araceae. Die Tribus Zantedeschieae wurde durch Adolf Engler aufgestellt.\n\nEs gibt acht Zantedeschia-Arten:\n\nGewöhnliche Calla oder Zimmercalla (Zantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng., Syn.: Calla aethiopica L.): Sie kommt ursprünglich im südlichen Afrika vor.\n\nGefleckte Calla (Zantedeschia albomaculata (Hook.) Baill.): Sie kommt von Tansania, Demokratischen Republik Kongo, Angola, Malawi, Sambia, Simbabwe bis Südafrika vor.\n\nMit zwei Unterarten:\n\nZantedeschia albomaculata (Hook.)

Die Blätter von Zantedeschia aethiopica werden gegart gegessen (alle Pflanzenteile sind roh giftig).\n\nIn der Trauerfloristik wird sie als Zeichen der Unsterblichkeit genutzt. In weiß galt sie lange als „Totenblume“. In Gestecken stehen die verschiedenen Sorten heute für Moderne und Eleganz und werden als Symbol für Schönheit und Anerkennung verschenkt. Durch ihre besondere Blütenform, die an einen Kelch erinnert, wurde sie von den Griechen und Römern mit Feierlichkeiten und Freude in Verbindung gebracht. Die Zantedeschie gilt daher in vielen Gegenden noch heute als Glücksbringer.\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nTo view more in this series, please click \"here\" !\n\nNerine is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae. They are bulbous perennials, some evergreen, associated with rocky and arid habitats. They bear spherical umbels of lily-like flowers in shades from white through pink to crimson. In the case of deciduous species, the flowers may appear on naked stems before the leaves develop. Native to South Africa, there are about 30 species in the genus. Though described as lilies, they are not significantly related to the true lilies Lilium, but more closely resemble their relatives, Amaryllis and Lycoris. The genus was established by the cleric and Amaryllidaceae specialist William Herbert in 1820. Nerines have been widely cultivated and much hybridized worldwide, especially Nerine bowdenii, N. sarniensis and N. undulata (previously known as N. flexuosa). The hybrid cultivar 'Zeal Giant' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The other 20 species are rarely cultivated and very little is known regarding their biology. Many species are threatened with extinction due to the loss or degradation of their habitat. Species of Nerine are herbaceous flowering plants that grow from bulbs. Their leaves are linear, obviously flat in some species and appearing threadlike in others. Their flowers are borne in an umbel on a solid leafless stem (scape). Individual flowers are either radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) or have one plane of symmetry (zygomorphic). Each flower has six narrow red or pink tepals joined at the base to form a short extended or recurved tube. The free parts of the tepals are generally wavy. There are six stamens that are inserted in the base of the petals and frequently protrude from the flower. The stamens can be straight or curved with thin filaments and oblong anthers that attach to their filament at the back (dorsifixed). The inferior ovary has one to many ovules. The style is threadlike and has a three-lobed stigma. The fruit is a capsule. Many species of Nerine have petals with wavy edges, such as Nerine humilis. Profusion of flowers in Nerine filifolia, note the filiform leaves of this species.\n\nNerine species can be either evergreen or deciduous; the deciduous species can either grow during the winter or the summer. The growth cycle thus defines three groups. There is a strong association between a species' growth habit, the shape of its leaves and the amount of DNA in its cell nuclei. The largest group of 12 species contains the evergreen nerines that retain their leaves throughout the summer and winter (N. angustifolia, N. appendiculata, N. filamentosa, N. filifolia, N. frithii, N. gaberonensis, N. gibsonii, N. gracilis, N. masoniorum, N. pancratioides, N. platypetala and N. rehmannii). Their leaves are narrow and they have the smallest amount of DNA per nucleus (18.0â24.6 pg). Four deciduous species grow in the winter and do not have any leaves during the summer (N. humilis, N. pudica, N. ridleyi and N. sarniensis). They have wide leaves and more DNA per nucleus (25.3â26.2 pg). A final group of seven species only grow during the summer and have no leaves in the winter (N. bowdenii, N. duparquetiana, N. krigei, N. laticoma, N. marincowitzii, N. pusilla and N. undulata). They have wide leaves and the most DNA per nucleus (26.8â35.3 pg). The earliest published name for the genus was Imhofia, given by Lorenz Heister in 1755. The later name Nerine, published by William Herbert in 1820, was widely used, resulting in a decision to conserve the name Nerine and reject the name Imhofia. The genus name derives from the Nereids (sea-nymphs) of Greek mythology that protected sailors and their ships. When Herbert chose the name of these nymphs for the first species of the genus, Nerine sarniensis, he alluded to the story of how this South African species arrived on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel. It is said that a ship carrying boxes of the bulbs of this species destined for the Netherlands was shipwrecked on Guernsey. The boxes of bulbs were washed up on the island and the bulbs became established and multiplied around the coast.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nTo view more in this series, please click \"here\" !\n\nNerine is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae.
