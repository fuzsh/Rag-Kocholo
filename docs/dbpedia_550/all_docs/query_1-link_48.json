        "text": "Calla (lat.Zantedeschia, Calla) - comes from the Aroid family, native to South Africa. Likes to settle along the banks of reservoirs, in humid lowlands, marshy areas. A very thermophilic plant, it successfully develops in the wild only in regions with a tropical climate.\n\nIt attracts attention with its large, arrow-shaped leaves, rich green color, which are collected in a basal rosette. Prized for its large, vibrant bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It blooms with miniature flowers on the cob, towering on a long stem. A bract leaf in the form of a funnel-shaped collar surrounds the ear-shaped inflorescence. The colors of the collar are very diverse: white, pink, purple, yellow, burgundy, it depends on the type and variety.\n\nAt home, it grows up to 1.5 m in height, in room conditions it is much lower, up to 50-80 cm.\n\nWith proper care, the lifespan is 10 years or more.\n\nOther names: Calla, Richardia, Zantedeskia. Calla.\n\nPopular types:\n\nCalla Ethiopica is an elegant flower with large, green, heart-shaped leaves. Around the inflorescence, sheets of snow-white color. This is the most popular type in indoor floriculture.\n\nCalla Elliotta (Calla Elliottiana) - the exotic beauty of this plant in bright yellow covering leaves, they are large enough, they look bright and elegant.\n\nCalla Rehmanii is the smallest flower among its congeners, no higher than 40-50 cm. It attracts attention with the pink-red coloring of the leaves enveloping the inflorescence.\n\nYou can buy flowering calla lilies in our store\n\nCalla room - Care\n\nA tropical, sophisticated plant that doesn't require too much attention, but there are still basic rules to consider when growing such an unusual flower. The main thing is to ensure constant moisture in the soil and good lighting, otherwise the calla will not be able to form flower buds. Protect the plant from drafts and sudden temperature changes.\n\nLighting. The best place for a flowerpot with calla lilies would be the south side of the apartment, as it requires bright diffused light throughout the 12 hour day. If there is not enough light, install artificial lighting.\n\nTemperature. Despite its thermophilicity, the flower reacts poorly to excessive temperature rise. The best temperature for good plant growth and development is + 22 ° C + 25 ° C. During the rest period, which lasts from two months to six months and falls in the winter, it is recommended to reduce the temperature regime to + 16 ° C + 18 ° C.\n\nAir humidity. High humidity is required. To do this, during the summer heat, spray the plant with water at room temperature. A good solution would be to install a decorative fountain or a humidifier near the flower.\n\nWatering. Constant soil moisture is vital for calla lilies. During the flowering period, watering should be daily, but make sure that water does not get directly onto the tuber. It is best to place the flowerpot with the plant in a container with wet sand or expanded clay. After the cessation of flowering, watering is reduced to once every ten days, during the dormant period, watering is stopped altogether.\n\nTop dressing. Twice a month, superphosphate fertilizers are applied during the flowering period. Complex feeding for flowering plants is also suitable. During the dormant period, fertilizers do not need to be applied. In case the calla has reached a large size, in order to prevent the flowerpot from falling and injuring the flower, you can tie it to a support.\n\nTransfer. Calla lilies should be transplanted after the end of the dormant period, most often in early spring. The tuber is carefully removed, old roots and an earthen lump are removed. Then they are planted in a new, prepared earthen mixture. The soil is suitable fertile, acidified with the obligatory addition of peat. A medium for flowering aroid plants is suitable and can be purchased at a flower shop. If the flowerpot is in good condition, then you do not need to change it. A drainage layer is poured onto the bottom of the pot. Do not bury the tuber too deep in the ground, it is important that the growth points are on the surface. After a successful transplant, the flower is watered, repeated watering only after a week, and maintain this watering regime until the shoots appear. After the emergence of young shoots, watering is plentiful as usual.\n\nTrimming and shaping. There is no need for special formation. On the eve of the dormant period, when the leaves have dried up, they must be carefully trimmed. Also, the plant is periodically inspected, if dried or yellowed leaves are found, they are removed.\n\nBloom. Often, the first flowering occurs in the second year. For several months, small flowers, enveloped in a bright sheet-blanket, rise on a high peduncle. During this period, it is imperative to regularly moisten the soil and carry out top dressing.\n\nAt the end of flowering, when the leaves droop and dry out, the tuber should be removed from the flowerpot, cleaned of the earth and rinsed under water. Leave the tubers in this state for a few days, then carefully separate the leaves. After two weeks, peel off the roots, check for rot, wrap each tuber in a paper towel and leave in a cool room at rest. You may not get the tuber out of the flowerpot, but it is important to reduce the temperature regime to +16 +18 and stop watering. At the end of the dormant period, transplant into new potting soil.\n\nIf the calla is not blooming, then it lacks sunlight, move the flowerpot closer to the window or install additional lighting lamps. Also, the reason may be insufficient watering or improper conditions during the rest period.\n\nReproduction. In the process of transplanting, you can find calla lilies, which are attached to the tuber of the plant. Having separated them, they are planted in a shallow container with an earthen mixture, maintaining a distance between young tubers of about 10 cm. It is imperative to install a good drainage layer in the container. Water periodically and monitor the temperature regime, it should be + 20 + 22 ºС.\n\nDiseases and pests. Most often calla lilies are affected by such infectious and fungal diseases: gray rot, root rot, anthracnose, wet rot.\n\nWhen infected with gray mold, a dirty gray coating forms on the leaves of the plant. Antifungal drugs are used for treatment.\n\nIn the case of stagnant water in the soil, root rot may develop, this leads to rotting of the tuber and wilting of the flower. To save the plant, it is important to take timely measures: transplant it into a new flowerpot, change the soil and treat it with fungicidal preparations.\n\nIf brown spots are found on the leaves, this indicates the development of anthracnose. Infected leaves should be removed and the plant treated with a fungicidal preparation.\n\nWet rot - affects all parts of the plant, unfortunately this disease cannot be treated, the infected flowers are destroyed.\n\nCalla lilies can also be attacked by pests: aphids and spider mites; treatment with an insecticidal preparation will help to cope with them.\n\nCalla is indoor in winter. This is the dormant time, so watering is gradually stopped, the temperature in the room drops to + 16 ° C + 18 ° C.\n\nInteresting Facts. These beautiful plants enhance immunity, have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory effect. But, it is important to remember - all parts of the plant contain a poisonous substance, so do not put them in the nursery and do not let pets close.\n\nCalla lilies are used in folk medicine as an antidote to snakebite.\n\nThis outlandish flower can predict the weather: on the eve of rain, the plant opens its petals as much as possible, preparing to collect more moisture, and before hot weather, the petals envelop the central candle as tightly as possible."
