        "text": "Hailing from southern Africa, these classically beautiful flowers are simple to cultivate and are typically grown as annuals, but they can also return year after year as perennials in areas with mild winters.\n\nEye-catching flowers, a long bloom season, brilliant colors, and easy growth – the calla lily delivers it all!\n\nFor the inside track on this beautiful flower, join us now for a look at 21 of the best calla lilies for your garden.\n\nHere’s what we’re looking at:\n\nGarden Species\n\nThere are eight known species in the genus Zantedeschia, with several that are popularly used for cut flower arrangements as well as garden cultivation.\n\nOne species, Z. aethiopica, is an evergreen, retaining its leaves and producing flowers continuously, given the right conditions. All of the other species are deciduous and lose their leaves as they go dormant for winter.\n\nThe stately, long-stemmed flowers of the large white arum lily, Z. aethiopica, are a familiar garden favorite for many. The “flower” is technically a spathe, a modified leaf.\n\nBut breeders – notably those in California, the Netherlands, and New Zealand – have developed interspecific hybrids, producing exceptionally colorful spathes with a long flowering time.\n\nThese hybrids are derived mainly from crossing plants from the species Z. elliottiana, Z. pentlandii, and Z. rehmannii.\n\nHere’s a look at what makes these species so popular.\n\nZ. aethiopica\n\nThe arum lily, Z. aethiopica, is large and grand, producing masses of flawless spathes of creamy white to blush pink that rise on tall stems above the handsome, semi-glossy foliage.\n\nThe arrowhead leaves are forest green with deep fluting.\n\nA perennial evergreen, the arum lily can retain its foliage and continue to develop flowers over winter. But it must have the right conditions – warm temperatures (over 65°F) and plenty of water (one to two inches per week).\n\nLike all callas, this type thrives in moist, rich sites throughout the garden. When grown as a perennial, ensure winter soil is well-draining.\n\nUnlike the other species, it can also tolerate semi-aquatic conditions and makes a good bog, marsh, or water plant as well.\n\nZ. aethiopica\n\nPlants grow 24 to 40 inches tall and are hardy in Zones 8 to 11. Bags of rhizomes are available at Eden Brothers.\n\n‘Crowborough,’ ‘Green Goddess,’ and ‘Sunshine’ are a few popular cultivars. And you can learn more about bog planting for arums in our guide to growing calla lilies.\n\nZ. albomaculata\n\nThe spotted or white spotted calla lily, Z. albomaculata, has distinctive, ivory white spathes that sometimes appear in variations of pale yellow to coral pink.\n\nThe funnel-like spathes are tall and narrow, and the broad, heart-shaped foliage has white speckles and fluted edges.\n\nLike all the other species except Z. aethiopica, the spotted calla requires winter dormancy and should be lifted from the garden before freezing temperatures set in.\n\nAn exceptional cut flower, plants reach a height of 12 to 24 inches and are hardy in Zones 10 and 11.\n\nZ. albomaculata ‘Helen O’Connor’ is a popular pink-toned variety.\n\nZ. elliottiana\n\nKnown as the golden arum or golden calla, Z. elliottiana features large, trumpet-like spathes of glorious golden yellow and its upright, arrowhead foliage is lightly freckled.\n\nA standout species that provides weeks of blooms, Z. elliottiana is often used for breeding and provides several exceptional cultivars for cut flowers and gardens.\n\nPlants grow 24 to 36 inches tall, and rhizomes must be lifted for winter. This species is hardy in Zones 8 to 10.\n\n‘Black Magic’ and ‘Flame’ are a couple of well-known cultivars.\n\nZ. pentlandii\n\nSpecific to the Mapoch region of Mpumalanga province in South Africa, the Mapoch lily, Z. pentlandii has dazzling, cup-shaped spathes of sunshine yellow with a deep purple blotch at the inner base.\n\nThe semi-glossy leaves are glaucous green and plain (i.e. non-spotted) with a broad, ovate shape.\n\nHardy in Zones 8 to 10, when grown as annuals, these plants provide excellent color in the late summer garden.\n\nA smaller species that reaches a height of 12 to 24 inches, Z. pentlandii and its cultivars make good choices for cutting gardens, small spaces, and containers.\n\n‘Black Star,’ ‘Millennium Gold,’ and ‘Picasso’ are a few colorful cultivars.\n\nZ. rehmannii\n\nAlso called the pink or red calla, Z. rehmannii features pretty spathes in intense shades of mauve, maroon, pink, purple, white, and yellow – perfect counterpoints to the strappy, tropical green foliage.\n\nAnother species used extensively for breeding, plants are prolific bloomers and provide weeks of saturated color.\n\nA smaller species in comparison to the large arums, plants grow 12 to 24 inches tall and are well suited for borders, containers, and patio pots. These are hardy in Zones 8 to 10.\n\n‘Indian Summer,’ ‘Lavender Gem,’ and ‘Odessa’ are notable cultivars.\n\nLess Common Species\n\nThere are also three less common species, not yet readily available in the commercial market.\n\nZ. jucunda has trumpet-shaped flowers in various shades of yellow, from light lemon to saturated canary.\n\nZ. odorata is rare outside of its natural range in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, and produces a creamy white spathe with a sweetly floral fragrance like freesia.\n\nZ. valida is an attractive bicolor that features a creamy, mottled green spathe with a deep purple throat and vigorous arrowhead foliage.\n\n3. Black Magic\n\n‘Black Magic’ has glowing, trumpet-shaped flowers of bright yellow with a distinctive black throat that sit atop the attractive arrowhead foliage of freckled, jade green leaves.\n\nThe long-lasting flowers look terrific when mixed with other warm colors, or with contrasting mauves and purples. It also makes a sunny standalone specimen in beds, islands, or patio pots, and a fantastic cut flower.\n\nPlants grow 24 to 36 inches and are hardy in Zones 8 to 10.\n\n5. Crowborough\n\nA large, clump-forming deciduous to semi-evergreen perennial (in areas with mild winters), ‘Crowborough’ bears large, cup-like flowers of pure white.\n\nThe creamy-to-yellow spadix forms an attractive cluster of chartreuse seed pods if allowed to mature, and the semi-glossy foliage forms an attractive clump of jade green, arrowhead leaves.\n\nA regal anchor for beds, foundations, and islands that can also be used as a marginal aquatic, plants grow 24 to 48 inches and are hardy in Zones 8 to 11. Lift and store the rhizomes over winter in cooler regions.\n\n8. Green Goddess\n\nA striking cultivated variety, ‘Green Goddess’ features bi-tonal, trumpet-like spathes of creamy white with generous, chartreuse-to-spinach green edging.\n\nWhen fully open, the flowers have a pronounced, beaked tip and rise handsomely on tall stems above the arrowhead foliage.\n\nFreely flowering and lightly fragrant, ‘Green Goddess’ makes an excellent choice for beds, islands, and patio pots. Plants reach a height of 24 to 36 inches and are hardy in Zones 8 to 11.\n\n9. Helen O’Connor\n\nA pretty and distinctive black-throated variety, ‘Helen O’Connor’ has unique spathes that start out pale yellow, then morph into mottled shades of apricot or pink as they age.\n\nThe flowers have a deep maroon-to-black throat, and are beautifully framed by heart-shaped and speckled jade green leaves.\n\nA semi-dwarf variety, plants reach a mature height of 20 inches, making them well-suited for borders, patio pots, and planters. These are hardy in Zones 10 to 11.\n\n14. Millennium Gold\n\n‘Millennium Gold’ sports sparkling, cup-shaped spathes of buttercup yellow that rise atop the jade green foliage. The arrowhead leaves are semi-glossy and heavily speckled.\n\nAn excellent choice to brighten up beds, borders, planters, or patio pots, ‘Millennium Gold’ also makes an attractive and long-lasting cut flower. Plants grow 18 to 24 inches tall and are hardy in Zones 9 to 11."
