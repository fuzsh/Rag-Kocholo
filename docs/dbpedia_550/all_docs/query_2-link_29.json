        "text": "1/16/03\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContacts:\n\nLinda Naeve, Reiman Gardens, (515) 294-2710, lnaeve@iastate.edu\n\nJean McGuire, Continuing Education and Communication Services, (515) 294-7033, jmcguire@iastate.edu\n\nCalla Lilies Exude Simple Elegance\n\nBy Linda Naeve\n\nExtension Coordinator\n\nReiman Gardens\n\nOver the years, artists have painted flowers that became their trademark. When we think of the work of Claude Monet, water lilies come to mind. Vincent Van Gough is known for his 'Sunflowers.' This week's Reiman's Pick  the calla lily  is often associated with 20th century painter, Georgia O'Keeffe. Although she captured the beauty of many flowers in her work, her calla lily paintings are among her most recognized.\n\nThe simple elegance of the calla lily blossom makes a stunning statement in art and in the garden. It gets its name from the Greek word meaning 'beautiful.' The flower doesn't even have a single petal. The large, single petal-like structure that forms a funnel is a modified leaf called a \"spathe.\" The long, slender spike in the center is referred to as the \"spadex.\" The spathe has such a soft, velvety appearance and is so perfectly formed, it almost looks artificial.\n\nFlorists often use the white calla lily, Zantedeschia aethiopica, for weddings and other special occasions. It grows two to three feet tall with glossy, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The leaves of some species, such as the yellow or golden callas, Z. Elliottiana and Z. rehmannii, are blotched with white or semi-transparent spots. Besides the popular white species, calla lilies bloom in yellow, pink, lavender, peach, apricot and salmon.\n\nCalla lilies are native to South Africa, where the plant grows up to six feet tall in moist ditches. Its native habitat changes from wet and swampy in one season to very dry in another. Therefore, it grows best in rich, organic soils with plenty of moisture, then, after blooming, the leaves fade and the plants rest for a while. Calla lilies can be adapted to grow as marginal plants in water gardens. They prefer full sun to partial shade.\n\nIn Iowa, calla lilies are considered tender perennials because they are hardy only where temperatures don't drop below 30 degrees. They have thick rhizomes that can be planted in containers or directly in the garden in mid-May. Plant the rhizomes three to four inches deep and about 12 inches apart. Water them well and fertilize once a month with a light side-dress application of a complete analysis garden fertilizer.\n\nAfter the first frost in the fall, cut off the leaves about two inches above the soil line and dig the rhizomes. Set them in a shady, warm and dry location for a week or two to allow the rhizomes to dry. Bury the dry rhizomes in vermiculite, sawdust or peat moss and store in a cool (45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) location until next planting season.\n\nCalla lilies make great houseplants. You can purchase plants from the garden center or plant the rhizomes in containers in late winter, three inches deep in potting soil. Keep the soil barely damp until the first shoots appear. Set them in a bright, sunny location and keep the soil uniformly wet. Calla lilies do best and last longer when the night temperatures are 10 degrees cooler than the day. After blooming and when the leaves fade, allow the soil to dry out for a few weeks. Remove the dead leaves and plant the rhizome outdoors or start it growing again by repotting it in fresh soil and watering it.\n\nIn the garden, calla lilies have the most impact when planted in groupings of several plants, rather than as individuals. Their glossy leaves and unusual flowers bring a tropical look to the garden.\n\nYou can see a beautiful display of regal white calla lilies in the Conservatory at Reiman Gardens and in container displays throughout the Conservatory Complex. Although there isn't much of the white stuff outside this season, you will see plenty of white in the Conservatory. The exhibit features white azaleas, chrysanthemums and begonias highlighted with fragrant paper white narcissus and calla lilies.\n\n-30-"
