        "text": "Zantedeschia (Francesco Zantedeschi, wrote on Italian plants in 1825). Syn., Richardia. Araceae. Calla of horticulturists. Perennial herbs grown for their ornamental corolla-like spathes and sometimes for spotted foliage; greenhouse subjects in the northern regions, but grown permanently in the open in California and other warm parts. The genus comprises the \"calla lily.\"\n\nHerbaceous plants with many long-petioled lvs., all from a thick rhizome: peduncles appearing with the lvs.: petioles spongy, often bristly below; blade sagittate, hastate, or lanceolate to cordate-ovate, the numerous primary and secondary nerves excurrent: peduncle as long or longer than the lvs.; spathe large, open, with a flaring, pointed, recurved tip; spadix staminate above, and pistillate below (Fig. 4029): fls. many and small, naked, crowded, staminodes sometimes mixed with the ovaries: fr. a 1-3-celled berry.—Engler admits 8 species in his latest monograph (Das Pflanzenreich, hft. 64, 1915), in Trop. and S. Afr. The common calla-lily was long known in commerce as Calla aethiopica. Later it was known as Richardia africana, it having been found that the genus Calla, as more closely defined, could not include it. The Richardia of Kunth, 1818, under which the plant has been named, is antedated by another Richardia, and Zantedeschia, 1826, is considered by latest authorities to be the tenable name and is retained in the \"nomina conservanda\" of the International Rules as against both Richardia and Aroides. The genus Calla, as understood by modern botanists, comprises a single species, C. palustris, native in swamps in the northern hemisphere, including N. E. U. S. and Canada; see Fig. 742, Vol. II. For the black calla, see Arum.\n\nWhen grown for the flowers only, zantedeschias may be planted out permanently on a bench, using very rich soil and giving an abundance of water while growing. They may be kept growing continually or given a season of rest, as desired. Plants in pots are usually started late in summer from dry tubers. The species having yellow and pink spathes seem to do best when grown without a resting-period.\n\nCulture of callas. (T. D. Hatfield.)\n\nThe so-called calla of gardens (Zantedeschia aethiopica) has been a favorite for generations. Although often grown as a window-plant, it is very unsuitable and seldom blooms under house treatment. When grown for winter flowers, it is customary to give the roots a rest during summer-time. They may be dried and stored if necessary. It is in this condition that Californian callas are received. \"It is the opinion of the writer that summer-resting would be the best treatment for those grown as house-plants, as well-grown dried roots are more likely to bloom. But rest must be enforced, for callas will grow all the year round, increasing in size and numbers when planted out. The largest blooms are always secured from summer-grown plants. They are taken up in the autumn, given good loam and plenty of root-room, with a liberal allowance of liquid fertilizer when well established. They thrive best under good light, and in a minimum temperature of 55°.\n\nThere are several varieties, all differing only in size, from those which grow 6 feet to \"Little Gem\"—1 foot. Some are said to be more odorous than others, although all are fragrant. Besides being invaluable pot-plants, they can be used with good effect in indoor water-gardens, growing luxuriantly when partly submerged; and also in bog-gardens, and on the margins of ponds, to give subtropical effects.\n\nAlthough introduced to cultivation about twenty -five years ago, Z. Elliottiana is yet of secondary importance, although an acquisition. It is a South African species, about which comparatively little is known in the wild. (N. E. Brown writes in \"Flora of Tropical Africa,\" Vol. 8, 1902: \"This species is stated to have been raised from seeds received from South Africa, but I have reason to believe that its habitat is somewhere in the northern part of the Transvaal.\" The plant was described as Richardia Elliottiana in Garden and Forest, New York, 1892.) When introduced, it was thought difficult to grow. It was first grown in this country by William Robinson, gardener to F. L. Ames, North Easton, Massachusetts, Mr. Harris, gardener to H. H. Hunnewell, Wellesley, Massachusetts, and Joseph Tailby, of Wellesley. The last named is a commercial grower, who looked on his importation as an investment. The bulbs (corms or roots) were expensive—a guinea or thereabouts—and about as big as marbles. Tailby's experience is interesting and it may be valuable to the reader. He came near losing his whole stock by cutting out the eyes, with the object of getting separate plants. There had been no sign of natural division, nor has there since; although some are still of the opinion that by proper manipulation they may be increased by division, as we now do potatoes, but the wounds must be given time to heal over. The roots are kept over in a cellar at a temperature of 45° F., or thereabouts, until April, when they will show signs of starting. They should be potted then, but kept rather dry until the roots develop. The pots will be fairly well filled with roots before much growth shows, and they can be kept under benches in a coolhouse, or even in the cellar, for two weeks after potting. With the roots well started, they come along quickly, coming into bloom in ten to twelve weeks. A good bright intermediate house suits them best, and some liquid fertilizer will help them when the flower-stems appear. The blooms last a long time, opening greenish yellow, turning to pure orange-yellow, and finally green when aging. Seeds are formed plentifully; and by these, though slow, is yet the surest and quickest method of propagation. During the ripening period of seeds, they must have the very best attention. They usually do not become thoroughly ripened until August. Pot-grown plants are better stored in pots. The whole culture is easy when it is known.\n\nSeeds of Z. Elliottiana sown in November usually come up strong, but the plantlets are difficult to handle and liable to go off when very young. It is the safest way to let them stay in the seed-boxes, ripen there, and plant them farther apart next season. Seeds have been sown outdoors with very gratifying results. Almost a year is gained in this way, as the roots (or bulbs) are considerably larger than box-grown seedlings. Older roots held over until settled weather and planted like potatoes bloomed freely all summer, making fine roots; they were green when cut by frost in October, but ripened seeds. To do this successfully takes a longer season, and the plants must be started indoors.\n\nThe calla in California. (Ernest Braunton.)\n\nIn considering the calla in California, it is necessary to treat it under two general heads: first, as an ornament; and second, as an article of commerce. The popular and growing demand for calla bulbs (or tubers) speaks much for the plant as an ornamental. Many, indeed, are the uses to which it is put. It is, perhaps, most commonly used as a belt along fences, and not infrequently as a hedge between two properties; or nearly as often is found along one side of a house in a long narrow bed. For effective planting it is much in demand for grouping around hydrants and unsightly objects in damp places, at watersides; sometimes as a border around a fish- or lily-pond, oftentimes growing in bunches or masses in the water itself; or massed on a slope near water; mixed with other tropical vegetation; or as a border to tropical jungles; and very effective, indeed, is it in the lower tiers of basins around a large fountain with myriophyllum hanging down from the base of the callas. For all of these purposes the foliage is of even more importance than the flowers. As it grows luxuriantly here in almost any location, it is very seldom seen as a pot-plant either in the dwelling or on sale at the nurseries. In the most favored places only is it entirely secure from the frost, although the damage to it from this source is not serious in or around Los Angeles. Although doing fairly well in the full sun, our summer climate is too dry for it to attain its greatest beauty and luxuriance wholly without protection, and it may therefore be seen in perfection only when grown in partial shade. A good supply of water and manure is also an important factor in its proper development.\n\nThe spathe is subject to many variations in form, both in size and shape, some being long, rather narrow and pointed, ending in a decidedly recurved awn, while others are nearly circular, with the sharp point almost wanting and standing upright the same as the remainder of spathe. It frequently happens that the spathe is double and even triple, sometimes in its entirety but often only partially so. In the latter case it often assumes some very strange forms. The spadix is not so variable and seldom departs from the type, although an occasional double or abnormal spadix is found. Most other species or varieties than Z. aethiopica are found but sparsely in California gardens, the most common ones being the spotted-leaved and the dwarf form known as the Little Gem, but Z. Elliottiana is grown extensively in certain areas, especially about Santa Cruz, which is the center of the bulb-growing industry in California.\n\nCommercially, the growing of the bulbs for eastern and foreign markets is a sure source of revenue, and is conducted extensively throughout southern California. The local market for the so-called flowers is of course limited, but if grown in a practically frostless belt, the blooms will more than pay for the cultivation of the winter field, as in that season of the year flowers of all kinds are scarce. The average retail price for good blooms in midwinter is 50 cents a dozen; the wholesale price about $1 a 100. Bulbs at retail cost about one-half, or even less, what they do in the East. The commercial growers get at present (January, 1916), $25 to $60 a 1,000, according to size, the market calling for tubers 1 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter. Larger sizes are quoted as \"fancy\" and command extra prices. Although they can be grown in almost any soil with some success, a free cool blackish loam is best, and they do not thrive in a hot gravelly or stony soil. The lands near the coast, where swept by the cooling sea-breeze, are productive of the best results, both in bloom and tuber. Land containing sufficient alkali to prevent the growth of many common crops will produce good callas if other requirements are present. In field-planting it is much better to put in small bulbs about 4 inches apart than to sow the offsets promiscuously in the row; when the sets are thus sown, they should be taken up the following year and the small bulbs properly planted. Offsets sown as above and left four to six years (the usual time for a good crop) have never produced satisfactory results. No pest seriously attacks foliage or bloom, but in dry years more especially, the common sow-bug eats into the tubers very seriously and receives considerable assistance from millipedes. Both these pests are a considerable nuisance to the California nurseryman and gardener.\n\nMost of the garden forms have been named under Richardia rather than under Zantedeschia; in the following list R-the former and Z the latter. — R. Adlamii, Hort. Leichtlin. Strong-growing, with lvs. sagittate, bright green, and somewhat exceeding the scape: spathe short and rather open, creamy white with a black or purple throat. Trop. Afr. Distributed by Max Leichtlin (Germany) in 1898. There are hybrids of this and Z. Elliottiana.—Z. angustiloba, Engler (R. angustiloba, Schott. Z. chloroleuca, Engler & Gilg). Lvs. glabrous, without spots, the petiole without bristles; blade hastate, narrow, the basal lobes one-fourth the length of the apical one, 20 in. long, 3 in. wide at the base: peduncle 4-4 1/2 ft. long: spathe about 4 in. long, sulfur-yellow, red inside at base. Angola. — R. aurata, Hort., said to be a hybrid of Z. albo-maculata X Z. hastata (oculata): lvs. spotted: spathes large, yellow. — R. cantabrigiensis, Lynch-Z. Elliottiana X R. aurata or Z. Rehmannii X Z. Elliottiana. — R. intermedia, Hort. Very free- flowering: lf.-stalks bright green, marbled with white and rose: spathe very dark yellow, with small black blotch at the base. — R. Lathamiana, Hort.-Z. Elliottiana X Z. albo-maculata. — “R. suffusa. A distinct dwarf-habited plant with a creamy white spathe, the base in the inside of a rich violet-purple shade. It ia apparently a plant of good constitution.\" Gn. 55, p. 317, note. — R. Taylori, Hort., is Z. Elliottiana X R. aurata."
