        "text": "Orchid Botanical names Mostly Cymbidium, Dendrobium, (Singapore Orchid), Oncidium and Vanda, rarely Phalaenopsis (Moth Orchid) or Cattleya. Common names Cymbids, Singapore Orchid, Moth Orchid. What to look for Fully open to half-open flowers, as buds will not develop after sprays are cut. Try to buy sprays with stem ends placed in vials full of preservative solution or damp cotton wool. With the exception of some Cymbidiums, Orchids are imported, so check flowers carefully to ensure they are not creased or bruised. Avoid flowers with a slightly dried, transparent appearance, as this indicates chilling or ethylene injury. Temperature Above 12° C. Do not refrigerate. Water Recut at least 2 to 4 cm off stems if they are bought without stem ends in vials, or if the water in the vials has run out. Either top up the solution in the vials and replace cut stems, or place the stems in vases with clean water containing preservative. Refill vial solutions daily. Food Preservative is essential. This will help flowers open and keep open flowers looking fresh. Ethylene Very sensitive. 142 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nExtra tips Individual Dendrobium flowers can be immersed in room-temperature tap water for 5 minutes to revive them. Individual Orchid flowers can then be placed in a plastic bag with a piece of moist paper and kept above 12° C for a few days. Handle very carefully as flowers are susceptible to bruising. Rough handling of Cymbidium flowers can also dislodge the pollen cap, which will result in rapid wilting. Misting is recommended. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 143\n\nOrnithogalum Botanical name Ornithogalum arabicum (Star of Bethlehem), O. thyrsoides (Chincherinch). Common name Star of Bethlehem, Chincherinch. What to look for Buy bunches when about a quarter of the lower flowers on the spike are open. Avoid bunches with wilted lower flowers and yellow leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Break open bunches and cut 1 to 2 cm off each stem with sharp secateurs, strip any leaves that would be underwater and wash stems under the tap. Place immediately in cool water treated with a flower preservative. Food Preservative is optional. Ethylene Not sensitive. 144 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nA TO Z CARE GUIDE | 145 Peony Botanical name Paeonia lactiflora hybrids. Common name Peony, Tree Peony. What to look for Buy flowers when the first petal is separating from the bud and colour is clearly visible. Flowers cut earlier when buds are completely green will have a shorter vase life. Fully open flowers will last about half as long as coloured buds and are very prone to physical damage, so watch out for bent, creased or torn petals. Temperature 6 to 10° C. Water Recut 2 cm off each stem with sharp secateurs and place in clean water. Remove any foliage that would be underwater. Food Preservative is essential. This will help buds open. Ethylene Not sensitive.\n\n146 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS Phlox Botanical name Phlox paniculata, P. drummondii. Common name Phlox, Wild Sweet William. What to look for Buy when over half of the florets are open. Avoid bunches with signs of flower drop. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut stems, and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Place immediately in cold water. Food Preservative is essential. It will help buds develop and help delay flower drop. Ethylene Very sensitive.\n\nA TO Z CARE GUIDE | 147 Physostegia Botanical name Physostegia purpurea, P. virginiana. Common name Physostegia. What to look for Buy when at least 3 flowers per spike are open. Only buy bunches that have been treated against ethylene as Physostegia is extremely sensitive. Avoid bunches with flower drop. Pink varieties seem to last longer. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Place in water treated with a preservative as soon as possible, after stripping any leaves that would be underwater and recutting 2 to 3 cm off each stem. Replace with fresh water daily. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Very sensitive.\n\nPieris Botanical name Pieris japonica. Common name Andromeda, Pieris. What to look for Buy bunches when the bell-shaped flowers are fully open. Leaves should be glossy green, and flowers unmarked. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off branches with sharp secateurs and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Food Preservative is essential. It will help maintain open flowers. Ethylene Not sensitive. 148 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nPineapple Lily Botanical name Eucomis comosa. Common name Pineapple Lily. What to look for Buy when the flowers in the lower third to half of the spike are open. Look for straight stems. Temperature 4 to 8° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Food Preservative is essential. It will help buds to open up the spike, and maintain open flowers. Ethylene Mildly sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 149\n\nProtea Botanical names A wide range of Proteas are used as cut flowers, including Protea neriifolia, P. cynaroides, P. magnifica, P. grandiceps, P. repens, P. eximia, P. scolymocephala. Common names Pink Mink, White Mink, Pink Ice, King Protea, Queen Protea, Princess Protea, Honey Protea, Mini Protea. What to look for Buy Proteas with bracts that are starting to open P. neriifolia and Pink Ice should have a circle at least 4 cm wide at the top, while the bracts in Kings should be reflexed back. Avoid flowers with a grey tinge as they are old. Most importantly, check the leaves for signs of blackening in Kings, Queens, P. neriifolia and Pink Ice—they should be uniformly green with no black or brown spots. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems with sharp secateurs, and strip any leaves that would be underwater and place in cold water. Change the vase water at least every second day, as Proteas turn vase water brown. Food Preservative is recommended, as it helps delay leaf blackening. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips Keep Proteas under strong light, as this reduces leaf blackening. 150 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nPtilotus Botanical name Ptilotus obovatus. Common name Mulla Mulla. What to look for The feathery flower-heads should have started to open. Look for strong stems that can hold the flower-heads. Flower-heads should be showing pink-white in colour. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 to 3 cm off each stem. Place in cold water immediately. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Not sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 151\n\nQueen Anne’s Lace Botanical name Ammi majus. Common name Queen Anne’s Lace. What to look for Buy when the white flowers are half- to fully open. Stems must be thick enough to support the flower-heads. Avoid bunches with wilted heads and yellow leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Place in cold water treated with a preservative as soon as possible, after stripping any leaves that would be underwater and recutting 2 to 3 cm off each stem. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips Tends to wilt if long stems are used in floral foam. 152 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nRanunculus Botanical name Ranunculus asiaticus. Common name Persian or Turban Buttercup. What to look for Buy when the flowers are in bud and fully coloured. Avoid bunches with yellow, decayed leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Split bunches and thoroughly wash stems. Recut stems and strip leaves as they will foul the water quickly. Change vase water regularly. Food Preservative. Ethylene Not sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 153\n\nRiceflower Botanical name Ozothamnus diosmifolius, Cassinia species. Common name Riceflower. What to look for Buy fresh branches, with tips that are not dry and curled. Shake bunches to test for signs of leaf and flower drop. Leaves tend to dry and drop before the ‘flowers’. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Place in cold water. Food Preservative is essential. It will help delay leaf and flower drop. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips First sign of ageing is leaf yellowing and drop. 154 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nRose Botanical name Rosa hybrida. Common name Rose. What to look for Buy bunches with strong stems that support the blooms. It is impossible to suggest a perfect opening stage to buy Roses, as this varies quite widely between varieties. In general, vase life will be better for flowers picked a little more open than those sold in tight bud—this is especially true in winter. Tight buds can fail to open, particularly during the colder months, and are prone to bent neck, where the stem weakens just under the flower and the flower-head flops over. Lower leaves should be dark green and the veins should not be prominent. Check the cut stem ends—they should be crisp and green, not dry and dark, which is a sure sign of age. Roses suffer from Botrytis, a fungal infection that turns petals brown; extra care is needed when the weather is warm and humid. While it is often difficult to detect Botrytis, look closely at the outer petals and do not buy those bunches with small brown spots. Once a Rose has this problem there is nothing you can do other than throw the Rose away. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Keep Roses in the fridge or the coolroom as much as possible, with plastic placed over buckets—do not place outside the shop. Water Flower life in Roses is highly dependent on flowers being looked after properly at every stage. If possible, recut stems underwater—removing 2 to 3 cm from each stem. If you can’t cut underwater, cut with sharp secateurs and immediately place stems in cold water treated with a preservative. Top up water at least daily. In general, use cool water to prevent early opening and ‘blown’ blooms, and use warm water to A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 155\n\nhasten bud opening, but be careful as Roses can blow open within minutes in warm water. Strip any leaves that would be underwater. Only remove thorns when it is absolutely necessary. Remove thorns and leaves carefully so as not to damage stems, as this will increase the likelihood of bacterial infection. Food Preservative is essential. This will help buds open and maintain open flowers. Replace with fresh preservative at least every second day. Ethylene Roses are sensitive to ethylene, with some varieties, notably dark reds, being more sensitive than others. Signs of ethylene damage are blackened edges of petals and failure of buds to open. Extra tips A good way to revive wilted Roses is to recut stems (preferably underwater), then wrap the flower-heads tightly in newspaper, forcing the heads into an upright position. Place the stems, up to just below the flowerheads, in lukewarm water for several hours. This way the flowers are not underwater, which minimises the chance of fungal diseases spreading. 156 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nRudbeckia Botanical name Rudbeckia hirta hybrids. Common name Rudbeckia, Black-eyed Susan. What to look for Buy bunches when flowers are fully open. Avoid bunches with yellow or black leaves at the stem ends. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Break open bunches and cut 1 to 2 cm off each stem with sharp secateurs, strip any leaves that would be underwater and wash stems under the tap. Place immediately in cool water treated with a flower preservative. Food Preservative is essential. The preservative will help buds develop and ensure open flowers last. Ethylene Sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 157\n\nSandersonia Botanical name Sandersonia auriculata. Common name Golden Bells. What to look for Choose bunches with between a third and a half of the lower flowers (bells) open. Avoid bunches with yellow leaves. If possible, buy bunches with the stem ends placed in sachets filled with water. Temperature 4 to 8° C. Water Recut 2 cm off each stem with sharp secateurs and place in clean water. Remove any foliage that would be underwater. Alternatively, recut stems and replace in sachets filled with preservative. Food Preservative is essential. This will help buds open. Ethylene Not sensitive. 158 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nScabiosa Botanical name Scabiosa atropurpurea. Common name Scabiosa, Pincushion Flower. What to look for Buy when flowers are fully open. Try and buy bunches that have been treated against ethylene, although this could be difficult. Avoid bunches with petal drop and/or yellow leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Place in water treated with a preservative as soon as possible, after stripping any leaves that would be underwater and recutting 2 to 3 cm off each stem. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Very sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 159\n\nSedum Botanical name Sedum species, usually S. spectabile. Common name Sedum. What to look for Buy when flowers are forming a dense coloured display on the top of the stems and are all open. Leaves should show no sign of yellowing. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Break open bunches, recut 2 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Wash stems under the tap, then place in cold water. Food Preservative is essential. It will help maintain open flowers. Ethylene Not sensitive. 160 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nSnapdragon Botanical name Antirrhinum majus. Common name Snapdragon. What to look for Buy when at least a third of the lower florets are open. Shake bunches to make sure all florets are intact and there is no drop. Snapdragons bend upwards when lain flat, so choose straight spikes. Check that your supplier has treated bunches against ethylene. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off each stem with sharp secateurs and place in clean water. Remove any foliage that would be underwater as it rots quickly. Replace water daily. Food Preservative is essential. This will help buds open. Ethylene Very sensitive. Extra tips Tips will bend upwards if stored flat, so always keep upright in water. Pinching the top bud when arranging flowers will prevent this bending and promote even flowering of the rest of the buds. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 161\n\nSolidaster Botanical names Aster ericoides X Solidaster luteus (cross between Solidago and Aster). Common names Solidaster. What to look for Buy when at least half of the small yellow flowers are open. Avoid bunches with yellow leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems, strip leaves and place in cold water. Change vase water regularly. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Not sensitive. 162 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nStatice Botanical name Limonium sinuatum, L. suworowii. Common name Statice, Russian Statice, Rat’s Tails. What to look for Buy stems where most of the flowers are fully developed as they do not open in the vase. Avoid bunches with slimy stems and lower leaves. Check the section of the bunch that is underwater, and avoid those with a strong sulphur smell. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Break apart bunches as soon as possible for better air circulation. Recut 2 cm off each stem, and strip leaves that will be underwater, then wash stems under the tap to remove any dirt and slime. Change vase water daily, as Statice quickly fouls it. Food Preservative is optional. However, chlorine in the vase water is essential with Statice to control growth of bacteria and slime. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips Statice can be dried easily by hanging bunches upside down in a wellventilated area. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 163\n\nStephanotis Botanical name Stephanotis floribunda. Common name Stephanotis. What to look for Buy when one or two flowers per cluster are open. Flowers should be pure white, with no sign of brown marks or creases. Check for strong fragrance as this is a sign of freshness. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Place in cold water. Food Preservative is essential. It will help buds come out and maintain scent. Ethylene Sensitive. Extra tips May be misted. 164 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nStirlingia Botanical name Stirlingia simplex. Common name Stirlingia. What to look for When buying Stirlingia it is important to work out if the branches have been ‘dried and dyed’. Dried branches do not need water, as they have been preserved and will last for months. Fresh Stirlingia should be bought with at least half the flowers open, as they don’t open much in the vase. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Keep dried and dyed branches out of water. For fresh branches, carefully strip any leaves and small branches that would be underwater, and cut at least 2 to 3 cm off the end of each branch. Place in cold water that contains a preservative. Keep cool as much as possible. Food Preservative is essential for fresh branches. Ethylene Not sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 165\n\nStock Botanical name Matthiola incana hybrids. Common name Stock. What to look for Buy stems with at least a third to a half of the lower flowers open. Avoid bunches with brown marks on petals, as Stock are susceptible to fungal diseases. Bunches should have had the woody, white root section cut off each stem. Check for scent—strong scent is a good sign of freshness. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems with secateurs and be sure to remove the woody base and roots, then wash stems under the tap to remove any dirt and slime. Remove all leaves that would be underwater. Vase water containing Stock quickly develops a foul odour due to rapid bacterial growth. To control this, you must use a preservative and change water daily. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Sensitive. 166 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nSunflower Botanical name Helianthus annuus. Common name Sunflower. What to look for Buy when flowers are half- to fully open. Look for strong stems that will support the (sometimes) large flower. Leaves should have no sign of wilting, black marks or yellowing. Temperature 4 to 8° C. Water Recut 2 to 4 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Leaves will wilt and die before the flower, so it is a good idea to strip all but the top leaves. To help prevent leaf drooping, add 10 drops of household detergent to 5 L of water, and leave flowers in this solution for 1 to 3 hours, or no longer than overnight. Food Preservative is essential. It will help maintain open flowers. Ethylene Not sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 167\n\nSweet Pea Botanical name Lathyrus odoratus hybrids. Common name Sweet Pea. What to look for Buy bunches where the top buds are fully coloured and partly open. Check for scent—strong scent is a good sign of freshness. Shake bunches and avoid those where flowers drop off, as this is a sign of ethylene damage. Avoid bunches with yellow leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems. Remove all leaves that will be underwater and place in cold water. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Very sensitive. Extra tips Take care when separating bunches, as Sweet Peas cling together with tendrils. Rough handling will damage flowers and leaves. 168 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nThryptomene Botanical name Thryptomene calycina. Common names Grampians Thryptomene, Australian Lace Flower. What to look for Avoid bunches with closed flowers and dry foliage. Choose bunches where a fifth to a third of flowers are open, and watch out for flower drop late in the season (September–October). Don’t buy Thryptomene bunches that have been placed on the floor under wet hessian—this reduces vase life and can result in fungal infection. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Separate bunches, recut 2 cm off stems with sharp secateurs and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Wash stripped stems under the tap, then place in cold water. Food Preservative is essential to open buds and maintain open flowers. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips Will take up water through the leaves and flowers, so can be misted. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 169\n\nTrachelium Botanical name Trachelium caeruleum. Common name Trachelium. What to look for Buy when a quarter to a third of the flowers are open. Only buy bunches that have been treated against ethylene. Avoid bunches with flower drop and/or yellow leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Place in water treated with a preservative as soon as possible, after stripping any leaves that would be underwater and recutting 2 to 3 cm off each stem. Food Preservative is essential. Ethylene Very sensitive. 170 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nTriteleia Botanical name Triteleia laxa. Common name Queen Fabiola, Brodiaea. What to look for Buy bunches when more than 6 flowers are open per stem and buds are showing a clear purple-blue colour. Avoid bunches with wilted lower flowers and yellow leaves. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Break open bunches and cut 1 to 2 cm off each stem with sharp secateurs, making sure you remove the white stem base. Strip any leaves that would be underwater and wash stems under the tap. Place immediately in cool water treated with a flower preservative. Food Preservative is essential. The preservative will help buds develop and ensure open flowers last. Ethylene Very sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 171\n\nTuberose Botanical name Polianthes tuberosa. Common name Tuberose. What to look for Buy bunches when 2 to 4 of the lower florets per stem are open. Check for scent—strong scent is a good sign of freshness. Avoid stems with wilted lower florets, browning of petal margins or floppy tips or stems— these are signs of ageing. Temperature 4 to 8° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems. Remove all leaves that will be underwater and place in warm water for up to 2 hours to open buds. Food Preservative is essential. Failure of buds to open can be a problem in Tuberose and preservative will help minimise this problem. Ethylene Very sensitive. Extra tips Some florists recommend removal of the top bud to reduce curvature and promote even opening of flowers. Remove wilted lower florets as they produce ethylene, which will affect the rest of the bunch. 172 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nTulip Botanical name Tulipa hybrids. Common name Tulip, Parrot Tulip, Darwin Tulip. What to look for Buy bunches where flowers are not fully open, but the buds are fully developed and well-coloured (half colour, half green). This is dependent on variety— some white and pale yellow varieties can be bought when buds are still green and will develop fully. Stems must be strong enough to hold the flower-head upright. Foliage must be glossy and green, not blotchy (fungal disease), striped (virus), or yellowing (old). Tulips are quite tolerant of a little mud in the water. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Keep cool at all times. Water Strip any leaves that would be underwater, then wash mud off the lower stems under the tap. Recut 2 cm off each stem and place in cold water containing chlorine. Be sure to remove as much of the white portion of the stem as is practical to improve water uptake. Food No preservative. The sugar in preservatives results in stem stretching, causing flowers to flop over. Use cold water with 30 ppm chlorine. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips Tulip stems continue to grow towards the light, which can result in twisted stems. To straighten bent stems, wrap bunches firmly in dampened tissue paper then newspaper, place in clean cold water and leave in a cool spot for a few hours. Do not mix with freshly cut Narcissus. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 173\n\nUmbrella Fern Botanical name Sticheris flabellatus. Common name Umbrella Fern. What to look for Buy fully open fronds. Check for tears and creases on fronds and avoid damaged branches. Fronds should be fresh and have an even green colour with no sign of wilting. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 to 3 cm off each stem and place in cold water treated with chlorine. Food Preservative is not needed. Ethylene Not sensitive. 174 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nVallota Lily Botanical name Vallota speciosa. Common name Vallota Lily, George Lily. What to look for Buy when flowers are in bud, but fully coloured (red), or when halfopen. Temperature 4 to 8° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Food Preservative is essential. It will help buds come out and maintain open flowers. Ethylene Not sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 175\n\nVeronica Botanical name Veronica virginica, V. spicata. Common name Veronica, Speedwell. What to look for Buy when about a third to a half of the flowers on the spike are open. Bunches with fully open spikes will not last as long as those with halfopen spikes. Leaves should have no sign of yellowing. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Break open bunches, recut 2 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Wash stems under the tap, then place in cold water. Food Preservative is essential. It will help maintain open flowers. Ethylene Very sensitive. 176 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nVerticordia Botanical name Verticordia species V. nitens (yellow), V. grandis (red), V. grandiflora (white). Common name Feather Flower, Yellow Morrison (V. nitens). What to look for Choose bunches with fresh leaves as leaves often dry and drop before the flowers. Verticordia is very susceptible to fungal infection—do not buy bunches with the characteristic ‘spider-web’ caused by Botrytis. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Separate bunches, recut 2 cm off stems with sharp secateurs and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Food Preservative is recommended. Ethylene Very sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 177\n\nViolet Botanical name Viola odorata. Common name Violet. What to look for Buy when flowers are open with flat petals. Leaves should be fresh and green; avoid bunches whose leaves are yellow or marked with blotches. Check for scent as this is a sign of freshness. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Violet bunches are very short, so trim only 1 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Place in cold water immediately. Food Preservative is essential. It will help maintain open flowers. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips Misting or dunking violet bunches underwater is recommended, provided the water is clean. This is best done by adding a small amount of chlorine (about 10 ppm), as this will prevent transmission of fungal diseases. 178 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nWallflower Botanical name Cheiranthus cheiri. Common name Wallflower. What to look for Buy when flowers are fully open. Check bunches for broken stems. Leaves should show no sign of yellowing. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Break open bunches and recut 2 cm off stems and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Wash stems under the tap, then place in cold water. Food Preservative is essential. It will help maintain open flowers. Ethylene Not sensitive. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 179\n\nWaratah Botanical name Telopea speciosissima. Common name Waratah. What to look for Waratahs are composite flowers comprising up to 300 individual florets surrounded by coloured bracts. Early in the season, choose flowers with a few (up to 5%) of the florets open. Later on, choose flowers with up to a half of the florets open. A rule of thumb is to choose flowers with the least number of flowers open, as long as some are open. Flowers with over half of the florets open won’t last as long. Avoid flowers with a blue tinge, as this is a sign of ageing and ethylene damage. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems with sharp secateurs, and strip any leaves that would be underwater. Food Don’t use a commercial preservative. Place in cold water with 30 ppm chlorine. The sugar contained in preservatives causes excessive nectar production which can lead to problems with wasps and fungal diseases. Ethylene Very sensitive. Extra tips Take precautions against ethylene Waratahs are very sensitive to ethylene but STS treatment does not appear to protect them. 180 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nZantedeschia Botanical name Zantedeschia species Z. elliottiana (Golden Calla), Z. rehmannii (Pink Calla), Z. aethiopica (Arum). Common name Calla Lily, Arum Lily, Green Goddess. What to look for Buy flowers that are completely open, when the large fused petal (spathe) has unrolled and just before it has begun to turn downwards. Look for unmarked blooms—Callas are prone to creases and cuts as opened flowers are easily damaged. Avoid stems where the ends are split and curling upwards. Temperature 4 to 8° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems. Food Preservative is optional. Use cold water with 30 ppm chlorine as an alternative. Ethylene Not sensitive. Extra tips To straighten stems, suspend flowers from the neck with chicken wire and allow to stand in cold water overnight. A TO Z CARE GUIDE | 181\n\n182 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS Zinnia Botanical name Zinnia elegans. Common name Zinnia, Youth and Age. What to look for Buy bunches that have fully open flowers with tight centres. Avoid flowers where the centres are full of yellow pollen as they are old. Temperature 1 to 4° C. Water Recut 2 cm off stems. Strip leaves that will be underwater. Replenish water daily. Food Preservative. Ethylene Not sensitive.\n\nGlossary abscise: To fall off. This term is normally used to describe premature loss of leaves or flowers. acidifier: A substance that lowers the pH below 7.0 or makes water more acid. Acidifiers help prevent plugging and reduce microbial growth. Examples are vinegar, citric acid and alum (aluminium sulphate). Ideally, vase water should have a pH of between 3.0 and 4.0. Acidifiers are particularly beneficial for woody-stemmed flowers, including Roses. air emboli: Bubbles of air that are drawn up the base of the flower stem after cutting, which effectively slow water uptake. They are usually located in the bottom 2 to 3 cm of the stem and do not move further up. alkaline: Opposite to acid, where the pH is above 7.0. Some tap water supplies are very alkaline (known as hard water), which may mean that some floral preservatives do not work as expected. alum: Aluminium sulphate. This is especially useful for Roses as an acidifier at a concentration of 50 ppm (0.05–0.01 g per litre or 1–2 teaspoons per 100 L). Alum acts by forming flocculent aluminium hydroxide, which traps particles in water and also lowers the pH. ambient temperature: Room or surrounding air temperature. bent neck: Rose flowers flop over just under the flower-head. This often happens with Roses during summer. There are usually three reasons for this • the Rose is picked too early, before the top of the stem has developed enough woody tissue (lignin) to support the bloom; • an embolism has prevented water uptake; • microbes have plugged the stem. Bent neck can be overcome by • purchasing Roses that are slightly more open; • recutting underwater; • using an acidifier (alum) to bring vase water to a pH of 3.5; • using tepid water, about 40° C.\n\nbiocide/germicide: A chemical that kills micro-organisms that pollute water. Biocides used by flower growers and florists include • chlorine, as sodium hypochlorite in household bleach; • SDIC (Sodium dichloro-isocyancurate), a slow-release swimming pool chlorine; • bromine (BCDMH) found as spa cleaning powders and solutions. Caution Sodium hypochlorite is highly corrosive and may irritate the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Take care to keep chlorine away from sulphur and glycerine as these may explode if in contact, even in small quantities. Botrytis: This fungus (Botrytis cinerea) is also known as ‘grey mould’. Its development is favoured by cool, still, humid environments and it usually attacks already-damaged petals and foliage. It is a common problem on Waxflower and Roses. bracts: Modified leaves at the base of true flowers. They are usually green but can be brightly coloured. In Poinsettias, for example, they are the bright red ‘flower’, and they constitute the outer coloured parts of Proteas. calyx: The outer whorl of flowers, composed of separate or united sepals (individual units of the calyx). chlorosis: Yellowing of leaves or flowers, especially common in Alstroemeria and Lilies. Yellowing has been shown to relate to changes in plant hormone levels. cleats: Rigid bars (foam or newspaper covered) put across a flower box to prevent any longitudinal movement of flowers during transport. The heads of the flowers are packed so that they are kept from touching the end of the box. To secure cleats, they are often stapled to the side of the box. condensation: When warm, moisture-laden air hits something cool, water droplets form on the cooler surface. Therefore, after removing flowers from a coolroom it is helpful to place a plastic barrier over the flowers until they reach room temperature. This will result in condensation on the plastic instead of on the flowers and reduce fungal infection. To prevent condensation, it is also vital that the outside walls of the coolroom are well sealed; otherwise warm air passes through the outside, hits the inner wall of the coolroom (near the insulation) and then condenses, causing rusting. 184 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nconditioning: See rehydrating. cultivar: Botanical name for horticultural variety or race that has originated and persisted under cultivation. dehydration: Drying out. This usually happens to petals. Because they are so thin, it is easy for them to lose water, especially if placed in direct sunlight, draughts, near heat sources, or in air-conditioned or heated environments. Sleeving by florists is an important means of preventing dehydration. Placing sheets of plastic over buckets of flowers in the coolroom also helps prevent dehydration. disbud: The upper-most flower that develops after all competing side buds are removed by hand. Pompom Chrysanthemums are disbuds. dry storage: This is the best treatment for long-term cool storage of some flowers. Flowers are cooled, pretreated and dipped in a fungicide to prevent Botrytis attack in storage. They are then wrapped, first in paper and then plastic, to prevent drying out and stored as close to 0° C as possible. After storage, flowers are recut and rehydrated. This is most commonly done by growers with Roses prior to Valentine’s Day, Chrysanthemums prior to Mothers’ Day and Christmas Lilies leading up to Christmas. It is not recommended for florists. ethylene: Naturally produced gas that causes premature ageing of many flowers, flower and leaf drop, yellowing of leaves, failure of some buds to develop, and epinasty (increased leaf angle to stem). Produced by ripening and rotting fruit, ageing and wilting flowers, cigarette smoke and car exhaust. growth tropisms: Growth in response to environmental stimuli. The most common are • geotropism bending away from gravity—when some spike flowers are laid horizontally they react negatively to gravity and the spike tip bends upwards e.g. Gladioli and Snapdragons. • phototropism bending towards light e.g. Gerberas and Tulips. MCP: 1-Methylcyclopropane. A new gas treatment used by growers to prevent the action of ethylene. Should not be used by florists. mechanical (physical) damage: Bruising or breaking of flowers and foliage. The damage is done by grading machines (lines on Rose petals) GLOSSARY | 185\n\nand during transport. This is often due to flowers being handled with insufficient care when they are too open. Correct packing techniques are, therefore, very important and sleeves are essential to separate and protect bunches. Respiration and ethylene production is higher in mechanically injured plants. microbial plugging: When flower stems are cut they exude substances that are fed on by microbes (bacteria and fungi) attracted from the water or container wall. The microbes proliferate, causing a ‘soup’ of bacteria and fungi to be taken up by the flower stem with water, effectively blocking the fine tubes of the water-conducting vessels (xylem). Bacteria are present on the stem and leaves of all flowers and on the rubbish/slime of vase or bucket walls. Most floral preservatives contain both germicides and acidifiers that inhibit bacterial growth. Sugar alone in water will encourage microbial growth and thus increase stem blockage. necrosis: Death or dying of plant tissue. panicle: Loose, branched flower-head with a large number of flowers e.g. Queen Anne’s Lace. parts per million (ppm): Number of milligrams per litre (mg/L), or millilitres per litre (mL/L), as 1 mL = 1 g. For example 100 ppm = 0.1 g/L or 0.1 mL/L). physiological plugging: As a response to being cut, flower stems often seal over to prevent invasion by harmful microbes, similar to the way a cut forms a scab on human skin. This can effectively prevent the stem taking up water and is often overcome by acidifying the solution. preservative (or holding) solution: Flower preservative, usually containing sugar, a germicide and an acidifier. pulsing solution: Used on freshly harvested flowers that are in bud where a short period or ‘pulse’ in a high sugar solution will extend vase life or open buds. • Recipes vary for different species, even different cultivars. • Sugar is the main ingredient and some growers use STS to reduce ethylene sensitivity. • Pulsing can be applied for short periods at warm temperatures, or longer periods (up to 48 hours) at low temperatures. • Light is essential. 186 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\n• A germicide must always be used if sugar is present in the solution. • If sugar concentration is too high there may be damage, particularly to the foliage of Roses. rehydrating (conditioning, hardening): Rehydrating is used to restore turgidity (firmness) to cut flowers. • Rehydrating solutions contain good quality water plus a germicide and an acidifier. A wetting agent can also be added at a concentration of 0.1–0.01%. • No sugar is used. • Citric acid or vinegar is often used to acidify the solution to a pH of 3.2–3.5. • A germicide is essential. • Rehydrating can be done in the coolroom as flowers take up as much water in a coolroom as at ambient temperature. relative humidity (%RH): The amount of water present as water vapour in the atmosphere. Most cut flowers, especially tropicals, prefer to be kept at a high relative humidity (90–95%). Humidity can be raised by wetting the floor of the coolroom, misting blooms, using plastic sleeves, or placing plastic sheets over flowers. respiration: A metabolic process in plants that uses food (sugars) and oxygen to generate energy and heat. Usually occurs at night. If flowers are kept above about 4° C they respire faster, which creates more internal heat, further increasing respiration. scalding: A treatment conducted by growers after harvest on flowers that contain a milky sap e.g. Poppies and Helleborus. The lower 3 to 4 cm of cut stem ends are scalded in boiling water for a few seconds. A similar treatment is searing, or burning, where the stem ends are seared over a naked flame. SDIC: Sodium dichloroisocyanurate—granulated form of chlorine used as floral preservative and also found in slow-release swimming pool chlorine products. It is a more stabilised form of chlorine than bleach and remains active for longer than solutions made from sodium hypochlorite. Also known as DICA. senescence: Ageing process in plants. Bud opening and the formation of colour is development, whereas flower wilting and leaf yellowing is senescence. GLOSSARY | 187\n\nsleeving: Clear polyethylene plastic envelopes for flowers. Sleeving is used for: • keeping a high relative humidity around the bunch; • preventing tangling between bunches e.g. Gypsophila, Gloriosa Lily; • protecting bunches from mechanical damage. spadix: The spike of certain flowers surrounded by the spathe e.g. in Anthuriums the true flowers are contained on the centre spadix. spathe: Broad bract or fused petal that surrounds the spadix e.g. in Anthuriums and Callas. spike: Long unbranched flower-head with a large number of florets. Florets usually open from the bottom up e.g. Gladiolus. spray: Composite head of flowers where all flowers are of even size after the main bud has been removed e.g. spray Carnations and Chrysanthemums. STS: Silver thiosulphate solution. Used by growers to prevent the action of ethylene. Should not be used by florists. sucrose: Energy (carbohydrate) source for flowers. Household sugar is sucrose. thermometer: To monitor the temperature, keep a maximum/minimum thermometer in the centre of the coolroom away from the fan. A thermometer based at the back of your van may also yield interesting information, especially if the exhaust pipe is directly under the floor. transpiration: The process in plants, similar to perspiration in humans. It is the loss of water from flowers and leaves to the atmosphere. Transpiration rates and water demands increase with rising temperature, with the result that the stem sometimes cannot take up water fast enough to replace what has been lost. This results in wilting. turgid: Fully hydrated i.e. not wilted at all. water soaking: Wet or translucent areas on petals or leaves, which often indicates chilling injury in tropical flowers; if the effect is severe then the leaves and petals collapse and dry out. 188 | CARING FOR CUT FLOWERS\n\nReferences The following references have been used in the preparation of this book.
