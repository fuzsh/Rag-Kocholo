        "text": "Dear Carol:\n\nI have some yellow calla lilies that came up in our front yard where we have roses planted. This is the second year they appeared. They are bigger and more prolific than last year. One of them is 48 inches tall.\n\nA few years ago we planted some calla lilies in pots for the summer, two different colors. They blossomed but were only about 12 inches high. We believe these in the front yard (and there is one growing in the backyard) came from our compost soil. Are calla lilies perennials in this area? -- D.L., N. Syracuse.\n\nDear D.L.: Your yellow-flowered callas with the white spotted leaves are the species Zantedeschia elliottiana, the golden arum lily. It isn't any kind of lily, of course, being in the arum family and related to jack-in-the-pulpit, canna, caladium and others with the typical spathe and spadix flowers.\n\nThere are eight or so species in the genus Zantedeschia, and many hybrids. The plants grow from rhizomes, thick, lumpy, underground stems that produce both roots and shoots. Most are summer blooming and winter dormant. The rhizomes need to be dry in winter and will rot quickly in cold wet soil.\n\nThe species and hybrids vary in winter hardiness. Their northern limit may be Maryland and southern Pennsylvania. There are always outliers, and I, too, have had them survive the winter in Central New York in spots where the soil was well drained and did not freeze solid.\n\nNormally, callas are left outdoors in the ground or in the containers until the weather gets quite cool, even with light frosts. The leaves will turn yellow. Dig the rhizomes up, brush the soil off and store them clean and dry in a cool dark place for the winter. They can be surprisingly vigorous, and there are likely to be many rhizomes, some blooming size and others that need a few more years.\n\nFor fun, you can leave the white flowered callas with plain green leaves, Z. aethiopica outdoors in a container until late fall. Let it get lightly frosted but don't let the soil freeze hard. The leaves will die off. Then bring it indoors into a well lit place. When new growth appears, water it, and it should flower in early winter.\n\nLast winter was not typical, so some odd things survived. I have a trachelospermum, a jasmine-like, woody vine with swooningly fragrant white flowers. It lived all last winter outside in a large pot. It is normally evergreen where it's hardy, but it lost all its leaves and died back to the ground, and it didn't bloom at all this summer, but still.... It's time to start thinking about overwintering tender plants. The trachelospermum will be under lights in the basement this winter, as I'm not taking any more chances."
