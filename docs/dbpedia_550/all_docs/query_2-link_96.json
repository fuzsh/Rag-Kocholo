When studies tell us that plants can purify the air, lift our mood, and reduce our stress levels, we have every reason to fill our homes with wonderful, happiness-inducing plants of every shape, size, and color. With so many different varieties offered, there is a plant—or twenty—to suit everyone: elegant, blossoming orchids; tiny little cacti and succulents; delicate trailing plants; floor-standing palms and foliage plants … the list goes on and on. It’s hard to resist the urge to simply fill any and every available surface with a random assortment of greenery, but the best houseplant displays are those that go one step further: thoughtful, curated arrangements that can create a mood within a home, be it a cosy little oasis or a dramatic, architectural plant display.\n\n7\n\nAs much as we may want to, we can’t all turn our homes into a full-scale botanical garden. Instead, we need to be a little more inventive. Poor light? Look for unfussy foliage plants, such as cast iron plants or snake plants, that can survive in a shadier spot. No free surface space? Plant up a miniature garden inside a glass terrarium, or go all out and create a hanging garden with macramé planters and kokedama. And, once you’ve designed your plant-filled home, how exactly do you keep the plants in peak condition? With this book, you’ll be able to care for whichever plants you choose, keep them healthy and strong, and take cuttings to share with friends and family (or to grow your own collection). Treat your plants well and, no matter how large or small your collection, you’ll be rewarded with an indoor garden you can enjoy for years to come.\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\n10\n\nTHE ART OF\n\nOn its own, a plant is just a plant. Add another and it becomes a display. But what distinguishes a random selection of plants from a piece of design that can engage the eye and evoke the mood of your living space? The answer is to establish a visual connection between your plants using the four design elements below.\n\nSCALE pp.14–17\n\nSHAPE pp.18–21\n\nUse size and proportion to create a display. Choose same-sized plants for balance and symmetry, or use plants of different sizes to draw the eye and create flow and movement.\n\nChoosing plants with similar shapes can create beautiful, natural patterns, while contrasting shapes can be used to sculpt displays with a sense of drama.\n\nTHE ART OF HOUSEPLANT DESIGN\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nHOUSEPLANT DESIGN\n\n11\n\n“ Think of your design\n\nfrom every angle, as if it is a three-dimensional piece of living sculpture.”\n\nCOLOR\n\npp.22–25\n\nColor interacts with color in a way that color in isolation does not. Use that interplay to find soft, harmonious shades or build a more energetic, contrasting palette.\n\nTEXTURE\n\npp.26–29\n\nA plant’s texture can have visual as well as tactile appeal, as it determines how the foliage interacts with the light. Mix and match different textures to add depth to a display.\n\n12\n\nTHE RULES OF\n\nTHE RULES OF HOUSEPLANT DESIGN\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nHOUSEPLANT DESIGN How you choose to design your houseplant collection depends on your personal style, imagination, and the space you have available. With so many variables, the possibilities are almost endless. But for your displays to be successful, follow these key principles.\n\n1\n\nCARE COMES BEFORE STYLE\n\nA healthy plant is a beautiful plant. When designing for a particular space, always choose plants that you know will thrive in the light, temperature, and humidity conditions provided by that space. There is no point in taking the time to arrange the perfect display, only to watch the plants within it begin to wilt and die because they are unhappy in their location.\n\n2\n\nTHINK NATURAL\n\nBe inspired by nature. Consider where and how a plant would grow in the wild, and try to emulate that in your display. So if a plant thrives on a damp, semishaded forest floor, provide it with a position that offers a similar environment. If it trails from high branches, place it in a hanging container. If it grows aerial roots without soil, build that into your display. Whatever its natural circumstances, use them as inspiration.\n\n13\n\n3\n\nHARMONY AND CONTRAST\n\nStrike a balance between harmonious and contrasting design features. Familiarize yourself with the four key elements of design (see pp.10–11), and harmonize or contrast them as needed to achieve the effect you want. Harmony can create a balanced, unified appearance, while contrast will add interest and dynamism to a display.\n\n14\n\nHARMONY OF SCALE\n\nUNDERSTANDING\n\nDESIGNING WITH SCALE\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nSCALE\n\nTo put it simply, scale refers to the relative size and proportion of objects. A plant may be large or small, but its relationship with neighboring plants or objects is what defines its scale. Proportion is key to any successful design: a tiny cactus and a weeping fig, for example, would be totally out of scale and proportion with each other. Get the scale right, and you can create interesting relationships between the plants in your display.\n\nWHAT IS SCALE? Scale describes your plants' sizes in comparison with one another. It is closely related to proportion, which describes the size of your plants within an overall display. Plants of a similar size are harmonious in scale, while those of different heights contrast in scale. Scale is relative: any two plants can share the same contrast of scale, provided that they maintain the same proportions. Scale describes the size of two objects in relation to one another\n\nHarmony of scale\n\nContrast of scale\n\nChoosing and grouping together plants of uniform or nearly uniform scale results in a classic, highly ordered display. Repetition of scale and proportion creates a harmonious pattern and offers a sense of unity and simplicity. Harmony can become dull if the repetition is overdone, but in moderation it offers a sense of order and rhythm.\n\n15\n\n“ How do your\n\nhouseplants measure up against one another?” CONTRAST OF SCALE Fiddle-leaf figs\n\nWhen plants are in proportion but of different scales, the eye is led from one to the other and the relationship is less static, and more dynamic, than that of a harmonious display. There is a sense of movement, going from small up to large, drawing the eye to a focal point in the grouping but maintaining proportion so that the relationship isn't broken.\n\nGolden ball cacti\n\n16\n\nDESIGNING WITH HARMONY OF SCALE\n\nDESIGNING WITH SCALE\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nHarmony can reinforce pattern, so use plants of the same scale to echo and exaggerate existing patterns within your living space, such as the symmetry of a windowsill or the staggered surface of a flight of stairs. Maintaining the same scale across a display while varying other design elements creates a harmonious pattern that unites your plants.\n\n“ Keep the scale of\n\nyour plant display in proportion with your space to create equilibrium.”\n\nDESIGNING WITH\n\nSCALE\n\nWhat effect do you wish to create in your space? Do you want a formal pattern of repetition and harmony, or an informal, eye-catching arrangement that creates contrast and movement? You can lead the eye up or down, screen or define a space, or instantly introduce formality or informality simply with the proportion of your plant choices.\n\n1 The uniform scale of these three kentia palms allows the display to echo the outline of the steps. 2 This cluster of three very different trailing plants is given cohesion by its harmony of scale (left to right: donkey’s tail, string of pearls, and mistletoe cactus).\n\nDESIGNING WITH CONTRAST OF SCALE Grouping plants of different sizes offers a chance to manipulate the eye and generate a sense of movement. Perhaps you want to sweep along a windowsill or table, or conjure an impression of height, or lead the eye into a particular space. Use contrast of scale to create a sight line between your plants and draw attention to a focal point within your grouping. 1 A sequence of ever-larger bromeliads creates a line of visual interest along a windowsill, with a smaller one at the end just to playfully challenge the order. 2 The extreme contrast of scale between the little missionary plant and the imposing Swiss cheese plant is given cohesion by the midsized fiddle-leaf fig, which unifies and balances the display.\n\n17\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n18\n\nHARMONY OF SHAPE A row of the same plant varieties, or of plants that have a similar shape, creates a harmonious pattern. The repetition of shape provides a sense of order and symmetry. No one plant may dominate, so the overall effect is of unity and simplicity, with all plants in the group having a similar visual weight.\n\nUNDERSTANDING SHAPE\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nUNDERSTANDING\n\nSHAPE\n\nWhile every plant has its own particular growth habit, most will conform to a range of shapes that you can use to sculpt an overall line or outline for your display. Depending on how you arrange them, you can create a variety of effects, from a dynamic sweep to an ordered, symmetrical pattern.\n\nWHAT IS SHAPE? Every houseplant is unique, shaped as much by its environment as by its natural form, and no two plants will ever share an identical outline. Nevertheless, certain shapes tend to occur regularly throughout a range of houseplant types. Use these as a starting point when identifying your plant's outline.\n\nRosetteshaped Tall, architectural, jagged\n\nTrailing Domed, round\n\nUnstructured, wild\n\nTall, architectural pencil cactus\n\n19\n\nCONTRAST OF SHAPE Using a variety of shapes creates a sense of movement and draws the attention along the display. Diverse shapes can be used to create a sense of adventure and tension, with the visual weight being carried across the group according to how the shapes of the different plants interact.\n\nTall, architectural variegated snake plant\n\nTall, architectural aloe vera\n\nTrailing mistletoe cactus\n\n20\n\nDESIGNING WITH SHAPE\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nDESIGNING WITH HARMONY OF SHAPE\n\n“ Reposition your plants a few times until you’re happy that they create a natural, flowing movement within the display.”\n\nRepetition of shape across a symmetrical design creates a sense of impact and order. Use plants with strong, clean outlines, such as tall or domed shapes, and limit the display to just one or two plant varieties to establish a sense of order and control.\n\nDESIGNING WITH\n\nSHAPE\n\nUse the shapes of your plants to construct and sculpt a display that offers real visual impact in your living space. Establish patterns by repeating one or two strong shape types, or sculpt a unique outline from plants with distinct forms that will carry the eye through the design. To keep your displays controlled, prune them back regularly into shape (see pp.194–95).\n\n1\n\n2\n\n21\n\n1 These variegated snake plants and aloes share the same tall, architectural shape, creating a strong, symmetrical display. 2 Despite contrast of color, the matching forms of these begonias unify the display. 3 The repeated domes of baby’s tears plants draw the eye along the table.\n\nDESIGNING WITH CONTRAST OF SHAPE An asymmetrical display built from multiple shape types can be used to redefine a space. Use different plants’ unique visual features to create a flowing, organic design, but keep it controlled; the outline should lead the eye across the display without any obvious, irregular gaps that could break the flow. 1 The central cluster of mini succulents nestled within the larger trio builds into a varied but strongly united grouping. 2 The contrasting forms of the tall Swiss cheese plant and trailing golden pothos create a flowing, asymmetrical design bound together by the midsized plants in the group.\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n22\n\nUNDERSTANDING\n\nUNDERSTANDING COLOR\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nCOLOR\n\nWithin Nature there are many different colors, shades, and tones for you to work with. Colors have emotional properties, too: greens, the predominant color of plant design, are restful and reassuring; reds and oranges suggest warmth and energy; white evokes purity and calm. Use them to set the mood for your space.\n\nWHAT IS COLOR? Colors in isolation behave differently from colors in combination, and the color wheel shows how those relationships work. In between the primary colors of red, blue, and yellow lie all the shades they make in combination (so, for example, green sits between blue and yellow, which combine to make green). Toward the center are progressively lighter tints, while as the circle progresses outward, the shades get darker.\n\nThe color wheel shows all colors, along with their hues, tints, tones, and shades.\n\nAdjacent colors work in harmony, as they share the same range of hues and tones.\n\nyellow-greens\n\nOpposing colors on the wheel can create contrast and vibrancy.\n\nblue-greens\n\nblue-purples\n\nHARMONY OF COLOR Restricting your palette to different shades of the same color creates a sense of order and control. Limiting an arrangement to such a narrow section of the color wheel can also provide an air of calm and tranquility. Mixing in colors that lie adjacent on the color wheel, such as soft blues or gentle yellows, changes the rhythm but doesn’t unbalance the overall equilibrium. The colors still harmonize and blend with each other, maintaining the simplicity.\n\n23\n\nCONTRAST OF COLOR Using colors from opposite sides of the color wheel, such as red and green or yellow and purple, instantly adds energy to a display. For a more subtle effect, try working with three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel (green, orange, and purple, for instance); while still contrasting, the palette is not as high-energy as a two-color, directly opposing contrast would be.\n\n“Nature offers a wonderful\n\nvariety of colors from which you can create your own artist’s palette.”\n\n24\n\nDESIGNING WITH COLOR\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\n2\n\n1\n\nDESIGNING WITH\n\nCOLOR\n\nColor evokes emotion, so design your display according to the mood you want to create. For a sense of serenity, try greens and whites; for a vibrant display, incorporate fiery oranges and reds. Cool colors can also impart a sense of space, while warm colors may suggest cosiness.\n\n3\n\nDESIGNING WITH HARMONY OF COLOR For a calm, ordered arrangement, plants need to blend gently with one another color-wise. A strict color palette of greens is refined, but you may need to vary other elements to avoid a dull display. Broadening your palette to adjacent colors allows a wider range of moods to be conjured, while retaining serenity and order. Cool hues generally suggest a sense of space. 1 A palette of purple flowers and foliage harmonizes this group of different plants, setting a gentle yet welcoming mood. 2 This little succulent display creates a muted range of greens, from the red-green Kalanchoe to the white-speckled haworthia. 3 The rattlesnake plant’s variegated green leaves (left) offer some interest when paired with the fiddle-leaf fig behind it.\n\n25\n\n“ Color is a powerful tool\n\nfor influencing the senses and creating a particular atmosphere or mood.” 2\n\n3\n\nDESIGNING WITH CONTRAST OF COLOR Warm colors can make spaces appear more intimate. As they contrast directly with green, they also add drama to a plant display. Use them to draw the eye in to your display, or to create bold, vibrant relationships between your plants. 1 The vivid orange moth orchid picks up on the terracotta pots and stands out as the focal point in the display. 2 Make an air plant display pop with a few red-colored varieties.\n\n1\n\n3 Pinks and greens contrast in this delicate yet colorful design.\n\n26\n\nHARMONY OF TEXTURE\n\nUNDERSTANDING TEXTURE\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nUNDERSTANDING\n\nWhen similar-textured plants are grouped together, the quality of light and shadow across their foliage is consistent, creating a relationship between the plants despite any other visual differences, such as color or size. This relationship unifies the display, creating a balanced whole and imparting a sense of simplicity.\n\nTEXTURE\n\nWhile it can be a subtle design feature, texture offers a vital sensory element in a display. A plant’s surface type determines how it interacts with light and shadow, which gives it a unique presence: for example, velvety leaves have a soft, matte appearance, while smooth, glossy foliage presents a crisp, bright, clean-cut image.\n\nMistletoe cactus\n\nWHAT IS TEXTURE? Texture describes a plant’s foliage and the effect it creates when interacting with light and shadow. While it adds a seemingly tactile dimension, texture should primarily remain a visual design element: some plants, like the bunny ears cactus, may look soft, but you would not want to touch those fine spikes.\n\nVelvety, matte\n\nFeathery\n\n“ Texture adds another Plump, fleshy\n\nSmooth, glossy\n\nSpiky, rough\n\ndimension to your display through the visual qualities of the plant’s leaves.”\n\n27\n\nBunny ears cactus\n\nBaby’s tears Donkey’s tail\n\nCONTRAST OF TEXTURE Strong textural contrasts create drama and interest. The greater the contrast, the greater the emphasis on each plant’s individual presence: the clean, crisp foliage of a glossy-leaved plant versus the wild, informal appearance of feathered leaves, for instance, or a succulent’s plump, fleshy leaves versus the spiky prickles of a cactus.\n\n28\n\nDESIGNING WITH TEXTURE\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nDESIGNING WITH HARMONY OF TEXTURE\n\n“ Light, feathery foliage carries less visual weight than denser, solid-leaved plants, so use more in a display if you want the different textures to appear balanced.”\n\nDESIGNING WITH\n\nTEXTURE\n\nTexture is the key to evoking mood in a display. Velvety, smooth, feathery, spiky: your choice of textures will set the tone for your arrangement and the mood of the space your plants will occupy. How you then reinforce that texture through harmony, or contrast it with a different texture, gives your design its focus and emphasis.\n\nWhen a group of plants interact with light in the same way—absorbing or reflecting it, offering similar textural patterns of light and dark—there is a unity achieved that brings the composition together as a whole. A thoughtful combination of similar textures offset by other contrasting elements creates interest, although too much repetition creates monotony. 1 Pairing the structurally different, but equally glossy, ZZ plant (left) and radiator plant (right) builds a strong relationship that is reinforced by similarly glossy containers. 2 The Myrtillocactus (left) and rat tail cactus (right) contrast in almost every regard, but their matching spiky textures offers a point of harmony. 3 A seemingly random sprawling group of air plants is given unity by the similarity of their textures. 4 Texture can harmonize a contrasting color palette, linking the two purple velvet plants with the Echeveria (left) and Kalanchoe (right).\n\nDESIGNING WITH CONTRAST OF TEXTURE Bringing diverse textures together builds excitement and tension, as each texture brings a different mood to the display. The relationship between the different textures needs to be carefully balanced, however, in order not to simply suggest chaos. The light and shadow should work across the design in such a way that the eye is drawn to the contrasts but can also see the rhythm in them. 1 Fleshy, plump succulents contrast interestingly with the pretty fronds of moss; the voluptuousness of the succulents is accentuated by the delicacy of the carpet and reindeer mosses. 2 The dominant, rougher texture of the blue star fern’s velvety leaves is sandwiched between the softer, more elegant Boston fern (left) and the fine foliage of the delta maidenhair fern (right).\n\n29\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n30\n\nUNDERSTANDING\n\nAn integral part of any houseplant arrangement is the choice of pots. While neutral containers can offer a unifying backdrop for your plants, a bold container choice that emphasizes one or more design elements can become a focal point in itself, emphasizing your plants’ best features and tying them in with the surrounding environment.\n\nSCALE\n\nSHAPE\n\nContainers that play with scale and proportion can change the relationship between identical plants, while matching containers of the same scale can unify a group of different plants.\n\nA container's shape can harmonize or contrast with your plant's growing habit. It can echo and accentuate the natural shape of the plant, or contrast with it to create interest or drama.\n\nUNDERSTANDING CONTAINERS\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nCONTAINERS\n\n31\n\n“ Like the accessories that\n\ntie together your favorite outfit, containers add those all-important finishing touches to your houseplant design.” COLOR\n\nTEXTURE\n\nColors and patterns on a container can be used to highlight features in your plant. Stripes can echo stripes and color can pick up on color, highlighting what may have been a subtle accent on a plant.\n\nThe surface of your container can complement the texture of your plant's foliage, or directly contrast with it, in order to play on the differences and the sensory interest of the display.\n\n32\n\n“ For an eye-catching\n\nDESIGNING WITH CONTAINERS\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\ndisplay, hunt out interesting and unusual containers in vintage stores.”\n\nDESIGNING WITH\n\nCONTAINERS Be adventurous with your container choice. Almost anything can be used as a container or cachepot: as well as regular pots and terrariums, try repurposing old household items for a conversation-starting display.\n\n1 This rustic white tray harmonizes with the dusty appearance of the air plants it displays. 2 A glass terrarium can display an entire miniature garden, allowing it to be admired from every angle. 3 These glass baubles act as tiny hanging terrariums for the ferns and trailing plants within. 4 Try planting spring bulbs in glass jars to show off their root systems as they grow. 5 Add drainage holes to the base of a clean food can to create a statement cacti container. 6 A vintage jug makes a curious decorative cachepot for an orchid. 7 Wall-mounted containers turn these two staghorn ferns into living pieces of art. 8 These classic, modern containers directly contrast with the appearance of the echeverias.\n\n1\n\n33\n\n2\n\n5\n\n7\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nDESIGNING WITH CONTAINERS\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\n34\n\nUse your imagination With a little creative thinking, almost anything can be used for a display. This mismatched collection of glasses harmonizes with the succulents’ foliage colors, and even shows off their soil and roots.\n\n35\n\n36\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nDESIGNING FOR BRIGHT LIGHT\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nBRIGHT LIGHT\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to have lots of bright light in your home (see pp.180–81), take advantage of the possibilities by designing stunning displays of sun-loving plants. Fill up an empty window from top to bottom with lush greenery, or create a hanging garden beneath a skylight. Just remember to make sure your chosen plants can cope with the level of sunlight they are exposed to (see Plant Profiles, pp.100–75).\n\n1\n\n1 Combine a mixture of sun-loving plants of different sizes and shapes to create a windowsill display that makes the most of the bright light levels. 2 Propagated cuttings (see pp.96–99) make a pretty and practical display in a bright area out of direct sun. 3 Hang vanda orchids (see p.115) in front of a window to show off their roots, which can be displayed without potting soil. 4 In the wild, many orchids trail from high tree branches. Echo that by hanging them beneath a skylight, out of direct sun. 5 This colorful, multilevel orchid display fills a small window with blooms. 6 A hanging herb planter makes practical use of a kitchen window.\n\n4\n\n37\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n38\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nDESIGNING FOR LOW LIGHT\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nLOW LIGHT Don’t despair if your home does not receive a lot of bright daylight. Many plants prefer bright indirect light, and some can even thrive in areas of medium light (see pp.180–81), since many of them would naturally grow in the low light beneath a forest canopy. Use this as inspiration when designing for low light, adding touches of lush greenery to evoke a woodland landscape in your living space.\n\n1 Large, glossy-leaved foliage and climbing plants trained up walls bring a touch of the jungle to an urban home. 2 Orchids that would naturally grow under dense forest canopies, such as this moth orchid, are well-suited to low light. 3 This small display of woodland plants will thrive in bright indirect light/medium light (L–R: blue star fern, baby’s tears, Cretan brake fern). 4 Keep a bowl of wet pebbles near a collection of lush feathery forest ferns to keep them looking hydrated and fresh (L–R: crocodile fern, Boston fern). 5 Add flashes of color to a low-light display by using flowering plants and variegated leaves (such as those of a polka dot begonia, center).\n\n1\n\n39\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nDESIGNING FOR HUMIDITY\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\n40\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nHUMIDITY\n\nMost moisture-loving plants need regular watering and care, but what if you could display them in a ready-made humid space in which they could thrive? Use humidity to your advantage and be adventurous in your designs: dare to turn a kitchen into a jungle, or take over the bathroom with ambitious living walls and displays, where the steam will naturally mist humidity-lovers like ferns, bromeliads, and air plants.\n\n1\n\n1 Contrast the bright foliage of a bathroom bromeliad display with the addition of a humidity-loving Amazonian elephant’s ear. 2 Assemble a kokedama string garden (see pp.76–79) in humid areas of your home (L–R: Boston fern, spider plant, Cretan brake fern). 3 A trailing rosary vine adds a touch of atmosphere to a bathroom counter. 4 Use a humid spot to keep feathery foliage lush and fresh (L–R: baby’s tears, Delta maidenhair fern, and string of pearls). 5 Since air plants draw moisture from the air, display them in a humid room in a wire frame or on a stand (see pp.56–59). 6 Carnivorous plants love moist, too-wet environments, so will thrive in a humid space.\n\n4\n\n41\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n42\n\nDESIGNING FOR SPACE\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nSPACE\n\nAny living space, large or small, offers plenty of opportunities to get creative with houseplant design. If you have no free surfaces, create a colony of hanging plants above your head. If you have bare walls, swap artwork for architectural displays of plant-filled shelves. With a little imagination, you will find more and more ways to turn any space into an indoor oasis. 1\n\n1 If you want to hang nontrailing plants from the ceiling, use decorative containers that will look attractive from below. Hang climbing plants from rafters, if your home has them, to allow the foliage to grow up and along the beams. 2 Climbing plants aren’t just for the garden; you can also train them to indoor walls to fill an empty space. 3 Fill a tall set of shelves with a curated selection of plants to create your own “green library.” 4 Assemble a lush collection of hanging plants to create a “living curtain” of foliage. 5 Create a miniature garden in a tiny space using a terrarium (see pp.64–67 and pp.84–87). Display it at eye level, where the details can be closely admired. 6 Almost any space is up for grabs when designing plant displays. A staircase, for example, shows off your plants at eye level and from above as you walk down.\n\n4\n\n43\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n44\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nMINDFULNESS\n\nDESIGNING FOR WELL-BEING\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nWELL-BEING There is far more to houseplant design than visual beauty. Plants aren’t just decorative objects: they are capable of lowering our stress levels, filling our homes with fragrance, and even ridding the air we breathe of harmful pollutants (see pp.46–47). Follow the advice on these pages to make the most of these benefits.\n\nModern life doesn’t always offer enough opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors, especially for those of us living in built-up urban environments with little daily access to parks or forests. Studies have shown that living and working in a plant-filled environment can noticeably boost mental well-being (see below left). By adding touches of greenery throughout your home, especially in the places where you spend the most time, you will create a more calming atmosphere in which you can go about your daily life. In particular, keep plants near any windows that look out onto built-up areas to bring nature into your view. 1 A plant-filled home can provide a psychological boost when access to nature is otherwise limited. For the full effect, create an indoor jungle packed to the rafters with foliage to stimulate your mind and improve your mood.\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nTHE SENSES\n\nFragrant houseplants add an extra sensory dimension to any plant design. We often bring bulbs and other scented plants into our homes during the darkest months of the year to remind ourselves of the sights and smells of spring. Position them in a front hallway for a bright, fragrant welcome, or near a door so that you will catch a hint of fragrance every time you pass. HOW HOUSEPLANTS HELP Multiple studies have shown that there are tangible psychological benefits to keeping plants in indoor spaces such as homes and offices. After spending time living and working alongside plants, those taking part in the studies found that, on average:\n\n1 Nelly Isler (left) and Brassia orchid blooms both provide a burst of scent.\n\n• Their mood levels improved\n\n4 Combine scented and unscented plants to create a larger display without an overwhelming amount of fragrance (L–R: peace lily, scented hoya, scented cyclamen).\n\n• They felt less stressed • They felt more productive • Their attention span improved (in some studies)\n\n2 Stephanotis is a classic plant choice when designing for scent. 3 Thyme bushes release a wonderful fragrance when brushed against in passing.\n\n5 “Force” grape hyacinth bulbs for scent and color during winter (see pp.198–99).\n\n45\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n46\n\nDESIGNING FOR\n\nAIR PURIFICATION\n\nDESIGNING FOR WELL-BEING\n\nDESIGNING WITH HOUSEPLANTS\n\nIn addition to boosting our mood, houseplants can even improve our physical health and well-being by filtering harmful pollutants, including formaldehyde and benzene, from the air inside our homes and offices. These chemicals, which are found in many everyday products— including cosmetics, soft furnishings, and detergents—are released into the atmosphere over time and may build up inside poorly ventilated buildings. This polluted air can, in high-enough quantities, lead to headaches; fatigue; and eye, nose, and throat irritation. Luckily, houseplants can help. Studies have shown that plants are able to filter these pollutants from indoor air by drawing in the chemicals as they respire, leaving the air cleaner and healthier for us to breathe. What better excuse, then, than to fill your home with dozens of air-purifying plants? Madagascar dragon tree Peace lily\n\nChinese evergreen\n\nSpider plant\n\n47\n\nTHE BEST PLANTS FOR AIR PURIFICATION While most plants are able to purify the air to some extent, some varieties are especially effective at removing certain chemicals from the air.

This forest of foliage fills every available space with mood-boosting, air-purifying houseplants.\n\n49\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n52\n\nDESERTSCAPE Grouping your cacti and succulent collection together in a single container is a great way to show off their different characteristics. The container does not have to be deep, as cacti have shallow root systems, but make sure it has adequate drainage; adding a layer of gravel beneath the potting soil will\n\nDESERTSCAPE\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nhelp prevent waterlogging if your container has no drainage holes.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Selection of cacti, succulents, and plants with similar care needs, such as bunny ears cacti, golden ball cacti, and African spears\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Shallow decorative container, preferably with drainage holes • Fine-grade gravel • Activated charcoal • Cactus potting soil • Pebbles and small stones, to decorate\n\nTOOLS • Small tray, for watering • Spoon or small trowel • Dibble • Protective cactus gloves • Small paintbrush, for dusting\n\n53\n\n1\n\nWater the cacti and other plants thoroughly by placing them on a small tray filled with water. This will encourage the roots to make good contact with the new potting soil.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPour a layer of gravel, approximately 1in (2.5cm) deep, into the base of the container. Mix in a few spoonfuls of activated charcoal to prevent the growth of fungi. Top with an even layer of cactus potting soil, 2–4in (5–7.5cm) deep.\n\nDESERTSCAPE\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n54\n\nWhile still in their pots, arrange the plants on top of the potting soil until you are happy with their placement. Allow plenty of room for growth. Once you like the arrangement, remove the plants, remembering where you intend to plant them.\n\nSelect your first plant. Using the dibble, make a hole large enough to accommodate the plant’s root ball. Wearing gloves, remove the plant from its pot and gently tease the roots to release excess soil. Repeat for the remaining plants.\n\n55\n\n5\n\nUsing a spoon, carefully fill in any gaps between the plants with potting soil. Firm the soil down using the back of the spoon or the dibble.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN TEMPERATURE 50–86°F (10–30°C) LIGHT High/Bright indirect in summer HUMIDITY Low CARE Easy WATERING Water your cacti when the potting soil is completely dry. Depending on the conditions of your living space, this will usually take 3–4 weeks. Water thoroughly, but take care not to overwater, especially if your container does not have drainage holes, as this could cause root rot. Do not water at all between October and March.\n\n6\n\nDecorate the surface of the potting soil with pebbles and small stones.\n\nMAINTENANCE AND CARE Gently brush off any potting soil caught in the spines of the plants with a soft paintbrush. Place on a sunny windowsill from fall to spring; move the display farther away from the window in summer, when the heat can become too intense. Watch out for drafts in winter, and relocate if necessary.\n\n56\n\nAIR PLANT STAND Rootless air plants do not need soil to survive, and in the wild they are found clinging to rocky surfaces and hanging from the branches of trees. Echo their natural habitat by growing them on a wooden stand, which can comfortably display a small collection of air plants without using any glue or wire to\n\nAIR PLANT STAND\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nhold them in place.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Decorative mosses and lichen • Selection of air plants in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes (see pp.174–75)\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Untreated, rugged piece of wood with plenty of crevices and hollows, such as driftwood, grapewood, cork bark, or tree fern • Small branch • Florist’s wire\n\nTOOLS • Large bowl, for soaking • Wire cutters • Hot glue gun (optional)\n\n57\n\n1\n\nIf using ocean driftwood, make sure it has been presoaked to remove all salt residue. To desalinate your own driftwood, soak it in freshwater for several weeks, replenishing the water a few times during this period.\n\nAIR PLANT STAND\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n58\n\n2\n\nThread small pieces of moss onto the small branch and place it on top of the larger piece of wood. This will double up as both a decorative feature and an additional platform upon which to arrange your smaller air plants.\n\n3\n\nFasten the branch to the wood with wire, wrapping it around at least a couple of times to ensure it is secure.\n\n59\n\n4\n\nAttach bunches of moss and lichen to the larger piece of wood, using the wire or hot glue gun to secure them in place. If using glue, allow it to cool and solidify completely before adding your air plants to the display.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN TEMPERATURE 60–75°F (15–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY High CARE Easy WATERING Water your air plants with unsoftened water once a week (see p.185). Make sure the water is at lukewarm or at room temperature; cold water will shock the plants. Place them on a soft dishcloth and let them dry out completely before returning them to the stand. You can mist them 2–3 times a week. MAINTENANCE AND CARE Place the stand in bright indirect light. Make sure young plants have room to grow; if they become too large for their current spot, move them to a roomier, more stable part of the stand.\n\n5\n\nGently arrange your air plants in the wood’s natural crevices. Lighter, more delicate air plants can be placed along the attached branch. Do not glue the air plants in place (see right).\n\nNever use glue or wire to attach air plants to a display. Not only would this make it very difficult to soak the plants, but the chemicals in the glue may seriously harm the plants.\n\n60\n\nMACRAMÉ HANGER Macramé, the art of decoratively knotting cords and rope, can be used to create a simple hanger on which to display your favorite houseplants. Use wooden beads and cotton cord to create the simple, modern look shown here, or try different materials, such as metallic beads or unbleached rope,\n\nMACRAMÉ HANGER\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nto design a unique macramé hanger of your own.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANT • Suitable plant in a 6in (15cm) pot, such as a delta maidenhair fern\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • 32ft (10m) strong, nonstretch cord or string, such as cotton cord • Wooden ring • S-hook • 8 wooden beads (4 small and 4 large) • Decorative cachepot suitable for a 6in (15cm) plant\n\nTOOLS • Ruler or tape measure • Scissors\n\n61\n\n62\n\nlong tail\n\nshort tail\n\n1\n\nCut 4 lengths of cotton cord measuring 7¼ft (220cm), and 2 lengths measuring 20in (50cm). Thread the 4 long cords through the wooden ring, folding them in half over the edge. Hold the cords together in one hand just below the ring, leaving the lengths trailing below.\n\nMACRAMÉ HANGER\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nloop\n\n2\n\nTake one of the shorter cords and make a loop at one end. Pinch the loop in place on top of the trailing cords in your right hand, leaving both the long and short tails of the loop above the wooden ring.\n\nlong tail\n\nloop short tail loop short tail long tail\n\n3\n\nTightly wrap the long tail around the loop and trailing cords 5 times, moving farther away from the wooden ring. After 5 turns, thread the remainder of the long tail through the loop hole.\n\n4\n\nPull the short tail so that the loop slides inside the 5 turns. Cut off both ends close to the binding and tuck inside to complete the knot. This technique is known as a “wrapping knot.”\n\n63\n\n5\n\nUsing the S-hook, hang the ring up and check that you have 8 equal lengths of cord hanging down. Separate the cords into 4 pairs. Thread 1 small and 1 large wooden bead onto each pair of cords, approximately 12in (30cm) down from the ring.\n\n6\n\nTake 1 cord from 2 adjacent pairs and tie them together in a knot about 3in (8cm) down from the beads. Repeat this 3 times until all the cords are tied together. Repeat this process about 2in (6cm) below these knots (again taking 2 cords from adjacent pairs) to make another set of knots. The cords should now resemble a net.\n\n7\n\nGather all the cords about 2in (6cm) below these knots. Using the second short length of cord, tie them together in another wrapping knot (see steps 2–4). Ensure this knot is as tight as possible, then trim any excess cord to the desired length.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING When the plant needs watering, carefully remove it (and the pot) from the macramé hanger to prevent the cord from staining and rotting. MAINTENANCE AND CARE Before displaying your plant, test its weight in the macramé hanger by gently lifting it up by the S-hook. The wrapping knots should hold firm; if the pot doesn’t feel secure within the hanger, remove it and retie the knots until you are confident that they will hold. As the plant grows, it will cascade beautifully over the sides of the hanger. If it becomes too large and needs repotting, replace it with another 6in (15cm) plant rather than squeezing it back into the hanger in its larger pot.\n\n8\n\nFinally, fit your decorative cachepot securely into the hanger, then gently place your choice of plant inside the pot.\n\n64\n\nOPEN-BOTTLE TERRARIUM A terrarium is a semi-enclosed glass container that creates a warm, humid microclimate for the plants that grow within. For this open-bottle terrarium,\n\nOPEN-BOTTLE TERRARIUM\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nchoose a selection of foliage plants that showcase a variety of leaf shapes and colors. Pick one large “feature” plant that will stand out from the rest, taking care not to overcrowd the bottle so that they all have room to grow.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Selection of humidity-loving foliage plants (including 1 larger focal plant), such as small ferns, peperomias, and fittonias • Decorative mosses (optional)\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Wide, open-topped, heavy glass bottle or jar • Fine-grade gravel • Activated charcoal • Multipurpose potting soil • Decorative pebbles (optional)\n\nEQUIPMENT • Dibble • Small watering can with a rose attachment\n\n65\n\n1\n\nPour a layer of gravel, approximately 1in (2.5cm) deep, into the base of the bottle for drainage. Mix in a few spoonfuls of activated charcoal to prevent the growth of fungi.\n\nOPEN-BOTTLE TERRARIUM\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n66\n\n2\n\nAdd an even layer of potting soil, 2–4in (5–7.5cm) deep, over the gravel–charcoal mixture. Make a hole in the soil the same size as the focal plant’s root ball.\n\n3\n\nRemove the focal plant from its pot and loosen the roots to encourage healthy growth. Gently place the plant in the hole.\n\n67\n\n4\n\nFirm the potting soil around the base of the plant using the dibble. Repeat steps 3–4 with your remaining plants.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING Use a small watering can fitted with a rose attachment to water the plants. The grouped plants and semi-enclosed space create a humid environment that traps moisture, so take care not to overwater. Only water the plants when the potting soil dries out.\n\n5\n\nIf you wish, cover the surface of the potting soil with decorative mosses or pebbles. Carefully wipe the inside of the bottle clean.\n\nMAINTENANCE AND CARE Place the terrarium in a bright spot, but out of direct sunlight, which may scorch the leaves through the glass.\n\n68\n\nWILLOW CLIMBING FRAME This simple support for climbing plants is quick and easy to assemble, and makes an attractive feature even before it is hidden by leafy plant growth.\n\nWILLOW CLIMBING FRAME\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nOnce you’ve mastered this basic frame, you can apply the technique to more ambitious climbing projects by training the plant’s stems onto a trellis room divider or staircase, or fanning them out across a wall.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANT • Climbing plant, such as a philodendron, hoya, jasmine, or stephanotis\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Heavy-based pot with drainage holes • Multipurpose potting soil • 7 pliable willow poles, each at least 3ft (1m) in length • Garden twine\n\nTOOLS • Garden scissors\n\n69\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFill your pot with potting soil. Insert 6 evenly spaced willow poles around the edge of the pot.\n\nGather the poles together at a comfortable height directly above the centre of the pot, and tie together securely with a length of twine. Trim away any excess length from the tops of the poles using garden scissors.\n\nWILLOW CLIMBING FRAME\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n70\n\nWeave the final length of willow through the poles, roughly one-third of the way up the stand. Secure in place with twine to prevent it from slipping, then remove the entire frame from the pot and place it to one side.\n\nMake a hole in the potting soil the size of the root ball and lower the plant in, ensuring it sits at the same level that it rested at in its original pot. Fill in any gaps with new potting soil, firming it down gently.\n\n71\n\n6\n\nOne by one, wrap and weave the long stems of the plant around the poles. Thicker or heavier stems may need to be tied in with the twine; take care not to tie it too tightly.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING Keep the compost moist from spring to fall; reduce in winter, watering when the top of the compost feels dry. Mist every few days in summer, or when necessary. MAINTENANCE AND CARE As the plant grows, continue to weave the stems around the willow poles, tying them in with twine where necessary. If the plant climbs higher than the frame, most can be pruned to keep the size in check and the plant compact.\n\n5\n\nSpread the untangled stems of the climber out in a fan around the base of the pot. Insert the willow frame back into the potting soil, over the stems.\n\nAlternatively, position the overgrown plant next to a trellis and weave the longer stems onto the frame, training it over time and securing with garden twine.\n\n72\n\nSUCCULENT WREATH Plant an assortment of small succulent plants into a ring of carpet moss to create a beautiful and unique decorative wreath that will require minimal care when kept in the right conditions. Pair a variety of succulents with several different types of fluffy moss to add interest and character\n\nSUCCULENT WREATH\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nto your display.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Carpet moss • Selection of approximately 12 mini succulent plants, each with a 2in (5cm) pot size, such as echeverias, sempervivums, aeoniums, and crassulas • Reindeer moss\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Florist’s wire wreath frame, 12in (30cm) in diameter • Potting soil • Florist’s mossing pins • Florist’s wire\n\nTOOLS • Tray, for soaking • Wire cutters • Mister spray (optional)\n\n73\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSoak the carpet moss in a tray of water to make it easier to work with.\n\nLine the wire wreath frame with the carpet moss. Make sure that the bottom and sides of the frame are covered, and that you have enough moss to fold over the root balls of the plants.\n\nSUCCULENT WREATH\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n74\n\nRemove the plants from their pots and loosen their roots. Fold back the moss and bed the plants into the frame, allowing plenty of room for the plants to grow. Fill in the empty spaces between the plants with potting soil.\n\nFold the carpet moss back into place, over and around the bases of the plants and potting soil.\n\n75\n\n5\n\nUse the florist’s pins to secure the moss firmly in place around the base of the plants. Push the pins all the way down into the soil, so the moss holds tightly in place.\n\n6\n\nFor extra security, wrap florist’s wire around your wreath to stop the moss unraveling as it beds down.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING Depending on the heat and the humidity of the room, water the display approximately once a week by submerging the mossy base in a sink full of water. Let the wreath fully dry out before soaking it again. If the air is very dry, mist the plants occasionally. MAINTENANCE AND CARE Place your wreath out of direct sunlight and heat. Keep it laid flat for 1–2 months as the roots settle in. After this period, it will be safe to hang your wreath upright if you wish.\n\n7\n\nFinally, cover any exposed areas of soil or wire with pieces of reindeer moss, firmly pinning them in place.\n\n76\n\nKOKEDAMA FERN A type of bonsai, “kokedama” is the practice of suspending the roots of a plant in a mud ball coated with soft green moss. It is a great way to make a beautiful, hanging, sculptural object with a live plant. Arranging many\n\nKOKEDAMA FERN\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nkokedama plants together forms what is known as a “string garden.”\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Mature fern, such as a Cretan brake, foxtail, or staghorn fern • Sheet of carpet moss\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Potting soil • Akadama (claylike mineral used in bonsai) • Garden twine\n\nTOOLS • Bucket • Scissors • Mister spray\n\n77\n\n1\n\nCreate a 2:1 mixture of potting soil and akadama in a bucket, adding a little water until it reaches a sticky, wet consistency. The akadama turns the soil into a “mud–cake” that will mold around the plant’s roots.\n\n2\n\nTake the fern from its pot and gently shake loose some of the original potting soil from its roots.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nEnvelop the root ball in a sheet of carpet moss, gathering the moss around the stem.\n\nKOKEDAMA FERN\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n78\n\nEncase the fern roots in a layer of the damp potting soil–akadama mixture, approximately 1in (2.5cm) thick. Aim to create a ball of about the same volume as the original pot.\n\n79\n\n5\n\nTrim the excess moss with a pair of scissors, leaving some behind at the neck of the root ball.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN TEMPERATURE 55–75°F (13–75°C) LIGHT Bright indirect/Medium HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Average\n\n6\n\nWrap twine around the neck of the moss ball to secure the moss in place. Knot the twine firmly. To hang the fern up, attach a second length of twine around the neck of the kokedama to form a loop.\n\nWATERING Check if your plant needs to be watered by testing the weight of the moss ball. When it feels light, submerge the kokedama ball in water, keeping the foliage dry. Allow it to soak for 10–25 minutes, or until it is fully saturated. Remove the kokedama from the bucket, and gently squeeze the ball to drain any excess water. MAINTENANCE AND CARE Place your kokedama in a humid spot with bright indirect light. Mist regularly using a spray bottle.\n\n80\n\nMOSS PICTURE FRAME Living walls and vertical gardens have become increasingly popular in urban homes around the world. You can easily make one at home using a selection of mosses and mosslike plants, or alternatively with air plants. Creating a moss arrangement is all about combining various textures and\n\nMOSS PICTURE FRAME\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\ncolors to mimic a landscape.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Variety of different mosses, such as sphagnum moss to use as a foundation, bun moss to create hills and dips, and more decorative types like reindeer moss or trailing Spanish moss • Mosslike plants, such as baby’s tears (see p.140)\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Repurposed shallow wooden container, such as a wine crate or old serving tray, with a depth of approximately 4in (10cm) • Plastic trash can liner • Florist’s pins • Decorative branches, such as twigs with lichens growing on them and small pieces of driftwood • Florist’s wire\n\nTOOLS • Stapler or staple gun • Wire cutters • Watering can with a rose attachment or mister spray\n\n81\n\n1\n\nLine the back of the wooden container with a plastic trash can liner, stapling it into place. This will help retain moisture within the frame.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nWorking on a flat surface, staple or pin a thin layer of sphagnum moss to the back of the container to completely cover the plastic.\n\nMOSS PICTURE FRAME\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n82\n\nArrange pieces of bun moss in the container to add texture and interest. Pin to the sphagnum moss using florist’s pins. Begin adding pieces of decorative mosses to the display as desired.\n\nRemove your mosslike plants from their pots and loosen the roots. Bed the plants down between mounds of bun moss.\n\n83\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING Lightly water or mist the moss frame every few days. If dry air or central heating dries the plant out, you can also completely soak the moss to revive it. MAINTENANCE AND CARE Keep the frame laid flat for 1–2 months to allow the moss and rooted plants to settle into place. After that time, you can prop up the display or hang it upright if you wish. As with all photosynthetic organisms, your moss wall will prefer a room with high humidity and indirect light.\n\n5\n\nFor extra interest, attach pieces of decorative moss to twigs and small branches using wire, then place them into the display by wedging them securely into the lower corners of the frame.\n\n6\n\nAdd a few final pieces of decorative moss to the display as desired, combining different colors and textures to mimic a landscape. Secure them discreetly to the twigs using wire.\n\n84\n\nDRY TERRARIUM Unlike the humidity-loving plants displayed in the open-bottle terrarium (see pp.64–67), the plants in this display prefer drier, desertlike conditions. Choose a selection of succulents and cacti that vary in height and shape to create a more interesting display. This open terrarium does\n\nDRY TERRARIUM\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nnot self-irrigate, and so must be watered occasionally.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Selection of plants (including 1 larger focal plant), such as echeveria, crassula, and haworthia\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Glass terrarium with an opening of at least 7in (18cm) • Gravel or small pebbles • Activated charcoal • Cactus potting soil • Decorative pebbles\n\nTOOLS • Dibble • Small trowel or spoon • Watering can\n\n85\n\n1\n\nPour a shallow layer of gravel, with a depth of approximately 1in (2.5cm), over the base of the terrarium. Mix a small handful of activated charcoal into the gravel.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nAdd a layer of cactus potting soil, approximately 2–4in (5–7.5cm) deep, on top of the gravel–charcoal mixture.\n\nDRY TERRARIUM\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n86\n\nSelect your focal plant and remove it from its pot. Gently loosen the roots to encourage growth.\n\nMake a hole in the potting soil the same size as the root ball and gently place the plant in it. Use the dibble to firm the potting soil around the base of the plant.\n\n87\n\n5\n\nRepeat this process with 2–3 smaller plants. Leave space between the plants to allow for both growth and good air flow. This will prevent a build-up of humidity between the plants, which could lead to rot.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING Only water your display occasionally, when the potting soil completely dries out. The semi-enclosed space of the terrarium will retain moisture and create humidity, so take care not to overwater, as this may cause rot.\n\n6\n\nOnce the plants are firmly in place, carefully place decorative pebbles on top of the soil using a spoon.\n\nMAINTENANCE AND CARE Place your terrarium in indirect light; bright light could magnify within the glass container and cause the plants to overheat and dry out.\n\n88\n\nWOOD-MOUNTED ORCHID Mounting an orchid on decorative wood makes a beautiful display and can be beneficial to your orchid’s health. It mimics how the orchid would grow\n\nWOOD-MOUNTED ORCHID\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nnaturally and allows for good drainage and ventilation to the roots, which will help your plant thrive and prevent disease.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Small orchid, such as a moth orchid or nobile dendrobium • Sphagnum and decorative mosses\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Decorative piece of wood, such as driftwood, tree bark, cork bark, or birch pole • Florist’s wire\n\nTOOLS • Wire cutters\n\n89\n\nWOOD-MOUNTED ORCHID\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n90\n\n1\n\nRemove the orchid from its pot and carefully tease the potting medium from its roots.\n\n2\n\nPack sphagnum moss evenly in and around the roots of the orchid, leaving some outer roots partially exposed. Gently secure in place with a little wire.\n\n3\n\nPosition the orchid on the piece of wood with the plant’s crown angled downward. Wrap the wire around the base and roots of the orchid to secure it to the wood.\n\n91\n\n4\n\nTake care not to wrap the wire around the orchid too tightly, as this could damage it. When the plant feels comfortably secure, twist the two ends of wire together and cut away the excess with wire cutters.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN TEMPERATURE 61–80°F (16–27°C) LIGHT Bright indirect/Medium HUMIDITY Moderate to high CARE Easy WATERING Orchids attached to mounts tend to dry out fairly quickly, so water at least three times a week. To water the plant, submerge the entire mount in a large, deep bowl for 20 minutes until completely saturated.\n\n5\n\nDecorate the rest of the piece of wood with additional handfuls of moss, using wire to secure them in place.\n\nMAINTENANCE AND CARE Place in a humid area and mist daily. Leave the wire intact while the orchid’s roots find secure purchase on the wood. The root moss will eventually fall away as the plant grows new roots and explores the wood’s surface. Over time, the plant will develop the elegant, flattened shape characteristic of orchids found in the wild.\n\n92\n\nLIVING SPACE DIVIDER A movable trailing plant space divider can be used to create a beautiful temporary wall or living screen between different parts of your indoor space. Choose bushier plants to fill out the divider more completely, or show off a selection of decorative containers using\n\nLIVING SPACE DIVIDER\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nmacramé hangers (see pp.60–63).\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Selection of trailing plants that prefer bright, indirect light, such as string of pearls, rosary vine, and Christmas cacti • Selection of tall, midsized foliage plants with similar requirements, such as fiddle-leaf figs, spider plants, and most ferns\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Free-standing clothes rack, ideally with a lower shelf • String • S-hooks • Decorative cachepots of appropriate sizes • Macramé hangers • Large pot or bucket\n\nTOOLS • Scissors • Watering can\n\n93\n\n1\n\nSelect your first trailing plant. If its plastic pot is hidden by foliage, make 3 evenly spaced holes through the rim of the pot with a pair of scissors. Thread a length of string through each hole, securing each in place with a firm knot.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nGather the three strings together directly above the center of the plant, at the length from which you want the plant to hang from the rack. Tie a secure knot, leaving a short length of string above.\n\nLIVING SPACE DIVIDER\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\n94\n\nForm a small loop with the excess string, and tie it to the existing knot as tightly and neatly as possible. Trim any remaining string with scissors.\n\nSlip the bottom curve of an S-hook through the loop and slowly lift the plant, checking that all the knots are secure. Clip the top curve of the S-hook over the bar of the clothes rack. Repeat for all the plants you wish to hang.\n\n95\n\n5\n\nIf you wish to hide a plastic pot from view, place the plant in a decorative cachepot and nestle it securely into a macramé hanger. Tie the hanger securely onto the rack, or use an S-hook to hold it in place.\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING Water and mist all plants as required. Remove plants from macramé hangers when watering them to prevent saturating the decorative cord or rope (which could lead to rot over time).\n\n6\n\nOnce the rack is full, fill the gaps beneath by arranging a second selection of plants on the shelf beneath. Try out different combinations of plants and decorative pots until you are happy with the final appearance of your living frame.\n\nMAINTENANCE AND CARE Wherever you position your room divider, ensure that the space is draft free. Prune plants as needed; swap them out if they grow too large for the display.\n\n96\n\nPROPAGATION SHELF Rooting plants in water in pretty glass vessels makes a great display on a shelf or side table. You can make a temporary display while propagating cuttings to plant up later (see p.204), or leave them as they are to create a permanent “water garden.” This method is very simple but not suited\n\nPROPAGATION SHELF\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS\n\nto all plants, so choose your cuttings carefully.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL NEED PLANTS • Cuttings from mature, healthy plants, such as tradescantia, philodendron, crassula, pilea, epiphyllum, begonia, and chlorophytum\n\nOTHER MATERIALS • Glass bottles or vases of different heights and shapes; flasklike vessels with narrow necks and large bodies work best • Unsoftened water, such as mineral water or rainwater\n\nTOOLS • Small pair of pruning shears or scissors\n\n97\n\n1\n\nSelect your first cutting. Measure it against the bottle in which you wish to display it, then remove any leaves from the portion of the stem that will be submerged in water.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nHalf-fill your bottle with unsoftened water (do not use tap water). Make sure to use a glass bottle with plenty of room, so that the roots receive plenty of light and have space to grow.\n\nIf taking a cutting of a plant’s offset, such as a “baby spider” from a spider plant (see p.207), make the cut at the base of the offset’s individual stem. This is where the rooting hormone is most concentrated in the plant.\n\nPlace the cutting in the vase and leave it undisturbed on your chosen propagation shelf. Repeat this process with your remaining cuttings, each matched to a proportionally sized glass bottle or vase, until your display is complete.\n\nPROPAGATION SHELF\n\nHOUSEPLANT PROJECTS 98\n\n99\n\nHOW TO MAINTAIN WATERING Top up the bottles and vases with more water as and when needed. MAINTENANCE AND CARE After just a few weeks, your cuttings will begin to sprout roots. At this stage, if you want to plant your propagated cuttings, follow the instructions on p.204. You can also keep the cuttings permanently in water. If you choose to do so, remember to change the water or trim back the roots after a year or so.\n\nPLANT PROFILES\n\nBROMELIADS\n\nPLANT PROFILES\n\n102\n\nBROMELIADS AMAZONIAN ZEBRA PLANT Aechmea chantinii\n\nThese colorful plants bloom for many months and add a hint of the tropics to any bright room. They grow on trees in their native habitat, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil, but they do not require exceptionally high humidity levels and are quite easy to care for. After blooming, the plants die back, but most bromeliads produce “baby” offsets (see pp.206–07) next to the base of the old leaves, which then grow into new plants. The original bromeliad plant rarely reblooms indoors.\n\nTEMPERATURE 59–80°F (15–27°C) LIGHT Bright indirect/Medium HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Easy HEIGHT & SPREAD 2 x 2ft (60 x 60cm) This dramatic plant’s dark green and silver striped leaves and tall flower spikes appear from late spring to fall.

Bulbs are toxic\n\nBULBOUS PLANTS From tropical woodland plants to classic spring garden favorites, these flowers inject splashes of seasonal color and scent into indoor displays. Although bulbs are often associated with spring, many bloom at other times of the year—even in winter—so with a little planning, you can enjoy flowers in your home in every season. Just remember to plant the bulbs a few months before you want them to bloom.\n\nBrighten up your home in spring with the clivia’s sunny orange, yellow, or apricot flowers. The clusters of trumpet-shaped blooms last until summer, and these pretty woodland plants will thrive in a cool, bright room.\n\nWATERING Allow the top of the potting soil to dry out between waterings from spring until fall. The plant needs a rest from late fall to midwinter, when the potting soil should be kept almost dry. FEEDING Once bloomed (usually early summer), apply a half-strength balanced liquid fertilizer once a month to early fall. PLANTING AND CARE In fall, plant in a 50:50 mix of aerated and multipurpose potting soils in a 8in (20cm) pot, with the neck of the bulbs above the surface. Plants need a cool rest at 50°F (10°C) from midfall to late winter; then move to a well-lit room at 60°F (16°C) to bloom. Repot every 3–4 years; if top heavy and falling over, use a tall, heavy pot.\n\n107\n\nSIAM TULIP\n\nCurcuma alismatifolia\n\nTEMPERATURE 65–75°F (18–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY Moderate to high CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD 2 x 2ft (60 x 60cm) This beauty from Thailand brings a touch of the tropics to your home in summer, when its tulip-shaped pink and violet flowers appear on tall stems between dark green leaves.

All parts are toxic While the white arum lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) is best grown outdoors, the smaller, often more colorful calla lilies, such as Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmannii, make beautiful houseplants. They feature plain or spotted leaves and the flowers, which comprise yellow, pink, purple, dark red, or black spathes (petallike sheaths) around a spike of tiny flowers, appear from spring to fall.\n\nWATERING Keep the potting soil moist from late spring to late summer; the potting soil should be almost dry in winter. FEEDING Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks from spring until the flowers have faded.\n\nFALSE SHAMROCK Oxalis triangularis\n\nTEMPERATURE 60–70°F (15–21°C) LIGHT Medium HUMIDITY Low CARE Easy HEIGHT & SPREAD 12 x 12in (30 x 30cm) WARNING! All parts are toxic to pets The purple or variegated leaves of this highly decorative plant resemble those of shamrock. The triangular leaves also perform a party trick, folding up at night and opening during the day. In addition to the foliage, sprays of small pink or white starry flowers appear over many weeks from spring to summer.\n\nWATERING Allow the top of the potting soil to dry out between waterings. From fall to winter, when the plant becomes\n\ndormant and the foliage starts to die off, refrain from watering. The plant may look dead, but if you then start watering again after 4–6 weeks, new leafy growth will soon reappear.\n\nFEEDING Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every month when the plant is in growth from spring to late summer. Stop feeding during dormancy. PLANTING AND CARE Plant the bulbs in fall in a 6–8in (15–20cm) pot in an equal mix of aerated potting soil, multipurpose potting soil, and horticultural hard sand. The bulbs should be 2in (5cm) below the soil surface. False shamrock is also frequently sold in leaf as a potted plant. Set in a medium-light spot, out of direct sun, from spring to fall, and then move to a cool room in winter.\n\nPLANTING AND CARE In late winter, plant in a wide pot in multipurpose potting soil, with the rhizomes (large, oval bulbs) just showing above the surface, and the eyes (dark bumps) uppermost. Set in a warm spot in bright indirect light. Allow foliage to die down in fall. Repot in winter, and store in a cool place.\n\nORCHIDS\n\nPLANT PROFILES\n\n110\n\nORCHIDS Prized for their exotic flowers, orchids come in a vast range of shapes and colors, and some also have scented blooms. The stars of any show, use one as a focal point in a bright room, or recreate their natural inclination to cling to trees by growing those with aerial roots on bark or a log (see pp.88–91). While some of these divas demand lots of attention, others—most notably the widely available moth orchids (Phalaenopsis)—will thrive without too much fuss.\n\n111\n\nSPIDER ORCHID Brassia species\n\nTEMPERATURE 55–75°F (12–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY High CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD Up to 3 x 3ft (1 x 1m) Like colorful spiders crawling along arching stems, the unusual blooms of this orchid comprise long, thin, yellow or green petals, with brown or maroon stripes or spots, attached to a rounded central lip. The spidery flowers also have a delicious spicy scent and appear in late spring and summer, while the pseudobulbs (swellings at the base of the stems) each produce two or three long, strap-shaped green leaves.\n\nWATERING Allow the top of the potting soil to dry out between waterings in spring and summer. Partly submerge the pot in a tray of unsoftened water for half an hour, then leave to drain. In winter, the plant needs a rest and should be kept drier, watering just enough to prevent the pseudobulbs from shrinking. Mist the leaves daily from spring to late summer and stand the pot on a tray of wet pebbles, or install a room humidifier.\n\nCYMBIDIUM\n\nCymbidium species and hybrids\n\nTEMPERATURE 50–75°F (10–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD 2 x 2ft (60 x 60cm) for miniatures, and 4 x 21⁄2ft (1.2 x 0.75m) for standards This free-flowering orchid will brighten up your home from late fall to spring, when few other plants are at their best. The stems of large blooms emerge from between strap-shaped green leaves, creating an explosion of color. The named hybrids are easier than the species, and there are two types to choose from: large “standards” that can grow up to 4ft (1.2m), and the smaller, more popular “miniatures,” which are ideal for a windowsill.\n\nWATERING In spring and summer, allow the top of the potting soil to dry out between waterings, and water from above with unsoftened water, making sure that any excess can drain\n\naway. Reduce watering to once every 2 weeks in winter. Place on a tray of wet pebbles.\n\nFEEDING Apply a half-strength general liquid fertilizer with every third watering in spring, then switch to special orchid fertilizer throughout summer. PLANTING AND CARE Plant in a 6–8in (15–20cm) opaque pot in special orchid potting medium (or a 6:1:1 mix of composted bark, perlite, and charcoal). This ground-dwelling orchid does not have aerial roots, and does not need a clear pot. Stand in bright light all year, out of direct summer sun. Ideally, set it on a partly shaded patio outdoors in summer and early fall (before the frosts), when plants need a distinct drop between day and night temperatures to form flower buds. In late fall, keep in a cool room, ideally below 59°F (15°C); bring into a slightly warmer room to flower. Repot every year or two in spring.\n\nFEEDING Apply special orchid fertilizer with every other watering from midspring, when new growth emerges, to late summer. PLANTING AND CARE Plant the spider orchid in a 4–8in (10–20cm) clear pot in special orchid potting medium (or a 6:1:1 mix of composted bark, perlite, and charcoal). Do not cover the aerial roots, which should be left exposed to the light. Set in a bright position, out of direct summer sun and away from drafts, and provide good ventilation. Cut the flower spike down to just above the first node after blooming, then place in lower light. The orchid likes to be cramped, so only repot when growth starts to suffer. Cymbidium hybrid\n\nNamed hybrids are the most widely available and easy to care for. Choose from the huge range of flower colors, many with patterned or spotted petals.\n\nCymbidium miniature\n\nMiniature cymbidiums are compact hybrids, ranging in height from 12–24in (30–60cm). Like all cymbidiums, they need a cool room to flower well.\n\n112\n\nNOBILE DENDROBIUM Dendrobium nobile hybrids\n\nUpright canelike stems of scented flowers appear from fall to early spring on this flamboyant orchid. Those with pink or white flowers are the most popular, but they come in a wide range of colors. Although this is one of the easier dendrobiums to grow, be prepared to pamper it, and do not worry if the plant loses some leaves in winter, as it is a semideciduous.\n\nWATERING From spring to late summer, water once or twice a week in the morning using lukewarm unsoftened water (see Brassia watering method on p.110). Reduce watering to every 2 weeks in early fall to stimulate flower buds to form; in winter, do not water, but mist occasionally to prevent the\n\npseudobulbs (swellings at the base of the plant) from shriveling. Set on a tray of wet pebbles from early spring to late summer.\n\nFEEDING Apply a half-strength balanced liquid fertilizer every 2–3 weeks from spring to summer. In late summer, change to a half-strength high-potassium fertilizer for one month, then discontinue feeding until the following spring. PLANTING AND CARE Plant this orchid in a 6–8in (15–20cm) clear pot in special orchid potting medium (or a 6:1:1 mix of composted bark, perlite, and charcoal). Grow in a bright spot, out of direct summer sun, and away from drafts. To bloom, this dendrobium needs a distinct difference between day and night temperatures, and it is best grown outside in semishade from summer to early fall (before the frosts). In winter when blooming, keep it in an unheated room with a nighttime temperature of about 50°F (10°C) or slightly lower. Repot every year in spring.\n\nORCHIDS\n\nPLANT PROFILES\n\nTEMPERATURE 40–75°F (5–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY Moderate to high CARE Difficult HEIGHT & SPREAD 24 x 18in (60 x 45cm)\n\nPANSY ORCHID Miltoniopsis hybrids\n\nTEMPERATURE 54–80°F (12–27°C) LIGHT Bright indirect/Medium HUMIDITY High CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD 2 x 2ft (60 x 60cm) Often labeled as Miltonia (hybrids of Miltoniopsis), this compact orchid produces large, fragrant blooms with distinctive pansylike markings on the face, hence its common name. The flowers can appear in spring or fall, depending on the hybrid.\n\nWATERING In the summer, apply unsoftened water every day or two from above, giving the plant a good soaking, and then leave it to drain. In winter, reduce watering to once every 2–3 weeks. Set on a tray of wet pebbles and mist every few days. FEEDING Apply special orchid fertilizer every 2 weeks, but flush the plant with plenty of unsoftened water once a month to prevent a build-up of salts. PLANTING AND CARE Plant in a 6–8in (15–20cm) clear pot in special orchid potting medium (or a 6:1:1 mix of composted bark, perlite, and charcoal). The pansy orchid will be happy in medium light in summer; move closer to the window in winter. Avoid direct sun and drafts, and repot annually in spring.\n\nDendrobium nobile ‘Star Class Akatsuki’\n\nThis brightly colored orchid produces spikes of dazzling fuchsia-pink flowers with white and yellow centers.\n\nDendrobium nobile ‘Star Class Apollon’\n\nOne of the popular clear white forms of nobile dendrobium, it forms tall spikes of small, long-lasting blooms.\n\n113\n\nNELLY ISLER\n\n× Oncidopsis Nelly Isler gx\n\nTEMPERATURE 60–75°F (16–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect/Medium HUMIDITY High CARE Difficult HEIGHT & SPREAD Up to 20 x 20in (50 x 50cm) This orchid hybrid is prized for its tall stems of bright red flowers with white spotted lips and a yellow eye. Blooms appear at any time of year, but most flower in fall, and they have an intense lemony fragrance.\n\nWATERING Using unsoftened water, apply when the top of the potting soil is slightly dry (see watering method for\n\nBUTTERFLY ORCHID Oncidium hybrids\n\nTEMPERATURE 55–77°F (13–25°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD Up to 2 x 2ft (60 x 60cm) The stems of this dainty orchid hold dozens of small flowers that look like butterflies or dancing ladies, creating a spectacular effect, usually in fall. The hybrids are relatively easy and can be mounted on bark or slate.\n\nWATERING Apply unsoftened water when the top of the potting soil is slightly dry. In winter, water just once a month. Set on a tray of wet pebbles and mist every day or two. FEEDING Apply special orchid fertilizer, diluted to one-quarter strength, with every second or third watering. PLANTING AND CARE Grow on bark, or in a 5–6in (12.5–15cm) opaque pot in special orchid potting medium. It likes to be cramped, so repot only when the pot becomes too small for the new growth.\n\nBrassia on p.110). In winter, reduce watering slightly. Set on a tray of wet pebbles and mist every day or two.\n\nFEEDING Apply a half-strength orchid fertilizer every 2 weeks year-round. PLANTING AND CARE Grow in a 6–8in (15–20cm) clear pot in special orchid potting medium. Keep out of direct sun, in temperatures of 60–75°F (16–24°C). After flowering, trim the stems to just above the lowest node (bump on the stem) to encourage a second bloom. Repot every year or two in spring.\n\n114\n\nSLIPPER ORCHID\n\nORCHIDS\n\nPLANT PROFILES\n\nPaphiopedilum ‘Maudiae Femma’\n\nMOTH ORCHID Phalaenopsis hybrids\n\nTEMPERATURE 63–77°F (17–25°C) LIGHT Bright indirect/Medium HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD 12 x 8in (30 x 20cm)\n\nTEMPERATURE 61–80°F (16–27°C) LIGHT Bright indirect/Medium HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Easy HEIGHT & SPREAD Up to 3 x 2ft (90 x 60cm)\n\nThis orchid has great allure and features large showy flowers in a wide range of colors, with a distinctive slipperlike pouch that gives rise to its common name. The blooms generally appear for many weeks from winter to early summer, although some hybrids flower at other times, too. The long green or mottled leaves form a fan shape, and provide interest while the plant is not in flower. Named hybrids are easier than the species to look after.\n\nOne of the most widely available and easiest orchids to grow, the moth orchid produces long arching stems topped with large round blooms in a huge range of colors, some with delicate patterning. The flowers can appear at any time of the year. There are also miniature hybrids for small spaces, and all types are happy in high daytime winter temperatures and will grow well in a centrally heated home.\n\nWATERING Using unsoftened water, keep the potting soil moist from spring to fall, applying water once or twice a week (see Brassia watering method on p.110). Reduce watering in winter, but do not let the potting soil dry out completely. Set on a tray of wet pebbles to raise humidity levels, but do not mist, as this may lead to rotting.\n\nWATERING Keep the potting soil moist at all times and apply water every 5–7 days in the morning (ideally, use softened water in hard-water areas). Reduce watering slightly in winter, but do not let the potting soil dry out completely.\n\nFEEDING Apply special orchid fertilizer every 2–3 weeks from spring to fall; in winter, apply it at half-strength and at the same frequency. PLANTING AND CARE Grow the slipper orchid in a 5–8in (15–20cm) opaque pot in special orchid potting medium (or a 4:1 mix of finely composted bark and perlite). This ground-dwelling orchid does not need a clear pot, as it produces no aerial roots. Grow in medium light in summer, out of direct sun, and in full light in winter. The plain green–leaved orchids like cool conditions; the more widely available mottle-leaved types need warmth, with a minimum of 63°F (17°C) at night. Repot annually after flowering in a slightly larger container, making sure new growth is not buried.\n\nPhalaenopsis hybrid\n\nMany orchids are not named when you buy them, but the most widely available will be easy-care hybrids. Simply choose colors to suit your scheme, and team up matching hues.\n\n115\n\nVANDA ORCHID Vanda hybrids\n\nSet on a tray of wet pebbles; mist the plants occasionally in the morning, which allows excess water to dry before the colder nights.\n\nFEEDING Apply a special orchid fertilizer with each watering once a week, but flush through the plant with plain water and no fertilizer once a month to remove excess salts. Reduce feeding to once a month in winter. PLANTING AND CARE Plant in a 4–6in (10–15cm) clear pot in special orchid potting medium (or a 6:1:1 mix of composted bark, perlite, and charcoal). Do not bury the aerial roots, which need to be exposed. Set in medium light in summer; bring closer to a bright window in winter. Avoid drafts and major temperature fluctuations; these orchids prefer warmth year-round. After flowering, cut the stem just above the lowest node (bump on stem) to encourage a second bloom. Repot every 2 years in a slightly larger container.\n\nPhalaenopsis So Petit range\n\nThis group of miniature hybrid moth orchids comes in a range of colors, including pink, peach, and white, and they fit neatly onto a windowsill.\n\nTEMPERATURE 61–90°F (16–32°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY High CARE Difficult HEIGHT & SPREAD 4 x 2ft (1.2 x 0.6m) This tropical orchid is demanding, but its large colorful blooms, often patterned and up to 6in (15cm) in diameter, make the effort worthwhile when they appear in spring and summer. Vandas need very high levels of humidity, and they are commonly grown in a vase or an open wire basket without potting soil.\n\nCAMBRIA ORCHID\n\n× Vuylstekeara Cambria gx ‘Plush’\n\nTEMPERATURE 50–75°F (10–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY High CARE Difficult HEIGHT & SPREAD Up to 20 x 14in (50 x 35cm) While this beautiful hybrid orchid is not widely available, it is worth seeking out if you like a challenge. The rewards for your efforts are tall arched stems of large, dark red, fragrant flowers, with white spotted lips and a yellow eye. The long-lasting blooms appear at any time of year, but mostly in winter or spring.\n\nWATERING Water every morning by plunging the roots into a bucket of lukewarm unsoftened water for 15 minutes until the roots go green, then drain; reduce to every 3–4 days in winter. Vandas demand high humidity and should be misted a few times a day; alternatively, install a humidifier.\n\nWATERING Apply unsoftened water when the top of the potting soil is slightly dry (use the method described for Brassia on p.110) and water every 5–7 days from spring to fall, and every 7–10 days in winter. Set on a tray of wet pebbles and mist the leaves every day or two, or install a room humidifier.\n\nFEEDING Mist the leaves and roots once a week with a ready-mixed orchid fertilizer spray. Apply every 2 months in winter.\n\nFEEDING Apply a half-strength orchid fertilizer with every second or third watering year-round.\n\nPLANTING AND CARE Grow in a slatted basket or in a large clear vase with no potting soil. Set in a bright spot, out of direct summer sun, but in good light in winter. A heated, well-ventilated room or greenhouse is ideal. Lower nighttime temperatures in fall encourage flower buds to form. To repot, soak the roots and gently pull them away from the sides of the basket, then place the plant in its small basket into a larger basket; the roots will then grow on without disturbance.\n\nPLANTING AND CARE Grow in a 4–8in (10–20cm) clear pot in special orchid potting medium. To promote flowering, make sure there is a 10°F (6°C) drop in temperature at night. After flowering, trim back the stems to just above the lowest node (bump on stem) to encourage a second bloom of blooms. Repot only when the pseudobulbs (swellings at the base of the stems) fill the container completely.\n\n116\n\nFLOWERING MAPLE Abutilon × hybridum\n\nTEMPERATURE 54–75°F (12–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY Low CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD Up to 36 x 24in (90 x 60cm)\n\nOTHER FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nPLANT PROFILES\n\nDress up your home with this tall shrub’s large bell-shaped flowers, which come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, pink, and white. The maplelike green or variegated foliage provides a foil for long-lasting summer blooms.\n\nOTHER FLOWERING PLANTS While many houseplants produce flowers, some are grown specifically for their beautiful blooms, and can be used to inject seasonal color into a green leafy display. This selection includes plants that bloom at different times of the year, and some that even flower in the depths of winter.\n\nWATERING Keep the potting soil moist from spring to fall; in winter, allow the top of the potting soil to dry out between waterings. FEEDING Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks between spring and fall, replacing it in summer with a high-potassium fertilizer. PLANTING AND CARE Grow in an equal mix of multipurpose and aerated potting soils in a 8–12in (20–30cm) pot. Set in a bright position, and move in winter to a cooler room with daytime temperatures of 61–68°F (16–20°C). Trim back stems and pinch back the tips in spring to create a bushier, compact plant. Prune again in fall if necessary. Repot every 2 years.\n\n117\n\nANTHURIUM\n\nAnthurium andraeanum AGM\n\nTEMPERATURE 61–75°F (16–24°C) LIGHT Bright indirect HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD 18 x 12in (45 x 30cm)\n\nFEEDING Apply a half-strength, highpotassium liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks from spring to summer.\n\nBrugmansia × candida\n\nTEMPERATURE 61–77°F (16–25°C) LIGHT High/Bright indirect HUMIDITY Moderate CARE Average HEIGHT & SPREAD 4 x 3ft (1.2 x 1m) WARNING!
