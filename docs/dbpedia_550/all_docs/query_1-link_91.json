This genus is commonly known as calla lilies, despite not being true lilies. They are renowned for their elegant, spathe-enclosed inflorescences and are often used as ornamentals in gardens and floral arrangements.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe genus name Zantedeschia was named in honor of Giovanni Zantedeschi, an Italian botanist from the 19th century. The term reflects the historical tradition of naming plant genera after influential botanists.\n\nVarieties\n\nZantedeschia comprises various species, notable ones include:\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica: The common white calla lily.\n\nZantedeschia elliottiana: Known for its yellow spathes.\n\nZantedeschia rehmannii: Features pinkish hues.\n\nCultivation\n\nCalla lilies are relatively easy to grow with the right conditions:\n\nSoil: Well-drained, moisture-retentive soils are ideal.\n\nLight: Partial shade to full sun exposure enhances growth.\n\nWater: Regular watering is essential, particularly during active growth.\n\nUsage Note: These plants thrive in moderately warm conditions and are sensitive to frost.\n\nSynonyms\n\nCalla lily\n\nArum lily (particularly for Zantedeschia aethiopica)\n\nAntonyms\n\nTrue lilies (e.g., from the genus Lilium)\n\nRelated Terms\n\nAraceae: The family of flowering plants to which Zantedeschia belongs.\n\nSpathe: A large bract that encloses the flower cluster (spadix).\n\nFun Fact\n\nThe white calla lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) is often associated with purity and is frequently used in wedding bouquets and funeral arrangements.\n\nQuotation\n\n“Graceful and elegant, the calla lily stands as a symbol of beauty and purity, inspiring awe in both botanists and casual observers alike.” – Anonymous\n\nUsage Paragraph\n\nCalla lilies are favored for their striking appearance and ease of cultivation. Whether in a garden border or a decorative pot, these plants bring a touch of sophistication. Their sculptural blooms and vibrant colors make them a choice selection for various ornamental and floral arrangements.\n\nSuggested Literature\n\n“The Complete Book of Callas” by Carl Cox - A comprehensive guide to cultivating and appreciating calla lilies.\n\n“The Genus Zantedeschia” by Graham Duncan - An in-depth look at the botany and horticulture of this genus.\n\nQuiz\n\n## What is the common name for the genus Zantedeschia? - [x] Calla lily - [ ] Daylily - [ ] Water lily - [ ] Mariposa lily > **Explanation:** The common name for the genus Zantedeschia is \"calla lily\". ## Which family does Zantedeschia belong to? - [x] Araceae - [ ] Liliaceae - [ ] Rosaceae - [ ] Orchidaceae > **Explanation:** Zantedeschia belongs to the family Araceae. ## Who was the genus Zantedeschia named after? - [x] Giovanni Zantedeschi - [ ] Carl Linnaeus - [ ] Gregor Mendel - [ ] Charles Darwin > **Explanation:** The genus Zantedeschia was named in honor of Giovanni Zantedeschi, an Italian botanist. ## Which species of Zantedeschia is known for its white spathes? - [x] Zantedeschia aethiopica - [ ] Zantedeschia elliottiana - [ ] Zantedeschia rehmannii - [ ] Zantedeschia pentlandii > **Explanation:** Zantedeschia aethiopica is known for its white spathes. ## What does the spathe of a calla lily enclose? - [x] Inflorescence - [ ] Fruits - [ ] Seed - [ ] Pollen > **Explanation:** The spathe of a calla lily encloses the inflorescence. ## Which is the preferred soil type for cultivating calla lilies? - [x] Well-drained, moisture-retentive soil - [ ] Sandy, dry soil - [ ] Compact, clay soil - [ ] Acidic peat soil > **Explanation:** Well-drained, moisture-retentive soils are ideal for cultivating calla lilies. ## In which conditions do calla lilies thrive? - [x] Moderately warm conditions, partial shade to full sun - [ ] Very cold and frosty conditions - [ ] Total shade - [ ] Arid and desert-like conditions > **Explanation:** Calla lilies thrive in moderately warm conditions with partial shade to full sun exposure and are sensitive to frost. ## What is another name for Zantedeschia aethiopica? - [x] Arum lily - [ ] Water lily - [ ] Easter lily - [ ] Spider lily > **Explanation:** Zantedeschia aethiopica is also known as the Arum lily. ## Why are calla lilies frequently used in wedding bouquets? - [x] They symbolize purity and beauty. - [ ] They have medicinal properties. - [ ] They are resistant to pests. - [ ] They are the cheapest flowers. > **Explanation:** Calla lilies symbolize purity and beauty, making them a popular choice for wedding bouquets."
