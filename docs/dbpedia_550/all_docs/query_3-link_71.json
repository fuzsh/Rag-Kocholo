        "text": "INFECTION RESISTANT PLANTS AND METHODS FOR THEIR GENERATION\n\nThis application is based on and claims the benefit of the filing date of Australian provisional patent application 2004905414 filed 21st September 2004.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates generally to virus resistant plants, wherein the plants are resistant to aphid transmitted viruses. In particular, the invention relates to the expression of the coding region for aphid transmission factor, wherein the plant becomes resistant to aphid-borne viruses. In one embodiment, the coding region for aphid transmission factor is modified such that untranslatable mRNA is produuced in a plant.\n\nThe invention further relates to methods of inducing resistance to aphid-borne viruses, and plants that are transformed with an aphid transmission factor gene.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nOne of the most significant problems associated with agriculture is viral-induced crop damage. Plant viruses are capable of infecting many of the agriculturally important crops, and the damage caused by these infections result in significant losses in crop yield each year. These crop losses reduce the economic value of these crops to the grower, and these losses are eventually passed on to the consumer as higher prices.\n\nMany of the most damaging plant viruses are transmitted to host plants by insects such as plant hoppers eg leaf hoppers and tree hoppers, thrips, beetles, fleas, flies, bugs like the sugarcane lace bug, avocado lace bug, and M. O -_\n\nmealy bug and aphids. However, of all the insect pests none is more problematic than the aphids. There are about 4,000 species of aphids in the world, of which about 250 are serious pests. Twenty-five percent of all plant species are infested with aphids, and though it is believed that the speciation of aphids has followed that of plants not all groups of plants are equally parasitised. The Compositae, the 3rd most specious plant family, supports the most aphid species (605 species), but the Orchidacea, the 2nd most specious plant family, only support 9 species of aphids. Rosaceae, which is only the 22nd most specious plant family, supports the 3rd highest number of aphid species (293 species) . The plant family which supports the 2nd highest number of aphids is Coniferae (363 species) , but these are non-flowering plants.\n\nAphids have a world-wide distribution but there are far more species in temperate zones. Aphids are part of the Superfamily Aphidoidae, which is divided up into 10 families. Two families, the Aphididae and the\n\nDrepanosiphidae make up 70% of the species. Members of the Superfamily Aphidoidea include Pemphigidae, Anoeciidae, HormAphididae, Mindaridae, Thelaxidae, Drepanosiphidae, Phloeomyzidae, Greenideidae, Aphididae and Lachnidae.\n\nPerhaps the most important aphid pest is Myzus persicae the peach-potato aphid. M. persicae is a green or slightly reddish aphid which has peach as its primary host and a wide range of secondary hosts including many brassicas. M. persicae is cosmopolitan in temperate climates occurring in USA and a fair portion of Europe including the UK. Though it seldom occurs in numbers large enough to cause direct damage from feeding pressure it is capable of transmitting over 100 viruses, including the potato leaf roll and Y viruses of potatoes, mosaic, yellow net and yellows viruses of sugar-beet, cauliflower mosaic plum pox, cucumber mosaic, lettuce mosaic, and turnip mosaic. The black bean aphid Aphis fabae is another major pest which can if unchecked cause losses of up to 46% on broad bean crops. The pea aphid Acyrthosiphum pisum, is a large green aphid with long antennae and legs. The pea aphid is found on many leguminous plants and transmits lucerne mosaic virus, pea leaf roll virus, pea enation mosaic virus, pea mosaic virus and pea enation mosaic virus. Cabbage aphid Bzevicoryne brassicae is a serious pest of the major cabbage crops, cabbages, cauliflowers and brussel sprouts, like the pea aphid, the cabbage aphid is a one host species spending all its life on Brassicas.\n\nGrain aphid Sitobion avenae, carrot aphid Cavariella aegopodli, groundnut aphid Aphis craccivora a polyphagus species that prefers legumes, cotton aphid Aphis gossypii a polyphagus species found in warmer regions, black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii a polyphagus in warmer regions, willow aphid Cavariella spp. on willows, holarctic willow leaf aphids Chaitophorus spp. on willows and poplars in Europe, black pine aphids Cinara spp. on a variety of conifers widespread in America, Africa, Asia and Europe, Sycamore Aphid Drepanosiphum platanoides on sycamore only in Europe and North America, spruce aphids Elatobium spp. on Picea in North America and Europe.\n\nThe mechanism by which aphids firstly, carry different types of viruses, and secondly transmit these viruses to host plants is poorly understood. However, what is known is that virus is usually transmitted mechanically by aphid mouthparts in a non-persistent, non-circulative, stylet borne manner. Aphids can obtain the virus after only brief contact with an infected host and usually retain the virus for less than an hour, though a few viruses can survive up to 40 hours. Because of the brief retention of the virus, aphids can normally only carry it for relatively short distances. However, with strong winds the virus can be spread great distances from other infected hosts. One speculation of how aphids retain the virus is that during feeding the virus adheres to the sucking pump and foregut. In subsequent feedings sap from the foregut is regurgitated, carrying the virus to a new host.\n\nTransmission of the virus by aphids is dependent on a 53-58 kDa helper component protein, HC-Pro. HC-Pro functions as a dimer and is translated from an area located near the 5' end of RNA. HC-Pro aids in the binding of virus to the maxillary stylets. It also acts as a proteinase and is speculated to assist in cell to cell movement.\n\nAphid transmissibility and specificity are also dependent upon the coat protein.\n\nAnother factor involved in aphid transmission of plant viruses is the aphid transmission factor or protein. Lung and Pirone {Phytopathology 63, 912-914, 1973; Virology 60, 260- 264, 1974) demonstrated that aphid transmission is regulated by an aphid transmission factor (ATF) . In the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) , the ATF is presumed to interact with both virus particles and vector mouthparts, thereby mediating virus aphid transmission (Schmidt et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 13: 91 (19) : 8885-9) . To date there has been no demonstration that the ATF has a role to play within the plant.\n\nAfter the aphid deposits the virus on the host, it enters the cell and the coat protein is removed. A replicase is then assembled and the virus is copied many times. Some of these copies remain as uncoated RNA molecules and move into adjacent cells to promote further infection. Primary infection then occurs when other copies are coated with the protein and ascend into the upper regions of the plant without causing serious harm to the plant. These virus particles remain in the upper regions throughout the vegetative cycle of the plant.\n\nPast attempts at controlling or preventing aphid-borne viral infection of plants have concentrated upon either cultivating resistant plant lines that exhibit genetic resistance to virus infection, or controlling the aphids per se. However, while these methods have partially succeeded in reducing the incidence of viral infection, there have been a number of major environmental and agricultural impacts. In particular the indiscriminate use of insecticides has resulted in the death of many species of insects' not just aphids, with some of these insects being beneficial species. Moreover, there has been an increase in significant health risks to humans that are allergic to agricultural chemicals.\n\nWith the advent of molecular techniques, a number of approaches for combating plant viruses have been developed. The obvious advantage of such approaches is that the use of expensive and indiscriminate insecticides is reduced. However, there is a further advantage in that the means of providing the protection is incorporated into the plant itself, thereby becoming an inheritable trait which is passed on to its progeny.\n\nThe inventors have now developed a molecular-based method for protecting plants from aphid-borne virus, which alleviates or obviates the use of insecticides.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccordingly, in its most general aspect, the invention disclosed herein provides a method for protecting plants from aphid-borne viral infection. The method utilises a nucleic acid molecule, which codes for an aphid transmission factor, wherein the aphid transmission factor provides protection against aphid-borne viral infection.\n\nIn a first aspect, the present invention provides a method for protecting a plant from aphid-borne viral infection, comprising the step of introducing a nucleic acid molecule into a plant, which nucleic acid molecule codes for an aphid transmission factor.\n\nPreferably, the aphid transmission factor is an untranslatable nucleic acid molecule, wherein the nucleic acid molecule is transcribed but not translated.\n\nThe nucleic acid molecule may be cDNA, RNA, or a hybrid molecule thereof.

Most preferably, the cDNA molecule is substantially that shown in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or biologically active fragment thereof.\n\nThe nucleic acid molecule may integrate into the host cell genome, or may exist as an extrachromosomal element.\n\nIn a further embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is additionally modified so that a truncated mRNA is produced upon expression so that the inability to produce functional protein is enhanced.\n\nThe aphid transmission factor nucleic acid molecule may be isolated from any aphid-borne viral species. Preferably, the virus is a virus selected from the viral family group consisitng of Luteoviridae, Bromoviridae, Comoviridae, and Potyviridae.

Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the meaning commonly understood by a person skilled in the art to which this invention belongs. The following references provide one of skill with a general definition of many of the terms used in this invention: Singleton, et al. , Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology (2nd ed. 1994); The Cambridge Dictionary of Science and\n\nTechnology (Walker ed. , 1988); The Glossary of Genetics, 5th Ed., Rieger, R., et al. (eds.), Springer Verlag (1991); and Hale & Marham, The Harper Collins Dictionary of Biology (1991) . However, in order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope given such terms, the following definitions are provided.\n\nThe term \"cell\" can refer to any cell from a plant, including but not limited to, somatic cells, gametes or embryos.\n\n\"Embryo\" refers to a sporophytic plant before the start of germination. Embryos can be formed by fertilisation of gametes by sexual crossing or by selfing. A \"sexual cross\" is pollination of one plant by another. \"Selfing\" is the production of seed by self-pollination, ie., pollen and ovule are from the same plant. The term \"backcrossing\" refers to crossing a Fl hybrid plant to one of its parents. Typically, backcrossing is used to transfer genes, which confer a simply inherited, highly heritable trait into an inbred line. The inbred line is termed the recurrent parent. The source of the desired trait is the donor parent. After the donor and the recurrent parents have been sexually crossed, F, hybrid plants which possess the desired trait of the donor parent are selected and repeatedly crossed (ie., backcrossed) to the recurrent parent or inbred line.\n\nEmbryos can also be formed by \"embryo somatogenesis\" and \"cloning.\" Somatic embryogenesis is the direct or indirect production of embryos from either cells, tissues or organs of plants.\n\nIndirect somatic embryogenesis is characterised by growth of a callus and the formation of embryos on the surface of the callus.\n\nDirect somatic embryogenesis is the formation of an asexual embryo from a single cell or group of cells on an explant tissue without an intervening callus phase. Because abnormal plants tend to be derived from a callus, direct somatic embryogenesis is preferred.\n\nThe common term, \"grain\" is the endosperm present in the ovules of a plant.\n\nThe phrase \"introducing a nucleic acid sequence\" refers to introducing nucleic acid sequences by recombinant means, including but not limited to, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, biolistic methods, electroporation, in plants techniques, and the like. The term \"nucleic acids\" is synonymous with DNA, RNA, and polynucleotides. Such a plant containing the nucleic acid sequences is referred to here as an R, generation plant. Rl plants may also arise from cloning, sexual crossing or selfing of plants into which the nucleic acids have been introduced.\n\nA \"nucleic acid molecule\" or \"polynucleic acid molecule\" refers herein to deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid in all their forms, ie., single and double-stranded DNA, cDNA, mRNA, and the like.\n\nA \"double-stranded DNA molecule\" refers to the polymeric form of deoxyribonucleotides (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine) in its normal, double-stranded helix. This term refers only to the primary and secondary structure of the molecule, and does not limit it to any particular tertiary forms. Thus this term includes double-stranded DNA found, inter alia, in linear DNA molecules (eg. , restriction fragments), viruses, plasmids, and chromosomes. In discussing the structure of particular double-stranded DNA molecules, sequences may be described herein according to the normal convention of giving only the sequence in the 5' to 3' direction along the non-transcribed strand of DNA (ie., the strand having a sequence homologous to the mRNA) . A DNA sequence \"corresponds\" to an amino acid sequence if translation of the DNA sequence in accordance with the genetic code yields the amino acid sequence (ie., the DNA sequence \"encodes\" the amino acid sequence) .\n\nOne DNA sequence \"corresponds\" to another DNA sequence if the two sequences encode the same amino acid sequence.\n\nTwo DNA sequences are \"substantially similar\" when at least about 85%, preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at least about 95%, of the nucleotides match over the defined length of the DNA sequences.\n\nA \"heterologous\" region or domain of a DNA construct is an identifiable segment of DNA within a larger DNA molecule that is not found in association with the larger molecule in nature. Thus, when the heterologous region encodes a plant gene, the gene will usually be flanked by DNA that does not flank the plant genomic DNA in the genome of the source organism. Another example of a heterologous region is a construct where the coding sequence itself is not found in nature (eg., a cDNA where the genomic coding sequence contains introns, or synthetic sequences having codons different than the native gene) . Allelic variations or naturally-occurring mutational events do not give rise to a heterologous region of DNA as defined herein.\n\nA \"coding sequence\" is an in-frame sequence of codons that correspond to or encode a protein or peptide sequence. Two coding sequences correspond to each other if the sequences or their complementary sequences encode the same amino acid sequences. A coding sequence in association with appropriate regulatory sequences may be transcribed and translated into a polypeptide in vivo. A polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence will usually be located 3' to the coding sequence. Polynucleotide \"homologs\" refers to DNAs or RNAs and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form containing known analogues of natural nucleotides, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolised in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides.\n\n\"Transgenic plants\" are plants into which a nucleic acid has been introduced through recombinant techniques, eg., nucleic acid-containing vectors. A \"vector\" is a nucleic acid composition which can transduce, transform or infect a cell, thereby causing the cell to express vector-encoded nucleic acids and, optionally, proteins other than those native to the cell, or in a manner not native to the cell. A vector includes a nucleic acid (ordinarily RNA or DNA) to be expressed by the cell. A vector optionally includes materials to aid in achieving entry of the nucleic acid into the cell, such as a retroviral particle, liposome, protein coating or the like. Vectors contain nucleic acid sequences that allow their propagation and selection in bacteria or other non-plant organisms. For a description of vectors and molecular biology techniques, see Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel, et al., (eds.), Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene\n\nPublishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (through and including the 1998 Supplement) (Ausubel) .\n\n\"Plasmids\" are one type of vector which comprises DNA that is capable of replicating within a plant cell, either extra-chromosomally or as part of the plant cell chromosome (s) , and are designated by a lower case \"p\" preceded and/or followed by capital letters and/or numbers. The starting plasmids herein are commercially available, are publicly available on an unrestricted basis, or can be constructed from such available plasmids by methods disclosed herein and/or in accordance with published procedures. In certain instances, as will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled worker, other plasmids known in the art may be used interchangeably with plasmids described herein.\n\nThe phrase \"expression cassette\" refers to a nucleic acid sequence within a vector, which is to be transcribed, and a control sequence to direct the expression. The term \"control sequences\" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked nucleotide coding sequence in a particular host cell. The control sequences suitable for expression in prokaryotes, for example, include origins of replication, promoters, ribosome binding sites, and transcription termination sites. The control sequences that are suitable for expression in eukaryotes, for example, include origins of replication, promoters, ribosome-binding sites, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. One of the most important control sequences is the promoter.\n\nA \"promoter\" is an array of nucleic acid control sequences that direct transcription of a nucleic acid. As used herein, a promoter includes necessary nucleic acid sequences near the start site of transcription, such as, in the case of a polymerase II type promoter, a TATA element.\n\nA promoter also optionally includes distal enhancer or repressor elements, which can be located as much as several thousand base pairs from the start site of transcription. The promoter can either be homologous, ie., occurring naturally to direct the expression of the desired nucleic acid or heterologous, ie., occurring naturally to direct the expression of a nucleic acid derived from a gene other than the desired nucleic acid. Fusion genes with heterologous promoter sequences are desirable, eg., for regulating expression of encoded proteins. A \"constitutive\" promoter is a promoter that is active in a selected organism under most environmental and developmental conditions. An \"inducible\" promoter is a promoter that is under environmental or developmental regulation in a selected organism.\n\nExamples include promoters from plant viruses such as the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) , as described in Odell et al., (1985), Nature, 313:810-812, and promoters from genes such as rice actin (McElroy et al., 1990, Plant Cell, 163-171); maize ubiquitin (Christensen et al., (1992), Plant MoI. Biol. 12:619-632; and Christensen, et al., (1992), Plant MoI. Biol. 18:675-689); pEMU (Last, et al., (1991), Theor. Appl. Genet 81:581-588); MAS (Velten et al., (1984), EMBO J. 3:2723-2730); and maize H3 histone (Lepetit et al., (1992), MoI. Gen. Genet. 231:276-285; and Atanassvoa et al., (1992), Plant Journal 2 (3) :291-300) .\n\nAdditional regulatory elements that may be connected to the aphid transmission factor polynucleotides for expression in plant cells include terminators, polyadenylation sequences, and nucleic acid sequences encoding signal peptides that permit localisation within a plant cell or secretion of the protein from the cell. Such regulatory elements and methods for adding or exchanging these elements with the regulatory elements of the replicase gene are known, and include, but are not limited to, 3' termination and/or polyadenylation regions such as those of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase (nos) gene (Bevan et al., (1983), Nucl. Acids Res. 12:369-385); the potato proteinase inhibitor II (PINII) gene (Keil, et al., (1986), Nucl.\n\nAcids Res. 14:5641-5650; and An et al., (1989), Plant Cell 1:115-122); and the CaMV 19S gene (Mogen et al. , (1990), Plant Cell 2:1261-1272) .\n\nPlant signal sequences, including, but not limited to, signal-peptide encoding DNA/RNA sequences which target proteins to the extracellular matrix of the plant cell (Dratewka-Kos, et al., (1989), J. Biol. Chem. 264:4896- 4900), the Nicotiana plÏ mbaginifolia extension gene (DeLoose, et al., (1991), Gene 99:95-100), signal peptides which target proteins to the vacuole like the sweet potato sporamin gene (Matsuka, et al., (1991), PNAS 88:834) and the barley lectin gene (Wilkins, et al., (1990), Plant Cell, 2:301-313), signal peptides which cause proteins to be secreted such as that of PRIb (Lind, et al., (1992), Plant MoI. Biol. 18:47-53), or the barley alpha amylase (BAA) (Rahmatullah, et al. \"Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of two different genes for high-pi alpha- amylases from barley.\" Plant MoI. Biol. 12:119 (1989) and hereby incorporated by reference) , or from the present invention the signal peptide from the ESPl or BESTl gene, or signal peptides which target proteins to the plastids such as that of rapeseed enoyl-Acp reductase (Verwaert, et al., (1994), Plant MoI. Biol. 26:189-202) are- useful in the invention.\n\nFor the purposes of the present invention, the promoter sequence is bounded at its 3' terminus by the translation start codon of a coding sequence, and extends upstream to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. Within the promoter sequence will be found a transcription initiation site (conveniently defined by mapping with nuclease Sl) , as well as protein binding domains (consensus sequences) responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase.\n\nAn \"exogenous\" element is one that is foreign to the host cell, or is homologous to the host cell but in a position within the host cell in which the element is ordinarily not found.\n\n\"Digestion\" of DNA refers to the catalytic cleavage of DNA with an enzyme that acts only at certain locations in the DNA. Such enzymes are called restriction enzymes or restriction endonucleases, and the sites within DNA where such enzymes cleave are called restriction sites. If there are multiple restriction sites within the DNA, digestion will produce two or more linearized DNA fragments\n\n(restriction fragments) . The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available, and their reaction conditions, cofactors, and other requirements as established by the enzyme manufacturers are used. Restriction enzymes are commonly designated by abbreviations composed of a capital letter followed by other letters representing the microorganism from which each restriction enzyme originally was obtained and then a number designating the particular enzyme. In general, about lÎ¼g of DNA is digested with about 1-2 units of enzyme in about 20Î¼l of buffer solution. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer, and/or are well known in the art.\n\n\"Recovery\" or \"isolation\" of a given fragment of DNA from a restriction digest typically is accomplished by separating the digestion products, which are referred to as \"restriction fragments,\" on a polyacrylamide or agarose gel by electrophoresis, identifying the fragment of interest on the basis of its mobility relative to that of marker DNA fragments of known molecular weight, excising the portion of the gel that contains the desired fragment, and separating the DNA from the gel, for example by electroelution.\n\n\"Ligation\" refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double-stranded DNA fragments. Unless otherwise specified, ligation is accomplished using known buffers and conditions with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase per 0.5Î¼g of approximately equimolar amounts of the DNA fragments to be ligated. \"Oligonucleotides\" are short-length, single- or double- stranded polydeoxynucleotides that are chemically synthesized by known methods (involving, for example, triester, phosphoramidite, or phosphonate chemistry) , such as described by Engels, et al., Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 28:716-734 (1989). They are then purified, for example, by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\n\n\"Polymerase chain reaction,\" or \"PCR,\" as used herein generally refers to a method for amplification of a desired nucleotide sequence in vitro, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,683,195. In general, the PCR method involves repeated cycles of primer extension synthesis, using two oligonucleotide primers capable of hybridizing preferentially to a template nucleic acid. Typically, the primers used in the PCR method will be complementary to nucleotide sequences within the template at both ends of or flanking the nucleotide sequence to be amplified, although primers complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be amplified also may be used. Wang, et al., in PCR Protocols, pp.70-75 (Academic Press, 1990); Ochman, et al., in PCR Protocols, pp. 219-227; Triglia, et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 16:8186 (1988) .\n\n\"PCR cloning\" refers to the use of the PCR method to amplify a specific desired nucleotide sequence that is present amongst the nucleic acids from a suitable cell or tissue source, including total genomic DNA and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA. Frohman, et al. ,\n\nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 85:8998-9002 (1988); Saiki, et al., Science 239:487-492 (1988); Mullis, et al., Meth. Enzymol. 155:335-350 (1987) .\n\nFor purposes of describing the present invention, the term \"modified\" refers to an introduced alteration to a nucleic acid molecule such that, upon transcription, a \"modified RNA\" molecule is produced. The term \"modified RNA\" is used to refer to a modified form of a naturally-occurring messenger RNA sequence which cannot be completely translated compared to the unmodified, naturally-occurring form. A modified RNA may be incapable of being translated at all or it may be capable of being partially translated into an attenuated peptide corresponding to a portion of the peptide encoded by the naturally occurring messenger RNA sequence from which the modified RNA is derived.\n\nThe coding sequence for a naturally-occurring viral RNA sequence may be modified to encode a modified RNA, for example, by removing its ATG initiation codon or by utilising a portion which does not include the initiation codon. Other means for modifying RNA molecules include introducing one or more premature stop codons and/or interrupting the reading frame.\n\nThe phrase \"operably encodes\" refers to the functional linkage between a promoter and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the promoter sequence initiates transcription of RNA corresponding to the second sequence.\n\nThe term \"progeny\" refers to the descendants of a particular plant (self-cross) or pair of plants (crossed or backcrossed) . The descendants can be of the Fl, the F2, or any subsequent generation.\n\nTypically, the parents are the pollen donor and the ovule donor which are crossed to make the progeny plant of this invention.\n\nParents also refer to Fl parents of a hybrid plant of this invention (the F2 plants) . Finally, parents refer to a recurrent parent which is backcrossed to hybrid plants of this invention to produce another hybrid plant of this invention. The phrase \"producing a transgenic plant\" refers to producing a plant of this invention. The plant is generated through recombinant techniques, ie., cloning, somatic embryogenesis or any other technique used by those of skill to produce plants.\n\nThe common names of some plants used throughout this disclosure refer to varieties of plants of the following genera:\n\nCommon Name Genera\n\nWheat (soft, hard and durum varieties) Triticum\n\nSorghum Sorghum\n\nRice Oryza\n\nBarley Hordeum\n\nMaize or corn Zea\n\nRye Secale\n\nTriticale Triticale\n\nOat Avena\n\n\"Integration\" of the DNA may be effected using nonÂ¬ homologous recombination following mass transfer of DNA into the cells using microinjection, biolistics, electroporation or lipofection. Alternative methods such as homologous recombination, and or restriction enzyme mediated integration (REMI) or transposons are also encompassed, and may be considered to be improved integration methods.\n\nA \"clone\" is a population of cells derived from a single cell or common ancestor by mitosis.\n\n\"Nucleic acid sequence homologs\" refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single-or double-stranded form containing known analogues of natural nucleotides, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolised in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (eg., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer, et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19: 5081 (1991); Ohtsuka, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260: 2605- 2608 (1985); and Rossolini, et al., MoI. Cell. Probes 8: 91-98 (1994)) . The term \"nucleic acid\" is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, and mRNA encoded by a gene.\n\nThe term \"amino acid sequence homolog\" refers to a protein with a similar amino acid sequence. One of skill will realise that the critical amino acid sequence is within a functional domain of a protein. Thus, it may be possible for a homologous protein to have less than 40% homology over the length of the amino acid sequence, but greater than 90% homology in one functional domain. In addition to naturally occurring amino acids, homologs also encompass proteins in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical analog of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring proteins.\n\nAmino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.\n\n\"Conservatively modified variants\" applies to both amino' acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids that encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences.\n\nBecause of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \"silent variations,\" which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein, which encodes a polypeptide, also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognise that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid, which encodes a polypeptide, is implicit in each described sequence.\n\nAs to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognise that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence that alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \"conservatively modified variant\" where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art.\n\nThe following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another:\n\n1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T);\n\n2) Aspartic acid (D) , Glutamic acid (E) ;\n\n3) Asparagine (N) , Glutamine (Q) ;\n\n4) Arginine (R) , Lysine (K) ; 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W). (See, eg., Creighton, Proteins (1984)).\n\nAs used herein, the terms \"transformation\" and \"transfection\" refer to the process of introducing a desired nucleic acid, such a plasmid or an expression vector, into a plant cells, either in culture or in the organs of a plant by a variety of techniques used by molecular biologists. Accordingly, a cell has been \"transformed\" by exogenous DNA when such exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell wall. Exogenous DNA may or may not be integrated (covalently linked) to chromosomal DNA making up the genome of the cell. In prokaryotes and yeast, for example, the exogenous DNA may be maintained on an episomal element such as a plasmid. With respect to eukaryotic cells, a stably transformed cell is one in which the exogenous DNA is inherited by daughter cells through chromosome replication. This stability is demonstrated by the ability of the eukaryotic cell to establish cell lines or clones comprised of a population of daughter cells containing the exogenous DNA.\n\nNumerous methods for introducing foreign genes into plants are known and can be used to insert a modified nucleic acid into a plant host, including biological and physical plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki et al., (1993), \"Procedure for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants\", In: Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick and Thompson, eds., CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, pages 67-88. The methods chosen vary with the host plant, and include chemical transfection methods such as calcium phosphate, microorganism-mediated gene transfer such as Agrobacterium (Horsch, et al., (1985), Science 227:1229-31), electroporation, micro-injection, and biolistic bombardment.\n\nExpression cassettes and vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are known and available. See, for example, Gruber, et al., (1993), \"Vectors for Plant Transformation\" In: Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick and Thompson, eds. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, pages 89-119.\n\nThe most widely utilised method for introducing an expression vector into plants is based on the natural transformation system of Agrobacterium. A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes are plant pathogenic soil bacteria which genetically transform plant cells. The Ti and Ri plasmids of A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes, respectfully, carry genes responsible for genetic transformation of plants. See, for example, Kado, (1991), Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 10: 1. Descriptions of the Agrobacterium vector systems and methods for Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer are provided in Gruber et al., supra; Miki, et al., supra; and Moloney et al. , (1989), Plant Cell Reports 8:238.\n\nSimilarly, the gene can be inserted into the T-DNA region of a Ti or Ri plasmid derived from A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes, respectively. Thus, expression cassettes can be constructed as above, using these plasmids. Many control sequences are known which when coupled to a heterologous coding sequence and transformed into host organisms show fidelity in gene expression with respect to tissue/organ specificity of the original coding sequence. See, eg., Benfey, P. N., and Chua, N. H. (1989) Science 244: 174-181. Particularly suitable control sequences for use in these plasmids are promoters for constitutive leaf- specific expression of the gene in the various target plants. Other useful control sequences include a promoter and terminator from the nopaline synthase gene (NOS) . The NOS promoter and terminator are present in the plasmid pARC2, available from the American Type Culture Collection and designated ATCC 67238. If such a system is used, the virulence (vir) gene from either the Ti or Ri plasmid must also be present, either along with the T-DNA portion, or via a binary system where the vir gene is present on a separate vector. Such systems, vectors for use therein, and methods of transforming plant cells are described in\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,658,082; U.S. application Ser. No. 913,914, filed Oct. 1, 1986, as referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,306, issued Nov. 16, 1993 to Robeson, et al.; and Simpson, R. B., et al. (1986) Plant MoI. Biol. 6: 403-415 (also referenced in the '306 patent); all incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\nOnce constructed, these plasmids can be placed into A. rhizogenes or A. tumefaciens and these vectors used to transform cells of plant species, which are ordinarily susceptible to BYDV infection. Several other transgenic plants are also contemplated by the present invention including but not limited to soybean, corn, sorghum, alfalfa, rice, clover, cabbage, banana, coffee, celery, tobacco, cowpea, cotton, melon and pepper. The selection of either A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes will depend on the plant being transformed thereby. In general A. tumefaciens is the preferred organism for transformation. Most dicotyledons, some gymnosperms, and a few monocotyledons (eg. certain members of the Liliales and Arales) are susceptible to infection with A. tumefaciens. A. rhizogenes also has a wide host range, embracing most dicots and some gymnosperms, which includes members of the Leguminosae, Compositae and Chenopodiaceae. Alternative techniques, which have proven to be effective in genetically transforming plants, include particle bombardment and electroporation. See eg. Rhodes, C. A., et al. (1988) Science 240: 204-207/ Shigekawa, K. and Dower, W. J. (1988) Bio/Techniques 6: 742-751; Sanford, J. C, et al. (1987) Particulate Science & Technology 5:27-37; and McCabe, D. E. (1988) Bio/Technology 6:923-926.\n\nOnce transformed, these cells can be used to regenerate transgenic plants, capable of withstanding aphid-borne viral infection. For example, whole plants can be infected with these vectors by wounding the plant and then introducing the vector into the wound site. Any part of the plant can be wounded, including leaves, stems and roots. Alternatively, plant tissue, in the form of an explant, such as cotyledonary tissue or leaf disks, can be inoculated with these vectors and cultured under conditions, which promote plant regeneration. Roots or shoots transformed by inoculation of plant tissue with A. rhizogenes or A. tumefaciens, containing the gene coding for the aphid transmission factor, can be used as a source of plant tissue to regenerate Aphid-borne virus-resistant transgenic plants, either via somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis. Examples of such methods for regenerating plant tissue are disclosed in Shahin, E. A. (1985) Theor. Appl. Genet. 69:235-240; U.S. Pat. No. 4,658,082; Simpson, R. B., et al. (1986) Plant MoI. Biol 6: 403-415; and U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 913,913 and 913,914, both filed Oct. 1, 1986, as referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,306, issued Nov. 16, 1993 to Robeson, et al.; the entire disclosures therein incorporated herein by reference.\n\nDespite the fact that the host range for Agrobacterium- mediated transformation is broad, some major cereal crop species and gymnosperms have generally been recalcitrant to this mode of gene transfer, even though some success has recently been achieved in rice (Hiei et al., (1994), The Plant Journal 6:271-282) . Several methods of plant transformation have been developed, collectively referred to as direct gene transfer, as an alternative to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.\n\nA generally applicable method of plant transformation is microprojectile-mediated transformation, where DNA is carried on the surface of microprojectiles measuring about 1 to 4Î¼m. The expression vector is introduced into plant tissues with a biolistic device that accelerates the microprojectiles to speeds of 300 to 600m/s which is sufficient to penetrate the plant cell walls and membranes. (Sanford et al., (1987), Part. Sci. Technol. 5:27; Sanford, 1988, Trends Biotech 6:299; Sanford, (1990), Physiol.

Alternatively, liposome or spheroplast fusions have been used to introduce expression vectors into plants. See, for example, Deshayes et al., (1985), EMBO J. 4:2731; and Christou et al., (1987), PNAS USA 84:3962. Direct uptake of DNA into protoplasts, using CaCl2 precipitation, polyvinyl alcohol or poly-L-ornithine, have also been reported. See, for example, Hain 'et al., (1985), MoI. Gen. Genet. 199:161; and Draper et al., (1982), Plant Cell Physiol. 23:451.\n\nElectroporation of protoplasts and whole cells and tissues has also been described. See, for example, Donn et al.,\n\n(1990), In: Abstracts of the VIIth Int'1. Congress on Plant Cell and Tissue Culture IAPTC, A2-38, page 53; D'Halluin et al., (1992), Plant Cell 4:1495-1505; and Spencer et al.,\n\n(1994), Plant MoI. Biol. 24:51-61. Alternatively, the DNA constructs are combined with suitable T-DNA flanking regions and introduced into a conventional Agrobacterium tumefaciens host vector. The virulence functions of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens host directs the insertion of the construct and adjacent marker into the plant cell DNA when the cell is infected by the bacteria.\n\nMicroinjection techniques are known in the art and well described in the scientific and patent literature. The introduction of DNA constructs using polyethylene glycol precipitation is described in Paszkowski, et al., EMBO J. 3: 2717 (1984) . Electroporation techniques are described in Fromm, et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 5824 (1985) . Biolistic transformation techniques are described in Klein, et al., Nature 327: 70-73 (1987) .\n\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens-xÎ±edÂ±ateÎ¬ transformation techniques, including disarming and use of binary vectors, are also well described in the scientific literature. See, for example Horsch, et al., Science 233: 496-498 (1984), and Fraley, et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 4803 (1983) .\n\nOne preferred method of transforming plants of the invention is microprojectile bombardment. In this method target tissues are treated with osmoticum. Then aphid transmission factor gene DNA including modified DNA is precipitated, and coated on to tungsten or gold microparticles. The microparticles are then loaded into microprojectile or biolistic device and the treated cells are bombarded (Bower et al., 1996) .\n\nBy \"consisting essentially of\" is meant including any elements listed after the phrase, and limited to other elements that do not interfere with or contribute to the W\n\n- 36 -\n\nactivity or action specified in the disclosure for the listed elements. Thus, the phrase \"consisting essentially of\" indicates that the listed elements are required or mandatory, but that other elements are optional and may or 5 may not be present depending upon whether or not they affect the activity or action of the listed elements.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n10 All publications mentioned herein are cited for the purpose of describing and disclosing the protocols and reagents which are reported in the publications and which might be used in connection with the invention.

As discussed in the background section supra, there are about 4,000 species of aphids in the world of which about 250 are serious pests. Aphids have a world-wide distribution but there are far more species in temperate zones. Aphids are capable of carrying more than one species of virus and have more than one host plant. For example, Myzus persicae has peach as its primary host and a wide range of secondary hosts including many brassicas. M. persicae is capable of transmitting over 100 viruses including the potato leaf roll and Y viruses of potatoes, mosaic, yellow net and yellows viruses of sugar-beet, cauliflower mosaic plum pox, cucumber mosaic, lettuce mosaic, and turnip mosaic.\n\nThe pea aphid Acyrthosiphum pisum is found on many leguminous plants and transmits lucerne mosaic virus, pea leaf roll virus, pea enation mosaic virus, pea mosaic virus and pea enation mosaic virus. Cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae is a serious pest of the major cabbage crops, cabbages, cauliflowers and brussel sprouts, like the pea aphid, the cabbage aphid is a one host species spending all its life on Brassicas.\n\nGrain aphid Sitobion avenaer carrot aphid Cavariella aegopodii, groundnut aphid Aphis craccivora a polyphagus species that prefers legumes, cotton aphid Aphis gossypii a polyphagus species found in warmer regions, black citrus aphid Toxoptera aÏ rantii a polyphagus in warmer regions, willow aphid Cavariella spp. on willows, holarctic willow leaf aphids Chaitophorus spp. on willows and poplars in Europe, black pine aphids Cinara spp. on a variety of conifers widespread in America, Africa, Asia and Europe, sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoÏdes on sycamore only in Europe and North America, spruce aphids Elatobium spp. on Picea in North America and Europe.\n\nEssentially, there are many species of aphid and these aphids often have multiple host plants that they can colonate. Moreover, as each aphid is capable of carrying a number of- different viruses, most, if not all of the plants disclosed supra, are capable of being infected with aphid- borne virus. This means that while the complete process of virus infection is not known there are many factors common to these species of plant and viruses. For example, while most of the constructs disclosed herein comprise an aphid transmission factor gene isolated from barley yellow dwarf virus, homologs of the aphid transmission factor gene from barley yellow dwarf virus are present in many viruses.\n\nThe aphid transmission factor genes are present in all plants that are infected with aphid-borne virus. All of the plants described supra can be infected by aphid-borne viruses. For example, aphid-borne viruses that are known to infect one or more of the plants listed supra include alpinia mosaic virus; andean potato mottle virus; apple mosaic virus; arabis mosaic virus; arracacha virus b; artichoke aegean ringspot virus; artichoke vein banding virus; asparagus virus; barley mild mosaic virus; barley yellow dwarf virus (subgroups i & ii) ; barley yellow mosaic virus; bean common mosaic virus; bean leaf roll virus; bean pod mottle virus; bean yellow mosaic virus; beet mild yellowing virus; beet western yellows virus; beet yellow net virus; blueberry shock virus; broad bean mottle virus; broad bean stain virus; broad bean true mosaic virus; broad bean wilt virus; brome streak mosaic virus; cardamom mosaic virus; carrot red lea virus; carrot thin leaf virus; cassava American latent virus; cassia yellow blotch virus/ celery yellow spot virus; cereal yellow dwarf virus; cherry leaf roll virus; cherry rasp leaf virus; chickpea stunt virus; chicory yellow mottle virus; citrus enation (woody gall) virus; citrus mosaic virus; clover yellow vein virus; cotton anthocyanosis virus; cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus; cowpea chlorotic mottle virus; cowpea green vein banding virus; cowpea mosaic virus; cowpea stunt virus; cucumber mosaic virus; cucumber vein yellowing virus; cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus; elm mottle virus; enamovirus; filaree red leaf virus; grapevine ajinashika virus; grapevine fanleaf virus; groundnut rosette assistor virus; hibiscus latent ringspot virus; Indonesian soybean dwarf virus; lamium mild mosaic virus; legume yellows virus; lettuce mosaic virus; maclura mosaic virus; maize dwarf mosaic virus; malva yellow virus; Michigan alfalfa virus; milk vetch dwarf virus; millet red leaf virus; narcissus latent virus; navel orange infectious mottling virus; oat mosaic virus; olive latent ringspot virus; papaya ringspot virus; patchouli mild mosaic virus; pea enation mosaic virus; pea green mottle virus; pea leaf roll virus; pea seed-borne mosaic virus; peach rosette mosaic virus; peanut mottle virus; pepper mottle virus; peru tomato mosaic virus; physalis mild chlorosis virus; physalis vein blotch virus; plum pox virus; pokeweed mosaic virus; potato black ringspot virus; potato leaf roll virus; potato virus a; potato virus u; potato virus v; potato virus y; prune dwarf virus; prunus necrotic ringspot virus; radish mosaic virus; raspberry leaf curl virus; raspberry ringspot virus; red clover mottle virus; rice necrosis mosaic virus; ryegrass mosaic virus/ shallot yellow stripe virus; solanum yellow virus; sorghum mosaic virus; soybean dwarf virus; spinach latent virus; squash mosaic virus; strawberry latent ringspot virus/ strawberry mild yellow edge virus; subterranean clover red lea virus/ sweet potato latent virus; sweet potato mild mottle virus/ sweet potato yellow dwarf virus/ tamarillo mosaic virus/ telfairia mosaic virus/ tobacco etch virus; tobacco necrotic dwarf virus; tobacco streak virus; tobacco vein distorting virus/ tobacco yellow net virus/ tobacco yellow vein assistor virus/ tomato ringspot virus/ tomato top necrosis virus/ tomato yellow virus/ turnip mild yellows virus/ turnip yellow virus/ turnip mosaic virus/ watermelon mosaic virus/ wheat spindle streak mosaic virus/ wheat streak mosaic virus / wheat yellow mosaic virus./ wild potato mosaic virus; yam mosaic virus and zucchini yellow mosaic virus.\n\nIn particular, viruses of the luteovirus family have aphid transmission factor genes that share high degrees of sequence homology. Table 1 shows the aphid transmission factor gene from different luteoviruses, in which it can be seen that a significant degree of homology exists.\n\nC = coat P3 and systemic movement/aphid transmission P5 fusion protein [Bean leafroll virus]\n\nD = 0RF5 is translated from ORF3 by read-through ~ read-through domain (RTD) read-through product [Soybean dwarf virus] E = Aphid transmission P5 [Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV] F = read through protein [Potato leafroll virus]\n\nTherefore, although the present specification provides experimental evidence in respect of one species of monocotyledon plant and an aphid transmission factor gene derived from barley yellow dwarf virus, it will be clearly appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the transgenic plant of the invention may be any monocotyledonous plant and the aphid transmission factor gene may be from any aphid-borne virus.\n\nThe term \"transgene\" as used herein refers to any polynucleotide sequence, which codes for either an untranslatable or translatable aphid transmission factor polypeptide, which is introduced into the genome of a monocotyledonous plant cell by experimental manipulations. The transgene may be an \"endogenous DNA sequence,\" or a \"heterologous DNA sequence\" (ie., \"foreign DNA\"). The term \"endogenous DNA sequence\" refers to a nucleotide sequence which is naturally found in the cell into which it is introduced so long as it does not contain some modification (eg. , a point mutation, the presence of a selectable marker gene, etc.) relative to the naturally-occurring sequence. The term \"heterologous DNA sequence\" refers to a nucleotide sequence which is ligated to, or is manipulated to become ligated to, a nucleic acid sequence to which it is not ligated in nature, or to which it is ligated at a different location in nature. Heterologous DNA is not endogenous to the cell into which it is introduced, but has been obtained from another cell. Heterologous DNA also includes an endogenous DNA sequence which contains some modification. Generally, although not necessarily, heterologous DNA encodes RNA and proteins that are not normally produced by the cell into which it is expressed. Examples of heterologous DNA include mutated wild-type genes (ie., wild-type genes that have been modified such that they are no longer wild-type genes) , reporter genes, transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences, selectable marker proteins (eg., proteins which confer drug resistance), etc.\n\nThus, once an appropriate monocotyledonous host plant has been identified as discussed above, a transgene is constructed which comprises one or more aphid transmission factor polynucleotides or functionally active fragemtns thereof. The term \"functionally active,\" when used in reference to the aphid transmission factor polynucleotides of the present invention, refers to the paradigm in which an alteration to a nucleotide sequence does not necessarily affect the sequences ability to code for a polypeptide capable of performing substantially the same function as the unaltered \"parent\" polypeptide. For example, a nucleotide sequence may be truncated, elongated, or mutated in such a way that the polypeptide coded by the nucleotide sequence differs from the \"parent\" sequence, but still codes for a polypeptide that is capable of functioning in a substantially similar way to the \"\"parent\" molecule. Consequently, a functionally active derivative, analog, homolog or variant of the aphid transmission factor polynucleotide of the present invention will have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the nucleotide sequences shown in Figure 1 or Figure 2, but the polypeptide coded for by the functionally active derivative, analog, homolog or variant is capable of displaying one or more known functional activities associated with the aphid transmission factor polypeptides. Such modifications may be deliberate, as by site-directed mutagenesis, or may be spontaneous.\n\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a functionally active derivative, analog, homolog or variant of the aphid transmission factor polynucleotide of the present invention can vary substantially outside regions of importance eg receptor binding sites; however, regions of high sequence conservation between aphid transmission factor polynucleotides isolated from different virus species are likely to code for important regions such as receptor binding sites and the like. Accordingly, it is likely that mutations in these highly conserved regions will not generate functionally active derivatives, analogs, homologs or variants. For example, the conserved nucleotide sequences shown in Table 1 are likely to remain unchanged unless the changes are extremely conservative.\n\nSequences that are substantially similar can be identified in a Southern hybridisation experiment, for example under high, medium or low stringency conditions as defined for that particular system. Defining appropriate hybridisation conditions is within the skill of the art. See eg., Sambrook et al., DNA Cloning, vols. I, II and III. Nucleic Acid Hybridization. However, ordinarily, \"stringent conditions\" for hybridisation or annealing of nucleic acid molecules are those that\n\n(1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example, 0.015M NaCl/0.0015M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 500C, or\n\n(2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent such as formamide, for example, 50% (vol/vol) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/5OmM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 75OmM NaCl, 75mM sodium citrate at 42Â°C.\n\nAn example of medium stringency conditions for hybridisation is the use of 50% formamide, 5 X SSC (0.75M NaCl, 0.075M sodium citrate), 5OmM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5 X Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50Î¼g/mL), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42Â°C, with washes at 42Â°C in 0.2 X SSC and 0.1% SDS.\n\nBy way of further example, and not intended as limiting, low stringency conditions include those described by Shilo and Weinberg in 1981 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:6789- 6792) . When filters containing DNA are treated using these conditions they are usually pre-treated for 6h at 4O0C in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5 X SSC, 5OmM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500Î¼g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridisations are carried out in the same solution with the following modifications: 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA, lOOÎ¼g/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate, and 5-20 X 106 cpm 32P-labeled probe is used. Filters are incubated in hybridisation mixture for 18-2Oh at 400C, and then washed for 1.5h at 55Â°C in a solution containing 2 X SSC, 25mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The wash solution is replaced with fresh solution and incubated an additional 1.5h at 600C. Filters are blotted dry and exposed for autoradiography. If necessary, filters are washed for a third time at 65-68Â°C and re-exposed to film. Other conditions of low stringency, which may be used are well known in the art (eg., as employed for cross-species hybridisations) .\n\nThe aphid transmission factor polynucleotides, functionally active derivatives, analogs or variants of the invention can be produced by various methods known in the art. For example, cloned aphid transmission factor polynucleotides can be modified by any of numerous strategies known in the art (See, for example, Maniatis, T., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) . The sequence can be cleaved at appropriate sites with restriction endonuclease (s) , followed by further enzymatic modification if desired, isolated, and ligated in vitro.\n\nAdditionally, the aphid transmission factor encoding polynucleotide sequences can be mutated in vitro or in vivo, to create or destroy functional regions or create variations in functional regions and/or form new restriction endonuclease sites or destroy pre-existing ones, to facilitate further in vitro modification. Any technique for mutagenesis known in the art can be used, including, but not limited to, chemical mutagenesis, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (Hutchinson et al., 1978, J. Biol. Chem 253:6551) .\n\nAlternatively, polynucleotide variants of the aphid transmission factor polynucleotides may result from degenerate codon substitutions or complementary sequences. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer, et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19: 5081 (1991); Ohtsuka, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260: 2605-2608 (1985) ; and Rossolini, et al. , MoI. Cell. Probes 8: 91-98 (1994)) . Alternatively, a variant may be a polynucleotide which is substantially similar to SEQ ID NO: 1 (Figure 1), or in which one or more nucleotides have been added, deleted or substituted, at the 3' and/or 5' end(s) of the polynucleotide, or within the polynucleotide.\n\nIn one embodiment, the aphid transmission factor polynucleotides are double-stranded DNA molecules having at least 85% nucleotide sequence identity with SEQ ID NO 1. Once the appropriate transgene has been identified and either isolated or constructed, it is incorporated into an expression vector by standard techniques. Accordingly, the present invention also contemplates an expression vector comprising the transgene of the present invention. Thus, in one embodiment an expression vector is constructed which comprises an isolated and purified DNA molecule comprising a promoter operably linked to the coding region for the untranslatable aphid transmission factor, which coding region is operatively linked to a transcription-terminating region, whereby the promoter drives the transcription of the coding region. The coding region may include a segment or sequence encoding the untranslatable aphid transmission factor. The DNA molecule comprising the expression vector may also contain a plant intron, and may also contain other plant elements such as sequences encoding untranslated sequences (UTL's) and sequences which act as enhancers of transcription or translation.\n\nPreferred plant transformation vectors include, but are not limited to, those derived from a Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, as well as those disclosed, eg., by Herrera-Estrella (1983), Bevan (1983), Klee (1985) and Eur. Pat. Appl. No. EP 0120516 (each specifically incorporated herein by reference) .\n\nAs the expression vectors of the present invention are preferably used to transform a monocotyledonous plant, a promoter is selected that has the ability to drive expression in that particular species of plant. Promoters that function in different plant species are also well known in the art. Promoters useful in expressing the polypeptide in plants are those which are inducible, viral, synthetic, or constitutive as described (Odell et al., 1985) , and/or temporally regulated, spatially regulated, and spatio-temporally regulated. Preferred promoters include the enhanced CaMV35S promoters, and the FMV35S promoter.\n\nThe expression of a gene which exists in double-stranded DNA form localised to the plant nuclear genome involves transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the coding strand of the DNA by an RNA polymerase enzyme, and the subsequent processing of the mRNA primary transcript inside the nucleus. Transcription of DNA into mRNA is regulated by a region of DNA referred to as the \"promoter\". The DNA comprising the promoter is represented by a sequence of bases that signals RNA polymerase to associate with the DNA and to initiate the transcription of mRNA using one of the DNA strands as a template to make a corresponding strand of RNA. The particular promoter selected should be capable of causing sufficient transciption of the aphid transmission factor coding sequence to result in the substantial protection from viral infection in the resultant plant by the aphid-borne virus associated with the particular aphid transmission factor.\n\nAphid transmission factor polynucleotides of the present invention can be driven by a variety of promoters in plant tissues. Promoters can be near-constitutive (ie. they drive transcription of the transgene in all tissue) , such as the CaMV35S promoter, the 1'-or 2 ' -promoter derived from T-DNA of Agrobacterium tumafaciens, or tissue-specific or developmentally specific. Enhanced or duplicate versions of the CaMV35S and FMV35S promoters are particularly useful in the practice of this invention (Kay et al., 1987; Rogers, U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,619) .\n\nAlternatively, the plant promoter may be under environmental control. Such promoters are referred to here as Î»Î»inducible\" promoters. Examples of environmental conditions that may effect transcription by inducible promoters include pathogen attack, anaerobic conditions, or the presence of light.\n\nPreferably, a promoter that is capable of directing strong expression is used. Such promoters include, but are not limited to, the maize ubiquitin promoter described in Christensen and Quail (1996) , the rice actin promoter as described in McElroy D, Blowers AD Jenes B and Wu R (1991), the commelina yellow mottle promoter as described in Medberry SL, Lockhart BEL and Olszewskine (1992) . Those skilled in the art will recognise that there are a number of promoters, which are active in plant cells, and have been described in the literatur"
