The document discusses the history and culture of calla lilies (Zantedeschia species). It describes the taxonomy and native range of calla lilies. Research since the 1980s has focused on developing calla lilies as potted flowering plants. Breeding programs have produced many hybrid cultivars for cut flowers and potted plants through crosses within and between calla lily species. Current breeding selects for traits suitable for potted plants or cut flowers.",
