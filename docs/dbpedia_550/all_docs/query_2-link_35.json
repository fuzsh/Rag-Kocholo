        "text": "Calla lilies (Zantedeschia spp.), aroid plant species native to moist places of southern Africa, comprise commercially significant cut flowers. At present, these ornamental species belonging to the Araceae family consist of a multitude of cultivars that make significant contributions to floriculture industries. Each plant has an underground tuberous rhizome and bears a typical inflorescence consisting of a funnel-shaped spathe surrounding a central spadix. This leaf-like organ is responsible for the wide range of colours displayed by Zantedeschia cultivars. Economic interests in the production of hybrid cultivars have imposed improvement programs, not only for increasing resistance to the significant soft rot disease, but also for improving flowering and inflorescence development. Floral spathe development of the only one evergreen species-Zantedeschia aethiopica-has been well studied. The floral bud spathe undergoes a whitening process, which leads to its death when fructification does not occur. Contrarily, spathe whitening is inhibited and regreening is observed. It was shown that in spathe cells that undergo regreening, dramatic changes occur, namely the chloroplasts and peroxisomes restructuration, resulting in the re-acquisition of photosynthetic and photorespiratory capacities. Although less importance has been given to spathe whitening, recent reports considered this process as being a natural senescence-like process. The use of Z. aethiopica spathe development as a natural model for studying senescence may be valuable because the same organ undergoes senescence and self-inhibition of senescence after fructification, allowing the understanding of regulatory aspects of this developmental process."
