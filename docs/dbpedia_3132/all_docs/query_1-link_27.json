        "text": "The information in this article is part of an upcoming rework, and may not be reflected in other articles.\n\nDavid Lloyd George is a British politician, former statesmen and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1916 and 1919. A prominent Liberal and Welsh firebrand politician during the latter period of the 19th Century and pre-Weltkrieg years, Lloyd George rose to a special prominence at the beginning of the war due to his anti-German rhetoric, in rejection to his prior reluctance for war. In 1916 he proposed his controversial \"knock-out policy\", i.e. fighting until the end, despite American offers of mediation. In late 1916, he managed to oust the overchallenged H. H. Asquith and became Prime Minister himself, but he would suffer an immense fall from grace when his efforts to win the war failed due to the collapse of France, forcing the Allies to sign the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nIn the post-war period Lloyd George ended up as a political pariah, leading the almost entirely irrelevant National Liberal Party until 1921. Following the beginning of the British Revolution, Lloyd George would disappear without a trace, widely suspected as fleeing to mainland Europe, with his exact fate still unknown. Lloyd George's legacy is controversial with academics acknowledging his many achievements, notably holding the title of being the country's only native Welsh speaker to ever be Prime Minister, these would be overshadowed by his loss in the Weltkrieg and greater attention giving to his various scandals.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nDavid Lloyd George was born on 17 January 1863 in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester, to Welsh parents and was brought up as a Welsh-speaker. His father, William George, had been a teacher in both London and Liverpool. In March of the same year, on account of his failing health, William George returned with his family to his native Pembrokeshire. He took up farming but died in June 1864 of pneumonia, aged 44. His widow, Elizabeth George (1828–96), sold the farm and moved with her children to her native Llanystumdwy in Caernarfonshire, where she lived in a cottage known as Highgate with her brother Richard Lloyd (1834–1917), who was a shoemaker, a minister (in the Scottish Baptists and then the Church of Christ), and a strong Liberal.\n\nLloyd George was educated at the local Anglican school Llanystumdwy National School and later under tutors. Lloyd George's uncle was a towering influence on him, encouraging him to take up a career in law and enter politics; his uncle remained influential up until his death at age 83 in February 1917, by which time his nephew had become prime minister. He added his uncle's surname to become \"Lloyd George\". His surname is usually given as \"Lloyd George\" and sometimes as \"George\". The influence of his childhood showed through in his entire career, as he claimed he attempted to aid the common man at the expense of what he liked to call \"the Dukes\" (that is, the aristocracy); however, British historians have argued that Lloyd George's childhood was nowhere near as poverty-stricken as he liked to suggest.\n\nRaised as a devout Evangelical, he would abandon his religious beliefs as a young man and is widely believed to have become a Deist. Around this time he would become interested in land ownership and take an interest in pamphlets published by the Fabian Society on the issue as well as Henry George. The latter would go onto strongly influence the young man's future politics. He would train as a solicitor in Portmadoc before setting up his own practice in 1885 and establishing branch offices in the surrounding towns. In the same year he would become active in Liberal politics, campainging for the party in the 1885 General Election after being attracted to Joseph Chamberlain's 'unauthorised programme' of reforms. The issue of Irish Home Rule would split the party following the election's stalemate and he would opt to support Chamberlain, believing his 'federal solution' was correct.\n\nIn 1888 he would marry Margaret Owens, daughter of a local farming family, and in that year, he and other young Welsh Liberals founded a monthly paper Udgorn Rhyddid (Bugle of Freedom). They also won the Llanfrothen burial case, which established the right of Nonconformists to be buried according to their own denominational rites in parish burial grounds, a right given by the Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880 but which had up to then been ignored by the Anglican clergy. On Lloyd George's advice, a Baptist burial party broke open a gate to a cemetery which had been locked against them by the vicar. The vicar sued them for trespass and the local judge misrecorded the jury's verdict and found in his favour, awakening suspicions of bias by the local Tory landowning class. Lloyd George's clients won on appeal to the Divisional Court of Queen's Bench in London, where Lord Chief Justice Coleridge found in their favour. This case, which was hailed as a great victory throughout Wales, led to his adoption as the Liberal candidate for Carnarvon Boroughs on 27 December 1888. At that time he appeared to be trying to create a separate Welsh national party modelled on Parnell's Irish Parliamentary Party and worked towards a union of the North and South Wales Liberal Federations.\n\nEarly Politics[]\n\nLloyd George was returned as Liberal MP for Carnarvon Boroughs – by a margin of 18 votes – in the by-election on 10 April 1890, following the death of the Conservative member Edmund Swetenham. He sat with an informal grouping of Welsh Liberal members who had a programme of disestablishing and disendowing the Church of England in Wales, temperance reform, and Welsh home rule. He would remain an MP for the same constituency until 1919, 29 years later.\n\nAs backbench members of the House of Commons were not paid at that time, he supported himself and his growing family by continuing to practise as a solicitor, opening an office in London under the name of 'Lloyd George and Co.' and continuing in partnership with his brother in Criccieth. In 1897, he merged his growing London practice with that of Arthur Rhys Roberts under the name of 'Lloyd George, Roberts and Co.'. Around this time he served as the legal adviser of Theodor Herzl in his negotiations with the British government regarding the Uganda Scheme, proposed as an alternative homeland for the Jews due to Turkish refusal to grant a charter for Jewish settlement in Palestine.\n\nDuring this time he would mostly campaign on Welsh and Liberal issues, such as temperance and disestablishment of the Church of England. He would also be seen as a 'Little Englander' for his open and vehement opposition to the Second Boer War, a policy that gained him national fame. George was not one by definition as he was not an opponent of the Empire but believed it had to be based 'on freedom' including for India, rather than 'racial arrogance'. He would also oppose the Education Act of 1902 due to its funding of Church of England schools and while the bill would pass, it's opposition would reunite the Liberals and marked him as a future pick for Liberal cabinets.\n\nEntering the Cabinet and the People's Budget[]\n\nIn 1905, Lloyd George entered the new Liberal Cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman as President of the Board of Trade. His first priority on taking office was repeal of the 1902 Education Act. Lloyd George took the lead along with Augustine Birrell, President of the Board of Education and they began drafting a new bill/ The bill passed the House of Commons greatly amended, but was completely mangled by the House of Lords. For the rest of the year, Lloyd George made numerous public speeches attacking the House of Lords for mutilating the bill with wrecking amendments, in defiance of the Liberals' electoral mandate to reform the 1902 Act. Lloyd George was rebuked by King Edward VII for these speeches: the Prime Minister defended him to the King's secretary Francis Knollys, stating that his behaviour in Parliament was more constructive but that in speeches to the public \"the combative spirit seems to get the better of him\". No compromise was possible and the bill was abandoned, allowing the 1902 Act to continue in effect. As a result of Lloyd George's lobbying, a separate department for Wales was created within the Board of Education. During his time as President of the Board of Trade his main achievement was stopping a proposed rail strike and making breakthroughs in industrial reconciliation.\n\nOn Campbell-Bannerman's death he succeeded Asquith, who had become prime minister, as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1908 to 1915. While he continued some work from the Board of Trade - for example, legislation to establish the Port of London Authority and to pursue traditional Liberal programmes such as licensing law reforms - his first major trial in this role was over the 1908–1909 Naval Estimates. The Liberal manifesto at the 1906 general election included a commitment to reduce military expenditure. Lloyd George strongly supported this but a campaign by the Conservatives would see his defeat and the adoption of estimates including provision for eight dreadnoughts. During this period he was also a target of protest by the women's suffrage movement, as he professed support personally but did not move for changes within the Parliament process.\n\nIn 1909, Lloyd George introduced his People's Budget, imposing a 20% tax on the unearned increase in value of land, payable at death of the owner or sale of the land, and ½ d. on undeveloped land and minerals, increased death duties, a rise in income tax, and the introduction of Supertax on income over £3,000. There were taxes also on luxuries, alcohol, and tobacco, so that money could be made available for the new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. The nation's landowners (well represented in the House of Lords) were intensely angry at the new taxes, mostly at the proposed very high tax on land values, but also because the instrumental redistribution of wealth could be used to detract from an argument for protective tariffs. The budget would be vetoed by the Conservative dominated House of Lords sparking a constitutional crisis. With the 1910 election seeing a slight Liberal victory, the 1909 budget would be passed and the Parliament Act of 1911 would see the Lords' power reduced.\n\nAlthough old-age pensions had already been introduced by Asquith as Chancellor, Lloyd George was largely responsible for the introduction of state financial support for the sick and infirm (known colloquially as \"going on the Lloyd George\" until 1919) legislation referred to as the Liberal Reforms. Lloyd George also succeeded in putting through Parliament his National Insurance Act 1911, making provision for sickness and invalidism, and a system of unemployment insurance. He was helped in his endeavours by forty or so backbenchers who regularly pushed for new social measures, often voted with Labour MPs. These social reforms in Britain were the beginnings of a welfare state and fulfilled the aim of dampening down the demands of the growing working class for rather more radical solutions to their impoverishment. Under his leadership after 1909 the Liberals extended minimum wages to farm workers.\n\nIn 1913, Lloyd George, along with Rufus Isaacs, the Attorney General, was involved in the Marconi scandal. Accused of speculating in Marconi shares on the inside information that they were about to be awarded a key government contract (which would have caused them to increase in value), he told the House of Commons that he had not speculated in the shares of \"that company\". He had in fact bought shares in the American Marconi Company.\n\nBy 1914, the Church of England no longer had majority adherence in most parts of Wales in preference to Wales-led Protestantism, in particular Calvinistic Methodism. Lloyd George had long called for disestablishment and was instrumental in introducing the Welsh Church Act 1914 which disestablished the Anglican Church in Wales (though, upon the outbreak of war, the actual coming into force of the Act was postponed by the Suspensory Act 1914), removing the opportunity of the six Welsh Bishops in the new Church in Wales to sit in the House of Lords and removing (disendowing) certain pre-1662 property rights.\n\nThe Weltkrieg, The Ministry of Munitions and Ministry of War[]\n\nLike much of the British political establishment, Lloyd-George was shocked by the outbreak of war. On the eve of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia, he made a speech advocating \"economy\" in the House of Commons, saying that Britain's relations with Germany were better than for many years. Later in July he told C. P. Scott of the Manchester Guardian that Britain would keep out of the impending war. With the Cabinet divided, and most ministers reluctant for Britain to get involved, he struck Asquith as \"statesmanlike\" at the Cabinet meeting on 1 August, favouring keeping Britain's options open. In the following days it was suspected he would resign from the cabinet but after learning that Belgium would resist Germany's demand for passage for her army across her soil he was deeply moved. In a major change, he would be a major interventionist figure and be instrumental in convincing more pacifist ministers to support the war on the principle of the rights of small nations.\n\nLloyd George remained in office as Chancellor of the Exchequer for the first year of the Weltkrieg. The budget of 17 November 1914 had to allow for lower taxation receipts because of the reduction in world trade. The Crimean and Boer Wars had largely been paid for out of taxation; but Lloyd George raised debt financing of £321 million. Large (albeit deferred) increases in Supertax and income tax rates were accompanied by increases in excise duties, and the budget produced a tax increase of £63 million in a full year. His last budget, on 4 May 1915, showed a growing concern for the effects of alcohol on the war effort, with large increases in duties, and a scheme of state control of alcohol sales in specified areas. The excise proposals were opposed by Irish Nationalists and the Conservatives, and were abandoned.\n\nEarly in the war, Lloyd George gained a heroic reputation with his energetic work as Minister of Munitions, setting the stage for his move up to the height of power. After a long struggle with the War Office, he wrested responsibility for arms production away from army generals, making it a purely industrial department, with considerable expert assistance from Walter Runciman. The two men gained the respect of Liberal cabinet colleagues for improving administrative capabilities, and increasing outputs. When the Shell Crisis of 1915 dismayed public opinion with the news that the Army was running short of artillery shells, demands rose for strong leadership. In the first coalition ministry, formed in May 1915, Lloyd George was made Minister of Munitions, heading a new department. The Ministry broke through the cumbersome bureaucracy of the War Office, resolved labour problems, rationalised the supply system and dramatically increased production. Within a year it became the largest buyer, seller, and employer in Britain. Though British historians have questioned to what extent this was purely Lloyd-George's work, arguing that much of it was due to reforms already underway.\n\nFrom early 1915, Lloyd George would attempt to involve himself in the War's progress, being dissatisfied with its current conduct. To this end, he would repeatedly clash with General Robertson, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and put forward his own ambitious plans such as sending troops to the Balkans to bring Greece into the war. In the same year he would announce his support for general conscription, an issue that severely split the Liberals and would manage to convince Lord Kitchener to establish a Welsh Division and accept non-conformist army chaplains.\n\nThe following year, with Kitchener's death, Lloyd George would ascend to the position as Secretary of State for War though he had little control over strategy. In his new position, he told journalists that 'the fight must be to a finish – to a knockout' in a direct repudiation of President Woodrow Wilson's offer to mediate. Lloyd George was increasingly frustrated at the limited gains of the Somme Offensive, criticising General Haig to Ferdinand Foch on a visit to the Western Front in September (British casualty ratios were worse than those of the French), proposing sending Robertson on a mission to Russia (he refused to go), and demanding that more troops be sent to Salonika to help Romania. Robertson eventually threatened to resign. Much of the press still argued that the professional leadership of Haig and Robertson was preferable to civilian interference which had led to disasters like Gallipoli and so multiple press barons threatened to 'break' Lloyd George should he continue his attempts to interfere in strategy. He asserted his right to express his opinions about strategy in November, by which time ministers had taken to holding meetings to which Robertson was not invited.\n\nThe Lloyd George Ministry Part I (1916 - 1917)[]\n\nThe weakness of Asquith as a planner and organiser was increasingly apparent to senior officials. After Asquith had refused, then agreed, and then refused again to agree to Lloyd George's demand that he should be allowed to chair a small committee to manage the war, he resigned in December 1916. Lloyd George became prime minister, with the nation demanding he take vigorous charge of the war.\n\nAfter December 1916 Lloyd George relied on the support of Conservatives and of the press baron Lord Northcliffe (who owned both The Times and the Daily Mail). Besides the Prime Minister, the five-member War Cabinet contained three Conservatives (Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords Lord Curzon, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons Bonar Law, and Minister without Portfolio Lord Milner) and Arthur Henderson, unofficially representing Labour. Edward Carson was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, but excluded from the War Cabinet. Amongst the few Liberal frontbenchers to support Lloyd George were Christopher Addison (who had played an important role in drumming up some backbench Liberal support for Lloyd George), H. A. L. Fisher, Lord Rhondda and Sir Albert Stanley. Edwin Montagu and Winston Churchill joined the government in the summer of 1917. Now in charge, Lloyd George wanted to make the destruction of Ottoman Empire a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of Jerusalem, to impress British public opinion.\n\nLloyd George engaged almost constantly in intrigues calculated to reduce the power of the generals, including trying to subordinate British forces in France to the French General Nivelle. He backed Nivelle because he thought he had \"proved himself to be a Man\" by his successful counterattacks at Verdun, and because of his promises that he could break the German lines in 48 hours. Despite his gambit, Lloyd George's attempts would fall through following the end of the Nivelle offensive where Field Marshal Haig would gain prestige and Lloyd George would further poison his relationship with the British generals.\n\nWith German submarine warfare wreaking havoc with British shipping, Lloyd George set up a Ministry of Shipping under Sir Joseph Maclay, a Glasgow shipowner who was not, until after he left office, a member of either House of Parliament, and housed in a wooden building in a specially drained lake in St James's Park, within a few minutes' walk from the Admiralty. Leo Chiozza Money was soon after appointed Junior Minister as Lloyd George felt he would compliment Maclay. In accordance with a pledge Lloyd George had given in December 1916 nearly 90% of Britain's merchant shipping tonnage was soon brought under state control (previously less than half had been controlled by the Admiralty), whilst remaining privately owned (similar measures were in force at the time for the railways). Merchant shipping was concentrated, largely on Chiozza Money's initiative, on the transatlantic route where it could more easily be protected, instead of being spread out all over the globe. These reforms would run parallel to Lloyd George's interest in establish naval convoys, which despite being initially beaten down by the admiralty, would eventually be put into place to mass success.\n\nLloyd George welcomed the Fall of the Tsar, both in a private letter to his brother and in a message to the new Russian Prime Minister Prince Lvov, not least as the war could now be portrayed as a clash between liberal governments and the autocratic Central Powers. Like many observers he had been taken by surprise by the exact timing of the revolution (it had not been predicted by Lord Milner or General Wilson on their visit to Russia a few weeks earlier) and hoped – albeit with some concerns – that Russia's war effort would be invigorated like that of France in the early 1790s.\n\nLloyd George gave a cautious welcome to the suggestion (19 March on the western calendar) by the Russian Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov that the toppled Tsar and his family be given sanctuary in Britain (although Lloyd George would have preferred that they go to a neutral country). From the very start the King's adviser Stamfordham raised objections, and in April the British government withdrew its consent under Royal pressure. Eventually the Russian Royal Family were moved to the Urals where they were executed in 1918. Lloyd George was often blamed for the refusal of asylum, with the involvement of King George V.\n\nLloyd George set up a War Policy Committee (himself, Curzon, Milner, Law and Smuts, with Maurice Hankey as secretary) to discuss strategy following on from the establishment of the Imperial War Cabinet, which held 16 meetings over the next six weeks. At the very first meeting Lloyd George proposed helping the Italians to capture Trieste, explicitly telling the War Policy Committee that he 'wanted Italian soldiers to be killed rather than British'. Later on, Field Marshal Haig would propose that a Flanders Offensive would have good chance of clearing the Belgian coast, from which German submarines and destroyers were operating, and that victory at Ypres 'might quite possibly lead to German collapse'. Robertson was less optimistic, but preferred Britain to keep her focus on defeating Germany on the Western Front, and had told Haig that the politicians would not 'dare' overrule both soldiers if they gave the same advice. Haig promised he had no 'intention of entering into a tremendous offensive involving heavy losses\" whilst Robertson wanted to avoid 'disproportionate loss'. The Flanders Offensive was reluctantly sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition it did not degenerate into a long drawn-out fight like the Somme. The War Cabinet promised to monitor progress and casualties and, if necessary call a halt.\n\nThe Third Battle of Ypres began on 31 July, but soon became bogged down in unseasonably early wet weather, which turned much of the battlefield into barely passable swamp in which men and animals sometimes drowned, whilst the mud and rain severely reduced the accuracy and effectiveness of artillery. Lloyd George tried to enlist the King for diverting efforts against Austria-Hungary, telling Stamfordham that the King and Prime Minister were 'joint trustees of the nation' who had to avoid waste of manpower. A new Italian offensive began, but Robertson advised that it was 'false strategy' to call off Ypres to send reinforcements to Italy, and despite being summoned to George Riddell's home in Sussex, where he was served apple pudding (his favourite dish), agreed only reluctantly. The Anglo-French leadership agreed in early September to send 100 heavy guns to Italy (50 of them French) rather than the 300 which Lloyd George wanted – Lloyd George talked of ordering a halt to Ypres, but in Hankey's words 'funked it' . Had he not done so his government might have fallen, for as soon as the guns reached Italy Cadorna called off his offensive.\n\nAt a meeting at Boulogne Lloyd George broached with Painlevé the setting up of an Allied Supreme War Council. Lloyd George and Robertson met Haig in France to discuss the recent German peace feelers (which in the end were publicly repudiated by Chancellor Michaelis) and the progress of the offensive. Haig preferred to continue, encouraged by Plumer's recent successful attacks in dry weather at Menin Road and Polygon Wood, and stating that the Germans were 'very worn out'. In October the wet weather returned for the final attack towards Passchendaele. At the final meeting of the War Policy Committee on 11 October 1917, Lloyd George authorised the offensive to continue. Hankey 21 October claimed in his diary that Lloyd George had deliberately allowed Passchendaele to continue to discredit Haig and Robertson and make it easier for him to forbid similar offensives in 1918. Following the disastrous Italian defeat at Caparetto, Lloyd George privately declared he intended to use the defeat in an advantage to 'to gain 'control of the War'. Soon after, the Supreme War Council was inaugurated at the Rapallo Conference.\n\nA Manpower Committee was set up on 6 December 1917, consisting of the Prime Minister, Curzon, Carson, George Barnes and Smuts with Maurice Hankey as secretary, and Auckland Geddes (Minister of National Service – in charge of Army recruitment) in regular attendance. The first meeting of the Manpower Committee was on 10 December, and it met twice the next day and again on 15 December. Lloyd George questioned Generals Macready (Adjutant-General) and Macdonogh (Chief of Military Intelligence), who advised that the transfer of German reinforcements from the East, now that Russia was dropping out of the war, could break the Allied effort. Deeply concerned about the publicity attracted by the recent Lansdowne Letter's mention of casualties, he suggested removing Haig and Robertson from office at this time, but this was met by a threat of resignation from Lord Derby. At this stage Lloyd George opposed extending conscription to Ireland – Carson advised that extending conscription to Ulster alone would be impractical.\n\nUltimately. top priority was given to shipbuilding and merchant shipping, and Army manpower was placed below both weapons production and civilian industry. The size of the Army in Britain was to be reduced from eight divisions to four, freeing about 40,000 men for service in France. Lloyd George also argued that the collapse of Russia and defeat of Italy required further \"combing-out\" of men from industry, in breach of pledges given to the trade unions in 1916. Auckland Geddes was given increased powers to direct labour – a new bill became law, despite the opposition of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, in February 1918. The unions were placated with the Caxton Hall conference, at which Lloyd George outlined Allied war aims. He called for Germany to be stripped of her conquests (including her colonies, and Alsace-Lorraine, annexed in 1871) and democratised (although he was clear that this was more to help to ensure the future peace of Europe rather than explicit war aim), and for the liberation of the subject peoples of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. He also hinted at reparations and a 'new international order'. The speech greatly increased his support amongst trade unions and the Labour Party. The speech would go onto live in infamy following the end of the war.\n\nIn keeping with Lloyd George's desire to capture the Holy City, he had tasked Edmund Allenby with 'Jerusalem before Christmas' and that he had only to ask for reinforcements. After steadily taking Ottoman Mesopotamia, Allenby captured Jerusalem in December 1917.\n\nThe Lloyd George Ministry Part II (1918 - 1919)[]\n\nGoing into 1918, work stoppages and strikes became frequent as trade unions expressed grievances regarding prices, alcohol control, pay disputes, dilution of labour, fatigue from overtime and Sunday work, and inadequate housing. This would not be the only headache, as by the spring of 1918 came a series of military and political crises. The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies. The Allies would launch a full scale Spring Offensive starting on 21 March in an attempt to break the German lines. The Germans would barely hold, with a great loss of life on both sides.\n\nDespite strong warnings that it would backfire, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland. Trade unions in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on conscription exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted but not enforced with only Unionist communities participating, leading to nearly the entirety of the UVF leaving for the Western Front. Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray and joined Sinn Féin in calling for open resistance to conscription. Many Irish Catholics and nationalists quickly aligned with Sinn Féin, a decisive moment marking the dominance of Irish politics by a party committed to leaving the UK altogether.\n\nWith the manpower crisis deepening, the defeat of Greece following Operation Teutoberg in July, would see the Prime Minister undergoing more pressure, with his famed Salonika gambit having backfired completely. In response to growing questions in Parliament over the conduct of the war, he would claim Haig's forces were stronger at the start of 1918 than they had been a year earlier – in fact the increase was in the number of labourers, most of them Chinese, Indians and black South Africans with Haig having fewer infantry. The information had been provided by Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice who then made the spectacular public allegation that the War Cabinet had deliberately held soldiers back from the Western Front to as to continue the fighting in Greece. Despite Maurine breaking King's Regulations, Asquith, still Liberal Party leader, took up the claims and called for a Parliamentary Inquiry. While Asquith's presentation was poorly done, Lloyd George's own defence was stunted, and he only narrowly won over the House. The Liberal Party was openly split for the first time.\n\nBy August, a new wave of strikes would break out when the illegal National Union of Police and Prison Officers would take to the streets to demand pay increases and other concessions. More than 12,000 policemen went on strike, shocking the war-torn society and proving another major headache for the PM. Ultimately the government would make some minor concessions, but the NUPPO remained an illegal organisation. While the major strike would end, smaller strikes would continue on, joined up by bakers and council tenants especially in Scotland. Once hailed as the man who 'united Capital and Labour' in the war effort, Lloyd George was ridiculed in the press for losing his grip on the unions.\n\nIn Ireland, public opposition to conscription had swelled massively, with riots and strikes in Europe, engulfing the island. A large general strike had taken place earlier in the year. In a poorly thought out plan to appease the Irish while bringing in full conscription, the government would decide to finally bring in Home Rule in an effort to resolve the tumultuous situation, and lessen the blow of conscription. Facing objection from the Unionists, a further compromise was made in which 6 of the 9 counties of Ulster were made temporarily exempt from the Home Rule elections, with a plan to review this status post-war, further increasing the general unrest. This would simply cause more popular outrage among the Irish but Lloyd George would be adamant at continuing the proposal. Following the elections in November, Sinn Féin would take major gains and convene their own assembly, the Dáil Éireann. With open war sparking up in the Home Isles, the Prime Minister would move to have Japan increase its contributions to the war effort either by allowing Britain to purchase war material at a cheaper rate or dispatching divisions to the Western Front. Both proposals were refused and ultimately only a small detachment of the IJN was sent to the Mediterranean.\n\nFollowing the Great German Spring Offensive, the war effort would continuously fall further against the British. After defeat at Amiens, the British and French forces would be separated, rendering the Supreme War Council useless as cooperation between the two forces was cut. By June, the beginning of the end would unfold as the Last Offensive of the French Generals would take place while British forces would perform a fighting retreat. The Offensive would ultimately collapse despite early gains, due to massive mutinies and strikes among the French. With Italy in a civil war and France quickly falling apart, the Lloyd George ministry would push for the Armistice of Chantilly in August. At home, the Prime Minister would be savaged in the press for 'capitulation' to the Central Powers.\n\nFollowing the opening of peace talks, Lloyd George would be heavily involved and significantly change position from his original 'program', instead attempting to secure a respectable and quiet exit for the British. To this end, he was indeed successful and his government would pressure the French to sign the treaty despite its humiliating consequences. On the eve of the signing of the treaty, many traditional 'Guy's' would be swapped out for effigies of the beleaguered PM and cast on bonfires. The very next day, the Treaty of Versailles would be signed and the Weltkrieg was over.\n\nPost-Weltkrieg Life[]\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Versailles, Lloyd George was crushed and now a political pariah. The Coalition Liberals would rapidly implode and the Conservatives would quickly distance themselves from the coalition. Facing the prospect of a vote of no confidence and with the Press decrying him as 'the Man who Lost the War', the PM would resign and call a snap election. He would attempt to rejoin the Liberals and stand as a candidate but be refused and so establish his own 'Independent Liberals' out of the wreckage of the Coalition. The party would rename itself the National Liberals and be confined purely to Lloyd George's relatives and his most die-hard supporters. In the 1919 election all its candidates would lose their deposits and it would poll less than 1% of the nationwide vote.\n\nThe electoral campaign for Carnarvon Boroughs would see Lloyd George run against his old party though he would repeatedly refer to himself as 'the real Liberal candidate' throughout. This was so effective that he would be erroneously be referred to as the Liberal candidate by local news and prove so contentious, the Liberal party would attempt to sue him for fraud. Lloyd George would poll only 2% in a chaotic five-way election which would see the Independent, Austin Harrison, win. Lloyd George's daughter Megan would later write 'the rest of the Westminster mob descended on Carnarvon like sharks to blood' and that all parties had wished to capitalise on his spectacular failure.\n\nDuring (and shortly after) his electoral campaign he would circulate a pamphlet titled 'I've 'eard different!' designed to 'refute various misconceptions' regarding his conduct in the War. The pamphlet would mostly condemn the British generals who Lloyd George had feuded with for 'incompetency' and the press for not throwing its support behind his government. In a section regarding claims he 'lost the war', he would argue that in a sense Britain had technically 'won' as it had left relatively unscathed and its primary goal of protecting Belgian integrity had in fact been completed. While this was a popular sentiment among the British elite, Lloyd George would be widely ridiculed for it with the Daily Mail declaring that he must take responsibility for the war. Future Liberal leader, Herbert Samuel would go onto write:\n\n“ With that one blasted leaflet, the great Liberal firebrand of our age, destroyed any hopes of ever returning. There were indeed many of us who would have welcomed his return, but he cut away everything in a futile bid to save his reputation. ”\n\nShortly after the election, he would become embroiled in a minor scandal with the Daily Mail when they would attack him over his finances. Following press investments and other speculative opportunities, Lloyd George had amassed a large fortune but would refuse to speak on it, and claim that he was 'practically penniless. In an unsavoury political cartoon, Lloyd George, depicted as a Welsh dragon with a large horde behind it, labelled with 'Illicit Speculation', 'Marconi Bribes', 'Stolen Pensions' and other unflattering accusations, would claim to an irate King Arthur and Merlin (Bonar Law and Chancellor Baldwin respectively) that he had no idea where his 'fabulous wealth' had gone and that he had 'probably spent it on non-conformist prayer books or something other'. Lloyd George would successfully sue the Mail for libel and be awarded a hefty settlement with the cartoon being stopped from circulation.\n\nFollowing the legal scandal, he would quietly retract from public life and descend into political obscurity. During this period he would primarily focus on his investment opportunities. According Megan Lloyd George he had considered re-establishing a legal practice but 'quickly decided against it'. Regardless, during this time he continued to take appointments with well-wishers and his most die-hard supporters who encouraged him to return to the Liberals. Around 1921, he would indeed follow these proposals, and rejoin the party proper having already donated money to it. Despite talks about attempting a 'return to leadership' he would remain a rank-and-file member, holding limited interactions with the party outside of donations.\n\nBy 1924, Lloyd George had been living on the Southern English coast (from at least 1922) and so was not at an initial risk of the conflict in Wales. He would return to a slight public role, condemning 'socialist violence' but otherwise remain quiet on the affair. According to his daughter Megan, he 'began packing his money in shoeboxes' and talked of leaving Britain owing to the ongoing conflict with an interest in leaving for the Netherlands or Belgium. He remained pessimistic of the chances of the National Government and by the Christmas of 1924, he had disappeared.\n\nAssessment[]\n\nAcademic Views[]\n\nLloyd George has often been ranked poorly among the modern set of British prime ministers, but his legacy remains complicated and controversial. Widely regarded as 'the man who lost the war', he has earned criticism from Exile and Republican historians alike. His distrust of his own commanders, strategic failures and repeated involvement in conspiracies to remove or discredit his own generals have gained particular ire among both factions. Likewise, his bungled attempt to enforce conscription on Ireland by using Home Rule have been said to have 'effectively caused the Irish war' though some historians have claimed that this conflict was inevitable. Republican historians have been particularly critical of the ex-Prime Minister, attacking his wartime labour record, involvement in financial scandals and arguing that his undermining of the British high command, led to unnecessary slaughter of British soldiers. Notably, they have attacked his record at the Ministry of Munitions, arguing the increase in munitions output in 1915–16 was due largely to reforms already underway, before he had even arrived. His legacies over Ireland and the Treaty of Versailles are also controversial, and although an ardent Zionist, he expressed antisemitic views.\n\nHowever, some scholars have praised his early welfare reforms and his efforts to mobilise Britain during the Weltkrieg, arguing that his position at the Ministry of Munitions was able to boost morale in a critical period. Likewise, these more friendly scholars have argued his 'presidential' leadership was necessary due to the war and that his involvement in military intrigue was to combat 'ineffective generals, with his involvement in establishing the Allied Supreme War Council being especially praised.\n\nPro-German Sympathies[]\n\nLloyd George was consistently pro-German after 1920, in part due to his growing conviction that France had 'betrayed Britain' during the Weltkrieg. He would vigorously attack the French war effort, claiming the incompetence of the French high command had made the Entente's loss all but impossible to avoid. He would spare no criticism of Britain's National French allies, claiming that their defeat in the French Civil War was an 'inevitability'.\n\nLikewise, he argued that 'Germany had earned its Great Power status fairly' and that it formed the last continental bulwark against syndicalism. In a private speech in 1922, he warned that if Germany were to fall then 'Communardism' would run roughshod over Europe. Notably, he would defend the conduct of Germany in its European vassal states, claiming they were 'treated with respect and honour' while continuing to argue that Britain had achieved its war aims by 'maintaining the integrity of a Belgian state'. In early 1924, prior to the Hood Incident, he would allegedly propose in letters to a friend, that Britain should seek an alliance with Germany and abandon the Algiers regime."
