        "text": "David Lloyd George died in 1945.\n\nIn 1971 his secretary and second wife Frances published Lloyd George: A Diary saying for 9 March 1934 (page 259):\n\nAt Geneva other countries would have agreed not to use aeroplanes for bombing purposes, but we insisted on reserving the right, as D[avid] puts it, to bomb niggers! Whereupon the whole thing fell through, & we add 5 millions to our air armaments expenditure.\n\nBy this stage Lloyd George was in opposition, so it is unclear whether the comments are made with approval or not, and indeed whether the specific word is his own or something he was putting into the mouth of the Government."
