        "text": "Japan, the West and the Treaty of Versailles\n\nAt the outset of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference Japan enjoyed a seat at the top table, but the vexed issue of racial equality set it and its notional Western allies on different paths.\n\nThe End of Britain’s Weeks-Long General Elections\n\nGeneral elections in Britain were once weeks-long affairs of corruption and chaos. The shift to one-day polling was slow.\n\nThe Scandalous Success of the Daily Mail\n\nIn January 1944 the Daily Mail became the first transoceanic newspaper, having transformed the relationship between politics, the press and the people. How powerful is it really?\n\nFirst World War: The Fight on the Home Front\n\nSoldiers on the front line in France and Flanders saw their fight as the only legitimate one. But in Britain, the mobilisation of the domestic workforce was integral to winning the First World War.\n\nRecollections of David Lloyd George, Part I\n\nLucy Masterman’s husband was one of Lloyd George’s closest associates during the formation of the National Health Insurance and the controversies over the Parliament Act of 1909-1911. Mrs. Masterman draws on the records she kept at the time to offer a vivid portrait of Lloyd George’s intuitive political genius.\n\nRecollections of David Lloyd George, Part II\n\nAt a time when class-distinctions were still immensely powerful, writes Lucy Masterman, Lloyd George became the first working-class Prime Minister of Great Britain.\n\nLloyd George’s Dilemma\n\nThe supreme direction of the First World War has remained a matter of controversy; in this essay, John Terraine contrasts Lloyd George’s hopes with the manner of their realization.\n\nKing Albert in World War I\n\nDavid Woodward describes how, throughout the First World War, the King remained on the narrow strip of Belgium between Ypres and the sea which remained in Allied hands.\n\nThe Big Four: Peacemaking in Paris in 1919\n\nAlan Sharp takes a fresh look at the statesmen responsible for the Treaty of Versailles"
