        "text": "Herbert Henry Asquith was the last Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to lead a purely Liberal Party cabinet; in the last century, only Margaret Thatcher remained longer than he did as the head of government. He had served as Home Secretary under Gladstone and Rosebery in 1892-5, and became Chancellor of the Exchequer in the cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman when the Liberals returned to power in December 1905. He then assumed the Premiership when Campbell-Bannerman became fatally ill in April 1908.\n\nHis importance in Irish history is that he succeeded in enacting the third Home Rule Bill into law in 1914, after Gladstone's failures of 1886 and 1893. However the opposition of the Unionists and the outbreak of the first world war in September 1914 meant that Home Rule was never implemented in the form that Asquith envisaged.\n\nI was lucky enough to buy a battered second-hand copy of Volume 2 of his memoirs early in 2001, and present here four extracts relevant to Irish history. These extracts are not intended to be anything other than material illuminating Asquith's views on Ireland, for readers who have already encountered him as a rather bewildered player in the works of Patricia Jalland and George Dangerfield, whose own voice should now be given a hearing. The reader should of course bear in mind that this is Asquith's own selection from his own papers of material likely to present his activities and decisions (or indeed his inactivity and indecision) in the best possible light.\n\nIn Asquith on Ireland, 1914, I have included Asquith's diary remarks on the Irish situation over the summer of 1914. The sense of extreme pressure and uncertainty on Asquith's part is apparent.\n\nIn the Shadow of War, which includes some of the same material, I have transcribed the whole of the first chapter of the book to give an impression of the dramatic explosion of the Balkan crisis into a full-blown war. The chapter also includes Asquith's prefatory remarks about political diaries.\n\nIn Asquith's Dublin Speeches I have transcribed Asquith's account of two speeches he made in Dublin, one outlining his Irish policy in 1912, and the second immediately after the outbreak of war in 1914.\n\nIn May 1915 Asquith formed a coalition government between his Liberal Party, the Labour Party and the Tories, including Sir Edward Carson as Attorney-General; this last was much to the dismay of Irish Nationalist leader John Redmond, who had also been urged to become a minister in the new cabinet by Asquith but felt he must continue to support it from outside, in accordance with the Irish Nationalist policy of not accepting government office. Asquith's leadership, never very dynamic, was further weakened by the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and the Battle of the Somme (in which his own son was killed); by December, Lloyd George had gained the support of Bonar Law and the Tories, and forced him to resign as Prime Minister.\n\nAsquith lost his East Fife seat in the 1918 election, but won a by-election in Paisley in February 1920 to resume his place as leader of the opposition Liberals in the House of Commons. In the meantime the situation in Ireland had changed considerably from six years previously. In Asquith on Ireland, 1920, probably the section that shows him at his best, he bitterly criticises Lloyd George's policies of \"giving to Ulster a Parliament which it did not want, and to the remaining three-quarters of Ireland a Parliament which it would not have\" while maintaining the Black and Tan repression, and proposes a settlement not very different from the one actually implemented a year later.\n\nLloyd George and Asquith re-united their supporters under the Liberal banner in 1923, but it was not a happy experience. Asquith lost his Paisley seat in the 1924 election, and accepted a peerage early the next year as the Earl of Oxford and Asquith. In 1926, after a bitter squabble with Lloyd George about the General Strike, he resigned as leader of the Liberals in October, and died sixteen months later, aged 76, in February 1928. It seems likely that he had done the bulk of the editing work on his memoirs before he died, as the second volume was published that same year.\n\nFurther reading\n\nGeorge Dangerfield, The Strange Death of Liberal England (1935, but much reprinted)\n\nPatricia Jalland, The Liberals and Ireland: The Ulster Question in British Politics to 1914 (1980)\n\nWhat's new on this site?\n\nNorthern Ireland Elections, 1885-2000\n\nScience Fiction\n\nHistory of Science\n\nBits and Pieces\n\nYour comments, please!
