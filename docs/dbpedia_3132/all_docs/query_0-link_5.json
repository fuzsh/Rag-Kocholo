        "text": "Lloyd George took a far more active role in strategy and repeatedly clashed with military and naval leaders. During 1917, he won the Admiralty over to the convoy system and was highly critical of Field Marshal Haig’s management of the Third Ypres offensive.\n\nAs a national leader Lloyd George's dynamism and self-belief helped maintain public morale in the face of the real perils experienced throughout 1917 and 1918. At the moment of greatest crisis, the 1918 German Spring Offensives, he held faith in ultimate victory. His performance as a war leader and symbolic rallying point anticipated that of Winston Churchill's during 1940."
