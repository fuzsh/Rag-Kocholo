It replaced the earlier wartime coalition under H. H. Asquith, which had been held responsible for losses during the Great War.[2] Those Liberals who continued to support Asquith served as the Official Opposition. The government continued in power after the end of the war in 1918, though Lloyd George was increasingly reliant on the Conservatives for support. After several scandals including allegations of the sale of honours, the Conservatives withdrew their support after a meeting at the Carlton Club in 1922, and Bonar Law formed a government.[2]\n\nCabinets\n\n[edit]\n\nWar Cabinet, December 1916 – January 1919\n\n[edit]\n\nLord Curzon of Kedleston – Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords\n\nBonar Law – Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons\n\nArthur Henderson – Minister without Portfolio\n\nLord Milner – Minister without Portfolio\n\nChanges\n\n[edit]\n\nMay – August 1917 – In temporary absence of Arthur Henderson, George Barnes, Minister of Pensions acts as a member of the War Cabinet.\n\nJune 1917 – Jan Smuts enters the War Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio\n\nJuly 1917 – Sir Edward Carson enters the War Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio\n\nAugust 1917 – George Barnes succeeds Arthur Henderson (resigned) as Minister without Portfolio and Labour Party member of the War Cabinet.\n\nJanuary 1918 – Carson resigns and is not replaced\n\nApril 1918 – Austen Chamberlain succeeds Lord Milner as Minister without Portfolio.\n\nJanuary 1919 – Law becomes Lord Privy Seal, remaining Leader of the House of Commons, and is succeeded as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Chamberlain; both remaining in the War Cabinet.
