        "text": "The First World War was fought on a vast scale and raised unprecedented challenges for the leaders of the combatant nations.\n\nThe political leaders were responsible for the decision to go to war, and for deciding what war aims to pursue. The horrific casualties sustained early in the war meant that none of them could consider accepting a peace without victory. They were forced to oversee ever-increasing social and industrial mobilisation to support the war, and to mortgage the financial future of their countries to pay for it."
