        "text": "FAQs in Response to Consultation on Academy Conversion\n\nWhat are the other options to an Academy?\n\nSchools can remain as a Voluntary Aided (VA) school unless the Regional Schools Director has issued a direct Academy Order in response to a school going into an Ofsted category. It is Bishop David’s wish however, that all Catholic schools in the diocese work together within the two major MATs of St Thomas Catholic Academies Trust in the south and Our Lady Immaculate in the north.\n\nWhat experience does St Thomas Catholic Academies Trust (STCAT) have in education?\n\nSTCAT provides opportunities for nurturing and developing Catholic leaders and for strong practitioners to take on school improvement lead roles. The structure of the MAT secures best practice in partnership working with the full backing of the Diocese of Northampton. STCAT provides challenge, support and accountability and has a proven track record of school improvement. In 2022, the 2 schools that joined the trust as ‘Requires Improvement’ schools, have received an Ofsted grade of ‘Good’ following school improvement work with STCAT. Currently, all schools within STCAT are ‘Good’ or better.\n\nIs there a financial benefit for the school?\n\nThere is a financial benefit to academy status for the school:\n\n· The school will no longer have to pay 10% on building projects\n\n· The school will be able to claim back VAT on building projects\n\n· The school will be able to access the academies capital grant that offers the potential of more substantial funding for building work that is required\n\nAre there financial costs for the school?\n\nThere are costs associated with being a member of the Trust. Each school pays a core central contribution broadly equivalent to 1.8% of income for secondary schools and 2% for primary schools. This funds school improvement services and financial services that yield savings in other areas. In the short term it would be wrong to claim there is a financial advantage to any school, but over time we will secure benefits.\n\nExactly what number of local pupils will be accepted to the school and what happens to those pupils who are not?\n\nThere will be no changes to admissions arrangements\n\nWill you automatically be accepted if you live in the current catchment area?\n\nAs above\n\nWill the catchment area remain the same as it is now?\n\nAs above\n\nWhat procedures will be put in place to ensure that pupils with special educational needs are admitted to the Academy on a fair basis?\n\nAs above\n\nWill pupils have to take a selection test by aptitude?\n\nAs above\n\nWill the Academy’s exclusion policy be the same as other local schools?\n\nEach school already has its own exclusion policy in line with other Catholic schools in the local area partnership\n\nFor parents who do not want to send their children to the Academy, who will pay the transport costs of getting them to other schools which are still under Local Authority control?\n\nThis is a decision for parents. There will be no change in our schools beyond arrangements for governance, enhanced professional support and finance and we would not envisage any reason to withdraw pupils.\n\nWill the Academy have an anti-bullying policy? Yes\n\nHow would SEND pupils be catered for and can you give an assurance that current levels of SEND support and behaviour support staff would be maintained?\n\nThe school is not seeking to change the way SEND pupils are supported. No school is immune to national funding changes and therefore adjustments are sometimes required but we do not envisage the need for any further change.\n\nWill staff representatives be included on the governing body? If not, how will teachers’ views be represented?\n\nYes. The school will have its own Local Academy Committee (LAC) replacing the current Governing Body. The LAC reports to STCAT directors and staff are part of the membership\n\nHow will parents’ views be represented?\n\nAs is the case for the existing Governing Body, parents’ views are reflected in part through elected membership, although wider consultation is a feature of each of our schools.\n\nWho will have the majority on the governing body?\n\nFoundation Local Academy Committee Members appointed by Bishop David and Diocesan trustees will be in majority. This majority reflects the arrangements for current Governing Bodies.\n\nWhat staffing structures and pastoral care will be in place?\n\nNo changes are planned\n\nWhat happens to staff such as catering and cleaners who are employed via buy-back from the Local Authority?\n\nThese are services we pay for already. No change is planned.\n\nWhat obligation does the Local Authority have to employees who do not want their contracts to be transferred to an Academy? Do we have any right to be re–deployed and remain employed by the Local Authority?\n\nThis a Voluntary Aided (VA) school and staff are employed by the governing body, not the LA. There is no right to be redeployed within the local authority.\n\nFor current employees, TUPE conditions will apply. Can you give a guarantee that you would not re-negotiate teachers’ terms and conditions under “reorganisation”?\n\nThe school will always work to the best possible terms of conditions for all staff and for teaching staff this is defined by The School Teachers’ Pay and Condition Document (STPCD). We are not seeking to change any aspect of teachers’ terms and conditions or indeed those of any staff.\n\nWould the Academy pay scales remain in line with national agreements, and would future employees be offered the same terms and conditions as transferred staff?\n\nThe trust will always work to national agreements.\n\nWill the existing head teacher be appointed head of the new school? If not, why? When will the new principal be in place and how will they be appointed/by whom?\n\nThe current arrangements for the Acting Executive Headteacher will remain in place and be unaffected by academy conversion.\n\nHow will parents’ and stakeholders’ views be considered when a decision is made about an Academy?\n\nGovernors will consider stakeholder responses to consultation at the end of the consultation period\n\nCan you confirm what percentage of people opposed to the Academy it will take to stop the proposal going ahead?\n\nThere is no percentage. The decision to proceed to academy status will be defined by the potential advantages and careful consideration of any disadvantages for our students.\n\nParent Specific questions:\n\nWill the school uniform change if we convert to an academy?\n\nThe school does not intend to make any change to the school’s uniform\n\nWill the school’s name change if we convert to academy? No\n\nWill the school day change if we convert to academy?\n\nNo. There may be changes to the school day to reflect changes in legislation, but that is not a consequence of academy conversion.\n\nWhat are the benefits for my child if the school joins STCAT?\n\nThe pupils will benefit from strengthened links across the schools of the Trust, as staff will be sharing professional development activities and opportunities to share good practice, leading to a continuously improving quality of education. The catholicity and distinctive ethos of school is supported along with a strong focus on continuously improving educational standards. St Michael’s has already benefitted significantly from the support the trust has been able to put into place – not least in the support provided by Mr Sindall and the support of members of staff in other trust schools to support improvement.\n\nWill the school still teach the National Curriculum?\n\nYes. The school values the National Curriculum and all pupils will continue to receive a broad and balanced curriculum, that supports all pupils regardless of need or ability.\n\nWho will make the decisions in each school?\n\nThe Headteacher is responsible for the day to day business of the school, as at present and the Governing Body will continue to exist, but in a slightly different way. It will be known as the schools Local Academy Committee and a board of directors selected for their relevant skills, sits above the LAC, monitoring their performance.\n\nStaff Specific questions (including TUPE related questions):\n\nWho will be my employer?\n\nYou will be employed by St Thomas Catholic Academies Trust (STCAT)\n\nWhat are the terms and conditions of employment for new staff within STCAT?\n\nExisting staff will TUPE into (STCAT) on existing Terms and conditions. The Burgundy Book (which applies to teachers) and the Green Book or Bucks Pay Employment Conditions (which applies to support staff) are collective agreements and will transfer as current. Any future changes will not be binding on the Trust but STCAT intends to continue to apply the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document (STCPD) and other National agreements and will mirror changes as amendments are made over time, including pay awards.\n\nWill the staff terms and conditions remain the same?\n\nIt is anticipated that all school staff will transfer to the Trust and retain their existing terms and conditions and continuity of employment. Although subsequent changes are possible following a TUPE transfer, none are planned and can only be made if the reason is an ‘economic, technical or organisational reason’ involving changes in the workforce/ workplace.\n\nWhat will be the changes to the day-to-day operations?\n\nMost staff will not see any noticeable day-to-day differences. Senior Leaders and finance teams will have close relations with the Trust central team as they oversee the procedural and system changes required – for example changes to the finance system (SAGE).\n\nWill Job Descriptions be re-written?\n\nJob Descriptions will be reviewed in the same way as currently.\n\nWill I be asked to move to a different academy within the Trust?\n\nIt is highly unlikely that staff will be asked to move to another academy – unless for a promotion or because the member of staff felt it advanced their career. There are no examples across the Trust of staff being forced to work in another school. We are aware that this does happen in some Academy Trusts, but we recognise that it is very damaging to relations where this does happen and does not help in the long term.\n\nWill we be expected to work weekends?\n\nDirected time will not be timetabled over the weekend.\n\nWill the length of the school day change?\n\nThe length/ timing of a day is still determined by the school. We have no plans to change it.\n\nAre we going to work longer hours?\n\nThe Trust is committed to staff working within the limits defined by Directed Time in STPCD. Support staff work to defined weekly hours.\n\nWill the term dates change?\n\nTerm dates will be determined in the same way as they are now.\n\nAre we changing the name of the school?\n\nNo, we are not changing the name.\n\nHow dictatorial will STCAT be?\n\nSTCAT has a clear scheme of delegation that empowers Heads, Local Academy Committees and school leaders and lets them focus on teaching and learning, whilst giving a degree of autonomy over the budget. Our non-negotiables state that we value diversity in our schools whilst they are good or better, but we will intervene and support where a school is not good.\n\nIt is important to stress that any changes to budgets have been necessary because of challenges that would have created long-term problems. While Directors have the authority to override the budget set by a Local Academy Committee, they have not done so. Instead, proposed budgets have been analysed and returned to Local Academy Committees for further consideration and any changes made have been owned by school leaders and Local Academy Committees which is our preferred mode of operation.\n\nWho is the Headteacher accountable to in the new structure?\n\nIn the new multi academy structure, the Headteacher is line managed by the Local Academy Committee, like now, but on an executive basis by the Senior Executive Lead (SEL).The SEL has to abide by the trust scheme of delegation.\n\nWill the existing pay scales remain in place?\n\nYes and the current pay date will be unchanged.\n\nWill we receive the same salary?\n\nYes, under TUPE you will be paid the same, and we honour School Teachers Pay and Conditions documents.\n\nIs land protected from being sold off?\n\nThe school land will be leasehold by the Trust for 125 years, we cannot sell it off.\n\nWho will own the property?\n\nThe property will be owned by the Diocese as it is now.\n\nWhat are the times in the year when a school can convert to an academy?\n\nSchools can convert on the first day of any month.\n\nWill the unions continue to be recognised?\n\nUnions will continue to be recognised. STCAT has a long track record of excellent relations with local Unions. The Trust will continue to consult with recognised trades unions.\n\nWhat is TUPE?\n\nTUPE is the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE), amended 2014. They implement the European Community Acquired Rights Directive (77/187/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/50 EC and consolidated in 2001/23/EC).\n\nThe TUPE Regulations ensure that employees’ terms and conditions are preserved and protected when a business or undertaking, or part of one, is transferred to a new employer, i.e. where a school converts to an Academy\n\nWhen does TUPE apply?\n\nSubject to certain qualifying conditions, the Regulations apply:\n\na) when a business or undertaking, or part of one, is transferred to a new employer, or\n\nb) when a ‘service provision change’ takes place (for example, where a contractor takes on a contract to provide a service for a client from another contractor)\n\nThese two circumstances are jointly categorised as ‘relevant transfers’ and therefore apply where a school chooses to convert to an Academy.\n\nHow are transfers from the public sector to the private sector treated?\n\nThese are covered by the regulations just as transfers between private sector employers. This is a transfer within the public sector.\n\nI have heard of the terms transferor and transferee – please can you explain who these are?\n\nThe transferor is the old employer, the Governing Body and transferee is the new i.e. STCAT\n\nUnder the TUPE Regulations what actually transfers to the new employer?\n\nAll obligations in relation to employees which were the responsibility of the transferor become the responsibility of the transferee who is said to ‘step into the shoes’ of the transferor. Consequently, all existing contractual terms whether expressed or implied and including terms incorporated from a collective agreement will transfer.\n\nDoes TUPE apply to all employees?\n\nThe TUPE regulations apply to full-time & part-time employees, and those employed on fixed-term contracts of employment, provided their contracts extend beyond the date of transfer. It does not apply to agency staff where they do not have a BC / School contract of employment and may not apply to zero hours / casual employees, or direct supply staff. Employees whose substantive post is in the transferring area, but who are on secondment to another part of the organisation or school will also transfer. Secondees into the organisation affected by the transfer are not generally included in TUPE as their substantive post is elsewhere in an alternative school, or within Bucks Council\n\nCan the new employer choose who transfers?\n\nNo. Employees who are mainly or primarily employed in the undertaking or service being transferred, and only they, transfer under TUPE. This is a matter of legal fact and in the event of dispute is decided by employment tribunal. Employees absent from work, for example, those on long term sick leave or maternity leave, are included. Employees who work across two or more schools will only TUPE under the contract for the school that is affected. The school will work with employees in this situation to understand how much of their role relates to the affected area being transferred. The impact of their role will also be taken into consideration. However, in general if the majority of their work is transferring then the employee too will transfer. The school will determine those affected and consult with the ‘appropriate representatives’ at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI am about to go on maternity leave knowing that a TUPE transfer is likely to occur while I am absent. What will happen to me?\n\nThe fact that an employee may already be on maternity leave prior to and/or at the time of transfer makes no difference to her maternity rights. Clearly if you are affected by the transfer you will be informed at the same time as your colleagues. However, if you are unable to attend a face-to-face meeting, your manager will agree with you to consult by telephone or in writing and/or for a representative to attend any meetings on your behalf.\n\nI am on maternity leave and a TUPE transfer is underway. What will happen to my pay?\n\nThe employee will be entitled to the same contractual maternity pay, had she continued to be employed by the transferor. Any remaining Statutory Maternity Pay and/or Occupational Maternity Pay will be paid by the new employer.\n\nI am on Shared Parental leave/ Adoption leave and a TUPE transfer is underway/ has happened. What will happen to my pay?\n\nThe employee will be entitled to the same statutory shared parental leave and any contractual pay, had he/she continued to be employed by the transferor. Any remaining shared parental pay/adoption leave, both statutory and Occupational pay, will be paid by the new employer.\n\nI am on long term sick leave and have been notified of a TUPE transfer. What will happen to my sick pay entitlements?\n\nThe employee will be entitled to the same amount of statutory and occupational sick pay, as if he/she has continued to be employed by the transferor. Any statutory sick pay and any remaining occupational sick pay will be paid by the new employer.\n\nWhat happens to me if I am transferred to another employer under TUPE?\n\nWhen TUPE applies to the transfer of a team’s work, it means that the contracts of employment of all staff employed within that area – that is your terms and conditions of service at the date of transfer – are automatically transferred to the new employer.\n\nWhat protections do employees have under TUPE?\n\nThe effect of a TUPE transfer is that transferred employees retain all the rights and obligations existing under their contract of employment with the previous employer (school) and these are transferred to the new employer. This means that their previous terms and conditions of employment carry over to the new employer. The main exception to this rule under TUPE law concerns the treatment of occupational pensions but please refer to the separate questions below regarding how pension obligations are covered when a school converts to an Academy. Accordingly, contractual terms and conditions of employment including the principles of pay are preserved by TUPE. e.g. performance pay and pay dates. With regard to annual salary increases, the principle contractual terms apply. Please note that where the Transferee has not had the opportunity to influence any collective agreement negotiations relating to pay awards these will not be considered binding and will therefore not automatically transfer. Liabilities also transfer. This may include for example outstanding holiday and loans.\n\nIs continuity of employment broken by a TUPE transfer?\n\nNo. An employee’s period of continuous employment is not broken by a TUPE transfer to an Academy and, for the purposes of calculating entitlement to statutory employment rights, the date on which the period of continuous employment started would usually be the date on which the employee started work with the old employer.\n\nWhat happens to the service I’ve built up at the date of transfer?\n\nThe transfer does not break your service or your continuous employment. The date your continuous employment started is the one on which any entitlement to statutory employment rights will continue to be based. This includes any entitlement to redundancy payments along with any restrictions contained within the Modification Order.\n\nWhat terms and conditions are likely to transfer?\n\nThe new employer is obliged to honour your contract of employment, which means that it must maintain your existing pay and conditions of service. Examples of Terms and Conditions likely to transfer are:\n\n· Rate and method of pay\n\n· Hours of work\n\n· Employment protection rights e.g. unfair dismissal, and redundancy rights\n\n· Annual leave entitlement and pay\n\n· Sick pay and sick leave entitlements\n\n· Statutory and contractual redundancy and severance entitlements\n\n· Collective agreements\n\n· Professional fees (if currently contractual)\n\n· Contractual benefits e.g. (where these are contractual) lease car, health schemes, childcare support\n\n· Mobility and flexibility terms\n\n· Contractual personnel procedures/ policies\n\n· Individual personnel files including disciplinary records and current formal warnings\n\n· Notice provisions\n\n· Continuity of service (for purposes of calculating annual leave, sickness and redundancy calculations\n\n· Mileage Rates\n\nWill any terms and conditions not transfer?\n\nThere are some benefits that won’t be included in a TUPE transfer as they are not contractual terms and conditions of employment. These include things such as Long Service Awards, Travel Choice cards, discounts with local organizations and discounted BUPA cover for staff who may have been provided with this as a benefit. With regard to annual salary increases, the principle contractual terms apply. Please note that where the Transferee has not had the opportunity to influence any collective agreement negotiations relating to pay awards these will not be considered binding and will therefore not automatically transfer.\n\nCan the Academy alter terms and conditions of employment?\n\nWhen a school converts to a new academy, staff are entitled to transfer under the same employment terms and conditions. Therefore, immediate changes to the staff structure and operation are not anticipated. However, once transferred, the academy trust may consult with staff and their union representatives on changes to these terms and conditions\n\nWill the new organisation issue me with a new contract of employment?\n\nThere is no need for the new organisation to issue a new contract on transfer. However, it is normal practice for the new organisation to write to confirm that it is the new employer.\n\nSo if I transferred under TUPE, I would take all my terms and conditions of service with me?\n\nThere is one exception; your pension rights are not transferred. However, the Government requires employers to ensure the new employer provides access to a broadly comparable occupational pension scheme for your future service.\n\nWhat happens to Pensions for Support Staff (LGPS)?\n\nAll academy employers are required to provide access to the Local Government Pension Scheme. You will continue to be a member of the LGPS and with no impact on your pension.\n\nWhat happens to the pension arrangements for Teachers when a school converts to an academy?\n\nAll academy employers are required to provide access to the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. You will continue to be a member of this scheme and with no impact on your pension.\n\nWill terms and conditions be harmonised?\n\nIn general, only agreed changes, which would have occurred even if the transfer had not taken place, are allowed. All employers have a duty to consult on changes they wish to make. An employee has the same right to object to unilateral contractual changes after the transfer as he or she had before it. The TUPE Regulations place limitations on the ability of the new employer to vary terms and conditions following transfer. Essentially the new employer cannot worsen the terms and conditions of transferring employees unless it can demonstrate that there is an economic, technical or organisational (ETO) reason entailing changes in the workforce. Government guidance and recent case law suggests that worsening an employee’s contract for the purpose of achieving post-transfer harmonisation cannot be justified by an ETO reason.\n\nIs there a time limit or period after which TUPE terms are no longer valid?\n\nNo, TUPE provides indefinite protection for your terms and conditions of employment which transfer intact and should not change without your prior agreement.\n\nAfter a period of time, can a new employer change the terms and conditions of employment by using methods such as the consultation process?\n\nYes it can, but only with your agreement in the normal way. It must also be able to demonstrate that any changes are not connected to the transfer.\n\nWhat if the new employer dismisses me rather than employing me?\n\nTUPE gives enhanced rights to employees who are dismissed before, or after, the transfer. Such dismissals would be automatically unfair unless they can be shown to have been either unconnected with the transfer or for a genuine economic, technical, or organisational reason (sometimes referred to as an ETO reason) entailing changes in the workforce e.g. redundancies, and the employer is acting “reasonably” in treating that reason as sufficient to justify a dismissal. If your new employer does dismiss you for one of these reasons, it must treat you according to your normal rights relating to redundancy, including such things as contractual notice and redundancy compensation.\n\nWhat if I don’t want to transfer?\n\nThe regulations allow for you to opt out of the transfer by informing either your line manager or your proposed new employer. You should note, however, that this is likely to mean that you will be treated as if you had resigned, not as if you had been dismissed. There is no redundancy situation and therefore there is no entitlement to any redundancy payment.\n\nWhy can’t I be made redundant if my job with my current employer no longer exists?\n\nYour job still exists – it has simply transferred to a new employer so you are not redundant.\n\nAt what point would I go on the Employee Transfer Register?\n\nUnder the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations your role and existing terms and conditions will transfer to the new employer. You will therefore not be in a redundancy situation will not meet the criteria to be placed on the Employee Transfer register.\n\nWill trade union recognition agreements transfer?\n\nThere is no entitlement to the recognition agreement transferring but the Trust has a strong positive record of working with Trade Union organisations and there is full recognition of all trade unions.\n\nWill the sickness records of individuals and other personnel information be passed to the new employer?\n\nYes, sickness records will be passed to the new employer but only those relevant for current occupational sick pay and statutory sick pay purposes. Other personnel records, which relate to the contract of employment, will also transfer. These will include:\n\nPersonal details, e.g. age, length of service, next of kin information, pay details\n\nOffer letter\n\nStatement of written particulars\n\nJob Title and job description\n\nRelevant training records\n\nAccident report forms\n\nLeave sheet to ensure retention of any carry forward\n\nEye test letter\n\nThe new employer is also entitled to information about any live disciplinary or grievance cases. This is permissible under the Data Protection Act 2018.\n\nWhat about any claims I have against my existing employer?\n\nAny pre-existing claims which the transferring employees have against the school would also transfer with the employees to the new employer. Any liability for a dismissal which was for a transfer-connected reason would transfer. Any claims for personal injury, any employment tribunal claims, common law claims (and indeed most claims) transfer also.\n\nHow and what will I be told about the transfer?\n\nUnder the TUPE regulations there is a statutory duty imposed on the old employer to inform and where changes or “measures” are proposed to consult the ‘appropriate representatives’ of all employees who are affected by the transfer, prior to the transfer taking place. The process of consultation with representatives must be undertaken with a view to reaching agreement on the proposal.\n\nThe school will tell you and your trade union or elected representatives:\n\n· That a transfer is being considered and why it is being considered\n\n· The approximate date of transfer\n\n· Which group/individuals are proposed to transfer\n\n· About the legal, economic and social implications of the transfer\n\n· That your terms and conditions of service will transfer to the new employer (TUPE applies)\n\n· What differences, if any, it will make to you – changes in pensions etc.\n\n· Whether you will be moving to new premises to work for the new employer etc.\n\n· About any measures to be taken in connection with the transfer which will affect you\n\n· About any measures likely to be taken by the new employer that will affect you.\n\n· About numbers of agency workers engaged by the Council; the areas they work in and types of work they do.\n\nHow much notice will I be given of a TUPE transfer to a new employer?\n\nThere is no legal requirement for a minimum consultation period. However, Bucks council has agreed a minimum consultation period of 5 weeks with recognised unions. The DfE are advising schools wishing to convert to start the relevant consultation as soon as possible. There is no requirement to give notice of the termination of an individual’s contract as the contract is continuing with the new employer.\n\nWho can I contact if I have any further questions about TUPE?\n\nWe appreciate that this period of major change can be very unsettling for some staff and you may require further support. If you are a member of Professional Association/Trade Union then you can also speak to them about your concerns.\n\nST MICHAEL’S CONSULTATION\n\nQUESTIONS (from Robert Tucker: NEU) and STCAT RESPONSES\n\nPolicy consultation:\n\nMembers are raising queries and thought it helpful to ask why the school is making simultaneous changes to multiple policies (behaviour, T&L, marking and assessment) and asking for immediate implementation? Have we been consulted?\n\nSTCAT response: The nature of consultation around policies that cover contractual terms and conditions and those that cover the daily operation of aspects of the school such as behaviour and teaching and learning policies will be different. There is a framework for consultation around contractual HR policies that the Trust will always follow in consultation with Trade Unions and in line with national agreements where these apply.\n\nInternal non-HR policies for the school (eg. teaching and learning) are more likely to be developed collaboratively before implementation so that workload implications can be worked through before the policy becomes live.\n\nThe current position of St Michael’s was such that more urgent changes to non-HR policies were required by the leaders in the school (which remains a Voluntary Aided school and independent of STCAT currently). The objective for any school is to arrive at a place where this rapid way of working is not required, and it is our aim that this should be the case. Members of staff should be reassured that this is our intent in STCAT.\n\nDirected time:\n\nStaff have to attend​ a morning, a form or another of briefing, FT meeting, etc. Middle leaders have a meeting from 8.10 to 8.20, then the 8.30 to 8.45 briefing/PBL/reflection/FT meeting, then attend line up outside, then complete FT activities, and all this before P1. Each Monday teaching staff are directed to be in school until 5 pm for collective CPD, follow by departmental meetings. Tue is catch up for 2 hours after school, detentions; Wed, alternate weeks are held Middle leaders’ meetings, concurrent with Yr 11 interventions (some middle leaders are missing their meeting as they have to deliver interventions for their department for groups of 47 students, for example, in science). Thu afterschool is the only non-directed afternoon. Fri after school there are 1- and 2-hour detentions. We requested that the directed time is checked and shared with NEU. Colleagues collectively feel that there is insufficient time and detriment to quality planning and their mental health particularly noting the existing workload any time for planning, printing resources, marking. Given that reports are coming from multiple NEU members, we suggest a workload audit would be beneficial to get a better balance for the workforce. For example, terms of resources, the school has only one printer, no reprographics printing machine, for a school of 840 pupils. Staff are struggling but are not all confident speaking up. We may need to speak up collectively for the staff as is our duty of care to do so.\n\nSTCAT response: We will undertake a directed time audit before the start of the 2023 academic year to ensure that the workload of staff in different positions is within the 1265 hours directed time allowance for those not on the leadership scale. We appreciate the feedback on some of the operational limitations that are impacting on staff workload within the school currently and will address these in as timely a way as possible going forward.\n\nPay awards:\n\nWe also note that for the past 3 years colleagues have not awarded any staff progression pay increments, blaming it on lack of substantial evidence due to COVID 19. Would the Trust please comment. Thank you.\n\nSTCAT response: We are not able to comment on the decisions taken prior to academy conversion but can provide assurance that measures within STCAT schools are present to manage progression increments. We are committed to ensuring both support staff and teaching staff have the opportunity for pay progression each year regardless of extrinsic challenges beyond the control of individual members of staff. Like all schools, and consistent with CES policies for appraisal and national standards, we do expect strong performance against agreed objectives and totality of performance in order to secure progress. The Trust implements the nationally agreed pay award for teachers and the applicable locally agreed pay awards for support staff.\n\nContracts:\n\nWould you give us the assurance, please, that the school will ensure all staff are on contracts prior to TUPE in terms of due diligence. I have informed our members to get in touch, but it could be that other staff are not on contracts. This a concern amongst our members, and needs raising with them as part of the consultation, and resolving.\n\nAll current staff should contact Mrs Tracy Wiggins if they believe they have not been issued a contract. The Trust will check on contract details during the period of due diligence after the consultation is complete to be assured that we TUPE staff on appropriate terms and conditions."
