        "text": "In Their Own Words is a series of personal stories presented in videos and a book, describing work in traditional Chilterns’ industries of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, part of the Chilterns Stories collection.\n\nThe In Their Own Words stories are researched and presented by volunteers working for our Woodlanders’ Lives and Landscapes community social history project in the Chilterns. The stories come from three important collections of oral history interviews recorded onto reel-to-reel and cassette tape between the 1950s and the 1980s which, until now, have largely remained hidden in public and private archives.\n\nWe are indebted to Leonard John Mayes, Philip Viccars, Molly Jones, Stuart King and researchers at the University of Leeds for helping us to understand more about the lives of men, women and children in the Chilterns who earned their livings on the land, or by making items by hand. We are also grateful to Wycombe Museum, the British Library and Mavis Warner for allowing us to bring a selection of these interviews to a wider public.\n\nIn Their Own Words will be placed in schools and public libraries across the area and, along with the other books in the Chilterns Stories collection, we hope it will inspire people for many years to come. You can buy your own copy of the book on the Chilterns Stories page.\n\nIn addition, you can watch the videos below, and read more about In Their Own Words further down the page.\n\nWhy do we feel inspired when we hear people from long ago talking about their lives? Because hearing their voices gives us an emotional connection. We feel their delight, their sadness or perplexity in recalling their experiences. Simply being asked to ‘tell their story’ helps people to see that their life, however ‘ordinary’ it might have seemed to them, has a richness of detail. It is quite rare to find ordinary working people’s accounts of what it was like in the past, and these ‘oral history’ interviews capture people’s personal experiences, giving us an eyewitness account of events, places and people.\n\nVolunteer researchers working for the Woodlanders’ Lives and Landscapes community social history project in the Chilterns are very lucky to have discovered three important collections of oral history interviews. These interviews, which until now, have largely remained hidden in public and private archives, were recorded onto reel-to-reel and cassette tape between the 1950s and the 1980s by some remarkable local historians. We are indebted to Leonard John Mayes, Philip Viccars, Molly Jones, Stuart King and researchers at the University of Leeds for helping us to understand more about the lives of men, women and children in the Chilterns who earned their livings on the land, or by making things by hand. We are also beholden to Wycombe Museum, the British Library and Mavis Warner for allowing us to bring a selection of these interviews to a wider public.\n\nWe have chosen nine recordings for the breadth of experience and crafts they cover. Four of these lives were captured by Leonard John Mayes (1911-2001), or John Mayes, as he was known professionally. John was Borough Librarian at Wycombe library for many years and in 1948 he also took on the role of Curator of Wycombe Museum, retiring from both roles in 1971. He interviewed more than 50 Chilterns people in preparation for his books The History of Chairmaking in High Wycombe and The History of the Borough of High Wycombe from 1880 to the present day, which were both published in 1960. Phillip Viccars [1921-1997] interviewed several people for his book Stokenchurch in Perspective, published in 1980, and he left his cassette tapes in the care of local historians, including Molly Jones, who helped Philip with his research. We have included two of Philip’s interviews in our collection. The more recent interview, with chairmaker Sidney Wingrove, was recorded by Stuart King, a celebrated craftsman, archaeologist and historian, who has devoted much of his life to ensuring the history of Chilterns’ crafts is well told, without mythmaking and hearsay. Stuart has interviewed well over eighty people in the course of his research. The final story is a slight departure from the rest. The lacemaking era was too early for a recording to be made, but we thought it important to include voices from the industry in this collection. Therefore, we have chosen not an interview, but testimonies from children and adults who worked in this industry collected by the Government’s Children’s Employment Commission of 1862. We have used some of these accounts to create ‘oral histories’ from a time before such things were technically possible.\n\nIn the below videos you can hear the interviewees speaking in their own voices – often with quite strong Buckinghamshire accents – we and Woodlanders’ volunteers present clips from the recorded interviews. This is just a taste of the many interviews available, but in the future, you will be able to hear more. The Chalk, Cherries and Chairs project is very pleased to be supporting Wycombe Museum in digitising more of their oral history collection for everyone to enjoy."
