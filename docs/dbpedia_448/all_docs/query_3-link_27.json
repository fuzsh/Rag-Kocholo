Harold Wilson\n\nFormer Prime Minister Harold Wilson was born in Huddersfield, but he was educated in Wirral after his father moved the family to Spital to find work.\n\nWilson junior impressed so much at Wirral Grammar School for Boys that he was made head boy.\n\nHe became MP for Ormskirk in 1945 then a constituency change in 1950 created the new seat of Huyton. He was narrowly elected then - but managed to keep the seat for a further 33 years.\n\n‌\n\nHis best-remembered speech, at the 1963 Labour Party conference, referenced the “white heat” of technological change that should shape the future of the country.\n\n‌\n\nAnd the one we can sort of claim..\n\n65. Michael Sheen\n\nHe’s known as one of Wales’ most famous star exports, actor Michael Sheen - also has links to Wirral.\n\n‌\n\nHe lived in Wallasey for several years as a child when his father’s work for an electronics company brought the family to Merseyside, and attended St George’s Primary.\n\nIn an interview in 2009, his mum Irene said it was in Wallasey where a five-year-old Michael first showed his skills for mimicry.\n\nShe told Wales Online: “By the end of his first week in school I couldn’t understand him. He just absorbed the Liverpudlian accent like a sponge. He was more Liverpudlian than the locals! So after a few weeks we sent him for elocution lessons.”"
