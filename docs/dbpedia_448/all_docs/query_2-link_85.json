        "text": "The Feast of Saint Thomas, the Apostle is July 3rd.\n\nSaint Thomas was born a Jew and was called to be one of the original twelve Apostles.\n\nSaint Thomas is best known for his role in verifying the Resurrection of his Master. Thomas’ unwillingness to believe that the other Apostles had seen their risen Lord on the first Easter Sunday, earned him the title of “doubting Thomas.”\n\nEight days later, on Christ’s second apparition, Thomas was gently rebuked for his skepticism and furnished with the evidence he had demanded – seeing in Christ’s hands the point of the nails. Thomas even put his fingers in the nail holes and his hand into Christ’s side. After verifying the wounds were true, Saint Thomas became convinced of the reality of the Resurrection and exclaimed, “My Lord and My God,” thus making a public Profession of Faith in the Divinity of Jesus."
