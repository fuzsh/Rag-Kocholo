        "text": "Metropolitan\n\nNovember 18, 2021\n\nDoubt.\n\nAs believers, it’s not something we want to dwell on.\n\nBut we’ve all been there. Myself included.\n\nIt slipped by largely unnoticed, but July 3 was St. Thomas’s Day — commemorating Thomas the Apostle, the disciple who famously doubted that Jesus had risen from the dead.\n\nFor centuries, he’s been known as “Doubting Thomas.” But Thomas was actually the first disciple to declare to the risen Christ: “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28, NIV).\n\nHere’s where the story of St. Thomas gives me goosebumps. In AD 52, about 20 years after Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection, Thomas journeyed 3,000 miles to India, where he planted seven churches in the South. One of those churches was in the village of Niranam — one of the millions of villages throughout India today. Those first churches were among the earliest expressions of pure, untainted Christianity anywhere in the world. In Niranam, there’s a stone with ancient Ethiopian script memorializing the spot where St. Thomas established the first church in India.\n\nWhy does that give me goosebumps?\n\nNiranam is the village where I was born, 71 years ago.\n\nOf all the villages in India, St. Thomas came to mine! If St. Thomas had not come, had not brought the gospel, and had not established a church in my home village — 3,000 miles from Jerusalem — would I have come to faith in Christ? Because St. Thomas was obedient to travel all the way to India, the gospel came to the subcontinent.\n\nWe owe much to the courage and faith of St. Thomas, who — according to tradition — was martyred in India after bringing the gospel to my home village. I’m amazed the Holy Trinity — looking down through the centuries — allowed the missionary story of Doubting Thomas to intersect with my own.\n\nOver the years, God has trained me to depend on his often-unseen hand in my life. Like all of us, I’ve had my share of doubts and discouragement. Like Doubting Thomas, I’ve wanted to see “the proof” before I’ve taken the next step of faith. But, looking back on my life, God has always been patient with me — and, even in my own frailty of faith, he’s never let me down.\n\nIn my most despairing moments — which I write about in my newest book, Never Give Up — the victory of the cross of Christ swept away the fear and discouragement as I focused on the One who gave up everything for me — a skinny boy from one of India’s obscure villages.\n\nFeeling Unworthy?\n\nWhen he arrived in my home village, I wonder if St. Thomas felt the same as me — unworthy, inadequate for the task God called him to? Perhaps you feel that way sometimes, too?\n\nAs I reflect on the missionary zeal and sacrifice of Doubting Thomas — and the incredible way God interwove his destiny with mine — I’m called back to the pure, untainted, mission-driven faith of those earliest churches the Apostle planted in India nearly two millennia ago.\n\nMy biggest regret is that I wish I’d risked more for Jesus in my life. If I could do it over again, I’d take more risks for the gospel. I’d give more. I’d sacrifice more. I’d strive to be more like St. Thomas.\n\nPerhaps God is placing something radical on your heart that he wants you to do for him. Maybe it seems “too risky.” Perhaps there’s that niggling doubt in your mind: “What if I take the plunge — and fail?”\n\nCould I humbly offer you some advice?\n\nFollow the example of St. Thomas. Cast aside your doubt. Believe that God keeps his promises. Take a risk for the gospel. Live 100 percent for Jesus!"
