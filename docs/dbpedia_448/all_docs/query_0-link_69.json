        "text": "St Michael’s is a truly unique Catholic School in Buckinghamshire. We are comprised of two campuses, one all through school in High Wycombe and a new secondary Campus in Aylesbury.\n\nSt Michael’s Mission Statement is Achieving in Faith with Love as a Community. We are very proud of our Mission Statement and that it was written by our pupils, from across the primary and secondary phases at the High Wycombe Campus. Additionally pupils also designed logos for each word of the statement so that we are able to discuss the Mission Statement pictorially.\n\nAt St Michael’s our vision for the school has been articulated in the St. Michael’s Mission. This document was created by taking the language the pupils developed in the Mission Statement and using those words as the starting point for developing the schools vision for the future. We are proud that our Mission reflects the thoughts and ideas of pupils at its heart and builds into an exciting narrative for all of those connected and involved with the St. Michael’s, staff, parents, Governors, the Dioceses of Northampton and other members of our community.\n\nSt Michaels was formed by the amalgamation of St. Augustine’s Primary School and St. Bernard’ s Catholic School in 2012. The Wycombe Campus now offers a Catholic education from Nursery to Sixth Form. There are currently 1240 pupils attending the All Through provision at the Wycombe Campus.\n\nIn 2016 Buckinghamshire County Council identified the need for additional secondary school places in Aylesbury. Following a consultation period, St. Michael’s undertook the opening of a new Catholic, satellite secondary school in the town in September 2018. Parents in Aylesbury have sought a Catholic secondary school for a number of years and the new Campus has been received extremely well by the Aylesbury community.\n\nIn September 2018 the Aylesbury Campus opened in temporary accommodation for 120 year 7 pupils. In 2019 they will move to their new permanent home on Weedon Road and be joined by 150 new year 7’s, rising to 180 year 7’s in 2020.\n\nAs a school community we feel blessed that we are in a position to serve the communities in High Wycombe and Aylesbury and to live to our Mission and values to ensure our pupils achieve a fully rounded and successful education."
