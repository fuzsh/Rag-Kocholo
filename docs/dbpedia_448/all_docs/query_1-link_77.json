        "text": "\"Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way? Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.'\"\n\n\" 'We have seen the Lord.' \" So he said to them, 'Unless I see in His hand the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.' \"\n\n\" 'Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.' And Thomas answered and said to Him: 'My Lord and My God!' Jesus said to him, 'Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.' \""
