        "text": "St. Thomas the Apostle was one of the 12 original disciples of Jesus Christ. Mostly known for his doubt of Christ’s Resurrection, Thomas (also known as Didymus) represents the humanity we all share. Our faith is one of mystery, and we all have questions that we would like to ask Jesus. Once seeing the wounds on Christ’s resurrected body, Thomas’ faith was firmed and he became a missionary. Traveling outside of the Roman Empire, Thomas went East – eventually settling in India to preach the Good News. He was invited by the king to construct a palace, as Thomas was a skilled builder. But when Thomas distributed the payment from that project to the poor, it angered the king and got Thomas thrown in prison. He continued to preach the Gospel, causing disruption and anger amongst the establishment. Thomas was killed by a spear — a wound similar to that which he touched on Jesus.\n\nThomas was canonized a Saint for his martyrdom. His Feast Day is July 3 — also recognized as Indian Christians Day. St. Thomas the Apostle is also the Patron Saint of Architects.
