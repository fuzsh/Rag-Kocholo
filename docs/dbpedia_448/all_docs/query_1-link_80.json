        "text": "St. Thomas by the Sea Parish grew out of a mission, Good Shepherd Chapel, established in June, 1986 by the late Rev. Anthony Zoghby, Pastor of Our Lady of the Gulf Parish of Gulf Shores. Recognizing the spiritual needs of Orange Beach Catholics, as well as those of the ever-growing number of Catholic visitors to the area, Archbishop Oscar Lipscomb authorized the rental of space in the Gulfview Shopping Center for the Chapel.\n\nIt soon became evident that both permanent residents (approximately 75 families at the time) and the many visitors to the area would require a permanent house of worship. Officially established as St. Thomas by the Sea Parish on May 9, 1991, the new faith community came under the guidance of Father Francis V. Cusack as Pastor.\n\nThe church property consists of four and one-half acres of land, most of which was donated to the parish. The Parish Center building (which now houses Cusack Hall, offices and classrooms) was dedicated and blessed by Archbishop Oscar Lipscomb on October 1, 1994. An organ and marble altar were donated by Our Lady of the Gulf parish, and pews were the gift of St. Lawrence parish in Fairhope.\n\nA pastor's residence was completed in September, 1998. Construction on the church started in the summer of 1999 and the Solemn Dedication took place on December 17, 2000. The church seats about 800 people in the nave, and includes a chapel with seating for 100 people, two sacristies, a cry room, ushers' room, and reconciliation room. An enclosed narthex joins the new building to Cusack Hall, with a statue of St. Thomas and Christ as the focal point.\n\nSeveral dedicated Pastors have served the Parish over the years:\n\nRev. Francis V. Cusack – 1991-1998\n\nRev. Patrick Maher – 1998-2002\n\nRev. Mark I. Neske – 2002-2005\n\nRev. David P. Carucci – 2005-2006\n\nRev. Msgr. G. Warren Wall – 2006-2007\n\nRev. James E. Dane – 2007-2020\n\nOur current Pastor is Fr. Paul Iruthayasamy, H.G.N., who arrived in June, 2020.\n\nThere are presently about 300 families registered as parishioners, and many visitors."
