        "text": "St. Thomas the Apostle\n\nFeast Day July 3rd\n\nPatron Saint of architects\n\nLittle is recorded of St.Thomas the Apostle, nevertheless thanks to the fourth Gospel his personality is clearer to us than that of some others of the Twelve. His name occurs in all the lists of the Synoptists (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6, cf. Acts 1:13), but in St.John he plays a distinctive part. First, when Jesus announced His intention of returning to Judea to visit Lazarus, “Thomas” who is called Didymus [the twin], said to his fellow disciples: “Let us also go, that we may die with him” (John 11:16). Again it was St. Thomas who during the discourse before the Last Supper raised an objection:” Thomas saith to him : Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?” (John 14:5). But more especially St. Thomas is remembered for his incredulity when the other Apostles announced Christ’s Resurrection to him: ” Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe” (John 20:25); but eight days later he made his act of faith, drawing down the rebuke of Jesus: “Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed” (John 20:29).\n\nSt. Thomas was born in Galilee Israel circa the 1st century. Following the Lord’s resurrection, he spent the following years travelling and spreading the gospel. St. Thomas died on December 21, 72 in Mylapore, India.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ewtn.com/saintsHoly/saints/T/stthomas.asp\n\nhttp://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=410\n\nhttp://www.catholic-saints.info/catholic-saints-prayers/prayer-to-st-thomas.htm\n\nhttp://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=410\n\nIntercessory Prayers to St. Thomas the Apostle\n\nO Glorious St. Thomas, your grief for Jesus was such that it would not let you believe he had risen unless you actually saw him and touched his wounds. But your love for Jesus was equally great and it led you to give up your life for him. Pray for us that we may grieve for our sins which were the cause of Christ’s sufferings. Help us to spend ourselves in his service and so earn the title of “Blessed” which Jesus applied to those who would believe in him without seeing him.\n\nDear Saint Thomas,\n\nYou were once slow in believing that Christ had gloriously risen; but later, because you had seen him, you exclaimed: “My Lord and my God!”\n\nAccording to an ancient story, you rendered most powerful assistance for constructing a church in a place where pagan priests opposed it.\n\nPlease bless architects, builders and carpenters that through them the Lord may be honored.\n\nAmen."
