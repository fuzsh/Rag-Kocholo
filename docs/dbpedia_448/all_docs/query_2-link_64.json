        "text": "The University of St. Thomas was founded in St. Paul by a priest (John Ireland) and a railroad tycoon (James J. Hill) to educate immigrants. It was created to serve, make good neighbors and to be inclusive. The formation of St. Thomas goes beyond the typical educational institution—it was born and exists to champion the common good.\n\nWith that as our guide, the work we do in the College of Arts and Sciences goes beyond test taking. The work we do is anchored in improving the human condition. With a strong foundation in arts and sciences, we can focus on celebrating the entire human experience because we believe people are made to appreciate art and science as they work together in harmony, as they have since the beginning of time.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is building a community of people who care about ethical leadership; people who are concerned about the other and who want to give back to the world they live in. The graduates of this college aren’t simply ready for the workforce—they’re ready for life. To that end, this college emphasizes the importance of living life based on who you are, not simply what you do.\n\nLike life, learning is a journey. As students discover who they are and what they’re passionate about, the College of Arts and Sciences provides meaningful, interactive experiences that allow students to reflect on and apply what they’re learning so that they’re prepared for what’s next.\n\nThrough our curriculum, graduates are prepared to contribute to their industry and their community in meaningful ways as soon as they get their diploma. St. Thomas doesn’t just produce graduates—we create individuals who are more analytical, creative, empathetic, scientific, data and fact driven, agile and versatile with a heart for social justice and equity."
