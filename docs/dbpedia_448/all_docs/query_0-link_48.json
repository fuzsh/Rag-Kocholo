        "meta_description": "<u>The Postcard</u>\n\t\n\tA postally unused Colourmaster International Series postcard that was published by Photo Precision Limited of St. Ives, Huntingdon. The card, which was printed in Great Britain, has a divided back.\n\t\n\tFor some reason the publishers have blocked out the clock in the top right-hand corner.\n\t\n\tAlthough the card was not posted, someone has written a recipient's name and address on the divided back of the card:\n\t\n\tMr. &amp; Mrs. Norman,\n\t2, Bere Road,\n\tWareham,\n\tDorset.\n\t\n\tThere was also a message on the divided back:\n\t\n\t&quot;Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Norman,\n\tThank you very much for\n\tyour good wishes card.\n\tWe have been staying up\n\there with Jean &amp; family,\n\tand both of us have\n\tbenefitted from the rest.\n\tI have to go to Dorchester\n\tFriday 12th. August for a\n\tcheck-up, so am hoping\n\tfor the best.\n\tBest wishes from us both,\n\tPhyl &amp; Frank Carter&quot;.\n\t\n\tThe reference to Friday the 12th. August, coupled with the unfranked 9 pence stamp on the back of the card mean that the card was written in 1977.\n\t\n\t<u>High Wycombe</u>\n\t\n\tHigh Wycombe, often referred to simply as Wycombe, is a large market town in Buckinghamshire. Lying in the valley of the River Wye surrounded by the Chiltern Hills, it is 29 miles (47 km) west north-west of Charing Cross in London; this information is also engraved on the Corn Market building in the centre of the town. \n\t\n\tIn 2016, High Wycombe had a population of 125,260, and is the second largest town in the county of Buckinghamshire after Milton Keynes.\n\t\n\tWycombe is a combination of industrial and market town, with a traditional emphasis on furniture production. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the Middle Ages. The market is held on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\n\t\n\t<u>History of High Wycombe</u>\n\t\n\tWycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th.-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.\n\t\n\tHigh Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and Tudor times, manufacturing lace and linen cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.\n\t\n\tThe paper industry was notable in 17th. and 18th. century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in chalk, and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. However the paper industry was overtaken by the cloth industry.\n\t\n\tWycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly Windsor chairs), took hold in the 19th. century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers' houses were built to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. \n\t\n\tIn 1875, there were 4,700 chairs being made per day in High Wycombe. When Queen Victoria visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words 'Long Live the Queen' printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. \n\t\n\tWycombe Museum includes many examples of locally made chairs along with information on the local furniture and lace industries.\n\t\n\tThe town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry and, consequently, there was considerable unemployment and social problems when the industry declined in the 1960's.\n\t\n\t<u>High Wycombe in the 20th. Century</u>\n\t\n\tBy the 1920's, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A slum clearance scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents re-housed in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes. \n\t\n\tSome of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation, with sewage pouring down the street and people sharing one room in cramped quarters of subdivided flats. However, some areas such as St. Mary's Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th. and 19th. century architecture.\n\t\n\tFrom 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of RAF Bomber Command. Moreover, during the Second World War, from 1942 to 1945, the U.S. Army Air Force's 8th. Air Force Bomber Command, code-named 'Pinetree', was based at a former girls' school at High Wycombe. \n\t\n\tIn the 1960's the town centre was redeveloped. This involved culverting the River Wye under concrete and demolishing most of the old buildings in Wycombe's town centre. Two shopping centres were built along with many new multi-storey car parks, office blocks, flyovers and roundabouts. On the open area known as Frogmoor (or Frogmore) the original cast-iron fountain and some Georgian buildings were also torn down. (...Sounds as if they ruined the town centre).\n\t\n\tAlthough situated in the county of Buckinghamshire, which is one of the more affluent parts of the country, Wycombe contains some considerably deprived areas. In 2007, a GMB Union survey ranked the Wycombe district as the 4th. dirtiest in the South East, and the 26th. dirtiest in the whole of the UK. The survey found litter on 28.5% of streets and highways.\n\t\n\t<u>High Wycombe Politics</u>\n\t\n\tWycombe's political history extends back to 1295. \n\t\n\tThe Wycombe Constituency has continuously elected Conservative Members of Parliament since 1951.\n\t\n\tHigh Wycombe has been home to two Prime Ministers:\n\t\n\t- The Earl of Shelburne lived at what is now Wycombe Abbey. \n\t\n\t- Benjamin Disraeli, who lived at nearby Hughenden Manor, was defeated as an independent candidate in 1832, but won the election in 1868 and 1874-1880 as a Conservative. Disraeli made his first political speech in Wycombe, from the portico over the door of the Red Lion Hotel on the High Street (now Iceland/Bargain buys). \n\t\n\tAlthough the hotel has gone, the portico with the red lion on top has survived - you can just about see it on the right, beyond the yellow car.\n\t\n\t<u>Weighing the Mayor</u>\n\t\n\tA ceremony carried out in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At the beginning and end of each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public to see whether or not he or she has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense. \n\t\n\tThe custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th. century. When the result is known, the town crier announces &quot;And No More!&quot; if the mayor has not gained weight, or &quot;And Some More!&quot; if they have. Their actual weight is not declared.\n\t\n\t<u>Media Coverage of High Wycombe</u>\n\t\n\tHigh Wycombe has been featured in the national media in recent years for a number of different reasons, including:\n\t\n\t- Coverage of the local library's refusal to display a Christmas carol service poster.\n\t\n\t- The triple shooting of three young Asian men.\n\t\n\t- A small-scale riot between feuding families and gangs in which knives, metal poles, and an axe were used whilst a gunman sprayed bullets.\n\t\n\t- The shooting and murder of Natasha Derby at point-blank range in the middle of a busy dance floor at a town centre venue.\n\t\n\t- The town appeared in national and international media after anti-terrorism raids were carried out as part of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Five arrests were made at three different houses in the town's Totteridge and Micklefield areas. A number of houses in High Wycombe were evacuated in Walton Drive, which is thought to be because one of the raided houses contained dangerous liquid chemicals.\n\t\n\t- On the 21st. December 2009, heavy snowfall hit the town, paralysing its road network (which is mainly on steep hills), and causing major disruption to refuse services for several weeks. Staff and customers of the John Lewis department store were stranded overnight.\n\t\n\t<u>Notable Residents of High Wycombe</u>\n\t\n\tPast and present residents of High Wycombe include:\n\t\n\t(a) Entertainment and the Media:\n\t\n\tAlexander Aze – child actor.\n\tColin Baker – actor who played the sixth incarnation of the Doctor in Doctor Who.\n\tKaty Brand - Comedian and writer.\n\tMighty Boosh stars Noel Fielding and Dave Brown met when they attended Bucks New University in Wycombe.
