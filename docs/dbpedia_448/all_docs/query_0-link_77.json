        "text": "Alfred was born on 5th June 1824 and Baptized at St Olave’s Church, Old Jewry, City of London on 6th October. He was one of the sons of Charles Pritchett and Sarah Bousfield. Charles was a silk manufacturer at 50 Cheapside and the family home at that time was 26 Old Jewry.\n\nBy 1841 they had moved to Sth Adelphi Place, Camberweil — a row of houses built between 1830-1834, long demolished, which stood in the area of Denmark Hill/Coldharbour Lane.\n\nThe census shows Charles Bousfield, aged 55, Silk Merchant, with five of his children, including 15 year old Alfred, whose 7 year old sister, Cornelia Sophia would eventually marry the Reverend Hugh Huleatt. Ten years later, Alfred aged 25 was a Student at Queens College, Cambridge, where he attained a BA and MA.\n\nThe 1851 census also records his father and sisters Emily aged 21 and Cornelia 17, the latter as ‘Scholar at home’, still residing at Sth Adelphi Piace, together with two house servants.\n\nWooden Box\n\nBy 1860, Rev. Alfred Bousfield was Curate at Woodville, a village which, until 1845, was called Wooden Box. It had once been known as such after the wooden toll booth on the road between Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Burton-upon-Trent.\n\nExtract from a directory of 1850:\n\n....Woodville, near Ashby-de—la-Zouch, one mile from Hartshorne, is a large and well built flourishing village. The new church of St. Stephen is a small stone edifice and the living is of perpetual curacy in the incumbency of the Reverend Alfred Bousfield. The Parsonage, built in 1845, is a neat brick residence near the church......\n\nThe 1861 census shows that Rev. Bousfield, aged 35, unmarried, incumbent of Woodville was living at the Parsonage with two servants. He was still In Woodville in 1863 when a further Directory was published. Part of the village at that time was situated in Derbyshire, with the remainder in Leicestershire, Until 1897 when both areas of Woodville were combined to fall within the County of Derbyshlre.\n\nMarriage and Move to Warwickshire\n\nIn 1862, in the Farnham area of Surrey, Alfred Bousfield married Emma Paice. By 1868, he was Vicar at the church of St Peter ad vincula, Ratley, Warwickshire, very close to Edge Hill, site of the First battle of the English Civil War. He remained at Ratiey until 1875.\n\nBuckinghamshire\n\nBy 1877 Rev. Alfred Bousfield had retired and with wife Emma, moved to Loosley House, Loosley Row. The previous oocupants had been the Rev. William Johnson Burgess, vicar of St John’s Church, Lacey Green, and his family, who relocated to the newly built Parsonage at Lacey Green.\n\nIn 1878, James Wilberforce Stephen, (whom had emigrated to Australia in 1855) with his wife and two daughters, Katherine and Amy, returned to England on holiday. During that time, the family visited various places in Buckinghamshire and, most importantly for James, ''Collins'' in Loosley Row. His young daughter Katherine wrote home to her Aunt (James' unmarried sister) about the visit, described the interior of the house in detail and the hospitality of the owners, Mr & Mrs Bousfield. Whilst in Loosley Row, the family also visited Gommes' Foundry and met other local villagers, who remembered James Wilberforce Stephen and some of his siblings as children. An extract of the letter is reproduced below:\n\nExtract of letter dated 29th June 1873 from Katherine_Vernon Stephen to her Aunt Henrietta Stephen in Victoria, Australia in which she describes 'Collins', Loosley Row.\n\n'Oxford Terrace, London Saturday, June 23rd 1878.\n\nMy dear Aunt.....\n\n..... ..l have a most awful lot to tell you, for we have been to see ''Collins''..... Papa, Mama, Amy and I went to Princes Risborough early and drove to a small hotel called the 'George', then Papa hired a small wagonette and we drove to ''Collins''.\n\nYou should have seen how very excited Papa got at seeing everything.... ...Papa went in first to ask Mr Bousfield if we might look at the garden and he said certainly we could, so we all went in and Mrs Bousfield came as well and we went all over the area. I think it is so very pretty. Papa says it was exactly as it was when you lived there, except the trees are much larger. It was so beautifully cool in the garden.\n\nMrs Bousfield was so nice, she showed us all over the house, we went into your little sitting room. Mrs Bousfield says that this is her own private room and nobody is allowed to disturb her in it. We saw Grandmama's room and the little dressing room off it that Uncle Hastings used to sleep in and we saw your bedroom and all the others. Grandpapa's study is Mr and Mrs Bousfield's bedroom. She said it was such a very pretty room that they settled at once it should be their bedroom. Grandmama's little sitting room is Mr Bousfield's workshop.\n\nl think it is such a very nice house. I never thought it was anything like what it is. They are such queer little stairs up to Grandmama's bedroom. They wanted us to stay for lunch, but we had had our lunch before. Mrs Bousfield would take us down to her larder of which she is very proud and it was so beautifully cool.......\n\n('Uncle Hastings', mentioned in the letter, was one of the brothers of James Wilberforce Stephen. He was Baptized at St John's Church, Lacey Green on 12th August 1837....'Hastings FitzEdward Murphy, born 25 March 1837, son of George & Henrietta Stephen of 'Collins', Loosley Row, Solicitor.)\n\nEmma Bousfield died in 1895 aged 66. She was buried at St John's Churchyard, Lacey Green on 31st October.\n\nOn 13th May 1900 Rev. Alfred Bousfield died at Loosley House. The entry in the Burial Register for St. John's, Lacey Green, reads:\n\n'Burried: 19th May 1900 Rev. Alfred Bousfield, aged 76, Clerk in Holy Orders of Loosley House'.\n\nWills Index\n\nReverend Alfred Bousfield of Loosley House, Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, Clerk, died 13th May 1900.\n\nProbate Oxford 26 July to Hugh Huleatt, Major in the Royal Engineers.\n\nEffects; £38,220. 5s. 9d in the United Kingdom in 1900 = £5.5 Million in 2022.\n\nHugh Huleatt was the Nephew of Rev. Bousfield - his sister Cornelia's son.\n\nLoosley House\n\nAs far as can be ascertained however, Loosley House was never Occupied by Major Hugh Huleatt, and the property was inherited by his sister, Constance Sarah Tighe - nee Huleatt - Alfred Bousfield's niece.\n\nCharles, the second son of the Reverend Hugh and Cornelia Sophia Huleatt nee Bousfield was to lead an active and interesting life, until it ended suddenly and tragically at the age of 45.\n\nHe was born at Potters Bar, Herefordshire in 1863 and educated at Magdalen College, Oxford where he read classics. After graduating, Charles went on to Wycliffe Hall, Dartford for two years of theological study until 1888 and then took Holy Orders.\n\nAfter Curacies at Swansea and St Mark's Church, Broadwater Down, near Worthing, Sussex he travelled to Egypt as a Commonwealth and Continental Church Society Chaplain at the Luxor Hotel, where services were held for the tourists. Charles was also a missionary and preached at a mud-brick church in Luxor. (This church was swept away in a flood during 1910).\n\nIn 1892, Charles retumed to England and in the Marylebone district of London was married. No further details have been found of this marriage.\n\nBack in Egypt, whilst visiting antique markets in Luxor in search of religious artefacts, he purchased three tiny fragments of papyrus, which contained Greek writing on both sides. Charles donated these to Magdalen College and arranged for his mother to send them to Oxford by recorded delivery. Two months later, having received no acknowledgement that they had arrived, he wrote to the college librarian. lt is understood that subsequent correspondence between the two has survived and is held in the college library/archives.\n\nInitially, the fragments were believed to date from AD 180-200 and for nearly 100 years visitors to the college hardly noticed them in a butterfly display cabinet — next to Oscar Wilde's ring. They have since been re~examined and dated to AD 60, allegedly parts of a 1st century copy of the Gospel of St Matthew. Now called the ‘Magdalen Papyrus’ or ‘Jesus Papers’ they are said to be the most widely discussed fragments of the New Testament in the world.\n\nBy 1900 Charles was a widower and returned to England, where his second marriage took place. On 30th August at St Stephen's Church, Kensington he married Caroline Harriet Wylie, daughter of stockbroker Richard Wylie. His mother, Cornelia S. Huleatt was one of the witnesses. The certificate also records that an Arthur Cazalet, late Priest/vicar of Truro, also attended the wedding. Charles Bousfield Huleatt, ‘Clerk of Holy Orders‘, was aged 36 and his bride 37 years old. An earlier census records Caroline's place of birth as Bombay, East India (British subject). It is believed that soon after the wedding Charles and Caroline left for ltaly.\n\nIn 1901 they travelled to Messina, Sicily, where the Rev. Charles Huleatt was much involved with the Messina Football Club, becoming only the second ever Manager of the club and was also known to Captain the team on the field. ln 1904 Charles and the team played in the Whittaker Challenge Cup beating the Palermo team 3-2 and acquired their first trophy.\n\nBy the middle of 1908, Charles was again back in England, staying with his sister, Constance Sarah Tiighe and her family at Loosley House, Loosley Row, Buckinghamshire. During that visit, on 6th September at St John's Church, Lacey Green, he Baptized baby Constance Lillah GOMME, whose mother Ellen Nolan Gomme (nee Thrupp) and father Ralph Gomme, had both worked for the Tighe family at Loosley House, along with Constances' Grandmother, Elizabeth Thrupp as housekeeper/cook. Elizabeth had been connected with the Huleatt family for very many years. In 1871 she was employed in the Woolwich household of Charles’ parents — the Rev. Hugh Huleatt and his wife Cornelia and would have known Charles Bousfield Huleatt and his Siblings from their childhood.\n\nConstance Lillah (to become Connie Baker) was told that she was the very last baby to be Baptized by the Rev. Charles Bousfield Huleatt before he returned to Sicily. (A copy of the Baptism entry for St John's, Lacey Green confirms this, records his signature and ‘Messina’ written below his name). The Vicar of St John's at that time was Rev. William Robson.\n\nBack in Messina, Charles’ last game with the football club took place on 20th December, when the Messina team won 3-nil against Palermo. Just eight days later, at 5.20am on 28th December 1908, a devastating earthquake and tsunami occurred along the Straits of Messlna, between the island of Sicily and mainland Italy. Messina was almost completely destroyed and took the lives of between 50,000 and 100,000 people. Amongst that number was the Rev. Charles Bousfleld Huleatt, together with his wife Caroline, their three children and a daughter from Charles’ first marriage.\n\nMessina was in complete chaos and it took the men of the ‘Lancashire Cruiser‘, made up of English sailors, Four days to find the family buried under the ruins of their house... ...but it was too late, all had perished.\n\nA large quantity of damaged silver items was retrieved from the middle of the house and shipped home to England. Charles’ sister, Constance Sarah Tighe decided to distribute the silver amongst the servants at Loosley House. Most items were eventually sold, but a silver toast rack still remains in the care of Elizabeth Thrupp's Granddaughter. Initially in a battered and crumpled condition, it was straightened out at Gomme's Forge.\n\nCharles had not made a Will, but details of Administration appear in the Probate Index\n\n1909 Reverend Charles Bousfield Huleatt of 70 Via Torrente Trapani, Messina, Italy\n\nClerk, died 28 December I908.\n\nAdministration London 20 July 1909\n\nto Constance Sarah Tighe (wife of Michael Augustus Tighe).\n\nEffects: £735. 8s. 10d resworn: £813. 18s. 10d.\n\nMichael Augustus Tighe was born at Templecombe, Somerset in 1861. By 1881 he was a Lieutenant in the 1st Derby Militia, and an article dated 16th October in ‘The Royal Irish Rifles’ reported that he had been appointed as a Probationer in the Indian Staff Corps.\n\nHe married Constance Sarah HULEATT (daughter of the Rev. Hugh Huleatt] about 1888 in Hyderabad, Deccan, India, where their twin daughters, Cornelia and Constance were born in 1890. Cornelia was named after her maternal Grandmother Cornelia Sophia Huleatt (nee Bousfield).\n\nWhen the 1891 census was taken, they were back in England and living in Surrey:\n\nThe Cottage. Shalford.

By that time Michael Augustus Tighe was a Major in the Indian Army. Michael Tighe and family were away from home when the 1901 census was taken On 31st March.\n\nThe 1911 census records Michael and Constance Tighe and children were visiting Cornelia Sophia Huleatt (Constance's widowed mother) at her large New Forest mansion, Annersley House, in Bank near Lyndhurst, Hampshire. (In 1943, the property opened as a Dr Barnardo's Home.)\n\nA Supplement to the ‘London Gazette’, dated 1st January 1919 regarding the Volunteer Force during the First World War, states:\n\n'4th vol.

Tighe finally retired from army service in India, he arranged for his Sepoy (Indian soldier} named Isma to return with him to Loosley House. During that time, Ismo had his photograph taken, taught Ellen Nolan Thrupp how to cook curry dishes and, at his own request,\n\npreferred to sleep in a tent in the large rear garden at Loosley House. However, Ismo oould not get used to the cold English weather and eventually returned home to India.\n\nIn 1921 Michael Tighe was appointed High Sheriff/Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire - a title awarded annually.\n\nHe died in 1932: the Wills Index records:\n\nMichael Augustus Tighe of Loosley House, Princes Risborough died 21st September 1932.\n\nProbate (save and except settled land) London 8 November to Sir James Leigh-Wood, CMG., CB., KBE.,\n\nand Dick Dalrymple Goldingham, Insurance Underwriter.\n\nEffects: £983. 3s.\n\nNational Portrait Gallery\n\nA portrait of Michael Augustus Tighe, Indian Army Officer, is held at the National Portrait Gallery, Trafalgar Square, London.\n\nHis widow, Constance, died ten years later.

Os. 10d.\n\nElizabeth was born between 1830/34 in Illminster Somerset, the daughter of John Grabham, farmer. In her late teens or early twenties she moved to London where on 20th March 1853, at the Church of St John of Wapping, Middlesex, she married George William Broughton,, a weaver, son of a cabinet maker. At time of marrlage George was living at 8 Green Bank and Elizabeth at 1 Morgan Street, Commercial Road.\n\nBy 1871 Elizabeth was widowed and employed in the large household of the Chaplain of the Forces (Royal Artillery), Hugh Huleatt, his wlfe Cornelia and their children in the Officers Quarters, Woolwich Common. Elizabeth Broughton was then aged 37. Her friend and colleague, Lydia Baker was, later the same year, one of the witnesses at Elizabeth's second marriage.\n\nOn 16th November 1871 at St Mary Magdalene Church, Woolwich, Elizabeth married Royal Artillery Sergeant Charles Thrupp, who was born in Northern Ireland. The ceremony was conducted by the Chaplain Hugh Huleatt who, together wlth his wife, signed the register as witnesses: they were also to play an important part in Elizabeth‘s future.\n\nElizabeth and Charles’ daughter, Ellen Nolan Thrupp was born on 25th November 1876 and baptized at Mary Magdalene church in Woolwich on 22nd‘ December.\n\nCharles was born about 1839 in Charlemont, County Armagh, Northern lreland. He joined the Royal Artillery at the age of 18 on 14th October, 1857. Durling that time he was awarded Five Good Conduct Badges and a silver medal. His physlcal description states that he was: 5ft 7“ of dark complexion, with brown hair and dark hazel eyes. In 1879 Charles, at his own request, was dlscharged from the Royal Artillery after 21 years, 226 days service.\n\nThe 1881 Census records that Charles (aged 40), wife Elizabeth (aged 47) and their 4 year old daughter Ellen Nolan was residing at 5 Lansdown Terrace, Lewisham, South London. Charles, occupation shown as 'Messenger'. Five years later he died at the age of 45.\n\nOnce again Elizabeth was widowed, but her former employers at the Royal Artillery Woolwich the Rev. Hugh Huleatt and his wife ensured she had secure employment and a home with Cornelias' brother, the retired Rev. Alfred Bousfield and his wife Emma at Loosley House, Loosley Row, Buckinghamshire. The 1891 Census records Elizabeth working there as a cook. The only other occupants at the time the Census was taken on 5th April were Florence Parker, 20 years old, a housemaid and Charlott: Potter, aged 18 - a parlourmaid.\n\nIn 1911, when the census was taken, Elizabeth gave her age as 8O and was still employed at Loosley House as Housekeeper. The only other people recorded there at that time were Hettie Gooden, a 26 year old Parlourmaid and Nellie Rutland, aged 20 worklng as a Housemaid. At one time, Madge Gomme (sister of Hilda Gomme, the postlady was also employed at Loosley House as a Parlourmaid. The Tighe famlly were away when the Census was taken on 2nd April.\n\nElizabeth Thrupp died in 1915, aged 85 and was burried at St John's Church, Lacey Green.\n\nAn Act of Parliament in the UK -The National Registration Act, 1939. was introduced as an emergency measure at the outbreak of World War 2: Royal assent was given on 5th September 1939. A massive administrative task was underway — the taking of the registration was one of\n\nthe most important documents of the 20th century. The initial reglstration was used to produce Identity Cards, organise rationing and keep a check on where the population was residing. Forms were issued to more than 41 million people and later the information was also used in the founding of the National Health Service.\n\nThe 1931 Census was destroyed in an air raid during WW1 at Hayes, Middlesex where the Census papers were deposited. A 1941 Census was never taken, so the 1939 Register is invaluable for research purposes.\n\nLoosley House, Lower Road, Loosley Row\n\nThe house, or part of it, was used at the start of World War II for evacuees from the North Kensington Nursery School. Below are details from the 1939 register. Many of the names have been ‘blacked out’ with the words ‘This record is officially closed‘. The modern term is 'redacted'.\n\nThe remaining entries list staff and some of the children at the school In Loosley Row. It would have been a peaceful haven for all, with a large garden and well away from the Blitz on London. Only names, dates of birth and description of work (where applicable) were recorded.

Kathleen May Mercer came from Banstead, Surrey and stayed in Lacey Green for the remainder of her life. During her time in this area she met a 'local lad’, Bert Ralph George Dell from Hickman’s Stores, Main Road, Lacey Green. May was a bridesmaid at his brother's wedding in 1954 and Bert was the Best Man.\n\nOn 4th August 1956 Bert and May were married at St John’s Church, Lacey Green. For many years both ran the grocery shop/general store and were much admired by the local community for the efficient and friendly way they conducted business. The shop was also a favourite ‘meeting place’ for many villagers, especially the elderly living alone.\n\nThe price on the pump appears to read that the petrol was 1s. 5d a gallon!\n\nChildren\n\nThe majority of entries for the names of children have also been ‘blacked out’, below are those remaining with their dates of birth:\n\nAlice Blaxall\n\nHenry Batchelor\n\nGloria Iohnson\n\n]ean Melville\n\nWilliam Moore\n\nEdwin Newton\n\nPatricia Pittharn\n\nFrank Seidler\n\nJohn Wheeler 3.10.1937\n\n3.2.1936\n\n7.7.1936\n\n2.4.1936\n\n27.2.1937\n\n1936\n\n1.4.1937\n\n24.1.1936\n\n14.9.1938\n\nAnother episode in the long and varied history of Loosley House and the people who resided there over the years.\n\nGeorge Floyd was apparently a 'go ahead chap' and soon developed other sidelines, in conjunction with the shop. He kept and fattened pigs and also bought in fat pigs for slaughter. The photograph shows George Floyd in the middle of the ghastly ritual of killing a pig. Needless to say, it was his wife who cured the bacon and the hams, then prepared the lard, which was sold in the shop.\n\nHe then bought a horse and cart and started selling coal, collecting it from the goods yard at Princes Risborough Railway Station.\n\nLater he again 'branched out', bought a second horse and cart, employed a Harry Gomme as driver and commenced a Carriers business. Every Friday (market day) he would collect fish and newspapers from High Wycombe and parcels to and from both railway stations.\n\nHe then undertook outside catering for such occasions as the Chapel outings. A late resident of Loosley Row recalled serving tea, lemonade, ginger beer, cakes and buns from trestle tables at Whiteleaf - a popular place for outings.\n\nAlways a keen gardener, George Floyd at one time had been Head Gardener to 'Squire' Forrest at Grymsdyke, Lacey Green. He was often in demand to judge the allotments at Longwick. Added to the above, George was also Secretary to two local slate clubs (an early form of savings clubs) at The Sprat and The Whip public houses.\n\nGeorge Floyd's youngest daughter Emily married a farmer's son, Arthur W. Harvey. Arthur was born in 1902 at Bryants Bottom, one of a large family and his father occupied a number of farms in the area. lt was from Lodge Hill Farm, Saunderton that Arthur left to marry Emily Floyd in 1930. He moved into the shop, but continued to work as a builder for White Brothers, High Wycombe. When his father-in-law George Floyd died, Arthur Harvey took over the coal and Carriers business.\n\nThis was when the name of the shop changed to Harvey's Stores. The name board 'A.W. HARVEY' was on the brickwork above the grey slate roof of the shop below. (Although now removed the evidence it was there can still be seen in 2024) He added a Sub-Post Office, whilst his wife Emily and her mother looked after the shop.\n\nAt the outbreak of the 2nd World War, Arthur took a job in an aircraft factory and after the war was employed at the then named Bomber Command, Walters Ash, full time until he was 65, then part-time to the age of 70.\n\nArthur and Emily Harvey's daughter, Edna, like her mother and grandmother before her, worked in the shop. In 1961 when her mother died, Edna took over with some help from her father and her husband Donald Bailey. So Edna was kept very busy with husband, son and ageing father to care for, in addition to the shop.\n\nIn 1970 Edna decided to give up the business, had a 'Sale', and it closed for good. Thus ending more than a century of invaluable service to the two villages.\n\nArthur Harvey lived on with his daughter, son-in-law and Grandson until his death, aged 77 in August 1980.\n\nGeorge and Annie Floyd (nee Janes] and their daughters Annie, Daisy and Emily\n\nWILL of Henry Janes\n\nThis the Last Will and Testament of me, Henry Janes of Lacey Green in the Parish of Princes Risborough, in the Country of Buckinghamshire.\n\nI hereby revoke all Wills made by me at any time hereforeto made.

One theory suggests the site once contained two or more cottages dating from the 1840's, which belonged to the Baptist Chapel next door. lf not demolished, these were possibly altered and enlarged over the years to form the basis of the current house.\n\nThe house was not specifically named: residents appeared in census returns and directories merely as living at 'Loosley Hill' or 'crossroads, Loosley Row'.\n\n1869 - 1929 - The Watson Family\n\nWhen Doctor S.B. Watson moved into the house with his family about 1869, it was the beginning of occupation by members of the Watson family for 60 years.\n\nBenjamin Seth Watson was born in Southwark, London about 1811 and studied at St John's College, Oxford, later becoming one of the Physicians at Oxford Hospital.\n\nIn 1840. he married Isabella Maria Goolden: their two daughters, Mary and Penelope were subsequently born in Maidenhead, Berkshire. A son, Thomas Henry Gordon was born around 1848 St George, Hanover Square, London.\n\nBy I861, Seth, his wife and three children were residing at Hall Place, Wycombe End, Beaconsfield, which also included a private school. Some of the pupils were Seth's Nieces and Nephews, whose places of birth are recorded in the 1861 census as 'East India, British Subjects'. There were four other pupils originating from various parts of England. The household was considerably large: it included a Governess, her Assistant, Semptress, Cook, two Housemaids, Coachman and a Garden Boy!\n\nA Directory for 1864 indicates that Doctor Watson was working as a Physician from a property in the High Street, Beaconsfield. By 1869, he is recorded at Loosley Row.\n\nIn 1871 he was temporarily staying in Lincolnshire, attending as Physician to the Earl of Lindsey - Peer of the Realm, George Augustus Bertie at Uppington House.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Watson's daughter, Penelope was visiting friends in Paddington, but his wife, Isabella and daughter Mary, aged 27, were resident at 'Loosley Hill'. The household also included various visitors and Boarders, plus a Cook, Nurse and Housemaid.\n\n1871 Census\n\nIsabella Maria Watson Wife Mar. 61 Physicians wife Maidenhead, Berks Mary A.S.

A year later Mary Watson married Mrs Poulter's son -details below).\n\nLiving next door or nearby was a Charles Collins and his family. Employed as a gardener and wife, Ann as Laundress, they were probably working for the Watson family.\n\nFamily Wedding\n\nAt St John's Church, Lacey Green on 24th July 1872 Mary Ann Spencer Watson, Spinster of Loosley Row, daughter of Seth B. Watson, MD, married Reginald Clifford Poulter, Bachelor, Gentleman, BA of 22 Alfred Street, Bedford Square, London, son of James Poullter, Clerk MA.\n\nFamily Bereavment\n\nA year later, Isabella Watson died at the age of 63. She was buried in St. John's Churchyard Lacey Green on 26 February 1873.\n\nOn 11th October the same year, an auction notice appeared in the Bucks Herald:\n\nThe property for whatever reason, was not sold and Dr. Watson continued to occupy the house.\n\nIn 1881, with daughter Penelope, he, is recorded visiting friends at 10 St. James Terrace, Paddington.\n\nAnother wedding in the Family\n\nBanns were called on three occasions - the last on 29th March 1885 for the marriage of Thomas Henry Gordon Watson, Bachelor of this Parish to Ruth Rusher, Spinster of the Parish of Bloomsbury, Middlesex.\n\nCopy of entry in Marriage Register of Parish Church of St. George, Bloomsbury, Middlesex\n\nTragic Accident\n\nAt about 7.30pm on Friday, 15th May I835, Dr Seth Watson saw his neighbour Thomas Harvey with his son's horse and expressed his intention of going for a ride. Tom saddled up the horse and led it and the rider to the Firr Plantation. Dr Watson asked to have the reins so that he might have a canter. Tom asked if he was capable and the rider replied he was.\n\nThe horse started to canter and Tom ran by its side for 40 or 50 yards, when suddenly the horse stumbled and Dr Watson was thrown over its neck. Tom ran to stop the horse, but the doctor had his foot caught in the stirrup and was dragged for about 20 yards. Mr Thomas Warren, Surgeon of Princes Risborough was called but tragically, Dr Watson was declared dead. At the Inquest, which was held at The Sprat public house, a verdict of Accidental Death was recorded.\n\n(Precis of local newspaper report).\n\nMany tributes were paid to Dr Watson who, it was reported, had resided in this neighbourhood for a number of years and was held in very high esteem by all who knew him for his genial manner and kindness of heart.\n\nAnother 'memoir' was reported in the local newspaper, reproduced below:\n\n'.....Doctor S. B. Watson, a man of no ordinary character was a member of St John's College, Oxford and took his degree of Doctor of Medicine in that University. He was for some time Physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary and marked his tenure of office there by the discontinuance of the practice of bleeding in the treatment of disease. He afterwards resided and practised several years in London, but for the last twenty-five years his home had been in Buckinghamshire. He was a man of great intellectual power and attainments and his intimate friends feel that by his death a light has been quenched: an ever-fresh spring of original thought, humour and practical wisdom has been closed to them.\n\nAn unpublished MSS by Samuel Taylor Coleridge on 'The Theory of Life' was edited and published by Dr Watson. A translation from an Italian work on the cholera at Malta, also a translation in verse of the Promethiens Vinctus, were among his publications.\n\nHe could never be persuaded to publish any more important original work of his own. But amongst his friends are scattered sonnets and other poems, which are cherished by them as amongst the most beautiful things in the English language. No man shunned more than Dr Watson a reputation for piety, yet upon few men had the real power of religion a stronger and more constant influence. He was a devoted son of the Church of England and acted as a lay member of the Oxford Diocesan Conference and served for some time as a lay reader at Longwick in the Parish of Princes Risborough. His influence for good in the inner life of those with whom he was brought into contact is not to be measured. By his own simple, self-denying life, and his kindness and devotion to those in need, he has won the heartfelt respect and affection of his poorer neighbours at Loosley Row and Lacey Green, amongst whom he spent the last years of his life and amongst whom, he died.\n\nHe left no Will but Administration of his personal estate was granted at the Principal Registry on 29th August to the Reverend Thomas Henry Gordon Watson of Loosley Row, Clerk, the son and one of the next of kin. The value of his estate was £479. 8s. 9d.\n\nIn 1891 Penelope A.S. Watson was residing at the family home in Loosley Row. She had one domestic servant livlng in - Mary Ann Floyd, unmarried aged 55.\n\next door was Thomas Harvey's Grocer’s Shop (the little shuttered-window cottage which still remains). With him was his wife Ellen and daughter Susan, a 10 year old scholar.\n\ny 1901 clrcumstances remained the same for Penelope Watson. She lived alone, apart from one servant - Kate Harvey. The last census currently available is for 1911, which records:\n\nLoosley Hill\n\nPenelope Anne Statter Watson Head Single 66 Private means Mary Ann Fowler Serv. Single 55 General domestic servant\n\nThe census also states that there were seven rooms in the property.\n\nThe End of an Era\n\nOlder Loosley Row residents recalled that as an elderly lady, Miss Watson kept a number of goats in the Field where the water pump is situated. Sometimes the goats would escape and cause havoc in the locality until they were rounded up.\n\nPenelope Watson died on 4th June 1929. She left a Will with the index details as follows:-\n\nWATSON Penelope Ann Statter of Loosley Hill, Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire\n\nSpinster, died 4 June 1929.\n\nProbate London 18 August to Edward Clifford Watson, Commander Royal Navy and Leonard Burton Watson, Solicitor.\n\nEffects: £3,674. 16s. 4d.\n\nThe above named were possibly Penelope Watson’s nephews (or Great Nephews).\n\nDirectories for 1931 — 1939 record the owner of the house as Arthur Crofton-Attkins. The address at that time shown as Crossroads, Loosley Row.\n\nBy 1945 Robert and Margaret H. Floss lived there.\n\nThe electoral register for 1953-4 recorded the ocoupants as Martin and Ruby Ann Longley and it appears it was about that time, the house was named ‘Loosley Dene’.\n\nBy 1957-58, Martin Longley was still recorded at the address, along with a Dorothy Longley.\n\nLicence For Jesse Ward To Sell Stamps\n\nA Licence to sell postage stamps was granted on 5th July 1848 to Jesse Ward of Loosley Row, Tring. (The address including ‘Tring’ arose from the fact that this was the postal town for the district until at least 1910.)\n\nAt that time mail arrived in Princes Risborough from Tring by mail cart at 7.0am each morning, with the exception of Monday, when it was delayed until 10.45am. Outgoing mail was despatched every evening at 7.0pm.\n\nhe Licence was connected with an Act passed in the fourth year of the reign of King William IV to:\n\n‘prevent the selling and uttering of forged stamps and to exempt from Stamp Duty artificial Mineral Waters in Great Britain and to allow a drawback on the exportation of Gold and Silver plate manufactured in Ireland’.\n\nIt is believed that Loosley Row Post Office was one of the earliest established in the country. In a Trade Directory for 1853 Jesse Ward is recorded as Postmaster, grocer, shopkeeper and carpenter. After Jesse's death he was succeeded by his son, Alfred, who continued as Postmaster until his death in 1906, when his daughter Mary Ann Ward, known as ‘Polly, took over the role as Postmistress, with one female assistant. After she married Henry Allen in 1913, he became Postmaster and Stationer, selling postcards of Looslev Row.\n\nThe Ward Family\n\nThe Ward family originated from Speen, where Jesse was born on 9th August 1799, son of Joseph and Rebecca Ward, Carpenter.\n\nOn 12th March 1827 at St Mary's Church, Princes Risborough: Jesse Ward 'bachelor of Speen' married Ruth Eggleton, 'spinster of Loosley Row '. The witnesses were Levi Ward and Ann Parslow. There is an additional entry stating 'with consent of parents'. Ruth was the daughter of Thomas and Mary Eggleton, baker of Loosley Row. She was born on 1st November 1810 and therefore only about 16 when married.\n\nAfter their wedding, the couple resided at Loosley Row and 'following in his father's footsteps', Jesse was employed as a carpenter. Their home was the cottage, later to become the Post Office and Grocer's shop in Lower Road, (situated just below where 'Green Pastures' now stands).\n\nFor some unknown reason, Jesse and Ruth were not baptized until adulthood. On 9\" December 1838, together with two of their sons and daughter, all five were Christened on the same day at St. Mary's Church, Princes Risborough:-\n\nSons Alfred (born 24.1.1827) Jabez (born 3.9.1832) and daughter Mary Anne (born 28.4.1834) (Jesse and Ruth also had another son John who was born about 1839, but there is no trace of his Baptism in the Parish Register transcripts).\n\nA Trade Directory of 1847 shows Jesse Ward as Carpenter & Shopkeeper at Loosley Row. By 1854, the premises also incorporated a Post Office. Jesse continued working as carpenter and joiner, whilst his wife Ruth was in charge of the Post Office and Stores until her death in 1848.\n\n1851 Census, Loosley Row (census taken on 30, March)\n\nJesse Ward Head Widower 57 Carpenter (born: Speen) Alfred Ward Son Unmar. 23 Carpenter Jabez Ward Son Unmar. 18 Carpenter Mary Ann Ward Dau.

Minor, Bachelor, Carpenter of Loosley Row, son of Jesse Ward, Carpenter\n\nto\n\nAmelia PHILBEY, full age, Spinster of Loosley Row, daughter of Joseph Philbey Gentleman's Servant.\n\nWitnesses:\n\nAbel Dell; Alfred Ward; Mary Ward; Mary A Burgess and James Maberly.\n\nThe wedding was conducted by the Reverend William Burgess who, at that time, resided at 'Loosley House' before moving with his family to Lacey Green Parsonage. His wife Mary Anne sometimes acted as a witness to marriages. Amelia's father, Joseph Philbey - 'Gentleman's Servant' was most likely to have been employed at 'Loosley House'.\n\nThe above was actually the very first marriage to take place at St John's Church, Lacey Green. Prior to that villagers from the Upper Hamlets (Loosley Row, Lacey Green and Speen) had to travel to St Mary's Church, Princes Risborough for weddings.\n\nIn 1858 Alfred Ward married Jane Maberly. The original 1861 census indicates that they were residing near to Alfred's father, Jesse:\n\nAlfred Ward Head Mar. 33 Carpenter and Joiner Jane Ward Wife 38 Lacemaker\n\nExtracts Of Entries In Alfred Ward's Ledger/Diary - 1854 to 1873\n\nA small beige embossed book with brass clasps\n\n(Ref: D 114/58 - Held in the Record Office, Aylesbury)\n\nThe entries are a mixture of personal details and accounts regarding Alfred's occupation as a Carpenter.

This lad was the Grandson of Jesse Ward. In 1859, Jesse's daughter Mary Ann had married one Abel Dell, a Shepherd. Later in 1871, at the age of 49 years, Alfred Ward's wife Jane died. A year later, he married again:\n\nAt St John's Church.

He was buried on the 15th in the churchyard at St John's, Lacey Green. He had made a Last Will & Testament:-\n\nThe Will of Jesse Ward late of Loosley Row in the Parish of Princes Risborough in the County of Buckingham, Carpenter and Grocer, who died 10th September 1881 at Loosley Row was Proved at Oxford by Alfred Ward of Loosley Row, Carpenter, the son, and Job Pearce of High Wycombe in the said County, Gentleman, the Executors.\n\nPersonal Estate: £501. 12s. 6d.\n\nTen years later, a new family resided at The Small House:\n\n1911 Census:\n\nSidney Hickman Head of family 34 Bricklayer Louisa Hickman wife 30 Reginald S. Hickman son 4\n\nSidney Hickman and Louisa Rutland were married on 4th October 1902 at St John's Church, Lacey Green. Their son Reginald Sidney Hickman was born in The Small House and Baptised at St John's Church, Lacey Green on 6th January 1907.\n\nBeer/Ale House\n\nFurther intriguing information provided by Reginald's daughter, Betty Biggs (nee Hickman) indicates that there was access/or a right of way alongside the property, which led to a beer house situated about halfway down the plot of land/garden belonging to The Small House. A map dated 1878 clearly indicates the access way from Lower Road and the O.S. map of 1898, in fact, shows a property built sideways to the road in the area described. However, this building does not appear on the O.S. map of 1921.\n\nThere were a number of beer or ale houses in Loosley Row: no licence was required and beer brewed at home could legally be sold from same to friends, neighbours or passers-by.\n\nOver the years nearby residents whilst gardening have found pieces of brick, tile, old nails and broken clay pipes in the location of the beer house. A local resident recalled seeing 'ruins' in the area.\n\nCoincidentally, Louisa's father Harry Rutland was Malster (a brewer of beer). It seems likely that he had a connection with that particular beer house. The Rutland family lived not far away in Woodway in one of the five cottages known as The Bunch, Loosley Row.\n\nDoctor Hans Ucko and son, Professor Peter Ucko\n\nA later occupant of The Small House was Jewish Physician Hans Ucko, born 19 January 1901. He came to England from Germany with wife Lotte just before the out break of World War 2 and their first address was 54 Welbeck Street, W1. He studied to be a Doctor at Berlin & Munich Universities and became a Professor of Endocrinology. Son, Peter John Ucko was born in London on 27 July 1938. Dr Ucko also took a great interest in music, conducting orchestras and arranging operas.\n\nThe family settled in Hampstead, where Dr Ucko established a private medical practice. The Voting Register for 1965 lists the family at Compayne Gardens, N.W.6. He bought The Small House as a weekend retreat, possibly soon after the 2nd World War.\n\nThe Small House did not have a telephone at that time, but one was located in the Post Office (now Green Pastures) directly opposite The Small House. It was arranged between the Postmaster, Mr Henry Allen and Doctor Ucko that when one of the latter's private patients telephoned the Post Of?ce wishing to speak to him, Mr Ward would open one of his upstairs windows and hang or wave a large red handkerchief out of same to attract Dr Ucko's attention that he had a telephone call waiting! Whether this unusual arrangement was successful is not known.\n\nWhen Mr Allen retired and Loosley Row Post Office was transferred to Harvey's Stores, Lower Road, Dr Ucko bought the Old Post Office premises, where his son Professor Peter Ucko later resided.\n\nPeter Ucko was an influential Archaeologist at University College, London and was also a Fellow of both the Royal Anthropological Institute and the Society of Antiquaries. He attained his BA and PhD in the Anthropology Department U.C.L., where he worked from 1962 to 1972, also publishing a number of significant books on Archaeology.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1981 he was Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra, Australia.\n\nHe lived at Green Pastures - the former Post Office, Lower Road, Loosley Row and will be remembered by many local residents.\n\nPeter Ucko died in London on 14 June 2007 and was interred in Highgate Cemetery."
