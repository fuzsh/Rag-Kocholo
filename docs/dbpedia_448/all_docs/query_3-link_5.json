        "text": "Buckinghamshire has produced a rich crop of talented individuals over the decades.\n\nMany of them have risen to become well-known faces across the country and, in some cases, the world.\n\nThere’s a few names you might not expect on this list - some of which you probably wouldn’t have guessed started life in the county of Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe majority of them have went on to stardom and have enjoyed being under the lights and in front of cameras in the bigger cities such as London and Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe list includes a who’s who of superstars – from a pop singer in one of the biggest girls bands of recent times to a rock and roll legend, an A-list television talk show host and a comedian – are all among a surprising list of names who either grew up or have spent some time in Buckinghamshire.\n\nWe've only included six people, but there are an entire array of other household names who grew up here in leafy Bucks.\n\nHow many of these big-timers did you know grew up near you?\n\n1. Leigh-Anne Pinnock:\n\nLeigh-Anne rose to fame after she and her bandmates in Little Mix won series eight of the British talent show, X Factor in 2011.\n\nBut before attaining superstar status, the 29-year-old pop sensation took her first steps in High Wycombe, where she was born and grew up.\n\nAs part of her educational journey, she attended Sir William Ramsay School on Rose Avenue, Hazlemere.\n\nLittle Mix have gone on to have four UK number one singles and have sold more than 50 million records worldwide.\n\n2. James Corden:\n\nAfter he became a household name and conquered British television, he packed his suitcase in the pursuit of dominating America, too.\n\nJust like Leigh-Anne, James Corden is also from South Bucks. He went to various schools in High Wycombe such as Holmer Green Senior School before graduating from the Jackie Palmer Stage School.\n\nCorden started to make waves on British television through his role as Smithy in the popular BBC show, Gavin and Stacey.\n\nHe is now one of Hollywood’s biggest celebrities and hosts his own late-night talk show called The Late Late Show with James Corden.\n\nThe show also features Carpool Karaoke – a popular segment in the show which has amassed millions of views on YouTube.\n\nHe has also hosted the Grammy Awards and A League of Their Own as well as featuring in various films.\n\n3. Eddie Howe:\n\nThe football manager became a well-known figure after he took charge of Bournemouth in 2009 – and as a result, became the youngest manager in the Football League.\n\nHe guided the team, also known as The Cherries, from the Championship to the Premier League before he left the club in the summer.\n\nEven though he moved to the Jurassic coast of Dorset when he was a young boy, Eddie was actually born in Amersham.\n\nPrior to becoming the club's manager, he made 200 appearances for Bournemouth as a player between 1994 and 2002 - scoring 10 goals.\n\n4. Fern Britton:\n\nFern Britton has been a long-standing figure in British television and got her big break when she presented the now defunct Ready Steady Cook show on BBC from 1994 to 2000.\n\nUnder her belt, she also has the title of hosting ITV’s This Morning from 1999 until 2009 as well as participating in Strictly Come Dancing in 2012.\n\nAlthough she was born in London, she spent her early years studying at Dr Challoner’s High School in Little Chalfont – a grammar school for girls aged between 11 and 18.\n\nShe currently lives in Holmer Green in High Wycombe.\n\n5. Sir Steve Redgrave:\n\nTo attest for how much he’s contributed to Buckinghamshire and how much the people love him, the man has his own statue in Marlow – the place where he was born.\n\nSir Steve Redgrave is the most successful male rower having won five Olympic gold medals in consecutive Olympic Games between 1984 and 2000.\n\nThe Olympics aside, he has won three Commonwealth Games gold medals and nine World Rowing Championship golds before retiring from competition.\n\nAs a kid, he went to Great Marlow School.\n\n6. Jimmy Carr:\n\nHe’s one of the most recognisable faces in British comedy. But the host of 8 out of 10 cats spent the bulk of his childhood in Farnham Common – a village in South Buckinghamshire. There, he went to Farnham Common School and then after Burnham Grammar School in Slough.\n\nHe also studied at Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe.\n\nCarr has hosted a long list of game shows with the likes of Distraction and Your Face or Mine on Channel 4 where couples guess how attractive or unattractive the public think they are."
