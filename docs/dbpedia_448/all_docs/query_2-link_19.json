He is known for his initial doubts about the resurrection of Jesus and for his later devotion to spreading the Gospel. He is remembered as an important figure in early Christianity and one of the greatest saints in the Catholic Church.\n\nAccording to the New Testament, Thomas was born in Galilee and was a fisherman before becoming one of Jesus’ disciples. He is often referred to as “Didymus” which means “Twin” in Greek, but there is no information about who his twin brother was. He was present at many of the key moments in Jesus’ life, including the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection.\n\nAfter the resurrection of Jesus, Thomas was one of the apostles who doubted the news of the resurrection. Jesus appeared to the apostles, and upon seeing Jesus, Thomas declared “My Lord and my God!” showing his faith in Jesus as the Messiah and son of God.\n\nThomas is considered to have a strong spiritual and religious nature, this and his determination led him to travel far and wide to spread the message of Jesus, he preached in many places like Mesopotamia, Persia, Parthia, and India. He is believed to have died as a martyr in India, where he is venerated as one of the patrons of the Syrian Christians in India, and his feast day is celebrated on July 3rd.\n\nAccording to tradition, Thomas is said to have established the church in India and is known as “Apostle of India.” He is believed to have preached in various parts of India, and established Christian communities in Malabar, South India.

He is the patron saint of architects, builders, and stone masons.\n\nSt. Thomas’ writings were not included in the New Testament canon, but several apocryphal texts, such as the Acts of Thomas and the Gospel of Thomas, have been attributed to him and are considered important early Christian texts. These texts provide valuable insights into the early Christian communities and their beliefs.\n\nIn art, St. Thomas is often depicted with the image of a builder, holding a carpenter’s square, a sign of his reputation as patron of builders and architects. He’s also depicted holding the spear that was used to pierce Jesus’ side during the crucifixion, symbolizing his doubts and later conviction about the resurrection.\n\nIn conclusion, St. Thomas the Apostle is remembered as an important figure in early Christianity, known for his initial doubts and later conviction about the resurrection of Jesus, and his devoted work spreading the Gospel in various places. His legacy and devotion are celebrated throughout the world and in many different Christian communities, and his teachings and example continue to inspire many people today.\n\nThe Life of St. Thomas the Apostle\n\nSt. Thomas the Apostle is the Patron Saint of Architects and Builder. St. Thomas was one of the chosen Twelve, otherwise called Didymus (twin). His name occurs in all of the Gospels, but in St. John’s Gospel he plays a prominent role. When Jesus announced His intention of returning to Judea to visit Lazarus, it was Thomas who said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with Him”. (John 11:16.)\n\nIt was St. Thomas who raised an objection during the Master’s discourse before the Last Supper: “Thomas said to Him: Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way?” (John 15:5.) St. Thomas is especially remembered for his incredulity when the other Apostles told him of Christ’s appearance to them after His Resurrection: “Except I shall see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into His side, I will not believe”. (John 20:25.)\n\nSt. Thomas’ Doubts\n\nEight days later when he was invited by the Savior to inspect for himself the marks of the Five Wounds in the Body of Jesus it the opinion of the Fathers of the Church that St. Thomas rendered invaluable service to Christianity. Kneeling, he cried, “My Lord and my God”. Jesus kindly rebuked him, saying: “Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed”. (John 20:29.)\n\nAfter the Ascension, St. Thomas went forth into the world to preach the Gospel of Christ Jesus to the Parthians, Medes, Persians, and the inhabitants of other provinces of Persia, close to the Caspian sea. Finally, he entered India, where he instructed the people in the Christian religion. In the end, his life and teaching and the greatness of his numerous miracles, which won the hearts of the people, caused violent anger amongst the priests of the idols. In consequence, St. Thomas was condemned to death and pierced with arrows, thus meriting the crown of the apostolate and of martyrdom at Calamina.\n\nSpreading the Good News through Architecture and Building\n\nThrough this example of service to others and the miracles performed in the name of Jesus, the family of the King and the Court of Gondophernes converted to Christianity. They realized that St. Thomas not only built a beautiful palace for them in India, but more importantly was designing and building a beautiful heavenly dwelling through the salvation of God. This is why St. Thomas is the patron saint of architects and builders.
