        "text": "William Douglas Warde, 67, died on Aug. 3, 2010. His funeral service will be 1 p.m. Monday, Aug. 9, 2010, at University Heights Baptist Church in Stillwater. Strode Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements. Bill Warde contributed to the lives of many people. Bill was born Feb. 9, 1943, in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada, the son of William Graham Warde, Royal Air Force, and Joan Agnes Anne Warde, from Royal Oak, Mich. At the end of World War II, the family settled in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England except for a period at Changi Air Base near Singapore in the 1950s. He attended the Royal Grammar School – the equivalent of Eton or Harrow – in High Wycombe and graduated from Sir John Cass College, University of London. While there, he was a Royal Air Force cadet. He qualified as a pilot twice, at age 16 and as a cadet. After receiving a bachelor’s degree in statistics and geography in 1965, he earned a master’s degree in statistics at Florida State University. He and Mary Jane Williams were married in 1968 and moved on to Iowa State University, where he earned his doctorate in applied statistics in 1972. Bill was a statistics professor at Oklahoma State University for 42 years. He loved teaching and consulting with researchers from many disciplines. He believed strongly in encouraging young scholars and was always willing to judge the state science fairs and the Cherokee Nation Science Fair. Through a NASA grant, he ran a summer camp for American Indian junior high science students in the 1990s and often assisted other OSU summer programs for young scholars. In addition to being head of the Statistics Department for five years, he was Chair of Faculty Council and president of the OSU chapter of the Phi Kappa Phi National Honor Society. He enjoyed working with the American Indian students at OSU. He was currently serving as chapter adviser to the American Indian Science and Engineering Society and was a Sequoyah Fellow in the national organization. On campus, the Native American Faculty and Staff organization and the American Indian Student Association honored him by including him in their board meetings and activities. His only extended absence from the OSU campus was a fellowship at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. in 1985-1986. Outside his academic life, Bill was a board member of the University and Community Federal Credit Union for about 30 years, a founding member of Stillwater’s Centennial Rotary Club, and a Paul Harris Fellow. He attended, supported and loved the Perkins Church of Christ in Perkins, Okla. Although he was Canadian by birth, he thought of himself as British until October 2009 when he became an American citizen. Other than his family, his passion for 59 years was Boy Scouting. He became a Cub Scout in Singapore the first day he was old enough and rose to Queen’s Scout – the equivalent of an American Eagle Scout. As a young adult he earned his Wood Badge at Gilwell Park, England. In Stillwater he served as Scout Master of Troop 818, United Methodist Church; Assistant Scout Master of Troop 828, University Heights Baptist Church; and with Cub Scout packs at Sangre Ridge Elementary School and Highland Park Elementary School. He trained twice at Philmont Scout Reservation, taught leadership courses and Wood Badge, ran Cub day camps – whatever needed doing. He camped often at Will Rogers Scout Reservation near Cleveland, Okla., and taught merit badge classes for campers. He was awarded the Vigil (highest) rank of the Order of the Arrow. At the same time, he took leadership positions in Will Rogers Council, now Cimarron Council, and had been Council Commissioner for several years at the time of his death. He participated in the Ouachita Trek every spring break for some 30 years and served stints as the local “Pop Corn Colonel.” He earned almost every award given in Scouting, including the Silver Beaver, the highest award given at the council level. He attended every National Boy Scout Jamboree from 1977 to 2010 as a Scout master or, most recently, as a volunteer fork lift operator in the Food Service Group. Bill was a loving husband to Mary Jane Warde for 41 years, a loving father to Colin W. Warde and Mark Christopher Warde of Stillwater, and a delighted grandfather to Luca Benjamin Warde of Tulsa. We will miss him too much to say. His family respectfully suggests that in lieu of flowers those who wish may make donations in his name to the Cimarron Council BSA, 317 North Grand, Enid, OK 73701.
