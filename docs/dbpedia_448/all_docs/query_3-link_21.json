        "text": "We know care homes aren’t usually known for being trendy spots and certainly wouldn’t be a place you’d imagine celebrities frequenting.\n\nSo, what if we told you that some of the UK’s care facilities have been home to some of the most famous elderly celebrities, actors and actresses to ever walk the stage! Don’t believe us?\n\nRead on to learn more about the glitz and glamour hiding behind the doors of these UK care homes and discover the (retirement) lifestyles of the rich and famous.\n\nKickstart your care search\n\nDiscover the best care homes in your area through Lottie.\n\nFind your nearest care home\n\nDenville Hall\n\nLocated in Northwood in the London Borough of Hillingdon, to the untrained eye, Denville Hall is a normal historic building just like its neighbours. However, Denville Hall care home is actually used as a retirement home for professional actors, actresses and members of the theatrical professions who left life on the stage to tread boards of a different kind.\n\nOffering residential, nursing, dementia, and respite care services, Denville Hall has had many famous actors and actresses through its doors. Though actors and actresses have priority at Denville Hall, the home is available to other people in the entertainment industry, including agents, dancers and even circus performers!\n\nAt Denville Hall, residents can stay on a long-term or short-term basis, with physiotherapy care services also being provided.\n\nDenville Hall Ambassadors\n\nDenville Hall has a number of ambassadors, all of who are associated with the entertainment industry. Along with trustees and committee members, these ambassadors are passionate about Denville Hall’s unique mission.\n\nHere are the Denville Hall Ambassadors (you might recognise one or two names in this list):\n\nSir Simon Russell Beale (President)\n\nCharles Dance OBE\n\nSir Richard Eyre\n\nMichael Frayn\n\nSir Ian McKellen\n\nSir Patrick Stewart\n\nDavid Suchet CBE\n\nLord Winston\n\nHelen Worth\n\nFamous Residents of Denville Hall\n\nAmong the most famed were English actor and filmmaker Richard Attenborough, brother to the world-famous Sir David Attenborough, actress Kathleen Byron, and actor and writer Andrew Sachs of Fawlty Towers fame.\n\nThe following were all also residents:\n\nNicholas Amer\n\nGabrielle Blunt\n\nMargot Boyd\n\nNan Braunton\n\nAlan Brien\n\nTony Britton\n\nDouglas Byng\n\nPatsy Byrne\n\nPeter Byrne\n\nBrian Cant\n\nPat Coombs\n\nBrenda Cowling\n\nPeter Hall\n\nMargaret Harris\n\nRobert Hardy\n\nDoris Hare\n\nRose Hill\n\nJohn Horsley\n\nGeoffrey Keen\n\nJo Kendall\n\nAnnette Kerr\n\nElspeth March\n\nBetty Marsden\n\nFrank Middlemass\n\nJeanne Mockford\n\nPeggy Mount\n\nDaphne Oxenford\n\nMuriel Pavlow\n\nRichard Pearson\n\nArnold Ridley\n\nBrian Rix\n\nPaul Rogers\n\nClifford Rose\n\nPeter Sallis\n\nAnthony Steel\n\nRonnie Stevens\n\nMalcolm Terris\n\nJohn Woodnutt\n\nEdgar Wreford\n\nTell me more about Denville Hall.\n\nWe’re here to help you find the right care home for you or your loved one. You can request a free list of care homes from our care experts, who will then share homes matching your budget, location and type of care needed. You can also search for a care home through our easy-to-use directory.\n\nUnknown Care Home\n\nOur next celebrity is legendary actress June Whitfield, who became a household name thanks to the popularity of TV series Terry and June, as well as her role as Edina’s mum in the popular series Absolutely Fabulous. She was even awarded a lifetime achievement award and made a Dame in 2017 for her services to drama and entertainment.\n\nFollowing the death of her husband, Juned moved into a care home after living alone in her big house became too much. So, which care home was June Whitfield in? It appears the exact location is unknown, but there’s one thing we do know – apparently June loved life in a care home, and who can blame her? With 24-7 care, activities and socialising with friends, what’s not to love! June sadly passed away in 2018, but her name and legacy will live on forever.\n\nBrinsworth House\n\nAnother care home bursting with celebrity residents is Brinsworth House, which is situated in Twickenham, in West London. To reflect the star quality of its famous residents, Brinsworth House, which was nicknamed ‘the Old Pro’s Paradise’, decorated the building with posters of Royal Variety Performances and even installed an entertainment stage so that its resident stars could carry on singing and dancing even in their retirement.\n\nFamous residents who took their final curtain calls here include Penny Calvert, a dancer and first wife of Sir Bruce Forsyth, entertainment duo Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson, who represented the UK at Eurovision in 1959 and Sir Norman Wisdom, an English actor, comedian, and singer-songwriter best known for his series of comedy films in the 50s and 60s. Other notable names include Australian-born British DJ and much-loved radio personality Alan ‘Fluff’ Freeman and English comedian, actor, writer and singer Charlie Drake, who sadly passed away in 2006.\n\nBrinsworth House is funded by the Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund and regular events are held at top venues like the London Palladium to raise further funding. Celebrities can help out by sponsoring bedrooms and at the home you’ll find such star-studded rooms as the Barbara Windsor room, the Gloria Hunniford room and the Sir Michael Parkinson room! Care home costs might not be quite the same as payment for a blockbuster movie, but every little helps.\n\nTell me more about Brinsworth House.\n\nRoyal Star and Garter\n\nA slightly different type of care home, the Royal Star and Garter, was built in the 1920s as a hospital to provide accommodation and nursing care for injured servicemen in World War I. The home was initially situated on Richmond Hill in Richmond, London – although all you’ll find there now is apartment blocks.\n\nIn time, the Royal Star and Garter care home housed several decorated war veterans and heroes, including Frederick Jeremiah Edwards, recipient of the Victoria Cross, who died at the home in 1964, Norman ‘Bill’ Jewell, who was commander of the HMS Seraph submarine during war operations, and Nancy Wake, who fought with the French Resistance and lived in the home from 2003 until she passed away in 2011.\n\nOver the years, the charitable trust behind this care home, the Royal Star and Garter Homes, opened other new homes in Solihull in the West Midlands, High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire and in Surbiton, where residents of the Richmond home moved in 2013.\n\nWe may think that when we retire, we are approaching the end of our lives. However, these inspirational people found freedom in retirement and lived each day to the full, continuing to sing, dance and pay homage to the entertainment industry. It just goes to show, your final act doesn’t have to be any less exciting than your first – and when it comes to taking your last curtain call, you can take your bows with no regrets.\n\nTell me more about Royal Star & Garter.\n\nOur Care Homes Near Denville Hall\n\nHere are some of the care homes we list that can be found near to Denville Hall.
