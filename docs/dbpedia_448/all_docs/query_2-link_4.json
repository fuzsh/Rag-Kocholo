        "text": "History of St Thomas History\n\nAlthough the history of St. Thomas is a subject of much debate, it is known that he traveled to India in 52 A.D. Also, no one knows when or how exactly he arrived in India, but he went on to establish seven churches in Kerala. He died 20 years after he arrived in the country at age 72.\n\nSome historians say that St. Thomas first went to Persia (present-day Iran) and then to South India by sea with a Jewish merchant named Habban. Other writers claim that he traveled by land through Afghanistan and Baluchistan, now part of Pakistan, and then arrived in India via Gujarat.\n\nThe Feast of Saint Thomas was inserted into the Roman calendar in the ninth Century on December 21. The Martyrology of St. Jerome, a calendar recording the feast days of saints, mentioned the apostle on July 3, the date the Roman celebration transferred it to in 1969. This was so that the day would no longer clash with the days of Advent. Traditionalist Roman Catholics and many Anglicans still celebrate his feast day on December 21."
