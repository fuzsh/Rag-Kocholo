He lead the establishment of the NHS, meaning without him who knows where we would be today? Thanks Aneurin!\n\nBeaconsfield - Sir Terry Pratchett\n\nSir Terry was born in the Bucks town, and went on to sell over 85 million books, and is one of Britain’s best selling authors, as well as my grandad's favourite."
