This couple went on to live at Weston-on-the-Green, Oxfordshire, and became fairly prosperous farmers. This line continued through Kidlington, Yarnton, Chipping Norton, and there are descendants today at Ducklington. Has anyone been able to connect this William into the Shalston family?\n\nFrom Heather Olsen There was a William Strange baptized in Shalstone in the 1710-15 timeframe the son of John and Mary Strange. This John and Mary had several other children baptized in Shalstone in this time period. I am not certain, however, that this William and the one married in Buckingham are one and the same. There seems to have been at least one other William who remained in Shalstone in the 1740s and 1750s.\n\nGo to the Shalstone page, Buckinghamshire, for details of a family with connections here and in villages across Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire\n\nThe Universal British Directory of Trade Commerce & Manufacture. 1793-1798\n\nJohn STRANGE Laceman\n\nChepping Wycombe\n\nSource unconfirmed\n\nMarriage:\n\n1825 Sep 14 Martha Strange d William Strange and Mary\n\nColnbrook\n\nFrom John Moore\n\nBaptisms:\n\n1856 Jul 20 Fanny Strange d John Strange and Ann\n\n1858 Nov 21 John Strange s John Strange and Ann\n\n1864 Sep 18 James Frederick Strange s John Strange and Anne\n\n1864 Sep 18 Mary Jane Strange d John Strange and Anne\n\n1866 Nov 23 Emily Strange d John Strange and Anne\n\n1869 Nov 12 Sam Strange s John Strange and Anne\n\n1874 Jan 16 Emily Strange d John Strange and Ann\n\nDatchet\n\n(C 1559-1900, M 1559-1900, B 1559-1861)\n\nBaptism:\n\n1894 Jul 15 Sidney Strange, son Harry George & Hannah, carter\n\nDenham\n\nFrom John Moore\n\nMarriage:\n\n1803 Oct 12 Joseph Strange to Ann Coles\n\nEdlesborough St Mary the Virgin\n\nFrom John Moore\n\nMarriage:\n\n1809 Nov 09 John Strange to Mary Wilkinson\n\n1810 Nov 19 Mary Strange to John Reeve\n\n1819 Feb 11 Alley Strange to William Janes\n\nNational Burial Index\n\n1826 Aug 27 Thomas STRANGE 62\n\n1835 Apr 29 Anne STRANGE 76\n\nEton St John the Evangelis\n\nFrom John Moore\n\nBaptism:\n\n1855 Apr 04 Alice Sarah Strange d Thomas Strange and Sarah\n\nMarriage:\n\n1853 Sep 04 James Strange to Mary Ann Rogers\n\nNational Burial Index:\n\n1826 Jan 22 Ruth Strange age 40\n\nFulmer\n\nFrom John Moore\n\nMarriage:\n\n1837 Feb 05 William Strange to Sarah Chapman\n\nGreat Marlow - All Saints with Holy Trinity\n\nFrom Ed Hanson\n\n(C 1758-1812; M 1592-1837; B 1799-1812)\n\n1796 Jul 13 William Smith & Ann Strange, m by banns, wits: Mary Higgs, William Frewin\n\n1811 Feb 21 John Bateman & Elizabeth Strange, m by banns wits: Thomas Gray, Wildsmith Badger\n\n1813 Dec 26 George Strange & Mary Ann Willis, m by banns wits: Ann Jemima Priestly, Sarah Conley, Wildsmith Badger\n\n1815 Nov 20 William Carr & Ann Strange, m by banns wits: Thomas Smith, Wildsmith Badger\n\n1817 May 28 Eliab Strange & Hannah Plummer, m by banns wits: Ann West, Daniel Powell, Wildsmith Badger\n\n1830 Oct 23 Daniel Strange of Turville Heath & Mary Ann Pitcher of Fingest, m by license, wit: Henry Badger\n\n1835 Nov 02 Edward Brown & Ellen Maria Strange, m by banns wits: Richard Brown, Priscilla Mainston, Wm Hasey\n\nNational Burial Index:\n\n1834 Jun 01 George STRANGE 44\n\nHambledon\n\nFrom John Moore moorejo@reach.net\n\nI recently visited England and talked with the present lockkeeper.\n\nSubject: Hambledon Lock The following are extracts from The Thames Highway, vol. 2, 1920, by Fred S Thacker, published by David and Charles, Newton Abbot. Vol. 1, 1914, was republished with a new introduction in 1968. Access was provided in March 2003 by the current lockkeeper. \"In 1854, Joseph Gould, after 32 years' service, was deprived of his monthly wage of 50s; and was allowed the pleasure tolls and free use of the lockhouse, on condition of continuing his duties. At the end of the following year he received Â£10 compensation for property left by him in the house; perhaps it helped to pay his passage to New Zealand.\n\n\"The lock was in 1865 in imminent danger of collapse\n\n\"No keeper is named after Gould's departure until Widow Sarah Strainge at 52s. monthly under the Conservancy in 1866. In November she received notice from the adjacent landowner to quit her house, but was protected by the Conservancy, the actual owners.\n\n\"In June 1868 Mrs. Strainge was ordered to Mapledurham; and in May 1870 I find J Lomax keeping. The lock was entirely rebuilt this year. Lomax died before March 1873; and Mrs. Lomax retained his office with official assistance. I have a shrewd suspicion that Mrs. Lomax is identical with the widow Strainge: the latter never turned up at Mapledurham. In May 1876 it was urged that the extensive weirs needed a man to manage them; and it was suggesed to send Mrs. Lomax to Shiplake; but the Conservators declined to move her. She had two grown sons to help her; \"she was quite competent, she had done it when her husband was ill, and we kept her.\" The breakwater below the lock was built in June 1878. Next year complaints arose about the handling of the weir, and Chalmore Hole was suggested for the widow. Headquarters, however, entertained an inexplicable penchant for the lady; some more comfortable change was desired. In July 1881 she was still here; but constant complaint at last had its effect; and in September 1882 she was dismissed with three months' wages.\"\n\nThe lock fee in 1695 was 1/-; in 1771 3d per 5 tons of cargo; in 1821 9s 01/2d for 140 tons, with 3d per 5 tons proposed. The owner in 1846 was CS Murray, who charged 3d per 5 tons.\n\nI followed this up with a message to the lockkeeper, including the following: Regarding the widow Strainge: 1. Here is what we knew about Thomas Strange and his wife before you so kindly showed us your book, The Thames Highway: Thomas Strange. Christened 21 Dec 1794, Turville. Lived at Medmenham, at least from 1816, when he married Mary at Ibstone 22 Feb. Occupations: Master shoemaker, employing 1 man and 2 women, Mar 1851; pound-lock keeper at time of death. Drowned at Mill End, Hambleden, Bucks, 8 Jan 1856; buried at Medmenham, 14 Jan 1856. The Bucks Advertiser of 19 January 1856 reported as follows:-\n\n\"An inquest was held at Mill End, Hambledon, near this town, on the 11th instant, before F. Charsley Esq., on the body of Thomas Strange, who had only been poundkeeper at the lock on the river Thames, opposite Mill End, for three weeks. The deceased, who was 60 years of age, in crossing the river from the Poundhouse to Mill End, to fetch his son-in-law, on the previous Tuesday evening, lost the command of the boat, owing, it is supposed, to the rapidity of the stream, and the boat was drawn over the lock and upset. The body of the deceased was not found until the following day, although search was made by several men with punts and lanterns. Verdict: 'Accidentally drowned.'\" [I think it should have said 'over the weir'.]\n\nMary Strange, nÃ©e Robinson. Born 1794-6, Ibstone. Occupation: Shoe binder. Died 26 Sep 1854 of 'rheumatism' and old age and buried at Medmenham, 30 Sep 1854.\n\nDiscounting the possibility that the likeness of surnames is just a coincidence, this shows that either Thomas remarried between September 1854 and January 1856, or Sarah was not his widow. I have checked a partial listing of marriages for the period, and found two possibles in the last quarter of 1854 - a bit on the hasty side, especially as he had no children at home needing care. Of course, either one of them could have been his son, Thomas's.\n\n2. On the question of whether Sarah Strainge and Mrs Lomax were one and the same, as Fred Thacker suspected: The 1861 census shows Sarah Strange, a widow aged 46 and born in Henley, as pound-keeper, living at the pound with a young woman companion. In 1871, there is a Sarah Strange, a widow aged 56 and born in Henley, unemployed and visiting in the household of a Samuel Lambourn, a pleasure boat proprietor living on the Henley Turnpike Road, Henley Bridge Foot, Remenham. In 1881 Sarah Strange, a pensioned widow aged 65 and born in Henley, is boarding in Aston Lane, Remenham with a family headed by Eliza Lambourne, another widow. Also in 1881 the Hambledon lock house was occupied as lock keeper by Martha Lomax, a widow aged 49 and born in Bray, and her four children, including two boys aged 16 and 18. Given her age, there may well have been older boys who had left home. Clearly, Thacker's suspicion was unfounded.\n\n3. So what relation were Thomas and Sarah, if she was not his widow? Since she was born 1814-1816, it seems unlikely that she was his sister-in-law: his brothers were born in 1793 and 1800. For the same reason, it is possible, although it would be a bit unusual, that she was his daughter-in-law: his eldest son's wife was Elizabeth, and his other three were born in 1818, 1821 and 1823. Possible marriages were registered for all three to women named Sarah. Since it would cost rather a lot to get the five marriage certificates concerned, I think I'll pass on this one! There could, of course, be more than five possibles, as the listing I looked at is incomplete.

I believe Eddie was 16 when she married Henry, they and their 2 daughters emigrated to Australia around 1920 on board the Orient Steam Navigation Company ship RMS Orsova. I am unaware of any other relatives emigrating at this time and my Nana, Marjorie, often refers to all her cousins being in England except the one that moved to USA (Missouri?) to be with her daughter that married an American.\n\nVictorian Prisoners in Buckinghamshire Aylesbury Gaol in the 19th Century - just one STRANGE:\n\nRalph Strange, Age: 18 , Place of Birth: High Wycombe, Place of Residence: High Wycombe Occupation: Chairmaker\n\nDate Received Into Gaol: 16 November 1877, Crime: Poaching, Sentence: 21 days\n\nHoggeston\n\n(C1547-1813, M1547-1813, B1547-1813)\n\nNone by the name of Strainge/Strange\n\nHughenden\n\nFrom John Moore\n\nMarriages:\n\n1708 Mar 12 Thomas Strange of Beconsfield to Elizabeth Puttenham of Amersham lic\n\n1862 Mar 22 Mary Annie Strange to Sidney Smith\n\nIbstone\n\nIbstone was in Oxfordshire OXF / BKM 1837-1896 Wycombe\n\nBKM 1896- Wycombe\n\nFrom John Moore\n\nMarriage:\n\n1816 Feb 22 Thomas Strange to Mary Robinson, He of Medmenham.
