        "text": "THE THOMAS GASCOIGNE BURSARY\n\nThomas Gascoigne was born in Buckinghamshire in 1917. He is reputed to have become the organist at Bow Brickhill Church at the age of twelve. In due course, he became a student of composition under Dr Eric Thiman at Trinity College, London. Having acquired FRCO LRAM and LTCL, he became a teacher in the Slough and High Wycombe localities and was for some time teaching music at Oakdene School, Beaconsfield. In 1950, he was appointed Organist at St. Mary’s Beaconsfield, a post which he held for forty-four years, retiring in 1994 due to declining health.A founder member of the Buckinghamshire Organists’ Association, he served on the committee from 1963 and was elected Chairman 1984-1987. His outstanding service was recognised in 1991 by being made an honorary member of the association.Sadly, Tom passed away in February 1997. In remembrance of his significant contribution, the Buckinghamshire Organists’ Association agreed to establish a bursary of £100.00 per annum, to support organ students, when and wherever considered appropriate.Beneficiaries to date have been:\n\n1997 Charles Wooller\n\n2000 Daveth Clark\n\n2001 Peter Yardley Jones\n\n2007 Katrina Faranda Bellofiglio\n\n2008 Katrina Faranda Bellofiglio\n\n2009 Katrina Faranda Bellofiglio\n\n2010 Alexandria Dickenson-Lomas and William Parker\n\n2017 Jonathan Davis\n\n2023 Clöe McBarnett"
