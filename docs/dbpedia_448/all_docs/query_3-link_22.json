        "text": "It is well documented that Dorset is home to plenty of celebrities, and there are some areas in the county that has greater associations with the famous faces than others.\n\nFrom the charming town of Bridport to the scenic market town of Sherborne, people from the county have a huge amount of celebrities that they can choose from to earn their claim to fame. Whether they are past alumni or have set up homes in the area, there are plenty of celebrities with connections to Dorset.\n\nNone more so than Bournemouth, which is home to award-winning actors, popstars and more. The scenic coastal town, which attracts tourists from far and wide every year for its stunning beaches, has lots of famous faces from the area.\n\nRead more: The Dorset town home to some of the biggest celebrities\n\nThe town is home to Bournemouth School which has an array of famous alumni who have become famous around the world. Take a look at our list of notable people from this scenic Dorset coastal town.\n\nChristian Bale\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor, who won best supporting 2010's The Fighter, used to attend Bournemouth School. Some have reported that he was bullied at school before leaving Bournemouth aged 16.\n\nDespite this, he has gone on to star in three extremely successful Batman films and has built a reputation for his extreme commitment to roles. From losing and gaining weight for roles as diverse as the villainous lead in American Psycho, to an uncanny Dick Cheney impression in Vice, about George W Bush's vice president.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown\n\nAnother renowned actor from the area includes Millie Bobby Brown, which saw the young star rise to fame at a young age for her role as Eleven in Netflix's hit show Stranger Things. The 18-year-old actress spent some of her youth in Winton, Bournemouth where lived from the age of four until aged eight before making the move to Orlando, Florida in the United States.\n\nThough her time in Bournemouth was short lived, the area seems to have made quite the impact on her. In 2020, the teenage actress donated £5,000 to Bournemouth Hospital Charity as a way of showing her gratitude to the countless NHS workers who worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. She also donated £5,000 each to Salisbury District Hospital Stars Appeal and Southampton Hospitals Charity to support frontline NHS staff.\n\nRead more about her story HERE.\n\nMark Austin\n\nMark Austin will be a familiar face to anyone who has tuned into some of his ground-breaking news reports over the years. He is a former alumni of Bournemouth School and started his journalistic career at the Bournemouth Echo following his studies.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for being ITV's chief newscaster after taking over from presenter Trevor McDonald. The 1990s saw him cover historic event after historic event - from the first Gulf War, to the handover of Hong Kong and the war in Kosovo. In 2003 he returned to Iraq, covering the war which ousted Saddam Hussein. In 2016, he left ITV to work for Sky.\n\nIn 2008, Austin received an honorary doctorate from Bournemouth University, back in the town where it all began for him.\n\nCharles Gray\n\nOur next Bournemouth School graduate is another actor, Charles Gray. Born in Bournemouth, Gray rose up the ranks of his profession to play some of the most famous characters around.\n\nHe appeared in two James Bond films - You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever - but it was in the latter that he took on Sean Connery's 007 as his nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. He also played Sherlock's brother, Mycroft, in The Adventures of Sherlock Homes.\n\nHe apparently kept pictures of famous actors while growing up in Bournemouth - so dreams can come true, kids! Gray died aged 71 in the year 2000.\n\nBenny Hill\n\nBorn Alfred Hawthorne Hill, but forever known as Benny, the comedian is known for his saucy and, by modern standards, perhaps dated gags. He only ended up at school in Bournemouth when young Alfie was evacuated to Dorset from his hometown of Southampton in the war, where his Taunton's school shared a site with Bournemouth School.\n\nOne biography of Benny Hill reckons the comic hated his time in Bournemouth as a youngster. He found it a \"tiresome bore\", apparently.\n\nHe was apparently desperate to leave school as soon as he could, so did little work but did manage to have some fun along the way. As a comedian and actor, he won fans around the world - including Michael Jackson.\n\nFilm appearances included The Italian Job and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but it was The Benny Hill Show on TV where he become a British comedy legend. He died in 1992 and is buried in his native Southampton.\n\nGareth Malone OBE\n\nGareth Malone is another star shaped by his education at Bournemouth School. An unlikely celebrity, he is best known for his TV programmes about choir singing, spreading the hobby to the wider public.\n\nIn early life he sang with the symphony chorus of Bournemouth's Symphony Orchestra, one of the town's finest exports. In 2020's lockdown he kept spirits up by encouraging singing at home via the Great British Home Chorus. He also seems like a lovely and enthusiastic singing teacher - we'd take him over Simon Cowell any day.\n\nAlex James\n\nFamous cheesemaker Alex James was born in Boscombe and like the household names above, went to state grammar Bournemouth School. He did have a noteworthy life before he turned to cheese - he was the bassist in Blur, the only 1990s band to rival Oasis (or not, depending on your view).\n\nHe credits The Beatles with inspiring his music career. After Blur he moved to the Cotswolds, where his love affair with cheese began.\n\nSophie Rundle\n\nThe 33-year-old actress was born in High Wycombe, Buckingham before making her move to Bournemouth with her family in her adolescence. It was here that she attended Bournemouth School for Girls (BSG), which is rated 'Outstanding' by Ofsted.\n\nThe actress has since gone on to appear in award-winning shows and became a regular on our screens after appearing on the BBC's Peaky Blinders and in Gentleman Jack. Developing a keen interest in acting, Alistair Brien, headteacher at BSG, says the teachers saw Sophie's acting potential as a student.\n\nMr Brien told DorsetLive: \"Even as a student at BSG Sophie demonstrated great promise as an actor and was a stalwart of school productions. It was a delight in 2020 to be able to invite her to address the school community at our annual Founders' Day celebrations, albeit online. What struck me then was her clear star quality and the sheer range of her skills, from acting to directing which she has clearly put to good effect in her recent productions.\"\n\nJames McVey\n\nGuitarist and vocalists from The Vamps, James McVey grew up in Bournemouth and studied at Corfe Hills School in Broadstone, which he recently returned to the area to give a speech. The I'm a Celebrity contestant, who appeared on the show at the same time as former AFC Bournemouth manager Harry Redknapp.\n\nIt seems McVey's links to Dorset remain strong as he often posts his time in the area via social media. He also married girlfriend Kirstie Brittain on October 30, 2021 at the prestigious Lulworth Castle.\n\nAndy Summers\n\nSticking to musicians, notable guitarist Andy Summers from The Police had an upbringing in Bournemouth. Born in 1942 in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, his family then moved to the coastal town where he spent some of his childhood.\n\nHe joined The Police in 1977, eventually replacing original guitarist Henry Padovani. The band were known for emerging from London's punk scene, and gained international recognition with many hit songs, including \"Message in a Bottle\", \"Roxanne\", \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\", \"Every Breath You Take\", and \"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\".\n\nBen Hardy\n\nThe 31-year-old actor was born in Bournemouth, but grew up in Sherborne. He attended Sherborne Abbey Primary School and the Gryphon School. It was here that he developed a love for acting after he starred as Sergeant Francis Troy in a school film adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd.\n\nHardy is known for playing Peter Beale in the BBC soap opera EastEnders between 2013 and 2015. He made his film debut as Archangel in the superhero film X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). In 2018, he played Roger Taylor in the biographical film Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nMatt Johnson\n\nHe is a British keyboardist known for playing the funk and jazz band Jamiroquai. He joined the band on May 2, 2002 to replace the founding member Toby Smith. It is said that he has links to Bournemouth, though it is not known how long he lived in the area.\n\nRuss Spencer\n\nThe singer best known for being a member of pop group Scooch who represented the UK in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Russ co-wrote the song \"Flying the Flag (For You)\" which received only 19 votes. That year, the UK came joint 22nd out of 24 entries. The 42-year-old was born in Bournemouth on 1 March 1980.\n\nBob Brunning\n\nRobert 'Bob' Brunning was a musician and the original bass guitar player with the blues rock band Fleetwood Mac. He decided to form the group naming it Fleetwood Mac after the rhythm section he wanted for the band – Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.\n\nThe bass guitarist was born in Bournemouth, but sadly died from a heart attack at aged 68 on October 18, 2011 in London.\n\nGot a story to share or an issue for us to investigate?
