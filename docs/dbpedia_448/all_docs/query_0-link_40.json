        "text": "Infants 0-9 months\n\nOur Infant classes offer an insight into baby development to increase your confidence and understanding of your growing baby. All our fun activities are suitable from birth with the exercises progressing as your baby grows.\n\nToddlers 9-18 months\n\nFor your older more active baby who is now fascinated with the world around them we introduce additional learning themes and practice new skills. Activities promote language and social skills and body awareness.\n\nJuniors 18 months – 3 years+\n\nOur special fun Junior programme is perfect for older toddlers who are even more active. We love encouraging their confidence in their physical and social skills and in supporting increased independence with fun and stimulating games. They don’t even realise how much they are learning at the same time.\n\nBaby Massage 0-6 months\n\nWe teach a full body baby massage sequence in 4 practical sessions including songs and movements to safely practise and enjoy with your baby at home. Classes include discussion topics to support you and your new baby, relaxation and stretches for parents and informative handouts. Oil and refreshments are provided at our warm, private venues.\n\nBaby College at Home Online Classes\n\nYou can book online classes through Baby College South Buckinghamshire\n\nHi. My name is Vicky and I run Baby College classes in South Buckinghamshire. I also have a lovely teacher, Karlie, who helps me run some baby and toddler classes in Hazlemere meaning that we can bring our amazing Baby College classes to even more families across South Bucks.\n\nBaby College was one of my favourite times of the week with my daughter. We started when she was 6 weeks old. I met great people, learnt some fabulous things and it gave us some quality time together to bond and nurture our growing relationship.\n\nNearly 7 years on, the opportunity to become part of the Baby College family arose and I leapt at the chance. I was running my own marketing business, which just wasn’t working with the needs of a school age family. Baby College not only offers me the flexibility I need as a working mum, but it allows me to bring the parent and child class I loved to South Buckinghamshire. Baby College made me feel supported as a parent, provided me with some really useful developmental insights and, most importantly, taught me a host of fun games and activities to play with my growing baby and toddler.\n\nBaby College includes singing, signing, dancing and activities that you can try at home, reassured by the knowledge that they are not only entertaining your child, but they are helping them to meet key developmental milestones.\n\nI hope you and your child will come along and join my baby and toddler classes for lots of Baby College fun.\n\nHey! My name is Karlie and I am joining the Baby College team to teach baby and toddler classes in Hazlemere.\n\nI was on the hunt for a baby class near me after having my little girl. One of the local mums recommended Baby College to me and I haven’t looked back. We attended the class for a trial and straight after joined as a monthly rolling member due to falling in love with it. I come out of the class learning something new about babies every week whether it be about milestones, the vestibular, language development, reflexes; the list is endless.\n\nWhen you walk out of that hospital door with your newborn baby unfortunately there is no manual telling you what to do next and it can feel a little daunting. I found this class gives you confidence in many ways and lots of different fun ideas and activities to help with your baby’s development going forwards.\n\nI have been very lucky to have the opportunity to become part of the Baby College family and I look forward to sharing this journey with you all. Come and join me for my baby and toddler classes in Hazlemere."
