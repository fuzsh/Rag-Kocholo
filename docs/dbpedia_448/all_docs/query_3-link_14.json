        "text": "A beautiful UK riverside town is hiding a star-studded secret as as well as its beautiful high street and views across the river, it is also home to a number of celebrities.\n\nThe quaint town is littered with sports stars, top musicians and TV chefs.\n\nThey all enjoy the Buckinghamshire town’s beautiful Thames river walks and famous local brewery. Among its other attractions includes a bridge which was the inspiration for a now far more famous one in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nLocated just outside London, the little town of Marlow is close to Maidenhead and High Wycombe and has a history of being very posh.\n\nIts main sport is rowing, and the local Marlow Rowing Club produced many Olympic oarsmen including Sir Steve Redgrave. Meanwhile a gold-winning Brit in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Zac Purchase, also learnt his trade with the club.\n\nSuch is its affluence that it is home to two regattas. The first, Marlow Town Regatta, took place originally in 1855 and still continues every year in June, while the second - Marlow International Regatta - now takes place on Eton College’s purpose-built Dorney Lake. Nevertheless, the Henley Regatta, in neighbouring Henley-on-Thames, is more well-known.\n\nThe town is home to two strong schools - Great Marlow School and Sir William Borlase’s Grammar School - as well as the first ever gastropub to hold two Michelin stars, Tom Kerridge’s The Hand and Flowers. The Wiltshire-born cook also owns two other eateries in the town, Travelodge reports, meaning foodies flock in from all over the country.\n\nFamous TV chef Kerridge is one of the many famous people who enjoy walking over Marlow’s beautiful suspension bridge which has been standing since the reign of King Edward III in 1835. It was the prototype for and is twinned with a much bigger and more famous one across the Danube in Budapest - the Szechenyi Chain Bridge.\n\nMarlow counts itself as home to both the meat alternative company, Quorn, which was founded in the town in 1967, as well as a whole raft of famous celebrities.\n\nAmong these names include the literary masters T.S. Eliot and Mary Shelley, rower Steve Redgrave, famous chefs Heston Blumenthal and Tom Kerridge.\n\nTV star Chris Evans, known for Top Gear and previously hosting breakfast radio on BBC Radio Two, also lives in Marlow, as well as The Office star Ricky Gervais. Sports stars are not short in supply either - former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss reportedly resides there, as does Paralympic gold medallist Naomi Riches."
