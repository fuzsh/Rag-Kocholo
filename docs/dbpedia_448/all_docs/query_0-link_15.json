Hamilton, manuscript appeared in 'Indian Atrocities Along the Clinch, Powell and Holston Rivers,' pp. 52-3, based on letter written by Samuel Alley, Metamora, IN, to Dr. Lyman C. Draper, dated April 28, 1884:\n\n\" 'My father's sister, Fanny Napper and her five children were killed and scalped by Indians near Fort Blackmore. I was born in a few yards of the fort in 1801, and have just returned from a visit to my old birthplace. The ground where the fort stood was being cultivated. A large apple tree stands near the fort that my father set out. It is to this called the 'John Alley Apple Tree.'\n\n\"My aunt and family were killed, I think, in 1777. My father was born at Petersburg, VA, in 1760, and settled on Clinch [River] when a young boy. Died on Piper Creek, Franklin Co., IN, in 1842, where I now live, aged 82 years.'\n\n\"Fanny Napper was a daughter of James Alley, Sr., who along with his brother Thomas Alley, Sr., were very early settlers on the Clinch River in the present Scott Co., VA. The writer has been unable to discover in the area any details of just how she and her five children were slain, but in the Shane Historical Collection (2) of the Draper Manuscripts is an interview with Jessee Graddy who tells of his trip from Virginia to Kentucky with his arrival at the Crab Orchard in Lincoln Co., KY, September 3, 1777. If Graddy is telling of the killing of Fanny Napper, which he undoubtedly is, although he mentions no names, then she and her children must have been slain in July or August of 1777, Graddy says:\n\n'The morning before we came to the ford of Clinch (Blackmore's Station was 10 miles beyond that) these murders were committed. A mother and four children killed within eight of the fort. The husband was in the field, but escaped. A girl about half grown, and three little boys tomahawked and scalped, who were talking while their brains were boiling out. The grandmother asked them if they saw their little brother (this is perhaps the 5th child). What had become of him? Said they didn't know. There were Dutch people.' (In the early days in this area it was very common to refer to people of German extraction as being Dutch. The word Naper, variantly spelled Napier or Nappier, is perhaps from the German. The name is still to be found in this area and the spelling usually takes the form of the latter two.)\n\n'We stayed a good part of the day. Their aunt sat on a stump in sight of the fort and cried all day. Went by Blackmore's Station next day and didn't see the smoke of a chimney after that until we got to Boonesboro. The pretty springs of water and the woods rendered Powell Valley exceedingly beautiful. I could have stopped very freely in it. A rock road all the way down and mountains to one side of us. Just before we got to the foot of Cumberland Mountain, the company, three fourths of a mile ahead of us, had all their horses stolen. they could do nothing better than just turn their featherbeds loose. They could do nothing with them about their cattle. We never saw any Indians and were not interrupted. I was most afraid coming down Cumberland Mountain. The place was narrow and rocky. Stood up on either side not broader than a house. Woods more beautiful in Cumberland Valley than any other place' \"\n\nMore About Frances Alley:\n\nFact 1: killed near Ft.

It was in this Virginia frontier in the last three decades of the 1700s that the Alley family lived, fought, and died. This was the time not only of the American Revolution but also of the great migration along Daniel Boone's Wilderness Trail, in orange, through the Cumberland Gap, and into the wilderness of what is now Kentucky and Tennessee. The Clinch River, in dark turquoise, traced another wilderness road. Along it were various forts, underlined in dark pink, built to protect migrating settlers from hostile Native Americans. Along the Clinch, James, Sr., moved his family in 1777. The Ft. Blackmore area, center, is where his wife Azby Christian Alley witnessed the scalping and deaths of her daughter Fanny Alley Napper/Nappier and Fanny's five children, probably by Cherokees.\n\nFt. Blackmore and Moore's Fort, near Castlewood to the right or east, are places where Daniel Boone with his family stayed before moving into Kentucky. James Jr., and brothers Samuel and John are listed among the troops for this fort in 1777. James was in many military operations during the Revolutionary War. He would later be constable of Castlewood and move his family on Boone's Wilderness Trail through the Cumberland Gap, living eventually in Wayne Co., KY, for ten to twelve years where his daughter Sarah \"Sally\" met Thomas Decker.\n\nGeneration 12\n\n52.

His father's (Thomas Decker's) house was standing on the bank of the Cumberland River when Mother and I were there. It was built high off the ground and there was an old tree standing by it. You could see where the water had left its mark high up on the tree when the river had been in flood. Right across the river from that old house was where Uncle Bill (William) Decker lived when we were there. We went across the river in a little row boat, Mother and I. Just twelve miles from that place is Monticello where the old courthouse was, all covered with vines, and where Grandpa got his marriage license and was married.\n\n\"...the damning of the Cumberland created Lake Cumberland and inundated entirely all the familiar territory that the Decker family called 'Home.' \"\n\nMore About THOMAS DECKER:\n\nBurial: Bugwood Cemetery, Wayne Co., KY\n\nFact 1: listed on census 1820's -1860's in Wayne County, KY;\n\nFact 2: veteran of War of 1812, Capt.

Thomas1 Christian was born 1636 in Isle of Man.\n\nNotes for Thomas Christian:\n\ninfo on Christian family from Debrah McCann and Alley researcher Lawrence Alley, III, RootsWeb WorldConnect Project:\n\nfrom \"Historical and Genealogy of the Woodsons and Their Connections,\" Henry Morton Woodson, appeared in \"William and Mary College Quarterly,\" as 'Something of the Christian Family,' p. 60:\n\n\"This is a family of Scandinavian origin and had attained great eminence at a very early date. They were deemsters or judges in the Isle of Man as early as 1408, and as such succeeded one another for several centuries, embracing many generations. The name was formerly Mac Cristen, then Cristen, and finally about the year 1600 it was changed to its present form by Ewan Mac Cristen who, in 1605, when only twenty-six years old, was made deemster, and held the office fifty-one years. He was also deputy governor of Peel Castle and the most influential man in the island. Early in t he seventeenth century some of the descendants of this ancient family emigrated to Virginia, acquired large bodies of land and entered vigorously into the development of the new country. The Virginia progenitor of the family was Thomas Christian. As 'Mr. Thomas Christian' he patented, October 21, 1687, 1080 [acres] in Charles City County. The term \"Mr.\" accorded to the immigrant, is indicative of social standing. In 1694 'Thomas Christian, Sen.' obtained a patent for 193 acres south of Chickahominy Swamp. It appears that he had at least four sons: (1) Thomas, of Charles City County, who patented land (1712 and 1727) in the forks of Beaver Dam Creek in that part of Henrico county called Goochland; (2) Charles Christian of Charles City County, who located lands in the same vicinity in 1714 and 1727; (3) James Christian in the same vicinity, located land bounding on Thomas's line (1719); (4) John Christina of Charles City County, in the same vicinity...\"\n\nfrom \"Cavaliers and Pioneers,\" Patent Book 4--\n\np. 364: 'Jan 15, 1657, Thomas Christian 100 acres, James City Co., VA, P 167, 249, on N. side of James River and E. side of Chickahominy River, along trees of Capt.

Patent dated 21 Oct, 1687 to Thomas Christian for 1080 acres in Weyanoke Parish, on the south side of Store's/Stoney Run, crossing Black Gutt of the Chickahominy River may well have been the patent for this farm. Formerly called 'Cherry Bottom' this land is thought to have been passed down in the family, by wills, through the Christian family to the present time. According to Bruce B. James, who lives on this property, there is a family cemetery, as well as a slave cemetery to the rear of the old house.\"\n\nChildren of Thomas Christian are:\n\n+ 2 i.

She was born 1685 in New Kent Co., VA.\n\nNotes for James Christian:\n\nfrom Alley researcher Lawrence Alley, III, RootsWeb.com, WorldConnect Project:\n\n\"James Christian is the most likely candidate for the father of Azby. The entire Christian family owned land near to Thomas Alley. Charles Christian had land adjacent. Henrico Co., Land Grants, Book 18, p. 343. This is mostly speculation. Using the process of elimination, Thomas [Christian] can be eliminated, assuming all his children are listed in his will. The wife of Charles [Christian] is too old for a 1722-1730 birth. This leaves only John and James. Unfortunately nothing is known about John's family or if he even married. No other Christians are known to be in the area. There are many gaps in the ages of James's children making it more likely that Azby is a missing child.\"\n\nChildren of James Christian and Ann Macon are:\n\n+ 7 i. Azby3 Christian, born 1730; died April 10, 1798.\n\n8 ii. Richard Christian, born 1700.\n\n9 iii. Joel Christian.\n\n10 iv. William Christian.\n\n11 v. James Christian, born 1725.\n\n12 vi. Judith Christian, born 1711.\n\n13 vii. Gedion Christian, born Bet. February 05, 1727 - 1728.\n\nGeneration No. 3\n\n7. Azby3 Christian (James2, Thomas1) was born 1730, and died April 10, 1798. She married James L. Alley, Sr. 1750 in Henrico, VA, son of Thomas Alley and Francis Reavis. He was born Abt. 1728 in Henrico Co., VA, and died March 26, 1799 in Russell Co., VA.\n\n***For the Alley-Christian connection, go to generation #11 above.***\n\nThe watercolor of an English cottage with cathedral, shown below, provides the background for the Alley genealogy page.
