Evans's breakthrough came when he was cast as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in Fantastic Four (2005) and its sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007). However, it was not until he landed the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America that he became an international sensation. This role not only catapulted him into global stardom but also made him one of the pillars of Marvel's multi-billion dollar franchise. Beyond blockbuster success, Chris Evans has proved himself to be more than just a superhero actor. His range includes roles such as Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010), Curtis Everett in Snowpiercer (2013), and Ransom Drysdale Thrombey in Knives Out (2019). Off-screen, Evans uses his platform for activism focusing on social issues like gender equality and mental health awareness.\n\nKat Dennings, born Katherine Victoria Litwack, is a distinguished American actress who has made significant contributions to both television and film. Born on June 13, 1986, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, Dennings was homeschooled and completed high school at the age of 14. She moved to Los Angeles with her family to pursue an acting career, which began with commercials before she transitioned to television and film. Dennings' breakthrough role came in 2000 when she appeared in HBO's Sex and the City as Jenny Brier. However, it was her portrayal of Max Black in CBS's sitcom 2 Broke Girls, from 2011 to 2017, that truly catapulted her into stardom. The role earned her nominations for the People's Choice Award and solidified her standing in the industry. Dennings also showcased her versatility in films like The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), Big Momma's House 2 (2006), and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (2008). Her performance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as Darcy Lewis in Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013), further extended her reach to a global audience.

Born on June 13, 1986, in Sherman Oaks, California, she shared the role of Michelle Tanner on the popular television series Full House with her twin sister, Ashley. Their performance, which started when they were only nine months old, captivated audiences and laid the foundation for their future endeavors. After Full House, Olsen continued to act alongside her sister in a series of TV shows and direct-to-video movies under their company, Dualstar Entertainment Group. This venture further solidified their status as influential figures in the entertainment industry while also introducing them to the world of entrepreneurship. The two became co-presidents of Dualstar upon their 18th birthday, expanding the brand to include fashion, beauty, and home decor products. In addition to acting and business, Olsen has made significant strides in the fashion industry.

This role also catapulted him to fame, securing his place as one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood. His distinctive gruff voice has also been showcased in several animation features, most notably voicing Buzz Lightyear in the globally successful Toy Story franchise.
