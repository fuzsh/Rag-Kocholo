        "text": "Saint Thomas the Apostle, often remembered as “Doubting Thomas,” is one of the twelve apostles of Jesus. Born in Galilee, Thomas initially struggled with doubt but ultimately became a powerful witness to the resurrection and divinity of Christ.\n\nThomas is best known for his encounter with the risen Christ after the resurrection. When the other apostles told him they had seen the Lord, Thomas famously declared, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nail marks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe” (John 20:25). When Jesus appeared again, He invited Thomas to touch His wounds, prompting Thomas to exclaim, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28). This moment marked a profound transformation in Thomas, turning his doubt into a deep and unwavering faith.\n\nFollowing this encounter, Thomas became a fervent missionary, spreading the Gospel far and wide. Tradition holds that he traveled to India, where he preached the Good News, performed miracles, and established Christian communities. His missionary efforts in India are commemorated to this day, with many Indian Christians tracing their faith back to his evangelization.\n\nThomas’s martyrdom further testifies to his unwavering faith. He is believed to have been martyred in India, sealing his witness to Christ with his blood. His life and legacy continue to inspire believers to seek a deeper understanding and commitment to their faith.\n\nLesson 1: The Journey from Doubt to Faith: Saint Thomas’s life teaches us that doubt is not the end of faith but can be a starting point for a deeper, more authentic relationship with God. His transformation from doubt to profound belief encourages us to seek understanding and trust in God’s revelation.\n\nLesson 2: Courage in Mission: Thomas’s missionary journeys remind us of the importance of courage and determination in spreading the Gospel. His willingness to travel far and endure hardships for the sake of Christ challenges us to be bold and persistent in our own evangelization efforts.\n\nPrayer to Saint Thomas the Apostle:\n\nO Saint Thomas the Apostle, you who journeyed from doubt to unwavering faith, pray for us, that we may seek and find the truth of Christ in our lives. Help us to overcome our doubts and to trust in the Lord’s promises. Through your intercession, may we be courageous witnesses to the Gospel, spreading Christ’s love and truth wherever we go. Amen.\n\nOther Saints We Remember Today\n\nSt. Irenaeus (203), Bishop, Martyr\n\nSt. Leo II (683), Pope"
