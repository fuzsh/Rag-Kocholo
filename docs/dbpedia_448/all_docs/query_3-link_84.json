        "text": "Friday, August 09, 2024\n\nFootball pre-season update\n\nWith the gold medal finally decided in the Olympic Men's Football, as of three minutes ago, it's time to look forward 11 minutes to the start of the new football season.\n\n⚽ It's all go in the Championship at 8pm tonight with a pair of opening matches, one between title contenders Blackburn Rovers and title contenders Derby County and the other between title contenders Sheffield United and title contenders Preston North End. One of these is sure to win the title in nine months time, unless it's one of the other twenty teams who start their campaigns later this weekend.\n\n⚽ All eyes are on Wembley tomorrow for the season's traditional curtain raiser, the Charity Shield. Top teams Manchester City and Manchester United will be playing for glory, honour and an irrelevant bit of silverware before the pitch is urgently cleared in readiness for the return of Taylor Swift next week.\n\n⚽ Manchester United will be back in action for the opening match of the Premier League next Friday, a game in which they may or may not score more goals than Fulham. 379 further matches will follow in which various numbers of goals will be scored and points awarded until one of the teams has more than all the others and their supporters erupt in an orgasm of joy sometime in May.\n\n⚽ The FA Cup is already underway, with the Extra Preliminary Round kicking off last Friday. Royal Wootton Bassett successfully thrashed Mangotsfield United 2-1, whereas Stansted and Biggleswade played out a goalless draw so had to return for a replay on Monday. It was particularly bad luck for Wembley who lost 2-0 to Bedfont Sports so won't be playing at Wembley on 17th May.\n\n⚽ The Scottish Professional Football League also kicked off last weekend, but East Fife aren't playing Forfar Athletic until next weekend so nobody's particularly interested yet.\n\n⚽ If you'd prefer a longer pre-season break, the Women's Super League is still 42 days away.\n\nposted 19:49 :\n\nHYPERLOCAL HISTORY MONTH: Let's vote again\n\nIt's been a big year for voters in London, first the Mayoral elections in May, then the General Election in July. But if you live in Bow East you're about to get another chance to place a cross on a ballot paper, and all because 15302 voters put their cross on a ballot paper somewhere else.\n\nA by-election is being held in Bow East ward for a seat on Tower Hamlets council and the date has been set for Thursday 12th September. Normally the next council election would be in 2026, but the resignation of one of Bow East's three Labour councillors has created a vacancy, and thus a by-election.\n\nCouncillors resign for all sorts of reasons, not always good. But in this case it's because Rachel Blake has a new job, specifically because in July 2022 she was selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of Cities of London and Westminster. She wasn't expected to win, the seat's had a Conservative MP since it was created in 1951, and at the previous election Labour struggled in third. But 2024 was an unprecedented election across the board, even in Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, and against all the odds Rachel romped home by seven percentage points.\n\nSo she's quit as a councillor in Bow.\n\n10 years ago I was first elected as Councillor for Bow East representing Londoners. 3 local elections later, I have now stepped down. Being the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster is my complete focus. Thank you so much to everyone in Bow who put their trust in me. It has been an honour to serve and to provide support and advice to residents and communities. I am proud of delivering a new local plan with affordable housing targets, a programme of Council Homes, cleaning up our air, tackling poverty, getting the Covid jab to the community. @RNBLake (August 2)\n\nWith a swiftness that suggests they knew this was coming, the local Labour party has already selected its new candidate. He's Abdi Mohamed, a Public Affairs Manager for the charity Scope, also Chair of the GMB union's London group for BAME workers, also a local school governor. His Twitter account suggests he goes doorstepping even when there isn't an election on and also that he's much taller than everyone else he goes campaigning with. He'll probably win, in that Labour have taken all three Bow East seats in every election since 2006.\n\nAs yet none of the other parties have put forward a candidate, which isn't surprising given that the by-election was only called on Wednesday. The Stratford and Bow Conservatives are busy tweeting about national rather than local politics, and don't have a prayer. The Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats last updated their local news page in 2022, but might get their act in gear. The Tower Hamlets Greens are similarly quiet online but successfully got a Green candidate elected nextdoor in Bow West in 2022 so might rate their chances.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge comes from Mayor Lutfur Rahman's Aspire party who took all the runners-up places in the last election. They were a long way behind, with less than half of the Labour vote, but experience shows they're also very good at getting the vote out which can (and has) proved decisive in previous votes with a low turnout. An Aspire victory in September would be the least surprising shock result.\n\nAs things stand we only have two councillors representing us here in Bow East - Amina Ali and Marc Francis - but it turns out Marc is Rachel's husband so the E3 political dynasty goes on. We don't yet know who'll be the third Bow East councillor, only that it won't make any difference because Tower Hamlets is a Mayoralty so the number of councillors is irrelevant.\n\nWhat I do note is that I voted for Rachel when she was my local councillor and she's now the MP for Cities of London and Westminster. I also voted for Rushanara Ali when she was my local MP, before the boundaries shifted, and she's now the MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney. And I also voted for Uma Kumaran who's my new local member now that Bow's linked with Stratford, and she's the MP for Stratford and Bow. Which means I've voted for three of the MPs in the current Houses of Parliament, indeed three current women MPs, and what are the chances of that?\n\nposted 08:00 :\n\nBut what are the first stations beyond the Greater London boundary?\n\nI made a list, or rather I made a table.\n\nHerts\n\nMoor Park z6/7\n\nCarpenders Park z7 Herts\n\nElstree and\n\nBorehamwood z6\n\nPotters Bar Herts\n\nCuffley\n\nTheobalds Grove z7\n\nWaltham Cross z7 Essex\n\nBuckhurst Hill z5\n\nRoding Valley z4\n\nGrange Hill z4 Bucks\n\nDenham\n\nIver ONE STOP BEYOND Essex\n\nBrentwood z9\n\nWest Horndon\n\nOckendon\n\nPurfleet Surrey\n\nKempton Park\n\nAshford\n\nEsher\n\nThames Ditton z6\n\nHinchley Wood Surrey\n\nStoneleigh z5\n\nEwell East z6\n\nBanstead z6\n\nChipstead z6 Surrey\n\nMerstham\n\nWhyteleafe z6\n\nUpper Warlingham z6 Kent\n\nEbbsfleet\n\nDartford z8\n\nSwanley z8\n\nDunton Green\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt this is about geography, not stopping patterns. Some trains out of Euston don't stop until Watford Junction and some don't stop until Crewe, but I still say Carpenders Park is the first station beyond the Greater London boundary.\n\nNote that the first station outside London can be in zone 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9, or none of the above, according to the historic vagaries of the zoning system. Most of the unzoned now take contactless, or are scheduled to do so, although I see Hinchley Wood isn't yet on the list.\n\nIn total that's 32 stations One Stop Beyond. I reckon there are only two I've never been to, other than passing through on a train, but plenty I've never blogged properly except in passing. Brace yourself for dormitory suburb reportage, eventually, when I get round to it.\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\nThursday, August 08, 2024\n\nOne Stop Beyond: Hinchley Wood\n\nIn this series I'm taking the train one stop beyond the Greater London boundary, getting off and seeing what's there. Today that means Hinchley Wood, one stop beyond Surbiton on the New Guildford line.\n\n100 years ago these were unsung fields to the east of Esher, officially in the parish of Thames Ditton, sliced through by a non-stopping railway. What changed things was the arrival of the Kingston Bypass in 1927, a dual carriageway which suddenly opened up the potential for development. A speculator purchased land around the point where road and railway crossed, managed to persuade Southern Railway to build a station and commuter expansion was rapid. Today 5000 people live here, in generally very nice houses, and can if they choose be at Waterloo in half an hour flat. Admittedly there are only two interesting things in Hinchley Wood, one of which no longer serves a purpose and one of which has been demolished, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nYou're right, this is the first time I've done a 'One Stop Beyond'. I thought it might be a good idea for a series because people love railways, even when it's really only cover for tedious reportage about minor provincial dormitory suburbs.\n\nHinchley Wood's not a lovely station, not by any definition, but it is an odd one. The island platform is only accessible via a footbridge, not from the main road, and the canopy's in a bit of a state. Passenger numbers are lower than the quietest of tube stations but the ticket office on the platform still opens for four hours and a half every weekday morning. And because they built the station where the tracks bifurcate, one of the platforms runs straight while the other veers off and curves into the distance. To get to London, take the bendy option.\n\nI reckon there are about 30 stations One Stop Beyond the Greater London boundary, so this series could run and run.\n\nHinchley Wood started growing around the station so that's where the shops are. Ignore the doctor's surgery in prime position by the station car park because it's a private clinic, not NHS. Two short parades face off across the memorial gardens, the oldest business being Ashton Davis which has been repairing TV sets since 1960. Cavan Bakery (with its smart looking purple paper bags) claims to have been baking daily since 1929 but that's only true in Twickenham, this is a much later outpost. The eclectic mix also includes a Bangladeshi restaurant, a dry cleaners called Esher Valet, a fishing tackle shop and a bogstandard Costa. If you want Waitrose you have to go to the little shop at the Shell garage by the crossroads.\n\nI could have branded my recent trip to Iver as a One Stop Beyond, ditto my recent trip to Denham. In good news that means I'm not going to be working through the full set because I've already missed two.\n\nThe most exciting thing that ever happened in Hinchley Wood is that Mikhail Gorbachev dropped into the local pub for steak and ice cream. This was in 1997 so he wasn't President of the Soviet Union any more, instead travelling home from a US lecture tour when he was stranded at Heathrow overnight following a bomb scare. He asked his chauffeur to recommend a traditional English pub and was driven to The Hinchley Wood in Hinchley Wood where his party ordered soup, lamb steaks and cherry sundaes. Mikhail had a pint of bitter and a pint of lager, his wife Raisa plumped for water and cognac and their four bodyguards finished off a bottle of whisky. The pub's manager was reportedly \"gobsmacked.\" When McDonald's bought the pub two years later local residents grouped together and successfully fought them off, this after a 500-day sit-in, only to see the building demolished and replaced by an undistinguished stack of retirement flats. There are thus now no pubs in the village and this episode of international diplomacy can never be repeated.\n\nIf you write for a Surrey-based news portal this is exactly the kind of story you could string into a 500 word clickbait article, but please be aware I do not give you permission to nick my photos.\n\nAnother shopping parade stretches up Manor Road North, because Hinchley Wood may not be a large village but it has a decent amount of residual wealth. The wine shop is plainly catering to a need. The vet's is even bigger than the hair salon. The Budgens supermarket is actually a Kavanagh's, so a bit up itself. Crossy's is a souped-up ironmongers selling stepladders, bird food, coal and carving trays. The Residents' Association has done a really nice job with the hanging baskets and flower beds outside. All of Hinchley Wood's councillors are from the Residents' Association, voted through by a considerable margin, because that's the kind of place it is.\n\nDespite this feature being railway-related I didn't arrive or depart by train, I caught the K3 bus from Kingston, because Hinchley Wood is beyond the Oyster boundary but inside the fortunate bit of Surrey with a regular red bus service.\n\nThe road and railway divide Hinchley Wood into four residential quarters, or five if you include the wedge where the railway line splits. The most significant chunk is to the northeast where we find Hinchley Wood's secondary school, Hinchley Wood's primary school and Hinchley Wood's church, which is St Christopher's. It was built late, in 1952, so looks pleasingly postwar with a tapering brick tower and a copper statue of St Christopher carrying the Christ child on his shoulder protruding out front. The first Sunday of the month looks to be the most exciting because the church hosts a family-friendly non-Eucharist in the morning and a hearing aid clinic in the afternoon.\n\nThe trouble with writing about commuter outposts is that a lot of the reportage will be a list of shops and a lot of the rest will be pointing out there are a lot of houses, so it could all get a bit samey.\n\nThe vast majority of Hinchley Wood's houses are detached, and even the ones that look too wide so must be semis turn out to be detached too. The finest have rustic gables, copious tiles and a porch resembling some kind of cathedral doorway. Out front often resembles a car showroom, and there might additionally be landscapers trimming the laurel hedge or tradesmen doing showy home improvements. Hardly anyone's retreated behind security gates so it also looks jolly friendly, but simultaneously jolly expensive - the local estate agent had nothing in its window below £975,000. The cheapest houses are between the railway lines on the former Inland Revenue site, but I see the ward boundary excludes those because their sole access road exits into Thames Ditton.\n\nI walked round Hinchley Wood for two hours researching this, and I'm still a bit cross I never managed to shoehorn the archaic railway footbridges into the narrative, nor the Scilly Isles roundabout, nor the fact it was bin day.\n\nThe thing about the Kingston Bypass is that it was itself bypassed in 1976 when the Esher Bypass was opened, hence the road that tears through Hinchley Wood is no longer the A3 but the A309. On the western side the houses come to an abrupt stop along the line of the local river, The Rythe, which rises on Esher Common and flows independently to enter the Thames at Thames Ditton. A handful of ugly footbridges lead across onto Littleworth Common, the largest greenspace hereabouts, where even the best trodden paths felt like a secret safari on a Wednesday afternoon. The river doesn't yet have a serious Himalayan balsam problem but the pink and white invasion is underway with a significant foothold at the foot of Oaken Lane.\n\nIf you're still reading you may be wondering where the second interesting thing in Hinchley Wood is, and I'm sorry but I kept it back for the final paragraph.\n\nIt's easy to see how the village got its name because if you look on a 100 year-old map the only named feature amid the fields was a small wood called Hinchley Wood. It's still there, covering the northern flank of a small but steep hill accessed from the top of Hillcrest Gardens, and a key part of the local dogwalking circuit. It's known as Telegraph Hill because one of the 13 towers in the London to Portsmouth semaphore tower chain was built at the summit, operational between 1822 and 1847 when the electric telegraph took over. Semaphore House is now a lofty white-painted residence but vanishes in the summer behind a screen of beech trees, so it's fortunate that last time I was here was in winter (researching semaphore towers in some depth) when it very much stood out. For now, alas, the only thing worth seeing in Hinchley Wood can't be seen.\n\nI understand you're not particularly interested in Hinchley Wood, but I am raising the hopes of hundreds of readers who are all sitting there thinking something like \"ooh I can't wait until you get to Cuffley\".\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\nWednesday, August 07, 2024\n\nThe tube was seriously disrupted in northwest London yesterday morning when a signal failure at Wembley Park caused line closures and serious delays. And the advice which popped up is the advice which often pops up in such a situation, which is that tickets were being accepted on alternative services. And I thought, how does that work then?\n\nMost people travelling on the Jubilee line, indeed the vast majority, aren't carrying tickets. They have contactless cards, contactless devices and Oyster cards but not actual paper tickets. So how does accepting tickets on alternative services help anyone?\n\nIf you're in Stanmore when the Jubilee line goes down you don't have a ticket, you have a Pay As You Go device. It's going to be accepted on alternative services no matter what because that's how Pay As You Go works, and it'll charge you the going rate for whatever alternative journey you choose to make. The message that seven alternative services are accepting tickets is of no practical financial use.\n\nIt is possible to buy a paper ticket from Stanmore but you wouldn't, it costs £1.60 more at peak times and twice as much off peak. You could then wave that paper ticket on a bus and ride to Edgware to travel in from there but you wouldn't, you'd use the same PAYG device all the way through.\n\nThe list of alternative ticket-accepting services is impressive, from buses to the Overground to three National Rail operators. The Jubilee line spans the capital so when it fails you need a lot of alternative ways to go. But how do they all suddenly recognise that you were intending to travel on the Jubilee line and now you're travelling with them, and then not charge you any extra for it?\n\nThe Metropolitan line was similarly messed up yesterday and this time tickets were accepted on Chiltern which runs in parallel. But again who's actually got a ticket, and even if you do choose to ride into Marylebone rather than Baker Street the fares are identical, so what's the point in telling us?\n\nThe Elizabeth line also went kaput in west London yesterday, as it has a repeated tendency to do, with a track fault at Southall causing severe delays west of Paddington. This time it's easier to believe some people might have tickets, what with longer distances to travel, but still not many in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIf you were in Slough it's nice to know you could have taken GWR into Paddington instead, although it turns out GWR services were also disrupted so it might not have helped. If you were in Ealing you could have crammed onto the Central line instead, as you always could, and travellers at Heathrow still had the Piccadilly line. I note tickets were not accepted on the Heathrow Express, but they've always been greedier than most.\n\nSo look, I'm sure that when this kind of disruption happens certain protocols are applied and tickets are accepted on alternative services. But why are they telling us this, because it applies to almost nobody yet is given great priority in the messaging?\n\nMy theories:\n\na) it's important to pass this information on to people with tickets, so they do.\n\nb) some magic money-saving algorithm kicks in behind the scenes for PAYG users.\n\nc) this is legacy advice, once relevant, that nobody's ever got round to changing.\n\nAlternatively they might do it as a reminder to passengers of possible alternative methods of travel. If the Jubilee line's buggered and tickets are accepted on London Buses, London Underground, Elizabeth line, DLR, C2C, Southeastern and Thameslink, you might suddenly go \"oooh, I guess I could get a bus and then Thameslink into work\", which you might not realise otherwise.\n\nI guess there must be a good reason for announcing that \"tickets are being accepted on alternative services\". I just don't know what it is.\n\nposted 08:00 :\n\nLast month there were significant closures on the DLR and a replacement bus service ran.\n\nI was surprised to find a leaflet about the replacement bus service in my local library. TfL stopped producing leaflets for weekend engineering work several years ago when websites and smartphones made them redundant, but this was a proper full colour leaflet on thick shiny paper, even better than the old days.\n\nAnd there was one particular sentence that surprised me the most.\n\n\"You must have a valid ticket before boarding the replacement bus service.\"\n\nI've never seen that before, not on a TfL service.\n\nNormally when you get on a TfL replacement bus the Oyster pad is switched off, a red light is showing and you travel for free. It's too much hassle to charge passengers for what's essentially an inconvenience, plus the vehicle being used might not be capable of taking fares for the journey anyway.\n\nSometimes when the disruption is particularly lengthy TfL puts on a proper numbered bus service and charges normal fares, as is currently the case for routes 718, 719 and 720 shadowing the Bakerloo line and Overground north of Queens Park. But even then you don't have to \"have a valid ticket before boarding\", you just get on and swipe.\n\nNational Rail replacement services are different. Officially you should always have a valid ticket before boarding, it's in the terms of carriage, even if this rule isn't always applied. Nobody asked me to pay on the rail replacement bus to Sidcup the other weekend, and it's not hard to get to bussed to Windsor, Hertford or Sevenoaks for nothing if you pick your weekend right.\n\nBut they're tightening up. For many years Greater Anglia have piled passengers onto free coaches when the line through Colchester or Ipswich is closed, no questions asked. But last time I was turfed off a train at Witham they had staff checking tickets in the car park, scanning QR codes as necessary, suggesting the freeloadable era is over.\n\nBut on a TfL service, never. How do you even \"have a valid ticket before boarding\" anyway?\n\nAre you supposed to tap in at the station at the start of your DLR replacement journey, then walk over and wait for the replacement bus? Are you then expected to tap out again at the end, this despite the fact you have no idea if the pad at the final station will be accessible? Or are you supposed to assume the DLR replacement bus is part of a longer journey and only tap in and out at the end of that? I've got a Travelcard so I'm fine, I always have a valid ticket anyway, but PAYG readers have no practical way of complying with the rule.\n\nMy hunch is that \"You must have a valid ticket before boarding the replacement bus service\" was an error, added to a rare leaflet by someone who hadn't thought through what they were saying. But if it's technically true, which technically it might be, how on earth is that supposed to work then?\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\nTuesday, August 06, 2024\n\nTRAFALGAR\n\nSQUARE\n\n£240\n\nLondon's Monopoly Streets\n\nTRAFALGAR SQUARE\n\nColour group: red\n\nPurchase price: £240\n\nRent: £20\n\nArea: 3 acres\n\nBorough: Westminster\n\nPostcode: WC2\n\nHere we are again. Trafalgar Square is the starting point for four streets on the Monopoly board (all the pinks plus Strand) and is also a property in its own right. I've blogged about it on multiple occasions, including what it's like at New Year, how they scare the pigeons, where the shadow of Nelson's Column falls, what it was like to be in the crowd for the 2012 Olympic announcement, performance art on the Fourth Plinth, the build-up to the Coronation, the fact everybody's been, an appearance by the Sultan's Elephant and an entire week of bloggage for the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, so there's no real need to go through it all again. Monopoly rules dictate, however, so I intend to take you on two short circuits, one around the centre and one around the edge.\n\nHistory first. Before this was Trafalgar Square it housed the Royal Mews, originally opened in 1377 to house Richard II's falconers and hawks. In 1534 Henry VIII moved his horses here, in 1732 George II rebuilt it as the Crown Stables and in 1826 George IV had the mews and a few local streets demolished to create a new open space \"to add to the beauty of the approach from Westminster to Charing Cross\". It took until 1835 for the square to be named, until 1844 for it to be opened and until 1850 for the layout to be fully completed. The National Gallery and Nelson's Column were both added during this period, and Ken Livingstone pedestrianised the upper terrace two centuries later. For further background Wikipedia explains all, but Westminster's 2003 Conservation Area audit is also a very good read, as council planning documents tend to be.\n\nCircuit 1: Inner\n\nNelson's Column isn't quite in the centre of the square, more along the southern edge, so we can start there. The Admiral's pillar is 52m high, commemorates the hero of the Battle of Trafalgar and is decorated by four bronze panels cast from captured French guns. The rear quarters of Landseer's four lions are infamously inaccurate due to a lack of available lions to copy, and are guarded by free-standing signs urging tourists not to climb on their backs. Alas the entire menagerie was taped off yesterday while a bloke with a big nozzle gave the foot of the column a good jetwash. This watery performance probably takes place every Monday morning, although I'm basing that assumption on a sample size of one.\n\nHeading clockwise the first plinth you reach supports Charles Napier, an Army general who fought in the Peninsular War and later ruled as Commander-in-Chief in India. His statue was paid for by public subscription, mostly private soldiers, as a token of their appreciation. Displayed nearby are the Trafalgar Square byelaws which forbid anyone to ride an animal, leave a caravan, use a boat, project any missile, attach any banner, erect any tent, play any instrument, collect any money, wash any fabric, sound any loudhailer, light any fire or feed any bird without the express permission of the Mayor.\n\nThe fourth plinth remains General-free and is currently topped by a big man in a hat in his final weeks. It was once thought these modern artworks were merely filling time before the Queen passed away, but she now has and new works are still lined up for the rest of the decade so expect her bronze to end up elsewhere. Beneath is the entrance to the Square's toilets where, due to a contactless issue, a warden is currently employed to stand at the bifurcation point announcing \"20p, cash only\" as you enter. The cafe disappeared four years ago after Covid, he explained to me as if I were an ignoramus.\n\nLook out for the iconic Imperial Standards of Length along the north side of the square, affixed by the Board of Trade in 1876 and more recently restored thanks to Heritage Lottery funding. The main plaque measures one foot, two foot and one yard via a series of metal gaps, but is only guaranteed to be accurate at 62 degrees Fahrenheit. A longer sequence stretches out either side of the steps at floor level with '80 feet' outside the entrance to the toilets. Looking down on Measurement Corner are the heads of Cunningham, Jellicoe and Beatty, each a former Admiral of the Fleet, and above everything on his plinth is a saddle-free George IV, he who set the Square in motion.\n\nThe central stone fountains were designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in the late 1930s, while the surrounding figures of mermaids, tritons and dolphins are by Charles Wheeler. They gush into \"lobed quatrefoiled basins\" which were designed to reduce the amount of standing room in the square and prevent crowds of excessive size from congregating. Alas they're undergoing maintenance works this month, courtesy of \"historic fabric maintenance contractor\" DBR, and I arrived just as hardhatted operatives were stepping across the newly-drained tiles to erect scaffolding around the rim. That'll be weeks of tourist photos ruined.\n\nThe final plinth is topped by Henry Havelock, ruthless subduer of the subcontinent, and was again paid for by public subscription. Close by is what's often been described as London's tiniest police station but it's not, it'd struggle to hold two coppers and was only used an observation post. Its exterior noticeboard contains a copy of the alcohol licence for the former Cafe on the Square dated 1 June 2017, because Trafalgar Square really is full of outdated relics that ought to be taken down. And that ends my inner circuit so it's time to cross at the LGBT+ lights and do the outside.\n\nCircuit 2: Outer\n\n57-66 on the southern side are I believe the only numbered properties with a Trafalgar Square address. 57 houses the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board and 58 the Ugandan High Commission. Only one of these has appeared in a Bond film as Q's laboratory. Next come two coffee frotheries - Caffe Nero at 60-61 and Pret at 62-65 - each topped by unremarkable refurbished offices. And 66 is The Admiralty which promotes itself as London's most central pub, but has only been a boozer for ten years and started out as a branch of the National Westminster Bank. £19.50 is probably on the pricey side for pie and chips, even if it's marinated steak and ale, but a bowl of Marmite roast potatoes will only set you back £5.95.\n\nCanada House flanks the entire western side of the square, a site previously occupied by the Union Club and the Royal College of Physicians. The information board out front was unveiled by The Queen in 2017 and reveals that the fountains' original granite centrepieces were shipped out to Ottawa and Regina when the mermaids turned up. The north flank belongs to the National Gallery, its Sainsbury Wing entrance currently undergoing major renovation as part of the NG200 Welcome Project. In good news all the levitating Yodas and flagchalkers have been displaced this month by a child-friendly art marquee. In bad news the lifts linking the terrace to the piazza are still out of service.\n\nOut east is St Martin-in-the-Fields, a church which was indeed in the fields until Tudor times although the current classical landmark is just 300 years old. There'd be a much better view of the square from its steps if they chopped down a few plane trees, which thankfully they haven't. South Africa House comes next with its golden springbok, while on the pavement outside is a flurry of kiosks specialising in tacky souvenirs and the flogging of sightseeing bus tickets. And the good news is we don't need to complete the circuit because the rest of the outer perimeter is officially on the Strand, on Whitehall or on a separate mini loop called Charing Cross. Trafalgar Square's not even properly square for heaven's sake, but remains endlessly bloggable so I can guarantee I'll be back.\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\nMonday, August 05, 2024\n\nWhy are people wrong?\n\nAnd not just slightly wrong, but persistently obstinately pigheadedly wrong.\n\nThere's no need to be wrong these days, all the facts are there. All you need to do is look.\n\nExperts have spent years establishing the truth, often many lifetimes, so we ought to trust their conclusions rather than jump to ridiculous incorrect conclusions. A simple search for facts is all it takes to skewer these falsehoods, but people blunder on convinced their version is correct whereas in fact it's fundamentally wrong.\n\nIt's not clear where all this wrongness comes from. Nobody's born with wrong opinions but many accrue them later in life. Could be nature, could be nurture, probably the latter.\n\nThere are teachers trying to undo the wrongness parents have wrought. There are parents trying to undo the wrongness teachers have wrought. A lot of the wrongness comes from friends and social situations where pressure moulds us, and a lot comes from never having been taught right or wrong in the first place.\n\nThere's factual wrong and then there's moral wrong. Factual wrong ought to be easier to counter but not everyone has all the information, perhaps through ignorance, perhaps through not looking hard enough, perhaps because it's been modified or hidden. Those guilty of factual wrong thus often blunder in and make things worse, sometimes appallingly so, and those who pushed the untruths often cheer unseen from the sidelines, job done.\n\nMoral wrong is harder to define. People think they know what's morally right but there are shades and nuances, even in the case of absolute moral judgements the vast majority would take as fixed. Here the waters muddy but this isn't always recognised, thus people go round stating so-called unalienable truths which to other eyes are patently wrong.\n\nSo much in our society is tarnished by being seen to be wrong when perhaps it isn't. People with a rigid worldview bang on about their truths to the exclusion of other opinions. If they're particularly good at this they shift the argument away from truth to the detriment of all. They of course think the rest of us are the wrong'uns, despite the wrong'uns being them.\n\nPolitics is all about shades of wrong, a spectrum of beliefs where all of us eventually come to rest. Nothing in politics is undeniably wrong, it all depends where you stand, but that doesn't stop millions of people describing millions of other people as wrong and firmly believing they're right.\n\nOne particularly devious political tactic is claiming to know what everyone else is thinking. \"What people really want is...,\" they'll argue, before outlining something only certain people want. The inference is always that if you're not thinking this you're wrong, and they get away with it because it resonates so strongly with those who think it's right.\n\nWe can all point at a moment where society took a wrong turn but we can't all agree when and what that was. One citizen's wail of despair is another citizen's liberation, and vice versa, has been since the dawn of time.\n\nSome people descend into becoming beacons of wrongness. They once held it all together, indeed were convincingly personable, then found their hobbyhorse and rode it relentlessly without a care for how wrong it is. Please stop, the rest of us cry, please stop with your relentless stream of wrongness... or are suckered in and join the wrong crowd on the wrong side of the argument.\n\nAnd too many people are inordinately obsessed by other people being wrong. Look at what this person is saying, they say, look how wrong it is. Look at this too, also wrong, indeed shockingly incorrect, as is this, and this, and this, and this. They appear to spend all their time being appalled by the wrongness of others, and thus amplify that wrongness so they can't unsee it and alas neither can we.\n\nThese people were more interesting before they became obsessed by others' wrongness. They'd tell you about themselves, things they did, what they liked, but now they only point out flaws in others and how wrong they are. You can perhaps deduce what they believe because it's the opposite of what they're frothing about, but in attempting to counter negativity they end up mainlining negativity themselves.\n\nWe shouldn't fixate relentlessly on wrongness. So many things in life are wrong that it threatens to overwhelm, to tarnish the day and drag us down. There's nothing we can do about the biggest wrongs either, the scale of the injustice being so great that one angry little message from an insignificant soul will change absolutely nothing.\n\nBut equally we really should fixate on wrongness. Someone needs to make a stand, someone needs to counter the arguments else the grim tide will roll in and all will be lost. We can be one voice among many, a wave that sweeps back and changes the world for the better (or at least better serves our own worldview, be that fundamentally wrong or right).\n\nSometimes what's wrong changes. Many years ago it was right to think and act a certain way, then things moved on and a different viewpoint took hold. Our moral compass never shifted but society's did, and unless we adapt we can find ourselves on the wrong side of the argument... or railing that it should never have changed.\n\nIt's human nature to assume that others are wrong and we are right. It's particularly easy to do this if we surround ourselves with like-minded souls and like-minded opinions, an echo chamber that magnifies our assumptions and reinforces our beliefs. That's great if we are indeed correct by verifiable means, and somewhat dangerous in any other circumstance.\n\nOther people are all too often wrong, that's just how it is. Their wrongness causes ripples, creates friction and makes our lives worse. But it's worth remembering that sometimes we just haven't looked hard enough, or thought hard enough, and the viewpoint that's wrong is our own.\n\nLife'd be better if we stopped and thought before applying the label of wrongness to others, remembering wrongness can be a sliding scale, a directional vector, a subjective opinion, and sometimes we're at fault.\n\nBut sometimes no, other people really are wrong and we must call them out and attempt to put things right, because the very nature of our society depends on it.\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\nSunday, August 04, 2024\n\nLondon's only independent bus operator threw in the towel on Friday, withdrawing their services from eleven routes in north London. Sullivan Buses have operated out of South Mimms since 1998 and will continue to run their Herts-based services as usual. But boss Dean Sullivan has had enough of TfL, and in a somewhat combative statement cited increased operating costs, delays in receiving payments and not winning any contracts recently for his decision to pull out of London completely. It's not all one-way traffic however, with alleged issues of reliability, compliance, vehicle maintenance and driver retention over a lengthy period. Whatever, for thousands of ordinary passengers trying to travel by bus in Barnet, Enfield, Haringey and Redbridge it's a right pain.\n\nFor the three school routes it's no big deal, given it's August. But for the other eight it's caused a manic scramble to fill the gap using alternative drivers and alternative vehicles from alternative operators, all cobbled together at the very last minute. I went out to see how much of a mess it was and also to see how well TfL managed to communicate what was going on, and it won't surprise you to hear it was a muddle-through all round.\n\n217 Turnpike Lane - Waltham Cross (rescued by Arriva)\n\nThis used to be Sullivan's flagship TfL route, a radial anchor up the Great Cambridge Road, so is perhaps the biggest potential disruption. In good news the 217 is shadowed throughout by just two other routes, the 231 and 317, so on Saturday nobody was going to be left by the wayside. In bad news nobody had any idea when it was coming, because in common with all the ex-Sullivan routes it simply fell off the radar and vanished from the apps, just like travelling in London used to be 20 years ago.\n\nWhen a 217 did turn up it had a blank blind, no destination and a route number printed on paper propped up in the window. You can't magic up the right information on an old bus's blind, certainly not overnight, (something Sullivan Buses were particularly poor at even on routes they'd run for years). Passengers were delighted to discover the Oyster reader wasn't working (often an issue with replacement vehicles), and were alerted to the good news by a scrawled \"Not Working\" message covering the pad. I have no idea how frequently these buses were running but the 217 ran successfully for me.\n\n298 Arnos Grove - Potters Bar (rescued by Uno)\n\nMany's the time I've waited for ages for a non-existent 298 in a lonely layby, indeed the route's unreliability has long been a hint that Sullivan's operations weren't optimal. But this one turned up roughly when the timetable said it should have done, again in a vehicle with the route number stuck to the windscreen. Admittedly the vehicle had 383 branding plastered all over the outside and '383 to New Barnet' along the side, that being the only TfL route Uno normally operates, but the 17 year-old single decker got everyone where they wanted to go.\n\n299 Muswell Hill - Cockfosters (rescued by Go Ahead London)\n\nAnother free ride with a disconnected Oyster pad, hurrah. Again the route number was only visible thanks to printed A4 sheets and sticky tape, not in any way helped by both destinations being stuck to the window so it wasn't clear whether the bus was going to Muswell Hill or Cockfosters. At Southgate station I saw drivers walking round carrying their own printed 299 to stick in the window of whichever allocated vehicle turned up, and there was a sense of all this being done very much on the fly.\n\n327 Waltham Cross - Elsinge Estate (rescued by Metroline)\n\nI didn't risk going all the way to almost-Hertfordshire for this infrequent looper that might or might not have been running. \"May be subject to journey cancellations\" is bloody useless advice for potential travellers, it turns out.\n\n389 Barnet - Western Way\n\n399 Barnet - Hadley Wood\n\nThis duo are TfL's least used routes, and as such they were sacrificed on Saturday with no buses running. I suspect a number of elderly residents waited at the roadside for a non-existent hail & ride bus, oblivious to the muted news that services are due to resume on Monday.\n\n549 South Woodford - Loughton (not yet rescued by Stagecoach)\n\nThe 549 is another little-used woefully-infrequent route, indeed it's due to vanish in six weeks' time and become part of route W14 instead. When I set out in the morning the latest information was \"We are planning to run as many services as possible\" and only when I got to South Woodford did I discover this was absolutely none at all. It's all very well being advised to use the TfL Go app to check for disruption, but a design flaw means routes only show up if they're geographically close so the NO SERVICE message popped up unhelpfully late.\n\nW9 Southgate - Chase Farm Hospital (rescued by Stagecoach)\n\nThis single decker serves a lot of Enfield streets served by no other routes so its absence would be problematic, and indeed was. I waited at the Southgate terminus for over half an hour and nothing happened - no buses arrived, none departed and nobody seemed to know what was happening. I would have asked inside the station but it was closed for engineering works, and the pink-tabarded operative outside was only au fait with replacement buses. I ended up chatting to a would-be passenger who eventually gave up and caught a 121 halfway home instead. He didn't sound surprised when I told him Sullivan had pulled out at the last minute, telling me \"I was talking to a driver and he said they just don't know how to run it.\"\n\nThe one bit of mitigation that seems to have been done properly was pinning up 'diversion' signs along the ex-Sullivan routes to tell unfamiliar drivers which way to go. They looked proper, practical and accurate, which is quite something given they must have been produced in less than 24 hours, suggesting at least one team at TfL is on the ball. Drivers may have been well informed but passengers certainly weren't, indeed I only discovered the W9 didn't start running until noon long after I'd departed. When crisis strikes it seems TfL don't have the communication skills to explain what's going on, with too few staff on the ground and an insufficiently responsive team elsewhere. Fingers crossed things have tightened up by tomorrow.\n\nposted 08:00 :\n\nHere are the other three submissions to my \"Write A Post in 15 minutes\" challenge. They have more of an out and about theme. The first is from Peter who lives in south Devon, not actually in Honiton but fairly close. The second is from Lorenzo and was originally laid out with ten intermediate photos (which I have spent more than 15 minutes editing). The third is from Christopher, who I'm pretty sure is the youngest contributor. Thanks to all three of you! I may be out of a job soon.\n\n8) Honiton Hot Pennies\n\nAmongst some of the stranger annual events in the country celebrated annually for centuries is the Honiton Hot Pennies tradition in Devon. It started when the town was given a Royal Charter to hold an annual fair 803 years ago. In the 13th century in this important coaching town was on the old Roman London to Exeter road. Amongst other events this was a staging point to change horses and was used by the messenger travelling from Falmouth to London in 1805 with hot news that Nelson had won at Trafalgar.\n\nHot Pennies is basically an amnesty for the day for all the rouges and vagabonds who had been evicted from the town, encouraging everyone in the surrounding area to visit the fair, allowing the riffraff a day back in town for the annual fair to help swell the stallholders takings. It starts with the Town Cryer holding a garlanded pole with a glove on the top and proclaiming \"no man may be arrested so long as this glove is up\", which encouraged locals to attend without fear of being arrested over bad debts.\n\nThe local gentry thought it fun to throw red hot pennies out of the windows for the poor to scrabble for. Those of a certain age will understand that as well as burn an old penny might have also given a nasty bump if it hit you on the head. These days of course the pennies are significantly smaller, and also gently warmed to save burnt fingers attending the local surgery.\n\nIt is a fun hour, usually throwing pennies from the upstairs windows of a couple of pubs, a restaurant, a solicitors and one other business. Unfortunately you have missed it this year, it was last month, but if you crave more Devon madness there is always the Ottery Tar Barrels on 05 November, but you can watch only. Runners with a barrel must have lived all their life in Ottery.\n\n9) Day trip to Wiltshire\n\nNo car? Don't like driving? Don't worry there's plenty of fine places seemingly in the middle of nowhere that are actually accessible. Simply rock up at Paddington station just before 10:00 & buy a day return to Swindon (top tip if you only have a Network Railcard split your tickets at Didcot 🙄)\n\nArrive Swindon, and unless you're a real purist take local bus to Coate Water Country Park and walk over the spiral bridge crossing the M4 passing to the West of Chiseldown.\n\nFollow the Ridgeway and you'll eventually arrive at Avebury Stone Circle. There's a pub there too if you're thirsty. And the bus stop is right there for an hourly £2 bus back to Swindon. Enjoy.\n\n10) Richmond Park after dark\n\nOn Monday I attended a concert at Kingston University. Looking at the public transport options, I decided I would cycle from Wimbledon tube station, across Wimbledon Common to Kingston, and then after the concert I would cycle across Richmond Park to Richmond tube station. I am not familiar with either Wimbledon Common or Richmond Park, so the journey held as much interest as the concert. I checked online for any cycling restrictions, and worked out what routes to take.\n\nAll went smoothly (apart from crossing the A3). The most striking part of the journey was the ride through Richmond Park in the dark. The gates are closed to vehicular traffic after dark, but not to pedestrians or cyclists. Without any street lighting the park is properly dark, and my bike lights illuminated relaxed-looking deer grazing by the side of the road. It was a big contrast to the built-up areas nearby.\n\nposted 01:00 :\n\nSaturday, August 03, 2024\n\nHere are six brief posts, none of which I spent more than 15 minutes on.\n\n1) The consultation report for \"Extending the DLR from Gallions Reach to Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead\" has just been published. At this very early stage in the project it focused on asking people whether they thought extending the DLR from Gallions Reach to Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead was a good idea. Unsurprisingly people thought it was.\n\nThe five most popular suggestions were all people suggesting TfL should do something else.\n\n• Alternative extension of London Overground from Barking Riverside to Thamesmead\n\n• Extend DLR further into Borough of Bexley/Greenwich\n\n• Extend DLR from Thamesmead to Abbey Wood\n\n• Thamesmead should be served by Trams instead\n\n• Extend DLR further into East London and/or Essex\n\nTfL's response in each case was \"Our focus is on delivering a DLR extension to Thamesmead\".\n\nThese are the five stupidest responses I saw:\n\n» Concern the DLR will increase the risk of floods\n\n» Concern extending to Barking Riverside is unnecessary\n\n» Concern that road users are being overlooked\n\n» Suggestion to close spur between Gallions Reach and Beckton stations\n\n» Suggestion for an underwater tunnel on the Thames River\n\n2) I went to London Viewpoint at the top of Stanmore Country Park and it was magical. Nobody else was present. The common buzzed with summer life. Bees were feeding on white and purple vetch. Free refreshments were provided by adjacent blackberries. The skyline rippled in shades of grey. Wembley's arch was borderline visible. A biplane flew over.\n\nOn the downside central London was obscured. I had hoped if I arrived at noon the mist would have cleared but it hadn't. Also Harrow council's viewpoint sign is starting to degrade. Also people keep cutting the lock on the car park and Harrow Nature Conservation Forum are tired of it. Also they're looking for a volunteer to unlock the car park at 10.30am on Sunday mornings. I've written about the viewpoint before if you want more than fifteenminutesworth.\n\n3) As you enter Hertfordshire there are signs describing it as County of opportunity.\n\nI wondered what other counties have slogans on their signs.\n\nThese are all the ones I managed to find in 15 minutes.\n\nBedfordshire: A progressive county\n\nBuckinghamshire: Birthplace of the Paralympics\n\nCornwall: Kernow a'gas dynergh\n\nHertfordshire: County of opportunity\n\nLancashire: A place where everyone matters\n\nLeicestershire: The Heart of Rural England\n\nNorfolk: Nelson's County (may not be current)\n\nNorthumberland: England's Border Country\n\nStaffordshire: The Creative County\n\nEssex sometimes says 'Host county for the London 2012 Olympic Games Mountain Bike competition' but that's underneath the county sign, not on it.\n\n4) This red hopper was outside Ealing Broadway station yesterday afternoon. But it was empty.\n\nIt said Evening Standard FREE PLEASE TAKE ONE but you couldn't do that because they don't print Evening Standards on Fridays any more. The last Friday edition was last Friday with an Olympic headline ALLONS Y! There won't be any Evening Standards in the hopper on Monday either because they printed the last Monday edition this week. From now on the paper will only be published from Tuesday to Thursday, and that's only until later this year when it'll go weekly instead. Presumably it won't include any actual news any more, only features.\n\nI thought I'd research the dates London's evening papers went extinct, in reverse chronological order...\n\n2024: Evening Standard\n\n2009: London Lite\n\n2009: The London Paper\n\n1987: London Evening News\n\n...but I ran out of time\n\n5) HYPERLOCAL HISTORY MONTH: My freezer\n\nMy freezer is on top of my fridge in a separate compartment and is colder. There are five things stuck to it.\n\n• Three magnetic strips formerly used on TfL rainbow boards (Good service/Part Suspended/Minor delays). n.b. please note I bought these from the London Transport Museum shop, I didn't nick them.\n\n• A digital kitchen timer (although the battery's run out so the screen's blank) n.b. it seems to run out quite quickly which is why I don't use it.\n\n• Two magnetic letters (currently H and N) n.b. both of these were on my fridge when I wrote about my fridge.\n\n• A magnet with the telephone number of the Tower Hamlets Out of Hours medical service (020 7377 7151) n.b. I have never needed to ring this number, but you never know.\n\n• A freebie fridge magnet featuring the Large Hadron Collider (which I picked up at the Royal Society summer science exhibition) n.b. I'm not sure which summer it was.\n\nI don't have time left to list all the contents of my freezer, mainly because I spent too long trying to research what year I got the Large Hadron Collider fridge magnet, but I can confirm the contents include peas, sweetcorn, breaded fish and two own brand choc ices.\n\n6) The worst titles of Time Out/Secret London/MyLondon articles published so far this month:\n\n» London train strikes August 2024: everything you need to know (click on article... no strikes are planned)\n\n» This Jaw-Droppingly Beautiful Beach Is One Of The UK’s Best Kept Secrets – And It’s Less Than 90 Minutes From London (click on article... it's in Folkestone)\n\n» This Curiously Crooked Café Bar Has Lived Many Lives – And It’s Only An Hour Away From London (click on article... it's in Windsor)\n\n» The London commuter town that used to be slated but is now 'best place to live' outside city (click on article... it's Slough)\n\n» The First Of Four Supermoons To Light Up London Skies This August – Up To 30% Brighter (click on article... not for another three weeks)\n\n» Londoners warned against wearing a certain type of shoe when travelling on Tube and train (click on article... it's 'soft and open-toed')\n\n» New London weather map forecasts exactly when it will finally cool down after 28C two week heatwave (click on article... daytime temperatures will \"stubbornly remain above 20C\" until 16th August)\n\n7) If you'd like to write a post for this blog, now's your chance.

A recent set covers the Lower Lea Valley, an area of \"historically relatively low trip-generating industrial land progressively transforming into higher trip-generating residential land uses\". When it was mostly river and industry it didn't need many buses. Now it's becoming densely-packed flats it probably needs more. [25 page pdf]\n\nThis map shows the southern end of the study area between Stratford and the Thames. The report asserts that completed units (green) are broadly located within close proximity of the existing transport network, but planned/under construction units (red/orange) are larger and often \"in more remote locations with limited access or on the edge of 400 metres from existing network\". 400m is TfL's magic distance in bus network planning, their target being that fewer than 5% of Londoners live more than 400m from a bus route. The developers of these estates will also have paid 'S106 contributions' for bus enhancement, a financial sweetener which helps grease the wheels of any improved bus services.\n\nArea 1: Sugar House Lane\n\nThis newbuild site pokes south from Stratford High Street near the Bow roundabout and will eventually contain 1200 new homes. It's been growing for over five years and is substantially complete along the main road and the Three Mills River, but the majority of the site remains a building site or is entirely vacant, thus full-on bus demand remains a long way off. The complication here is that the development is surrounded on three sides by rivers and the only road bridge at the southern end goes to Three Mills Studios and no further. Thus the best the bus planners can currently do is extend a local bus route to terminate within the development, and they've pencilled in the 205 for consideration. On the plus side it'd only be three stops further, but on the negative side the route is already deemed to be on the long side and this might tip it into unreliability.\n\nBut developers anticipated this issue a long time ago so included plans for a new bridge to be built across the River Lea close to my local Tesco, allowing a potential bus route in and out. They even ensured the new flats on the far side had an access road alongside, this at least eight years ago, but as yet Culvert Drive ends abruptly at a temporary playground and no attempt has been made to bridge the gap.\n\nIf it's ever built, the bus planners reason, three other possibilities come into play. The 205 could be extended one stop further to what's now Tesco, connection made. Alternatively the 488 could be diverted at the very end of its route to deviate down Sugar House Lane before crossing the bridge to Tesco. Or the D8 could be diverted down Sugar House Lane, completely skipping its twiddle round the Bow Roundabout and Bromley High Street, potentially making the route a lot more efficient. Of the three the D8 option is probably the best, although I say that through gritted teeth because it'd mean taking it away from where I live.\n\nBut there are huge infrastructural problems. The first is that for the new bridge to be usefully connected to the A12 my local Tesco and its environs need to be completely redeveloped allowing for a new more efficient road network. This has been on the cards since 2011, indeed TfL once chipped in with plans for a full-on intervention which would have introduced a signalised junction on the Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road. But that consultation never reached a successful outcome, funding essentially dried up and now looks to have been kicked even further into the future than before.\n\nI checked the latest version of the LLDC Infrastructure Delivery Plan Project List dated May 2024, the relevant row of the spreadsheet being number 70, \"Sustainable transport improvements at Bromley-by-Bow, including but not limited to new junction for buses and improved pedestrian and cycle links across the A12 (to include a pedestrian surface crossing)\". Apparently it's only 25% funded, the redevelopment of Tesco has no planning permission and the phasing of the project has just slipped from Medium- to Long-term. Essentially it isn't going to happen before Sugar House Lane is complete, and maybe not even after that.\n\nThe second issue is that the bus planners repeatedly mention that their changes will bring a \"new connection to local supermarket\". Not so. The redeveloped Tesco is going to be a lot smaller than the current superstore - in the last set of plans less than a quarter of the size - and a Tesco Express would no longer be a true retail destination so why send buses there? I live in fear of developers bulldozing the existing store and rationalising its car park in favour of stacky flats because it'll wreck my local shopping options, but I remain optimistic it'll never happen because in the last 13 years it never has.\n\nI also take issue with the bus planners saying the southern tip of Sugar House Lane is \"more than 400m from the bus network\" because measured in a straight line it definitely isn't. Even if you take rivers into account it isn't more than 420m from buses on Stratford High Street, and quite frankly people who choose to move to the tip of a peninsula ought to be able to cope with that. The simplest solution to the whole SHL situation, in the absence of a non-existent bridge, is not to bother sending any buses there at all.\n\nArea 2: Leven Road development & Aberfeldy Re-development\n\nThis is bigger but simpler. What's coming, according to the bus plan, is 2800 units at Leven Road, 1200 units at Aberfeldy Estate and 500 units at Poplar Bus Depot, a total of 4500 new homes. The biggest site is on the former Poplar Gasworks, a squarish plot nudged into a bend in Bow Creek which has recently started absolutely shooting up. The first 9- and 10-storey gabled blocks now have residents, more are under construction further back and a Sainsburys Local has opened underneath (a facility the residents of the original Aberfeldy Estate were never deemed worthy of). It's all happening shockingly fast.\n\nPoplar Riversiders already have the runty 309 to ferry them quickly east to Canning Town, or more slowly to the west, but northbound connections have always been poor. The plan is thus to extend the 488 from Bromley-by-Bow to a stand alongside the development in Leven Road, bringing swift connections to the District Line too. A longer route would require more vehicles and more drivers but the developers have already paid an S106 contribution for exactly this to happen so I expect it will.\n\nArea 3: West Ham\n\nBy 'West Ham' they mean the massive development site on the western side of the station, again a former gasworks where remediation costs are now outweighed by property prices. It's been named Twelvetrees Park in an act of greenwash branding and will one day contain 3800 homes making it the largest site on the bus planners' list. Again it's shooting up rapidly but only on one side, nobody's moved in yet and the vast majority of the site remains blank. But two sturdy footbridges are now in place to connect to Manor Road and a brand new station entrance is under construction, which does beg the question of why you'd want to catch an infrequent bus rather than walking over to West Ham and catching a fantastic selection of trains.\n\nThe bus planners have no intention of sending the existing 276 or 323 buses into the estate because that would \"result in a network hole elsewhere\". So they've looked around and spotted the 488 again and suggested it could be extended via Twelvetrees Crescent to enter round the back, terminating at a new bus stand near the station. But you can't send the 488 to Leven Road and also send it here, plus what use is a connection to Bromley-by-Bow anyway? Another option would be to extend the 300 north from Canning Town, zigzagging in along the side of the bus garage, but why would you take a bus from Canning Town when you can already do that by train?\n\nA third option is the creation of a Crows Road bus-only connection, this currently an insignificant service road beside the railway which would connect to an insignificant industrial dead end. As a positive this would also pass the 2100 homes proposed at Bromley-by-Bow Gasworks, a contaminated cluster of gasholders due to evolve into controversially cylindrical towers that got the nod from Newham Council just last month. But nobody needs a bus through this riverside wasteland for many years to come, indeed the whole link road plan screams 'aspirational nice-to-have', and we've likely now reached the bus planners' fantasy event horizon.\n\nArea 4: Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\nThe options document ends with a proposal to extend the 241 through as yet under-developed corners of the Olympic Park, something which was launched as a real-life consultation in May so doesn't need to be here because it's already happening.
