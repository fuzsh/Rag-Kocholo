        "text": "At Carousel Buses, we’re focused on providing customers with convenient and affordable bus travel options. We operate around 45 buses in and around Buckinghamshire radiating from High Wycombe, where our depot is located. Our buses serve a number of locations including Beaconsfield, Gerrards Cross, Amersham, Chesham, Slough, Uxbridge and Heathrow Airport.\n\nWhilst regular bus services are an excellent option for most of our customers, some of you informed us that you also need to travel around High Wycombe to locations that couldn’t be reached more directly without having to change buses.\n\nWe’ve listened to your feedback and with the support from Buckinghamshire Council and the Government, we’ve introduced PickMeUp.\n\nPickMeUp covers High Wycombe town and extends as far as Wycombe Air Park, Downley Common, Wooburn Green, Flackwell Heath and Pedestal Roundabout on the West Wycombe Road.\n\nWye Valley Volunteers offers a service in which volunteers use their own cars to drive clients to medical appointments such as to hospitals, GP surgeries and dentists. In doing this we are able to help those who would have difficulty in getting around independently whether through age, infirmity or other needs. We maintain a team of forty plus drivers who cheerfully undertake these trips and find pleasure themselves in relating to clients.\n\nIf you need transport for a medical, or medically related, appointment, you should contact the team at the office with the full information including the date, location of your appointment, as well as your full name, address and telephone number. The office will then find a driver who is able to fulfil the trip and then we will ring you to confirm. At the arranged time, the driver will collect you, take you to the appointment, wait and then drive you home.\n\nWe ask for a small donation (the suggested amount based on mileage) to be paid directly to the driver towards his or her petrol expenses.\n\nOur team of volunteer drivers and telephonists make arrangements for our clients who want to be taken from their homes to various destinations. Our clients can be anyone who needs a lift, young and old.\n\n​Our drivers will take clients anywhere reasonably local, and further afield for medical purposes. Popular destinations are hospitals, surgeries, supermarkets, hairdressers and local shops. Drivers use their own cars, so some cars may not be suitable for everyone. We work closely with Penn and Highfield Surgeries.\n\nFor clients to book a ride, call 01494 816909 (Mon-Fri 10am and 1pm). We are closed on Bank Holidays and over the Christmas and New Year period.\n\n​We do not provide an emergency service, so all bookings have to be made at least two days before, and not more than two weeks before the event. You will receive confirmation of your ride, and be given the name of your driver.\n\nThe Older Drivers Forum is always looking for new ways to support mature motorists to carry on driving safely for longer.\n\nWe are pleased to announce we are teaming up with Liverpool John Moores University in a study to look at attitudes to road safety and driving which will help us in the future address relevant subjects and advice so we can help tailor our website and the right information to support you.\n\nTransport service: we take patients wherever they need to go, whether it’s just to the local surgery or to a hospital appointment in High Wycombe, Stoke Mandeville, John Radcliffe in Oxford or even to a London hospital. Volunteer drivers take you to your appointment, make sure you are in the right place at the right time and bring you home afterwards. This service is charged at 65p per mile. The transport office is open for enquiries or bookings from 10:00am – 11:00am Monday to Friday (01628 476139). Outside these hours please leave a message and we will call back the next weekday.\n\nOur teams will help by discharging patients safely as well as providing ongoing support to foster independence, improve wellbeing and minimise the risks of early readmission.\n\nThe service is funded by Buckinghamshire Council and is in joint partnership with Age UK Buckinghamshire and Age UK Hillingdon Harrow & Brent.\n\nThis service supports patients being discharged from both Stoke Mandeville and Wexham Park Hospitals. Our friendly Discharge Team will transport people home and help them settle in after their hospital stay. Our Community Support Team can provide 4-6 weeks of support at home to help with shopping, light housework and emotional support in order to prevent readmission and improve independence at home."
