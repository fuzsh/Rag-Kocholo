        "text": "St Thomas More - Feast Day 22 June\n\nSt Thomas More was always honest, kind and caring. His Christian faith was so important to him that he died rather than give it up.\n\nHe had many gifts, including a great sense of humour and he enjoyed making people laugh. Thomas was good at speaking and listening and was a great debator. His talent as a writer shone through in the many history and poetry books he wrote.\n\nHe was born in 1478. His father, Sir John More, was a well known lawyer and his mother's maiden name was Agnes Granger. The family lived in Cheapside, London.\n\nWhen he was eight years old, Thomas went to St Anthony's School in Threadneedle Street, where he learnt Latin. Thomas enjoyed his school and achieved well. As a twelve year old, he was page boy to Cardinal Morton. Thomas went to university in Oxford when he was fourteen and in 1498 he became a law student.\n\nIn 1505 Thomas married a lady named Jane Colt and they had four children: Margaret, Elizabeth, Cecily and John. Sadly, Jane died and Thomas married again. His family grew after he adopted several children.\n\nThomas was a great animal lover and he owned many unusual animals, such as: monkeys, a fox, a weasel, a beaver and many rabbits.\n\nAs a successful young lawyer, Thomas became part of King Henry VIII's court. In 1520 Thomas was knighted by the King and became Sir Thomas More. He was a good friend of the King who would often visit Thomas' house in Chelsea, where they would discuss Greek, theology or astronomy. The King respected Sir Thomas's wisdom and made him Lord Chancellor in 1529.\n\nIn 1532, Sir Thomas resigned as Lord Chancellor because King Henry VIII was made head of the Church of England, an appointment Thomas did not agree with. Two years later, Thomas was sent to the Tower of London because he would not accept that the King was head of the church.\n\nSir Thomas was sentenced to death for disagreeing with the King, and beheaded on 6th July 1535. Before he died, Sir Thomas said, \"I am the King's good servant but God's first\".\n\nSt Thomas More\n\nOur Class Saints\n\nReception: Saint Joseph - Feast Day 19 March\n\nSaint Joseph\n\nGod chose Joseph a young carpenter of Nazareth to be the foster father of Jesus and the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary. After they were engaged to be married an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him that Mary would give birth to a Child who would be the Son of God.\n\nMary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem to register for the census. They could find no place to stay except a stable. There Mary gave birth to her Son and laid Him in a manger.\n\nAt the word of an angel Joseph took Jesus and Mary to Egypt and stayed there till the angel told him to go back to Nazareth. At Nazareth Joseph worked hard for Jesus and Mary. Later, Jesus worked with Joseph in the carpenter shop and learnt how to make things out of wood. Joseph died in the arms of Jesus and Mary.\n\nYear 1: Saint Francis of Assisi - Feast Day 4 October\n\nSaint Francis of Assisi\n\nFrancis was born in 1182. His parents gave their son all the good things that money could buy. He liked poems, songs and parties and became a knight for a while; he had a dream telling him to go home and to follow God. When he got home Francis went to pray in an old Church. There he heard Jesus telling him to rebuild it. He sold some of his father's best cloth and repaired the Church. He took off his fine clothes and gave them to the poor and left home.\n\nFrancis began to visit hospitals and to serve the sick. He believed that everything was made by God was very good. He admired the great and wonderful things of the world; he told all the birds and animals to praise God.\n\nSome people decided to live like Francis and he took twelve young men to Rome with him, and the Pope gave him permission to start a new religious order, the Franciscans.\n\nFrancis had a vision in which he saw Jesus hanging on the cross and he was given the same wounds that Jesus had on his hands, his feet and his side. When Francis grew ill and weak he thanked God for the pain he was suffering. He died in 1226.\n\nSaint Francis of Assisi\n\nYear 1: Saint Faustina - Feast Day 5 October\n\nSaint Faustina was a Polish nun who saw Jesus and received messages from him. Jesus wanted her to tell the world that He is the Divine Mercy.\n\nSaint Faustina was born on the 28th of August 1905 in Poland and was baptised Helena Kowalska. She was the third of ten children. Her family lived on a farm. They were poor but very religious. At the age of seven Faustina thought God was calling her to be a nun. She went to school for three years when she was twelve years old and was always good to the poor.\n\nIn 1924 she was told by Jesus to leave for Warsaw and join a convent where she became a Sister of Our Lady of Mercy and was known as Sister Maria Faustina of the Blessed Sacrament. In the convent she worked in the kitchen and looked after the garden.\n\nOn the 22nd February 1931 Jesus Christ appeared to her. She wrote, 'In the evening I became aware of the Lord Jesus clothed in a white garment. One hand was raised in blessing. From his garment I saw two large rays, one red and the other pale blue. My soul was filled with joy. Jesus said to me, \"paint an image according to what you see, include the words, Jesus I trust in you.\"'\n\nSometime later, Jesus spoke to her again: \"The pale ray stands for water, the red ray stands for blood.\" She wrote that Jesus explained to her that God loves us all and He wants us to recognise His mercy and allow it to flow through us to others.\n\nSt Faustina died on the 5th October 1938 and was canonised on the 30th April 2000.\n\nSaint Faustina\n\nYear 2: Saint Bernadette - Feast Day 16 April\n\nBernadette was born in 1844 in Lourdes, in France.

Dominic went with a Bishop to southern France where many people were leaving the Church to follow a false teaching. Dominic decided to remain in France and devoted his life to preaching and leading people back to the Faith. He always slept on the floor and often walked barefoot however sharp the thorns or stones.\n\nIn 1208 Our Lady appeared to Dominic with a beautiful wreath of roses. She asked him to say the Rosary every day and to teach the people to pray the Rosary.\n\nDominic went to Rome and informed the Pope that he wanted to establish a religious order whose duties would include preaching and teaching. The new order was established in 1216 and was called the Order of Preachers; known today as the Dominicans. Dominic also founded an order of nuns to care for young girls.

Saint Agatha appeared in a vision to Lucy and at that point her mother was cured.\n\nA rich young man wanted to marry Lucy but because she had offered herself to God she refused. He was so angry at her refusal that he told the governor she was a Christian and she was led to the city for trial. She told the governor \"I will never sin, so that the Holy Spirit will give me a greater reward. You see now that I am the temple of the Holy Spirit, and that He protects me.\"\n\nThe governor ordered a fire to be lit around her, but Lucy was not harmed. At last, a sword was thrust into her heart. She did not die until a priest came to her with Holy Communion.

When he saw the miracles worked by Patrick, he said, \"Tell us about your God. He has given you great power.\" \"There is one God,\" answered Patrick, \"and three Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\" Picking up a green shamrock he said, \"Even as there are three leaves on this one stern, so there are three Persons in God.\" He was allowed to preach the new Faith everywhere in Ireland.\n\nSaint Patrick\n\nYear 5: Saint Catherine of Siena - Feast Day 29 April\n\nCatherine was the youngest of a very large family, she had twenty three brothers and sisters.\n\nAt the age of six she had a vision in Church in which Jesus appeared to her and blessed her.
