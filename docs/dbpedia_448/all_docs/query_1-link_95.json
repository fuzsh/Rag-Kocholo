        "text": "In the early morning hours of Sunday, August 4, 2024, Thomas M. Ede, age 72 of rural Cochrane, WI, suffered a cardiac event and a beautiful heart stopped beating.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about a life well lived…..\n\nGrowing On Up\n\nAfter being adopted by amazing parents, Tom enjoyed growing up on a farm in rural Mondovi, WI, helping with chores, raising pickles to buy a horse & often escaping on his bike to visit Grandma in town. Ready to pursue other opportunities, he joined Fiberite in Winona, MN, and later landed his dream job working for Dairyland Power Cooperative in Alma, WI, proudly serving in Operations for 38 years. Somewhere in between, he could be found on the drag strip at Amber Green racing his beloved powder blue VW bug.\n\nHappy Hunting\n\nSpending time fishing and hunting turkey, ducks & deer were some of his favorite “jobs”. Perhaps story-telling and consuming good food & beverages were more important. For many years, he gave back by chairing Alma-area banquets for The National Wild Turkey Federation, for which he was so proud.\n\nNear & dear were Red Wing pottery, Leo Smith Folk Art and collector duck decoys…. as well as a good pizza, cold Pepsi, peanuts and, of course, Beth’s baking. You’d also find an empty Twix, Butterfinger or Hersey with almonds wrapper abandoned by one of his two favorite recliners.\n\nMost Recently\n\nTime spent with his wife, family & friends included travel, most significantly to Alaska, winters on the Texas Coast & camping up north. In addition, local venues, country music festivals and concerts were among his favorites. Over the years, various boats, water craft & UTVs were experimented with. Breakfast & dinners out with family, friends & former co-workers were a highlight of his day.\n\nThe supportive love of family & friends allowed Tom to be Tom as cognitive and physical limitations became challenges overcome by a bit of extra attention or laughter.\n\nGift of Gab\n\nLet’s be clear, Tom was #1 in this area, thriving on talking with others whether known or unknown. Thinking he recognized someone, he’d walk away and return sometime later to announce he had no clue who it was, but had an interesting chat. For those that knew him and loved him, let’s say no more.\n\nFamily and Friends\n\nThey were everything to Tom. He so loved his family & circle of friends unconditionally. Um…. ok, maybe under some conditions that made us all just shake our heads at times. But that was Tom! He was so proud of his children and grandchildren.\n\nLeft to recall the good times are Tom’s wife of 27 years Beth; daughter Heather (Terry) & children Jacob, Joshua, Riley & Kaley Franz; sister Debbie (Steve) Constantine; niece Niki (Josh) & children Liam & Silas Anderson; nephew Jeremy (Tara) & children Sami & Dani Constantine; mother-in-law Mary Helmueller; brother-in law Ed Helmueller, along with his aunts Phyllis & Elaine, special cousins and beautiful & caring friends.\n\nThose who went before are Tom’s son Keith, parents Mary Jane & Gerald, sister Karen, father-in-law Anthony “Ed”, great nephew Miles, and several aunts, uncles & friends.\n\nA Life Remembered\n\nA memorial service will take place at 3pm on Friday, August 9, 2024 at the Alma Rod and Gun Club, S1562 County Rd I, Alma, WI with Burial to follow at Buffalo City Cemetery.\n\nTom’s family invites all to celebrate his life from 3:30 – 7pm at the Alma Rod and Gun Club. The family will join the celebration after the burial.\n\nMemorials can be directed to Scenic Valley EMS, Team Zach (a recovery fund for a local friend injured in a river accident) or Gundersen – St. Elizabeth Cardiac Rehab/Wellness Center."
