        "text": "A Biographical Sketch of St. Thomas More\n\nBorn near London into a wealthy middle-class family, St. Thomas More chose martyrdom rather than betray his conscience. Famous for being, in his words, “the King’s good servant but God’s first,” St. Thomas More was executed by the order of Henry VIII when he, as Lord Chancellor of England, refused to support the King in his break with the Church. Even without martyrdom, this brilliant statesman and witty writer would be remembered in secular society as the humanist who authored Utopia (1516). It must be noted that St. Thomas More himself had been responsible for the banning of heretical books and the imprisonment and execution of those accused of heretical beliefs; however, his Utopia presents religious tolerance as one component necessary for a just society. During his career St. Thomas More helped bring piety, order, and justice to civic life.\n\nAs a youth, he wrote bawdy poetry; as a statesman and lawyer, he was brilliant, pragmatic, and shrewd; as a father, he favored a well-rounded education for his daughters as well as for his son. He maintained that men and women “both have the same human nature, which reason differentiates from that of beasts; both therefore are equally suited for those studies by which reason is perfectioned.” [Interestingly, his attitude was in contrast to that of Henry VIII who, placing restrictions on Bible reading, declared women as a “lower sort”” who should be denied access to Scripture.] St. Thomas More was particularly close to his daughter Margaret, whom he called Meg. Among other things, he knew that she understood and respected his asceticism; from the Tower of London he wrote to her frankly about his faith.\n\nSt. Thomas More loved Greek literature, philosophy, mathematics, music, and art. He had a keen sense of humor and is said to have kept a clown in his house and a monkey in his garden. He made it possible for his children to study seriously and at the same time provided a joyful home environment and welcomed friends to join his family in songfests and games. A Renaissance man with progressive views that he did not find in contradiction with his loyalty to the one Church, he observed regular hours for prayer, praying from the heart. Upon being sentenced to death, St. Thomas More expressed his prayer that he and the King would meet in heaven like St. Stephen (the first Christian martyr) and St. Paul (who persecuted Christians including Stephen before his own conversion).\n\nA Prayer of Saint Thomas More\n\nGive us, good Lord,\n\na full faith, a firm hope, and a fervent charity.\n\nAnd, good Lord, give us warmth, delight, and\n\nquickness in thinking of you.\n\nAmen."
