From Ed Hanson

I was very interested to see these new marriage records, particularly in the one for William Strange of Shalston and Mary Tredwell of "Kertleton" [Kirtlington], marrying at Buckingham in 1737. This couple went on to live at Weston-on-the-Green, Oxfordshire, and became fairly prosperous farmers. This line continued through Kidlington, Yarnton, Chipping Norton, and there are descendants today at Ducklington. Has anyone been able to connect this William into the Shalston family?

From Heather Olsen There was a William Strange baptized in Shalstone in the 1710-15 timeframe the son of John and Mary Strange. This John and Mary had several other children baptized in Shalstone in this time period. I am not certain, however, that this William and the one married in Buckingham are one and the same. There seems to have been at least one other William who remained in Shalstone in the 1740s and 1750s.

Go to the Shalstone page, Buckinghamshire, for details of a family with connections here and in villages across Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire

Hambledon

From John Moore moorejo@reach.net

I recently visited England and talked with the present lockkeeper.

Subject: Hambledon Lock The following are extracts from The Thames Highway, vol. 2, 1920, by Fred S Thacker, published by David and Charles, Newton Abbot. Vol. 1, 1914, was republished with a new introduction in 1968. Access was provided in March 2003 by the current lockkeeper. "In 1854, Joseph Gould, after 32 years' service, was deprived of his monthly wage of 50s; and was allowed the pleasure tolls and free use of the lockhouse, on condition of continuing his duties. At the end of the following year he received Â£10 compensation for property left by him in the house; perhaps it helped to pay his passage to New Zealand.

"The lock was in 1865 in imminent danger of collapse

"No keeper is named after Gould's departure until Widow Sarah Strainge at 52s. monthly under the Conservancy in 1866. In November she received notice from the adjacent landowner to quit her house, but was protected by the Conservancy, the actual owners.

"In June 1868 Mrs. Strainge was ordered to Mapledurham; and in May 1870 I find J Lomax keeping. The lock was entirely rebuilt this year. Lomax died before March 1873; and Mrs. Lomax retained his office with official assistance. I have a shrewd suspicion that Mrs. Lomax is identical with the widow Strainge: the latter never turned up at Mapledurham. In May 1876 it was urged that the extensive weirs needed a man to manage them; and it was suggesed to send Mrs. Lomax to Shiplake; but the Conservators declined to move her. She had two grown sons to help her; "she was quite competent, she had done it when her husband was ill, and we kept her." The breakwater below the lock was built in June 1878. Next year complaints arose about the handling of the weir, and Chalmore Hole was suggested for the widow. Headquarters, however, entertained an inexplicable penchant for the lady; some more comfortable change was desired. In July 1881 she was still here; but constant complaint at last had its effect; and in September 1882 she was dismissed with three months' wages."

The lock fee in 1695 was 1/-; in 1771 3d per 5 tons of cargo; in 1821 9s 01/2d for 140 tons, with 3d per 5 tons proposed. The owner in 1846 was CS Murray, who charged 3d per 5 tons.

I followed this up with a message to the lockkeeper, including the following: Regarding the widow Strainge: 1. Here is what we knew about Thomas Strange and his wife before you so kindly showed us your book, The Thames Highway: Thomas Strange. Christened 21 Dec 1794, Turville. Lived at Medmenham, at least from 1816, when he married Mary at Ibstone 22 Feb. Occupations: Master shoemaker, employing 1 man and 2 women, Mar 1851; pound-lock keeper at time of death. Drowned at Mill End, Hambleden, Bucks, 8 Jan 1856; buried at Medmenham, 14 Jan 1856. The Bucks Advertiser of 19 January 1856 reported as follows:-

"An inquest was held at Mill End, Hambledon, near this town, on the 11th instant, before F. Charsley Esq., on the body of Thomas Strange, who had only been poundkeeper at the lock on the river Thames, opposite Mill End, for three weeks. The deceased, who was 60 years of age, in crossing the river from the Poundhouse to Mill End, to fetch his son-in-law, on the previous Tuesday evening, lost the command of the boat, owing, it is supposed, to the rapidity of the stream, and the boat was drawn over the lock and upset. The body of the deceased was not found until the following day, although search was made by several men with punts and lanterns. Verdict: 'Accidentally drowned.'" [I think it should have said 'over the weir'.]

Mary Strange, nÃ©e Robinson. Born 1794-6, Ibstone. Occupation: Shoe binder. Died 26 Sep 1854 of 'rheumatism' and old age and buried at Medmenham, 30 Sep 1854.

Discounting the possibility that the likeness of surnames is just a coincidence, this shows that either Thomas remarried between September 1854 and January 1856, or Sarah was not his widow. I have checked a partial listing of marriages for the period, and found two possibles in the last quarter of 1854 - a bit on the hasty side, especially as he had no children at home needing care. Of course, either one of them could have been his son, Thomas's.

2. On the question of whether Sarah Strainge and Mrs Lomax were one and the same, as Fred Thacker suspected: The 1861 census shows Sarah Strange, a widow aged 46 and born in Henley, as pound-keeper, living at the pound with a young woman companion. In 1871, there is a Sarah Strange, a widow aged 56 and born in Henley, unemployed and visiting in the household of a Samuel Lambourn, a pleasure boat proprietor living on the Henley Turnpike Road, Henley Bridge Foot, Remenham. In 1881 Sarah Strange, a pensioned widow aged 65 and born in Henley, is boarding in Aston Lane, Remenham with a family headed by Eliza Lambourne, another widow. Also in 1881 the Hambledon lock house was occupied as lock keeper by Martha Lomax, a widow aged 49 and born in Bray, and her four children, including two boys aged 16 and 18. Given her age, there may well have been older boys who had left home. Clearly, Thacker's suspicion was unfounded.

3. So what relation were Thomas and Sarah, if she was not his widow? Since she was born 1814-1816, it seems unlikely that she was his sister-in-law: his brothers were born in 1793 and 1800. For the same reason, it is possible, although it would be a bit unusual, that she was his daughter-in-law: his eldest son's wife was Elizabeth, and his other three were born in 1818, 1821 and 1823. Possible marriages were registered for all three to women named Sarah. Since it would cost rather a lot to get the five marriage certificates concerned, I think I'll pass on this one! There could, of course, be more than five possibles, as the listing I looked at is incomplete. Regards - John Moore

From Belinda Ireland-Johnston (belilindt(at)gmail(dot)com) Subject: Edith Ida Strange My great grandmother was Edith Ida Strange at the age of 22 (3 Richardson St, High Wycombe) married Hugh Henry LORD (66 West End Rd, High Wycombe) in High Wycombe Primitive Methodists Church, Westbourne St, High Wycombe in 1910. My grandmother, Majorie LORD (born in High Wycombe), in 1916. I believe Henry was in the military perhaps they were married before WWI. I believe Eddie was 16 when she married Henry, they and their 2 daughters emigrated to Australia around 1920 on board the Orient Steam Navigation Company ship RMS Orsova. I am unaware of any other relatives emigrating at this time and my Nana, Marjorie, often refers to all her cousins being in England except the one that moved to USA (Missouri?) to be with her daughter that married an American.

Marriages:

1786 Oct 21 Elizabeth Strange to Edward Beesley by Licence. He a widower. Both signed.

Ed Hanson posed the question in July 2006 - was this Elizabeth a daughter of Thomas Strange (1733-1818), one of the blacksmiths of Turville? That seems to be the only Strange family in the parish at the time. Other children in the same family were Mary (b&d 1761), Thomas (blacksmith, d 1845, age 81), possibly Anne (m William Fletcher, 1781), William (shoemaker), John (blacksmith), Alice, bp 1773 (possibly the witness to the 1786 Beesley marriage, although she'd only be 13 at the time), and then there's another Anne, bp 1777. Of these children only Mary, Alice, and Anne have identifiable baptismal records.

Witnesses signed: Thomas and Alice S.

A County Family - Turville &c&c

From: John Moore

Subject: STRANGE in the family tree of my wife Margaret. If someone can carry the line further back, I should be very happy, of course, but it would be good if this helped someone else out too. The way I number them, the people with Q numbers are the parents (or in-laws) of those in the R generation, and so on. The direct line is Q1/2 - R3/4 - S5/6 - T8/10. A secondary line runs S1/2 - T1/2 - U1-4.

"An inquest was held at Mill End, Hambledon, near this town, on the 11th instant, before F. Charsley Esq., on the body of Thomas Strange, who had only been poundkeeper at the lock on the river Thames, opposite Mill End, for three weeks. The deceased, who was 60 years of age, in crossing the river from the Poundhouse to Mill End, to fetch his son-in-law [T10], on the previous Tuesday evening, lost the command of the boat, owing, it is supposed, to the rapidity of the stream, and the boat was drawn over the lock and upset.
