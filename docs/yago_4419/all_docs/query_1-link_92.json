        "text": "Alan Carr has revealed he’s keen to sign up for Celebs Go Dating, months after his split from husband Paul Drayton.\n\nThe 45-year-old presenter announced in January that he and Paul had gone their separate ways after 13 years as a couple and three years of marriage.\n\nNow, the comedian has set his sights on the E4 dating series, saying: ‘I would do Celebs Go Dating. It’s my favourite show.’\n\nThe show sees celebs entertaining and impressing on blind dates, with expert dating tips given to them by Paul Carrick Brunson and Anna Williamson.\n\nHe made the comment on Michelle Visage’s Rule Breakers’ podcast, where he also shared that Paul was the first boyfriend he ever brought back to see his parents because he ‘loved him.’\n\nAlan added: ‘I had partners before, but my Paul is my first boyfriend that I brought home to see my mum and dad, because I loved him and I didn’t care if my mum and dad said “Get out”.\n\n‘It was worth doing that.’\n\nFollowing the couple’s split, Alan has since hired a personal trainer, and joked about wanting a revenge body.\n\nSpeaking to fitness guru guest Joe Wicks on Life’s a Beach podcast, Alan quipped: ‘I have just gone through a divorce so I told the trainer I want a revenge body.\n\n‘But I think he thought I said I wanted a blancmange body.’\n\nJoe then explained the mental health benefits that Alan will also experience from getting fit, saying: ‘Tap into the mental health benefits of exercise.\n\n‘If you wake up with energy, you’ve got the time to exercise, you’ll want to do it for your mind to feel less stress, especially when you are going through something emotional.’\n\nAlan and Paul’s separation was announced in January, with a statement revealing they were separating ‘jointly and amicably.’\n\nA statement released via PA read: ‘After 13 years as a couple and three years of marriage, Alan Carr and Paul Drayton would like to announce they are separating.\n\n‘They have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go their separate ways.\n\n‘We request that their privacy is respected at this sensitive time.’\n\nAlan and Paul wed in 2018, with Alan’s best friend, singer Adele, becoming ordained so she could marry the pair in an iconic ceremony.\n\nThe comedian previously shared on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show that not only did Adele marry the couple, but also footed the bill for the wedding costs in a lovely gesture.\n\nCelebs Go Dating is available to watch on All4.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Alan Carr’s estranged husband Paul Drayton speaks out after being freed from jail"
