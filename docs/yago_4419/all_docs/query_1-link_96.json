        "text": "This property had everything that we needed to have a full week stay. The fully stocked kitchen met all of our needs. The decor was great and fit our family well. We loved everything about our unit.\n\nThe staff was amazing. They went above and beyond all of our expectations. From even before we booked the property they were helping and answering questions to help us select the unit that fit our needs best. The entire process was easy and I cannot say enough good things about the staff.\n\nEverything was great and very nice. Only complaint I have was there was sand on the sheets of the twin beds that had not been slept in by any of us. I also wish there had been a hot tub.\n\nHad a seamless experience.\n\nIt was beautiful and very roomy.\n\nWe come to Navarre yearly for vacation. Shopping and dining mostly besides the beach.\n\nEveryone I interacted with was very friendly and helpful. I have been booking with them for years and have never had a problem.\n\nThe only complaint I had was the person above us was washing their balcony off every day and the water would come down onto our balcony so therefore we didn't get to enjoy it fully. But the staff told me that the condo above us was not managed by them so there really wasn't much they could do except report it to the homeowners association.\n\nGreat property and location on Navarre Beach, all condos that we have stayed in are beautiful and comfortable.\n\nBeautiful condo, very clean and roomy with everything you need. Comfortable bed, and great balcony to hang out and look at the ocean! Would definitely visit again!\n\nGreat staff to work with.\n\nThe Beach Colony has a beautiful pool, a nice workout room and beautiful views of the beach. It is also close to the pier.\n\nIt was very easy to book and to check in. The condo was nice and had all the amenities we needed.\n\nWe liked the layout of the condo. The view from all of the windows was spectacular! The furniture & beds were comfortable. It was nicely decorated & the appliances & kitchen had what what we needed to prepare our meals.\n\nOne of the maintenance guys was helpful in helping me remember the code to the fitness facility. Another maintenance worker came to fix a light in the condo, he wore a mask & was courteous & respectful.\n\nOn Saturday the man at the elevators was very personable.\n\nA house cleaner said that it was her pleasure to be of service.\n\nThe original condo we were going to stay in was damaged by the last storm that came thru we were given options of two equally nice places at the same price.\n\nVery comfortable nice view everything we wanted for a relaxing vacation.\n\nI really think there needs to be a bathroom at the pool. The thought that there isn't is really kind of disgusting. People are definitely urinating in that pool. And this is a true inconvenience for people with small children. They may not make it to the 9th floor before they go in their pants. And it's not always just urine.\n\nThe stay was wonderful, the weather was gorgeous (especially for November). We had a very relaxing enjoyable time.\n\nThis is the first time I've used your management services. I usually rent condos that are owned and managed by individuals. It was a very good experience for us.\n\nWe were very pleased with our stay. Our Unit was very nice, spacious, clean, and the Kitchen was well equiped. The views were gorgeous. Everything was exactly as described in the online information & pictures.\n\nNavarre team was very easy & friendly to work with. Happy to help in any way.\n\nOverall a good experience. I really enjoyed the coded door entry. Much easier than coordinating keys with 6 people in our unit. I would stay here again and may stay next summer. Pool and grilling area are nice. Elevators, entry area and covered parking are very convenient. It was easy for my teenagers to come and go and visit friends on a different floor.\n\nThey were polite and friendly. Easy to check in and apologetic when our unit wasn't ready before check in.\n\nThe condo is beautiful, very clean and well maintained. It is nicely decorated and the ocean view is out of this world. I loved the extra window overlooking the pier in the living room as well as the view from the windows in the master bedroom. I will certainly return to this property.\n\nWe will be back and will be requesting this same property again!\n\nEveryone I talked to was just great, especially the member who found me one more day to tack onto the end of our stay\n\n\"The weather was rainy but we have never been anywhere where they would not put out the beach chairs . I called twice and they would just say \" we are looking at it\" my elderly mom and her sisters lost theee days on the beach because of no chairs . It did rain but not storm so that was very disappointing. We paid a lot of money for the week ( we had two condos)and beach chairs were supposed to be available and they were not.\"\n\nREPLY FROM THE PROPERTY MANAGER: Unfortunately, the Beach Service is managed by a different company of which we have no control. We are very sorry for your inconvenience.\n\nFrom the time I picked up the phone and called Navarre Properties until the time I checked out it was the best experience I have had renting a vacation rental. The beach was stunning with beautiful clear emerald green waters. The condo was amazing with everything we needed and then some. We will definitely book with you again. It was so wonderful I sent you a thank you card.\n\nLike I said before. The lady that helped me book the condo was the best person I have EVER dealt with in customer service. The rest of the Navarre Properties crew was amazing. You have a top notch team. Everything was more than I could ask for in a vacation rental. Thanks to Navarre Properties I will never forget my 43rd birthday.\n\nIt was an incredible condo. Everything was beautiful and very comfortable. Peg leg Pete's in Pensacola is fabulous place to eat as well as McGuires in destin and short drive. Wish we had stayed longer and next time we will. Thanks for a wonderful time.\n\nIt was a great experience. I have no complaints"
