        "text": "One of the most significant discoveries in Shakespeare studies was made by Alan Keen on 22 June 1940 when he came across a copy of Halls Chronicle (1550) containing numerous handwritten annotations which correspond closely to the early history play, The Famous Victories Of Henry The Fifth, as demonstrated by Keen in 1954 in The Annotator, and by Seymour Pitcher in 1961 in The Case For Shakespeares Authorship Of The Famous Victories. For the annotations, see pp. , , , and .\n\nAmong the annotations is the name 'Edward', once written (see image below), and once pricked out with a pin.\n\nSurviving copies of Oxfords correspondence are in an italic hand. However, features of the secretary hand in Halls Chronicle strongly resemble Oxfords italic hand, and it seems likely that a comparison of the two hands by handwriting experts would demonstrate that Oxford wrote the annotations in Keens copy of Halls Chronicle.\n\nAlan Keen left the annotated Hall's Chronicle as security for loans totalling Â£15,000 to Tudor Players (Rufford) Ltd., incorporated as a private limited company, Number 00489559, under a memorandum of association dated 18 December 1950, and dissolved 17 May 1973. In 1968, three trustees for Tudor Players (Rufford) Ltd., Roger Fleetwood Hesketh, Cuthbert Fleetwood Hesketh, and John Anthony Sanderson Hall, placed the annotated Halls Chronicle on loan with the British Library, where for four decades it was catalogued in the Manuscripts Reading Room as Loan 61. In 2007 it was withdrawn from the British Library by Lady Hesketh as 'sole surviving trustee' 'of the Settlements that are the owners of this book', and placed at Lancaster University. It was withdrawn from Lancaster University in 2010, and since then has been in the possession of Lord and Lady Hesketh as trustee for Tudor Players (Rufford). The volume is now at Eton College, Windsor. A microfilm copy (Micro. 146176) is available at the British Library.\n\nA modern spelling version of the annotations and a detailed discussion of the provenance of Alan Keens copy of Halls Chronicle are available in issues 32, 33, 34, 39 and 56 of the Edward De Vere Newsletter on this website.\n\nBelow are images of the name 'Edward' and of the signatures of Sir Richard Newport in the annotated Hall's Chronicle, as well as transcripts of the wills of Sir Richard Newport and others, and a pedigree chart showing the relationships between the Newport, Corbet, Bromley, Trentham and Sneyd families and the Earls of Oxford.\n\nDOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE ANNOTATED COPY OF HALL'S CHRONICLE"
