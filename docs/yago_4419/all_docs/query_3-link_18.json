        "text": "AN MP from one of North Wales’ most active political families is on the brink of having her home seized by a council after leaving it empty for months.\n\nFlintshire-born Ann Keen and her husband Alan, who is also an MP, were told their west London property, which is partly boarded up, will be filled with council tenants if they continue to leave it unoccupied.\n\nThe couple, dubbed Mr and Mrs expenses, have claimed almost £40,000 a year on a London riverside flat they say is their second home, according to leaked information.\n\nThey designated their empty property, just 10-miles away, as their main home.\n\nCommons rules state an MP’s second home should be where they spend fewer nights.\n\nHounslow Council confirmed it had written to the couple giving them one month to explain how they intend to bring the Brentford property back into occupation.\n\nUnder current legislation, if the council is not happy with the response it can take action using empty dwelling management orders to put other people in the home.\n\nA council spokesman said: “We have contacted the Keens with regard to their property.\n\n“As with all such cases, they have one month to respond.”\n\nMrs Keen was born in Buckley in November 1948 and went to Ewloe Green County primary.\n\nShe failed her 11+ and went on to Elfed Secondary Modern in then Clwyd.\n\nFather John Lloyd Fox, a Shotton steelworker, and mother Ruby were active political campaigners and their home was opened up for party meeting and election campaigning. Mr Lloyd Fox went on to become a local Labour councillor.\n\nMrs Keen joined anti-nuclear group CND at 14 and the Labour party two years later and went on to work as a nurse.\n\nShe tried for selection as a candidate in Delyn but failed and was later selected in her current seat of Brentford.\n\nIn 1997 she was elected to parliament, the same year her sister Sylvia Heal also became an MP.\n\nBut Mrs Keen, a junior health minister, said it was “categorically untrue” to say their home was an “empty dwelling”.\n\n“It is currently in the process of being substantially renovated, entirely at our own expense,” she said in a statement.\n\n“The property is not subject to an empty dwelling management order.\n\n“The letter we have received from the London Borough of Hounslow is clear that owners undertaking renovation work on their homes are not under threat of repossession.\n\n“Our representatives are in the process of speaking to Hounslow with the details of our renovation work.\n\n“As soon as this work is completed, we will be back living at home in Brentford, where we have lived for the past 22 years.”"
