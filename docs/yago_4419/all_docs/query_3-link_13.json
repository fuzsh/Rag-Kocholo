        "text": "The details of the attacks – two carried out by arsonists and one which saw a brick hurled through the window – emerged in the same week it was revealed the MP had claimed £12,000 in expenses for an office at her home, despite having three other official workplaces.\n\nMrs Keen’s constituency office, in Chiswick High Road, was used by the Community and District Nursing Association (CDNA) until shortly after the last protest attack in September, which involved a brick with a message tied to it being thrown through a window.\n\nCDNA employee Lee Attwood said the message writer used “absolutely disgusting” and “violent” language to criticise the organisation’s links with the Health Minister, who was general secretary of the CDNA.\n\nHe said: “You would not be able to print it “It was very aggressive and very disturbing.\n\n“All I can say to you was that Ann Keen’s name was on the message.”\n\nOne newspaper report claimed part of it read: “You are supporters of Ann Keen, you should be ashamed of yourselves.”\n\nA police spokesman said they had no record of this incident, but confirmed the building had also been targeted in two arson attacks, which left scorch marks on the entrance door in June.\n\nHe said no one had been arrested for any of the attacks, but officers were aware they had been carried out at a time when there was much anger over MPs’ expenses.\n\nThe Hounslow and Brentford Times has made repeated requests to speak to Mrs Keen, but the former nurse has refused to break her silence over her expenses claims or the arson attacks.\n\nEarlier this week it was revealed that the Brentford and Isleworth MP received monthly cash payments of £250 to fund an office at home for at least four years.\n\nHer husband, Alan Keen MP, also regularly received similar payments, but it is not known whether the couple were claiming for the same office in their constituency home.\n\nMrs Keen, who unlike her husband has not had to submit itemised receipts, has three other offices – her constituency base, one in Parliament and an office at the Department of Health.\n\nMrs Keen’s office payments were discovered after a Freedom of Information request by the Sunday Times, about direct funding to a minority of MPs.\n\nIt is still unknown whether Mrs Keen’s home office funding has continued since last year."
