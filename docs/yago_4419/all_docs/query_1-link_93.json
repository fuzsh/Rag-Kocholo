My name is Lilyan Toma, and despite being only 19 years old, I am already a senior at Wayne State University. I am currently in an accelerated program where I am pursuing both my bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and a master's in AI Algorithms and Systems. I am on track to graduate in December 2025. I am thrilled to share that I am a #FordIntern with the Cyber Security - Red Team, serving as a Social Media Ambassador. I will be focusing on ethical hacking and learning how to prevent cyber threats by staying ahead of the bad guys! I have thoroughly enjoyed participating in various intern events and meeting wonderful people, two of which are Bill Ford and Jim Farley! One standout experience was attending a Tigers Game, where I had the opportunity to connect with fellow FCGs and interns on a personal level. To top it off, we witnessed an exciting victory for the Tigers - WHOO HOO! Join me on this #InternTuesday as I take the @FordCareers Instagram stories for ride during a #DayintheLife as a Ford Intern.\n\nLynn Conway, transgender activist and scientist, has died. January 2, 1938 ‚Äì June 9, 2024 Lynn Ann Conway was an electrical engineer, computer scientist, and an activist on behalf of transgender people. She died in Jackson, Michigan on Sunday, June 9, 2024 of heart trouble. Lynn was born in Mount Vernon, New York on January 2, 1938. She was a reserved but exceptionally bright student who attended MIT but did not graduate due a difficult and ultimately unsuccessful gender transition. She continuing her education at Columbia University, where she earned B.S. and M.S.E.E. degrees in 1962 and 1963, respectively. In 1994, she accepted a position as a researcher at IBM‚Äôs facility in Yorktown Heights, New York. There, she worked with others on an advanced supercomputer project. She was fired in 1968 when it became known that she intended to transition. IBM later apologized for that action. That same year, Lynn consulted Dr. Harry Benjamin and became a patient. She completed her gender transition, also in 1968. In a divorce, she was denied the right to visit with her minor children. Using her new name, Lynn continued work as a computer research scientist, working at Computer Applications, Inc., Memorex, and, Xerox PARC, and DARPA. In 1985, she became a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan and, simultaneously, Associate Dean of Engineering. Lynn‚Äôs post-transition accomplishments were foundational in the develop of computers, but her pre-transition work was not credited to her until 1998, when a researcher who was examining IBM‚Äôs three decades old supercomputer project discovered that a scientist he had been unable to identity had become known as Lynn Conway. For Lynn, this resulted in a difficult decision to come out as transgender. She has since been hailed not only for her myriad post-transition accomplishments, but for her earlier work. She is famous for, among many other things, launching the Mead-Conway VLSI chip design revolution. Lynn was well-known in transgender circles for her accomplishments and for her website, on which she told her personal story and worked to advance the rights of transgender people. She is perhaps best known in this regard for her criticism of Ray Blanchard‚Äôs theory of autogynephilia and a failed lawsuit, with Dierdre McCloskey, against J. Michael Bailey author of The Man Who Would be Queen. In 2002, Lynn married her long-time boyfriend Charles Rogers. They lived on a 24-acre wooded property in rural Michigan. Thank you so much Lynn.
