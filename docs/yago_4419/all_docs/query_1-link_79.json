        "text": "I just learned of the passing of an icon in the Capped Bust half collector family. Stu Keen passed quietly in late September (obituary below). Stu was a good guy. He was a patient dealer and cared greatly about helping collectors find the coins they needed. Although I was a customer of his for many years, I only met him once. I was giving a presentation on collecting Capped Bust halves at the ANA Annual Meeting in 2005 (or so) and Stu was in the front row ... eager and enthusiastic. It was a treat to finally meet him after so many years. Recently he slowed as a dealer and I missed seeing his fixed price lists. I will miss him.\n\nStuart (Stu) Alan Keen, born November 3, 1925 in Los Angeles to Charles Edward Keen and Ina (Elwess) Keen, passed away peacefully at home after a short illness on September 20, 2016.\n\nStu grew up in San Marino, attending South Pasadena High School. He joined the Air Force upon graduation. He attended Arizona State University and the University of Southern California, and remained a Trojan football fan.\n\nHe met his wife, Inger-Jane Wacher, in Trona CA where they both worked for American Potash and Chemical Company. They were married in 1949, moved to South Pasadena and later to Pasadena where Stu lived for 65 years. He was one of the last remaining members of the South Marengo Property Owners Association, which he founded.\n\nStu began his successful career as an insurance broker with Olympic Insurance. He then flourished with Johnson & Higgins for 35 years. As a Senior Vice President he handled the Teledyne and Atlantic Richfield accounts.\n\nStu was most proud of his private coin business \"Coinsak\" where he specialized in buying and selling half dollar busts. He found pleasure in the interactions with his long time customers. He traveled to Matzatlan twice a year where he enjoyed deep sea fishing, golf and margaritas. Stu was an avid golfer, and later as his life slowed down he continued with weekly breakfasts with his golfing partners.\n\nHis wife passed away in 2012. He is survived by his daughter Lise Keen, his son Darby Keen, grandchildren Katy, Palmer, Dennis, Carly Keen, and Joanna (Keen) Schneider, sister Elizabeth Keen, nieces Michele Docherty and Carrie Bond, and dog Benny. He was a good provider to his family and will be missed by them, friends and neighbors."
