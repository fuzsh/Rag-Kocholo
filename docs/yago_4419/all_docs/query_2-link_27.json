        "text": "About The Garden\n\nIn 2013, the First Ladies Garden was approved by the Harding Board of Trustees as a tribute to Leah Burks and to the other four women who graciously served the University in the capacity of first lady. There are five distinctive gardens reflecting their favorite plants and their love for gardening.\n\nIn every family, there is a \"first lady,\" a woman who sacrificed so her children could have a Christian education at Harding. This garden is full of tributes to mothers, grandmothers, mothers-in-law and Women for Harding.\n\nAdditionally, the Walls of Honor recognize parents, grandparents, grandchildren and graduates. You can add your loved one to the Walls of Honor while supporting Christian education at Harding. The garden provides a green space where people can reflect on the stories of ordinary people who have done extraordinary things to honor God and their families.\n\nThe Neale and Treva Pryor Legacy Walk, named for two of Harding’s most beloved icons, is a brick corridor connecting the front of campus to Legacy Park.\n\nThe second phase of the project brought the additions of an outdoor classroom, a secret garden and a courtyard with tables for chess and checkers. We invite you to relax, read the stories and enjoy the beauty of God's flowers in this peaceful setting.\n\nNeale and Treva Pryor Legacy Walk\n\nThe love and legacy of Neale Pryor (’56) and Treva Terrell (’86) began when he preached for the Oak Grove congregation in northwest Tennessee.\n\nAn older friend from Mayfield, Kentucky, Neale’s hometown, who was visiting Oak Grove, noticed a very attractive young lady and asked the young preacher an important question, “Why don’t you date Treva?” Neale’s response was, “I don’t date girls where I preach.” His friend replied, “It would be easier to find another preaching place than to find another girl like her.” Neale soon reconsidered. Since Treva was then living in Fulton, Tennessee, he would pick her up on the way to church. In 1960, they were married and returned to Harding in 1962 for Neale to teach Bible.\n\nThe Pryors are well known for their service and dedication to Harding University and Harding Academy. Neale served the University for 45 years as a Bible teacher, chairman of the Bible department, director of the annual Lectureship and vice president for academic affairs. He received the Distinguished Teacher Award three times and preached approximately 500 gospel meetings in more than 40 states and several foreign countries.\n\nHe also officiated many marriage ceremonies and preached numerous funerals, including his son's, Alan Neale, who preceded him in death. He was blessed with the ability to remember everything he read and could make each person feel special by remembering his or her name. After raising their children, Alan (’84) and Lori (’86), Treva earned her bachelor’s degree and taught at Harding Academy for 17 years.\n\nIn 2002, Pryor Hall was dedicated to them for their commitment to Christian education. In 2003, they received the Distinguished Alumni Award. In their 51 years of marriage, Treva was always by Neale’s side, supporting, encouraging and caring for him until his death in 2011. She is an exemplary role model as a wife, mother, grandmother and teacher. The Pryors’ legacy continues in the lives of their family, a countless number of Harding students and alumni and the body of Christ."
