        "text": "Ms Faulds Wood revealed she wanted to stand as an Independent against either Ann or Alan Keen, because she believed “they have brought discredit on to what should be an honourable profession”.\n\nBut she ruled out her husband, GMTV presenter John Stapleton, also becoming a candidate to help her take on the couple.\n\nMs Faulds Wood, chairwoman of the European Cancer Patient Commission, told the Hounslow and Brentford Times: “I think unfortunately our MPs are held in very low esteem when they ought to be held in very high esteem.\n\n“I’m just surprised how many MPs have got double standards.\n\n“I wouldn’t dream of having a second home in central London when I live in Twickenham – and they live in Brentford.”\n\nThe broadcaster said she believed it was “ridiculous” Mr Keen, who sits on a Parliamentary inquiry into the future of local media, said he did not buy newspapers, and called for him to stand down from the committee.\n\nShe said: “An MP is a servant of the people and the local media is an important part of the community.”\n\nShe insisted she had no political affiliations but did not want to stand in Twickenham because MP Vince Cable was a “shining example” for politicians.\n\nShe said: “An MP should be getting down to the grass roots, knowing what people think and be accountable to the people.\n\n“I’ve nothing against Ann Keen [Health Minister], I’ve tried to meet her for a cancer campaign and have been turned down at the last minute.\n\n“Two meetings have not happened, and that’s saddening because I think I’m quite well known and have been the chairwoman of the European Cancer Patient Commission for the last few years.”\n\nShe said the expenses scandal was “everything to do with” her considering to stand as a candidate, and she would not stand in Brentford and Isleworth or Feltham and Heston if the Keens stood down.\n\nWhat do you think about Ms Faulds Wood standing as a candidate?
