        "text": "Published\n\n22 November 2011\n\nThe funeral of Labour MP and former Middlesbrough football scout Alan Keen has taken place.\n\nMr Keen, originally from Redcar, died aged 73 earlier this month after what former prime minister Gordon Brown called a \"heroic fight\" against cancer.\n\nHe worked as a scout for Middlesbrough FC for 18 years before moving into politics and since 1992 represented Feltham and Heston in West London.\n\nA service was held at Teesside crematorium in Middlesbrough.\n\nMr Keen is survived by his wife Ann, two sons and a daughter.\n\nAs well as being chairman of the all-party football group, he was also chairman of the equivalent athletics group and a member of the Commons Culture, Media and Sports Committee.\n\nHis time as a football scout included the period when Jackie Charlton was Middlesbrough manager, and he claimed part of the credit for bringing Graeme Souness to the club.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nMiddlesbrough FC\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."
