        "text": "The Sport and Recreation Alliance mourns the passing of Alan Keen MP, after he lost his brave battle against cancer, aged 73.\n\nAlan was one of Westminster’s most consistent and effective advocates for sport. A keen football fan, Alan was a part-time tactical scout for Middlesborough Football Club for eighteen years before becoming an MP. He went on to chair the All Party Parliamentary Group for Football, leading the widely praised inquiry into the financial state of the sport.\n\nBut Alan’s interest in sport extended far beyond football - as vice-chair of the All-Party Group for Sport he worked with a range of organisations to stimulate a valuable dialogue between sports organisations and policymakers, and through his chairmanship of the Athletics Group he mobilised support for a lasting London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic legacy. He was also a keen cricketer, serving as secretary for the Lord’s and Commons cricket team.\n\nHis enthusiasm for all things sporting was matched by the considerable expertise he built up over his fourteen years as a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.\n\nOriginally from the north-east of England, Alan served as Member of Parliament for the London constituency of Feltham and Heston from 1992, building a reputation as an excellent constituency MP.\n\nAlan is survived by his wife of 31 years, Ann, and their three children, and we send our condolences and best wishes to them."
