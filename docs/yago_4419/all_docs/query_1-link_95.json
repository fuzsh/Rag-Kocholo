Email me at mpitkin(at)live.com if you’d like a report with sources.\n\nI am confident that this portion of my Keen family genealogy is correct. I’m still trying to prove parents of this first William Keen.

Her son, Henry Collett Bryant was bp 1 Dec 1799. There was only the one Sarah Bryant born about the right time in Broughton Gifford.

On her marriage record in 1849, her father is listed as William, but not listed as “deceased”.\n\nIn 1861, the family lived in St. Mary, Newington, Surrey\n\nIn 1871 the family lived in Kennington, Lambeth, London. Their married daughter and her children lived with them.\n\nIn 1881, Emma, John and Emma’s daughter and grandchildren lived in Kennington, Lambeth, London. John Wilkinson was a “leather seller”.\n\nIn 1891, John was a widower. He lived in Newington, London with adopted daughter, Emma Keen Poole and her children Henry and William.

Poole, age 4, lived with the family.\n\nIn 1911 Emma was age 67, a widow, living in Lewisham, London with her daughter, Marie Louise, age 45, single and son William Johnson Poole, age 41, widower. William’s son, Douglas Henry William Poole, age 14, lived with the family.\n\nDorothy “Dora” Long3 Keen (William2, William1), b. 1825 in Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire, England, baptized 23 Jan 1825 in Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire, England, d. 22 Mar 1906 in Atlanta, Georgia, buried in Evergreen Cemetery, New Haven, New Haven, CT, resided in New Haven, New Haven, CT.\n\nDorothy Long Keen was baptized 23 Jan 1825 in Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire, England.

She had a sister, Emma, age 18. Dora named daughters Sarah and Emma. Dora’s sister, Sarah Keen, age 23, was working as a laundress nearby in Camberwell. Dorothy and her mother lived on Artichoke Row. Sarah was working on Artichoke Place. None of the Keens were born in Surrey.\n\nIt seems as if Dora should still have been in England in 1851, however, I can’t find her or her sisters.\n\nDora boarded the ship named “London” in the city of London. She arrived in US on 16 Sep 1852 . She was age 25 and was not traveling with other family members.\n\nIn 1851 City Directories there was a Miss Ann Keen boarding at Webster west of Ashmun in New Haven. She was not listed in 1853. Dora was never listed in City Directories prior to her marriage.\n\nShe married Richard Harrison Wardell, 4 May 1853 in New Haven, Ct by Rev. J.G. Smith, b. 15 Nov 1827 in Fulstow, Lincolnshire, England (son of Richard Harrison Wardell and Elizabeth Richardson), baptized 25 Nov 1827 in Fulstow, Lincolnshire, England, d. 24 Jan 1901 in East Haven, New Haven, CT, buried in Evergreen Cemetery, New Haven, New Haven, CT, resided 992 State St. in New Haven, New Haven, CT, occupation Locksmith.\n\nIn her daughter’s birth record in 1858 she is listed as “Maria”, however, that is the only record listing that name.\n\nIn 1855, Richard, Dora and family lived at 138 Grand St. New Haven, CT.\n\nIn 1858 the family lived on Hamilton St, in New Haven, CT.\n\nIn 1860 the family lived at 192 Wallace.\n\nRichard was naturalized on March 15, 1861in New Haven, CT. He was 33 years old.\n\nIn 1862, family lived at 294 Wallace St. New Haven, CT.\n\nIn 1880, the family lived at 992 State St. Richard owned two dwellings on this lot at the corner of State and Edward. They were left to his wife upon his death. There is now a small commercial building on that lot.\n\nAt the time of daughter, Sadie’s, wedding in 1879, the family is listed as living at “corner of State and Edward”.\n\nIn 1883, Richard and Dora, as well as son, Richard, were listed as owning property on Edwards St. They were compensated for land taken to install a sewer.\n\nIn Feb 1899, there were two articles in the New Haven Register stating that Richard H. Wardell of East Haven fell and broke his hip when he slipped on the ice. A later article said that he was recuperating from a fall on the ice 3 weeks earlier. It said that he didn’t break his hip as first thought and would recover, although he would not be able to walk for a while.\n\nIn 1900, Richard and Dora were living with daughter Ann and her husband in East Haven.\n\nGreat Granddaughter, Doris Wardell, says that Richard was Vice President of the Elevator Co. City directories and census have him as locksmith. His sons worked for the Morse Elevator Works and Otis Elevator Co.\n\nDora died at the home of her daughter and son in law Allan Renfrew, in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHer death record and obituary list her name as “Dorothy L. Wardell”. That matches with her baptism name.\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Anna Sophia4 Wardell b. 25 Mar 1854 in New Haven, New Haven, CT, d. 5 Mar 1944 in New Haven, New Haven, CT, buried in Evergreen Cemetery, New Haven, New Haven, CT, resided in New Haven, New Haven, CT.\n\nMarriage record lists her as “Anna Sophia” and passport application lists her name as Anna S.\n\nA Baldwin Family lived next door to Wardells in 1870. Anna lived with friends on High St. after her husband’s death.\n\nAnna never had any children.\n\nIn 1900, Anna’s parents, Richard and Dora (Dorothy) lived with Anna and Charles on High Street in East Haven, CT.\n\nIn 1930, Anna was living on her own in East Haven, CT.\n\nIn 1940, Anna was living in the St. Paul’s Church Home in New Haven, CT.\n\nShe married Charles F. Baldwin, 3 May 1876 in St. Thomas’, New Haven, New Haven, CT, b. 2 Mar 1855 in New Britain, Hartford, Connecticut, d. c. 1926 in Cuba, resided High St. in East Haven, CT, occupation Moulder, Chicken Farmer.\n\nIn 1899, the couple lived at Height St in East Haven\n\nIn 1900, Charles was listed as a “Moulder”. He and Anna lived in East Haven, Anna’s parents lived with them.\n\nCharles registered with the American consulate in Havana, Cuba in 1914. The document says that he left the US on 24 Nov 1909 and arrived in Santa Barbara Heights on 20 Nov 1909 where “he is now residing for the purpose of farming”.\n\nIn 1910 Charles is listed in the US Census, a “Poultry man” in East Haven. I don’t know if he was home for a short time or Anna just listed him as head of household even though he was already in Cuba.\n\nDuring the first government of American intervention, several ambitious citizens of the United States bought large tracts of territory in the Isle of Pines, whose owners considered them of so little value that they parted with them at prices varying from 75¢ to $1.25 per acre. These properties were immediately divided up into small farms, varying from five to forty acres, and placed on the market in the United States. With glowing descriptions of the country they were sold at prices gradually increased from $15 to $50 and even $75 an acre.\n\nIn view of the beautiful printed matter so widely distributed, and the values which fertile farming lands in the United States had acquired in recent years, these prices apparently did not seem exorbitant, especially to men of means, who during the greater part of their experiences had fought out the struggle of life in the cold northwest. Many Americans were thus induced to come and settle in the Isle of Pines, with the hope, if not of amassing a fortune as pictured in the alluring terms of the propaganda, at least of securing a competence for their declining years.\n\nThe cyclone of October, 1917, destroyed all the fruit of the Isle of Pines and practically ruined the citrus groves, greatly discouraging the people who had devoted so many years of time and toil to their care and development.\n\nI assume that the cyclone of 1917 allowed Charles to get a good deal on one of the plantations. In 1920, they sold chicken farm and purchased Citrus plantation at Santa Barbar Heights, Isle of Pines, Cuba. Sadly, that plantation was wiped out by hurricane on Isle of Pines after death of Charles. I assume it was the storm on October 20, 1926 that crossed over Isle of Pines and Havana with maximum winds of 230-250 KMS /H. It left 600 deaths and classified as the most expensive of the Cuban history by the fact that losses reached to 300 millions of dollars.\n\nCharles died of gangrene in Cuba.\n\nii. Charles Henry Wardell b. 20 Nov 1855 in New Haven, New Haven, CT, d. 2 Dec 1931 in Cleveland, Cuyahoga, Ohio, buried 5 Dec 1931 in Highland Park Cemetery, resided 58 Fountain St. in New Haven, CT, occupation Worker-Brass Factory,Agent, Machinist,Mgr Morse Elev.

There is now an apartment building on that lot.\n\nAt time of son Charles’ birth, Charles Sr was listed as “mercantile agent”.\n\nIn 1899, the New Haven Register reported a story about a bet between Judge Hobart Hotchkiss and Charles Wardell. The bet was that Judge Hotchkiss couldn’t shoot a deer on a shooting trip the two took to Maine. He won and Charles had to supply an Oyster Roast at a large dinner held by Hotchkiss.\n\nCharles was active in the New Haven Athletic Association and Young Republicans Club.\n\nCharles was a representative for Morse, Williams & Co of Philadelphia.
