        "text": "For years they fought to keep details of their expenses claims out of the public view.\n\nYet now politicians have been accused of attempting a further \"cover-up\" by trying to delete references to their expenses from Wikipedia, the user-edited online encyclopedia.\n\nAn investigation has uncovered at least 10 cases in which MPs' biographical pages on Wikipedia were altered to remove information about their expenses which had been added by members of the public after it was revealed by the Telegraph.\n\nMPs whose entries were \"cleansed\" include Chris Grayling, the senior Conservative who is set to become Home Secretary if his party forms the next government.\n\nAn analysis of the website's records reveals that in each case, the change was made by someone working either within the parliamentary estate, or in a party office, or by a user who appeared to have links to one of the MPs involved.\n\nThe records do not show whether the changes were made by the MPs themselves, their staff, or others.\n\nIn some cases the ploy worked and the current version of the online biography makes no mention of expenses. In other cases, the details were reinstated and the people who tried to delete them were reprimanded by the website's managers.\n\nLast night, critics claimed that the underhand tactic showed that some politicians \"still haven't accepted the principle that the public have a right to know all of this information\".\n\nWikipedia's own rules of conduct discourage editing by individuals with a \"conflict of interest\" - which would include the MPs themselves, their staff and family members.\n\nAn assertion that he used taxpayers' money to renovate a flat in London despite owning three properties within the M25 and living less than 25 miles from Parliament was deleted from the website, even though it had been supported by references to Telegraph news reports.\n\nAfter the deletion was detected, a Wikipedia administrator sent a warning to the IP address about the removal of the material. Eventually the information was allowed to remain on the page.\n\nDetails that were removed included the fact that she claimed far more in expenses than a neighbouring MP, an account of a complaint into taxpayer-funded mailings sent by her office, and details of a Spanish court ruling.\n\nThe alterations were made from a parliamentary computer, prompting a Wikipedia warning.\n\nJoan Ryan, the Labour MP for Enfield North until she lost her seat last week, had her page changed seven times between May 2009 and March 2010 from a parliamentary computer.\n\nDetails that were deleted included claims that she was \"flipping\" her second home and had claimed £1 million in expenses since 2001.\n\nThere are currently no details of her expenses claims on her Wikipedia page.\n\nThe pages of Ann Keen and Alan Keen, the married couple who were both Labour MPs until she lost her seat last week, were changed by a Wikipedia user using the username \"Alankeenmp\".\n\nOn May 28, 2008, both \"Alankeenmp\" and a second, unnamed user from a parliamentary address, deleted details on Ann Keen's page of how the couple – who have been described as \"Mr and Mrs Expenses\" – used £175,000 of taxpayers' money to buy an apartment and took out life insurance policies worth £430,000.\n\nAlan Keen's page also had details removed on the same day, also by \"Alankeenmp\".\n\n\"Alankeenmp\" has not contributed to Wikipedia since that day, but last year was sent a warning by the website that \"if you have a close connection to some of the people, places or things you have written about in the article Alan Keen, you may have a conflict of interest\".\n\nDetails of expenses claims made by Angela Smith, the Labour MP for the Sheffield seat of Penistone & Stocksbridge, were deleted from her account by a Wikipedia user called \"Mpsheff\".\n\nThese included her claims for four beds for her one-bedroom London flat and for accountancy services provided by the husband of a fellow Sheffield MP.\n\nThe web page was first censored on July 14, 2009. The details were reposted and removed a further five times before \"Mpsheff\" was barred by Wikipedia for \"disruptive edits\", first for 24 hours and later then for 72 hours.\n\n\"Mpsheff\" – who also added personal details about Mrs Smith's family and trade union membership to the web entry – has not edited a Wikipedia page since.\n\nAnother Wikipedia user who has only ever edited one entry goes by the username \"Ice run wild\". The user's sole contributions have been to the page of Dari Taylor, the Labour MP who lost her Stockton South seat last week.\n\nOn August 17 last year, the user deleted information about Mrs Taylor's misuse of House of Commons stationary and the fact that she claimed £18,100 for food over four years, the maximum possible.\n\nThe user wrote that the changes were \"on Dari's request\". After \"Ice run wild\" was warned against \"vandalism\" of Wikipedia and told that \"the subject's desire to remove unflattering material is not reason to continue deleting it\", the user made no more changes.\n\nMrs Taylor told this newspaper last night that she could not remember asking any member of her staff to make the changes, but added that she may have asked for \"clarifications to incorrect information\" to be made.\n\nIn November last year a parliamentary user of Wikipedia deleted entries about Christopher Fraser, who stood down last week as the Conservative MP for South West Norfolk.\n\nLast October, accusations regarding Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the Conservative MP for Kensington, were removed by a user in parliament.\n\nIn July 2009 changes were made from inside parliament to the page of Ian Taylor, the Tory who stood down from Esher and Walton after a row about his expenses.\n\nAn IP address registered to the Stevenage Labour party was responsible for changes to the page of Barbara Follett, the former Labour MP for Stevenage.\n\nDetails of a £1,600 claim for window cleaning of her London flat were removed in December 2008 with the explanation \"expenses controversy\". The data was later added again and a warning was sent to the address.\n\nMatthew Elliott, the chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: \"It's appalling but sadly not surprising that there have been attempts to cover-up dodgy expenses claims. Politicians' commitment to secrecy is well-known."
