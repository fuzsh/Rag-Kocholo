        "text": "It is with profound sadness the family of Sherry Ann Keen announces her premature death on February 22, 2008, with her family by her side, after a courageous 3½ year battle with cancer. She was born and raised in Tribune, Saskatchewan and attended school in Tribune and Oungre. Sherry went on to receive her Recreational Technology degree at SIAST Institute in Saskatoon. Sherry met her soul mate Michael Keen while visiting relatives in Mankota. Mike and Sherry were married on July 29, 1978 and had the loves of their lives, Tamara in 1979 and Brittina in 1981. Mike and Sherry farmed in Mankota until 2001 when they moved to Moose Jaw. Sherry enjoyed working as a Recreation Activities Director at Mankota Hospital and Extendicare in Moose Jaw. Sherry loved the residents that she so compassionately and gently cared for – they meant so much to her. Sherry had numerous hobbies including flower gardening, playing guitar, sewing, crocheting and she had a passion for dolphins. Her biggest joy in life was spoiling her two beautiful granddaughters Morgan and Madisyn. It didn’t matter how poorly she was feeling, she always found the energy to spend time with her “little angels”. They were her world. She is survived by her loving husband of 29 years, Michael; daughter Tamara and special son-in-law Norm Ferraton (Morgan and Madisyn); daughter Brittina and her special friend, Justin. Sherry is also survived by her mother, Reggie Frank of Kenosee and brothers Blaine (Debbie) Frank of Weyburn, Barry (Giselle) Frank of Saskatoon, Cory (Nella) Frank of Winnipeg; brothers-in-law Edward (Elsie) Keen of Moose Jaw; and Joseph (Karen) Keen of Claresholm and sister-in-law, Kay (Lou) Karpick of Lethbridge, and all of her special nieces and nephews. Sherry was predeceased by her father, Allan Frank in 1991, and two sisters-in-law. A Vigil Prayer Service will be held Monday, February 25th at 7:00 p.m. at Moose Jaw Funeral Home, 268 Mulberry Lane, Moose Jaw. Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Tuesday, February 26th, 2008 at 10:00 a.m. in St. Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church, 1064-3rd Ave NW, Moose Jaw. In lieu of flowers, memorials can be made in Sherry’s honor to the Activities Department at Extendicare Moose Jaw, 1151 Coteau St W, Moose Jaw SK S6H 5G5 or to the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, 400-2631-28th Ave, Regina SK S4S 6X3."
