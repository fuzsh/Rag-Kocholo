        "text": "Vice Provost - Allen Yarnell Center for Student Success\n\n& Director, Hilleman Scholars\n\nCarina Beck serves in the role of Vice Provost and Director of the Hilleman Scholars Program at Montana State University. In her role, Dr. Beck is responsible for several offices and programs that work toward a common goal of creating transformational learning, development, and engagement opportunities for MSU students.\n\nBeck oversees the MSU Hilleman Scholars Program, a scholarship and leadership program for Montana Pell-eligible students. In addition to personalized student success support, the program serves as a living laboratory to research and develop innovative practices that promote better outcomes for all students who attend Montana State University. Through its innovative curriculum program design, and partnerships with individuals and programs across Montana, the MSU Hilleman Scholars Program is well situated to produce Montana’s future leaders.\n\nIn addition, Beck oversees the Allen Yarnell Center for Student Success, which is comprised of the following offices: Career, Internship & Student Employment Services; Office of Student Success; Office of Financial Education; Office of Return-to-Learn; Bobcat Mentoring; Montana’s Own Scholarship Program; and Faculty Early Alert Program. In support of the public land grant mission of MSU, the offices and services are designed to collaborate to advance the institution’s strategic plan, Choosing Promise.\n\nDuring her time at MSU, Beck also helped establish other MSU offices including Blackstone Launch Pad, MSU Leadership Institute (co-founded with Jim McCray) and re-established the\n\nU. S. Department of Education TRIO SSS program.\n\nAlong with her husband, Lawrence, Carina has called Montana home for over 30 years. They share two boys – Lawrence & AJ - and love for the Montana seasons and outdoors.\n\nCatTracks & ChampChange Manager\n\nI serve in the role of the CatTracks and ChampChange Manager. I also assist in teaching US210 - Education, the World of Work and You Learning as a Lab instructor.\n\nMy background in education spans over 30 years where I have spent time as a physical education teacher, coach, and principal. I earned my BA from Metropolitan State University in Denver and my M.Ed. from the University of Phoenix. Prior to joining the AYCSS Team, I served as the Principal of Options Alternative High School, within the Littleton Public Schools District in Littleton, Colorado.\n\nThroughout my time as an educator, my \"why\" has simply been about servant leadership and putting others first. The responsibility of a leader is to not only ensure the success of students but also a responsibility to my colleagues (teammates) and the greater community.\n\nInitially, the ChampChange and CatTracks Manager serves the Allen Yarnell Center for Student Success through operations and programmatic efforts. Overall, this position plays an integral role in providing means for the MSU staff to track and intervene with students who are not presenting behavior consistent with the desired academic or engagement habits that are often credited with leading to higher retention and graduation rates. The idea of being able to do this type of work at the higher education level—supporting student success—connects perfectly with the mission of the Allen Yarnell Center for Student Success. I am very honored to be a part of the AYCSS team here at Montana State University.\n\nIn my spare time, I love to walk our 2 dogs, hike, fish (my goal is to actually catch a fish on a fly rod), sports (soccer), or just pretty much anything outdoors. GO Cats!\n\nGold Standard Program Manager\n\nNicole joined the AYCSS in April 2024, assuming the role of Gold Standard Program Manager.
