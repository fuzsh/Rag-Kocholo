        "text": "Mrs Keen, who is Minister for Health has been drawn into the argument after being named as one of four ministers facing questioning after using taxpayers’ money to pay for their second home.\n\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown this week called for an inquiry into parliamentary allowances after Employment Minister Tony McNulty, MP for Harrow East, admitted claiming £60,000 to pay the mortgage on a house in his constituency while living with his wife in the capital.\n\nThe Keens, who were last year dubbed “Mr and Mrs Expenses” have claimed a combined total of £174,650 under the Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) for their South Bank flat despite their home in Brentford being just 30 minutes from Westminster.\n\nThe flat, bought six years ago for £500,000, boasts a swimming pool and 24 hour concierge and is reported to be worth £700,000.\n\nHowever Mr Keen, who is MP for Feltham and Heston said he and his wife had nothing to hide.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the couple he said: “There’s nothing to investigate. Everything has always been published. We voted for this and it’s all in the public arena.\n\n“Everything we claim is with parliamentary rules and is thoroughly audited.”\n\nThe ACA was brought in to help MPs based outside central London to pay for second homes or hotel stays nearer Parliament.\n\nIt has emerged 27 MPs living in London claimed £1.7m over a five year period for second homes.\n\nIt was reported over half of the MPs who claimed money from the ACA lived less than an hour’s commute from Parliament.\n\nMatthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: “Parliamentary expenses are meant to ensure that everyone is properly represented in the democratic system, not for MPs to build up a property portfolio.\n\n“Most of Ann Keen’s constituents have to commute to work in central London, so she should do the same. Brentford isn’t very far away from Westminster at all, so it is wrong for her to take advantage of taxpayers’ generosity by buying a second home at our expense. This kind of opportunist behaviour gives Parliament and democracy a bad name.”"
