        "text": "Labour MP Mr Keen said the couple’s £500,000 flat on the Thames helped them do their jobs. “People argue and say, ‘I work shifts’ but their shift doesn’t go from Monday lunchtime consistently until Friday lunchtime,” he said.\n\n“It is not comparable to any other job. We have done nothing wrong, our consciences are clear. Anybody who commutes to and from outer London, I bet they don’t work as many hours as Ann and I work, because it wouldn’t be possible.”\n\nMr Keen’s claims are likely to raise eyebrows among the many MPs who do commute from outer London. Immigration Minister Phil Woolas lives in Brentford, a street away from the Keens’ constituency home, and Environment Secretary Hilary Benn lives in Chiswick, in Mrs Keen’s constituency."
