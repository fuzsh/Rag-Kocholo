        "text": "Dr. Ashley Keen-Ramirez\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, PA, Dr. Ashley Keen-Ramirez relocated to North Port, Florida when she was 10 years old, and quickly became a Florida Girl, loving the beach and the sunshine. She subsequently moved to Coral Gables, Florida where she attended the University of Miami and met her husband Andrew.\n\nHer next move was to New Orleans, La, where she earned her DDS degree from the Louisiana State University School of Dentistry. At LSUSD, she was a member of the Kells Honor Society, and was awarded the Allan P. Rappold Award for Excellence in Operative Dentistry, the Pankey Institute Scholarship, and the American Academy of Implant Dentistry Certificate of Recognition.\n\nDr. Keen-Ramirez moved back to Florida after dental school, and joined Aspen Dental in their Sun City location. She quickly honed her clinical skills and business mindset, and became a partner in the practice. She continues to have a thirst for knowledge and was recognized and credentialed as a Fellow in the International Congress of Oral Implantologists. In 2017 she was recognized as “Mentor of the Year” for Aspen Dental.\n\nIn 2018, she, together with husband Andrew, welcomed their precious baby girl Paisley. When not at work, Dr. Keen-Ramirez enjoys spending time with her family and friends, going to Canes football games, playing soccer, and appreciating the beautiful Florida sunshine."
