Labour MP Alan Keen has died at the age of 73 after a lengthy battle with cancer, it has been revealed.

Mr Keen

had been MP for Feltham and Heston since 1992, joining politics after an 18-year stint as a scout for Middlesbrough FC. He is survived by former Labour MP and health minister wife Ann Keen and their three children.

"Alan was a great MP, locally popular, a diligent London MP, and a great fighter for local causes," said former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

"I salute his bravery in facing cancer, fighting it as long as he could, and he will be remembered as someone who taught us how to fight illness. As he acknowledged, the NHS could not have done more to be of help and support," he added.

Mr Keen came under fire during the expenses scandal after it was claimed in 2009 that he and wife Ann claimed on a London flat despite having a family home ten miles away. The couple, dubbed "Mr and Mrs Expenses" by the press, were asked to pay back Â£1,500 after a "serious breach" of Commons rules.
