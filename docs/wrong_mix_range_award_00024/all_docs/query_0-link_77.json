        "text": "The 2017 Nobel prize in physics has been awarded to three US scientists for the detection of gravitational waves.\n\nRainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish will share the nine million kronor (Â£831,000) prize.\n\nThe ripples were predicted by Albert Einstein and are a fundamental consequence of his General Theory of Relativity.\n\nThe winners are members of the Ligo-Virgo observatories, which were responsible for the breakthrough.\n\nThe winners join a prestigious list of 204 other Physics laureates recognised since 1901.\n\nProf Weiss gets half of the prize money, while Barish and Thorne will share the other half.\n\nGravitational waves describe the stretching and squeezing of space-time that occurs when massive objects accelerate.\n\nThe warping of space resulting from the merger of two black holes was initially picked up by the US Ligo laboratory in 2015 - the culmination of a decades-long quest.\n\nThree more examples have been detected since then.\n\nGravitational waves - Ripples in the fabric of space-time\n\nGravitational waves are a prediction of the Theory of General Relativity\n\nIt took decades to develop the technology to directly detect them\n\nThey are ripples in the fabric of space-time generated by violent events\n\nAccelerating masses will produce waves that propagate at the speed of light\n\nDetectable sources ought to include merging black holes and neutron stars\n\nLigo/Virgo fire lasers into long, L-shaped tunnels; the waves disturb the light\n\nDetecting the waves opens up the Universe to completely new investigations\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Olga Botner, from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said: \"The first ever observation of a gravitational wave was a milestone - a window on the Universe.\"\n\nThe US Ligo and European Virgo laboratories were built to detect the very subtle signal produced by these waves.\n\nEven though they are produced by colossal phenomena, such as black holes merging, Einstein himself thought the effect might simply be too small to register by technology.\n\nBut the three new laureates led the development of a laser-based system that could reach the sensitivity required to bag a detection.\n\nThe result was Ligo, a pair of widely separated facilities in North America: one observatory is based in Washington State, while the other is in Livingston, Louisiana.\n\nThe European side of the gravitational wave collaboration is based in Pisa, Italy. On 14 August this year, just after coming online, it sensed the most recent of the four gravitational wave events.\n\nSpeaking over the phone at the Nobel announcement in Stockholm, Rainer Weiss said the discovery was the work of about 1,000 people.\n\nHe explained: \"It's a dedicated effort that's been going on for - I hate to tell you - it's as long as 40 years, of people thinking about this, trying to make a detection and sometimes failing in the early days, then slowly but surely getting the technology together to do it. It's very, very exciting that it worked out in the end.\"\n\nNonetheless, the Nobel trio's contribution is also regarded as fundamental.\n\nWeiss set out the strategy that would be needed to make a detection.\n\nThorne did much of the theoretical work that underpinned the quest.\n\nAnd Barish, who took over as the second director of Ligo in 1994, is credited with driving through organisational reforms and technology choices that would ultimately prove pivotal in the mission's success.\n\nThe Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees, said the three leaders honoured by the Nobel Committee were \"outstanding individuals whose contributions were distinctive and complementary\".\n\nBut he added: \"Of course, Ligo's success was owed to literally hundreds of dedicated scientists and engineers. The fact that the Nobel committee refuses to make group awards is causing them increasingly frequent problems - and giving a misleading and unfair impression of how a lot of science is actually done.\"\n\nMany commentators had gravitational waves down as a dead cert to win last year, but the Nobel committee has always been fiercely independent in its choices and has made everyone wait 12 months.\n\nHad the prize been awarded last year, it is very likely that the Scottish physicist Ron Drever would have shared it with Weiss and Thorne.\n\nThe trio won all the big science prizes - apart from the Nobel - in the immediate aftermath of the first detection in 2015.\n\nBut Drever died in March this year and Nobels are generally not awarded posthumously.\n\nThe Scotsman developed some of the early laser systems at Glasgow University before taking this knowledge to Caltech in California, which manages the Washington State Ligo facility.\n\nGlasgow remains the UK hub for the big British contribution to Ligo. Its Institute for Gravitational Research designed and built the suspension system that holds the ultra-still mirrors used in the US and Italian labs.\n\nCatherine O'Riordan, interim co-chief executive of the American Institute of Physics (AIP), said: \"Weiss, Barish and Thorne led us to the first detection of gravitational waves and laid the foundation for the new and exciting era we officially entered on September 14, 2015 - the era of gravity wave astronomy.\"\n\nThis is actually the second Nobel prize to involve gravitational waves. In 1993, Americans Russell Alan Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor were awarded the physics prize for work that provided indirect evidence for the warping of space.\n\nPrevious winners of the Nobel Prize in physics\n\n2016 - David Thouless, Duncan Haldane and Michael Kosterlitz shared the award for their work on rare phases of matter.\n\n2015 - Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald were awarded the prize the discovery that neutrinos switch between different \"flavours\".\n\n2010 - Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov were awarded the prize for their discovery of the \"wonder material\" graphene."
