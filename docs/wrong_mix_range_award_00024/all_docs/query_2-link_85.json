He attended school where he learned math and science. He was also taught at home. At home he learned Judaism and violin. He taught himself how to do geometry.\n\nEinstein felt that he would make a good math and physics teacher. In 1900, he graduated as a teacher. He had a very hard time finding a teaching job at a university. He took a temporary job as a high school teacher. That only lasted a short time. By 1902, he was working in an office that handed out patents on new inventions. He worked in the patent office for seven years.\n\nWhile working in the patent office, he wrote papers about his ideas on physics topics. His ideas were new and very good. In 1909, he was able to get a job teaching at a university. He continued to write about his ideas on physics. His ideas were so good that he was given the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.\n\nEinstein was a very good scientist. He was also a good citizen. Einstein spoke out against the country in which he was born. He did not think that Germany should be fighting in World War I. Some Germans did not like the fact that he was speaking against his homeland. There were also some Germans that did not like the fact he was a Jew.\n\nEinstein went to the Unites States in 1932 to work at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. While he was in the United States, Nazis took control of Germany. Einstein spoke out against the Nazis that came to power in 1932. Once the Nazis were in control, he did not go back to Germany. He became a United States citizen in 1940. He contributed money to help the United States win World War II against Germany.\n\nEinstein became ill in 1949. He cut back on his travels and his workload. Einstein was so highly thought of that Israel offered him the job of President in 1952. He did not take the job because of his bad health. Einstein died in 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey."
