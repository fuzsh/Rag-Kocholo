        "text": "In this century, the work of Albert Einstein is the most representative example of the search for the fundamental scientific laws of nature.\n\nHe was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14th, 1879. In 1916, he published “The General Theory of Relativity” which advanced twenty years time in contemporary scientific work in the area of theoretical physics. Among his most important contributions to humanity are, besides the above mentioned theory: “The Theory of Brownian Movement”, “The Inertia Principle of Energy”, “The Quantum Law in the Emission and Absorption of Light” and “The Theory of the Specific Heat of Solid Bodies”.\n\nIn 1921 he was granted the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Photoelectric Law."
