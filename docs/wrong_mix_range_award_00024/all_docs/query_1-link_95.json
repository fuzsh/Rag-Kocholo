        "text": "Einstein's professional work focused on the fields of mathematics and theortical physics. Early in his career, he developed the Special Theory of Relativity, and later refined it into the General Theory of Relativity, for which he is best known. In later life, Einstein spent many years working toward an understanding of the most basic building blocks of all matter, which he attempted to describe in a unified field theory. String theory, a quandry of theretical physicists today, is an extension of Einstein's work from fifty years ago.\n\nGraduated in 1900 from the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (the Federal Polytechnic) in Zurich in mathematics and physics. Earned a doctorate from the University of Zurich in 1905 for a thesis on a new determination of molecular dimensions.\n\nIn 1908, Einstein became a lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, he become professor of physics at the University of Zurich. He was appointed a full professor at the Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1911. He moved to Zurich in 1912 to take up a chair at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule. In 1914, he accepted a research position in the Prussian Academy of Sciences together with a chair (but no teaching duties) at the University of Berlin. In 1933, he joined the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked for the remaining 22 years of his life. Einstein received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. Among other honors were the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1925 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1926. He was an American Mathematical Society Gibbs Lecturer in 1934, and won the Franklin Medal in 1935 for Contributions to Theoretical Physics. He was offered the presidency of Israel in 1952, but declined the honor. In 1964, Crater Einstein, a lunar feature, was named after him."
