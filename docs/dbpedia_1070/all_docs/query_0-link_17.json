        "text": "Richard J. Wilkinson, 78, went to be with the Lord on April 26, 2024.\n\nHe was born on September 1, 1945 in Lake Charles to Moyse and Elrena Wilkinson.\n\nRichard loved his family dearly and unconditionally. He was a musician who enjoyed playing guitar and loved music. He also enjoyed traveling with his family, telling jokes, and spending time with his children and grandchildren. He made friends everywhere he went. Richard was known as a jack of all trades and a Cajun engineer who could fix anything. He served his country honorably in the United States Navy. Richard will be dearly missed by his family and friends.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife, Kristina Guillory Wilkinson; children and grandchildren, Rhonda and Brad (Jordyn and Brendon), Troy and Mandy (Baly, Austin, and Mallory), Dwain and Karen (Brian and Kailey), Jason and Tiffany (Victoria and Samantha), Natalie (Travis, Emily, and Carlie), and Brent; 5 great grandchildren; and siblings, Doug and Iris.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; sister, Bernie Don; and stepdaughter, Robin.\n\nA graveside service with Military Honors will be held at 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 1, 2024 at the Southwest Louisiana Veteranâ€™s Cemetery in Jennings, LA. Shelly Young will officiate.\n\nThe family would like to extend special thanks to the nurses and staff at Harbor Hospice for their compassion and care."
