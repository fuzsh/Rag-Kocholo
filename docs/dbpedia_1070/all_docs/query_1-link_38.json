        "text": "Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 5 Jul 2020 | Created 12 Nov 2016\n\nThis page has been accessed 561 times.\n\nBiography\n\nArthur was a discharged \"Out-Pensioner of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea\", having suffered disease while serving in the West Indies in the 83rd Regiment of Foot.\n\nHistory of his regiment can be found at this link:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/83rd_(County_of_Dublin)_Regiment_of_Foot\n\nPension management and the sources for these letters were the Royal Hospital at Chelsea;\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hospital_Chelsea\n\nhttp://www.chelsea-pensioners.co.uk/\n\nSept 20, 1793 - Mar 31, 1794 military service not specified, private Oct 1 - Nov 6, 1794 Dublin, Ireland, private (36 days) Dec 25, 1794 to June 24, 1795 Mansfield/Vansfield/Varnsfield?, private (182 days)\n\nDuring the next period of his military service he was positioned in Montego Bay and Old Maroon Town during the eight month Second Maroon War in Jamaica. This war started when the descendants of escaped slaves that lived in the mountains of Jamaica rebelled against the British governor.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Maroon_War\n\nDec 25, 1795 - June 25, 1796: Montego Bay, private, 183 days June 25, 1796 - Dec 24, 1796, Old Maroon Town, private, 183 days Dec 25, 1796 - June 24, 1797, Old Maroon Town, private, 182 days June 25, 1797 - Dec 25, 1797, Old Maroon Town, duty corporal\n\nHe then went to Saint Domingo until Oct 24, 1798, he was discharged the next spring after an army career of five years and 3 months. He was 23 years old.\n\nHe was out-pensioned according to Royal Hospital, Chelsea records on May 6, 1799.\n\nBack home he married Elizabeth Wiley and started a family.\n\nOn Christmas night, 1828, in Poyntzpass, (at the \"Far Pass), County Down, a man was murdered at the doorstep of Arthur's home. Later the perpetrators were sentenced to jail, largely based on his evidence.\n\nOn September 25 while away on business, his house was torched, he believed in revenge, however the neighbours prevented the house from being destroyed and the eight persons at home (his wife, three of his sons and four daughters) were saved. For this reason he petitioned to emigrate to British North America fearing for his safety.\n\nIn 1830, in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, Arthur could have availed himself of the provisions of English law published in June 1830 entitled \"A Bill to make further Regulations with respect to Army Pensions.\" This bill allowed military pensioners to cash out the equivalent of four years of their pensions if they wished to emigrate, forfeiting all future pension payments. At some point passages and grants of land were discussed in Parliament.\n\nHe received approval to collect his pension in British North America on Feb 22, 1830 before the new pension act was enacted. Arthur requested free passage but was denied that request in his approval letter.\n\nIn 1830 Arthur was 54 years old, his wife 52, their children ranged in age from Matilda the youngest at age 2, Arthur aged 13, Sarah 14, Thomas (? - not added yet pending more proof) 16, David 19 and John aged 22. The identity and ages of the other two daughters is unknown. Known to have emigrated to Canada were John, Sarah, Arthur and Matilda who all had large and well documented families in Ontario.\n\nThere may be a possible son Thomas between David and Sarah.\n\nA Thomas Wilkinson married Catherine McMulkin and his marriage entry is directly above Sarah Wilkinson and John Boyce. No parents are recorded for either marriage. It is likely that this Thomas is actually a brother to Arthur as DNA matches have been discovered between the descendants of Arthur and Thomas and the two men are four years apart in age. Thomas and Catherine had nine children in Ontario prior to moving to Wisconsin where they are picked up in that country's 1860 census.\n\nThomas, Arthur and whatever family emigrated around 1830 should be captured in the 1851 census, that document has yet to be discovered.\n\nIn 1861 Arthur's widow Elizabeth was living in Simcoe county, aged 84, living with their son Arthur Wilkinson 44, his wife Marg 42 and seven of their young children. According to their gravestone, Arthur had died on Mar 12, 1860. His wife died on Feb 12, 1865.\n\nBurial: West Essa Cemetery West Essa Simcoe County Ontario, Canada\n\nSources\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=LzhbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR49&dq=Army+Pensions+Act+1830&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjRho7ht_zQAhWF1IMKHURSDcYQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=Army%20Pensions%20Act%201830&f=false\n\nWilkinson-McMahon marriage, Wilkinson-Bryce marriage; Archives of Ontario; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; District Marriage Registers, 1801-1858; Series: MS248; Reel: 2\n\nFind A Grave Memorial# 112936413, http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=112936413"
