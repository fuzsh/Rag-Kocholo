He sustained two important pastorate with concentrated preaching – Coventry (Ford Street) for nine years and Hull (Bourne) for seven years. Lucidity combined with literary aesthetic quality distinguished his sermons, all based upon a sound theological and ethical foundation.\n\nThroughout his ministry, Arthur had a wide field of vision. A careful reader in theology and ethics, he spread his wings into scientific regions and in particular the natural sciences. He wrote several books and contributed articles to such magazines as The Aldersgate, The Holborn Review and The Preacher’s Quarterly.\n\nIn 1930 Arthur was Secretary of the Conference.\n\nOn final retirement, Arthur settled in Grange-over-Sands, where he took an active interest in the little Cark Chapel, besides preaching regularly throughout the Ulverston Circuit until he was just turned ninety years of age.\n\nFamily\n\nArthur married Emily Robinson Page (abt 1871-1949) on 7 July 1900 at Harborne, Staffordshire. Census returns identify two of three children.\n\nArthur Beale (1901-1971)\n\nGeorge Beevers (1905-2000)\n\nArthur died on 26 February 1968 in the Ulverston Registration District, Lancashire.\n\nCircuits\n\n1896 Portsmouth\n\n1898 Cambridge II\n\n1900 Leeds II\n\n1903 Lynn\n\n1907 Yarmouth\n\n1911 Blackheath\n\n1914 Coventry I\n\n1923 Hull VIII\n\n1930 Halifax I\n\n1933 Keighley\n\n1935 Sheringham\n\n1937 Superann\n\n1943 Glossop (Ac)\n\n1946 Leeds (Sup)\n\nPM Minutes 1968/192\n\nW Leary, Directory of Primitive Methodist Ministers and their Circuits, 1990\n\nCensus Returns and Births, Marriages & Deaths Registers"
