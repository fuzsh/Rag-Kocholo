        "text": "Clarice Cliff\n\nClarice Cliff was born (1899) into a working class family in Tunstall. She showed artistic promise at school and left at age 13 to work as an apprentice enameller at a local factory 3 years later moving to another firm as an apprentice lithographer, at the same time she attended evening classes at Tunstall School of Art.\n\nIn 1916 at 17 she joined A J Wilkinson's pottery where her drawing brought her to the attention of the owner, Colley Shorter and he allowed her to experiment on some old stock. In 1927 he arranged for her to study sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London. Later in 1927 she studied in Paris.\n\nAfter a few months there she returned to Stoke-on-Trent where Shorter set her up in a decorating studio. By 1929 her designs went into full production as 'Hand Painted Bizarre by Clarice Cliff'.\n\nBy 1931 she was an Art Director of the factory with a decorating team of around 150.\n\nClarice Cliff and Shorter eventually married in 1940 after his first wife died.\n\nColley Shorter died in 1964 and Clarice in 1972.\n\nSee: \"in the footsteps of Clarice Cliff\"\n\nExternal links:"
