That medication was started whilst Mr CUNNINGHAM was an inpatient in hospital but discharge letters notifying his general practitioner of the need for close monitoring of his diabetes were sent to the wrong practice. Mental health workers raised concerns about Mr CUNNINGHAM's diabetes control but due to administrative errors, these were not known to his general practitioner and so no monitoring of his diabetes took place despite high blood readings. His diabetes was therefore uncontrolled at the time of his death. 11/04/2024 11/04/2024 WIGNALL, Stuart Vincent Stuart Vincent WIGNALL was found deceased on 17 November 2023 at his home address in Lancashire.

The other patient had a do not resuscitate order on their records, Mrs DAWSON did not. Mrs DAWSON's death was contributed to by neglect in not checking her identity matched the identity of the patient with the do not resuscitate order in place. 15/04/2024 17/04/2024 THORNLEY, Denise Denise THORNLEY died on 22 May 2023 near Froom Street, Chorley in Lancashire.

Mrs PHILLIPS had a lengthy hospital stay, during which her oral intake was limited. She became increasingly frail during her admission and her wound became infected which turned to sepsis and caused her death. 06/06/2024 06/06/2024 SMITH, Wayne Sydney Wayne Sydney SMITH died on 31 January 2024 at his home address 137 Bearncroft, Skelmersdale. Wayne developed severe bronchopneumonia shortly before his death that developed into sepsis. The sepsis prevented Wayne excreting morphine that reached toxic levels, despite him taking the correct dose. The toxic levels of morphine and the bronchopneumonia caused his death due to respiratory depression. 06/06/2024 06/06/2024 WATSON, Stephen Geoffrey Accident 07/06/2024 07/06/2024 FRIEL, Brian Joseph Patrick Brian Joseph FRIEL died on the 7th October 2023 at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary as a result of a spontaneous gastrointestinal haemorrhage. He suffered a fall at home on the 1st October 2023 which an ambulance attended but Mr FRIEL refused to go to hospital. On the 3rd October 2023 Mr FRIEL was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with a fractured neck of femur. He was due to undergo surgical repair but developed gastrointestinal bleeding and abnormal blood clotting. Mr FRIEL was due to receive treatment to correct his blood clotting but the treatment plan was not carried out. Mr FRIEL was later given clotting treatment but suffered a cardiac arrest and died. The delay in receiving clotting treatment contributed to his death occurring at the time which it did. 10/06/2024 10/06/2024 SPENCE, Daniel Suicide 13/06/2024 13/06/2024 MARSHALL, Anna Jane Anna Jane MARSHALL died on the 9th August 2023 at the Travelodge, Commercial Road, Darwen by hanging. Mrs MARSHALL had struggled with her mental health for some time and had recently suffered the breakdown of her marriage which caused a mental health crisis. In July 2023, Mrs MARSHALL consumed an excess of medication for which she was treated and then admitted for inpatient mental health care. Mrs MARSHALL was distressed about where she would live after her discharge and told staff she would take her own life if discharged without secure accommodation. Despite this, Mrs MARSHALL was discharged to a Travelodge where she self-administered a ligature. The discharge from inpatient care was unsafe and provided the opportunity for Mrs MARSHALL to end her life. Information was not shared with community mental health services and the hospital did not engage with all necessary departments which contributed to an incomplete picture of Mrs MARSHALL's risk to herself being known by community services. Mrs MARSHALL would not have died at the time at which she did if she had not been unsafely discharged from inpatient care. At the time Mrs MARSHALL secured the ligature she intended to take her own life, but this must be viewed in the context of her mental health crisis. 13/06/2024 13/06/2024 PAWLOWSKA, Teresina Maria Teresina Maria PAWLOWSKA died on the 7th June 2024 at the Glen Care Centre, Gleneagles Drive, Morecambe, as a result of a gastric perforation.

Mr COYLE suffered a bowel perforation which was operated on. Following the surgery, Mr COYLE suffered with septic shock which caused his organs to fail. Mr COYLE had previous stroke damage to his brain which, along with existing peripheral vascular disease, contributed to his death. 19/06/2024 19/06/2024 BAMFORD, Mark Edwin Mark Edwin BAMFORD died at Royal Preston Hospital on the 5th of November 2023 suffering from colorectal cancer. There were delays in the accurate diagnosis of the cancer however due to its advance it was not likely that treatment would have been available. 20/06/2024 21/06/2024 HEYES, David Lawrence David Lawrence HEYES who suffered from a number of comorbidities including peripheral vascular disease died on the 17th of August 2023 at the Chorley and South Ribble General Hospital from an infection following a lengthy period of home care and treatment for pressure sores. Whilst no signs of infection were detected by paramedics on the 12th of August 2023 and he was not admitted to hospital Mr HEYES' health had clearly deteriorated. 20/06/2024 20/06/2024 RAWLINSON, Sylvia Margaret Sylvia Margaret RAWLINSON died on the 11th June 2024 at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary as a result of injuries sustained in a fall at home. Mrs RAWLINSON was a very frail lady who's mobility had become significantly limited. It is more likely than not that her underlying frailty was the cause of her fall. 20/06/2024 20/06/2024 WHALLEY, Nathan John Suicide 20/06/2024 20/06/2024 WRIGHT , Rhian Louise Suicide 21/06/2024 21/06/2024 NILAND, James Anthony James Anthony NILAND died on the 25th March 2024 at the Royal Preston Hospital. On the 21st March 2024, he suffered a fall into his bathtub whilst at home and sustained nine per cent total body surface area burns to his left flank and buttock. Mr NILAND had significant underlying medical conditions including advanced liver cancer for which he was receiving palliative care. Whilst it is not possible to determine whether an accident or a medical event caused Mr NILAND to fall, his direct cause of death was attributable to the burns he sustained as a result of the fall and his liver cancer diagnosis 21/06/2024 21/06/2024 SHABIR, Ali Asghar Open 21/06/2024 21/06/2024 WHITESIDE, Edward Industrial disease 21/06/2024 21/06/2024 WILSON, Heidi Marie Drug related 24/06/2024 24/06/2024 BISHOP, Steve Steve BISHOP died on the 23rd of October 2023 at his home address as a result of metastatic lung cancer. Mr BISHOP had been unwell for some time and underwent a CT scan on the 30th June 2022. That scan was reported as showing no malignancy when in fact suspicious nodules were present. This led to a delay in Mr BISHOP's diagnosis and treatment options. Although Mr BISHOP had significant underlying health concerns and would not have been a candidate for curative treatment, it is more likely than not that he would not have died at the time at which he did, if the nodules had been detected on the scan from June 2022. 25/06/2024 25/07/2024 ASHBRIDGE, Janet Janet ASHBRIDGE died on the 11th July 2023 at the Royal Blackburn Hospital as a result of multiple organ failure. She had undergone routine surgery to her foot on the 22nd May 2023, following which her health deteriorated and her organs began to fail. Ms ASHBRIDGE had a number of underlying health conditions which meant that her liver was not functioning normally. A deterioration in liver function led to deterioration in other organs until Ms ASHBRIDGE's death. It is not possible to determine what caused her liver to deteriorate. 25/06/2024 25/06/2024 ATKINSON, Edwin Edwin ATKINSON died on 31 January 2024 at Royal Preston Hospital, Preston in Lancashire. Following a fall at home Mr ATKINSON was admitted to hospital where a spinal cord injury was diagnosed and operated upon which resulted in diaphragmatic paralysis.

Mr WALLACE presented to hospital with severe epigastric pain which was not relieved with pain relief. Around 17 hours after admission, a myocardial infarction was diagnosed and he was transferred to the regional cardiac centre for treatment but did not recover. His death was contributed to by the length of time taken to receive treatment for the myocardial infarction. 27/06/2024 27/06/2024 CROSS, Jacqueline Morgan Suicide 27/06/2024 27/06/2024 CROSSLEY, Stewart Accident 27/06/2024 27/06/2024 MCTERNAN, Louise Suicide 27/06/2024 27/06/2024 MELVIN, Liam Paul Accident 27/06/2024 27/06/2024 SLATER, Brian James Brian James SLATER died on 7 July 2023 at 40 Fielding Street, Rishton in Lancashire.

Following the surgery, Mrs PELL's health deteriorated and she died as a result of the medical conditions with which she was suffering. These were predominantly naturally occurring illnesses, however the fracture and subsequent operation placed additional strain upon Mrs PELL's physiological reserves and thus played a contributory role in her death. 28/06/2024 28/06/2024 SMITH, Ciaran Joseph Ciaran Joseph SMITH who suffered from a number of comorbidities including Alzheimer's disease died at Royal Preston Hospital on the 13th of December 2022 from an infection and poor nutrition intake following admission to hospital with a head injury after he had stumbled into a motor vehicle in Preston city centre on the 5th of December 2022 01/07/2024 01/07/2024 HAMPSON, Mark Suicide 01/07/2024 01/07/2024 O'DOHERTY, Marlene Accident 01/07/2024 01/07/2024 WALSH, Jean Natural causes 02/07/2024 02/07/2024 ASTLEY, Thomas Thomas ASTLEY died on the 18th February 2024 at the Royal Blackburn Hospital.

He became unwell at home and returned to hospital where he suffered with vomiting and developed aspiration pneumonia which caused his death. 02/07/2024 02/07/2024 BODEN, Dean Natural causes 02/07/2024 02/07/2024 MURRAY, Alfred John Natural causes 02/07/2024 02/07/2024 TAJ, Malik Javad Ali Malik Javad Ali TAJ died on the 9th October 2023 at the Royal Blackburn Hospital as a result of necrotising fasciitis. Mr TAJ had a number of underlying health conditions which had necessitated a below knee amputation in August 2023. Following the surgery, Mr TAJ suffered a stroke and developed pressure ulcers.

He returned to hospital where he was treated for sepsis whilst awaiting admission. A CT scan revealed signs of necrotising fasciitis and Mr TAJ underwent surgical debridement on the 9th October 2023, following which he suffered a cardiac arrest which caused his death. 03/07/2024 03/07/2024 KHAN, Sophia Suicide 03/07/2024 03/07/2024 WINDER, Keith Natural causes 04/07/2024 04/07/2024 BAXTER, Robert James Thoms Robert James Thomas BAXTER died on 15 November 2023 at 55 Alexander Road, Southport in Merseyside.

Mrs TAYLOR had a previous Whipple's procedure in 2010 which left her with altered anatomy and meant that options to treat her bile duct blockage were limited. Her care was transferred between two hospital trusts which resulted in treating clinicians having incomplete medical information about Mrs TAYLOR's deterioration. She was awaiting a procedure under general anaesthetic which was delayed and whilst awaiting that procedure Mrs TAYLOR became acutely unwell which necessitated an emergency procedure following which she developed uncontrollable bleeding and died. 18/07/2024 18/07/2024 THOMAS, David John Accidental death 19/07/2024 19/07/2024 BOYD, Murray Carlisle Murray Carlisle BOYD died on the 12th May 2023 at the Royal Preston Hospital as a result of a myocardial infarction.

A transfer was arranged for specialist cardiology care at the Blackpool Victoria Hospital, however, on route Mr BOYD became too unwell for transfer and was re routed to the Royal Preston Hospital where he died. It took a significant amount of time for the ambulance to attend the Royal Lancaster Infirmary to facilitate the transfer of Mr BOYD to the Blackpool Victoria Hospital. However investigations conclude that this was due to service demand and not error. 19/07/2024 19/07/2024 PILSWORTH, Theresa Theresa Marie PILSWORTH died at Flat 1 Sunacre Court, Maple Avenue, Morecambe on 28th January 2024 having suffered a thromboembolism following drug ingestion and immobility 23/07/2024 23/07/2024 JOBSON, Badley Reece Bradley Reece JOBSON died at his home on the 10th of February 2024 and whilst there was evidence of cocaine use it is not possible to determine any contribution to his death 23/07/2024 23/07/2024 LANG, Clifford James Clifford James LANG died on 25 January 2024 at East Lancashire Hospice, Park Lee Road, Blackburn.

Mrs WIGNALL suffered with significant mental health problems following the loss of her adult son in early 2023. Mrs WIGNALL had received both inpatient and community mental health support. She was taking a number of medications to support her mental health, one of which was discontinued due to fears about possible addiction. Mrs WIGNALL showed no signs of addiction and the removal of this medication without changes to her support plans or existing medication contributed to a decline in her wellbeing. By December 7th 2023, mental health practitioners felt that Mrs WIGNALL required consideration for inpatient admission but a psychiatric review on the 11th December 2023 concluded that she was safe in the community and no referral was made for inpatient care or increased community support. On the morning of December 14th 2023, Mrs WIGNALL drove in her car to the River Lune and entered the water with the intention of ending her own life. This intention must be viewed in the context of her severe psychotic depression and the mental health crisis she was experiencing. 05/08/2024 05/08/2024 YOUSAF, Adil Suicide 06/08/2024 06/08/2024 DYSON, Lynda Lynda DYSON died having developed an infection from serious pressure damage to her skin.

She had a number of underlying health conditions and had developed boils to her groin. These became infected and on the 4th January 2024 Miss MONK attended hospital by ambulance. It was initially unclear whether she was suffering from cellulitis or necrotising fasciitis and further investigations were necessary prior to reaching a confirmed diagnosis. Miss MONK was taken to theatre for debridement of the skin and underwent a number of procedures before her organs began to fail and she died.
