        "text": "107 killed in North Shields air raid disaster…\n\nMay 3/4 1941. North Shields. A single bomb from a lone enemy aircraft destroys the public air raid shelter in the basement of W.A. Wilkinson Ltd. Of the 192 people inside, 107 men, women and children are killed. It was one of the worst single bomb death tolls during the provincial blitz of WW2. This website tells the story of that night..and pays tribute to those lost.\n\nThe Air Raid\n\nMidnight – Saturday May 3rd/4th 1941.\n\nA nuisance enemy raider over North Shields drops 4 bombs.\n\nSeconds later over a hundred people would be killed and entire families lost.\n\nWilkinson's Air Raid Shelter\n\nThe public air raid shelter serving this part of the east end of North Shields was situated in the basement/cellars of W.A. Wilkinson’s Ltd on the corner of King Street and George Street. Designated as a public air raid shelter in 1940 with a capacity of 188 – the shelter divided opinion amongst the residents of the local streets surrounding the factory.\n\nRead more\n\nMay 3/4 1941\n\nShortly before midnight on Saturday 3 May 1941 a lone German nuisance raider dropped 4 bombs on the Tyneside town of North Shields. Tragically, the fourth bomb scored a direct hit on Wilkinson’s lemonade factory. The Public Air Raid Shelter in the building’s basement was completely destroyed. Of the 192 people present, 107 people were killed. Entire families were wiped out. It was the scene of the heaviest casualties in North East England during the entire War.\n\nRead more\n\nAir Raid Photos\n\n109 killed. 107 in the air raid shelter and 2 killed in destruction of house around the corner in George Street.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nWith war time censorship, Wilkinson’s was never named in contemporary press reporting of enemy raids and civilian casualties. To our knowledge, Wilkinsons has not featured in the standard histories of the provincial Blitz, Home Front or Civil Defence prior to this website being published in 2000.\n\nThe disaster is covered in Dr Craig Armstrong’s “Tyneside in the Second World War” (Phillimore: 2007) and is mentioned in Joshua Levine’s “The Secret History of the Blitz” (Simon and Schuster: 2015)\n\nThe disaster was never forgotten in the town itself – many, many families were touched by the events of that evening. Following a memorial service at St Augustine’s Church, the community was left to get on with it. And this they did, seeing out the War with no repeat of the bombing disaster of 1941.\n\nRead more\n\nHeroes\n\nLocals risked their own lives to rescue those trapped in the basement.\n\nMrs Ellen Lee\n\nAt the time of the bombing, Mrs Lee lived at 2 Hamilton Terrace in North Shields, just around the corner from the Wilkinson’s factory. She stood 6ft tall and weighed close to 18 stone. She was indeed as everyone recalled, a large lady with a big heart – she would do anything for anyone.\n\nMrs Lee was the ARP warden in charge of Wilkinson’s Shelter. It was her job to open the shelter when the sirens sounded, keep it tidy and count people coming in and out.\n\nRead more…\n\nGeorge Newstead, GM\n\nGeorge Newstead cut a hole through to a cellar bay full of injured and dead. The casualties were gingerly taken out except for one man who was pinned down by a steel girder. He was in agony so a doctor was called to give him an anaesthetic and reluctantly, it was decided that the only way to save him was to amputate his foot. While the doctor crawled out to get his instruments George decided to have one more go at freeing the survivor. In spite of the risk of bringing down tons of debris he got a small jack under the girder and raised it slightly. It was just enough. By cutting the man’s boot off they were able to ease his leg out and drag him clear.\n\nRead more\n\nClarence Burdis, GM\n\nClarence Burdis cut a second hole through a thick wall to reach another smashed room in the basement. Here the casualties were lying amidst the splintered remains of their bunk beds. For four gruelling hours he slowly moved casualties from their shattered tomb.\n\nRead more\n\nNorman Darling Black, BEM\n\nMr Black, serving with a First Aid unit, struggled through a narrow opening, risking his life to find living people buried under the debris. For four hours he worked at great hazard to extricate a child imprisoned by many tons of masonry. He was advised to rest after this dangerous feat but returned to rescue an imprisoned man.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Victims\n\n107 people were killed. Over 20 were injured, several seriously. Very few escaped unscathed.\n\nVictims A-Z\n\nThe following 107 (including 7 who died later in hospital) people were killed as a result of enemy action at Wilkinson’s Air Raid Shelter: May 3rd 1941. The list includes all 103 people listed on the GENUKI Deaths and Fatal Injuries at North Shields on May 3rd 1941. In addition there are 4 military personnel victims listed who are not recorded on the GENUKI page (which features civilian deaths caused by enemy activity). 43 children (16 years old or younger) were killed.\n\nRead more\n\nMortuary Records\n\nDetails of each victim killed in the shelter and taken to the temporary mortuary at the old Public Bath House in North Shields were recorded on official Mortuary Forms. These are available to view at Tyne and Wear Archives. Forms do not exist for those who died later in hospital from their injuries. Many of the victims are buried in Preston Cemetery, North Shields.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Injured\n\nA list of those admitted to Preston Emergency Hospital on May 4th 1941\n\nRead more\n\nDeath Toll\n\nFor many years it was accepted that 105 people were killed in the Wilkinson’s bombing disaster. As a result of research for this website that figure has been revised up to 107. Here’s how…\n\nRead more\n\nClose to Home\n\nThe embedded map shows the victims’ residences in relation to the location of the air raid shelter at Wilkinsons. Residents of Upper Queen Street and Church Street had a bad time of it. Very many of the victims lived within 400m of the shelter. Their houses were largely untouched by the 2 bombs which fell on George Street that night. Had they only stayed at home….\n\nRead more\n\nPreston Cemetery\n\nThe majority of those killed at Wilkinsons are buried at Preston Cemetery, North Shields. The headstones are located throughout this beautiful cemetery according to denomination. However, there is a communal plot for those victims buried at the Borough’s expense. All have similar headstones (modelled on CWG headstones). This area can be found by walking up to the top end from the main entrance. Once past the Victorian/Edwardian graves bordered by hedges, the graves appear on your left.\n\nRead more\n\nMemories\n\nMemories of Wilkinson’s and wartime North Shields are always welcomed.\n\nGet in touch!\n\nI Remember - Wilkinsons and War Time North Shields\n\nWe welcome your Wilkinson’s Memories and thank you for taking time to contact us.

This was essential as it soon became clear that most bombing raids would take place at night. It was thought that a light even from one house would be used as a target, by an enemy plane on which to drop its bombs.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Shields Evening News\n\nThe Shields Evening News, May 5th 1941 – the day after the bombing.\n\nRead more\n\nRaids Elsewhere\n\nA national survey of German raids from 0600 hours, Wednesday 30 April to 0600 hours Wednesday 7 May, 1941.

He grew up in North Shields, the setting of many of his books and when war broke out he was 10 – a good age to enjoy it. War was exciting – Tyneside was heavily bombed and young Bob had to live through the terror of the air raids. His father was a key figure in local ARP and was on duty the night of the Wilkinson’s disaster.\n\nRead more\n\nRobert Westall Biography\n\nRobert Westall may have left the North East in his early twenties, but he returned to it time and again in his writing, whose roots lay in his childhood and young adult experiences in wartime Tyneside. Indeed, it was his desire to share that experience with his 12 year old son Chris that inspired his celebrated first novel The Machine Gunners.\n\nRead more\n\nRadio Documentaries\n\nIn 2007 we were approached by Neil Reynolds a local MA student in radio production who was planning a radio documentary on Westall for his final dissertation.

Note that the two local hospitals are clearly marked in red on the map. Although based on an Ordnance Survey 6″: 1 mile, it is slightly enlarged to a scale of 1:10,000.
