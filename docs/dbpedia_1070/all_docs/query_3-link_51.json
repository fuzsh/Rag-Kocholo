I am 23 years old and I am looking for my father Robert Wilkinson. He is about 42 or 43 years old, black male, light complexion curly hair, slender face brown eyes. Sometimes he is called Robby.He is from Cincinatti, OH. He entered the US Navy in June 1981. He attented bootcamp in Orlando. He has a son named Pierre. His 1st duty station was on a ship out of Little Creek, VA. My mother is Lisa Washington. They were in bootcamp together. Her 1st duty station was in Norfolk,VA. In 1982, something must have happened because my mom could not find Robby to tell him she was pregnant. I have to find him now because he is a grandfather of two beautiful little girls and in case my brother and possibly other siblings have children, I would not want to mix in with my family, not to mention I am still single myself, finding out my lover was my cousin would not be cool. So I am on a wing and a prayer. If anyone knows anything, please contact me @770-873-4900.\n\nBlessings to all!\n\nSHALOM!\n\nKeenya Crawford <atlantis1indigo@yahoo.com>\n\nSnellville, GA USA - Saturday, July 09, 2005 at 16:01:30 (EDT) My friend has searched for sometime for her biological parents.

They lived in England - not sure which county but could be Cheshire or Midlands. I believe my GG's name was Henry Robert Wilkinson and was told he was a musician, so they might have moved around the country. My grandfather & uncle also had this name - my grandfather was also a professional musician (cello), born 1890s, I believe died early 1980s (but my grandparents separated I never knew him). He lived in or near London from 1940s.\n\nMy grandfather had several sisters but was probably the only son. Not sure of all sisters' names, but think one was called Kathleen and possibly an Ivy, Sally, Clara, Ruby. He married Annie Garvey probably around 1915/16, in Wirral. (They had 3 children: Henry Robert, Muriel (my mother) and Irene).\n\nIf any of these names ring a bell with anyone I would love to hear from you\n\nAnn Braben <abraben@westnet.com.au>\n\nBrisbane, Qld Australia - Monday, March 21, 2005 at 21:29:11 (EST) I'm looking for anyone who dated Patsy Wilkinson during the years of 1970 - 1972.\n\nLee <princess959@sbcglobal.net>\n\nUSA - Sunday, March 20, 2005 at 07:55:36 (EST) I'm looking for any relatives in England of...\n\nWalter Wilkinson..married to ..Edna Sallway..these are my grandparents...I believe they came from the Liverpool area..\n\nThey had lots of children ..my aunts and uncles most of which have passed on..includeing my father..Walter Sydney Wilkinson...\n\nI'm the oldest of 7 children...and have 2 boys..both married and we have 2 grandsons...\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who might be related to us...Granddad and Grandmom are both gone now ..but they lived their entire lives in the Ottawa area...\n\nThanks for your time and help...\n\nWalter Harold Wilkinson <wwilkinson@cogeco.ca>\n\nWindsor, Ont Canada - Saturday, March 19, 2005 at 05:59:48 (EST) I was born in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, Uk on July 30th 1946, I have no siblings, I lived and worked in this area until 2003 when I moved to Canada and set up a management consulting business.

Mark Lawrence Wilkinson passed away on his 48th birthday March 26, 2004 from a sudden unexpected heart attack. Mark would have loved to have had contact with his relatives who are still living in England. He told me stories of his Auntie Kathleen and others who I would have loved to meet. If you relatives are out there, Mark was the son of Robert and Patsy Wilkinson who left England in 1962 to Los Angeles CA and then to Orlando, FL where we now reside. I am sorry I don't have better news but I plan to keep the legacy of Mark Wilkinson alive. Mark was an extremely talented songwriter, musician, and singer. He also wrote wonderful stories.

I am trying to find some family members in/around Toronto, Canada. My British Grandfather served with his brother (from Canada, courtesy of Barnados) in the Canadian forces, was injured and sent back to the UK where he lived in Portsmouth. He stayed there until the house in Prince Georges St was destroyed by German bombers. The family moved to Gloucester, where most of them stayed. My father, Les Wilkinson, emigrated to Canada in the early 50's and stayed with an Uncle Bill (my grandfather's brother ?) on Dundas Street. I would imagine that Uncle Bill is dead by now, but if anyone recognises Bill Wilkinson as a relative, please get in touch. Thanks.\n\nSusan Wilkinson-Tyrrell <tyrrells@emirates.net.ae>\n\nDubai, UAE - Wednesday, May 17, 2000 at 05:17:54 (EDT) if any one could help me i have much information on wilkinsons. how do i fill in the information so that they have the facts?\n\ndana gomez <thugOlover@aol.com>\n\nwoodstock, ill - Sunday, May 14, 2000 at 20:09:23 (EDT) hello every one out there.

I found a book on the library shelf that linked my Conerly ancestors to the Wilkinsons. It even traced the maternal lines back to the Kings of England and to Charlemagne. I started months of further research. Many hours spent reading, making photo copies, and web browsing. Then the other day I received a package in the mail that rocked my world. After gathering thousands of names I get this letter that shows it all may have been in vain. I was ready to give up on the Wilkinsons. Then by a strange coincidence, the country music artist 'The Wilkinsons' were playing at a local Blockbuster store. I took the family to go see them. They were GREAT!!! My kids loved Amanda (16) and Steve and Tyler. This made me not so made at the Wilkinson family. So here is what I need help with. A certain William Wilkinson married an Elizabeth Jackson. They had a daughter Mary who married Owen Conerly. I need to know if the parents of William were William Wilkinson and Huldah Godwin or not.

We miss him dearly. He was extreamly exuaghsted one morning because he had been up all night studying the night before and he fell asleep behind the wheel and a big rig carring burrial caskets hit him head-on and killed him instintly. His car a little red Chevrolet Spirit was crushed beyond recondition. Where his body had been you coun not even fit your hand into. His father Sheldon Lee Wilkinson wasn't even allowed to identify his own son's body! That afternoon he was going to move in with his cousins Sheldon Muller, Tony Muller and Grandmother Judith Pearl Wilkinson. The funeral home was PACKED the Paul bearers were 10 min late because of traffic, and they had to stand in the back hall thats how packed the funeral home was! Now the songs: \"I'll be missing you\" by Puff Daddy, \"Crossroads\" by Bonethugs-N-harmony, and \"Wind beneath my wings\" By ?. The way I feel is making it SO hard to put into words. I guess you can see your loved ones one day and not know if you'll see them the next. Now I'll NEVER let another day go by without saying \"I love you\" to anyone. I love you Jason!!!! I found out two days ago that my uncle Sheldon found an autographed baseball in Jason's car he was bringing it down to my Grandmother because she's a HUGE fan of the Minnesota Twins. Jason E.
