[Tacoma News Tribune: 03 March 1960]\n\nWilcoxon, Henry H. -- Died, at Sandusky City, Huron County, on the morning of the 11th. instant, Henry H. Wilcoxon, Esq., formerly a resident of this place, in the 33d. year of his age. The deceased was returning, on the Monday evening previous, in company with his wife and others, from the mouth of [the] Huron River, in a sleigh, when his horse became unruly, commenced kicking, and at length started to run. Mrs. W. with her infant child, jumped from the vehicle and escaped without injury; but Mr. Wilcoxon held to the reins, and it is supposed that by some sudden movement of the horse, he was thrown forward from the sleigh beneath his feet, and in falling, was either kicked in the temple by the horse, or stunned by the concussion -- the body of the sleigh being first found, the runners next, and Mr. W. last, in a state of insensibility, and severely bruised about the head and face. He became, probably, entangled with the lines and the breaking sleigh, and from the marks of blood in the snow, must have been dragged some rods after the fatal blow was received. From the time of the accident to the hour of his departure he lingered in a state of total derangement and insensibility. Thus was this excellent young man, by a sudden and unlooked-for visitation of Providence, cut off in the flower of his days, and at a period when his hopes were the brightest, and his prospects in life the fairest. No even has given to this, or his own community, a severer shock; for no one of his numerous friends or acquaintances but must recall his punctuality and fairness in business; his kind urbanity of manners, whether at home or abroad; his acknowledged decision of character and the gentlemanly deportment which eminently marked his intercourse with the world -- endearing him alike to the friend and the stranger; to the relative and the casual acquaintance. Mr. Wilcoxon had filled with honor and credit to himself, and usefulness to the public the responsible office of Sheriff of this county, as well a various others of a military kind; and at the time of his death held the highly respectable station of Associate Judge of Huron County. In this last office, the increasing confidence of the people in his integrity and business-like talents, gave rich promise that he would continue to deserve the esteem, and secure the respect, of all who in any way approached him. But the ways of Providence are inscrutable, and we bow in submission to its decrees, while we lament the man, and regret that death had not aimed his dart at some less beloved and less useful individual. His remains were brought to this town for interment, and now repose in the Presbyterian grave-yard, by the side of his relatives, who had gone the \"way to dusky death\" before him.

James Madison was then president; Napoleon was on the throne of France, and all Europe was at his feet.

One of the saddest events it has been our duty to record is the death of Mrs. M.W. Williams. Fore more than a year past she has been failing steadily with the dread disease consumption and in the past few weeks has sunk rapidly and her death was expected at any time. She lingered along until 8:40 p.m. Tuesday when she breathed her last. To add to the sad occurrence, her husband was taken very suddenly on Sunday with what Dr. Fackler pronounced the American cholera, and all day Monday the two were lying at death's door and it seemed as though they would both be taken together. On Tuesday Mr. Williams was slightly improved and he was told that his wife could live but a short time. He immediately became worse, but rallied during the afternoon and seemed resigned to the impending loss. Death relieved the wife during the evening and although still alive, Mr. Williams is far from being out of danger. A fourteen-months-old child is left motherless by the sad blow. The babe is a constant care and is far from being well. The remains were taken to the old home of the deceased at Lexington at 9:15 this (Thursday) morning. -- [Mansfield Weekly News: 18 August 1887, Vol. 3, No. 38]\n\nWilliams, Muriel -- Muriel, the 2-year-old daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Charles Williams, died Monday evening at 6:45 o'clock at the home of her parents on Blymyer Avenue. She had been ill for the past few days. The indirect cause of her death is thought to have been from some matches which she found last Wednesday. At this time she had been taking her nap in her crib upstairs and when she awoke, she got hold of some matches which were on a place where it was supposed, of course, they would be out of the way of the children. When Mrs. Williams came upstairs she found what the child had been doing and medical attention was secured. The child had been thought to be getting better, but grew worse instead and passed away Monday evening.

He married a daughter of the notorious Matt Ross several years ago, since which time he has disappeared from the city and from the thoughts of his former friends: John Willis, barkeeper at Mattie Ross' house of ill-fame, died at his home on River Street, at the tunnel, at 12:50 o'clock this afternoon, and the cause of his death is the source of much uneasiness to several individuals At 1 o'clock Tuesday night, September 10, several men knocked at the door of the Ross mansion and asked admittance. The door was opened, but before they entered the landlady and Willis got into a discussion over the matter and when one of the visitors made a remark that Willis didn't like, he (Willis) grasped a heavy cross bar used to fasten the door, and rushed out at them. He struck one of the men and felled him to the ground. One of the others then came to his companion's assistance and struck Willis, knocking him down. Willis walked to his home arriving there he went up stairs and lay down. He complained of a pain in his right temple and soon became unconscious, in which condition he remained most of the time until his death. Willis' mother, Mrs. Mary Willis, a poor widow, living in Mansfield, was summoned and came and stayed with her son during his illness. She is well night of heart broken over the affair. The dead man leaves a widow with a babe in her arms and with prospects of additional family cares in the near future. Coroner Lepper took charge of the body, will hold an inquest tonight and the result of his inquiry will be made public in a few days. The body will be shipped to Ashland, where Willis was born twenty-four years ago the 25th. of last month, for interment tomorrow.

[The Mansfield News: Wednesday, February 12, 1913]\n\nWilson, Americus Alexander -- The very many friends of Americus A. Wilson will be grieved to learn of his death which is announced by a letter just received by his cousin, J. L. Feldler, of Willow street, of this city. A. A. Wilson, or ÂMackÂ as he was called by his associates, is a native of Richland County, born in Worthington Township, about 1853, attended Greentown Academy, where he received a liberal education and engaged in school teaching in this and adjoining counties. Early in the eighties he came to Mansfield and studied law with the firm of Pritchard & Wolfe and was admitted to the bar. W. N. Ruby was his warm friend and associate in the law office and both were admitted to the bar about the same time. They both went to the territory of Washington and entered into the practice of their chosen profession at Colfax, Whitman county, where they continued for a time, then removing to Palouse twenty miles away. They separated, Mr. Ruby going to Colorado Springs where he now is, and Mr. Wilson after some years, going to Ashland, Ore., where he has since made his home and where he died Jan. 28. After settling at Colfax, Mr. Wilson came back to his old Perrysville home and married Miss Jennie Humphreys, who joined with him in his far-western home, but they were soon separated by her early death. He afterwards married a Washington lady, by whom he had three children, and death again separated them by taking away the mother of his children. His removal from Palouse occurred about the year 1907 and was intended as a change beneficial to his late wife, whose health was failing. He is survived by his children, his sister, Agnes, of Denver, Col., a brother, Calvin, and another sister, Mrs. Harper, who live in the far west. Those who knew him best, will remember ÂMackÂ Wilson and fondly cherish his sterling qualities that commanded respect at every turn. The writer of this notice regrets his inability to give more minute details of this worthy friend and brother. N. M. W. Submitted by Faye and Jean.

The young man's name is Arlo Wilson and he was 21 years of age. A Cleveland paper publishes a cut of the young man and some facts in regard to his career in the Forest City. Some trouble was experienced in identifying the young man until his parents sent a photograph of him. [Semi-Weekly News: 20 October 1896, Vol. 12, No. 85]\n\nWilson, Arlo -- Butler. It was a sad duty that called Oscar Wilson to Cleveland last Thursday. A telegram had been received here by John Wilson stating that Walter A. Wilson was dead at Cleveland and asking what disposal should be made of the body. John Wilson has a son Walter, but he is at home at present, Knowing that Oscar Wilson had a son Arlo in Cleveland, he turned the telegram over to him. This resulted in Oscar Wilson taking a trip to Cleveland where he ascertained that the dead boy was his own son, but his remains had been buried in potter's field previous to his arrival in the city. It seems that Arlo had changed his name to Walter on his leaving home, hence the difficulty in recognizing the name. Mr. Wilson returned home from Cleveland Friday night. The facts of the sad ending of Arlo Wilson are about as follows: He left his home in this place about a year and a half ago. For some time he was in Mansfield, but some difficulty occasioned his departure from that city and when next heard from he was in Cleveland. Up to a few weeks ago Arlo was waiting table in a restaurant, where he became infatuated with a waiter girl. They became rather intimate and the intimacy resulted in the couple occupying a suite of rooms as man and wife. It appears from what the girl says of the affair that Arlo urged her to marry him, but the request was refused repeatedly. Becoming despondent because the girl would not accede to his wishes he procured some poison and took it with suicidal intent while lying very ill with diphtheria. The girl refused to nurse him when he became so ill that it was plain that death was a question of only a few hours, and left him. It is not known if he was alone when he died or not. The girl appeared to feel no compunction when relating to the father the untimely fate of his son, who was only about 19 years of age. The father and mother have the heartfelt sympathy of all the citizens of Butler in their sad bereavement. The wayward young man had many warm friends in Mansfield and this place who will regret to learn of his sad fate.

Mrs. Wilson was taken ill about four weeks ago with influenza. Complications resulting caused her death yesterday. Wednesday morning she realized her condition was very critical and told the members of the family that she was going. Death came in the afternoon as she had predicted. Miss Bessie V. Horner was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. D. (Lorenzo Dow) Horner and was born in Shelby August 21st, 1883. She was aged 41 years, 8 months and 2 days at the time of her death. She grew to womanhood in Shelby and was united in marriage to C. W. (Charles William) Wilson November 4th, 1905. They went to housekeeping in Shelby and continued to reside here. They were the parents of two children Charles Ned Wilson, who died April 24, 1917 and Billy Ward Wilson, who with his father survives. Mrs. Wilson is also survived by her father, mother, two sisters Mrs. Herman Dick of Cleveland and Mrs, Lloyd Stiner of Shelby and six brothers Boyd Horner of Fostoria, Frank, John, Dow and Ralph of Shelby and James of Chicago.

[MNJ 9/1/1955]\n\nWilson, Dallas Dane\n\nWilson, Daniel Webster -- Without the presence of a relative of the deceased the body of the late Capt. Daniel Webster Wilson was consigned to the vault in the Bellville Cemetery Monday afternoon. But even though he was the last of his family living in Richland County, the last sad rites were not devoid of any of those signs and tokens of love and respect which are usually found when the bier of the departed is surrounded by a large family connection. Indeed, the funeral was one of the largest ever held in Bellville, there being present besides almost the whole population of Bellville, large delegations from Mansfield, Lexington, Butler and the country around. On every side were the evidence of love and respect towards the deceased and signs of sincere regret for the loss sustained by the community. The remains in a handsome casket surrounded by masses of beautiful flowers, roses, lilies, carnations, etc., the gifts of loving friends, lay in state Sunday and Monday in All Souls Universalist church and were viewed by a constant procession of sorrowing neighbors and friends. When the funeral services began at one o'clock p.m. the auditorium of the church was filled to overflowing and many were unable to gain entrance. The casket was placed in front of the minister's stand and the large choir occupied the space at the rear of the stand. The entire nave of the church was filled with the G.A.R. veterans and the Masonic brothers of the deceased, the survivors of the company commanded by the deceased during the civil war -- Co. E, 32nd. O.V.I. -- occupying a place of honor. Both transepts of the church and the aisles were filled to overflowing with friends and neighbors. The services were conducted by the pastor of the church, Rev. N.R. Spicer, a personal friend of the deceased, and were impressive by their simplicity and by the evidences of deep feeling underlying them. In concluding the sermon Mr. Spicer stated that the deceased had been opposed to eulogies at funerals and he would respect that sentiment. Nevertheless he could not refrain from referring to the deeply religious character of the departed, although he had not identified himself with any church. During the minister's pastorate of a year the deceased had never missed a service and in him the poor and distressed had always found a friend and helper. Upon the conclusion of Rev. Mr. Spicer's address, the casket was taken in charge by the Worshipful Master of Bellville lodge F. and A.M. The solemn ritual of that order was partially recited in the church, and then the funeral procession formed and accompanied the remains to the cemetery where the Masonic rites were concluded and the casket containing the body of the departed brother was committed to the vault. The casket will remain in the vault for a space of three months and will then be buried in the family lot. The following named persons were chosen as pallbearers: Dr. J.P. Lowe, Ault Black, G.J. Ewers, Harry Farber, Wm. Baumonk and L.F. Kochheiser.

Thus has passed away another of the original pioneers of Shelby. There are still others remaining, but they came into the country subsequent to the time that Mr. Wilson took up his residence in this locality. It has been our privilege, to have much intercourse with the deceased since we have become a resident of Shelby, and think it now out of place to give a somewhat extended notice of his history, as gathered from a memorandum handed to us, as well as from himself during our business relations with him. Mr. Wilson was born on the 29th. of August, 1789 in Weston, Fairfield County, Conn., of \"poor parentage\", and was \"bound out\" until he became 14 years of age. He was afterwards apprenticed to learn the carpenter trade, which he followed until the war of 1812 -- at which time he was twenty-three years of age. He was married to Mabel Barnes, October 10th. 1807, with whom he lived until December 10th., 1868, when she died -- living together over 60 years. Upon the breaking out of the war of 1812, he enlisted in the 25th. Regiment, U.S.A., raised at Hartford, Conn., leaving that place for Burlington, Vt., on Oct. 1st. On the march he was taken sick and left at Cambridge, New York, until December, when he was ordered to return with Captain Bradley to recruit a second company. In the Spring of 1813, they again rejoined their regiment then stationed within four miles of Lake Ontario. A short time afterwards, they crossed the Niagara River to attack Ft. George on the Canada side. They landed under a heavy fire of musketry and a 24 pounder, and formed their lines, but were driven back several times. After a severe engagement they succeeded in capturing the Fort. The enemy blew up the magazine and took the road to the Lewistown Heights. The next day they followed the enemy, but not succeeding in overtaking them, they returned to the Fort and remained there until October following, in the mean time they were engaged at various times in skirmishes with the enemy. About that time an expedition was organized for the purpose of taking Montreal. They collected about three hundred boats in which the army embarked. They proceeded down the lake as far as Granadon Island, which is near Sackett's Harbor at the head of the St. Lawrence, where they remained six days, and then re-embarked and again proceeded down the St. Lawrence River -- passing eight guns, under heavy fire, of two hours duration. They proceeded on down the river, and had several sharp engagements. Mr. Wilson had been several months on board, previous to those engagements -- and in one of them the Americans lost two of their vessels. The Americans were defeated -- lost quite a number, killed and wounded and were finally compelled to abandon their campaign. At French Mills the Americans were to have been joined by Gen. Hampton's Army, which now had been withdrawn to Plattsburg on account of the dispute between two Generals as to who should command the forces. In consequence of which the troops, with whom Mr. Wilson served, were compelled to go into winter quarters. In February following was discharged, took up his march for Burlington Vermont, where he was paid, and mustered out of service. He now again commenced to work at his trade, until the year 1818 when a company was formed in his neighborhood to emigrate to the State of Ohio. They made the journey all the way in wagons, crossing the Allegheny mountains, and arrived here about the 20th. of April 1818. He first purchased the land on which West Shelby now stands and erected his house thereon. He remained on the same about six years, making some improvements, and then sold it to James Gamble. He immediately afterwards purchased the quarter section which he owned until his decease, except such as he sold from time to time, in laying out additions to the village of Shelby. At the time of his first settlement here, this was then a part of Bloominggrove Township, but afterwards was divided, and Sharon Township erected, leaving Mr. Wilson and the late Stephen Marvin, the first settlers within the limits of what is now Sharon township. The county was then an unbroken wilderness, but gradually others, whose names are familiar to many of our citizen, came and settled around those early pioneers, until by their united enterprise and industry, the village has grown to its present importance and the country surrounding it became peculiarly productive and beautiful. In the location of the S.M. & N.R.R. particular credit is due to the energy and labors of Mr. Wilson. When the charter was applied for, he was made one of the commissioners, to form the company. Then commenced the agitation in regard to the location of the Rail Road. The citizens of Mansfield and vicinity were in favor of the route through Ganges, and would think of no other. Mr. Wilson at length insisted, that those having the matter in charge, should at least ride along the route proposed by him by way of Shelby, before locating it elsewhere. So soon as the Engineer passed over the Shelby route, to the surprise of all concerned, he declared it to be the most practicable and cheapest route, and finally it was located thereon. Mr. Wilson was a Mason, and was buried by the Fraternity on Saturday the 19th. of June. The following proceedings of Shelby Lodge F.A. & A.M. reported by a committee, were ordered to be spread upon the records of the Lodge.
