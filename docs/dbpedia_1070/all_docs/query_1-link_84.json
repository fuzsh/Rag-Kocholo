He relieved a slip in the roof and a fall of roof occurred. A short plank and two single props were canted out. He was caught by a stone weighing about 30 cwts. and sustained a fractured spine from which he died almost immediately [His father (Joseph William) had been killed in the same pit in 1919]\n\nThis is a low resolution image for web display, if you would like to have a higher resolution image, then please us quoting reference T-03053-06-0002 and we will make the image available on a temporary page for you to access."
