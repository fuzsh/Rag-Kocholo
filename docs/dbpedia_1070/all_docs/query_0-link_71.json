I never won any huge honors in track or cross country, but even years later I still love running. I will be running in my 6th Half Marathon. I couldn't have asked for a better coach and amazing man for a high school student to look up to you. Tomorrow morning I am running in the Battleship Half Marathon in Wilmington, NC. This one is for you Coach! To his family, I graduated Solon Class of 2002, I appreciated you all sharing such a great coach with us at Solon!\n\nJesse Macht\n\nNovember 3, 2012\n\nCoach Wilkinson was the most wonderful man and coach. I was on his track team in the 60's and it was one of the highlights of my life. He was able to bring out the best in his teams and each individual. He helped us to accomplish what we did not think we could. I also think the world of Peg, as my art teacher back then. Please accept my sympathy for your great loss. Your loving student, Bonnie Malecek Pitz\n\nBonnie Malecek Pitz\n\nFebruary 3, 2012\n\nDear Wilkinson Family, Ever will another individual with a heart as big as his laugh and smile touch so many young people in a lifetime? Coach Wilk left a footprint within me as a young person and I still carry that print with me 40-some years later. He was a teacher of life. I share your in your sorrow in the loss of a most wonderful man. My prayers are with you.

Was shocked to hear of Harold;s passing. We grew up about 1/4 mi. apart. Really appreciated the picture Harold sent of our childhood get-together at his house. I played football with Harold in high school. He was a great athlete. Considered it a privilege to have known Harold. May God bless you and your family.\n\nMax Meadows\n\nJanuary 12, 2012\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with you at this difficult time.I went to school with Harold.Max Meadows\n\nMax Meadows\n\nJanuary 4, 2012\n\nDear Peg and family,\n\nWords cannot express all that Harold ment to me. He touched my life by believing in me. I wanted to achieve my best in all things because of his ablility to encourage people. I am so thankful to have been a part of his life. His life lives on in me and I pass on what I've received to the people I care about. God Bless you and your family during this difficult time of grieving. My thoughts are with you all.\n\nDawn Johnson Vircks\n\nKennedy 75\n\nDawn Johnson Vircks\n\nJanuary 1, 2012\n\nThe world has lost a star. Coach Wilkenson touched thousands of lives and was my number one role model. He cared about more than winning, he cared about what was inside a person and how to pull out the best. He was the greatest motivator I ever met. My 33 years in education was largely in part to him. He is running with the Lord and playing with the angels. Thank you Peggy for sharing himxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSudsy\n\nSusan Palmer\n\nDecember 27, 2011\n\nPeggy, We were deep;y saddened to hear of Harold's passing. Our love and condolances to you and your family.\n\nAny athletic abilities and prowess that I may have ever possessed, I owe largely to Harold. He had a way to inspire, incourage, and even push me, to be better. I really appreciated the few opportunities in the last year to see and talk with both of you. May Heavenly Father bless your family.\n\nJerry and ElaineTubaugh\n\nDecember 25, 2011\n\nWilk was one of my favorite PE Teachers of all time. What a great man.

He brought out the best in his student-athletes and taught us good sportmanship along the way. What a positive role model! Please accept the condolences and sympathy of the Mick family.\n\nLori Mick\n\nDecember 17, 2011\n\nDear Peg and family, My deepest condolences upon your great loss. Wilk had a profound effect upon every life he touched. As mentioned in other memorials, people in BP still remember and talk about Coach Wilk. I apologize for not attending the funeral as I just found out about his passing. I talk about him so much that my grown daughter called me from school when she heard someone discussing his passing and knew I did not know. We were all blessed by his friendship. I'll never forget his smile! :)\n\nVicki Kress Schwab\n\nDecember 17, 2011\n\nPeg, Mike, Blake & Codi,\n\nI was so sorry to hear about your loss. Wilk is just one of those priceless pieces of so many of our lives.\n\nI remember meeting him as Codi & Blake's dad from when we all went to youth group at St. Paul's and was so glad he remembered me when I got to JFK. I enjoyed him so much as my basketball coach there and a couple of times as my P.E. teacher. He was everything you could have hoped for as a coach and teacher; patient, caring, knowledgable, humble & had a great sense of humor. I know us basketball girls loved to make him smile when we did our renditions of \"Love is a Battlefield\" while we were supposed to be stretching. He was also always trying to convince us to go out for cross country since we were switching to 5 on 5. What a motivator!\n\nHe truly, truly is my favorite staff member from JFK and the standard I have tried to set in my ten years of coaching and for my children's coaches. You just have to smile when you think about what he is now accomplishing with Heaven's team. My mom, Carma Lou, also sends her condolences. Our prayers are with your family during this difficult time.\n\nChristie INSERT INTO guestbook VALUES (Beck) Hurd\n\nDecember 16, 2011\n\nPeg: Just a note to tell you that my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.

Gingie\n\nGingie Hunstad\n\nDecember 15, 2011\n\nI never had the pleasure of meeting Harold, but I've had the great honor and privilege of being friends with his son Blake. If the old saying \"the apple doesn't fall far from the tree\" is true, Harold was an outstanding man. It's our loss to not have him with us, but heaven's gain.\n\nRick Thoreson\n\nDecember 15, 2011\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Wilkinson's family at this difficult time. He was a wonderfully kind man.\n\nTrisha Tefer Wisebaker\n\nDecember 15, 2011\n\nLong live the Coach.\n\nI have fond memories of you as well, Class of '83. I was recently grateful to see him this summer, what a great feeling. My hearts go out to the Wilkinson family, God Bless\n\nRebecca Coffin\n\nDecember 14, 2011\n\nCoach Wilk saw in people what others didnt see. He saw something in me. With his encouragement & support I was able to be part of his track team 1978-1980 we went to state every year. He inspired me to look for something special in everyone. I began my coaching career in 1982 and am still coaching today! I think of him talk of him and share the booklets Peg made for us every year. He had a large part of making me who I am. His legacy will live on in the kids I coach as he was my teacher. Thank you Peg for sharing him with us.\n\nDeanna INSERT INTO guestbook VALUES (Glover) Krause\n\nDecember 14, 2011\n\nMy heartfelt sympathy goes out to Mrs. Wilkinson and family for the loss of a great man. We knew him as \"Wilk\" in Belle Plaine, who mentored and inspired us young impressionable students in the best way possible, on and off the football field. I have many fond memories of those days. My only regret is waiting 41 years to organize a football team reunion, and missing him this past October. He will truly be missed by all he touched. Best regards.\n\nGreg Pech\n\nDecember 14, 2011\n\nCoach Wilkinson and Family,\n\nWilke was the most inspirational Coach I've ever had. Thank you for sharing this amazing man with myself and so many others. The twinkle in his eye and smile encouraged me to do my best. God knows I wasn't the most talented athlete in the world, however he knew how to push me to my limit.\n\nI remember the time when he talked me into going out for track so that I could experience the Drake Relays as a competitor. I will never forget that year and how he was so right! Coach Wilke will continue to be a legend and a blessing to everyone who was fortunate enough to have met him.\n\nClass of 84 !!\n\nkristy loftus\n\nDecember 13, 2011\n\nSorry to be so slow. Harold was a high school rival as I went to Oregon High School, a few miles from Mound City. We remember he ended our long winning streak in 6 man footballl with a drop kick extra point. He was a great competitior We came to Iowa about the same time and I saw him ocassionally as I was a coach them school administrator. He was a great coach, a true gentleman and a nice guy.\n\nHe will be missed\n\nSteve Williams\n\nDecember 13, 2011\n\nI know I speak for the parents of anyone of us who currently have or had a daughter participating in Solon track, when I say that Harold Wilkinson was a modern day angel looking down upon our daughters. He always had that spirit of competition, but the love that he displayed for our children was always foremost in his life. By the sounds of the prior posts...that was simply Coach Wilk throughout his entire career; always putting the kids first. Thanks for the countless hours you have invested and the life-long influence that you have been for our Lady Spartans. Sadly, your biggest race on earth has come to an end, but there is no doubt in our minds as to where you finished. Our deepest condolences to the entire Wilkinson family and our most sincerest appreciation for sharing with our daughters such a wonderful man.

He will greatly be missed, touched so many lives, in so many ways.\n\nSusie Popelka Klenk\n\nDecember 13, 2011\n\nWe were so sorry to hear of Harold's passing. He was a very great man. We enjoyed our few short years of Cody being our neighbor. Our sympathy goes out to the family. God's Blessings, Jeff and Christy\n\nJeff and Christy Livengood\n\nDecember 12, 2011\n\nThe outpouring of love and support on this tribute demonstrates something we always knew, which was Wilk was a very special man.\n\nI'll never forget his smile and laugh, along with that twinkle in his eye.\n\nHe lives on as an inspiration and role model, as well in the hearts of all who came into contact with him.\n\nKent Wasson\n\nDecember 12, 2011\n\nTo the whole Wilkinson Family, I remember Harold from the days we all lived on Skyline Dr, he use to give us such a hard time,and he laughed the whole time, but we loved it, he was such a great guy.

He truly left a legacy in the lives of many student-athletes & coaches. What a great example he was to so many and what a great leader of young people! I was truly blessed to have known him and to have followed his coaching career over the years.\n\nI was truly moved at the funeral today. He was one of a kind. I wish we had more coaches like him.\n\nMay the entire Wilkinson family be comforted by the knowledge that our separation from loved ones is only temporary through a faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nCarl Gonder\n\nCarl Gonder\n\nDecember 12, 2011\n\nI'm saddened to learn of Harold's passing.\n\nI have many fond memories of Harold. Harold was my physical education teacher and one of my football coaches in Belle Plaine in the 1960's. I quickly grew to respect and admire him. Harold gave me inspiration to be a better athlete and a better human being. Harold never forgot his students, nor his athletes, nor the people and the communities he so faithfully served. I remember Harold and Peg attending our class reunion in Belle Plaine in 2000 and Harold and Peg attending my retirement reception at the Belle Plaine Community Center 2 years ago, and their warm reception when I stopped by their home this past summer. All wonderful memories that will be with me for all the remaining days of my life.\n\nThank you, Harold, for making a positive difference in the lives of thousands of people.\n\nAlso, my sympathies to Harold's family. My thoughts and prayers are with you.\n\nMay God bless.\n\nJames A.

It was a wonderful surprise to meet up with you and Coach again in Cedar Rapids...one that I treasure.\n\nCarol Sundberg\n\nDecember 12, 2011\n\nDear Peg and family,\n\nWilk was one of the impressive coaches and teachers who developed our son and daughter into who they are today. They were just 2 of the many athletes and students he treated in the same caring way. Each athlete got the same investment of his attention. That included not just the first runner across the finish line but the last runner to cross, even if that runner was minutes behind the pack. Wilk was special, and anything else we would add would echo all that has so caringly been written above. However, we would add Wilk was also a mentor and coach to all the parents of the athletes he coached. He modeled not only how to coach but how to parent. Though he is no longer with us, his spirit continues to live in the athletes and parents that he touched.\n\nPeace be with you,\n\nJohn and Alice Wasson\n\nJohn & Alice Wasson\n\nDecember 12, 2011\n\nDear Peg and family.I was saddened to learn of Harold's passing.I always enjoyed talking with him and well remember our last conversation.Truly a good man he will be greatly missed.May you find peace and comfort in the days ahead.We were all so blessed to know him.\n\nBill Wallace\n\nDecember 12, 2011\n\n..as I was ststing before...when \"Wilk\" approached my son and I INSERT INTO guestbook VALUES (at the Minneapolis airport) I was stunned that he ran out from his seat , yelling my name.

Garthwaite) Coach Wilkinson pushed all of his student athletes to be all they could be. He never expected anything more from us than what he expected from himself. I remember going up against him one-on-one, he continued to push to have us reach down deep and pull out what he could see in us. I didn’t really understand until I had kids and others that I was working with. When I could see they had it in them, they had all of the necessary components; they just needed to want it. Coach worked hard to get us to reach down and find it, use it. He always made me feel good about myself as an athlete, that it INSERT INTO guestbook VALUES (whatever it was)was possible, I just had to work for it INSERT INTO guestbook VALUES (practice, practice, practice)!

He kept a lot of kids out of trouble.\n\nI am so glad that I had the chance to reconnect with him this past year when my mom sent me the 50th anniversary notice from the newspaper. We emailed over several months, but he never mentioned he was sick.\n\nDespite 30 years, he remembered and asked about all 4 Galles kids who attended JFK and even knew about my niece who ran track at WDM Valley. He said that he made a point to watch her run at State because he \"knew she must belong to one of you Galles kids.\" Pretty amazing that he remembered and cared enough to watch.\n\nMy heart goes out to his family.

He had a most remarkable way of connecting with his athletes and could also turn out victory after victory. I ran for Rolfe HS and we were rivals with Belle Plaine but he was always so kind and encouraging to me. He coached me when I was on the USTFF teams and his support was so wonderful..We were in the MVC together when I coached at IC West and I enjoyed the relationship then again. The last time I saw him I was coaching at Iowa and I met him at the airport. I was taking runners to Junior Nationals. He gave me the thumbs up and said \"Go Hawkeyes!\". I will forever remember his kindness and the impact he made on my life. I'm sure he has touched others in the same way. He was a premier coach and a wonderful person.

The most memorable memory I had was in 1986 during the last three days of school of my junior year, when another student and I set off fireworks down by the boys locker room when it was full of students and took off running. I went running one way and the other student went another way and Mr. Wilk caught me in the North Parking Lot with his big smile and yelled \"Blackie\" what did you do? I said nothing and he put his arm around and walked me down to the office with a smile on face. Oh and by the way, my oldest brother was the wrestling coach,\"Coach Blackwell.\" At the beginning of my senior year, Mr. Wilk asked me if I had any fireworks. Was the best first day of my senior year. He was the best and will be missed. I send his family my condolence.
