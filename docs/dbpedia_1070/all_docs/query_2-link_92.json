        "text": "Over the fourteen year period of the carving, 1927 to 1941, almost 400 workers, men and women, labored at the memorial. The work was hard, the hours long, the pay low, and periods of employment uncertain. Despite harsh and dangerous conditions, there were no fatalities during the carving work. For some of these people the work was just a job, but for others it became a special calling.\n\n“More and more we sensed we were creating a truly great thing, and after a while all of us old hands became truly dedicated to it.”\n\nRed Anderson, Mount Rushmore Carver"
