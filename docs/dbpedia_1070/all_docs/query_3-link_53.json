        "text": "Our mom, Betty, died peacefully with medical assistance on July 12, 2024, at home in Victoria, BC, surrounded by family. Born to Arthur and Stella Butcher on November 3, 1937, in Sackville, NB, Betty is predeceased by her husband, Peter (2017) and survived by her daughter Kathy (Rae) of Victoria, and son Dave and grandson Max, both of Courtenay, BC. She cared for her family with much love and a patient, generous spirit, and she will be missed deeply. Betty is also survived by her older sister Evelyn Wilkinson of Mississauga, ON and extended family across the country.\n\nBetty married Peter in 1961, and together, they moved around Canada and the world until they retired to Victoria in 1992. Some highlights from Betty’s life overseas include her volunteer work at the Nairobi National Museum in Kenya; her hosting of superb dinner parties in Lagos, Nigeria; and her numerous visits to historical sites in Egypt. Betty and Peter embraced their time in Africa and were forever shaped by the experience. During her retirement, Betty was most recently president of Chapter AR, P.E.O., a global sisterhood of women with the mission of helping women around the world advance through education. She also volunteered with Vancouver Island Lodge (Canadian Cancer Society) and UNICEF. Betty was skilled in many crafts such as paper arts, knitting, quilting, sewing and ikebana. As well, she was a great cook, devoted yoga practitioner and avid reader. She has left so many lasting impressions, and we will carry her memory always.\n\nAt Betty’s request, a private cremation and interment has been arranged.\n\nDonations may be made to BC Cancer Agency, 2410 Lee Avenue, Victoria, BC, V8R6V5, or to P.E.O. Program for Continuing Education.\n\nCondolences may be offered to the family below."
