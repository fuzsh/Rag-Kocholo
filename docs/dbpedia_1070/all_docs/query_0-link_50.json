These have been abstracted by members of the Albany County Genealogical Society. Obituaries are of present or past Albany County residents, those who died in Albany County, or those who have been buried in Albany County. These have been compiled by the Albany County Genealogical Society and abstracted from the Laramie newspapers and microfilm found in the Albany County Library. The listings are alphabetical by surname. Whenever possible, the maiden name of the wife is included and is listed in the surname index (see below). Normally all obituary notices of an individual are listed.\n\nFor listing of obituaries and burials for records from 1870 to 1900, the reader may wish to reference \"Laramie, Wyoming Burials 1867 to 1900\" by Ellen (Crago) Mueller, [WYO 929.1 M887a] in the Albany County Library. The dates given by Mueller were often dates of death and not of newspaper issues. She includes cemetery and church records which were not abstracted and may not be included in this present listing.\n\nLaramie Newspapers have been indexed by Elnora Frye for the years 1868-1899, by the Albany County Genealogical Society for the years 1900-1940, and 1941-1957 and can be found in bound volumes in the Albany County Library, Laramie Plains Museum, and the Coe Library, University of Wyoming.\n\nFor this present listing, the newspaper is coded as LDB-Laramie Daily Boomerang (1958-1968). Many newspapers have been added to this digital collection for research\n\nMarried women are cross indexed by maiden name when it is known. The newspaper code, page, column, and date of appearance(s) are given for each occurrence of the appearance in the newspaper. Whenever possible, maiden names of married women are included. The names of successors, siblings, aunts, uncles, parents, and grandparents have not been included.\n\nThe listing for a married woman would appear as follows:\n\nSurname, First name Newspaper, Pg, Col, Yr-Mo-Day\n\nPASCOE, Ann Eliza - nee Entwistle LDR 1 5 1913-04-16\n\n(this is listed by her married name)\n\nENTWISTLE, Ann Eliza - m. Pascoe LDR 1 5 1913-04-16\n\n(this is the listing by her maiden name and gives her married name)\n\nFormer residents who died in other cities or states are included.\n\nThe following list was compiled and edited by Leroy R. Maki, June 2001. All rights reserved."
