During Leibniz's time as court librarian, the Leibnizhaus housed the famous and extensive court library, which was a precursor of today's Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library. In 1753, the actor August Wilhelm Iffland was born in the historic Leibnizhaus. In his memoirs and letters, the artist describes the house as the setting and stage of his childhood and adolescence.

During the Second World War (1943), the magnificent and historic building was destroyed in an air raid.

In 1983, the building was reopened at its present location in the centre of the historic old town of Hannover, as a guest and conference house for higher education institutions in Hannover. When the house was rebuilt, the early Baroque era façade from 1652 was reconstructed. Since 2010, the Leibnizhaus is part of the network “Internationale Begegnungszentren und Hochschulnahe Gästehäuser in Deutschland” (IBZ).
