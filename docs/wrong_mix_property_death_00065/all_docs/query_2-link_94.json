        "text": "Prof. Dr. Veronika Eyring\n\n2021\n\nProfessor Veronika Eyring from the Faculty of Physics/Electrical Engineering and the German Aerospace Center Bremen (DLR) has received the 2021 Leibniz Prize from the German Research Foundation for outstanding work in the field of climate modelling. Veronika Eyring has significantly contributed to the understanding of climate forecasts by means of process-oriented modelling and model evaluation and the improvement thereof.\n\nProf. Dr.-Ing. habil. Lutz Mädler\n\n2016\n\nProfessor Lutz Mädler, process engineer in the Department of Production Engineering at the University of Bremen, receives the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize 2017 from the German Research Foundation (DFG) for his outstanding work in the field of mechanical process engineering. This was announced by the DFG in December 2016. The most prestigious German science prize is endowed with 2.5 million euros.\n\nProf. Dr. Nicole Dubilier\n\n2014\n\nThe Bremen marine researcher receives the Leibniz Prize in recognition of her research on symbioses between micro-organisms and marine animals. The Professor for Microbial Symbioses is also Director of the Bremen Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology and project leader at MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen.\n\nProf. Dr. Kai-Uwe Hinrichs\n\n2011\n\nProfessor Kai-Uwe Hinrichs and his team are investigating the role marine micro-organisms play in the carbon cycle which is so important for the Earth’s climate. Their interdisciplinary research combines geoscientific approaches with analytical chemical and microbial procedures.\n\nProf. Dr. Antje Boetius\n\n2009\n\nThe Bremen marine biologist focusses on microorganisms and their impact on the climate worldwide. Prof. Boetius was the first to proof certain symbioses on the ocean's ground.\n\nProf. Dr.-Ing. habil. Frank Vollertsen\n\n2002\n\nIn 2002, Professor Frank Vollertsen received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize for his interdisciplinary research which combines material science, laser technique and manufacturing technologies. In the scope of a DFG program of emphasis, his research project \"Forming of structured plate with multiple membranes\"offered new scientific findings. The engineering scientist is working at the BIAS - Bremer Institut für angewandte Strahltechnik.\n\nProf. Dr.-Ing. habil. Prof. h.c. Dr.-Ing. E. h. Ekkard Brinksmeier\n\n1999\n\nEkkard Brinksmeier, Professor for Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Bremen was the first Bremen researcher to be awarded with the Leibniz Prize by the Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [German Research Foundation]. The Prize is endowed with 3 million Deutschmark and is thereby the highest-paying award for research in Germany. Brinksmeier received the Prize for his research in the area of material and manufacturing processes. \"His work builds bridges between basic research and industrial application,\" says the jury."
