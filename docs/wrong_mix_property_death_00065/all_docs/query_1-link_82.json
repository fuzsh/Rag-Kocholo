        "text": "2024: Dmitri Efetov\n\nExperimental Solid State Physics\n\nDmitri Efetov is a pioneer in manufacturing highly homogeneous âmagic-angleâ graphene. If you twist two layers of graphene to a certain âmagicâ angle in relation to each other, you get a variety of exotic quantum phases with new physical phenomena such as superconducting, magnetic, and isolating states, the properties of which Dmitri Efetov studies.\n\n2022: Karen Radner\n\nAncient History of the Near and Middle East\n\nKaren Radner is studying the early history and culture of the Near and Middle East. In thematically diverse and interdisciplinary projects, Karen Radner looks into the elements of early forms of power politics as well as the dynamics of settlement development and the evidence of early advanced civilization.\n\n2017: Veit Hornung\n\nProfessor of Immunology\n\nVeit Hornung studies the workings of the innate immune system, the bodyâs first line of defense against pathogens. His research work contributes in particular to the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.\n\n2016: Karl-Peter Hopfner\n\nProfessor of Biochemistry\n\nKarl-Peter Hopfner received the Leibniz Prize for his outstanding work in structural molecular biology and genome biology, with which he has made pioneering contributions to the field of DNA repair and the cellular detection of foreign nucleic acids.\n\nPortrait on DFG's website\n\n2013: Erika von Mutius\n\nProfessor of Pediatric Allergology at LMU and Senior Consultant at Dr. von Hauner Childrenâs Hospital\n\nErika von Mutius won a Leibniz Prize for her ground-breaking insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of childhood asthma and allergies.\n\nPortrait on DFG's website\n\n2010: Christoph Klein\n\nChristoph Klein, Director of the Pediatric Clinic and Outpatient Clinic in the Dr. von Hauner Childrenâs Hospital **\n\nChristoph Klein studies the molecular mechanisms that underlie rare genetic diseases which disrupt blood-cell differentiation and immune-cell function, as a basis for the development of effective therapies for these conditions.\n\nPortrait on DFG's website\n\n2007: Magdalena Goetz\n\nProfessor of Physiological Genomics\n\nThe seminal work of Magdalena GÃ¶tz on the genesis of nerve cells in the mammalian brain has had a major impact on the understanding of stem cell behavior in general, and on efforts to manipulate the differentiation of neural stem cells in a controlled manner.\n\n2007: Oliver Primavesi\n\nProfessor of Greek Philology\n\nClassical scholar Oliver Primavesi works at the interface between Greek philology and the philosophy of the Ancient Greeks. His pioneering research has provided the basis for the reconstruction of Aristotleâs lost work on the Pythagoreans, and for a new interpretation of the writings of Empedokles.\n\n2006: Patrick Cramer\n\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Managing Director of the Gene Center *\n\nPatrick Cramer Professor Cramer's elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase II stands as a major advance in cell biology. This key enzyme is one of the largest molecular machines in the cell nucleus, and is essential for protein synthesis.\n\n2006: Ferenc Krausz\n\nProfessor of Experimental Physics\n\nFerenc Krausz is regarded as the founder of the field now known as attoscience, which is based on techniques that enable the ultrafast motions of electrons within atoms to be observed in real time.\n\n2005: Peter Becker\n\nProfessor of Molecular Biology\n\nPeter Becker Professor Becker's discovery of a novel underlying principle for the dynamic behavior of chromatin is of fundamental significance for the understanding of gene activity, carcinogenesis and embryonic development.\n\n2005: Immanuel F. Bloch\n\nQuantum Optics **\n\nImmanuel Bloch was the first experimental physicist to demonstrate that a Bose-Einstein condensate could be converted by means of laser radiation, and in a controlled fashion, into a new state of matter with very different properties. This breakthrough is of great interest for, among other things, the development of quantum computers.\n\n2004: Thomas Carell\n\nProfessor of Organic Chemistry\n\nThomas Carell Professor Carell's work on DNA repair has potential applications in the treatment of cancer, while his research on electron transport is of crucial importance to the field of photonics. His interdisciplinary approach thus spans the spectrum from synthetic chemistry to molecular biology to medicine.\n\n2004: JÃ¼rgen Soll\n\nProfessor of Molecular Cell Biology of Plants (shared with the Freiburg researcher Prof. Dr. Nikolaus Pfanner)\n\nThe research findings made by Nikolaus Pfanner and JÃ¼rgen Soll have made a major contribution to our understanding of protein import into the various subcellular compartments present in the cells of higher organisms.\n\n2002: Christian Haass\n\nProfessor of Biochemistry\n\nThe work of Christian Haass on the molecular and cell biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis ofneurodegenerative diseases has ensured a leading position for German research groups in this burgeoning field.\n\nPortrait on DFG's website\n\n2001: Jochen Feldmann\n\nPhotonik und Optoelektronik\n\nJochen Feldmann studies the optical and electronic properties of novel inorganic and organic materials. His work has had a profound influence on both basic and applied research in the field.\n\n2001: Arthur Konnerth\n\nInstitute of Physiology *\n\nThe work of Arthur Konnerth and his research group focuses on neuronal networks in the cerebellum and the hippocampus, and has made important contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms and processes that form the cellular basis for motor control and motor learning.\n\n2000\n\nDieter LÃ¼st **\n\nProfessor of Theoretical Physics\n\n1999\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Graf\n\nProfessor of Lutheran Protestant Theology **\n\n1997\n\nPaul Knochel\n\nProfessor of Organic Chemistry **\n\n1996\n\nWolfgang Schnick\n\nProfessor of Solid-State Chemistry **\n\n1996\n\nWinfried Schulze\n\nProfessor of Early Modern History\n\n1993\n\nRegine Kahmann\n\nProfessor of Molecular Genetics *\n\n1992\n\nSvante PÃ¤Ã¤bo\n\nProfessor of Molecular Biology *\n\n1989\n\nClaus Wilhelm Canaris\n\nProfessor of Civil Law / Commerce and Labor Law\n\n1989\n\nTheodor W. HÃ¤nsch\n\nProfessor of Laser Physics / Quantum Optics\n\n1987\n\nKnut Borchardt\n\nProfessor of Economic History / Economics *"
