He also invented the Leibniz wheel and suggested important theories about force, energy and time. The ultimate expression of Leibniz's view comes in his celebrated theory of monads, in which the only beings that will count as genuine substances and hence be considered real are mind-like simple substances endowed with perception and appetite. His assertion, that monads are the grounds of all corporeal phenomena, as well as its metaphysical corollaries has shocked many thinker.\n#germansppu #germanphilosophers#deutschunterrichtinpune #deutschmachtspa√ü #germanistikinpune #leibniz\".",
