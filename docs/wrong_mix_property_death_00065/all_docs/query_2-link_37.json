        "text": "Newton’s Approach to the Product Rule\n\nIn the Principia, Newton “proved” the Product Rule as follows: Let \\(x\\) and \\(v\\) be “ﬂowing2 quantites” and consider the rectangle, \\(R\\), whose sides are \\(x\\) and \\(v\\). \\(R\\) is also a ﬂowing quantity and we wish to find its ﬂuxion (derivative) at any time.\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Isaac Newton\n\nFirst increment \\(x\\) and \\(v\\) by \\(\\frac{∆x}{2} \\) and \\(\\frac{∆v}{2} \\) respectively. Then the corresponding increment of \\(R\\) is\n\n\\[\\left ( x + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\right ) \\left ( v + \\frac{\\Delta v}{2} \\right ) = xv + x\\frac{\\Delta v}{2} + v\\frac{\\Delta x}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta x \\Delta v}{4}\\]\n\nNow decrement \\(x\\) and \\(v\\) by the same amounts:\n\n\\[\\left ( x - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\right ) \\left ( v - \\frac{\\Delta v}{2} \\right ) = xv - x\\frac{\\Delta v}{2} - v\\frac{\\Delta x}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta x \\Delta v}{4}\\]\n\nSubtracting the right side of equation \\(\\PageIndex{11}\\) from the right side of equation \\(\\PageIndex{10}\\) gives\n\n\\[∆R = x∆v + v∆x\\]\n\nwhich is the total change of \\(R = xv\\) over the intervals \\(∆x\\) and \\(∆v\\) and also recognizably the Product Rule.\n\nThis argument is no better than Leibniz’s as it relies heavily on the number \\(1/2\\) to make it work. If we take any other increments in \\(x\\) and \\(v\\) whose total lengths are \\(∆x\\) and \\(∆v\\) it will simply not work. Try it and see.\n\nIn Newton’s defense, he wasn’t really trying to justify his mathematical methods in the Principia. His attention there was on physics, not math, so he was really just trying to give a convincing demonstration of his methods. You may decide for yourself how convincing his demonstration is.\n\nNotice that there is no mention of limits of difference quotients or derivatives. In fact, the term derivative was not coined until 1797, by Lagrange. In a sense, these topics were not necessary at the time, as Leibniz and Newton both assumed that the curves they dealt with had tangent lines and, in fact, Leibniz explicitly used the tangent line to relate two differential quantities. This was consistent with the thinking of the time and for the duration of this chapter we will also assume that all quantities are differentiable. As we will see later this assumption leads to difficulties.\n\nBoth Newton and Leibniz were satisfied that their calculus provided answers that agreed with what was known at the time. For example \\(d(x^2)= d(xx) = xdx+xdx = 2xdx\\) and \\(d(x^3)= d(x^2x)= x^2 dx+xd(x^2)= x^2+x(2xdx) = 3x^2 dx\\), results that were essentially derived by others in different ways.\n\nLeibniz also provided applications of his calculus to prove its worth. As an example he derived Snell’s Law of Refraction from his calculus rules as follows.\n\nGiven that light travels through air at a speed of \\(v_a\\) and travels through water at a speed of \\(v_w\\) the problem is to find the fastest path from point \\(A\\) to point \\(B\\).\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\): Fastest path that light travels from point \\(A\\) to point \\(B\\).\n\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle of Least Time, this fastest path is the one that light will travel.\n\nUsing the fact that \\(Time = Distance/Velocity\\) and the labeling in the picture below we can obtain a formula for the time \\(T\\) it takes for light to travel from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\): Fermat’s Principle of Least Time.\n\n\\[T = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_a} + \\frac{\\sqrt{(c-x)^2 + b^2}}{v_w}\\]\n\nUsing the rules of Leibniz’s calculus, we obtain\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} dT &= \\left ( \\frac{1}{v_a} \\frac{1}{2} (x^2 + a^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (2x) + \\frac{1}{v_w} \\frac{1}{2} ((c-x)^2 + b^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (2(c-x)(-1))\\right )dx\\\\ &= \\left ( \\frac{1}{v_a} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} - \\frac{1}{v_w} \\frac{c-x}{\\sqrt{(c-x)^2 + b^2}} \\right )dx \\end{align*}\\]\n\nUsing the fact that at the minimum value for \\(T\\), \\(dT = 0\\), we have that the fastest path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) must satisfy \\(\\frac{1}{v_a} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} = \\frac{1}{v_w} \\frac{c-x}{\\sqrt{(c-x)^2 + b^2}}\\). Inserting the following angles\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\): Fastest path that light travels.\n\nwe get that the path that light travels must satisfy\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sin \\theta _a}{v_a} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta _w}{v_w}\\]\n\nwhich is Snell’s Law.\n\nTo compare \\(18^{th}\\) century and modern techniques we will consider Johann Bernoulli’s solution of the Brachistochrone problem. In 1696, Bernoulli posed, and solved, the Brachistochrone problem; that is, to find the shape of a frictionless wire joining points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so that the time it takes for a bead to slide down under the force of gravity is as small as possible.\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{8}\\): Finding shape of a frictionless wire joining points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nBernoulli posed this “path of fastest descent” problem to challenge the mathematicians of Europe and used his solution to demonstrate the power of Leibniz’s calculus as well as his own ingenuity.\n\nI, Johann Bernoulli, address the most brilliant mathematicians in the world. Nothing is more attractive to intelligent people than an honest, challenging problem, whose possible solution will bestow fame and remain as a lasting monument. Following the example set by Pascal, Fermat, etc., I hope to gain the gratitude of the whole scientific community by placing before the finest mathematicians of our time a problem which will test their methods and the strength of their intellect. If someone communicates to me the solution of the proposed problem, I shall publicly declare him worthy of praise. [11]\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{9}\\): Johann Bernoulli.\n\nIn addition to Johann’s, solutions were obtained from Newton, Leibniz, Johann’s brother Jacob Bernoulli, and the Marquis de l’Hopital [15]. At the time there was an ongoing and very vitriolic controversy raging over whether Newton or Leibniz had been the first to invent calculus. An advocate of the methods of Leibniz, Bernoulli did not believe Newton would be able to solve the problem using his methods. Bernoulli attempted to embarrass Newton by sending him the problem. However Newton did solve it.\n\nAt this point in his life Newton had all but quit science and mathematics and was fully focused on his administrative duties as Master of the Mint. In part due to rampant counterfeiting, England’s money had become severely devalued and the nation was on the verge of economic collapse. The solution was to recall all of the existing coins, melt them down, and strike new ones. As Master of the Mint this job fell to Newton [8]. As you might imagine this was a rather Herculean task. Nevertheless, according to his niece:\n\nWhen the problem in 1696 was sent by Bernoulli–Sir I.N. was in the midst of the hurry of the great recoinage and did not come home till four from the Tower very much tired, but did not sleep till he had solved it, which was by four in the morning. (quoted in [2], page 201)\n\nHe is later reported to have complained, “I do not love ... to be ... teezed by forreigners about Mathematical things [2].”\n\nNewton submitted his solution anonymously, presumably to avoid more controversy. Nevertheless the methods used were so distinctively Newton’s that Bernoulli is said to have exclaimed “Tanquam ex ungue leonem.”3\n\nBernoulli’s ingenious solution starts, interestingly enough, with Snell’s Law of Refraction. He begins by considering the stratified medium in the following figure, where an object travels with velocities \\(v_1, v_2, v_3, ...\\) in the various layers.\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{10}\\): Bernoulli's solution.\n\nBy repeatedly applying Snell’s Law he concluded that the fastest path must satisfy\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sin \\theta _1}{v_1} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta _2}{v_2} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta _3}{v_3} = \\cdots\\]\n\nIn other words, the ratio of the sine of the angle that the curve makes with the vertical and the speed remains constant along this fastest path.\n\nIf we think of a continuously changing medium as stratified into infinitesimal layers and extend Snell’s law to an object whose speed is constantly changing,\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{11}\\): Snell's law for an object changing speed continuously.\n\nthen along the fastest path, the ratio of the sine of the angle that the curve’s tangent makes with the vertical, \\(α\\), and the speed, \\(v\\), must remain constant.\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sin \\alpha }{v} = c\\]\n\nIf we include axes and let \\(P\\) denote the position of the bead at a particular time then we have the following picture.\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{11}\\): Path traveled by the bead.\n\nIn the above figure, \\(s\\) denotes the length that the bead has traveled down to point \\(P\\) (that is, the arc length of the curve from the origin to that point) and a denotes the tangential component of the acceleration due to gravity \\(g\\). Since the bead travels only under the inﬂuence of gravity then \\(\\frac{dv}{dt} = a\\).\n\nTo get a sense of how physical problems were approached using Leibniz’s calculus we will use the above equation to show that \\(v = \\sqrt{2gy}\\).\n\nBy similar triangles we have \\(\\frac{a}{g} = \\frac{dy}{ds}\\). As a student of Leibniz, Bernoulli would have regarded \\(\\frac{dy}{ds}\\) as a fraction so\n\n\\[a ds = gdy\\]\n\nand since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity we have\n\n\\[\\frac{dv}{dt} ds= gdy\\]\n\nAgain, \\(18^{th}\\) century European mathematicians regarded \\(dv\\), \\(dt\\), and \\(ds\\) as infinitesimally small numbers which nevertheless obey all of the usual rules of algebra. Thus we can rearrange the above to get\n\n\\[\\frac{ds}{dt} dv= gdy\\]\n\nSince \\(\\frac{ds}{dt}\\) is the rate of change of position with respect to time it is, in fact, the velocity of the bead. That is\n\n\\[v dv = g dy\\]\n\nBernoulli would have interpreted this as a statement that two rectangles of height \\(v\\) and \\(g\\), with respective widths \\(dv\\) and \\(dy\\) have equal area. Summing (integrating) all such rectangles we get:\n\n\\[\\int v dv = \\int g dy\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{v^2}{2} = gy\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{2gy}\\]\n\nYou are undoubtedly uncomfortable with the cavalier manipulation of infinitesimal quantities you’ve just witnessed, so we’ll pause for a moment now to compare a modern development of equation \\(\\PageIndex{12}\\) to Bernoulli’s. As before we begin with the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{a}{g} = \\frac{dy}{ds}\\]\n\n\\[a = g\\frac{dy}{ds}\\]\n\nMoreover, since acceleration is the derivative of velocity this is the same as:\n\n\\[\\frac{dv}{dt} = g\\frac{dy}{ds}\\]\n\nNow observe that by the Chain Rule \\(\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dv}{ds} \\frac{ds}{dt}\\). The physical interpretation of this formula is that velocity will depend on \\(s\\), how far down the wire the bead has moved, but that the distance traveled will depend on how much time has elapsed. Therefore\n\n\\[\\frac{dv}{ds} \\frac{ds}{dt} = g\\frac{dy}{ds}\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\\frac{ds}{dt} \\frac{dv}{ds} = g\\frac{dy}{ds}\\]\n\nand since \\(\\frac{ds}{dt} = v\\)\n\n\\[v\\frac{dv}{ds} = g\\frac{dy}{ds}\\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to \\(s\\) gives:\n\n\\[\\int v\\frac{dv}{ds} ds = g\\int \\frac{dy}{ds} ds\\]\n\n\\[\\int vdv = g\\int dy\\]\n\nand integrating gives\n\n\\[\\frac{v^2}{2} = gy\\]\n\nas before.\n\nIn effect, in the modern formulation we have traded the simplicity and elegance of differentials for a comparatively cumbersome repeated use of the Chain Rule. No doubt you noticed when taking Calculus that in the differential notation of Leibniz, the Chain Rule looks like “canceling” an expression in the top and bottom of a fraction: \\(\\frac{dy}{du} \\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dx}\\). This is because for 18th century mathematicians, this is exactly what it was.\n\nTo put it another way, \\(18^{th}\\) century mathematicians wouldn’t have recognized a need for what we call the Chain Rule because this operation was a triviality for them. Just reduce the fraction. This begs the question: Why did we abandon such a clear, simple interpretation of our symbols in favor of the, comparatively, more cumbersome modern interpretation? This is one of the questions we will try to answer in this course.\n\nReturning to the Brachistochrone problem we observe that \\(\\frac{\\sin \\alpha }{v} = c\\) and since \\(\\sin \\alpha = \\frac{dx}{ds}\\) we see that\n\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{dx}{ds}}{\\sqrt{2gy}} = c\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{2gy(ds)^2}} = c\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{2gy\\left [ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 \\right ]}} = c\\]\n\nBernoulli was then able to solve this differential equation.\n\nThis illustrates the state of calculus in the late 1600’s and early 1700’s; the foundations of the subject were a bit shaky but there was no denying its power."
