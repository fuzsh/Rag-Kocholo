Now it has been rebuilt on the original site to the original plans and filled with life for modern times.\n\tThe opening of the Palace on 18 January 2013 ended decades of debate about whether to rebuild it. The magnificent, but by no means ostentatious new building, creates a bridge between tradition and modernism. The outside features the neoclassical façade, built according to historical plans by court architect Georg Ludwig Laves from 1819. The interior is characterised by clearly defined shapes and state-of-the-art equipment. According to the wishes of the Palace project's sponsor, Volkswagen Foundation in Hannover, an advanced congress centre and meeting place for business, culture and academia was created.\n\tHannover  (Lower Saxony) Germany Europe",
