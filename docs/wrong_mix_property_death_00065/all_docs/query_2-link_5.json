        "text": "(1646–1716). Although he was not an artist, Leibniz was in many other ways comparable to Leonardo da Vinci. He was recognized as the universal genius of his time, a philosopher and scientist who worked in the fields of mathematics, geology, theology, mechanics, history, jurisprudence, and linguistics.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig, Germany, on July 1, 1646. He was educated at the University of Leipzig and received a doctorate in law at the University of Nuremberg. Because he was forced to earn a living, he spent his entire adult life in the service of nobility and royalty, particularly for the House of Brunswick-Lüneberg in Germany. His last employer was Duke George Louis of Hanover, who became King George I of England in 1714. This employment enabled Leibniz to travel a great deal throughout Europe and meet the leading scholars of his day. His many duties did not interfere with his extensive intellectual pursuits.\n\nDuring his lifetime Leibniz perfected the calculating machine invented by Blaise Pascal; laid the ground for integral and differential calculus; founded dynamics, an area of mechanics; worked on mechanical devices such as clocks, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, and windmills; perfected the binary system of numeration used today in computer operations; devised the theory that all reasoning can be reduced to an ordered combination of elements such as numbers, words, sounds, or colors (the theoretical basis of modern computers); laid the foundation for general topology, a branch of mathematics; strove to formulate a basis for the unification of the churches; and pursued the goal of writing a universal history. He also continued to perfect his metaphysical system through research into the notion of a universal cause of all being."
