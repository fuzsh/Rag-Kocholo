        "text": "The essential insight of Newton and Leibniz was to use Cartesian algebra to synthesize the earlier results and to develop algorithms that could be applied uniformly to a wide class of problems. The formative period of Newton’s researches was from 1665 to 1670, while Leibniz worked a few years later, in the 1670s. Their contributions differ in origin, development, and influence, and it is necessary to consider each man separately.\n\nNewton, the son of an English farmer, became in 1669 the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. Newton’s earliest researches in mathematics grew in 1665 from his study of van Schooten’s edition of La Géométrie and Wallis’s Arithmetica Infinitorum. Using the Cartesian equation of the curve, he reformulated Wallis’s results, introducing for this purpose infinite sums in the powers of an unknown x, now known as infinite series. Possibly under the influence of Barrow, he used infinitesimals to establish for various curves the inverse relationship of tangents and areas. The operations of differentiation and integration emerged in his work as analytic processes that could be applied generally to investigate curves.\n\nUnusually sensitive to questions of rigour, Newton at a fairly early stage tried to establish his new method on a sound foundation using ideas from kinematics. A variable was regarded as a “fluent,” a magnitude that flows with time; its derivative or rate of change with respect to time was called a “fluxion,” denoted by the given variable with a dot above it. The basic problem of the calculus was to investigate relations among fluents and their fluxions. Newton finished a treatise on the method of fluxions as early as 1671, although it was not published until 1736. In the 18th century this method became the preferred approach to the calculus among British mathematicians, especially after the appearance in 1742 of Colin Maclaurin’s influential Treatise of Fluxions.\n\nNewton first published the calculus in Book I of his great Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687; Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). Originating as a treatise on the dynamics of particles, the Principia presented an inertial physics that combined Galileo’s mechanics and Kepler’s planetary astronomy. It was written in the early 1680s at a time when Newton was reacting against Descartes’s science and mathematics. Setting aside the analytic method of fluxions, Newton introduced in 11 introductory lemmas his calculus of first and last ratios, a geometric theory of limits that provided the mathematical basis of his dynamics.\n\nNewton’s use of the calculus in the Principia is illustrated by proposition 11 of Book I: if the orbit of a particle moving under a centripetal force is an ellipse with the centre of force at one focus, then the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the centre. Because the planets were known by Kepler’s laws to move in ellipses with the Sun at one focus, this result supported his inverse square law of gravitation. To establish the proposition, Newton derived an approximate measure for the force by using small lines defined in terms of the radius (the line from the force centre to the particle) and the tangent to the curve at a point. This result expressed geometrically the proportionality of force to vector acceleration. Using properties of the ellipse known from classical geometry, Newton calculated the limit of this measure and showed that it was equal to a constant times 1 over the square of the radius.\n\nNewton avoided analytic processes in the Principia by expressing magnitudes and ratios directly in terms of geometric quantities, both finite and infinitesimal. His decision to eschew analysis constituted a striking rejection of the algebraic methods that had been important in his own early researches on the calculus. Although the Principia was of inestimable value for later mechanics, it would be reworked by researchers on the Continent and expressed in the mathematical idiom of the Leibnizian calculus.\n\nLeibniz’s interest in mathematics was aroused in 1672 during a visit to Paris, where the Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens introduced him to his work on the theory of curves. Under Huygens’s tutelage Leibniz immersed himself for the next several years in the study of mathematics. He investigated relationships between the summing and differencing of finite and infinite sequences of numbers. Having read Barrow’s geometric lectures, he devised a transformation rule to calculate quadratures, obtaining the famous infinite series for π/4:\n\nLeibniz was interested in questions of logic and notation, of how to construct a characteristica universalis for rational investigation. After considerable experimentation he arrived by the late 1670s at an algorithm based on the symbols d and ∫. He first published his research on differential calculus in 1684 in an article in the Acta Eruditorum, “Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, Itemque Tangentibus, qua nec Fractas nec Irrationales Quantitates Moratur, et Singulare pro illi Calculi Genus” (“A New Method for Maxima and Minima as Well as Tangents, Which Is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor by Irrational Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This”). In this article he introduced the differential dx satisfying the rules d(x + y) = dx + dy and d(xy) = xdy + ydx and illustrated his calculus with a few examples. Two years later he published a second article, “On a Deeply Hidden Geometry,” in which he introduced and explained the symbol ∫ for integration. He stressed the power of his calculus to investigate transcendental curves, the very class of “mechanical” objects Descartes had believed lay beyond the power of analysis, and derived a simple analytic formula for the cycloid.\n\nLeibniz continued to publish results on the new calculus in the Acta Eruditorum and began to explore his ideas in extensive correspondence with other scholars. Within a few years he had attracted a group of researchers to promulgate his methods, including the brothers Johann Bernoulli and Jakob Bernoulli in Basel and the priest Pierre Varignon and Guillaume-François-Antoine de L’Hospital in Paris. In 1700 he persuaded Frederick William I of Prussia to establish the Brandenburg Society of Sciences (later renamed the Berlin Academy of Sciences), with himself appointed president for life.\n\nLeibniz’s vigorous espousal of the new calculus, the didactic spirit of his writings, and his ability to attract a community of researchers contributed to his enormous influence on subsequent mathematics. In contrast, Newton’s slowness to publish and his personal reticence resulted in a reduced presence within European mathematics. Although the British school in the 18th century included capable researchers, Abraham de Moivre, James Stirling, Brook Taylor, and Maclaurin among them, they failed to establish a program of research comparable to that established by Leibniz’s followers on the Continent. There is a certain tragedy in Newton’s isolation and his reluctance to acknowledge the superiority of continental analysis. As the historian Michael Mahoney observed:\n\nWhatever the revolutionary influence of the Principia, mathematics would have looked much the same if Newton had never existed. In that endeavour he belonged to a community, and he was far from indispensable to it."
