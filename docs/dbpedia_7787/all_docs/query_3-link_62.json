        "text": "But railways did not solely serve military purposes. The War Diaries of Force D reveal that British colonial officials were considering Britain’s post-war imperial objectives alongside the requirements of the army, and that they directed railway construction in Mesopotamia accordingly. British planners intended to build a transport network that could support the entrenchment and administrative requirements of a colonial regime once the conflict had ended.\n\nThe Many Uses of Rail\n\nRailways were conceived as both revenue generators and infrastructure for a future British-controlled state in Iraq. In a telegram from February 1918, the British Political Resident A senior ranking political representative (equivalent to a Consul General) from the diplomatic corps of the Government of India or one of its subordinate provincial governments, in charge of a Political Residency. in the Persian Gulf The historical term used to describe the body of water between the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. , Sir Percy Cox, comments that a proposed rail route from Basra to Baghdad would ‘meet post bellum requirements’ for better communications with Baghdad, and improve transportation for Mesopotamian pilgrims. He further argues that immediate military needs could be coordinated with ‘development and pacification’ in the interests of long-term British hegemony in Mesopotamia.\n\nRivalries via Railway: The Struggle for the Mosul Vilayet\n\nBritish railway construction in Mesopotamia was also informed by inter-imperial rivalries. This was clearly demonstrated during the controversy regarding control over the Mosul Vilayet, an Ottoman administrative region centred on the city of Mosul. When the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, this area was still controlled by the Ottoman army. The terms of the Armistice stated that both the British and Ottoman militaries would remain in the positions they held when it was signed. However, in violation of the armistice and in a grab Shallow vessel with a projecting bow. for more territory, British forces continued their advance, occupying Mosul city and establishing their own military claim to the Vilayet on 14 November. The issue was further complicated by the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, in which the French and British governments had determined that Mosul would be a part of France’s post-war colonial sphere of influence. There were therefore competing British, French, and Turkish nationalist claims for control of the Vilayet.\n\nThis uncertainty is reflected in discussions documented about linking Mosul to the rest of British-occupied Iraq by rail. As the Political Resident A senior ranking political representative (equivalent to a Consul General) from the diplomatic corps of the Government of India or one of its subordinate provincial governments, in charge of a Political Residency. notes in a telegram from the day British troops occupied Mosul, such a connection was ‘of primary importance, if we are to include this Vilaiyet [sic] within the boundaries of the Iraq state’ (IOR/L/MIL/17/5/3312, f. 36r). Building rail links to Mosul would make the establishment of British control there easier, and would symbolize the British Government’s intention to include the area in a future Iraqi state. If, on the other hand, it was decided that Mosul would ‘fall within the French sphere’, the Political Resident A senior ranking political representative (equivalent to a Consul General) from the diplomatic corps of the Government of India or one of its subordinate provincial governments, in charge of a Political Residency. questioned whether railway materiel ‘so urgently required elsewhere’ should be used for this purpose (IOR/L/MIL/17/5/3312, ff. 36r-37r). The lack of rail connections undermined the effectiveness of the British garrison in Mosul, prompting the commander of British forces in Mesopotamia, Sir William Marshall, to request in February 1919 that the railway be extended to the contested territory. On this occasion, however, military needs were subordinated to imperial diplomacy, and the War Office refused to sanction the extension, simply citing ‘political reasons’ – most likely to avoid antagonizing France (IOR/L/MIL/17/5/3318, f. 49r).\n\nOccupation by Rail\n\nRailways remained critical as British activities in Mesopotamia transitioned from wartime campaigning to colonial occupation. When the Kurdish leader Mahmud Barzanji rose in rebellion against the occupation in June 1919, transport infrastructure proved essential to the British military response. General Marshall stated at the time that he had sufficient forces to defeat the Kurdish uprising, but that the main difficulty was transport. In his communications, he argues that the railway line from Qizil Rabat was vital to the crackdown, and that military and colonial administrative goals were in alignment. The railway was similarly key to maintaining British control in the aftermath of this uprising. In a telegram, Marshall opines that the region will ‘remain prosperous and peaceful’ if the Kurdish shaikhs can be tightly controlled – a feat which he argues can be achieved through the construction and maintenance of efficient transport links between their territories and British garrisons."
