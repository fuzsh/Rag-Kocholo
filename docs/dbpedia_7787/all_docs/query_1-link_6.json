It covers the entire west coast of the Anatolia peninsula and has its headquarters in İzmir. It was organised in the 1970s in response to political tensions with Greece - the ongoing Aegean dispute.\n\nIts stated mission is to protect Turkey's territory on its western coast. This is directed against the perceived threat posed by Greece's armament of the Aegean Sea islands. Greece, on the other hand, perceives the presence of the Aegean Army as a threat to its islands, citing strong offensive capabilities ascribed to the Aegean Army as well as the exposed and isolated geographical position of the islands as reasons of concern. Greek sources particularly point to the strong amphibian forces maintained by the Aegean Army as an indicator of its offensive nature.[2] Turkey has countered such concerns by stating that besides being of a fundamentally defensive nature it is \"basically a training army\".[3]\n\nThe Aegean Army is not a NATO-assigned formation.[citation needed]\n\nThe Army has been reported to consist of the following units and organizations:\n\nCyprus Turkish Peace Force\n\n57th Artillery Training Brigade (Izmir)\n\n19th Infantry Brigade (Edremit)\n\n11th Motorised Infantry Brigade (Denizli)\n\n3rd Infantry Training Brigade (Antalya)\n\n1st Infantry Training Brigade (Manisa).[4]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
