        "text": "This section of the Long, Long Trail will be helpful for anyone wishing to find out about the fighting in the campaign in Mesopotamia.\n\nWhy did British forces fight in Mesopotamia?\n\nThere were considerable British business interests in Mesopotamia, notably in the shape of the established oil refinery at Abadan and a main supply pipeline coming in from distant wells. There were also reports of vast oil deposits further north. From a military viewpoint this was becoming of strategic importance, for the dominant Royal Navy was increasingly oil-powered, and the economic self-interest is clear. The first military steps were taken to secure Abadan.\n\nFor centuries before the Great War, Mesopotamia had been part of the Ottoman Empire. Lying along its eastern border was Persia, generally friendly to the British. The Arab Sheiks of nearby Kuwait and Muhammerah also supported Britain; the Arab tribes of coastal Mesopotamia often changed sides. Germany had for many years before the war assiduously developed the Ottoman Empire as an ally, which it saw as an important part of the Drang nach Osten (“Thrust towards the East”: Germany wanted new lands, new markets). The Ottoman army was led by German ‘advisors’. Although the campaign began principally to secure oil supplies for the Royal Navy, victory over the Ottoman Empire became believed by some – notably David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill – to be a less costly way towards defeat of Germany than the painful battering at the Western Front. Pushed by Germany – which also tried to encourage a Jihad (Muslim Holy War) against the British – the Ottoman forces proved to be a deadly and difficult foe. When the Ottomans began to crumble to defeat in 1917 and 1918, the British Army found themselves in a tangled web of politics and deceit and facing a new threat in the form of armed Muslim factions across all of Iraq and Syria.\n\nInhospitable ground\n\nMesopotamia is an ancient land through which run the great Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. The two rivers meet at Qurna, 40 miles north of Basra, where they come together to form the Shatt-al-Arab, a complex river delta which flows into the Persian Gulf. The land is for the most part desert and is very flat. The rivers flooded the plains when the winter snows in the northern mountains thawed. The small towns and villages that existed along the river banks in 1914 were generally constructed several feet above water level. There is virtually no water in this land except that from the rivers. There were very few roads, so all transport had to be by boat along the rivers. The major centre of population was Baghdad, almost 570 miles upstream from the Gulf.\n\nOpening moves\n\nBritain relied heavily on oil to keep its dominant navy at sea. It determined very quickly on the outbreak of the war with Germany to protect its interests by occupying the oilfields and pipeline near Basra. A battle group known as Indian Expeditionary Force “D” was sent from India to carry out these operations.\n\nOrder of Battle of Indian Expeditionary Force “D” in 1914\n\nIt then pushed out a force to seize the river junction at Qurna. More\n\n1915\n\n1915 saw some tactical moves by the British to seize important or threatening points beyond Basra. After an early string of cheap successes, eyes increasingly fell on the lure of the Mesopotamian capital, Baghdad. The 6th (Poona) Division advanced upriver, leaving a very thinly stretched supply line of hundreds of miles behind it, only to receive a bloody repulse at Ctesiphon. A ragged and dispiriting retreat back to Kut-al-Amara began.\n\nIndian Expeditionary Force “D” was expanded, notably by the addition of the 12th Indian Division.\n\nReorganisation of IEF “D” in April 1915\n\nThe Turkish attempts to recapture Basra (The “Miracle of Shaiba”) (11 – 14 April 1915)\n\nAffair of Khafajiyah (14-16 May 1915)\n\nThe Capture of Nasiriyeh (27 June – 24 July 1915)\n\nOccupation of Nasiriyeh (25 July 1915)\n\nThe first advance on Baghdad (including the Capture of Kut-al-Amara) (12 September – 7 October 1915)\n\nThe Battle of Ctesiphon (22 – 24 November 1915)\n\nThe retreat to Kut-al-Amara (25 November – 3 December 1915)\n\n1916\n\nThe Turks pursued the retreating 6th (Poona) Division to Kut, and soon surrounded and cut it off. British forces in Mesopotamia were now growing, the arrival of the experienced 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut) and 13th (Western) Divisions bringing a significant increase in strength. These formations were ordered to advance north along the Tigris to relieve Kut. They ran into strong and stoutly defended lines and suffered some hard knocks. Although they got close to Kut, they failed to break through and relieve it and garrison there was surrendered on 29 April 1916. It was an enormous blow to British prestige and a morale-booster for the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe siege of Kut-al-Amara (7 December 1915 – 29 April 1916)\n\nThe efforts to relieve Kut\n\nThe Battle of Sheik Sa’ad (7 January 1916)\n\nThe Battle of the Wadi (13 January 1916)\n\nThe Battle of the Hanna (21 January 1916)\n\nThe Attack on the Dujaila Redoubt (7 – 9 March 1916)\n\nThe Battles of the Hanna and Fallahiyeh (5 – 8 April 1916)\n\nThe Battles of Bait Aisa and Sannaiyat (7 – 22 April 1916)\n\nThe surrender of the Kut garrison (29 April 1916)\n\nAction of As Salihan (11 September 1916)\n\nAdvance to the Hai and capture of Khudaira Bend (began 14 December 1916)\n\n1917\n\nLessons were learned. Following the fall of Kut, the British ordered Major-General Stanley Maude to take command of the British army in Mesopotamia. He introduced new methods, which culminated in a decisive defeat of the Turks in February 1917 and the capture of Baghdad in March 1917. On this day, the Berlin-Baghdad railway was captured, and German schemes for Turkey were finished. Given the continually depressing news in France and elsewhere, this was a sinificant and newsworthy achievement. British forces (and Russians, advancing from the north and east) closed in on the Turks throughout the autumn of 1917, and into the Spring of 1918. Despite making great advances, however, and the additional pressure coming from the north-west where British forces in Palestine defeated the Turks, no decisive victory was gained.\n\nThe Battle of Mohammed Abdul Hassan (9 January 1917)\n\nThe Battles of the Hai salient, Dahra Bend and the Shumran Peninsula (11 January – 24 February 1917)\n\nAdvance to the Hai and capture of Khudaira Bend (ended 19 January 1917)\n\nPassage of the Tigris (3-4 February 1917)\n\nThe Capture of Baghdad (11 March 1917)\n\nPassage of the Adhaim (18 April 1917)\n\nThe Battle of Istabulat (21 April 1917)\n\nThe Battle of ‘The Boot’ at Band-i-Adhaim (30 April 1917)\n\nAction of Adhaim (30 April 1917)\n\nCapture of Ramadi (28-29 September 1917)\n\nSecond Action of Jabal Hamrin (16-20 October 1917)\n\nThe Battle of Tikrit (5 November 1917)\n\nThird Action of Jabal Hamrin (3-6 December 1917)\n\n1918\n\nOccupation of Hit (9 March 1918)\n\nThe Action of Khan Baghdadi (26-27 March 1918)\n\nActions of Fat-ha Gorge and on the Little Zab (23 – 26 October 1918)\n\nBattle of Sharqat (28 – 30 October)\n\nTurkey signs Armistice (30 October 1918)\n\nThe cost\n\nConditions in Mesopotamia defy description. Extremes of temperature (120 degrees F was common); arid desert and regular flooding; flies, mosquitoes and other vermin: all led to appalling levels of sickness and death through disease. Under these conditions, units fell short of officers and men, and all too often the reinforcements were half-trained and ill-equipped. Medical arrangements were quite shocking, with wounded men spending up to two weeks on boats before reaching any kind of hospital. These factors, plus of course the unexpectedly determined Turkish resistance, contributed to high casualty rates.\n\n11012 killed\n\n3985 died of wounds\n\n12678 died of sickness\n\n13492 missing and prisoners (9000 at Kut)\n\n51836 wounded\n\ndata from “Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire” (London: HMSO, 1920).\n\nLinks"
