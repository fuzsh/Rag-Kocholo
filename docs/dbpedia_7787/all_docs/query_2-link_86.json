        "text": "\"The Ottoman Army and the First World War is a thorough analysis of the Ottoman Army on all fronts during the Great War. It describes its operational military history and military effectiveness during that war, and it is difficult to disagree with Uyar in his assessment that Western historiography has for too long ignored the so-called peripheral campaigns of the war ... This book is a long overdue addition to the modern historiography of the First World War.\"\n\nMichael Tyquin, British Journal for Military History\n\n\"What emerges from Uyar’s wide-ranging study is a work of great utility to scholars of the First World War and conflict in the Middle East. Ultimately, he makes a powerful case for the need to rigorously re-examine the operational military history of the Ottoman Empire’s war, as doing so opens up myriad fascinating questions that have still yet to be explored about how the empire coped with and waged a modern war.\""
