        "text": "A high oblique view of the Holy League troops on Djerba in March to May 1560 and the Turkish fleet confronting the Christian fleet off the north coast of Tunisia in May 1560. The Ottoman Empire (1500-1606): Conflicts in the Mediterranean (1532-1565). Oriented with north to top (cardinal points).\n\nThe Turkish position on Djerba, an island off the south-east coast of Tunisia, was taken by surprise by the fleet and troops of the Holy League, led by Philip I of Spain (Spain, Genoa, Papal States, Knights of Malta), commanded by Giovanni Andrea Doria (1539-1606), in March 1560. The Christian army established a garrison and fort ashore. The Turkish fleet, commanded by Admiral Pyale Pasha (c.1515-1578), was warned of the event and sailed to the island in May causing the troops and fleet of the Holy League to flee, losing some thirty galleys during a battle lasting a few hours and abandoning many of the soldiers in the onshore garrison.\n\nThis view, although dated in the old catalogue to 1535, shows the events of 1560. Part of the Christian fleet at the northern end of the island appears to be taking (or landing) troops who are being ferried across the shallow lagoon (three ‘passi’ or paces deep’). The troops who were left behind took refuge in the fort, shown at the northern end of the island, which had been constructed during the expedition (as noted in the title of the view). Some of the Christian galleys appear to be fleeing from the Turkish fleet; flags with crossed keys represent the Papal States; the double-headed eagle the Holy Roman Empire (Spain); the cross the Genoese and the Duchy of Savoy; the Maltese cross - the Knights of Malta; two of the galleys appear to be sporting the symbol of the Medici (in this case Cosimo I): six balls in a circle. The position of the first camp, near some fortified wells, are shown to the north-west and troop positions are shown elsewhere on the island."
