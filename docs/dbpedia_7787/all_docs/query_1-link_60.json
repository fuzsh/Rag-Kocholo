        "text": "Fahri Pasha (left of center, facing towards the camera) shakes hands with Abdullah at the official surrender on January 10.\n\nJanuary 13 1919, Medina–At the time of the Armistice of Mudros, the Turks still had a substantial presence on the Arabian peninsula; they still had the upper hand in Yemen, and they maintained firm control of Medina. Their supply lines had been interfered with by the Hashemites for years, and cut off entirely after Megiddo. The Armistice called for the surrender of all such garrisons, but the commander of Medina, Fahri Pasha, enacted strict rationing and refused to do so. The Hashemites placed the city under siege, and threatened to storm the holy city if need be. In response, Fahri Pasha locked himself in the Prophet’s Mosque (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi) along with his stores of ammunition, and threatened to blow up the second holiest site in Islam rather than surrender the city. His men, however, were less willing to make the sacrifice. After they learned the news of the war’s end, they slowly began to desert.\n\nOn January 10, Fahri Pasha, “looking round like a caged lion, and finding no escape,” officially and reluctantly surrendered the city and its garrison of over 16,000 men to Abdullah, Hussein’s second son. The Turkish soldiers were sent to PoW camps in Egypt before being repatriated to Turkey. On January 13, Abdullah’s men entered the city, officially ending Turkish control of Arabia and the holy sites of Islam."
