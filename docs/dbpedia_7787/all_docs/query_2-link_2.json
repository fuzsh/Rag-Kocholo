        "text": "The context\n\nThe Ottoman Empire secretly joined the Central Powers alliance on 2 August 1914. It hoped to use the war as a means of reasserting control over its former territories in Egypt and the Balkans. On 26 January 1915 it had launched a surprise attack on the Suez Canal.\n\nAfter successfully defending the canal, British Empire forces went on the offensive, crossing into the Sinai Peninsula. Success there led General Sir Archibald Murray to press the advantage by invading Palestine. However, two attacks on Ottoman-held Gaza in March-April 1917 failed, and Murray was replaced by General Sir Edmund Allenby.\n\nNablus\n\nThe desired breakthroughs at Sharon were achieved by nightfall. The Battle of Nablus then began with 20 Corps attacking the Ottoman line in the Judean Hills. A mixed mounted and infantry unit known as Chaytorâ€™s Force captured the Jordan River crossings, while an artillery barrage softened up the Ottoman Eighth Army.\n\nAt the same time, the Ottoman Fourth Army came under sustained attack in the Hills of Moab, at Es Salt and Amman. The battles raged throughout the night and into the next day, allowing 21 Corps to begin outflanking the Eighth Army. Meanwhile, the DMC completed their encirclement of the Turks, securing the important defiles of the Carmel Range."
