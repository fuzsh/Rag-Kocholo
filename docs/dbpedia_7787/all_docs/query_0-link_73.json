        "text": "Thanks for the replies, I was idly gazing at my book shelf and saw my copy of the Handbook of the Turkish Army 1916 (doh! what a great memory I have!)\n\nA quick flick through the OOB came up with the following:\n\nVIIIth army corps:\n\nCorps troops:\n\nCamel Corps (battalion 600 strong) (3 Camel Corps battalions have been formed, one (600 men) reaching Baghdad in September [1915], another in November. The third, composed of adventurers of all (Moslem) nationalities, at Bir es Saba in January 1916.\n\nThese troops were arbitrarily numbered by the British as:\n\nCamel Battalion No.1; Formed in the winter of 1914-15. Engaged on the canal, March-may 1915. Arrived at Baghdad, September 1915 (See above).\n\nCamel Battalion No.2 O.C. Ali Pasha. Arrived at Baghdad, November 1915 (See above)\n\nCamel Battalion No.3: 'The Moslem adventurers' (See above).\n\nIt also mentions Camel Corps troops in Arabia but I can't find them in the OOB. (probably gone blind stupid again!)\n\nAny further elaboration of this would be great\n\nIts funny you should mention this piture.\n\nDuring my reseach for a book on the Camel Corps I have received many photos from relatives of soldiers who served there.\n\nThese photos are of the soldier and or his mates mounted on camels most often in front of the pryimids.\n\nNow a closer look shows they are in fact not Camel Corps soldiers, just a soldier on a camel, a photo that was taken in there thousands since then to now.\n\nI beleive you can still get this done if you go there.\n\nSo I always look for some provernace on the photos now before taking them as a Came Corps soldier.\n\nS.B\n\nFerreted out some more info. on the Camel Corps\n\nDavid Nicolle in his Osprey book \"Lawrence and the Arab Revolts\" p.4\n\n'When the Ottoman army made its thrust against the Suez Canal early in 1915 it did so with a force of only 20,000 men, including two companies of the largely Arab Ottoman Camel Corps under Sami Bey........The Ottomans attempted another advance in the spring of 1916 during which the Camel Corps performed well, capturing a substantial part of a British cavalry regiment at outposts of Qatiya and Ughratina on 23 April.'\n\nI presume the the battalion involved at Qatiya was Camel Battalion No.3 'The Moslem Adventurers' since the other 2 battalions were redeployed to Baghdad in late 1915. Michael's photograph may therefore be of the Camel Battalion No.3.\n\nThis may also be the battalion from which the Arabs switched sides to the Hashemite forces during the Arab Revolt to form the Camel Corps of the Northern Arab Army(?)\n\nMate,\n\nAs you can see time has gone on since this was first started.\n\nYes the Ottomans raised at lest four Camel Regts during the war.\n\nThese were all mixed up and had a mixed history due to the lack of suitable riding camels.\n\nAs I said at lest four Camel Regt raised, these are possibly;\n\n1st Camel R Formed Jan/Feb 1915 in Syria - Sinai to Baghdad Iraq Sept 1915 at battle of Ctesiphon Nov 1915 posiblt to Palestine 1916/17 13th Corps - 1915 1st Camel (Hecin) Regt or Bn 1st Camel Regt (Hecin) + Cml MG Co LtCol Sadik (1915) & Josef Bischoff (G) 1Co - Lt Suphi Nuri (ileri) formed 23 officers 565 men 618 Hacin (Camels for riding) 114 camel for carrying 42 cavalry horses 1 Mountain artillary and 1 MG platoon of 3x Camel Co's 1xMG Co att 1 Canal Exp Force 6-15 to Baghdad 9-15 arrived Sept 1915 shown Allied reports Nov 1915 2x Camel Regts (1st & 2nd Regts) at Ctesiphon 22-11-15 (accounts 400 men) possibly rtn Palestine 1917 Turks shown to Hicaz EF (3x camel co's & MG Co) - shown June - July 1917 Allied reports 4th Army - Camel Bn (500 men) + June 1917 Camel Co (150 men) & July 1917 Camel Co (200 men) att 20th Corps + Camel Co (150 men) att 22nd Corps + att Camel Co (150 men) 3rd Cav Div June 1917 - shown Feb to July 1918 3rd Cav Div 1Co Camel Corps (100 men) and Aug 1918 Camel Co (375 men) to Sept 1918 camel Co (100 men) - shown May - Sept 1918 att Comp Div - Camel Co (50 men) 1-5Bn Camel supply (Jan 1915)\n\n2nd Camel R Formed June 1915 - to Baghdad Iraq Nov 1915 at battle of Ctesiphon Nov 1915 to Gaza 1916 2nd Camel (Hecin) Regt or Bn 2nd Camel (Hecin) Regt Maj Mehmet Atif Bey (Atesdagli) & Ali Pasha shown Allied reports arrived Baghdad Nov 1915 2x Camel Regts (1st & 2nd Regts) at Ctesiphon 22-11-15 (accounts 400 men) shown Allied reports Feb 1917 called 2nd Camel Regt at Gaza commanded by Hassan Iskander Bey sent company to Hassana under Lt Kasim Efendi and Nekhl under Lt Fouad Efendi while Turkish account say 2nd Camel Regt (Camel Raiders) at Medina 1M/Bty\n\n3rd Camel R Formed July-Aug 1915 at Damascus shown Handbook formed Jan 1916 in Sinai possibly to Medina 1916/17 (3rd) Camel (Hecin) Regt or Bn (3rd) Camel (Hecin) Regt (Camel Raider Bn) possibly Halid Bey 2Co - Capt Sirri - Capt Süreyya Bey KIA 23-4-16 battle of Katya in Sinai 2Co - Lt Halet & Lt Memduh & Lt Yakup Robenson KIA 23-4-16 battle of Katya in Sinai shown formed in Sinai Jan 1916 - part Kress Force (3655 men) 2xBn's 32nd Regt + Hejaz Arab (Akendji) Camel Regt + 2 Camel Co + 6x guns 8th FAR at Katya April 1916 - 2nd Canal Exp Force 8-16 - 2nd Camel Co (3rd Camel Regt) (1000 men) - possibly the Medine Camel Raider (Medine Akinci Taburu) Regt (Medine Akinci Alayi) (Medine Hecinsuvar Alayi) to Hejaz 1916 (possibly known as Camel Raider (Akinci) Bn) at Medina 3xCo's shown Dec 1916 reports at Medina Camel Regt (500 men) at Bir Raha district Camel Regt (300 men) at Mohafiz Alai 1xCo Camel Regt + 1xCo at Abu el-Naam and 1xCo at Bowat\n\n4th Camel R no details (4th) Camel (Hecin) Regt no details reported was forwarded to Iraq front 9-6-15\n\nAlong with these four Regts were a number of native/arab camel units raised localy, like;\n\nAgeyl camel Hejaz Hejaz Ageyl Camel corps (arabs) Medina Forces at Bowat - El-Ula 1/42nd Regt + Ageyl camel corps (arabs) - El-Wejh 1Bn Jendames (800) + Ageyl camel corps (arabs)\n\nHejaz camel Hejaz at Sinai April 1916 Hejaz Hedjaz Arab (Akendji) camel Regt Maj Mullmann (G) shown Kress Force (3655 men) 2xBn's 32nd Regt +\n\nHejaz Arab (Akendji) Camel Regt + 2 Camel Co + 6x guns 8th FAR at Katya April 1916\n\nSham Camel Yeman Bir Raha district Shammar Camel corps (arabs) Shammar Camel corps (arabs) Shammar Arabs (300 men)\n\nAs I said most Camel units were at times without enough animals to ride, like at Rafa, where most of the Camel Troops were dismounted due to the lack of riding camels.\n\n\"The Turkish garrison at Rafa under Lieutenant Colonel Ismail Hakki Bey commanding the 31st Infantry Regiment consisted of his own 1st and 2nd Battalions 31st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Division (less the 5th and 7th Companies), including around 6 to 10 MG's from the MG Companies of the 31st Regiment and the 80th Regiment (less gun or guns lost at Magdhaba) and a mixed MG Company from the 3rd Cavalry Division, a Turkish camel Corps platoon and dismounted Camel Company (200 men), a Gendarme Company (30 men) and part of a hospital unit.

It's odd to see your image used in somebody's post before you share it. Anyway\n\nOttoman Camel Corps (Hecinsüvar / Camel rider) was quite an interesting class in Ottoman army. They wore unique, cool looking, historical type of uniforms, probably nicked from those of old Ottoman light cavalry sub-class called \"Akincilar\" (raiders) which was active in 14th-16th centuries. They're also usually wore a cap badge (a crescent) which was an exceptional thing in Ottoman army. Their distinctive collar color was white, same as ordinary cavalry. Sadly, there's little or no study on these guys.\n\nThe most famous soldier from Ottoman Hecinsüvar units was Lt. Halet (b.1895). He was killed during the unsuccessful attack on Dueidar, which was held mainly by 5/Royal Scots Fusiliers, in Battle of Katia. A wonderful example of Ottoman hecinsüvar uniforms in this photo of him below (Photo source: Tasvir-i Efkar Magazine):\n\nGroup of officers from 1st Hecinsüvar Regiment or Medina Hecinsüvar Regiment operating in Hedjaz. Regt commander Maj. Mehmet Atif in the middle.\n\n[\n\nEdited 31 July , 2019 by emrezmen\n\nGrammatical correction"
