        "meta_description": "It's been a century since the last victory of the Ottoman Empire in the First World War. On April 29. 1916, Ottoman troops defeated the British army in the city of Kut in Iraq and captured 13,309 British soldiers, including six generals and 476 officers. The triumph of the Ottoman army in Kut came only a few months after its great victory in the Dardanelles in northwestern Turkey. This incident, which went down in history as the last victory of the Ottoman Empire army and a significant defeat on Britain's part, risk being forgotten as time goes by.",

        "text": "New war commanders\n\nAfter the death of Askeri, Colonel Nurettin Bey (known as Nurettin Ibrahim Konyar after 1934), who later played an important role during the Turkish War of Independence as well, assumed command of Ottoman troops as the General Commander of the Iraq area. The colonel, also known as \"Bearded Nurettin\", reached Baghdad on May 19th, 1915.\n\nBritish forces under General John Nixon's command, on the other hand, increased their number of troops, upgrading their military presence in the region to corps level. Nixon appointed Major General Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend to the command of the Sixth Indian Division of the British army. Townshend was ordered to chase the withdrawing Ottoman troops and if possible, capture Baghdad.\n\nBeing aware that the number of regular troops in the region was insufficient, Colonel Nurettin Bey withdrew his soldiers towards Baghdad in a controlled manner through tactical battles that would slow down the advance of British forces. British army captured Amara and Nasiriyah in June and July, respectively. Ottoman troops, which retreated without any losses, formed a new line of defence to the north of Kut al Amara.\n\nA German pasha in command of Ottoman army\n\nThe British campaign was increasingly becoming a serious problem both for the Ottoman Empire and their ally, Germany. Secretary of War Enver Pasha gathered the forces in Iran and Iraq, with new reinforcements, under the name of the 6th Army and appointed 72-year-old German Field Marshall Volmar von der Goltz to its command.\n\nBritish forces attacked the Ottoman line of defence above Kut al Amara on April 27th 1915. After two days of fighting, the city fell to the British. Major General Townshend fortified the city with ditches, high trenches and artillery as this location was going to be the operating centre for his Baghdad campaign.\n\nTownshend's miscalculation\n\nColonel Nurettin Bey withdrew his soldiers to the Ottoman army's last line of defence in Salman Pak, south of Baghdad. Colonel Khalil Bey, commander of the 3rd Army's Right Wing in Eastern Anatolia, which was dispatched to the region for support purposes on Enver Pasha's order, came under Colonel Nurettin Bey's command on November 15thwith two divisionshe was in command of. Khalil Bey was Enver Pasha's uncle although he was actually one year younger than him.\n\nBritish Major General Townshend ordered his troops to attack the Ottoman forces on November 22nd 1915. Unable to advance after a day-long fierce fighting, British troops started to retreat.\n\nOttoman forces followed the fleeing British soldiers. Nurettin Pasha's cavalries frequently attacked withdrawing enemy units, which forced Townshend to take refuge in Kut al Amara. The British general estimated that they could withstand a siege for two months with the ammunition and food they have, and thought they could launch an attack on Baghdad again once they received help from Basra. However, things did not turn out the way he expected.\n\nCaptured generals\n\nIn addition to diseases and lack of food, the British forces were increasingly running out of ammunition. Townshend destroyed what is left of their weapons and ammunition, and surrendered with his 13,309 men, including 6 generals and 476 officers, on April 29th 1916. This was the highest number of British troops captured in a long time.\n\nKhalil Pasha gave Townshend's sword and two guns back to him and told the British commander that from then on he was not a captive, but a guest of the sultan.\n\nAfter a siege of 147 days, captured soldiers were sent to Aleppo and various cities in Anatolia while Townshend and his officers were taken to Istanbul. Their journey from Baghdad to Istanbul took 22 days. Townshend remained in exile in Heybeliada and Büyükada for nearly 2.5 years until the end of the First World War in November 1918. Enver Pasha welcomed Townshend very warmly and made sure he felt more of a guest than a captive. Although he was under police surveillance, the British could act freely. Because Townshend was the highest ranked British soldier in Istanbul he participated in the Armistice of Mudros. When he finally returned to London in 1919, there were only his wife Alice, his elder daughter Audrey and his dog Spot at the port waiting to welcome him. The British army made it clear that he would not be given a new mission upon his return. The siege of Kut al Amara brought the end of Townshend's career.\n\nAfter Kut al Amara…\n\nDespite the Ottoman Empire gained victories in the Dardanelles and the Iraqi front, their success did not last. The British reinforced their forces in Iraq with troops from other fronts and launched another attack on Kut al Amara 8 months later – this time with an army of 50,000 soldiers.\n\nThey captured Kut al Amara on February 25th 1917, followed by Baghdad on March 11th 1917.\n\nThe victorious commander of Kut al Amara got the surname Kut after the enactment of the surname law.\n\nMajor Clement Attlee, who got seriously injured in Kut al Amara when a shell fragment hit his leg, served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951."
