        "text": "Since this section on the Ottomans is going slow here is my contribution after a few turns into the campaign on M/M and with some info I got here and there.\n\nStarting\n\nThe Ottoman Dominion is quite underdeveloped when the game begins. You have to use your money to start your economy. As for research, which is quite slow giving your 3 star scholar and your Absolute Monarchy, it needs a boost, so I think its wise to turn or two towns into schools. The first tech should probably be on artillery, since you don’t really have a line infantry to speak of, but ottomans turn to be big on cannons. Then focus on farms and technology and of course land army tech.\n\nAs suggested some where else, an early ottoman army uses artillery for range, and Jannisary Swordsmen to charge the enemy line as soon as they come to musket range.\n\nI found the kurd skirmishers you can recruit in Bagdad made a pretty decent early light infantry.\n\nSome suggest starting an early revolution to get rid of your 2 star leader. I tried that and was stuck with a 2 star president, so not really a gain there, and now I can’t rearrange my cabinet at will. So, it’s a bit of a gamble.\n\nCampaign gets going\n\nOn M/M I let the Russians get Crimea and generally keep peace on the western/northern front by giving gifts and make as many trade agreements as possible. I know Georgia, Dagestan and Persia are bound to start hostilities soon and want to keep my focus there, as Persia is a very good place to expand to: no religious unrest and plenty of riches, on the path to the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nI made an army to fend of the Georgian offensive and go on the counter attack, which took a few turns to build up, having to endure enemy raids in Armenia all that time.\n\nOnce I was ready I attacked the Georgian capital and bye bye.\n\nPersia declared war, and Dagestan followed. So I started building up in Bagdad, using the Persian raiders to train my troops, while the army in Georgia fends off the Dagestan offensive and in three turns captures it’s capital. From there I went south and captured the poorly defended Persian city. Now I can unite this army with the troops in bagdad and move into Persia. I expect the enemy to be properly crushed.\n\nI haven’t got to that point yet, but if peace holds with the Europeans, I expect the Ottoman economy to really bloom.\n\nI’ve given up on navy for the time being, I’m useless with galleys… and although there is an opportunity to build trade fleet into the Indian ocean from the start to get the early trade ports, I bypassed that, confident that my huge territory will provide the means for war.\n\nEarly Ottoman troops are underwhelming but those janissary swordsmen are good fighters and cost half the upkeep of European line infantry, you just have to go Medieval for a while. But it gets you the victories you need. You can of course build a more conventional army with the (weak) line infantry you get and take advantage of the military research you have to do anyway. Again, I think this goes with personal style.\n\nIll be back here and update once I get to India and get the better units down the line.\n\nUpdate\n\nNot quite in India yet but Persia is gone. The road to India is long and easy enough (M/M).\n\nA funny development occurred, however. I was sweeping Persia with two half stacks, one going inland the other closer to the coast, given the vastness of the territory. The northern army entered Afghanistan in order to conquer Kabul, which would be the last stand of the Persians. However, when the south army conquered the other remaining persian city, Afghanistan emerged as a nation, resulting in the immediate extinction of the Persian empire and, this is the funny part, the teleportation of my north army to Istanbul, in a tactical retreat to the \"nearest safe region\".\n\nThis was a bit of a surprise. I was planning to joint the armies to enter india and steamroll, but now i have to build up again a bit in the east. On the other hand i may need that force in the European border soon, so it may not be all that bad.\n\nFocusing on Persia had the consequence of having friendly terms with most European nations, and having trade agreements with half the known world. If Poland doesnt stirr any trouble ill go back to focusing on India.\n\nOn the units front, Jannisary Musketeers and Grenadiers are a force to be reckoned with. I am now researching European Discipline, and i wonder if i will still be able to recruit them after.\n\nAh, and 24 lbs howitzers are FUN!\n\nI will contribute my part too. I have reached all the requirement for short campaign by 1742, which means 7 specific region and control 20 (I've got 28). It is M/M. I am now just wait for 1750 and doing some extra conquering to reach for 30 regions so to prove that the long campaign can be done too.\n\nStarting\n\nI realize that the vastness of the empire at the start is a blessing and a curse.You start with 12 region. You need 20 and there is 6 specific region u need to conquer. That is 2 more nonspecific region you need. Your money income is generally sufficient with about 5000 per turn. This means you can support multiple army. This is needed as your large empire is vulnerable to multiple attack. I start of by researching carbines as it gives you a decent cavalry, the Deli horseman. Upgrading a few farms and vineyards and recruitment of a few unit already used up the treasury but it is okay because your income will cover it. The most desperate part is the north.\n\nWar with Russia\n\nYou start with having a war with Russia. I highly recommend assisting the Crimean Khanate in defending. I manage to do this because Russia (stupidly) sent multiple weak troops to attack. I were able to eliminate the army (with the Khanate's help) one by one until his attack force is gone. Then my main army (the starting one) rushed to Kiev and it is under defended. I got it and negotiated peace. Russia agreed the first Russo-Turkish war ends in my favor. This proves to be valuable. The surviving Crimean would continue to harass Russia. It even claimed tartarnya but lost quickly, but Russia is never my concern then.\n\nWar in the east\n\nGeorgia will attack u very soon after the start. Armenia is their target so you better field some defenders. Upgrading the palace would gives u the Tartar horseman, which is an excellent missile cavalry for the present purpose. You also start with an decent army near Baghdad. Recruit some Kurdish hillman and Dessert Warrior to further enhance it. Add a few artillery and you are able to attack Tbilisi. Planning is needed as it will be heavily defended. Try luring the army out by pillaging and then attack the city when the army is defeated. ETW is great in healing your unit as you can do it while besieging. Also replenish your army from Yerevan. You should succeed and Georgia is no more.\n\nHowever, by then Dangestain and Persia might have declared war on you. The war on Dangestain is almost a welcome as they have poor troops and Chechnya is one of the required region. Persia, however is a significant threat. Fortunately, they only sent troops to pillage the countryside of Mesoptamia, and i was able to defeat them. My army went on the conquer Dangestain, and they turned south to conquer Azerbaijan.\n\nWar with Persia\n\nThe Persia region is another requirement so attack Persia is inevitable. Luckily Azerbaijan is poorly defended and quickly captured. I plan to have two army to invade Persia. Unfortunately, I found myself short on money due to army upkeep. I then sent half an army to Persia. This army is defeated but it also hurts the Persian army. And my income rise back again as the army is diminished. The army from Azerbaijan then attack Isfahan and defeated the city garrison. Persia region is mine eventually. I continued to attack Baluchistan so to prevent the Persian from harassing. After the conquest, Afghanistan become an independent country and Persia is no more. Although the Afghans declared war on me a fe turn later, they are too poor to be a threat. I quickly sent my army back to the west for the war in Europe.\n\nWar against Austria\n\nIt is 1718 when i finished the Persia campaign. The game ends in 1750 and I still have 4 regions in Europe that I need to conquer. Two of them, Hungary and Vienna, is in the hand of Austria. I therefore again build up my army for an invasion. At that time, Austria is allied with Britain but at war with France and Prussia. I can peacefully build up a new army consisting of Elite troops such as Janissary Musketman and Grenadier, Howitzer and Deli Horseman. With the old army back from Russia, I am ready to attack Austria on 1725. I declared war and then Britain and some German state is with war of me because of the alliance.\n\nYour Bosnia region is directly in contact with Hungary. However, I recommend attacking Croatia first. it is lightly garrisoned and should be conquered easily. Then 3 required region (Venice, Vienna and Hungary) would be in proximity. I allied with the Prussians and they proved to be useful. After Croatia is fallen, Austria sent his garrison in Hungary to pillage: a big mistake. My army eliminated it and assaulted Hungary immediately. Hungary is fallen before Austria can say 'no'. Without the support of Hungary, I am safe to siege Vienna. Knowing that they got no help, they sally forth and is defeated. I now got Vienna by 1729. The Austrian are still annoying and I went on the conquer Transylvania and Prussia got their another region. Austria is officially good-bye.\n\nAnd interesting note is that Russia declared war on me and claimed Kiev back. But my army from Persia just arrived and take back Kiev. I decided that Russia is still too strong for my content and therefore I rushed to Muscovy and attacked. It is not fortified and my experienced army take short work on the Russians. Muscovy is mine and after settling the unhappiness, a started to tax them. The region wealth is very high! >8000. Together with Austria's tax, my treasury is now spilling.\n\nVenice and Poland\n\nNow I am 2 region short of the requirement: Venice and Galicia . I reckon that attacking Venice would be nice as they have no alliance. A assaulted Venice by 1735, after I have settled the unhappiness of the conquered region. It proves to be a little difficult because they have a high concentration of army near Venice. I have to directly assault Venice to avoid their reinforcement. They have a full good army in the city. I got my victory with heavy lost. Meanwhile, i directed another unit to Morea and got their city. Bye-bye Venetians.\n\nNow it is Poland turn to taste the ottoman army. Poland have a large army but they are of poor quality infantry. I have two full experienced army at disposal in Europe. I decided I will attack their capital and Galicia at the same time. In fact, because Warsaw is unfortified, I was able to get it quicker than the fortified city in Galicia. Nonetheless, it is fallen with minimal lost.\n\nYour army\n\nI am still getting a hang for the new battle system. But now most of the battle are victorious. The ottoman army is a bit poor actually, but not ineffective. At the start of your tech level, U can only have one line infantry ( i think it is spelled Israyleis). They are not as good as their European counterpart (They cannot dig trench while your 'mob' musketman can). Other infantry are very poor that they can never stand alone. You can use it to fill up the army to make it look big but that is all. Your Janissary Melee unit is decent, but in a time of musket they are too helpless against missile fire. You must support your infantry with Deli horseman. Although the game said it is an irregular cavalry, they are cost-effective and flexible. They have carbines so that they can fire bullet. Not very good against infantry (The counterfire would kill more), but good against other cavalry and in support of other troop. Their charge is not bad either but avoid a direct charge to regular infantry.\n\nLater, as you develop your tech, You will get the Janissary musketeer, grenadier and hand mortar. They will form the core of your army. I special mention needed to be made on the hand mortar. I think they are very effective, having the power of a grenadier with the range of a musketeer. A standard crossfire would make big losses as it seems they have longer reloading time, but they create havoc if used nicely.\n\nArtillery is the center piece of ottoman army. Make sure you research artillery tech and unlock Artillery and Howitzer. The canister short do real good damage in close range while the Howitzer can sent exploding shell, and later, Carcass shell. They are very good in supporting your army, particularly when they kill of the general from afar :p\n\nI haven't tried the late game unit, Sipahis and Nemid-I Cedit infantry. They take too long for research so I didn't used them. I think I will report back if i have used them.\n\nYour navy and trade\n\nYou start with a fifth rate as your only frigate. Your navy is bad in the start. But you can always build up a strong navy, if you have to money. You have a trade port in the Persian gulf so make a trade ship to Madagascar and grab a trade slot. You won't able to deal with the raiding pirate however. Someone else would have to deal with it. I also sent another fleet to Ivory cost and grabbed another trade slot. They are not very important as you tax is the main component of income but more money is always welcome. Generally, your navy is not much needed if no one is raiding your trade route, but always be ready. Upgrade your drydock and research tech for better ship. if you don't have the tech or money, don't worry. Actually, galley and light galley are excellent ship. They are surprisingly highly effective. I think that is because 1. They are very agile and fast 2. their cannon is in the front and the cannon more powerful than the cannon of frigate (I often see galley fire causing explosion!) 3. They are small so that cannon fire miss them more frequently. When i first counter galley from Morocco, i thought they are no big deal a bravely went into war with 7 frigate vs 22 galley. I nearly lost the battle and eventually left with one fourth rate and one Brig. And i didn't sink one galley as all of them surrendered. I added 9 galley to my navy and i start to use them to the full effect. Later, in the naval battle against Venice, my galley did all the sinking before my ship-of-the-line get to the front line. Value galley highly for their cheapness and their effectiveness. In larger battle, they are valuable support to your ship-of-the-line. Near the end, i sent my ships to rob the trade of Britain in East Indies.\n\nEconomy, Research and diplomacy\n\nThe ottoman is slow in research in the beginning. It is wise to build another college. You need to demolish some building in order to build one in the start and make sure you build it in region with high happiness. I stupidly converted a coffee shop in Anatolia into a college and with two college i was having hapiness issues. After several conquest, i got college in Georgia and Persia, and then i built one in Rumelia, Mesopotamia and Eygpt. This bring 6 college and my industrial and enlightenment tech is on par with advance country while my military tech outpaced them by several tier. Conquest seems to be the key to development.\n\nYou rely on tax greatly. Therefore, do not have a tax rate too high for the noble. That way, the region wealth can properly develop. Also, conquer rich region such as Persia, Muscovy, Venice and Vienna quickly. Trade is secondary but try open any trade agreement and get trade theater slot.\n\nDiplomacy in ETW is greatly improved. Now country would form blocks. Ally with the french is good as France is prone to declarwar on Austrians. I didn't allied to France but to Prussia. Prussia shares almost all enemy with you: Austria, Poland and Russia. They start out weak so helping them is helping you. Britain would probably be mad at you for allying with France so don't bother. In India, i think it is better to ally with Maratha Confederacy instead of the Muslim Mughal. They would lose the war against Maratha. You have no worry on your eastern border once you eliminated Persia no matter you allied to who however. Again, the Crimean Khanahe it useful in the north. The same cannot be said to the barbary state. Expect it to be overpowered both at sea and on land.\n\nI hope I can help with all these experience to other gamers who are trying as the ottoman. Good luck\n\nGood guides from my esteemed colleagues above ^\n\nJust want to add a bit from my (ongoing) world domination campaign.\n\nWith a target of 40 unspecified provinces to hold, the world is literally your oyster. Starting out, my strategy was to become a great caliph, ruler of all the Muslim world. Key elements of the strategy where:\n\n-To placate the north and north east of my territory, focusing on peace and trade with Europe (most specificaly Austria, Poland and Russia)\n\n-Expanding first into Georgia & Dagestan, then through Perisa and on into India, absorbing Mughal territories\n\n-After consolidating in India, I would focus on expanding west, absorbing the Barbary states and Morocco\n\nOn Governance & happiness:\n\nOne of the features new to ETW is different political systems and gameplay effects. The Ottoman empire is ruled by a pretty redundant Sultan (2 stars) and a cabinet of semi competent ministers. Monarchies have no choice over their ruler (other than by revolution of the nobility), but are pretty much free to make as many changes to ministers as they like (as long as you don't fire EVERYONE and run out of replacements). Ministers also serve for life, so if they are good at their jobs, you will reap the benefits of their competance for quite a while (at least 20 years on average). Exploit this by shuffling your cabinet and getting the best out of all available ministers.\n\nIndustrialisation and tech development will however increase the unhappiness of the masses. Monarchies have a penalty to the happyness of \"the proles\" too, so you will need to take steps to mitigate discontent in your most developped regions, hand in hand with development. Madrassas, in spreading the \"opium of the masses\" provide a happiness to the working class and Coffee houses also provide bonuses to the happiness of both working and ruling classes.\n\nIt's probably a good idea to plan ahead, if you want to remain a monarchy expect to have to recruit garrisons for your major regions (without dragoons for police duty) and run with falling taxes for the working class. Personaly, I planned when to have a revolution and factored it into my ongoing plans (after conquering the Mughals).\n\nA few recomendations for the conduct and planning of a revolution:\n\n-a revolution takes 3 turns of rioting in your capital province to happen, and 1 turn of victorious revolution to be enacted.\n\n-you should aim not to be engaged in combat with other nations during a revolution as you will lose control of any units outside of the capital region whilst playing as the rebels.\n\n-you should remove any troops from the capital to make capturing it with your revolutionary army easier\n\n-to promote discontent: industrialise (the presence of a traditional or modern university will help alot!), remove pleasure increasing buildings (madrassas & coffee houses), raise taxes and reduce garrisons.\n\n-in provoking discontent among \"the masses\", endaevour to minimise the same feelings throughout the rest of your empire by tax control, exemption and garrisoning. Ideally, only the capital region should strike. Otherwise, you could provoke rebelions in other territories that will be messy to put down.\n\n-consider the negative penalty to existing relations with other countries if you move away from the same ruling system as theirs.\n\nOn trade:\n\nAs mentioned above, I aimed to treat as much of europe as possible as cutomers for my trade and goods. In fact, where i am now in the 1740's, Britain, the Netherlands and France all have massive pirate fleets feeding off each other's trade with me on the atlantic routes! Remember that long standing trade improves relations over time, i am now at least friendly with all major European powers.\n\nThe ottomans have several starting advantages and opportunities:\n\n1, you can build cotton plantations in Syria, Mesopotamia and Egypt to trade this resource with Europe off the bat\n\n2, You have a lot of territories with a lot of coast line and can afford to go trade port crazy (although more than one in each region might disadvantage population growth -especially in Gaza and and Syria)\n\n3, which means more possible trade routes than there are factions from a very early stage -goods to market :)\n\n4, other than the UP, you are the closest in the European theatre to the East indies. Your port on the mesopotamian coast that can send trade ships to Madagascar and the East indies quickly -make it yours!\n\nThe downside?\n\n1, your trade ships (Dromons) are weak, very weak and will get pasted by as much as a merchantman.\n\n2, your mediteranean ships and trade have to go through the straights of gibraltar -avoid war with Morocco, Portugal or Spain before you are in a position to assert your \"authoritah\" over their waters.\n\n3, having to set out from greece, your early trade fleets will be disadvantaged in terms of getting to trade nodes first -you should still be able to claim at least one node in each western theatre though.\n\nOn research:\n\nBeing a monarchy, you have penalties to research, but having so many large cities means you can counter-act the effect by building observatories everywhere. You also only start with only one school in Anatolia (Konya). I added one in Mesopotamia (Mosul) and Egypt (Asyut), and would recommend developping one of the towns that emerges in Rumelia asap as otherwise your enlightenment tech will be stunted untill you build a modern university there!\n\nFirst few turns:\n\nStarting out, you have a lot of fairly poor territories, but an oddly high number of large regional capitals (with full options for building).\n\nHighlights of the first few turns were: Sacrificing the Crimean Khanate for peace with Russia, repeling Venetian attacks on Athens from Moravia, ditching the alliance with the Barbary states in favour of peace with Austria -and building up the internal economy of my provinces.\n\nI chose to focus military infrastructure development closest to likely threats: Baghdad (Georgia, Dagestan & Perisa) and Athens (Venice).\n\nMoravia is fairly easy to capture by building up a force of Bashi bouzouks and Isaraelys and counter attacking after one of their assaults on Athens.\n\nAfter making peace with Russia, your Army in Europe can be shipped over to Georgia for an amphibious assault that can help draw the Georgian army out of their capital.\n\nMid-term:\n\nOnce your territory has been consolidated by the capture of Moravia, Georgia and Dagestan -and providing you aren't at war with anyone in Europe, Persia looms large as the gateway to the riches of India.\n\nThe whole of Persia can be conquered with 2 full stacks -ideally those troops blooded by conflict with Georgia and Dagestan. One army should attack Azerbijan, the other go for Isfahan (or wever the Persian capital is called) and can then continue to steam-roller through Persia's territories, north and south.\n\nThis same approach can be continued and applyed to the Mughal territories, one stack moving along the Ganges and the other inland, parralel to the Maratha border.\n\nOnce both Perisa and Mughal India have been \"collected\", you should have a huge income from trade and taxes. You will also be in a very strong position to either annex the rest of India, or shift your focus to Europe -or even America!\n\nOttoman on vh/vh is tedious and frustrating the first 10 turns or so. By turn 5 you are fighting Russia, Austria, Persia, Georgia, Venice and dhakistan soon follows.\n\nDon't worry about trade. You will be blockaded. I suggest breaking alliance with barbary so your trade with GB isn't hijacked.\n\nIf you are going to make ports then at least stick a peasant unit in it to keep it from being looted, because Venice and Austria will be all up in your stuff. Their fleet is a bunch of brigs and 6th rates, but you will have scant money to blow on a navy with all your land wars.\n\nI played defensive with Austria. Your forts in that area are a godsend, as they are on hills. I took Croatia and Translvania from Austria with little fight after sending a diversionary looting force in to draw his main force. Same turn I took those, I sold them to Prussia for cheap, which gives me a buffer against Austria and only one place to attack from, which now holds a fort.\n\nRussia is tricky. I took Russia Provinces and gave them to Crimean because I didn't have the time or money to garrison so many useless vast areas. Crim usually pays 1-2k for them, but is horrible at managing reinforcements and I would sometimes have to garrison the province for him until he managed to get an army there 5 turns later, despite having a full stack of units in his town and his port.\n\nI took Ukrained and Moscow on several occasions, but if Russia had a strong force nbearby ready to counterattack I would sell the region to Sweden for 4-5k. Russia would take it back, then I'd be back in a few years to take it for good.\n\nGeorgian and Khan are tough nuts to crack as they have line inf, cossacks and lots of horses. I mobbed them with cheap troops. They are also uneasy regions to control, so expect to build repression and happiness building early on. Get rid of the schools, you will have plenty places for schools later.\n\nPersia is your bread and butter. It's as vast and profitable as Moscow but without the enemies and religious unrest. You have to push to Persia. You will likely need to take the province next to Gerogia first to at least prevent a ninja attack on you, but thi sserves to draw some troops out of Persia.\n\nOnce you take Persia don't attack Afghanastan, hit the region due east. Afghan will turn into its own nation after you take the east province. It will also attack you, eventually, so don't let it fester and remember it takes forever to get there, but it does give you a breather for your army. Assuming your general has survived the Persia campaign, he should be pretty uber by now. Mine is hero-worshipped and gets +5 morale all battles, +2 for cavalry, +1 for arty, +1 for inf, so if I have all 3 i get +9 per, he also has a surgeon, and has a -5% chance of dying from natural causes. Move him to your european front ASAP\n\nnote: all of the above mentioned wars I did simeltaneoulsy. It sucked, a lot of my regions were temporarily lost, a lot of my settlements were burned, but I funded my effort by selling Russian provinces to Crimea and Sweden.\n\nRemember that Persia has upgraded roads so they can hit you from far away on raids.\n\nHEre are the most imporant things to remember as ottoman:\n\n1-you have to fight the small fights, don't autoreslove, as AR tends to let units get away, who will then retreat behind your lines and plunder your settlements with their uber unit of 14 peasants. You have far too much going on to have to chase these guys down and pay for repairs.\n\n2-Although your trade is insignificant until you deal with Persia, Russia and contain Austria and Venice -- put peasant units in all your ports and fisheries.\n\n3-get roads up on your internal holdings ASAP as it only helps them grow and profit over time, but avoid them on your front lines as they only give the enemy mobility.\n\n4-even without Ukraine and Moscow, your base holdings +the persian territories will provide you with more than enough income to garrison you border with austria and continue building infrastructure and making a navy. So peace with Russia may be an option, at the expense of Crimean, and some may say its better to kill Crim yourself.\n\n5-good bayonets are a necessity early on\n\nIt is now 1745, I'm starting to take trade nodes from austria and venice, my trade is taking off, Austria and Venice are contained, Prussia is the second super power and britain the third. Not sure when it happened, but around 1734 I razed a lot of buildings and made a lot of schools and had a tech boom, which shot me far ahead on prestige. I'll have to fight Prussian soon as they are about to start taking land from my protectorate, then I'll move west from there.\n\n\\\n\nThe ottoman Empire is a paper tiger in the hands of the game's AI. In every campaign I have played with the AI controlling it the OE pretty much doesnt do anything other than spawn ships. When they do attack its a small raiding army of inferior units easily defeated. Heck, in one campaign (My second French campaign) Venice is kicking the Ottoman's butts in the Balkans. Giving them all kinds of trouble and taking territory.\n\nSo, I decided to give the OE a try on N/N. See for myself how weak they are. Its a tough go in the very beginning. I let Russia have the Crimea Khanate. I gave Russia 5,000 to get a peace treaty on the first turn (They wouldnt take less ). Giving up that much money at the beginning is very hard but it pays off in the long run. Russia hasnt come after me once. Hopefully they never will.\n\nUnfortunately for me Venice attacked Athens on turn two and Persia attacked turn three. Then Georgia attacked a turn after that. Somehow I manged to fend off the Venetian army and pushed them back and took their Greek region. They sent a two unit army at first and I survived that attack. Then I managed to get a few units together in Athens and went after Venice's Western Greek regional capitol. It was a tough battle but I managed to win! After pushing Venice out of the Balkans they have stayed in their homeland and not bothered me since. They wont make peace though no matter what I offer. Stubborn Venetians!\n\nI managed to get some Israelis(I know its not spelled that way) units going by this time and held off the Persian's two and three unit raiding stacks while I sent a three quarter stack against the full Georgian stack that was working its way west towards Ankara. They had already captured my Armenian region. After defeating the Georgia army near Ankara I recaptured Armenia from them and then went on to taking the Georgia homeland itself. After that I invaded Dagestan and captured it because I figured they would eventually come after me as well. I didnt want a possible enemy at my back once I turned south.\n\nBy this time I could build those Jannisary Musketeer units. Its important to get these guys as quickly as possible. I then was able to focus on Persia. With just one army consisting of a General, three 18lb cannons, and 16 Janni Musketeer units I slowly worked my way through Persia. Afganistan rebelled and became its own nation after the main Persian region fell to my army. Its next on my list to attack and then onto the Mughals and the Indian subcontinent. I'm somewhere between 1715 and 1720 right now.\n\nDuring all this time I traded money and tech for any and all the trade agreements and tech I could get out of the the major and minor nations. I'm on good relations with most and have trade going with many as well. I have no alliances. I havent made any since I figure it would be best to stay neutral as much as possible since the OE is a weak faction in the beginning and needs to avoid war as much as possible. Especially a two front war. This has been a key advantage for my OE campaign. I'm letting the other nations fight amongst themselves while I just trade with everyone I can. I only have two colleges so tech building is slow. One college is in Anatolia and the other is in Persia. I'll add a third somewhere in India when the time comes.\n\nCurrently I have one full stack army in the field. Its in Persia at the moment working south and east. I have a 5 unit army following it to hold towns and cities as I take them. Once the region is secure I move on. I have about a 4,000 profit at the beginning of every turn to build and develope my economy and resupply my army. I have no trade nodes. The beginning navy is no match against other nations. Venice alone can field a better navy as can the Barbary Pirates so I'm relying on taxes so far. But I do have the ability to build 4th rates now thanks to some tech trading I managed to accomplish.\n\nI keep two units in all my regional capitols to keep the peace. That seems to be enough to keep them from rebelling and keeping the people happy with my taxes set for 3 for the upper class and the lower class set at 2. This dosent allow for much tax money but for fielding just one full army stack its sufficient. Economy building is slow though. Thats the Ottomans problem in this game. No developed economy and a large empire to run. Money, or the lack of it, is a huge issue right from the start.\n\nSo far this strategy is working for me. Of course if anyone like Russia or Austria invade then my thinly defended borders will collapse quickly but so far they are tied down in their own quarrels against others. I just need to get down into India and conquor the Mughals, Mysore, and the Marathas before the European nations get wise to my lightly defended borders. If I can conquor India then it'll boost my profits by a huge amount. Enough to fund my European invasion.\n\nIf you want a challenge the Ottoman Empire is a good choice. At least so far it has for me."
