        "text": "Ruled by the Al Thani family, Qatar had been under Ottoman suzerainty since January 1872, part of the Ottoman empire’s wider expansion into Eastern Arabia (Anscombe, The Ottoman Gulf. For late nineteenth century Ottoman activities elsewhere on its frontiers, see Rogan, Frontiers of the State in the Late Ottoman Empire: Transjordan, 1850–1921 and Minawi, The Ottoman Scramble for Africa). The Emir of Qatar acted as the Ottoman qaim maqam, or Governor. Qatari conflict with the Ottomans over taxation and the imposition of administrative reforms resulted in the battle of al-Wajbah in March 1893. Qatar’s defeat of the Ottomans at that battle meant the Emirate became a more autonomous part of the empire. This greater autonomy enabled the Al Thani family to further consolidate their control over the Qatari peninsula (Zahlan, The Creation of Qatar). However, one important limit to Qatari autonomy was the continued presence of an Ottoman garrison at al-Bidda, nearby the Qatari capital of Doha.\n\nThe outbreak of war between Britain and the Ottomans in November 1914 presented a political opportunity for both Britain and Qatar’s Emir, Abdullah Bin Jassim Al Thani, to re-position Qatar’s political status. Britain wanted Qatar to become part of the Gulf protectorate system, and Al Thani wanted to further the Emirate’s development. These positions were not oppositional, as Al Thani calculated that Qatar’s territorial integrity needed protection by an external power, in order for the Emirate’s internal development to continue. Within the Gulf protectorate system, British authorities in India felt they could ‘start afresh’ in relations with Qatar, freed from having to consider any hostile Ottoman response to British dealings with the Emirate (Deputy Secretary, Foreign and Political Department, Government of India, to Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 13 May 1915, Records of Qatar, Vol. 4, 430 (hereafter RoQ)). Officials in London wanted to conclude a Treaty of Protection with Qatar during wartime, so it could serve as an ‘accomplished fact’ when discussing Arabia’s future with other powers, even though it was considered unlikely that France or Russia would question Britain’s ‘paramount position’ in the region.\n\nThe main obstacle to Britain’s wartime objectives in Qatar was the fact on the ground of the Ottoman garrison at al-Bidda. British officials in the Gulf monitored the garrison closely throughout 1914. The Political Agent in Bahrain reported to his superior in Bushire that most of the Ottoman troops embarked with their stores at the beginning of September 1914, but when they learnt Basra was ‘closed’ they disembarked (Keyes, Political Agent, Bahrain, to Knox, 11 September 1914, RoQ, Vol. 4, 425). While the Ottoman garrison was not a significant force, with only ninety men remaining by May 1915 due to repeated desertions, officials in India felt negotiations could not be opened with Al Thani until the garrison — the last vestige of Ottoman power in Qatar — had been ejected. Britain had a shortage of ships and men in the Gulf to tackle the garrison, given the ongoing campaign in Mesopotamia (Iraq), and the colonial authorities in India had prioritised negotiations with Ibn Saud in Najd over Al Thani in 1915. The Viceroy of India thought that Al Thani was not entirely secure in his position; he apparently had ‘some difficulty in holding his own’ (Viceroy of India to Knox, 6 May 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 524). Britain’s manpower and materiel shortages led Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to send a captive Ottoman officer, Abdul Jabbar Effendi, to Qatar in June 1915. His task was to induce the garrison at al-Bidda to surrender peacefully. The terms of surrender were that the garrison would be transported to Bahrain with full military honours, where they would be then be shipped to India and become prisoners of war in a ‘cool [hill] station’ and ‘looked after’. Even if the Ottoman officer’s mission was successful, Britain had no ships to transport the men, so Cox wanted Al Thani to provide the garrison with shipping to leave Qatar (Cox to Al Thani, 27 June 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 435; Memorandum for Abdul Jaffar Effendi, undated, RoQ, Vol. 4, 437). The garrison decided not to take their fellow soldier’s offer from the British. By August 1915, some of the men had made their way across the Gulf to Persia, leaving only two officers and forty men left in the fort. The Ottoman commandant wrote to Al Thani, informing him of his intention to try to reach Baghdad via Kuwait (Keyes to Knox, 10 August 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 438). Although the Ottoman garrison still existed, its ability to exercise any control over Al Thani and Qatar had been eliminated by its isolation from other Ottoman forces, and the decisions of individual soldiers to leave Qatar to either continue their fight against the Allies elsewhere, or simply leave military service altogether.\n\nUltimately, given the military situation in the Middle East, the understandable lack of interest evinced by the Ottoman army and Ottomans authorities in their Qatar garrison led the remainder of the Ottoman soldiers there to take their future in their own hands. On 19 August 1915, Major T.H. Keyes, Bahrain’s Political Agent, arrived in Qatar with two Royal Navy ships. Keyes offered Al Thani five thousand rupees to approach the Ottoman commandant and re-iterate the terms previously outlined to them by Abdul Jabbar Effendi. But before negotiations were opened, the Ottoman soldiers abandoned the fort on 20 August 1915, disappearing into the Qatari night. A British landing party subsequently occupied the fort. Three guns, five hundred shells and 8,000 rounds of ammunition found in the fort were given to Al Thani (Administration Report of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, 1915: Chapter X, Administration Report for the Bahrain Agency, 1915, 49, Persian Gulf Administrative Reports, Vol. 7; Zahlan, Creation of Qatar, 59. Keyes to Cox, Political Resident Persian Gulf, 23 August 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 440–441). In Sir Percy Cox’s words, the Qatar question was now ‘disposed of’ (Cox to Government of India, 26 August 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 450). After the Ottomans garrison’s departure, Qatar remained a place where a handful of Ottoman deserters from other fighting fronts washed up, as workers in the local fishing fleet (Keyes, Political Agent Bahrain, to Cox, Political Resident Persian Gulf, 23 August 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 439). The demands of fighting on multiple fronts meant the Ottomans allowed their approximately forty year old suzerainty over Qatar to wither away, the timing of which was dictated by the local Ottoman commandant and his men, and prompted by the arrival of British forces off the Emirate’s shore, rather than by Ottoman leaders in Istanbul.\n\nThe First World War had hastened the end of Ottoman power in Qatar, and left the political field open for Al Thani and Britain to forge a new relationship, with Britain as the dominant power. The negotiations and terms for the treaty between the two states shared many features with protectorate treaties that the British had signed with other rulers in the region, and across Africa and Asia. Preliminary negotiations showed the limits of British power over Al Thani, and the Emir’s power over his subjects. The Emir felt he could not accept draft articles that limited the import duties on British goods, the posting of a British Agent in his capital of Doha, the establishment of a British-run Post and Telegraph office, and the free admission of British subjects (who would in practice largely by Indian colonial subjects) to the Emirate (Cox to Government of India, 17 April 1916, RoQ, Vol. 4, 530). The Emir told British officials he adopted this stance because Qataris were ‘strongly anti-foreign and that he would be in constant fear of trouble resulting to himself from the bad treatment of such persons by his people’. Al Thani apparently showed ‘so much distress of mind’ regarding this that British negotiators moved onto other points, and were willing to let these clauses drop (Grey, Political Agent, Kuwait to Cox, 20 October 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 539). The Viceroy of India, who believed those draft clauses were ‘of no great importance’, approved of this negotiating position (Telegram from Viceroy of India, 2 June 1916, RoQ, Vol. 4, 544). Senior British officials thought it far more important to secure a treaty, one that specifically including articles that exclude external powers from involvement in Qatar, thereby removing another potential chink in the armour of their Gulf protectorate system.\n\nQatar signed a Treaty of Protection with Britain on 3 November 1916, which was similar to 1892 agreements with other Gulf rulers. The most important conditions were that the Emir could not cede territory or have relations or correspondence with foreign powers without British consent; a British Agent would be stationed in the Emirate (an consequential concession by the Emir); British subjects would be admitted to the Emirate (yet another concession), and Qatar would not engage in piracy, slavery or arms trafficking. Yet significantly, given British concerns over Al Thani’s internal position, articles such as the stationing of Political Agent remained inoperative, and the ruler’s family could retain their slaves (Draft Agreement Between the British Government and the Shaikh of Qatar, 14 August 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 432; Zahlan, Creation of Qatar, 60; Final Agreement Ratified by Government of India, RoQ, Vol. 4, 567–568). Britain was in fact allowed to establish a telegraph and post office station in Qatar, to bolster the connective hardware of its imperial system in the Gulf (Final Agreement Ratified by Government of India, 3 November 1916, RoQ, Vol. 4, 567–568). The treaty enabled British officials to proffer advice to Al Thani regarding Qatar’s internal governance. Keyes wrote to Al Thani that ‘it is by organisation of officials that the Western Powers prevail, and I trust that you will understand this’, and suggested appointing competent officials, and ensuring government administration did not cause discontent among Al Thani’s subjects (Keyes to Al Thani, undated, RoQ, Vol. 4, 446). The war’s disruption of Gulf politics meant Qatar became a firm part of Britain’s informal empire.\n\nFor Al Thani, his concessions to Britain on Qatar’s sovereignty, and unsolicited British advice on internal governance, were outweighed by two conditions. The first was Al Thani’s ability to import 1,000 rifles and ammunition every year for his own use ‘and the arming of his dependents’, which was crucial for ensuring his rule internally, and externally; the second was the article that bound Britain to protect Al Thani and his subjects (Draft Agreement between the British Government and Shaikh of Qatar, 14 August 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 433). After formally signing the treaty, Al Thani asked for 150 rifles and 15,000 rounds of ammunition. The Government of India over-delivered on Al Thani’s request, sending 300 rifles with 30,000 rounds as a gift (Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to Foreign Secretary, Government of India, 26 December 1916, RoQ, Vol. 4, 559). The terms of protection were carefully worded. Britain promised to protect Qatar ‘from all aggression by sea’, a remote prospect given the Royal Navy’s presence in the Gulf, and the commitment to British protection from land attack was ambiguous: only if aggression was ‘unprovoked by any act or aggression on the part of myself [the Emir] or my subjects against others’, which gave Britain a wide degree of latitude in interpreting this article to their advantage (Draft Agreement between the British Government and Shaikh of Qatar, 14 August 1915, RoQ, Vol. 4, 433). Qatar’s survival as an autonomous polity was now dependent on Britain.\n\nThe dispersal of the Ottoman garrison in Qatar in 1915 was a small military footnote in Britain’s war against the Ottomans. Yet its consequences were hugely significant for Qatar, and, indeed, long lasting. The forces of Ibn Saud nearby in Najd threatened Qatar’s existence several times in the aftermath of the war (See Zahlan, Creation of Qatar, for an analysis of Saudi-Qatari disputes in the post-1918 period). Like Kuwait, Qatar’s enmeshment in the British protectorate system ensured its survival in the face of the Saudi threat. The effects of the First World War on Qatar presented a serious challenge for its ruler, as Al Thani deftly navigated his way from one political suzerain to another, but it ultimately guaranteed Qatar’s survival as a distinct polity — an outcome which eluded other British allies in the Arabian peninsula, such as Asir and the Hijaz."
