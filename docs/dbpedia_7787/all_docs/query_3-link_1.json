        "text": "The 16th-century conquest of Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and the Hejaz brought the holiest cities of Islam, the most important of the pilgrimage routes, and all the former seats of the caliphate under Ottoman rule and thereby reinforced the dynasty’s claim to supreme leadership within the Sunni Muslim world. In Iraq, Ottoman rule represented the victory of Sunnism. Although the Shiʿi notables of southern Iraq continued to enjoy considerable local influence and prestige, they were inclined to identify with Shiʿi Iran and to resent the Sunni-dominated Ottoman administration. Control of the trade routes passing through the Red Sea and up the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and from Iran to Anatolia, Syria, and the Mediterranean was an important element in the sultan’s efforts to ensure that east-west trade would continue to flow through his territories despite the newly opened sea routes around Africa. But, perhaps most important, Iraq served as a buffer zone, a shield protecting Ottoman Anatolia and Syria against encroachments from Iran or by the intractable Arab and Kurdish tribes.\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Iraq\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Mohammed Shia al-Sudani\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 44,528,0002\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Abdul Latif Rashid\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nmultiparty republic with one legislative house (Council of Representatives of Iraq [3291])\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 6:06 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nTurkiye, Iraq agree on military pact against Kurd separatists\n\nAug. 15, 2024, 3:45 AM ET (Deutsche Welle)\n\nIraqi bill would roll back women's and children's rights\n\nAug. 15, 2024, 12:14 AM ET (Deutsche Welle)\n\nAssault on family law: Iraq moving further from democracy?\n\nAug. 14, 2024, 4:36 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nIraq initials 13 exploration deals as seeks to focus on natural gas\n\nAug. 14, 2024, 2:36 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nTurkey, Iraq to hold new round of security talks in Ankara, source says\n\nSüleyman’s imposition of direct rule over Iraq involved such traditional Ottoman administrative devices as the appointment of governors and judges, the stationing of Janissaries (elite soldiers) in the provincial capitals, and the ordering of cadastral surveys. Timars (military fiefs), however, were few except in some areas in the north. Although the pasha of Baghdad was accorded a certain preeminence as governor of the most important city in Ottoman Iraq (as was the governor of Damascus in Syria), this in no way implied the unity of the five eyālets.\n\nThe local despotisms in the 17th century\n\nIn the 17th century the weakening of the central authority of the Ottoman government gave rise to local despotisms in the Iraqi provinces, as it did elsewhere in the empire. A tribal dynasty, the Banū Khālid, ruled Al-Hasa as governors from the late 16th century to 1663; and in 1612 Afrāsiyāb, a military man of uncertain origin, purchased the governorship of Basra, which remained in his family until 1668. With the permission and even the encouragement of these autonomous governors, British, Dutch, and Portuguese merchants who were already actively involved in Red Sea trade gained a strong foothold in Basra.\n\nAn officer and faction leader of the Janissary garrison in Baghdad, Bakr Ṣū Bāshī, revolted in the early 17th century and negotiated with the Safavid Shah ʿAbbās I in order to strengthen his position. In the ensuing struggle the Ottomans managed to retain control over Mosul and Shahrizūr, but central Iraq, including Baghdad, was under Safavid rule from 1623 until the Ottoman sultan Murad IV drove the Iranians out again in 1638. Whereas the Safavid occupation of Baghdad had been accompanied by the destruction of some Sunni mosques and other buildings and had resulted in death or slavery for several thousand people, mostly Sunnis, many of the city’s Shiʿi inhabitants lost their lives when the Ottomans returned to Baghdad.\n\nThe Treaty of Qaṣr-e Shīrīn (also called the Treaty of Zuhāb) of 1639 brought an end to 150 years of intermittent warfare between the Ottomans and Safavids and established a boundary between the two empires that remained virtually unchanged into modern times. Ottoman sovereignty had been restored in Baghdad, but the stability of central Iraq continued to be disturbed by turbulent garrison troops and by Arab and Kurdish tribal unrest. In the south too, even though the autonomous rule of the Afrāsiyāb dynasty was ended in 1668, Ottoman authority was soon challenged by the Muntafiq and Ḥawīza tribes of desert and marsh Arabs. Iranians took advantage of this disturbed state of affairs to infiltrate southern Iraq. Only after the Ottomans suffered defeat in a European war and negotiated the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699 was the sultan able to dispatch troops to Iraq and recover Basra.\n\nDevelopments in Iraq in the mid- and late 17th century reflected the disordered state of affairs in Istanbul. The energetic and effective reign of Murad IV was followed by that of the incompetent İbrahim I (1640–48), known as “Deli (the Mad) Ibrahim,” who was eventually deposed and strangled and was succeeded by his six-year-old son, Mehmed IV (1648–87). The protracted crisis in the capital had an unsettling effect everywhere in the empire, undoing the reforms of Murad IV and bringing political and economic chaos.\n\nThe 18th-century Mamluk regime\n\nThe early 18th century was a time of important changes both in Istanbul and in Baghdad. The reign of Sultan Ahmed III (1703–30) was marked by relative political stability in the capital and by extensive reforms—some of them influenced by European models—implemented during the “Tulip Period” (Lāle Devri, 1718–30) by Grand Vizier İbrahim Paşa.\n\nIn Baghdad, Hasan Paşa (1704–24), the Ottoman governor of Georgian origin sent from Istanbul, and his son Ahmed Paşa (1724–47) established a Georgian mamlūk (slave) household, through which they exercised authority and administered the province. The mamlūks (Turkish: kölemen) were mostly Christian slaves from the Caucasus who converted to Islam, were trained in a special school, and were then assigned to military and administrative duties. Hasan Paşa made himself indispensable to the Ottoman government by curbing the unruly tribes and regularly remitting tribute to the treasury in Istanbul, and Ahmed Paşa played a crucial role in defending Iraq against yet another Iranian military threat. These pashas extended their authority beyond the eyālet of Baghdad to include Mārdīn, ʿUrfa, and much of Kurdish Shahrizūr and thus dominated the northern trade routes and secured additional sources of revenue. They also held sway over Basra and the trade lanes leading to the Persian Gulf, Arabia, and India. Mosul retained its separate provincial status and from 1726 to 1834 was governed by members of the powerful Jalīlī family. But, whereas the Jalīlīs, whose relationship to the sultan had some characteristics of vassalage, regularly made military contributions to Ottoman campaigns beyond their provincial frontiers, the pashas of Baghdad did not. The military forces at their disposal remained in Iraq, guarding against tribal unrest and threats from Iran.\n\nAfter the collapse of Safavid power in 1722, first the Afghans and later Nādir Shah(1736–47) seized power in Iran, which led to a resumption of hostilities in Ottoman Iraq. In 1733, before assuming the title of shah, Nādir unsuccessfully besieged Baghdad. He also failed to capture Mosul in 1742, and a settlement was reached in 1746 that confirmed the terms of the Treaty of Qaṣr-e Shīrīn. The assistance provided by the pashas of Baghdad and Mosul in countering the Iranian threat further enhanced their value in the eyes of the sultan’s government and improved their position in their respective provinces.\n\nWhen Ahmed Paşa died in 1747, shortly after the death of Nādir Shah, his mamlūks constituted a powerful self-perpetuating elite corps of some 2,000 men. After attempts to prevent these mamlūks from assuming power failed, the Ottomans were obliged to accept their rule. By 1750 Süleyman Abū Layla, son-in-law of Ahmed Paşa and already governor of Basra, had reentered Baghdad and been recognized as the first Mamluk pasha of Iraq.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, Iraqi political history is largely the story of the autonomous Georgian Mamluk regime. This regime succeeded in suppressing revolts, curbed the power of the Janissaries, and restored order and some degree of prosperity to the region. In addition, it countered the Muntafiq threats in the south and made Basra a virtual dependency of Baghdad. Following the example set by the Afrāsiyābs in the preceding century, the Mamluks encouraged European trade by permitting the British East India Company to establish an agency in Basra in 1763. Their failure to develop a regular system of succession and the gradual formation of several competing Mamluk households, however, resulted in factionalism and instability, which proved advantageous to a new ruler of Iran.\n\nKarīm Khan Zandended the anarchy after Nādir Shāh’s assassination and from 1765 ruled over most of Iran from Shīrāz. Like the Mamluk rulers of Iraq, he was interested in the economic returns derived from fostering European trade in the Persian Gulf. His brother, Ṣādiq Khan, took Basra in 1776 after a protracted and stubborn resistance directed by its Mamluk governor, Süleyman Ağa, and held it until Karīm Khan’s death in 1779. Süleyman then returned from Shīrāz, where he had been held captive, and in 1780 was given the governorship of Baghdad, Basra, and Shahrizūr by Sultan Abdülhamid I (1774–80). He was known as Büyük (the Great) Süleyman Paşa, and his rule (1780–1802) is generally acknowledged to represent the apogee of Mamluk power in Iraq. He imported large numbers of mamlūks to strengthen his own household, curbed the factionalism among rival households, eliminated the Janissaries as an independent local force, and fostered trade and agriculture. His attempts to control the Arab Bedouin were less successful, and Wahhābī incursions from Arabia into Al-Hasa and along the fringes of the desert, climaxing in the sack of the Shiʿi shrine at Karbala in 1801, added to his difficulties."
