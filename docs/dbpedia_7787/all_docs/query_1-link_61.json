        "text": "George F Nafziger will be known to many already. Over the last forty years he has produced a mass of extremely detailed Orders of Battle totaling nearly 8,000 different OOB’s ranging from 1600 to 1945 and produced a number of books on various aspects of military history. Having retired, George donated his entire collection to the US Army Command and General Staff College. Some of this collection is available online, but not the Napoleonic collection of over 1,600 OOB’s. Therefore, George Nafziger has very kindly provided his complete Napoleonic collection to the Waterloo Association who have arranged for it to be placed on the Napoleon Series website to ensure that it is maintained for the future."
