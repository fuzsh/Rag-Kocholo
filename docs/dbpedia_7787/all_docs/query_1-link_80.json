Being only temporary measures on the part of the Commanders-in-Chief, they belong more to a history of the military operations of that time then to a survey of the basic changes in the composition and nomenclature of the forces, and therefore only those Government orders will be presented below which directed changes that were not just applicable to wartime.\n\n11 March 1813â The Borodinskii [Borodino] and Tarutinskii [Tarutino]Pekhotnye polki were established, assigned to the 23rd Division (56).\n\n16 March 1813â The 1-i, 2-i, 3-i, and 4-i Morskie polki [Marine regiments], each consisting of three four-company battalions, and the four-company Kaspiiskii Morskoi batalion [Caspian Marine Battalion] were transferred from the Navy Department [Morskoe vedomstvo] to the Military-Land [i.e. Army] Department [Voenno-Sukhoputnoe vedomstvo].

The 12 Zapasnyi and 8 Reservnyi battalions of the 8th, 10th, 12th, and 22nd Divisions, left in Bessarabia and the New Russia Territory, were used to form these regiments (59).\n\n4 November 1813â Of the regiments listed above, the Krasinskii was named the 54-i Yegerskii [54th JÃ¤gers], the Rostovskii â the 55-i, and the Benderskii â the 56-i (60).\n\n3 April 1814â The 1st, 3rd, 8th, 14th, 26th, and 29th JÃ¤ger regiments, in recognition of the distinction they showed in the past war with France, were titled Grenadier JÃ¤gers [Grenaderskie Yegerskie], with retention of their previous numbers and with inclusion into the Grenadier Corps [Grenaderskii Korpus], which at this time was formed from the three Grenadier divisions, with regiments assigned to these divisions as follows:\n\nIn the 1st Grenadier Division â Yekaterinoslavl, Graf Arakcheevâs, Kexholm, and Pernau Grenadiers, and 1st and 3rd Grenadier JÃ¤gers.\n\nââ 2nd âââ âââââ Kiev, Moscow, St.-Petersburg, and Taurica Grenadiers, and 8th and 14th Grenadier JÃ¤gers.\n\nââ 3rd âââ âââââ Astrakhan, Phanagoria, Siberia, and Little Russia Grenadiers, and 26th and 29th Grenadier JÃ¤gers.\n\nTo replace the six JÃ¤ger regiments removed to these divisions, regiments were reassigned as follows: from the 23rd Division to the 6th Division â the 54th JÃ¤gers; from the 28th to the 15th â the 52nd JÃ¤gers; from the 28th, again, to the 10th â the 53rd JÃ¤gers; from the 28th, again, to the 14th â the 55th JÃ¤gers; from the 28th, again, to the 22nd â the 56th JÃ¤gers; and from the 28th, again, to the 11th â the 57th JÃ¤gers. The remaining regiment of the 28th Division, the 4th Marines, transferred to the 23rd Division in place of the reassigned 54th JÃ¤gers, and then the number of the disbanded 28th Infantry Division was adopted by the former 3rd Infantry Division (61).\n\n29 August 1814 â With the confirmation of a new distribution of corps, divisions, and brigades to the armies, Army infantry regiments were
