        "text": "Battle of Baghdad, Ottoman capture of Baghdad in 1534, which occurred during the first campaign of a twenty-year war between the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire and the Persian (Iranian) Safavid Empire of Shah Ṭahmāsp I. Following victory by the forces of Süleyman the Magnificent, the famous city was to remain in Ottoman hands almost continuously until it was captured by the British in 1917.\n\nWar between the Ottoman and Safavid empires was brought about chiefly by territorial disputes along their Asian frontier, but also by Persian efforts to forge an alliance with the Hapsburg-controlled states, at the head of which sat the powerful Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V of Spain. Such an alliance would open up a double front against the powerful Ottoman Empire.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA History of War\n\nThese tensions ignited into war when Ṭahmāsp had the governor of Baghdad—a supporter of the Ottoman cause—killed. The murder caused Süleyman to turn his attention away from his campaigns in central Europe to focus on the Safavid threat. The Ottomans invaded Safavid territory in 1531 and captured the Kurdish town of Bitlis in 1532 after a three-month siege. The force then advanced on the Safavid capital of Tabriz in eastern Persia, which was taken with ease. Ṭahmāsp continued to fall back, evading capture and avoiding engaging the Ottomans in battle. Baghdad fell in 1534, and Ṭahmāsp again withdrew. Known to history as an enlightened ruler, Süleyman did not visit terror or retribution on the residents of the city, but instead paid for the restoration of both Sunni and Shīʿah shrines and mosques damaged during the siege.\n\nFrom this point onward, he began harrying the Ottomans, launching guerrilla attacks and adopting a scorched-earth campaign that hampered Süleyman’s ability to supply his army. Frustrated by Ṭahmāsp’s tactics, Süleyman garrisoned his gains and withdrew in 1534, ending the first phase of the war with no decisive conclusion. After a further phase of fighting in 1548 to 1549, the war finally ended in 1555, leaving the Ottomans with key gains in Mesopotamia, including Baghdad.\n\nLosses: Unknown."
