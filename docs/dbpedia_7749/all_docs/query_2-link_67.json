He edited two newspapers, founded a university, led the formation of a new denomination, championed a new political movement, and served as prime minister of the Netherlands. He was also a formidable controversialist, a brilliant theologian, and a tireless advocate of public justice. This session will introduce his “public theology,” that is, his vision of social life and its theological foundations, with special emphasis on his understanding of common grace, sphere sovereignty, cultural pluriformity, and their significance for today.   Recommended Readings Abraham Kuyper Collected Works in Public Theology Abraham Kuyper: A Centennial Reader, ed.James Bratt (Eerdmans) Abraham Kuyper, Lectures on Calvinism",
