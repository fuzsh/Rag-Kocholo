In Kuyper’s judgment, the Netherlands and America were both providentially blessed by God and could only be great to the degree that they understood their providential purpose and obeyed God’s ordinances (Bolt 2001: 47-72). Robertson shared this view about America and made it an important part of his presidential campaign (Robertson 1986). Additionally, two important concrete parallels come to mind. Both effectively pioneered use of the media of their day in the service of aggressive Christian sociopolitical activism. Kuyper started, and for forty years edited, a daily newspaper (De Standaard), while also editing a weekly journal (De Heraut [The Herald]). Had he lived and been active one hundred years later, one could easily imagine Kuyper starting a television broadcasting empire such as Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network. And there is more. Convinced that the state universities in the Netherlands had been captured by an Enlightenment worldview that left no room for the knowledge of God in the quest for human scientific knowledge, Kuyper founded the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) of Amsterdam in 1880. Similar concerns led Robertson to start Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 1978. Both universities intentionally set out to be places of Christian scholarly and academic excellence as part of a vision to change the world. It almost seems unnecessary to add here that neither university initially received much respect from the broader academic guild. It would also be fair to say that both institutions have disappointed their critics with their quality facilities, faculty, and academic contribution. James Bratt draws a similar comparison between Kuyper and another culturally despised preacher/political actor, Jerry Falwell: Both undertook the same twofold mission: to awaken a culturally disinherited and despised constituency from its pietistic slumbers and to turn its power against liberal, secularistic, or humanistic hegemony in church and state. Both promised that the venture would return their nations to godly foundations and vanished glory. … Both began with local congregational renewal and ended up trying to transform the nation; and both built the same steps in between – Christian lower education, grass-roots political networking, a Christian University."
