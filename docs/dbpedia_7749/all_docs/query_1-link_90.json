The Expectation Our fathers loved to hark back to their own personal creation. They came to this naturally by their going back to their fall in Adam; something of which the superficial Christendom that now prevails simply knows nothing. What, they ask us, did Adam’s fall to me? “In sooth, I have enough to do with my own sins, than that I should trouble myself about the sin of a man who...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm.

The Mother With a beauty that never pales, the prince of poets celebrated in song the tie that binds the mother to her child, which she bore in sorrow, fed with milk at her breast, and had carried for so long under her heart, as that which “unites the blood.” The estimate was correct. The love of mother for the child she bore does not spring from a tendency of soul, but from the...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Grand Rapids, Michigan. 1929. Used by permission of Eerdmans Publishing Co. The Blessing of Children Childlessness is a disappointment to the married woman, which grieves and in some measure even brings shame. Later on, this troubled feeling grows less, when more and more it becomes clear that such is the will of the Lord; and years go on; and no one considers it any longer unnatural to find her without child; and other occupations are sought and found; and God Himself has reconciled her...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Grand Rapids, Michigan. 1929. Used by permission of Eerdmans Publishing Co. Not Live by Bread Alone To labor, to be busy, to work is our high human calling. For though it is true that God the Lord, after the fall, has said: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread” (Gen. 3:19), yet in this saying the emphasis and stress fall on “the sweat of the face” and upon the “eating bread.” With wonderful accuracy of expression the word labor, orwork, does...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm.

Care for the House Of the good housewife the Proverb-poet writes that she does not eat “the bread of idleness, for she ever looketh well to the ways of her household” (Prov. 31:27). There was a time when, especially in our large cities, some housemothers thought that this looking to the ways of her house referred to her care of the marble hall-ways; and when she knew that the spotless flooring glistened...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm.

Godliness with satisfaction is great gain,” wrote the apostle to Timothy (1, 6:6, Dutch version). Notice carefully the word “satisfaction.” Even as the Dutch word for “taking satisfaction in a thing,” it has the meaning in it of the wordenough. Not only in our language, but also in the original language of Holy Scripture. He who has...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm. B.

High Standard of Life You are mistaken, when you seek the seat of indwelling sin in your body, and when you brand your flesh as the malefactor upon whose head comes down all guilt. He who says this, directly contradicts Jesus’ saying that, not from the flesh, but from theheart, proceed all sorts of evil things, because from the heart are the issues of life. Laying all guilt upon the flesh is an invention of Satan, who...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm. B.

Economy What think ye, when Christ multiplied the loaves and fishes, did He produce too much bread by mistake, so that fragments remained contrary to His intention, and that these fragments surprised Him? This cannot be so. What operated with this multiplication in and through Christ was divine almightiness. To do what here is done falls outside the range of our human nature. What God the Lord has put in our power is to multiply grain...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm. B.

Home Happiness o thy way,” so says the Preacher (Eccl. 9:7), “eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.” And this he says not once, but every time comes back to it again. “For a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat and to drink, and to be merry; for that shall abide with him of his labor...\n\nContinue reading\n\nReprinted from When Thou Sittest In Thine House, by Abraham Kuyper, Wm.

There is still a thirdsomething. Something that lies in between “health” and “sickness,” and that sometimes, already at an early age, follows us after as decline of strength:weakness. “Nerves” it is called with one, “poverty of blood” with a second, with a third “exhaustion.” But, by whatever it is caused, or to whatever cause it is attributed, the result is one. There lacks strength where...\n\nContinue reading"
