        "text": "Ptolemy's World Map from Geographia, c. 150 c.e. (source: wikipedia) Gerrit Cornelis Berkouwer (1903-1996) was a famous Dutch Reformed Theologian who worked within the same illustrious Dutch Calvinist tradition as Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck. In G.C. Berkouwer's Studies in Dogmatics: Holy Scripture, is a famous argument against inerracy that I've quoted in toto […]\n\nGerrit Cornelis Berkouwer (1903-1996)[source: librarything]G.C. Berkouwer was a Dutch Reformed Theologian in the Amsterdam tradition along with theological greats including Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck and H. Berkof. Berkouwer wrote an excellent introduction to Karl Barth's theology titled, The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth: An Introduciton and Critical […]\n\nHerman Bavinck (source: rpcnacovenanter) Herman Bavinck was a Dutch Calvinist who wrote an influential Reformed Dogmatics, and this is part two in my analysis of Bavinck's Doctrine of Inspiration of the Scriptures. As I previously shared, the Dutch Calvinists were not encumbered in fundamentalist debates over inerrancy like their American Calvinist […]\n\nHerman Bavinck (source: wikipedia) The Dutch Calvinists, such as Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, and G.C. Berkouwer, were not paralyzed by the mechanical theories of the Inspiration of Scriptures as their American Calvinist counterparts at old Princeton did with Inerrancy, including Charles Hodge, B.B. Warfield and A.A. Hodge. In the following brilliant selection from […]\n\nIn Judeo-Christian history of thought, there's always been core belief that God is creator, and that the world has not always existed but was creation by God in the beginning.

These two books contain a 2-3 page assessment of each principle women in the bible, describe the good, the bad and […]\n\nAbraham Kuyper is among my favorites of the Dutch Calvinists. Here's a selection from his Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology on Melchizedek. 63. Falsifications of the Conception of Theology The falsifications of Theology as science bear an entirely different character. By these we do not refer to the heretical divergencies, such as Protestants assert […]\n\nAbraham Kuyper Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920) was a Dutch Reformed Theologian and Political, and in his massive three-volume Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology, I've quoted Kuyper's assessment of Hegel and Schleiermacher in regards to Natural Revelation. Beginning with the introduction in John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, the Reformed Church has defined its epistemology […]\n\nAbraham Kuyper in his Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology considers the widely discussed question \"Is theology a science?\" and \"In What sense is theology a science?\" Kuyper emphasizes through this book the necessity of palingenesia (i.e. regeneration) to have a right understanding of Christianity. In the following long quotation, Kuyper explains that a general comparison […]"
