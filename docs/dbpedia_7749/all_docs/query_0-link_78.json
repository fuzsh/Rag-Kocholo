        "text": "Professor George Harinck’s eight-part documentary on Abraham Kuyper’s journey into the Mediterranean Islamic world is now available with English subtitles. In this intriguing series, produced by Martin Maat and Hans Hermans, Professor Harinck follows Kuyper’s footsteps through 16 countries around the Mediterranean Sea, examining the roots of present-day religious and socio-political conflict in light of Kuyper’s observations a century ago.\n\nThe Bavinck Institute is pleased to release The Bavinck Review 6 (2015) (1.8 MB PDF).\n\nThe editorial includes an update on the Reformed Ethics translation project, an excerpt of which is included in pearls and leaven.\n\nEditorial\n\nArticles\n\nKnowledge according to Bavinck and Aquinas by Arvin Vos\n\nA Christian Mondrian by Joseph Masheck\n\nIn Translation\n\nThe Natural Knowledge of God, by Abraham Kuyper, translated and annotated by Harry Van Dyke\n\nConscience by Herman Bavinck, translated by Nelson D. Kloosterman\n\nPearls and Leaven\n\nBavinck on Religion by John Bolt\n\nBavinck Bibliography 2014\n\nhttps://archive.org/download/2008-bavinck-conference/bavinck-b5-2008-09-19.mp3\n\nRev. Dr. Richard B. Gaffin, Emeritus Professor of Biblical and Systematic Theology, Westminster Theological Seminary, delivered the following lecture (MP3) at the 2008 Bavinck Conference: “God’s Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on Scripture.”\n\nIn the lecture Gaffin summarizes his published analysis of Rogers and McKim’s proposals regarding Holy Scripture’s nature using a comparison of the thought of Kuyper and Bavinck. He also briefly remarks on the relevance of these 20th-century Dutch neo-Calvinists for Evangelical theology today.\n\nRev. Dr. Ron Gleason responds beginning at 49:00.\n\nKampen Theological University, the Archive and Documentation Centre, and the Historical Documentation Centre at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam invite you to a two-day conference on neo-Calvinism (Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, Groen van Prinsterer, et al.) and the French Revolution at the library of The American Church in Paris on 23–24 August 2012.\n\nSpeakers\n\nProf. George Harinck (VU Amsterdam, TU Kampen)\n\nProf. James Bratt (Calvin College)\n\nDr. Mark Elliott (St Andrews)\n\nDr. James Eglinton (TU Kampen)\n\nRobert Covolo (Fuller)\n\nTheme\n\nThe French Revolution was the scene of much intellectual and social upheaval. Its impact touched a wide range of subjects: the relationship of the church to the state, social relationships, science, literature, fashion, philosophy and theology. Although the French Revolution’s momentum was felt across Europe and North America, it met a particularly interesting response in the Netherlands, at that time the scene of a burgeoning neo-Calvinist movement. In that context, the likes of Groen van Prinsterer, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck responded to the French Revolution’s ideals and influence in a variety of intellectual and practical ways.\n\nThis conference will focus on the historical and theological aspects of this neo-Calvinist response to the French Revolution.\n\nDownload PDF for further details\n\nThe Bavinck Review 2 (2011) is now available for Bavinck Society members. This year’s issue contains six student papers and two research précis delivered at the 2010 Edinburgh Bavinck Conference as well as a translation of Herman Bavinck’s intriguing lecture, “The Kingdom of God, The Highest Good.”\n\nPreview TBR 2:\n\nContents\n\nEditorial by John Bolt\n\nTBR issues are made freely available to non-Society-members six months after publication. See our inaugural issue: TBR 1 (2010).\n\n(The preview PDFs require the free Adobe Acrobat Reader.)"
