        "text": "“For it is time for judgement to begin at the household of God.” 1 Peter 4:17a\n\nDr. Francis Schaeffer gave us an insightful critique of modern culture over fifty years ago in his blockbuster book, How Should We Then Live? Who would have thought that his analysis from the past would be as true today as it was in 1976 when his book was first published? The relentless pursuit of peace, prosperity, and personal gain in America appears to have reached its apex in our current society! But the question posed by Schaeffer remains–How Should We Then Live? In particular, how should we live as disciples of Jesus Christ in this self-centered age? Consider Schaeffer’s challenging words,\n\n“As the more Christian-dominated consensus weakened, the majority of people adopted two impoverished values: personal peace and affluence. Personal peace means just to be left alone, not to be troubled with the troubles of other people, whether across the world or across the city–to live one’s life with minimal possibilities of being personally disturbed. Personal peace means wanting to have my personal life pattern undisturbed in my lifetime, regardless of what the result will be in the lifetimes of my children and grandchildren. Affluence means an overwhelming and ever-increasing prosperity–a life made up of things, things, and more things–a success judged by an ever-higher level of material abundance.”\n\nFrancis Schaeffer, How Should We Now Live? 205\n\nIt is my belief that Christians everywhere should respond to this indictment of modern culture. We cannot ignore it. Perhaps as a first response, personal repentance should be manifested throughout the life of individual Christians. Rather than living only for the acquisition of personal possessions, property, and prestige, Christians should live as those who “seek first his kingdom.” (Matt. 6:33) Possessions, property, and prestige are secondary. The Apostle Peter instructs Christians that “judgement [begins] at the household of God.” (1 Pet. 4:17) These sobering words should move us to sincere repentance from the pursuit of selfish gain. Only by cleansing ourselves from our own quest after personal peace and affluence can future generations be preserved from the same malady.\n\nBeyond that, individual churches should give a hard look at their philosophy of ministry–is it all about the growth and prosperity of the church, or is it all about the growth of Christ’s kingdom here on earth? As a church, our priorities should be in alignment with the kingdom ethics of our Lord. (cf. Matt. 5:13-16; Matt. 28:18-19; Mk. 8:34; 2 Cor. 10:3-6; 1 Tim. 5:1-25)\n\nMoreover, we should find a strategy for living in this fallen world that is consistent with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. What should that strategy be? Here are some historic approaches: (1) We should remove ourselves into cloistered enclaves where all worldly influences are kept at a safe distance [Monasticism]. (2) We should become political revolutionaries who forcefully impose our beliefs and morals upon this fallen world [Secular Marxism]. Or, (3) We should acquiesce to secular pressures and not impose our beliefs and values upon unbelievers, but live at peace with all [Cultural Relativism]. Let me just say that I do not think retreat, revolution, or acquiescence are the proper Biblical responses.\n\nInstead, I believe that modern culture should be thoroughly engaged by those who have a God-given remedy to the self-centeredness and prideful arrogance of this fallen world. The Lord gives us a better way! This remedy is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The ethics of God’s kingdom, therefore, should become the new standard for life in the 2020’s throughout the world. In short, God’s ways are better than man’s ways, and Christians must lead the way in bringing order to a disordered world. This is not accomplished by retreat, revolution, or acquiescence. It is accomplished by engaging the people and structures of this fallen world with the gospel of Jesus Christ. (cf. Jer. 29:4-7; Lk. 19:11-27; 1 Jn. 2:15-17)\n\nThis approach of cultural engagement is traditionally called a “Reformed World and Life View.” In short, all aspects of human culture that are found in this fallen world are to be thoroughly engaged—not retreated from [in monasticism], not overthrown [in Marxism], nor acquiesced to [in relativism], but contended with [in a Reformed world and life view]. The theological world-view of Reformed Christianity seeks to boldly penetrate all spheres of human culture with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Historically, this view has been popularized by two dutchmen, Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) and Herman Bavinck (1854-1921), and in this current era by Henry Van Til (1906-1961), Francis Schaeffer (1912-1984), Chuck Colson (1931-2012), and David F. Wells (b. 1938). Other theologians–too numerous to be named–have taken-up this important theme as well. I will name some of the most helpful spokesmen in upcoming blog posts.\n\nAnd so, how do we respond to Dr. Francis Schaeffer’s critique of modern culture? We respond in repentance (both personal and corporate) and by committing ourselves and our churches to thoroughly engaging the people and structures of this world with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n— Dr. Marcus J. Serven\n\nChristians have regularly struggled with how they should live in this fallen world. Should they retreat into their own enclaves and disengage from the world with all of its problems and attendant difficulties? “No,” asserts Dr. Abraham Kuyper! He gives us this bold answer to the question by reminding Christians everywhere that God owns the earth and all that is in it. Simply stated, the Lord has never given title to anyone else, nor did He leave it solely under the authority of the Evil One. The Lord owns it all–every “square inch.” In addition, the Lord is steadily advancing the kingdom of His Son here on earth. Consider these two Psalms,\n\n“The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, for he founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.”\n\nPsalm 24:1-2\n\n“The LORD says to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool…The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of His wrath. He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter chiefs over the wide earth. He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head.”\n\nPsalm 110:1, 4-7\n\nTherefore, we as the people of God, must live under His authority and seek to advance His Son’s kingdom throughout our lives. It is not a futile task! The Lord promises us the Kingdom of Christ is a domain “that cannot be shaken.” (Heb. 12:28) It is steadily advancing throughout history, even though at times it may be hidden from our sight. (Matt. 13:31-33) Nonetheless, this fact should give us hope in times of growing darkness. Moreover, it gives us a confident expectation that righteousness shall prevail and that the Lord will bring all things under His dominion. Soli Deo Gloria! To God alone be the glory!\n\n— Dr. Marcus J. Serven\n\n“Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe.” Hebrews 12:28\n\nWritten by Dr. Marcus J. Serven\n\nDuring this time of trouble and turmoil that is taking place within our country, it is good for Christians everywhere to recall that God actually owns the world. It is His creation and He sovereignly superintends all of the events of the world. This fact never changes throughout earth history, and even though the evil one has some temporary influence over the events of men the sovereign plan of God always prevails (Prov. 16:4; Rom. 8:28; 1 John 3:8). For example, King David tells us in the Psalms…\n\n“The earth is the LORD’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, for he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.”\n\nPsalm 24:1-2\n\nAlso, two additional Psalms written by others reiterate this same foundational truth,\n\n“The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.”\n\n“He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved.”\n\nPsalm 89:11 and Psalm 104:5\n\nWith this fact in mind, then, how then should Christians relate to the ever-changing powers in the civil sphere and to the diverse ideologies in this fallen world? Do we quietly go along with every government inspired program, no matter how ridiculous or evil it is, or do we look to the Bible to see how God would have us live?\n\nAbraham Kuyper (1837-1920), a Dutch Reformed pastor, author, politician, newspaper editor, professor, and theologian, thoughtfully addressed these basic questions. Kuyper believed that every sphere of life belongs to King Jesus and that no part of life should ever be separated from the lordship of Jesus Christ. Moreover, he believed that the Bible was sufficient to instruct us in how we are to act, speak, and think. He wrote,\n\n“Oh, no single piece of our mental world is to be hermetically sealed off from the rest, and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry: ‘Mine!’ ”\n\nAbraham Kuyper, Sphere Sovereignty\n\nAlso Kuyper forcefully argues,\n\nWhatever man may stand, whatever he may do, to whatever he may apply his hand—in agriculture, in commerce, and in industry, or his mind, in the world of art, and science—he is, in whatsoever it may be, constantly standing before the face of God. He is employed in the service of his God. He has strictly to obey his God. And above all, he has to aim at the glory of his God.\n\nAbraham Kuyper, Lectures on Calvinism\n\nIn this respect, Kuyper asserted the sphere sovereignty of Jesus Christ over all human endeavors and institutions. Kuyper referred to this as a “Reformed World and Life View.” He carefully explained,\n\n“God built into the creation a variety of cultural spheres, such as the family, economics, politics, art, and intellectual inquiry. Each of these spheres has its own proper ‘business’ and needs its own unique pattern of authority. When we confuse spheres, by violating the proper boundaries of church and state, for instance, or reducing the academic life to a business enterprise, we transgress the patterns that God has set.”\n\nAbraham Kuyper, Sphere Sovereignty\n\nChristians should not be afraid to engage fallen culture with the gospel and biblical truth. There simply is no neutral ground, and all human beings—whether they acknowledge God or not—must live by the laws that God has given, and also they must ultimately give an account to God on the Judgment Day based on his laws (Matt. 25:31-33; Rom. 14:10-12; 2 Cor. 5:10).\n\nLet me return now to my basic question, “Who owns the world?” If it is man, or the evil one, who actually owns the world, then this leaves all of mankind in a place of ambiguity and uncertainty as to just how we should live in this fallen world. Everything is always changing; nothing is fixed or permanent. In addition, this premise gives the false impression that there is some standard of right and wrong other than God’s Law; some have glibly called this a “natural law.”\n\nHowever, the Bible clearly asserts that God alone is the one who owns the world. He has never given its title over to anyone else—not to any individual human being, not to any humanistic ideology or philosophy, nor to the evil one. The world belongs to God. Moreover, the Bible declares that God alone is the law-giver. Therefore, mankind has a fixed and unchanging set of laws to live by—God’s laws—and Christians have a divine commission to take dominion in every sphere of life for our sovereign King, the Lord Jesus Christ (Gen. 1:28; Ps. 103:17-19; Matt. 28:19-20).\n\nSelect Bibliography:\n\nIf you want to learn more about Abraham Kuyper, then I would suggest the following four books—they are short and full of many stirring quotes.\n\nBratt, James D., ed.
