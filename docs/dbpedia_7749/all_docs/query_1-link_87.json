        "text": "Written by Abraham Kuyper, Translated and Edited by Harry Boonstra\n\nFew modern figures in the Reformed tradition are as widely influential as Abraham Kuyper, whose views on theology, politics, and Christian culture are renowned. His writings on worship, however, are not as well known.\n\nThis new English translation of the Dutch language classic 'Onze Eeredienst' fills that gap, offering Kuyper’s clearest thinking on worship and liturgy. Though written in 1911, his perspectives on worship are amazingly relevant to our time.\n\nIn a substantive introduction Harry Boonstra outlines Kuyper's life and the historical context in which he wrote. Adding even more luster to the volume are concluding essays by John Bolt, Bryan Spinks, Geoffrey Wainwright, and Nicholas Wolterstorff.\n\nPaperback, 412 pages, Chronological bibliography of theologians, index."
