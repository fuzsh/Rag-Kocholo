        "text": "The Reformed Church in America (RCA) and the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRC) are close but different. The RCA offers more room for diversity on the issues of human sexuality, and churches can even celebrate same-sex marriages. Some CRC folks have asked whether they might fit better in the RCA, but they realise…\n\nIn mid-November, James Dekker interviewed Ryan Struyk, Grand Rapids native and life-long member of the Christian Reformed Church. Calvin University named Struyk its 2021 Young Alumni Award winner. Struyk is Senior Producer for CNN’s Sunday “State of the Union.” Ryan and the show’s team won a 2023 Emmy Award for their coverage of the first…\n\nI must confess, there is much that I enjoy about Synod.

The film features prominent designers from Google, Facebook and Twitter, including the engineer who created the pervasive “like” button and the inventor of the “infinite scroll.” The…\n\nThe contemporary Christian musician Andrew Peterson provocatively laments “the second coming of the Pharisees” when he witnesses Christians behaving contrary to their teacher (Come, Lord Jesus, 2000). I heard this song playing repeatedly in my mind as I read Katherine Stewart’s recent book, The Power Worshippers, on the rise and danger of Christian nationalism."
