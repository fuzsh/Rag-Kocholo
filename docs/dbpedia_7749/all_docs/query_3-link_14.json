        "text": "Who was Abraham Kuyper? We know his books, we know his vast opinions, but do we know his actions? Do we know how he thought of himself? Do we know how others thought of him? How is he remembered today? Indeed, there is a folk “history” of Kuyper alive and not-so-well here in the USA, but is what we have been told, and assumed all along (and probably echoed ourselves), actually true to the historical record? Was Kuyper really a jerk whereas his younger co-laborer Bavinck the humble and kind man – or, was actually, contrary to popular belief, the nice guy and it was Herman Bavinck that was the disagreeable one? Was Kuyper truly genuinely disdained or did even his critics respect him? Did he really stop attending church at the end of his life? Did he fancy himself a Theologian? Did he fail a second term as Prime Minister of the Netherlands because he was despised or was there another reason? Was Kuyper a schismatic for starting a non-state Reformed Church in the Netherlands or did he have no other choice? We also might ask: is James Bratt’s, author of the definitive English language biography of Kuyper, accurate or does he have an ax to grind? All these questions, and more, we discuss with the formidable and ad fontes proponent Johan Snel, author of “De Zeven Levens van Abraham Kuyper” (“The Seven Lives of Abraham Kuyper”). Join us as Snel, who poured over Kuyper’s personal letters and correspondence, gives us the only English version of his Dutch language book “De Zeven Levens van Abraham Kuyper.” Listen in as we discuss Kuyper in the 7 areas that he, at the age of 75, associated with himself. Namely, Kuyper’s own self-identifying as an Alpinist, Globetrotter, Celebrated Speaker, Scholar, Activist, Journalist and Statesman. Join us as we separate fact from fiction in regards to “Abraham The Great” – the founder of neo-Calvinism and a faithful brother in Christ. Pro Rege."
