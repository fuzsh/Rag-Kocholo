Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920)

Dutch Protestant; b. at Maassluis (10 m. w. of Rotterdam) Oct. 29, 1837. He studied in Leyden, and was pastor at Beesd (1863-68), Utrecht (1868-70), and Amsterdam (1870-74). In 1874 he became a figure in the political life of Holland, being a member of the States-General for Gouda from that year until 1877. In 1894 he was again returned to the same body for Sliedrecht, and in 1901 became prime minister. In 1880 he founded at Amsterdam the Free University, where he has since been professor, lecturing on various topics as occasion requires. In theology he is a strict orthodox Calvinist, and as such founded the Reformed Free Church in 1886. He has lectured extensively in the United States, and in 1898 was L. P. Stone lecturer at Princeton Theological Seminary. Besides editing the Standaard (a daily newspaper) since 1872 and the Herout (weekly) since 1878, he has written many works, including: Eenvormigheid, de vloek van het moderne leven (Amsterdam, 1869); Het modernisme, een Fata Morgana op christelijk gebied (1871); Tractaat van de refomatie der kerken (1883); Het werk van den Heiligen Geest (3 parts, 1888-89; Eng. transl., New York, 1900); E voto dordraceno Toelichting op den Heidelbergschen Catechismus (4 parts, 1892-95); and Calvinism (Stone lectures, 1899). He also edited Johannes a Lasco’s complete works (2 vols., Amsterdam, 1866); Kerkeraadsprotocollen der hollandsche gemeente te London, 1569-1571 (Utrecht, 1870); and F. du Jon’s Opuscula theologica selecta (Amsterdam, 1882). Portions of his Encyclopaedie der heilige Godgeleerdheid (3 vols., Amsterdam, 1894) have been translated into English under the title, Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology: Its Principles (London and New York, 1898).
