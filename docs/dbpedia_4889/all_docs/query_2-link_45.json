        "text": "Wang and Sullivan also reach agreement for heads of military theatres to hold video calls.\n\nRising tensions are forcing Manila to weigh invoking the treaty, but analysts warn it’s ‘not like a light switch that you turn on and off’.\n\nDomestic issues tend to top Philippine voters’ concerns, but recent events could make Ferdinand Marcos’ foreign policy a decisive factor.\n\nChina’s top diplomat Wang Yi heads into intense talks saying ‘lessons need to be learned’ from the twists and turns of the US-China relationship.\n\nManila has accused Beijing of deliberate intimidation and harassment, stoking fears of a broader crisis erupting in the South China Sea.\n\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are set for three days of meetings in Beijing starting Tuesday.\n\nThird face-off in a week sees Philippine vessels accused of ‘dangerously’ approaching Chinese coastguard ships on normal patrol at shoal.\n\nTop diplomat Wang Yi expected to raise ‘serious concerns’ about Taiwan during White House adviser’s Beijing visit.\n\nHanoi’s deft diplomatic balancing act sees it leverage the regional bloc to resist geopolitical pressures arising from US-China competition.\n\nManila’s transparency strategy to expose Beijing’s transgressions has paid off, to an extent. But it won’t change China’s behaviour.\n\nHanoi’s new leadership is doubling down on ‘bamboo diplomacy’ to navigate choppy geopolitical currents and protect economic gains.\n\nBut analysts have questioned the huge budget allocation given that the prototype submarine is still undergoing testing."
