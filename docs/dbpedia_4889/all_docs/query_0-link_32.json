        "text": "The 24-year-old, who grew up in a poor Manila area, rode a float with other Filipino Olympians after tripling the country’s gold medal haul to three.\n\nThirty-four cyclists competed in the first edition of Dirty Kanza in 2006 – this year 5,000 riders started the race, now renamed Unbound Gravel, with many more left out.\n\nVivian Siu went through a ‘dark time’ after her mother died of cancer. But the Hong Kong native got her life back on track, became a racing-car driver and in 2023 made history at the 2023 Macau Grand Prix."
