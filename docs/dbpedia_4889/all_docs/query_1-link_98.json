        "text": "“Modern sports” were introduced to Asia in the late nineteenth century as an innovation from the West, concurrently with the development of modern society in Asia. This book traces the historical developments of sporting cultures in Asia in specific local contexts – including Singapore, China, Myanmar, Taiwan, the Philippines, and India – and their intersections with larger social developments of colonialism, postcolonialism, nationalism, and the building of modern Asia and its place in a globalized world. The case studies herein present the social history of modern team sports with standardized rules such as basketball and cricket, and less familiar sports such as fives and chinlone, as they vacillate between global and local perspectives. This book also shows that modern sports have had an important influence on the makeup of everyday life in Asia, and the essays here also consider sports’ impact on gender, body culture, and celebrity culture, among other concerns. This book painstakingly bridges the gaps between Asian Studies and Sports Studies in a way that reflects the historicity and multiplicity of sports in Asian societies. By adopting multi-disciplinary approaches, this book innovatively offers significant intersection between sociology, cultural studies and Asian studies of sport in Asia\n\nThis paper presents a comparative analysis of residents from Brazilian cities and Hong Kong to an incentive of travelling as sport event tourists. The findings from Hong Kong (n=134) and São Paulo (n=151) reveal their different travel incentives, ability and characteristics in terms of annual and infrequent sport events. When determining interest in a sport event, excitement and safety are of paramount concern to respondents from both territories. As sport event tourism does not automatically flourish and remain sustained after the presence of a mega-event, city governments are recommended to react to the preferences of specific market."
