Delivering the opening address to the three-day Conference (28-30 August), Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges said: “It is most fitting that the 40th edition of the ARC returns to its birthplace, Japan, and to celebrate the 70th birthday of the JRA (Japan Racing Association).\" “Our industry is at a critical juncture and I firmly believe it is necessary that we critically review our current situation and how we reposition ourselves to secure our future. In this context, as leaders in our industry, we need to prepare for these challenges, but more importantly we have to advocate change, explore new ways of collaboration, and embrace new technology like AI (artificial intelligence) to help us to be more relevant to our customers.\" “The way racing has been able to manage COVID has demonstrated how resilient and agile we can be, which makes me feel confident we can master these challenges.” Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges said these challenges could be met with a focus on goodwill and mutual understanding, promotion of horse racing and breeding and the integrity of our sport, encouraging and developing mutually beneficial objectives and strategies, exchanges of ideas and information and to encourage, promote, and support international competition of horses and jockeys. “We have to focus on our current and future customers and the big vision; and not lose our focus due to our fragmentation and tendency to look backward and not forward,” Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges said. The Sapporo conference theme – Be Connected, Stride Together – features a dynamic and highly interactive three-day programme of guest speakers who will examine key post-pandemic trends in racing, breeding and wagering, equine and human welfare, international competition and integrity issues as well as several other key matters. 🔗 Read more: https://lnkd.in/g_FNWeNd #HKJC #ARC #JRA #HorseRacing\n\n🌟 Welcoming the Future Leaders of HKJC! 🌟 At HKJC, we’re dedicated to nurturing the next generation of leaders who will shape our future.
