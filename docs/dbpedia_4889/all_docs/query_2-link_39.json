        "text": "DEEP BLUE SCARS\n\nEnvironmental Threats\n\nto the South China Sea\n\nBy Monica Sato, Harrison PrÃ©tat, Tabitha Mallory, Hao Chen, and Gregory Poling | December 18th, 2023\n\nA hidden crisis is unfolding across the South China Sea. While regional powers work to strengthen their claims to disputed waters and territories there, the marine environment in which they maneuver has been declining to critical levels.\n\nHuman activity is causing severe ecological damage in the South China Sea.\n\nIn recent decades, increased fishing, dredging, and land fill, along with giant clam harvesting, have taken a devastating toll on thousands of species found nowhere else on earth.\n\nTo ensure the security and longevity of the plants, animals, and people that call the South China Sea home, this critical environment must be understood through an ecological, rather than merely geopolitical, lens.\n\nI. Understanding Life in the South China Sea\n\nThe South China Sea has one of the highest levels of marine biodiversity in the world.\n\nIt boasts over 6,500 marine species, each of which has a role to play in the success of this enormous, interconnected ecosystem.\n\nCoral\n\nCoral reefs support nearly 25 percent of global marine life. Of the worldâs 1,683 reef-forming coral species, 571 are found in the South China Sea.\n\nCoral reefs are considered one of the most vital ecosystems in the South China Sea, providing food and shelter to thousands of species in their surrounding environment.\n\nThey are also one of the most threatened ecosystems in the region, with coral cover declining 16 percent per decade.\n\nFish\n\nAbout 22 percent of the worldâs fish species are found in the South China Sea, with coral reefs supporting a total of 3,790 species of fish. Pelagic fish such as tuna, also traverse the area. The exceptional variety of fish in the South China Sea make it a central hub for commercial fishing in the broader Indo-Pacific region. It ranks as one of the worldâs top five fishing areas.\n\nBivalves\n\nThe South China Sea is also home to eight of the ten global species of giant clam. This includes the Tridacna gigas, the worldâs largest shellfish. Giant clams are vital to the health of reef ecosystems. They serve as food and shelter for other animals, and act reef builders and shapers. They also counter eutrophication through water-filtering.\n\nSharks & Mammals\n\nThe South China Sea boasts a wide variety of larger species like sharks, rays, and marine mammals like dolphins and whales.\n\nOther Species\n\nIt is also home to a myriad of other organisms that live in the water and along the ocean floor. Even species that have no commercial value play crucial ecological roles in maintaining the marine habitat that allows all species to thrive.\n\nHumans\n\nThe South China Sea is a vital source of food and livelihoods for the countries surrounding it, which are home to around 1.87 billion people.\n\nWhile some communities practice more sustainable fishing methods, the rise of large-scale industrial fishing has endangered large areas of the food web.\n\nGeopolitical competition and poor resource management have put this vibrant ecosystem under threat, starting with its very foundation: the coral reefs themselves.\n\nII. Reef Destruction in the South China Sea\n\nPart 1: Dredging & Land Fill\n\nTo build outposts that support their competing claims in the South China Sea, claimants have engaged in dredging and land fill across the region. This has destroyed vast areas of the South China Seaâs coral reef ecosystems over the last 10 years.\n\nDredging: The removing of silt, sediments, and other materials from the seabed, often done in the South China Sea for the purpose of creating channels, harbors, or to gather material for landfill.\n\nLand Fill: The creation of new artificial land with dredged seabed material.\n\nDredging can entirely remove essential reef substructures, causing irreparable and long-term changes to the overall structure and health of the reef.\n\nFrom late 2013 to 2017, China used dredging to build out its artificial islands. Its cutter suction dredgers would slice into the reef and pump sediment through floating pipelines to shallow areas to deposit it as landfill. This process disturbed the seafloor, creating clouds of abrasive sediment that killed nearby marine life and overwhelmed the coral reefâs capacity to repair itself.\n\nDredging always damages the surrounding environment, but other claimants have a history of using less destructive dredging methods. Until recently, Vietnam had primarily used clamshell dredgers and construction equipment to scoop up sections of shallow reef and deposit the sediment on the area targeted for landfill.\n\nThis method is slower and causes less collateral damage to surrounding areas. However, it still destroys the coral reef where the sediment is extracted and deposited.\n\nMore recently, however, Vietnam has turned to cutter suction dredgers like Chinaâs. This large-scale expansion of Vietnamâs South China Sea outposts remains ongoing and will have major consequences for the surrounding marine environment.\n\nCommercial satellite imagery analysis undertaken by the CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) has revealed the approximate total area of coral reefs destroyed by China, Vietnam, and other claimants in the region.\n\nThe results show that China has caused the most reef destruction through dredging and land fill, burying roughly 4,648 acres of reefs.\n\nFrom late 2013 to 2017, China used dredging to build out its artificial islands.

Reef Destruction in the South China Sea\n\nPart 2: Giant Clam Harvesting\n\nScholars studying the environmental effects of dredging and land fill on coral reefs also discovered another destructive phenomenon: vast areas of coral reef damaged by giant clam harvesting.\n\nThe harvesting of giant clams for their remarkable shells has become popular in recent decades because of their resemblance to elephant ivory, which is now extremely difficult or illegal to obtain. The shells are typically worked into jewelry and statues and sold for high prices in Chinaâas much as $106,000 per carved shell.\n\nGiant clam harvesting was especially prevalent between 2012 and 2015 among fishers from the port of Tanmen on Chinaâs Hainan Island. The surge coincided with government efforts to promote maritime activity in the South China Sea. President Xi Jinping visited Tanmen in 2013 and pledged support for fishers while urging them to âcatch more big fish.â\n\nAlthough local Hainan authorities attempted to crack down on the sale of giant clams in 2017, satellite imagery from 2019 shows that harvesting in the South China Sea persisted, even under the eye of the China Coast Guard. Giant clam products continue to be sold in China on the black market.\n\nThis increase in harvesting has led several species of giant clams to be classified as vulnerable. However, the method by which Chinese fishers have harvested these creatures is even more damaging, laying waste to large swathes of coral reef.\n\nIn satellite imagery of the South China Sea, many reefs show arc-shaped scars, which are created when fishers dig up reef surfaces by dragging specially made brass propellers in a semicircle around the anchor chain on the front of their boats.\n\nThis allows them to more easily harvest both live and dead clams attached to the reef.\n\nAlthough fishers from the Philippines and Vietnam have a history of giant clam harvesting, only Chinese fishers are known to use this method.\n\nAMTI analyzed commercial satellite imagery on a total of 181 occupied and unoccupied features of the South China Sea.\n\nAMTI estimates that approximately 16,535 acres of reef have been damaged by Chinese giant clam harvesting.\n\nAlthough local Hainan authorities attempted to crack down on the sale of giant clams in 2017, satellite imagery from 2019 shows that harvesting in the South China Sea persisted, even under the eye of the China Coast Guard.

A high-pressure water pump is used to quickly suck sediment from the seabed. This extracts giant clams while also destroying the seabed and sending abrasive sediment drifting through nearby areas.\n\nThis method of clam harvesting has likely been employed beyond Scarborough Shoal. The Armed Forces of the Philippines Western Command (WESCOM) released a report in September 2023 showing severe environmental damage at Iroquois Reef and Sabina Shoal, which it says was caused by Chinese maritime militia.\n\nSatellite imagery of these features shows no scarring on shallow reef surfaces, so damage photographed by the Armed Forces of the Philippines likely occurred in the deeper lagoons. Currently, the only previously observed cause of such damage in the South China Sea is the water pump method of giant clam harvesting used at Scarborough in 2019.\n\nThe lagoons at Sabina Shoal, Iroquois Reef, and Scarborough Shoal account for about 41,354 acres of reef. The full extent of damage in these lagoons remains to be assessed by marine experts. If the damage was found to be extensive, it could bring the total reef area damaged by Chinese giant clam harvesting to 57,889 acres, or over 90 square miles.\n\nOver 20 percent of maritime features in the South China Sea have sustained damage from giant clam harvesting.\n\nSince clam harvesting on deeper reef structures cannot be monitored by satellite, there is no telling how many other lagoons have been damaged in the same way. Only additional on-site investigation can reveal how many of the remaining 2,159,000 acres of unoccupied reef in the South China Sea have been affected.\n\nThe harvesting of giant clams plays a unique role in the destruction of the South China Seaâs coral reefs. But they are far from the only species threatened by overharvesting in the region.\n\nIII. Overfishing in the South China Sea\n\nThe South China Sea plays a critical role both as a food source and as a provider of economic opportunity and stability. Twelve percent of the global fish catch comes from the South China Sea.\n\nFishing provides livelihoods for at least 3.7 million people in the region with 55 percent of global fishing vessels found there.\n\nThe scale of this economic and nutritional dependence has led to fisheries in the South China Sea being overexploited. Efforts to responsibly manage them have been thwarted by geopolitical tensions and competing maritime claims for years.\n\nThe lack of clear maritime jurisdiction in the region makes it difficult to define what constitutes illegal fishing. As a result, a substantial portion of fishing in the South China Sea goes unregulated or unreported.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of reliable data on fishing activity, the Sea Around Us project at the University of British Columbia developed a methodology to estimate fishing intensity.\n\nBy combining insights from national reported fish catch figures with reconstructive research into local fishing practices and archival records, Sea Around Us is able to estimate the scale of unreported fish catch. It also reconstructs more detailed data about the breakdown of fish catches by location, flag state, species, and fishing method.\n\nData from Sea Around Us on fish catch in the South China Sea show that after sharp increases since the 1950s, fish catch has remained relatively stagnant since the mid-1990s. This stagnation, despite continuing increases in fishing effort, indicates that fish stocks are overexploited.\n\nAlong with an overall increase in fishing effort, the way that most fish in the South China Sea are caught has changed over time. Fishing can be divided into four types: artisanal traditional fishing that uses relatively small, low-powered boats , industrial fishing that requires large vessels that make longer trips farther out and catch larger volumes of fish , recreational fishing for sport or pleasure , and subsistence fishing for personal, family, and community consumption or sharing\n\nIndustrial fishing has grown substantially, and with it, bottom trawling, which has been the dominant fishing method in the South China Sea since the 1980s.\n\nBottom trawlers drag large, weighted nets along the seabed, catching everything in their path, including fish, marine mammals, plants, and turtles. The ropes and weights that drag along the ocean floor destroy seabed ecosystems by ripping up coral and sponges and stirring up sediment.\n\nAs with trawling, China and Vietnam account for the largest share of overall fish catch in the South China Sea.\n\nThe lack of clear maritime jurisdiction in the region makes it difficult to define what constitutes illegal fishing.

The Future of the South China Sea\n\nWhile governments work to resolve territorial and maritime disputes, equal attention must be given to the South China Seaâs declining marine environment.\n\nThe damage has been directly caused by human activity that is allowed, supported, and initiated by coastal states. Therefore, coastal states must also be at the center of efforts to stop destructive practices and safeguard marine ecosystems before it is too late.\n\nChina has played the largest role, destroying or severely damaging at least 21,183 acres of coral reefâand likely much moreâthrough island expansion and giant clam harvesting. It also dominates the industrialized overfishing that has devastated South China Sea fish stocks.\n\nBut China is not alone. Vietnam has also played an outsize role in reef destruction and overfishing. And though other claimants have played smaller parts, they all share in the responsibility to maintain one of the worldâs most diverse marine environments.\n\nFor the South China Sea to be saved, these practices must change.\n\nUrgent efforts within and among regional governments, researchers, and environmental organizations are needed to responsibly manage these waters and secure the lives and livelihoods of all who rely on them.\n\nMade possible by the generous support of the U.S. Department of State's Global Engagement Center\n\nTo view a translated PDF of this report, please click one of the following: Indonesian, Japanese, Malaysian, Tagalog, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Vietnamese\n\nAuthors\n\nHarrison PrÃ©tat, Deputy Director and Fellow, CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative\n\nMonica Sato, Research Associate, CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative\n\nTabitha Mallory, China Ocean Institute\n\nHao Chen, China Ocean Institute\n\nGregory B.
