In 2009, Hong Kong successfully organised the V East Asian Games and it was the biggest sporting event ever held in the territory. Other major international sporting events including the Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics, the Hong Kong Open Golf Championship, the Hong Kong Sevens, Hong Kong Marathon, AFC Asian Cup, EAFF East Asian Cup, Hong Kong Badminton Open, Hong Kong Tennis Classic, Premier League Asia Trophy, and Lunar New Year Cup.

Moreover, Hong Kong is equally impressive performance of athletes with disabilities in 2009, having won four world championships and two Asian Champions.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong City Hall is located today where the original location of \"Victoria Recreation Club\" stood in 1849 after having been in operation in Canton since 1832.

The first documented team came from the \"Chinese Football Team\" of 1904, which began as a club called the \"South China Athletic Club\" founded by Mok Hing.[4] It was the first team to join The Hong Kong Football Association league in 1913/1914. At the time, the introduction of Hong Kong First Division League in 1908 was also another milestone. In the 1917 Far Eastern Games and 1919 Far Eastern Games, the club represented the Republic of China and won the football championship.[4] It is the only team in Hong Kong sports history to have accomplished this feat.[4] Around 1920â€“1922, it formally adopted the present name of South China Athletic Association and diversified into other sports.[4]\n\nFinancial Secretary John James Cowperthwaite was one of the first government official to assist Hong Kong going into the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne Australia with a contribution estimate of HK$10,000.[4]\n\nVictoria Park was one of the free range open space for pick-up games. Until the Hong Kong Stadium was built, there was no arena for spectator sports. By the 1960s a number of clubs have surfaced for mostly social reasons. Since then, Hong Kong sports has been described as \"Club Life\". Some clubs have documented their history thoroughly, while others have disappeared along with their past.\n\nHong Kong Cricket Club\n\nCraigengower Cricket Club\n\nKowloon Cricket Club\n\nKowloon Bowling Green Club\n\nIndian Recreation Club\n\nChinese Recreation Club\n\nFilipino Club\n\nSouth China Athletic Association\n\nUnited Services Recreation Club\n\nHong Kong Football Club\n\nClub de Recreio\n\nClub Lusitano\n\nA large sports park is currently being constructed on the site of the old Kai Tak Airport.
