This includes development of PICOT questions, a systematic review of the literature, evaluation of individual studies for freedom from risk of bias, and grading the overall strength of evidence. The Evidence-based Protocol manual also details specifics related to composition of writing group, reporting of evidence and use of the MOSAIC platform. The goal is for the paper to take no longer than 18 months from approval to publication."
