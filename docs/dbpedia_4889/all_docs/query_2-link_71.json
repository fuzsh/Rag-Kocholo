Membership is open to all Stanford GSB students interested in cultural and professional issues that affect African Americans.\n\nEmail\n\nEpicureans @ the GSB\n\nE@T is a club for people who are passionate about cooking and food! E@T members participate in small group theme dinners in which they help cook, host, and of course… eat. We offer formal and informal cooking classes taught by a variety of students and professional chefs. E@T also visits area restaurants with “behind the scenes” tours.\n\nEmail\n\nEurope Club\n\nThe Europe Club is a community gathering all students sharing an interest in European culture and business. Our goal is to provide a space for European students to share their culture and non-European students to discover it through the organization of social and cultural events (e.g., European movie nights, small group dinners, wine and cheese nights, parties). We also want to help GSB students explore European career opportunities.\n\nEmail\n\nFinTech Club\n\nThe FinTech Club is designed for students interested in learning about or pursuing a career in the financial technology industry.

We foster collaboration, serve as a resource, and highlight ways to incorporate environmental responsibility across the Stanford community.\n\nEmail\n\nFirst-Generation Low-Income Club\n\nThe GSB First-Generation Low-Income Club aims to create a community among students who share the invisible first-generation low-income (FLI) identity, helping them find each other and facilitating more meaningful connections through shared experiences. The club also aims to develop allyship programming that has far-reaching impact in business and education access for socioeconomically disadvantaged students and young professionals, bringing together FLI and non-FLI business school students to engage in discussions around class privilege and socioeconomic inequality, in order to create stronger and more effective FLI advocates among the future highly influential business leaders at the school.\n\nEmail\n\nPride\n\nGSB Pride is a social and socially active organization for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning students and allies at Stanford GSB. The goals are to provide a community for LGBTQ+ students and allies; to serve as a resource for our membership and the Stanford GSB community as a whole; and to increase awareness of LGBTQ+ issues in business.\n\nEmail\n\nHispanic Business Student Association\n\nThe Hispanic Business Student Association exists to create an inclusive community for celebrating Hispanic/LatinX heritage, foster connections between GSB students, alumni, and organizations that advance Hispanic/LatinX leaders, and, above all, support members, not only in navigating life at the GSB, but in thriving here and beyond.\n\nMembership is open to all Stanford GSB students interested in cultural and professional issues that affect the Hispanic/LatinX community.\n\nEmail\n\nManagement Consulting Club\n\nThe Management Consulting Club brings students together who have an interest or background in the management consulting industry. We focus on helping current GSB students explore careers in consulting and prepare for the rigorous case interview process.\n\nEmail\n\nWomen in Management\n\nWomen in Management is a strong, authentic community of members who aim to build a supportive network and foster a more equitable and gender-mindful business world. We host a range of events throughout the year, including a retreat, big name speakers, our annual banquet, a career trek, and regular panels covering a range of personal and professional topics."
