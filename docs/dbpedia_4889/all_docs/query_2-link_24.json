The incident has been reported to the police for investigation and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has been notified.\n\nSCAA has sternly condemned the cyberattack and pledged full cooperation with law enforcement in response to the incident. To date, there is no evidence to suggest that any personal data has been compromised. The association has expressed its regret over the security breach and is committed to ensuring that such incidents do not recur. To this end, SCAA is working with professional information security teams and experts to conduct a comprehensive review and fortification of its server systems.\n\nIn light of the potential impact on its members, the association has activated an emergency response plan and is in the process of notifying those who might be affected. Members have been urged to remain vigilant against any misuse or malicious activity that may arise from the data breach. Inquiries related to the incident can be directed to a dedicated email address set up by the association ([email protected]). Updates and further information will be continuously provided through the official website and other communication channels.\n\nThe SCAA has reiterated its sincere apologies to the members affected by the cyber intrusion and is taking determined steps to enhance security protocols.
