        "text": "Hi @DeathBomMB007 ,\n\nPlease notice that there is a bug in the Companion app.\n\nSo it is by mistake listing more assignments related to the BF4 Campaign versus what there really are.\n\nAka, there are only 7 chapters in your single player game area.\n\nAnd try and look up your soldier in the EA native Battlelog (and not in the Companion app), there you will see that there are truly only 6 assignments.\n\nSo important to note, the BF4 Campaign assignments are not linked one-to-one to the match completion of the 7 game chapters. Not at all.\n\nMatter of fact, the 6 single player assignments are only linking to completing 4 of the 7 single player chapters in total.\n\nNamely:\n\nTOMBSTONE ACTUAL: Complete the Baku chapter.\n\nFANG OF THE UNDERWORLD: Complete the Kunlun Mountains chapter.\n\nA TRAPPED WOLF WILL: Complete the Tashgar chapter.\n\nTO VALHALLA: Make the final choice, version1. Suez chapter.\n\nPEACE MAKER: Make the final choice, version 2. Suez chapter.\n\nFINAL DUTY: Make the final choice, version 3. Suez chapter.\n\nAs you can see, then South China Sea and the Singapore chapters do not have any assignment linked to them or their completion. Reason being that the last chapter in the Single Player 'game' named Suez, is having 3 of the 6 assignments linked to it.\n\nWhile the 7 chapters are:\n\nBaku\n\nShanghai\n\nSouth China Sea\n\nSingapore\n\nKunlun Mountains\n\nTashgar\n\nSuez.\n\nSo you have indeed already completed all the single player assignments that exists in the game. :o)\n\n@DeathBomMB007 wrote:\n\n@CyberDymejust wondering why I'm not getting the achievement \"Above and Beyond the Call\" if I've completed all of the assignments. I'm stuck at 96% on the achievement!? Any work around for this?\n\nHi @DeathBomMB007 ,\n\nIs it possible please for you to share some of your screenshots then from your Xbox, as we dont have any insights into your completion of those assignments in the Battlelog?\n\nThink for the \"Above and Beyond the Call\" you need to have completed all the Campaign chapters to gold level, so that you can see your progress on in your points for each chapter on those.\n\nSo they are something like:\n\nBaku: 6,000 points\n\nShanghai: 10,000 points\n\nSouth China Sea: 10,000 points\n\nSingapore: 19,000 points\n\nKunlun Mountains: 11,000 points\n\nTashgar: 14,000 points\n\nSuez: 5,000 points\n\nNext, you also have the specifics on the Campaign assignments, like:\n\n- Let the Valkyrie be destroyed in the Campaign\n\n- Sacrifice Irish to save the Valkyrie in the Campaign\n\n- Sacrifice Hannah to save the Valkyrie in the Campaign\n\nAnd you have the assignment for each of these.\n\nSo share a screenshot for these also.\n\nOkay, that still doesn't mean it gives us the achievement for completing all the assignments after we complete the ones the game is actually supposed to show us. I've completed every assignment except for the two that are bugged (because the game literally doesn't let you complete those, hence why they're bugged) and it still hasn't given me the achievement because it says I need to complete the two bugged assignments in order to get the achievement. It doesn't matter whether or not we \"technically completed them all\", the game won't give you the achievement until you complete ALL OF THEM."
