She needs a new home, we can no longer take care of her. She is trained and lovable. She doesn't bite.\"\n\nAs the shelter continues to search for Mello's owner they have released surveillance video showing someone tying her up to the bench and leaving her behind.\n\nThe organization said this is the fourth dog abandoned outside their shelter in just the past month.\n\nLocal\n\nBreaking news and the stories that matter to your neighborhood.\n\n\"Our story is not very unique. Just talk to anyone at shelters in Atlantic, Cape May, Gloucester, Cumberland, Salem,etc, etc, Counties,\" the organization wrote in a social media post. \"People are dumping these animals like never has been seen before and we think WE as a society need to try to wrap our heads around it and figure out what the heck is going on.\"\n\nThe organization added they are bringing awareness to this situation not to shame the person but to share how impactful and sad it is to see a dog being abandoned."
