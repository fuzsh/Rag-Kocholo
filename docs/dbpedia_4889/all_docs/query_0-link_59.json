        "text": "FC Barcelona and SK Enmove have extended their partnership agreement for three more seasons, until June 2027. Thanks to this new deal, the Korean motor oil brand will continue to be the club’s Official Partner in several territories of the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe alliance between Barça and SK Enmove began in 2018 and in the last few years it has helped to consolidate the ZIC brand’s leading position in South Korea, as well as boosting its growth in other strategic Asian markets. During the next three years the actions derived from the agreement will focus on different countries of Eastern Europe, Central Asia and China.\n\nWithin the framework of this agreement, SK Enmove will continue to work to develop products featuring the image of FC Barcelona in these territories, as well as digital content that will be distributed in different languages, through different platforms and social networks such as Facebook, Weibo and WeChat, among many others.\n\nThe renewal of this agreement is one of the many outcomes of FC Barcelona’s commercial work in the Asia-Pacific region; an area where it continues to be a leading brand, both because of the interest expressed by companies who are keen to forge associations with the club and because of Barça’s huge fan base in the region.\n\nStatement by Juli Guiu, vice-president of the FC Barcelona Marketing Area:\n\n“We sincerely appreciate the faith that SK Enmove has put in our brand to make itself known and expand its market in the Asia-Pacific region, a territory where FC Barcelona knows how to connect with mass audiences and where it is increasingly reaffirming its leadership as one of the most admired and loved European clubs.”\n\nStatement by Sangmin Lee, head of the Green Growth Division of SK Enmove:\n\n“We are honored to renew our partnership agreement with FC Barcelona. This partnership has been instrumental in elevating SK Enmove’s presence and prestige in our target market. We are confident that this renewed collaboration will lead to even greater success for both FC Barcelona and SK Enmove. Together, we look forward to achieving new heights and stronger leadership in our respective fields.”\n\nAbout SK Enmove\n\nSK Enmove, a subsidiary of SK Innovation operating a base oil and lubricant businesses, re-branded itself in December 2022 from its previous name, SK Lubricants. SK Enmove has bolstered its global competitiveness through its premium base oils and ultra-low viscosity lubricants, engineered to enhance fuel economy in automobiles. The company extends the vision by focusing on expanding into emerging markets, such as data center immersion cooling and battery thermal management, with an aim to improve electrical efficiency. The transition to an increasingly electrified and eco-friendly landscape, SK Enmove’s overarching goal is to become an \"Energy Saving Company\" that drives sustainable growth."
