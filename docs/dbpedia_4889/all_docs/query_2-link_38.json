        "text": "Regular physical activity is proven to help prevent and manage noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes and several cancers. It also helps to maintain a healthy body weight and can improve mental health, quality of life and well-being. Physical activity refers to all movement. Popular ways to be active include walking, cycling, wheeling, sports, active recreation and play, and can be done at any level of skill and for enjoyment by everybody. Work such as household chores or jobs requiring physical labour is another way to be physically active.\n\nYet, current global estimates show 1 in 3 adults and 81% of adolescents do not do enough physical activity. Furthermore, as countries develop economically, levels of inactivity increase and can be as high as 70% due to changing transport patterns, increased use of technology for work and recreation, cultural values and increasing sedentary behaviour.\n\nSedentary behaviour is periods of low energy expenditure such as sitting and watching TV. Both sedentary behaviour and inadequate levels of physical activity have negative impacts on health systems, the environment, economic development, community and individual well-being and quality of life.\n\nPhysical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and death worldwide. Alternately, regular physical activity reduces risk of many types of cancer by 8–28%; heart disease and stroke by 19%; diabetes by 17%, depression and dementia by 28–32%. It is estimated that 4–5 million deaths per year could be averted if the global population was more active.\n\nOne in 4 adults and 4 in 5 adolescents don’t do enough physical activity. Women and girls generally are less active than men and boys, widening health inequalities. Older adults and people living with disabilities are also less likely to be active and miss out on the physical, mental and social health benefits. Physical inactivity burdens society through the hidden and growing cost of medical care and loss of productivity.\n\nWHO developed an economic analysis which predicts that nearly 500 million new cases of preventable major NCDs will occur globally between 2020 and 2030 if the prevalence of physical inactivity does not change. These NCDs will cost an estimated US $300 billion in healthcare costs alone in that 11 year period, or about US$ 27 billion per year. These estimates do not include the significant indirect costs including loss of productivity.\n\nFailing to increase levels of physical activity will negatively impact attainment of global targets as well as multiple SDGs."
