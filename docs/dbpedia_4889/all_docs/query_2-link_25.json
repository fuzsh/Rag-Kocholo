        "text": "Hong Kong’s national sports associations have been told to include ‘China’ into their official organisation names or face expulsion from the city’s Olympic Committee, a move that could result in a loss of funding and the right to take part in major competitions.\n\nIn a letter sent out to about 60 associations yet to use the designation, which includes the likes of the Hong Kong Football Association and Hong Kong Rugby Union, officials gave the governing bodies until July to make the switch.\n\nWriting on behalf of the organisation, Edgar Yang Joe-tsi, the Olympic Committee’s honorary secretary general, cited the requirements of Article 149 the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, which lays out the need to use ‘Hong Kong, China’ in dealing with international organisations.\n\nHowever, the article also says that the designation be used ‘as required’, which many associations had interpreted as meaning it was not mandatory.\n\nAnd some officials believe the change in the Olympic Committee’s stance is linked to the national anthem row that erupted late last year, when the wrong song was played at a rugby competition involving the Hong Kong men’s Sevens team.\n\n“If your association will continue to represent Hong Kong in international sports competitions/activities, you are required to include the words ‘Hong Kong, China’ in your association name,” Yang wrote.\n\n“You are also reminded to use the name ‘Hong Kong, China’ when participating in any international sports competitions/activities and to display it on uniforms, websites and all other publicity materials, where applicable.”\n\nA failure to join the likes of Hong Kong China Swimming Association, which changed its name last year, could put government support in jeopardy, Yang told the Post.\n\n“We have the obligation of using the name ‘Hong Kong, China’ as Hong Kong has become part of China as a special administrative region after 1997,” Yang said. “Over the years only a small number of the NSAs have made the change and it’s time to ask them to follow the procedures.\n\n“Many of these NSAs are using public funding from the government and using a proper organisation name should be their responsibility. If they don’t want to change, they should leave the Olympic Committee which has been carrying the name Hong Kong, China since 1999.”\n\nAn individual sport cannot take part in major multi-sport events, such as the Olympics or Asian Games, if they are not a member of the Olympic Committee.\n\nWhile Emily Mak, the executive director of Hong Kong Squash, said she did not think any governing body would not risk losing the right to represent the city by not complying, changing a name was not that simple.\n\n“But the process is not that simple of just changing the name of the organisation. It also involves a lot of follow-up actions such as correspondence with banks and other organisations, domestic and international. We will have to discuss with our committee members to see how we can do it.”\n\nA group would have to call an extraordinary general meeting if it wanted to change the name, as it involves amendment of the “Articles of Association” and in some cases would require permission from world governing bodies.\n\nPui Kwan-kay, the HKFA chairman, said the organisation had been using its name since 1914 and as a member of international governing bodies such as Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation.\n\n“We will need to discuss among ourselves if we need to change our organisation name,” he said. “The big trend is using Hong Kong, China after the handover, but this is a serious matter. We have to approach it with great caution.”\n\nThe tension between Hong Kong and China in football has grown since the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, when Hong Kong fans booed the China national anthem at home games.\n\nA source said the HKFA had been under pressure from sports authorities in mainland China to change its name.\n\nVivian Lau Chiang-chu, the Hong Kong Tenpin Bowling Congress chairwoman, thought the Olympic Committee was reacting to the row over the national anthem.\n\n“We have been taking this issue lightly as we only use the name Hong Kong, China ‘as required’,” she said. “But after what happened recently, the authorities are more alert of using the correct name for Hong Kong sports.”\n\nAt the Asian Rugby Seven Series in Incheon, South Korea in November, Glory to Hong Kong, a song closely associated with the social unrest in 2019, was incorrectly broadcast as the China national anthem for the Hong Kong side before the final."
