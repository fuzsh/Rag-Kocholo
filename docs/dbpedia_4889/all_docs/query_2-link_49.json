It is comprised of an Executive Board, the Union Senate, the Allocations Board and University Judiciary. Offices are located on the third floor of the Shapiro Campus Center in Room 301.\n\nThe list below provides information on all active undergraduate clubs and organizations on campus. You can sort the columns to find clubs by name, acronym or category. Can't find a club, or wish to create a new one? Please email Student Engagement."
