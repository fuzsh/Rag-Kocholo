        "text": "Chinese New Year is an ancient holiday. Most of its traditions date back to thousands of years ago. But as times change, itâs not surprising that new traditions are formed. The most prominent is the Chinese New Year Gala (Chinese full name: ä¸­å¤®çµè§å°æ¥èèæ¬¢æä¼ / zhÅng yÄng diÃ n shÃ¬ tÃ¡i chÅ«n jiÄ liÃ¡n huÄn wÇn huÃ¬).\n\nThis televised variety show is broadcasted by China Central Television (CCTV). Also known as the Spring Festival Gala or Chunwan (æ¥æ / ChÅ«nwÇn), it is one of the premier TV events in China. It is popular in diaspora Chinese communities as well and the Gala makes it a point to include them in the show.\n\nOrigins of the Spring Festival Gala\n\nPerformances such as Chinese opera, lion dances and acrobatics have always been part of Spring Festival celebrations. They moved to the TV with the invention of the technology.\n\nBeijing Television had small-scale New Yearâs Eve broadcasts starting in 1956. But in 1983, CCTV aired its first live Chinese New Year program. The show begins at 8:00 PM on New Yearâs Eve and goes on until a bit after midnight. As technology develops, the stage also changes.\n\nIn 1996, the Gala was broadcasted from separate studios in Nanjing and Shanghai, in addition to Beijing. This was repeated in 2016, showing live split-screens from 4 other trademark citiesâQuÃ¡nzhÅu (æ³å·), XÄ«âÄn (è¥¿å®), GuÇngzhÅu (å¹¿å·) and Hulunbuir (å¼ä¼¦è´å° / hÅ« lÃºn bÃ¨i Är).\n\nIn 2009, LED lights were installed on the stage for extra effects.\n\nIn recent years, livestreams became available for diaspora Chinese on websites such as YouTube. There is also an online Chunwan aired beforehand with celebrities targeted at the younger generations.\n\nTypes of performances\n\nChinese New Year Gala performances include:\n\nComedy acts\n\nThe two types of Chinese comedy acts are stand-up skits (ç¸å£° / xiÃ ng shÄng) and sketches (å°å / xiÇo pÇn). The stand-up skits, also known as cross-talk, still maintain the original performance style. There are usually two male comedians and they wear the traditional cheongsam.\n\nSketches often explore real-life issues and give social commentary within a comedic frame. In recent years, fraud, migrant workers and family life have been hot topics.\n\nSong and dance\n\nSong and dance performances range from traditional classic styles, to folk, ethnic and modern acts. Many old-time favorites can be seen every year, but younger celebrities and amateurs are included as well.\n\nRemixes of popular songs can be heard, such as Little Apple (å°è¹æ / xiÇo pÃ­ng guÇ). Some songs debuted here go viral as well. For example, BÃ¨i Ã©r ShuÇng (åå¿ç½) became the ringtone of many middle-aged folks in 2016.\n\nC-pop singers, such as Leehom Wang (çåå® / WÃ¡ng lÃ¬ hÃ³ng), HÃ¡n GÄng (é©åº) and Chris Lee (æå®æ¥ / LÇ yÇ chÅ«n) have been invited to appeal to more demographics.\n\nThere are usually song medleys and dances featuring the different ethnic groups in China. The major groups include Tibetans, Mongols, Uyghurs, Miao and more. In addition, you can hear music performances with both Western and Chinese instruments.\n\nAcrobats and magic\n\nChinese acrobatic shows are some of the most breathtaking acts. The contortionists are impossibly flexible and they perform heart stopping maneuvers and flips. You will see traditional touches, such as spinning plates, climbing bamboo poles and Chinese yo-yo tricks (ç©ºç«¹ / kÅng zhÃº).\n\nThereâs usually at least one stage magic performance each year as well. Foreign magicians are common and the Gala MCs are often incorporated into the act. Magician Louis Liu (åè°¦ / LiÃº qiÄn) shot to stardom and returned in consecutive years.\n\nChinese opera\n\nThough emphasis on the traditional arts has decreased over the years, they still play a role in the Gala.\n\nEvery year, there is a Chinese opera medley near the end. It features well-known parts from Peking opera (äº¬å§ / jÄ«ng jÃ¹), Henan opera (è±«å§ / yÃ¹ jÃ¹), Shaoxing opera (è¶å§ / yuÃ¨ jÃ¹) and more.\n\nCCTV-3 also has a special New Year performance exclusively for traditional opera.\n\nTraditions of the Gala\n\nAs midnight nears, the MCs begin giving out New Year blessings and reading Spring Festival couplets.\n\nTraditionally, the Gala would end with a rendition of the song âCanât Forget Tonightâ (é¾å¿ä»å®µ / nÃ¡n wÃ ng jÄ«n xiÄo). The original singer was LÇ GÇ YÄ« (æè°·ä¸) and she is still invited to lead the song, though she is more than 70 years old now. The tradition was broken in 2012, but reinstated in 2013.\n\nNotable moments\n\n1987: Kris Phillips (è´¹ç¿ / fÃ¨i xiÃ¡ng) became the first Taiwanese to perform in Chunwan. At that time, Mainland China and Taiwan had still not opened their doors to each other. Phillips further developed a career in New York Broadway.\n\n1990: Comedian Zhao Benshan (èµµæ¬å±±) stepped onto the Spring Festival Gala stage for the first time. He later became a regularâalmost a symbol of the Galaâand people grew to expect his sketches every year.\n\n2005: The most famous performance was âThousand Hand Buddhaâ (åæè§é³ / qiÄn shÇu guÄn yÄ«n). The impressive dance requires extreme precision and was performed by mute and/or deaf youths.\n\n2006: Two performances made headlines this year. The first was âQiÃ o XÄ« YÃ¡ngâ (ä¿å¤é³) performed by children and seniors. The dance imitates Chinese Shadow Play, a traditional art. The other was âThe Auspicious Threeâ (åç¥¥ä¸å® / jÃ­ xiÃ¡ng sÄn bÇo), which featured the Mongolian language.\n\nIt was also announced through the Gala that two pandas would be gifted to Taiwan. The names were Tuantuan and Yuanyuan. Together, they make âtuÃ¡n yuanâ (å¢å), which means âreunion.â\n\n2008: Before Chinese New Year, there were extreme snowstorms in Southern China. The Gala included a poetry recital performance to motivate viewers to help with disaster relief. They also invited seven astronauts who were preparing to go to the moon.\n\n2012: Singer and actor Han Geng performed the Legend of Chinese New Yearâs Eve. Through this, we learn of how a young boy defeated Nian (å¹´), a monster who appeared annually to plunder villages. The performance includes cultural elements, such as the traditional art background, kung fu and use of internal energy (æ° / qi).\n\nReach and significance\n\nThe Chinese New Year Gala is shown on various CCTV channels, such as CCTV-4 (international), CCTV-EspaÃ±ol and CCTV-FranÃ§ais. Other TV channels relay the show and schedule their own galas on different nights to avoid competition.\n\nThe performers are usually invited by the production team. Starting in the 2000s, amateur artists have been encouraged to join. The televised auditions and competitions are popular too.\n\nThough yearly viewership ratings are disputed, a couple hundred million viewers are definite. The acts, especially comedy sketches, work to promote good ethics and customs. The performances also give a good idea of what Chinese culture is like.\n\nWhether in the United States or in the islands of Fiji, diaspora Chinese would calculate time zone differences to watch the Gala. If you tune in to the livestreams, you will see many comments reminiscing about the festivities in their childhood.\n\nTimes are changing and new traditions arise. But what doesnât change is the meaning and impact of Chinese New Year. Regardless of the form, it will continue to be one of the most important nights of the year, full of happiness and hope."
