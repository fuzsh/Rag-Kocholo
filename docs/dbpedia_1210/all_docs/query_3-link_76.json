        "text": "It’s the final countdown for Chinese New Year, and CCTV is building up for its annual Spring Festival Gala, the world’s most watched TV event. Feb 16 was the final rehearsal, and a chance for the directors to make some last minute changes to the rundown.\n\nThe directors of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala are setting out the finalized rundown, based audience feedback from five rehearsals.\n\nSome 30 acts are confirmed, 10 of which are sketch shows. This year’s show utilizes a lot of new technology.\n\n“Creative programs are specially made for this gala, and there are few chances to see them elsewhere. For example, holographic technology and combination of Kung Fu with other traditional arts. What’s more, we try our best to showcase every traditional costume of the country’s 56 different ethnic groups,” said Zou Lei, creative program director of CCTV Spring Festival Gala.\n\nBig-time stars as well as new comers are joining the gala, offering some big surprises. One of the grass-root performers is a young boy who sells handbags in Hong Kong.\n\nThe gala ran for six hours at its first rehearsal. It’s now been honed down to 4 hours and 40 minutes, which means some acts have had to be left out.\n\n“Those who don’t make the final will probably be offered a chance to appear at the Lantern Festival Gala at the end of Spring Festival,” Zou said.\n\nCCTV’s spectacular Spring Festival Gala will be shown live throughout the evening on Chinese New Year’s Eve this Wednesday, marking the start of the Year of Sheep."
