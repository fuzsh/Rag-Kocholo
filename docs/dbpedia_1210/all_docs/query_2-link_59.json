Marking the end of winter and the beginning of spring, observances traditionally take place from Chinese New Year's Eve, the evening preceding the first day of the year, to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.[a]\n\nChinese New Year is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture. It has influenced similar celebrations in other cultures, commonly referred to collectively as Lunar New Year, such as the Losar of Tibet, the Tết of Vietnam, the Korean New Year, and the Ryukyu New Year.[3][4][5] It is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries that house significant Overseas Chinese or Sinophone populations, especially in Southeast Asia. These include Singapore,[6] Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,[7] the Philippines,[8] Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also prominent beyond Asia, especially in Australia, Canada, France, Mauritius,[9] New Zealand, Peru,[10] South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as in many European countries.[11][12][13]\n\nThe Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs. The festival was traditionally a time to honour deities as well as ancestors.[14] Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely,[15] and the evening preceding the New Year's Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also a tradition for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another practised custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red paper-cuts and couplets. Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red envelopes.\n\nNames\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Lunar New Year\n\nIn Chinese, the festival is commonly known as the \"Spring Festival\" (traditional Chinese: 春節; simplified Chinese: 春节; pinyin: Chūnjié),[16] as the spring season in the lunisolar calendar traditionally starts with lichun, the first of the twenty-four solar terms which the festival celebrates around the time of the Chinese New Year.[17] The name was first proposed in 1914 by Yuan Shikai, who was at the time the interim president of the Republic of China.[18] The official usage of the name \"Spring Festival\" was retained by the government of the People's Republic of China, but the government of the Republic of China based in Taiwan has since adopted the name \"Traditional Chinese New Year\".[19]\n\nThe festival is also called \"Lunar New Year\" in English, despite the traditional Chinese calendar being lunisolar and not lunar. However, \"Chinese New Year\" is still a commonly-used translation for people of non-Chinese backgrounds.[20] Along with the Han Chinese inside and outside of Greater China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year. Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines celebrate it as an official festival.[20]\n\nSee also: Chinese calendar\n\nThe Chinese calendar defines the lunisolar month containing the winter solstice as the eleventh month, meaning that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month occurs[b]).[21][2] In more than 96 per cent of years, the Chinese New Year is the closest new moon to the beginning of spring (lichun) according to the calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, the Chinese New Year occurs on the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February.[22]\n\nGregorian Date Animal Day of the week 2024 10 Feb Dragon Saturday 2025 29 Jan Snake Wednesday 2026 17 Feb Horse Tuesday 2027 6 Feb Goat Saturday 2028 26 Jan Monkey Wednesday 2029 13 Feb Rooster Tuesday 2030 3 Feb Dog Sunday 2031 23 Jan Pig Thursday 2032 11 Feb Rat Wednesday 2033 31 Jan Ox Monday 2034 19 Feb Tiger Sunday 2035 8 Feb Rabbit Thursday\n\nMythology\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to legend, Chinese New Year started with a mythical beast called the Nian (a beast that lives under the sea or in the mountains) during the annual Spring Festival. The Nian would eat villagers, especially children in the middle of the night.[23] One year, all the villagers decided to hide from the beast. An older man appeared before the villagers went into hiding and said that he would stay the night and would get revenge on the Nian. The old man put red papers up and set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to their town and saw that nothing had been destroyed. They assumed that the old man was a deity who came to save them. The villagers then understood that Yanhuang had discovered that the Nian was afraid of the color red and loud noises.[23] Then the tradition grew when New Year was approaching, and the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors and used firecrackers and drums to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by Hongjun Laozu, an ancient Taoist monk.[24]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the new year celebration was established, ancient Chinese gathered and celebrated the end of harvest in autumn. However, this was not the Mid-Autumn Festival, during which Chinese gathered with family to worship the Moon. In the Classic of Poetry, a poem written during Western Zhou (1045 BC – 771 BC) by an anonymous farmer, described the traditions of celebrating the 10th month of the ancient solar calendar, which was in autumn.[25] According to the poem, during this time people clean millet-stack sites, toast guests with mijiu (rice wine), kill lambs and cook their meat, go to their masters' home, toast the master, and cheer the prospect of living long together. The 10th-month celebration is believed to be one of the prototypes of Chinese New Year.[26] The records of the first Chinese new year celebration can be traced to the Warring States period (475 – 221 BC). In the Lüshi Chunqiu, in Qin state an exorcism ritual to expel illness, called \"Big Nuo\", was recorded as being carried out on the last day of the year.[27][28] Later, Qin unified China, and the Qin dynasty was founded; and the ritual spread. It evolved into the practice of cleaning one's house thoroughly in the days preceding Chinese New Year.\n\nThe first mention of celebrating at the start of a new year was recorded during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD). In the book Simin Yueling (四民月令), written by the Eastern Han agronomist Cui Shi (崔寔), a celebration was described: \"The starting day of the first month, is called Zheng Ri. I bring my wife and children, to worship ancestors and commemorate my father.\" Later he wrote: \"Children, wife, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren all serve pepper wine to their parents, make their toast, and wish their parents good health. It's a thriving view.\"[29] The practice of worshipping ancestors on New Year's Eve is maintained by Chinese people to this day.[30]\n\nHan Chinese also started the custom of visiting acquaintances' homes and wishing each other a happy new year. In Book of the Later Han, volume 27, a county officer was recorded as going to his prefect's house with a government secretary, toasting the prefect, and praising the prefect's merit.[31][32]\n\nDuring the Jin dynasty (266–420), people started the New Year's Eve tradition of all-night revelry called shousui (守歲). It was described in Western Jin general Zhou Chu's article Fengtu Ji (風土記, 'Notes on Local Conditions'): \"At the ending of a year, people gift and wish each other, calling it Kuisui (饋歲, 'time for gifts'); people invited others with drinks and food, calling it Biesui (別歲, 'sending off the year'); on New Year's Eve, people stayed up all night until sunrise, calling it Shousui (守歲, 'guard the year').\"[33] The article used the phrase chuxi (除夕) to indicate New Year's Eve—a phrase still used today.\n\nThe Northern and Southern dynasties book Jingchu Suishiji describes the practice of firing bamboo in the early morning of New Year's Day,[34] a New Year's tradition of the ancient Chinese. Poet and chancellor of the Tang dynasty, Lai Gu, also described this tradition in his poem Early Spring (早春): \"新曆才將半紙開，小亭猶聚爆竿灰\", meaning \"Another new year just started as a half opening paper, and the family gathered around the dust of exploded bamboo pole.\"[35] The practice was used by ancient Chinese people to scare away evil spirits, since bamboo would noisily crack and explode from firing.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, people established the custom of sending bai nian tie (拜年帖, \"New Year's greetings\"), New Year's greeting cards. It is said that the custom was started by Emperor Taizong of Tang. The emperor wrote \"普天同慶\" (\"whole nation celebrates together\") on gold leaves and sent them to his ministers. Word of the emperor's gesture spread, and later it became the custom of people in general, who used Xuan paper instead of gold leaves.[36] Another theory is that bai nian tie was derived from the Han dynasty's name tag, men zhuang (門狀, \"door opening\"). As imperial examinations became essential and reached their heyday under the Tang dynasty, candidates curried favour to become pupils of respected teachers in order to get recommendation letters. After obtaining good examination marks, a pupil went to the teacher's home with a men zhuang to convey their gratitude. Eventually, men zhuang became a symbol of good luck, and people started sending them to friends on New Year's Day, calling them by a new name, bai nian tie.[37]\n\nThe Chunlian (Spring Couplets) was written by Meng Chang, an emperor of the Later Shu (935–965 AD), during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period：\"新年納餘慶，嘉節號長春\" (\"Enjoying past legacies in the new year, the holiday foreseeing the long-lasting spring\"). As described by Song dynasty official Zhang Tangying in his book Shu Tao Wu, Volume 2: on the day of New Year's Eve, the emperor ordered the scholar Xin Yinxun to write the couplets on peach wood and hang them on the emperor's bedroom door.[38][39] It is believed that placing the couplets on the door to the home in the days preceding the new year was widespread during the Song dynasty. The famous Northern Song politician, litterateur, philosopher, and poet Wang Anshi recorded the custom in his poem \"元日\" (\"New Year's Day\").[40]\n\nThe poem Yuan Ri (元日) also includes the word bao zhu (爆竹, \"exploding bamboo\"), which is believed to be a reference to firecrackers, instead of the previous tradition of firing bamboo, both of which are called the same in the Chinese language. After gunpowder was invented in the Tang dynasty and widely used under the Song dynasty, people modified the tradition of firing bamboo by filling the bamboo pole with gunpowder, which made for louder explosions. Later under the Song, people discarded the bamboo and started to use paper to wrap the gunpowder in cylinders, in imitation of the bamboo. The firecracker was still called bao zhu (爆竹), thus equating the new and old traditions. It is also recorded that people linked the firecrackers with hemp rope and created the bian pao (鞭炮, \"gunpowder whip\") in the Song dynasty. Both bao zhu (爆竹) and bian pao (鞭炮) are still used today to celebrate the Chinese New Year and other festive occasions.[41]\n\nIt was also during the Song dynasty that people started to give money to children in celebration of a new year. The money was called sui nian qian (随年钱, \"money based on age\"). In the chapter, \"Ending of a Year\" (歲除) in Wulin jiushi (武林舊事), concubines of the emperor prepared a hundred and twenty coins for princes and princesses to wish them longevity.[42]\n\nNew Year's celebrations continued under the Yuan dynasty, when people also gave nian gao (年糕, \"year cakes\") to relatives.[43]\n\nThe tradition of eating Chinese dumplings jiaozi (餃子) was established under the Ming dynasty at the latest. It is described in the book Youzhongzhi (酌中志): \"People get up at 5 in the morning of new year's day, burn incense and light firecrackers, throw door latch or wooden bars in the air three times, drink pepper and thuja wine, eat dumplings. Sometimes put one or two silver currency inside dumplings, and whoever gets the money will attain a year of fortune.\"[44] Modern Chinese people also put other food that is auspicious into dumplings such as dates, which prophesy a flourishing new year; candy, which predicts sweet days; and nian gao (年糕, \"year cakes\"), which foretells a rich life.\n\nIn the Qing dynasty, the name ya sui qian (壓歲錢, \"New Year's Money)\" was money given to children during New Year's. The book Qing Jia Lu (清嘉錄) recorded: \"elders give children coins threaded together by a red string, and the money is called Ya Sui Qian.\"[45] The term is still used by Chinese people today. The money was presented in two forms: coins strung on red string or colourful purses filled with coins.[46]\n\nIn 1928, the ruling Kuomintang party decreed that the Chinese New Year would fall on 1 Jan of the Gregorian Calendar, but this was abandoned due to overwhelming opposition. In 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, official Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China. The State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the public should \"change customs\" and have a \"revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival.\" Since people needed to work on Chinese New Year's Eve, they would not need holidays during the Spring Festival. In 1980, the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations were reinstated.[47]\n\nPublic holiday\n\n[edit]\n\nChinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in some countries and territories where there is a sizeable Chinese population. Since Chinese New Year falls on different days of the week each year, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day if the New Year (as a public holiday) falls on a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year's Eve (9 February) falls on Saturday and the New Year's Day (10 February) on Sunday. Depending on the country, the holiday may be termed differently; common names in English are \"Chinese New Year\", \"Lunar New Year\", \"New Year Festival\", and \"Spring Festival\".\n\nFor New Year celebrations that follow Chinese-inspired calendars but are outside of China and Chinese diaspora (such as Korea's Seollal and Vietnam's Tết), see the article on Lunar New Year.\n\nFor other countries and regions where Chinese New Year is celebrated but not an official holiday, see the table below.\n\nCountry and region Official name Description Number of days Malaysia Tahun Baru Cina The first 2 days of Chinese New Year.[48] 2[49][48] Singapore Chinese New Year The first 2 days of Chinese New Year.[50] 2 Brunei Tahun Baru Cina Half-day on Chinese New Year's Eve and the first day of Chinese New Year.[51] 1 Hong Kong Lunar New Year The first 3 days of Chinese New Year.[52] 3 Macau Novo Ano Lunar The first 3 days of Chinese New Year[53] 3 Indonesia Tahun Baru Imlek (Sin Cia) The first day of Chinese New Year.[54][55] 1 China Spring Festival (Chūn Jié) The first 3 days of Chinese New Year.

The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. Additional bridge holidays may apply, resulting in 9-day or 10-day weekends.[59][60][61] 4 (legally), 9–10 (including Saturdays and Sundays)[62] Thailand Wan Trut Chin (Chinese New Year's Day) Observed by Thai Chinese and parts of the private sector. Usually celebrated for three days, starting on the day before the Chinese New Year's Eve. Chinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Satun[63] and Songkhla Provinces.[50] 1 Vietnam Tết Nguyên Đán (Vietnamese New Year) The first 3 days of Chinese New Year. 3 New York, United States Lunar New Year The first days of Lunar New Year. 1 California, United States Lunar New Year The first days of Lunar New Year. 1 Suriname Maan Nieuwjaar The first day of Chinese New Year. 1\n\nFestivities\n\n[edit]\n\nRed couplets and red lanterns are displayed on the door frames and light up the atmosphere. The air is filled with strong Chinese emotions. In stores in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other cities, products of traditional Chinese style have started to lead fashion trend[s]. Buy yourself a Chinese-style coat, get your kids tiger-head hats and shoes, and decorate your home with some beautiful red Chinese knots, then you will have an authentic Chinese-style Spring Festival.\n\n— Xinwen Lianbo, January 2001, quoted by Li Ren, Imagining China in the Era of Global Consumerism and Local Consciousness[64]\n\nDuring the festival, people around China will prepare different gourmet dishes for their families and guests. Influenced by the flourished cultures, foods from different places look and taste totally different. Among them, the most well-known ones are dumplings from northern China and Tangyuan from southern China.[citation needed]\n\nPreceding days\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the eighth day of the lunisolar month prior to Chinese New Year, the Laba Festival, a traditional porridge, Laba porridge (simplified Chinese: 腊八粥; traditional Chinese: 臘八粥; pinyin: làbā zhōu), is served in remembrance of an ancient festival, called La, that occurred shortly after the winter solstice.[65] Pickles such as Laba garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are also made on this day. For those that practice Buddhism, the Laba holiday is also considered Bodhi Day. Layue (simplified Chinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: Làyuè) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunisolar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉; pinyin: làròu). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at first light, with the first bowl offered to the family's ancestors and the household deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with leftovers distributed to relatives and friends. It's still served as a special breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \"La month\" is similar to Advent in Christianity. Many families eat vegetarian on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat are eaten on Chinese New Year day.\n\nOn the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying \"Wash away the dirt on nin ya baat\" (Chinese: 年廿八，洗邋遢; pinyin: nián niàn bā, xǐ lātà; Jyutping: nin4 jaa6 baat3, sai2 laap6 taap3 (laat6 taat3)), but the practice is not restricted to nin ya baat (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year. Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and couplets. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word \"hair\" (fa) and the word for \"prosperity\". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.\n\nIn many households where Buddhism or Taoism is observed, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and decorations used to adorn altars over the past year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts on Little New Year, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also \"send gods back to heaven\" (Chinese: 送神; pinyin: sòngshén), an example would be burning a paper effigy of the Kitchen God, the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the Jade Emperor of the family household's transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \"bribe\" the deities into reporting good things about the family.\n\nPrior to the Reunion Dinner, a prayer of thanksgiving is held to mark the safe passage of the previous year. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember their ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered. Some people do not give a Buddhist prayer due to the influence of Christianity, with a Christian prayer offered instead.\n\nChinese New Year's Eve\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chinese New Year's Eve\n\nThe day before Chinese New Year is usually accompanied with a dinner feast, consisting of special meats as a main course and an offering for the New Year. This meal is comparable to Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner.\n\nIn northern China, it is customary to make jiaozi or dumplings which are eaten at midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth because their shape resembles a Chinese sycee. In the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake (niangao) and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days.\n\nSome families visit local temples hours before midnight to pray for success by lighting the first incense of the year. Today many households hold parties. Traditionally, firecrackers were lit to ward off evil spirits. The household doors are sealed and not reopened until dawn in a ritual called \"opening the door of fortune\" (simplified Chinese: 开财门; traditional Chinese: 開財門; pinyin: kāicáimén). The tradition of staying up late on Chinese New Year's Eve is known as shousui (Chinese: 守岁). It is still practised and believed to add to parental longevity.\n\nFirst day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first day, known as the \"Spring Festival\" (simplified Chinese: 春节; traditional Chinese: 春節) is for the welcoming of the deities of the heavens and Earth on midnight. It is a traditional practice to light fireworks, burn bamboo sticks and firecrackers, and lion dance troupes, were done commonly as a tradition to ward off evil spirits.\n\nTypical actions such as lighting fires and using knives are considered taboo, thus all consumable food has to be cooked prior. Using the broom, swearing, and breaking any dinnerware without appeasing the deities are also considered taboo.[70]\n\nNormal traditions occurring on the first day involve house gatherings to the families, specifically the elders and families to the oldest and most senior members of their extended families, usually their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, and trading Mandarin oranges as a courtesy to symbolize wealth and good luck. Members of the family who are married also give red envelopes containing cash known as lai see (Cantonese: 利事) or angpow (Hokkien and Teochew), or hongbao (Mandarin: 红包), a form of a blessing and to suppress both the ageing and challenges that were associated with the coming year, to junior members of the family, mostly children and teenagers. Business managers may also give bonuses in the form of red packets to employees.[71] The money can be of any form, specifically numbers ending with 8 (Mandarin: ba 八), which sounds similar to fa (Mandarin: 发), meaning prosperity, but packets with denominations of odd or unlucky numbers, or packets without money are usually not allowed due to bad luck. The number 4 is especially unlucky, because it is sounded as si (Mandarin: 死), which means death.[72][71]\n\nWhile fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally very popular, some regions have banned them due to concerns over fire hazards. For this reason, various city governments (e.g., Kowloon, Beijing, Shanghai for a number of years) issued bans over fireworks and firecrackers in certain precincts of the city. As a substitute, large-scale fireworks display have been launched by governments in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nSecond day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe second day, entitled \"a year's beginning\" (simplified Chinese: 开年; traditional Chinese: 開年; pinyin: kāinián), oversees married daughters visiting their birth parents, relatives and close friends, often renew family ties and relationship. (Traditionally, married daughters didn't have the opportunity to visit their birth families frequently.)\n\nThe second day also saw giving offering money and sacrifices to the God of Wealth (Chinese: 财神) to symbolize a rewarding time after hardship in the preceding year. During the days of imperial China, \"beggars and other unemployed people circulate[d] from family to family, carrying a picture [of the God of Wealth] shouting, \"Cai Shen dao!\" [The God of Wealth has come!].\"[74] Householders would respond with \"lucky money\" to reward the messengers. Business people of the Cantonese dialect group will hold a 'Hoi Nin' prayer to start their business on the second day of Chinese New Year, blessing business to strive in the coming year.\n\nAs this day is believed to be The Birthday of Che Kung, a deity worshipped in Hong Kong, worshippers go to Che Kung Temples to pray for his blessing. A representative from the government asks Che Kung about the city's fortune through kau cim.\n\nThird day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe third day is known as \"red mouth\" (Chinese: 赤口; pinyin: Chìkǒu). Chikou is also called \"Chigou's Day\" (Chinese: 赤狗日; pinyin: Chìgǒurì). Chigou, literally \"red dog\", is an epithet of \"the God of Blazing Wrath\" (Chinese: 熛怒之神; pinyin: Biāo nù zhī shén). Rural villagers continue the tradition of burning paper offerings over trash fires. It is considered an unlucky day to have guests or go visiting.[75] Hakka villagers in rural Hong Kong in the 1960s called it the Day of the Poor Devil and believed everyone should stay at home.[76] This is also considered a propitious day to visit the temple of the God of Wealth and have one's future told.\n\nFourth day\n\n[edit]\n\nIn those communities that celebrate Chinese New Year for 15 days, the fourth day is when corporate \"spring dinners\" kick off and business returns to normal. Other areas that have a longer Chinese New Year holiday will celebrate and welcome the gods that were previously sent on this day.\n\nFifth day\n\n[edit]\n\nThis day is the god of Wealth's birthday. In northern China, people eat jiaozi, or dumplings, on the morning of powu (Chinese: 破五; pinyin: pòwǔ). In Taiwan, businesses traditionally re-open on the next day (the sixth day), accompanied by firecrackers.\n\nIt is also common in China that on the 5th day people will shoot off firecrackers to get Guan Yu's attention, thus ensuring his favour and good fortune for the new year.[77]\n\nSixth day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sixth day is Horse's Day, on which people drive away the Ghost of Poverty by throwing out the garbage stored up during the festival. The ways vary but basically have the same meaning—to drive away the Ghost of Poverty, which reflects the general desire of the Chinese people to ring out the old and ring in the new, to send away the previous poverty and hardship and to usher in the good life of the New Year.[78]\n\nSeventh day\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Renri\n\nThe seventh day, traditionally known as Renri (the common person's birthday), is the day when everyone grows one year older. In some overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Singapore, it is also the day when tossed raw fish salad, yusheng, is eaten for continued wealth and prosperity.\n\nFor many Chinese Buddhists, this is another day to avoid meat, the seventh day commemorating the birth of Sakra, lord of the devas in Buddhist cosmology who is analogous to the Jade Emperor.\n\nEighth day\n\n[edit]\n\nAnother family dinner is held to celebrate the eve of the birth of the Jade Emperor, the ruler of heaven. People normally return to work by the eighth day, therefore the Store owners will host a lunch/dinner with their employees, thanking their employees for the work they have done for the whole year.\n\nNinth day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ninth day is traditionally known as the birthday of the Jade Emperor of Heaven (Chinese: 玉皇; pinyin: Yù Huáng) and many people offered prayer in the Taoist Pantheon as thanks or gratitude.[79] It is commonly known as called Ti Kong Dan (Chinese: 天公誕; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Thiⁿ-kong Tan), Ti Kong Si (Chinese: 天公生; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Thiⁿ-kong Siⁿ/Thiⁿ-kong Seⁿ) or Pai Ti Kong (Chinese: 拜天公; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pài Thiⁿ-kong), and is especially important to Hokkiens.[80]\n\nA prominent requisite offering is sugarcane.[80] Legends holds that the Hokkien were spared from a massacre by Japanese pirates by hiding in a sugarcane plantation between the eighth and ninth days of the Chinese New Year, coinciding with the Jade Emperor's birthday.[80] \"Sugarcane\" (Chinese: 甘蔗; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: kam-chià) is a near homonym to \"thank you\" (Chinese: 感謝; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: kám-siā) in the Hokkien dialect.[80]\n\nIn the morning (traditionally anytime between midnight and 7 am), Taiwanese households set up an altar table with three layers: one top (containing offertories of six vegetables (Chinese: 六齋; pinyin: liù zhāi; those being noodles, fruits, cakes, tangyuan, vegetable bowls, and unripe betel), all decorated with paper lanterns) and two lower levels (five sacrifices and wines) to honour the deities below the Jade Emperor.[79] The household then kneels three times and kowtows nine times to pay obeisance and wish him a long life.[79]\n\nIncense, tea, fruit, vegetarian food or roast pig, and gold paper, are served as a customary protocol for paying respect to an honoured person.\n\nTenth day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nation celebrates the Jade Emperor's birthday on this day.\n\nFifteenth day\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lantern Festival\n\nThe fifteenth day of the new year is celebrated as the Lantern Festival, also known as the Yuanxiao Festival (simplified Chinese: 元宵节; traditional Chinese: 元宵節; pinyin: Yuán xiāo jié), the Shangyuan Festival (simplified Chinese: 上元节; traditional Chinese: 上元節; pinyin: Shàng yuán jié), and Chap Goh Meh (Chinese: 十五暝; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Cha̍p-gō͘-mê; lit. 'the fifteen night' in Hokkien). Rice dumplings, or tangyuan (simplified Chinese: 汤圆; traditional Chinese: 湯圓; pinyin: tang yuán), a sweet glutinous rice ball brewed in a soup, are eaten this day. Candles are lit outside houses as a way to guide wayward spirits home. Families may walk the streets carrying lanterns, which sometimes have riddles attached to or written on them as a tradition.[81]\n\nIn China and Malaysia, this day is celebrated by individuals seeking a romantic partner, akin to Valentine's Day.[82] Nowadays, single women write their contact number on mandarin oranges and throw them in a river or a lake after which single men collect the oranges and eat them. The taste is an indication of their possible love: sweet represents a good fate while sour represents a bad fate.\n\nThis day often marks the end of the Chinese New Year festivities.\n\nTraditional food\n\n[edit]\n\nA reunion dinner is held on New Year's Eve, during which family members gather for a celebration.[83] The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a communal hot pot as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature specialty meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and Chinese sausage) and seafood (e.g. lobster and abalone) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish (simplified Chinese: 鱼; traditional Chinese: 魚; pinyin: yú) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase \"may there be surpluses every year\" (simplified Chinese: 年年有余; traditional Chinese: 年年有餘; pinyin: niánnián yǒu yú) sounds the same as \"let there be fish every year.\" Eight individual dishes are served to reflect the belief of good fortune associated with the number. If in the previous year a death was experienced in the family, seven dishes are served.\n\nOther traditional foods consist of noodles, fruits, dumplings,[84] spring rolls,[85] and Tangyuan[83] which are also known as sweet rice balls. Each dish served during Chinese New Year represents something special. The noodles used to make longevity noodles are usually very thin, long wheat noodles. These noodles are longer than normal noodles that are usually fried and served on a plate, or boiled and served in a bowl with its broth. The noodles symbolize the wish for a long life. The fruits that are typically selected would be oranges, tangerines, and pomelos as they are round and \"golden\" in color, symbolizing fullness and wealth. Their lucky sound, when spoken, also brings good luck and fortune. The Chinese pronunciation for orange is 橙 (chéng), which sounds the same as the Chinese for 'success' (成). One of the ways to spell tangerine(桔 jú) contains the Chinese character for luck (吉 jí). Pomelos are believed to bring constant prosperity. Pomelo in Chinese (柚 yòu) sounds similar to 'to have' (有 yǒu), disregarding its tone, however it sounds exactly like 'again' (又 yòu). Dumplings and spring rolls symbolize wealth, whereas sweet rice balls symbolize family togetherness.\n\nRed packets for the immediate family are sometimes distributed during the reunion dinner. These packets contain money in an amount that reflects good luck and honorability. Several foods are consumed to usher in wealth, happiness, and good fortune. Several of the Chinese food names are homophones for words that also mean good things.\n\nMany families in China still follow the tradition of eating only vegetarian food on the first day of the New Year, as it is believed that doing so will bring good luck into their lives for the whole year.[86]\n\nLike many other New Year dishes, certain ingredients also take special precedence over others as these ingredients also have similar-sounding names with prosperity, good luck, or even counting money.\n\nFood item Simplified Chinese Traditional Chinese Hanyu Pinyin Description Buddha's delight 罗汉斋 羅漢齋 Luóhàn zhāi An elaborate vegetarian dish served by Chinese families on the eve and the first day of the New Year. A type of black hair-like algae, pronounced \"fat choy\" in Cantonese, is also featured in the dish for its name, which sounds like \"prosperity\". Hakkas usually serve kiu nyuk (Chinese: 扣肉; pinyin: kòuròu) and ngiong teu fu. Chicken 鸡 雞 Jī Boiled chicken is served because it is figured that any family, no matter how humble their circumstances, can afford a chicken for Chinese New Year. Apples 苹果 蘋果 Píngguǒ Apples symbolize peace because the word for apple (\"ping\") is a homonym of the word for peace. Fish 鱼 魚 Yú Is usually eaten or merely displayed on the eve of Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of fish makes it a homophone for \"surpluses\" (simplified Chinese: 余; traditional Chinese: 餘; pinyin: yú). Garlic 蒜 Suàn Is usually served in a dish with rondelles of Chinese sausage or Chinese cured meat during Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of Garlic makes it a homophone for \"calculating (money)\" (Chinese: 算; pinyin: suàn). The Chinese cured meat is so chosen because it is traditionally the primary method for storing meat over the winter, and the meat rondelles resemble coins. Jau gok 油角 Yóu jiǎo The main Chinese New Year dumpling for Cantonese families. It is believed to resemble a sycee or yuánbǎo, the old Chinese gold and silver ingots, and to represent prosperity for the coming year. Jiaozi 饺子 餃子 Jiǎozi The common dumpling eaten in northern China, also believed to resemble sycee. At the reunion dinner, Chinese people add various foods into Jiaozi fillings to represent good fortune: coins, Niangao, dried dates, candy, etc. Mandarin oranges 桔子 Júzi Oranges, particularly mandarin oranges, are a common fruit during Chinese New Year. They are particularly associated with the festival in southern China, where its name is a homophone of the word for \"luck\" in dialects such as Teochew (in which 橘, jú, and 吉, jí, are both pronounced gik).[87] Melon seed/Guazi 瓜子 Guāzi Other variations include sunflower, pumpkin and other seeds. It symbolizes fertility and having many children. Niangao 年糕 Niángāo Most popular in eastern China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai) because its pronunciation is a homophone for \"a more prosperous year (年高 lit. year high)\". Niangao is also popular in the Philippines, where there is a large Chinese population and is known as tikoy (Chinese: 甜粿, from Min Nan) there. Known as Chinese New Year pudding, niangao is made up of glutinous rice flour, wheat starch, salt, water, and sugar. The color of the sugar used determines the color of the pudding (white or brown). Noodles 面条 麵條 Miàntiáo Families may serve uncut noodles (making them as long as they can[88]), which represent longevity and long life, though this practice is not limited to the new year.

In a positive economic growth dynasty, like Song, The Five Xinpan would not only have five spicy vegetables but would also include Chinese bacon and other vegetables. Moreover, it was offered to the family's ancestors to express respect and seek a blessing.[89] Laba porridge 腊八粥 臘八粥 Làbā zhōu This dish is eaten on Laba Festival, the eighth day of the twelfth month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar.

During this period, red packets are also known as yasuiqian (壓歲錢; 压岁钱; yāsuìqián), which was evolved from a homophonous phrase yasuiqian (壓祟錢; 压祟钱; yāsuìqián), literally meaning \"money to suppress evil spirits\".[91] According to legend, a demon named Sui patted a child on the head three times on New Year's Eve, and the child would have a fever. The parents wrapped coins in red paper and placed them next to their children's pillows. When Sui came, the flash of the coin scared him away. From then on, every New Year's Eve, parents will wrap the coin in red paper to protect their children.[92]\n\nRed packets almost always contain money, usually varying from a couple of dollars to several hundred. Chinese superstitions favour amounts that begin with even numbers, such as 8 (八, pinyin: bā), a homophone for \"wealth\", and 6 (六, pinyin: liù), a homophone for \"smooth\"—but not the number 4 (四, pinyin: sì), which is a homophone of \"death\", and is, as such, considered unlucky in Asian culture. Odd numbers are also avoided, as they are associated with cash given during funerals (帛金, pinyin: báijīn).[93][94] It is also customary for bills placed inside a red envelope to be new.[95]\n\nThe act of asking for red packets (Mandarin: 討紅包; tǎo hóngbāo, Cantonese: 逗利是; dauh laih sih) wouldn't be turned down by a married person as it would mean that he or she would be \"out of luck\" in the new year. Red packets are generally given by married couples to the younger non-married members of the family.[85] It is custom and polite for children to wish elders a happy new year and a year of happiness, health and good fortune before accepting the red envelope.[85] Red envelopes are then kept under the pillow and slept on for seven nights after Chinese New Year before opening because that symbolizes good luck and fortune.\n\nIn Taiwan in the 2000s, some employers also gave red packets as a bonus to maids, nurses or domestic workers from Southeast Asian countries, although whether this is appropriate is controversial.[96][97]\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Chinese messaging apps such as WeChat popularized the distribution of red envelopes in a virtual format via mobile payments, usually within group chats.[98][99] In 2017, it was estimated that over 100 billion of these virtual red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday.[100][101]\n\nMythology\n\n[edit]\n\nIn ancient times, there was a monster named sui (祟) which comes out on New Year's Eve and touches the heads of sleeping children. The child will be frightened by the touch and wake up and have a fever. The fever eventually will cause the child to have intellectual disabilities. Hence, families will light up their homes and stay awake, leading to a tradition of shou sui (守祟), to guard against sui harming their children.\n\nA folklore tale of sui is about an elderly couple with a precious son. On the night of New Year's Eve, since they were afraid that sui would come, they took out eight pieces of copper coins to play with their son in order to keep him awake. Their son was very sleepy, however, so they let him go to sleep after placing a red paper bag containing the copper coins under the child's pillow. The two older children also stayed with him for the whole night. Suddenly, the doors and windows were blown open by a strange wind, and even the candlelight was extinguished. It turned out to be a sui. When the sui was going to reach out and touch the child's head, the pillow suddenly brightened with the golden light, and the sui was scared away, so the exorcism effect of \"red paper wrapped copper money\" spread in the past China[102] (see also Chinese numismatic charms). The money is then called ya sui qian (壓歲錢), the money to suppress sui.\n\nAnother tale is that a huge demon was terrorizing a village and there was nobody in the village who was able to defeat the demon; many warriors and statesmen had tried with no luck. A young orphan stepped in, armed with a magical sword that was inherited from his ancestors, and battled the demon, eventually killing it. Peace was finally restored to the village, and the elders all presented the brave young man with a red envelope filled with money to repay the young orphan for his courage and for ridding the village of the demon.[103]\n\nGift exchange\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to red envelopes, which are usually given from older people to younger people, small gifts (usually food or sweets) are also exchanged between friends or relatives (of different households) during Chinese New Year. Gifts are usually brought when visiting friends or relatives at their homes. Common gifts include fruits (typically oranges, but never trade pears), cakes, biscuits, chocolates, and candies. Gifts are preferred to be wrapped with red or golden paper, which symbolizes good luck.\n\nCertain items should not be given, as they are considered taboo. Taboo gifts include:[104][105][106]\n\nitems associated with funerals (i.e. handkerchiefs, towels, chrysanthemums, items coloured white and black)\n\nitems that show that time is running out (i.e. clocks and watches)\n\nsharp objects that symbolize cutting a tie (i.e. scissors and knives)\n\nitems that symbolize that you want to walk away from a relationship (examples: shoes and sandals)\n\nmirrors\n\nhomonyms for unpleasant topics (examples: \"clock\" sounds like \"the funeral ritual\" or \"the end of life\", green hats because \"wear a green hat\" sounds like \"cuckold\", \"handkerchief\" sounds like \"goodbye\", \"pear\" sounds like \"separate\", \"umbrella\" sounds like \"disperse\", and \"shoe\" sounds like a \"rough\" year)\n\nMarkets\n\n[edit]\n\nMarkets or village fairs are set up as the New Year is approaching. These usually open-air markets feature new year related products such as flowers, toys, clothing, and even fireworks and firecrackers. It is convenient for people to buy gifts for their new year visits as well as their home decorations. In some places, the practice of shopping for the perfect plum tree is not dissimilar to the Western tradition of buying a Christmas tree.\n\nFireworks\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Fireworks bans in China\n\nBamboo stems filled with gunpowder that was burnt to create small explosions were once used in ancient China to drive away evil spirits. In modern times, this method has eventually evolved into the use of firecrackers during the festive season. Firecrackers are usually strung on a long fused string so it can be hung down. Each firecracker is rolled up in red papers, as red is auspicious, with gunpowder in its core. Once ignited, the firecracker lets out a loud popping noise and, as they are usually strung together by the hundreds, the firecrackers are known for their deafening explosions that are thought to scare away evil spirits. The burning of firecrackers also signifies a joyful time of year and has become an integral aspect of Chinese New Year celebrations.[107] Since the 2000s, firecrackers have been banned in various countries and towns.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Happy New Year!\" (Chinese: 新年好呀; pinyin: Xīn Nián Hǎo Ya) is a popular children's song for the New Year holiday.[108] The melody is similar to the American folk song, Oh My Darling, Clementine. Another popular Chinese New Year song is Gong Xi Gong Xi (Chinese: 恭喜恭喜！; pinyin: Gongxi Gongxi!) .\n\nMovies\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chinese New Year film\n\nWatching Chinese New Year films is an expression of Chinese cultural identity. During the New Year holidays, the stage boss gathers the most popular actors whom from various troupes let them perform repertories from Qing dynasty. Nowadays many people celebrate the new year by watching these movies.[109]\n\nHong Kong filmmakers also release Chinese New Year films, mostly comedies, at this time of year.\n\nClothing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe color red is commonly worn throughout Chinese New Year; traditional beliefs held that red could scare away evil spirits.[85] The wearing of new clothes is another clothing custom during the festival;[110] the new clothes symbolize a new beginning in the year.[85]\n\nFamily portrait\n\n[edit]\n\nIn some places, the taking of a family portrait is an important ceremony after the relatives are gathered.[111] The photo is taken at the hall of the house or taken in front of the house. The most senior male head of the family sits in the center.\n\nSymbolism\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Fu character\n\nAs with all cultures, Chinese New Year traditions incorporate elements that are symbolic of deeper meaning. One common example of Chinese New Year symbolism is the red diamond-shaped fu characters (Chinese: 福; pinyin: fú; Cantonese Yale: fūk; lit. 'blessings', 'happiness'), which are displayed on the entrances of Chinese homes. This sign is usually seen hanging upside down, since the Chinese word for \"upside down\" (倒; dào), is homophonous or nearly homophonous with the word for \"arrive\" (到; dào) in all varieties of Chinese. Therefore, it symbolizes the arrival of luck, happiness, and prosperity. Other characters may include (壽; shòu), (萬; wàn), (寶; bǎo) or (財; cái).\n\nFor Cantonese-speaking people, if the fu sign is hung upside down, the implied dao (upside down) sounds like the Cantonese word for \"pour\", producing \"pour the luck [away]\", which would usually symbolize bad luck; this is why the fu character is not usually hung upside-down in Cantonese communities.\n\nRed is the predominant color used in New Year celebrations. Red is the emblem of joy, and this color also symbolizes virtue, truth and sincerity. On the Chinese opera stage, a painted red face usually denotes a sacred or loyal personage and sometimes a great emperor. Candies, cakes, decorations and many things associated with the New Year and its ceremonies are coloured red. The sound of the Chinese word for \"red\" (pinyin: hóng; Cantonese Yale: húng) is in Mandarin homophonous with the word for \"prosperous.\" Therefore, red is an auspicious color and has an auspicious sound. According to Chinese tradition, the year of the pig is a generally unlucky year for the public, which is why you need to reevaluate most of your decisions before you reach a conclusion. However, this only helps you get even more control over your life as you learn to stay ahead of everything by being cautious.[112]\n\nNianhua\n\n[edit]\n\nNianhua can be a form of Chinese coloured woodblock printing, for decoration during Chinese New Year.[113] Nianhua uses a range of subjects to express and invite positive prospects as the new year begins. The most popular representatives of these prospects take inspiration from nature, religion, folklore, etc., and are portrayed in flashy and lively ways.[114]\n\nFlowers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following are popular floral decorations for the New Year and are available at new year markets.\n\nFloral Decor Meaning Plum Blossom symbolizes luck Kumquat symbolizes prosperity Calamondin symbolizes luck Narcissus symbolizes prosperity Bamboo a plant used for any time of year, its sturdiness represents strength Sunflower means to have a good year Eggplant a plant to heal all of your sicknesses Chom Mon Plant a plant which gives you tranquility Orchid represents fertility and abundance, as well as good taste, beauty, luxury and innocence\n\nEach flower has a symbolic meaning, and many Chinese people believe that it may usher in the values that it represents.[115] In general, except those in lucky colour like red and yellow, chrysanthemum should not be put at home during the new year, because it is normally used for ancestral veneration.[116]\n\nIcons and ornaments\n\n[edit]\n\nIcons Meaning Illustrations Lanterns These lanterns that differ from those of Mid-Autumn Festival in general. They will be red in color and tend to be oval in shape. These are the traditional Chinese paper lanterns. Those lanterns, used on the fifteenth day of the Chinese New Year for the Lantern Festival, are bright, colorful, and in many different sizes and shapes. Decoration Decorations generally convey a New Year greeting. They are not advertisements. Faichun, also known as Huichun—Chinese calligraphy of auspicious Chinese idioms on typically red posters—are hung on doorways and walls. Other decorations include a New year picture, Chinese knots, Sycee and papercutting and couplets. Dragon dance and Lion dance Dragon and lion dances are common during Chinese New Year. It is believed that the loud beats of the drum and the deafening sounds of the cymbals together with the face of the Dragon or lion dancing aggressively can evict bad or evil spirits. Lion dances are also popular for opening of businesses in Hong Kong and Macau. Fu Lu Shou Nianhua of the Fu Lu Shou. Red envelope Typically given to children, elderly and Dragon/Lion Dance performers while saying t 恭喜發財 j gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4, s 恭喜发财 p gōng xǐ fā cái. Shrubs Citrus trees are typically used for decoration.\n\nSpring travel\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chunyun\n\nTraditionally, families gather together during the Chinese New Year. In modern China, migrant workers in China travel home to have reunion dinners with their families on Chinese New Year's Eve. Owing to a large number of interprovincial travellers, special arrangements were made by railways, buses and airlines starting from 15 days before the New Year's Day. This 40-day period is called chunyun, and is known as the world's largest annual migration.[117] More interurban trips are taken in China in this period than the total population of China.\n\nIn Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. The majority of transportation in western Taiwan is in a north–south direction: long-distance travel between urbanized north and hometowns in the rural south. Transportation in eastern Taiwan and that between Taiwan and its islands is less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and China began in 2003 as part of Three Links, mostly for \"Taiwanese businessmen\" to return to Taiwan for the new year.[118]\n\nFestivities outside China\n\n[edit]\n\nChinese New Year is also celebrated annually in many countries which houses significant Chinese populations. These include countries throughout Asia, Oceania, and North America. Sydney,[119] London,[120] and San Francisco[121] claim to host the largest New Year celebration outside of Asia and South America.\n\nEast Asia\n\n[edit]\n\nJapan\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ryukyu New Year\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n[edit]\n\nChinese New Year is a national public holiday in many Southeast Asian countries and considered to be one of the most important holidays of the year.\n\nMalaysia\n\n[edit]\n\nChinese New Year's Eve is typically a half-day holiday in Malaysia, while Chinese New Year is a two-day public holiday. George Town, a Chinese-majority city, is known for its lively Chinese New Year celebrations that last until the Lantern Festival on the fifteenth day. Kek Lok Si, the largest Buddhist temple in Southeast Asia, is typically lit up throughout the festivities.[122] Penang's Chief Minister customarily hosts an \"open house\" for the public, while various other events take place across the city, including at the Chinese clan houses and the Snake Temple.[123][124] Hokkien households celebrate the Jade Emperor's Birthday, known colloquially as the \"Hokkien New Year\", on the ninth day with offerings.[125] Traditionally during the Lantern Festival, single females throw oranges at seafront locations like the Esplanade with the hope of finding their partners.[126]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Singapore, Chinese New Year is officially a two-day public holiday. Chinese New Year is accompanied by various festive activities. One of the main highlights is the Chinatown celebrations. In 2010, this included a Festive Street Bazaar, nightly staged shows at Kreta Ayer Square and a lion dance competition.[127] The Chingay Parade also features prominently in the celebrations. It is an annual street parade in Singapore, well known for its colourful floats and wide variety of cultural performances.[128] The highlights of the Parade for 2011 include a Fire Party, multi-ethnic performances and an unprecedented travelling dance competition.[129]\n\nPhilippines\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Philippines, Chinese New Year (Philippine Hokkien Chinese: 咱人年兜; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Lán-nâng Nî-tau) is considered as one of the important festivals for Chinese Filipinos, and its celebration has also extended to the majority non-Chinese Filipinos, especially since in 2012, Chinese New Year was included as a public regular non-working holiday in the Philippines. During this time of year, the selling or giving of Tikoy, especially by Chinese Filipinos, is widely known and practised in the country. Celebrations are centered primarily in Binondo in Manila, the oldest ever Chinatown in the world, with other celebrations in key cities.\n\nIn 2024, Manila celebrates the Spring Festival of the Wooden Dragon, including the 430th anniversary of Manila Chinatown featuring the \"Manila Chinatown Solidarity Float Parade\" along Manila Central Post Office in Lawton, Ermita and Jones Bridge led by Ambassador Huang Xilian with Mr. & Ms. Chinatown Philippines 2023 winners. It was preceded by Chinese New Year's Eve, with the \"First incense offering\" at Binondo Church, a Taoism prayer ritual with Joss sticks, including Chinese ancestor worship at Martyr Saints of China altars in Binondo Chinese Parish Church. A midnight 2-minute pyro-musical fireworks was witnessed by 1.5 million at the Chinese-Filipino Friendship Bridge.[130]\n\nIn Cebu are also celebrating which a festival is called the Red Lantern Festival.[131]\n\nIndonesia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Indonesia, the Chinese New Year is officially named Tahun Baru Imlek (Chinese: 陰曆新年; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: im-le̍k sin-nî), with \"Imlek\" deriving from the Hokkien word for \"Lunar Calendar\" (Chinese: 陰曆; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: im-le̍k).[132][133] It is known locally in Hokkien as Sin Cia (Chinese: 新正; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: sin-chiaⁿ).[134] It was celebrated as one of the official national religious holiday by Chinese Indonesians since 18 June 1946 to 1 January 1953 through government regulation signed by President Sukarno on 18 June 1946.[135] It was unofficially celebrated by ethnic Chinese from 1953 to 1967 based on government regulation signed by Vice-president Muhammad Hatta on 5 February 1953 which annul the previous regulation, among others, the Chinese New Year as a national religious holiday.[136]\n\nEffectively from 6 December 1967,[137] until 1998, the spiritual practice to celebrate the Chinese New Year by Chinese families was restricted specifically only inside of the Chinese house. This restriction is made by the New Order government through a Presidential Instruction No. 14 of 1967 signed by President Suharto. This restriction is ended when the regime has changed and the President Suharto was overthrown. The celebration was conducted unofficially by Chinese community from 1999 to 2000.\n\nOn 17 January 2000, the President Abdurrahman Wahid issued Presidential Decree No. 6 of 2000 to annul the previous instruction.[138] On 19 January 2001, the Ministry of Religious Affairs issued Minsterial Decree No.13 of 2001 on Imlek Day as a National Holiday to set Hari Tahun Baru Imlek as a \"facultative holiday\" for Chinese community.[139] Through the Presidential Decree it was officially declared as a 1 (one) day public religious holiday as of 9 April 2002 by President Megawati.[133] The Indonesian government authorize only the first day of the Chinese New Year as a public religious holiday and it is specifically designated only for Chinese people.[132][133][135][136][140]\n\nIn Indonesia, the first day of the Chinese New Year is recognized as a part of the celebration of the Chinese religion and tradition of Chinese community.[132][133][135][136][139] There are no other official or unofficial of the Chinese New Year as a public holiday. The remaining 14 days are celebrated only by ethnic Chinese families.[141] In Indonesia, the Chinese Year is named as a year of Kǒngzǐ (Chinese: 孔子) or Kongzili in Indonesian. Every year, the Ministry of Religious Affairs set the specific date of religious holiday based on input from religious leaders.[141] The Chinese New Year is the only national religious holiday in Indonesia that was enacted specifically with the Presidential Decree, in this case with the Presidential Decree No. 19 of 2002 dated on 9 April 2002.[132][133] The celebration of the Chinese New Year as a religious holiday is specifically intended only for Chinese people in Indonesia (tradisi masyarakat Cina yang dirayakan secara turun temurun di berbagai wilayah di Indonesia,[133] dan umat Agama Tionghoa[135]) and it is not intended to be celebrated by native Indonesians.[132][133][135][136][137][139]\n\nCities with significant Chinese populations in Indonesia include Jakarta, Medan, Batam, Surabaya, Semarang, Surakarta, Singkawang, Pangkal Pinang, Binjai, Bagansiapiapi, Tanjungbalai, Pematangsiantar, Selat Panjang, Pekanbaru, Tanjung Pinang, Ketapang, Pontianak, Sungailiat, Tanjung Pandan, Manggar, Toboali, Muntok, Lubuk Pakam, Bandung, Rantau Prapat, Tebing Tinggi, Sibolga, Dumai, Panipahan, Bagan Batu, Tanjung Balai Karimun, Jambi, Palembang, Bengkayang, Manado, and Tangerang always have its own New Year's celebration every years with parade and fireworks. A lot shopping malls decorated its building with lantern, Chinese words and lion or dragon with red and gold as main colour. Lion dance is a common sight around Chinese houses, temples and its shophouses. Usually, the Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist Chinese will burn a big incense made by aloeswood with dragon-decorated at front of their house. The Chinese temple is open 24 hours at the first day, their also distributes a red envelopes and sometimes rice, fruits or sugar to the poor around.\n\nThailand\n\n[edit]\n\nChinese New Year festivities occur throughout the country, especially in provinces where many people of Chinese descent live such as Nakhon Sawan, Suphan Buri, and Phuket.[142][143][144]\n\nObserved by Thai Chinese and parts of the private sector, the festival is usually celebrated for three days, starting on the day before Chinese New Year's Eve. Chinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in the provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Satun[63] and Songkhla.[145] For the year 2021 (one year only) the government declared Chinese New Year a government holiday. It applied mostly to civil servants. Financial institutions and private businesses were allowed to decide whether or not to observe it.[146]\n\nDivided into 3 days, the first day is the Wan chai (Thai: วันจ่าย; pay day), meaning the day that people go out to shop for offerings, the second day is the Wan wai (Thai: วันไหว้; worship day), is a day of worshiping the gods and ancestral spirits, which is divided into three periods: dawn, late morning and afternoon, the third day is a Wan tieow (Thai: วันเที่ยว; holiday), is a holiday where everyone will leave the house to travel or to bless relatives or respectable people, often wearing red clothes which is believed to bring auspiciousness to life.[147]\n\nIn the capital Bangkok, there are large celebrations in Chinatown, Yaowarat Road, where the main road is closed and turns into a pedestrian street, with a member of royal family in attendance each year to open the ceremony, such as Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.[148][149][150]\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nWith one of the largest Chinese populations outside of Asia, Sydney also claims to have the largest Chinese New Year Celebrations outside of Asia with over 600,000 people attending the celebrations in Chinatown annually. The events there span over three weeks including the launch celebration, outdoor markets, evening street food stalls, Chinese top opera performances, dragon boat races, a film festival and multiple parades that incorporate Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese people. More than 100,000 people attend notably the main parade with over 3,500 performers.[151] The festival also attracts international media coverage, reaching millions of viewers in Asia.[152] The festival in Sydney is organized in partnership with a different Chinese province each year. Apart from Sydney, other state capital cities in Australia also celebrate Chinese New Year due to large number of Chinese residents.[153] The cities include: Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne Box Hill and Perth. The common activities are lion dance, dragon dance, New Year market, and food festival. In the Melbourne suburb of Footscray, Victoria a Lunar New Year celebration initially focusing on the Vietnamese New Year has expanded into a celebration of the Chinese New Year as well as the April New Year celebrations of the Thais, Cambodians, Laotians and other Asian Australian communities who celebrate the New Year in either January/February or April.[154]\n\nThe city of Wellington hosts a two-day weekend festival for Chinese New Year,[155] and a one-day festival is held in Dunedin, centred on the city's Chinese gardens.[156]\n\nNorth America\n\n[edit]\n\nMany cities in North America sponsor official parades for the Chinese New Year. Among the cities with such parades are New York City (Manhattan; Flushing, Queens; and Brooklyn),[157] San Francisco,[158] Los Angeles,[159] Boston,[160] Chicago,[161] Mexico City,[162] Toronto, and Vancouver.[163] However, even smaller cities that are historically connected to Chinese immigration, such as Butte, Montana,[164] have recently hosted parades.\n\nNew York\n\n[edit]\n\nNew York City\n\n[edit]\n\nMultiple groups in New York City cooperate to sponsor a week-long Chinese New Year celebration. The festivities include cultural festival,[157] music concert,[165] fireworks on the Hudson River near the Chinese Consulate,[166] and special exhibits.[165] One of the key celebrations is the Chinese New Year parade[167] with floats and fireworks taking place along the streets in Chinatown, Manhattan, the largest Chinese New Year parade outside Asia.[168] In June 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the Lunar New Year would be made a public school holiday,[169] in September 2023, New York State made Lunar New Year a mandatory public school holiday.[170]\n\nCalifornia\n\n[edit]\n\nSigned into law in 2022, and effective 2023, California declared Lunar New Year a state government holiday.[171] Many communities throughout all of California celebrate with large celebrations taking place in both the Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles as well as in Fresno, Sacramento, San Diego, Santa Rosa, and Stockton.\n\nSan Francisco\n\n[edit]\n\nThe San Francisco Chinese New Year Festival and Parade is the oldest and one of the largest events of its kind outside of Asia, and one of the largest Asian cultural events in North America.\n\nThe festival incorporates Grant and Kearny Streets into its street festival and parade route, respectively. The use of these streets traces its lineage back to early parades beginning the custom in San Francisco. In 1849, with the discovery of gold and the ensuing California Gold Rush, over 50,000 people had come to San Francisco to seek their fortune or just a better way of life. Among those were many Chinese, who had come to work in the gold mines and on the railroad. By the 1860s, the residents of San Francisco's Chinatown were eager to share their culture with their fellow San Francisco residents who may have been unfamiliar with (or hostile towards) it. The organizers chose to showcase their culture by using a favourite American tradition – the parade. They invited a variety of other groups from the city to participate, and they marched down what today are Grant Avenue and Kearny Street carrying colourful flags, banners, lanterns, drums, and firecrackers to drive away evil spirits.\n\nIn San Francisco, over 100 units participate in the annual Chinese New Year Parade held since 1958.[172] The parade is attended by some 500,000 people along with another 3 million TV viewers.[173]\n\nGreater Los Angeles\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Golden Dragon Parade has happened annually in Chinatown Los Angeles since 1899, one of the oldest and largest Chinese New Year parades outside of Asia. Beginning in the 1970s, famous Asian American actors have held the title of Grand Marshall of the parade, the first being Bruce Lee.[174]\n\nAround Southern California many communities also put on festivals and parades that can last multiple days, with some of the largest occurring in the San Gabriel Valley, home to the largest Chinese community outside of Asia and often called the first suburban Chinatown, and Little Saigon where many Vietnamese and Chinese live. Monterey Park puts on the largest of such festivals, occupying 5 blocks in the city and attracting over 100,000 individuals.[175] Neighboring Alhambra also has hosted a large festival since 1993 with many performances and street vendors.[176] San Gabriel hosts an annual Chinese Gala at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse in addition to its street festival.[177]\n\nThe Little Saigon area has hosted Tet celebrates since 1982 for its Chinese and Vietnamese community.[178] Originally held at Garden Grove Park, with parades in both Garden Grove and Westminster, starting in 2014 a larger celebration is also held at the Orange County Fair and Events Center in Costa Mesa which attracts over 50,000 visitors.[178] Neighboring Fountain Valley also hosts an annual Chinese New Year carnival in Mile Square Regional Park with many food vendors and a ferris wheel.[179]\n\nMany people also celebrate by going to temples across Southern California, and the largest temple celebration is held at Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights.[180] Most major shopping malls will also decorate for Chinese New Year.[181]\n\nDisneyland California Adventure in Anaheim celebrates Chinese New Year by decorating certain areas of the park in Chinese displays, serving speciality East Asian foods and allowing for character photos with Mulan, Mushu, Raya, Tigger and Mickey and Minnie Mouse in Chinese Costumes.[182]\n\nSome other communities that hold Chinese New Year Celebrations include Eastvale, Hollywood, Irvine, Palos Verdes, Pasadena, Rancho Cucamonga, Riverside, Rosemead, San Marino, San Pedro, Santa Monica, Temple City, Tustin, and West Covina.\n\nEurope\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn London, celebrations take place in Chinatown, Leicester Square, and Trafalgar Square. Festivities include a parade, cultural feast, fireworks, concerts, and performances.[183] The celebration attracts between 300,000 and 500,000 people yearly according to the organisers.[184]\n\nFrance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Paris, celebrations have been held since the 1980s in several districts during one month with many performances[185] and the main of the three parades with 40 groups and 4,000 performers is attended alone by more than 200,000 people in the 13th arrondissement.[186][187]\n\nNetherlands\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial celebrations were held in The Hague,[188][189] Amsterdam, and Rotterdam.[190][191]\n\nHungary\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Budapest, celebrations have been held since 2017 in Kőbánya district with many performances and parades.[192]\n\nIndia and Pakistan\n\n[edit]\n\nMany celebrate the festival in Chinatown, Kolkata, India, where a significant community of people of Chinese origin exists. In Kolkata, Chinese New Year is celebrated with lion and dragon dance.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Chinese New Year is also celebrated among the sizeable Chinese expatriate community that lives in the country. During the festival, the Chinese embassy in Islamabad arranges various cultural events in which Pakistani arts and cultural organizations and members of the civil society also participate.[193][194][195][196]\n\nMauritius\n\n[edit]\n\nChinese culture in Mauritius is an important component of the multiculturalism in Mauritius.[197] Despite the small size of the Sino-Mauritian community (estimated to be only about 3% of the total population),[198] Chinese New Year (also known as Chinese Spring Festival) is a time where Chinese culture is celebrated on the island[199] and is a public holiday in Mauritius.[200] Mauritius is also the only country in Africa which lists the Chinese Spring Festival as a statutory public holiday.[197] During this period of the year, there is a joyful and festive atmosphere throughout the entire country.[197]\n\nSino-Mauritians are very attached to Chinese traditions.[201] The Chinese Spring Festival is the biggest celebration for the Sino-Mauritians on the island.[201] The dates of the celebration follows the Chinese lunisolar calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar.[201] During the week prior to the New Year's Day, spring cleaning in homes is performed.The festival starts on Chinese New Year's Eve by lighting on firecrackers to ward off evil spirits.[202]: 71 Traditionalist visit pagodas to offer offerings and prayers on the New Year's Eve.[202]: 71 Following Chinese customs, there is a big family dinner on the New Year's Eve.[201][203] While the family dinner was traditionally celebrated at the house of the oldest family parents, going to restaurants for New Year's Eve is getting more popular; some restaurants may also have special dinners across the island to foster the family reunions of Sino-Mauritians.[201] After the New year's Eve dinner, youths often go to nightclubs.[201] On the day of the Chinese New Year, it is customary for Sino-Mauritian to share niangao to their relatives and friends and to light firecrackers to ward off evil spirits.[200][201] Red envelopes are also given. Some families would also visit pagoda on New Year to honour their ancestors.[201] Some families observe a vegetarian diet on the New Year.[203] The main celebration events typically take place in the Chinatown area in Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius.[200][204] The Dragon dance and the Southern Lion dance is also customary on that day.[201][203] The colour red is predominantly used to decorate the streets and houses. Chinese items (e.g. Chinese lanterns) are also used as decorations.[204]\n\nGreetings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Chinese New Year is often accompanied by loud, enthusiastic greetings, often referred to as 吉祥話 (jíxiánghuà) in Mandarin or 吉利說話 (Kat Lei Seut Wa) in Cantonese, loosely translated as auspicious words or phrases. New Year couplets printed in gold letters on bright red paper, referred to as chunlian (春聯) or fai chun (揮春), is another way of expressing auspicious new year wishes. They probably predate the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), but did not become widespread until then. Today, they are ubiquitous with Chinese New Year.\n\nSome of the most common greetings include:\n\nXin nian kuai le / San nin fai lok: simplified Chinese: 新年快乐; traditional Chinese: 新年快樂; pinyin: Xīnniánkuàilè; Jyutping: san1 nin4 faai3 lok6; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Sin-nî khòai-lo̍k; Hakka: Sin Ngen Kai Lok; Taishanese: Slin Nen Fai Lok. A more contemporary greeting reflective of Western influences, it literally translates from the greeting \"Happy new year\" more common in the west. It is written in English as \"xin nian kuai le\".[206] In northern parts of China, traditionally people say simplified Chinese: 过年好; traditional Chinese: 過年好; pinyin: Guònián Hǎo instead of simplified Chinese: 新年快乐; traditional Chinese: 新年快樂 (Xīnniánkuàile), to differentiate it from the international new year. And 過年好 (Guònián Hǎo) can be used from the first day to the fifth day of Chinese New Year. However, 過年好 (Guònián Hǎo) is considered very short and therefore somewhat discourteous.\n\nGong xi fa cai / Gong hei fat choi: simplified Chinese: 恭喜发财; traditional Chinese: 恭喜發財; pinyin: Gōngxǐfācái; Hokkien: Kiong hee huat chai (POJ: Kiong-hí hoat-châi); Cantonese: Gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4; Hakka: Gung hee fatt choi, which loosely translates to \"Congratulations and be prosperous\". It is spelled varyingly in English, such as \"Gung hay fat choy\",[207] \"gong hey fat choi\",[206] or \"Kung Hei Fat Choy\".[208] It is often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with \"Happy New Year\". The saying is now commonly heard in English speaking communities for greetings during Chinese New Year in parts of the world where there is a sizeable Chinese-speaking community, including overseas Chinese communities that have been resident for several generations, relatively recent immigrants from Greater China, and those who are transit migrants (particularly students).\n\nNumerous other greetings exist, some of which may be exclaimed out loud to no one in particular in specific situations. For example, as breaking objects during the new year is considered inauspicious, one may then say 歲歲平安 (Suìsuì-píng'ān) immediately, which means \"everlasting peace year after year\". Suì (歲), meaning \"age\" is homophonous with 碎 (suì) (meaning \"shatter\"), in the demonstration of the Chinese love for wordplay in auspicious phrases. Similarly, 年年有餘 (niánnián yǒu yú), a wish for surpluses and bountiful harvests every year, plays on the word yú that can also refer to 魚 (yú meaning fish), making it a catch phrase for fish-based Chinese new year dishes and for paintings or graphics of fish that are hung on walls or presented as gifts.\n\nThe most common auspicious greetings and sayings consist of four characters, such as the following:\n\n金玉滿堂, Jīnyùmǎntáng – \"May your wealth [gold and jade] come to fill a hall\"\n\n大展鴻圖, Dàzhǎnhóngtú – \"May you realize your ambitions\"\n\n迎春接福, Yíngchúnjiēfú – \"Greet the New Year and encounter happiness\"\n\n萬事如意, Wànshìrúyì – \"May all your wishes be fulfilled\"\n\n吉慶有餘, Jíqìngyǒuyú – \"May your happiness be without limit\"\n\n竹報平安, Zhúbàopíng'ān – \"May you hear [in a letter] that all is well\"\n\n一本萬利, Yīběnwànlì – \"May a small investment bring ten-thousandfold profits\"\n\n福壽雙全, Fúshòushuāngquán – \"May your happiness and longevity be complete\"\n\n招財進寶, Zhāocáijìnbǎo – \"When wealth is acquired, precious objects follow\"\n\nThese greetings or phrases may also be used just before children receive their red packets, when gifts are exchanged, when visiting temples, or even when tossing the shredded ingredients of yusheng particularly popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Children and their parents can also pray in the temple, in hopes of getting good blessings for the new year to come.\n\nChildren and teenagers sometimes jokingly use the phrase \"恭喜發財，紅包拿來\" (pinyin: gōngxǐfācái, hóngbāo nálái; Cantonese: 恭喜發財,利是逗來; Jyutping: gung1hei2 faat3coi4, lei6 si6 dau6 loi4), roughly translated as \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!\". In Hakka the saying is more commonly said as 'Gung hee fatt choi, hung bao diu loi' which would be written as 恭喜發財，紅包逗來 – a mixture of the Cantonese and Mandarin variants of the saying.\n\nBack in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say 恭喜發財，利是逗來，斗零唔愛 (Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was recorded in the pop song Kowloon Hong Kong by Reynettes in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong used the saying: 恭喜發財，利是逗來，伍毫嫌少，壹蚊唔愛, roughly translated as, \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is too little, don't want a dollar either.\" It basically meant that they disliked small change – coins which were called \"hard substance\" (Cantonese: 硬嘢). Instead, they wanted \"soft substance\" (Cantonese: 軟嘢), which was either a ten dollar or a twenty dollar note.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nOther celebrations of Lunar New Year in China:\n\nTibetan New Year (Losar)\n\nMongolian New Year (Tsagaan Sar)\n\nCelebrations of Lunar New Year in other parts of Asia:\n\nBuryat New Year (Sagaalgan)\n\nKorean New Year (Seollal)\n\nJapanese New Year (Shōgatsu)\n\nMongolian New Year (Tsagaan Sar)\n\nVietnamese New Year (Tết Nguyên Đán)\n\nSimilar Asian Lunisolar New Year celebrations that occur in April:\n\nBurmese New Year (Thingyan)\n\nCambodian New Year (Chaul Chnam Thmey)\n\nLao New Year (Pii Mai)\n\nSri Lankan New Year (Aluth Avuruddu)\n\nThai New Year (Songkran)\n\nChinese New Year Gregorian Holiday in Malaysia\n\nMalaysia Chinese New Year (Tahun Baru Cina)\n\nIndonesian Chinese New Year (Imlek)\n\nLunar New Year fireworks display in Hong Kong\n\nThe Birthday of Che Kung\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nWelch, Patricia Bjaaland (1997).
