        "text": "The 2024 CCTV Spring Festival Gala has concluded its fifth and final rehearsal on Wednesday. The much-anticipated annual gala is now ready to present a visual and auditory feast for audiences nationwide on Friday.\n\nIt has been revealed that individuals from many diverse backgrounds, such as noodle-pulling masters, technicians, police officers and athletes, will participate in the opening short film of the gala, titled 'Our Spring Festival Gala'.\n\nThe main venue is located in Beijing, and this year's Spring Festival Gala will set up branch venues in four locations, namely, Shenyang in Liaoning province, Changsha in Hunan province, Xi'an city in Shaanxi province, and Kashgar prefecture in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.\n\nThis marks the first time the gala has established a branch venue in Xinjiang, with Kashgar in the southwestern part of the region being the chosen location.\n\nKashgar, with its extensive history, diverse culture and distinct ethnic features, stands as a quintessential representation of Xinjiang.\n\nIt holds the well-deserved reputation of \"If you haven't been to Kashgar, you haven't truly experienced Xinjiang\".\n\nIts expansive territory is characterized by breathtaking landscapes, encompassing oases, deserts, poplar forests, glaciers and snow-capped mountains, offering a plethora of rich and varied tourist attractions."
