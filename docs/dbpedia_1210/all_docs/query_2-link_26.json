        "text": "Writer Jingyang Chen compares the content, viewership and revenue model of the two largest television shows in China and the U.S.: the Spring Festival Gala and the Super Bowl.\n\nThe most watched television shows in the U.S. and China aired during similar times this year. The content of the broadcast, however, could not be more black and white. While the U.S. advertising frenzy heightened as the Super Bowl drew closer, China Central Television (CCTV) announced that their Spring Festival Gala would contain no commercial advertisements.\n\nAccording to CCTV, since launching the “Zero Commercial Spring Festival Gala” project three years ago, at least 1.75 billion Yuan ($280 million U.S.) in potential advertising revenue has been lost as unlike the Super Bowl, this four hour live TV gala has no reserved time slots for commercials. Businesses and brands can only be recognized through sponsorships, product placements or hosts’ speeches, thereby severely limiting advertising creativity. This restriction is a government effort in regulating content and limiting the commercialization of a Chinese tradition.\n\nSouth Korean rapper Psy’s first mainland appearance at CCTV’s Spring Gala Festival.

Advertising slots for CBS sold for approximately $3.8 million this year for 30 seconds. Rather than offering quotes for the gala’s advertising, CCTV holds a bid for the spot. The bid held in 2010 raised 650 million Yuan ($104 million U.S.) and in 2011, the bids for the New Year’s Eve count down cost approximately 50 million Yuan for 10 seconds. Broken down, the cost for airing a 30 second advertisement during the gala would equal to roughly $24 million dollars. In 2010 Midea Group, a leading home appliance manufacturing and export company in China won the bid to sponsor the countdown.\n\nThis year, the gala aired a non-commercial advertisement titled “Going Home: The Delayed New Year Dress.” After the New Year’s Eve countdown, this non commercial advertisement was broadcasted to emphasize Chinese moral values and the traditions of family reunions. This marks the first time that the gala aired non-commercial advertisements in its 31 year history.\n\nHa Wen, wife of CCTV host Li Yong mentioned to Advertising Age that, “the cost of the gala is paid for with CCTV funds, not with advertising revenue. The gala is not a commercial performance.”\n\n“This year the gala is much better without the massive commercials and product placements,” said Yexian An, a 25-year-old female magazine editor in China. “I can’t tolerate the gala being frequently intruded by advertisements, especially the ones that aren’t relevant to me at all, such as white wine.” Yexian has been watching the gala for 20 years. She recalled that, “the drastic advertising years were from 2001 to 2005.”\n\nLocal residents watching CCTV.

This means that about 100 million Americans watch the Super Bowl annually while about 400 million Chinese watch the gala.\n\nSource: China Census Bureau\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau"
