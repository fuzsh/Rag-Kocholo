        "text": "This year is the 33rd year that China Central Television (CCTV) will broadcast its Lunar New Year's Eve TV gala.\n\nJust like lanterns, fireworks and dumplings, the Spring Festival TV gala has become an indispensable part of celebrations during China's most important holiday.\n\nThe gala, which usually includes songs, traditional opera performances, comedians, talk shows, acrobatics and martial art, is loved by people from all walks of life.\n\nThe program attracts the largest audience of any Chinese show and has the potential to make performers household names overnight.\n\nHowever, in today's day and age, the gala has to compete for its audience's attention with the Internet and mobile messaging apps.\n\nIt is predicted that Wechat, the multi million user mobile messaging app, will be the busiest smartphone app during this year's Spring Festival, distributing billions of greetings and virtual \"hongbao\" (red envelopes containing a cash gift).\n\nDespite this, the Spring Festival TV gala has not lost it appeal.\n\nYoung urban Chinese may be distracted by their online lives but they won't fail to watch some of the TV gala to catch performances by some of China's most popular artists.\n\nIts history runs almost in parallel with the reform and opening-up drive, and it can be seen to reflect the changes in China's political, economic and social landscape.\n\nKnown for its high production standards, the gala's programs deal with topics close to the people, and are a way to review the past year.\n\nChina is now the world's second largest economy. With improved living standards, people value their families more. Sitting down to watch the TV gala has, in fact, become a traditional family institution."
