        "text": "2024 Chinese New Year date: Feb. 10th, Saturday, Year of the Dragon\n\nChinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, is the grandest festival in China, usually with a 7-8 days' holiday. As the most colorful annual event, the traditional CNY celebration lasts longer, up to two weeks, and the climax arrives around the Lunar New Year's Eve.\n\nChina during this period is dominated by iconic red lanterns, loud fireworks, massive banquets and parades, and the festival even triggers exuberant celebrations across the globe.\n\nIn China, an old saying goes 'Food is the first important thing for people' while a modern saying '3 pounds' weight gain atevery festival.' Both show the Chinese people's love of food. There probably are no other people quite like the Chinese who are so passionate and fastidious about cooking. Besides basic requirements of appearance, smell, and taste, they insist on creating festival foods bearing auspicious meanings and bring good luck.\n\n– Southmost Hainan: 17 ~ 25°C; long-sleeve T-shirt or thin coat\n\n– Southern areas like Guangdong, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Yunnan: 5 ~ 15°C; sweater + jacket or trench coat\n\n– South and east areas including Shanghai & Hangzhou: 2 ~ 10°C; sweater + light down jacket\n\n– Central China including Xi’an & Chengdu: -3 ~ 8 °C; sweater + thick down jacket\n\n– North destinations around Beijing: -10 ~ 5°C; wool sweater + thick parka or down coat\n\n– Northeast cities like Harbin: -30 ~ -10°C; as thick as possible"
