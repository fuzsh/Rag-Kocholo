        "text": "The Lunar New Year is undoubtedly the most important festival for China’s 1.4 billion people. Although the celebrations vary from place to place, people from almost every corner of the country, as well as many Chinese people overseas, spend the evening watching Chunwan, the Spring Festival Gala produced by China Central Television (CCTV, CMG). It is one of the premier television events on China’s entertainment calendar.\n\nFor many Chinese, the term Spring Festival Gala creates a magical feeling. It triggers nostalgic memories of when family members gathered around their TV sets with snacks, ready to catch every moment of the spectacular performances on Chinese New Year’s Eve.\n\nThe tradition began in 1983 when the first annual Chinese New Year Celebration Evening Gala was held. The show featured song-and-dance performances by artists selected from around the country. Audiences could even phone in to request their favourite song. And every year since then at the turn of the Chinese New Year, the program has begun at 8pm, lasting until the early morning of the New Year.\n\nIn 1984, comedy sketches and skits were added to the line-up, becoming a key part of the gala. The performances usually resonate with the most topical issues in people's work and life over the past year, such as family and school life, with audiences finding it both amusing and inspiring. With a mix of comedy acts, songs and dance, acrobatic and magic, the Spring Festival Gala represents the highest level of entertainment by top-notch performers, who are selected through many rounds of auditions.\n\nBefore and after the Spring Festival Gala every year, all kinds of discussions about the program become a trending cultural event. The gala has sent several artists into stardom in the past few decades, and many have come back for repeat appearances once they have become household names.\n\nIn 1999, the Gala was broadcast online for the first time. From the television era to the digital age, people’s expectations always run high for the annual event. But with so many viewing options vying for our attention, getting audiences interested in the four-hour show is no easy task.\n\nIn recent years, the Gala has tried to re-establish itself with some fresh elements, such as incorporating new visualisation technology and creating interactive experiences for the audience. AI+VR naked eye 3D technology starts to appear on the stage of the Spring Festival Gala, and through special shooting methods and production means, it brings a breakthrough experience for those watching it on TV or their mobile devices.\n\nTo attract more young viewers, the producers of the gala are also welcoming fresh new faces. One of the examples is Luo Tianyi, a virtual pop star popular with Chinese youth who made her debut at the 2020 Spring Festival Gala. Created by digital technology, Luo was dressed in a modernised version of traditional Chinese clothing and performed a song-and-dance segment for children.\n\nDuring last year’s gala, the creative show “Ox Strut” saw Chinese pop star Andy Lau dancing with multiple virtual robotic oxen virtually along with singers in the Beijing studio. And martial arts performance “Heroes of Heaven and Earth“ wowed the audience by placing a natural landscape as a background through AR technology. The 2021 edition also marks the stage choreography of the gala presented in 8K Ultra HD video for the first time.\n\nAs technology advances, the stage expands as well. In recent years, segments of the show have been performed in and broadcast from sub-venues scattered around the country. The show is a great opportunity to understand what people's experiences in China in the past year, and its evolution is in many ways representative of China’s wider technological growth and social development.\n\nNow almost four decades since its inception, Chunwan has grown into something more than just a television show. It represents a nationally shared experience, a collective memory. About 30 or 40 years from now, it may look completely different from what we’re experiencing today. But one thing’s for sure: as long as the festival continues, the show goes on."
