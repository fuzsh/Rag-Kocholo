He was also invited to the gala’s final rehearsal.\n\n“I met many children who were waiting to give the performance just now, and I sent some of my toys to them, who are really lovely.

I will tell kids the story about it, and encourage them to be courageous and brave to face difficulties,” Yu said.\n\nThe audience will enjoy the immersive audiovisual pleasure on nearly 1,000 outdoors ultra-high-definition large public screens in more than 100 cities across China and about 3,000 public screens in 70 cities of 34 countries around the world.\n\nHeld annually on Chinese New Year’s Eve since 1983, the show is the most-watched annual television broadcast in the world."
