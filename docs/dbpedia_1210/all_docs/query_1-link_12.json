        "text": "The highly anticipated spectacular for the Chinese New Year, the 2022 Spring Festival Gala, began broadcasting live from the No. 1 Studio in China Media Group's (CMG) headquarters on Fuxing Road in Beijing, at 8:00 p.m. Beijing time on Monday.\n\nSa Beining, Neghmet Raxman, Ren Luyu, Li Sisi and Ma Fanshu are hosting the grand event.\n\nThe Spring Festival Gala is a symbolic part of the national celebrations, and has been a must-watch program for Chinese people all over the world since it was first held in 1983. The five-hour-long extravaganza features songs and a multitude of performances aimed at entertaining millions of Chinese families at New Year.\n\nThis year's Spring Festival Gala features major themes such as the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC), rural revitalization, ecological civilization, the Winter Olympic Games and China's space achievements.\n\nA number of integrated and innovative programs are particularly eye-catching in this year's Spring Festival Gala.\n\nThe poetic dance, “The Painting Journey – The Legend of a Panorama of Mountains and Rivers.”/CMG\n\nFirst of all, the actors brought wonderful musical skits to the audience in a program presented by the China Puppet Art Theater and the Guangdong Puppet Art Theater, with singers including Sha Baoliang and Wang Li.\n\nSurprisingly, in this short puppet play with the theme of man and nature, we can see the figures of elephants that have frequently appeared on hot searches this year, reminiscent of the recent elephant migration story. The dance drama also vividly shows the migratory route of elephants and people's concern for the whereabouts of the animals as well as the harmonious relationship between man and nature.\n\nThe poetic dance, \"The Painting Journey – The Legend of a Panorama of Mountains and Rivers,\" highlights the aesthetics of traditional Chinese painting, is the latest creation by Han Zhen and Zhou Liya, the joint directors and choreographers of the popular dance drama \"The Eternal Wave.\"\n\nUnlike Han and Zhou's previous works, \"The Painting Journey,\" doesn't have a strong storyline, but showcases Chinese traditional culture in a poetic and respectful way.\n\nThe painting, \"A Panorama of Rivers and Mountains,\" is the only extant work by Song Dynasty (960-1279) painter Wang Ximeng (1096-1119) who created it at the age of 17.\n\nThe poetic dance, “The Painting Journey – The Legend of a Panorama of Mountains and Rivers.” /CMG\n\nThe 900-year-old masterpiece is stunning in its sweeping scale, rich coloration and the expressive minute details. On a single piece of silk, mountain formations and groupings of infinite variety rise and fall between a cloudless sky and rippling waters, extending as far as the eye can see in all directions.\n\nThe painting is a representative of \"blue-green landscape.\" Azurite blue and malachite green dominate, with touches of pale brown.\n\nHan and Zhou had thorough communication with experts and researchers at Beijing's Palace Museum when choreographing the work. One researcher even inspired them to set a character as a guide in the dance.\n\nWhen unfolding the painting inch by inch, the researcher travels back in time to watch the process the ancient painter used to painstakingly create the work, decoding the secrets behind its inherent uniqueness.\n\nAudiences follow the researcher to explore the legendary world of traditional Chinese art.\n\nThen, a wonderful tai chi performance brought the audience the enjoyment of flowing water. Tai chi is an ancient Chinese tradition that, today, is practiced as a graceful form of exercise. It involves a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner and accompanied by deep breathing.\n\nThe show used video to combine tai chi performances with China's urban landscape, providing viewers with an immersive visual experience combining modernity and tradition."
