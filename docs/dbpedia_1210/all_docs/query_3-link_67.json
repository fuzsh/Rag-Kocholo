The most important Chinese holiday is the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival), which is also celebrated in Korea, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. All traditional holidays are scheduled according to the Chinese calendar (except the Qing Ming and Winter Solstice days, falling on the respective Gregorian calendar). (wikipedia)\n\nIf you are interested in Chinese culture & traditions then it goes without saying that you should spend a little time getting to grasp with the major holidays. There are 8 major Chinese holidays, namely 除夕, 春节, 元宵节, 清明节, 端午节, 中元节, 中秋节, 冬节 that you can’t go wrong with. Do you know them all?\n\n1. 除夕Chúxì\n\nChinese New Years Eve\n\nThe Chinese New Year’s Eve is called 除夕and is the most anticipated night during this period. On this night Chinese families 欢聚一堂 (gather happily under one roof) to 庆祝 (celebrate). Each household celebrates by eating a 年夜饭 (New Year’s Eve dinner). When the meal is over the whole family will sit, chat and play games until midnight when they will 守岁 (stay up to see in the new year).\n\nIn recent years however, watching 春节联欢晚会 (Spring Festival Gala) has become a new tradition. The Spring Festival Gala is a 4 hour-long program shown on China’s CCTV, it includes an assortment of performances such as singing, dancing and 相声 (Comic dialogue, crosstalk).\n\n2. 春节 Chūnjié ( between 21st Jan and 20th Feb)\n\nSpring Festival\n\nLearn Chinese Festivals and Holidays - Spring festival春节 (Spring Festival) is the longest and most 隆重 (ceremonious) holiday for the 中华民族 (Chinese people).

Activities include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning items for the visiting spirits of the ancestors.\n\n7. 中秋节 Zhōngqiū jié(15th of the 8th lunar month)\n\nMid-Autumn Festival\n\nAlso known as “Moon Festival”, Mid-Autumn festival is a harvest festival that falls on the 15th day of the 8th month according to the Chinese lunar calendar. The Mid-Autumn festival was so named because of the fact that it is always celebrated in the middle of autumn season, a time when the moon is at its fullest and brightest.\n\nA popular tradition of Mid-Autumn Festival is to eat 月饼 (mooncakes), thus you may also hear this festival referred to as “Mooncake Festival”.\n\n8. 冬节 Dōng jié\n\nWinter Solstice\n\nThis is another important traditional Chinese festival, it falls between 22nd of December and the 5th of January. Chinese people managed to figure out the Winter solstice using ancient equipment over 2500 years ago during the Spring-Autumn period (770-476 BC).\n\nWinter solstice marks the shortest day and the longest night of the year. It is traditional for people to eat 饺子 and 汤圆 during this period, while we will be looking forward to a nice roast turkey.\n\nSource - luvlanguages.com"
