        "text": "This year's Spring Festival Gala, an annual celebration produced and broadcast by China Media Group (CMG), unfolded on the eve of the Chinese New Year on Friday evening. This occasion signifies a cherished time when Chinese people around the world gather with their families to welcome the Chinese New Year.\n\nAs China's most-watched TV program, the gala has been an annual tradition since its first broadcast in 1983. This year, the gala's live broadcast set new records for both the number of viewers and total views. As of midnight on February 9, it had drawn 679 million viewers, with the total number of views reaching 1.501 billion, marking a 12.69 percent increase from last year.\n\nThe vertical format of the gala for mobile viewing attracted 420 million views, up 57.58 percent on last year. Additionally, social media discussions around the gala surged to 16.052 billion, nearly 60 percent higher than the previous year.\n\nThis year, the gala showcased a mix of performances, from music, comedy and traditional arts like opera and martial arts to spectacular acts such as magic and acrobatics. It also incorporated cutting-edge technologies like extended reality (XR) and immersive stage interaction technologies to enhance the viewing experience.\n\nAmong the standout performances, the creative New Year customs program featured the richness and diversity of Chinese culinary culture, suggesting an abundant harvest in the Year of the Dragon. The China drum dance emerged as another vibrant highlight, with dancers in traditional attire energizing the stage with rhythmic drum beats. The choreography, a dynamic blend of precision and spontaneity, brought the ancient art form to life in a contemporary celebration.\n\nContinuing this theme of innovation, the show \"New Year Brocade\" creatively combined music with advanced virtual synthesis technology. It transformed representative symbols from ancient China into a mesmerizing display, staging an \"ancient fashion show\" where characters seemed to emerge directly from paintings. By intertwining traditional and modern elements, it breathed new life into cultural motifs that have endured for millennia, dazzling the audience with a showcase of Oriental aesthetics.\n\nIn celebrating the Year of the Dragon, CGTN launched the Loong Year Loong Dance challenge on January 8, reaching out to audiences across social media platforms worldwide. As dance knows no national boundaries, this challenge invites a global audience to connect with the culture and festive spirit of the Spring Festival, creating a bridge between diverse communities through the universal language of dance moves. It has drawn participants from 68 countries and regions, with a global reading volume of over 589 million.\n\nOverseas engagement of the gala hit new heights this year, with content being read over 649 million times globally and videos garnering 210 million views. CGTN has broadcast the gala globally across its English, Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian language channels, as well as on new media platforms available in 68 languages, partnering with over 2,100 media outlets in 200 countries and regions.\n\nReflecting this worldwide appeal, over 3,000 public screens in 90 cities on six continents broadcast the Spring Festival Gala live, enabling people around the world to experience the unique charm of the Chinese Spring Festival and Chinese culture, all while enjoying songs and laughter on this joyous occasion.\n\nClick here to watch the CGTN Super Night 2024 live broadcast."
