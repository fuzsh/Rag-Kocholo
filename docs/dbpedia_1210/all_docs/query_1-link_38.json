        "text": "HONG KONG – Nearly a year after Titanic 3D’s runaway box office success in China, the country’s vast audiences will be treated to Celine Dion’s performance of the film’s well-known theme song on China Central Television’s annual New Year’s Gala show on Saturday night.\n\nThe Canadian singer’s appearance on the national broadcast, which will be shown on CCTV’s main terrestrial channel and most of its satellite portals, could be considered a landmark for Western pop music, given the gala’s officially-sanctioned pedigree and its large audience base.\n\nPHOTOS: Super Bowl 2013: Beyonce Sings (Live!) and Reunites With Destiny’s Child for Halftime Show\n\nThe show, which begins at 9pm on Saturday and will run well into the Chinese New Year’s Day on Sunday, is expected to be seen by hundreds of millions of viewers in China and among the global Chinese diaspora, and is widely considered the most watched television program in the world today.\n\nIn an official announcement on the show’s Weibo account (the Chinese version of Twitter), Dion is assigned the tenth slot in the program, in which she will perform the Chinese-language song Jasmine Flower with Song Zuying, a regular on the annual show and one of the country’s most well-known folk music icons.\n\nSTORY: China’s State-Run CCTV Records 11 Percent Gain in Ad Commitments for 2013\n\nThe Canadian singer will then perform My Love Will Go On, a song which will resonate with the scores of viewers who flocked to see James Cameron’s 3D update of Titanic last year. The film took 977 million yuan (US$156.5) during its Chinese run last spring, and was close to becoming the year’s highest-grossing release before homespun comedy Lost In Thailand topped the number by accumulating earnings of 993 million yuan during the last week of the year."
