        "text": "The 2024 Met Gala, held on the first Monday in May, has officially ended. The 2024 Costume Institute exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, titled “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” will feature approximately 250 items drawn from the Costume Institute’s permanent collection, many of which have rarely been seen in public before. Now that the hotly anticipated event has come and gone, Vogue is rounding up everything you need to know about the event.\n\nBelow, everything you need to know about the 2024 Met Gala, which happened last night.\n\nWhen will the Met Gala 2024 take place?\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala took place last night, on Monday, May 6, in New York City at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. It celebrated the Costume Institute’s new exhibition, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.”\n\nHow can I rewatch the Met Gala 2024?\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala Red Carpet has ended, but if you missed it, you can rewatch the 2024 Met Gala live stream’s red carpet arrivals right here, on Vogue.com, as well as across our digital platforms.\n\nActor Gwendoline Christie, producer and actor La La Anthony, and model Ashley Graham co-hosted the carpet in 2024. Emma Chamberlain also returned as Vogue’s special correspondent to interview some of the biggest stars at the gala.\n\nThe Vogue team also shared their thoughts and reactions to the red carpet in the 2024 Met Gala live blog, providing context for all the best looks.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala 2024 theme?\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala celebrated the Costume Institute’s new exhibition, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” and the official dress code was “The Garden of Time.” The exhibit will feature approximately 250 rare items drawn from the Costume Institute’s permanent collection. Spanning over 400 years of fashion history, the pieces will include designs by Schiaparelli, Dior, Givenchy, and more. Some garments that are too fragile to ever be worn again—such as a Charles Frederick Worth ball gown from 1877—will also be displayed via video animation, light projection, AI, CGI, and other forms of sensory stimulation.\n\nAndrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute, added that the exhibition will be shaped around three main “zones”—Land, Sea, and Sky—that pay tribute to the natural world. “It is very much an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion,” he said.\n\nWho is hosting the Met Gala 2024?\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala hosts were Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth. They followed last year’s star studded group: Penélope Cruz, Michaela Coel, Roger Federer, Dua Lipa, and Vogue’s Anna Wintour. The latter has run the Met Gala since 1995, shaping it into the much-loved annual celebration of fashion we know today.\n\nWhat is the dress code?\n\nThis year’s 2024 Met Gala dress code was “The Garden of Time.” Inspired by J.G. Ballard's short story of the same title, written in 1962, it was interpreted in a myriad of ways. We certainly saw many a floral and botanical looks grace the famed Met Gala red carpet.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is a charity event and fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. It has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition. Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala?\n\nIn short: It’s a secret. For this reason, guests must abide by the no-phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy. However, you can see exclusive photos from inside the 2024 Met Gala here and catch a glimpse of the table settings, menu, and decor. Kendall Jenner also gave us a behind- the-scenes look at the Met Gala through her camera in 2021. The event usually involves a high-profile performer (see the 2024 Met Gala performers here). And guests always explore the exhibition before sitting down together for dinner.\n\nWhere is the Met Gala held?\n\nThe Met Gala takes place at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City on the first Monday in May each year (with the exception of the 2021 event, which took place in September due to COVID-19 restrictions). Guests attending the Met Gala typically stay in hotels nearby, congregating at a few celebrity-favorite spots. Last year, the Mark Hotel was a prime location for celebrity-spotting; see our photos from inside its halls.\n\nWho is invited to the Met Gala?\n\nUntil the evening before the event, the guest list is top secret. But some of the biggest names in the business regularly attend—from Beyoncé and Gigi Hadid to Madonna and Rihanna. More often than not, designers attend with their muses: think Marc Jacobs and Kate Moss, or Nicolas Ghesquière and Emma Stone. See everything that goes into the Met Gala seating chart here.\n\nWho attends the Met Gala?\n\nThe event usually hosts around 450 attendees, welcoming stars, young creatives, and industry paragons each year. Revisit some of the best looks from long-time attendees such as Blake Lively, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rihanna, and more of the best Met Gala looks of all time.\n\nWhat if I want more…."
