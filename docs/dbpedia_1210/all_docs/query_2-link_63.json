        "text": "History of Chinese Spring Festival\n\nThe Chinese Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, is usually celebrated by the Chinese community in Mauritius following the traditional Chinese lunar calendar. The exact date of the festival on the Gregorian calendar widely used today is typically around January or February.\n\nIt is believed that the modern Chinese Spring Festival is a continuation of an ancient Chinese autumn tradition. Before the new year celebration started, the ancient Chinese would gather to celebrate the end of the autumn harvest. During this period, people would clean millet-stack sites, toast guests with traditional Chinese red wine or mijiu, slaughter lambs, and go to their masters’ homes to toast to them and cheer the prospect of living a long life together.\n\nOn the eve of modern Chinese New Year celebrations, as in old times, families would come together for a special reunion dinner with dishes on the menu having idiomatic and specific meanings.\n\nWhen the new year finally came, people would typically light fireworks at the entrance of their homes to ward off bad luck. In Mauritius, despite the Mauritian Chinese community being relatively small, the Spring Festival is a national public holiday making it the only country outside Asia to celebrate Chinese New Year with a public holiday.\n\nThe main celebration of the new year takes place in the Chinatown area of Port Louis, with typically colorful parades of traditional New Year celebration costumes like the dancing dragon complete with energetic dance performances and fireworks."
