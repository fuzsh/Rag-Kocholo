        "text": "According to West China Metropolitan News (华西都市报), a Chengdu-based newspaper, Lin Miaoke, the lip-syncing girl in the Olympic opening ceremony, was deprived of her chance to perform on CCTV New Year’s Gala or chunwan, a TV program hosted by China’s main television broadcaster, reaching hundreds of millions Chinese families on each and every eve of the Spring Festival, China’s lunar new year.\n\nThe New Year’s Gala, aside from the nostalgia and joy it brings to the audience, can also serve as a generator of national pride. In 2008 and 2004, the program peaked with China’s Shenzhou astronauts coming out to meet the audience when the new year bell rang. And Beijing Olympics will be, without doubt, another big boost to the national pride of the people, and it wouldn’t surprise us at all should the show feature some Olympic gold medalists this year.\n\nA staff worker in CCTV’s chunwan crew told the paper that the Spring Festival Gala this year will do no lip-syncing during its 5-hour broadcasting, and Lin Miaoke’s appearance would presumably bring questions to the show. Lin, who was reportedly confirmed in for the gala was actually let down by SARFT, who ordered in last month that there should be no lip-syncing performance in the show.\n\nRelated Reads:\n\nThe Guardian: China bans lip-synching from its biggest TV show\n\nBeijing Daily: SARFT Ordered No Lip-syncing in Spring Festival Gala (Chinese)\n\nPhoto: Miaokefans\n\nUpdate: Chinese men’s gymnastic team confirmed that they will join CCTV’s Spring Festival Gala this year.\n\n–-"
