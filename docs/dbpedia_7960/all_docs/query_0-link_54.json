        "text": "Playboy architect Donald (William Holden) and his roguish neighbour David (David Niven) both attempt to pursue aspiring actress Patty (Maggie McNamara), but find that she’s a lot more headstrong than they thought, in Otto Preminger’s romantic comedy based on F Hugh Herbert’s play.\n\nThis caused a huge scandal when it was released, with the controversial subject matter resulting in the all powerful Production Code refusing to pass it. Unperturbed, Preminger and the producers just released it anyway without a seal of approval, taking various theatre chains who refused to screen the film to court and getting them to show it.\n\nIn the process, it became a huge hit, significantly weakening the Code’s influence and opening the doors for allowing more…\n\nI'm someone who likes filmed plays that take place in NYC. Why? I have no idea. I just find them to be terribly compelling. \"The Moon Is Blue\" is just this.\n\nThe film is a romantic comedy about virginity, making it scandalous for its time. It begins with a young lamb (Maggie McNamara) being chased to the top of the Empire State Building by a hungry wolf (William Holden). What the wolf encounters is a very bold lamb who challenges him with his own thoughts. That's funny and entertaining enough, but a drunken David Niven eventually invites himself and his libido to the picture, creating even more humorous situations.\n\nHolden and Niven are on top of their games in this…\n\nFirst, the good stuff: the actors are fine. Maggie McNamara and MVP David Niven lay on the charm and float above the material. As for William Holden, his convertible coffee/dinner table is fantastic.\n\nAs for the rest: it’s telling when the most talked about aspect of a sex comedy isn’t its contents, but its place in film history as one of the early chippers at the Hay Code. The Moon is Blue is the safest kind of “scandalous” movie, one that talks about sex in comparatively straightforward manner, within the most conservative set of values. Its the worst kind of puritanism disguised as sophistication. McNamara's Patty barely has any traits that aren't Perfect '50s Wife material (attractive, young, a virgin…\n\nThough the Hollywood production code censored many of the best, or potentially best films of all time in the name of \"morality\", there were a select few films including From Here to Eternity and Some Like it Hot that slowly ate away at the old code until its abolishment in the mid 60s. One of the earlier films to do so was 1954's The Moon is Blue, a radical sex comedy that pushed the production code to the limit.\n\nBased on a play by the same name and plot, The Moon is Blue stars William Holden as Don't Greshem, a newly single architect who because enamored with a young woman Patty O'Neill(Maggie McNamara). However when Don brings her back to…\n\nThis film, produced and directed by Otto Preminger, is a fascinating example of a 1950s sex comedy but it is now very dated and it is hard to fathom the ruckus it caused with the MPAA/PCA. The screenplay, adapted from his play of the same name by F. Hugh Herbert, was rejected by MPAA censor Joseph Breen because of its “light and gay treatment of the subject of illicit sex and seduction”, back in the days when “gay” meant “lighthearted and carefree”. After six months of back and forward correspondence and rewrites, Preminger and Herbert, backed by United Artists’ studio heads, advised Breen that they were going to proceed to make the film without any changes.\n\nAs well as a…\n\nThere is an episode of M*A*S*H where Hawkeye and BJ are determined to secure a print of The Moon Is Blue to view at the 4077th simply because it was banned in Boston. I don’t know about Boston, but in real life the Production Code office refused to give it a seal and the Legion of Decency gave it a C rating (condemned).\n\nAs Hawkeye and BJ learned to their chagrin, being banned in Boston does not make for either a prurient or a good movie. As I learned, being denied a seal and condemned does not make it a prurient or good movie either.\n\nPatty (Maggie McNamara) and Don (William Holden) pick each other up at the Empire State…"
