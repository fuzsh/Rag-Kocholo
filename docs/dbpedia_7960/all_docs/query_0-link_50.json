        "text": "Although conventions vary from one country to another, the script usually develops over a number of distinct stages, from a synopsis of the original idea, through a “treatment” that contains an outline and considerably more detail, to a shooting script. Although the terms are used ambiguously, script and screenplay usually refer to the dialogue and the annotations necessary to understand the action; a script reads much like other printed forms of dramatic literature, while a “shooting script” or “scenario” more often includes not only all of the dialogue but also extensive technical details regarding the setting, the camera work, and other factors. Moreover, a shooting script may have the scenes arranged in the order in which they will be shot, a radically different arrangement from that of the film itself, since, for economy, all the scenes involving the same actors and sets are ordinarily shot at the same time.\n\nGenerally, more elaborate productions require more elaborate shooting scripts, while more personal films may be made without any form of written script. The script’s importance can also vary greatly depending on the director. Griffith and other early directors, for example, often worked virtually without a script, while directors such as Hitchcock planned the script thoroughly and designed pictorial outlines, or storyboards, depicting specific scenes or shots before shooting any film.\n\nSome scripts are subsequently modified into novels and distributed in book form, such as The Dark Knight (2008) by Dennis O’Neil. In the instance of Dylan Thomas’s The Doctor and the Devils (1953), a script became a literary work without ever having been made into a motion picture.\n\nAdaptation from other art forms to motion pictures must take into account differences of complexity and scale in film. A film often must omit characters and incidents in the novel from which it is adapted, for example, and the pace usually must be accelerated. Ordinarily, only a fraction of a novel’s dialogue can be included. In an adaptation of a play, the curtailment is less severe, but much dialogue still must be cut or expressed visually.\n\nWell over half of all fiction films made during the 20th century after 1920 were adapted from plays or novels, and it is understandable that certain formulas came to be tacitly accepted to facilitate the remaking of literature into moving pictures. Adaptation has been thought of as an aesthetically inferior exercise, because most such films merely illustrate the classics or reshape a literary text until it conforms to standard cinematic practice. The particular qualities that made the original interesting are often lost in such a process. Certain films and filmmakers, however, have achieved an aesthetic premium by accepting the literariness of the original and then confronting this with the technology and methods of the cinema (The French Lieutenant’s Woman, 1981; Adaptation, 2002; Carol, 2015). Numerous directors have explored literature in an almost documentary manner. The artifice of the French director Eric Rohmer’s Die Marquise von O. (1976), for example, aptly expresses the literary sensibility of Heinrich von Kleist’s romantic, ironic work. On the other hand, less-adventurous big-budget adaptations reshape the literary works on which they are based into conventional “Hollywood” movies, as some critics complained about Sydney Pollack’s Out of Africa (1985). The delicate and changing sensibility of the main character, evident in the prose of the original, was not reflected in the film’s traditional, albeit grand, presentation.\n\nAlthough many eminent literary authors, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner, have worked on film scripts, the ability to write a good original script, especially under strict studio conditions, frequently belongs to lesser-known scenarists with a strong visual sense. Some writers, particularly in France, have tried to narrow the gap between the written and cinematic modes of expression. Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet became representative of a new kind of author able and willing to “write” directly on film. Both directed their own films, which they considered as equivalent to their novels and plays.\n\nFilm acting\n\nOf all the artists involved in movies, the actors and actresses are closest to the audience. The public more often goes to see a motion picture for its stars than for any other single reason. The divergent techniques of stage and film acting are well understood, and there are many leading players who excel in both. But the greatest film stars typically have a talent peculiar to the screen alone. This talent often seems to be related not to how well they act but to the sort of person they appear to be.\n\nFilm acting requires restraint. “Don’t act, think” was the advice of the eminent German director F.W. Murnau. While stage actors may be praised for a performance that is highly wrought, film stars usually must appear to be themselves. Close-ups accentuate the more intimate relationship the actor can establish with a film audience, an audience that has often followed the actual life of certain actors whom the industry promotes as “stars.” The German theorist Walter Benjamin argued that the image of the star compensated the film audience for the loss of direct access to live performance. For this reason film actors from movie to movie are likely to be cast in similar roles, as the case of John Wayne makes clear.\n\nSome actors, however, deliberately try to avoid being typecast. Robert De Niro, for example, was well known for the violent, obsessive characters he played in such films as Taxi Driver (1976) and Raging Bull, but he was equally effective in quieter, more controlled roles, such as the charismatic hero in The Deer Hunter (1977) or the sneaky political consultant in Wag the Dog (1997). In his films, De Niro downplayed his own personality to “become” the characters he portrayed, even transforming himself physically by gaining excessive weight for his role in Raging Bull. Actors who have been strongly identified with one role have found it harder to change their image. Sean Connery, for example, appeared in more than 40 films, playing such diverse characters as an eccentric poet in A Fine Madness (1966), an Arab chieftain in The Wind and the Lion (1975), a medieval monk in The Name of the Rose (1986), and a Prohibition-era Chicago policeman in The Untouchables (1987), but he was most identified with the sophisticated British secret agent James Bond, whom he played in seven films.\n\nA film performance can be synthesized bit by bit, by the joint efforts of the actor, the director, the cameraman, and others. The conditions of film production, however, are such that some actors find them trying. They may have to put up with long hours on the set and endless repetition; they must adapt to shooting scenes out of sequence; and in close-ups they often have to respond to the camera rather than to another actor. They require a talent different from, but equal to, that of theatrical performers.\n\nThroughout the history of the art, acting styles have frequently led to major revolutions in film style. Most of the shifts in acting have been toward what is deemed a more “realistic” approach. Often this realism is the result of the studied application of acting precepts, as when Marlon Brando brought to On the Waterfront (1954) the lessons he had digested at the Actors Studio (the professional workshop in New York City). In the 1960s several successful Czechoslovak films featured effective performances by what appeared to be average citizens, but in truth the players’ long silences, their bumbling, and the foibles that seemed so natural were the result of lifelong practice and endless rehearsals. Some films, however, have exploited the documentary power of the medium to reveal the behaviour of untrained but expressive individuals. Many of the masterpieces of the postwar Italian Neorealist movement relied on absolute amateurs, who were frequently picked up off the streets by the casting director\n\nSide by side with the never-ending quest for naturalness in acting, an opposite impulse has brought to the screen both stylized and histrionic performances of great power. Cinematic Expressionism (largely identified with German films from the 1920s but also evident in Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible) depends on contorted bodily and facial gestures, which are amplified by decor and camera angle. Eminent actors, including Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, have shown that some types of films thrive on expansive theatrical voicing and gesture.\n\nComedy requires other considerations. The impassive visages of the silent star Buster Keaton and the French comic Jacques Tati helped transform their bodies into expressive machines that interacted with the greater machine of the films they starred in. The Marx Brothers, on the other hand, depended on loose cinematic construction and dialogue and on zany spontaneous action. In short, there can be no single theory of film acting."
