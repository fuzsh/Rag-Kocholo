        "text": "When the delicate alchemy\n\nat the core of Alan Rudolph's aesthetic is off, as in Trixie and Breakfast Of\n\nChampions, the\n\nresults can be downright embarrassing. So it isn't exactly encouraging that the\n\ncult auteur's Investigating Sex was filmed in 2001 but is only now receiving a\n\ndiscreet direct-to-DVD burial under the moniker Intimate Affairs. While every bit as\n\nleering, the blandified new title more closely evokes the tawdry fare that runs\n\nat 3 a.m. on Cinemax and showcases the formidable talents of Shannons Tweed or\n\nWhirry.\n\nIf a film lingers too long\n\non the shelf, a top-flight cast stops being a badge of honor and becomes\n\nsuspect. The thinking inevitably goes from \"Wow, that project must be great to\n\nattract such an esteemed cast\" to \"Wow, that project must suck if even that cast can't secure it so\n\nmuch as a token theatrical release.\" So it's a mixed blessing that Rudolph's\n\nfilm combines the talents of Nick Nolte, Terrence Howard, Julie Delpy, Jeremy\n\nDavies, Dermot Mulroney, Neve Campbell, Robin\n\nTunney, Alan Cumming, and even a rare appearance by Tuesday Weld. Rudolph's\n\nperiod romance suggests Kinsey re-imagined as a goofy sex comedy. Mulroney stars as a brooding young academic in '20s\n\nParis intent on delivering a detached, rational, intellectual study of male sexuality,\n\nfunded by raffish stock-market speculator Nick Nolte. The presence of a pair of\n\nsexy stenographers (uninhibited Robin Tunney and repressed Neve Campbell)\n\nproves a wild card that makes the ridiculous farce of separating sex from love\n\nand arousal from emotion seem like even more of a quixotic notion.\n\nWith great films like Choose\n\nMe and Trouble\n\nIn Mind,\n\nRudolph long ago solidified his status as one of film's most incurable\n\nromantics, so it should surprise no one that he's made a film about sex that's\n\nreally all about love. A cockeyed romanticism pervades the film as its brainy\n\nneurotics pair off with each other and resolve various love triangles. It's a\n\ntrifle that traffics more in nervous, abashed chuckles than belly laughs, but\n\nRudolph's ebullience and his amazingly game cast keep it afloat. In large part\n\nbecause the circumstances of its DVD release engender such low expectations,\n\nRudolph's featherweight, briskly amusing little sleeper can't help but qualify\n\nas a pleasant surprise."
