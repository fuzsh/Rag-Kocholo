        "text": "Introduction and Credits A Biography on Pink Paper Defining LGBTQIA+ Identity in the Early Twentieth Century Lavender Ink: Introduction to Writing and Publishing Queer Literature Indecent Behavior: Sexuality, Gender, and Transgression Digital Collection\n\nLavender Ink: Introduction to Writing and Publishing Queer Literature\n\nWhat makes literature \"queer?\" Did Truman Capote write queerness into the frozen Kansas veldt in the pages of In Cold Blood by simple merit of his personal life? How do Claude McKay's alligator pears and ginger roots in The Tropics of New York offer a lens for queer literary scholars to apply a queer-of-color analysis? What about people like Radclyffe Hall whose depictions of queer characters aged poorly and even drew ire in the author's time for unflattering depictions that may play into social stereotypes?\n\nTo say we must approach that question gingerly would be an understatement. The lives and works of queer authors did not always yield unambiguous depictions of queer people in their literature. Similarly, laws about what could and could not be published and which people could and could not form romantic and sexual relationships made the process of writing queerness even thornier.\n\nWhile queer theory as a lens through which one can read literature gained in popularity after the late 20th century, literature scholars have not yet reached a consensus on what counts as queer literature or even who counts as a queer author. In this category, we navigate that difficult path while leaning in on that ambiguity and highlighting artifacts that demonstrate how enormously difficult and delicate this type of work can be for literary scholars and historians alike.\n\nThe intimate politics of interpersonal relationships gave control of estates to people like Una Troubridge, who outlived her partner and wanted to present a posthumous version of the woman she loved as she saw her to the world. That meant deliberate erasure of people and events that represented painful parts of her relationship with Hall. Herself no stranger to publication, Troubridge represents what many queer biographers with extreme personal interest in those about whom they wrote navigate: telling a queer story to a world that would likely be unsympathetic and not fully understand the relationships described.\n\nOf course, other intersecting factors of race and income already presented barriers to queer authors of color and those without wealth. For them, the act of writing queerness proved even riskier. However, that did not stop them from alluding to their relationships in their personal and public writings. Their own struggles to advocate for their work is significant, as are the ways in which they had to navigate factors such as racism and classism in the publishing world that White, wealthy writers did not.\n\nFor educators and students alike, these artifacts offer us the chance to examine and question the world of queer authors and the compounding factors we must consider as contemporary readers of their work.\n\nDefining queer literature and aethetics\n\nAs with much of literary analysis, questions about queer readings of texts are diverse and nuanced. While queer literature has existed as long as we have had literature, methods of evaluating the \"queerness\" of a text began to especially grow in an American context in the 1970s. Even then, the work of queer scholars from that point to the present day has drastically evolved as public understandings of gender and sexuality shift and fluctuate. This section invites students to form their own hypotheses of how they would determine queer themes in a text and provide a \"queer reading.\" That does not mean all of these texts had openly queer authors or subject matter. However, considering that obscenity laws and social conservatism required authors to craft queer themes in their books with some degree of discretion, many literary studies practitioners maintain openmindedness and creativity when looking for queer subject matter. Other identities overlap as well in such readings. Queer-of-color critiques might center Black, Indigenous, and other persons of color queer narratives in their methods. Queer Crip scholars might look at how sexuality, gender, and disability overlap. Eco-Queer scholars might look at the environmental world and queerness in works of film and literature. As such, it can be a fun and exciting opportunity for those new to queer scholarship to think about what aspects of queer identity in literature interest them. This section is designed to give space to such thought and provide an introduction to the nuances of queer scholarship.\n\nPublishing while Queer\n\nTo say that the path towards publishing The Well of Loneliness was difficult would be an understatement. In addition to questions of obscenity and legal challenges against its content matter, Hall experienced extreme frustration that the question of the book's merit came down to \"free speech\" rather than Hall's skills as an author and what Hall believed to be the text's obvious literary merit. Hall was certainly not alone in that regard. Queer authors who published queer content prior to shifts in public culture and opinion in the late 20th century did so at extreme personal risk. While audience mattered and more progressive genres such as poetry and theatre offered queer authors slightly more overtness in content, the task of creating queer literature for broad public consumption was difficult and fraught. Many queer authors who published books and plays with unambiguous queer content did so anonymously. Others sought to incorporate queerness through symbolism and codes that queer readers might understand but that non-queer people might not. Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, while not overtly queer at surface level, relies heavily on the question of \"double identities.\" Amy Lowell's poetry regularly used flower imagery to symbolize queer sex and intimacy between women. Mary Shelley's monster in Frankenstein (adapted for film by openly gay director James Whale) is given life through collaboration between men, sidestepping heterosexual reproduction. Others simply complied with social expectations for how queerness might be best received by the reading public. For example, cultural norms (such as the Motion Picture Production Code of 1934-1968) didn't explicitly ban queer characters and content, but did dictate that queer characters must be punished and not rewarded with a happy ending. Lillian Hellman's 1934 play The Children's Hour ends in a death by suicide, as does the queer husband of Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's 1947 Broadway play A Streetcar Named Desire. However, queerness became a less taboo topic for authors with the shifts of the 1950s and 1960s such as the publication of the Kinsey Studies in 1948 and 1953, Betty Friedan's 1963 The Feminine Mystique, and queer uprisings at The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in 1969, at Compton's Cafeteria in San Francisco in 1966, and at Cooper's Donuts in Los Angeles in 1959. However, that does not mean decades of European and North American morality culture disappeared overnight. This section places Hall's own challenges with publishing as a queer person in broader context with other authors throughout the early to mid twentieth century. Teachers might use this space to talk about symbolic readings of queerness, the importance of a \"happy ending\" for queer characters, and thorny questions about artistic integrity and cultural challenges to publishing queer works.\n\nQueer Women and Ambiguous Sexualities\n\nFor many women who did not marry or lived lives outside of cultural expectations for women, questions about their sexuality persist. Pre-20th-century gender expectations in North America and Europe largely dictated separate spaces based on gender binaries. Doubtlessly, many women leave behind legacies of homosocial bonding in schools, seminaries, and social circles. Eleanor Roosevelt and Juliette Gordon Low both wrote about their \"crushes\" at their respective early-twentieth-century schools, and their papers still hold much important content for bisexual and lesbian scholars. Many queer women navigated space for themselves within these spheres, forming close friendships and sometimes sexual and romantic relationships with other women. That is not to say that all women authors who have lived and died without conclusively self-identifying as heterosexual would do so if given the chance. Many were queer, and it certainly does not make their work off limits for queer literary scholars. For example, while Harper Lee never conclusively addressed her sexuality and bristled when asked about it, her 1960 novel To Kill a Mockingbird is a popular text for queer analysis, with Scout's and Dill's ambivalent relationship with gender conventions continuing to produce rich discourse within literary scholarship.\n\nFor the purposes of Hall and Troubridge, sexuality in their time was largely defined based on the works of Sigmund Freud. Later twentieth-century authors and painters such as poet June Jordan, novelist Octavia Butler, and painters Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo, and Georgia O'Keeffe would deliberately seek to reimagine cis-women and women's sexuality outside of a male-dominated Freudian discourse. For her part, Hall deeply believed in scientific innovations. However, her social circle and contemporary authors included many people who guarded their sexuality with fierce privacy, or at least never commented on their romantic connections in writing. Teachers might use this section to frame the inevitable question of whether how much we do or don't know about an author's personal life should influence how we read their work. Furthermore, a feminist inquiry into this section might question how transgressing gender expectations fits into a queer framework and why centering the relationships between women in literature remains a powerful and important thing. For students this might provide a spring-board to think about how much or how little an author's sexuality, gender identity, or other identity marks should play in how we read and understand texts, particularly when those personal questions don't necessarily have clear answers. Furthermore, how do we examine literature through a \"queer\" lens when it comes to analyzing love and same-gender affection in texts that might have had different understandings of sexuality than contemporary culture?\n\nBi and Ace Erasure\n\nQueer historians and literary scholars have deliberately and systematically erased the bisexual identities of countless authors. A great many bisexual authors had deep, fulfilling relationships with people of a range of genders. For Una Troubridge, while her relationship with Radclyffe Hall dominated her life, she still expressed at least some romantic and sexual attraction to men. However, there is also a problem of categorization. Certainly plenty of people married and entered relationships with people of other genders despite a lack of romantic or sexual attraction due to social pressures or needing some protection from legal consequences of non-conformity when it came to gender presentation and sexuality.\n\nSimilarly, many asexual and aromantic authors, artists, and thinkers lived deep, rich, emotionally-fulfilling lives without feeling the need for sexual or romantic partners. Both acephobia and biphobia, cultural allegiance to monosexuality (attraction to one gender), and trans-erasing insistence on gender binaries have deep and problematic roots in even lesbian and gay-specific spaces and scholarship.\n\nFor educators, these documents offer a chance to think critically about bisexual and asexual identities and how their relationships with people of different genders have been minimized or erased or mischaracterized. For students, these documents offer a chance to \"dig in\" to complicated questions about gender and sexuality as a spectrum that is not always easily defined by simple categories. For everyone, it highlights and celebrates the bi identities of different authors whose writings offer a rich trove of resources for bisexual/pansexual and asexual scholarship.\n\nStory Telling: The Role of Partners and the Ghosts of Authors\n\nWhile not every queer author wrote about death, death proved just as complex and uniquely challenging for them as life did. Laws and norms that did not legally recognize same-gender partners as legal heirs made inheritance and creative control difficult to navigate. Similarly, defining legacies and the need to protect the privacy of living partners duplicated the need for discretion for authors who passed away.\n\nFor contemporary queer authors, the HIV/AIDS crisis casts a long shadow. With many queer people dying at alarming rates from AIDS-related illnesses, many same-gender partners and transgender partners who lived with them for years suddenly found themselves with little legal right to shared property and in many cases were not allowed to visit their loved ones in hospitals in their final days.\n\nThe more painful aspects of personal life and the difficulties of any partnership also influenced the role that surviving partners and estates played in organizing and publishing posthumous works of authors. This subcategory examines what role partners play in posthumous guardianship of their partners' estate, papers, and reputation. Here we examine how Troubridge, like many others publishing biographies of authors and seeking to control the narrative of their deceased loved ones, omitted facts and deliberately destroyed letters that reminded her of painful parts of her marriage to Sir Ernest Charles Thomas Troubridge, and of her partnership with Radclyffe Hall. However, the material records of that writing process also served as a testament to the deep belief many partners held about the greatness of their deceased loved ones. Similarly, this category also examines the role that the queer rights and women's rights movements played in critical re-evaluation of authors who died prior to those political movements in the late 20th century.\n\nHow did feminist politics and queer liberation impact the work of dead authors? How do their surviving partners fit into their narratives not just as executors of estates, but also of authorship and publication? How do queer archivists position partners as equals in relationships instead of falling into sexist, partiarchal tropes that relegate spouses to \"supporting\" roles or shadows in the background?"
