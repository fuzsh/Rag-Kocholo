        "text": "From the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of Iran's prime minister in 1953, to tension and confrontation under President Trump, a look back over more than 65 years of tricky relations between Iran and the US.\n\nThe US-backed Shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, is forced to leave the country , externalon 16 January following months of demonstrations and strikes against his rule by secular and religious opponents.\n\nTwo weeks later, Islamic religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile. Following a referendum, the Islamic Republic of Iran is proclaimed on 1 April.\n\nThe US embassy in Tehran is seized by protesters in November 1979 and American hostages are held inside for 444 days. The final 52 hostages are freed in January 1981, external, the day of US President Ronald Reagan's inauguration.\n\nAnother six Americans who had escaped the embassy are smuggled out of Iran by a team posing as film-makers, in events dramatised in the 2012 Oscar-winning film Argo.\n\nThe US secretly ships weapons to Iran, allegedly in exchange for Tehran's help in freeing US hostages held by Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.\n\nThe profits are illegally channelled to rebels in Nicaragua, creating a political crisis for Reagan.\n\nThe American warship USS Vincennes shoots down an Iran Air fligh, externalt in the Gulf on 3 July, killing all 290 people on board. The US says the Airbus A300 was mistaken for a fighter jet.\n\nMost of the victims are Iranian pilgrims on their way to Mecca.\n\nIn 2002 an Iranian opposition group reveals that Iran is developing nuclear facilities including a uranium enrichment plant.\n\nThe US accuses Iran of a clandestine nuclear weapons programme, which Iran denies. A decade of diplomatic activity and intermittent Iranian engagement with the UN's nuclear watchdog follows.\n\nBut several rounds of sanctions are imposed by the UN, the US and the EU against ultra-conservative president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government. This causes Iran's currency to lose two-thirds of its value in two years.\n\nIn September 2013, a month after Iran's new moderate president Hassan Rouhani takes office, he and US President Barack Obama speak by phone - the first such top-level conversation in more than 30 years.\n\nThen in 2015, after a flurry of diplomatic activity, Iran agrees a long-term deal on its nuclear programme with a group of world powers known as the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany.\n\nUnder the accord, Iran agrees to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\n\nOn 3 January 2020, Iran's top military commander, Gen Qasem Soleimani, is killed by a US drone strike in Iraq. Iran vows \"severe revenge\" for his death and pulls back from the 2015 nuclear accord."
