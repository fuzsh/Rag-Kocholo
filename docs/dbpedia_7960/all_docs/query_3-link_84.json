        "text": "Sofia Coppola’s highly anticipated Priscilla Presley biopic Priscilla is finally here. In contrast to the glitz and glamour of Baz Luhrmann’s 2022 Elvis, this film offers a quieter, more sympathetic look at the girl who married the King of Rock N’ Roll. Luhrmann’s film, which was given Priscilla Presley’s stamp of approval, didn’t include a whole lot of nuance surrounding her experience. No hate, the movie was already three hours long. This time around, audiences are getting a grittier, more revealing look at the woman in Elvis’ shadow, prompting such valid questions as, “Wait, she was how old?”\n\nAllow us to soothe the burning (love). Here is everything you need to know about Elvis and Priscilla Presley’s relationship. Trigger warning: babies having babies.\n\nTo begin, here is a crash course in Elvistory. Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis Presley rose to prominence as a musical icon in the 1950s. He was considered highly provocative and a bit controversial in his early years for his performance style that today would be considered PG to a Harry Styles audience. One of the best selling musicians of all time, Presley sold more than 500 million records throughout his career. He is remembered not only for his musical style, but for his relationship with his wife, Priscilla Presley. Let’s talk about it.\n\nHow Did Elvis Meet Priscilla?\n\nIn the greatest PR move of all time, Elvis Presley was drafted into the military in 1958 at the height of his fame. The star had broken the brains of mothers and religious leaders across the globe with his sinister gyrations, and upon being offered the priority comforts of Special Service, he agreed to serve as any other soldier would, stating \"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\"\n\nIn September 1958, Elvis was sent to serve in West Germany. While stationed in Bad Nauheim in 1959, he met a 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu, the step-daughter of a U.S. Air Force Captain, at a party at his house. He was 24 years old at the time.\n\nFrom there, the pair began what would become a 13 year relationship. Priscilla maintains things never became sexual until their wedding night, when she was 21 and he was 32. Elvis was sent back to the U.S. in 1960, and the couple maintained their relationship at a distance until the summer of 1962 when Priscilla visited Elvis in America.\n\nBy 1963, Priscilla had convinced her parents to let her move to Memphis full-time. She moved in with Elvis’ parents and enrolled in an all-girls Catholic school. Over time, she slowly moved her belongings into Graceland until she was living with the star in his humble abode.\n\nWhen Did The Pair Marry?\n\nElvis proposed to Priscilla in December 1996 with a fat ring—we’re talking 3.5 carats and 20 removable diamonds, just for fun. She was 20 years old at the time.\n\nIn May 1967, Elvis and Priscilla married in Las Vegas at the Aladdin Resort & Casino, followed by a press conference. Celebrities, they’re just like us. Elvis arrived at the wedding on Frank Sinatra’s private jet, and the pair married in front of 14 people.\n\nIn February 1968, the couple welcomed their only child, Lisa Marie Presley. A few months before her birth, the pair considered a trial separation, their marriage affected by the stress of an unexpected pregnancy and rumors of an affair between Elvis and Nancy Sinatra. That private jet isn’t looking so pretty now, huh?\n\nWhen Did The Pair Split?\n\nElvis and Priscilla initially split in February 1972, following a string of rumored infidelities on both sides and a full-blown affair between Priscilla and her karate instructor, Mike Stone. The pair were officially divorced on August 15, 1972, but remained close until Elvis’ death.\n\nHow Old Was Priscilla When Elvis Died?\n\nOn August 16, 1972, Elvis Presley died of hypertensive heart disease, exacerbated by years of opioid abuse. The degree to which the drugs contributed to his death are debated, but posthumous lab reports show significant amounts of drugs in Presley’s system at the time of his death. He had a heart problem and he had a drug problem, and ultimately he died of both.\n\nFollowing the death of Elvis Presley, Priscilla Presley never remarried. She remained in a relationship with Mike Stone until 1975, and went on to date Terry O’Neill, Robert Kardashian, Michael Edwards, and Marco Antonio Garcia, in addition to other minor flings. In March 1987, Presley gave birth to her second child Navarone Garibaldi, whom she shares with Garcia.\n\nFollowing the passing of Elvis Presley, his only daughter, Lisa Marie, was named the sole beneficiary of his massive estate. In 1982, the family announced that Elvis’ beloved Graceland would become a public museum, which continues to stand as a popular U.S. landmark.\n\nLisa Marie Presley passed away in January 2023 at the age of 54 of cardiac arrest. Today, the Presley family legacy lives on not only through Priscilla, but through her grandchildren, including actress Riley Keough."
