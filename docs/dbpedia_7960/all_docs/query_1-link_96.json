        "text": "\"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.\" For the past year or so, when I've been giving readings, I've asked the people in the audience if they know or remember LP Hartley's 1953 novel, The Go-Between. Generally there's a single yes or a couple of yeses; otherwise silence, a shaking of heads. Then I'll say the first half of its first line and the audience will come back loud and strong on their own with the second half.\n\nCertainly Hartley and his multi-awardwinning work (his Eustace and Hilda trilogy, completed in 1947, was hugely acclaimed, and the film version of his 1957 novel, The Hireling, won the main award at Cannes in 1973) have all but disappeared from contemporary literary consciousness. I first read his best-known novel, The Go-Between, at the age of 16 in 1979 (in a Penguin copy with Julie Christie under a parasol on the front, a still from Joseph Losey's 1970 film adaptation), because Hartley was the most contemporary writer on our Sixth Year Studies English course. I opened the same book again for the first time in three decades a couple of years ago. Can a book ambush you? From the prologue (\"Are you vanquished, Colston, are you vanquished?\") to the epilogue (\"Tell him there's no spell or curse except an unloving heart\") it felt, as I reread, uncannily familiar, like something I knew – and had no idea I knew – by heart.\n\nA combination of knowing and not-knowing is this novel's driving force. It announced itself to Hartley when he was in Venice in May 1952, working on a completely different project; he put it immediately aside and wrote The Go-Between quite fast, revising his draft as soon as October and November. It's set at – or rather, framed by – the mid-point of the 20th century, \"the most changeful half a century in history\", when Leo Colston, a man in his mid-60s, sits down in a drab realist 1950s room, the rain hammering at the window, to sort through some old papers. Almost straight away he comes upon a red cardboard box once used for his childhood Eton collars: in it are inconsequential odds and ends; some dried-up sea-urchins, some rusty magnets, \"which had almost lost their magnetism\", and a diary. He picks each thing up in turn. \"Something came and went between us: the intimate pleasure of recognition.\" But about the \"Diary for the year 1900\", with its Zodiac figures circling the announcement of this new \"Golden Age\", the \"glorious destiny of the 20th century\", he can remember nothing except a sense of baleful loss. He opens it: the combination lock, which he knows without knowing, is set to the letters of his own name. His own long-gone story breaks open on him all over again.\n\nLeo is 12 years old and visiting his upper-class schoolfriend Marcus's family seat, Brandham Hall in Norfolk, in the summer of 1900. He is wearing his too-hot Norfolk jacket (which makes him a sort of clothing joke), having come away unprepared for heat, in fact confident there wouldn't be any such thing, since he considers himself something of a magician; in the novel's prologue he relates how a curse he wrote in blood in his diary last term has caused two bullies to concuss themselves by falling off the school roof. He has ordered up a cool summer in the same way. But the summer is hotter than is imaginable. \"In the heat, the commonest objects changed their nature. Walls, trees, the very ground one trod on, instead of being cool were warm to the touch: and the sense of touch is the most transfiguring of all the senses . . . In the heat the senses, the mind, the heart, the body, all told a different tale. One felt another person, one was another person.\"\n\nHe also happens to be a lesser person at Brandham Hall, a mere mortal among its rich gods and goddesses. \"For the first time I was acutely aware of social inferiority.\" He keeps his lower status a secret, though Marcus's mother, Mrs Maudsley (there's a nice Tennysonian hum to her name) has an Elizabethan ability to fix you like a pinned butterfly with her gaze. Marcus's older sister, Marian, is Leo's first encounter with beauty – as if he has met not a person but a concept. \"So that is what it is to be beautiful, I thought.\" Marian, delightful, intuits Leo's embarrassment, keeps his secret about his lack of correct clothing and sweeps him off to Norwich where she buys him a cool green suit. She is positioned to marry the local Viscount Winlove, Hugh Trimingham, back from the Boer war with half his face scarred so badly that he looks like the god Janus, Leo thinks; one side an end and the other a beginning. Trimingham goes about his business wounded and elegant at once, with a great deal more knowledge of what's happening than he lets on.\n\nWhat's happening is this: the facts of life are about to be taught to Leo, a boy so naive that at first it's comic, then it hurts the heart. As the mercury rises, Leo becomes a kind of Mercury himself, a deliverer of messages between Marian and her lower-class lover, the tenant farmer and local \"ladykiller\", Ted Burgess, who promises to teach Leo what's what when it comes to \"spooning\". Much of the novel's humour lies in Leo's sweet literalness, and in the interlocked layers of knowing and unknowing viewed by Colston 50 years on, then by us, far off in our so-knowing future. His prepubescent blankness, when it comes to what \"spooning\" might be, makes for both funniness and discomfort. Do lady killers really kill ladies?\n\nMeanwhile, he can't say the name Hugh without it sounding, to Marian, like the word \"who\" or the word \"you\" – this in a book very much about identity, about who we are in the personal, the social, the historical and the natural senses. Leo is a boy who loves words, was bullied in the first place for using the long word vanquished in his diary for a football match victory; when his curses, astonishingly, seem to have taken effect he ponders what the action of putting words on paper might mean. \"It was then I began to cherish a dream of becoming a writer – perhaps the greatest writer of the greatest century, the 20th.\" His new clothes, his very greenness, liberate him, make a hero of him, and at the same time are his downfall.\n\nAs much as it is a revelation of the childishness of social hierarchy, of human delusions of power, and of the tragedy inevitable where war or history and innocence meet, Hartley's novel is a fine disquisition on appearance versus naked truth. \"In those days dress was much more ceremonious and jackets were not lightly discarded.\" Clothes in the novel demonstrate societal stricture, so that the revelation, not just of the sexual act, but of the cross-class sexual act, is contextualised as all the more unthinkable. A beautifully poised bathing scene (\"the word denoted an intenser experience than it does now\") highlights the apartness of men and women and the frissons of the body. Leo observes the beautiful cornfield-coloured body of Ted Burgess for the first time; it \"spoke to me of something I did not know . . . maturity in its most undeniable form\", lying near-naked in the reeds, smiling \"an intimate, pleased smile, that would have looked childish or imbecile on most people, but on him had the effect of a feather on a tiger.\"\n\nThe more clothes Ted had on, \"the less he looked himself\". This is a novel of memorably dressed-up theatrical set-pieces: a cricket match that is a little class-war in itself; a concert at which the tension between tenants and landlords, village and Hall, is overshone by a moment that's half real innocence, half hopeless sentimentality; a fierce earthy battle between Leo and a Freudianly insidious Atropa Belladonna (deadly nightshade). The novel signals itself and its seeming concerns almost too clearly – the beautiful doomed farmer cleaning his gun so assiduously. In fact its self-conscious narrative quality, at a glance, can seem a little crude, like a too-obvious jigsaw. But to think this is – yes – naive: The Go-Between is a work winged at the heel and rises above its earthy self in a voice that's expansive. More: something radical happens when this seeming crudeness and this real elegance come together – a revelation of narrative's own naivety in a book very much about the clichés of story, the pressures to conform and the losses and tragedies that arise from such pressures.\n\nIt is a masterpiece of double-speak and secrecy, somehow both ambiguous and direct. It works a magic on obviousness, so that it becomes a novel about British embarrassment and embarrassing Britishness. It's a book which subtly, almost mischievously, rejects subtlety: \"the facts of life were a mystery to me, though several of my schoolfellows claimed to have penetrated it.\" But couched and quiet at its centre is a whole other novel at a further level of knowing, innocence and unsaidness. Now, in a reread, I can see what I certainly couldn't consciously have seen or said in 1979, that Leo, in love with both the concept of Marian and the \"half-unwilling gentleness\", the feather on the tiger, the \"natural\" body of Burgess, is a go-between in quite another way.\n\nWith its vision of \"foreignness\", of the marginalisations inherent in class and sexuality, of the different possible self, the \"different tale\", it can also be seen as a gentle gay novel, and one of immense sophistication. Part defeated by repression, part glorious in discretion, part melodrama, part Hardy, part Lawrence; I wonder if its appearance in 1953 and its boldness then with the more surface issues of class and sexuality are partly responsible for Lady Chatterley's Lover finally seeing unexpurgated publication, which it did a decade after the appearance of The Go-Between. Its spirit, unlike Chatterley's, is gloomed, overshadowed by terrible new knowledge, two world wars, the Holocaust and the atom bomb: an \"abyss\", as Hartley puts it, at the core of the glorious new century. Hartley returns again and again in his critical essays, bewilderedly, as if he can't look away, to this \"abyss\".\n\nSo the novel looks backwards in essence, but one half of its face, its war-scarred, war-numbed half, looks forwards, towards Larkin, towards the literary realism of the late 1950s and early 60s. Its voice is echoed today in writers such as Colm Tóibín, John Banville, Paul Bailey, Alan Hollinghurst. It's no surprise that the film director Losey adapted it and included it in his trilogy of radical works examining Englishness, class, repression and morality alongside The Servant and Accident; the screenplay of The Go-Between is a pristine and skilful reworking by Harold Pinter.\n\nMercury is the god of communication, the god of thieves, the god of artists, the god of the conduit between living souls and dead souls. This novel, a revelation of the tragedy of hypocrisy and the workings of power, of the human need for \"calumny\" to be \"more colourful than it is\", also communicates images of a magnetism so strong that \"with its strength went a suggestion of beauty and mystery that took hold of my imagination in spite of all my prejudice\". It is full of images of rebirth, the most astonishing of which is the final image of the much older Leo literally revisiting his past and coming away again with yet one more romantic errand to run. The real revelation is of something which soars above social hierarchy and even the 20th-century abyss. It is both subtle and crass: a modern kind of sublime.\n\n\"One remembers things at different levels.\" The Go-Between is about books as much as it's about memory. It's a model of the importance of rereading (and God knows we treat books lightly – we wouldn't, after all, expect to know a piece of music properly on just one listen), knowledge and innocence so much part of its structure as to make it a knowingly different book on revisiting. Above all, though, it is a text which works like a charm: books are, in essence, go-betweens, works which conjure rhythm and release across time and history, across places of familiarity and those foreign to us; and personally and individually, too, it's all a going-between, for every person who picks up a book for a first, then a second, then a third time.\n\nAli Smith's There But For The is published by Hamish Hamilton."
