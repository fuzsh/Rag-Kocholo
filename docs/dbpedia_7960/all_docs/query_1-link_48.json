        "text": "When I first became enamored of classic Hollywood, there were a handful of actors who were responsible for introducing me to this new wonderful world. At the time, the one who shone the brightest was Marilyn Monroe. My sister first discovered her for a school project and soon both of us were fascinated by this incredible woman. I'll never forget when my sister received a box set of Marilyn's films for her birthday; we devoured those films as quickly as we could and to this day I cherish them. To celebrate Ms. Monroe's June 1st birthday, I thought I'd host my own three-day tribute by looking at three of those films that were so pivotal for me. Forget the tragedies, the romances, and the what-might-have-beens. What I want to focus on is the work, the iconic performances that Marilyn left behind. First up, we have Howard Hawks's magnificent musical comedy Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\n\n_____________________\n\nFrom the second Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe stepped out from behind a glittering black lace curtain, drenched in ruby red sparkles, I fell in love with Dorothy Shaw and Lorelei Lee. Their introduction to us is like an assault on the senses: immediately after the 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare, the first chords of \"Two Little Girls from Little Rock\" jolt the audience with its brash loudness while Russell and Monroe burst out of the darkness, their spotlight seemingly unnecessary thanks to their shimmering gowns and megawatt smiles. It's a bold entrance for any character to have, but for Dorothy and Lorelei, it's the only kind of entrance that makes sense.\n\nAfter this introduction, the plot moves along swiftly and smoothly. Engaged to milquetoast millionaire Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan), Lorelei tries to get him away from his domineering father by convincing him to take her to Paris and marry her there. As part of their plan, they have Dorothy act as Lorelei's \"chaperone\" on the boat trip to France and Gus will join them in Paris later. Unbeknownst to them, Gus's father, who is convinced Lorelei is a golddigger, has hired private detective Ernie Malone (Elliott Reid) to keep an eye on her. Complications arise when Malone and Dorothy fall for one another and Lorelei meets wealthy diamond mine owner Sir Francis \"Piggy\" Beekman (Charles Coburn).\n\nInitially a popular novel and then a hit musical on Broadway, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was brought to vivid life on the silver screen with a near-perfect script by Charles Lederer (with quite a few changes from its source material, the funniest being Henry Spofford III going from Dorothy's love interest to a wise-beyond-his-years little boy), unique Jack Cole choreography (it's not so much dancing as it is choreographed movement), and Howard Hawks's great direction. The film's eye-popping Technicolor is another major asset. While the backgrounds are usually neutral earth tones, Russell and Monroe always stick out from their surroundings. Their red lipstick and nail polish are consistently bright, and their wardrobes are made up of striking colors and light-catching sequins, beads, and baubles.\n\nThe musical numbers make the film soar even higher. Pieces of Leo Robin and Jule Styne's original Broadway score survived the screen translation, with catchy new tunes from Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Adamson mixed in for good measure. In addition to the dazzling \"Two Little Girls\" and the legendary \"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,\" the third big standout is Russell's winking rendition of \"Anyone Here for Love?\" as she swaggers around practically nude male athletes. My favorite numbers, though, are \"Bye Bye Baby,\" which Dorothy joyously sings with the help of the Olympic team while Lorelei slows it down in an effort to assure Gus that she'll be faithful, and \"When Love Goes Wrong (Nothing Goes Right),\" a routine that starts out as the women lamenting their financial and romantic losses and ends as an empowering pick-me-up that reminds them that their happiness doesn't depend on a man or his wallet but rather their own capabilities and resourcefulness.\n\nOne of the rarely discussed aspects of Monroe's talent is her singing. Although her voice wasn't as strong as, say, Jane Russell's -- her high notes at the beginning of \"Diamonds\" were actually dubbed by Marni Nixon -- there was a confident sweetness to it. You couldn't mistake her singing for anyone else's, especially when you hear her distinctive tremolo. It isn't enough to listen to her voice, though. To me, for Monroe to fully sell a song, you have to watch her perform it. Her body language and her presence are just so captivating. When she is crooning \"Bye Bye Baby\" in Noonan's ear, you become just as tongue-tied as he does. When she shakes her hips and bounces alongside Russell, you want to join in on the fun.\n\nWhile the film looks and sounds phenomenal, the heart and soul of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes are Dorothy and Lorelei. Russell and Monroe's performances ultimately determine the film's success and they do not disappoint. As Dorothy, Russell is a revelation -- hilarious and sharp-minded, she exudes a warm earthiness that betrays her character as a hard shell with a gooey center. When I saw this film on the big screen a few years ago, everyone walked out of the theater gushing over Russell.\n\nOut of all of Monroe's characters, Lorelei is the one that became the most conflated with the star, helping to stereotype her as a ditzy blonde. With her breathless voice and exaggerated facial mannerisms, Monroe threatens to turn Lorelei into a caricature, but she manages to show us glimpses behind this facade that remind us that Lorelei is a flesh-and-blood woman who has her own desires and ideas.\n\nMonroe's comedic brilliance always astounds me. She had such good timing and we definitely don't talk enough about the way she used her voice for comic effect. Just listen to her vocal inflections in\n\nGentlemen: the unnecessary drama added to \"Pray, scat!\"; her plea to Piggy that her \"brain is real starved\"; how she deepens her voice to evoke laryngitis and then pitches it real high a moment later as she excuses herself from the room. For Lorelei, her cartoonish facial expressions and voice are like her weapons against the opposite sex. With one pout of her lips, she can manipulate a man, particularly Gus, into doing anything -- and the poor suckers fall for it every time.\n\nWhile it is true that Hawks's camera often objectifies Monroe and Russell's bodies, there is power in their characters' frank sexuality. These women are very much in control of their bodies and obviously take care in how they present themselves. (The scene where they stride through the ship's dining room, happily aware that all eyes are on them, comes to mind.) Dorothy and Lorelei are also unafraid to hide their lust, sexual or materialistic. It isn't a secret that Dorothy loves men, just like it isn't difficult to tell that Lorelei likes the finer things in life. One of the film's best moments is when she outright admits to Gus's father that she wants Gus for his fortune. It isn't malicious, it's survival.\n\nAt a casual glance, these two showgirls couldn't be more different. Dorothy, a brunette, is the sardonic, practical one who enjoys chasing good-looking men. Lorelei, meanwhile, is a naive, supposedly dumb blonde who enjoys chasing good-looking diamonds. However, as the film goes on, we see that both women possess an intelligence that goes largely undervalued and overlooked by the other characters. Fiercely loyal to one another, it becomes clear that Lorelei and Dorothy are the only ones who truly appreciate and understand each other. Dorothy knows that her best friend isn't stupid, just like Lorelei knows Dorothy isn't the hardbitten cynic she pretends to be.\n\nThe film's romantic storylines depend on whether the men in their lives can learn to value these women as fully as they value one another. Men like Piggy easily fail this test because they don't bother to look beyond the women's looks. Gus also fails, but Lorelei decides to accept him anyway, telling Dorothy, \"I really do love Gus. ... There's not another millionaire in the world with such a gentle disposition. He never wins an argument. He always does anything I ask, and he's got the money to do it with. How can I help loving a man like that?\"\n\nMalone, on the other hand, passes the test. He certainly finds Dorothy attractive, but that isn't the only thing that draws him to her. He genuinely cares about her, but because he believes Lorelei is trouble and will drag Dorothy down with her, he continues to spy on Lorelei. When the women figure out what Malone is up to, it becomes a game of one-upping one another until Malone manages to get the dirt he needs. Although his love for Dorothy is sincere and she returns his feelings, the couple can't be together until Malone can prove he is worthy. He eventually does this by helping Lorelei get out of a jam, which, in a way, shows that he has come to accept Lorelei and the important role she has in Dorothy's life.\n\nIn the end, though, you aren't watching Gentlemen Prefer Blondes for the romances, and the film acknowledges that, such as in the final scene where Lorelei and Dorothy walk down the wedding aisle singing a reprise of \"Two Little Girls from Little Rock.\" As they take their places besides their grooms, the camera pushes in on the shot of the four of them until it squeezes the men out, leaving just Dorothy and Lorelei. The women share a giddy glance at one another before the shot fades to black, reiterating that this is first and foremost a film about female friendship.\n\nAlthough Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is glossy and great fun, the prominence of Lorelei and Dorothy's friendship gives the film a substance that is more than glitz and glamour. They support and love one another unconditionally, and the idea of a man coming between them is completely out of the question. Dorothy and Lorelei know that at the end of the day, it isn't romance that can fulfill you but friendship. It was a crucial representation to see in 1953 and it is still crucial to see today. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell may be known for other things, but I have a feeling that the legacy of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes will continue to be a significant part of how they are remembered for years to come.\n\n__________________\n\nThis is my first of three entries to the Second Annual Broadway Bound Blogathon, hosted by Taking Up Room. Check out the other fun contributions here!\n\nLoving and Fighting Furiously: Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\n\nLet me preface this by saying I set myself up for failure on this one. So much as been written about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz -- books, movies, TV specials, great blog posts. I can't possibly include all of the vast information I have at my fingertips, so if you're at all intrigued by my post, good news: there is a wealth of material out there. The Ball-Arnaz relationship was messy and sometimes hurtful, but it all came from two people who loved each other more than they could say. Their marriage brought them a legacy that transformed them into icons, yet they weren't the Ricardos -- they were Lucy and Desi, fallible people who ultimately couldn't stay together. \"Man, that's a hunk of woman!\" That's what a handsome 23-year-old Cuban said when he saw a gorgeous 28-year-old redhead in 1940. Wearing a tight gold lamé gown with a slit down the center to show off her legs and sporting a fake black eye and loose hair, Lucy had been filming for Da\n\nTop Ten: Fred Astaire's Partners\n\nEvery August, TCM dedicates one day to one exclusive star. It's times like these I'm thankful to the television gods for both airing TCM and for creating the DVR; Summer Under the Stars covers a vast array of different films and I can always find at least five that I've been dying to see. This August is a bit different because I'll also be contributing to the SUTS Blogathon that runs alongside the programming, hosted by Kristen at Journeys in Classic Film. I really wanted to cover a bunch of people, but things have been absolutely bonkers for me lately. I have other blogathons I already committed to that I still have to write for, I'm going back to IU shortly, and I had gallbladder surgery recently that kept me away from my blogging (but not my film viewing!). Because of all this, I just chose three wonderful stars -- sorry, my beloved Gene Tierney and Kate Hepburn! -- and today I bring you the first of those. For the complete list of entries, click here . There\n\nAnnouncing the 100 Years of Esther Williams Blogathon!\n\nThere have been quite a few centennials to honor this year -- Lana Turner, Donna Reed, Jane Russell, Judy Holliday, Dirk Bogarde -- but there is one I'm especially excited to celebrate: Esther Williams! To commemorate this gorgeous human being's 100th birthday, I'm bringing back my Esther blogathon from last year, which ended up being such a lovely way to honor her legacy. Because Esther's filmography isn't very large, I'll allow any topic to be claimed a maximum of two (2) times. That being said, you can cover more than her films, such as her autobiography, her history with swimsuits, her TV work, an overview of her teamings with people like Busby Berkeley, Red Skelton, Ricardo Montalbán, etc. I will say that if any of her work with Van Johnson is taken the maximum number of times, I'll still be holding my annual Van blogathon in August (which I'll be announcing very soon), so you'll have another chance to cover it. Again, because the topics are a\n\nFred Astaire tells Rita Hayworth... You Were Never Lovelier (1942)\n\nIn the early 1940s, Fred Astaire was already a legend, thanks to his massively successful teaming with Ginger Rogers. Amazingly enough, although the actor had conquered vaudeville, Broadway, and Hollywood, he still had many more iconic achievements to look forward to. Rita Hayworth, on the other hand, was just beginning her rise to film stardom when she was first paired with Astaire for 1941's You'll Never Get Rich . As Fred tells it, \"Gene Markey, then a producer at Columbia Pictures, asked me to discuss an idea about working with a little girl they had under contract there. She was primarily a dancer, he said, and sure to become a terrific star. She had only done a few B pictures up to that time. Her name was Rita Cansino -- recently changed to Hayworth. I had heard about this beautiful daughter of my old vaudeville-days friend Eduardo Cansino.\" Time passed, though, and Astaire began to wonder why he hadn't heard from Markey again until he read that the pr\n\nAnnouncing the Sixth Annual Doris Day Blogathon!\n\nWell, long time, no see! Life has made it hard to keep up with my blog, but I'm going to try my best to stick with my annual blogathons, including my Doris Day one. This year is particularly special because it's going to be Doris's centenary ! The rules are the same as they have been: you can write about anything relating to Doris -- her films, her music, her personal life, her work with animals, her role as a style icon, the list goes on! I also won't limit how many posts you want to do. Because there is so, so much you can write about, I'd prefer no duplicates . Sorry, all, it's first come, first serve. You can post on any of the three days of the blogathon, or you can post early. I only ask that you be sure to send me your link and I'll try to post it as soon as possible. Now grab a banner, spread the word, and I'll see you in April!

Dangerous When Wet (1953)\n\nIt's a bright, beautiful morning at the Higgins' Arkansas dairy farm. Giving us what may be the sunniest opening to a film ever, the Higgins family -- comprised of Pop (William Demarest), Ma (Charlotte Greenwood), cute little pipsqueak Junior (Donna Corcoran), middle daughter Suzie (Barbara Whiting), and the eldest child, Katy (guess who?) -- leaves the house one by one as they sing \"I Got Out of Bed on the Right Side\" and march to their swimming hole for their daily exercise routine. When it comes time to jump in the water, though, Katy only dips her toe in and turns her attention to the book she brought, which is such a fun bait-and-switch. Esther Williams is going to read about farming instead of swim?! Finally, Pop tells Katy to do her laps before breakfast. She begrudgingly obliges, and in she goes, baseball cap and all, doing a simple but wonderful underwater swim -- until she suddenly hears some advertisement jingle that breaks her out of her peaceful rou\n\nBob, Bing, and Dottie take the... Road to Rio (1947)\n\nWith the exception of 1962's Road to Hong Kong , the \"Road\" movies starring Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour are some of the funniest, weirdest comedies that ever came out of classic Hollywood. Brimming with inside jokes, delightful musical numbers, and plenty of decadent costumes and sets, the series always features Hope and Crosby as a pair of pals who find themselves in the worst situations as they travel to such places as Morocco, Bali, and Zanzibar. To be honest, not all of the films have aged well thanks to racist jokes and occasionally sexist attitudes, but one of the best entries, as I discovered this year, is Road to Rio . From the moment the opening credits started, this movie had me hook, line, and sinker. (I'm an absolute sucker for animated credits.) The plot follows musicians Hope and Crosby as they're forced to flee every gig because of one woman or another, finally winding up on a ship bound for Rio after they accidentally burn down the\n\nThe Fifth Annual Doris Day Blogathon is here!\n\nWho else is excited to celebrate Doris Day for three whole days?! After TCM's recent Star of the Month tribute to this illustrious triple threat, I can't think of a more fitting way to kick off April and celebrate Doris's 99th birthday. Participants, please leave me a comment below once you are ready to submit your entry. I'll try to post them as soon as I can! And if you're running a bit late, no worries -- I'll still accept it!

After six years and nine films, the partnership of Astaire and Rogers seemed to be ending with this final, impossibly beautiful waltz. People from RKO and nearby studios Columbia and Paramount gathered on the set, eager and sad to see this magical pair dance their last steps together. However, as Fred wrote in his autobiography, \"Ginger and I never felt that it was any last-time thing. We expected to do another picture or so when the right time came along.\" Ten years later, that time came when Judy Garland was placed on suspension and forced to drop out of The Barkleys of Broadway . Resting at her Oregon ranch, Ginger received a call from an MGM executive. \"Would you have any objections to doing another film with Fred Astaire?\" Appalled at the insinuation that she and Fred parted on bad terms, Ginger\n\nBette and Errol\n\n\"The most beautiful person we've ever had on the screen... He openly said he knew nothing about acting, and I admired his honesty because he was absolutely right.\" -- Bette Davis on Errol Flynn \"Now Bette was a dynamic creature, the great big star of the lot, but not physically my type; dominating everybody around, and especially me, or trying to. This drove me off.\" -- Errol Flynn The relationship between Flynn and Davis was not an easy one. In the late 1930s, both stars saw their popularity rising to astronomical heights. After setting the screen on fire in 1935 with Captain Blood , Flynn became a swashbuckling icon with The Charge of the Light Brigade, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Dodge City , and The Dawn Patrol to name a few. Similarly, at this time, Davis gave some of her own career-defining performances in Jezebel and Dark Victory . During this period, Davis and Flynn made two films together: 1938's The Sisters and 1939's The Private Liv"
