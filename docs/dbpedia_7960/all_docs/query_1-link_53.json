        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Screen goddess Sophia Loren will be making the St. George Theatre even more elegant this fall when she swings by Staten Island on her national tour, the theater announced this week.\n\nThe 81-year-old will share a lifetime of wisdom on acting, love, war and probably a whole lot more during the appearance and Q&A session at the St. George Theatre on Saturday, Sept. 10.\n\nLoren started her acting career in 1953 with the film \"Woman of the Red Sea\" and recently appeared in an ad for her own Dolce and Gabbana lipstick. Loren received a remarkable array of accolades, including the first Academy Award presented for a foreign-language role with \"Two Women.\"\n\nDecades later, in 1991, Loren received an Honorary Award from the Academy in acknowledgment of her incredible contributions to world cinema.\n\nThis won't be Loren's first time on Staten Island. In 1959, she filmed on the rock for the movie \"That Kind of Woman.\"\n\nWhen she comes to the St. George, Loren will have an intimate conversation, followed by the chance for audience members to ask her questions. In previous shows, Loren discussed everything from her relationship with fellow actor Cary Grant to growing up in the midst of World War II.\n\nThe performance will cover a lot of ground. Born Sofia Scicolone in Naples, Loren changed her name and began acting when she was 14 years old. She starred in her first American film, \"Boy On a Dolphin,\" in 1957, which led to a five-picture deal with Paramount, where she starred in such films as \"Houseboat\" and \"Heller In Pink Tights.\" She won an Oscar for her role in \"Two Women\" in 1960.\n\nShe went on to star in films like \"El Cid,\" \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" and other European films like \"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow\" and \"Marriage Italian Style,\" which brought her a second Oscar nomination.\n\nMore recently, she co-starred as Daniel Day-Lewis' mother in \"Nine\" and acted for her son, director Edoardo Ponti, in \"Between Strangers\" in 2002 and the short \"Human Voice\" in 2014."
