Perhaps you've missed out on some of the more invigorating, far-sighted list-based ventures.  Over at Some Came Running, for example, Glenn Kenny conducted an ingenious and fascinating project, going back and taking a look at the late Manny Farber's Best Films of 1951.  Meanwhile, at The Crop Duster, Robert Horton is engaged in surveying the year's best -- in non-chronological order -- from, oh, about 1919 or so, to the present, posting a new list every Sunday.  What fantastic delights are to be found in these itemized accounts...",

        "text": "[S]pending these hours in the Farber film world of '51, I found out it really is true what they say: they really don't make 'em like that anymore. Most of them share a hard-bitten attitude that a lot of contemporary pictures would like to emulate, but just don't know how to. For all of the putative advances that have been made in contemporary cinema in the depiction of sex and violence, and in use of language, there's also something that feels coddled, by comparison, in the supposedly franker contemporary material. Look at something like Losey's The Prowler in comparison with, say, L.A. Confidential (a film I largely admire, incidentally); for all the Production-Code-mandated restraint of the former picture, it oozes a particular kind of sleaziness that Confidential simply can't touch. I used to laugh off quasi-moralists who insisted that self-imposed censorship used to force American film artists to find more creative solutions to getting certain things across; having looked at a series of such well-curated films in a concentrated space of time, my certitude on this point has gotten a major shakeup.\n\nCrowded at the top in 1966: this is a year of flat-out masterpieces, a lot of which appear to be coming apart at the seams (or at least dismantling the pieces of what people generally call a movie). Well, it was the era. I first saw Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-Up on prime-time network TV in the Seventies, aware that it was an acknowledged great movie/head trip with some possible hotsy content, which was of great interest to me as an adolescent male.\n\nI still remember that (edited-for-television, obviously) viewing, especially the way the movie snapped into gear as soon as David Hemmings' photographer takes the shots that might contain evidence of a murder. Couldn't understand then why the mystery bit frittered away. Now I love how skillfully Antonioni builds and walks away from that conventional suspense, as though to say, \"Yes, you see how superbly I could make this kind of movie if I wanted to? But we're doing this instead....\" (And in the bargain, the whole movie now puts you on the edge of your seat, for different reasons.) Hemmings' aimless character is like a movie audience, waiting to be grabbed by a story, as his black-and-white stills, laid end to end, appear to offer. Except maybe there's nothing there - maybe we glimpse a story because we just really want to have the story. But it won't work out that way...\n\nThe best of 1966:\n\n1. \"Blow-Up\" (Michelangelo Antonioni) 2. \"Chimes at Midnight\" (Orson Welles) 3. \"Masculin-Feminin\" (Jean-Luc Godard) 4. \"Au hasard, Balthazar\" (Robert Bresson) 5. \"Persona\" (Ingmar Bergman) 6. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" (Sergio Leone) 7. \"Cul-de-Sac\" (Roman Polanski) 8. \"Intimate Lighting\" (Ivan Passer) 9. \"The Battle of Algiers\" (Gillo Pontecorvo) 10. \"Seconds\" (John Frankenheimer)"
