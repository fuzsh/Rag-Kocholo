He played a vital role in raising the Habsburg dynasty to a leading position among the Imperial feudal dynasties. Originally a Swabian count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of Austria and Styria, territories that would remain under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years and would form the core of the Habsburg Monarchy and the present-day country of Austria.\n\nRudolph was the son of Count Albert IV of Habsburg and Hedwig, daughter of Count Ulrich of Kyburg, and was born at Limburg Castle near Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl in the Breisgau region. At his father's death in 1239, he inherited large estates from his father around the ancestral seat of Habsburg Castle in the Aargau region of present-day Switzerland as well as in Alsace. In 1245 Rudolph married Gertrude, daughter of Count Burkhard III of Hohenberg. As a result, he became an important vassal in Swabia, the former Alemannic German stem duchy.\n\nRudolph paid frequent visits to the court of his godfather, the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II, and his loyalty to Frederick and his son, King Conrad IV of Germany, was richly rewarded by grants of land. In 1254, he was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV as a supporter of King Conrad, due to ongoing political conflicts between the Emperor, who held the Kingdom of Sicily and wanted to reestablish his power in the Imperial Kingdom of Italy, especially in the Lombardy region, and the Papacy, whose States lay in between and feared being overpowered by the Emperor.\n\n[edit] Rise to powerThe disorder in Germany during the interregnum after the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty afforded an opportunity for Count Rudolph to increase his possessions. His wife was a Hohenberg heiress; and on the death of his childless maternal uncle, Count Hartmann IV of Kyburg in 1264, he also seized his valuable estates. Successful feuds with the Bishops of Strasbourg and Basel further augmented his wealth and reputation, including rights over various tracts of land that he purchased from abbots and others.\n\nThese various sources of wealth and influence rendered Rudolph the most powerful prince and noble in southwestern Germany (where the tribal Duchy of Swabia had disintegrated, leaving room for its vassals to become quite independent) when, in the autumn of 1273, the prince-electors met to choose a king after Richard of Cornwall had died in England the year before. Rudolph's election in Frankfurt on 29 September, when he was 55 years old, was largely due to the efforts of his brother-in-law, the Hohenzollern burgrave Frederick III of Nuremberg. The support of Duke Albert II of Saxony and Elector Palatine Louis II had been purchased by betrothing them to two of Rudolph's daughters.\n\nAs a result, within the electoral college, King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1230â1278), himself a candidate for the throne and related to the late Hohenstaufen king Philip of Swabia (being the son of the eldest surviving daughter), was almost alone in opposing Rudolph. Other candidates were Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt and Margrave Frederick I of Meissen (1257â1323), a young grandson of the excommunicated Emperor Frederick II, who however did not yet even have a principality of his own as his father still lived. With the consent of the other electors, Ottokar's dissent was neglected, and by the admission of Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria, Rudolph gained all seven votes.\n\n[edit] King of GermanyRudolph was crowned in Aachen Cathedral on 24 October 1273. To win the approbation of the Pope, Rudolph renounced all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade. Pope Gregory X, in spite of Otakar's protests, not only recognized Rudolph himself, but persuaded King Alfonso X of Castile (another grandson of Philip of Swabia), who had been chosen German (anti-)king in 1257 as the successor to Count William II of Holland, to do the same. Thus, Rudolph surpassed the two heirs of the Hohenstaufen dynasty that he had earlier served so loyally.\n\nIn November 1274 it was decided by the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg that all crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognizing the new king. Ottokar refused to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden. Rudolph refuted Ottokar's succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the Imperial crown due to the lack of male-line heirs (a position that however conflicted with the provisions of the Austrian Privilegium Minus). King Ottokar was placed under the imperial ban; and in June 1276 war was declared against him.\n\nHaving persuaded Ottokar's former ally Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria to switch sides, Rudolph compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then re-invested Ottokar with the Kingdom of Bohemia, betrothed one of his daughters to Ottokar's son Wenceslaus II, and made a triumphal entry into Vienna. Ottokar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, made an alliance with some Piast chiefs of Poland, and procured the support of several German princes, again including Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria. To meet this coalition, Rudolph formed an alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and gave additional privileges to the Vienna citizens. On 26 August 1278, the rival armies met at the Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. The March of Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolph's representatives, leaving Ottokar's widow Kunigunda of Slavonia, in control of only the province surrounding Prague, while the young Wenceslaus II was again betrothed to Rudolph's youngest daughter Judith.\n\nRudolph's attention next turned to the possessions in Austria and the adjacent provinces, which were taken into the royal domain. He spent several years establishing his authority there but found some difficulty in establishing his family as successors to the rule of those provinces. At length the hostility of the princes was overcome. In December 1282, in Augsburg, Rudolph invested his sons, Albert and Rudolph II, with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolph Duke of Swabia, a merely titular dignity, as the duchy had been without an actual ruler since Conradin's execution. The 27-year-old Duke Albert (married since 1274 to a daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol (1238â95)) was capable enough to hold some sway in the new patrimony.\n\nIn 1286 King Rudolf fully invested the Duchy of Carinthia, one of the provinces conquered from Ottokar, to Albert's father-in-law Count Meinhard. The Princes of the Empire did not allow Rudolf to give everything that was recovered to the royal domain to his own sons, and his allies needed their rewards too. Turning to the west, in 1281 he compelled Count Philip I of Savoy to cede some territory to him, then forced the citizens of Bern to pay the tribute that they had been refusing, and in 1289 marched against Count Philip's successor, Otto IV, compelling him to do homage.\n\nIn 1281 his first wife died. On 5 February 1284, he married Isabella, daughter of Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy, the Empire's western neighbor in the Kingdom of France.\n\nRudolph was not very successful in restoring internal peace. Orders were indeed issued for the establishment of landpeaces in Bavaria, Franconia and Swabia, and afterwards for the whole Empire. But the king lacked the power, resources, or determination, to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an expedition into Thuringia where he destroyed a number of robber-castles.\n\nIn 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. However, the electors refused claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality, perhaps, leery of the increasing power of the House of Habsburg. Upon Rudolph's death they elected Count Adolf of Nassau.\n\n[edit] DeathRudolph died in Speyer on 15 July 1291, and was buried in the Speyer Cathedral. Although he had a large family, he was survived by only one son, Albert, afterwards the German king Albert I. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from Katharina who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.\n\nRudolph's reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern parts of the realm. In the other territories, the centuries-long decline of the Imperial authority since the days of the Investiture Controversy continued, and the princes were largely left to their own devices.\n\nIn the Divine Comedy, Dante finds Rudolph sitting outside the gates of Purgatory with his contemporaries, and berates him as \"he who neglected that which he ought to have done\".\n\n[edit] Family and childrenHe was married twice. First, in 1245, to Gertrude of Hohenberg and second, in 1284, to Isabelle of Burgundy, daughter of Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy and Beatrice of Champagne. All children were from the first marriage.\n\n1.Albert I of Germany (July 1255 â 1 May 1308), Duke of Austria and also of Styria.\n\n2.Matilda (ca. 1251/53, Rheinfeldenâ23 December 1304, Munich), married 1273 in Aachen to Louis II, Duke of Bavaria and became mother of Rudolf I, Count Palatine of the Rhine and Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n3.Katharina (1256â4 April 1282, Landshut), married 1279 in Vienna to Otto III, Duke of Bavaria who later (after her death) became the disputed King Bela V of Hungary and left no surviving issue.\n\n4.Agnes (ca. 1257â11 October 1322, Wittenberg), married 1273 to Albert II, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg and became the mother of Rudolf I, Elector of Saxony.\n\n5.Hedwig (d. 1285/86), married 1270 in Vienna to Otto VI, Margrave of Brandenburg and left no issue.\n\n6.Clementia (ca. 1262âafter 7 February 1293), married 1281 in Vienna to Charles Martel of Anjou, the Papal claimant to the throne of Hungary and mother of king Charles I of Hungary, as well as of queen Clementia of France, herself the mother of the baby king John I of France.\n\n7.Hartmann (1263, Rheinfeldenâ21 December 1281), drowned in Rheinau.\n\n8.Rudolph II, Duke of Austria and Styria (1270â10 May 1290, Prague), titular Duke of Swabia, father of John the Patricide of Austria.\n\n9.Guta (Jutte/Bona) (13 March 1271â18 June 1297, Prague), married 24 January 1285 to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and became the mother of king Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, Poland and Hungary, of queen Anne of Bohemia (1290â1313), duchess of Carinthia, and of queen Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292â1330), countess of Luxembourg.\n\nRudolph I's last agnatic descendant was Empress Maria Theresa (d. 1780).\n\nNote on Wife: Gertude of HOHENBERG\n\nGertrude of Hohenburg (c. 1225 â 16 February 1281, Vienna) was the first Queen consort of Rudolph I of Germany.\n\nShe was born to Burchard III, Count of Hohenberg (d. 1253) and his wife Mechtild of TÃ¼bingen.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Burchard IV, Count of Hohenberg and his unnamed wife. Her maternal grandparents were Rudolph II, Count palatine and his wife, a daughter of Henry, Margrave of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen.\n\nBurchard IV was a son of Burchard III, Count of Hohenberg.\n\nBurchard III was one of two sons of Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg. He was co-ruler with his brother Frederick, Count of Hohenberg. His brother had no known descendants and the two brothers consequently had a single successor.\n\nBurchard II was one of five known sons of Frederick I, Count of Zollern and his wife Udachild of Urach.\n\nFrederich I was the son of Burchard I, Count of Zollern. He was the founder of the so-called Burchardinger family line, male-line ancestors of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\nGrave in Basel[edit] Marriage and childrenIn 1245, Gertrude married Rudolph IV, Count of Habsburg. They had nine children:\n\n1.Albert I of Germany (July 1255 â 1 May 1308), Duke of Austria and also of Styria.\n\n2.Hartmann (1263, Rheinfeldenâ21 December 1281), drowned in Rheinau.\n\n3.Rudolph II, Duke of Austria and Styria (1270â10 May 1290, Prague), titular Duke of Swabia, father of John the Patricide of Austria.\n\n4.Matilda (ca. 1251/53, Rheinfeldenâ23 December 1304, Munich), married 1273 in Aachen to Louis II, Duke of Bavaria and became mother of Rudolf I, Count Palatine of the Rhine and Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n5.Katharina (1256â4 April 1282, Landshut), married 1279 in Vienna to Otto III, Duke of Bavaria who later (after her death) became the disputed King BÃ©la V of Hungary and left no surviving issue.\n\n6.Agnes (ca. 1257â11 October 1322, Wittenberg), married 1273 to Albert II, Duke of Saxony and became the mother of Rudolf I, Elector of Saxony.\n\n7.Hedwig (d. 1285/86), married 1270 in Vienna to Otto VI, Margrave of Brandenburg and left no issue.\n\n8.Klementia (ca. 1262âafter 7 February 1293), married 1281 in Vienna to Charles Martel of Anjou, the Papal claimant to the throne of Hungary and mother of king Charles I of Hungary, as well as of queen Clementia of France, herself the mother of the baby king John I of France.\n\n9.Guta (13 March 1271â18 June 1297, Prague), married 24 January 1285 to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and became the mother of king Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, Poland and Hungary, of queen Anne of Bohemia (1290â1313), duchess of Carinthia, and of queen Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292â1330), countess of Luxembourg.\n\nHer husband was elected King of Germany in Frankfurt on 29 September 1273, largely due to the efforts of her cousin Frederick III, Burgrave of Nuremberg. Rudolph was crowned in Aachen on 24 October 1273. She served as his Queen consort for the following eight years.\n\nShe died early in 1281. Rudolph remained a widower for three years and proceeded to marry Isabelle of Burgundy."
