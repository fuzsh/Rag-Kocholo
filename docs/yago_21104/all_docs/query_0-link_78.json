        "text": "The Ankeruhr in Vienna is a clock in a gangway between two buildings on the Hoher Markt Square (1. District). It displays every hour a different personality who has played a role in the history of Vienna. [German]\n\nThe displayed historical figures\n\nThe clock shows 15 historical figures in 12 hours. The amount of 15 is a result of displaying married couples three times. The featured personalities start to run in front of the clock face with the mentioned hour below:\n\n01: Marcus Aurelius (Roman emperor)\n\n02: Charlemagne (Emperor of the Romans)\n\n03: Leopold VI (Duke of Austria) and Theodora Angelina\n\n04: Walther von der Vogelweide (Minnesänger)\n\n05: Rudolf I (King of Germany) and Gertrude of Hohenberg\n\n06: Hans Puchsbaum (Gothic architect)\n\n07: Maximilian I (“the last knight”)\n\n08: Johann Andreas von Liebenberg (Mayor of Vienna)\n\n09: Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg (Field marshal)\n\n10: Prince Eugene of Savoy (Field marshal)\n\n11: Maria Theresa (Holy Roman Empress) and Francis I\n\n12: Joseph Haydn (Composer)\n\nEach figure is accompanied by a melody related to its period and historical role. The best time to visit the Ankeruhr is noon. At this time, the clockwork performs a parade of all figures and plays all music pieces accordingly.\n\nRomans and basilisks\n\nAn old inscription below the Ankeruhr mentions a Roman praetorium nearby. Actually, the Roman ruins are under your feet. The Roman Museum opposite the Ankeruhr let you step down to the ancient layer of Vienna.\n\nThe snake-like figure below the clock’s face symbolizes a Basilisk. You find another depiction of such a creature on the facade of the Basiliskenhaus in a lane named Schönlaterngasse.\n\nSources / More info"
