        "text": "Ancestors of Caden Michael Norquist\n\nThirty-ninth Generation\n\n514839164904. Svatislav I Grand Duke Of KIEV,415,3019 son of Igor I Duke Of KIEV and St. Olga, was born about 920 in Kiev, Ukraine and died in 973 in Berestova, Kiev, Ukraine 3019 about age 53. Another name for Svatislav was Svyatoslav I Igor'yevich.2842\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nHe was the son of Igor I Rurikovich, prince of Kyiv and Olga, princess from Pskov. He married Predslava. Their sons were Yaropolk, prince of Kyiv; Oleg, prince of the Drevlyani. He had a mistress, Malysha, with whom he had son, Vladimir I, prince of Kyiv.\n\nWith his mother controling Kyiv, Svyatoslav began his campaigns to expand Rus control over a wider tribute area, to defeat the rival Khazars and even to attack the Byzantines. His first efforts were directed along the Oka River in the Vyatichian lands. Learning that this tribe paid tribute to the Khazars, he then mounted a remarkable campaign clear to the Crimea, Volga and Kuban regions, defeating the Khazars in battle in 965 and sacking their cities. But then he sought bigger prizes in the Balkans. In 967 he campaigned to the Danube to attack the Bulgarians. The Chronicle notes that he captured 80 towns along the Danube and established residence at Peryeaslavets. The following year, while he was campaigning in the Balkans the Pecheneg attacked and besieged Kyiv. Olga defended the city and called for reenforcments from the north. The Pecheneg were bought off before Svyatoslav returned. Then he launched a campaign to drive them back into the Steppe. At that point he told his mother that he intended to move to Peryeaslavets. Apparently he considered it would be a better base of operations against Byzantium. She remonstrated and he delayed. Svyatoslav waited until the death of his mother, Olga, in 969, to move to Pereyaslavets. He entrusted Kiev to his son Yaropolk and to his other son Oleg gave the conquered lands of the Drevliane which had been knuckled under by Olga in punishment for her slain husband. The teenage brothers were easily manipulated by the Warlord, Svenel'd, once the trusted druzhina captain of Prince Igor' who sought revenge on Oleg for murdering his son Lyuta when the lad had ventured onto the princes' land while hunting. He pitted one against the other and convinced Yaropolk to mount a campaign against Oleg and unite the Drevliane lands with that of Kiev. Fleeing his brother, Oleg was killed when he fell from the draw bridge at the gates of Ovruch. The intrigues continued resulting in Yaropolk's demise due to the third brother Vladimir's ascent to power. Vladimir had been sent with his uncle to be the prince at Novgorod. This enabled him to escape Yaropolk and obtain his own Varangian troops.\n\nBut Svyatoslav's life at Peryeaslavets turned out badly. On his next campaign in the Balkans he found the Byzantines much reenforced and the Bulgarians also. The Bulgarians had retaken Pereyaslavets, so Svyatoslav had to besiege it. After initial setbacks Svyatoslav stormed the city. From there he marched against the Byzantines. The Emperor, John Tsimiskes, marched against him. They then signed a treaty in 971 in which Svyatoslav promised also not to attack Crimea or Bulgaria. On his return journey to Kyiv by boat up the Dnieper, Svyatoslav found that the Pecheneg controled the passage of the rapids. He waited over the winter and then, against good advice, tried to continue in 972. The Pecheneg ambushed him, killing him and most of his druzhina. Kurya, the Pecheneg ruler made a drinking cup out of Svyatoslav's skull. 2842\n\nSvatislav married Maloucha Of LUBECH,3019 daughter of Malk Of LUBECH and Unknown. Maloucha was born about 935 in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nThe child from this marriage was:\n\n257419582452 i.

Maloucha Of LUBECH,415,3019 daughter of Malk Of LUBECH and Unknown, was born about 935 in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nMaloucha married Svatislav I Grand Duke Of KIEV,3019 son of Igor I Duke Of KIEV and St. Olga. Svatislav was born about 920 in Kiev, Ukraine and died in 973 in Berestova, Kiev, Ukraine 3019 about age 53. Another name for Svatislav was Svyatoslav I Igor'yevich.2842\n\n514839164906.

Other names for Erik were Erik VI Bjornsson Sejrsael, and Erik BJORNSSON King Of Sweden.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nMet his nephew Styrbioern on the battlefield at the Fyrisvols and fought a battle which was said to have lasted for 3 days. Syrbiorern fell and with him the larger part of his army. Eric was thereafter called \"the Victorious\". After the battle the king ascended a high mound, promising a great compensation to the one who could compose a song in praise of the victory. The Icelander Thorvald Hialte, who never previously or afterward appeared as a scald, came forth and recited two strophes which are preserved, receiving a costly armlet of gold as reward. This battle -- next to the one at Brovols, the most famous in the heathen North -- was fought in 988. [WBH - Sweden]\n\nKing Eric invaded Denmark and took possession of the country, making the son of Harald Bluetooth an exile. In Denmark Eric was baptized, the first Swedish king about whom this is said. But upon his return to Sweden he also returned to the old gods. Eric Segersaell was king of Sweden and Denmark until his death in 994. Sigrid Storrada was his first consort. They were separated. [WBH - Sweden]\n\nSeveral runic stones from Skane, the Danish part of Sweden, commemorate men who did not flee at Uppsala, but fought so long as they held weapon in hand, and refer to the battle with his nephew Styrbjorn Starki, where Eric earned his nickname,\n\nthe Victorious'.

He is then said to have thrown Sven I of Denmark from his throne, and thus ruled in the south parts of Sweden, and then ruled in Denmark until his death. He possibly converted to Christianity c. 990 for awhile. He is also believed to have been married for awhile to Sigrid Storrada, was for certain m. to Gunhild of Poland, dau. of Mieszko of Poland and sister of Boleslav I, the first king of Poland. [Yvonne Korn <[email protected]]\n\nSven Forkbeard is said to have suffered divine punishment for his rebellion by being taken captive by his father's friends in Jumne in Pomerania and ransomed at a high price by the Danes, and then being driven from his ill-gotten kingdom by the Swedish king Erik the Victorious, and forced to spend 14 years in exile in Scotland, among other places, having been denied refuge in England.

Another name for Sigrid was Sigrid TOSTE.\n\nGeneral Notes: c995-Killed Harald \"The Greenlander\" King of Norway. [Ancestral Roots]\n\nAccording to Ancestral Roots, Sigrid is not the daughter of the King of Poland. That was Gunnhild von Polen, who survived Erik and married Sven Forkbeard, following in Sigrid's footsteps, but Sigrid \"divorced\" (Viking style) Erik.\n\n-------------------\n\nErik the Victorious was married several times. One of his wives is said to have been Sigrid Storrada (\"great ruler'), the daughter of Skoglar Toste, a famous Viking from Vastergotland. According to Snorri, she was mother of Erik's son Olof.\n\nAbout 985, according to the ancient tales, Erik fought a great battle against his still-rebellious nephew Stybjorn on the great plains of Fyrisvall, near Uppsala. . . .\n\nErik found it hard to get along with his wife Sigrid, due to her imperious temperament. After a while they went their separate ways. She retired to her estates in Vastergotland, where we are told that she ruled in great splendor and refused many suitors who were hungry for both her beauty and her lands. Among others, she is said to have refused Harald Granske of Norway and King Vifavald of Russia (a petty king of whom we know nothing further). Sigrid has been called \"the Haughty\" and she seems to have truly earned this surname. [Royal Families of Medieval Scandinavia, Flanders, & Kiev]\n\nNote: From the above I assume that Sigrid \"divorced\" Erik a short while after the battle in 985.\n\nSigrid married Sven (Sweyn) \"Forkbeard\" King Denmark & ENGLAND 3028,3029 after 985 in 2ND Husband 2ND Wife.

For the origins of Renaud, count of Roucy see the latter, pp 134-139 & table 13, and the sources cited.\n\nAccording to ES III, 675A (which does not identify his father, & cites Bur along with sources he also used) your Renaud occurs as early as 923, built the château at Roucy in 948, and died on 10 May 967 - where did you find the date 15 March 973? Bur suggests he was son of another Renaud, and either a half-brother of count Waldricus (Gaudry), whose son Guy was count of Soissons from 974 to 995, or related to the counts of Anjou.\n\nPerhaps Todd Farmerie will comment on whether there is any evidence that the elder Renaud came from Denmark.\n\nPeter Stewart\n\n- - - later post on the next day (1 Dec 2000) - - -\n\nThe claim that the elder Renaud was a Dane depends on identifying him with the Viking raider Ragenold, who according to the annalist Flodoard was invading France at about the same time as Rollo of Normandy. I'm not sure what the most recent opinions are regarding this possible identification.\n\nStewart Baldwin\n\n--------------------\n\nThe following post to SGM, 2 Dec 2000, by Christian Settipani (a noted French genealogist) suggests an earlier Renaud, with an Anjou connection, as father of Renaud:\n\nFrom: Settipani ([email protected])\n\nSubject: Re : Renaud de Roucy\n\nNewsgroups: soc.genealogy.medieval\n\nDate: 2000-12-02 06:58:28 PST\n\nI have examined lenghtly the family of this person in my paper : 'Les comtes d'Anjou et leurs alliances', in Family Trees and the Roots of Politics, ed. K.S.B. Keats-Rohan, Woodbridge, 1997, p. 211-267, at p. 222-225. I think that the equivalence Renaud of Roucy / Ragenold the Vikink is a false one and that there is no link between the two. Renaud de Roucy is probably the son of another Renaud, named from 924 to 941 in Anjou, and perhaps count of Soissons.

[Ref: William The Conqueror, The Norman Impact Upon England by David C. Douglas 1964]\n\n'Richard I and his new settler in-laws of the 960's were the winners who lasted. In becoming so they learned (and taught) two principles of success that marked them off from the Franks. They learned the value of a strong centralizing chieftain who could at least freeze the status quo once his own local chieftains had taken what they wanted. The more successful he was, the more chiefs attached themselves to him for just this: with his warranty, backed by his chieftains, their defeated enemies could not recover by violence what had been taken from them by violence. Thus were the Norman dukes 'settlers of quarrels.' Fearlessness was the necessary quality in such a coordinating chieftain, and Richard I, who has no encomiast of his deeds, has at least this sobriquet, 'the Fearless' Those who were great fighters and the ruthlessly, selectively violent, were the great centralizers among the threatened and rapacious Norse.'

Richard escaped from his custody at Laon, retook Rouen, and called on another Viking leader, Harald of the Bassin, for help. The Normans under Richard were able to re-establish their autonomy and from 947 Richard governed in relative peace. In 965 he swore allegiance to the Carolingian king Lothar at Gisors. Richard's official marriage was to Emma, daughter of Hugh the Great; they had no children, but by his common-law wife Gunnor, a Dane, he had many.

It is Robert who preserved the story of how Richard I of Normandy became enamoured of the beautiful Senfrie, wife of one of his foresters, and how Senfrie contrived to substitute her sister Gunnor for herself, to the Duke's ultimate satisfaction. [Ref The Sisters and Nieces of Gunnor, Duchess of Normandy by G.H. White in the Genealogist, New Series 1921 v37 p57]\n\nParentage of Gunnor and her siblings is unknown. While some sources call her father Herfastus, this was in fact the name of her brother. She has also been claimed as a daughter of the Danish royal family, but there is no evidence for this, and the context of her coming to attention of Richard I and the family's subsequent rise to power militates against her being a royal daughter. Douglas argued, based on the donations of brother Arfast to the monastery of St. Pere, that the root of the family was in the Cotetin region of Normandy, but van Houts has suggested that the Cotetin land was granted to Arfast, rather than inherited by him. Thus we are left with the more ambiguous statement of Torigny and others that she was a member of a Norman family of Danish origins.

Gunnora was NOT of Denmark. Some inventive genealogist somewhere along the line decided to make her daughter of Harald Bluetooth, but there is no basis for this, and what we know of her indicates it is not really a possibility worthy of consideration. Her nephew later was called \"of Crepon\" but he likely gained his posessions through Gunnora's marriage to the Duke, rather than this representing the original home of the clan.\n\nWhat can be said of Gunnora's parents? Nothing She was not daughter of Harfast, as (too) often stated. Her family was likely of the minor Norman nobility, since her oldest sister was married to a forester at the time Richard first bumped into the girls. That's it.\n\nRichard I of Normandy first bedded, and later married Gunnora, whose ancestry is entirely unknown. She is sometimes said to be daughter of a King of Denmark, but this is incorrect. [taf]\n\nThere are several things going on here. First of all, the father of Gunnora and siblings is not known. Attempts to name him Herbastus probably originated in confusion with her brother. Second, Gunnora had three sisters, Senfria/Senfreda, Wevia, and (Avelina). The first married an otherwise unknown forester. The latter two are confused by our two sources, one claiming that it was Wevia who married Osbern, and the other that Wevia married Turold of Pont Audemer, and by deduction, (Avelina) married Osbern. We know that Osbern married one of them, and a recent analysis suggests that it was Wevia for nomenclatural reasons. (Specifically, Turold and wife had a granddaughter named Duvelina, and it is hyposthesized that she was named for her grandmother, and that Duvelina is the authentic name of the sister, rather than Avelina. Finally, in which generation was Osbern's. This is unambiguous. She was sister of Gunnora and the others. There is no source before recent times that claims otherwise. There are two probable origins for the error that she was niece of Gunnora. First, due to the error in naming her father Herfastus, someone aware that this was the name of Gunnora's brother assumed then that Avelina's father was Gunnora's brother (the name of Gunnora's father being unknown, and probably unknowable). The second possibility is a confusion of uncle and nephew. Harfastus/Arfast had a son Osbern of Crepon, and perhaps someone confused this man with Osbern of Bolbec. Still, we know for certain that Osbern of Bolbec married a sister of Gunnora.

In 911, having entered Gaul afresh, perhaps by way of the Loire valley, he was defeated in a pitched battle outside the walls of of Chartres, and it was after this that he and his followers were given lands by the emperor in the valley of the lower Seine. Whether this famous grant of lands and recognition was made (as tradition later asserted) after a formal interview between Charles [King Charles III the Simple of France] and Rolf at Saint-Claire-sur Epte is questionable, and the application of the term 'treaty' to these arrangements is undoubtedly too precise. What, however, is certain is that before 918 Rolf and his followers already held considerable lands in this region, and that they had been formally confirmed in possession of them by the emperor. Equally certain is that in token of the new position he was henceforth to occupy in Gaul, Rolf accepted baptism at the hands of the archbishop of Rouen. [Ref: Wm Conqueror p17]\n\nRollo (later Robert) \"of Normandy\" Viking leader in France, d. 928×933. Although he is often referred to as the first duke of Normandy, that title is an anachronism. Probably about 911 [see Douglas 426-31], king Charles the Simple of France ceded a district around the city of Rouen to Rollo, which eventually evolved into the duchy of Normandy. He is said to have been baptized in 912, assuming the Christian name Robert [Dudo ii, 30 (p. 50)]. He was still living in 928, when he was holding Eudes, son of Heribert of Vermandois, as a captive [Flodoard's Annals, s.a. 928, see PL 135: 439, van Houts 45], and was probably dead by 933, when his son William was mentioned as leading the Normans [Flodoard's Annals, s.a. 933, see PL 135: 445, van Houts 45]. [Ref: Henry Project] note: the citations Douglas, Dudo, Flodoard, PL & van Houts are further identified in the Bibliography at the bottom of this page...Curt\n\nSince the article by Duglas (sic) [Duglas (sic), David, English Historical review 1942, p417-36] seems to be one of the main secondary sources used by many who support the alleged Norwegian origin of Rollo, a brief discussion of Douglas's article is in order.\n\nI agree with Duglas (sic) that the reference to Rollo as \"filio Catilli\" by Richer of Rheims can be dismissed. Richer used the generally reliable chronicle of Floodoard as a framework, which he then expanded with much legendary material of dubious value. This Catillus is a significant figure in Richer, but is apparently unknown from other sources, and his legendary nature is evident. The statement that Rollo was the son of Catillus is apparently an attempt by Richer to amplify the fame of Catillus (whose existence is doubful) by giving him a famous son.\n\nDuglas (sic) then outlines the well known saga statements regarding Rollo's supposed identification with Ganger-Rolf, son of Rognvald. To support his claim that \"Rollo\" is an acceptable Latin form for \"Hrolfr\", Duglas (sic) brings forward a single charter [a charter of Richard II for St. Quen, which predated Dudo and the other later sources, mentions the _atavus Ralphus_ of the Duke] which reads \"atavus Rolphus\" (not Ralphus) which appears to be referring to Rollo (p.421). However, as Duglas (sic) admits, the charter itself is not above suspicion. Another example mentioned in a footnote is a certain Turstinus fillius Rolv who was apparently the same person as a Turstinus filius Rollonis. This is a very small sample to make the claim that Rollo was a Latin form for Rolf. Just as likely is the possibility that the names Rollo and Ralph were confused in a couple of manuscripts. Since Ralph was such a common name in Normandy and England, we should see a large number of examples of \"Rollo\" and \"Ralph\" being used as the same name, if they were in fact the same. Since the number of examples which Douglas was able to produce is so small, it is more likely that some sort of copying mistake was made on the above examples, in which the uncommon name Rollo was accidently replaced by the extremely common (and similar) Ralph. Important negative evidence is not given, for Douglas never mentions that there is a Norse name \"Hrollaug\" for which \"Rollo\" is an obvious Latinized form. Since the sagas give Rognvald of More two clearly different sons named Hrollaug and Hrolf, it would be difficult to argue that Hrollaug and Hrolf are supposed to be the same name. The main other piece of evidence Douglas gives for accepting the saga account is the supposed confirmation of a saga statement about Granger-Rolf in the contemporary records. The following statement by Ari is quoted: \"Another son of Othere (he says) was Helge. He harried in Scotland and won there as his booty Nithbeorg, daughter of King Beolan and of Kathleen, daughter of Ganger-Rolf.\" Duglas (sic) then reads between the lines, and states that since Kathleen is a Celtin name, her mother would almost certainly be a Christian. He then turns to the nearly contemporary \"Lament for the Death of William Longsword\", which states that William was born outside France of a Christian mother at a time when his father was still pagan. He then states: \"The suggestion of the Landnamabok is thus confirmed by an epic poem composed in Gaul in the tenth century. The fact would seem to be a powerful, if not a conclusive, argument in favor of the identity of Rollo with Ganger-Rolf.\" The first sentence in the above quote is completely false. There is not a single detail in the quote from Ari which is confirmed by the statement in \"Lament for the death ...\" This argument used by Duglas (sic), in which he deduces an additional statement not in the original, so that there is something which can be \"confirmed\" is unacceptable. The fact that Douglas would refer to such an argument as \"powerful\" only serves to emphasize how weak his argument really is. [Ref: Stewart Baldwin 7 Dec 1996] (Note: \"Duglas\" referred to above is actually spelled Douglas. David C. Douglas, Fellow of the British Academy, Emeritus Professor of History, University of Bristol, Ford's Lecturer to the University of Oxford & editor of a series of studies of the English monarchs...Curt)\n\nAccording to the Orkneying Saga (late twelfth century), Rognvald, jarl of More in Norway, was the father (among others) of a certain Hrolf, who became the first duke of Normandy, and is therefore intended to be identified with the historical Viking Rollo, who appears in the contemporary Frankish annals of the tenth century. Those who accept this view base their argument on these late Icelandic sources. In my opinion, the Icelandic sources are worthless for early Norman history, and should be rejected as a source for Rollo's parentage. Some of the basic reasons for this opinion are as follows:\n\n1. The Icelandic sources are both late and foreign when it comes to Norman history. Other than the very well known fact that William the Conqueror was descended from the dukes of Normandy, the Icelandic sources do not offer a single fact about early Norman history which can be corroborated in the contemporary continental sources. In fact, the Icelandic sources say remarkably little about early Norman history, which is suspicious for a source which supposedly knows the origin of Rollo.\n\n2. The Norman sources, which are both native and considerably earlier than the Icelandic sources, tell a completely different story about the origin of Rollo, who is said to be of Danish origin. Even though some of the early Norman sources (such as Dudo) have been criticized for their innacuracy (and for deliberate embellishment), it is still reasonable to suppose that early native sources would be more reliable on the matter of Rollo's origin than late foreign sources.\n\n3. Unfortunately, the early tenth century is not well covered by the Frankish sources. However, even though the Norman sources have clearly embellished and romanticized the material on Rollo, the story of a Danish origin for Rollo fits quite well with what the Frankish sources for the late ninth century (a better covered period) say about the Danish invasions during that earlier period.\n\n4. Contrary to what has been frequently claimed, the names Hrolf and Rollo do not appear to be the same. The Norse name Hrollaug, which is a different name (see #5), is the name which would have \"Rollo\" as a reasonable Latinization. The claim that \"Hrolf\" was Latinized as \"Rollo\" by mistake is unlikely, because the Franks were quite familiar with the name, and a different Viking raider named Hrolf from the ninth century has his name correctly Latinized as \"Rodulf\" in the contemporary ninth century sources.\n\n5. Fifth, and most important, the Icelandic sources give Rognvald of More several sons two of whom are Hrolf, allegedly the same as the founder of Normandy, and Hrollaug, an early Icelandic settler. First, this shows that Hrolf and Hrollaug were regarded as different names. However, it also causes a big problem in the Icelandic story. If we are to believe the Icelandic account, Hrolf went to Normandy, where he was then known as Rollo/Hrollaug, i.e., the name of Hrolf's brother. If the Icelandic story were true, why would both the Frankish and Norman sources both refer to \"Hrolf\" by the name of his brother Hrollaug? (Claiming that the Icelandic sources were almost right, and that Rollo of Normandy was the same as Hrollaug son of Rognvald, is not feasible, because Hrollaug's role as an early settler of Iceland clearly marks him as a different person from Rollo of Normandy.) I would like to see this problem explained away by someone supporting position that Rollo was Rognvald's son. By the way, this last point (#5) has, to my knowledge, not been mentioned before (except by me in previous postings on the same subject), and I therefore have an obvious personal interest in knowing if this particular point has been mentioned by others. If point #5 has already been made somewhere else in the literature, I would be interested in having the reference.\n\nThus, in my opinion, for the reasons given above, Rollo of Normandy was was probably not the son of Rognvald of More, and his parentage should be\n\nregarded as unknown. [Ref: Stewart Baldwin 16 Mar 1998]\n\nalso known as Hrolf or Rollon, 1st Duke of Normandy from 911 to 927, called also Rolf the Walker, because, being so tall, he preferred to go afoot rather than ride the little Norwegian horses. Also shown as Rollon, Row, or Robert Originally a Norse Viking, he was noted for strength and martial prowess.\n\nIt is more likely that the title \"Duke\" is a tenth or eleventh century construct, as even the title count was not introduced until later documents, usually refered as count of Rouen. Neither Rollo or his son William Longsword issued many written instruments - certainly none that survive in the original.\n\nRollo the Dane, also known as Hrolf or Rollon, 1st Duke of Normandy from 911 to 927, called also Rolf the Walker, because, being so tall, he preferred to go afoot rather than ride the little Norwegian horses. Also shown as Rollon, Row, or Robert. Originally a Norse Viking, he was noted for strength and martial prowess. In the reign of Charles II, the Bald, he sailed up the Seine River and took Rouen, which he kept as a base of operations. He gained a number of victories over the Franks, and extorted the cession of the province since called Normandy. By the famous treaty which Charles the Bald and Rollo signed the latter agreed to adopt Christianity. He was born in 846 and died in 932, and was buried in the Cathedral at Rouen. He married (1) Gisla, daughter of Charles the Simple, King of France, no issue; (2) Lady Poppa de Valois, (means puppet or little doll), daughter of Pepin de Senlis de Valois, Count Berenger (Berenarius) of Bretagne, Count of Bayeux, and sister of Bernard of St. Liz (Senlis), also recorded as Berenger, Count of Bayeux. Rollo lived with her for some time before the marriage. [Ref: McBride2]\n\nDudo (contemporary with Rollo's grandson Richard I and informed by Richard's half-brother) states that Rollo was a Dane and had a brother whose name (I forget the form Dudo used) can be interpreted as Gorm or Guthorm. He portrays him as an extremely active individual rampaging, sacking, looting, and then being bought off by the French king to stop other vikings from doing the same, being baptized as Robert.\n\nThe Orkneyinga saga, which dates from a good bit after the time of William the Conqueror (great-grandson of Richard I and great-great-great-grandson of Rollo) says that the Jarl of Orkney had a brother Hrolf the Walker, who conquered Normandy and was ancestor of the Norman kings of England. It explains the nickname as indicating that he was so fat he could not ride a horse. He is a Norwegian, and had numerous brothers (including, oddly enough, one named Rollo), but none named Gorm or Guthorm.\n\nNow there are no absolute answers here, but one thing is clear. The accounts of Dudo and of the Orkneyinga saga are completely incompatable. Every single detail, other than that the man conquered Normandy, - name, ethnicity, physical characteristics, siblings, are all different. Obviously one of these sources is in error. Both contain material which is demonstrably false, and which has been used in the past to discredit them. However, Dudo probably actually knew people who knew Rollo, and it is difficult to come up with a motive for falsification of these details (why bother substituting danish for norwegian, for example) while the Orkneyinga saga author had no such direct connection, and furthermore had motive to invent such an ancient connection, to further glorify the family are the center of his tale. Still, nothing of this sort is certain, but given what each of the sources have to say, you have to give the nod to Dudo, which would mean that Rollo would not be identical to the Hrolf of the saga, and the claim that he was the founder of Normandy must rest on some sort of mistaken identity or intentional forgery. [Ref: TAF 27 Feb 2002]\n\nHrólfr (son of Rognvaldr) is, often (but dubiously) identified with Rollo of Normandy [Ref: Henry Project]\n\nBelow is from the Henry Project, compiled by Stewart Baldwin at http://sbaldw.home.mindspring.com/hproject/prov/rollo000.htm\n\nCommentary\n\nSupposed father: Rognvaldr, jarl of Møre.\n\nSupposed mother: Ragnhildr or Hildr.\n\nThe origin of Rollo is contraversial. There are several medieval sources which claim to give information about the origin of Rollo, the most widely repeated of which would make him a son of Rognvaldr, jarl of Møre by Ragnhildr or Hildr. As can be seen from the following brief notices, the various primary sources offer very contradictory information about Rollo's origin.\n\nThe earliest author to attribute an explicit origin to Rollo was Richer of Rheims, writing between 996 and 998, who called Rollo the son of another Viking invader of France named Catillus (presumably representing the Norse name Ketil) [Richer i, 28 (see PL 138: 35)]. Since Catillus appears to be a legendary individual, this account has generally been discredited, probably correctly [see Douglas 420-1].\n\nAccording to Dudo of St. Quentin (writing early 11th century), author of the earliest history of the Normans, Rollo had a younger brother named Gurim, presumed to be the familiar name Gorm. Dudo states that Rollo and Gurim were sons of a man who held many lands in \"Dacia\" (Dudo's word for Denmark, following other authors), and that after the death of the (unnamed) father of Rollo and Gurim, the king of Dacia fought against the sons, killing Gurim and driving Rollo out [Dudo ii, 2-4 (pp. 26-7)]. Dudo later refers to duke Richard I as being related to a \"king of Dacia\" named Haigrold [Dudo iv, 84-88 (pp. 114-20 passim)], who must have been the Viking raider of France of that name [Flodoard's Annals, s.a. 945, see PL 135: 463-4, van Houts 51], and not king Harald \"Bluetooth\" of Denmark. Note that Gurim cannot be the famous Gorm \"the Old\" of Denmark, who survived Rollo by many years.\n\nWilliam of Malmesbury (early 12th century) appears to be the earliest author to attribute a Norwegian origin to Rollo [WM ii, 5 (p. 125)].\n\nAs is well known, the Orkneyinga Saga (late twelfth century) [OrkS 4 (pp. 29-30)], followed by other Icelandic sources (such as the well known Heimskringla and Landnámabók), gives Rollo the name Hrólfr, and make him a son of Rognvaldr, jarl of Møre, and brother of (among others) jarl Torf-Einarr of the Orkneys [OI 1: 187]. Earlier sources, such as Ari's Íslendingabók (early to middle 12th century), mention Rognvald of Møre and his son Hrollaugr who settled in Iceland, but not the supposed connection to the dukes of Normandy [Ari 49, 61]. A poem allegedly written by Einar mentions his brothers, including a Hrólfr, but does not connect Hrólfr to Normandy, and does not name a Gorm among the brothers. (See ...Rognvaldr for more on this poem.)\n\nHistoria Gruffud vab Kenan (ca. 1250), apparently a Welsh translation and/or revision of an earlier Latin life of Gruffudd ap Cynan, gives Haraldr Hárfagri of Norway (\"Harald Harfagyr\") a brother named Rodulf (i.e., the Latin form of Hrólfr) who is called the founder of Normandy [HGK, 3-4]. However, this is evidently a corrupt version of the Scandinavian version, and the suggestion that Rollo was a brother of Haraldr Hárfagri need not be given any credence.\n\nThe most prominent argument of the case for accepting the Scandinavian account that Rollo was the same person as Hrólfr, son of Rognvaldr of Møre, was given by D. C. Douglas [Douglas 419-23], and those who accept this identification have generally followed the same arguments. On the other side, arguments against the identification were given by Viggo Starcke in his book Denmark in World History [Starcke 222-7].\n\nMost of the argument of Douglas consists of accepting the tale of the sagas and rejecting evidence from the Norman sources which contradict the saga version, while explaining away the problems (on which more below). The evidence which Douglas puts forward as \"a powerful, if not a conclusive, argument in favor of the identity of Rollo with Ganger-Rolf\" concerns a passage in Landnáamabók that refers to a daughter of Gongu-Hrólfr:\n\n\"... Annarr son Óttars vas Helge; hann herjaðe á Skottland, ok feck þar at herfange Niðbiorgo, dóttor Beolans konungs ok Caðlínar, dóttor Gongo-Hrólfs\" (Another son of Óttarr was Helge. He harried in Scotland, and won there as his booty Niðbjorg, daughter of king Beolan and Caðlín, daughter of Gongu-Hrólfr.) [OI 1: 66-7]\n\nThis passage, which Douglas attributed to \"Ari the Learned\" (who may or may not have been the author), is then compared with a passage from the nearly contemporary Plaintsong of Rollo's son William \"Longsword\" which was written soon after William's death:\n\n\"Hic in orbe transmarino natus patre\n\nin errore paganorum permanente\n\nmatre quoque consignata alma fide\n\nsacra fuit lotus unda\"\n\n(Born overseas from a father who stuck to the pagan error and from a mother who was devoted to the sweet religion, he was blessed with the holy chrism.)\n\n[Douglas 422 (Latin); van Houts 41 (English translation)]\n\nAfter explaining that the two stories are consistent with one another, Douglas then state that \"[t]he suggestion of the Landnámabók is thus confirmed by an epic poem composed in Gaul in the tenth century.\" While it is true that the two accounts as they stand are consistent with each other and with the claim that Rollo and Gongu-Hrólfr were the same man (ignoring all other evidence), it is surely a gross overstatement to claim that the Plaintsong \"confirms\" the other account, for there is not a single statement in the passage from Landnámabók that is confirmed by the Plaintsong. This is a clear case of circular reasoning, for without first assuming that Rollo and Gongu-Hrólfr were the same man, there is no evidence that the two passages have any relation whatsoever. Douglas's case is further undermined by the fact that another source [Laxdla Saga chapter 32, see OI 1: 246] makes Niðbjorg's mother Caðlín a daughter of Gongu-Hrólfr, son of Oxna-Þórir, directly contradicting the thesis that Caðlín was supposedly a granddaughter of Rognvaldr of Møre. Yet, Douglas apparently regarded this as the strongest part of his argument.\n\nThere are three main strands of evidence (somewhat related to each other) against the identification of Rollo with Hrólfr son of Rognvaldr:\n\n1. The discrepancies between the Norman and Icelandic sources.\n\nAmong other contradictions, the Norman sources give Rollo a brother named Gurim, while the Icelandic sources give Hrólfr several brothers, none of them named Gormr (the presumed Old-Norse form for Gurim). Although both of the sources have their problems, earlier native sources would seem to have a higher priority than later foreign sources. While"
