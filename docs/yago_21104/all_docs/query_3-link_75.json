        "text": "Albert I of Germany (July 1255-1 May 1308) was Duke of Austria and Styria from 27 December 1282 to 1 May 1308, succeeding Rudolf I of Germany and preceding Frederick the Fair, and King of the Romans from 27 July 1298 to 1 May 1308, succeeding Adolf of Germany and preceding Henry VII of Germany.\n\nBiography[]\n\nAlbert was born in July 1255 to the House of Habsburg, the son of Rudolph I of Germany and Gertrude of Hohenburg. His father gave him the Duchy of Austria and the Duchy of Styria as fiefs, but Wenceslaus II of Bohemia scotched his father's attempts at securing Albert's nomination as Holy Roman Emperor; he also failed to succeed Ladislaus IV of Hungary in 1290. Adolf of Nassau was elected Adolf of Germany in 1291 by prince-electors fearing a hereditary Habsburg monarchy, so in 1298 he was instead elected King of the Romans by nobles opposing King Adolf."
