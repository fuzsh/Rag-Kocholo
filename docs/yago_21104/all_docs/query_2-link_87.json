        "text": "<strong>Descendants</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Judel</strong> (<strong>Yudel</strong>) <strong>KNOPFLMACHER</strong> Generation No. 1 1. <strong>Judel</strong> (<strong>Yudel</strong>) 1 <strong>KNOPFLMACHER</strong> was born Abt. 1645 in Leipnik, Moravia. He married (unknown). Notes for <strong>Judel</strong> (<strong>Yudel</strong>) <strong>KNOPFLMACHER</strong>: Rabbi <strong>Judel</strong> Knopflmacher likely resided in the ancient town <strong>of</strong> Leipnik, Moravia. In the Knopflmacher Family Stammbaum, he is referred to as \"our teacher, Rabbi <strong>Yudel</strong>\". No further information about him is known. Child <strong>of</strong> <strong>Judel</strong> <strong>KNOPFLMACHER</strong> and (unknown) is: + 2 i. Joachim (Chaim) 2 <strong>KNOPFLMACHER</strong>, born Abt. 1672 in Leipnik, Moravia; died Bet. 1753 - 1764. Generation No. 2 2. Joachim (Chaim) 2 <strong>KNOPFLMACHER</strong> (<strong>Judel</strong> (<strong>Yudel</strong>) 1 ) was born Abt. 1672 in Leipnik, Moravia, and died Bet. 1753 - 1764. He married (unknown). She was born Abt. 1678. Notes for Joachim (Chaim) <strong>KNOPFLMACHER</strong>: According to the Knopflmacher Family Stammbaum, Joachim was a Rabbi in Leipnik, Moravia. He is referred to as \"our teacher, Rabbi Chaim\". Joachim's name has been also established through a Holesov document, dated 18 June 1794, in which his son Moises is alternately referred to as \"Moises Knopflmacher\", \"Moises [b.] JOACHIM\", and \"Moises [b.] JOACHIM Leipniker\". This third variation is evidence that Joachim Knopflmacher was a resident <strong>of</strong> Leipnik, Moravia [now Lipnik nad Becvou, Czech Republic]. Rabbi Joachim Knopflmacher was still alive in 1753 but was deceased by 1764 when a great-grandson was named in his honor.
