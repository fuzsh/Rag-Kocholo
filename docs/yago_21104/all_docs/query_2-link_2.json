        "text": "The blood of emperors runs in my veins, genetically speaking. No, really.\n\nAlbert IV, Count of Hapsburg and Landgrave of Alsace had a son in 1218, (though technically his wife, Hedwig, daughter of Ulrich, Count of Kyburg, had the son – he just helped). This was his eldest son, Rudolph I of Hapsburg (1218-1291) Emperor of Germany, founder of the Imperial House of Austria, who was elected Emperor in 1273.\n\nThis was not exactly your familiar democratic election, it was an election of the new emperor by the princes after the death of Emperor Richard of Cornwall. Rudolph came into the election at 55 as something of a front-runner. He was related to every king Germany ever had. He had spent a good deal of time at the court of his godfather, Emperor Frederick II and had been richly rewarded by grants of land for his time there. This played out when Emperor Frederick was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV as a supporter of King Conrad. Then Rudolph inherited large estates from his father, Albert. But probably the best thing he did for his career was to marry Gertrude, daughter of Burkhard III, Count of Hohenberg, back in 1245. Not only was she a heiress, the marriage made him an important vassal in Swabia. It also gave him a valuable ally in the form of her brother, Frederick III of Hohenzollern, Burgrave of Nuremberg. Not least, she gave him two sons, Albert and Rudolph II, and seven beautiful daughters that were as good as money in the bank.\n\nHis money may not have been in the bank but there was a lot of it and Rudolph invested it by buying more land mostly from various abbots. His mother's brother, Hartmann IV, Count of Kyburg, died childless in 1264, and Rudolph seized Hartmann's valuable estate, the County of Kyburg. Then he got into a feud with the bishops of Strassburg and Basel which he won, which further augmented his wealth and reputation. It's likely that his wealth and power wouldn't have been enough to secure the title of Emperor for himself, but his success largely came through the efforts of his brother-in-law, Fredeick. But then he bought off Albert II, Duke of Saxony (Wittenberg) and Louis II, Count Palatine of the Rhine and Duke of Upper Bavaria by betrothing them two of his beautiful daughters.\n\nThis left his main competitor, Ottokar II, King of Bohemia, and grandson of Philip of Swabia, King of Germany, twisting in the wind. Immediately after his election, Emperor Rudolph bought off the Pope by renouncing all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade. Pope Gregory X, in spite of Otakar's protests, not only recognized Rudolph himself, but persuaded Alfonso X, King of Castile, who had been chosen German king in 1257, to do the same. Then things got even better, or worse depending on your point of view. In November 1274 it was decided by the Imperial Diet in Nuremberg that all crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II must be restored, and that Otakar must answer to the Diet for not recognizing the new king. Otakar refused to appear or to restore the provinces of Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Hermann VI, Margrave of Baden. Rudolf refuted Otakar's succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the crown due to the lack of male-line heirs (This actually wasn't legal since that was a position that conflicted with the provisions of Privilegium Minus, but who's going to argue with the Emperor?). King Otakar was placed under the state ban; and in June 1276 war was declared against him. Having persuaded Otakar's ally Henry I, Duke of Lower Bavaria, to switch sides (using money instead of one of his daughters for a change), Rudolph compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then attempted to buy off Otakar by investing Otakar with Bohemia, betrothed another one of his daughters to Otakar's son Wenceslaus, and made a triumphal entry into Vienna. Otakar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, made an alliance with some Polish chiefs, and procured the support of several German princes, including his former ally, Henry of Lower Bavaria who didn't stay bought. To meet this coalition, Rudolph formed an alliance with Ladislaus IV, King of Hungary, and bought off Vienna by giving additional privileges to its citizens. On 26 August 1278, the rival armies met on the banks of the River March in the Battle of Dürnkrut and Jedenspeigen where Otakar was defeated and killed. Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolph's representatives. Young Wenceslaus was again bought off using one of Rudolph's daughters.\n\nTo the victor go the spoils and Otakar's defeat left Emperor Rudolph with a lot of spoils to distribute. Some went to his allies, but in December 1282 Rudolph invested his sons, Albert and Rudolph, with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolph Duke of Swabia. In 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. However, the princes refused claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality were probably leery of the increasing power of the Habsburgs. There was good reason for worry. Emperor Rudolph had lots of tricks up his sleeve besides using his daughters for increasing his wealth and power. For example, he declared the Jews to be serfs of the treasury, essentially stripping them of any rights. The Habsburgs, following his example, ruled Germany for centuries, had lots of daughters, and married themselves into every royal line around, providing the Queen consort for 6 successive rulers of France.\n\nRudolph II's line didn't do so well. He lost his share of Austria and Styria in Treaty of Rheinfelden where he had to relinquish his share as part of his father's attempt to clear the path for making Albert King. In 1289 he married Agnes of Bohemia, daughter of Otakar II of Bohemia and Kunigunda of Slavonia. They had one son John. He died in the same year his son was born, at the age of 20. His brother's eventual success at becoming the German King and failure to ensure that Rudolf II would be adequately compensated for relinquishing his claim on the throne caused strife in the Habsburg family, leading to the assassination of Albert by Rudolph's son, John the Parricide in 1308.\n\nBy the time of his death Albert had six children and the House of Habsburg was off and running. You can trace the House of Habsburg family tree (at least on the male side) in any good encyclopedia. Emperor Rudolph's male descendants through the male side included Dukes, Archdukes, Kings of Germany, Spain, and a full dozen Emperors. The last was Emperor Charles VI who died in 1740, but the Rudolph family continued to rule Germany until 1830 thanks to Emperess Maria Theresa. She was was the only female ruler of the Habsburg dominions and the last of the House of Habsburg. She was the sovereign of Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, Mantua, Milan, Lodomeria and Galicia, the Austrian Netherlands, and Parma, Duchess of Lorraine, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, German Queen and Holy Roman Empress. She continued Rudolph's policy of marrying off her daughters as political capital and named every one of them Marie after herself. In her time she was known as the great-grandmother of Europe. You probably recognize her better as the mother of Marie Antoinette.\n\nOur interest is not really with Empress Maria, it's with Sarah Rudolph who was born into the ruling family in Hamburg Germany in 1705 (the year Emperor Leopold I (something like a 5th cousin once removed) died). She was a direct descendant of Emperor Rudolph but far enough out of the line of succession she was able to marry beneath her family for love instead of politics. And in 1729 she did, to Michael Böhm, also of Hamburg, Germany. He was four years older than she was. The name Böhm in German meant, \"bauman,\" a man who cut beams from timber in the Black Forest. Michael Böhm, was however, no woodcutter, logger or carpenter. He was a farmer, tanner and merchandiser with a large farm or plantation on the river Elbe. This was a good place for merchandising and for his tanning and farming business. The North Sea seldom freezes in winter, consequently, ships can sail in and out of Hamburg all winter long. They had two sons, the older being Johann Dietrich Böhm, born in 1732 on the Elbe river near Hamburg, Germany.\n\nAt that time and place, it was the tradition that every male child would learn a trade, and not being overly enamored of farming, Johann elected to become a weaver which he learned as a child and then as a young adult left for Geneva, Switzerland to pursue his career. In some ways he did well in Geneva, meeting and marrying Rebecca Reynolds, niece of an eminent writer who died in 1778 and may or may not have been Jean Jacques Rousseau, the Geneva-born political philosopher whose writings were an inspiration to the French revolutionaries of the late 18th century. (Later generations (Johann's grandson) recorded the name as John James Rassaw.) The weaving career didn't work out as well and 1767 Johann, Rebecca and their two children returned home to Hamburg. It wasn't a good time to return.\n\nThe Elbe River had a great flood, overflowing its banks, and it took Michael Böhm's home and business with it. Totally wiped out, Michael and Sarah started over with almost nothing and Johann and Rebecca joined the immigration to America, land of opportunity. Michael died followed by Sarah in 1792; both are buried near the Elbe River in Hamburg.\n\nJohann and Rebecca with their two small children landed at Charleston, South Carolina sometimes in November, 1767. Not being able to pay his passage, Johann went looking for someone to advance the money and let him pay it out. Finally he sold himself and his family into servitude, contracting with Mr. Christopher Eaker of Lincoln County to serve him seven years for paying his passage to the immigration commission. In the paperwork, Johann Dietrich Böhm became John Teter Beam, a name he used ever after. Christopher Eaker was happy with his service and declared the debt settled after six years, giving him his freedom and providing a horse and other necessities for housekeeping. By this time John and Rebecca had three boys and three girls, and shortly after, in 1779, Rebecca died.\n\nThis left John alone and with 6 kids in the wilds of America. The next wave of immigrants included a family of Germans headed by Aaron Rudolph, a distant relative of his mother, and two years after his first wife's death, John married Aaron's daughter, Elizabeth. The Rudolph family moved on west and soon lost touch. John and Elizabeth had nine more children. Legal records show that he he soon became a considerable land owner on Beaver Dam creek, in Lincoln county; Land Grant No. 72 for 200 acres in Lincoln County on October 9, 1783, and Land Grant No. 79 for an additional 250 acres. There he ran a farm in connection with his trade until about the year 1794, when he purchased the lands of William Killian on Buffalo creek. He built a corn and saw mill at this place where he was successful and continued to add to his means.\n\nThe first slave he ever bought was in Charleston in the year 1800 when an African trading vessel landed there, and he bought Bristow, then a boy of about twelve years of age. The boy knew nothing of the English language and when one of Johns daughter's commanded him to do something, not understanding her, he made an attempt to kill her with an ax. One of her brothers knocked him down. After that things worked much better, at least from the Beam perspective and Bristow became an obedient servant and lived to be a ripe old age, still owned by the Beam family.\n\nIn the year 1801 John Beam built a small house of worship on the hill erected for his own denomination-- Lutheran-- but as he was not religiously prejudiced he always opened it to other denominations. He became an elder of the Lutheran church. In time the church he help start evolved from Lutheran to Baptist and he is buried in what is now New Prospect Baptist Church in Cleveland County.\n\nJohn lived through the American Revolutionary War, certainly on the American side, but did not fight; his trade being worth more at home to the soldiers than his service in the army. This may sound like a cop out, but his contributions to the war are well documented by the Daughter's of the Revolutionary War (DAR) and if you are a descendant of John Teeter Beam, to qualify for the DAR, all you have to do is prove the line of descent, not that he was a patriot.\n\nPeter Beam was the second child of John and Elizabeth. Peter was born on January 15, 1787 in Lincoln County, North Carolina. Peter manufactured cotton seed and flax seed oil in connection with the cotton gin and mill, which was a very profitable business during the 1840's and 50's. Peter Beam and Annie Long were married in 1809 in Lincoln County, North Carolina. Annie (daughter of Captain John Long and Ann Graham) was born in 1788. Capt. John Long was one of the heroes of the McEntire's Branch in Mecklenburg, distinguishing themselves in suppressing Cornwallis's foraging party of 450 men. Annie was the a niece of Col. William Graham.\n\nPeter and Annie named their first child John Teeter Beam after his grandfather. Their 12th and youngest child was Letitia Ann Beam, universally known as \"Letty.\" Annie died on March 20, 1850 in Cleveland County, North Carolina. She was buried in New Prospect Baptist Church Cemetery.\n\nPeter Beam and his second wife Elizabeth Houser were married on May 10, 1851 in Cleveland County, North Carolina. Elizabeth Houser was born in 1818 in Lincoln County, North Carolina. She gave birth to Isaac Alexander Beam on May 28, 1852. She died on June 9, 1853 in Cleveland County, North Carolina. She was buried in New Prospect Baptist Church Cemetery.\n\nPeter Beam and his third wife, Susan Lattimore were married on February 11, 1854 in Cleveland County, North Carolina. Peter Beam died on July 29, 1879 in Cleveland County, North Carolina and was buried in New Prospect Baptist Church Cemetery.\n\nLetty married George V. Cabaniss IV on November 5, 1850 in Shelby, Cleveland County, North Carolina. Letty and George had nine children, seven of whom were girls (keeping with the Habsburg tradition, you notice). Letty died April 9, 1885 and was buried in Hagwood Cemetery, Jackson County Alabama, survived by children in North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas and Texas.\n\nHer middle child (and middle daughter) was Martha Virginia Cabaniss, born on June 21, 1860 in Langston, Jackson Cty, Alabama. Martha married David Elias Welborn in September of 1861 in Langston Alabama where he was born. By the time their first child, Dovie was born in 1843 they had moved to Cookeville, Texas. September 19, 1891 they had their sixth and seventh children, Ella and Della, twin girls.\n\nDella, the second of the twins married Jim Grayson and moved to New Mexico, but Ella stayed in Cookeville and married Robert Ashberry Davies, a cotton farmer, on December 2, 1911. Robert dropped the e from his last name somewhere along the way and his nine children were brought into the world with the last name of Davis.\n\nThe Davis family was doing pretty well, though the lands they farmed were heavily mortgaged, up until the great depression at which time the banks came in and took everything. This was a traumatic enough event that my father, then a child, was to find as an adult the process of going into debt to the bank to build a house deeply disturbing. Robert and Ella started over with next to nothing and Robert was soon farming other crops. Disaster struck again when a tree being felled hit Robert in the head and the resulting injury robbed him of the power of speech. He was never quite right again, but his bachelor brother, Colonel Davies moved in and kept the farm a going concern.\n\nWorld War II took Robert and Ella's sons away to various parts of the world and her daughters worked as welder's or otherwise supported the war effort and scattered also. They had nine children in all, Lorena, Robert, Jesse, George, Clifton, Vernon, Margie, Jack, and Virgie Marie.\n\nMy father, Clifton Berry Davis, the middle child, served in the Army Air Corp, what later became the Air Force. Stationed in New Jersey, he and a buddy dated twins Caroline and Elizabeth Layton, however he found himself more interested in their older sister, Mae Clifton Layton, a school teacher. They were married and moved back to Texas once Clifton was out of the service. I was born in Hughes Springs, Texas, Clifton Boyd Davis, in June 17, 1949.\n\nSo there you have it, from Emperor of everything in sight to Povert in about 20 generations.\n\nOnly in America. :-)\n\nNow mind you, that's technology enhanced Povert who probably lives better than any of those emperors ever did."
