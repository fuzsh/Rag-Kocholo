        "text": "The Holy Roman Empire was an elective monarchy, but after Charles V, Ferdinand I, Maximillian II, Rudolf II, and Ferdinand II, it sort of became a de facto hereditary monarchy with the electors being expected to choose a Habsburg, at least until the Emperors ran out of sons. Starting from Otto the great's reign, how quickly can this family plausibly do the same thing but faster? At this point the Habsburgs are... nobody. They are thought to descend from Guntram the Rich, but even that is uncertain. I guess it shows just how unimportant this family of counts were during Otto's time if the contemporary chroniclers didn't make very sure they got the family tree right. \"eh, he's the father of Radbot and Werner... probably. Ok let's talk about the this other family\" Actually, the more I look at it, the more I am wondering just how these guys were possibly the ancestors of Rudolf I of Germany. How did they get good enough that Rudolf was able to get a marraige to Gertrude of Hohenberg?\n\nFrankly, I think that OTL was about as fast as it could get - the marriage to Gertrude of Hohenberg wasn't all that far out of the ordinary as far as Swabian nobility went, but the most important part on the Habsburg rise to proeminence was the Interregnum after Frederick II's death - with the weakening of royal authority, Rudolf took the opportunity to increase his possessions by force of arms, taking lands from the nearby prince-bishops and claiming the County of Kyburg on the basis he was the nephew of the last count.\n\nAll that (plus Gertrude's dowry, of course) made him important enough in Swabia to start getting connections to more important princes outside of there, and through those, he managed to get himself elected King, and the royal title gave him opportunities to expand his holdings even more, by claiming Austria, Styria, Carniola and Carinthia. That ended up giving him a large permanent powerbase (once they were done fighting rival claims), and helped his house remain relevant at a high level even after his death, which, for example, the Gerulfings and the Nassaus (who also managed to put their members in the German throne) did not manage.\n\nBut all that depended on a specific conjuncture - i doubt that Rudolf would have managed to get that sort of latitude of action if Conrad IV or William of Holland had lived longer and consolidated themselves on power, or if the Hohenstaufens had fallen off earlier.\n\n@Alex Zetsu essentially the \"nobody\" factor was the reason Rudolf was elected. Nobody wanted a new dynasty. They were up for a sort of bunch of random nobodies (Habsburg, Nassau, Wittelsbach, Luxemburg, Schwarzburg- the Wittelsbachs were the only \"non-nobodies\" on that list) who couldn't build up a decent powerbase.\n\nNow, to meet the OP, what we could do is have Emperor Albrecht I's son, Rudolf, successfully claim the countship of Holland as a lapsed fief. It sounds odd, especially since Holland wasn't part of the empire IIRC. However, firstly, it would've meant Rudi marries Elizabeth of Rhuddlan- Edward I's daughter, the widowed Countess of Holland- giving him a valuable tie to England (Edward had originally tried to get one of his older daughters married to Albrecht/his brother) and an ally against Philippe IV of France. Yes, I'm aware Bohemia would likely still come up for grabs but Rudi killed himself (by disease IIRC) trying to get that (no guarantee he wouldn't wind up dead in Holland, but let's assume he doesn't). Rudi and Elizabeth not only sprog off but Albrecht manages to get his son and heir elected as king of the Romans too.\n\nNow, king of the Romans doesn't automatically mean that Rudi will be the new emperor, but given the fact that Holland is \"outside\" the empire's boundaries and considerably less important than Bohemia...the ones doing the electing might go \"what's the worst that could happen\". Especially since Ludwig IV's OTL election they avoided electing John the Blind of Bohemia for precisely the reason they felt the Luxemburgs had become too powerful and the election was between Ludwig IV and a Habsburg candidate (Friedrich the Fair). Holland is more \"fringe\" than Bavaria (it's also wealthier) so it's not impossible Rudi can bribe his way to a coronation. Then when Rudi dies things depend on how old his son is, was Rudi able to get the boy elected as king of the Romans or not, and who would be the opposition. OTL Emperor Ludwig IV. Maybe John the Blind. If Charles IV of France isn't king of France, he might throw his hat in the ring like he planned to OTL. If Ludwig IV has pissed off the pope already, then that's likely gonna be no dice. Charles IV's dead? well, that's damned inconsiderate of him to die. Leaving Rudi's son vs John. Or perhaps Lajos I of Hungary (also a contender OTL). As mentioned, they already felt John was too powerful in the election in the 1310s, so unless some random dude (OTL they scrounged up Gunther of Schwarzburg after Ludwig IV's death and Edward III's ultimate decision to not stand- or he couldn't get enough votes) manages to walk off with the prize, likely we see Emperor Albrecht II*. That's already three emperors in a row (and judging by his brother's lifespans, Rudolf II will die a natural death sometime in the 1330s- Albrecht 2 is likely in his mid-late 20s/early 30s, already married and with kids), which means that in all likelihood, they will be looking for any excuse to not elect Albrecht 2's son.\n\n*I'm going with a Danish style alternating between Rudolf and Albrecht for simplicity sake."
