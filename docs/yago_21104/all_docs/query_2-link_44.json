        "text": "Rosalind Keith was a gifted child theater actress who ramped up plenty of amateur experience before she even came to California. Hungry for fame and success, she got what she wanted with some elaborate publicity stunts, but was soon stuck playing leads in C level movies. Now what she expected from Hollywood, Rosalind retired upon marriage, and left her acting ambitions behind. Le’ts learn more about her!\n\nEARLY YEARS\n\nRosalind Culli was born on December 6, 1916, in Mascoutah, Illinois, to Rudolph Culli and Hilda Culli. She was their only child. Her father was a mechanical engineer.\n\nWhen she was a small child her parents moved to Belleville, Illinois. For a time her father was connected with the Modem Electric Company, the Metropolitan Insurance Company and later operated a soda bottling works. Rosalind at an early age showed remarkable talent in dramatics. However she came by this naturally as her mother appeared in several local plays and gave remarkable performances.\n\nWhile still a child Rosalind was a pupil of the Kendall School of Expression. She appeared in number of their plays during the years from 1922 to 1931. Some of her most important local roles Included “The Girl of the Wagon Train” at the Washington Theater and Little at the Lincoln. In 1930 when the Mayor staged a huge benefit show for the unemployed Rosalind appeared in an important role in Little Brown School”. The next year at the opening of the Kendall Little Theater she made one of her last appearances in the leading role of the opening attraction.\n\nThe Cullis moved to St Louis, Missouri in the late 1920s, but Rosalind continued her lessons with Mrs Kendall for a considerable period. Rosalind attended high school in St. Louis, and continued acting in amateur productions, racking up quite a number of shows under her belt.\n\nAfter Rosalind graduated from high school in St. Louis, she decided to try her luck in Hollywood. And that is She landed some bit parts in theater shows. She was appearing on the stage there in “Small Miracle’ when talent scouts spotted her and gave her a screen test. And this is how it all began!\n\nCAREER\n\nRosalind came to Hollywood when she was a seasoned little theater actress, who acted for years and had plenty of experience. So what went wrong? It’s hard to say, but Rosie was stuck in low level movie entries, and somehow never managed to outgrow that. Was she not charismatic, or perhaps she was not a good actress? Or maybe she just wasn’t lucky? But let’s see what she did make during her Hollywood sojourn.\n\nRosalind made her debut in the forgotten movie, Romance in the Rain, about the publicity shenanigan of a a editor of a tabloid magazine. Very relevant even today! Not much is known about the movie, but Heather Angel and Esther Ralston are in the cast, which is always a plus! heather’s voice! Pure perfection! Rosie than appeared int he original adaptation of The Glass Key. As most movies where is a more famous versions (the Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake 1942 movie), it’s unjustly overlooked, and while generally not better than it’s more prolific brother it does have some meaty young George Raft deliciousness in it. And Claire Dodd, playing the role was famous for int he early 1930s (a sly, vixenish but ultimately bad girl) is stunning!\n\nRosalidn thne played a leading role in Annapolis Farewell, a movie that is preserved but is almost never shown anywhere and most people who don’t live in California can’t watch it easily. it’s a old times vs. new times movie, with a old navy man coming to Annapolis and being unhappy with the way thins are today. It has a solid B level cast(Tom Brown, Richard Cromwell as the dashing young men and Guy Standing as the old timer) and it seems to be a B level effort.\n\nSimilarly forgotten is It’s a Great Life, a Despression era drama about young men who deperately want to find work, travel around the country, and fall in love with the same women (played by Rosalind). While the movie is slated too much into melodrama (As it seems), it’s an interesting relic of the bygone times and what young men shad to live trough during the early 1930s. From a social point of view, very intriguing!\n\nseems like a charming little comedy, so rarely made today! Here is the bare bones scenario: Set in 1883, Professor Eustace McGargle, a swindling carnival man, comes to a small town with his daughter, Poppy (Rochelle Hudson) where he establishes himself as the prize medicine seller while Poppy wanders about and meets and falls in love with Billy Farnsworth (Richard Cromwell), a mayor’s son, but because of Poppy’s sideshow background, the Farnsworth family look down on her. Only Sarah Tucker (Maude Eburne), a matron woman, takes a liking to Poppy, and later discovers something about her true identity that makes things right again with the Farnsworths. But, like in most W.C. Fields comedies, it’s not the story, but it’s the Fields touch, his special brand of comedy which is hard to describe, but so endearing and funny at the same time.\n\nKing of the Royal Mounted is a movie about Mounties, and allegedly not a bad one either! Fans of outdoor movies, especially situatied in the lush green mountain surroundings, should enjoy this! Rosalind plays a innocent girl who inherits a mine but an evil lawyer is after it, and a handsome Mountie comes to her rescue! Rosalind’s last movie of 1936 was Theodora Goes Wild, a superb screwball comedy with Irene Dunne and Melvyn Douglas, where Irene plays a New England prim and proper small town gir living with tho very conservative spinster aunts, but who leads a double life as a scandalous bets selling author! Problems arise when Mervyn Douglas finds out her secret, and comes to visit her in their puritanical small town. Irene is a treasure of an actress, and Douglas is great in anything he appears in, and the two make quite a pair!\n\nRosalind appeared in a string of seemingly okay B movies, but who are completely forgotten today: Find the Witness, a crime movie about a Houdini type of a magician who is accused of murdering his wife, but he claims he was enclosed in a coffin at the bottom of the ocean at the time,and the detectives are working against the clock to see if he is guilty or not, Westbound Mail, a Charles Starret western (and yopu know what I think of low budget westerns, the less said the better), Parole Racket , a run of the mill gangster movie that abound in the 30s, with Paul Kelly playing a good guy trying to get bad guys behind the bars,\n\nMotor Madness, Criminals of the Air, a crime movie about people busting an aerial smuggling operation (and one of Rita hAywiorth’s earliest movie roles!), A Fight to the Finish a Monte Cristo revenge like movie about taxi cab drivers, A Fight to the Finish, a convoluted drama thriller about a girl who inherits a steel works company and has to keep it afloat with the help of a fair foreman, Under Suspicion, a similarly themed industrial espionage thriller. In similar vein were Manhattan Shakedown and Arson Gang Busters, both typical low budget 1930s thrillers dealing with a specific issue (journalism in Shakedown and arsonists in Gang busters).\n\nLuckily, the next few movies Rosalind appeared in are a bit more… Noticed by reviewers, so we can vouch to say they are not completely forgotten. However, and they good? Clipped Wings get seen today by aviation aficionados and fans of Jason Robards Sr so it’s not forgotten, but it’s not a good movie, it’s a strictly C level affair and it shows in the overall quality. Trouble in Sundown is a low budget western, and less I say about them the better (you know I don’t like them at all!). Bad Boy on the otehr hand is a kind of an oddity, an early film noir where Rosalind plays a femme fatale who spins Johnny Dows around her little finger. Johnny gets mixed up with some pretty bad guy (racketeers), and lots of thrilling things happen! The movie was butchered by the censors (Rosalind’s character was a prostitute, but that was toned down) and retains but a bit of it’s original power, but it’s worth watching as a late 1930s relic!\n\nRosalind got married in 1939 and largely retired from movies, and made only one uncredited appearance, in Ladies of Washington , an low budget but nonetheless interesting whodunit with a bunch of girls living together due to the housing shortage during the war, and then a murder happens! There are plenty of B class actress eye candy, like Trudy Marshall, Sheila Ryan, Beverly Whitney, and even a very early role for the magnificent Anthony Quinn!\n\nThat was it from Rosalind!\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nRosalind married her first husband, James H. Lewis, an artist and magazine illustrator, in St. Louis in 1932, when she was just 15 years old and still in high school. The marriage was very stormy, with James liking to flirt with other girls and Rosalind always unhappy about it (he often was too friendly with waitresses, sometimes when Rosalind was there). She called James “sullen, morose, cold and uncompanionable.” Then he just left their shared home one day in August 1934, this was the last straw for Rosalind. They finally divorced in 1935.\n\nWhen Rosalind came to Hollywood in 1934, she tried to be noticed to get a role. Due to pretty girls being an easy commodity in Hollywood, she decided to take some extra measures to be noticed. She bleached her hair, thinned her eyebrows, started to wear more make-up, and opted a succession of unusual pets: a coyote, a honey bear, and then an ocelot. Before she assumed ownership of the ocelot, Paramount Pictures signed her to a contract role in The Glass Key. Rosalind had not forgotten her former friends in Illinois, and for instance her old mentor Mrs Kendall received two beautiful photographs from Miss Culli and has had several letters from her while In Hollywood.\n\nAfter dating men like Abey Drefus for a short while, Rosalind then met and fel in love with eminent cameraman, William Mellor. The two became an elopement case in March 1939, when they were secretly married in Boulder City, Nevada. Mellor was born on June 29, 1903. He began his career in the photographic labs at Paramount in the mid-20’s and in the early 1930s became a director of photography, working primarily on the studio’s lesser productions. At the same time, he continued to serve his apprenticeship by assisting veteran cinematographer Victor Milner as first camera operator on A-grade features. Mellor was a homeboy who preferred living with his mother, shunned the Hollywood social life and was pretty introverted. He was never married before he met Rosalind.\n\nThe outgoing, forcefull Rosalind and such a gentle, artistic soul as Mellor did not mesh well at all. Rosalind tried to make it work, but within 10 months, fed up with everything, Rosalind asked a divorce from Mellor, charging extreme cruelty. They had been married so briefly, true, but it was more than enough for Rosie to know what she did not want. As she told the divorce court: I do not feel I am divorcing my husband so much as I am divorcing his family. He was very spasmodic in his affections,” she said. “It seemed he was influenced by his family he lived with his mother and his sister for 36 years.”\n\nRosalind next married husband number three, wealthy financier Leo Jacobson, in 1940. Jacobson gave Rosalind the entry into he world of wealth, and she became accustomed to some finer things in life, which became a habit. However, she marriage fell apart very soon, and in a almost comical, farcical way. Here is an article from their divorce case:\n\nFinery Housewife, auburn-haired Rosalind Keith of the film?, has the most extensive wardrobe in Beverly Hill s “sufficient for the next 10 years.” Financier Leo Jacobson yesterday thus described the extent of Miss Keith’s wearing apparel at a temporary alimony hearing in Superior Judge Carl A. Stutsman’s court in which the actress asked $500 monthly.pending trial of the couple’s divorce suit. Mi?s Keith admitted that her wardrobe is “quite extensive” and includes several fur coats valued at approximately $5000. Further testimony of both Jacobson and Miss Keith disclosed that the couple have lived at the same house since divorce proceedings were instituted. “We share the same bedroom,” Miss Keith said, “because we discuss the financial arrangements of our divorce until the wee hours of the morning. At first I slept in a guest room, but I lost too much sleep walking back and forth.”\n\nRosalind divorced Leo in 1942, and married Hernando Courtright on September 29, 1943 in Nevada. Hernando was an interesting man. The president of the Beverly Hills Hotel and a former vice president of the Bank of America, he had quite a history! Hernando William de Vos Courtright was born on July 10, 1904, to George Courtright and Marguerite Del Valle, in Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, reared in San Francisco. At six years old he suffered a skull fracture when he was thrown from a pony and dragged. The accident impaired his hearing, but did not stop him from pursuing his dreams. Graduating from UC Berkeley and the USC School of Business he became president of the National Pacific Tank and Mill Co. of Oakland, then vice president at Bank of America, where he fell into the hotel business. He purchased and made the Beverly Hills Hotel a world-famous hotel – it became the “in” place to stay, its Polo Lounge an especially famous spot for movie biz people. Hernando was a true bon vivant, and knew just about everyone worth knowing. He was also not married before he met Rosalind.\n\nRosalind became a California high society matron, and was very active in the local charity circuit, was a major party organizer and visible in all the major societal newspaper columns of the time. Her movie career was effectively over, but other interesting things were before her!\n\nIn a weird twist of events, Hernando sold his Beverly Hills hotel to hotelier Ben Silberstein, and also lost his wife to the same man! Yes, Rosalind divorced Hernando and married for the last time to Benjamin Laurence Silberstein. Silberstein was born in 1902, in Michigan. He was married once before, to Gertrude Bord, in 1930. They had two children, a stillbirth son in 1931, and a daughter, Muriel, born on October 24, 1932. The couple continued living the high life in California afterwards. This is his FindaGrave biography, and trust me it’s interesting:\n\nHotel owner. He was a union boss from Detroit who traveled to California with his family and at the request of one of his young daughters bought The Beverly Hills Hotel and Bungalows in 1954. He lived there and ran the hotel under his strict and watchful eye until the year of his death, creating and consistently maintaining an atmosphere which made top business executives and celebrities need to stay there, during the waning Golden Years of Hollywood. Running a 97% occupancy rate year round, he protected a completely social atmosphere in the 1912 hotel by not allowing any advertisement or convention groups, neither of which he needed. He also didn’t allow anyone to be in the hotel’s lobby without shoes or to be loud and boisterous, nor any photography whatsoever in the public areas. The hotel had it’s own security officers and its confidential “Do Not Take” list included all rock groups and was much longer than the VIP list. He kept a close eye on the behavior of employees and guests alike, and to help him remain anonymous on the premises his staff spoke to and of him only as Mr. S. He had some eccentric ideas and would often dress in casual unfashionable clothing so as not to be recognized and pandered to. This once led a new employee who had never sen him, thinking he was a homeless person, to call security when he wandered into the the hotel’s accounting office very early one morning.\n\nThe marriage to such a colorful character did not last, alas, and Rosie and Ben divorced in 1962. Silberstein remarried to Bonita Edwards and died in 1979.\n\nRosalind remained in California, long retired, enjoying her golden years. She did not remarry and moved to Diablo, Conta Costa at some point.\n\nRosalind Courtright died on February 24, 2000, in Diablo, Contra Costa, California.\n\nPretty Jane Liddell was at first glance a starlet that wanted some fame and fortune from Tinsel Town. And that she did get, but not in the way one would expect – her fame has nothing to do with her movies (her career is pretty slim), and her fortunes came around in a very unusual way. Let’s learn more about her!\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nJane Anne Liddell was born on July 28, 1927, somewhere in Missouri, to Grace Webber and Thomas Liddell. Before Jane, the Liddells had had a son who died the same day he was born in 1921. Thomas was a store manager. Jane spent her earliest years living around Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska. The family moved to Neola, Iowa, where Grace’s family was from, in 1929.\n\nJane grew up in Iowa, before the family moved to Oakland, California in the late 1930s. Jane still held her relations from Neola close to her heart (especially her aunt), and was often visiting them or they were visiting her in California. Jane was interested in the performing arts, and did some minor acting work in local workshops and plays. Ann attended high school in Oakland.\n\nBy coincidence, just after graduating from high school, Jane met, purely socially, actress Ann Sheridan via some mutual friends. Ann liked the plucky girl and, upon hearing that she wanted to become an actress, was more than happy to help her, and introduced her to producer Howard Welsch. Welsch also liked the girl, gave her a chance to appear in one of his movies. This is how her career started!\n\nCAREER\n\nJane’s first movie was Woman on the Run, a Ann Sheridan film noir. It may be a low budget affair, but it’s a very stylish, slick movie. Dennis O’Keefe plays a painter who witnesses a murder, then he becomes a target for the killer himself. He tries to evade him, but can he? Excellent location shooting in San Francisco combined with a tense story and a gallery of first class, offbeat characters make this one a minor gem. Jane’s friend Ann Sheridam plays O’Keefe’s former wife who doesn’t believe him at first, and there are also solid turns by Robert Keith, Frank Qualen and Ross Elliott.\n\nher second movie was Rogue River, a nifty outdoor movie about the conflicts that arise between members of an extended family in a small Oregon lumber town. The movie might be thin on the dramatics (altough the story isn’t half bad), but it’s very impressive visually and a treat for the eyes. Shot on location, is features the Pacific west as it once was, and there are some good actors to show their skills – Leslie Fenton, Rory Calhoun, Peter Graves.\n\nThen came a seminal 1950s movie which perfectly encapsulates the decades attitudes towards what movies should be – The Blue Veil . A tearjerker shot in the best, most expensive vein, this is a very touching, emotional but highly unrealistic movie. As I said, typical 50s, which preferred to live in a American dream style bubble. But moving this aside, the movie does have it’s man and strong merits. Jane Wyman stars as a war widow who seeks employment as a nanny after her baby dies shortly after the delivery. The movie then follows her life as she selflessly helps parents rear their children. Overall, this is an excellent movie and people remember and cry over it decades after watching – it’s a true monument to it’s dramatic genius. And many, many great actors appear in it – Jane, Charles Loughton, Joan Blondell, Agnes Moorehead, Audrey Totter, Richard Carlson and so on.\n\nThen came the breezy, cute 50s musicals, Small Town Girl and How to Marry a Millionaire. As somebody once wrote, super fun fluff! The stories are usually paper thin, but the sets, the costumes, the actors, the music, the overall vibe are all magical and anyone who had not watched it should definitely do it! And oh the cast is simply delicious – Ann Miller, Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, Bill Powell, Cameron Mitchell and so on.\n\nJane’s last movie came in 1956, a family western drama, Westward Ho, the Wagons!. Since this is a Walt Disney production, we know what to expect (wink). The movie was tailor made for Disney star Fess Parker, who played Davy Crockett to big acclaim in the eponymous TV series. A string of movies were made to capitalize on his success. This use-case usually does not end particularly well for the movie quality, although here it’s a surprisingly well made movie. In fact it’s like two separate films spliced together, the better for a two part extravaganza on TV. To quote a reviewer: “The first half hour is an enjoyable but relatively routine wagon trail tale, involving a boy must run from hostile Indians on foot. when the train arrives in Fort Laramie and no further big battles occur. In fact, this is where the movie takes off dramatically, promoting the sort of racial tolerance and mutual acceptance so essential to the Disney vision.” Parker plays a doctor who helps all people, regardless of their ethnicity. While the movie doesn’t flow as it should, it’s a very nice film with a positive message and goo production values.\n\nThat was it from Jane!\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nWhen she first came to Hollywood, in 1948, Jane was seen with Forrest Tucker, who was separated but not divorced from his wife, Sandra Jolley. In the end Forrest and Sandra reconciled and Jane was out.\n\nAnd then, in November 1948, Jane married Charles Bernhard, a very wealthy British producer and businessman. This could have been just another rich man marrying a pretty starlet scenario, but actually it was not. Bernhardt was told by his doctors that he was terminally ill and would be dead in a matter of months, and he wanted to marry a pretty young girl before his demise. A bit on the egoistical side, but anyone can understand this – he knew he was going to die, and wanted certain things to happen before that. When you look at it, ff the other party consents, than it’s two mature individuals having a mutually beneficial relationship and that’s all fine. Jane was there on hand, and she would be left a wealthy widow, and said yes to his proposal. So far so good. However, the drama beings after Bernhardt died in 1949. Namely, in his will he disinherited Jane, claiming that she refused to act on the spousal duties, like setting up a mutual home, and that she deserves nothing from his estate. Jane sued his estate to get her share. There was much legal drama going back and forth (I will not go into this).\n\nSo what really happened? Nobody knows, and here is my take on the situation – and it doesn’t look so good for Jane. It seems she wanted to have her cake and eat it too – namely, get married to a rich guy who would die soon and leave her a wealthy widow and then refuse to give him what was expected from a wife. While I cannot know exactly what happened, and it is possible that the two had a deal that Bernhard tried to change (perhaps he told her she doesn’t have to do anything and took it back which would change this narrative a lot), I would venture to say that Jane married for money and then tried to kept Bernhardt at arms length. I repeat, we cannot know for sure what happened and Jane could potentially be a victim, but by the looks of it, I would rather say that she chickened out when it was time to take things next level (living together, keeping home, taking care of each other). This is her right, for sure, but if that is the case, act like a normal person, annul the marriage and ask for nothing and just move on with your life. It didn’t work out and that’s fine. Especially if the guy is dying, as it seems that Bernhard died quite bitter at his wife for this unexpected turn of events. Just is just my take on the situation, and people can disagree with me, but it was not a happy period for Jane at all.\n\nAnyway there was much drama over the property division, and Jane fought tooth and nail to get her share of the inheritance. In the end she got some money, and in fact funded herself a comfy life in the upper echelons of Los Angeles society. Now begins the dramatic life of Jane Liddell, the social butterfly that hosted tons of parties and dated a large number of men. Was is a cool life? Perhaps. Truth to be told, Jane now depended no no man, could do what she wanted, did not have to marry if she did not want to, and was a free agent. So many women, then and now, have no idea what this entails, nor how it feels, which is sad. You can choose what you want, of course – getting married, staying single, whatever – but having the freedom to choose is an incredible thing, something denied to women for many, many centuries. So, in a way, Jane got what she wanted, perhaps not in a most glittering and stress-free way, but it was here. Plus she did not have to work, and slowly her movie output diminished. And now, for a chronology of her beaus:\n\nIn the early 1950s, Jane dated Bill Walsh, a former beau of Ruth Roman, for a long time. She also dated another Bill, Bill Bishop, around that time. Afterwards she was seen with Robert North, a radio actor who played Alice Faye‘s brother in her radio show. He was followed by Joe Pasternak, a famous producer who seemingly dated so many pretty women in Hollywood.\n\nJane then took with Freddie de Cordova, a colorful fellow is there ever was one. A producer and director of some reputee, he was rumored to be gay and still living with his mother in his 40s. Jane was seen with Jeff Chandler, but then ditched him for the handsome Lance Fuller in 1954. That same year, she ditched Fuller for Bob Stack, a socialite actor.\n\nIn 1955, her man of the day was British actor Maxwell Reed, former hubby of Joan Collins. In 1957, she was feted by Mario Ferrari, of the prestigious family, who zapped her around Hollywood in a fancy car. This was a pretty serious relationship, but I think his family in the end said no to the prospect of Jane being a wedded member, and it broke. She recuperated by dating another aristocratic face, Baron Gottfried Von Hohenburg. Him living in Germany and she in Los Angeles put a hamper on the proceedings, and they also broke up.\n\nin the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jane dated Ken Scott, an agent, and David Hedison. By 1966, she was evolved with the famous comedian, Phil Silvers, who was once married to starlet Jo-Carroll Dennison.\n\nIn the late 1960s, she dated Gerry Huffaker and Charles Darke. Jane then falls of the newspaper radar. It seems that she continued living in California, and later in the 1970s married a certain Mr. Dragge, about whom I could find to concrete information. Most probably she and Dragge divorced in the 1990s.\n\nJane Liddell died on November 18, 2009, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAileen Covington was one of many young, beautiful girls with some dancing skills that landed in Hollywood, and hoped for the best, only to be thwarted in their career by matrimonial events. Long after her Hollywood career was cut, she became a very respected sports writer. Let’s learn more about her!\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nAileen Bernice (Birney) Covington was born on September 16, 1906, in Ruston, Louisiana, to Wilis Covington and Mattie Russ. She was the third of five children – her siblings were Edwin Netwon (born on June 6, 1902), Yolanda Frances (born on February 8, 1905), Harold Alexander (June 23, 1908), and Richard Marvin (August 15, 1911). Her father was a salesman who sold a variety of things during the span of his professional life, including monuments and newspapers.\n\nAileen’s maternal family, the Russ’, were one of the oldest and well respected families int he city – her grandfather was R. E. Russ, for whom the town of was named, Mr. Russ having given much of the land on which the city stands. This connection made Aileen something akin to a socialite/debutante. Aileen grew up happily in Ruston, and discovered pretty early she had a knack for dancing and performing. The family were devout Baptists and attended Lincoln parish church.\n\nAlieen attended Ruston high school and Louisiana tech in her hometown. After graduating, she left for Texas, where she worked as a secretary and stenographer for an influential lawyer. With her innate talent for dancing and willing to work on it, Aileen paid to train under some of the best dance teachers to be secured in Texas. She eventually entered a national dancing contest, won it, met some right people and pretty soon she landed in Hollywood!\n\nAnd that’s how it started!\n\nCAREER\n\nAileen appeared in only four movies, all in uncredited roles, mostly in the chorus. The first one was Lady by Choice, an interesting Carole Lombard movie where she plays a fan dancer who teams up with a crusty old woman, played by Flora Robson, to up the quality of both of their lives. Carole is young and pretty and on her way up, and Floria is much older but with plenty of life experience, but also a nasty alcohol habit. It’s great to see a female team in movies, where women take center stage, and where the main objective isn’t necessarily men, but to get control over your own life choices. While this is a charming, breezy comedy in a nutshell, it’s still intriguing and has plenty of very good actors.\n\nHer second movie was one of Spencer Tracy’s early works, Marie Galante. it’s an okay thriller/esnionage movie where the titual Marie Galante is a songstress that gets mixed up with some wrong people and ends up in the Panama canal and everyone thinks she’s a spy. But is she? Who is the real spy? it’s up for the straitlaced US doctor, played by Tracy, to find out. The plot sound a bit cliche, but it’s always interesting to watch Spence, and his leading lady is the French mademoiselle Ketti Gallian here, a curiosity in itself, a very talented stage performer that never quite made it as a movie actress.\n\nNext up were Gold Diggers of 1935. a typical George White movie, full of pretty girls dancing and with little to no plot. but the totally loony characters make this a treat for all 30s musical fans, especially since this is Busby Berkeley. As one reviewer noted: The large cast is all attuned to the nonsensical merriment. Preppy Dick Powell is in excellent good voice as the hotel employee wooing rich girl Gloria Stuart, who only has to look lovely for the cameras. Alice Brady is properly shrill & strident as a miserly millionaire insistent on getting her own way in all things. Hugh Herbert is delightful as a daffy fellow interested only in his collection of snuff boxes. Hilarious Adolphe Menjou steals his every scene as a penniless Russian impresario who is obviously slightly crazed. Bold & brassy, the marvelous Glenda Farrell gets to play the only true gold digger in the film. Frank McHugh is Brady’s son, desperate to enjoy a forbidden romance. Grant Mitchell oozes unctuous charm as the somewhat smarmy hotel manager.\n\nAileen’s last movie was The Girl Friend. This movie is a typical B class comedies with the lesser known gents like Ann Sothern and Jack Haley, but these folks were gold! The story is very simple: it’s a burlesque pastiche of how shows get produced and move from local barns to the big time, just put in some Napoleon (yeah, you heard that right!), and plenty of zany character and you got yourself a deal!\n\nThat’s it from Aileen!\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nAileen’s private life didn’t make the papers until she married Irving Lippmann on July 8, 1935. Here is a funny story how they tried to hide their marriage:\n\n— Blowouts blew up the secrecy surrounding Hollywood’s latest elope- merit today The elopers were Aileen Covington actress and Irving Lippman winner of an award for photography at the California Pacific International Exposition at San Diego They were married at Agua Caliente Mexico in the early morning hours With an 11 a m call to answer at Columbia :Studios they started back by automobile. At Oceanside they had a tire blowout and at San Clemente another The mishaps made them three hours late on the set To “square” themselves with Director Eddie Buzzell they had to disclose the elope1 inent Lippman and Miss Covington met a month ago\n\nNow something about Irving Isidore Lippmann. He was born on November 8, 1906 in Edendale, California, to Samuel and Celia Lippman. He had two older brothers, Nathaniel and Morris, and four sisters, Esther, Rae, Sophie and Lee and a younger brother who was a stillbirth. He grew up in California and became an assistant cameraman for Fatty Arbuckle productions when he was 16 years old in 1922. After being an assistant cameraman at Paramount he up ended as a cinematographer on TV shows like The Love Boat but is best known for his imaginative and prolific work as a unit stills photographer at Columbia Pictures, especially on Frank Capra films Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Lost Horizon. He was also a very prolific glamoru photographer, photographing major stars like Claudette Colbert, Ginger Rogers, Barbara Stanwyck and Jean Arthur.\n\nThe couple settled in Los Angeles, California, and Aileen gave up her movie work to become a housewife and support her husband in his career. WW2 started in 1939, and Lippman was drafted into the US Army and opened a Pictorial Service in Paris. He reached the rank of captain when he was discharged in 1946. Aileen was hardly idle during the war. She worked together as V riveting team in the Lockheed-Vega aircraft plant, helping turn out B-lTs and P-38’s. There she met and befriended Ruth St. Denis, one of the pioneers of dance and a major 20th century dance icon.\n\nSadly, after he returned from the war, the marriage started to disintegrate and they were divorced in 1947/48. Lippman would marry Charlotte S. Gluckman in 1960, but that marriage also ended in divorce. He died at the ripe of age of 100 on November 15, 2006.\n\nAfter her divorce, Aileen was looking for ways to earn a living. Her acting career long gone, she turned to her long time passions – golf and writing. Pretty soon she became a well respected sports writer, writing for local Californian newspapers and doing a weekly column. She became a very prominent member of the local golf set and made a solid living with her writings, making Aileen one of the few women in the 1950s who lived of sports writings. Really interesting!\n\nAileen married her second husband, Ewing Wilson Richardson, on July 16, 1949. Ewing was a oil supply salesman but was more prominent as a pro golfer. He was born on March 14, 1915, in Ryan, Oklahoma, to Robert Richardson and Bertha Conolly. He lived in Harris, Texas, before moving to Los Angeles. He was married once before, to Gail Foster, but tragically she died in the mid 1940s, They had a daughter, Elizabeth E., born in 1940.\n\nThe Richardsons lived in Los Angeles and enjoyed a happy marriage. Both were passionate about golf, played often, and spent many joyful days on the golf course.\n\nEwin Richardson died on June 30, 1981. Aileen continued living in California, enjoying her golden years.\n\nAileen Covington died on November 30, 1996, in Los Angeles, California."
