        "text": "Medieval Hungarian coins appear mainly in auctions of Hungarian and German dealers. Except for a few rarities, they are surprisingly affordable. The standard reference in English is Frynas (2015), but catalog references invariably cite Huszar (1979) in German or the monumental two-volume Corpus Nummorum Hungariae (1899-1907) by Laszlo Réthy in Hungarian. A valuable resource for collectors interested in this period is the booklet Reading Medieval Coins (2009) by Ralph Walker. Shields of arms appear frequently on medieval coins, so a good book on heraldry such as Slater (2013) is helpful.\n\nThe introduction of money in the form of standardised objects of value made of metal and bearing images marked a new phenomenon in the pre-Roman societies of Western and Central Europe. In the Late Iron Age, the Lower Rhine region formed part of the northern peripheral zone of the La Tene culture, whose influence in this region has emerged as stronger than was previously thought. This is reflected among other things in the large numbers of ‘Celtic’ coins from this region. Although very little was known about these coins until about , the number of coins in the archaeological record, as well as what we know about them, has increased dramatically in recent decades. This study seeks to survey these earliest coinages in the Lower Rhine region. We start with a few introductory remarks about the development of Celtic numismatics, and follow with a discussion of the research potential of coins from the Lower Rhine region. We then survey the evolution of coinage and coin production in t...\n\nSince 1982 thirty - one bronze cast coins of Selinus have been kept in the Martin-von-Wagner Museum, the University Museum in Wurzburg. The coins offer an important addition to the study of the fifth century coinage of Selinus since specimens of cast bronze coins from this mint are still relatively rare in collections and auction sale catalogues. The publication of these particular specimens invites us to revisit scholarship on this coinage to date and to explore what might be added by these coins.\n\nThis essay surveys the political historiography of the early medieval principality of Bavaria, particularly in three periods; that of the Bavarians’ emergence in the sixth century, the time of a complex interrelationship between Bavarians and Franks and their Agilolfing and Carolingian ruling houses in the eighth century, and the transitions of power from Charlemagne’s takeover of Bavaria in 788 and the transfer to a new Luitpolding duchy in 907. The Bavarian case serves as a useful counternarrative to those of larger peoples like the Franks or Lombards, and illustrates that the inheritance of Roman tradition, the relationship between rulers and ruled, and the creation and maintenance of ethnic identities could be flexible and complex in the early Middle Ages.\n\nAt an auction of the A.E. Cahn company in Frankfurt am Main in 1933, the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum (Mainz) bought about 150 Celtic coins that belonged to the great French collector F. de Saulcy. Some of the lots that entered the RGZM collection were fragments of treasures discovered in France in the 19th century. The article presents five small unpublished sets from the hoards of Avranches (7 coins), Moncontour (6), Morlaix (2), Tourdan (4) and Moirans (3)."
