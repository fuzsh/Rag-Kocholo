        "text": "The Kingdom of Poland, also known informally as the Regency Kingdom of Poland, was a short-lived polity that was proclaimed during World War I by the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire on November 5, 1916 on the territories of the formerly Russian-ruled Congress Poland held by the Central Powers as the Government General of Warsaw and became active on January 14, 1917.\n\nThis Kingdom was to be a puppet state that was to provide a buffer both geographically and politically between the Empires of Germany and Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire. It would be the first reappearance of Poland on the map of Europe after it had been carved up to other nations.\n\nPoland had disappeared from the map of Europe with the Partitions of Poland when three partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth took place toward the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of sovereign Poland and Lithuania for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by the Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures and annexations.\n\nThe First Partition was decided on August 5, 1772 after the Bar Confederation lost the war with Russia. The Second Partition occurred in the aftermath of the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Targowica Confederation of 1792 when Russian and Prussian troops entered the Commonwealth and the partition treaty was signed during the Grodno Sejm on January 23, 1793 (without Austria). The Third Partition took place on October 24, 1795, in reaction to the unsuccessful Polish Kościuszko Uprising the previous year. With this partition, the Commonwealth ceased to exist.\n\nRationale\n\nThe decision to propose the restoration of Poland after a century of partitions was taken up by the German policymakers in an attempt to legitimize further imperial presence in the occupied territories and create a buffer state to prevent future wars with Russia. The plan was followed by the German propaganda pamphlet campaign delivered to the Poles in 1915, claiming that the German soldiers were arriving as liberators to free Poland from subjugation by the Russian Empire.\n\nHowever, the German High Command under Erich Ludendorff also wanted to annex around 30,000 square kilometers of the territory of former Congress Poland, and planned to evict up to 3 million Poles and Jews to make room for German colonists in the so-called Polish Border Strip plan. The German government used punitive threats to force Polish landowners living in the German-occupied Baltic states to relocate and sell their Baltic property to the Germans in exchange for entry to Poland. Parallel efforts were made to remove Poles from Polish territories of the Prussian Partition.\n\nGermany\n\nWith onset of war in 1914, for the purposes of securing Germany’s eastern border against the Russian imperial army, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, the German chancellor, decided on the annexation of a specific strip of land from Congress Poland, known later on as the Polish Border Strip. In order to avoid adding the Polish population there to the population of imperial Germany, it was proposed that the Poles would be ethnically cleansed to a proposed new Polish state further east, while the strip would be resettled with Germans.\n\nGerman Emperor Wilhelm II conceived of creating a dependent Polish state from territory conquered from Russia. This new autonomous Kingdom of Poland would be ruled by a German prince and have its military, transportation, and economy controlled by Germany. Its army and railway network would be placed under Prussian command.\n\nCharles X (Charles Philippe, Count of Artois; October 9, 1757 – November 6, 1836) was King of France and Navarre from September 16, 1824 until August 2, 1830. An uncle of the uncrowned King Louis XVII and younger brother to reigning kings Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, he supported the latter in exile.\n\nAfter the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, Charles (as heir-presumptive) became the leader of the ultra-royalists, a radical monarchist faction within the French court that affirmed absolute monarchy by divine right and opposed the constitutional monarchy concessions towards liberals and the guarantees of civil liberties granted by the Charter of 1814. Charles gained influence within the French court after the assassination of his son Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, in 1820 and succeeded his brother Louis XVIII in 1824.\n\nHis reign of almost six years proved to be deeply unpopular amongst the liberals in France from the moment of his coronation in 1825, in which he tried to revive the practice of the royal touch. The governments appointed under his reign reimbursed former landowners for the abolition of feudalism at the expense of bondholders, increased the power of the Catholic Church, and reimposed capital punishment for sacrilege, leading to conflict with the liberal-majority Chamber of Deputies.\n\nKing Charles X also approved the French conquest of Algeria as a way to distract his citizens from domestic problems, and forced Haiti to pay a hefty indemnity in return for lifting a blockade and recognizing Haiti’s independence. He eventually appointed a conservative government under the premiership of Prince Jules de Polignac, who was defeated in the 1830 French legislative election.\n\nOrdinances were passed intended to quell popular discontent within the country but had the opposite effect. Journalists gathered in protest at the headquarters of the National daily, founded in January 1830 by Adolphe Thiers, Armand Carrel, and others. On Monday July 26, the government newspaper Le Moniteur Universel published the ordinances, and Thiers published a call to revolt signed by forty-three journalists: “The legal regime has been interrupted: that of force has begun… Obedience ceases to be a duty!” In the evening, crowds assembled in the gardens of the Palais-Royal, shouting “Down with the Bourbons!” and “Long live the Charter!”. As the police closed off the gardens, the crowd regrouped in a nearby street where they shattered streetlamps.\n\nThe next morning of July 27, police raided and shut down newspapers including Le National. When the protesters, who had re-entered the Palais-Royal gardens, heard of this, they threw stones at the soldiers, prompting them to shoot. By evening, the city was in chaos and shops were looted. On July 28, the rioters began to erect barricades in the streets. Marshal Marmont, who had been called in the day before to remedy the situation, took the offensive, but some of his men defected to the rioters, and by afternoon he had to retreat to the Tuileries Palace.\n\nThe members of the Chamber of Deputies sent a five-man delegation to Marmont, urging him to advise the king to assuage the protesters by revoking the four Ordinances. On Marmont’s request, the prime minister applied to the king, but Charles refused all compromise and dismissed his ministers that afternoon, realizing the precariousness of the situation. That evening, the members of the Chamber assembled at Jacques Laffitte’s house and elected Prince Louis Philippe d’Orléans to take the throne from King Charles X, proclaiming their decision on posters throughout the city. By the end of the day, the authority of Charles’ government had evaporated.\n\nA few minutes after midnight on July 31, warned by General Gresseau that Parisians were planning to attack the Saint-Cloud residence, Charles X decided to seek refuge in Versailles with his family and the court, with the exception of the Prince Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, who stayed behind with the troops, and the Duchess of Angoulême, who was taking the waters at Vichy. Meanwhile, in Paris, Louis Philippe assumed the post of Lieutenant General of the Kingdom. Charles’ road to Versailles was filled with disorganized troops and deserters.\n\nThe Marquis de Vérac, governor of the Palace of Versailles, came to meet the king before the royal cortège entered the town, to tell him that the palace was not safe, as the Versailles national guards wearing the revolutionary tricolor were occupying the Place d’Armes. Charles then set out for the Trianon at five in the morning. Later that day, after the arrival of the Duke of Angoulême from Saint-Cloud with his troops, Charles ordered a departure for Rambouillet, where they arrived shortly before midnight. On the morning of 1 August, the Duchess of Angoulême, who had rushed from Vichy after learning of events, arrived at Rambouillet.\n\nThe following day, August 2, King Charles X abdicated, bypassing his son the Dauphin, Prince Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême in favor of his grandson Prince Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, who was not yet ten years old. At first, the Duke of Angoulême (the Dauphin) refused to countersign the document renouncing his rights to the throne of France. According to the Duchess of Maillé, “there was a strong altercation between the father and the son. We could hear their voices in the next room.” Finally, after twenty minutes, the Duke of Angoulême reluctantly countersigned his father’s declaration:\n\n“My cousin, I am too deeply pained by the ills that afflict or could threaten my people, not to seek means of avoiding them. Therefore, I have made the resolution to abdicate the crown in favor of my grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux. The Dauphin, who shares my feelings, also renounces his rights in favor of his nephew.”\n\nIt will thus fall to you, in your capacity as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, to proclaim the accession of King Henri V to the throne. Furthermore, you will take all pertinent measures to regulate the forms of government during the new king’s minority. Here, I limit myself to stating these arrangements, as a means of avoiding further evils. You will communicate my intentions to the diplomatic corps, and you will let me know as soon as possible the proclamation by which my grandson will be recognized as king under the name of King Henri V.”\n\nFor the twenty minutes the Duke of Angoulême resisted signing the document of abdication he was technically King Louis XIX of France and Navarre.\n\nLouis Philippe ignored the document and on August 9, had himself proclaimed King of the French by the members of the Chamber.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: I meant to publish this yesterday. I am back from my short hiatus, I was having problems with my tablet.\n\nMaximilian II (July 31, 1527 – October 12 ,1576) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1564 until his death in 1576. A member of the Austrian House of Habsburg, he was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague on May 14, 1562 and elected King of Germany (King of the Romans) on November 24, 1562. On September 8, 1563 he was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia in the Hungarian capital Pressburg (Pozsony in Hungarian; now Bratislava, Slovakia). On July 25, 1564 he succeeded his father Emperor Ferdinand I as ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBiography\n\nMaximilian was born in Vienna, Austria, the eldest son of the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand I, younger brother of Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Princess Anne of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547). She was the oldest child and only daughter of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia (1456–1516) and his third wife Anne of Foix-Candale.\n\nKing Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia was her younger brother. Her paternal grandparents were King Casimir IV of Poland (of the Jagiellon dynasty) and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, one of the heiresses of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Elisabeth was the daughter of Albert II of Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nArchduke Maximilian was named after his great-grandfather, Emperor Maximilian I. At the time of his birth, his father Ferdinand succeeded his brother-in-law King Louis II of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia in the Kingdom of Bohemia and Croatia and the Kingdom of Hungary, laying the grounds for the global Habsburg monarchy.\n\nHeir apparent\n\nOn September 13, 1548 Emperor Charles V married Archduke Maximilian to Charles’s daughter (Maximilian’s cousin) Infanta Maria of Spain in the Castile residence of Valladolid. By the marriage his uncle intended to strengthen the ties with the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs, but also to consolidate his nephew’s Catholic faith. Archduke Maximilian temporarily acted as the Emperor’s representative in Spain, however not as stadtholder of the Habsburg Netherlands as he had hoped for.\n\nTo his indignation, King Ferdinand of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia appointed Archduke Maximilian’s younger brother, Archduke Ferdinand II of Further Austria, administrator in the Kingdom of Bohemia, nevertheless Maximilian’s right of succession as the future king was recognised in 1549. He returned to Germany in December 1550 in order to take part in the discussion over the Imperial succession.\n\nArchduke Maximilian’s relations with his uncle worsened, as Emperor Charles V, again embattled by rebellious Protestant princes led by Elector Maurice of Saxony, wished his son King Felipe II of Spain to succeed him as emperor. However, Charles’ brother King Ferdinand, who had already been designated as the next occupant of the imperial throne, and his son Archduke Maximilian objected to this proposal.\n\nArchduke Maximilian sought the support of the German princes such as Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria and even contacted Protestant leaders like Maurice of Saxony and Duke Christoph of Württemberg. At length a compromise was reached: King Felipe II was to succeed Ferdinand, but during the former’s reign Maximilian, as King of the Romans, was to govern Germany. This arrangement was not carried out, and is only important because the insistence of the emperor seriously disturbed the harmonious relations that had hitherto existed between the two branches of the Habsburg family; an illness that befell Maximilian in 1552 was attributed to poison given to him in the interests of his cousin and brother-in-law, King Felipe II of Spain.\n\nThe relationship between the two cousins was uneasy. While Felipe had been raised a Spaniard and barely travelled out of the kingdom during his life, Maximilian identified himself as the quintessential German prince and often displayed a strong dislike of Spaniards, whom he considered as intolerant and arrogant. While his cousin was reserved and shy, Maximilian was outgoing and charismatic.\n\nHis adherence to humanism and religious tolerance put him at odds with Felipe who was more committed to the defence of the Catholic faith. Also, he was considered a promising commander, while Felipe disliked war and only once personally commanded an army. Nonetheless, the two remained committed to the unity of their dynasty.\n\nThe religious views of Archduke Maximilian had always been somewhat uncertain, and he had probably learned something of Lutheranism in his youth; but his amicable relations with several Protestant princes, which began about the time of the discussion over the succession, were probably due more to political than to religious considerations. However, in Vienna he became very intimate with Sebastian Pfauser [de], a court preacher influenced by Heinrich Bullinger with strong leanings towards Lutheranism, and his religious attitude caused some uneasiness to his father.\n\nFears were freely expressed that he would definitely leave the Catholic Church, and when his father Ferdinand became emperor in 1558 he was prepared to assure Pope Paul IV that his son should not succeed him if he took this step. Eventually Maximilian remained nominally an adherent of the older faith, although his views were tinged with Lutheranism until the end of his life. After several refusals he consented in 1560 to the banishment of Pfauser, and began again to attend the Masses of the Catholic Church.\n\nReign\n\nIn November 1562 Maximilian was chosen King of the Romans, or German king, by the electoral college at Frankfurt, where he was crowned a few days later, after assuring the Catholic electors of his fidelity to their faith, and promising the Protestant electors that he would publicly accept the confession of Augsburg when he became emperor. He also took the usual oath to protect the Church, and his election was afterwards confirmed by the papacy. He was the first King of the Romans not to be crowned in Aachen. In September 1563 he was crowned King of Hungary by the Archbishop of Esztergom, Nicolaus Olahus, and on his father’s death, in July 1564, he succeeded to the empire and to the kingdoms of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia.\n\nMaximilian’s rule was shaped by the confessionalization process after the 1555 Peace of Augsburg. Though a Habsburg and a Catholic, he approached the Lutheran Imperial estates with a view to overcome the denominational schism, which ultimately failed. He also was faced with the ongoing Ottoman–Habsburg wars and rising conflicts with his Habsburg Spain cousins.\n\nAccording to Fichtner, Maximilian failed to achieve his three major aims: rationalizing the government structure, unifying Christianity, and evicting the Turks from Hungary. Peter Marshall opines that it is wrong to dismiss Maximilian as a failure. According to Marshall, through his religious tolerance as well as encouragement of arts and sciences, he succeeded in maintaining a precarious peace.\n\nEmperor Maximilian II died on October 12, 1576 in Regensburg while preparing to invade Poland. On his deathbed he refused to receive the last sacraments of the Church. He is buried in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.\n\nBy his wife Maria he had a family of ten sons and six daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Rudolf, who had been chosen king of the Romans in October 1575. Another of his sons, Matthias, also became emperor; three others, Ernest, Albrecht and Maximilian, took some part in the government of the Habsburg territories or of the Netherlands. His eldest daughter, Anna, married King Felipe II of Spain. Another daughter, Elizabeth, married King Charles IX of France.\n\nLouis III the Blind (c. 880 – June 5, 928) was the King of Provence from January 11, 887, King of Italy from October 12, 900, and briefly Holy Roman Emperor, as Louis III, between 901 and 905. His father was a Bosonid and his mother was a Carolingian.\n\nBorn c.880, Louis was the son of Boso, the usurper King of Provence, and Ermengard, the daughter of Emperor Louis II and his wife Engelberga, who was probably the daughter of Adelchis I of Spoleto and a member of one of the most powerful families in the Kingdom of Italy at that time, the Supponids. Ermengard was also a great-niece of Emperor Charles the Bald.\n\nAs a boy of seven, Louis succeeded to the throne of his father Boso as King of Provence upon Boso’s death on 11 January 887.\n\nKingdom of Burgundy – Provence\n\nShortly before his death in 855, Emperor Lothair I divided his Kingdom of Middle Francia among his three sons in three parts: Lotharingia, the Kingdom of Italy, and the regions of Lower Burgundy and Provence. The latter were left to the youngest son, thus known as Charles of Provence. This partition created more conflicts, as older Carolingians who ruled West Francia and East Francia viewed themselves as the true heirs of Middle Francia.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Charles the Bald in 877, followed by the death of his son Louis II the Stammerer two years later, the Frankish noble Boso of Provence proclaimed himself a “King of Burgundy and Provence” at Vienne in 879.\n\nThis kingdom lasted until Boso’s death in 887. in 888, Rudolph I of Burgundy of the Elder House of Welf carved out his own kingdom of Upper Burgundy, centered on Lake Geneva and including the lands around Besançon that later became the Franche-Comté.\n\nMeanwhile, Boso’s child son Louis, later known as Louis the Blind, became King of Lower Burgundy (Provence ) in Valence in 890. In 933, Rudolph’s son and heir Rudolph II acquired Lower Burgundy and merged the two kingdoms into a single Kingdom of Burgundy.\n\nThe kingdom Louis inherited was much smaller than his father’s, as it did not include Upper Burgundy (lost to Rudolph I of Burgundy), nor any of French Burgundy, absorbed by Richard the Justiciar, Duke of Burgundy. This meant that the Kingdom of Provence was restricted to the environs of Vienne. The Provençal barons elected Ermengard to act as his regent, with the support of Louis’s uncle, Richard the Justiciar.\n\nIn May, Ermengard traveled with Louis to the court of her relative, the Emperor Charles the Fat, and received his recognition of the young Louis as king. Charles adopted Louis as his son and put both mother and son under his protection.\n\nConflict with Berengar\n\nIn 900, Louis, as the grandson and heir of the Emperor Louis II, was invited into Italy by various lords, including Adalbert II, Margrave of Tuscany, who were suffering under the ravages of the Magyars and the incompetent rule of Berengar I.\n\nLouis thus marched his army across the Alps and defeated Berengar, chasing him from Pavia, the old Lombard capital, where, in the church of San Michele, Louis was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy on October 12, 900. He travelled onwards to Rome, where, in 901, he was crowned Emperor by Pope Benedict IV.\n\nHowever, his inability to stem the Magyar incursions and impose any meaningful control over northern Italy saw the Italian nobles quickly abandon his cause and once again align themselves with Berengar. In 902, Berengar defeated Louis’s armies and forced him to flee to Provence and promise never to return.\n\nIn 905, Louis, after again listening to the Italian nobles who were tired of Berengar’s rule, this time led by Adalbert I of Ivrea, launched another attempt to invade Italy. Once again throwing Berengar out of Pavia, he marched and also succeeded in taking Verona with only a small following, after receiving the promise of support from the bishop, Adalard.\n\nPartisans of Berengar in the town soon got word to Berengar of Louis’s exposed position at Verona, and his limited support. Berengar returned, accompanied by Bavarian troops, and entered Verona in the dead of night. Louis sought sanctuary at the church of St Peter.\n\nHowever , Emperor Louis III was captured, and on July 21, 905, he had his eyes put out (for breaking his oath) and was forced to relinquish his royal Italian and imperial crowns. Later, Berengar became Emperor. After this last attempt to restore Carolingian power over Italy, Louis III continued to rule Provence for over twenty years, though his cousin Hugh, Count of Arles, was the dominant figure in the territory.\n\nLouis returned to Vienne, his capital, and by 911, he had put most of the royal powers in the hands of Hugh. Hugh was made Margrave of Provence and Marquis of Vienne and moved the capital to Arles. As regent, Hugh married Louis’s sister Willa. Louis lived out his days until his death in obscurity, and through his life he continued to style himself as Roman Emperor. He was succeeded by his brother-in-law Hugh of Arles in 928.\n\nRobért II (c. 972 – July 20, 1031), called the Pious, or the Wise, was King of the Franks from 996 to 1031, the second King from the Capetian dynasty.\n\nRobért II’s exact date and birthplace are unknown, although historians have advocated for the year 972 and the city of Orléans (the capital of the Robertians from the 9th century onward). The only son of Hugh Capét, King of the Franks and Adelaide of Aquitaine, the daughter of William III, Duke of Aquitaine and Adele of Normandy, daughter of Rollo of Normandy.\n\nRobért II was named after his heroic ancestor Robrert the Strong, who had died fighting the Vikings in 866. His parents’ marriage produced at least two other daughters: Hedwig (wife of Reginar IV, Count of Hainaut) and Gisela (wife of Hugh I, Count of Ponthieu).\n\nIn the 10th century, the Robertians were the most powerful aristocratic family in the Kingdom of the Franks. In previous decades, two of its members, Odo (888) and Robért I (922), had ascended to the throne, displacing the ruling Carolingian dynasty. The principality of Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks and Robért II’s paternal grandfather, marked the apogee of the Robertians until his death in 956. In the middle of the 10th century, Hugh Capét succeeded as the head of the family.\n\nOnce Hugh Capét proposed the association of Robert to the throne, Archbishop Adalbero of Reims was reportedly hostile to this and, according to Richer of Reims, he replied to the king: “we do not have the right to create two kings in the same year” (on n’a pas le droit de créer deux rois la même année). It is believed that Gerbert of Aurillac (who was himself close to Borrell II, for a time his protector), would then have come to the aid of Hugh Capét to convince the Archbishop that the co-kinship was needed due to the purposed expedition to assist the Count of Barcelona, and to secure a stable transition of power. Under duress, Archbishop Adalbero finally consented.\n\nAfter Robért was crowned Junior King in 987, he assisted his father on military matters (notably during the two sieges of Laon, in 988 and 991). His solid education, provided by Gerbert of Aurillac (the future Pope Sylvester II) in Reims, allowed him to deal with religious questions of which he quickly became the guarantor (he headed the Council of Saint-Basle de Verzy in 991 and that of Chelles in 994). Continuing the political work of his father, after becoming sole ruler in 996, he managed to maintain the alliance with the Duchy of Normandy and the County of Anjou and thus was able to contain the ambitions of Count Odo II of Blois.\n\nRobért II was a devout Catholic, hence his sobriquet “the Pious.” He was musically inclined, being a composer, chorister, and poet, and made his palace a place of religious seclusion where he conducted the matins and vespers in his royal robes. Robért II’s reputation for piety also resulted from his lack of toleration for heretics, whom he harshly punished.\n\nHe is said to have advocated forced conversions of local Jewry. He supported riots against the Jews of Orléans who were accused of conspiring to destroy the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Furthermore, Robért II reinstated the Roman imperial custom of burning heretics at the stake. In 1030–1031, Robért confirmed the foundation of Noyers Abbey.\n\nHugh Capét died on October 14, 996 in Paris, and was interred in the Saint Denis Basilica. His son Robért II continued to reign as the sole King of the Franks.\n\nRobért II distinguished himself with an extraordinarily long reign for the time. His 35-year-long reign was marked by his attempts to expand the royal domain by any means, especially by his long struggle to gain the Duchy of Burgundy (which ended in 1014 with his victory) after the death in 1002 without male descendants of his paternal uncle Duke Henri I, after a war against Otto-William of Ivrea, Henri I’s stepson and adopted by him as his heir. His policies earned him many enemies, including three of his sons.\n\nThe marital setbacks of Robért II (he married three times, annulling two of these and attempting to annul the third, prevented only by the Pope’s refusal to accept a third annulment), strangely contrasted with the pious aura, bordering on the holiness, which his biographer Helgaud of Fleury was willing to lend him in his work “Life of King Robért the Pious” (Epitoma vitæ regis Roberti pii).\n\nHis life was then presented as a model to follow, made of innumerable pious donations to various religious establishments, of charity towards the poor and, above all, of gestures considered sacred, such as the healing of certain lepers. Robért II was the first sovereign considered to be a “miracle worker”. The end of his reign revealed the relative weakness of the sovereign, who had to face the revolt of his third wife Constance and then of his own sons (Henri and Robért) between 1025 and 1031.\n\nPrince Henri was born in Reims, and was the son of King Robért II by his third wife Constance of Arles (986–1034). In the early-Capetian tradition, Prince Henri was crowned King of the Franks at the Cathedral of Reims on May 14, 1027, while his father still lived. He had little influence and power until he became sole ruler on his father’s death four years later on July 20, 1031.\n\nPrincess Augusta of Cambridge (July, 19, 1822 – December 5, 1916) was a member of the British Royal Family, a granddaughter of George III. She married into the Grand Ducal House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and became the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrincess Augusta was born on July 19, 1822 at the Palace of Montbrillant, Hanover. Her father was Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the seventh son of George III of the United Kingdom and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Princess Augusta’s mother was Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, third daughter of Landgrave Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel, and his wife, Princess Caroline of Nassau-Usingen.\n\nThrough her father, Princess Augusta of Cambridge was a great-granddaughter of George II of Great Britain, her grandmother being George II’s daughter Princess Mary. Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel’s uncle, (her father’s older brother) was the Landgrave Wilhelm I of Hesse-Cassel. In 1803, her uncle’s title was raised to Elector of Hesse—whereby the entire Cassel branch of the Hesse dynasty gained an upward notch in hierarchy.\n\nAs a male line granddaughter of the British monarch, Princess Augusta was titled as a British Princess with the style of Royal Highness. The young princess was baptized at the same palace on August 16, 1822, by Rev Edward Curtis Kemp (Chaplain to the British Ambassador to the Court of Berlin, The Rt. Hon. Sir George Rose).\n\nThe Princess Augusta spent her earlier years in Hanover, where her father was the viceroy on behalf of his brother, King George IV of the United Kingdom.\n\nPrincess Augusta had one brother, Prince George, later 2nd Duke of Cambridge; and one sister, Princess Mary Adelaide, later Duchess of Teck. As such, Princess Augusta was an aunt to Princess Mary of Teck, later Queen Consort of George V of the United Kingdom.\n\nAdditionally, Princess Augusta was a first cousin through her father to Queen Victoria and through her mother a first cousin to Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel, the wife of King Christian IX of Denmark. This meant Princess Augusta was a first cousin once removed to both Princess Alexandra of Denmark and her husband King Edward VII of United Kingdom.\n\nWith her mother, she was part of the royal party at the 1838 coronation of Queen Victoria.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn June 28, 1843, Princess Augusta married her first cousin, Friedrich Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, at Buckingham Palace, London. (The two were also second cousins on their fathers’ side.) Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel was born in Neustrelitz, the son of Grand Duke Georg of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Marie of Hesse-Cassel. He spent his youth in Neustrelitz and later went to study history and jurisprudence in University of Bonn where he befriended Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nUpon marriage, Augusta became the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and, on September 6, 1860, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz following the death of her father-in-law, Grand Duke Georg of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nThe marriage of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess produced two children:\n\n1. Duke Friedrich Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (born and died in London, January 13, 1845)\n\n2. Duke Adolph Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Strelitz ( July 22, 1848 – June 11, 1914); succeeded his father as Grand Duke Adolph Friedrich V of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in May 1904.\n\nLater life\n\nAlthough she spent most of her adult life in Germany, the Grand Duchess Augusta retained close personal ties to the British Royal Family. She frequently visited her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, at her Kensington Palace apartments.\n\nAfter her mother’s death in 1889, the Grand Duchess acquired a house in London’s Buckingham Gate area, where she spent a portion of the year until advanced old age made it impossible for her to travel abroad.\n\nIn making preparations for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1901, the Duke of Norfolk consulted her on matters of etiquette and attire. This was due to her presence at the coronation of King William IV and Queen Adelaide seventy-one years earlier. She was nine years old at the time and kissed the Queen’s hand. She was also able to provide details of the coronation of Queen Victoria.\n\nThe Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was particularly close to her niece, the future Queen Mary. However, old age prevented her from attending the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary on June 22, 1911.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I, the British Government suspended the annuity she had been receiving as a member of the British Royal Family under the Annuity, Duchess of Mecklenburgh Strelitz Act 1843. During the war, the Swedish Embassy passed letters from the Queen to her aunt, who still lived in Germany.\n\nAs an elderly lady, she was known for being cantankerous. She was also known as being quite shrewd and intelligent. In his book, Queen Mary (London, 1959), the Queen’s official biography, James Pope-Hennessy reports that the Queen’s aunt Augusta was not fond of the new science of photography, fearing it would intrude deeply into the private lives of Royal personages.\n\nThe Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz died on December 5, 1916 in Neustrelitz and was buried in Mirow. As the longest-lived grandchild of George III, she was the last link to the British branch of the House of Hanover.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was 94 years, 4 months and 16 days old, making her the longest-lived British princess by blood, until Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, a male-line granddaughter of Queen Victoria, surpassed her in 1977.\n\nIn 1218, the situation only got worse for Jews as the thirteenth century progressed when\n\nHenry III of England proclaimed the Edict of the Badge requiring Jews to wear a marking badge. Taxation grew increasingly intense.\n\nBetween 1219 and 1272, 49 levies were imposed on Jews for a total of 200,000 marks, a vast sum of money. In 1222, Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, convened the Synod of Oxford which passed a set of laws that forbade Jews to build new synagogues, own slaves, or mix with Christians in England.\n\nHenry III imposed greater segregation and reinforced the wearing of badges in the 1253 Statute of Jewry. He endorsed the myth of Jewish child murders. Meanwhile, his court and major Barons bought Jewish debts with the intention of securing lands of lesser nobles through defaults.\n\nThe Second Barons’ War in the 1260s brought a series of pogroms aimed at destroying the evidence of these debts and Jewish communities in major towns, including London (where 500 Jews died), Worcester, Canterbury, and many other towns.\n\nThe first major step towards expulsion took place in 1275, with the Statute of the Jewry. The statute outlawed all lending at interest and gave Jews fifteen years to readjust. In 1282, John Peckham, the Archbishop of Canterbury, closed all synagogues in his diocese.\n\nIn the duchy of Gascony in 1287, King Edward ordered the local Jews expelled. All their property was seized by the crown and all outstanding debts payable to Jews were transferred to the King’s name. In late 1286, Pope Honorius IV addressed a special rescript to the Archbishops of York and Canterbury claiming that the Jews had an evil effect on religious life in England through free interaction with Christians and called for action to be taken to prevent it.\n\nThe Church responded with the Synod of Exeter in 1287, restating the Church laws against commensality between Jews and Christians and prohibiting Jews from holding public office, have Christian servants, or appear in public during Easter. Jewish physicians were also forbidden to practice and the ordinances of the Synod of Oxford of 1222 which prohibited the construction of new synagogues and the entry of Jews into Churches were restated.\n\nBy the time he returned to England in 1289, King Edward was deeply in debt. The next summer he summoned his knights to impose a steep tax. To make the tax more palatable, Edward, in exchange, essentially offered to expel all Jews. The heavy tax was passed, and three days later, on July 18th the Edict of Expulsion was issued.\n\nApology\n\nIn July 2021, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, announced that the Church of England would in 2022 offer a formal “act of repentance”, on the 800th anniversary of the Synod of Oxford in 1222, which passed a set of laws that restricted Jews’ rights to engage with Christians in England and eventually led to the expulsion of 1290. Historically, the Synod predated the Church of England’s split from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534, but the Archbishopric of Canterbury dates to before 600 AD.\n\nThe service was held in May 2022.\n\nPrince Charles was born in Flanders to Habsburg Archduke Philipp the Handsome of Austria, King of Castile and Duke of Burgundy, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Mary Burgundy. During his childhood and teen years, Charles lived in Mechelen together with his sisters Archduchess’ Mary, Eleanor, and Isabella at the court of his aunt Archduchess Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy.\n\nPrince Charles’ grandmother, Mary of Burgundy was the only child of Charles I the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and his wife Isabella of Bourbon. Mary inherited the Burgundian lands at the age of 19 upon the death of her father in the Battle of Nancy on January 5, 1477. Mary was the wife of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nThe Habsburg Netherlands was the Renaissance period fiefs in the Low Countries held by the Holy Roman Empire’s House of Habsburg. Their rule began in 1482, when the last Valois-Burgundy ruler of the Netherlands, Mary, Duchess of Burgundy died on March 27th of that year.\n\nThe Low Countries ruled by Duchess Mary of Burgundy consisted of a collection of states that included the duchies of Limburg, Brabant, Luxembourg, the counties of Namur, Holland, Hainaut.\n\nBurgundy and the associated Low Countries was inherited by Mary of Burgundy’s son Archduke Philipp the Handsome of Austria who succeeded as Duke Philipp IV of Burgundy. As previously mentioned, Philipp became King Felipe I of Castile through his marriage (Jure uxoris) to Queen Joanna of Castile, younger child of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain. Through his father Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor from 1493, Philipp was a Habsburg scion, and so the period of the Habsburg Netherlands began\n\nAs the heir of his four grandparents, Prince Charles inherited all his family dominions at a young age. After the death of his father Archduke Philipp in 1506, he inherited the Habsburg Netherlands, originally held by his paternal grandmother Mary.\n\nOn July 18, 1507, In Brussels, Prince Charles is crowned as Duke Charles II of Burgundy and Count of Flanders, as well as Lord of the Netherlands, a year after inheriting the title. Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of Tournai, Artois, Utrecht, Groningen, and Guelders. The Seventeen Provinces had been unified by Charles’s Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were fiefs of either France or the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAfter the death of Philipp (Felipe I) of Castile, in September 1506, Castile was in crisis as his former father-in-law, King Fernando II of Aragon, had no legal position in Castile, with the cortes of Toro recognizing Joanna and her children as heirs and therefore Fernando II left Castile in July 1506.\n\nQueen Joanna was allegedly mentally unstable, and Joanna’s and Philipp’s son, Charles,was only six years old. Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, the Chancellor of the Kingdom, was made regent, but the upper nobility reasserted itself. King Fernando led an army against Pedro Fernández de Córdoba y Pacheco, the marquis of Priego of Córdoba, who had seized control there by force.\n\nAs the husband of Queen Isabella I of Castile, he was also King of Castile from 1475 to 1504 (as Fernando V). He reigned jointly with Isabella over a dynastically unified Spain; together they are known as the Catholic Monarchs. Fernando is considered the de facto first king of Spain, and was described as such during his reign, even though, legally, Castile and Aragon remained two separate kingdoms until they were formally united by the Nueva Planta decrees issued between 1707 and 1716.\n\nWith the death of his grandfather, King Fernando II-V of Aragon and Castile in 1516, Charles inheriting the dynastic union formed by his maternal grandparents Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon and he became King Carlos I of Spain as co-monarch of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon with his mother, who was deemed incapable of ruling due to mental illness.\n\nThe Spanish inheritance, included Spain as well as the Castilian possessions in the Americas (the Spanish West Indies and the Province of Tierra Firme) and the Aragonese kingdoms of Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia in Italy.\n\nAt the death of his paternal grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian in 1519, he inherited Austria and was elected to succeed him as Holy Roman Emperor. He adopted the Imperial name of Emperor Charles V as his main title, and styled himself as a new Charlemagne.\n\nThe Edict of Expulsion was a royal decree issued by Edward I of England on July 18, 1290 expelling all Jews from the Kingdom of England. King Edward told the sheriffs of all counties he wanted all Jews expelled by no later than All Saints’ Day (November 1) that year. The expulsion edict remained in force for the rest of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe edict was not an isolated incident, but the culmination of over 200 years of increasing antisemitism in England. The edict was eventually overturned more than 350 years later, during the Protectorate when Oliver Cromwell permitted the resettlement of the Jews in England in 1657.\n\nBackground\n\nThe first Jewish communities of significant size came to England with William the Conqueror in 1066, when William issued an invitation to the Jews of Rouen to move to England, probably because he wanted feudal dues to be paid to the royal treasury in coin rather than in kind (which at the time meant paying a debt with goods and services rather than with money), and for this purpose it was necessary to have a body of men scattered through the country who would supply quantities of coin.\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest, William instituted a feudal system in the country, whereby all estates formally belonged to the Crown; the king then appointed lords over these vast estates, but they were subject to duties and obligations (financial and military) to the king. Under the lords were other subjects such as serfs, who were bound and obliged to their lords and their lords’ obligations. Merchants had a special status in the system, as did Jews.\n\nJews were declared to be direct subjects of the king, unlike the rest of the population. This was an ambivalent legal position for the Jewish population, in that they were not tied to any particular lord but were subject to the whims of the king, and it could be either advantageous or disadvantageous. Every successive king formally reviewed a royal charter, granting Jews the right to remain in England. Jews did not enjoy any of the guarantees of the Magna Carta of 1215.\n\nEconomically, Jews played a key role in the country. The Church then strictly forbade the lending of money for profit, creating a vacuum in the economy of Europe that Jews filled because of extreme discrimination in every other economic area, as Jews were prohibited from practicing any art or craft, which were under the monopoly of Christian guilds.\n\nCanon law was not considered applicable to Jews, and Judaism does not forbid loans with interest between Jews and non-Jews. Taking advantage of their unique status as his direct subjects, the King could appropriate Jewish assets in the form of taxation. He levied heavy taxes on Jews at will, without having to summon Parliament.\n\nIsabella Romola de’ Medici (August 31, 1542 – July 16, 1576) was the daughter of Cosimo I de’ Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Eleonora di Toledo. Beautiful, intelligent, witty and refined, she is often referred to as the Star of the House of Medici (La Stella di Casa Medici), in recognition of “her playfulness, vibrancy, often sarcastic sense of humour, sharpness and interest in a huge variety of topics – not to mention the great parties she held”.\n\nShe received a humanist education alongside her brother, Francesco de’ Medici, who succeeded their father as the Grand Duke of Tuscany. To secure a relationship with the powerful Roman Orsinis, Isabella’s father arranged her marriage to Paolo Giordano I Orsini when she was 16.\n\nShe remained in her father’s household after her marriage, giving her an unusual degree of independence for a woman of her period. Following the death of her father, Isabella was probably murdered by her husband, with the complicity of her brother, and in retribution for her relationship with Paolo Giordano’s cousin Troilo Orsini.\n\nBiography\n\nIsabella was born in Florence where, with her brothers and sisters, she lived first in the Palazzo Vecchio and later in the Palazzo Pitti, spending much of her time as a child at father’s ancestral country home, Villa di Castello. The Medici children were educated at home by tutors in a range of subjects such as classics, languages, and arts.\n\nFrom an early age Isabella showed a great love for music, which in her adulthood she used as means for self-expression, according to biographer Caroline Murphy. A great beauty, she had a lively, high-spirited and impulsive character that was commented on by courtiers.\n\nIn 1553, at age 11 Isabella was betrothed to 12-year-old Paolo Giordano Orsini, in line for the Duchy of Bracciano in southern Tuscany, a liaison Isabella’s father felt necessary to secure his southern border and his relationship with the ancient Roman Orsini family.\n\nThe two married in 1558, in a semi-private ceremony, at Villa di Castello. Paolo left the following day. Concerned by the spending habits of his new son-in-law, Cosimo decided to keep his daughter and her 50,000 scudi dowry in Florence, giving her greater freedom and control over her own affairs than was customary for Florentine women of the time.\n\nFollowing her mother’s death, she acted as first lady of Florence for a time, displaying the de’ Medici aptitude for politics. She suffered several miscarriages and remained childless until her late twenties. Her daughter Francesca Eleonora (known as Nora), was born in 1571 and eventually married her cousin Alessandro Sforza. Her son Virginio was born in 1572 and eventually inherited his father’s dukedom.\n\nIsabella’s free-spirited personality created rumours with regard to the nature of her relationship with Troilo Orsini, Paolo Giordano’s cousin, who was charged with looking after her while her husband tended to military duties.\n\nOn July 16, 1576 Isabella died unexpectedly at the Medici villa in Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday. According to her brother, the grandduke, this occurred “while she was washing her hair in the morning … She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees, having immediately fallen dead.”\n\nHowever, the official version of events was not generally believed, and the Ferrarese ambassador, Ercole Cortile, obtained information that Isabella was “strangled at midday” by her husband in the presence of several named servants.\n\nIsabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family, her cousin Leonora, having died of a similar “accident” only a few days before. Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed Isabella, in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with Troilo Orsini, or that he acted on instructions of the Grandduke Francesco, Isabella’s brother.\n\nOne scholar, Elisabetta Mori, has argued that Isabella de’ Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici."
