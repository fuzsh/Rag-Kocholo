        "text": "The New York Times, April 1st 1951\n\nRalph Forbes Dies: Stage, Film Actor\n\nLondon-born player got his first role\n\nin US in 1924- Was in 50 pictures\n\nRalph Forbes, an actor who had appeared in important roles on the stage and screen almost continuously since he came here from England in 1924, died yesterday in Montefiore Hospital, the Bronx, after an illness of several weeks. He was last seen here two years ago in Sir Cedric Hardwickeï¿½s revival of Shawï¿½s play, ï¿½Caesar and Cleopatraï¿½.\n\nBorn in London, a son of E.J. Taylor, Mr. Forbes adopted the maiden surname of his mother, Mary Forbes, a well-known English actress now in Hollywood. The son did his first screen acting in the film version of ï¿½Brown Sugarï¿½, and first attracted attention on the stage in ï¿½The Flameï¿½, performed at Wyndhamï¿½s Theatre in London in 1924.\n\nThat autumn he was brought to New York to support Violet Vanbrugh in ï¿½Havocï¿½, which soon closed. He was engaged at once as leading man for Ruth Chatterton, star of ï¿½The Magnolia Ladyï¿½. They fell in love off the stage as well as on and were married in December, 1924.\n\nThe couple acted together in ï¿½The Little Ministerï¿½ and ï¿½The Man With A Load Of Mischiefï¿½ during the next two seasons, and then Mr. Forbes went to Hollywood, where he appeared in more than fifty films.\n\nMiss Chatterton and Mr. Forbes were divorced in 1932. Two years later he married Heather Angel, stage and screen actress. They were divorced in 1941. In 1946 he married Dora L. Sayers, also an actress. In 1943 he toured with his first wife in Noel Cowardï¿½s ï¿½Private Livesï¿½.\n\nAmong the plays in which Mr. Forbes appeared in New York were: ï¿½The Doctorï¿½s Dilemmaï¿½, with Katharine Cornell; ï¿½Hedda Gablerï¿½, with Katina Paxinou; ï¿½A Kiss for Cinderellaï¿½, with Luise Rainer; a Theatre Guild revival of ï¿½You Never Can Tellï¿½, and ï¿½Second Best Bedï¿½.\n\nThe long list of his silent and talking films included ï¿½Beau Gesteï¿½, ï¿½The Little Ministerï¿½, ï¿½Bachelor Fatherï¿½, ï¿½Bombay Mailï¿½, ï¿½The Green Goddessï¿½, ï¿½Her Wedding Nightï¿½, ï¿½The Magnificent Fraudï¿½, ï¿½Frenchmanï¿½s Creekï¿½, ï¿½Stage Doorï¿½, ï¿½The Last of Mrs Cheyneyï¿½, ï¿½If I Were Kingï¿½, ï¿½The Fountainï¿½, ï¿½Mary of Scotlandï¿½ and the Norma Shearer version of ï¿½Romeo and Julietï¿½.\n\nBesides his wife and his mother, Mr. Forbes leaves two sisters, Brenda Forbes, actress, who was in the recent ï¿½Ring Round the Moonï¿½, and Mrs. Douglas Young of London."
