For the soundtrack, see Ralph Breaks the Internet (soundtrack).\n\n2018 animated film produced by Walt Disney Animation StudiosTemplate:SHORTDESC:2018 animated film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet is a 2018 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the sequel to the 2012 film Wreck-It Ralph, making it Disney's 57th feature-length animated film. The film was directed by Rich Moore and Phil Johnston (who wrote the screenplay with Pamela Ribon and his directorial debut) and executive-produced by John Lasseter, Chris Williams and Jennifer Lee.[lower-alpha 1] It features voice work by John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Ed O'Neill (reprising their roles from the first film), with Alan Tudyk returning to voice a new character and new additions to the cast that include Gal Gadot, Taraji P. Henson and Alfred Molina.\n\nThe first discussions about a sequel to Wreck-It Ralph began in October 2012, and the new installment went through three different scripts before the filmmakers settled on the final plot. When the film was officially announced in June 2016 as Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2, much of the original cast confirmed they had signed on, with new cast members added in 2018.[7][8] It is Walt Disney Animation Studios' first animated film sequel to be created by the original film's writing and directing team and is the first sequel from the studio since 2000's Fantasia 2000.[7]\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on November 5, 2018 and was released in the United States on November 21, 2018. The film has grossed over $529Template:Nbspmillion worldwide and it has received mostly positive reviews from critics, who called it a \"worthy successor\" and praised the animation, humor, characters, and plot, as well as the vocal performances of Reilly and Silverman.[9][10] The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 91st Academy Awards, 76th Golden Globe Awards, and 24th Critics' Choice Awards, but lost to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\n\nPlot\n\nOver the last six years, Wreck-it Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz have stayed best friends and hang out after work in Litwak's Arcade. Vanellope expresses how bored she has become of Sugar Rush's tracks, so Ralph sneaks into the game and makes a new track for her. The arcade player fights Vanellope's control, and causes the cabinet's steering wheel to break off. As the company that made Sugar Rush is defunct, and the cost of a replacement wheel on eBay too high, Litwak decides to ship Sugar Rush away. Ralph and Vanellope help to evacuate the game before it is unplugged, and with Felix and Calhoun's help, find homes for all its citizens as a short term measure as they figure out how to save the game. After talking with Felix, Ralph decides to grab Vanellope and travel to the Internet via Litwak's new router.\n\nWith the help of the search engine KnowsMore, they are directed to eBay. They end up winning the auction for the wheel, but they unintentionally spike the price to more than Template:USD. They are given 24 hours to come up with the funds. On the way out, they run into J.P. Spamley who offers them a lucrative job of stealing the car from Shank, the lead character in Slaughter Race. Entering that game, Vanellope becomes enthralled with the racing-oriented game. They steal Shank's car, but she stops them before they can leave the game with it, recognizing Vanellope's driving talent. To help, Shank makes a viral video of Ralph and uploads it to BuzzzTube, and tells them to check with BuzzzTube's operator, Yesss, about getting money for it. At BuzzzTube, Yesss is elated by how popular Ralph's video is, and they come up with the idea of making more videos, which if given enough views, will earn them the money for the wheel in no time. Vanellope offers to help advertize the videos, and Ralph has Yesss send her to \"Oh My Disney\". There, Vanellope befriends the Disney Princesses, being encouraged by them to address her sense of unfulfillment and reaching a musical epiphany.\n\nRalph soon has made enough money, but cannot find Vanellope. He contacts her through a device Yesss had given them, and finds Vanellope talking with Shank about staying in Slaughter Race, having found her epiphany there. Ralph asks Spamley for a way to draw Vanellope out of the game, and he takes him to the Dark Net vendor Double Dan. Dan provides Ralph with a virus, Arthur, that feeds off insecurities and replicates them. When Ralph unleashes Arthur into Slaughter Race, Shank and the others help Vanellope to escape before the game resets. Vanellope assumes that the crash was her fault, but Ralph confesses to her that the crash was his fault. Outraged, Vanellope ends her friendship with Ralph and throws away the hero cookie medal. Arthur scans Ralph and clones his personality flaws and starts making duplicates of Ralph, all wanting to keep Vanellope for themselves. Ralph finds the medal, but it's broken in two.\n\nThe Internet is soon overrun by Ralph clones in a DOS attack, all chasing after Vanellope. Ralph saves her, but the clones form a giant Ralph monster that seizes them both. Ralph comes to accept that Vanellope can make her own choices, letting go of his insecurities. This causes the giant Ralph monster and the clones to disappear. Ralph is caught in mid-air with help from the Disney Princesses. Ralph gives the broken in half medal to Vanellope and they bid each other a tearful farewell as Shank has arranged for Vanellope to respawn in Slaughter Race. Back in the arcade, Sugar Rush has been repaired. Ralph partakes in healthy social activities as he tells Vanellope over video chat. After hanging up, Ralph looks contently towards the sunrise then goes back to work.\n\nVoice cast\n\nJohn C. Reilly as Ralph,[11] a gigantic but soft-hearted man who is the antagonist of the arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr.\n\nSarah Silverman as Vanellope von Schweetz,[12] a glitchy racer who is the main character and princess of Sugar Rush and Ralph's best friend.\n\nGal Gadot as Shank, a tough and talented NPC racer in Slaughter Race,[13] a racing-centered MMORPG introduced in the film.\n\nTaraji P. Henson as Yesss, an algorithm that determines the trending videos on BuzzzTube[14] (a portmanteau of YouTube and BuzzFeed).[15] Parts of her character were modeled after Cruella de Vil, as both characters are seen as fashionable.[16]\n\nJack McBrayer as Felix, a repairman who is the protagonist and playable character of Fix-It Felix Jr., as well as the husband of Calhoun.\n\nJane Lynch as Calhoun, the lead character of Hero's Duty and Felix's wife.\n\nMelissa Villase√±or as Taffyta Muttonfudge, a racer of Sugar Rush.\n\nAlan Tudyk as KnowsMore, a character representing a search engine of the same name, with an over-aggressive autofill.[14] The character design was mainly inspired by that of the UPA \"limited animation\" films, as well as Professor Owl from the Ward Kimball-directed Adventures in Music shorts.[17] Tudyk previously voiced King Candy in the first film.[14][18]\n\nAlfred Molina as Double Dan, a half-worm virus creator who inhabits the Dark Web.[19]\n\nMolina also voices Double Dan's conjoined brother Little Dan.\n\nEd O'Neill as Mr. Litwak,[1]:3 owner of Litwak's Family Fun Center & Arcade.\n\nBill Hader (uncredited) as J.P. Spamley, a personification of clickbait pop-up ads represented as a desperate salesman who can't make a sale.[1]:24[20]\n\nJohn DiMaggio as Arthur,[1]:4 an insecurity virus. DiMaggio previously voiced Beard Papa in the first film.\n\nAll of the characters in the Disney Princess line appear along with Anna and Elsa from Frozen.[21][22][23] They were all voiced by their traditional voice actresses,[21][22] except for Cinderella and Aurora, who were voiced by their current voice actresses Jennifer Hale and Kate Higgins, respectively,[23] and Snow White, who was voiced by screenwriter Pamela Ribon[24] as opposed to Katherine Von Till.[25] Additionally, Rajah (Jasmine's pet tiger), Meeko (Pocahontas' pet raccoon), Cinderella's mice (including Jaq and Gus) and her bird companions, and Prince Naveen (in frog form) also appear in the film.[26]\n\nSeveral characters from other films and media also cameo with their original or current voice actors, such as Roger Craig Smith as Sonic the Hedgehog, Maurice LaMarche as Tapper, Brad Garrett as Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh and Anthony Daniels as C-3PO from Star Wars, while recordings of Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear and Vin Diesel as Groot are respectively recycled from Toy Story and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.[1]:4\n\nAdditionally, Sean Giambrone (English YouTuber Daniel Middleton/DanTDM in the UK version, but not on the UK home release)[27] voices the eboy, and Flula Borg voices Maybe, an algorithm who is an assistant to Yesss.[1]:3[28] Ali Wong, Timothy Simons, GloZell Green and Hamish Blake respectively voice Felony, Butcher Boy, Little Debbie, and Pyro, all of which are other characters in Slaughter Race as Shank's racing crew.[1]:3\n\nThe film's directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston voice bidders at an eBay auction, in addition to reprising their roles as Sour Bill, Zangief (Moore) and the Surge Protector (Johnston), respectively.[1]:4[29] YouTube personalities Colleen Ballinger, Dani Fernandez, and Tiffany Herrera also voice cameos.[28]\n\nPopular culture cameos and references\n\nSimilar to the first film, Ralph Breaks the Internet includes a number of cameos and references to video games and various Disney properties, including their own films, Pixar films, and the Star Wars, Marvel Comics, and The Muppets franchises.[23]\n\nThe band Imagine Dragons (whose song \"Zero\" is featured in a trailer for the film, as well as its soundtrack) make a cameo appearance in the film, with the members voicing themselves.[1]:4[30] The video game Fortnite Battle Royale is briefly shown, including its battle bus and its Floss dance emote.[31]\n\nStan Lee, Marvel Comics' former writer, editor and publisher, makes a cameo appearance in the film talking to Iron Man.[32][33]\n\nThe filmmakers revealed that the film originally featured a joke about Kylo Ren being a \"spoiled child\", which was later cut from the film by request from Lucasfilm because it would undermine his role as a villain.[34] Also cut from the film was C-3PO being mockingly called R2-D2 and BB-8 by the princesses.[22] Additionally, the film would originally include The Golden Girls characters, but it was later cut because the directors felt it was a bizarre juxtaposition.[35]\n\nThe legion of Ralph clones, which forms a gigantic Ralph monster, resembles the King Kong character from various films. During the production, the giant form was dubbed \"Kong Ralph\" (after King Kong) and \"Ralphzilla\" (after Godzilla).[36][37]\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn October 2012, director Rich Moore said that he and Disney had ideas about a sequel that would bring the characters up to date and explore online gaming and console gaming.[38] Moore stated that many of the crew and voice cast were open to the sequel, believing that they have \"barely scratched the surface\" of the video game world they envisioned. He also stated that he planned to include Mario and Tron in the sequel.[39][40] (In the end, only the latter appeared briefly, serving as a minor foreshadowing plot device.) In 2014, the first film's composer Henry Jackman said that a story for the sequel was being written.[41] In July 2015, John C. Reilly said he had signed on to reprise his role of Ralph in a projected sequel.[11]\n\nOn March 24, 2016, Moore stated that a sequel was still being planned. Moore specifically stated that a sequel would include an appearance from Mario, citing a \"good relationship with Nintendo\".[42] On June 30, 2016, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced that the sequel would be released on March 9, 2018, with Reilly, Moore and writer Phil Johnston attached, and that it would focus on \"Ralph leaving the arcade and wrecking the Internet\".[43]\n\nOn March 28, 2017, the sequel's title was officially announced as Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2, with Moore returning as director joined by the first film's co-writer, Phil Johnston, in his directing debut in an animated film and Clark Spencer also returning as producer.[44] In July 2018, Disney removed the Wreck-It Ralph 2 subtitle from the film's title.[45]\n\nWriting\n\nTwo working versions of the script had been scrapped before settling on the one used for the film, according to head writer Josie Trinidad. In one version, Vanellope had become self-absorbed by the Internet, gaining popularity and becoming a celebrity among the users. Ralph had been thrown in jail where he met the search engine Knowsmore, and they had partnered together to escape prison and help bring Vanellope back to her normal self. A second version had Ralph becoming an Internet-famous celebrity, and would have been challenged by an anti-virus program named Bev that served as a super cop and would have been the story's villain. Trinidad said neither of these versions captured what they felt was the centerpiece of the sequel, being how Ralph and Vanellope reacted to the new world of the Internet and realizing they have separate paths going forward.[46]\n\nProducer Clark Spencer said that \"the film is about change. Two best friends are about to realize that the world won't always be the same. The internet is the perfect setting, really, because it's all about change‚Äîthings change by the second\".[7]:3 Director of story Jim Reardon said that it was intimidating to set the film on the Internet, stating that \"[They] looked at how [they] could make the internet relatable on a human level‚Äîlike how Game Central Station aka the power strip mirrored a train station in the first movie. In 'Ralph Breaks the Internet,' any person who uses the internet has a little avatar version of themselves that does their business for them\".[7]:3‚Äì4 Reardon, however, said that Disney \"didn't want to make the movie about the internet\", wanting to instead focus on Ralph and Vanellope's friendship, wanting to instead treat the Internet as \"the place where the movie takes place\".[7]:4 Josie Trinidad claimed that the filmmakers \"didn't want to just give the audience more of that friendship ‚Äî [people had] to see that relationship grow.\"[7]:4\n\nThe design of the scenes within the Internet was based on tours made of One Wilshire in Los Angeles, as it is one of the world's largest telecommunications centers, serving most traffic around the Pacific Ocean.[16] The filmmakers did not approach any of the companies (outside of Disney) that are represented in the Internet, and strove to include net branding from all across the world.[16] They also had to explore various Internet memes, making sure to avoid those that lacked long-term presence on the Internet.[16] While the film addresses many positive elements of the Internet, the filmmakers did not want to shy away from covering some of the more unpleasant aspects about it, in part fueled by the success of tackling racism indirectly within Zootopia.[16] Such elements include Ralph reading through comment sections on videos to find users leaving disparaging messages about him, and having the pair travel to the dark web with its activities of questionable legal and ethical status. They wanted to follow the same approach as they had with Judy Hopps in Zootopia, where she experienced, learned, and overcame the racism aspects, and have Ralph similarly learn and become a better person without having to actually solve the issue of hostility on the Internet.[47]\n\nThe scene where Vanellope is introduced to the Disney Princesses came from screenwriter Pamela Ribon.[24] In 2014, Ribon was still working on Moana when Disney began internally pitching ideas for the sequel to Wreck-It Ralph, Ribon recognized that like the title character of Moana, Vanellope fits the definition of a Disney Princess.[24] When work formally began on the sequel after the completion of Zootopia, Ribon pitched the idea of Disney poking fun at itself by having Vanellope meet the other Disney Princesses in the green room of OhMyDisney.com, the Disney fan-driven website.[48] Further inspiration came from a Buzzfeed online quiz that asked which Disney Princess the user was; Moore thought it would be interesting if Ralph had encountered that quiz and ended up in an argument with Vanellope over the result.[16] Ribon's initial script for the scene, playing off the various tropes of the Princesses such as several being kidnapped or enslaved, remains mostly intact through production. Animators had to work out various techniques to take the different styles of animation into a single approach, and figure out the proportions of the characters using official figurines.[24]\n\nCasting\n\nReilly, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, and Sarah Silverman were reported as being set to reprise their roles.[44] In December 2016, Alan Tudyk confirmed his return in the sequel as a different character,[14][18] named KnowsMore. In August 2018, actress Gal Gadot joined the film.[13] The team was able to secure all the Disney Princesses' original voice actresses, except for Adriana Caselotti as Snow White, Ilene Woods as Cinderella, and Mary Costa as Aurora; Caselotti and Woods died in 1997 and 2010, respectively,[24][49] while Costa retired from acting in 2000.[50] Jennifer Hale and Kate Higgins, the current voice actresses for Cinderella and Aurora, were hired for the film;[3][23] Pamela Ribon, the film's co-screenwriter, performed Snow White's voice for temporary tracks, but the team considered it a good substitute, allowing Ribon to voice her in the final film.[24]\n\nAnimation\n\nThe film contains over 150 unique sets and 5,726 assets. It also included the highest number of characters in any Disney Animation film, with 434 individual characters with 6,752 variants.[16] One of the Disney animators who helped out to bring the Disney Princesses into CG animation was Mark Henn.[51] He was also the original supervising animator of princesses Belle, Jasmine, Mulan, and Tiana.[51]\n\nIn the initial trailer for the film, the African-American princess character Tiana appeared to have a lighter skin tone, a narrower nose, and more European features than she did in the 2009 film The Princess and the Frog.[52][53] This led to some backlashes on social media as these drew her appearance away from that expected of African-Americans.[53] As a result, Disney contacted Tiana's voice actress, Anika Noni Rose, and the advocacy group Color of Change to redesign Tiana for Ralph Breaks the Internet to make sure she resembles more closely to her 2009 appearance; the updated character model was revealed in the second trailer.[53][54][55] The same treatment was given to Pocahontas, the titular character of the 1995 film, as many viewers had pointed out that she was given a much lighter skin tone.[54]\n\nOne of the initial scenes created for the movie involved Ralph and Vanellope invading a children's game, involving feeding pancakes to a bunny to the point that it is implied to explode, scaring the child who was playing the game. This scene was featured in the film's original teaser, released in March 2018, and was heavily discussed in buzz about the film. Over time as they developed the rest of the film, they found the scene no longer fit in the film they were presenting. Knowing that audiences would be asking for this scene, it was moved to the mid-credits scene, along with additional fourth wall commentary about scenes shown in trailers that go missing in the final film.[56] The final post-credits scene involves what starts as a teaser for the upcoming Frozen II film (due in 2019) but ends up with Ralph \"rickrolling\" the audience by starting to sing Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\". While producers Spencer and Moore had an idea of Ralph doing a \"Wreck Roll\" early on in the film's development, they never incorporated it into the story. Late in production, they mentioned this to studio executives who told them they should add it in. As it was one of the last scenes added, the producers had gotten Reilly, who was on vacation with his family at the time, to come in to a New York studio to record for the day so that the animators could work from that.[56]\n\nMusic\n\nMain article(s): Ralph Breaks the Internet (soundtrack)\n\nOn September 19, 2018, Imagine Dragons released the lead single from the soundtrack titled \"Zero\", which plays during the end credits of the movie.[57] On October 23, 2018, the music video of \"Zero\" was posted on Imagine Dragons' YouTube channel.[58] The film features an original song called \"A Place Called Slaughter Race\", performed by Sarah Silverman and Gal Gadot, written by Tom MacDougall and the film's co-director Phil Johnston, and composed by Alan Menken; the song's pop version, \"In This Place\", was performed by Julia Michaels.[59] The film also features songs from various Disney Princess movies, as well as Demi Lovato's cover of \"Let it Go\" played in the beginning of the Oh My Disney scene.[1]:9 Ralph also rickrolls the tune \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" by Rick Astley in a post-credits scene.[56][60] The soundtrack is composed by Henry Jackman, who also composed the score from the previous film.[2][61] It was released digitally on November 16, 2018,[59] and on CD on November 30, 2018.[2][59]\n\nRelease\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Walt Disney Animation Studios initially announced that the sequel, titled Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2, would be released on March 9, 2018.[43] However, in April 2017, A Wrinkle in Time took its date and the film was pushed back to November 21, 2018.[62] In July 2018, Disney shortened the film's title to Ralph Breaks the Internet.[45] The film was released in 3D, 2D, Dolby Cinema and IMAX 3D.[63]\n\nThe first official clip named \"KnowsMore\" was released on World Internet Day, October 29, 2018.[64] Another entitled \"Hearts\" was introduced on November 5, the same date on which they start selling tickets before its release.[65] On that same day, the film made its world premiere at Los Angeles' El Capitan Theatre along with the song \"Zero\" played by Imagine Dragons at the event.[3][66][67] A video clip named \"There Is No Track\", which focuses on the new character Shank, was released on November 8.[68] On November 19, a video clip of Vanellope meeting the Disney Princesses was released.[69] The film itself was released on November 21 in the United States,[62] and November 30 in the United Kingdom.[70]\n\nMarketing\n\nA new poster for the film was released on February 26, 2018.[71] Two days later, a teaser trailer for the film was released on February 28, 2018, and it quickly became viral, getting more than 4.5 million views in 24 hours.[72] A second trailer was released on June 4, 2018, with the Daft Punk song \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\".[23] In July 2018, Disney decided to delete the Wreck-It Ralph 2 circle byline from the film's title, leaving it as Ralph Breaks the Internet.[45]\n\nA sneak peek of the film was released on August 10, 2018, that included the will.i.am song \"Geekin'\".[73] The final poster and trailer were released on September 20, 2018, which included the song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\".[74][75] Carvana and Disney collaborated to promote the film's release throughout a multi-channel campaign.[76] Other brands who partnered with the film include BAPE,[77] eBay,[27][78] Fandango,[79] Mailchimp,[80] McDonald's,[81][82] Netgear,[83] Noovie ARcade,[84] and Purple.[85]\n\nHome media\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on digital on February 12, 2019, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 26, 2019.[87] Bonus features include a behind-the-scenes featurette, a short highlighting some of the Easter eggs hidden throughout the film, deleted scenes, and the music videos for \"Zero\" and \"In This Place\".
