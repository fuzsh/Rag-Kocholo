        "text": "‚õ∫ On Campings, Communities and Desirable Futures Campings are a part of me. My parents, high school teachers, had relatively little money and much summer time available. A perfect combo for travelling w/ car & tent (& lots of canned food...) for 40+ days across Europe. As an only child, very shy and grown in a small apartment of a big city, campings meant freedom. In a camping, you have to walk around and be proximal to unknown others - to go to the bathroom, get water, play, get food, etc. At every walk around, unknowns become a bit more knowns. New routines form. You say hi to people on your way, you play a match of ping pong with a random kid, you get to know others, and after a sec you are part of a whole - 'we are the camping'. You crave to go back the year after. You miss it so much during long, boring hours at school. Green, social, safe spaces for kids, adults and elderly to live, mingle and grow together - this is how people, even across political and social opposites, often describe a desirable future ( üôè to Tima Bansal for this inspiration during #EGOS' PDW on Desirable Futures). In principle, campings feature many of these elements. At least, in the way they are organised in many European campsites. So, with an eye on desirable futures, and with the other on 'struggling presents', since 2021 I'm studying campings more in depth. I believe campings have to do with 'desirable (even if we'll struggle) futures' more than we think. In and around campings, communities of place emerge and get challenged, strengthened, destroyed and reconstructed. Fairly enough, many of us are more interested in camps - inhabited by refugees and displaced seeking shelter from wars or climate struggles - than campings. In all honesty, with the tragic news of these days, studying campings rather than camps is quite silly. But I sense that campings - yes, the ones we usually go for 'fun' - may also be, or become, places of community resilience. Campings are located up the mountains, near rivers, lakes and beaches. In campings, we try to find a way to escape summer heatwaves, to cope with galloping inflation and the lingering fear of another pandemic - for at least a few days. As cities become inapt and expensive to inhabit in the midst of energy, climate (and often loneliness) crises, campings offer *an* alternative, even if just frugal, ephemeral, incomplete... Hence, without any pretension of becoming *the* alternative. The locations of campings are, per se, naturally risky. Campings are part of fragile ecosystems. They are vulnerable to floods, wildfires, landslides; sometimes also struggle with over-tourism, social conflicts and aggressions. In this research, I'm documenting these patterns, challenges and ways forward. So, there's no take-home message in this post. Just, watch out for campings ‚õ∫ üì∑ My elder son in a camping in 2019, now destroyed by a flood in June '24. But 'we' will hopefully rebuild it soon."
