It serves as the sequel to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph and is the second installment of the Wreck-It Ralph film series. It is Walt Disney Animation Studios' 57th feature-length film. It is directed by Rich Moore and Phil Johnston, written by Johnston and Pamela Ribon, and executive-produced by John Lasseter, Chris Williams, and Jennifer Lee. It features John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, and Ed O'Neill reprising their roles from the first film, with Alan Tudyk returning to voice a new character, alongside new additions to the cast including Gal Gadot, Taraji P. Henson, Bill Hader (in an uncredited role), and Alfred Molina.\n\nThe plot centers on Ralph and Vanellope going into the Internet to find a replacement part to fix Sugar Rush. Along the way, they meet Shank, the fastest racer in a game called Slaughter Race, and Vanellope feels at home there, which Ralph worries may put their friendship in jeopardy that comes alongside disastrous consequences.\n\nTalks for a Wreck-It Ralph sequel began in October 2012 and went through three different scripts before settling on the final plot. The film was officially announced in June 2016, with much of the original cast confirming they had signed on, and new cast announced in 2018. It marks the first feature-length theatrical sequel from Walt Disney Animation Studios since Winnie the Pooh in 2011 , which was a sequel to the 1977 animated film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. It is also the studio's first animated sequel to be created by the original film's writing/directing team.[1]\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 5, 2018, and was released in the United States on November 21, 2018. The film has grossed over $285 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, who called it a \"worthy successor\" and praised the animation, humor, characters and storyline, as well as the vocal performances of Reilly and Silverman.[8][9]\n\nPlot\n\nSix years after saving the game Sugar Rush from Turbo's revenge, Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz are still best friends who hang out every night after work in Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade. Vanellope's frustration over the predictability of her game prompts Ralph to create a secret bonus track for her. She enjoys the track but overrides the player controls to race on it, causing the steering wheel to get stuck. A player accidentally pulls the wheel off the console while trying to free it and Mr. Litwak accidentally breaks it while trying to reattach it. Finding the replacement part to be prohibitively expensive, he has no choice but to unplug Sugar Rush, leaving Vanellope and its citizens homeless.\n\nAfter a conversation with Fix-It Felix, Jr. in Tapper's, Ralph decides to venture with Vanellope onto the Internet via the arcade's newly installed Wi-Fi router, in order to obtain a new wheel on eBay. They find one being auctioned off and place a winning bid of $27,001, but must pay for it within 24 hours. To raise the money, they turn to a pop-up advertiser named Spamley, who sends them to steal a valuable car from the online game Slaughter Race.\n\nRalph and Vanellope steal the car, but its owner Shank forces them to return it to her after a high-speed chase throughout Slaughter Race. Shank compliments Vanellope's driving skills, causing Ralph to worry that this might potentially put their friendship may be in jeopardy, and points the pair toward the video sharing site BuzzzTube. After meeting with its chief algorithm Yesss, Ralph decides to raise money by creating a series of videos that play off popular trends, intending to buy the wheel and return Vanellope to Sugar Rush.\n\nRalph's videos become a viral sensation, and Yesss sends her staff into the Internet to spam users with pop-up ads. Vanellope volunteers for this job and is assigned to Oh My Disney, where she meets the Disney Princesses and gains from them the inspiration to return to Slaughter Race. Meanwhile, Ralph earns enough money to cover the eBay bid, but is crushed upon reading viewers' disparaging comments about his videos. He inadvertently overhears a conversation between Vanellope and Shank, in which Vanellope expresses her desire to leave the arcade and live permanently in Slaughter Race.\n\nDesperate to keep Vanellope as a friend, Ralph turns again to Spamley in search of a way to make Slaughter Race so boring that Vanellope will not want to stay. Spamley leads him to Double Dan, a virus designer hiding in the dark web. Double Dan gives Ralph a virus that can replicate and broadcast any insecurity it finds. When Ralph unleashes it in Slaughter Race, it homes in on Vanellope's glitch and spreads it, causing the game to crash and nearly killing Ralph and Vanellope in a server reboot.\n\nAs Vanellope begins to blame herself, Ralph admits his misdeed to her. Outraged by what he's done, she throws away the cookie medal she had made for him six years ago and abandons him. The virus escapes from Slaughter Race, scans Ralph's insecurities, and spreads them throughout the Internet to create thousands of clones of him. As the clones begin destroying the Internet and form a giant Ralph in search of Vanellope, she, Ralph, and Yesss try to lead them into an anti-virus software trap. The tactic fails and Vanellope is captured; Ralph tries unsuccessfully to fight them off, then calls them out on their selfish possessiveness and admits that Vanellope's desire to enter Slaughter Race does not mean that their friendship must end. With his insecurities resolved, the giant Ralph disintegrates and drops him, but the Disney Princesses save him from the fall, and Vanellope and Ralph reconcile.\n\nThe Internet is restored and Vanellope decides to stay in Slaughter Race. Coming to terms with the changes in his life, Ralph returns to the arcade and begins participating in activities with other game characters, while staying in touch with Vanellope through video chats.\n\nVoice cast\n\nJohn C.

Bison, Peter Pepper, Frogger, Tapper, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Doctor Eggman from the original film.[1][44][45] The band Imagine Dragons (whose song \"Zero\" is featured in a trailer for the film, as well as its soundtrack) make a cameo appearance in the film, with the members voicing themselves.[1][46]\n\nStan Lee, Marvel Comics' former writer, editor and publisher, makes a posthumous non-speaking cameo appearance in the film talking to Iron Man.[47][48]\n\nThe filmmakers revealed that the film originally featured a joke about Kylo Ren being a \"spoiled child\", which was later cut from the film by request from Lucasfilm.[49][50] Like the first film, it does not have a Mario cameo despite the promise they would include him.[51]\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn October 2012, director Rich Moore said that he and Disney had ideas about a sequel that would bring the characters up to date and explore different planes of the gaming universe like online gaming and console gaming, Moore noting it would be \"great to work in a story about those types of games that are so prevalent, contemporary and part of today's culture\".[52] The idea of a sequel held interest for numerous people involved with the first film, including the artists, technicians, and voice actors, and Moore stated that many of the crew and voice cast were open to the sequel, believing that they have \"barely scratched the surface\" of the video game world they envisioned. He also stated that he planned to include Mario and Tron in the sequel.[53][54] (In the end, only the latter appeared briefly, serving as a minor foreshadowing plot device.) In 2014, the first film's composer Henry Jackman said that a story for the sequel was being written.[55] In July 2015, John C. Reilly said he had signed on to reprise his role of Ralph in a projected sequel.[10] In September 2015, Jack McBrayer was asked by Screen Rant about the state of the projected sequel, but he revealed that he did not know much of anything and joked that it would be awkward if Felix was not in the film.[56]\n\nOn March 24, 2016, Moore stated that a sequel was still being planned. Moore specifically stated that a sequel would include an appearance from Mario, citing a \"good relationship with Nintendo\".[57] In an official announcement on June 30, 2016, Rich Moore appeared, along with Phil Johnston and John C. Reilly, to announce the film's release date, which was originally March 9, 2018; John C. Reilly said of the plot, \"Ralph leaves the arcade and wrecks the Internet\".[58][59] In an interview with Oh My Disney the same day, Moore said of what could be expected in the film, that it would have \"everything [people] loved about the first one and a whole lot more\".[60]\n\nIn March 2017, the sequel's title was officially announced as Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2, with Moore returning as director joined by the first film's co-writer, Phil Johnston, in his directing debut in an animated film and Clark Spencer also returning as producer.[61][62][63]\n\nIn July 2018, Disney removed Wreck-it Ralph 2 from the film's title.[64]\n\nWriting\n\nTwo working versions of the script had been scrapped before settling on the one used for the film, according to head writer Josie Trinidad. In one version, Vanellope had become self-absorbed by the Internet, gaining popularity and becoming a celebrity among the users. Ralph had been thrown in jail where he met the search engine Knowsmore, and they had partnered together to escape prison and help bring Vanellope back to her normal self. A second version had Ralph becoming an Internet-famous celebrity, and would have been challenged by an anti-virus program named Bev that served as a super cop and would have been the story's villain. Trinidad said neither of these versions captured what they felt was the centerpiece of the sequel, being how Ralph and Vanellope reacted to the new world of the Internet and realizing they have separate paths going forward.[65] In a July 2016 interview with Collider, Rich Moore stated that the movie would take place six years after Wreck-It Ralph, in the present day.[66] At D23 2017, it was announced that the film would revolve around the breakdown of Sugar Rush, and Ralph and Vanellope would venture into the internet to find a replacement part.[67]\n\nProducer Clark Spencer said that \"the film is about change. Two best friends are about to realize that the world won’t always be the same. The internet is the perfect setting, really, because it’s all about change—things change by the second\".[1] Director of story Jim Reardon said that it was intimidating to set the film on the Internet, stating that \"[They] looked at how [they] could make the internet relatable on a human level—like how Game Central Station aka the power strip mirrored a train station in the first movie. In 'Ralph Breaks the Internet,' any person who uses the internet has a little avatar version of themselves that does their business for them\".[1] Reardon, however, said that Disney \"didn’t want to make the movie about the internet\", wanting to instead focus on Ralph and Vanellope's friendship, wanting to instead treat the Internet as \"the place where the movie takes place\".[1] Josie Trinidad claimed that the filmmakers \"didn’t want to just give the audience more of that friendship — [people had] to see that relationship grow.\"[1]\n\nThe design of the scenes within the Internet was based on tours made of One Wilshire in Los Angeles, as it is one of the world's largest telecommunications centers, serving most traffic around the Pacific Ocean.[17] The filmmakers did not approach any of the companies (outside of Disney) that are represented in the Internet, and strived to include net branding from all across the world.[17] They also explored various Internet memes, making sure to avoid those that lacked long-term presence on the Internet.[17] While the film addresses many positive elements of the Internet, the filmmakers did not want to shy away from covering some of the more unpleasant aspects about it, in part fueled by the success of tackling racism indirectly within Zootopia.[17] Such elements include Ralph reading through comment sections on videos to find users leaving disparaging messages about him, and having the pair travel to the dark web with its activities of questionable legal and ethical status. They wanted to follow the same approach as they had with Judy Hopps in Zootopia, where she experienced, learned, and overcame the racism aspects, and have Ralph similarly learn and become a better person without having to actually solve the issue of hostility on the Internet.[68]\n\nThe scene where Vanellope is introduced to the Disney Princesses came from screenwriter Pamela Ribon. In 2014, Ribon was still working on Moana when Disney began internally pitching ideas for the sequel to Wreck-It Ralph, Ribon recognized that like the title character of Moana, Vanellope fits the definition of a Disney Princess. When work formally began on the sequel after the completion of Zootopia, Ribon pitched the idea of Disney poking fun at itself by having Vanellope meet the other Disney Princesses in the green room of OhMyDisney.com, the Disney fan-driven website.[69][70] Further inspiration came from a Buzzfeed online quiz that asked which Disney Princess the user was; Moore thought it would be interesting if Ralph had encountered that quiz and ended up in an argument with Vanellope over the result.[17] Ribon's initial script for the scene, playing off the various tropes of the Princesses such as several being kidnapped or enslaved, remained mostly intact through production. Animators had to work out various techniques to take the different styles of animation into a single approach, and figure out the proportions of the characters to themselves using official figurines.[69] Directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston said that a film focusing on the Disney Princesses could be made depending on the audience's response and \"if there's a good story to be told\".[71]\n\nCasting\n\nReilly, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, and Sarah Silverman were reported as being set to reprise their roles.[61] Rich Moore hinted in a July 2016 tweet that Alan Tudyk would return, though he didn't provide information as to whether the actor might reprise his role as Turbo or take on an entirely new character. In December 2016, Alan Tudyk confirmed his return in the sequel as a different character,[16][24] named KnowsMore. In August 2018, Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot joined the film.[13] The team was able to secure all the Disney Princesses' original voice actresses, save for Adriana Caselotti for Snow White, Ilene Woods for Cinderella, and Mary Costa for Aurora, as Caselotti and Woods passed away in 1997 and 2010 respectively while Costa retired from acting in 2000; Jennifer Hale and Kate Higgins, the current voice actresses for Cinderella and Aurora were hired for the film while Pamela Ribon, the film's co-screenwriter, performed Snow White's voice for temporary tracks, but the team considered it a good substitute, allowing Ribon to voice her in the final film.[33][69]\n\nAnimation\n\nThe picture contains over 150 unique sets and 5,726 assets. It also included the highest number of characters in any Disney Animation film, with 434 individual characters with 6,752 variants.[17]\n\nFollowing the June 2018 trailer for the film, which included the first shots of the Disney Princesses, Tiana, the African-American lead character from the 2009 film The Princess and the Frog, appeared to have a lighter skin tone, a narrower nose, and European features in Ralph Breaks the Internet than in the 2009 film.[72] This led to some backlashes on social media as these drew her appearance away from that expected of African-Americans.[73] As a result, Tiana's voice actress Anika Noni Rose and the advocacy group Color of Change contacted Disney to redesign Tiana for Ralph Breaks the Internet to make her look closer to her 2009 appearance, which was reintroduced in the second trailer.[73][74] The same treatment was given to Pocahontas, the titular character of the 1995 film Pocahontas, who had been pointed out by many viewers to have also been given a much lighter skin tone.[73]\n\nOne of the initial scenes created for the movie involved Ralph and Vanellope invading a childrens' game, involving feeding pancakes to a bunny to the point it appears to explode, subsequently frightening the child that was playing the game. This scene was featured in the film's original teaser, released in March 2018, and was heavily discussed in buzz about the film. Over time as they developed the rest of the film, they found the scene no longer fit in the film they were presenting. Knowing that audiences would be asking for this scene, it was moved to the mid-credits scene, along with additional fourth wall commentary about scenes shown in trailers that go missing in the final film.[75] The final post-credits scene involves what starts as a teaser for the upcoming Frozen 2 film (due in 2019) but ends up with Ralph \"rickrolling\" the audience by starting to sing Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\". While producers Spencer and Moore had an idea of Ralph doing a \"Wreck Roll\" early on in the film's development, they never incorporated it into the story. Late in production, they mentioned this to studio executives who told them they should add it in. As it was one of the last scenes added, the producers had gotten Reilly, who was on vacation with his family at the time, to come in to a New York studio to record for the day so that the animators could work from that.[75]\n\nMusic\n\nMain article: Ralph Breaks the Internet (soundtrack)\n\nOn September 19, 2018, Imagine Dragons released the lead single from the soundtrack titled \"Zero\", which plays during the end credits of the movie.[76] On October 23, 2018, the music video of \"Zero\" was posted on Imagine Dragons' YouTube channel.[77] The film features an original song called \"A Place Called Slaughter Race\", performed by Sarah Silverman and Gal Gadot, written by Tom MacDougall and the film's co-director Phil Johntson, and the music was composed by Alan Menken, while the song's pop version, \"In This Place\", was performed by Julia Michaels.[78] The film also features songs from various Disney Princess movies, as well as Demi Lovato's cover of \"Let it Go\" played in the beginning of the Oh My Disney scene.
