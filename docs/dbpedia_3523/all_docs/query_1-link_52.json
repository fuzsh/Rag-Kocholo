        "text": "It’s a fascinating picture of robots and dancing women, all performing for a movie. The photo is supposedly from around 1927. And while I love old movies and I love robots, I can’t for the life of me figure out what this photo is from. I need your help.\n\nThe photo above is licensed by Getty Images, an agency that typically has pretty thorough descriptions of their photos. But for some reason this photo doesn’t include much information at all. The description reads: “circa 1927: A group of chorus girls in an unknown film.” Thanks, Getty.\n\nMy first thought was the 1930 film Just Imagine, a musical science fiction movie that’s just weird enough to have a scene like this. But I don’t think that’s it. But what else could it be? The only robot movie from 1927 that I can think of is Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, but obviously that’s not right. Even the extended cut doesn’t have a scene anywhere close to this.\n\nSo what is it? I’m inclined to think that maybe it’s a scene from some early 1930s musical that may have gotten lost to history. Sadly, there are quite a few movies that you simply can’t find anymore. It’s estimated that roughly half of all American movies made before 1950 are totally lost. And perhaps 90 percent of movies made before 1927.\n\nPlease help. And if it’s so obvious that I should’ve known all along please feel free to mercilessly ridicule me. I promise I deserve it."
