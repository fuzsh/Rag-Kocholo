        "text": "As a young Black boy in Hollywood, 16-year old Jahi Di’Allo Winston has always been meticulous on the roles he takes.\n\nEven though, Winston hasn’t always had the luxury of choosing certain roles he wanted to take, he was particular on the roles he auditioned for. “It is important, and I think we are seeing now more than ever that positions of power and positions of stature in this industry as a Black individual isn’t nearly enough,” he says. “Just to represent Black people isn’t enough but how you represent them and how you represent yourself is even more important,” said Winston.\n\nThe question he asks: is this something his community will feel proud of when they see it? What are they going to get from this after watching this? “What do I want them to understand after watching this?” Winston put into consideration all of these things by mediating and praying before taking on any roles.\n\nWinston was introduced to most audiences through his stellar performance as Young Ralph Tresvant in BET's hit miniseries, The New Edition Story. Before The New Edition Story, he was casted as a Young Simba in the Broadway production of Disney’s The Lion King. Quickly, landing a role in Taraji P. Henson Proud Mary, and eventually landed a role in Lena Waithe’s Queen & Slim. Now, the 16-year old actor is back in a leading role in HBO Max Charm City Kings alongside rapper Meek Mill directed by Angel Manuel Soto and written by Sherman Payne. The film is produced by Caleeb Pinkett, Clarence Hammond, and Marc Bienstock. It was executive produced by Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith, and James Lassiter company, Overbrook Entertainment.\n\nBased off the 2013 documentary 12 O'clock Boys, Charm City Kings embarks the coming of age story about a teenage boy named Mouse(Winston) who wants to ride his bike with The Midnight Clique. After his older brother Stro was killed, Mouse tries to figure who he wants to be. Mouse like any teenage boy wants to seek validation from his friends, impress the girl he likes, following in the footsteps of his older brother, and ride his bike. The Midnight Clique’s leader and friend to Stro Blax (Mill), takes Mouse under his wing and tries to show him there is more to life than riding his bike. I talked with Winston about his similarities with his character Mouse, importance of having Black mentors, and how the themes of the old classic movies shape this movie.\n\nKemberlie Spivey: Charm City Kings is based off of the 2013 12 0’ Clock Boys Documentary, how would you describe Mouse?\n\nJahi Winston: Mouse is a kid who’s very strong-willed and headstrong in what he wants. He is very passionate about riding with the biker group in Baltimore City that he idolizes called The Midnight Clique. He is like every other teenage boy that you most likely see in a different setting who wants validation from his friends or wants to cool in front of the girl he likes but his circumstances and the environment as well as the predicament he gets himself in prohibit him from doing that.\n\nKS: In your preparation for playing Mouse, how did you research this world of dirt bike riders your character lives in? Do you have to meet with kids that are a part of this world?\n\nJW: Being in the environment everyday, 100% of the movie was shot in West Baltimore that was very helpful in all of our performances. We were in the environment every single day and we got the opportunity to fully emerge into the culture. All of the streets stuff the documentary was shot on, we shot on the same exact street so it was a lot of history. It was great and high maintenance energy on set for most of the time. To answer the second part of the question, it was helpful to be in the environment. Of course, I did my own research outside of being on set mostly consisting of using the documentary more of a residential tool. More than anything, it didn’t give me anything more than that. I still referenced it a lot when it came to the dialect and Pug’s demeanor. Other than that most of the research of mine was tools and things I knew that as an actor came from being in the environment every day.\n\nKS: When you think of Mouse's character, how strongly do you identify with him?\n\nJW: At its core, we are sort of similar. We are both very passionate about things that we want. I am not someone who typically does things for outside validation. I think there are times when I do and totally out of character for me. It’s a very special person or special people that bring that out of me but it is not in my nature to want to do things to get validation from other people. I don’t think it's in his nature or any of our natures. He has a very immense fascination with a girl and overall culture that he surrounds himself with every day. I think it can influence anyone to do things that may not be typically in character influence. I don’t know our circumstances or our environment both born into are exactly identical. I don’t know they have to be for me to identify with him.\n\nKS: Mouse and his friends are still in middle school but they want to be a part of The Midnight Clique. Why did you think it was important for them to try to join this clique instead of joining their summer like regular kids?\n\nJW: In West Baltimore City, the biker group is if you are not a part of that culture then you aren’t popping. Again, it goes back to validation. For Mouse, it’s more eternal in trying to somewhat avenge his brother and carry on his brother’s legacy. His brother who was hanging with the dirt bikers in the city. For Mouse, it’s more eternal not just about validation from other people whether it's validation from himself trying to prove something to himself. Mouse just wants a bike because he’s in love with bikes, grew up adoring, and idolizes anyone he sees on a bike. Naturally and organically, he wants to do that as well. I think having those very simple details about this kid who just wants a bike wanting eternal validation from himself and his brother influences every moment that Mouse has in the story. I really wanted to hold in onto those specific details.\n\nKS: Mouse wanted to be like his big brother, Stro and ride his bike with The Midnight Clique. But he also volunteered as a veterinarian at the local animal shelter. Why do you think it was important to corporate his other passion besides riding bikes in the story?\n\nJW: It’s important in any space where there are black creatives, black actors, and black characters to show that Black people are not monolithic. We are multifaceted. It’s important for young Black men to see a young black boy who has interest in multiple things outside of doing one thing and outside of being on the streets. Obviously, riding dirt bikes is a passion but there are other things that can drive and motivate you outside of the thing you might obsess over or want to do. In order to get some type of street credit from your friends and look cool in front of the girl you like. There are more to the world than just your four walls of your classroom, living room, your church, or the four corners that you stay on every day. I actually had more veterinarian stuff that we shot that didn't make it into the film.\n\nKS: You share most of your scenes with Blax known as Meek Mill in the movie. What was like working with him?\n\nJS: Meek was great. Meek came, he was doing a lot of other stuff, and very busy. He was serious and you can tell he wanted to do the best he could which was inspiring to me. We had already been shooting for a few weeks almost a month before Meek had gotten there. It sort of a reunited this drive in me to be more open and available more attuned to the artistic spirit on set. Just to see how you learn that through the job, to do the best I could do so I wouldn’t step on his toes and not give him the best performance. I think all that went into influencing how our chemistry came across on screen. I knew our chemistry together was going to have a big impact and influence on what was depicted on screen. It was great to see Meek get more and more comfortable throughout shooting. Get more relaxed, like he was a vet throughout the period of filming. It was really cool to see him do his thing.\n\nKS: There were some emotional scenes between the two of you especially toward the end of the movie. Why did you think Blax took Mouse under his wing?\n\nJS: Blax has a lot of emotions dealing with thoughts that he hasn’t necessary gravel fully and dealt with concerning Mouse’s brother Stro death. When he sees Mouse, it’s one of the reasons he immediately knows who Mouse is, and he gravitates to him so naturally because of his connection to Mouse brother. I think by taking Mouse under his wing and prohibiting him from going down the same path Stro went down. He almost answers the call to his guilt self or whatever it’s about. He almost avenged him in his own way. I think that’s the prime reason but I think as their relationship grew he really began to have a connection to Mouse and not doing it because he is Stro’s brother. He sees how Mouse is a special kid and potential to get out of the city. He has potential to go and be someone someday aside from someone who stays on the corner riding dirt bikes all day. He has potential to leave the city and make something out of his life. He knows that he can’t just do it by hanging in the streets with his friends. I think by taking Mouse under his wings, taking him to the garage, and the bike shop. He knows that he is doing something productive for him. It’s Blax’s way of keeping Mouse “safe”.\n\nKS: When we are first introduced to your character, we meet Rivers, the detective that looks out for Mouse. Rivers doesn’t want Mouse going down the wrong path. What resonated with you about his relationship with Rivers? Why did you think it’s important to show this type of relationship on screen?\n\nJW: I like the fact that Mouse had two mentors and he was sorta of being pulled into two directions. The fact that he was trying his best to follow his own intention and be who he wanted to be. As it is in real life, you get sort of caught between two worlds. One foot in the streets, and you have one foot in trying to graduate from high school or college. Again, it’s core values that we can all relate to aside from the environment. I think it’s important to show a relationship like that on screen because it’s cool to show a young Black kid with two mentors and not being monolithic. Because being Black is not a monolithic experience, so for him to have two mentors who are Black men. Mentoring a young Black man is powerful and it’s influential the way it translates on screen. The way it transcends from the screen to the audience and to penetrate into someone’s mind a kid site to seek out black mentors is really important. Hopefully the film inspires Black-on-Black mentorships.\n\nKS: Was there a scene in the movie that you found challenging to film and why?\n\nJW: Yes, a few. There are some scenes that were difficult from a technical standpoint. Then, there were some which were really difficult to do emotionally. All of the emotional scenes were hard. One of the very last scenes with Blax and Mouse was very hard to shoot. There was the convenience store and when Mouse comes back home at the very last point of the film. All of the emotional scenes were difficult because it’s such a high maintenance environment and hard to get into an emotional state no matter where you are. I think because of the environment you are in amplifies and intensifies the level of difficulty. Nevertheless, I did it!\n\nKS: Charm City Kings highlights the coming of age story of young black boys and second chances. How does it feel to be sharing a movie like this at a time when boundary-pushing narratives centered on Black Americans have arguably never been more important?\n\nJW: This movie was supposed to come out early this year, but got pushed due to the pandemic. I was totally confused about the timing of it all and not quite sure how could work on a film so hard for it not intentionally be hindered in a way such as this. The worst way possible but I now see the significance of the movie coming out now during this moment right now and where we are in culture right now. Who knows the kind impact it will have? I can say the film is timely but not timeless. I think this is a film at its core and just a classic story. It has more to do with the simple everyday challenges of being black and trying to find your place in the world at large. You know all of these conversations surrounding blackness in America start from the little kid you pass by on your way to work to the black celebrity you see everywhere you go. How you treat your black friends and how you treat your black girlfriend makes a difference on our experiences in the cricket societal structure that we are born into. It’s showing a very simple story but also being able to depict these issues in all of their honesty and artistry which is really cool. I don’t like doing the whole this movie is going to impact the filmgoers. I am really excited for the movie to come out.\n\nKS: How can people relate to this movie during a time when our world feels divided? What message do you hope viewers talk from watching Charm City Kings?\n\nJW: I think people can relate to it now more than ever given a lot key things in our film centers around gun violence. It is a very important common issue especially in this country. I think people can relate to those things and relate to Mouse in everything he embodies through his essence and being a strong-willed kid. The film has themes of Stand By Me, Boyz In The Hood, and Bronx Tails. It’s a combination of all of these classic stories put into one 2 hour and 5 minute film. It is set in Baltimore city, an often vilified, overly controversial, and politicized city. Just seeing and embodying humanitarian of the city starting with the 14-year old kid who wants his bike, validation from his friends, and the girl that he likes. I think it’s the first step in humanizing a kid like Mouse on screen and off screen from across the country and the world.\n\nCharm City Kings is streaming now on HBO Max."
