        "text": "Betty Compson and Ralph Forbes serve England well in \"Inside the Lines,\" the film of espionage at Gibraltar, now occupying the screen at the Globe. There is something of a mix-up which is finally unraveled when it is revealed that both these persons are working in the employ or the same nation and are not, as each imagined of the other, members of the enemy intelligence service.This situation is a bit unfair, for the spectator is also led to believe that the two were German spies. And who would have suspected Amahdi, that sleek Hindu servant, of being Operator No. 49 and the most dangerous of them all? A host of embarrassing questions might here be propounded, but it is enough that the picture serves its purpose in being an entertaining story of some spies' efforts to destroy the British fleet at Gibraltar.Betty Compson, as Jane, falls in love with Eric, after they meet in Germany, in 1914. War is declared, and Jane is called away without explanation. The two meet again in Gibraltar, where Jane is sent on a mission, obviously by a German agent, to destroy the fleet sheltered there. Then there is a series of events which finally leads to the exposure of all. It would not have been surprising if the cameraman and director had stepped before the lens and declared themselves in the pay of Great Britain, almost every one else did.Betty Compson appears her competent self as Jane, and Ralph Forbes is attractive as the other suspect. Montague Love does well as the Governor of Gibraltar.\n\nINSIDE THE LINES, with Montague Love, Betty Compson, Ralph Forbes, Mischa Auer, Ivan Simpson, Betty Carter and others, directed by Roy Pomeroy from the play by Earl Derr Biggers; program of sound shorts and newsreel. At the Globe."
