        "text": "From the TV detective drama Checkmate in 1962 to the legal-themed The Paper Chase in 1986. And The Twilight Zone, Route 66, The Fugitive, Star Trek, Mission: Impossible, Mannix, Ironside, The Partridge Family, The Waltons, Family and Dynasty. Wonder what these TV series have in common?\n\nAside from airing on a broadcast network decades ago, these shows, among dozens of others, share another common trait. They all had episodes directed by the legendary director and screenwriter, Ralph Senesky, who turns 101 years of age today.\n\nSenensky is a World War II veteran, serving in Europe from 1943 to 1945. Following his role as a stage director before turning to television, Ralph Senensky, at age 35, entered the world of episodic television in 1958 as a production supervisor and production coordinator in four episodes of the anthology drama series Playhouse 90.\n\nSegueing into his role as a TV director with five episodes of the medical drama Dr. Kildare, starring Richard Chamberlain, in 1961, Senensky honed his early directing chops in other series like comedies The Phil Silvers Show, Car 54, Where Are You? and Gomer Pyle, USMC; and dramas like 12 O’Clock High, The Big Valley, The Defenders, Lost in Space, and The Wild Wild West.\n\nSenensky, no doubt, reached a career milestone directing seven episodes of the original Star Trek. “I directed twice as many episodes of The Waltons and two and half times as many episodes of The FBI. I directed more episodes of The Partridge Family and more episodes of The Courtship of Eddie’s Father than I did of Star Trek,” wrote Ralph Senensky on his website, Ralph’s Cinema Trek. “And yet today if you google-search my name on the internet, you will think I spent most of my career directing Star Trek.\n\n“How and when did this phenomenon involve me? It was early December, 1966, when one of my agents called to ask if I would like to direct an episode of Star Trek. I had not seen the show, and I was not into science fiction, but I also was not one to turn down a challenge. So I said, “Yeah, go ahead and book me,” he wrote.\n\n“After production had finished, I received a very nice note from Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy).”\n\nSenensky also directed 15 episodes of the syndicated religious-themed weekly anthology series Insight.\n\nRecently, Senensky (and production assistant John Dayton) spoke to The Waltons star Judy Norton about their experiences on the series.\n\nSenensky’s resume was also filled with TV movies and episodes of series like family dramas The Family Holvak and Eight Is Enough; crime dramas The Rookies, Barnaby Jones and The Blue Knight; and the medical drama Trapper John, M.D.\n\nSaid Ralph Senensky at Ralph’s Cinema Trek about directing an episode of Eight Is Enough:\n\n“There were two reasons (beyond the employment) that I was eager to accept an assignment on the series. Robert Jacks was producing. Jacks had produced the first four seasons of The Waltons, and I had directed six shows for him, and Diana Hyland was starring as the mother of the eight children. I had directed Diana in 1964 in “When the Bough Breaks” on The Fugitive, and later in the early seventies, I directed her in episodes of The FBI, Dan August and Banyon. However, there was a surprise awaiting me at the studio when I reported.\n\nDid you notice something missing? Jacks told me that Diana was not currently working.\n\nShe had appeared in the pilot and three episodes, when she discovered she had cancer. The series was currently keeping her character alive by having the mother away, but phoning home each week. He told me a sound team had been going to her home and recording her end of the telephone conversations for each episode.”\n\nBy the 1980s, Senensky was active behind the scenes of episodes of dramas Lou Grant, Young Maverick, Hart to Hart, and the aforementioned Dynasty, among others.\n\nSaid Ralph Senensky about directing the pilot episode of Dynasty (which was originally titled Oil): “First days on any pilot were difficult, but I realize now even more than I did at the time, the logistics of launching this pilot were daunting. The scope of the project was that of a feature film, but the budget was strictly television.\n\nIf the show was picked up, I was contracted to stay on and direct four episodes of the series. When the pilot ended up being a three-hour show, the third hour became one of those episodes, and that commitment was reduced to three. However, I felt the saga of the pilot was so unusual, so unique, to continue by writing about directing Dynasty episodes would have been anti-climactic.”\n\nLater, Senensky briefly returned to the theater, where he directed the plays You Can’t Take It With You and Watch on the Rhine.\n\n“Directing episodic television is like jumping on a freight train in motion,” Ralph Senensky once said. “As a director, you have to jump on and not break your legs. Once you've boarded it, you must climb on top of the train and run across, get into the engine and take over running it. Much of what happens is that before you can bring anything personal to a story — which you have to do — you have to get acquainted with who the people are. That's not in terms of who you want them to be but who they already are, because you catch them as ongoing, already established characters.”\n\nIn 2013, Senensky directed his first film project in more than two decades, an independent production titled The Right Regrets.\n\n“I hear many friends in my age bracket commenting, ‘Where has the time gone? It just seems to have flown by.’ I don’t feel that way. I look back, and I see a long, long road, the one it has taken me a long, long time to traverse.”\n\nToday, on the occasion of the 101st birthday of this famed TV director, we celebrate the life and career of Ralph Senensky. Happy Birthday!"
