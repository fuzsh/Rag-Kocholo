The company does this via its A.I.-powered, all-in-one SaaS platform.\n\nDifferentiating factor: The venture’s app is as much an educational ecosystem as it is a piece of technology. It delivers customized insights to users, while combining micro-learning, live events and video coaching — which, in turn, increases sales and reduces compliance risk.\n\nIts impact: In February 2022, ACTO received its Great Place to Work Certification for the second year in a row; and in December, the scale-up won a Brandon Hall Group Gold award for its “learning management” and “business impact tools.”\n\nAcuity Insights\n\nFounders: Rich Emrich, Kelly Dore and Harold Reiter\n\nYear founded: 2014\n\nCapital raised: Undisclosed\n\nNumber of employees: 75-149\n\nIn a nutshell: Acuity Insights’ tech makes higher-education admissions fairer by looking beyond grades and technical skills, allowing schools to create more diversity in the student population.\n\nDifferentiating factor: The company offers a suite of digital tests and screenings that evaluate non-cognitive and non-academic qualities, such as self-discipline and the ability to work in teams.

This enables the company to reduce the amount of carbon-intensive cement needed in the mix, which helps avoid additional emissions. For every tonne of carbon dioxide that CarbonCure mineralizes in concrete, the company is able to avoid another 50 tonnes of emissions simply by reducing the amount of cement used. The company is approaching a key milestone: 400,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide reduced and removed from the atmosphere. And to date, the company has poured more than 50 million cubic yards (38 million cubic metres) of lower carbon concrete.\n\nIts impact: With more than 800 systems sold worldwide, CarbonCure is experiencing rapid growth across North America and around the globe.
