        "text": "With massive crowds and countless critics raving about her debut album, Ravyn Lenae knew what she had to do: completely ignore all of the expectations that led to it.\n\n\"I knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go,\"she says from her home in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter building up a growing following in Chicago alongside other members of the Zero Fatigue Collective (which includes producer Monte Booker and rapper Smino), Lenae relocated to the West Coast. She made a massive mark on 2022’s Hypnos, which featured a beguiling mix of alt R&B, house and soul alongside Renae’s magnetic vocal presence.\n\nAnd rather than coast, Lenae dug deeper for the followup, Bird’s Eye (due Aug. 9). Working with frequent Kendrick Lamar collaborator and in-demand producer DJ Dahi, Bird’s Eye flutters across genres and influences — pulling from Fleetwood Mac on one track, drawing in Childish Gambino on another, and adding Jimmy Jam’s bass elsewhere. Indicative of these multifarious influences are two pre-release singles: the retro pop-leaning \"Love Me Not\" and the soulfully skipping \"Love Is Blind.\"\n\nLenae uses that shapeshifting methodology as a way to interrogate the concepts of love and relationships — never content to rest on her laurels, learning how best to grow and adapt. \"Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity,\" she says.\n\nNearing the release of Bird’s Eye, Lenae spoke with GRAMMY.com about directing the video for \"Love Me Not\" in Chicago, blending Brazilian music with Prince inflections, and how the album helped her reconnect with her father.\n\nA lot seems to have happened in the two years since 'Hypnos.' On a month-to-month, day-to-day basis, how much do you shift creatively?\n\nIt feels like night and day to me, even though it's been a really short amount of time. During this time between Hypnos and this album — the recording and creating process — a lot unlocked with me. [There was] a lot of personal growth that happened that allows me to approach music in a much freer and kind of impulsive way.\n\nWith the last album and that process, I think I did place a lot of parameters around what I had to be, what I had to sound like, what it had to feel like, who I had to connect with. And I kind of just released all of those expectations with this and made music that I wanted to hear.\n\nHow easy was it to actually release those boundaries and work more more in the moment?\n\nI knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go, if I wanted to keep pursuing music in a way that felt honest. And then being able to collaborate with people such as Dahi, who has kind of mastered that in a lot of ways, and learning from him and seeing his process, seeing how easy and natural it is to just fall into what feels right…\n\nI think the longer you're in an industry or you're in something, the more rules you place on [creativity] and the more you overthink it and try to mold it in a way that doesn't feel impactful. As an artist, being around him and him encouraging that type of process, I think that was a lot of it, too.\n\nDahi's worked with some incredible artists, and clearly in a way that accentuates that artist rather than making it about DJ Dahi. That must have been so perfectly aligned with your openness, to go in and let yourself learn what you wanted to do. They always say if you know too much and plan everything out, you’ll end up stifled creatively.\n\nIt's so true. And that's why I describe it as me kind of returning back to that 12-year-old me, that 13-year-old me, before I cared about opinions, what people thought about me and what I was doing, what I was wearing I think we start off that way, and then the older we get, the more we get so self-conscious and we judge ourselves more harshly than everyone else.\n\nWhy do we do that?!\n\n[Laughs.] I think it's just human nature. And then we try to unlearn all of it.\n\nEven just in daily life, it's so hard to not think about what I could have done at any given moment. And when you’re creating music, there are 5 million ways you can create the same idea and you have to just land on that one.\n\nA hundred percent. During this process, we would have a song idea and then three different versions of that song that hit completely different feelings — maybe a more soft rock version of it, maybe a more indie version of it, maybe a more soulful version. Then it was about having to settle into what is \"the one\" and what feels the best, versus like what's going to chart or what's going to get in the club. Having to release all of that and just really lean into what feels good is what works every time.\n\nThat relates even to how the album was announced, with two tracks that almost speak in conversation with one another. Those songs balance such clever hooks with more nuanced conversation about how conflicted and complex love and relationships can be. How did you find that balance between emotional realism and such immediate music?\n\nIt was just really feeling empowered and confident in my decision making. And that's something that's developed over time, too. Really listening to my voice and what I want out of music in my career and my rollout, you know?\n\nListening to that, obviously having people around me who are like-minded in that way like my management and my team. We all kind of empowered each other to lean into those feelings. At no point in this process did anything feel forced or like I was reaching for something.\n\nThat’s so interesting. You want your team to feel supportive but you also want to feel empowered to take risks away from that support. And that reminds me of “Love Me Not,” which has some really smart risks. It's that vintage pop feeling, right down to the clap-along beats, and the vocals feel right in your ear. So when you started working on that track, for example, did you always imagine it being that nostalgia, that warmth?\n\nI thought that there was just something so cool and timeless, a classic feeling about it. And my songs are the ones where you can really pinpoint what the influences are, or when this was made, or the person behind it. Having a song like that, that really reminded me of Outkast. Like, What is this?\n\nEven before it dropped, I remember having some anxiety around maybe my fans not liking it because it feels a little different from Hypnos. I think anytime you kind of jump outside of the bubble you've kind of created, it's scary because there are people living in that bubble with you who like the temperature in there.\n\nIt’s so important to be constantly revitalized in your work. If you’re doing the same thing, even if your fans are demanding it, you’re not going to get that. And hopefully when your fans see all that you can do, they’ll follow it.\n\nYeah. And there's so much left in me to explore into and put out into the world. And look at an artist's career, someone like Tyler, the Creator: Seeing where his sound started and how he's almost trained his fans’ ears to be receptive to something new every time. They've completely grown up with him in a lot of ways and expanded their palate. Kind of forcing the hand of listeners is something that's really interesting to me. [Laughs.]\n\nI love that idea of pushing yourself and pushing your fans, but still within the realm of what's good. [Laughs] Not just experimenting for the sake of it. Speaking of growing and experimenting, I wanted to ask about the “Love Me Not” music video that you directed. It feels so well shot but still so intimate and casual.\n\nI knew with the album and how I wanted the imagery to feel, it would be very homey. Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity, those first moments where I felt like I was getting closer to myself in a way.\n\nA lot of that started on the South side of Chicago, at my grandmother's house, in the basement. Even the cover of the album symbolizes that transition for me. That's where I dyed my hair red for the first time in the basement, in the sink, so coming back to the sink and dyeing my hair ginger on the cover was something that felt so powerful and defining for me. It just made perfect sense that we were going to go back to Chicago for the first video, in my grandmother's house, with all my family members involved. Those are my grandparents, my mom, my sisters, so that's why it feels so loose and candid. I really wanted to give people a glimpse into my life and what it felt like walking into my childhood home.\n\nGetting to see a place through someone else’s eyes is so extraordinary. It really makes the little details pop. For example, the plantains cooking on the stove at the beginning.\n\nYeah. I associate plantains with my grandparents, my family. We’re of Panamanian West Indian descent, so those smells and those sounds, I really wanted to incorporate into the video.\n\nThat really speaks to bringing some comfort along with the risk-taking, same as having your family around. The features do a great job of bolstering you, setting up that stability, particularly Ty Dolla $ign on \"Dreamgirl.\"\n\nI think we just had the idea to kind of take the song into a different world in a way. When we first started the first section of the song, I just knew there was magic there. Those Prince drums and that Brazilian guitar — why do those make sense together? It shouldn't ever make sense together. But when I heard it? Oh my god, this feels like something fresh and new, but also like I've felt this feeling before.\n\nDahi's brain is just incredible, and then even bringing in Jimmy Jam on it to do bass was a dream come true. I knew it kind of felt like it existed in that Janet stratosphere, and I thought it would be such a cool touch for him to do that personally. Dream come true on all spectrums. I love Ty Dolla $ign, obviously grew up listening to him. He's incredible and I was so honored that he wanted to do it.\n\nBesides Janet, were there any particular artists who were kind of central inspirations for this album specifically?\n\nSonically, Janet is always in the mix. With this one in particular, some Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, a little bit of Fleetwood Mac in there. I just love taking these worlds that are very different from each other and kind of mashing them and seeing what happens. It's like my favorite thing ever.\n\nYou’re trained in classical music, and it's so clear that you understand the range of emotion that you can convey. I'm just curious what happened when you went into recording — or even before that, in the writing. What was it like digging into yourself to find the narrative that matched the mashing?\n\nHonestly, I don't think there was much premeditation with the writing and what I wanted to touch on in a way. Really leaning into those impulsive initial first feelings that a song gives me is something I really valued with this album. And moving forward, that'll be my process.\n\nWhat was premeditated with the writing process with this album was, with every song, trying to really peel back those layers in my brain and those barriers lyrically. Like, What would I naturally say? Think of that and then think, Okay, how can I make this even more literal, even more personal? Even in working with my girl [songwriter] Sarah Aarons, I learned a lot from her as far as songwriting and how to really paint a picture that feels clear and concise and emotional. Not trying to find the prettiest words or the most interesting words, but really writing what feels real. And that's something that I've really, really valued and learned with this process.\n\nEven with “One Wish” with Childish Gambino, the whole album feels like this big conversation on relationships. Being more direct feels like some advice someone would get with a relationship itself, let alone writing about it. Did that process help you actually process what was happening in your life too?\n\nOh man, 100 percent. And that's why music is so beautiful to me. It's really a means of opening dialogue between me and myself, and then me and the people in my life. With a song that's so important to me like “One Wish,\" it’s not just because it's a great song, but because this has really catapulted me into this different part of my life and repairing relationships, opening up difficult conversations — like with my father in particular. Hearing such a simple song and the response I've gotten from it has only validated me much more in the fact that these real stories, real emotions are what connects.\n\nHave you played the album for your father?\n\nWe started repairing or rekindling our relationship maybe two years ago. The making of Bird’s Eye was at its peak and I felt like it was important for me to have a song on the album that addressed my relationship with him in order for me to release it and start to move on in a positive way.\n\nSo sharing the song with him, inviting him to be in the music video was huge for us. And then even after debriefing about maybe some feelings that came up when he heard certain lyrics or when he saw certain scenes in the video, it just opened up this really honest, candid dialogue between us and I couldn't be more grateful that I have this outlet.\n\nMore R&B News\n\nAugust 2024 comes with five Fridays and five weeks of piping hot new music releases. And if July was busy, the upcoming month puts it to task with a sundry of albums for every genre, generation, and gusto.\n\nKicking off August, R&B star Khalid releases Sincere, while masked country singer Orville Peck will release his first duets album, Stampede. The following week, Aug. 9 heralds the third LP from Filipino British singer beabadoobee, This Is How Tomorrow Moves.\n\nBy mid-August, new releases from Foster The People, Nikka Costa, Post Malone and Tinashe will drop, as well as the debut of KATSEYE — a multinational girl group formed by K-pop label HYBE in partnership with Geffen Records. A week later, all eyes and ears will turn to Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet, Lainey Wilson’s Whirlwind, Thomas Rhett’s About A Woman, and Fontaines D.C.’s Romance.\n\nJust before September arrives, Laurie Anderson will release her tribute to aviator Amelia Earhart, Amelia, and A$AP Rocky will make a long-awaited return with Don’t Be Dumb.\n\nTo fill up your upcoming weekends with fresh music, GRAMMY.com crafted a list with 13 remarkable new albums coming out August 2024.\n\nLos Lonely Boys — 'Resurrection' (Aug. 2)\n\nAfter more than a decade away from the studios, Texican rock trio Los Lonely Boys are ready for their Resurrection. The 10-track LP was recorded at guitarist Henry Garza’s home studio in St. Angelo, Texas and in El Paso’s Sonic Ranch (Fiona Apple, Bon Iver).\n\nOn lead singles \"Wish You Would\" and \"See Your Face,\" Los Lonely Boys prove that the wait was worth it, as they experiment with their signature sound for a deeper, more mature output. Resurrection aims to rekindle \"the sonic fire that bonds the Los Lonely Boys brotherhood,\" while also paying respects to Texas legends like Stevie Ray Vaughan and Freddy Fender, per a press release.\n\n\"It’s something we think people need to hear — especially the youth,\" said bassist Jojo Garza. \"When we’re young, we think we have it figured out. When you get older, you start to see things differently. Having kids of our own, we see their ambitions and ideas of what they want to be, so we want to be good parents. The message is, ‘Be careful what you wish for. There could be a false light, and we don’t want you to get hurt.’\"\n\nLos Lonely Boys are also celebrating the 20th anniversary of their self-titled debut, and the commemorations will be extended to a lengthy North American tour. Starting in August and running until November, the shows will also feature long time peers Los Lobos.\n\nKhalid — 'Sincere' (Aug. 2)\n\nFive years after the release of Free Spirit, R&B singer/songwriter Khalid is back with his third full length. Per a press release, Sincere is a \"combination of my life experiences\" that explores the pains and joys of growing up. Khalid noted that \"it takes inspiration from conversations that I have had with my fans, supporters, and the people that love me.\"\n\n\"When I listen back to this project, I hear a sound that’s so unique and represents me at my best,\" he added. \"This album is me at 26, continuing to evolve with the knowledge that I have garnered throughout the years.\" Previewed by singles \"Please Don’t Fall In Love With Me,\" \"Adore U,\" and \"Ground (Cotton Candy Skies),\" Sincere is a 16-track collection that, most of all, showcases Khalid’s maturing.\n\n\"This all feels like the biggest reset for me,\" he shared on Instagram. \"I feel so reminiscent to how I did when I first started my career 8 years ago. I can’t wait for all of you to experience the album.\"\n\nOrville Peck — 'Stampede' (Aug. 2)\n\nGroundbreaking country singer Orville Peck is about to surprise his audience once again. Following 2022’s Bronco, Stampede — his first duet album, and third overall — spans 15 tracks with collaborations from Elton John, Willie Nelson, Beck, Kylie Minogue, Diplo, and more.\n\nBack in May, Peck teased the project with EP Stampede Vol. 1, featuring songs with Noah Cyrus, Midland, and others. \"This project has always been something I’ve fantasized about, so to see it finally come to fruition really is a dream come true,\" said the South African masked star in a press release.\n\nAmong a busy schedule, Peck also announced that his 6th annual Rodeo will happen on Aug. 23, 24 and 25 in Nashville. It will be headlined by himself and Tanya Tucker, and will feature sets from Medium Build, Reyna Roberts, and more. The Stampede North American tour is underway through October.\n\nLearn more: How Queer Country Artists Are Creating Space For Inclusive Stories In The Genre\n\nBeabadoobee — 'This Is How Tomorrow Moves' (Aug. 9)\n\nFilipino-British singer beabadoobee — also known as Beatrice Laus — is so excited about her upcoming third studio album that she decided to bring its release one week forward. This Is How Tomorrow Moves is now coming out on Aug. 9, via Dirty Hit.\n\nFronted by singles \"Take a Bite,\" \"Coming Home,\" and \"Ever Seen,\" the album was produced by Rick Rubin, and features \"themes of self-acceptance and personal growth,\" per a press release. \"I think I’m more aware of my actions in these songs,\" said Laus. \"In my previous records, I would consistently sing about my reaction towards other people’s doings, like a blame game. But in this record, it’s accepting that there’s an inevitability of my fault in there too.\"\n\nTo crystallize those lessons, the alt-pop star is slated to perform at a one-off acoustic show in London, on Aug. 2. Then, she will play two intimate shows in London and Coventry, and a set at All Points East UK festival. In September, Laus will begin her North American tour, following with a string of November concerts in Europe.\n\nPost Malone — 'F-1 Trillion' (Aug. 16)\n\nPosty has been riding high on the country wave ever since May, when he released the top-charting single \"I Had Some Help\" with Morgan Wallen. Followed by \"Pour Me a Drink\" with Blake Shelton, and more recently by \"Guy For That\" with Luke Combs, his shift into the Nashville scene feels not only natural, but also rewarding.\n\nAll three pre-releases are part of Malone’s sixth studio album, F-1 Trillion. The singer also collaborated with Chris Stapleton and Hardy in tracks yet to be revealed, and featured production by Louis Bell, Charlie Handsome, and Hoskins. F-1 also marks the first time that the singer fully dives into country music, despite dabbling with the genre for years.\n\nTo celebrate this momentous phase, Malone will embark on a North American Tour starting September. In the company of backing band The Fools For You, he will hit cities like Boston, Atlanta, Virginia Beach, Charleston, and wrap up in Nashville in October.\n\nRead more: Post Malone's Country Roots: 8 Key Moments In Covers and Collaborations\n\nTinashe — 'Quantum Baby' (Aug. 16)\n\n\"Quantum Baby is about getting to know me on a deeper level,\" said Tinashe in a press release about her upcoming album. \"It’s about exploring who I am as a person and who I am as an artist. I’ve never been one to be put into a box, so the name ‘Quantum Baby’ encompasses all the different parts that make up who I am as a creative.\"\n\nSpearheaded by April’s viral hit \"Nasty,\" which serves as the album’s lead single, Quantum Baby is the second installment of a trilogy that began with 2023’s BB/ANG3L. \"For BB/ANG3L, I was very inspired by the concept of identity. Exploring both how I self-identify and also challenging the perceptions of others,\" explained Tinashe. \"I’ve enjoyed stripping back layers of aesthetic fluff, smoke and mirrors, and white noise to get down to the core of myself. Who we are at a core level, when we are alone — raw and unfiltered, is what I want this album to reflect.\"\n\nSecond single \"Getting No Sleep\" reflects that forthright perspective: \"Feels Friday like, different night, same vibe / Take you outside, movie scene every time / Flick me up, I’m fitted up, so pretty, no bad side / Not a dog, but it’s in me, taking shots like I’m Lindsay,\" she sings.\n\nRead more: Love \"Nasty\"?

Previously shared singles \"Hang Tight Honey,\" \"Country’s Cool Again,\" and \"4x4xU\" feature on the tracklist, as well as a collaboration with Miranda Lambert on \"Good Horses.\"\n\nSeizing the momentum, Wilson recently opened the Bell Bottoms Up bar in Nashville, and released a Hulu-exclusive documentary, Lainey Wilson: Bell Bottom Country. She is also amidst her North American tour, Country’s Cool Again.\n\nSteve Cropper — 'Friendlytown' (Aug. 23)\n\nTime may be tight, but is also just a number to legendary guitarist Steve Cropper. Best known as a member of Stax house band Booker T. & The M.G.’s and as a guitarist for the Blues Brothers, he’s now 82 years old — but just getting started with his solo project, Steve Cropper & the Midnight Hour.\n\nHis 2021 solo debut album, Fire It Up, was nominated for a GRAMMY award in the Best Contemporary Blues Album category, and the upcoming Friendlytown aims to follow the same steps. \"If your booty is not shaking in the first two bars of this album you’re already dead in a chair,\" said Cropper in a press statement. \"I feel so good about this batch of songs. They’re packed with radio hooks, and we have Billy Gibbons, Brian May, and Tim Montana playing on the album — it’s like guitar heaven.\"\n\nSingle \"Too Much Stress\" with Brian May teases what’s to come in Friendlytown: 13 tracks of unbridled creativity and stirring melodies that bring back your faith in humanity. As Cropper said, \"when I think about my legacy, I want it to be said that I was a nice guy.\"\n\nSofi Tukker — 'BREAD' (Aug. 23)\n\n\"Be really energetic and dance.\" That’s the acronym behind Sofi Tukker’s upcoming BREAD, but could also be their official slogan. The electronic duo formed by Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern bring joy and irreverence to their beats, mixing English with Portuguese, EDM with favela funk, fun with elegance. Now, they come forward with a brand new recipe for their third studio album.\n\n\"BREAD is pure energy,\" said Hawley-Weld in a press release. \"Literally, carbs. That's exactly what we want our music to do. When you put on the album, we want it to give you energy.\" Halpern added, \"We didn't know when we wrote the song ‘Bread’ that it was going to feel like a thesis statement for the album, and we didn't know that was going to be the name of the album initially, but as we were discussing, it became clearer and clearer that what we wanted to say to the world is: the world can be dark but it's also a really fun place.\"\n\nTo get a hint of the BREAD vibes, tune in to singles \"Hey Homie,\" \"Spiral,\" and the cheeky \"Throw Some Ass.\" Then, catch Sofi Tukker live on their world tour starting September in Oceania, North America, and Europe.\n\nFontaines D.C. — 'Romance' (Aug. 23)\n\nFollowing their acclaimed 2022 album Skinty Fia, Irish band Fontaines D.C. are gearing up to release their fourth LP, Romance. This is the post-punk ensemble’s first album under XL Recordings, and first album with producer James Ford, but it’s said to be their \"most assured, inventive, and sonically adventurous\" yet, according to a press release.\n\n\"We’ve always had this sense of idealism and romance,\" said guitarist Conor Deegan of the upcoming record. \"Each album gets further away from observing that through the lens of Ireland, as directly as [debut album] Dogrel. The second album [A Hero’s Death] is about that detachment, and the third [Skinty Fia] is about Irishness dislocated in the diaspora. Now we look to where and what else there is to be romantic about.\"\n\nRomance’s 11 tracks boast many inspirations — not all of them romantic per se. Frantic lead single \"Starburster,\" for example, was inspired by a panic attack that vocalist Grian Chatten suffered at London’s St. Pancras station. Aside from that, other references include the dystopian anime Akira, singer Shygirl, Prodigy, Sega Bodega, and more.\n\nFontaines D.C. will kick off a world tour starting September in the U.S. and Canada, and then head on to Europe and the UK throughout December.\n\nZedd — 'TELOS' (Aug. 30)\n\nThis month also marks the return of German DJ and producer Zedd, who will release his first LP in nearly a decade, TELOS. Described in a press release as a \"profound listening experience,\" the album was crafted in hopes to create deep bonds with the audience. \"I wanted everyone to be able to feel a deeper emotional connection, like how I felt listening to my favorite albums when I was growing up. It was the details, transitions and cohesiveness that made me want to create a truly meaningful body of work,\" said Zedd.\n\nLead single \"Out Of Time\" has been in the works since 2015, and is still one of Zedd’s favorite compositions. \"I made an intro for my live show based on this chord progression, but was never able to finish it,\" he said. \"Bea [Miller] was the missing piece of the puzzle; her voice added an emotional depth that completed the song. \"Out Of Time\" really encapsulates the DNA of the Telos album, which is why I chose it to be the song that introduces this new era.\"\n\nFans will be able to check out how this new era sounds live starting September, as Zedd just announced his TELOS North American tour. Starting in Los Angeles, he will play 18 shows throughout 10 cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, and Dallas.\n\nA$AP Rocky — 'Don’t Be Dumb' (Aug. 30)\n\nOne of 2024’s most awaited releases, A$AP Rocky’s fourth LP, Don’t Be Dumb, will finally drop at the end of the month. It’s been six years since the New Yorker put out his last full effort, Testing, and several changes happened in his life since — including becoming a father to two sons with his partner, Rihanna.\n\nIn a 2023 interview for Dazed, Lord Flacko affirmed that the album feels like his \"best work yet,\" and that he wants to \"leave expectations wide and open. I don’t want to tell you what to expect. I just want people to experience it how they do naturally.\"\n\nDon’t Be Dumb has been teased for a long time, and Rocky previewed three unreleased songs off it at his Rolling Loud performance in July 2023. It is also preceded by singles \"S—in’ Me,\" \"Same Problems?,\" and Pharrell Williams-produced \"RIOT (Rowdy Pipe’n),\" although there’s no confirmation if they will end up on the final tracklist.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nThe first New Music Friday of the summer delivers us fresh jams packed with exciting collaborations and debuts.\n\nThis week features releases from big name, genre-crossing collaborations, including Ariana Grande's remix of \"the boy is mine\" with Brandy and Monica, and Post Malone teaming up with Blake Shelton on their new track \"Pour Me a Drink.\" As you build your new summer playlist, make sure you don't miss out on these ten must-hear tunes.\n\nIce Spice — \"Phat Butt\"\n\nAfter a massive year with the release of her EP Like..? and four nominations at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Ice Spice is ready to level up once again with her newest single, \"Phat Butt.\" With self-assured lyricism on top of a classic drill beat that is true to her sound, the track serves as the second single to be released from her debut album, Y2K!. \"Phat Butt\" comes as both a message to those who lacked belief in Ice Spice’s music career, but also as a quintessential summer anthem.\n\nIn the self-directed music video, the rapper is shown performing in front of a wall of graffiti with grainy video filters, emphasizing the Y2K feel. Ice Spice is set to take on her Y2K World Tour next month and it's no doubt that this \"Phat Butt\" will be a highlight on her setlist.\n\nExplore More: The Rise Of Ice Spice: How The \"Barbie World\" Rapper Turned Viral Moments Into A Full-On Franchise\n\nAriana Grande, Brandy, & Monica — \"the boy is mine (remix)\"\n\nWhen asking different groups who sings the song \"the boy is mine,\" you're likely to get two answers. Some will say pop star Ariana Grande, while others will think of the original 1998 R&B hit by Brandy and Monica, which won the GRAMMY for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal in 1999. Doubling down on the shared name of the track and bridging the generational gap among music lovers, Grande, Brandy, and Monica have come together for a fresh remix of \"the boy is mine,\" and the internet couldn't be more ecstatic.\n\n\"My deepest and sincerest thank you to Brandy and Monica, not only for joining me for this moment, but for your generosity, your kindness, and for the countless ways in which you have inspired me,\" said Grande in an Instagram post announcing the collaboration. \"This is in celebration of you both and the impact that you have had on every vocalist, vocal producer, musician, artist that is creating today.\"\n\nRead More: 5 Takeaways From Ariana Grande's New Album Eternal Sunshine\n\nPost Malone & Blake Shelton — \"Pour Me a Drink\"\n\nPost Malone has been dipping his toes into the country genre for some time now and fans have been anxiously awaiting his promised western era post Cowboy Carter.\n\nMalone and Shelton first ignited excitement with a sneak peek of their song, \"Pour Me a Drink\" at the CMA Fest earlier this month. Since Posty announced the official release on Instagram, fans have eagerly awaited its arrival on streaming services. The track serves as a tantalizing preview of Post Malone's upcoming country album, F-1 Trillion, coming August 16.\n\nRead More: Post Malone's Country Roots: 8 Key Moments In Covers and Collaborations\n\nColdplay — \"feelslikeimfallinginlove\"\n\nColdplay has been generating excitement as they embark on their next chapter, with the release of their latest single, \"feelslikeimfallinginlove.\" Over the past few weeks, they've been feeding fans with sneak peeks on social media and performing the song live on their world tour.\n\nThe track sets the stage for the release of Coldplay's highly anticipated tenth studio album, Moon Music, set to land in early October. True to their brand, this song is geared to uplift your spirits, making it the perfect anthem for carefree summer car rides with the windows down.\n\nRead More: How Coldplay's Parachutes Ushered In A New Wave Of Mild-Mannered Guitar Bands\n\nKygo — 'Kygo'\n\nTen years into his career, Norwegian DJ Kygo is dropping his self-titled album, Kygo, which he teased last week with the single \"Me Before You\" featuring Plested. The song, backed by a thumping mid-tempo instrumental, vividly narrates the transformative experience of being deeply influenced by someone in a relationship and not wanting to return to who you were before. The 18-track project features diverse and vibrant collaborations with unexpected guests like the Jonas Brothers and Ava Max.\n\nMaren Morris & Julia Michaels — \"cut!\"\n\nMaren Morris and Julia Michaels, GRAMMY-winners both independently renowned for their iconic music collaborations, are now joining forces to release their electrifying new track, \"cut!\" The duo has been working together for a few years, with Michaels' co-writing Morris' \"Circles Around Town,\" which received a nomination for Best Country Song at the 2023 GRAMMYs. So, while this collaboration might not come as a surprise, it is still certainly a welcomed one.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus from releasing music, pop enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating Morris' return to the spotlight. \"Can't wait to cathartically scream f*ck at the top of our lungs together,\" Morris said in an Instagram post announcing the track.\n\nLearn More: Behind Julia Michaels' Hits: From Working With Britney & Bieber To Writing For Wish\n\nGracie Abrams — 'The Secret of Us'\n\nBuilding on the success of her debut album, Good Riddance, and the skyrocketing momentum of her career after opening The Eras Tour, California-native Gracie Abrams has unveiled her much-anticipated sophomore album, The Secret of Us.\n\nThe album includes the track, \"Close to You,\" which was released ahead of the album drop as the full realization of a 20-second snippet that Abrams posted on Instagram back in 2018. After sitting on the track for six years and relentless pleas from fans, the pop artist finally delivered the full song — a mesmerizing blend of Abrams’ vocal prowess and heartfelt lyricism.\n\nLearn More: How Making Good Riddance Helped Gracie Abrams Surrender To Change And Lean Into The Present\n\n6LACK — \"F**k The Rap Game\"\n\n6LACK is rebranding himself and making sure everyone knows. The release of his newest track, \"F**k The Rap Game\" addresses the phenomenon of getting caught up in the glitz and glamor of the entertainment business, tying in the importance of staying true to one's roots. The Atlanta-raised artist is currently on tour with rapper Russ, with whom he recently released the single \"Workin On Me,” another nod to 6LACK's ongoing mission of self-reflection and deep introspection.\n\n“A better me equals a better you equals a better us. That’s been the formula of my life. I can’t thrive unless I’m around people who are constantly trying to better themselves as individuals,” 6LACK said in an interview with GRAMMY.com last year. “It took a second of me really looking at myself in the mirror, being honest and saying: I am not doing as much work on myself as I claim to be doing and want to be doing on myself.”\n\nRead More: 6lack On His Comeback Album SIHAL: \"I’m Playing A Different Game\"\n\nThe Joy — 'The Joy'\n\nMonths after their buzzworthy performance with Doja Cat at Coachella, South African quintet The Joy has released their self-titled album through Transgressive Records. The album was recorded live, in real time, at Church Studios in London and features no instruments or overdubs — just pure, raw vocals that capture the group's authentic sound.\n\nThe Joy came together through a serendipitous twist of fate. Years back, five boys arrived early to their school choir practice and decided to have an impromptu jam session. Realizing their undeniable musical chemistry, The Joy was born, quickly garnering global acclaim. \"They are, like, my favorite group,\" Jennifer Hudson exclaimed on her talk show.\n\nSurfaces — 'good morning'\n\nKnown for their feel-good tunes that took over TikTok in 2019, Surfaces presents their sixth album, Good Morning. In tracks like, “Real Estate,” the band chronicles the idea of exploring one’s mind and thoughts, above all other features, backed by a tropical lo-fi instrumental, as well as a steady thump of a bass, and trilling trumpets.\n\n“’Real Estate’ is about the infatuation with that place in someone’s mind that you can’t get enough of,” Surfaces explained in a press statement. “It’s a familiar place to call home that feels safe and deserves all the love in the world. We wanted to capture the bliss of finding that space and reveling in it.”\n\nLauren Watkins — 'The Heartbroken Record'\n\nLauren Watkins has a packed summer schedule, which includes opening for country artist Morgan Wallen and releasing her second studio album, The Heartbroken Record. This project draws inspiration from music industry veterans like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, while also infusing influences from contemporary artists like Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert. Each track from the album underscores stories of love and loss, woven together by the overarching theme of heartbreak.\n\n\"I didn't want to just put an album out — I wanted it to be purposeful,\" Watkins said in a press statement. \"It's the past several years of my life, and that was just so much heartbreak and dramatic girl-feelings, but I think in a really deep and relatable way… and it just needs to get off my chest.\"\n\nWhy 2024 Is The Year Women In Country Music Will Finally Have Their Moment\n\nPeso Pluma marked his musical destiny with a Tupac tribute tattoo in the center of his clavicle: \"All Eyez On Me.\"\n\nThe Mexican artist, born Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija, doesn't remember exactly what year he inked his chest. He knows it was well before his debut in music. Those four words reflected Peso's irrefutable confidence that the world's eyes would eventually be on him.\n\nThe world's eyes are indeed on Peso Pluma. In less than two years, the singer achieved global fame by singing corridos tumbados, traversing a path never before trodden by a música Mexicana artist.\n\nAt 25, Peso Pluma is at the forefront of a new generation of música Mexicana artists that have successfully modernized traditional Mexican rhythms, such as corridos, by infusing them with elements from urban music and a hip-hop aesthetic. The weight of representing an entire genre and a country could be great for some. But pressure doesn't affect Peso Pluma; on the contrary, it motivates him to keep working to exalt his roots.\n\n\"We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go. And that doesn't mean we have to slow down; it doesn't mean everything is over. This is the beginning of everything,\" Peso Pluma said in aTikTok video before a performance at the Toyota Arena in Ontario, Canada, a little over a year ago.\n\nOut June 20, Peso's extensive new album ÉXODO seeks to cement his global star status further. Over 24 tracks, the singer continues to explore corridos tumbados and digs into his urban side via much-awaited collaborations with reggaeton and hip-hop icons. Among those big names is Peso's teenage idol, the American rapper and producer Quavo, as well as further afield collaborations with Cardi B.\n\n\"ÉXODO is a project I've been working on for over a year before we even won the GRAMMY. GÉNESIS was an incredibly special project, and I knew we couldn't make the same diamond twice,\" the singer tells GRAMMY.com in a written interview.\n\nPeso Pluma's path to the global stage has been lightning-fast. While he started releasing songs in 2020, Peso will remember March 2023 as the month that propelled him into global mega-stardom. His collaboration with Eslabón Armado on \"Ella Baila Sola\" led him to become a household name outside his native Mexico.\n\nThe hit resonated with an audience eager for new sounds, accompanying social media videos and surpassing a billion streams on Spotify. \"Ella Baila Sola\" became the first Mexican music track to top the platform's global chart. On Billboard, it conquered No. 1 on the magazine's Global 200 chart for six weeks and reached the coveted No. 4 spot on the Hot 100 chart. The mega-hit took Peso Pluma and Eslabon Armado to make their Latin GRAMMY stage debut in November with an electrifying performance.\n\nAnother collaboration, \"La Bebe (Remix)\" with Mexican reggaeton artist Yng Lvcas, released a day after \"Ella Baila Sola,\" also contributed to Peso Pluma's virality in a completely different genre, but one in which he feels comfortable: urban music.\n\nLearn more: Peso Pluma's 10 Biggest Collabs: From \"Bzrp Sessions\" To \"Ella Baila Sola\" &\"Igual Que Un Ángel\"\n\nAs Peso Pluma gained traction with a global audience, his February 2022 single with Raúl Vega, put him, for better or worse, on the map in Mexico. The warlike content of \"El Belicón\" lyrics and video clip attracted attention for the way it allegedly promoted narcoculture.\n\nDespite growing criticism, Peso Pluma remained tight-lipped regarding references to high-profile members of the Mexican drug trade, as well as drug use and trafficking. In a rare admission toGQ magazine, the singer explained this is a \"delicate subject to talk about, but you have to touch on it with transparency — because it's the reality of things.\"\n\n\"In hip-hop, in rap, just like in corridos, and other urban music like reggaeton, it talks about reality. We're not promoting delinquency at all. We're only talking about things that happen in real life,\" the singer explained.\n\nWith the success of \"El Belicón\" and \"Ella Baila Sola\" under his belt, Peso Pluma released GÉNESIS in June 2023. Despite being his third album, Peso considers it his true debut in music.\n\n\"I didn't want to delete my previous albums [Efectos Secundario and Ah Y Que?] because they represent my beginnings,\" Peso toldBillboard in a cover story published a few weeks after the release of GÉNESIS. In the same conversation, the singer said he saw himself winning his first GRAMMY and breaking more records.\n\nRead more: 5 Takeaways From Peso Pluma's New Album 'GÉNESIS'\n\nIn February 2024, Peso Pluma did just that. He took home the golden gramophone for Best Música Mexicana Album (Including Tejano) — his first GRAMMY Award. This victory didn't weigh on him as he approached his next production. \"It pushed me to want to create something different that the fans haven't heard from me before,\" Peso Pluma tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nWhile GÉNESIS and ÉXODO may differ in substance, they share similarities beyond music. That both records pull from the Bible for their names is not a random occurrence; the opening book of the Hebrew and Christian Bible delves into the genesis of creation, while the Book of Exodus explores the themes of liberation, redemption, and Moses' role in leading the Israelites through the uncharted waters of the Red Sea.\n\n\"ÉXODO is the continuation of GÉNESIS, which was the beginning,\" Peso Pluma explains to GRAMMY.com. \"ÉXODO means new beginnings, a new era for me. We are preparing for the next chapter, and that's what we are doing for Mexican music, paving the way, laying the groundwork for what's next because it doesn't stop here.\"\n\nHis \"sophomore\" album is divided into two discs: the first is corridos, and the second is urban. It also continues the line of collaborations, with twenty tracks where Peso Pluma shares the limelight.\n\n\"Some of my fans were craving música Mexicana, and some were craving urbano, and I wanted to give them everything while still staying true to myself and choosing songs and lyrics that spoke to me,\" he continues.\n\nÉXODO's disc one starts with \"LA DURANGO,\" the album's fourth single, featuring Eslabon Armando and Junior H. In the record, he also invites collaborators such as Natanael Cano and Gabito Ballesteros for \"VINO TINTO\" and Mexican rising star Ivan Cornejo on the melancholic \"RELOJ,\" among others.\n\nFor Side B, Peso enlisted heavyweights from the urban genre in the Anglo and Latin markets: Anitta in the steamy \"BELLAKEO,\" Rich The Kid in the bilingual \"GIMME A SECOND,\" and Quavo in the existential trap \"PA NO PENSAR.\" Cardi B, Arcángel, Ryan Castro, Kenia OS, and DJ Snake complete ÉXODO's genre crossover.\n\nÉXODO, luxury, drugs, alcohol, and women continue to take center stage in the lyrics, accompanied by fast-paced guitar-driven melodies and reverb-dense vocals. However, the production sheds light on the vulnerable side of Peso and explores the unexpected consequences of becoming globally famous.\n\n\"Fans really get to see the other side of the coin; there are two sides to me. It's darker, rawer,\" Peso says about the record.\n\nIn the songs \"HOLLYWOOD\" and \"LA PATRULLA,\" for example, Peso details how this musical path keeps him up at night, as well as his aspirations, and how he remains the same despite his success.\n\nPerhaps one of the deepest and rawest songs on the album is \"14:14,\" a track inspired by the Bible verse 14:14 from the Book of Exodus, which, the singer explains, was fundamental amidst the turbulence he faced on the way to global stardom.\n\n\"[The] verse 14:14 says 'The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.' This verse couldn't be truer,\" Peso Pluma says. \"Over time, I learned to really trust in this and believe that some things are not up to me and I should trust the process.\"\n\nIn the song — one of the few on the album without a collaboration — Peso references the challenges of his profession and how his faith has kept him afloat amid the vicissitudes. \"Things from the job that no one understands/I hide the rosary under my shirt so I don't poison myself, so I don't feel guilty/because whatever happens, the Boss will forgive me,\" he sings.\n\nIn \"BRUCE WAYNE,\" Peso Pluma croons about the passionate feelings his career arouses: \"First they love you, and then they hate you/wishing the worst, envy and death,\" the song says.\n\nThe singer resorts to comparing himself to a superhero figure again. In an unusual twist, Peso crosses comic universes, moving from his now traditional reference to Spider-Man to one from the DC Comics world: Bruce Wayne, Batman's secret identity. A wealthy man, part of Gotham's high society, Bruce Wayne is known for transforming his darkness into power while remaining reserved and isolated.\n\n\"Everyone has two sides of them, even me,\" Peso tells GRAMMY.com. \"Peso Pluma on stage is a high-energy person, someone who is powerful and dominates a show and isn't afraid of anything. And then there is Hassan, who's chill and more relaxed and who deals with all the realities of life.\"\n\nDuring the year and a half it took him to complete ÉXODO, Peso Pluma had to deal with the diverse nuances of a global star's life, including a widely publicized breakup from Argentine rapper/singer Nicki Nicole, the cancellation of one of his shows in October 2023 after a Mexico drug cartel issued a death threat against him, and a media frenzy over his alleged admission to a rehabilitation clinic, the latest a rumor he laid to rest during a March interview withRolling Stone for his Future of Music cover story.\n\n\"The reality is, all these days, I've been in the studio working on ÉXODO,\" the artist explained to Rolling Stone.\n\nMost of 2023 was a successful balancing act for Peso Pluma, who combined touring, an album release, rare media engagements, two Coachella appearances, all the while developing another record. According to the singer, ÉXODO was created in Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and Mexico. \"We go to the studio everywhere!\" Peso says. \"It doesn't really matter where we are; I love to get into the studio and work when we have free time.\"\n\nLike GÉNESIS, ÉXODO will be released via Peso Pluma's Double P Records, of which he is the CEO and A&R. Much of the talent the Mexican singer has signed to his label took part in the album's production, and songwriting process.\n\n\"For the Mexican music side, I had the whole [touring] band with me; I like to have them involved in the process so that we can all give our input on how it sounds, discuss what we think needs to be changed, create new ideas,\" he explains.\n\nPeso Pluma knows that echoing the success of 2023 is no easy task. He was the most streamed artist in the U.S. on YouTube, surpassing Taylor Swift and Bad Bunny, and was the second most-listened to Latin artist in the country, amassing an impressive 1.9 billion streams, according to Luminate.\n\nMúsica Mexicana emerged as one of the most successful genres in 2023, witnessing a remarkable 60 percent surge in streaming numbers, adds Luminate's annual report, crediting Peso Pluma along Eslabon Armado, Junior H, and Fuerza Regida as part of this success.\n\nCollaborations on and off the mic have undoubtedly played a significant role in the rise of Música Mexicana on the global stage. Peso knows that the key to continuing onward is teaming up with renowned artists inside and outside his genre.\n\n\"All of us coming together is what pushed música Mexicana to go global,\" the singer affirms. \"We showed the world what Mexico has to offer, and now no one can deny the power and talent we have in our country.\"\n\nShakira's Road To 'Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran': How Overcoming A Breakup Opened A New Chapter In Her Artistry"
