Early life

He was born Ralph Forbes Taylor in Wandsworth, London, the son of Ernest John "E.J." and Ethel Louise Taylor. His mother would become known as Mary Forbes, a stage and film actress. His younger sister was actress Brenda Forbes (born Dorothy Brenda Taylor). He was baptized on 6 November 1904 and his birth registered in the last quarter of 1904.

Forbes met with an accident while playing football at Denstone College in Staffordshire which resulted in a scar on his cheek.

He started off in films, then went on stage. In the United States he appeared onstage opposite actress Ruth Chatterton, who became his first wife in 1924; the couple divorced in 1932. He later married actress Heather Angel in 1934; that marriage also ended in divorce. His last wife, whom he married in 1946, was actress Dora Sayers.

Later years

His last years were given to working on the Broadway stage. One of his last stage appearances was in a revival of Shaw's You Never Can Tell in 1948. He died at Montefiore Hospital in The Bronx, New York in 1951, aged 46.
