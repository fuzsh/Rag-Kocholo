        "text": "page 29 note a The mention of both Mr. Stern and Mrs. Baily in this sentence, suggests that the former was Mr. (afterwards Major-General) Robert Stearne, whose wife was sister of Mrs. Bayly. A MS. history of his regiment (the First, or Royal Regiment of Ireland), by General Stearne, was lately sold in London among the collections of Sir William Betham. It comprises the period from 1678 to 1712. The owner of this Journal possesses also a MS. narrative, by General Stearne, of Queen Anne's wars in Flanders. About the year 1830 a large collection of tracts and pamphlets which belonged to the General, and which is said to have amounted to the number of 300 volumes, was sold and scattered in Cork; we have since heard of about one hundred volumes of them in ascertained hands. It appears from another MS. that he took much interest in astronomy and astrology. Beatson, in his Political Index, calls him “Richard,” and places him among the Brigadier-Generals; but he was a Major-General in 1730, and, from his being called “the Right Hon. General Stearne” in a list of subscribers to Dawson's translation of Demosthenes in 1732, the year of his death, it may be supposed that he was a privycouncillor. In Burke's History of the Commoners, in the pedigree of Tighe, he is assumed to be brother of Bishop Stearne, but this is a mistake. A niece of General Stearne's wife married the Rev. Boyle Davies, a son of the Dean, which accounts for the General's manuscript being in the same hands as the Journal. This Mrs. Davies had a brother who was in some sort a cause of England's supremacy in India: for he furnished his brother-in-law, Mr. (afterwards Sir) Eyre Coote, with pecuniary means for obtaining reinstatement in the army after he had been deprived of his commission for apparent cowardice at the battle of Preston Pans. Very few particulars of this great man's life are known to the public except his military career. Some of his private letters, however, have been preserved. From one of these we learn that in the war of the American Revolution he strongly disapproved of concessions to the insurgents. The letter is without date, but the time may perhaps he ascertained, for it was just after some election to a seat in Parliament for which Sir Eyre was a candidate, and before the spring of the year in which his regiment was to be “on Dublin duty.” His words are, “I do not know how the trading people in Cork are affected by the American disturbances, but here it occasions no small bustle; but I hope we shall have firmness sufficient to preserve the superiority of this country over them.” It may perhaps be a question whether the Americans would have succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the mother country if Sir Eyre had commanded against them.\n\npage 58 note b Probably Mr. John Bayly, husband of Mrs. Bayly, mentioned before (p. 29). His father, John Bayly, was mayor of Cork in 1674, and acquired a considerable estate, including Castlemore, a castle and lands forfeited by Phelim Mac Owen Carthy in 1641. He also became a justice of peace for the county of Cork. Mr. John Bayly, the son, is favourably mentioned by Smith in his History of Cork (1750), vol. i. p. 204, as an agricultural improver, and at p. 208 is given the inscription on his monument, which tells us that he served in the wars of Ireland, and was a justice of the peace, and died in 1719. Smith calls him Captain Bayly of Castlemore. He left five daughters: the eldest carried the estates into the family of Rye, by marriage with Colonel George Rye, author of a Tract on Agriculture, published in 1730. Another of Mr. Bayly's daughters married Doctor Joseph Rogers, son of George Rogers, elsewhere mentioned in this Journal. The Doctor was author of an able medical work. Another of the daughters married Henry Sheares, esq. and their son, Henry, was M.P. for Clonakilty 1761, and father of Henry and John Sheares, who were executed as rebels in 1798; another daughter married one of the Travers family. Castlemore is now a ruin. When Smith wrote, it was inhabited by Mr. Travers. There was another John Bayly about this time, who was mayor of Cork in 1679. He seems to have been connected with Cornwall, and left only daughters. On the 11th of October, 1694, there was an order of Council, “That in the room of Alderman Bayly of Castlemore, who is very ancient and decrepit, and never likely to appear at this board, and the room of Alderman Bayly, junior, who lives in England, until he shall return, that (others named) be sworn of the Council.”\n\npage 95 note a Horace was the name of one of the sons of Colonel Richard Townsend, who in 1648, with Colonel Doyley, attempted, without their general Lord Inchiquin's consent, to betray the towns of Munster to the English parliament for arrears of pay, but was imprisoned by Lord Inchiquin. Nevertheless one of his sons was named Bryen, probably in respect to that Lord. This Bryen's descendants are a flourishing family in the county of Cork, in several branches. His younger son John married a daughter of Colonel Barry by Susan daughter of John Townsend (eldest son of Colonel Richard) and his wife Katharine, daughter of the second Earl of Barrymore, and, this earldom being extinct, the descendants of the above John Townsend claim the feodal barony of Barry, created by writ of summons in 1490. But the descent of it was very loose and arbitrary. John Lord Barry, in 1556, entailed his estates on James, styled Baryroe, a distant relation, and whose father was thought to have been illegitimate, passing over several elder subsisting branches, even of the male line; and the Crown, without questioning the right, continued the writs of summons to James and his descendants. David, son and successor to this James, obtained a release from Margaret, daughter to James Muirtagh Barry, and wife of William Shaine Mac Cotter of Ballycopnier, of the inheritance of her father as Barrymoyle, or bald Barry, (a nick-name derived from an ancestor William Lord Barry, who was bald), and another release of the same from Ellen, daughter of John Barry, and wife of Magner, from which it would seem that females might even then have been heirs general. However, even in that case, a new barony must have been created in James Barry, which would vest in the Townsends, if legitimately descended; but this is not certain, for it is said that Colonel Barry, when he married Susan Townsend, had another wife, Mary Anselme, living in England. (As to the Barrys see Lodge and Harl. MS. 1425).\n\npage 106 note b Walter Chetwynd, esq. He died in 1692, and was succeeded hy his cousin-german, John Chetwynd, whose son was created a peer of Ireland in 1717. Genealogists begin the pedigree with Adam de Chetwynd, living in the 13th century, who, says Dugdale, was of such distinction in those early times, as to marry Agnes, daughter of John Lord Lovel, Baron of Dockinges. But in the Heralds’ Visitation (Harl. MS. 6128), this Adam is called “Alanus,” and his son is called “John Chetwynd, fil's Alani, sans date,” from which it is evident that the father's name Alanus was conjectured from the mention of the son in a deed without date. But it would seem rather that Fitzalan was the original name of the family, and that this branch took the name of Chetwynd from that of the lands given to a younger son, for in Testa de Neville the above John de Chetwind is mentioned as holding two knight's fees in Chetwind, of the Barony of John Fitzalan (J. fil’ Alani), who was afterwards Earl of ArundeL We may take this opportunity of correcting another part of the published pedigree, which tells us that Sir Philip de Chetwynd married the widow of Lord Ferrers, and daughter of Thomas de la Roche, and died having had a son, William, ancestor of the present noble family. It is evident, however, from the above Visitation, that the compiler of it had before him an inquisition taken on the death of the mother of Sir Philip, who died before her, and by this it was found that Humphry Hextall, her cousin, was her heir-at-law, so that her son Sir Philip could not have left issue.\n\npage 116 note a Laurence Sterne, in his sketch of his own life, tells us that his father”s regiment was ordered to Mullingar (in 1722), “where,” says he, “by Providence we stumbled upon a kind relation, a collateral descendant from Archbishop Sterne, who took us all to his castle, and kindly entertained us for a year, and sent us to the regiment at Carrickfergus loaded with kindnesses, ” The above Archbishop (of York) was great-grandfather of Laurence Sterne. Mullingar is in the county of Westmeath. Robert Stearne, esq. of Tullinally, in that county, made his will in 1658, in which he describes himself as “at present in the Lord Fleetwood's regiment of foot.” He left considerable estates in Antrim, Westmeath, and Kerry, to his sons Robert and John, for part of which they afterwards passed patents. He names also his brothers John and James, the former of whom was probably Doctor John Stearne, F.T.C.D., father of John Stearne, Bishop of Clogher. Robert the son was the above Captain, afterwards Major-General, Stearne, mentioned in note at p. 29. He had two nephews named Tighe, whose estates lay in the above county of Westmeath, in which Laurence Sterne met his kind relation, who therefore was probably either one of the Stearne family (notwithstanding the difference of spelling) or of the Tighe family. In Burke's Landed Gentry (1844), under “Hill of Doneraile,” is mention of Anne Cooke, grand-daughter of the Rev. John Sterne, and great-grand-daughter of the Archbishop of York, and the above Robert Stearne of Tullinally names his cousin Lieutenant Robert Cooke, which is a slight evidence of some connection with Laurence Sterne. General Stearne continued in active employment. He was for some time Governor of Duncannon fort, and at the time of his death he was Governor or Master of the Royal Hospital near Dublin, an office now usually assigned to the Commander-in-Chief. On his death, a paper containing some doggrel verses, still extant, was presented on the part of the inmates of the hospital to his widow, who was paternal aunt of Dr. Timothy Tuekey, mentioned by Smith (vol. ii. p. 398) as having kept the diary of the weather in Cork, from which he obtained his information.\n\npage 120 note a Smith, vol. i. p. 212, tells us that Captain Hedges purchased Kilcrea from the Hollowblade Company. His descendants added the name of Eyre, though latterly not often called by it, and resided at Mount Hedges, but more lately at Macroom Castle. The late Robert Hedges, esq. of that place, was reputed the chief commoner of the county of Cork. On his death the estates were divided. The Macroom estate came to a younger son of his nephew the Earl of Bantry, who has added the name of Hedges to that of White. Macroom Castle was built in the time of King John. It is remarkable for its immense covering of ivy. The Hedges family are deduced, in a pedigree drawn up in 1689, from John Lacy, of a Cornish family, whose children, born in Queen Elizabeth's time, bore the name of Lacy alias Hedges. One of them had a son, Robert Hedges of Youghal, who was father of Sir William Hedges of London, Knt. and of Robert Hedges of the Queen's County, ancestor of the Cork family. Henry Hedges, another grandson of Lacy, was father of Sir Charles Hedges, Judge of the English Court of Admiralty. Sir William Hedges of London had a son Charles, who married Catharine daughter of Bartholomew Tate, and had a daughter Susanna, who, marrying Sir Cecil Bishopp, has transmitted to her descendants the barony of Zouch, derived through the Tates. The present Mr. White Hedges of Macroom Castle is descended from the Journalist, his father the first Earl of Bantry being grandson of Richard White, esq. by his wife Martha, daughter of the Rev. Richard Davies, son of the Dean.\n\npage *121 note a This Captain Neville and Mr. Pooley mentioned in the next following paragraph, and who is elsewhere in the diary called Robert, seem to have been relations; Robert Pooley's mother was a Neville. We extract the following passage from Playfair's Family Antiquity, vol. vii. p. 703, relating to these and some other families whose members are alluded to in this diary. “Frances Pooley was the grand-daughter of Pooley, esq. who married the sister of sir Richard Southwell. Her father was William Pooley of Hartist, near St. Edmundsbury, in Suffolk, esq.: he married Douglas Neville, third daughter and co-heiress of Edward Neville, esq. (son and heir of Francis second son of Edward Neville, Baron Abergavenny in 1587, by Catherine, daughter of Sir John Brome of Halton, in the county of Oxford, Knt.) who married Margaret, daughter of Sir Francis Palmes, Knt. Anne, the eldest sister of Douglas Neville, married Sir Richard Southwell, of Ireland; and after his decease became wife of Colonel John Trenchard, by whom she left issue, William and Francis Trenchard. Her second sister married Charles Longueville, Lord Grey of Ruthvyn, whose only daughter and heiress, Susan, married sir Henry Yelverton, Knt. William Pooley had issue five sons, viz. Thomas Neville, John, Giles, and Robert, and three daughters. Of the sons, Thomas, the eldest, had issue one daughter, Elizabeth, who married Colonel Paul, and died without issue. Neville, the second son, was a barrister in Dublin, »nd marrying Mary, eldest daughter of Sir Humphrey Jervais, of Dublin, had issue a daughter, who married Brinsley, Lord Newtown Butler, created Viscount Lanesborough.\n\nJohn, the third son, died unmarried : he was Bishop of Cloyne, and afterwards of Raphoe, and his will is dated January 30,1710. He left considerable sums to public charities, and to improve several churches, and his houses in Dublin were left to the Blue Coat Hospital, and other public institutions. He left £200 to make a north and south aisle to Raphoe Church; £120 to raise the steeple of the Cathedral in Kilkenny; and the Church at Youghal, and the Cathedral at Cloyne, had each a small mark of his bounty, to build fonts. The Rev. Dr. Giles Pooley, the fourth son, had preferment in London, and left issue two daughters, one of which married Mr. Wittenoom, and left several children. Robert, the fifth son, was a commissioner of Excise, and died single. Of the three daughters, Elizabeth died -without issue, Frances married Sir Richard Hull, and Catherine married Daniel Molyneux, of Ballymulvey, in the county of Longford, esq. by whom she had three sons: viz. Pooley Molyneux, esq. to whom Mr. Hull left his house at Hammersmith for his Ufa, and who died in 1772, the same year with Mr. Hull; Thomas and Adam, who died unmarried. The daughters were, Elizabeth, Mary, and Dorothy, the eldest of which married the Rev. Samuel Shuldham, and had issue two sons, viz. Samuel and Molyneux ; the former of whom inherited the estates of his uncle Pooley Molyneux, but dying without issue, they came to his brother Molyneux, created Lord Shuldham.\n\npage 149 note a The Cove, oftener called “Cove,” is mentioned by Smith (1750) as a village inhabited by seamen and revenue officers. By strangers the “Cove of Cork “has been understood to mean Cork Harbour. In 1848 the Queen visited Cork, and was prevailed on by the inhabitants of Cove to give to their town the name of “Queenstown;” its increase in size and importance producing a jealousy of the mother city and a desire to be more distinguished from it, though it is in a great degree supported by the resort of citizens of Cork in the summer months. It has however become a place of commerce. “The Cove “was on the south shore of Inismore or “the great island,” called also “the Island of Barrymore “and “Barry's Island.” In 1638 David Earl of Barrymore made a lease to one Astwood of the lands of Ballyvilloon, otherwise called “the Cove,” “the Cove ;” but it is now flat ground, doubtless made artificially. From this place towards the west there was lately a row of mean cabins and cottages which the late Viscount Midleton, in prosecution of intended improvements, demolished. But it is towards the east that the town mainly extended, the most easterly part seeming the oldest, while on Ballyvilloon is springing up a very handsome quarter. The above Edmond Cotter, who possessed the Cove, was father of Sir James Cotter, a military partizan of King James in the wars of which this Journal treats. Edmond is styled of Barry's Island in 1627, though he afterwards resided elsewhere. The family seem to have long resided in this island, and were called MacCotter. In a deed of 1573, relating to lands in the Great Island, is mention of Gerald son of William (juvenis) Mao Coter. It is witnessed by James McCotter and Edmond Boy (yellow) McCotter. In another deed of 1572, relating to lands in the same island, is mention of James son of Maurice McCothir. In 1529 Mauricius McCottyr occurs as witness to a deed. Another branch of the Cotters were of Coppingerstown Castle—in Irish “Ballyeopiner.” See note, p. 95, where this name appears with the “mac ;” but subsequently, in inquisitions p.m., this is omitted. Sir James L. Cotter, Bart, is in possession of a letter from the Duke of Tyrconnel to the above Sir James Cotter, respecting the conduct of the war. There were also some documents from which it appeared that Sir James used great but unavailing exertions to raise new levies among the “Creaghts,” a sort of wandering Irish who lived in moveable wicker huts, of whom a full account may be seen in the Kilkenny Archæological Journal for Nov. 1855. For his early career see Ludlow's Memoirs, pp. 428, 419, and 398, and Harris’ Life of King William, Appendix, p. xxxiv.\n\npage 152 note c Both Story and the Dean call this the steeple, but it may be doubted whether it was not the ancient “round tower” which stood in the churchyard, for this was nearer to the fort, as appears from the plan of Cork in Pacata Hibernia, where “the round or watch tower “is placed eastward of the cathedral, but westward of the church of St. Mary de Nard, round the site of which it is ascertained that the fort was built, while it appears that the steeple was westward of the cathedral, and, like the tower, stood by itself, as appears too in an older map of 1545. When Boullaye le Gouz was here the round tower was (as he tells us in a work published in 1653) more than 100 feet high. It is possible that the Dean's military ardour may have been the cause of the destruction of this interesting relic of antiquity, for we learn from other sources that the fire returned from the fort shook the steeple exceedingly. There is not a vestige of it now remaining above ground. Story's map, in many respects very incorrect, shews neither steeple nor round tower apart from the cathedral, and this gives some ground for supposing that both these separate structures were removed before the siege of Cork. Smith's expression, that “some years ago an ancient round tower stood in the churchyard a little detached from the church,” suggests a different opinion. But it afterwards appears (vol. ii. p. 207) that he knew nothing of it but from Ware's account. In a small plan of Cork on the margin of the map of Munster, in “Pacata Hibernia,” it is represented as tapering from the bottom to a point at the top, and called “the spire:” and it is placed towards the west of the churchyard, which seems to have been done as an expedient to bring the structure within the boundary line; for in a plan of the city in the library of Trinity College, of the date of 1602, and in which also it is called “the spire,” and depicted truly like a round tower, though perhaps a little too tapering, it is placed some distance to the south-east of the cathedral, about the spot where some peculiar stones and sculpture have been found, and which is popularly said to have been the grave of St. Finbar. There is no tradition as to the exact site of the tower.\n\npage 153 note a There was a mill here in very ancient times. King Edward III. confirmed a grant made by the corporation of Cork to William son of Walter Droup, of eighty perches of ground in length, and two perches in breadth, in Cork and in Dungarvan, in the suburb of Cork, lying from the thread (filo) of water of the Lee, to the furthest part of the stone column of the middle bridge of the said city, together with the watercourse flowing and reflowing through the said ground, to build a mill there. (See Rolls of Chancery, p. 182.) This mill is in Fishshamble Lane, and is still in active operation. But, judging by inspection of the localities, the measurement of 80 perches seems a misprint for 30.\n\nIt appears from the foregoing and from other authorities, that the original Danish City of Cork did not, as is oommonly supposed, occupy the whole space which was afterwards surrounded by walls, but only about half of it: and that all that portion northward of the above millstream was a suburb called Dungarvan, which comprised the present parish of St. Peter's; and this agrees with a record mentioned by Smith, vol. i. p. 74S note. Dungarvan is men - tioned as a suburb so lately as the reign of Elizabeth, though within the walls.\n\npage 153 note b This had been an abbey of Augustinian monks. Smith mentions two dates assigned for its foundation, viz. about 1420, and in the reign of Edward I. The latter must be the more correct, for among the ancient deeds belonging to T. R. Sarsfield, Esq. is a conveyance from Walter Newelond and Margery Forester his wife to David le Blound of a messuage in the street of St. John the Baptist, near Cork, extending in length from the said street on the south to the way which leads from the street of St. John the Evangelist to the house of the friars of the order of St. Augtistin on the north, and in breadth from the common lane leading from the street of St. John the Baptist to the sea (tide way?) on the east to a certain curtilage of the said friars on the west. This bears date Tuesday next after the feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the 16th year of King Edward II. and is witnessed by John Galagre mayor and William Droup and Adam Newlons bailiffs of Cork, Walter de Kerdif, Perceval Vincent, Adam Reych, John FitzHenry, Richard Reych, and Walter Waldingst, One of the seals is gone : the other represents two keys joined like a pair of tongs. When Smith wrote the abbey was used as a sugar-house, and it so continued till 1799, when it was burned. A small street of houses was afterwards built on the site by Lieut. Philip Donovan, and named Donovan Street, but, falling into other hands, it has since obtained the name of Cumberland Street. The descent of Lieut. Philip Donovan of Donovan Street from the chiefsof that name has been published with Dr. O'Donovan's translation of the Annals of the Pour Masters. The tower and a wall containing some small pointed windows are all that remain of the abbey.\n\npage 154 note b Mr. D'Alton, in his lately-published “King James's Army List,” mentions several of this name: Donagh McCarty, Captain in the Earl of Clancarthy's regiment; Donagh McCarty, Lieutenant in Colonel Justin McCarty's regiment ; and at page 10 a Captain Daniel Macarty. The Earl of Clancarthy was the head of this family. Cormac Oge McCarthy wascreated Baron of Blarney and Viscount Muskery in 1628. His son Donagh was raised to the earldom of Clancarthy ; he married a sister of the Duke of Ormond, and was grandfather of the above Earl, whose regiment was taken prisoners at the surrender of Cork.\n\nThe male descendants of the first of these lords have become extinct. Their principal castle (Blarney) is a ruin in the midst of fine old plantations, the property of the Jeffreyes family, as the well known song intimates:—\n\n‘Tis Lady Jeffreyes that owns that station,\n\nLike Alexander or Helen fair,\n\nThere's no commander in all this nation\n\nIn emulation can with her compare.\n\nThis lady, popularly called Lady Jeffreyes from being the sister of the Lord Chancellor Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare, was a person of most masculine and enterprising character, which is wittily expressed in the above verses. She is said to have persuaded the grand jury of the County of Cork to build a bridge near Blarney, in a different situation from the old one, in order to form an ornamental object, and, when the bridge was built, she applied to have the course of the river changed and brought under it. But this was too much, and so a handsome bridge now stands in the middle of a field.\n\nBut to return to the McCarthys. This great family, formerly Kings of South Munster, had many branches, who all fell into obscurity in consequence of the forfeitures, except one, that of Carrignavar. The first Viscount Muskery had two brothers, Teige McCarthy of Aglish, and Daniel McCarty of Carrignavar. Teige had a son Dermod, whose descendants are said to have continued till lately, and to have fallen to a very low station, and to have not long ago become extinct ; but this last must be uncertain. Daniel McCarty, the youngest brother of Lord Muskery, built the castle of Carrignavar in 1616, and died about 1658. His last wife, whom he married long after the rebellion of 1641, applied to the Court of Claims in 1662, and was allowed dower of his lands, which shews that he was adjudged an innocent papist. He appears to have been ancestor of the subsequent family of Carrignavar, whose pedigree is printed in Burke's “History of the Commoners:” yet, strange to say, the next possessor of Carrignavar seems to have been his nephew Donagh, first Earl of Clancarthy, for a Daniel's son Cormac, otherwise called Charles, held it by a lease from that Earl for 280 years from 1663, at a nominal rent of 11l. a-year, though, if heir of Daniel, he ought to have been as well entitled to the lands (which were very extensive) as his stepmother to dower of them. Yet, though he made no claim to these, he in 1662 claimed and was allowed other large estates which were expressly devised to himself by the will of his maternal grandfather Stephen Myagh (FitzGarret) of Cork, merchant; all which circumstances, coupled with this, that the Carrignavar estate was not forfeited or regranted, suggest that the Earl may have succeeded to it as heir at law of his uncle Daniel. Nevertheless, in his will in 1665, he makes Charles of Carrignavar the next in remainder to his estates after Dermod of Aglish, calling the latter however his “cousin-german,” and not the former. These apparent inconsistencies have been attempted to be accounted for in several ways, which, considering the commencement of the lease of 1663, are not satisfactory. The above Charles was called Spaniach or Spaniard. The estates being settled on his son's marriage, he forfeited in 1688 only a life-interest. In a late publication on Irish music by Dr. Petrie and Mr. Curry, the ancient clan march of the McCartys is given, with a translation of Irish words adapted to it, called Corromacke Spaniach Carrignavar, and describing the family as “the generous race who never hoarded their wealth.” The above rent of 11l. was forfeited in 1688 by the Earl, and subsequently purchased by the Carrignavar family, who also acquired by marriage with an heiress the estates of the M'Carthys of Cloghrbe. But all their estates were lately sold by the Incumbered Estates Court. They had produced 7000l. a year."
