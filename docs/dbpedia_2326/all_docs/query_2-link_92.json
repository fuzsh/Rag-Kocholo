        "text": "1396.\n\n18 Kal. Dec.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 1.) Ordinance fixing the mode of succession to the office of prior provincial of the Carmelites of the province of England. Their recent petition contained that the province, in order to avoid the unequal sending (promocionem) of its friars to the universities, has been by a late statute divided into four sections (distinctiones) corresponding to the four districts (plagas) of England, west, south, north, and east, and called the Oxford, London, York and Norwich sections respectively, in order that from those sections an equal number of friars may be yearly sent to the universities, and there, according to a certain cycle and sequence of years and of the sections themselves [see below], be admitted to the degree of bachelor and master, from which four sections are chosen, one from each, in every chapter provincial, four diffinitores to decide the causes and business of the province; and that it sometimes happens, as of old before this statute was made, that one district of the province, moved by private affection, has sent (promorit) as far as possible its own friars to take their degree at the universities, so that for thirty or forty years the office of provincial has been kept in one section to the exclusion of the others, as though it would, by title of prescription, endeavour to retain it perpetually; whence dissensions or discords are likely to arise. The pope, in order to do away with this inequality, decrees and ordains that just as it has been hitherto the custom at the universities for a friar to attain the degree of bachelor and doctor in turn from the sections of London, York, Norwich, and Oxford, in that sequence, so in the same way shall the succession to the office of prior provincial take place. Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. Regularis observancie. 1396.\n\n3 Id. Nov.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 4.)

The petition of the abbot and convent states that they exhibited to archbishop Thomas papal letters, letters of the archbishops and of the chapter of York, and other authentic letters and instruments; and adds that such exhibitions and proofs cannot be made without great labours, danger and expense, that on account of their age seals get broken and writings injured (de facili cor[r]umpantur) in their transfer from place to place, and that they doubt whether, notwithstanding archbishop Thomas's letters, they may not be molested and compelled to make exhibition again by the present archbishop and his successors, and by other inferior ordinaries within whose jurisdictions the said churches etc. are situate. The pope not only confirms as above, but grants that in future they shall not be compelled, in questions of such right or title, to make exhibition otherwise than by the said archbishop's letters, to which full belief shall be given as though the original instruments were themselves produced.

To the convent or canons and other ministers of the house of St. Anthony, London, of the order of St. Augustine. Indult to say the canonical hours and celebrate divine offices according to the Use of Sarum until they are able to obtain, which at present they cannot conveniently do, the books necessary to do so according to the rule of their order. Sincere devocionis. 1396.\n\n14 Kal. Dec.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 8.) To the bishop of Dax, the abbot of Eynesham in the diocese of Lincoln, and the dean of London. Mandate to restore to the Benedictine abbot and convent of Abyndon in the diocese of Salisbury, certain burial rights, as below. Their petition contained that they of ancient custom had on the death of parishioners of the parish church, called a chapel, of St. Helen, incorporated to them, and their burial in the cemetery of the monastery church, the right of taking and exacting (percipiendi et lerandi) legacies and bequests (legata et relieta) made to them [on account of burial] thereby, and for each body a candle and a farthing, all (integras) oblations and other emoluments arising out of obits and anniversaries; and that they, upon Henry Brit or Bric, the perpetual vicar, and the parishioners trying to get a place adjoining the parish church dedicated for burials, and to take the said legacies and emoluments, appealed to the apostolic see. That afterwards, when the said vicar and parishioners, under pretext that special licence had been granted by the said see [see Lat. Reg. xii. f. 115d.], got the said place dedicated, the abbot and convent appealed again. That the cause was committed at their instance by the present pope to Master Branda de Castilione, papal chaplain and auditor [see ibid. xxv. f. 158d.], before whom Master John Lance, their proctor, appeared, stating that the new cemetery had, after the said appeals and commission, been dedicated and consecrated, and bodies of the following persons buried therein, namely, William atte Grene, priest; William Mullewarde, William Shakul, Robert Poreman, John Carroway, William Tylare of Bristol, Richard and Julian Symonis, Jota or Joca Johannis, John Kent, Robert son of Walter Sawyare, Peter son of William Shakul, William and John sons of John Couper, brothers, Simon son of John Spane, John son of John Masoun, William son of John Batteshore, John son of Thomas Bakere, Robert son of Thomas Hakeborune, Julian, Henry, and John sons of Simon Harwe, John son of Robert Liford, John son of Thomas Smyth, Denis and William sons of Matthew Couper, John son of Thomas Payntour, William son of John Bouchere, Richard son of David Werkman, John son of Thomas Wolmonger, Richard son of John Cardmakere, Johnson of Richard Proute, laymen; Emma Towneshende and Agnes Stotardi; Cecily daughter of the aforesaid Thomas Hakeburne, Agnes and Alice daughters of the aforesaid Alice Simon Harwe, Margaret daughter of Robert Clerk, daughter of Richard Lambhurde, Margery daughter of Thomas Hamburmakere, Alice daughter of Matthew Fotere, Matilda daughter of John Grym, Spiser, Matilda daughter of Richard Horseman, Elizabeth daughter of John London, Agnes daughter of William Northcote, Cristina daughter of James Grey, Elizabeth daughter of Robert Northcote, Matilda daughter of John Blockley, Matilda daughter of John Shakul, Margery daughter of Thomas Hul, Cristina daughter of John Webbe, Beatrice daughter of Elizabeth Matmaker; Edith wife of Patrick Warkman, Eve wife of David Werkman, Emma wife of Richard atte Water, Alice wife of Richard Rokkynne, Denise wife of John Ponche Boch; Isabella, Alice, and Cristina, hand-maids (ancillarum) of AdamTaylour, John Shakul, and Adam Taylour respectively, parishioners of the said parish; for whom the vicar celebrated masses and other divine offices, despoiling the abbot and convent of their right to the said legacies, etc. That the said proctor prayed for the revocation of such proceedings (attemptata) producing public instruments and other muniments in proof. That thereupon Master John Scrivani, proctor of the vicar and parishioners, took certain exceptions against the above proof before the auditor, who, at the instance of Lance, cited Scrivani by a papal courier (cursor) to hear sentence on a certain day, and on his not appearing pronounced unlawful and annulled the said licence, dedication, consecration, burials and burial dues, made, as above, after the said appeals, ordered the exhumation of the bodies buried, and their re-burial in the cemetery of the monastery church, restoring the abbot and convent to their burial rights and dues, and condemning the vicar to make restitution, and him and the parishioners to pay costs. That the vicar and parishioners’ appeal was committed to the late Andrew, bishop of Llandaff, then papal chaplain and auditor, who, at the instance of Lance cited Scrivani by a papal courier to appear on a certain day to hear sentence, and on his not appearing declared the procedure and pronouncement by Master Branda, as far as regarded the exhumation of the bodies of the above Edith wife of Patrick Wyckman (sic), and of John [son] of Richard Proute, to be bad and the appeal good, but as far as regarded the other points to be good and the appeal bad. That a further appeal from the bishop's sentence of the vicar and parishioners was committed to Master Nicholas de Borrellis, papal chaplain and auditor, who at the instance of Lance cited Scrivani as before to justify the appeal and finally, both being present, confirmed the said sentence, and disallowed the appeal. That afterwards Masters Branda and Nicholas condemned the vicar and parishioners in costs to the amount of 60 and 40 gold florins of the camera respectively in regard to the causes heard by them. The pope therefore orders the above-named three executors to publish the said sentences and to restore the abbot and convent to the state in which they were before the said attempts, to cause the bodies to be exhumed, except the two named, and to be re-buried as above, and satisfaction to be made to the abbot and convent in respect of the said candles, legacies, and other emoluments, and the costs. Exhibita nobis. [6¾ pp.] 14 Kal. Dec.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 11.) To the bishop of Dax, and the abbots of Eynesham and Westminster. Mandate to execute sentence, as below, in favour of the above-named abbot and convent of Abingdon. The petition of the abbot and convent contained the circumstances related above and their two appeals. That the pope committed the cause to the late Andrew bishop of Llandaff, then chaplain and auditor, before whom appeared Master William Gutman, as substitute for Master John Lance, their proctor, who set forth that the vicar, after the appeals, had buried John son of Richard Proute and Edith wife of Patrick Werkman, in the new cemetery which he had caused to be dedicated and consecrated, and prayed for the revocation of the vicar's proceedings, producing public instruments, etc. in proof. That thereupon Master John Scrivani, the vicar's proctor, was cited to oppose such proof and did not appear. That he was then cited to hear sentence, and upon his not appearing the bishop gave sentence for the exhumation of the said two bodies and their re-burial in the precincts of the monastery church, and condemned the vicar to make restitution in respect of candles, etc. and to pay costs. That afterwards the bishop cited John, at William's instance, to be present at the taxation of the costs, and on his not appearing, taxed them at 40 florins. The pope hereby ratifies the bishop's proceedings, orders the above three executors to publish the sentence, restoring the abbot and convent to their former position, and causing the two bodies to be exhumed and re-buried as above, and satisfaction to be made to the abbot and convent in respect of the said candles, etc. and costs. Exhibita nobis. [3 pp.] 3 Id. Dec.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 15d.) Ratification of what has been done in virtue of the reconciliation indult granted by Urban V. to the prior of Worcester, with extension thereof. Clement VI. granted to the late John de Evesham, prior of Worcester, an indult, by which the prior, or in the event of his death or absence the sub-prior, was enabled, in the absence of the diocesan, to reconcile his church and cemetery when necessary, the water being blessed by a bishop. [Reg. Vat. cci. f. 55d.] On the translation of bishop John to York, it was on the part of bishop Reginald untruly suggested to Innocent VI. that this indult tended to the injury of the bishop, whereupon that pope decreed that it could be exercised only during the voidance of the see or the absence of the bishop from the realm [ibid. ccxxxi. f. 175d]. Afterwards Urban V. granted the prior, and during his death or absence the sub-prior, the privilege of reconciling churches of the city and diocese subject to them, even those subject in temporals only, and their cemeteries [ibid. ccliv. f. 39]. At the petition of John Malverne, the present prior, the pope ratifies all that has been done by him and by priors and sub-priors concerning the reconciliation of the church of Worcester and its cemetery by virtue of the indult of Urban V., and grants that the prior for the time being, or in his absence or death the sub-prior, alike during the voidance of the see and the absence of the bishop, may reconcile as well the church of Worcester as other churches subject, whether in spirituals or in temporals, to the prior, the sub-prior, or the said church, or otherwise impropriated to them, or of which the prior, the subprior, or the chapter have the patronage, together with cemeteries thereof, the water being first blessed as above.

Indult to the abbot and his successors and convent to sell and alienate serfs (servos) and born bondmen (nativos) of the monastery who have not acknowledged their serfdom (servitutem) or have without leave taken themselves off from the demesne of the monastery to other places beyond its liberty and district. Sincere devocionis. (De mandato.) Ibid.\n\n(f. 25d. To the bishop of Durham, the abbot of Selby, and the precentor of York.

Exemplification is given of the public instrument dated, according to the computation of the English church, in the year 1395 [6], March 24, indiction 4, the 7th year of the present pope, in the choir of St. Olave's, in the presence of the notary public and witnesses named below, and containing (i) the proctorial power conferred by abbot Thomas and the convent on John de Kirkeby, Thomas de Thorp, monks of the monastery, and Master Nicholas de Esyngwald, dated at the monastery 1 November, 1389; (ii) the sentence as above, of Master John de Botlesham, licentiate in canon law, canon of Lincoln, chancellor and judge of Thomas archbishop of York, primate of England and legate of the apostolic see, delivered in presence of the said Master Nicholas, and of the said parishioners, omitting the third, fourth and fifth and last names, and adding those of Thomas Nayler and John Bolton.

To Simon, bishop of Trieste (Tergestin.), master of the schools of the sacred palace in the faculty of theology, or his successor or locum tenens in that office. Mandate to confer on Dominic de Fighino, a Friar Preacher, who has studied in the theological faculty in the university of Oxford and others, was afterwards deputed to lecture on the Sentences, and has now become worthy of the mastership in theology, if found fit after examination by him and four other masters in theology, the mastership of theology and the licence to teach in the same. Viri sacre lectionis. 4 Id. May.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 61d.) To Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury and John, bishop of Hereford. Mandate at the recent petition, as below, of Henry bishop of Norwich, to take up, within six months after receipt of these presents, the compromise between him and the prior and chapter in the state in which it remained when before [the late] William, archbishop of Canterbury, and to carry on the arbitration, enforcing their decision by pains and ecclesiastical censures. It was lately set forth to the pope on behalf of the said two parties that a cause arose lately between them touching the bishop's claim to correct and punish excesses of officers and monks of the said church, and to appoint and remove the cellarer, sacristan and certain other officers therein, as also the priors of the priories or cells of Lenum (Lynn), Jememut (Yarmouth), Aldeby and Hoxne, in the diocese, dependent thereon, and touching his suspension, in the episcopal consistory, of the proctor of the prior and chapter, who appealed to the pope, and other matters. That the several causes, although not lawfully devolved by their nature to the Roman court, were committed by the present pope to Master Paul de Dugmano, papal chaplain and auditor. That because they could be better heard on their merits in those parts than in the Roman court, the pope, calling them up to himself, ordered the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of Hereford, without mention of their names, to bring about a composition and concord if the parties would consent, and if they would not, to hear the causes and then to transmit them, duly drawn up, within two years to the apostolic see, as also the parties themselves to hear sentence. Afterwards, as bishop Henry's recent petition contained, the pope's letters, having been presented to bishop John and archbishop William, came to the notice of king Richard, who intervened to make peace, ordering bishop Henry and the prior to appear before archbishop William and the royal council, when a compromise was begun by the arbitration of the archbishop, deputed by the king. The petition adds that before his decision was delivered the archbishop died, and that disputes have begun again. Dudum siquidem pro parte. Id. March.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 62d.)

Exemplification is given of the cardinal's letters or public instrument dated in his lodging (in hospicio habitacionis nostre), at Rome at St. Mary's of the Armenians, near St. Peter's, 1379, indiction 2, 25 August, anno 2 Urban VI.; witnessed by friar William, bishop of Achonry (Achaden.) and the cardinal's auditor, his secretary and his esquire (scutifero), each being named, and attested and drawn up by his scribe Peter de Bocshusen, clerk, of the diocese of Liège, public notary. The letters were addressed to the archbishops of Canterbury, York, Armagh, Dublin and Cashel, the bishops of London, Winchester, Norwich, Hereford, Rochester, Durham and Carlisle, the master-general, Thomas de Bosclasco, prior-provincial of the province of Upper Lombardy and vicar-general, the chapter-general and its diffinitores, and all other priors, lectors and friars of the order. They relate that the cause was committed by Urban VI. to the said cardinal, before whom appeared friar Robert Bysschop, as proctor substitute for Richard de Sudbury, proctor of the said Thomas, the English provincial and the order in England, and John de Empsay, proctor-general for the order, appointed by the above Thomas de Bosclasco, vicar-general, and who, after the usual formalities of citation, etc. gave sentence declaring Thomas Russock (sic) to have been and to be provincial of the English province, and all his acts canonical; his removal from that office by Elias, some time master-general, and that of John Leycestrie from his office in Ireland, and those of masters in theology and other friars from the aforesaid offices, convents, etc. to have been and to be null and unlawful, the persons so removed to be restored; and friars William Syward, John Empsay, and John Parisch, placed and intruded as vicars by Elias in the said province of England, and Robert Cusak or any other placed as vicar by Elias in the place of John Leycestrie, to be removed, and all other acts done by Elias in the English province after and against the said appeal annulled; the appeal by the said prior provincial Thomas and the order in England to have been good and lawful; and the sentences of deprivation made by Elias or the said chapter-general, together with the successive appointments by it as vicar-general in the said province of England of John Parys (sic) S.T.M., John Empsay, S.T.M., and Thomas Northebe to be annulled, as likewise whatever was done against friar William Bodechsham, S.T.M. The constitution made in the chapter-general held at London in 1314 which begins Ad perpetuam rei memoriam (sic) was approved and confirmed, and Elias and the said chapter-general and John Empsay, their proctor, were condemned in costs. Whereupon pope Urban gave verbal commission to cardinal Nicholas, who in pursuance thereof orders the above archbishops, bishops, etc. to restore, under penalties in case of disobedience, Thomas Russchok and the others to their respective offices, and to remove the intruders, within six days after the notification of his letters.

Mandate to inform themselves, and if they find, as has been reported recently to the pope, that William, master-general of the order of Sempringham, when on visitation takes immoderate procurations from houses, priories and other places, burdens them by the excessive number of members of his household and horses whom he leads with him, and commits many grievances and enormities against the statutes of the order, to punish him; to visit the said houses, etc. and correct and reform what is amiss. Faculty is given to revise (innovandi et declarandi) the statutes of the order and to frame others if expedient. Ad ecclesiarum. 16 Kal. July.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 116.) Confirmation of the appropriation by Henry, bishop of Worcester, with consent of the prior and chapter thereof, to the Benedictine abbot and convent of Pershore, of the church of Ekynton of their patronage, value not exceeding 30 marks, that of the monastery not exceeding 1000. Exemplification is given of (i) the bishop's letters—Peticio vestra, dated in his manor of Alvchurche, 28 December 1394, the 20th year of his consecration, stating that being situate on the public street the abbey and convent have to keep continual hospitality, that through the barrenness of their lands and the diminution by half of their services and rents on account of the death of their tenants and serfs in the pestilences, they are unequal to the sustentation and restoration of their buildings, mostly collapsed or collapsing through wind and age, that they are burdened by the corrodies and pensions created by their predecessors, and are weighed down by daily increasing debt. The value of Ekynton is therein stated not to exceed 10 marks besides their portion of the great tithes, and the king to be their founder and patron, whose licence has been given. A compensation of 3s. 4d. is to be paid yearly at Michaelmas to the bishop in his cathedral.

Confirmation of the appropriation made to them by John, sometime bishop of Lincoln, under mandate of Gregory XI. of the church of Kynebalton in the following circumstances. It having been set forth to Gregory XI. that bishop John had appropriated to them the said church, of the patronage of the earl of Hereford, which patronage the earl had given to them; that on account of Urban V.'s revocation [see Cal. Lett. iv, 180] of appropriations which had not taken effect, the appropriation did not hold good; and that the value of the priory not exceeding 20l. was insufficient, he ordered bishop John to appropriate the said church, value not exceeding 40 marks, a portion for a perpetual vicar being reserved. The bishop made the appropriation, and successively instituted the late Adam de Dornewelle, the late Richard Deneys and William Brampton the present vicar, all canons of the priory. Their present petition adds that before the incorporation the church was accustomed to be served by secular clerks, and that if such were [again] instituted inconvenience might arise. The pope therefore makes the further grant that the said vicarage, value not exceeding 10l., may be served by one of the canons. Sacre religionis. 4 Kal. April.\n\nSt. Peter's, Rome.\n\n(f. 127d.)

Confirmation of certain statutes and ordinances made on the late petition of the Carmelites of the English province by Landulph, cardinal deacon of St. Nicholas's in Carcere, and protector of the order.

Exemplification is given of the cardinal's letters—Nupercoram prefato, dated at Rome at St. James de Suttingnan, in his lodging, 1396, indiction 4, 5 May, the 7th year of pope Boniface, and addressed to the Carmelites of the English province. They state that the pope—being petitioned to order that no Carmelite of the province should take the said degree unless he should first lecture on philosophy for a year, and afterwards continuously for seven years, unless dispensed by the prior provincial and the diffinitores of the chapter provincial, work (insudaret) as a scholar at theology in an university or universities, making the due acts in the same faculty, then lecture on the Sentences, subsequently become a completed (formatus) bachelor in an university approved, being finally promoted by his provincial and his distinctio [see above f. 1] to the said degree—gave the cardinal verbal commission, on the day on which his letters are dated (above), to issue mandate to the Carmelites of the English province to preserve, in regard to the aforesaid, the order which has hitherto been observed in the Roman court. The cardinal having informed himself, orders that in future, for taking the said degree, the manner and form of the said court are to be observed by the Carmelites of England, namely, that a candidate (1) be a a scholar in arts for seven years, (2) become scholar of theology for seven years, (3) lecture on the Sentences for a year in an approved university (in universitate approbata in studio generali), and become principal lecturer, (4) for two years the Sentences in an approved university, two books in the first year, and in the second the other (alios) two books; (5) in the year next after lecturing on the Sentences lecture on the Bible; (6 and last) respond to the doctors according to the wonted manner, and afterwards proceed to the degree of master as is customary. English friars of the said order and province who have presumed to assume the degree of master outside the province are hereby ipso facto deprived of every rank and degree of the said order.

Urban VI. on the petition of the prior and chapter of Durham, ordered the bishop of Durham [by letters dated at Genoa, 8 Id. Nov. an. 8, i.e. 1387, in Wilkins, Concilia II. 617] to appropriate the said churches to the college, stating, in accordance with the said petition, that its foundation was begun [in 1337, see ibid. p. 613-617] by Thomas [de Hatfield] sometime bishop of Durham, for sixteen students of theology and arts, eight of whom were to be monks of Durham, and eight secular clerks, all to be chosen by the prior and chapter; that bishop Thomas died before fulfilling his purpose; and that king Richard proposed to assign to the college, for its endowment, his patronage of the said churches. The recent petition of the prior and chapter stated that the appropriation has been made, and that they have deputed one of the said eight monks to be prior, whom the said archbishop and bishop constrain to attend in person, as above, and who cannot do so, by reason of the distance from York and Lincoln, without heavy labour and expense.
