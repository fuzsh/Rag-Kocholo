        "text": "The Reverend Marshall B. Smith, AM, was called to take charge of the parish as rector on August 20, 1860. He was an alumnus of the Theological Seminary of the Diocese of Virginia and rector of Christ Church, Dover, Delaware. Since his salary was to be not less than $500 per year and Saint John’s could not pay a full salary, it was subsidized by a grant of $300 per year, for two years, from the Protestant Episcopal Missionary Society of New Jersey. This allowed most of the money raised within the parish to be designated for the building of a church edifice as soon as possible.\n\nIt was during Mr. Smith’s rectorate that the first church building was erected in 1861-62. It was this new church that was the scene of a break-in in April 1863. Among other things the rector’s vestment (“a silk gown”) was stolen and was replaced by the congregation.\n\nIt was said that Mr. Smith “was highly educated and polished and very popular with his parishioners, some being the richest persons in the village – the kind that attend church in a coach. The rector was married to a daughter of his richest, most exclusive member, and was popular with men in the village outside his parish, and was a school trustee.”\n\nMr. Smith presented his resignation as rector of Saint John’s on March 31, 1868. His popularity in and out of church remained unchallenged despite the fact that he withdrew with 200 priests of the church to organize an entirely new denomination, the Reformed Episcopal Church, still in existence today.\n\nThe vestry passed a resolution affirming Mr. Smith’s views denying the dogma that “…there is no Church without a Bishop,” and that all protestant churches are only branches of the same Catholic Church, under different forms of organization. The resolution went on to say that any future rector must subscribe to these views. This resolution was passed mainly because St. John’s had received $600 from the Low Church Protestant Episcopal Missionary Society of New Jersey and a certain amount of allegiance was owed to their point of view.\n\nThe controversy within the church arose when the clergy objected to the use of the sign of the cross in baptism and opposed the church teaching regarding baptismal regeneration.\n\nIn May 1877 a call was extended to the Reverend A. Sidney Dealey of Round Lake, New York at $1,000 per annum.\n\nMr. Dealey wrote the following in the Parish Register upon his arrival at Saint John’s: July 9, 1877. On entering my Rectorship of the Parish of St. John’s, Passaic, I desire to state distinctly that I do not endorse the above inserted paper. [refers to vestry resolution passed following the Rev’d Marshall B. Smith’s resignation] I object to it, first, on the grounds of the unscriptural spirit of party of which it seems to be the expression; and, secondly, because as a Presbyter of the Church I am bound by the vows which she required of me at my ordination; and I recognise no right whatever in any Vestry to impose special and additional obligations or Articles of Faith and Practice beside those which the general body of the Church in this Country rightly imposes on her clergy. (signed) A. Sidney Dealey\n\nThe parish at this time seemed to be going through a very difficult period due to finances. There may have been other conflicts, since the records indicate that the rector at the annual meeting of 1878 called for parishioners to “[lay] aside all party lines and prejudices and unite for the welfare of the church.” On October 18, 1879, A. Sidney Dealey resigned as rector of Saint John’s to take the rectorship of Christ Church, Buffalo, New York.\n\nOn May 30, 1882 a call was extended to the Rev’d George H. Yarnall of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at $1500 per annum and this call was accepted. Through hard work he quickly eliminated the debt of the parish and began planning for the construction of a new church building since the former was no longer adequate for the needs of the parish. During his rectorate the vestry was increased to 12 members (two wardens and 10 vestrymen). Also a weekly celebration of the Holy Communion became the rule of the parish on the First Sunday after Trinity, 1892.\n\nHis letter of resignation is as follows:\n\nSt. John’s Rectory\n\nPassaic, N.J.\n\nTo the Wardens & Vestrymen of St. John’s Parish\n\nGentlemen—\n\nI herewith tender my resignation as Rector of St. John’s Parish to take effect at once. My health has broken completely & my Doctor says I must have a long rest. It is a great grief to me to give up a work that I loved so dearly. No man ever had a more faithful & devoted Vestry. May GOD’s fullest blessing rest upon your work, which I know He will bring to perfection. Brethren pray for me that I may fully recover.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeo. H. Yarnall\n\nDec. 8th, 1893\n\nThe Rector’s resignation letter was reprinted in the Passaic Daily News of December 9, 1893 along with an explanation of his illness. The article said in part: “Mr. Yarnall’s resignation was, with much regret, accepted bythe Vestry. Bishop Starkey has arranged for the Rev. Mr. Melvin Honeyman of Newark, to conduct the services in St. John’s Church to-morrow. The 8 o’clock morning service will be omitted. The other services will be held as usual. Mr. Yarnall’s breakdown will be a sudden blow to the members of his parish. Very few of them knew that his health had been affected at all and it was a complete surprise to all but two of the vestrymen when the resignation was read last night. Dr. Edwin DeBaun says that his patient has collapsed completely and it is utterly impossible for him to continue in the parish. He thinks it one of the severest cases of nervous prostration he has ever met with and thinks that it will take a year’s rest to restore Mr. Yarnall to health. Under these circumstances there was nothing for him to do but to resign. He has been slaving ever since he came to the parish, and to leave just as the new church is being built is a great disappointment, but he felt that unless he made way for a new rector, everything would be at a standstill till he was able to get back to work.” It appears that for a time he was allowed to remain at the rectory and the parish had supply clergy to perform the services.\n\nAn article from the Passaic Daily News on May 2, 1908 described the new rector as follows:\n\n“The Rev. W. Gordon Bentley, who has accepted the call to the rectorship of St. John’s parish, in this city, will commence his new duties on June 1.\n\nHe is a man of middle age, and married. He is a native of Jefferson County, New York, and he was educated at the Adams Collegiate Institute, Adams, New York. From 1882 to 1889 he taught natural science in the Adams Collegiate Institute. In 1889 he began studying for holy orders under the late Bishop Huntington of Central New York. He went to St. Andrew’s Divinity School, Syracuse, and was ordered deacon on May 28, 1890. He was at St. Mark’s Church, Syracuse, until October 1, 1890 when he was appointed minister-in-charge of St. Paul’s, Constableville, and St. Mark’s, Port Leyden. He was ordained priest May 15, 1891, and made rector of the above churches. Later he was in charge of the churches at Greig, Waverly and Smithboro, N.Y. In 1898 he was called to St. Stephen’s, New Hartford, his present charge. His entire ministry has been in the Diocese of Central New York. Mr. Bentley is a churchman of the Catholic School, and by many he is called Father Bentley. He sings the service with dignity and beauty and is a good preacher.”\n\nThe highlight of Father Bentley’s ministry at Saint John’s must have been on April 23, 1914 when the new church was consecrated, the mortgage having been paid by a legacy from Peter Reid.\n\nFather Bentley resigned in 1925 due to poor health. His letter of resignation is as follows:\n\nTo the Wardens and Vestrymen of Saint John’s Church at Passaic, N.J.\n\nGentlemen: -\n\nI feel it my duty to give you this early and timely notice that if I live until November of this year, I shall reach the age which the Church has set for the retirement of the Clergy from active service and participation in the Clergy Pension Fund. Since that Fund came into operation it has been my purpose to avail myself of its provisions. The conditions and circumstances of the last few weeks show that such action is not only desirable but imperative. I therefore present, and ask you to accept, my resignation of the Rectorship of this Parish, such resignation to take effect on October 31st, A.D., 1925. This action is taken after consultation with Bishop Lines and has his consent and approval.\n\nIt is impossible to adequately express the various feelings and emotions aroused by this action which will sever our official relations of more than seventeen years standing. Let me assure you of my sincere and cordial appreciation of the many courtesies and kindnesses which you have extended to me. I shall be interested in the future Spiritual and temporal welfare of St. John’s Church, and shall pray for GOD’s richest blessings on him whom you shall elect as my successor, and on you his fellow workers and supporters.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nW. Gordon Bentley, Rector.\n\nSigned and dated at Passaic, N.J.\n\nApril 6th, A.D.,1925.\n\nFather Bentley retired from active ministry October 31, 1925.\n\nAlbert J. M. Wilson was born in Belfast, Ulster, Northern Ireland in 1888. He attended the Mountpottinger School in Belfast and came to the U.S. in 1912. He was a graduate of Saint Stephen’s Anglican College, at Annandale-on-the-Hudson, and took his master’s degree in arts at Columbia in the Class of 1917, taking his degree in theology at the General Theological Seminary at the same time. After leaving the seminary he served for a year and a-half at Saint Matthew’s Church, 84th Street & Central Park West, where he was made deacon. After his ordination as priest, he was rector of Grace Church, Millbrook, New York for over four years before he was called to Saint Bartholomew’s, NYC, during the rectorship of the Rev’d Dr. S. Leighton Parkes, where he served as curate for three years.\n\nMr. Wilson came to Saint John’s in February 1926. With his coming, the “high church” regime was abandoned. In a sad period for Saint John’s, he stopped the use of mass vestments and other catholic practices. He instructed Saint Faith’s Altar Guild to store all the vestments that they had made beginning in the 1870s. These and other liturgical items were eventually given to other parishes for their use.\n\nA newspaper account of his first “service” at Saint John’s stressed all the changes that were taking place:\n\n“Candles glowed upon the reredos above the High Altar at the eucharists yesterday morning as during the previous high church regime but that was the only remaining sign of the thought and practice which has prevailed… Mr. Wilson discarded all eucharistic vestments (amice, alb, crossed stole, maniple, cincture and chasuble) … He abandoned the traditional preparation before the altar… All genuflections and other forms of reverencing toward the altar were given up, as was also the frequent use of the sign of the cross…”\n\nIn the prosperous days of the 1920s the church initiated a drive for $100,000 to build a new rectory (its third) and to make extensive improvements to the church and parish house, “to provide much needed room for rapidly developing activities.”\n\nThis was in June 1926. Despite the fact that the drive fell $20,000 short of its goal, negotiations started for the sale of the rectory at 217 Paulison Avenue. The new rectory (opposite the church across Lafayette Avenue) was built, but the Depression prevented the fulfillment of other plans.\n\nMr. Wilson resigned May 31, 1930 to become the rector of Saint George’s, Rumson, New Jersey.\n\nBorn on July 6, 1932 in Orange, New Jersey, Father Partridge was rector of St. John’s Church from 1981-1984. He received his BA from the University of Pittsburgh in 1959 and his M Div in 1962 from The General Theological Seminary. An LHD was awarded to him in 1973 by the London Institute. Bishop Leland F. Stark ordained him to the diaconate in June 1962 and to the priesthood in December 1962. Edmund Partridge married Carolyn Elizabeth Ehni on June 29, 1957.\n\nAmong Father Partridge’s many assignments within the Church, he served as rector of St. James in Wichita, Kansas from 1968-1971. From then on he specialized in interim ministries which he developed into a “professional art form” especially in working with distressed congregations. It was in this capacity that he came to Saint John’s. First as an priest-in-charge for one year, which assignment was extended another two years as rector. During his time here he worked diligently to rebuild our community into a viable parish.\n\nFrom 1990-1992 he was Dean of Trinity and St. Philip’s Cathedral, Newark, New Jersey and was later awarded the title of Honorary Canon. Canon Partridge retired in 2000 from Grace Church, Rutherford, New Jersey where he served as rector for five years. He is the author of The New Spirituality for Laymen, and The Church in Perspective as well as the editor of The Guide for Lay Readers."
