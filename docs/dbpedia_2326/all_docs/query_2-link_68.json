RIVINGTON, LONDON ; AND JOHN HENRY PARKER, OXFORD. MDCCCL. DUBLIN : PRINTED AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS, BV M. H. GILL. PRELIMINARY REMARKS. Sir James Ware's History of the Bishops of Ireland, as enlarged by Walter Harris, and published in 1739, is a folio volume, consisting of 660 pages. Of these no more than sixty, exactly one-eleventh part (instead of one-fourth), are devoted to the province of Tuam; so little of ecclesiastical information could be obtained, even at that time, concerning this remote and often distracted province. The lapse of upwards of a century has still further diminished the stock of materials which existed in Harris's day; so that I shall hope to stand excused with all reasonable men, if this portion of my work exhibits a still more meagre appearance than the others. In truth, the lists of succession in almost every diocese are defective ; and the information which could be gleaned respecting individuals was very scanty. It must also be taken into consideration, that some of the Chapters of Tuam province have but few members. Indeed, several of these dioceses are ex- tremely limited in the number of benefices and of clergy. Thus, for instance, Clonfert contains only iv PRELIMINARY REMARKS. eleven benefices ; Killala has thirteen benefices (in- cluding the deanery), consisting of twenty-seven pa- rishes ; and out of these twenty-seven, there are only three in which the incumbent receives the rectorial as well as vicarial tithes. In Achonry diocese, the benefices (includiug the deanery) are only nine ; the parishes are twenty-five. Ixi only three of them are the rectorial tithes received by the incumbent. In all the other instances they are at present in the hands of laymen. The whole diocese of Kilmacduagh contains but four benefices (including the deanery). These are composed of twenty-three parishes. There is only one Rector, who receives the entire tithes of his pa- rishes, two in number. The Capitular bodies of this province are not uni- form in their constitution. Several of them have lost certain members which manifestly belonged to them two or more centuries ago ; but none present the defective appearance of some of those in Ulster, as Kilmore, Ardagh, or Clonmacnois. The bishopric of Tuam now includes the minor sees of Mayo and Enachdune. Its Chapt er con- sists at present of a Dean, Provost, Archdeacon, and eight Prebendaries. There is evidence that in an- cient times it possessed a Chancellor and a Trea- surer. In the sixteenth century the number of its Vicars Choral was jive. These have been gradu- ally withdrawn ; at the present time there is only one. From the year 1661 to 1741, the see of Kil- PRELIMINARY REMARKS. fenora, in the province of Munster, was annexed to Tuam ; and from 1741 to 1839 (Kilfenora having been disunited), that of Ardagh, in the province of Ulster, was joined to it. The Church Temporalities Act of 1834 restored Ardagh to the see of Kilmore, and united Killala and Achonry to the diocese of Tuam. The ancient see of Killala, in the county of Mayo, preserved its distinct and independent posi- tion from the days of St. Patrick till the year 1834, when the ill-omened Church Temporalities Act an- nexed it to Tuam, as above mentioned. Its Chapter formerly comprised a Dean, Archdeacon, Provost, and two Prebendaries. In the seventeenth century several other prebendal churches were added to it. At present the prebends are five in number. The Provost is now styled Prsecentor. The diocese of AcHONRY, which I have said contains very few be- nefices, was united to Killala in the year 1623, and the union has continued to this day. Its Chapter formerly comprised a Dean, Provost, Archdeacon, 'dn& Jive Prebendaries. In the seventeenth century several other churches of the diocese were styled prebendal. At the present day the Prebendaries are three. The diocese of Elphin contains within it several smaller sees, which appear to have been separate and independent at various periods between the sixth and thirteenth centuries, as Ardcarne, Drum- cliffe, Boscommon, &c., of which some slight account vi ✓1 PRELIMINARY REMARKS. will be found at p. 130, seq. In the year 1841 it became united to Kilmore and Ardagh, in the pro- vince of Ulster, under the strange carving operations of the Church Temporalities Act. The Chapter of Elphin has been altered from its original constitution. Anciently it contained twelve Prebendaries, of which only eight now remain. Its Provost has been changed to a Praecentor. The diocese of Clonfert received the annexation of Kilmacduagh in the year 1601; and in 1834 both of them became united to Killaloe, a bishopric in a different province, under the before-named Act. Clonfert is the only diocese in Ireland, which has preserved that ancient ecclesiastical officer, a Sacm^. The other members of its Chapter are, a Dean, Arch- deacon, and eight Prebendaries. The small diocese of Kilmacduagh, situate in the south-western part of the county of Galway, was united to Clonfert in 1601, and with it has been handed over to Killaloe, as stated above. Its Chap- ter has varied in its component parts from time to time. At one period it had six Prebendaries; after- wards jive ; at present there are only two. The contents of the Diocesan Registries are in ge- neral very scanty, almost all the most ancient records having been lost. Those oiTuam, which remain, are preserved in the vestry room of the Cathedral ; but all the others are kept in private dwelling-houses ; and of course are continually subject to all the ca- sualties to which such buildings are liable. PRELIMINARY REMARKS. At Tuam, the oldest Book of Titles commences at the year 1662; the oldest Roll of Oaths at 1752; the oldest Visitation Book, 1 7 — . Among the papers there are some relating to the diocose of Kilfenora, between the years 1661 and 1741, during which pe- riod the latter see continued annexed to Tuam ; and others relating to the diocese of Ardagh, between 1741 and 1839. There are likewise some few Visi- tation Books of the Province, viz. of Elphin, 1787, &c.; of Clonfert, 1742, 1787, &c.; of Kilmacduagh, 1811, &c.; of Killala and Achonry, 1793, &c. At Killala, the oldest Title Book is of the year 1695; the oldest Roll, 1727; oldest Visitation Book, 1708. The records of Achonry are kept in the Kil- lala books. At Elphin, the oldest Title Book is of 1661; Roll of Oaths, 1720; Visitation Book, 1722. The Chap- ter Book of Elphin commences in 1723. At Clonfert, the oldest Book of Titles is of 1693; Roll of Oaths, 1735; Visitation Book, 1722. The Registrar of this diocese, Peter White, on his ap- pointment to his office in the year 1717, expressed his horror at the nakedness of the repository, in a quaint memorandum, stating that he \" found in the Registry no Records, nor anything else!\" In preparing this portion of my work, as well as the former ones, I have been favoured by the warm coun- tenance of the Bishops of the Province, and the ready and efficient aid of their Registrars. I beg to express my best thanks on this account to the Lord Bishops of Tuam, of Elphin, and of Killaloe and Clonfert ; Vlll PRELIMINARY REMARKS. also to the Rev. J. Clarke, of Tuam ; the Rev. Ed- ward Hartigan, of Clonfert; Frederick Stock, Esq. of Killala ; and E. B. Kennej, Esq. of Elphin. I am likewise indebted to the Deans of Killala, Elphin, and Kilmacduagh, and to the Rev. C. H. G. Butson, of Clonfert, for much kind assistance and informa- tion; to the Rev. William Reeves, for the ancient Papal Taxations of the province ; and to M. W. Sa- vage, Esq. Clerk of the Privy Council, Dublin, lor permission to extract from the original Council Books the suspensions of appointments to Cathedral Dignities or Prebends, which have taken place under the Church Temporalities Acts. Having now, under Divine favour, brought this compilation to a close, I have to admit its numerous deficiencies and other imperfections; some of which, perhaps, might have been avoided by more minute and protracted inquiries. But I trust that, even in its present state, it may occasionally supply my bre- thren and others with useful information, not easily to be obtained elsewhere, and which appeared to me to be in yearly danger of becoming almost wholly lost to the Public. May the Church of Ireland approve the design, and overlook its inadequate execution, and be willing to accept the unworthy oflfering from one of her adopted sons and most devoted servants, H. C. Thurles, March 30ih, I80O. FASTI ECCLESIiE HIBERNIC^. DIOCESE OF TUAM. The see of Tuam is said to have been founded about the beginning of the sixth century. Its prelates are some- times called by the Irish Annalists \" Bishops, or Arch- bishops, of Connaught.\" The present diocese of Tuam comprises two other bishoprics, which were annexed to Tuam at different periods ; namely, that of INIayo, which became united to it in the year 1559 ; and Enachdune, which, after a long series of disputes between the re- spective prelates, was finally annexed to Tuam, about the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The Bishops of each see will be found below, so far as the present imperfect materials can furnish them. ARMS OF THE SEE. In Harris's edition of Ware is an engraving of the seal of Archbishop Felix O'Ruadan, dated 1202; inscribed sig. F^L. o RUADAN. ARCHiEP. TUAM, with a standinof figure of a Bishop in his robes, giving the benediction. And also of another, inscribed sigillum archiep. tuam, 1739, which bears an entirely different coat of arms.

St. Jarlath, a man of great learning, and exemplary purity of life, is said to have founded a monastery at a place called Cluain-fois, near Tuam, about the beginning of the sixth century. To this mo- nastery he attached a school, in which, among other eminent scholars, St. Brendan, afterwards Abbat of Clonfert, and St. Colman, the first Bishop of Cloyne, were educated under his inspection. Soon afterwards he erected a cathedral church in Tuam, and became its first Bishop. He lived to a great age. The time of his death is not exactly known, but is believed to be about the year 540. Ware has stated that certain \" Prophecies,\" which are still extant, have been attributed to Jarlath; but he is of opinion that they are the production of some one of his successors at a far more recent period. The list of St. Jarlath's successors for some centuries is sadly imperfect. 781. Ferdomnach was Bishop. He died in this year. 969. Eugene M'Clerigh, called \" Bishop of Connaught,\" died. 1033. MuRCHAD O'Nioc died. 1085. Aedh O'Hoisin (now called O'Hessian), who is styled \" Bishop of Connaught\", died. 1086. Erchad O'Mael Omair died. 1091, or 1092. CorxMac O'Cairil (O'Carrol?) died. 1117, or 1118. Cathasach O'Conail died. 1128. MuRCHAD O'Nioc (see above) died, on the island called Inis an Ghoill. [O'Flaherty.] BISHOPS. 5 1136. Donald O'Dubhai, whom the Annalists style *' Archbishop of Connaught,\" died on March 17th, at Clonfert, and was there buried. Harris notes the curious circumstance, that three Bishops bearing the same names, namely, of Tuam, El- phin, and Clonmacnois, should have died in the same year ; or else, that the same prelate should have ruled over those three distant dioceses. 1150. Maurice or Muredach O'Dubhai died, aged 75. He was a person of so eminent wisdom and liberality, that one of the old annalists has proclaimed that \"when he died, Ireland died with him.\" He was buried in the Abbey of Cong. ARCHBISHOPS. 1150. Edan O'Hoisin, O'Ossin, or Ua Deisin, succeeded. He received the pall of an Archbishop from Cardinal Paparo, the Pope's Legate, at the Synod of Kells, in 1152. He is greatly celebrated for piety, liberality, and learning. He died in 1161, and was buried in his ca- thedral, where formerly an epitaph in Irish to his me- mory might be seen. 1161. Catholicus or Cadhla O'Dubhai succeeded. He appears to have been a person of great talent ; and was employed in much important business, of Church and State, both in England and at Rome. Having presided over this see during the long period of forty years, he died at a very advanced age, in 1201, in the Abbey of Cong. 1201. Felix O'Ruadan, a Cistercian Monk, uncle of Ro- deric O'Conor, King of Ireland, succeeded. In 1235 he resigned his charge, and retired to St. Mary's Abbey in Dublin, where he assumed the monastic habit, and died in the year 1238. His episcopal seal is engraved in Harris's Ware. 6 TUAM. 1235. Marianus or Mael-ISIurry O'Laghnan, Dean of Tuam, liaving been elected by the Chapter, was accepted by the Pope, and afterwards received confirmation from the Kinof. The Four Masters seem to intimate that he was consecrated in England. He is said to have been an eminent canonist. He died at the town of Athlone, about Christmas, in the year 1249. 1250. Florence INI'Flynn, or Floin, by others called Fi- acha O'Flyn, Chancellor of Tuam, having been elected by the Chapter, was confirmed by the King, and subse- quently by the Pope, '* on account of his great learning and wisdom.\" [Four Masters.] He was consecrated at Tuam, on Christmas Day. During a vacancy of the see of Enachdune, Florence took possession both of its spiritualities and temporalities, and retained them during his life. In the year 1255 he went over to England, to confer with the King upon that and other Church mat- ters; and appears to have succeeded in his objects; as the Four Masters tell us, that \" all the favours which he asked were honourably granted to him by the King.\" He died at Bristol on his return to Ireland, in 1256, leavinor behind him a his^h character for learning and knowledge of the laws. [1256. James O'Laghnan was unanimously elected by the Chapter, and received the King's confirmation, in a pa- tent dated October 16th. Yet he never was able to ob- tain possession of his see, because the Pope had intruded another person into it.] 1257. Walter de Salerno, also called Walter de Lon- don, Dean of St. Paul's, was appointed by tlie Pope; and after some difficulty obtained King Henry's confir- mation, and had his temporalities restored. He never personally visited his see, having been cut off\" by death at London, on his way home from Rome, in April or August, 1258. ARCHBISHOPS. 7 1259. Thomas, or Tomultach O'Conor, Bishop of Elphin, was elected by the Chapter, confirmed by the Pope, and accepted by the King. He was consecrated in the Pope's palace at Rome, from whence he brought home a Pallium, and great favours for the clergy besides. He appears to have been a man of ability, learning, and judgment. Having governed the sees of Tuam and Enachdune during twenty years, he died at Tuam in June, 1279. After his death, the see was kept vacant for some years. 1286. Stephen of Fulburn, Bishop of Waterford, was translated to Tuam by a Papal bull, dated 12th July, 1286, after a long contest between the rival claims of two other candidates, who had been severally elected by different portions of the Chapter of Tuam. Fulburn was an Englishman, and was a member of the Order of Knights Hospitallers ; he twice filled the office of Lord Justice of Ireland. He held the see of Enachdune as well as that of Tuam; but not without serious opposi- tion from a rival, John de Ufford, who had been elected Bishop and had received the King's confirmation of his appointment. He died in Dublin, on July 3rd, 1288, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral. 1289. William de Bermingham (called by the Irish \" Mac Feoris\"), the son of Miler Bermingham, the Chief of Athenry, was elected, and received confirmation from the King. Going afterwards to Rome, he accepted a fresh title to his see, from the Pope. For some years he held Enachdune, which was vacant, until a new Bishop of that see was elected. He died in January, 1311-12; and was buried in the Dominican Abbey of Athenry, which had been founded by his father. 1312. Malachi Mac ^dha (or Mac Hugh), Bishop of El- phin, was elected by the Canons; and having been ap- 8 TUAM. proved by the King, was also approved and confirmed by the Pope. He united Enachdune once more to the see of Tuara, by a formal decree of Pope John XX. notwithstanding the opposition of another prelate, whose claims to it were supported by the King, and the fact that it had been governed by Bishops of its own for more than twenty years. After an incumbency of thirty-five years, Malachi died on August 10th, 1348, and was buried in the Cathedral of Tuam. 1349. Thomas O'Carrol, Archdeacon of Cashel, and a Canon of Ardfert, was preferred to this see by the Pope ; although another person of high family, Robert Ber- mingham, had been elected Bishop by the Chapter. He was consecrated at Avignon. It is related, that O'Car- rol had been elected to the sees of Ardfert, and also of Clonmacnois; but that he chose to decline both those bishoprics. He appears to have been a person of emi- nent learning, and greatly esteemed. In 1365 the Pope translated him from hence to Cashel. 1365. John O'Grada (O'Grady), Archdeacon of Cashel, was elected by the Chapter, and received consecration at Avignon. The King accepted him, and restored his temporalities forthwith. The Four Masters, ever lavish of commendatory phrases, style him \" the most dis- tinguished man of his time for wisdom and hospitality.\" He died at Limerick, on September 19th, 1371, and was there interred. 1372. Gregory, Bishop of Elphin, was promoted to Tuam by the Pope. We hear nothing of his acts or character. He died in 1384. 1384. Gregory O'Moghan, or O'Mahon, obtained an ap- pointment to the See of Tuam from Clement VII. one of the contending claimants of the Papal throne ; but in the next year his rival. Pope Urban VI. having ARCHBISHOPS. 9 obtained the mastery, deposed Gregory, and appointed another Archbishop in his room. This insulting treat- ment is said to have broken his heart, and caused his death in 1392. O'Donovan is of opinion that this pre- late had been married before he took Holy Orders, as two of his sons are named in a pedigree of the family. [Hy-Fiachrach, p. 42.] 1386. William O'Cormacain was declared Archbishop by Pope Urban VI. But in 1394 his patron thought fit to compel him to resign in favour of a new protege, and to retire to the see of Clonfert. It is said that he took this ill-treatment so much to heart, that he neg- lected to take out the necessary instruments for his last bishopric, and died before he was put into possession of that See. 1394. Maurice O'Kelly, Bishop of Clonfert, being a fa- vourite of the Pope, was translated to this see, compul- sorily vacated by his predecessor. He was a man of high blood, belonging to the family of the chieftains of Hy- Many. Ma Geoghegan calls him \" a learned and witty prelate.\" He died on September 29th, 1409 (not 1407, as stated by Ware). [O'Donovan 's Tribes of Hy-Many.] 1410. John Babynghe, D. D. a Dominican friar, was ap- pointed by Pope Alexander V. before the end of 1409 ; but that Pope dying before his bulls were expe- dited, he received a new appointment from Pope John XXIII. dated 25th May, 1410. According to Ware, he enjoyed his bishopric a very short time (but the Hiber- nia Dominicana states that he lived till 1427, and says nothing about his having resigned at a previous period). 141 1(?) Cornelius, a Franciscan friar, was promoted to this See by the Pope, on September 18th of this year. [Ware.] But De Burgo shows that this date must CONNAUGHT.] C 10 TUAM. needs be wrong, and that Babynghe certainly held the archbishopric in July, 1418. 1427. John Baterley (or Barley), D. D. an Englishman, of the Order of St. Dominic, succeeded. He was a per- son of great learning, and an eloquent and assiduous preacher. It is reported that he composed several works, but none of them are known to be remaining. He sat about nine or ten years ; and was buried in the Domini- can Convent of Athenry, on the north side of the high altar. [1437. \" The Archbishop of Connaught Tuam, of the Ber- mingham family, died.\" [Four Masters.] Quasre, to whom does this allude ?] 1438. Thomas O'Kelly, a Dominican friar. Bishop of Clon- fert, was translated to Tuam by the Pope. He is spoken of as being a man eminent for piety and liberality. He died in 1441. 1441. John de Burgo, or Burke, a member of the family afterwards created Earls of Clanrickard, succeeded. Some of the annalists call him \"the Archbishop of Conaught, the son of the Parson, son of Mac Johnin Burke.\" [An- nals of Clonmacnois, apud Ware.] He died in Galway, in the year 1450. [1451. Redmond M'William Bermingham is said to have succeeeded Burke, by provision from the Pope ; but he did not live long enough to arrive from Rome and take possession of his see. [Annals of Clonmacnois, apud Ware.] 1451. The name of the next Archbishop has not been preserved. 1458. DoNAT O'Murry, O'Murchadha, or O'Murridy, an Augustinian Canon, was appointed by the Pope, about this year. He distinguished himself by founding the College of St. Nicholas at Galway, consisting of a War- ARCHBISHOPS. 11 den and eight Choral Vicars ; he also endowed it with the Archbishop's fourth portion of tithes arising out of the town of Gal way, and with other property. [O'Fla- herty's West Connaught.] He died on the 17th of Ja- nuary (in the year 1484, according to Ware's opinion). 1486. Peter of Burgundy, a Dominican friar, is stated to have been Archbishop ofTuam in 1486. [Hib. Domin.] 1487(?) William Joy was advanced by the Pope. His consecration took place in 1487. Ware believes that the Pope appointed him in 1485 ; but perhaps the ap- pointment was not completed at that time. He died on December 28th, 1501. 1503. Philip Pinson, D. D. an English Franciscan friar, a suffragan of the Bishop of Hereford, was appointed by the Pope, at the request of King Henry VII. on Decem- ber 2nd. But he died of the plague at Rome, within three days after his appointment. 1506. Maurice O'Fihely, or De Portu, D. D. a Francis- can friar, was promoted to this see by the Pope, on June 26th, after a vacancy of three years, in which interval King Henry VII. had bestowed it upon Walter Blake, Bishop of Clonmacnois (who had been nominated once before to Tuam, but unsuccessfully). The Pope pre- vailed. Maurice is related to have been a man of profound learning, an honour to his country. Three of the pro- vinces of Ireland contended for the honour of his birth. Sir James Ware judged that he was born near Balti- more, in the county of Cork. He was educated at the University of Padua; and for some years employed him- self as principal superintendent of the Press set up at Venice by Octavian Scot, a nobleman of Mons. After attending at the Council of Lateran in 1512, he returned to Ireland; but shortly afterwards was seized with a 12 TUAM. mortal sickness, which carried him off at Gal way, on May 25th, 1513, before he had time to say his first Mass in his cathedral. He was buried in the Franciscan Con- vent of Galway, on the south side of the choir. A list of his published works, so far as ascertained, may be seen in Ware's Writers of Ireland. 1513. Thomas O'Mullaly, or Laly, who probably was a Franciscan friar, succeeded Maurice. He died on April 28th, 1536, and was buried at Galway, in the same tomb with his immediate predecessor. 1536-7. Christopher BoDKYN, or BoDEKiN, Bishop ofKil- macduagh, was translated to Tuam by King Henry VIII. on February 15th. He was licensed to retain the See of Kilmacduagh in commendam. He appears to have pliantly conformed to the religious faith of the reigning monarch for the time, and by these means re- tained his preferments under Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. He died, full of years, in 1572, and was buried at Galway. [See Cod. Clar. 56.] 1573. William Mullaly, or Laly, B.C.L. was a native of Galway, and was educated at New Inn Hall, Oxford. He became Dean of Tuam in 1558 ; and held the rectory of Athenry, and the prebend of Laccagh, by letter of Privy Seal dated November 6th, 1572. [Rolls Office.] He was raised to the archbishopric by patent dated April 14th ; and held the See of Enachdune in commendam. Harris relates that, not content with these, he endea- voured to obtain possession of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh also, but did not succeed. He died in 1595. 1595. Nehemiah Donellan, a native of the county of Gal- way, was educated in the University of Cambridge. Soon after his return to Ireland, he was made coadjutor to his predecessor Laly ; and upon his death succeeded to the archbishopric, by patent dated May 17th. ARCHBISHOPS. 13 In the writ of Privy Seal directing his appointment, il; was alleged that he was \" very fit to communicate with the people in their mother tongue, and a very meet instrument to retain and instruct them in duty and reli- gion ; and that he had also taken great pains in transla- ting and putting to the press the Communion-Book and New Testament in the Irish language, which her Ma- jesty greatly approved of.\" [Rot. Pat. cited in D'Alton's Boyle.] He voluntarily resigned his see in the year 1609; and dying soon afterwards at Tuam was buried in his cathedral. The dedication and preface to the Irish New Testament printed in 1602 are of his compo- sition. For some account of his family, see \" The Tribes of Hy-Many,\" printed by the Archaeological Society of Ireland, p. 159. 1609. William Daniel, or O'Donnell, D. D. was born at Kilkenny. He was one of the first appointed Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin, and afterwards one of the first elected Fellows of tlie same. His patent for this see bears date August 2nd [Rot. Pat. 7 Jac. I.] ; and at the same time he was made Treasurer of St. Patrick's, Dublin. He was consecrated during the same month, in St. Patrick's. He was a person of distinguished learn- ing, and has left his country deeply indebted to him for his important labour of finishing the Irish translation of the New Testament, which had been commenced by Nicholas Walsh, Bishop of Ossory, and John Kearney, Treasurer of St. Patrick's, Dublin ; and also the version of the Book of Common Prayer ; the former of which works was printed in 1602, and the latter in 1608. The Archbishop died at Tuam on July 11th, 1628, and was buried in the same tomb with his predecessor Donellan. 1629. Randolph Barlow, D. D. Dean of Christ Church, TUAM. Dublin^ and Archdeacon of Meatli, having been warmly recommended by Archbishop Ussher to the King, was advanced to this see by patent dated April 2nd. He was permitted to hold his deanery and the rectory of Athenry, in commeyulam, for some years. (He resigned the deanery in 1634.) His\" consecration ,took place at Drogheda in the month of April. He died at Tuam, on February 22nd, 1637-8, aged 66 ; and was buried in the cathedral, where his tombstone still remains, in- scribed as follows: \" Randolph Barlow, sometime Lord Archbishop of this diocese, who departed this life the 22nd of February, 1637, Lieth here, interred in peace and rest, Too rich a gem for such a chest.\" This Stone was formerly hidden under the com- munion table, but has been removed recently to the southern side of the chancel. 1638. Richard Boyle, D. D. Bishop of Co?'k, &c. was translated to this see on May 30th. During the rebel- lion of 1641 he was put in great danger of his life; and with the Bishop of Killala and other Protestants, was obliged to take refuge in the town of Galway. He died in Cork, on March 19th, 1644-5 ; and was buried in that cathedral, in a tomb which he had previously pre- pared for himself. 1645. John Maxwell, D. D. Bishop of Killala, succeeded, by patent bearing date August 30th. He was a person of great learning, an eminent preacher, and of warm at- tachment to the cause and person of King Charles I. Bishop Burnet relates of him, that on hearing of some disaster which had befallen the Royal cause, he was so affected with grief, that it caused his death, in Dublin, on February 14th, 1646-7. The See remained unfilled till the Restoration. ARCHBISHOPS. 15 TUAM AND KILFENORA. 1660-1. Samuel Pullein, D. D. a native of England, edu- cated at Cambridge, came to Ireland as Chaplain to the Marquess of Ormond, Lord Lieutenant. In 1634 he was presented to a prebend in the Church of Kilkenny ; in 1636 was made Chancellor of Cashel, and Rector of Knockgraffan in that diocese ; in 1638 became Dean of Clonfert; and in 1642 a Prebendary of St. Patrick's, Dublin. At the rebellion of 1641 he was living at Cashel ; and was plundered and severely threatened by the rebels. For three months he was protected there, in the house of Mr. James Sail, a Jesuit ; and then, making his escape, he retired to England. Upon the King's Restoration he was promoted to this archbishop- ric, by patent dated January 19th, 1660-1 ; and was consecrated in St. Patrick's, Dublin, on January 27th. He also received a grant of the See of Kilfenora, to be holden in union with Tuam ; which union continued until the year 1742. He died on January 24th, 1666-7 ; and was buried in his Cathedral, opposite to the Arch- bishop's throne. 1667. John Parker, D. D. Bishop of Elphin, was trans- lated to the Sees of Tuam, Enachdune, and Kilfenora, by patent dated August 9th, and was enthroned at Tuam on September 5th.

Reg.] In September, 1684, he was appointed Warden of Galway. During the tyranny of Lord Tyr- connell under King James II. he was forced to fly from Tuam ; and with his wife and twelve children 16 TUAM. retired to England, and for some years employed himself as a lecturer in one of the city churches of London. At the Revolution he returned to his diocese. He presented to the cathedral the greatest portion of its communion-plate ; and by his will he left valuable be- nefactions, both to his diocese and to the poor. He died on March 28th, 1716, in the seventy-ninth year of his age; and was buried at Holymount, his place of resi-' dence. He left behind him the following works : 1. The Life of John Bramhall, Archbishop of Ar- magh (prefixed to an edition of his works), folio. Dublin, 1678. 2. An Assize Sermon, on Psalm cxxii. 6. 4to. London, 1683. 3.

Dublin, 1692. 1716. Edward Synge, D. D. Bishop of Raphoe, was pro- moted to this see, together with those of Enachdune and Kilfenora, and the Wardenship of Galway, by patent dated June 8tli. He was enthroned at Kilfenora on No- vember 7th. This Prelate voluntarily resigned to his clergy the \" quarta pars Episcopalis\" of the tithes of the whole diocese, which his predecessors had ahvays en- joyed; and procured an Act of Parliament securing its appropriation from that time forward. He presided over his sees with exemplary diligence for twenty-five years ; and during that time exerted himself in the pub- lication of tracts upon religious and moral subjects, to the number of fifty or more. A list of these may be seen ( ARCHBISHOPS. 17 in Ware's Writers of Ireland ; and a more full one in Nichols' Literary Anecdotes. Many of them have been adopted, and frequently reprinted for general distribu- tion, by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, The Archbishop died at Tuam, on July 23rd, 1741 ; and was buried in the churchyard of his cathedral, at the east end of the church. It was his own desire that no monument should be erected for him; but the in- habitants, to mark their respect to his memory, have placed the capital of the ancient Cross of Tuam over his grave. TUAM and ARDAGH. 1741-2. JosiAH HoRT, D. D. Bishop o^Kilmore^ was trans- lated to the See of Tuam, by patent dated January 27th ; and received that of Ardagh in commendam^ as did his successors for a century. He presented an organ to his cathedral of Tuam. Some of his earlier writings are mentioned under the diocese of Kilmore. He published his primary Charge in 1742, under the title of \" Instruc- tions to the Clergy of the Diocese of Tuam ;\" this was so highly approved, and judged to be of permanent utility, that it has been reprinted several times by the University of Oxford, in the collection called \" The Clergyman's Instructor.\" He also published \"A Sermon, before the Incorporated Society of Protestant Schools, in Dublin, on March 23rd, 1745.\" 4to. Dublin, 1746. He died on December 14th, 1751, and was buried at St. George's, Dublin. 1752. John Ryder, D. D.

Jemmet Browne, D. D. Bishop of Elphin, and pre- viously of Cork, succeeded, by patent bearing date April 11th. He died, at his family seat near Cork, in June, 1782, and was there buried (in the cathedral? or at Bal- linaspic ?) where his earliest preferment had been. 1782. The Hon. Joseph Deane Bourke, D. D. Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin, succeeded, by patent dated Au- gust 8th. He presented to the cathedral its great bell. In 17 9-, by the death of his elder brother, he became third Earl of Mayo.

Bishop of Elphin, was translated to these sees on November 10th. In 1834, upon the death of Dr. Verschoyle, Bi- shop of Killala and Achonry, those Sees became united, by Act of Parliament, to that of Tuam. The Archbi- shop died on March 25th, 1839; and was buried at Creagh, the burial place of his family, near the town of Ballinasloe. The clergy of his diocese erected a hand- some marble tablet to his memory in the cathedral. Upon his death, the See of Tuam ceased to be me- tropolitical ; and that of Ardagh was again united to Kilmbre. DEANS. 19 TUAM, KILLALA, and ACHOXRY. 1839. The Hon. Thomas Plunket, M. A.

He was consecrated at Christ Church, Dublin, in the same month, by the Archbishop of Dub- lin, assisted by the Bishops of Derry and Cashel ; and was enthroned at Tuam on June 23rd. DEAN AND CHAPTER. The cathedral body of Tuam now consists of a Dean, Pro- vost, Archdeacon, and eight Prebendaries; together with one Vicar Choral. It is of great antiquity, being mentioned in the year 1201. It seems not improbable that in early times there was some difference in its con- stitution. For instance, we find Florence M'Flynn called \" Chancellor of Tuam,\" when he was raised to the archbishopric, in 1250 [Ware] ; and Robert Berming- ham is likewise called \" Chancellor\" when^lected Arch- bishop in 1349. [Ibid,] But it is very'possible that both these persons were Chancellors of tlie diocese^ i. e. Vicars General. At a later period, at a Visitation du- ring the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Malachi O'Molownan is styled \" Treasurer of Tuam.\" [MS. Trin. Coll. Dubl. E. 3. 14.] Neither a Chancellor nor Treasurer is ac- knowledged at the present day. 20 TUAM. SEAL. A seal of the Dean and Chapter is engraved in Harris' Ware. It bears the figure of a very large church, with the inscription, sig. decani et capit. tuam, without any date. SUCCESSION OF DEANS. 1230. Marian, or Mael-Murry, O'Laghnan, said to be an eminent Canonist, was Dean. [Cod. Clar. 46.] In 1235 he was elected Archbishop of the see. He undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and committed an account of his travels to writing. He died at Athlone, shortly be- fore Christmas, in the year 1249. 1282. CoNSTANTiNE O'DowD appears as Dean. [Cod. Clar. 46.] 133-? Philip Hanlain was Dean. He died on June 19th, 1339. [Ibid.] 1339. Denis, son of Hugh M'iEdha, succeeded. [Ibid.] 1394. James appears as Dean 1399. James Caer (Carr, or Cahir?) probably the same person, was Dean. [Ibid.] 1523. Thomas was Dean. [See the Miscellany of the Irish Archasological Society, vol. i. p. 75.] 1558. William Mullaly, or Laly, B.C.L. was a native of Galway, but received his education in the University of Oxford, and graduated there. He was presented to this dignity on November 7th, and with it held the prebend of Laccagh. In 1573 he was raised to the archbishopric. He died in 1595. 1573. Edward Browne, Prebendary of Laccagh also, was presented to this deanery on April 21st. At the same DEANS. 21 time he received a dispensation to retain his prebend, together with other preferment ; a favour vsrhich appears to have been granted to him, by reason of his having been designed by the Queen for the bishopric of Down, but another person had previously received that appoint- ment. In a Visitation Book remaining in Trinity Col- lege, Dublin (of about the year 1591) [MS. e. 3. 14.], he is styled Dean of Tuam, and Dean of Mayo or Annaghdown; \"but a certain Thomas Ballagh alleges that he is Rector.\" 1609-10. Abel Walsh, D. D. a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, was presented on February 6th. [Rot. Pat.] He was a Vicar Choral also at the time. [MS. Marsh.] In December, 1615, the Crown presented him to the vicarage of Eirke, in the diocese of Ossory ; and he also held a prebend in the cathedral of Kilkenny. 1625. Thomas Peyton, a Fellow of Trinity College, Dub- lin, was presented on June 2nd. [Lib. Mun.] He died some time after the year 1637, and was buried in the cathedral, near to the Communion table ; where a stone to his memory still remains, but the date of his death is not given on it. 1638? John King, M. A. a Prebendary ofElphin, suc- ceeded. [Lib. Mun.] He appears as Dean in 1650. [Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 132.] 1661. William Buchanan, M. A.

AYhite was made Dean of Kilfenora (at that period united to Tuam) in 1716. He resigned on August 2nd, 1724.] [1724. Jonathan Bruce, M. A. succeeded, (ff.) I think there may be the same mistake here. Bruce was ap- pointed Dean of Kilfenora in 1724, and held that dignity to the year 1750, or later.] 1743. Isaac Gervais, M. A. a Prebendary of Lismore, was presented on May 29th. [Lib.

It appears that in ancient times tlie Vicars Choral of Tuam were five in number. In process of time some of these were discontinued, and their revenues were applied to the purposes of an CEconomy Fund. The diminution in number was gradual, as will be seen below. At the present time there is only a single one. In the Regal Visitation Book of 1615, the five Vicars Choral are stated to be \" Rectors and Vicars of the ca- thedral church of Tuam.\" Between 1558 and 1573, the following Vicars are named. Thomas O'Donnell. John Cosgrave. John Day. \" He is studying at Dublin.\" CoNLY O'Kenny. \" Studying at Oxford.\" Thomas Magley. [MS. Trin. Coll. Dubl. e. 3. 13.] 1573-1600.

The See of Mayo is believed to have been erected in the middle of the seventh century. Probably it was of but small extent. The time at which it became united to Tuam is doubtful. Sir James Ware thought that the union took place in the year 1210; but his editor, Harris, fol- lowing Archbishop Ussher's judgment, believes that the union was not perfectly established before the year 1559. The few prelates, whose names can now be collected, are here enumerated ; chiefly taken from the Annals of Innisfallen, as quoted by Harris. A. D. 665, or 670? St. Gerald, a native of England, one of the disciples of St. Colman, Bishop of Lindisfarne, enlarged a monastery at Mayo, which Colman had founded, chiefly for the reception of some Englishmen CONNAUGHT.] H 50 MAYO. who had followed him from that country ; from which circumstance it afterwards obtained the name of \" Mayo of the Saxons.*' Gerald erected this monastery into an episcopal see, and himself became its first Bishop. He died on March 13th, about the year 697, according to Ware ; or, as the Annals of Tigernach say, in 732. 726, or 732. Muredach M'Inracht, or the son of Ixdrecht, \"Bishop of Mayo of the Saxons,\" died; having been killed in the battle of Conaght. [Ma Geoghegan.] But see O'Dono van's Hy-Fiachrach, p. 453, who main- tains that Muredach was not a Bishop, but a Chieftain. 768. AiDAN, Bishop of Mayo, died. 1209-10. Cele 0\"Dubhai (O'Duffy), \"Bishop of Mayo of the Saxons,'' died. [Four ^Masters.] 1231. Stephen O'Brachin (O'Brochan?) \" Archennach, or Chief Governor of Mayo,\" died. [It does not neces- sarily follow that he was Bishop.^ 1428. William Prendergast, a Franciscan friar, was pro- moted to this see by the Pope, on July 16th. In 1430 he was deprived, for not taking out the necessary letters and papers at Rome ; upon which, 1430. Nicholas Wogomai, another Franciscan, was sub- stituted in his room by the Pope, on July 17th. 1478. O'HiGGiN, \" Bishop of Mayo of the Saxons,\" died. [Four Masters.] 1492, or 1493. Odo, or Hugh, Bishop of Mayo, died. 1493. John Bell, a Franciscan friar, who was acting as a Suffragan of the Archbishop of Canterbury, succeeded, on November 5th. 1557. Eugene Mac Brechan, Bretherne, or Brethmain, was Bishop in this year; and held a provincial Synod at Drogheda, on behalf of the Archbishop of Armagh. [Reg. Dowdall,] In 1559 the See of Mayo became per- manently imited to that of Tuam. BISHOPS. 51 ARCHDEACONS OF MAYO. See among the earlier Archdeacons of Tua?n. THE SEE OF ENACHDUNE. Enachdune, now called Annaghdown, is a village in the county of Galway, situate on the shore of Lough Corrib. It is understood that an episcopal See was established here at a very early period ; but the exact date does not appear to be known. Probably here, as occurred in se- veral other instances, the ancient abbey was raised to episcopal dignity. At different periods we find this see united to that of Tuam (and possibly to that of Clonfert) ; but I have not been able to ascertain the year in which its final and formal union with Tuam took place. A curious description of this bishopric, and of the clergy belonging to it, occurs in a letter addressed by the Earl of Ossory to Thomas Cromwell, Vicar in spiri- tual matters to King Henry VIII. This letter, which was copied, by Sir James Ware, from the original among Sir George Carew's papers, has been printed in \" State Papers.\" The cathedral had a Dean and Chapter, and for- merly four Vicars Choral. The Prelates of Enachdune, so far as we can now trace them, are the following. 52 ENACHDUNE. BISHOPS. Ssec. VII. St. Meldan was Abbat or Bishop of Lough Orbfen, or Lough Corrib. [Monast. Hibern.] 1152. TuATHAL O'CoNACTAiG, Bishop of Enachduno, as- sisted at the Synod of Kells, in this year. [Harris.] But the Four Masters call him Bishop of Tir Briuin (i. e. Kilmore) ; and place his death in 1179. 1189. CoNCORS, or Conor (O'Mealy), Bishop ofEnagh- dune, was present at the coronation of King Richard L [Ware's Annals.] The Four Masters style him \" a bril- liant gem and a pillar of the Church,\" and place his death at the year 1201. 1240. Murtagh O'Flaherty, Bishop, died. [Four Mas- ters.] 1250. Thomas O'Meallaidh (O'Maley) died about this year. [Ibid.] 1251. Florence M'Flin, Archbishop of Tuam, seized this bishopric, upon the death of O'Maley ; and retained both its spiritualities and temporalities; which after- wards were confirmed to him on his petition, by King Henry III. in the year 1252, at which time the bishop- ric was declared to be nothing more than an ordinary parish. Notwithstanding this declaration, we find seve- ral bishops elected to Enaghdune alone, for a long time after. 1251. CoNCORS, or Conor, was consecrated to this See, and was confirmed, by the King, on May 8th. But he could not recover his temporalities out of Archbishop Flo- rence's hands. 1259. Thomas O' Conor, Archbishop of Tuam, held Enagh- dune also, from this year till his death in 1279. 1282. John de Ufford was elected Bishop, and obtained the royal assent on March 16th. But four or five years BISHOPS. 53 afterwards he was ejected by the Archbishop of Tuam, who took possession. 1286. Stephen of Fulburn, Archbishop of Tuam. [See under Tuam^ 1289. William de Bermingham, who was appointed Archbishop of Tuam in this year, \" followed the exam- ple of his predecessors, and annexed the church of Enachdune, which was still vacant, to that of Tuam. He also caused the mitre, pastoral staflP, and other pon- tificalia of the Bishop of Enachdune, which had been placed for safety in a convent at Clare, till the creation of a new Bishop, to be taken away.\" However, he after- wards was compelled to surrender this see. 1306. Gilbert, a Franciscan friar, having been elected by the Dean and Chapter (but without their having ob- tained the King's license to elect), was consecrated. Two years afterwards his temporalities were restored to him, on June 15th; the King having pardoned his omission, for a fine of £300. The Archbishop of Tuam gave every opposition, and complained of him to the Pope ; but Gilbert retained possession for nearly twenty years. While holding this See, the Bishop appears to have acted as a suffragan in England (as was the custom with many Irish prelates about this period). We find him granting an indulgence of forty days to all those persons who should pray for the souls of William Fundy and his wife, who were buried in the church of Kingsbury, Warwickshire. [Astle's Catalogue of Charters.] Also in the year 1301, he dedicated an altar in the Abbat's Chapel at Nether Cerne Abbey, Dorsetshire; and granted an indulgence of twenty days to those who should visit it. He likewise dedicated the chapel of the Infirmary there; and granted an indulgence of thirty 54 ENACHDUNE. days to all who should visit it. [Hutcliins' Dorsetshire, vol. ii. p. 289.] 1324? James O'Kearney was appointed Bishop by Pope John XXII. and by the same authority he was trans- lated to Connor, in 1325 or 1326. 1325-6? Robert le Petit, Bishop of Clonfert, was ap- pointed by the Pope on November 8th ; and had his temporalities restored by the King on June 22nd (or December 5th), 1326. [Rot. Claus. 20 Edw. II.] He sat but a short time. 1327. Thomas O'Maley, w^ho was Archdeacon of Enach- dune in 1311, succeeded. He appears to have gone over to the Pope, who was at Avignon, and to have died in that city. The old annalists place his death in 1328; but Harris is of opinion that he was sitting in 1330, at which time a complaint was made to the Pope by King Edward III. that the Archbishop of Tuam had possessed himself of this see, under cover of a pretended union, said to have been made by the Pope in 1324, which union had been kept secret both from the King and the Bishop. This appeal proved ineffectual, and the Arch- bishop retained possession. 1330. Malachi Mac Mba, Archbishop of Tuam, reco- vered this see, as stated above, and kept it till his death in 1348. Yet Ware states (p. 640) that on Bishop O'Maley 's death the temporalities of Enachdune were seized into the King's hands, and so continued till the year 1346. 1395. Henry, Bishop of Enachdune, or of Mayo, is men- tioned at this year as being a suffragan to the Bishop of Exeter. [Registr. Exon. Dr. Todd.] 139-. John Twillow, Bishop, died in 1402. [Ware.] In 1396 the Bishop of Enachdune, a suffragan of the Bi- shop of Oxford (quaere, Exeter ?) dedicated two altars in BISHOPS. 55 the chapel of Nether Cerne, Dorsetshire. [Hutchins Dorsetshire.] 1402. John Brit, a Franciscan friar, was appointed suc- cessor, on January 24th. [Ware.] 1421. Matthew, Bishop of Enachdune, died. 1421. John Connere (Connery? or Bonnere?) a Fran- ciscan Friar, was advanced to the See, upon Matthew's death, on November 14th. He appears to have holden preferment in England together with his See. Hutchins [Hist, of Dorset] states, that \" in 1422, John Boner, Bishop of Enachdune, exchanged his rectory of Ched- dington for the vicarage of Nether Cerne in Dorsetshire, to which he was instituted on December 8th, 1422.\" 1438. John, Bishop of Enachdune, is named as a suffragan of the Bishop of Exeter. [Registr. Exon.] 1450. Thomas, \" Bishop of Enachdune, or of Mayo,\" was a suffragan of the See of Exeter. [Ibid.] 1484. Thomas Barrett appears to have been Bishop (un- less there be some confounding of him with T. Barrett, who was A rchdeacon of Enachdune, and Bishop of El- phin, in 1372). A manuscript in the British Museum has the following entry: \"Mr. Thos. Barrett, Bishop of Knackdune, hath the moyetie of the lordship of Bren, in Brentmarshe, so long as he shall stand Persone there ; so that he with the revenues fortifie the sea-walles and bancks for the salvacion of the said lordship.\" [Cat. MSS. Harleian, No. 1278 (anno 2 Ric. IH.) See also Nos. 2293-7.] Thomas Barrett had been Prebendary of Laughton, in the church of York (quasre, Lincoln ?) and was a Suffragan of the Bishop of Lincoln. [Cole.] 1551. John Moore is called \" Suffragan Bishop of Enach- dune ;\" and receives a mandate to assist at the consecra- tion of Patrick Walsh, Bishop elect of Waterford. [Cod. Clar. 36.] 56 ENACHDUNE. 1573. William Mullaly, Archbishop of Tuam, held this see. 1622. A return, made to the Royal Commissioners by Arch- bishop Daniel, of Tuam, mentions \" Annaghdown, for- merly a bishopric united to Tuam ; now merely a rec- tory, the revenues of which the Earl of Clanrickard enjoys. It formerly had four Vicars Choral.\" [MS. ]\\Iarsh.] DEAN AND CHAPTER. There appears to have been in ancient times a Dean, an Archdeacon, and some Canons. [The diocese hkewise had its \" Official,\" or Chancellor.] The Canons are mentioned in the year 1206. [Ware, p. 605.] In 1306 the Dean and Chapter are mentioned as electing their Bishop. [Ibid.] DEANS. 1523. Donald OTlaherty is Dean. In 1527 he under- takes to defend the Warden and Vicai*s of Galway against Bernard O'Flaherty and all his claims. [OTla- herty, p. 226.] 1558.

O'Laidigh, Archdeacon of Enachdune, died. [Four Masters.] 1311. Thomas O'Maley, M. A. was Archdeacon, having been presented by the Crown, sede vacante. In 1327 he was raised to the bishopric. [Cod. Clar. 36, and MS. Trin. Coll. Dubl. f. i. 18.] 1372. Thomas Barrett, Archdeacon, became Bishop of Elphin, in this year ; and after governing that diocese thirty-two years, left a very high character behind him. [Ware.] 1523. Edmund de Burgo was Archdeacon. [Miscell. Archaaol. vol. i. p. 75.] 1558-1572. Stephen Kyrnay (Kearney?) was Archdea- con. He is described as \" a student residing at Oxford.\" [MS. Trin. Coll. Dubl. e. 3. 13.] I do not know whether this be the same as Stephen Kerovan (Kirwan) who follows. 1572. Stephen Kerovan was a native of Galway, and was educated partly at Oxford, and partly at Paris. On re- turning from Paris he conformed to the Protestant reli- gion, and was made Archdeacon of Enaghdune. In 1573 he was raised to the bishopric of Kilmacduagh ; and in 1582 was translated to Clonfert. 1591. CoNLY O'Kenevan (Kirwan?) is called Archdeacon of Tuam and of Enachdune. [MS. Trin. Coll. Dubl. e. 3- 13-] connaught.] I 58 ENACHDUNE. CANONS. 1328. Maurice O'Gibellain, LL. D. the greatest pluralist in Connaiight, was a Canon. See more of him among the Canons of Tiiam. 1487. Walter Blake was a Canon. In this year he was advanced to the bishopric of Clonmacnois. [Ware, p. 174.] King Henry VII. wished to make him Archbi- shop of Tuam in 1504 or 1505, but the Pope refused his assent, and appointed another person. [O'Flaherty, p. 224-5.] 1487. John de Burgo, and Nehemjah Magonelly, are Canons, and Officials. The latter was also a Canon of Tuam. 1492. Richard (or Ristard) de Burgo, a member of the powerful family of that name, had possessed himself of a canonry, and likewise of the rectory and vicarage of Fur- anmor in this diocese. He wanted this last church to be erected into a prebend ; but the metropolitan, the Arch- bishop of Tuam, would not give his consent. This Ri- chard had also obtained canonries in the churches of Tuam and of Kilmacduagh. He was living in 1511. [OTlaherty, pp. 168, 222, &c.] 1511. Thomas Mac Floyn, or Mac Flyn, was a Canon. [Ibid. p. 171.] 1523. Walter Cussin is mentioned as a Canon both of Tuam and of Enachdune. [Miscell. Archaeol. Soc. vol. i. p. 75.] VICARS CHORAL. 59 VICARS CHORAL. It does not appear when these Vicars were first added to the cathedral; nor at what period they ceased. The only notice of them which I have met with is the fol- lowing : A. D. 1558-72(?) The four Vicars are returned as follows, in a manuscript in Trinity College, Dublin, [e. 3. 13.] Clement Skerett is custos o^two. Thady M'Neale. John M'Neale. Skyrett, or Skerett, was a Prebendary of Tiiam at this time. 60 KILLALA. DIOCESE OF KILLALA. The See of Killala is believed to be one of those which owes its foundation to St. Patrick. One of his biogra- phers relates, that in his progress through Connaught, he built a church at a pleasant place on the river Moy, and named it Kill-aladh. He appointed Muredach, one of his disciples, its first Bishop. This transaction must have taken place between the years 434 and 441. In later times the prelates of this See were called by the territorial name, Bishops of \" Tir-Amalgaid\" (now Tyrawley) ; and sometimes of \" Hy-Amalgaid,\" or \" Hy Fiachra-mui,\" from the families of the district in which Killala is situate. Very few traces of its earlier prelates are now to be found. ARMS OF THE SEE. I know of no ancient seal of this diocese remaining. The modern armorial bearings are engraved in Harris's Ware.

St. Muredach, a disciple of St. Patrick, and one of his companions, was appointed by him the first Bishop of his Church of Killala ; and received con- secration accordingly. We do not know the exact time of his appointment, nor how long he sat, nor who suc- ceeded him for the next hundred years. O'Donovan is of opinion, that this Muireadach cannot have been the first Bishop, seeing that his received pedigree would place him nearly two centuries too late. [Hy-Fiach- rach, p. 228.] Perhaps there were two prelates of the same name. 534 to 544 ? Kellach, the son of a King of Connaught, is said to have been Bishop of Killala, between these years. \" He was murdered by his fosterers, near a place called Adergoole, and the murderers were torn in pieces by wild horses.\" [Harris.] During this long hiatus in the line of prelates of Killala, we hear (from the poet Giolla losa Mor INIac Firbis), of seven Bishops of one noted family, the O'Maolfoghmhairs, descendants of King Laoghgaire, monarch of Ireland, in the fifth century ; who, accord- 62 KILLALA. ing to O'Donovan, were the Herenachs, or hereditary wardens, of the church of Killala. Their names are as follows ; but we know nothing of the order of their suc- cession, nor of the periods of their incumbency. [See Hy-Fiachrach, pp. 50, 51, 227, 228.] Mo Cele O'Maolfoghmhair.
