        "text": "Steve: that’s silly. The Church has gone to great efforts under the last several pontiffs to improve relations with Judaism. Aggressive secularism, cafeteria wishy-washy-ness, and maybe Islam scare the Vatican. Jews most certainly do not.\n\nHenry: I think you’re wrong in suggesting that it’s particularly bottom-up change that the Church is slow to enact. Top-down change rarely works well either. The Church is by tradition and structure a very conservative organization. When change happens rapidly, as after Vatican II, it’s usually only because top-down and bottom-up pressures were both pushing against a dam for some time in advance. Bishops and bureaucracies have considerable autonomy, whatever the notional organizational lines look like.\n\nI would suggest that a much more helpful way to look at this issue is through the lens of the liberation theology movement, the response to which Cardinal Ratzinger was quite closely involved with. I think that showed that he is extremely worried about de jure evils (heterodoxy, heresy, schism) and thinks that those are where the *public* response of the hierarchy should be concentrated, whereas de facto evils (militarism, child abuse) can better be answered locally and through back channels, and to some extent will always be with us. Now it’s certainly appropriate to wonder about both the prioritization and the tactics there, but that’s a far cry from suggesting that these evils were being actively perpetuated. As with many large organizations, institutional dysfunction and incompetence of various kinds explain far more concrete evil than malice ever could.\n\nWith regard to the conspiracy theory, I don’t think it’s so much “conspiracy” per se, in the sense of explicit backroom deals, but rather a (frequently healthy) journalistic ideology which explicitly prioritizes de facto evils (news) over de jure evils (see: complicity with Bush administration), combined with an antipathy towards fervent religion and medieval governance. When those are added together, the Church ends up held to a much higher standard–on the other hand, it’s hard to argue that we shouldn’t be held to a higher standard, either. Jesus wasn’t much fond of the hypocrites.\n\nLord, I wish folks would try a little harder to FOCUS.\n\nFor one thing, the Pope is not “infallible”. The doctrine doesn’t say that if a Pope decided to get into the Vatican office pool on the NCAA, he’s gonna beat out the autistic kid with all perfect picks. The doctrine is that when the Pope SAYS something is a matter of faith and morals on which what he is saying right now, on this matter, is absolutely true: THEN — and only then — is that doctrine infallible.\n\nIt’s only ever been used for I think three statements about Mary.\n\nFor another, there are two reasons why this scandal is so serious for the Church, and neither of ’em are directly related to sex, as such.\n\nThe primary reason it’s so serious is because the Church so clearly aided and abetted crimes and criminals. If these guys had been sneaking out of the confessional to knock off banks and 7-11s, it would be pretty easy to see that the responsibility of their employer would have been to turn ’em in. Somehow, that wasn’t clear to the Church itself.\n\nThe second reason it’s so serious is because it speaks to the relationship that doctrine has to the institution. In most institutions, if a minor official commits a crime and a mid-level official covers it up, the institution itself is structured so that they can cut it off and heal — hell, making prompt hard calls like that is precisely what gets mid-level officials promoted to the top levels, in healthy organizations. But the Church’s institutional structure is so saturated with its doctrine that they’re just not nimble (much less responsible, never mind moral) about the obvious civic responsibilities they shirked.\n\nThat’s why this is so serious, and why they’ve had such difficulties dealing with matters that, in a healthy institution, would have been dealt with long ago.\n\nSo, naturally, they’re dealing with the problem at the top, because there’s no place else to pass it along: I’m not sure a Pope has EVER resigned, so don’t hold your breath it will happen now.\n\nAn arrest seems more likely – and man! that would be crushing.\n\nIt would be interesting if somebody familiar with Catholic doctrine were to actually write out what the Pope should say, and do, that even COULD be consistent with the institutional responsibilities of the office.\n\nOk, I should probably try hard to be more clear. First, I am not defending pederast priests. Second, I am not defending bishops who exhibited, at best, gross negligence in making sure that those likely offenders did not reoffend. Third, I don’t know the law well enough to know whether the bishops’ actions were illegal or not. I am not suggesting that law enforcement ought not prosecute. Fourth, I am not defending gross bureaucratic negligence in keeping and sharing appropriate records. So what am I saying?\n\nFirst, that it’s appropriate for bishops to look to canon law first, as a moral matter. It’s the legal code they’ve sworn to uphold, its basic structures predate most civil codes, and while perhaps details should be changed it’s basically fair to accuser and accused. The church is a 501(c)3 but it is not merely that, and its religions and state aspects are not peripheral to its operation.\n\nSecond, that on the question of private settlements with victims, rather than on the one of reassignments (recognizing in practice they often went together) the moral ground is hazy. If allegations are made which do not constitute a preponderance of evidence, and those allegations will destroy a person’s career if publicized, and if the alleger does in fact need counseling, etc, coming to a deal is not always wrong. Certainly not all civil cases settled privately with sealed documents are in moral error? Though this does make me queasy, perhaps because it was so frequently used with reassignment and without sharing internal documentation.\n\nThird, that those saying the Church needs to change structure to deal with this are ignoring that it managed to halt the pandemic twenty years ago, and is being extremely vigilant to prevent recurrence. Certainly the existence of a pandemic in the first place is abhorrent, but also clearly the structures are able to succeed in stopping one. Publicity, denunciations, and law enforcement are not necessary at this time for the cause of stopping an abuse pandemic.\n\nFourth, I think that absent a founded belief that further harm will take place, you do not have a moral obligation to denounce or disown someone on account of past evil. No one has yet given an account of what would give rise to such an obligation.\n\nSalient: I think the moral situation of X hinges most crucially on the bit about X’s son having more kids. Bishops who did not prevent this were in deep moral error.\n\nMaurice: until recently, I don’t believe it was in most jurisdictions a legal obligation. If it were, Massachusetts would not have updates its statute on the subject.\n\nPoliticalfootball: Law is the only non-retired Cardinal who does not have a curial or diocesan position of authority. This is not an accident.\n\nNot to get self-referential, but it seems like it might be useful to explain my monicker in this context: in the 18th century, it became necessary to create an American bishop — John Carroll. Like all consecrated bishops, he was required to condemn all heresies and heretics. Unlike others, he refused — because that would have meant that he would have been damning George Washington himself (a Mason). The Vatican let that slide for about a century.\n\nBut Carroll’s refusal began what was eventually known as “the Americanist heresy”. The American divergence from Vatican doctrine really got going in the 1850s, when Pius IX issued the Syllabus of Errors which said, among other things, that freedom of speech and religion, and the separation of Church and State, were not compatible with being a faithful Catholic. (Catholic apologists note that Pius did not claim the Syllabus was infallible doctrine; most folks figure this is a distinction without much difference.)\n\nIn mid to late 19th century America, there was a wave of Catholic immigration as well as a resurgence of the faith among foreign stock (US citizens with immigrant parents), particularly among German-Americans in the midwest. The leaders of that resurgence, notably Hecker and Orestes Brownson, didn’t emphasize certain aspects of Catholicism (e.g., Mary), but were passionate that being a good Catholic AND a patriotic American was not only possible, it was a Very Good Thing. (The Vatican wasn’t quite sure.)\n\nOne of these guys served in the Civil War, and eventually became Cardinal Gibbons, who gave us the Baltimore Catechism. (Taught Babe Ruth, too.) He was in charge of the American Church when a bunch of French knuckleheads provoked Leo XIII to investigate, and eventually condemn “Americanism”.\n\nIt’s sometimes called the phantom heresy, because neither the US Church nor the Vatican wants to recall what it meant — particularly now. In a nutshell, the Americanist heresy was the idea that civics has a moral value in itself. When I read about that, I thought: well, that’s me. Thus, my online id and alter ego.\n\nLeo XIII condemned the Americanist heresey in 1899 by citing Church authority: civics, he said, has no moral value UNLESS it reinforces the authority of the Pope.\n\nThe thing about the Americanist heresy is that, in the end, it WON: much of the core ideas of the heresy (for example, the redefinition of “outside the Church there is no salvation” ) became Church doctrine at Vatican II, notably because of JC Murray.\n\nSo it’s central to the reactionary approach the Church has taken since Vatican II, personified by Benedict but beginning with JPII before he became Pope, when he served as the Vatican’s designated dissenter from the birth control commission (which included not only laymen, but also married women!); JPII’s dissent became the Vatican’s position on the relationship between celibate authority and sex.\n\nThe Americanist heresy doesn’t recognize the tainted Biblical idea of rendering unto Caesar (which was, after all, a defense of slavery), it acknowledges instead that secular authority in a democracy has an inherently moral power which the Church must accept. (As a Union veteran of the Civil War, Gibbons knew this keenly — the Catholic Church was the largest American denomination that did not split over slavery: nobody needed to tell Gibbons that Southern Catholics were wrong, no matter what they were told from the pulpit.)\n\nLOL — anyway, TMI. It just seems relevant to any discussion of how and why the Vatican just didn’t order all bishops to turn all criminal priests over to the cops. (But if anybody wants to produce the play I’ve written about all this, let me know.)\n\nKewlness — I appreciate the encouragement.\n\nLOL — and I didn’t even mention the lesbian lead character.*\n\n*F’r real, btw: her name was Ella Edes, and she was the Vatican reporter for the American Catholic press. She knew everybody, and was a genuine player in the Vatican’s wheeling and dealing surrounding the Spanish-American War, which the Pope opposed. The evidence for her orientation is that she never married but had a lifelong female companion, which I have some fun with onstage: gotta love a tall, striking redhead who used her beauty to get her brains where they could do some good.\n\nI also couldn’t resist telling part of the story — which has to have a big historic sweep to work — with Teddy Roosevelt, for two reasons: first, TR was the first to apply the word “Americanization” to immigrants. Orestes Brownson had coined the word — and probably the concept — for the American Catholic Church. When he was NYC police commissioner, TR had dinner with Cardinal Gibbons in Baltimore (at the home of his friend, who was Napoleon’s nephew, no less), which is where TR heard the word from Gibbons himself.\n\nSecondly, the Vatican’s attempt to keep secular America from kicking Catholic Spain out of Cuba was the most important global event leading up to Leo XIII condemning the Americanist heresy. But not too long before, there was this intriguing little staged event at Cape May, between President Harrison and Cardinal Gibbons, who just ‘happened’ to be walking along the same stretch of beach. The incident has intriguing echoes with what happened much later with Hitler, and even what goes on now with Muslims and al-Qaeda: there was a fight between the German and Irish stock Catholics in the US at the time. The German stock folks resented all the Irish stock guys hogging the American appointments for bishops — which, as it happens, is Ross Douthat’s theme on the scandal, that Cullen in Ireland (the worst anti-erotic bishop of modern times) caused the repressive character of the Church which in turn caused the scandal.\n\nSo Gibbons, as the first cardinal in the American church, made a point of bumping into the President of the United States at the beach, and got his informal personal opinion that it would better for American Catholics to be taught in English than in German. (Sounds something like the current debate over Spanish-speaking immigrants, no?) That’s what Gibbons wanted, so he promptly communicated it to Leo XIII, who immediately squelched the Prussian movement called Cahenslyism.\n\nI think it’s a helluva story, at any rate, and oughta be more widely known.\n\nAn interesting, if somewhat abstract and definitely ahistorical point.\n\nMy general feeling about that sort of argumentation is that IF you want to argue abstractions, you have to stick it out: no fair being abstract when you think it fits, and concrete when the abstractions don’t work for you. If you want to make an abstract argument about an historical example, it has to work for the relevant historical examples.\n\nYours doesn’t.\n\nCardinal Gibbon (I have a mental block and keep pluralizing him) was a Union chaplain in the Civil War. Since he was the ranking Americanist — which he stoutly and rather cleverly denied — his historical experience is the one that counts most: as a matter of civics, the Confederacy LOST. That’s the real history of the Americanist heresy, which is partly how I boil it down to the idea that civics has a moral value in itself.\n\nRemember, in a sense this was the central issue in the Civil War itself: the Confederacy insisted that secession was legal, which is why they fought to do it, in order to preserve slavery. The Union insisted that secession was illegal, in fact, not possible without destroying the country. While it is certainly true that slavery somehow caused the war (as Lincoln put it), it is not true that the Union began to fight in order to destroy slavery. But it became clear that the only way to save the Union was to abolish slavery, so that’s what they did.\n\nThat is a damned powerful, practical lesson in the moral value of civics. Nobody knew it more plainly than Gibbon, who saw a lot of blood shed — AND, what’s more, also noticed that the only US religious denomination that did not split into Northern and Southern sects because of the war was the one he belonged to, the Roman Catholics of America.\n\nSo your point, interesting in the abstract, is simply contrary to the actual history.\n\nOddly, you also make essentially the same abstract argument that the Papacy does: it is, after all, essentially a monarchy, albeit one that as a practical matter precludes hereditary titles . But the whole model of the Vatican since at least the Dark Ages has been an authoritarian monarchy, with the Pope elected by the Cardinals and then appointing (and creating) Cardinals himself, who in turn create bishops, who assign priests to parishes, and so on. Cradle Catholics are often just amazed that other denominations essentially have the congregations hire their pastors — it’s like rain falling up.\n\nSo Leo XIII’s condemnation of the Americanist heresy makes essentially the same argument that you do: only the absolute authority of the ultimate good justifies any earthly power, so totalitarianism is superior to self-rule — which in any case is merely an illusion, a trick of Satan.\n\nI dunno as you want to be making that argument, even in the abstract: but you did. I realize you think you were making a relative argument — that a slaveholder “democracy” can be morally inferior to a “free” monarchy — but it’s bullshit.\n\nBTW — the way Gibbon dealt with the Pope’s condemnation of “Americanism” was priceless, and verrrry American. Basically, French knuckleheads precipitated the crisis for their own purposes — they wanted to get the Vatican out of political power in France, so they promoted the idea that American Catholics had figured out how to be religiously independent in politics. This obviously freaked out the Vatican, which was already fighting with Bismarck (the original Kulturkampf), so they finally decided to DO something about these doctrinally-suspect Americans, with their separation of Church and State, religious liberty and free speech.\n\nA couple of the Americanists — notably Monsignor Denis O’Connell (from South Carolina, no less), and the founders of Catholic University in DC — had been articulating a full-blown theory of American Catholicism which had attracted attention throughout Europe. (O’Connell gave a big speech at Fribourg.) In the US, two Irish-American bishops argued opposite sides — McQuade bragged that he had never voted, because it only encouraged sin, and he discouraged faithful Catholics from voting, while Bishop Ireland used to give great bellowing speeches about how participating in American democracy was a blessed cause.\n\nSo when Leo XIII condemned the Americanist heresy in that loopy Papal language, he was essentially backing McQuade while Ireland, God love him, immediately wanted to argue with the Pope about how none of what the Vatican objected to had ever been part of the Americanist theology….\n\nBut Gibbon told him to STFU, and responded to the Pope: Brilliant letter, boss, condemning all that nasty stuff. Good thing nobody around HERE ever believed any of that, huh?\n\nLOL — and this is the guy who slapped Babe Ruth at his confirmation. Can you get more American than that?\n\n“Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” (Winston Churchill in the House of Commons on Nov. 11, 1947)\n\nBesides, what I actually said (describing a heresy that I did not invent, after all, although I’ve been encouraged to revive it) was that 1) civics has a moral value in itself, and 2) that secular authority in a democracy has a moral power that the Church must accept. Neither of those are remotely like your odd, ahistorical misunderstanding of the point. That you keep distorting the idea that the Vatican has to recognize the moral power of secular authority into something grotesque does not indicate you’d handle an argument on even your weird terms well.\n\nIt’s important to realize that at the center of the Church’s alienation from its moral responsibilities in hiding criminal priests, is that it not only considers itself morally superior to the civil law in these matters, it considers the civil law to be essentially IMmoral — literally and precisely to the extent that it would be prosecuting priests and bishops.\n\nThat’s why the Americanist heresy cuts so close to the bone on this one. As Leo XIII said of everything modern in 1899: “Yet all this, to be of any solid benefit, nay, to have a real existence and growth, can only be on the condition of recognizing the wisdom and authority of the Church.”\n\nUnderstand THAT attitude, and it’s easy to see why something like two-thirds of all American bishops have been documented to have covered up crimes by the priests for whom they were responsible.\n\nAs for your distorted idea it’s worth arguing whether any democracy must be better than any other form of government: it’s a monumentally stoooopid formulation of a practical (not an abstract) set of questions.\n\nSeems a good time to make up a Rule: any argument that revolves entirely around definitions is circular.\n\nThat’s why I noted it’s legit to argue abstractions AS abstractions, or facts and history on their own terms, but it’s not legit to switch back and forth randomly, as you find “principle” or “practice” seems to fit what you want to say. It’s Calvinball, basically — and the score is always Aardvark to 13.\n\nAs an abstraction BB’s reasoning, such as it is, isn’t particularly complex, intellectually: to the extent a “democracy” like the Confederacy is immoral, it isn’t a “democracy”; while to the extent a “monarchy” (name some) is moral, it isn’t a “monarchy”.\n\nD’uh.\n\nThe reality is pretty elementary American civics, of course: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed…”\n\nBB seems to have skipped class that day, so perhaps it’s worth explaining it to him (maybe for the first time): Governments don’t GRANT rights. We are born with them.\n\nThat simple and damned revolutionary concept is what made America — because we are that rarest of things, a CONSERVATIVE revolution. The colonists originally sought only those rights as colonists, e.g., the right to tax themselves with their own representatives, that they would have had as Englishmen. But the Crown replied that they didn’t have those rights — because the Crown had not granted them.\n\nSo we made a revolution. We didn’t need the Crown to grant us rights.\n\nFrom the Vatican’s perspective, it is obvious why the whole enterprise is heretical: I quoted Leo XIII on the point: â€œYet all this, to be of any solid benefit, nay, to have a real existence and growth, can only be on the condition of recognizing the wisdom and authority of the Church.”\n\nI find the apologists for the Vatican and the Pope to be unpersuasive.\n\nThe Pope refuses to accept responsibility, either for his own actions or the actions of the church. Instead he is claiming to be a victim and that all the accusations are being made with malice.\n\nFirst that bit about ‘infallibility’. It is not the number of times that it has been used that is the issue, the doctrine itself is a blasphemy even if it had never been used at all.\n\nBesides being blasphemy, the assertion is absurd. There have been plenty of popes who have very clearly been amongst the most amoral, wicked people of their time. The idea that a human being can be infallible without being impeccable is just stupid and wrong. The doctrine of infallibility is a modern invention, prior to 1870 it was not dogma, it was merely a medieval form of brown-nosing for scholars who wanted to boost their chance of cannonisation. To the early church it would have been absurd, the bishop of Rome was not even first rank at the Council of Nicaea. The center of the early church was Greece, not Rome.\n\nIn the current crisis it is rather clear that the current Pope acted to protect the reputation of the church, knowing full well that his method of doing so would cause further harm to those who were already victims and ensure that more children became victims.\n\nIn particular, we have evidence that the current Pope issued instructions that the crimes were not to be made public and that anyone who did so was to be excommunicated. This document itself is a criminal obstruction of justice. The bishops were aware of a criminal offense and a likelihood that further offenses would be committed. Thus the Pope, the bishops and the church were accessories after the fact and before the fact.\n\nThe Pope’s instructions left the bishops with no choice but to obtain oaths of secrecy from the victims or to excommunicate them. Thus the Pope made the victims of the abuse co-conspirators with the church in perpetuating and facilitating the continuation of the abuse.\n\nThink of it from the victim’s point of view. First the church tells you that sexual thoughts and actions are sinful. Then a priest rapes you, most likely claiming to be doing so under the sanctity of the sacraments. You get up the courage to complain and the church and the bishop use a combination of moral pressure and threats to get you to be silent. Then you discover that by remaining silent you have become a co-conspirator with the church as your silence caused the rape of other children.\n\nRape is not merely a physical attack, it is a psychological attack and the primary damage is psychological. It is pretty hard to imagine circumstances that could lead to worse psychological damage than those that Pope Benedict played a major part in establishing.\n\nThere being little prospect of either a resignation or a removal, the Catholic church is going to find itself in the same position as Benedict’s native Austria did when their head of state turned out to be an embarassment.\n\nWhat may well be a bigger blow to the church is German Catholics refusing to pay the church tax.\n\nBB, you fit the cliche definition of a fanatic: redoubling your efforts when you’ve lost sight of your goal.\n\nThe theme of the thread is the moral and legal failings of the Catholic Church worldwide, including the United States, specifically regarding sexual crimes committed by priests against (mostly) kids, which were covered up by the heirarchy, all the way up to the current Pope.\n\nDerailing that because you want to argue whether the Confederacy was a democracy indicates a certain fascination with shiny objects on which perhaps you should consult a professional.\n\nF’r instance, when you’re not making flat-out errors (e.g., the Constitution does not mention slavery, as you claimed in 91), you keep asking, viz. 95: “how was the Confederacy not a democracy?” I’ve pointed out that you bounce back and forth from abstractions (which you get wrong) to history (in which your errors are worse): it’s Calvinball — and now you’re losing by the lopsided score of Oreos to eleventy-one.\n\nNevertheless, out of charity, I spoke to your abstract point, such as it is: to the extent a “democracy” like the Confederacy is immoral, it’s not a democracy; just as to the extent a “monarchy” is moral (name some), it’s not a monarchy.\n\nYou promptly confused this simple observation — again! — by insisting on several impossible and irrelevant things at once. So let’s just take the irrelevancies:\n\nI had noted the specific connection between the Roman Catholic Church’s institutional structure, and its doctrine. I also pointed out that this is directly related to the Americanist heresy, which I explained denotes, among other things, that the Vatican must acknowledge the moral power of secular authority in a democracy.\n\nYou promptly distorted that, and have continued to bend it to your twisted mind ever since. You’d do better to take real thinking straight, like good whiskey.\n\nThe classic formula for the separation of Church and State — which was formally rejected by the Vatican as late as 1854 — is Christ’s “render unto Caesar”. In the Gospel, this is generally (and properly) understood to be about idolatry and commerce, since the Pharisee who was trying to trap Christ asked him about whether it was legit for a Jew to use Roman money, as a religious matter.\n\nBut I noted it was ultimately a rationalization for slavery — Rome was a slave state, of course, and you will search in vain throughout the Bible for a moral condemnation of slavery, either as a legal institution or morally. (Slavery is advocated on several occasions in the Old Testament, particularly in Leviticus, and expected as a matter of course until the end of time in the New Testament.)\n\nMuch like the meaning of the Declaration of Independence, you seem to have missed the significance of that.\n\nThe honor of the first unequivocal, moral attack on slavery belongs to Patrick — who also happens to have been the first missionary to go outside of the Roman empire. The eventual abolition of slavery was religiously inspired (Wilberforce, the Quakers), but it was NOT carried out by an authoritarian religious structure, such as the Roman Church, or others require — again, for doctrinal reasons.\n\nAgain, you’d do better to take real thinking straight, on its own terms, rather than to constantly try to bend abstractions that are beyond your intellectual strength. It’s not just you, of course: Ajay also misses the plain language of the Declaration, that “to defend these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their JUST powers from the consent of the governed…” (emphasis added)\n\nBecause governments do not grant rights, We, the People — though sovereign — have no legitimate power to take away the rights that individuals are born with. Slavery is not, and can never be a legitimate exercise of popular sovereignty, any more than a legislature can repeal gravity or Canute could command the tide.\n\nDespite your transparent sophistry, BB, this is essentially a MORAL point, stated bluntly in the Declaration as self-evident. It’s because you keep skipping over the practical civics of the history that you have such trouble understanding where it led us. But it’s not like these are facts hidden from view.\n\nLegions of historians (notably Richard Ellis in Founding Brothers) have explored how the United States was founded first on the proposition that we are all equal (the Declaration), and then on its contradiction, the compromise with slavery that made us a nation in the Revolution and the Constitution.\n\nWhat I’ve been pointing out in this thread — kindly don’t skip over it this time — is that the resolution of that contradiction in the Civil War is directly related to the scandal confronting the Catholic Church, because of the Americanist heresy. See how focus works?\n\nCardinal Gibbon served as a Union chaplain (from a slave state, no less), so he knew from personal experience the moral power of preserving the Union BY abolishing slavery. With acolytes like Monsignor O’Connell (whose experience of the war including the burning and looting of his parish church in South Carolina), Gibbon was vividly aware that the American Catholic Church was the only American denomination that didn’t break up over slavery. That he championed Americanization — a term coined for the Catholic Church, and later applied to immigrants — took a moral and political courage that you’d do well to perceive, never mind appreciate. It is a very big deal for a Cardinal to be that close to a heresy.\n\nLike I said, the essence of the Americanist heresy is the notion that civics itself has a moral value: as demonstrated by the appalling price the Civil War exacted, in order to preserve the Union by abolition. The Americanist heresy includes the idea — specifically condemned by Leo XIII, whose view of the Vatican’s moral authority remains Benedict’s today — that the Papacy must acknowledge the moral power of secular authority in a democracy. That is what the Vatican has refused to do regarding criminal priests and the bishops who protected them.\n\nYou have deluded yourself that “the moral power of secular authority in a democracy” denotes the Confederacy. The history I have cited repeatedly demonstrates that it refers to the UNION, which abolished slavery.\n\nStrive to take real thinking straight. You can’t handle the fizzy stuff.\n\nPerhaps you didn’t notice it was a response to the way you keep bouncing back and forth between the abstractions by which you define terms, and actual examples. You might look up the word “reification”, which is the fancy way to describe your approach.\n\nBasically, you misunderstood — or distorted, take your pick — my observation that the Vatican should recognize the moral power of the secular authorities in a democracy. You seem to think this meant that ALL democracies, or ANY democracy, must be morally superior to any other conceivable form of government in any possible circumstance — the abstract example you cited was a “monarchy”, and the concrete one was the Confederacy, which you held up as an example of your abstract idea of “democracy”.\n\nI noted that what you were doing was definitively ahistorical — the actual example I had cited (the Americanist heresy), besides being relevant to the thread, also directly involved the Civil War in precisely the OPPOSITE way to your pitiful attempt to apply an abstraction to a series of real events. So my real example trumps your reification — see how it works? Like I said upthread, if you want to argue about abstractions by citing definitions — which is what the sophomoric “no true Scotsman” reasoning is about — you’ll just go in circles.\n\nSo I noted how it’s done: to the extent a “democracy” like the Confederacy is immoral, it’s not a “democracy”; to the extent a “monarchy” is moral (and I’ve invited you three times now to cite some examples), it’s not a “monarchy”.\n\nAnd you’ve promptly proven — and RE-proven my point that this is just circular, because you keep spiraling to argue about the definition, from which somehow, you can establish that an evil regime like the Confederacy is, so! a “democracy”, which (you argue) by definition, must prove… something.\n\nYou’d be better taking real thinking straight, without trying to bend reality to abstractions: your intellect is clearly not strong enough.\n\nIt WOULD be a good thing if the Vatican’s response to the global scandal of bishops, cardinals and now a Pope’s clear conspiracy to protect — hell, assist! — criminals while covering up their crimes, was to acknowledge the moral power of secular authority in democracy.\n\nWhy you are disputing this, much less your method of dispute (which is as baffling as Calvinball), I dunno.\n\nUm, hix: you HAVE heard about this scandal? It’s not like it’s new: consider how the Church directed Catholics to SECRETLY handle such cases back in 1962 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis\n\nRatzinger was personally involved in a number of cases, both in Germany while he was an Archbishop, and in at least one US case after he went to the Vatican. Hell, even the Curia doesn’t try to deny those facts.\n\nHow can you be unaware of ’em?\n\nYour bizarre notion that it is anti-Catholic to report the facts, even as you insist that the Church is somehow capable of preventing a coverup from ever reaching Vatican City, is just ignorant.\n\nWhat’s happened is clearly the opposite: in hundreds, if not thousands of cases, local Catholic authorities chose to resist all efforts to turn criminal priests over to civil prosecutors. In most cases, this was done by direct intimidation of witnesses. As noted upthread (and, in a somewhat uninformed way, it was the central point of Henry’s post itself), most organizations are structured and organized to prevent a scandal like this from ever getting too far up the food chain. In fact, in a healthy heirarchy one of the best ways to get promoted is to be the mid-level guy who realizes that something can’t be covered up, so you fix it. The organization’s reputation takes the hit, and then you move on.\n\nBut not the Roman Catholic Church. Its structure is too closely identified with its doctrines — the Mystical Body of Christ, after all — to be sufficiently nimble. That’s why I noted the relationship all this has to the Americanist heresy: the Church has historically held that it can NOT acknowledge the moral power of secular authority. That’s precisely why there are documents proving beyond any reasonable doubt that the cover up in every local case was not only authorized, it was REQUIRED by the heirarchy, e.g., Crimen sollicitationis.\n\nThere is documented evidence that Ratzinger personally ordered bishops and parish priests alike to carry out this policy, with his own, personal, infamous directive at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that their primary responsibility in criminal cases involving sexual abuse by priests was to defend the Church’s reputation.\n\nHow come you don’t know that? It’s been in all the papers."
