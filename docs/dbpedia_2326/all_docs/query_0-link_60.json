        "text": "George Bennett (or Bennet) worked as printer, bookseller and stationer opposite Broad Lane on Main Street from about 1715 until 1743. In 1731 he married Elizabeth Buchanan, daughter of Elizabeth, and John Buchanan, gent, deceased, possibly his second marriage (PROI, Marriage licence bonds, Diocese of Cork and Ross; Registry of Deeds, ROD 68-96-47173, 21 Aug 1731). Their children were baptised at Christ Church / Holy Trinity: John on 12 August 1733, Elizabeth on 8 December 1734, and Martha on 9 May 1736 (RCBI. Parish register of Holy Trinity, Cork, P.527/1/2). George may have had an earlier family, two children were baptised in Holy Trinity a decade before, Mary Ann, daughter of George Bennett (19 Apr 1724), and Edward, son of Coun. Bennett (2 June 1725) (RCBI. Parish register of Holy Trinity, Cork, P.527/1/2). George died in August 1743, leaving a young family (Faulkner’s Dublin Journal, 23 Aug 1743).One of his daughters died in 1750 from the bite of a mad cat (Belfast News Letter, 17 Apr 1750). In 1758 John Bennett, referred to as his only son, was admitted a freeman at large of Cork city (Caulfield 1876, p. 714).\n\nJohn Rocque, Map of Cork city, 1759, detail showing Main Street and Broad Lane.\n\nA member of the Anglican Church of Ireland, Bennett was a prominent member of the administration in Cork city during the first half of the eighteenth century. He was a councillor of the corporation from at least 1722, and alderman from 1725, acting as sheriff in 1722-1723 and mayor in 1724-1725 (Caulfield 1876). The corporation was made up of numerous aldermen, as they were persons who had previously served as mayor (Windele 1839). Bennett was alderman of the third ward, which comprised the north east quarter of the city; this included Castle Street with its important exchange (tholsel) and courthouse buildings (Caulfield 1876, p. 562). As an alderman he had a key role to play within the corporation, responsible for the management of the city’s lands and properties, reporting on building and maintenance of the city quays and bridges, organizing repair of the bells of the exchange and the courthouse, examining the accounts of various officers, inspecting markets, reporting on street cleaning, lighting and bringing fresh water to the city. With other council members he oversaw the erection of the famous dragon on the copula of the exchange in 1734 (Caulfield 1876, p. 531). He served as Justice of the Peace for Cork city and county.\n\nEngraving of The Exchange, Cork, showing the dragon on the copula, from Charles Smith, The antient and present state of the county and city of Cork, 1750.\n\nBookselling:\n\nIn the early years of the eighteenth century George Bennett was one of a small number of printers and booksellers active in the city, Dix notes Bennett as the earliest named Cork printer of the eighteenth century (Dix 1921-24). The most prominent printer booksellers in Cork were Andrew Welsh (1716-1739) and John Redwood (1715-1723) with their bookshops in Castle Street, near the exchange, and Samuel Terry (1721-1722) in Cock Pit Lane. Merchants, such as Samuel Wilson (1711-1723) and William Ray (1719), also sold books as part of the general stock. By 1725 Bennett was referred to as ‘the leading bookseller in the city of Cork’ (Munter 1988; Dublin Weekly Intelligence, 17 Apr 1725). At his bookshop opposite Broad Lane Bennett acted as subscription and sales agent for various Dublin printers. Three religious works of Cork interest by Rev. Rowland Davies, dean of Ross and afterwards dean of Cork, were printed by Samuel Fairbrother, bookseller in Skinner Row, Dublin, in 1716 and 1720: Christian loyalty, set forth in a sermon preach’d in the cathedral church of Cork, on the thirtieth day of January, Anno Dom. 1715 and The truly Catholick and old religion in 1716, and Remarks on a pamphlet entituled, Goliath beheaded by his own sword in 1720. The imprints name George Bennett and John Redwood, booksellers in Cork, as sellers of the works in 1716 and Bennett alone in 1720. On his own account Bennett had printed another sermon by Rev. Davies in 1717, The right use of riches. In 1718 and 1719 he was subscription agent for Rev. Richard Fiddes, A body of divinity, first published in London and reprinted in Dublin by John Hyde, George Grierson, and Richard Gunne, they were prepared to go to press as soon as 200 names were pledged (Pue’s Occurrences, 19-22 Jul 1718; Dublin Intelligence, 14 Nov 1719). The first volume, Theologia speculativa: or, the first part of a body of divinity was published in 1718 and the second, Theologia practica, in 1720, and Bennett is listed as a subscriber. In folio format, the volumes were issued in large and small paper sizes, each volume priced at 10s.10d. in large paper, and 8s.8d. in smaller paper to subscribers, half to be paid when subscribing (Pue’s Occurrences, 19-22 Jul 1718; Dublin Intelligence, 14 Nov 1719). In 1719 he was subscription agent for Humphrey Prideaux, The old and new testament connected in the history of the Jews, printed in Dublin by Aaron Rhames for a group of booksellers, and he subscribed to four copies for sale in his shop. It was printed in folio format with plates and maps, the price to subscribers was 12 British shillings (13s. Irish) bound in calf, half to be paid in advance, the cost would rise to 18s.6d. to non-subscribers (Dublin Courant, 31 Jan 1718/19; Pue’s Occurrences, 24-28 Feb 1718/19).\n\nRowland Davies, Christian loyalty (1716), title page; A tutor to arithmetic (1719), title page; Hercules Rowley, An answer to a book (1721), title page.\n\nBy the late 1720s and early 1730s the number of booksellers in the city rose, as Combra Daniel (1723-1734) and Thomas Pilkington (1728-1743) began business in the 1720s, followed by George Harrison (1733-1754), Daniel Hood (1734-d.1792) and Cornelius Sullivan (1736-d.1767) in the 1730s, all clustered around Main Street and Castle Street. This presupposed an increase in the market for books, and readers interested in new publications and willing to spend on printed materials. Advertising at this period was scarce, evidence for Cork booksellers is mostly gleaned from Dublin newspapers and those Dublin booksellers who had connections to their Cork counterparts, but subscriptions to books point to co-operation more than rivalry among Cork’s booksellers. At this time Bennett was subscription agent for a range of substantial titles from Dublin booksellers, many in expensive folio format. In 1720 he acted as subscription agent for The works of Richard Allestree, printed in Dublin for Patrick Dugan (Dublin Intelligence, 5 Nov 1720). The folio volume in seven parts came out in 1723 and George Bennett subscribed to twelve sets. In the same year he was agent for Geoffrey Keating, The general history of Ireland, printed in Dublin by James Carson in folio with engraved plates and coats of arms (Dublin Intelligence, 12 Jan 1722/3). He was agent for George Grierson’s printing of volume one of the third edition of Louis Ellies Du Pin, A new history of ecclesiastical writers in 1722 (Dublin Courant, 1 Oct 1722). This was a folio volume with plates, the first of three published between 1722 and 1724, with volume one reissued in 1723 with a new title page. Bennett took subscriptions for another Grierson publication in 1724. Proposals were issued for A master key to Popery by Antonio Gavin, the work to comprise about 400 pages in large octavo, priced at one British crown (5s.5d. Irish) bound in calf, half to be paid in advance (Dublin Courant, 1 Feb 1723/4; 21 Apr 1724). Rev. Gilbert Burnet, Bishop Burnet’s history of his own time was printed in two volumes folio by Aaron Rhames for a group of Dublin booksellers in 1724 and 1734. Bennett subscribed to seven copies of the first volume and six copies of the second. Volume one was priced at 18s. bound, and anyone subscribing to seven copies would get the eighth gratis The cost was reduced to 16s. bound as the project progressed and the text took fewer sheets than envisaged (Dublin Courant, 28 Dec 1723; 16 May 1724). Volume two was priced at 14s. in sheets, and Combra Daniel and Thomas Pilkington in Cork are named as subscription agents (Dublin Journal, 26 Jan 1733). In 1725 Bennett took subscriptions for James Watts’ Dublin printing for bookseller John Chantry of Noel Chomel’s Dictionaire oeconomique, revised and recommended by Richard Bradley. The cost to subscribers was £1.10s. compared to £2.12s. for the London edition (Dublin Weekly Journal, 16 Oct 1725; 20 Nov 1725). The two volume folio edition, bound and lettered, was published in 1727 and Bennett took six sets for sale in his bookshop.\n\nIn 1726 Bennett subscribed to 25 copies of Daniel Defoe’s The complete English tradesman in octavo, first printed in London and reprinted in Dublin by George Ewing. The cost to subscribers was a British half crown neatly bound and lettered, compared to 5s.6d. for the London edition, 13d. was requested in advance and the rest on delivery (Dublin Weekly Journal, 4 Feb 1725/6; 22 Oct 1726). An advertisement for Thomas Vernon’s Cases argued and adjudged in the High Court of Chancery in June 1726 advised subscribers that the volume would be larger than advertised, rising from 100 sheets to about 140 sheets, and the cost would rise from two crowns in sheets to 13s. in sheets, a British crown to be paid on subscribing (Dublin Weekly Journal, 18 Jun 1726). It was reprinted in Dublin from the London edition by James Watts for bookseller John Chantry in two volumes folio, the first in October 1726 and the second in 1729, and subscriptions were taken by George Bennett in Cork (Dublin Weekly Journal, 1 Oct 1726). Bennett worked with George Grierson, King’s printer in Dublin, on the publication of Cork physician, Dr Edward Barry’s A treatise on a consumption of the lungs in 1726, a single volume octavo, advertised as sold by Grierson and G. Bennett in Cork (Dublin Weekly Journal, 9 Jul 1726). He subscribed to seven copies of John Laurence, A new system of agriculture. Being a complete body of husbandry and gardening printed in Dublin by John Hyde and Eliphal Dobson for Richard Gunne and Robert Owen in 1727. This was a prestigious work in folio format with engraved plates, costing 13s. bound, half to be paid on subscribing (Dublin Weekly Journal, 31 July 1726). The same year he subscribed to 31 copies of Tables of exchange, printed for Dublin bookseller John Watson, by John Gowan. Compiled by Watson, this guide to exchange rates for English and Irish currency, in handy duodecimo size, was valuable for merchants and traders. Proposals were published in 1727 by John Chantry for printing by subscription The works of Sir William Temple by Rev. Jonathan Swift in two volumes folio bound and lettered for £1.6s., with Alderman Bennett as one of the subscription agents (Dublin Weekly Journal, 24 Jun 1727). The publisher was willing to go to press when 100 subscriptions were pledged, but this project does not seem to have gone ahead (ESTC online).\n\nThe state of the Protestants, written by William King, late Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin, was printed by subscription by Samuel Powell for George Risk, George Ewing and William Smith in Dublin in 1730. Thomas Pilkington and Combra Daniel were agents for the publication in Cork, but Bennett also subscribed to six copies for sale. It was priced at four British shillings (4s.4d. Irish) neatly bound in calf, half to be paid on subscribing. Bennett acted as subscription agent for Dublin bookseller George Faulkner when he published the first collection of the Works of Jonathan Swift in four volumes octavo in 1735. Faulkner’s advertisement in January 1733/4 names Bennett as the Cork agent (Faulkner’s Dublin Journal, 22 Jan 1733/4). This renowned set of Swift’s Works was ‘printed on fine Genoa paper, and beautiful new Dutch type’, the cost to subscribers was 4s.4d. per volume, half the total cost (8s.8d.) to be paid in advance. Non subscribers could expect to pay the larger sum of one guinea when the work was completed. George Bennett subscribed to 16 sets of the edition for sale in his bookshop. In 1762 Alderman George Bennett is again listed as a subscriber for 16 sets of Faulkner’s edition of Swift’s Works in 11 volumes in small format octodecimo (18mo). This is certainly an error as Bennett had died nearly twenty years earlier in 1743 and no other Alderman George Bennett is a member of the council at this time; his name must have carried over from the original list.\n\nFaulkner’s Dublin Journal, 26 Feb 1733/4, advertisement for Swift’s Works; Jonathan Swift, Works, volume IV, 1735, title page.\n\nJohn K’Eogh’s Botanalogia universalis Hibernica was a Cork publication, printed in quarto format by George Harrison in 1735 and Bennett subscribed to it. In 1737 he was subscription agent for The military history of Eugene of Savoy, printed in Dublin for Philip Crampton, and he subscribed to 14 sets for sale. He was Crampton’s agent in Cork for the English translation of François Rabelais, Works (Dublin News Letter, 23-26 Jul 1737; Faulkner’s Dublin Journal, 24 Sep 1737). Rabelais’ Works was advertised in three volumes in pocket sized duodecimo, bound and lettered, for the cost of three British half crowns, one half crown to be paid in advance. Crampton was willing to go to press when one hundred purchasers had subscribed. It finally came to four volumes duodecimo (Dublin, 1738). The same year, 1738, he was subscription agent for the fourth edition of Samuel Clarke’s One hundred and seventy three sermons on several subjects printed in Dublin for Risk, Ewing, Smith, Crampton and Faulkner in five volumes octavo (Faulkner’s Dublin Journal, 1-5 Aug 1738). William Doyle, hydrographer, published a twenty page pamphlet, A letter to every well-wisher of trade and navigation, printed in Dublin by Richard Reilly, for the author, in 1739. Bennett is named in the advertisement on the first leaf of the pamphlet for ‘The map of Waterford Harbour and Tramore-Bay (where several shipwrecks have lately happened)’ selling at 18d. per map. He acted as subscription agent in 1740 for The genuine works of Flavius Josephus printed in Dublin by George Ewing (Reilly’s Dublin News-Letter, 13-16 Dec 1740). In 1741 he was subscription agent for The Gardener’s dictionary by Philip Miller, the fifth edition in folio illustrated with copper plates, printed in Dublin by Samuel Powell for a group of booksellers (Reilly’s Dublin News Letter, 12-16 May, 1741). Miller was the renowned gardener to the Worshipful Company of Apothecaries at their botanic garden in Chelsea in London, and the volume was dedicated to Sir Hans Sloan and members of the Royal Society of London. The dictionary had proved a best seller in its earlier editions and was a standard text for gardeners and estate owners.\n\nThe sale of patent medicines was a valuable addition to the range of books and stationery items sold by booksellers during the eighteenth century. Certain Dublin booksellers acted as agents for potions and remedies, patented in London or elsewhere, the sale of which was licensed out to apothecaries and booksellers in the country towns. The medicines were accompanied by printed instructions and sometimes by recommendations by well known persons. In 1739 Bennett was agent for a pamphlet entitled An account of the success of Mrs Stephens’s medicine for the stone, with the case of the Rev. James Kilpatrick, Doctor of Divinity, M. D. It was printed in Dublin, for George Grierson, Risk, Ewing and Smith, and George Faulkner, as well as George Bennett in Cork, William Farrier in Limerick, and William Winnet in Waterford (Dublin News Letter, 12-15 May 1739).\n\nFaulkner’s Dublin Journal, 24 Sept 1737, advertisement for Rabelais’ Works; William Doyle, A letter to every well-wisher of trade and navigation (1739), advertisement.\n\nBennett supplied books and printing services to Cork Corporation, which included the provision of acts of parliament and prayer books for the use of the council. In February 1718/19 Mr Wilson was asked to subscribe to 300 bibles printed in Dublin, to be paid for from the funds of the Blue Coat Hospital. This was the octavo Holy bible, printed in 1722 by Aaron Rhames for a group of Dublin booksellers, sponsored by the Society for Promoting Charity Schools in Ireland and ready to be delivered to subscribers in sheets in July 1723 (ESTC online; Dublin Courant, 6 Jul 1723). In August of 1723, 234 unbound bibles in sheets were delivered to Cork, and Mr Wilson and Mr Bennett were requested to get them bound (Caulfield 1876, pp 404, 433). Mr Wilson is likely to be Samuel Wilson, who served with George Bennett on the common council, acting as sheriff in 1709-1710. He was a merchant who also traded in books. It is not clear if the bookbinding was carried out in workshops run by Bennett or Wilson, but more likely they contracted the work out to other binders, as in November 1723 Combra Daniel was paid £8.12s.6d. for binding 230 bibles for the corporation (Caulfield 1876, p. 434). In December 1724 the binding was completed and every member of the council was given a number of bibles to distribute ‘to such charitable uses as they see fit’ (Caulfield 1876, p. 449). In November 1727 Bennett was requested to supply seven folio prayer books for members of the corporation for use in church, three of which were to be bound in gilt for the mayor’s cushion. The following May 1728 he was paid £7.9s. for several acts of parliament and the seven prayer books, three of which were bound in Turkey leather (Caulfield 1876, pp 474, 477). In May 1733 he was paid £4.14s.4d. for acts of parliament and abridgements, and in January 1738/9 he was paid £2.8s.1d. for books for the corporation (Caulfield 1876, pp 521, 581). He was paid £2.6s. in 1738 for a Common Prayer book, a bible, and a clean paper book for the use of the city gaol (Caulfield 1876, p. 575). He supplied another four large prayer books for the mayor’s gallery in September 1741, and in January 1742/3 he was paid £3.17s.1d. for books and printing for the corporation (Caulfield 1876, pp 612, 616).\n\nPrinting:\n\nBennett’s printing output was confined mainly to works of local interest and religious content. He was certainly a jobbing printer producing printed materials for the administration and businesses. The first mention of Bennett’s printing work is a single issue of a periodical, The Idler. By Anonimous Nobody, Esq., no. 1, dated 1 February 1714 (i.e. 1715 as the new year began on 25 March according to the Julian calendar then in use). He is credited with printing the one surviving issue of a Cork edition of The Free-holder, no. XXIV, Thursday 31 May 1716 (Ó Casaide n.d., pp 10-11). A twice-weekly periodical mainly devoted to political essays, The Free-holder, written and edited by Joseph Addison, was originally printed in London in 1715 and 1716. A reprint was issued in Dublin by George Grierson on Mondays and Fridays from 23 December 1715 (no. 1) to 29 June 1716 (no. 55), the Cork printing may be based on the Dublin reprint but the numbering system and dating is different. He is also associated with the publication of The Cork News Letter newspaper, one extant copy dates to 1723, but it is estimated that it started about 1715 or 1716 (Madden 1867, ii, p. 167; Caulfield 1905; Dix 1921-24). John Windele saw the 1723 issue in the 1830s, but it does not appear in modern library holdings (Madden 1867; Newsplan online; ESTC online).\n\nHe carried out printing work for Cork Corporation, but from the monies paid this seems to have been quite small scale and was probably confined to printing notices and proclamations. In September 1734 the council ordered ‘for the future that Ald. George Bennett shall print what will be wanted for the corporation, and that said Bennett be paid £2.6s.6d. for printing in Ald. Croker’s mayoralty (1732-33)’, On 7 October 1738 he was ordered to print five quires of paper to publish a proclamation setting out the weights of corn, potatoes and salt as per acts of parliament. In January 1742/3 he was paid £3.17s.1d. for books and printing (Caulfield 1876, pp 536, 579, 616). On 28 September 1747 the corporation ordered that ‘£4.1s.2½d. be paid for printing-work done by Ald. Bennett, in the mayoralty of Ald. Fuller (1739-40), and that £2.6s.4½d. printing done by said Bennett in the mayoralty of Ald. Parker (1740-41), to the executors of said Bennett’ (Caulfield 1876, p. 645).\n\nHaving been sales agent for Dublin bookseller, Samuel Fairbrother’s, printing of two pamphlets by Rev. Rowland Davies, dean of Cork, in 1716, and a third in 1720, Bennett printed a sermon by Rev. Davies in 1717, The right use of riches. A sermon preach’d in the parish church of St Peter’s, Corke, on Sunday, August the 11th 1717. This was a fund raising sermon in support of the ‘poor children educated in the Green-coat charity schools of the parish of St Mary, Shandon’. The 44 page text in octavo format consisted of the 24 page sermon followed by a short account of the Green-coat charity schools, founded in 1716, and includes a list of religious books available in the school library (pp 30-32). In 1719 he printed A tutor to arithmetick by J. B., a Cork teacher; this was printed for the author, who is likely to have part financed the production. In 1720 he printed Boyle Davies, A sermon preached at St Peter’s church in the city of Corke, on the twenty ninth day of September, being the anniversary of the surrender of that city to … King William … in 1690. This sermon, comprising 16 pages in quarto format, was aimed at a loyalist audience.\n\nIn 1721 he did a reprint of An answer to a book intitl’d Reasons offer’d for erecting a bank in Ireland. In a letter to H. Maxwell, Esq., by Hercules Rowley, M.P. Henry Maxwell’s octavo pamphlet went into two editions, and he followed with a second letter, all printed in Dublin by Aaron Rhames in 1721. The answering pamphlet by Hercules Rowley was published in Dublin by George Grierson, and reprinted in Cork by George Bennett. In the same year Bennett printed two sermons, Rev. Arthur d’Huvers, King George’s title asserted. In a sermon preach’d at Cloynpriest, in the diocese of Cloyne; on the first day of August, 1721 and Richard Davies, Repentance our best preservative against plague, in a sermon preached at Bantry, on Friday, the twenty third day of December 1721. Rev Davies’ sermon was delivered the year after the outbreak of a deadly epidemic, the last major occurrence of bubonic plague in Europe, which broke out in Marseilles in May 1720 and ravaged the city and surrounding area over the next two years. In 1722 Bennett printed Zachary Pearce, A letter to the clergy of the Church of England, and a broadside entitled Undeniable reasons for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act and securing traytors, etc. dated 10th Novr. 1722. In 1723 he printed The blunderful blunder of blunders. Being an answer to The wonderful wonder of wonders. This four page quarto pamphlet is sometimes attributed to Jonathan Swift, but it was possibly written by Thomas Sheridan. It was printed in London in 1721 with a Dublin printing about 1722. In 1727 he printed a 24 page sermon by Rev John Tillotson, The hazard of being saved in the church of Rome.\n\nFaulkner’s Dublin Journal, 23 Aug 1743, death notice for George Bennett.\n\nBennett died on 9 August 1743 ‘at an advanced age, George Bennet Esq., Alderman of the Ward, and one of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the city and county of Corke, a gentleman of exceeding good character’ (Faulkner’s Dublin Journal, 23 Aug 1743). His last attendance at a council meeting was on 21 July 1743, less than three weeks before his death (Caulfield 1876, pp 620, 645). On 12 September there was an election for his position as alderman of the ward, and Alderman Ambrose Jackson was elected (Faulkner’s Dublin Journal, 17 Sep 1743).\n\nGeorge Bennett was a prominent businessman in Cork city in the first half of the eighteenth century, carrying on a lucrative trade in books and playing his part in the administration of the city. He was a member of the established church and a loyalist in politics. His children were young when he died in 1743, and none of his family took over the business. His son, John, was made a freeman in 1758, when he was aged 25, but the printing and bookselling business was no longer in existence.\n\nIn his early career the book trade was small scale outside of Dublin, and life for printers and booksellers could be precarious, often requiring them to move from place to place before settling. By the mid 1740s, at the end of his career, printing and bookselling were on a firm footing in the city and many thriving businesses could work side by side. Co-operation with Dublin printers and booksellers was an important part of the trade, lessening the financial risk when investing in expensive works. Bookselling was not specialized in the first decades of the century and merchants carried books as part of their general stock. An increase in trade can be discerned from the 1720s with new businesses entering the market and managing to survive for years or decades. At this period too the book trade was polarized, divided into the cheap and cheerful chapbook, ballad sheet, pamphlet, religious and devotional text market, and the luxury market, where books, often in multiple volumes, printed in large format, sometimes with engravings or maps, cost large sums of money. For luxury volumes subscription editions made financial sense for printers and for purchasers. George Bennett traded successfully for thirty years, working at the high end of the market as can be seen from the range of titles that he offered for sale.\n\nReferences:\n\nCaulfield, Richard (ed.), 1876.

Bolster, 1839).\n\nThe business of Thomas (1728-1743) and Martha (1743-1757) Pilkington offers a perspective into the trade in books and stationery in early eighteenth century Cork. Situated in the heart of the city in Castle Street near the Tholsel, which housed the merchants’ Exchange at street level, the city court house, and the council chamber on the upper storey, and close to the county court house and the Exchange coffee house, their bookshop supplied the needs of merchants and the administration as well as citizens of the city and county. A marriage recorded in 1718 between Thomas Pilkington and Martha Bernard is likely to be theirs, although no occupation is recorded so it is not verified (Gillman 1896). On 1 September 1723, Richard Pilkington, son of Thomas Pilkington, was baptized in Holy Trinity church, possibly their son (RCBI, P.527/1/2, parish register of Holy Trinity, Cork). They formed part of the Anglican Protestant business community, which dominated the running of the city at the period. Their religious affiliation can be discerned in the book stock they carried and in the publications printed by Martha, which included sermons, pastoral letters, a Protestant catechism and other religious titles. Martha took over the business about 1743, probably after Thomas’s death. Her political stance was loyalist, with sermons and pamphlets in opposition to the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, when Charles Edward Stuart attempted to gain the throne of Great Britain, featuring among her publications.\n\nJohn Rocque, Map of Cork city, 1759, detail showing Castle Street.\n\nEdward Lloyd estimated the population of Cork at 40,000 in the 1730s, with about 5,000 houses in the city (Lloyd 1732). Many of the houses in the city and suburbs were newly built and ‘the shops neatly fitted, and many of them well sorted with rich goods’. The port of Cork and the safe deep-water harbour gave the city an advantage for foreign trade, especially to the Americas. The provision of meat, fish and butter to stock ocean-going shipping created a wealthy commercial sector. In the first decades of the eighteenth century the book trade in Cork was limited, with some local printing and bookselling, and access to printed materials through Dublin and London. The most important booksellers in the city in the 1730s and 1740s were George Bennett (1715-d.1747), alderman of the council and lord mayor of Cork in 1724, with his business on Main Street, opposite Broad Lane; Combra Daniel (1723-1734), opposite the Main Guard in Castle Street; George Harrison (1733-1754) at the corner of Meetinghouse Lane; Daniel Hood (1734-d.1792), opposite the Main Guard; and Cornelius Sullivan (1736-d.1767), under the Exchange coffee house, Castle Street. The earliest Cork newspapers, such as The Freeholder (1716) or Cork News Letter (pre-1720-c.1725), contained little local news or advertisements. News, official notices and current affairs were provided by newspapers from Dublin and London, with parliamentary proceedings and votes of parliament imported from London. By mid century The Corke Journal, printed by George Swiney from 1754, and The Corke Evening Post, published by Phineas and George Bagnell from 1755, were more typical of provincial newspapers, carrying local news and advertising.\n\nThomas Pilkington (1728-1743):\n\nThomas Pilkington was primarily a bookseller and stationer, with little printing output until his later years. Evidence for his trade comes mainly from subscriptions to books printed in Dublin and London, and some advertising. Newspaper advertising is scant for his early career due to the paucity of locally printed newspaper titles and the poor survival of issues. He was sometimes listed as subscription agent for books advertised in the Dublin newspapers by the undertaking bookseller. Acting as agent for a title involved advertising it locally, taking names of purchasers, collecting subscription fees, and ensuring delivery of the finished work. The agent often subscribed to multiple copies of a book for sale to non-subscribers in his or her bookshop. One advertisement for Thomas Pilkington appears at the end of Edward Lloyd’s A description of the flourishing city of Corke, printed in Cork by Andrew Welsh for the author in 1732. He advertised his book stock ‘in most faculty’s’, as well as account books, paper and stationery by wholesale and retail. He stated that he wrote to London every month for the ‘newest books to accommodate gentlemen with’. As an example he highlighted Augustin Calmet’s Dictionary of the bible in three volumes with over 160 engraved copper plates, published in London in 1732, and Complete collection of state trials in six volumes, this collection was printed in London in 1730 (Lloyd 1732). In 1732 he subscribed to the London edition of John Churchill’s A collection of voyages and travels in six volumes folio, illustrated with maps.\n\nEdward Lloyd, A description of the flourishing city of Corke (Cork, 1732), advertisement.\n\nThomas Pilkington’s business was in existence by at least 1728. He had a strong working relationship with the printing alliance of George Risk, George Ewing and William Smith, booksellers in Dublin, and his earliest subscriptions were to their publications. In 1728 he is listed as a subscriber to their edition of Richard Steele and Joseph Addison’s Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff, followed in 1729 by T. Sherlock’s Tryal of the witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus, Ben Jonson’s Plays in two volumes, John Gay’s Poems, and in 1730 William King’s The state of the Protestants of Ireland and Alain René Le Sage’s Gil Blas. In their advertisement for Jonson’s Plays, offered for one British crown (5s.5d. Irish) in two volumes duodecimo, neatly bound in calf leather with gilt spine, Daniel Combra and Thomas Pilkington are named as subscription agents in Cork (Dublin Intelligence, 22 Feb 1728/9). Pilkington is listed for six copies each of Jonson’s Plays and Gay’s Poems, these multiple copies were for open sale in his bookshop and not for subscribers, whose individual names would be included in the subscription lists. In another advertisement of 1729 he and Combra Daniel are named as subscription agents for the Dublin reprint of Tryal of the witnesses and the forthcoming State of the Protestants (Dublin Intelligence, 13 Sep 1729). The state of the Protestants, written by William King, late Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin, was a substantial work likely to sell well, proposals for printing it by subscription were published at the end of Tryal of the witnesses in 1729, and Pilkington is given as one of the subscription agents. Printed by Samuel Powell for Risk, Ewing and Smith, it was priced at four British shillings (4s.4d. Irish) neatly bound in calf, half to be paid on subscribing. In 1732 he subscribed to Philip Miller’s illustrated folio edition of The gardener’s dictionary, printed in Dublin from the London edition by S. Powell for a group of booksellers including Risk, Ewing and Smith. Miller was gardener to the botanic garden in Chelsea in London and a fellow of the Royal Society, his substantial dictionary proved popular with the aristocracy and higher clergy, gentlemen, land and estate owners, as can be seen from its subscription list. It was in its fifth edition when it was again reprinted by the Dublin booksellers in 1741, and Thomas Pilkington was subscription agent for it (Reilly’s Dublin News Letter, 12-16 May 1741).\n\nPilkington was subscription agent for the second volume of Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, History of his own time, printed in Dublin by Aaron Rhames for a group of Dublin booksellers in 1734. It was priced at 14s. in sheets, and could be ordered from Combra Daniel and Thomas Pilkington in Cork, and William Farrier in Limerick (Dublin Journal, 26 Jan 1733). He subscribed to seven copies of Joseph Rogers, Essay on epidemic diseases printed in Dublin by Samuel Powell for William Smith in 1734. In 1736 he was subscription agent for Charles Rollin’s The ancient history of the Egyptians, originally printed in London, and reprinted in Dublin for Risk, Ewing and Smith in 12 volumes octavo, with engraved maps (Dublin Journal, 7-10 Sep 1736). Two volumes were to be published each month, the full set to be completed by the end of the year. In their advertisement for volumes one to eight they named Pilkington and Daniel Hood in Cork as subscription agents (Dublin Evening Post, 16-19 Oct 1736). The cost to subscribers was forty shillings in half binding, 7s.6d. to be paid in advance, and a British half crown at the delivery of each volume. They reprinted it in smaller format, 13 volumes duodecimo, from 1738 to 1740 and Thomas Pilkington was a subscriber. He was subscription agent for Jean-Baptiste Du Halde, The general history of China, advertised by Dublin bookseller Stearne Brock in 1736 (Dublin Journal, 18-24 Dec 1736; Dublin News Letter, 1-4 Jan 1736/7; Dublin Daily Advertiser, 5 Jan 1736/7). No copy of the Dublin edition has survived (ESTC online), but Brock’s death in November 1737 may have meant that the project was never completed (Dublin Gazette, 26 Nov 1737). An edition was published in London in four volumes octavo in 1736 and in two volumes folio in 1738, illustrated with maps, portraits and music. He was one of three Cork booksellers acting as subscription agent for The works of Virgil, translated by Joseph Trapp, D. D., reprinted from the London edition in 1737 by Risk, Ewing and Smith in three volumes duodecimo, with plates and title pages in red and black. The cost to subscribers was 6s.6d., half to be paid in advance (Dublin News Letter, 12-16 Feb 1736/7). In 1737 he subscribed to The military history of the late Prince Eugene of Savoy printed in Dublin by Philip Crampton. In the same year he was subscription agent for Samuel Clarke, Paraphrase on the four evangelists, in two volumes octavo, the eighth edition printed in Dublin from the London edition by Edward Exshaw, and selling for 8s.8d. Subscriptions were taken by Thomas Pilkington, Francis Bridges, Cornelius Sullivan in Cork, and William Farrier in Limerick, among other provincial booksellers (Dublin Journal, 11 Jun, 1737; Dublin Evening Post, 28 Jun – 2 Jul 1737). The following year, 1738, he was subscription agent for Samuel Clarke’s One hundred and seventy three sermons, the fourth edition in five volumes octavo, printed in Dublin for Risk, Ewing and Smith, Philip Crampton and George Faulkner (Dublin Journal, 1-5 Aug 1738).\n\nDublin Daily Advertiser, 5 Jan 1736/7, proposals for printing by subscription Du Halde, History of China. John Locke, A paraphrase and notes on the epistles of St Paul (Dublin, 1738), advertisement leaf.\n\nIn 1738 Pilkington subscribed to 12 copies of Joseph Harrison’s A scriptural exposition of the church catechism printed in Dublin by Sylvanus Pepyat, and 14 sets of Jeremiah Collier’s Reflections upon ridicule, the fifth edition printed in Dublin by Richard Reilly for C. Connor and Oli. Nelson. He was subscription agent for Edward Exshaw’s edition of Rev. John Tillotson’s Two hundred sermons and discourses on several occasions. The advertisement was dated 23 Dec 1738, and published in John Locke’s A paraphrase and notes on the epistles of St Paul printed in Dublin by Exshaw in 1738. Subscriptions were taken by Thomas Pilkington and Cornelius Sullivan in Cork, William Farrier in Limerick, William Winnet in Waterford as well as booksellers in Belfast, Derry and Newry. The work was intended to match the first volume of sermons, already published, and was to consist of one volume in folio format to cost £1.7s. neatly bound and lettered, a half guinea to be paid in advance. It was published the following year (1739) as The works of the Most Rev. Dr John Tillotson in three volumes octavo. At the end of 1738 a new edition of The works of Shakespeare with notes by Mr Theobald in seven volumes duodecimo was advertised by John Smith and Abraham Bradley in Dublin, and subscriptions were taken by Pilkington in Cork (Dublin News Letter, 30 Dec 1738 – 2 Jan 1738/9). The price to subscribers was 20s. in half binding, 6s. to be paid in advance and 2s. on delivery of each volume. He was subscription agent for Charles Rollin, Ancient history of the Egyptians, published in Dublin by Risk, Ewing and Smith, in 13 volumes duodecimo between 1738 and 1740. The final three volumes were advertised in 1739 at a cost of six British shillings (6s.6d. Irish) in half binding (Dublin News Letter, 16-20 Oct 1739). He subscribed to six copies of James Ware’s The whole works, volume one was printed in Dublin in 1739 for the author by Elizabeth Jones. It finally came to two volumes folio with plates, with the second volume in two parts printed in 1745 and 1746. He was subscription agent for The genuine works of Flavius Josephus printed in Dublin in five volumes octavo with plates and maps by Richard Reilly for George Ewing in 1741 (Dublin News Letter, 13-16 Dec 1740). In 1741 he was agent for James Blair of Virginia Our Saviour’s divine sermon on the mount in three volumes octavo. This was a reprint of the third edition printed by William Smith in Dame Street, Dublin. The cost to subscribers was 13s. in half binding, half to be paid on subscribing and 2s. British per volume on delivery (Dublin Journal, 2 Jun 1741). In 1745 Thomas Pilkington was still listed as subscription agent for Walter Harris, Life of William III, printed in Dublin by Edward and John Exshaw, even though Martha had taken over the business by then (Dublin Courant, 26 Oct 1745).\n\nLate in his career he began to print books, although he is likely to have done jobbing printing before this time. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC online) lists two items printed by and for Thomas Pilkington. The first in 1741 was The memoirs of Majr. Alexander Ramkins, a highland officer, an 86 page text in octavo format. The final unpaginated leaf, which should have been a preliminary leaf as evidenced by the catchword, was headed ‘The publisher to the reader’, and sets out his justification for the publication of the text. He printed James Eyre Weekes’ Poems on several occasions for the author in 1743. Published by subscription, the monies generated in advance helped fund the project. The list comprises 242 names, some of whom took multiple copies of the book.\n\nMartha Pilkington (1743-1757):\n\nMartha Pilkington, Thomas’s widow, took over the business in Castle Street about 1743 and she ran a full-scale printing office and bookshop until about 1757. Her death is recorded in 1773 ‘relict of Mr Pilkington, formerly an eminent bookseller’, although her name is given as Mary (Finn’s Leinster Journal, 26-29 May 1773). Martha’s printing output from 1743 to 1757 mostly comprised pamphlets and sermons of local interest. ESTC records 18 pamphlets under her imprint. She did job printing for customers, stating in the imprints of some of her early publications ‘all manner of printing work is carefully done at reasonable rates’.\n\nThe free Briton’s answer to the Pretender’s declaration (Cork, 1745), imprint.\n\nMartha continued to trade with a number of Dublin booksellers, particularly Edward and John Exshaw and Abraham Bradley, acting as subscription agent for many of their publications. Martha Pilkington and Cornelius Sullivan, bookseller in Castle Street, were agents for Exshaw’s London Magazine from about 1746 to 1754, selling at a British sixpence (6½d. Irish) per monthly issue (Dublin Courant, 30 Dec 1746-3 Jan 1746/7; 17-21 Mar 1746/7; London Magazine, Jun 1746; Jan 1747; Dec 1750; Mar-Apr 1754). When proposals were issued in 1747 by Edward and John Exshaw for printing by subscription The works of Shakespear in eight volumes duodecimo, with notes by Pope and Warburton, Martha Pilkington was one of several booksellers in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford to take orders for this prestigious work (Dublin Courant, 23-26 May 1747). The cost to subscribers was to be 16s.3d. sterling in the best half binding, with no advance payment necessary (Dublin Journal, 23 May 1747). Advertisements for the set in finer bindings put the cost at four British crowns (£1.1s.8d.) neatly bound in calf, with half (10s10d.) to be paid in advance (Dublin Courant, 23-26 May 1747; Dublin Journal, 9 Jun 1747; 15 Aug 1747). She was also subscription agent for Peter Wilson’s Dublin edition of The Spectator in eight volumes in 1747 and 1748, the cost of 10s.10d. was spread out with 2s.2d. to be paid in advance and 1s.1d. on delivery of each volume (Dublin Journal, 15 Dec 1747; 23 Jan 1747/48; Dublin Courant, 15-19 Dec 1747). She was agent for Thomas Stackhouse’s A new history of the Bible, reprinted from the London edition in 1748 by Edward and John Exshaw in Dublin. They were willing to go ahead with the project when 150 purchasers had subscribed. Printed in six volumes octavo with maps, the cost to subscribers was £1.6s., with 6s.6d. to be paid in advance and 3s.3d. on delivery of each volume in half binding (Dublin Courant, 5-8 Mar 1748). Martha Pilkington subscribed to eight sets for her bookshop. She acted as subscription agent in 1748 for Abraham Bradley’s Dublin reprint of The negociator’s magazine by Richard Hayes, accountant and teacher in London, priced at 4s.4d., half to be paid in advance (Dublin Courant, 5-8 Mar 1748). Bradley was willing to go to press as soon as 200 subscribers were gathered, it was published in one volume octavo the following year. In 1752 she was agent for Dublin bookseller, John Smith’s, edition of Chronological antiquities by John Jackson. The work in three volumes octavo was priced at 13s. in half binding, half to be paid on subscribing, a lesser cost than the original larger format London edition in three volumes quarto selling for £2.10s. (Belfast News Letter, 24 Nov 1752).\n\nAt her printing office she produced a number of pamphlets of local interest, and did jobbing work for individual customers. Job printing could include notices, bill heads, trade cards, advertising, calling cards, and any small scale printing work. She printed for Cork Corporation from 1755 to 1757, a responsible and lucrative commission (Caulfield 1876, pp 684, 695, 702). The Jacobite rising of 1745 in which Charles Edward Stuart (the young Pretender) led a Scottish army in an attempt to regain the British throne for his father James Francis Edward Stuart (the old Pretender, son of the deposed Catholic King James II), was the over-riding political event of the period. Martha Pilkington printed pamphlets associated with the rebellion. She issued the renowned sermon in opposition to the Pretender by Thomas Herring (archbishop of York 1743-1747), A sermon preached at the cathedral church of York, September 22d. 1745. On occasion of the present rebellion in Scotland. By the Most Reverend Father in God, Thomas lord archbishop of York. This sermon, a sixteen page text in octavo format, was first printed in York and London, and a version appeared in The Gentleman’s Magazine (Sept 1745, pp 471-72). She also printed a thirteen page octavo pamphlet The free Briton’s answer to the Pretender’s declaration. Supposed to be wrote by His Grace the Lord A-b-sh-p of Y-rke. This Protestant loyalist pamphlet, also issued in Dublin and Belfast, is signed Montanus, the pseudonym of Thomas Gordon, so was not written by the archbishop of York, but wished to be associated with his views. She printed The farmer’s letter to the Protestants of Ireland, a series of six letters penned by Henry Brooke, each of eight pages octavo. These letters, originally printed in Dublin by George Faulkner, uphold the Protestant monarchy in Great Britain and oppose the Stuart Pretender. She issued one pamphlet by Rev Joseph Fowke, The duty of subjects to a good prince consider’d. A sermon preached in Dublin, October 20th, 1745, which was in favour of the Pretender. This was also printed in Dublin by Samuel Powell for John Smith, Abraham Bradley and Edward Exshaw.\n\nShe specialized in the printing and sale of Protestant works, many reprinted from London or Dublin editions. She printed the fourth edition of Rev Joseph Trapp’s The nature, folly, sin, and danger of being righteous over-much. This title is undated, and ESTC estimates a date of 1740 based on the London fourth edition of 1739, but it is likely to be after 1743 when Martha had taken over the business. George Harrison, printer and bookseller at Meetinghouse Lane, issued A serious answer to Dr Trapp’s four sermons by William Law in 1748, this response had been published in London in 1740 and 1741, with a further reply from Dr Trapp in 1741. In 1745 Martha undertook a larger project, Thomas Wilson, bishop of Sodor and Man, A short and plain instruction for the better understanding of the Lord’s Supper, the ninth edition, coming in at 196 pages octavo. A shorter work of 24 pages quarto, A Protestant catechism; shewing the principal errors of the church of Rome, first published in Dublin in 1740, was in its third edition when she printed it in 1747.\n\nThomas Cooper, Vain confidence exposed (Cork, 1748), title page and advertisement.\n\nShe issued a number of religious titles of local interest, including pamphlets written by the Anglican Church of Ireland bishops of Cork and Ross, Robert Clayton (1735-1745) and Jemmett Browne (1745-1772), and bishop of Cloyne, George Berkeley (1734-1753). Her earliest publications are the two editions in quarto format of a pastoral letter of twelve and fourteen pages respectively, written by Bishop Robert Clayton, dated 28 March 1743, and a twenty page reply to the letter. In 1748 Rev Thomas Cooper, prebendary of the diocese of Cloyne, wrote Vain confidence exposed, a reply to Timothy O’Brien’s Truth triumphant. At the end of this treatise she inserted an advertisement for works printed and sold at her bookshop in Castle Street, which included her printings of A Protestant catechism, Rev Trapp’s Nature, folly, sin and Bishop Wilson’s Short and plain instruction, as well as Ramkins’ Memoirs, printed by Thomas Pilkington. In 1749 Rev Mr Marmaduke Dallas occasioned a number of pamphlets, The Revd Mr Dallas’s apology to the bishop and clergy of the diocese of Cork, 16 pages octavo, The conduct of the dean of Cork, and other clergymen of the same dioceses (sic) in relation to the suit carried on against Mr Dallas, 39 pages octavo, and Bishop Jemmett Browne, A letter from a clrgyman (sic) in the diocese of Cork, to his friend in Dublin, relating the conduct of the Bishop of Cork, in the degradation of Mr Dallas, 48 pages octavo. In 1755 she printed an eight page pamphlet by Bishop George Berkeley, A proposal for making a more effectual provision for the widows of clergymen of the diocese of Cloyne, dated 9 August, 1751. In 1756 she advertised ‘will be published in a few days by Mrs Martha Pilkington in Castle St, A form of prayer for a publick fast, on Friday, 6th February next’ (Corke Journal, 29 Jan 1756).\n\nIn 1748 she printed two pamphlets in quarto format which formed part of a medical controversy. This related to the treatment of Mr Baker for a fever and the litigation which followed. The original pamphlet, The case of Mr Baker truly stated by Dr Patrick Blair, was printed in Cork by George Harrison. Martha issued A fair, honest, and full reply to a pamphlet; intitled, The case of Mr Baker truly stated. With some modest remarks on the candour of the author. By the four physicians, that attended Mr Baker, in the course of his late fever, and An answer to a letter from a gentleman in the country to his friend in town, signed Philaletes, pseudonym of Dr Joseph Rogers, one of the physicians associated with the case. She printed a Latin grammar in 1749 by Manuel Alvares, Emmanuelis Alvari prosodia sive institutionum linguae Latinae. She imported her printing paper from France and the Netherlands, the paper used in Cooper’s Vain confidence is watermarked with the arms of France and dated 1742, while Alvares’ grammar is printed on paper watermarked with the arms of Amsterdam (Trinity College Dublin, Early Printed Books catalogue).\n\nThere is no further mention of Martha’s business after 1757, when she must have retired. She does not appear to have had any successors, so the business did not pass on to anyone in the family. She lived until May 1773 (Finn’s Leinster Journal, 26-29 May 1773).\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the first three decades of the eighteenth century the Cork book trade depended on the Dublin and London trades for newly published titles. Local printing consisted mainly of newspapers, religious pamphlets and texts of local interest. A number of booksellers worked in Cork in this early period, mostly working in the city centre on Castle Street and Main Street.\n\nFor thirty years Pilkington’s bookshop in Castle Street served the people of Cork. As well as having strong links to the Dublin book trade Thomas Pilkington also kept up-to-date with new titles printed in London, ordering new books each month, as he claimed in 1728. His death, probably about 1743, did not mean the end of the business, which was carried on by his widow, Martha Pilkington, for a further 14 years. She continued the sale of books and stationery, dealing with booksellers in Dublin acting as agent for their publications, while expanding the printing side of the business. Her relationship with other prominent Cork booksellers seems to have been good, as they continued to have business dealings with the Dublin trade. Her loyalist Protestant credentials ensured her printing work with Cork city council, and with the local Anglican bishops.\n\nReferences:\n\nCaulfield, Richard, ed., 1876.

A description of the flourishing city of Corke (Corke, printed by Andrew Welsh for Edward Lloyd, 1732).\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn the last quarter of the eighteenth century Cork, Ireland’s second city, had a population estimated at about 70,000 (Derrick 1767; Campbell 1777; Young 1780; Connell 1950). The city was at the centre of a wealthy and populous hinterland (Dickson 2005). Cork harbour was a main port of call for the English navy and other transatlantic shipping, Cork merchants had close links with the Atlantic ports of France and Spain, where family members often held commercial concerns. The size and security of the deep-water harbour, in addition to the prime situation of Cork for trade with the West Indies and the Americas, ensured its prosperity throughout the century. Cork was primarily a merchant city, outward looking and open to new ideas. The population of the city was varied: politically Protestant-dominated, commercially it had a strong and wealthy Catholic sector, the Huguenot community was active in trade from the late seventeenth century, various regiments of the British army were stationed in Cork throughout the century.\n\nPerspective view of Cork in Charles Smith, The antient and present state of the county and city of Cork (Dublin, A. Reilly for the author, 1750).\n\nBy the mid eighteenth century the city was finding its place as a cultural centre, the book trade was active from the early years of the century and visiting troupes of actors had been bringing theatrical entertainment in the summer season from the late 1730s (Clark 1965). The first newspapers published in the city were short-lived and it was not until the 1750s that regular newspapers could be sustained (National Library of Ireland Newsplan database). The Irish language was still spoken by many of the inhabitants of the city and surrounding areas up to the last quarter of the century (Beecher 1993). The business of the city and port, however, was carried out in English, and virtually all printing work was in English. Several printers, booksellers and stationers worked in the city from the early century supplying the civil administration, religious and educational institutions and Cork’s intellectual elite (Kennedy 2005). Books were distributed from Dublin or imported directly from London. Because of Cork’s prime position for trade the road networks were extensive. Local booksellers distributed their printed works to the main towns in Munster using the Post Office network and private couriers to circulate newspapers, periodicals and books (Kennedy 1998).\n\nCork Harbour from Old Monkstown Road from Mrs S. C. Hall, Ireland: its scenery, character, &c. (London, How and Parsons, 1841).\n\nLiteracy and Reading:\n\nPost-elementary education was available to the sons and daughters of the middle classes from the early years of the eighteenth century. Classical, diocesan and royal schools provided education of boys, preparing them for university and careers in trade and the army. Tutors and governesses were employed by wealthy families to educate their children. An important strand of private academies and schools teaching boys and girls at post-elementary level began to appear before the middle of the eighteenth century. These schools were important as they brought education within the scope of less well-off parents who had ambitions for their children. For girls the subjects generally taught were English, French and sometimes Italian, geography, history, needlework, music and dancing.\n\nReading aloud was an important social accomplishment, and girls in particular were encouraged to develop their reading skills. Guides for reading aloud were published for the benefit of young persons to enable them to distinguish themselves in company. The reading of novels was not always encouraged, older readers fearing a detrimental affect on young minds. However, novels were widely available either for purchase or for borrowing from a circulating library. Contemporary literature points to the extensive use of circulating libraries by women, most notably in Sheridan’s The rivals (Sheridan 1775). Irish booksellers ran circulating libraries in many Irish towns in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. They prided themselves on stocking the very latest and most fashionable reading matter, especially novels, plays and poetry. For a modest sum, on average 6½d. per week, 5s.5d. per quarter, or 16s.3d. per year in the 1780s and 1790s, books could be borrowed and read. Circulating libraries helped to create and satisfy the need for novel reading, with every new publication published in Cork, Dublin and London available as soon as published. Locally-produced novels were published with the expectation of good sales and a place on the shelves of circulating libraries. These libraries appealed to readers who were not wealthy, the quarterly fee amounting to less than the cost of a two volume work.\n\nAuthorship:\n\nReaders make writers: from being an avid reader it is frequently a short step to becoming a writer. Women wrote poetry and novels and sought outlets for their work. Outlets which were available to budding authors and did not involve the expense of publication included newspapers and literary periodicals. One example is the novelist and travel writer, Mary Boddington (née Comerford), born in Cork in 1776, who began her career writing verse for the Cork papers (O’Donoghue 1892). As early as the 1770s ‘literary contributors of both sexes’ were encouraged by William Flyn and his newspaper the Hibernian Chronicle (Hibernian Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772; Kennedy 2009). Flyn had as his editor Henry Sheares, who guided the early years of the Hibernian Chronicle from 1769 until his death in December 1775. Sheares gathered around him a coterie of literary men and women who contributed to the paper. Essays, prose and poetry were published in the pages of the Hibernian Chronicle under Flyn’s proprietorship for over thirty years. A selection of these contributions was published in a volume entitled The modern monitor, or Flyn’s speculations in 1771 (Modern monitor 1771). As this is volume one the intention was clearly to publish more, but no further volumes appeared. All surviving copies are the second edition, the first edition being publication in the Chronicle. Subscriptions were taken by booksellers James Williams and Thomas Walker in Dublin, Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford, John Ferrar and Catherine Long in Limerick, and at all country places where the Chronicle was circulated in 1770 (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Jul 1770). The subscription list is quite small, 102 names, 31 (or 30%) of whom are women, including most of the contributors, some of whom subscribed to multiple copies. Contributions were anonymous, the writers using initials or pseudonyms. Several copies of this volume have contemporary annotations identifying the contributors, one copy belonging to the Countess of Shannon notes some of them (Dublin City Library and Archive: Dix Collection 082).They included Henry Sheares, his wife Mrs Jane Anne Sheares, Dr John Longfield, Dr Joseph Fenn Sleigh, Mrs Elizabeth Gray, Mrs Stack, Miss Waterhouse and Mrs Therry. Flyn’s daughter, Eliza, who married the bookseller James Haly, was a frequent contributor to the Hibernian Chronicle (Ó Casaide, n.d., p.33; Kennedy 2009).\n\nThe modern monitor; or Flyn’s speculations (Cork, William Flyn, 1771), title page. Mrs Creech, Mary (Cork, J. Connor, 1796), title page.\n\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century locally produced literary and general periodicals were a feature of the Cork book trade. They drew on local talent for their contributions and were published and sometimes edited by local booksellers. The Weekly repository, begun in 1779, covered a broad range of topics: history, philosophy, mathematics, poetry, ‘with several curious and entertaining originals’. The Cork weekly magazine, or universal repository of knowledge, instruction and entertainment published by the bookseller Thomas Lord from 1790, the Quiz (1794), the Medler (1795), the Tickler (1795), the Rover (1795-96), the Museum (1796), the Monthly miscellany (1796), and the Casket (1797-98) were all short-lived literary periodicals published in Cork in the last decade of the eighteenth century (Ó Casaide, n.d.).They provided a forum for female authors as well as their male counterparts. Mr Trant, printer at Hanover Street, published the Museum in 1796. A weekly publication issued on Saturdays, it contained essays, poetry, theatrical scripts and correspondence. It is not certain if he can be identified with James Philip Trant, who worked from Academy Street a decade earlier. In 1788 James Philip had published The vale of Irvine a two-volume novel by Harriet Westrop Atkins. In 1797 Mr Trant subscribed to 25 sets of the two volume novel A history of Julia and Cecilia de Valmont, by a young lady, lately deceased, published by John Connor.\n\nThe locally produced literary magazines, although short-lived, testify to this upsurge in literary interest. John Connor, James Haly and Michael Harris were to the fore in publishing original works of fiction and poetry, often by subscription. The last decade of the eighteenth-century saw an increased level of literary activity in the city, and the publication of several original works. Connor’s literary output was especially significant, publishing at least twenty-seven literary titles in the twenty year period from 1794, more than half of which were original works (Loeber 1998). Connor established his circulating library at 17, Castle Street, the corner of Cornmarket, in the early 1790s (Cork Gazette, 17 Apr 1793; 20 Apr 1793), later moving to Chatterton’s Buildings, Grand Parade, by 1798. As well as his bookshop, the circulating library required a wide range of new publications and the most fashionable reading matter for its success. Connor regularly advertised new novels lately published in Dublin and London as well as his own publication of original works.\n\nEdward Henry Morgan was proprietor of the Classic Novels Office in Daunt Square in 1803 where he published a series of small-format popular works. Titles included The history of Rasselas, prince of Abissinia (Samuel Johnson), The man of feeling (Henry Mackenzie), Paul and Virginia (Jean-Jacques Rousseau), Julia de Roubigné and Don Quixote (Cervantes) in four volumes. He published a new edition of Frances Sheridan’s The history of Nourjahad, the Persian, first published in London in 1767, as part of the series. The project was short-lived, however, and he was declared bankrupt in May 1804 (Freeman’s Journal, 10 May 1804). The project was probably too ambitious and the market was not able to give rapid enough returns on such an investment. Morgan may not have had the customer base to sustain this project in the way that John Connor or James Haly had.\n\nSubscription editions:\n\nBooks were published by subscription to help finance the publication and to gain an idea of the size of the interested market. Subscription lists indicate support and patronage for the author rather than readership. Subscription campaigns were usually quite focussed, a large percentage of the names linked by a number of common factors: relationship with the author, regional interest, charitable motive, professional or confessional support. A typical book published by subscription in Ireland was a religious work, or a collection of poems, in small format, duodecimo or octavo, and printed for the author. In general 200 subscriptions were required to make a venture viable, but sometimes lists containing 100 names or less are found. The usual range of commitment was from 200 to 500 names, some subscribing for multiple copies. Women’s names appear less in subscription lists than men’s, on average amounting to less than one-third of subscribers.\n\nInteresting evidence comes from four novels written by women and published by subscription in Cork in the 1790s. All had an interested female audience, ranging from 23% for Anna Millikin’s Corfe Castle (1793), 34.1% and 34.5% for Millikin’s Eva (1795) and Mrs Creech’s Mary (1796) respectively, to 43.8% for The history of Julia and Cecilia de Valmont (1797) (Kennedy 1999, p. 90). Three were published by John Connor, and the fourth by James Haly. In each case the lists show a strong local support in the Munster region.\n\nAnna Millikin’s novels and other writings began to be published in Cork from the 1790s. She and her brother Richard, lawyer and poet, founded the Casket, or Hesperian magazine, a literary periodical, in 1797, which lasted until the eve of the rebellion in 1798. In duodecimo format, it was printed for the proprietors by Anthony Edwards in Castle Street. It contained serialized fiction, short stories, biography and poetry. Her first novel, Corfe Castle, was published by James Haly in 1793, and later novels, Eva (1795), Plantagenet; or secrets of the House of Anjou (1802), and The rival chiefs; or, the battle of Mere (1804) were published by John Connor. Her works attracted a popular audience as can be seen from the subscription lists, and in particular the number of copies taken by booksellers for resale (Kennedy 1999). As a teacher in the English academy for females in Cork, she also wrote textbooks ‘for the use of her pupils’ (Millikin 1808).\n\nAnna Millikin, Corfe Castle (Cork, James Haly, 1793), title page and first page of subscription list.\n\nAnna Millikin was from Castlemartyr, County Cork, and was supported by many of the important Cork families: Lord Boyle, Countess Shannon, Lady Harriet Bernard of Bandon, members of the Freke family, as well as her neighbours in Castlemartyr, Youghal, Killeagh, Ardmore and across the harbour in Passage West. Her first novel, Corfe Castle; or historic tracts, was published by James Haly in two volumes duodecimo, costing 5s.5d. (Cork Gazette, 30 Mar 1793; 24 Aug 1793). The subscription list contains 139 names, taking 249 copies of the book, Lord Boyle took 21 sets, and Countess Shannon four sets. Three Dublin booksellers took multiple copies for sale in their bookshops, Patrick Byrne 50 sets, Patrick Wogan 25 sets and Richard M. Butler twelve sets.\n\nAnna Millikin, Eva (Cork, J. Connor, 1795), title page. Advertisement for Eva in The Cavern of death (Cork, J. Connor, 1795).\n\nMillikin’s novel, Eva, in one volume duodecimo, selling at 3s.3d., attracted 171 subscribers for 464 copies of the book. In her ‘Advertisement’ in a preliminary page, she thanks the subscription gatherers: ‘her most grateful acknowledgments to those friends, who have so kindly exerted themselves in her favour, as to enable her to produce the following List, without having recourse to the public Prints’ (Millikin 1795). The novel appealed to the trade as a certain bestseller, possibly due to the popularity of Corfe Castle. John Connor, bookseller and proprietor of the circulating library in Cork, the publisher of the work, subscribed to 100 copies, as did Dublin bookseller Patrick Wogan. John Millikin, bookseller in Dublin, who may have been a relative, took 50 copies, while the booksellers James Johnson in Youghal and Thomas White in Cork took twelve each. In this case the copies of the book ordered by booksellers greatly outnumbered those pledged to individual subscribers. John Connor used the final leaf to advertise his new books likely to appeal to this readership, which included novels by Mrs Bennett, Mrs Radcliffe, Miss Gunning and Charlotte Smith. In 1796 John Milliken advertised Eva as one of his new books just published, but this was not his own publication, but one of the 50 copies taken from John Connor’s edition ((The Oracle, 9 Nov 1796). Of the eight novels advertised only four were actually printed by Milliken. This way of advertising was typical of the period, new books were listed as ‘published by’ the seller, who was offering copies for sale, and did not have a financial stake in the production costs of the edition, except in so far as pledging for 50 or 100 copies can be seen as a subvention to the undertaker of the project.\n\nMrs Creech ran a school for young ladies in Cook Street, Cork, in 1795. She advertised her forthcoming novel, Mary, or the uses of adversity in August of that year, and it was published the following year (Cork Gazette, 5 Sept 1795). Printed in two volumes duodecimo, it attracted 179 subscribers, 61 of them women. John Connor, the publisher, took 100 copies of the book, and Michael Harris, bookseller in Cork, took 25 copies. The novel featured among new books added to the Belfast Circulating Library in July 1796 (Belfast News Letter, 11 Jul 1796).\n\nWomen often wrote anonymously, ‘by a lady’, and in many cases the author’s identity is never revealed. In some cases the identity can be gleaned from the composition of the subscription list. The history of Julia and Cecilia de Valmont is attributed to Sophia Briscoe, a young woman who died young, having written the novel at the age of 17, and the preface was written by one of her relatives. Published in Cork in two volumes duodecimo by John Connor, the author clearly had connections in Limerick and Tipperary. An extract from the novel was published in the literary periodical the Casket in May 1797 (Loeber 2006). Subscribers giving an address in Cork city and county amounted to 40%, but County Limerick provided 25.6%, County Tipperary over 11%, and County Waterford 9% of names, of which twelve individuals were from the Waterford Regiment. The National Library copy of The history of Julia and Cecilia has the owner’s signature: ‘Elizabeth Sayers, Bridges Square, Limerick, 22 May 1798’. Miss Sayers appears in the subscription list, as do seven other subscribers with an address at The Square in Limerick. The Lord Bishop of Limerick is among the subscribers, Lord and Lady Inchiquin, and the Countess of Clare. William Goggin, bookseller in Limerick, subscribed to 15 sets for local customers. Members of the Cork aristocracy and gentry also supported the novel, including Lord Boyle, the Earl and Countess of Shannon, Lady Doneraile, Lady Gillman, and Lady Longueville. The composition of the list points to its being supported by Anna Millikin’s circle, and publication in the Casket further emphasises this. Six sets were taken by Vincent Dowling, for the Apollo Circulating Library at Suffolk Street, Dublin. Connor took the opportunity of advertising new books available at his circulating library, which included eight novels.\n\nThese novels, all in small format duodecimo size, published within a five year period expected a sizable general readership, with booksellers subscribing to substantial quantities. Multiple copies for sale, and for circulating libraries are recorded. It is not known if the market lived up to expectations. Anna Millikin found that she could not repair the family fortunes by writing, and turned to teaching instead. Mrs Creech also had an outside income from teaching and running a private school. These lists point to print-runs of 500 or so, a small quantity compared with school and college texts, devotional works, and topical or sensational works such as trials. It seems certain that these novels were targeted at the lending libraries where they would reach a large and diverse audience. Dublin booksellers such as Patrick Wogan and Patrick Byrne had an extensive country trade, with contacts throughout Ireland, and it seems likely that they intended to distribute the volumes countrywide to smaller towns and country readers.\n\nSubscription lists show that Cork publications were supported by the local aristocracy and gentry, and subscribers extended across the Munster region, through the counties of Cork, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, and as far as Clare and Kerry. Women authors were encouraged at different levels: at a micro level their pieces were accepted for publication in newspapers and periodicals, and at a macro level novels and books of poetry were published by mainstream booksellers and supported by general audiences and by the book trade.\n\nThe identities of women readers and book buyers are often hidden from view, but subscription lists help to reveal their presence, their tastes, and the authors they supported. Novels and other literary works appealed to women and girls, literary periodicals catered to this taste by providing extracts of new work, and gave a forum for poets to publish their work. The handy duodecimo size of many novels allowed for reading outdoors while walking or taking the air. Easy to fit in a pocket, they facilitated more informal reading habits.\n\nReferences:\n\nBeecher, Seán, 1993.

An examination of five works printed by subscription by William Flyn, printer, bookseller and newspaper proprietor at the Shakespeare in Castle Street, Cork, can give a window into this cohort (Kennedy 2009). The titles, published from 1768 to 1775, provide 1,479 names, ranged over six counties in the Munster region: counties Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, Clare, Waterford and Limerick.. The use of subscription lists is not without its problems, but they constitute an important source of evidence that cannot be found elsewhere. The spread of subscribers closely mirrors the distribution patterns of The Hibernian Chronicle, although other factors would also have been at work in gathering subscriptions. Subscription lists do not provide a cross section of book buyers as each one has its own audience, made up of sectional interests, friends or neighbours of the author, readers’ interest in the subject matter, or other unifying strands of which we may not be aware. Furthermore only a small number of publications were produced in this way. The occurrence of five such publications in a seven year period from the same printer gives an opportunity to examine any connections and overlaps between readers, and the distribution of purchasers in a limited geographical area.\n\nFlyn’s publication of the twice-weekly Hibernian Chronicle from October 1769 gave him access to the reading public throughout Cork and surrounding counties. He printed 2,000 proposals to establish the newspaper in September 1769, and when he had attracted ‘a respectable number of ladies and gentlemen’ as subscribers he launched the venture (Hibernian Chronicle, 23 Oct 1769). The paper was published on Mondays and Thursdays, at the price of one penny per issue, or five British shillings (5s.5d. Irish) per annum to town subscribers, and a half guinea (10s.6d.) per annum to country subscribers, for this sum Flyn included a title page and index at the end of each year (Hibernian Chronicle, 31 Dec 1770; 2 Jan 1772). The newspaper was distributed widely using the Post Office network and by employing couriers, whom Flyn paid quarterly (Hibernian Chronicle, 16 Jul 1772). By early 1770 agents were in place in the major Cork towns: Castlemartyr, Cloyne, Kinsale, Mallow, Midleton and Youghal, and by the middle of the year he had an agent in Killarney, County Kerry. These agents were not booksellers but an innkeeper, a merchant, an apothecary, a cooper, two post masters, and a teacher (see Note 1). By 1772 The Hibernian Chronicle was circulated by couriers to 26 towns in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Kerry, ‘besides a great number to the different post-offices in the kingdom’ (Hibernian Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772). A provincial newspaper created a network by which books and periodicals could be distributed to the smaller towns and country places. The regular delivery of a paper ensured a constant audience for the advertisements carried in its pages. The agents for the newspaper took in subscriptions and orders for books advertised.\n\nThe earliest of the five publications considered here is The history of Hypolitus, Earl of Douglas, translated from the French by a Gentleman, printed in 1768, in duodecimo format and selling at a cost of three British shillings (3s.3d. Irish) bound. This project was undertaken by the printer himself and we have no evidence that the translator needed to pay a subvention. It attracted 291 subscribers, including Cork booksellers John Bardin, who took 21 copies, and Thomas White, who took 14, and John Ferrar, bookseller in Limerick. Flyn took 21 copies for his own bookshop. The history of Hypolitus was translated from the French by local French teacher, Peter Guitton, who ran a boarding school in Cork city, and an advertisement for his school is carried at the end of the subscription list. The original Histoire d’Hypolite by Madame d’Aulnoy was first published in 1690, and was one of the most popular novels of the eighteenth century. This translation appealed to a literary audience, Francophile readers, and members of the Huguenot congregation including Rev. John Madras, minister of the Huguenot church in Cork, and Peter Ardouin, a prominent Huguenot merchant, who took 20 books. It is dedicated to the Right Honourable Richard, Earl of Shannon, a supporter of literary endeavour, who also subscribed to other publications printed by William Flyn.\n\nThe history of Hypolitus (Cork, 1768), titlepage. The works of the late Rev. George Russel (Cork, 1769), titlepage.\n\nThe following year Flyn printed The works of the late Rev. George Russel in two volumes octavo ‘for the benefit of the author’s widow and children’. This project was a benevolent one and it attracted 323 subscribers, 19 of whom were named in the additional list in volume two. It sold for two British crowns (10s.10d. Irish), sewed, and subscribers could have it bound to their own taste afterwards. Rev. Russel was Church of Ireland Rector of Schull in West Cork and his works were made up of ‘original poems, translations, letters, essays and criticisms, with an entire translation of the Lettres galantes of Fontenelle’. Clergy and members of the Church of Ireland communities supported this work. On the final two pages Flyn printed a catalogue of ‘Books published and sold by W. Flyn’, including The history of Hypolitus.\n\nFlyn’s next subscription project, The modern monitor; or, Flyn’s speculations, was entirely his own, being a selection of literary contributions from the pages of The Hibernian Chronicle. As a newspaper the Chronicle carried local and foreign news and advertisements, but Flyn also wished to give it a literary turn, inviting readers of both sexes to contribute pieces to create ‘a compleat reservoir of politics, history, poetry, literature, agriculture, commerce, … and everything relative to the fair sex’ (Hibernian Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772). The leading article of each issue was an essay, signed only with an initial or pseudonym. In addition to original essays, the Chronicle reprinted literary and scientific pieces. Flyn was well supported by his editors and contributors, numbering some of Cork’s literary elite. In 1802, when he handed over full control of the Chronicle to his successors, Flyn thanked the public for their support over thirty-three years and paid tribute to ‘the great talents which first brought it to its maturity’ (Hibernian Chronicle, 22 Mar 1802), and nearly a decade later his obituary stated that the paper was set up ‘under the auspices and support of the first literary characters in this city’ (Cork Mercantile Chronicle, 20 Dec 1811). Flyn had as his editor Henry Sheares (Madden 1867, ii, pp 172-78), an eminent banker in Cork, and M.P. for Clonakilty, who guided the literary content of the paper from the beginning until his death in December 1775 (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Nov-4 Dec 1775; 4-7 Dec 1775). Sheares was very influential in the cultural life of Cork at the period and gathered around him a coterie of men and women who made regular contributions to the literary section of the Chronicle. Very much part of this circle was Flyn’s daughter, Eliza Haly, a cultured woman deeply involved in literary pursuits. A selection of these literary essays were gathered together and reprinted in The modern monitor. Several copies of this volume have contemporary annotations identifying the authors, one copy belonging to the Countess of Shannon notes some of them (Dublin City Library and Archive: Dix Collection 082). The main regular contributors were the editor, Henry Sheares, often using the signature William Flyn or any of the letters W.F.L.Y.N., Mrs Sheares, Dr John Longfield, Mrs Elizabeth Gray, Dr Richard William Stack of London, Mrs Stack, Miss Waterhouse, Mrs Therry, Mr Comerford and Dr Joseph Fenn Sleigh.\n\nIn July 1770 Flyn issued proposals for printing the first volume of The modern monitor, in duodecimo priced at a British half crown (2s.8½d. Irish), bound and lettered (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Jul 1770). He clearly had the intention of producing further volumes in due course. Even though proposals were issued in July 1770, which corresponds with the imprint date of 1771, it may not have appeared until 1774 (Ó Casaide, typescript). All surviving copies are the second edition, the first edition being publication in the Chronicle. Subscriptions were taken by booksellers James Williams and Thomas Walker in Dublin, Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford, John Ferrar and Catherine Long in Limerick, and at all country places where the Chronicle was circulated in 1770 (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Jul 1770). The subscription list is quite small, 102 names, including most of the contributors, some of whom subscribed to multiple copies (see Note 2).\n\nThe modern monitor (Cork, 1771), titlepage. James Poulson, Moral and divine observations (Cork, 1775), titlepage.\n\nIn 1773 Flyn printed Richard Challoner’s Considerations upon Christian truths in two volumes duodecimo, selling at 5s.5d. bound (Challoner 1773). He advertised proposals for printing it by subscription in January 1772, his subscription agents were booksellers Richard Fitzsimons and Thomas Walker in Dublin, Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford, Edmund Finn in Kilkenny, and Catherine Long in Limerick. Volume one was completed in February 1773, with volume two due to follow shortly (Hibernian Chronicle, 13 Jan 1772; 4 Feb 1773). Flyn specialised in the sale of Catholic books, by wholesale and retail, and he advertised it as part of a ‘variety of Catholic books and school books, printed and sold by William Flyn’, listed in his edition of An abstract of the Doway catechism in 1774. Only volume two of this work has survived, the main subscription list in volume one is lost, and volume two contains the supplementary list of ‘Subscribers whose names were returned too late to be inserted in the first volume.’ This list comprises just 150 names, a large proportion are from County Kerry, including the Catholic bishop, Rev. John Madgett, who took 80 sets. At a cost of 5s.5d. this amounts to a total of £420, with at least £200 to be paid in advance. This is an extraordinary commitment, amounting to a subvention for the edition.\n\nRichard Challoner, Considerations upon Christian truths (Cork, 1773), titlepage. William Flyn’s advertisement in Abstract of the Doway catechism (Cork, 1774).\n\nThe fifth title, James Poulson’s Moral and divine observations, printed for the author and sold by William Flyn and Thomas White, has the largest subscription list of the five, comprising 613 names taking 732 copies of the book. Addresses are given for many, but a note states that ‘those subscribers whose places of abode are not specified, reside in or near Cork’. The mainly religious observations, interspersed with remarks on land and estate improvement, are the result of a tour through Munster, in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Tipperary, Clare and Kerry. It is dedicated to the Right Honourable John De Courcy, Baron of Kingsale, and in return Lord and Lady Kingsale each subscribed to three copies of the book. At the end of the octavo volume, completed in January 1775, the author promises another volume in April or May, but this does not appear to have been published. An expanded version in two volumes was published by subscription in Belfast in 1777, as Observations on various subjects (Poulson 1777), volume one was dedicated to the Baron of Kingsale, and volume two to his widow, Lady Dowager Kingsale.\n\nA cross-section of readers and potential readers can be glimpsed in Cork and surrounding counties at this period. The subject matter of the different works determined their particular support: The history of Hypolitus and The modern monitor appealed to literary subscribers. The works of Rev. George Russel attracted large support from members and clergy of the Church of Ireland. Challoner’s Considerations was supported by Catholic individuals and families. Poulson’s Moral and divine observations is a religious work by a local author with a local following. The analysis of the subscription lists is limited as most do not provide occupations or addresses. Those subscribers who have a title (Rev., Capt., Mrs, Miss) are most easily categorised. In the five lists considered here women account for over 14% of subscribers. Members of the professions are represented in small numbers: clergy (just under 10%), the military (over 5%), legal, political and administrative (under 4%), and medical (over 2%). In 111 cases one customer subscribed to two of the five publications, and in a further eleven cases one subscriber took three titles. Thomas White, bookseller in Cork, subscribed to four of the five publications.\n\nFive booksellers, including William Flyn, appear on the lists, but with a substantial subscription list capturing most of the interested readers, only small numbers of a work would be taken for a bookseller’s stock. Flyn, as the publisher, often took multiple copies for sale to non-subscribers in his bookshop. He took 21 copies of The history of Hypolitus and 20 copies of James Poulson’s Observations, but just one copy of Rev. Russel’s Works. Poulson’s work was obviously considered likely to be popular, Thomas White, the other undertaker of the edition, took 50 copies. White also took 14 copies of The history of Hypolitus and one copy each of The modern monitor and Rev. Russel’s Works. John Bardin, bookseller in Cork, took 21 copies of The history of Hypolitus and one copy of Rev Russel’s Works. Eugene Daly, bookseller and bookbinder in Cork, took seven copies of The modern monitor, and one copy of The history of Hypolitus.\n\nMany names which appear on the lists are known as book collectors. Dr John Longfield, one of the contributors to The Hibernian Chronicle, subscribed to three of the five publications, and he is known to have subscribed to a range of publications coming from Cork, Dublin and London presses. From a distinguished North Cork family, he practised medicine at Patrick Street, Cork, having qualified at Edinburgh (Longfield 1759). He had a keen interest in the sciences, particularly astronomy and mathematics. He corresponded with the Astronomer Royal, and letters from 1773, 1774 and 1779, on the subject of his observations for determining the latitude and longitude of Cork, were published in The philosophical transactions of the Royal Society (Lecky 1917).He subscribed to such works as Dr John Rutty’s Natural history of the county of Dublin (Dublin, 1772), Joseph Priestley’s History of vision, light and colours (London, 1772), Thomas Sheridan’s General dictionary of the English language (Dublin, 1784), John Hellens’ Mathematical essays (London, 1788), Michael Taylor’s Tables of logarithms (1792) and Beaufort’s Memoir of a map of Ireland (London, 1792). His interests also included poetry, subscribing to J. S. Dodd’s Essays and poems, and James De la Cour’s A prospect of poetry, both published in Cork in 1770, the first by Eugene Swiney and the second by Thomas Lord, and John Leslie’s Killarney, a poem, published in London in 1772.\n\nHenry Sheares, editor of The Hibernian Chronicle, his wife, Jane Anne, and sons Henry and John, were frequent subscribers to literary works published in Cork and Dublin. Henry senior supported several Cork publications, subscribing to James Eyre Weekes’ Poems on several occasions in 1743, Charles Smith’s Antient and present state of the county and city of Cork in 1750, David Fordyce’s Dialogues concerning education in 1755 and J. S. Dodd’s Essays and poems in 1770. Lieutenant, later General, Charles Vallancey, the antiquary and Irish language enthusiast, subscribed to Poulson’s Moral and divine observations. His library of over one thousand lots was sold by auction after his death in 1812 (Vallancey 1813). An army engineer, Vallancey came to Ireland with Lord Townshend to assist in a military survey, he designed the plans for Queen’s Bridge in Dublin and was responsible for fortifications on Spike Island in Cork harbour. He translated two works from French, Essay on fortification (Dublin, 1757) and The field engineer by De Clairac (Dublin, 1760). Another subscriber, Barry Yelverton, later Lord Avonmore, also collected an extensive library in his lifetime (Yelverton 1807). When he subscribed to The history of Hypolitus in 1768 he is listed as barrister-at-law, he went on to become attorney general for Ireland in 1782, and chief baron of the exchequer in 1784.\n\nSeveral well-known county families are in evidence across the lists: Richard and Catherine Boyle, Earl and Countess of Shannon, the leading Protestant family in the county with their seat at Castlemartyr, County Cork, were subscribers. The Earl subscribed to The history of Hypolitus in 1768, and both Earl and Countess subscribed to The works of the Late Rev. George Russel in 1769, this last certainly to support the cause of the rector’s widow and children. They did not subscribe to The modern monitor yet an annotated copy has survived that belonged to the Countess. Lord and Lady Midleton, the Countess of Tyrone, Lord and Lady Blayney, Lord and Lady Kinsale, and Lord Mountcashel represented the aristocracy. Henry Cole Bowen built up a renowned library at his country house, Bowenscourt, County Cork. He and his wife subscribed to The works of the late Rev. George Russel, he had also subscribed to John Rutty’s Essay towards a … history of the mineral waters of Ireland in 1757 and William Temple’s History of the general rebellion in Ireland in 1766. The local administration included the Honourable St John Jefferyes, M.P., Lieutenant Governor of Cork, the Honourable Joseph Lysaght, M.P., Collector of Cork, John Travers, Mayor of Cork, Hugh Carleton, Recorder of Cork, Thomas Brown, Register of Cork, Aldermen John Harding, Philips, Westropp, and Samuel Maylor of Cork, John Newman, Collector of Kinsale, Matthew Pennefeather, Mayor of Cashel, Nicholas Stout, Mayor of Youghal, Richard Harte, Mayor of Limerick, Robert Hallam, Town Clerk of Limerick, and Thomas Dixon, Under-Sheriff of Limerick. In all, the lists represent the professional people, local administration, merchants and tradesmen, the middling and higher clergy, country gentry and members of the local aristocracy. There is evidence for cross-confessional support for these publications consistent with their subject matter.\n\nSubscriptions were put in place to fund a project, half the cost of a work was paid in advance to provide finance, and the remainder was paid when the volume was delivered. For a project with an uncertain market this indemnified the printer against losses and gave them an estimate of the projected audience to enable them to assess the print run. Subscription lists do not give evidence of reading, but purchase of a title shows an area of interest for the subscriber and support for a particular author. Purchasers had the pleasure of seeing their names listed as a permanent record of their support. A higher level of support is shown when a subscriber takes multiple copies. In the case of these five lists we see a group of people who were all, at least once, customers of William Flyn or his agents, spread across the province of Munster. The social composition of a list is of interest, although this can be more difficult to ascertain. Subscription lists are a good source for identifying women book buyers, otherwise largely unknown to us. The geographical distribution of customers, when known, reflects the influence of the author and his or her subscription gatherers, and shows the commercial reach of the printer. Some works are printed ‘for the author’ by a printer, this puts the financial burden on the author, and could point to a subvention or other form of funding needed before a printer would take on a project. Finally a large list of names is always of interest to historians, helping to give depth and complexity to a past society, and to show links and interactions between individuals and families.\n\nNotes:\n\nNote 1. Distribution agents for The Hibernian Chronicle in County Cork in 1770 were Thomas Shea, cooper in Youghal; John Scanlan, teacher and land surveyor in Cloyne; Mr Barry, innkeeper in Midleton; William Hamilton in Midleton; Robert O’Brien, apothecary in Castlemartyr; John Furzer, post master in Kinsale; Kennedy Hayes, post master in Mallow; and James Craswell, merchant in Killarney, County Kerry. By 1772 the towns served were Bandon, Bantry, Berehaven, Buttevant, Castlemartyr, Charleville, Clonakilty, Cloyne, Cobh, Kinsale, Macroom, Mallow, Midleton, Passage, Rosscarbery, Shanagh, Skibereen, Skull and Youghal, County Cork; Limerick city; Lismore and Tallow, County Waterford; Castleisland, Dingle, Killarney and Tralee, County Kerry.\n\nNote 2. Writers who contributed to The modern monitor and who subscribed to multiple copies were Mrs Gray, 6 books, Dr Stack, 6 books, Miss Waterhouse, 3 books, and one each for Dr Longfield, Henry Sheares, Mrs Sheares, and Mrs Stack. Dr Sleigh had died on 10 May 1770 and therefore was not a subscriber.\n\nReferences:\n\nAn abstract of the Doway catechism.
