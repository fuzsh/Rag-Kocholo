        "text": "Henry Beverhout looked out over the West African village of Freetown in 1792 with misgivings. From his own experience and from the complaints he received from other townspeople, he now recognized that the black men and women of Sierra Leone were not being afforded the equal treatment they had been promised. Exploited and discriminated against for most of their lives by white masters in America, these expatriates had arrived in West Africa determined to chart a new course for themselves. But the path to economic, civil, and religious freedom was littered with obstacles. They soon encountered problems with white Sierra Leone Company officials over low pay, high prices, and the slow pace at which land was apportioned to the new settlers. Just as important, the black émigrés were dismayed by the company's system of justice, whose juries Beverhout said did not “haven aney of our own Culler in” them. Having absorbed the British and American legal traditions of trial by a jury of one's peers, he demanded that in any “trial thear should be a jurey of both white and black and all should be equal.” Going even further, he then made the explosive claim that “we have a wright to Chuse men that we think proper to act for us in a reasnenble manner.”\n\n5 The scholarly debate over African cultural retentions in the Americas was initially taken up by Herskovits, Melville J., The Myth of the Negro Past (New York: Harper, 1941)Google Scholar and Frazier, E.

All of these publications were part of a pamphlet war between Hammet, who later split from mainline Methodism, and the American Methodist Episcopal Church.

Some scholars question the sincerity of many early slave conversions to Christianity since most also held onto their ethnic cultures and beliefs simultaneously. This argument is culturally biased given that many Euro-Americans in the eighteenth century maintained non-Christian beliefs in magic but have always been considered “true believers” even though they strayed quite far from Judeo-Christian traditions.\n\n19 Hammet, Hammet's Diary; Reily, D.

Considering the low country's unhealthy disease environment in the eighteenth century, it is remarkable that Coke brought Hammet to Charleston to regain his health.

In Virginia, James O'Kelly also decided to break away from the American Methodist Church, forming the Republican Methodists in 1794. Taking thirty ministers and 20,000 church members with him who also could not abide being ruled over by a bishop, O'Kelly's Virginia Methodists eventually merged with a group of republican-minded Calvinist Baptists from Massachusetts led by Elias Smith in 1809 to form the Disciples of Christ denomination.
