        "text": "BSSCMD Study Day Friday 7 February 2014\n\nCase finishing techniques – 3rd BSSCMD Study Day.\n\nHoliday Inn Welbeck street, London..\n\nWorking on a Multi Disciplinary Basis.\n\nThis meeting was attended by 34 delegates, divided equally between dentists and body therapists. Dr Richard Dean gave an overview of Temporo-Mandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMD) diagnosis and splint construction. Ken Gordon, osteopath, explained his input and the importance of working as a team.\n\nDr Andre Hedger gave an excellent presentation outligning how he selected different medical disciplines to support his work on patients, many of whom had very differing symptoms including TMJ problems and movement disorders.\n\nDr Robert Chatfield followed on with the same emphasis on a multifactorial approach. He works closely with his osteopath & counseller, John Vesey, and craniosacral therapist, Sheila Camino. He explained the four elements that make up the holistic view to treatment, namely, physical, biochemical, electromagnetic and emotional.\n\nThe day finished with a presentation by Dr Richard Casson and his kinesiologist, Katie Rossi. Richard has suffered two strikes in the past two years and it is his determination and Katie’s expertise that has enabled Richard to make a remakable recovery despite hearing disparaging comments from mainstream medical professionals. He was convinced that the patient must want and believe that they can get better before the real healing process can begin.\n\nRichard is to be congratulated for organising yet another very worthwhile study day."
