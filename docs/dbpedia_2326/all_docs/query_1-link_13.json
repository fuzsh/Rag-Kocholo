Rather, the pope wanted to honor priests who have served the church for a long time.\n\n“Each of these senior priests has given extraordinary service, as missionaries and pastors for many years. May God give them many more years of service to His people in Brooklyn and Queens,” said Brooklyn Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio.\n\nREVEREND MONSIGNOR\n\nRICHARD J.
