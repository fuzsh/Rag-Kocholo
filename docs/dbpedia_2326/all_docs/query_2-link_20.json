JUNE 17, 1911.\n\nand father of Sir Ralph the second baronet, whose sister Anne married the Sir Ralph Assheton who was made a baronet (of Middleton) in 1660.\"\n\nThis extract, though somewhat confusing, proves, at least, a relationship between the Asshetons of Middleton and those of Great Lever.\n\nBurke' s ' Landed Gentry ' states that Thomas Ashton of Hatfield Court, co. Here- ford, living in 1875, was the son of the late Samuel Ashton, Esq., of Middleton, near Manchester. This would seem to show that the old Asshetons of Middleton in course of time spelt their name \" Ashton,\" and were represented in lineal descent by (among others) the Ashtons of Hatfield Court, co. Hereford. SUTOCS.\n\nJAMES SHIPDEM, 1688 (US. iii. 407). Godwin Shipdam, chaplain, held a tenement in Bury St. Edmunds, 20 Hen. VI. (Copinger's ' Suffolk Records,' i. 387).\n\nW. B. GERISH.\n\nNo list, I believe, of those who came over with William of Orange is known to be in existence. In a paper in ' Selections from the Harleian Miscellany ' it is esti- mated that the number of troops that landed with William amounted to something less than 24,000 men. These were of a very heterogeneous character. It is hardly likely that even the officers who commanded so large and varied a body of men would be accurately enumerated in any document of the period. T. S. R. W.\n\nBEE-SWARMS (11 S. iii. 406). Many years ago I saw a swarm of bees in church. The south door had been left open for coolness, and during sermon time the bees sailed in and settled on the bonnet of a maiden lady sitting in the same pew as I, immediately under the pulpit. She took off her bonnet, laid it on the seat beside her, gave a reassur- ing nod to the parson, and I doubt whether half a dozen of the scanty congregation knew anything about it. When sermon was over the clerk, to whom the bees belonged, fetched them away in a skep. C. C. B.\n\nMARRIAGE OF DIVORCED PERSONS TEMP. ELIZABETH (11 S. iii. 226). An account of the anomalous state of the law of divorce in the reigns of Edward VI. and Elizabeth, and of the peculiar case of John Stawell's divorce, will be found in the third column of p. 598 of The Athenceum for 27 May.\n\nJOHN B. WAINE WRIGHT.\n\n\" WELCOME AS THE FLOWERS IN MAY \" (11 S. iii. 367, 414). Let us do proper honour to our great patron. Captain Cuttle, apostrophizing Wal'r, declared he was \" welcome to all as knowed you, as the- flowers in May \" (' Dombey and Son/ chap. xlix.). W. C. B.\n\nJOHN VESEY, ARCHBISHOP OF TUAM (US. iii. 429). The Most Rev. John Vesey, D.D., Archbishop of Tuam, married, (1) by licence dated 11 June, 1662, Rebecca Wilson ; (2) Anne, daughter of Col. Agmond- isham Muschamp. See Burke' s ' Peerage,' 1911, p. 586, col. 2 (De Vesci) ; and Lodge's ' Peerage,' 1910, for date of licence.\n\nT. SHEPHERD.\n\nMEW OR MEWES FAMILIES (US. iii. 105, 196). There is a pedigree of Ellis Mews of Stourton Caundle in the Visitation of Hampshire, 1686, at the Heralds' College, A descendant of this Ellis married a St. John, and their son married his first cousin (also a St. John) and assumed by Act of Parlia- ment the surname of St. John in lieu of Mews, on succeeding to the estates of this branch of the great house of St. John. The same -Visitation gives a pedigiee of the St. Johns. SNOOKS ,\n\n\"CAPPING\" AT SCOTTISH UNIVERSITIES (US. iii. 386, 436). BLADUD may be inter- ested in the fact that undergraduates at Coimbra go about bareheaded, and robed in a long flowing vestment which might easily be used as a hood did occasion require it. I believe that these young men have a cap of some kind in their outfit, because I have heard of their \"firing\" articles of that nature on to the stage when they hav been stirred by the charms of an actress or a songstress. I was once much amused to see some Coimbra students dancing after dinner in an hotel, to the strains of a piano which one of their company evoked. They had no feminine friends present, so they performed a Spurgeonesque round dance, and enj oyed it right well.\n\nBoys at Charterhouse are apt to \"cap\" masters by touching the back of their (own) heads. This is because the peak of the cap is so often worn turned away from brow to nape. In Farmer's ' Public School Woid-Book' we have cap (verb) defined as \" To take off or touch one's hat in saluta- tion,\" with the respectable example : \" 1593, H. Smith, 'Serm.' (1871), i. 203 ;> How would they cap me were I in velvets.\"\n\nST. SWITHIN."
