        "text": "The Irish and Ireland in Middle Tennessee – Where to go to learn about Ireland.\n\nMeaití Jó Shéamuis Ó Fátharta is a member of The Irish Gift, a group based in Middle Tennessee that promotes and preserves the Irish culture in this area. The Irish Gift also has a huge online presence as we continue to bring the Irish language, music song and dance to people all over the US and the world.\n\nSit back and relax to enjoy learning about how it was growing up in an Irish-speaking area of Ireland in the 50’s and 60’s.\n\nThe Irish Gift, bringing the Irish to Tennessee!\n\nMeaití Jó Shéamuis Ó Fátharta\n\nIs mise Meaití mac le Jó Shéamuis Ó Fátharta agus le Neain Pheaidí Nic Dhiarmuda ach is fearr liom an leagan áitiúil de m’ainm, Meaití Jó Shéamuis, mar go mbraithim luascadh níos ceolmhaire leis ná an leagan foirmiúil, Máirtín Ó Fátharta.\n\nI introduce myself as Gaeilge in Ireland and also to people worldwide whom I know have Irish connections as on this particular occasion. There may be a small percentage who may know or remember me as Meaití Jó Shéamuis (even Mattie Joe Shéamuis, with or without the surname Ó Fátharta) as I am involved with The Irish Gift and participated in the T-CAIF fest in O’More College, Franklin TN, in 2011 and 2012. I live in the south Connemara Gaeltacht area of County Galway known as Cois Fharraige and in a little townland village called Na hAille.\n\nMusic, Song and Dance in Galway, Ireland\n\nI have seen many changes here and indeed all over the Connemara Gaeltacht area in my time. Firstly, it was a relatively poor, craggy agricultural terrain stretching west from Lough Corrib for about fifty miles to Clifden. But poor as the land may be, it was one of the most beautiful landscapes in the country with Galway Bay on your left, and over looking the north County Clare Coast, the Burren and the three Aran Islands, for half of that journey; then the Carraroe peninsula, with the Isles of Lettermore, Gorumna and Lettermullen connected by bridges for almost the last hundred and fifty years; returning to another peninsula, Muicineach-Idir-Dhá-Sháile, where another bridge will lead you to Camus, Ros Muc, Cill Chiaráin and eventually on to Carna. Although this is a truly quaint and picturesque journey, it is not its physical geographical beauty which contains its most valuable wealth but its vast treasure of folklore, poetry, songs, dance and music which goes back thousands of years.\n\nI consider myself fortunate as one of the last generation born into a house which had all of the above in its natural form, still intact, while growing up here in the fifties and most of the sixties. Ours was a little bigger than an average sized thatched cottage with three bedrooms and a large kitchen, very suitable for half sets, musicians, singers and storytellers. The party nights with a mix of songs and story-telling were a regular occurrence during the long wintry nights. The “Party” otherwise known in the Connemara Gaeltacht as “Na Timeanna” in the houses, consisted of music, dance and song. Many of these took place in my parents home when I was a young boy as they both loved dancing sets and céilí. The music was usually played by my uncle Máirtín, my father’s brother, who had been the resident box player at the céilís in the locality. I remember being so proud the first time I had permission to play with him at one of those “timeanna” in the village!\n\nMy mother’s brothers, who lived in the next village, paid frequent visits and in the winter time sung songs and recounted long stories of Fionn Mac Cumhaill and Fianna Éireann and their incredible heroics against such stalwarts as the Hag of the Burren or the King of the Eastern World. Other nights it would be extraordinary fairy stories or local folklore about the Great Famine, the American Wakes or certain great characters of the area in previous times. It is a pity that there was no facility to record even a fraction of this lore, songs or even the dancing style of the previous generation and particularly the rich natural turn of phrase of our language, totally free of any English influence. Little I thought then that most of those styles and pastimes were bound to disappear along with the vast changes in our native language and people.\n\nSea, ní bheidh a leithéidí siúd arís ann, go cinnte!\n\nTraditional Irish Music From Galway – where to find it online\n\nThe Irish Gift promotes the East Galway music tradition, the Irish language and sean nós singing and dancing. We have close ties to Galway, Ireland as all of our teachers (online and in-person classes) hail from Galway and are an intrinsic part of the traditional Irish music pub-scene in Galway . The sean nós singing and style is from the Connemara region of Galway and the Irish language dialect is Cois Fharraige, Galway. The Irish Gift offers online classes in traditional Irish music from Galway in bodhrán, fiddle, flute and uilleann pipes, sean nós singing and dancing.\n\nThe following article is from Andy Kruspe, a member of The Irish Gift family here in the South (USA) and a student of Jim Higgins who is our bodhrán instructor. Enjoy!\n\nBodhrán In situ in County Galway\n\nAs a music student, my professors would often comment about how experiencing music in situ could change one’s perception of a given work or style. For the past four years, I have been able to experience this dynamic by traveling to Ireland to study the ubiquitous Irish frame drum, the bodhrán. These trips took me to the heart of the Aran Islands Gaeltacht for some of the most memorable moments of my life.\n\nThe Summer School\n\nThe Craiceann Bodhrán Summer School is held the last week of June on the small island of Inis Oírr, County Galway. According to the website , the event began as an “idea of linking the musical heritage of the Aran Islands, with the need for drummers to improve their skills.” This workshop achieves this by bringing some of the world’s best drummers to this amazing island. And this statement is no exaggeration- the list of past and present instructors and clinicians is a “Who’s Who” from the world of Irish Traditional Music. This list includes Cormac Byrne (Uiscedwr), Jim Higgins, Martin O’Neill, Tristan Rosenstock (Téada), and Rolf Wagels (Cara). In addition, it is not unusual to see other well-known players in the many nightly sessions held in the island’s pubs. Some of the master drummers that have made their way to the island include Johnny McDonagh (De Dannan), Eamon Murray (Beoga), and Colm Phelan (Goitse).\n\nIn addition to outstanding instruction, several world class bands perform concerts during the week. Past bands and performers have included Beoga, Frankie Gavin, Goitse, The Mártín O’Connor Band, We Banjo 3, The Evening Report. The result is a great way to see the techniques taught in class applied on the concert stage.\n\nThe Masterclasses\n\nThe first day starts around noon with registration and an audition. The auditions divide the approximately 100 students into six different ability groups. Classes begin that afternoon. Subsequently, the daily schedule went as follows:\n\n10:30a- First Class\n\n11:30a- Tea\n\n11:45a- Lecture and/or Recital\n\n1:00p- Second Class\n\n2:00p- Afternoon Break, Individual Practice\n\n5:00p- Additional Class with Tutor of Choice\n\n6:00p- Break\n\n8:00p- Evening Concert\n\nThe classes meet in the same rooms every day, but the teaching staff rotates. This allows each group to be exposed to a wide range of concepts from several teachers. Masterclass topics include tuning, using the bodhrán tonally as a bass voice within an ensemble, and interpretation of the rhythms found in Irish traditional music.\n\nLectures and mini-recitals are held between the mid-day classes. Lecture topics include the cultural significance of traditional Irish music and performance practices for the various Irish traditional forms and rhythms. Recitals allow the instructors to demonstrate their masterclass topics and techniques in context with a melody player in context.\n\nThe afternoon elective class allows for more exposure to the teaching staff and their respective specialties. These additional classes include topics ranging from Irish bone playing to the use of the bodhrán as a rhythmic voice in Eastern European folk music.\n\nFinally, the day ends with the evening concerts.\n\nThe Sessions – Learning After the School Day\n\nIt is easy to glance at the daily schedule and question why one would travel all the way to Ireland to participate in what amounted to a five hour school day. However, a generous amount of instruction occurs as applied performance in the island’s nightly traditional music sessions. It may be tempting to dismiss these sessions simply as a time of “drinking and playing.” The truth is quite different, however.\n\nOlder players share tips and tricks with younger players. Melody players share tunes and ornamentation ideas. Everyone builds their repertoire of collected tunes. It is common to start these sessions at around 10:30pm and finish around 4:00am to 5:00am. We left tired but always with a little more knowledge…\n\n… and several more friends. Craiceann is a great opportunity to meet others with the same passion for Irish music and culture. Students come from around the world, representing almost every European Union member nation, Israel, and the United States. And thanks to the wonders of social media, it is easy to maintain these friendships.\n\nInis Oírr – At the Heart of the Gaeltacht\n\nInis Oírr is part of the Aran Islands Gaeltacht. One regularly sees Irish in print and hears it in the conversation of the locals. As explained by Liam O’Maonlai, “This is… the language that we dream in.” I think this quote captures just how alive this language and culture are on these islands, and the sequestered nature of this geography allows for one to become totally immersed.\n\nGo. See. Do.\n\nIt is one thing to take lessons for music or a foreign language, but it is another to go where those things are alive and flourishing and experience them first hand. Learning this style of drumming in these surroundings has made me a better drummer. And being able to see this art applied in its intended surroundings has greatly enhanced my understanding of this culture and its music. So if you can, go. You just may end up like me and the other several hundred Craiceannites- “seven days on the island, and 358 wishing that you were back on it.”\n\nFamily Trees: How I Am Finding (And Strengthening) My Irish Roots\n\nBy Kristen\n\nI couldn’t tell you when it started, my seemingly unnatural obsession with all things Irish. I could tell you that it was the first time I saw a book full of pictures of the beautiful landscapes or the first time I heard the enamoring accent or even the first time that I heard rumors of my long-gone family that first came to America from Ireland. I could tell you these things, but they wouldn’t be true. The truth is that it’s been there all along, for as long as I can remember. I think I must have been born with a bit of Ireland in my soul because I felt its pull before I could even locate it on a map.\n\nA few years ago, I got into genealogy. I’ve always been interested in hearing old family stories, but as generations come and go, it is becoming apparent that much of the history of how we came to be is fading into black. The vibrant characters who loved and lost, fought and won, and traveled near and far to eventually bring me into existence are losing their dimensions and simply becoming names on a flat piece of paper. The birth and death dates are easy enough to find. They’re right there on the tombstones, after all, but it’s that dash in between that gets me. What magnitude of stories does that little line contain?\n\nWith this in mind, I set out to find as much as I could about all the people who came before me—not just that they were alive but how they lived. I haven’t been let down. Some lines of research do turn out to be dead ends, but the disappointment is mitigated by the admiration of a relative who was imprisoned for his faith in Scotland or the bravery of a man who set sail from Greece and started over alone in a new country. Every new story was a revelation to me, and each one encouraged me to keep digging, and then I struck gold.\n\nI am royalty.\n\nOkay, okay. Maybe not technically, but I am distantly related to the late Princess Diana and, therefore, her sons and all the generations that will live hereafter. As you may imagine, I was curious to find out what the connection actually was and what circumstances led to two such different outcomes for descendants of the one same person, whoever he or she may have been.\n\nIt turns out that the common denominator is a man called the Most Reverend John Vesey. Princess Diana’s line descended from a son, and mine descended from a daughter. While I was still intrigued by the lineage, what was most exciting to me was that John was Irish! This wasn’t exactly a new finding for me. I had traced some Irish heritage already. What was new was that John was findable and concrete. He was the Archbishop of Tuam at one time, so I can physically go to where he once worshiped and taught. I can go to the university in which he studied. I can find the house and estate that he built, which is at least partially still standing. One day, I plan to do just that.\n\nWhile the individual characters are unique, my story is not. I am only one of an uncountable number of people who are interested in finding out more about their family history, and this seems especially true for my fellow Americans who are often either regaled by legends of some cool ancestor or really have no clue how all the pieces of their puzzles fell into place. Maybe you are one of these people, and maybe you understand what I mean when I say that it is pretty amazing how even just one link to a place can drive you to learn all you can about it, identify with it, sympathize with it, and love it.\n\nI am very interested in all of my family roots, which are also made up of major portions of Greek and German. I love learning about both cultures and take every chance I get to immerse myself in them, but as you have probably already figured out, I feel most drawn to my Irish heritage and really wanted to connect with it in a big way. Part of this for me was a desire to learn Irish. Besides the fact that some of my family most likely spoke it at one time, I also just find it really fun and beautiful.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to learn Irish but have no idea where to begin. If you are not blessed to live in an area with Irish speakers or the availability of classes to attend, you probably think it’s impossible or at least improbable. I did. I tried books and a computer program, and while I did enjoy them and learned from them, there is nothing like having a comhrá (Irish for “conversation”) with other speakers. This is where The Irish Gift comes into play.\n\nI found The Irish Gift in a last effort to find classes near me after multiple previous searches. I really didn’t think it would yield any results, but I typed in my search query, and up popped the site.\n\nThe Irish Gift is made up of a group of very talented people who practice the traditional arts of Ireland. Collectively, they play everything from the uilleann pipes and flute to the bodhran and fiddle. They sing in the sean nós style, and they speak Irish. They see their talents as a gift passed down to them, and their mission is to share it with everyone.\n\nI am currently taking the Beginner Irish Class offered completely online by The Irish Gift. It is a 10 week course delivered once a week through video chat, and more importantly, it’s a lot of fun. The goal is to be fluent in six months, and I feel that we are well on our way to meeting it! If you have not yet learned any Irish but have looked at a text written in it, you may think I’m crazy and that there’s no possible way anyone could learn all that in six months with just one class a week. The truth is, after just one session, you will be motivated to go out and learn on your own.\n\nI read English words with Irish phonetic pronunciation inadvertently now. I watch television shows and documentaries completely in Irish and try to pick out the words I know. I literally have verb conjugation charts handwritten and posted on my wall, and yesterday, I wrote out numbers to over one hundred in Irish just for fun. It gets to you in the best possible way.\n\nIt’s often hard for people to understand why I am learning Irish. In fact, the normal response is, “Isn’t that just English with an Irish accent?” Once they learn that Irish is its own language with its own identity, history, and cultural ties, the next question is usually, “Why don’t you learn a useful language, like Spanish?”\n\nI agree that Spanish is certainly a very well utilized language in our society today, and I find it very beautiful. In fact, it was my language of choice throughout school, and I spent years learning it. However, I can’t say that I personally find Irish any less useful. I can think of exactly zero reasons not to learn it and over 1,774,437 reasons why I should. 1,774,437. That’s how many people ages 3 and up were stated on the last Irish census as able to speak Irish. Theoretically, I could strike up almost two million conversations in Irish! Does that sound useless to you?\n\nNot too long ago, I learned a new word: fernweh. It’s a German word with no exact English translation, but it can generally be thought of as a kind of homesickness for a place you’ve never been. That really resonated with me because it pretty much sums up the way I feel about Ireland. My life’s dream has always been to go there, and when that happens, I’ll be ready. Among my clothes and passport, I’ll be packing up my new Irish skills and taking them along. I may not get to all two million conversations, but I will make sure I get plenty of chances to take what I learn in my informative, stimulating, and often hilarious online classes and practice it in the heart of Irish-speaking country. Sure, my Appalachian dialect may make the words come out a little funny sometimes, and I’ll make mistakes as all language learners do, but if I can have just one friendly conversation with someone willing to let me try my hand at it, that will prove all those people who think this journey is useless wrong. After all, as Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart,” and that is enough for me."
