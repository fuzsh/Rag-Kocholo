It appeared the plaintiff was a servant in the house of the father of defendant, receiving wages of two guineas a yearthe young gentleman had just returned from college, and having become deeply enamoured with his fair desdemona, wrote some very loving letters, which did much more credit to the galantry of his heart than the sagacity of his head it appeared that the birth of a lovely babe was the consequence of the attachment in consequence of the interference of his friends, the young gentleman was induced to give up all hopes of enjoying Miss SULLIVAN as his bride but she was determined not to be treated so cavalierly with impunity, and therefore brought her action. Mr Serjeant M'MAHON, in a very able speech maintained the maid was the seducer and the young man seduced but the jury, it seems, thought otherewise, for they returned a verdict of 100 guineas against the defendantNickR LC1793615NPDTUDORElizabethQueenOn Friday last, in Chester, William John PURDON, of Dublin, Esq.In opening the ground near the Altar, in St. Oswald's for the interment of the remains of the above Gentleman, the lead cofin which encloses the dust of the Lord Chancellor GERADE, was found in a state of preservation scarcely credible, when we say that ir has been ab inhabitant of the peaceful grave 211 years; though from its appearance the eye might be deceived into a belief, that it had not lain there more than as many hours!Lord Chancellor GERADE held the Irish Seals in the reign of Elizabeth.NickR WMT J1828117NPSTUDORHenryKingA stone was lately found in digging the grounds of the Castle of Cloonoona, Banagher, with the following inscription:- Here lyeth the bodies of Elizabeth and Mary Bulleine, daughters of George Bulleine, Esq. who was son of George Viscount Rochford, who was the son of Thomas Bulleine, Earl of Ormond and Wiltshire. Note.- Thomas Bulleine, Earl of Ormond and Wiltshire, was the father of Anne Bulleine, Queen to King Henry tudor the Eighth, who died 1538. Geo.
