        "text": "Dr John Potter Click to enlarge\n\nArchælogicæ Græcæ\n\nArchbishop Potter\n\nletter 7Jun1743\n\n1 Dr John POTTER DD; b.1674 d.10Oct1747 Lambeth, England. Archbishop of Canterbury 1737-1747. · Son of Thomas POTTER (Wakefield, Yorkshire Presbyterian Linen Draper [404] [880]). John's Wakefield childhood home is now the Black Rock Hotel in the Market Place. However, a story is related in the Church of England magazine of John's father being \"a poor farmer in Oxfordshire\" and how John invited his father - a \"venerable-looking man\" - to give his blessing to a group of noblemen. [881] · John attended Oxford University from age 14, obtaining his BA in 1692, MA in 1694, BD in 1704, Fellow of Lincoln College 1694 and Doctor of Divinity (DD) 1706. Doctor of Divinity (DD) 1706. · Took Holy Orders 1698 [407] and was ordained Deacon 1698, Priest in 1699, Domestic Chaplain to Archbishop Tenison 1704 and later Chaplain to Queen Anne, also regius Professor of Divinity, Canon of Christ Church, Oxford (1708), then Bishop of Oxford (1715) and finally Archbishop of Canterbury 1737. · Also see Comment 1 (Dr Potter's appoinment to the Primacy). · His Theological Works were published in 3 vols. [163] and include \"Archælogicæ Græcæ\" [Antiquities of Greece] (1697-99) [762], \"Discourse of Church Government Wherein the Rights of the Church and the Supremacy of Christian Princes are Vindicated and Adjusted\" London, 1707. · Not surprisingly, many considered him boring and the translation into Latin of his coronation sermon (preached on the acession of George II) was one of the standard punishments given at Corpus Christi College in 1893! [403] · Others saw his unexciting personality as an asset: he \"maintained the rights of the church with sufficient firmness and dignity, without having recourse to the brash and offensive measures which characterised many of his predecessors\" [508] · A notable Whig, but opposed to Bishop Hoadly who was \"was more concerned on account of this adversary than of any other with whom he had been engaged\" [649] · Appears to have had extensive holdings in Bedfordshire (Felmersham, Houghton Conquest, Haynes Park) [345] [346] · Modern scholars have accused him of obtaining wealth \"from the proceeds of his office\" [403] and also of pride and hauteur, but there is no ground for concluding that he did more than sustain his high office with the dignity and decorum it required.[164] · It is recorded that a John Potter built the Little Theatre in the Haymarket in 1720 but the assumption this was our John Potter is incorrect, despite the Greek style. It was a carpenter named John Potter who actually built it [376]. This John Potter died 1754 not 1747 [648]. · Also see Comment 2 (Dr Potter's relation to Methodism and the mode of his death). · Buried at Croydon Parish Church, St John the Baptist, 27Oct1747 with the following inscription: \"Here lieth the body of the most Reverend John Potter, D.D., Archbishop of Canterbury, who died Oct. 10th, 1747, in the 74th year of his age\" [164] An \"aternative epitaph\" was recorded in a letter from Mr. Martyn to a Dr. Birch: \"Alack and well-a-day Potter himself is turned to clay.\" [187] · Arms: Sable, a fess ermine between three cinquefoils argent + Elizabeth VENNER b.1693; m.14Jun1709 (St Paul's Cathedral, London); d.1744 [412] Mrs Potter was described as a \"very handsome woman\" [412] Elizabeth was the daughter of Elizabeth GARDINER (b~1673; d.9May1723) and the infamous Colonel Samuel VENNER (b.Feb1647; d.13Sep1712) [461] [464]. This was considered a rather \"scanalous match\", as the Colonel had not only commanded the \"Red Regiment\" in the 1685 Monmouth Rebellion [463] [873], but was the son of the infamous Thomas VENNER. [404] [407] (of \"Venner's Rising\" Jan1-4 1661 against the new central government of Charles II). Thomas was hung, drawn & quartered 19Jan1661. - see The Venners' Insurrections (ie both Venner's Rising [Thos] and the Monmouth Rebellion [Sam]). · John and Elizabeth married 14Jun1709 [891] \"soon after his appointment to the Divinity Professorship\" (1708) [164] and they went on to have a large family of 10 [412] but only two sons and two (actually 3) daughters survived him [404]\n\nThomas Venner, \"Plotter\"\n\nJohn Potter 1713-1770\n\n2 John POTTER b.4Oct1713; d.20Sept1770 [1st son] See John below 2 Thomas POTTER MP b.28Jul1718 [124], [185], d.17Jun1759 [173], [185], [192], [405] at his favourite residence of Segenhoe Manor, Ridgmont, near Woburn, Bedfordshire [409] · \"Wit and politician\", living at 31 Grosvenor Square 1753-6 [201] · Barrister; admitted to the Middle Temple Bar in 1740. · Member of Parliament for St. Germans (Cornwall) 1747-54 [177c] [174], · Appointed secretary to Frederick, Prince of Wales 1748-51. [185] [401] [502] · Noted by Horace Walpole as a \"very able speaker...matching...against Mr Pitt\" [185]. · In 1751(3) he introduced a Bill to the House of Commons to hold a census. · See Comment 3 (Potter: Proposal for a UK census). · MP for Aylesbury (Buckinghamshire) 1754 [177a], re-elected to Aylesbury in 1756 after appointment as Paymaster-General of the Land Forces 1756-7 [175] [176] · MP for Okehampton (Oakhamptom) (Devon) in 1757-9 [177b] [401] when he was also appointed joint vice-treasurer of Ireland. · A Governor of the Foundling Hospital [503] and given to acts of Charity [763]. · However, most historical interest has centred on his membership of the infamous Hell-Fire Club. · See Comment 2 (Thomas Potter: Hell-Fire Club & ribald writing). · \"Thomas [was] a man of fashion, exceedingly handsome, a wit, an orator and a notorious libertine\" [403] and \"Potter was a great deal more handsome than is good for a man, and was blessed with brains of an uncommon order. The combination proved too heady a draught, especially when fortified by a large income. [505] · He inherited his father's large fortune but \"It was not a case of virtue rewarded. His elder brother John emulated his father as an earnest and able clergyman, but he had married a serving-maid, an offence sufficiently grave to cause the Archbishop to disinherit him.\" [503] · Charles Churchill claimed that Thomas was disinherited by his father \"on account of his dissolute life\" [169], and some US sources thought he may have been given a stipend to move to America [172], but there is no evidence for this but there is evidence for a Potter decsended from the Archbishop emigrating. · It appears that a Potter gene for macular degeneration went to America [172]. It is interesting that the Archbishop was also \"suffered from a severe affection of the eyes\" [404] · On the other hand, John Potter's Will did leave Thomas the Bates Manor which passed to Thomas' son Thomas and the Archbishop left him all his personal property, which was variously estimated to the amount to between £70,000 and £90,000 [405] [407] · However, the will was contested by John and others and despite reading the Judges descision, I am none the wiser! See [506] & [509]. · Thomas didn't have his inheritance without some obligations. Apparently the Archbishop \"obliged him to marry\" the daughter of Dr Manningham [404] [422]. Thomas allegedly bullied her into an early grave and in a letter to John Wilkes stated \"whither I am hurrying from the ...loathsome bawdy of the Nurses, the solemn and hideous Lullabies of my Mother-in-Law and the odious Yell of a young female Yahoo that thrust herself into the world yesterday.\" [206] · Thomas suffered from \"chronic digestive afflictions, aggrevated by painful bouts of venereal and other urethral diseases, which would lead to his death in 1759 at the age of forty-one.\" [503] +(1) Anne MANNINGHAM b.1716; m.17Feb1740; [1546] d.4Jan1744; [Dau of Dr Rev.

Thomas owned it from 1761 until 1763 when it was sold to William BECKFORD, who was Lord Mayor of London. [205] The manor of Britens alias Grove Manor (Houghton Conquest) also passed to Thomas when his father died in 1759, who became Lord of the manor in 1761. He then died without issue and the property passed to his half-sister Mariana, the wife of Dr Malcolm MacQueen (living there in 1810) [346]. 3 daughter POTTER ?d.y.

It is therefore possible that some Potters tracing their ancestry to the Archbishop were not descended from the sons John & Thomas, but perhaps from his daughters Elizabeth Tenison, Martha Sayer, Mary Tanner or Edith Milles. If this were true, my best guess would be the child of Elizabeth who had every reason to reject his father. However as the Archbishop's fortune was inherited by his second son Thomas, then his son Thomas and when that Thomas died childless by his half sister, Mariana MacQUEEN, (grand-daughter of the Archbishop), so this theory is unlikely to be true.\n\nTo see my best guess go to Who was the father of John Theophilus?\n\n3 John POTTER b~1740 d.1816 [193] [?? = son of 1st wife or more probably son of a Potter daughter who changed his name!?] + unknown 4 John POTTER b.1760 d.s.p.1816 4 William POTTER b.1761 d.s.p.1821 4 Robert POTTER b.1762 d.s.p.1802 4 Nathaniel POTTER b.1763 d.s.p.1844/5 4 Thomas POTTER b.1771 d.1822 + unknown 5 William POTTER b.1798 d~1834 + unknown 6 Thomas POTTER b~1822 d.1894 + Mary Hannah (Ann) BROWN 7 Richard John POTTER b.1849 d.1927 + Elizabeth Caroline HISCOCK m.1868 (Bethnal Green) 8 eleven daughters and one son including: 8 Richard Robert POTTER b.Q2 1868; d.Q3 1909 (both Bethnal Green London) + Priscilla SUMPTER b.Q4 1868 (Billinghay, Lincolnshire); d.Q4 1936 (Pancras, London) [dau of Louisa (Lucy) SUMPTER (1847-1876)]\n\nCecil N Potter\n\n9 Cecil Norman POTTER OBE b.21Mar1892 (Earls Court, Kinsington); d.Q3 1979 (Ealing) The OBE for his services to the Scouting movement [194], Also pioneer in aerial & Xray photography See CNPotter.html for more. 9 William Gordon POTTER b.1896; d.WWI 9 Ronald POTTER b.1898; d.1969 9 Ivy Gwendoline POTTER b.1907 d.1993 9 Violet Priscilla POTTER b.1893 d.1986 + Walter YOUNG 10 Dennis YOUNG + Barbara 11 Kevin YOUNG 11 Brian YOUNG 10 Gerald (\"Gerry\") Cecil YOUNG b.9Apr1930 + Megan 11 Adrienne YOUNG 11 Clifford YOUNG 11 Heather 10 Maureen Violet YOUNG b.1922 d.1987 + Albert Henry STANDEN b.1922 d.1975 view family (?p/w problem) 8 James Thomas POTTER b.Q4 1869 (Bethnal Green) + Kate Elizabeth KNOWLES m.1892 (Hampstead, London) 8 Elizabeth Agnes POTTER b.5Jul1872; d.3Sep1952 + Alfred James TIDBURY b.1876 (Shrubs Hill, Surrey); m.2May1898 (Westminster, London) 9 John David TIDBURY b.1898; d.1964 9 Alfred George TIDBURY b.1901; d.1963 8 John Joseph William Potter b.2Nov1874 (Bethnal Green) - Unknown + Priscilla JONES b.1877/8; m.1903 9 Maud Gwendoline POTTER b.Q4 1905 (Medway, Kent);d.1918 9 Eric John Daniel POTTER b.1912 (Wandsworth, London); d.1980 (Winchester)\n\nEleanor F Potter\n\nAlfred BAINDBRIDGE\n\nIris Richards family\n\n8 Eleanor Florence POTTER b.1876 [192] [193] + Alfred BAINDBRIDGE b.21Jan1877 (Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne) m.18Aug1900 (Edmonton); d.9Mar1944 (Randwick, NSW) Occ.

Rector/Vicar of Chiddingstone [376] 1742-7 [879], Archdeacon of Oxford 1741-1766 [879] and Dean of Canterbury 1766-1770. [694] [189] [879] John had annoyed his father by marrying a domestic servant [404] [764], so he was apparently disinherited (apart from \"benefices\"), and so the manor of BRITENS alias GROVE MANOR and other property was left to Thomas [347]. However, he was \"liberally provided for by his father, according to the custom of the day, with Church preferment\" [404], which after serving the Vicarage of Blackburne (Lancashire) then the \"valuable sinecure\" of Elme-cum-Emmett in the Isle of Ely (1739) included progress to the station of Archdeacon of Oxford 1741-1767 and Dean of Canterbury 1766-1770. [189] [404] [189] He was also held the \"benefices\" of the Vicarage of Lydd and also Wrotham (both in Kent), which were greater than the accepted 30 miles apart (a fact successfully used by another dispensation applicant with holding 40 miles apart). Tradition has the Archbishop known for his \"pride and hauteur\" so disgusted with John's marriage to a servant that he was totally disinherited yet he remains in Dr Potter's last will... \"To my eldest son Mr Potter, Archdeacon of Oxford, to my sons-in-law the husbands of my daughters...\" [Will dated 12 August 1745] [178] History has not been kind to John - \"Dr. Potter was a man of no mark whatever\" [406] In 1750 John donated the 1744 Oil on canvas painting by Thomas Hudson of his father, the Archbishop of Canterbury (then the Bishop of Oxford) to the Oxford University. + Martha PERCIVAL [1038] [694] a domestic servant (bedmaker) [409] in the household at Lambeth, apparently seduced by John \"and lo, she was with child\" [770] b.1705 [1549]; d.1775 aged 70 (Canterbury) [694] [694a] Unkown parents but sister of William PERCIVAL and another brother and sister [1038] [1561] 3 John POTTER b~1740; d.1740 (both Blackburn LAN) bur.8Nov1740 3 David POTTER b.1740 [1550]; d.1844 (aged 83 + ___ 4 Hannah Ann Potter b.1761 (\"Foreign Parts\"); d.Q3 1844 (Richmond, Surrey) + David MacKINNEY b.1765 (?Ireland); d.1844 5 Six MacKINNEY children 3 John POTTER bapt.5May1742 [408] d.1745 (Cant.

John Theo POTTER (see signature below); Theo POTTER [887] and Theophilus John POTTER [1551]. Unproven as son of John POTTER (1713-1770) although a number of genealogies list him as such. [1548] [1561]\n\nWho was the father of John Theophilus Potter?\n\nJohn Theo has been assumed (with oral evidence support) to have been a grandson of the Archbishop.\n\nThe best theory to date is that he could be an illegitimate son of either Dean John Potter [1038] or more likely of his wayward brother Thomas Potter MP who did spend some time in Dublin including being eventually appointed Joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland 1757, not to mention his history of fathering illegitimate children [1555] [1556].\n\nPROFILE ➣ Handsome Smart Imaginative Artistic Amorous Thomas ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ John ❌ ❌ ❌ ❌ ❌ John Theo ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔\n\nSo a bit of amature profiling above strongly implicates Thomas over John as the culprit! Also if this theory is correct, it would explain the lack of any baptisimal record of the father of John Theophilus, and the double reference to the Archbishop in his given names....and the 17 plus children!\n\nA less likely, but still possible theory is that he was a son of one of the Archbishop's daughters, as the retention of the Potter surname was a condition the Archbishop placed on receiving any inheritance [769]. The only daughter of the Archbishop this could reasonably be would be Martha Sayer whose husband had to \"retire\" to Brussels because of \"embarrassed circumstances\" including infidelity, so taking on the Potter surname would make sense. Modern genetic studies of a Potter (direct descendant) could help sort out this possibility.\n\nOf intertest, there is an historical novel loosly based on the said John Theophilus Potter by Patricia Watkins titled \"The Wayward Gentleman: John Theophilus Potter & The Town of Haverfordwest - A biographical historical saga\" [1151] A description of Patricia Watkins' research is available online [1538] Occ.
