        "text": "On Wendy's Old Swan thread ( https://birminghamhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?threads/the-old-swan.8314/) , she posted a splendid 1896 picture of \"The Old Swan\" in Sutton Coldfield, with Bishop Vesey's Grammar School (BVGS) looming above and behind. Since BVGS was \"my\" school for nearly four years (1961-1964), that picture brought back lots of memories (both good and bad!). Further research on the good Bishop and the school he founded in the 16th century is revealing a very interesting story. So I am beginning this thread for a fuller discussion of the subject.\n\nI will be posting from time to time on some of the historical (and other) aspects of the topic. All contributions are very welcome, especially from former students (\"Old Veseyans\"), staff, parents and visitors.\n\nTo start the ball rolling, pictured below are:y!).\n\n[1] John Oswald Newton (born 1924), who was at BVGS in 1934-1940. He is pictured in school uniform in 1934. He later (1970) became head of the Department of Nuclear Physics at the Australian National University.\n\n[2] Cat Deeley (born 1976), who was at BVGS in 1993. She is well known as a model, actress and TV presenter.​\n\nAttachments\n\nJohn Oswald Newton as schoolboy.jpg\n\n[I'll deal with James Eccleston now, since his story is interesting.]\n\nJames Eccleston (c 1817-1850; sometimes spelled \"Ecclestone\") graduated Bachelor or Arts from Trinity College, Dublin. He was appointed headmaster of BVGS (then called Sutton Coldfield Grammar School) in 1842 while still in his twenties. He was a classical scholar and an historian, and in 1847 published An Introduction to English Antiquities (London: Longman and Co, 1847). Whether or not he was in real danger of imprisonment for debt (as Wikipedia alleges), he certainly experienced financial difficulties, as the following report explains:\n\nLondon Gazette (19 June 1849).\n\nThe following PRISONERS, whose Estates and Effects have been vested in the Provisional Assignee by Order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors, and whose Petitions and Schedules, duly filed, have been severally referred and transmitted to the County Courts hereinafter mentioned, pursuant to the Statute in that behalf, are ordered to be brought up before the Judges of the said Courts respectively, as herein set forth, to be dealt with according to Law: ... Before the Judge of the County Court of Warwickshire, holden at Warwick, on Friday the 29th day of June 1849. James Eccleston, of Sutton, in the county of Warwick, Schoolmaster.​\n\nLater in 1849 he was appointed rector (headmaster) of the High School of Hobart Town (in place of James Anthony Froude who was in trouble for publishing an \"infidel book\" entitled The Nemesis of Faith). Eccleston arrived with his family at Hobart aboard the \"Success\" on 20 November 1849. Scarcely had the school year begun when James Eccleston died of \"brain fever\" on 8 March 1850. His funeral procession was a grand affair, attended by 47 carriages, and he was interred in St Johns churchyard, New Town, Hobart. He left a wife and two or three children, for whose benefit £1,000 was subscribed by the public.\n\n[Source: Hobart newspapers, National Library of Australia website.]\n\nPictured below:\n\n[1] His headstone in St Johns cemetery, New Town, Hobart. It is not very legible, but appears to read:\n\nErected by the Council of the High School of Hobart Town to the memory of James Eccleston B A, Rector of the High School, who departed this life on the 8th March 1850, Aged 32 Years.​\n\n[2] A transcription of a memorial stone in Sutton Coldfield churchyard (which gives his age as 34). Two children who predeceased him are apparently buried there. [Notes and Queries 5 July 1902.]​\n\nBishop Who?\n\nThe eponym and founder of BVGS is today known as John Vesey (c 1462-1554), but his family name was Harman or Hermon. The origin of the name \"Vesey\" is something of a mystery. Many sources refer to his father as \"William Harman alias Vesey\" or something similar, but the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) states:\n\n[John Harman's] adoption of the surname Veysey dates from about this time [1498], perhaps as a compliment to John Veysey (died 1492), an Oxford graduate and London city rector, who came from the west midlands and whose will made bequests to Harman and to his brother.​\n\nObserve that ODNB spells the name \"Veysey\", but nearly all other modern sources have \"Vesey\". The name has appeared in many other forms over the years, including: Veisy, Vesey, Vesy, Veysey, Veysy and Voysey.\n\nBishop Vesey of Exeter is fondly remembered by Suttonians for his generosity to his birthplace. He was also very kind to his family. ODNB again:\n\nThe bishop was closely attached to his family and to his birthplace. He promoted his sisters' sons, John Gibbons (died 1537) and William Leveson (died 1582), to the chancellorship of Exeter Cathedral and, in Gibbons's case, to be his vicar-general. A third relative, William Veysey (died circa 1545), was made apparitor-general of the diocese, a fourth, Henry Squier (died 1582), archdeacon of Barnstaple, and another connection, James Leveson, farmed the revenues of the church of Wolverhampton. Veysey was also a notable benefactor of Sutton Coldfield. In 1528 he secured for the town royal grants of corporate status and of the nearby free chase and park, in return for an annual rent of £58. He improved the parish church with new nave aisles, chancel chapels, organs, and a steeple. He gave a meadow to support fifteen poor widows and, between 1540 and 1543, endowed a free grammar school. He also built the moot hall and prison, laid out the market place, paved the town, gave pasturage in the chase to the local poor, erected fifty-one stone houses, and provided new bridges at Curdworth and Water Orton. Moor Hall was reconstituted as a brick house for his own residence, which passed after his death to John, the eldest son of his brother Hugh. He further attempted to establish the manufacture of Devonshire kerseys in Sutton, but this, according to his younger contemporary the Exeter historian John Hooker, \"in the end came to small effect\".​\n\nThis account dates the establishment of BVGS to 1540-1543, as opposed to many sources which give 1527. On this point, I believe that ODNB is correct.\n\n[More to come.]\n\nWhen was BVGS founded?\n\nThe BVGS website announces \"Founded 1527\", and this date is commonly repeated. According to Wikipedia:\n\nThe first foundation deed set up by Bishop John Vesey in 1527 provided an endowment from property income of £7 a year and twenty-one people were appointed Trustees to manage the school and pay a fit and proper person to teach Grammar and Rhetoric.​\n\nThe original trustees were lax in their duties, and nothing happened for many years. Dugdale (1656) continues the story:\n\nAnd whereas by the said feoffees not performance of what was so ordained, and for certain other causes, the said settlement thereof became void in law, he being in full power to dispose otherwise of the same, out of his wonted pious regard to the publick benefit of the commonwealth, and this his native country, made a feoffment of divers lands, lying within the precincts of this parish, unto the Warden and Fellowship of Sutton, bearing date 1 October 1543 to the intent that the said Warden and Fellowship, and their successors, with the profits thence arising, should find a certain learned layman fit and skilful to teach grammar and rhetoric, within the same parish; who together with his scholars ought daily to say the psalm of De Profundis for the souls of their benefactors: and if such person could not be found, then to provide certain skilful artificers to teach their trades as abovesaid, or to distribute the rents and profits of those lands, for the discharge of tallage, taxes, or other impositions made by the King's authority, upon the poor people of the parish; or else to be employed for the marriage of poor maidens, or orphans, or to some other charitable secular use, within this Lordship of Sutton. Whereupon the said Warden and Fellowship, by their public instrument dated 6 April 1544, constituted one John Savage schoolmaster there for life, granting him an annuity of ten pounds per annum issuing out of those lands.​\n\n(Wikipedia dates these events to 1540.)\n\nJohn Leland, who travelled through Sutton at some time in 1535-1543 (it would be nice to know the exact year he was there), wrote in his Itinerary:\n\nThe byshope hathe also institutyd there a gramer-schole and endweyd it with lands.​\n\nLeland spells \"Sutton\" five different ways (Southeton, Southetonne, Southton, Southtown, Sowthtowne) and \"Coldfield\" three (Colfeld, Colefeeld, Colefeld) in the space of a few pages! His most complete form of the name of the town is \"Southeton apon Colefeeld\".\n\nThe Second Headmaster of BVGS.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) contains this biography of the second (head)master of BVGS:\n\nLaurence Nowell (c 1516 – 1576) was the third son of John Nowell (died 1526) of Read Hall, Whalley, Lancashire, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Kay of Rochdale. After entering Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1536, he migrated to Cambridge University to study logic, graduating BA in 1542. Oxford incorporated this BA and awarded him an MA in 1544. Two years later he became master of the grammar school at Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire. In 1550 the town's corporation, as the school's patrons, charged him in chancery with neglect of duty, but he appealed to the privy council, which issued an order forbidding the warden and fellowship of Sutton to remove him from office. In November 1550 Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, ordained him deacon. Upon Queen Mary's accession he took shelter with Sir John Perrot in Pembrokeshire and later joined his brother Alexander Nowell on the continent, though it is not known where Laurence finally took refuge. In 1558, when he returned home, he was promoted archdeacon of Derby, and in 1560 dean of Lichfield. In the convocation of 1563 he voted with Alexander, now dean of St Paul's, to modify church ceremonies. That year he obtained the prebend of Ferring in Chichester Cathedral and the rectories of Haughton and Drayton Basset in Staffordshire. In 1566 he received a prebend in York Minster, and in 1567 pleaded with Archbishop Matthew Parker on behalf of two nonconformists.\n\nNowell married Mary Glover, a widow with two sons, and between 1567 and 1574 they had four daughters and five sons, including his namesake heir who matriculated at Brasenose College in 1590. With Alexander, Laurence served as executor of their brother Robert's will in 1569. The next year, he denied the charge of Peter Morwent, a prebendary of Lichfield, that he had made seditious speeches against Queen Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. In 1575 he bought an estate in Sheldon and some lands in Coleshill, Warwickshire. In his will, dated 17 October 1576, he named Alexander and his half-brother John Towneley his overseers. He was dead by 22 November, when his successor as dean, George Boleyn, was installed. He was probably buried at Weston, Derbyshire.​\n\nWilliam Dugdale (1656) dates his demise as headmaster to 1547 rather than 1550 and adds some interesting details:\n\n[It] seems that his dexterity and diligence in teaching scholars, fell far short of what they expected; for it appears that soon after his settling here [Sutton], the Corporation took great exceptions at him for the neglect of his school, and exhibited articles against him in the Chancery; whereupon, after the sitting of a Commission, and sundry depositions taken, he procured letters from the Council Table, admonishing them that they should not go about his removal, except any notable crime could be proved against him; so that in conclusion, finding such slender esteem amongst them, he accepted of his arrears, and a gratuity of ten pounds, whereof the said Bishop of Exeter gave five marks; and in 1547 resigned; so that his stay in this place, was not much more than a year.​\n\n[We should probably accept ODNB's date of 1550, because it was Retha Warnicke (the author of the ODNB biography) who in the 1970s first disentangled the story of our Laurence Nowell from that of his better known namesake cousin Laurence Nowell (c 1515 – c 1571). This cousin was a pioneering scholar of the Old English language, and the earliest known owner (from 1563) of the only surviving manuscript (the Nowell Codex or more formally Cotton Vitellius A.xv) containing the Old English poem Beowulf.]\n\nG J Cross (BVGS headmaster from 1947).\n\nDuring my time at BVGS (1961 – 1964), the man very much in charge was Geoffrey John Cross (2 February 1910 – 1999). I remember him very well, as he once had occasion to give me four of the best on the backside for stealing a stick of solder from the metalwork room. The punishment was effective: I never stole solder again! Here is a short sketch of his life and career, based on what I have been able to glean from internet sources. As usual, corrections and additions are welcome.\n\nG J Cross was the son of Francis John Kynaston Cross (1865 – 31 December 1950) and Eleanor Mary Cross née Phillimore (4 February 1876 – 1949), who were married on 17 September 1895. His siblings were: Philip Kynaston Cross (1898 – 1949); Michael Robert Cross (1899 – 23 March 1969); Christopher Cross (born 1902); and Hannah Cross (1908 – 2008), a successful barrister.\n\nHe was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford. He taught classics and English at Manchester Grammar School 1932 – 1941. He was headmaster at the King's School, Ely, Cambridgeshire, 1942 – 1946, and began his appointment as headmaster of BVGS in 1947. Later he was chairman of the Oxfordshire Education Committee.\n\nHe was the author of: The Triumph of Athens (1935); Prologue and Epilogue to Hegel (1937); First Form Latin (1937); Second Form Latin (1937); Third Form Latin (1938); and The Meaning of the Crucifixion (1940). Apparently his Latin textbooks were quite progressive for their time, and included crosswords and a serialized murder mystery!​\n\n[Can anyone find a picture of Mr Cross? Added note: see post #33.]"
