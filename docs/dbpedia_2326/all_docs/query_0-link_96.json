        "text": "Introduction:\n\nIrish Catholic printers and booksellers worked under legal and social constraints in the eighteenth century, and they sometimes struggled to find a successful business model. They were denied full membership of the Guild of St Luke the Evangelist, the guild of cutlers, paper stainers and stationers. Although permitted to become quarter brothers, they paid high quarterage fees, but they could not vote or hold office within the guild, nor become freemen of the city. In the early century Catholic booksellers congregated in the High Street / Bridge Street area of Dublin, specialising in the production and sale of cheap pamphlets, song books, devotional literature and school books. Catholic devotional literature was banned under the penal laws, so the distributors needed to remain low key, and works of Catholic interest were sold as part of their stock of cheap pamphlets. The penal laws were unevenly enforced throughout the eighteenth century, but Catholic printers and booksellers continued to trade on the edge of the law. They formed networks of co-operation among themselves around the country, supplying the country trade, selling wholesale and retail to chapmen and country merchants. Some chose to set up new businesses in the country towns, often bringing the first dedicated bookshops and printing enterprises to those towns.\n\nCork had a number of successful Catholic printers and booksellers during the eighteenth century, notably Eugene Swiney (1753-1777), William Flyn (1764-1801), James Haly (1789-1812) and Michael Harris (1794-1802). In a predominantly Protestant city, these booksellers did not operate on the margins, they had shops in prominent areas in Castle Street, Paul Street, and on Main Street. They worked with printers and booksellers of other political and religious affiliations and their enterprises were long lived. They traded in works of Catholic interest, but they also produced and supplied mainstream literature. Other Catholic booksellers, such as Patrick Lord and Thomas Lord, worked for a short time in Cork before moving on to other towns.\n\nPatrick Lord (1743-1785)\n\nPatrick Lord began his career in Dublin, petitioning for admittance as quarter brother to the guild in 1743 (Pollard 2000). He worked as bookseller, bookbinder and copper plate printer at the Angel and Bible in Cook Street, near Bridge Street. He published a number of works of Catholic interest, his first a subscription edition of a Catholic text, The paradise of the soul of a true Christian, in 1750. His more risky publications of Charles Oâ€™Conorâ€™s The case of the Roman Catholics of Ireland in 1755 and Henry Brookeâ€™s The farmerâ€™s case of the Roman Catholics of Ireland (1760), as well as courting trouble with the authorities, also proved a financially losing enterprise (Wall 1958). He supplied books, devotional works and pamphlets to country merchants. He moved to Cork in 1766 and his premises in Cook Street, Dublin, was advertised to let (Dublin Mercury, 18 Apr 1767). He set up his business as bookseller, bookbinder and stationer in North Main Street, Cork, near St Peterâ€™s church (Cork Evening Post, 21 Apr 1766). In September of that year he advertised for an apprentice to the bookselling and bookbinding business (Corke Journal, 29 Sep-2 Oct 1766). He offered an extensive range of books by wholesale and retail â€˜bibles, testaments, common prayers, weeks preparations, with most kinds of spiritual books, together with variety of novels, histories, spelling books, reading made easy and primmersâ€™ as well as stationery and music. He offered bookbinding and copper plate printing done â€˜in the neatest mannerâ€™. In April 1769 he announced his move from Main Street to Paul Street, near the Custom House, opposite Mr Goolds, merchant, where he sold books wholesale and retail, carried out book binding and copper-plate printing (Hibernian Chronicle, 20 Apr 1769). The supply of cheap literature, often of Catholic interest, remained a staple element of his trade after his removal from Dublin. Patrickâ€™s son, Thomas Lord, moved to Cork with him and Thomas set up business on his own account in Castle Street, in the heart of the city, near Patrickâ€™s business in Main Street and Paul Street.\n\nJohn Rocque, Map of Cork city, 1759, detail showing North Main Street and St Peterâ€™s church. Cork Evening Post, 21 Apr 1766, advertisement.\n\nTwo years later Patrick had moved to Waterford, where he opened his bookshop in Broad Street, retaining his shop sign of the Angel and Bible. Waterford was well served with bookshops at this period. The long established firm of Hugh and James Ramsey had been printing and selling books on The Quay in Waterford since 1740, and were proprietors and printers of the widely distributed Waterford Chronicle from 1765. They were prominent figures involved with the commercial and administrative elite of the city, James becoming alderman and sheriff of the city, and later, in 1790-1791, lord mayor (See â€˜Hugh and James Ramsey: entrepreneurs and civic leaders in 18th-century Waterfordâ€™, mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com). John Botham came from Dublin as apprentice to Thomas Richey in 1764, Richey returned to Dublin two years later and John Botham stayed on in Waterford as printer and bookseller in Patrick Street, he was succeeded by his son, John, who ran the business until his death in 1805 (Hibernian Magazine, Aug 1805, p. 511). Esther Crawley and her son John were in business at Euclidâ€™s Head in Peter Street from 1764 until the late 1780s, they were printers and booksellers and proprietors of the Waterford Journal.\n\nCharles Smith, The antient and present state of Waterford (1746), perspective view.\n\nPatrick Lordâ€™s business was of a different order, he may have filled the space occupied by Catholic booksellers John Maguire and Jeremiah Calwell in the 1750s. Calwellâ€™s bookshop, The Bible, in Broad Street, had supplied the Catholic market for twenty years from about 1747. While still trading in Dublin, Patrick had collaborated with Jer Calwell in Waterford. In 1751 they cooperated on a project to publish by subscription of The assertion and defence of the seven sacraments by Henry VIII King of England, against Martin Luther. The advertisement was carried at the back of Calwellâ€™s printing of The oeconomy of human life (Hill 1751). No copies of the Lord edition of the Assertion have survived, two Dublin editions were published, one by James Griffen about 1765, and another styling itself â€˜the first Irish editionâ€™ printed by subscription by James Byrn the following year. Lordâ€™s project may not have gained enough support to continue, and it is notable that he subscribed to 25 copies of the Byrn edition in 1766. In January 1771, after his move to Waterford, Patrick opened a subscription for printing The paradise of the soul, subscription to cost a British shilling (Waterford Chronicle, 18-22 Jan 1771). He had previously published an edition by subscription in Dublin in 1750. There is no Irish edition from this period, although an edition was published in Liverpool in 1771. Lord may have intended to reprint his own edition, which may not have attracted sufficient interest to make the project worthwhile.\n\nJohn Hill, The oeconomy of human life [1751], title page and advertisement leaf.\n\nIn January 1771 Patrick advertised his move to Waterford and the commencement of his business of printing, bookbinding and bookselling. He advertised his book and stationery stock, which included school books, history books, and novels, which â€˜will be sold at the most reasonable rates by wholesale and retailâ€™ (Waterford Chronicle, 18-22 Jan 1771). He continued the same business model of supplying small and cheap books, prayer books, â€˜historiesâ€™ and school books for the country market, selling wholesale to chapmen and country merchants. He also carried an up to date stock of books, in 1771 he advertised The polite academy, or school of behaviour for young gentlemen and ladies (Waterford Chronicle, 18-22 Jan 1771). This is the London printing, the fourth edition was published in 1768, and a fifth edition came out in 1771. The sale of stationery formed an important element of any bookshop, pens, ink, wax, wafers, compliment cards, bills, bonds, indentures, leases, bills of lading, merchants ledgers, account books, letter cases, pocket books, music paper, and music books were in constant demand.\n\nCopper plate printing was a specialized business, requiring sophisticated equipment, and was not readily available in Irish towns. When John Ferrar published The Limerick directory in 1769, the accompanying perspective view of Limerick was sent to London to be engraved (Limerick Chronicle, 13 Mar 1769). Patrickâ€™s ability to carry out copper plate printing would have been a first in a country town. He advertised his acquisition from London of a new improved rolling press for copper plate printing, and a â€˜variety of pictures for the amusement of youthâ€™ (Waterford Chronicle, 5-8 Feb 1771; 7-11 Jun 1771). This press enabled him to produce pictures, illustrations and maps, coats of arms and crests, as well as bill heads, trade cards and other commercial engravings. However, competition came to Waterford six months later when J. Levi and Company, engravers from London, arrived and set up shop at Mr Florence Mahonyâ€™s, peruke maker on The Quay (Waterford Chronicle, 11-14 Jun 1771). It is not clear how long Patrick Lord continued to trade in Waterford. He had already moved back to Cork when his death occurred in Clothierâ€™s Lane in 1785, â€˜formerly a respectable bookseller in Dublinâ€™ [Hibernian Chronicle, 7 Apr 1785; Dublin Evening Post, 19 Apr 1785).\n\nPatrick Lord advertisement, Waterford Chronicle, 7-11 Jun 1771. J. Levi and Company advertisement, Waterford Chronicle, 11-14 Jun 1771.\n\nThomas Lord (1767-1798)\n\nThomas Lord, Patrick Lordâ€™s son, set up his business in Cork about 1767, at about the same time as his father. In late December he was advertising books for sale at his bookshop in Castle Street (Corke Journal, 31 Dec 1767-4 Jan 1768). Thomas was married in Cork in late October 1767, to the daughter of Cornelius Sullivan, bookseller in Castle Street (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 28-31 Oct 1767; Freemanâ€™s Journal, 31 Oct-3 Nov 1767). Thomasâ€™s first address in Cork was â€˜under the Exchange Coffee Houseâ€™, the bookshop of his late father in law, who had died in April 1767 (Cork Chronicle, 6 Apr 1767). He inserted a detailed advertisement in the Corke Journal, informing the public that the bookselling business â€˜is now continued in said same extensive manner as formerlyâ€™ (Corke Journal, 4-7 Jan 1768). His dwelling house was at Fennâ€™s Quay, â€˜a commodious house with all conveniencesâ€™, which he advertised to let in 1769 (Cork Evening Post, 2 Feb 1769). Thomasâ€™s business embraced printing, bookselling, a commercial lending library and sales of stationery, paper, patent medicines and â€˜the newest music from London, and Dublinâ€™ (Corke Journal, 4-7 Jan 1768).\n\nIn his early years in Cork Thomas was associated with William Flyn, a major Catholic bookseller in the city. In 1769 they advertised the sale of Commentaries on the laws of England by William Blackstone in four volumes, selling at Â£1.10s.4d. (Hibernian Chronicle, 20 Nov 1769). This was likely the Dublin edition, printed in octavo for John Exshaw, Henry Saunders, Boulter Grierson, James Williams, Samuel Watson, Elizabeth Lynch and other Dublin booksellers in 1769 and 1770. It was based on the third edition of the octavo format printed in Oxford from 1768 to 1770. In August 1770 they advertised The Trial of his R. H. the Duke of Cumberland for criminal conversation with Lady Grosvenor, price 6Â½d. (Hibernian Chronicle, 16 Aug 1770). This salacious pamphlet was published in London, running to seven editions in 1770.\n\nThomas was also involved in publication, albeit on a small scale. One of his earliest publications was Sarah Fieldingâ€™s The governess; or, little female academy, the fourth edition, in 1769. His address is given as â€˜under the Exchange Coffee House, Castle Streetâ€™. This may have been a collaboration with Flyn and Thomas White, who printed the same edition of the text. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) suggests that the title page is a variant as pagination, format and title page setting are identical in the two printings, except for the names on the imprint (ESTC online). The governess was written for the moral instruction and entertainment of young girls. First published about 1749 in London, it is credited with being among the first fictional works written for children, it was reprinted many times and was influential in inspiring other authors. Lordâ€™s next publication was a subscription project in 1770 when he printed the fifth edition of Rev. James de la Courâ€™s A prospect of poetry. It was very well supported, attracting 338 subscribers from different ranks of society, including the aristocracy, clergy, professional men, military personnel and merchants. Patrick Lord, Thomasâ€™s father, subscribed to 25 copies of the book.\n\nJames De la Cour, A prospect of poetry (1770), title page and advertisement leaf.\n\nThe main feature of his business in Cork was the opening of his new circulating library, under the Exchange Coffee House, which was advertised at the end of A prospect of poetry as well as in the press (Cork Evening Post, 18 Jun 1770). The establishment of commercial lending libraries was a product of the late seventeenth century, but they came into their own in Ireland in the eighteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century the novel had developed its distinctive form, and commercial circulating libraries are particularly associated with lending novels, literary and epistolary narratives, plays and poetry. As literacy levels rose and the base of readers broadened, many who could read and enjoy books were not able to afford them. Aristocratic, country house and estate libraries were used by family and friends of the owners, but there was a large cohort of readers who could not gain access to them.\n\nBooksellers were innovative and flexible and they embraced a commercial solution, by lending new books to readers of more modest means. They established circulating libraries as one element of their bookselling and stationery business, they needed a good audience base, so they were situated in larger towns and fashionable resorts. One of the earliest, as noted by Pollard, was run by James Hoey, bookseller in Dublin, who was lending novels and romances in 1735 (Pollard 1989. Hoeyâ€™s Dublin Journal, 15 Jul 1735). Irish booksellers prided themselves on stocking the very latest and most fashionable reading matter, especially novels, plays and poetry. For a modest sum books could be borrowed and read. The subscription fee was on average 6Â½d. per week, 5s.5d. per quarter, or 16s.3d. per year in the 1780s and 1790s The circulating library at Essex Gate, Dublin, advertised at this rate in 1783, claiming that the charges equalled the â€˜very moderate Terms at Bathâ€™ (Volunteerâ€™s Journal, 15 Dec 1783). Circulating libraries appealed to those readers who were not wealthy, the quarterly fee amounting to no more than the cost of a two volume work.\n\nThomas Lord was one of the earliest to open a circulating library as part of his business, guaranteeing attendance from six in the morning until nine at night, and offering new books as soon as published. His rates were somewhat above the average at 17s.4d. per year, 10s. for six months, 5s.5d. per quarter, or 2s.2d. a month (De la Cour 1770, final leaf). The initial response to his library was good and by June 1770 he thanked ladies and gentlemen who supported his venture, and advertised that â€˜sensible to the inconvenience of his present shop, and the too frequent interruption unavoidably given to his reading subscribersâ€™ he intended to open a new shop â€˜for the sole purpose of a circulating libraryâ€™. He would employ â€˜a proper personâ€™ to attend the library from ten oâ€™clock until three, and from four to eight oâ€™clock every dayâ€™ (Cork Evening Post, 18 Jun 1770). The new library would open when 200 yearly subscribers were signed up at one guinea (10s.6d.) each, and readers could borrow two volumes at a time. His library had space for â€˜reading subscribersâ€™ which was a very advanced concept, one that he wished to retain with a move to a better premises. He noted that â€˜in order to render this plan the more extensively useful, he will take a journey to London and Dublin, to procure a large and elegant collection of many thousand of the best books in the modern languages, and settle a correspondence for an immediate supply of every new publication of meritâ€™ (Cork Evening Post, 18 Jun 1770). Circulating libraries helped to create and satisfy the need for novel reading, with every new publication published in Cork, Dublin and London available as soon as published.\n\nThomas Lordâ€™s fortune took a turn for the worse in July 1772 when his household furniture was sold by the sheriffs of Cork at his house on Fennâ€™s Quay (Hibernian Chronicle, 23 July 1772). From this time on his career becomes fragmented. It is likely that the circulating library was discontinued. His next known publication is The relieving of Gibraltar, a song book printed between about 1781 and 1784, when his address is given as Lordâ€™s New Printing House in Cork. This eight page booklet was typical of the range of songs and ballads for the chapmanâ€™s pack: small and light, not bound but folded and possibly stitched, with a fairly crudely printed woodcut on the title page.\n\nThe relieving of Gibraltar, title page (Courtesy Dublin City Library & Archive). The ancient and present state of Youghall, title page.\n\nNow began a roaming existence when he set up printing presses in Youghal, County Cork (1784), Clonmel, County Tipperary (1786), Cashel, County Tipperary (1788), Carlow (1788), Waterford (1792-1793), and finally in Roscrea, County Tipperary (1794-1798). It is not clear when Thomas Lord set up business in Youghal, but he was established there by 1784 when he printed The ancient and present state of Youghall by subscription. Lordâ€™s subscription project was successful, attracting 359 subscribers, including higher clergy, such as the archbishop of Cashel and the bishop of Cloyne, local aristocracy and landowners, such as the earl of Grandison, and the Earl and Countess of Shannon, known supporters of literary and historical endeavours. Youghalâ€™s town officials also supported the venture, William Jackson, mayor of Youghal, David Freeman, mayor elect, William Jenkins, town clerk, and Peter Hennis, collector of Youghal were among the subscribers. The 130 page text gives a topographical and historical account of Youghal, and its surrounding towns and villages, describing churches and gentlemenâ€™s seats, and giving a list of mayors and other officials. Dix has also recorded two play bills printed by Lord in Youghal from this year, one for a performance by the Little Polander and one for The Beaux stratagem (Dix 1912).\n\nTwo years later, Lord is recorded as printer and bookseller in Tipperary, first at Clonmel in 1786 and then at Cashel in 1788. Edward Collins was well established in Clonmel from at least 1771 as printer, bookseller, newspaper printer, patent medicine agent and wine merchant, becoming mayor in 1787. In 1771 he founded and printed the Hibernian Gazette, or Hibernian Advertiser, later the Clonmell Gazette, or Hibernian Advertiser (1778). There was not much scope in Clonmel for a new printing business, yet Lord printed at least two books, a 16 page octavo pamphlet The upright lives of the heathens (1786), first published in London over one hundred years earlier in 1683, and the 50 page account of The life and conversion of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African prince (1786). This narrative was very popular and had been reprinted in England, Scotland and America from the early 1770s, and included a Welsh language version from 1779. It had later Irish editions, printed in Dublin in 1790 and Cork in 1791.\n\nBy 1788 Lord was associated with the establishment of two newspapers in two different towns, Lordâ€™s Munster Herald, or General Advertiser in Cashel (Lordâ€™s Munster Herald, 14 Apr 1788), and with a printer named Eustace, the Carlow Mercury, or Leinster Advertiser (Carlow Mercury, 25-29 Oct 1788), with its office in Dublin Street, Carlow. Neither appears to have been a success and only one issue of each has survived. He was the first printer to set up business in Cashel, but his stay was short. A brief return to Cork in 1790 saw his publication of Lordâ€™s Cork Weekly Magazine, or, Universal Repository; of knowledge, instruction and entertainment in octavo format (Volume I no. IV, Cork, 27 Nov 1790).\n\nLord spent two years in Waterford from 1792 to 1793. He established his printing office in Michael Street, and he issued three Catholic devotional works. Meditations and prayers, adapted to the stations of the holy way of the cross, a 44 page octavo was printed in 1792. The same year he published The spiritual combat by Lorenzo Scupoli, a spiritual guide to Catholic living, first published in 1589. This was a substantial work, coming to 228 pages octavo. The following year he brought out another edition of The spiritual combat, published by subscription, with the addition of â€˜Meditations and prayers, adapted to the stations of the crossâ€™. It attracted 147 subscribers for 159 copies of the book. Where addresses of purchasers were given they were local to towns in Waterford and Wexford.\n\nIt is not clear if Thomas Lord continued his printing business, working with William Lord and Thomas Henry Lord, probably his sons, in Roscrea, County Tipperary. They established a newspaper, The Roscrea Southern Star; or, General Advertiser in August 1795 with its printing office in Limerick Street, becoming that townâ€™s first printers, but Thomasâ€™s name is not on the imprint of the sole surviving issue (Roscrea Southern Star, 19 Aug 1795). Advertising revenue is critical to the success of a newspaper, and in the Irish context at this period government notices and proclamations provided an important source of income to many newspapers. In 1797 Thomas Lord sent a letter to Edward Cooke (government under secretary), stating that â€˜he has established this newspaper which loyally supports and will support Government, that his refusal to insert insidious or treasonable articles and letters has lost him many subscribers, that he is authorised to refer to General Massey, and as his business is not growing, the Government by inserting proclamations in his paper could assist him very muchâ€™ (NAI: Rebellion Papers 620/32/10 3 August 1797). It is not known what the outcome of this request for support was, but the following year, 1798, the press was â€˜burnt by the yeomanry in suspicion of printing seditious balladsâ€™ (Burke 1907, pp 358-359). After a run of at least two years only a single issue of the Southern Star survives in Cambridge University Library (ESTC P3209). No mention of Thomas Lord occurs after this time, but traces of William and Thomas Henry appear in later decades. It is even possible that it was Thomas Henry who wrote to Edward Cooke in 1797. An advertisement for Thomas Henry Lord, sworn broker and general auctioneer for the counties of Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny, announced that he had opened rooms at his house in Carrick (Clonmel Gazette, 13 Nov 1802). William Lord, bookseller, printer and stationer, had his bookshop in Main Street, Wexford, from at least 1809 to 1824 (Pigotâ€™s Directory 1824). In 1809 William was selling agent for Sir James Wareâ€™s Ancient Irish histories: the works of Spencer, Campion, Hanmer, and Marleburrough in two volumes, at his shop in Wexford.\n\nPatrick and Thomas Lord had difficulty finding their niche in the Irish book trade. Hampered by their Catholic religion their printing and sale of Catholic devotional literature gave a precarious living. In spite of twenty years spent in Dublin, publishing and selling books and pamphlets of Catholic interest, Patrick embarked on new business ventures in Cork and Waterford. Thomas began his career with a major advantage, as he married the daughter of recently deceased bookseller, Cornelius Sullivan in Cork, and seems to have taken over his premises in Castle Street. His early business model, including a bookshop and circulating library was ambitious, and yet it was short lived. Thomasâ€™s attempts to set up new printing businesses in Irish towns and to establish local newspapers did not meet with great success. In many instances businesses already served the fairly small market for books and printed materials in the provincial towns, and as a new arrival he faced an uphill struggle to compete.\n\nReferences:\n\nBradshaw, Henry, 1916.

Books, newspapers and official publications were required for city and town administrations, education, and leisure. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries newspapers from Dublin and London were distributed to Irish subscribers by the Post Office. Books, pamphlets and magazines could be sold by local merchants if there were no specialised bookshops. Local printing was small scale or non existent outside the larger cities and towns until the second half of the century. By the last quarter of the eighteenth century printing offices were being established in most county towns in Ireland. There may not always have been enough work in jobbing printing, bookselling and the sale of stationery to make a living, and many provincial booksellers offered a stunning array of products and services to supplement their income. Many printers established local newspapers, and the earliest evidence for these printers often comes from newspaper imprints and the advertisements they carry.\n\nJohn Senex, A new map of Ireland, 1720, detail showing County Kerry. Daniel Augustus Beaufort, A new map of Ireland, 1797, detail showing County Kerry. (Courtesy Dublin City Library & Archive)\n\nThe main centres for the book trade in eighteenth-century County Kerry were Tralee and Killarney, while a number of the larger towns formed part of the distribution network for printed materials, especially as newspaper delivery centres. Tralee was the county town, it received its charter from the English King James I in 1612. A corporate town, it was governed by a provost and twelve burgesses, twelve common council men, a town clerk and two sergeants at mace, and had the county court house where the assizes were conducted (Smith 1756, pp 73, 160-61, 298). The town was situated about a mile from the sea, but a shallow, exposed and unsafe bay meant that seagoing trade did not bring much business to the town. From at least mid century the beauties of the lakes and landscape of Killarney were celebrated in print, in prose and verse, and in art, with engravings and paintings. This celebrity attracted visitors to the town and nearby spa. It was described as a thriving town by Charles Smith in 1756, a new street â€˜with a large commodious innâ€™ was being designed to accommodate visitors to the lakes. The town was well connected by road to Cork, Limerick, and within the county to Tralee and Dingle (Smith 1756, p.146).\n\nBookselling:\n\nThe Gaelic scribal tradition was active in Kerry through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the Irish language was a widespread vernacular throughout the county. The book trade, comprising printed books, pamphlets, magazines and newspapers, was largely in English, a language more prevalent in the larger towns. Authors writing in Irish relied almost exclusively on manuscript transmission (Caball 2014). In 1796, when Joshua Gilpin, an American paper manufacturer from Delaware, made a journey from Cork to Killarney, he noted the poor conditions of the hill farmers, but he added â€˜they are smart, intelligent and healthy, they speak & most of them read English tho Irish is the language they use to each otherâ€™ (Hancock and Wilkinson 1962, p.125). Book production was not part of the book trade economy in the county. The book publication centres of Dublin, Cork and Limerick supplied the needs of the reading public, supplemented by imports from London, most of which came through booksellers in those towns. Evidence for book purchasing is hard to come by, especially in the absence of newspaper advertising. A number of relevant books were published by subscription in Dublin and Cork, listing names of purchasers. It is known from the lists that Kerry readers subscribed to these publications, and occasionally newspaper advertisements name subscription agents in the towns who gathered names and promoted the volume locally.\n\nThe first evidence for book trade activity in Kerry is from Tralee in 1694, and the first named bookseller, or distributor of books, was Mr Letcher. In 1694 he was selling the Dublin printed book, The London-master: or, the Jew detected (Orpen 1694). The 46 page pamphlet concerned the investigation by Richard Orpen into the loss of the ship Laurel, carrying a valuable cargo, in the Kilmare River (Kenmare Bay?), near Killowen, County Kerry. Before Tralee came into its own with printing offices issuing local newspapers in the late eighteenth century the regional publishing and distribution centres supplying the county were Limerick and Cork. The earliest book distributors in the county were not likely to have been dedicated booksellers, but general merchants or traders who also carried a selection of printed materials. Merchants, such as James Craswell of Killarney, traded in printed materials, books and newspapers, in the late 1760s to the middle of the 1770s. Visitors attending the spa and enjoying the lakes may have augmented his local market for books and newspapers. It was the early nineteenth century before evidence emerges for two bookshops in Killarney: Maurice Harnett and Robert Sugrue, booksellers and stationers in Main Street (Pigot 1824).\n\nRichard Barton, Lectures in natural philosophy (Dublin, 1751), titlepage.\n\nIn 1749 Patrick Haley in Tralee was subscription agent for a Limerick publication, William Biggs, The military history of Europe, published by Andrew Welsh, its publication date coincided with the Munster circuit of the assizes, when the towns were busy with visitors (Munster Journal, 17 Jul 1749; 7 Aug 1749). The large octavo volume, illustrated with plans, cost five British shillings, half to be paid on subscribing, and the remainder on delivery. Mr Barret in Tralee was subscription agent in 1751 for Lectures in natural philosophy â€¦ concerning Lough Neagh by Richard Barton (Munster Journal, 25 Mar 1751). This volume, printed in Dublin for the author by Alice Reilly, had a Kerry interest, as it included â€˜a short description of a beautiful lake near Killarneyâ€™. It was a subscription project, attracting 555 subscribers. No addresses are given, so it is not clear how much interest it garnered in Kerry. From the spread of higher clergy who supported it, it seems to have had a countrywide appeal. In 1765 two sellers are named in Kerry for Scanlanâ€™s sheet almanack for 1766, printed in Cork by Eugene Swiney: James Craswell in Killarney and William Leary in Tralee (Corke Chronicle, 9-12 Dec 1765). In 1767 Edmond Dowlin, merchant in Tralee, and James Craswell, merchant in Killarney, acted as subscription agents for two original publications by John Brenn of Clonmel, County Tipperary, teacher of mathematics and land surveyor (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 7-11 Mar 1767). Brennâ€™s Book-keeping and The young gentlemen and ladiesâ€™ arithmetical magazine were both offered to the public by subscription. Brennâ€™s Book-keeping had a cost of five British shillings (5s.5d. Irish) bound and lettered, half to be paid in advance, and the remainder upon publication. The Magazine cost a British half crown (2s.8Â½d. Irish) also bound and lettered, half to be paid in advance. Subscriptions were taken by booksellers and merchants in the Munster area. These two publications were undertaken, and most likely financed, by the author himself, and he promised to publish as soon as a sufficient number had subscribed â€˜barely to defray the expenceâ€™. It is not clear if enough subscriptions were gathered to make these projects viable, no copy of either has survived, but the survival rates for school texts are very poor.\n\nIn 1773 and 1775 two subscription campaigns were run by William Flyn, bookseller in Cork, for Richard Challonerâ€™s Considerations upon Christian truths (Challoner 1773) and James Poulsonâ€™s Moral and divine observations (Poulson 1775). Flyn advertised proposals for printing Challoner by subscription in January 1772, volume one was completed in February 1773, with volume two due to follow shortly (Hibernian Chronicle, 13 Jan 1772; 4 Feb 1773). This was a Catholic text by the well known English Catholic bishop. Only volume two has survived, containing the supplementary list of subscribers. This list comprises just 150 names, a large proportion are from County Kerry, including the Catholic bishop, Rev. John Madgett, who took 80 sets. James Poulsonâ€™s Moral and divine observations, printed for the author and sold by William Flyn and Thomas White, has a large subscription list comprising 613 names taking 732 copies of the book. While the majority of subscribers did not give an address, between the two lists, 151 subscribers gave their address as Kerry, of which 38 were from Tralee, 25 from Killarney and 10 from Castleisland. One of the subscribers to Poulsonâ€™s volume was James Craswell of Killarney.\n\nIn 1791 Pat Oâ€™Kelly launched a subscription to publish his epic Killarney: a descriptive poem (Oâ€™Kelly 1791). It was printed for him in Dublin by Peter Hoey, who took 50 copies for sale in his bookshop. The subscription list contains 1,854 names for 1,946 copies of the book. Oâ€™Kelly dedicated the volume to Lord Viscount Kenmare, and the list is headed by the Lord Lieutenant and his wife, the Earl and Countess of Westmorland. The list is a triumph of marketing, attracting subscribers from different parts of Ireland, including members of the aristocracy and gentry, landowners, higher clergy, the provost and graduates of Trinity College Dublin. Only a portion of subscribers give addresses, so purchasers from the county cannot be singled out. Myles Carroll from Killarney was selling agent for Samuel Ancellâ€™s Siege of Gibraltar in 1793 (Ancell 1793; Cork Gazette, 8 Sep 1792; 16 Mar 1793). This was the fourth edition, printed for the author by Anthony Edwards in Cork and selling for 5s.5d. bound. Sergeant Ancell was clerk to the 58th regiment, based at the Old Barracks in Cork, and his book was sold by booksellers in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny, Youghal and Killarney (Cork Gazette, 13 Mar 1793). It can be seen from subscription lists that officers of the army were important book purchasers, and this volume would have had a wide appeal among this group.\n\nA work of literature, travel and Irish history in prose and verse, in two volumes by Daniel Roderick Oâ€™Conor, was published by subscription in Cork about 1798 or 1799 (Oâ€™Conor 1798). Entitled The works of Mr. Daniel Roderick Oâ€™Conor, it included A description of Loch-Lene, the celebrated lake of Killarney. The printer, John Connor, ran a circulating library at Chattertonâ€™s Buildings, Grand Parade, Cork, and was involved in the publication of several original works, including novels, from 1790 to about 1831. The two volumes cost 11s. 4Â½d. to subscribers and 14s. to non-subscribers. The list of subscribers is extensive, amounting to 2,636 names from all over Ireland, 170 are from Kerry, from Tralee (71), Killarney (69), Kenmare (Nedeen), Dingle, Milltown, Tarbert and Castleisland, including Florence McCarthy, printer in Tralee.\n\nNewspaper distribution:\n\nNewspaper agents and distributors are known by name thanks to their role in the trade, in many instances the only reference to their involvement is their identification as subscription agents or delivery centres. In County Kerry a range of book trade personnel are known through their roles in newspaper distribution. James Craswell, merchant in Killarney, was agent for a number of newspapers, in 1770 he was agent for two Cork printed newspapers, The Corke Journal, published by Eugene Swiney (Corke Journal, 2 Apr 1770) and The Hibernian Chronicle, published by William Flyn (Hibernian Chronicle, 18 Jun 1770). In 1773 William Bingley of London made a tour of Munster and Leinster gathering subscriptions for two London newspapers, The Independent Chronicle, at a cost of one guinea and one crown per annum, and Bingleyâ€™s London Journal, costing 13s British. He appointed a number of individuals around Ireland to act as agents for the newspapers. In Kerry he had two agents, Samuel Morris in Tralee and James Craswell in Killarney (Hibernian Chronicle, 26 Aug 1773. Freemanâ€™s Journal, 19-21 Oct 1773).\n\nThe Waterford Herald was published by Nicholas Byrne, printer and bookseller, near the Quay in Waterford from 1791 (Waterford Herald, 28 Jun 1791). Early the following year he was distributing the paper throughout Munster, using the Post Office network. His agents in Kerry were Mr J. W.Grades, at the Post Office in Tralee and Mr C. Cooper at the Post Office in Killarney (Waterford Herald, 4 Feb 1792). It is likely that they were simple distribution centres, although it is known that books and monthly periodicals purchased from distant booksellers were distributed by the Post Office as well as by local couriers. In 1802 The Cork Mercantile Chronicle, successor to The Hibernian Chronicle, published by James Haly in Cork, was circulated throughout Munster, to John Mulchinoch in Tralee, John Stokes in Listowel, Thomas Sullivan in Killarney and Mr Green in Dingle (Cork Mercantile Chronicle, 26 Apr 1802).\n\nKerry newspapers:\n\nFrom the 1770s Tralee had its own newspapers, but other regional newspapers continued to circulate. It is difficult to pin down the earliest Kerry newspapers as survival rates of issues are poor. Dix estimated the earliest date as 1774 or 1775 for the twice weekly Kerry Evening Post, 1780 or 1782 for The Kerry Journal, and 1783 for The Kerry Chronicle (Dix 1910). Only one issue of The Kerry Evening Post has survived from the eighteenth century (20 Mar 1793), and single issues from 1813, 1820 and 1824. The 1793 issue, printed by John Busteed, is numbered volume V, which indicates a start date of 1788. Busteed came to Tralee in 1780 and is credited with founding the Evening Post. Dix posits the idea that there two Kerry Evening Posts, the first, noted by Madden, started in 1774, which subsequently ceased, and the title was revived by John Busteed in 1788 (Madden 1867, ii, p. 242).\n\nIn 1775 an advertisement for The Kerry Journal, a new newspaper venture just begun in Tralee, was carried in The Hibernian Morning Post, a newspaper published by John Busteed while he was still in Cork (Hibernian Morning Post, 31 Aug â€“ 4 Sep 1775). The Kerry Journal, the new twice weekly newspaper, had just commenced the previous week and Busteed acted as Cork agent for it, taking subscriptions at three crowns (15s) a year, and taking in advertising. No issues of The Kerry Journal have survived (National Library of Ireland Newsplan database), but a number of stray references attest to its continued existence into the 1790s. After a meeting of the Royal Tralee Volunteers in March 1782, their resolutions were to be published in The Dublin Evening Post and the Kerry Journal (Wilson 1782). In 1793 a story taken from the Kerry Journal was carried in The Sporting Magazine, published in London, concerning a large whale-like fish caught at the mouth of the Kenmare river (Sporting Magazine 1793, p.314).\n\nThe Kerry Chronicle and Tralee Advertiser was founded about 1783, the earliest surviving issue is volume VII from 1790, when it was published by Florence McCartie (Kerry Chronicle, 5 Oct 1790), and cost two pence halfpenny per issue. The Western Mercury, or Kerry Herald, afterwards The Western Herald or Kerry Advertiser, was published by George Chute and Florence McCartie from 1793. It cost two and a half pence per issue and was widely circulated around the county, taken by George Eggleston for Ballylongford and Ballyduff, Timothy Kerin in Castlemain, Matthew McCarthie in Killarney, Con McCarthy in Castleisland, Dr Oâ€™Connor in Listowel, Caleb Palmer at the Post Office in Milltown, and the Post Offices at Dingle and Tarbert (Western Mercury, 26 Mar 1793).\n\nCirculation of local newspaper titles in the county was at the lower end of figures for county newspapers, probably due to a more sparse population. From 1774 and the first Stamp Act, each newspaper issue was required by law to be stamped to show that duty was paid. Circulation figures for the year ending 5 January 1822, based on the numbers of stamps issued, were 4,200 for The Kerry Evening Post, and 10,700 for The Western Herald (Newspaper (Ireland) 1826). This makes a total of nearly 15,000 Kerry newspapers distributed in addition to other titles published in Cork, Limerick or Dublin. This compares with a combined figure of 182,420 for the six Limerick newspapers to January 1822 and 364,800 for the seven Cork newspaper titles. The House of Commons in London paid for official proclamations and notices carried in local newspapers. The Western Herald was paid Â£158.15s.2Â¾d. and The Kerry Evening Post Â£160.9s.4d. for newspapers and proclamations for the year ending January 1822 (Newspapers and Proclamations 1826).\n\nLocal printing:\n\nDuring the eighteenth century printing in Kerry was mainly confined to newspaper publication, although jobbing printing was a feature of all provincial printing offices. The major printing businesses in Tralee in the late eighteenth century were established by John Busteed from 1780, Florence McCartie (or McCarthy) from at least 1790, and George Chute from about 1793.\n\nJohn Busteed began his printing and bookselling career in Cork about 1768, where he published The Cork Chronicle newspaper from 1769 and, with William Sargent, The Hibernian Morning Post or Literary Chronicle from 1773 to 1776 (Hibernian Journal, 19 Apr 1773). Two years later he was in Ennis, County Clare, working with George Trinder, and publishing The Clare Journal (Clare Journal, 8 Jun 1778). In 1779 he partnered with Thomas Saunders Knox to propose a new newspaper in Kilkenny (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 8-12 May 1779). Kilkenny already had a well established newspaper, Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, run by Catharine Finn, and their venture proved unsuccessful (mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com â€˜Edmund and Catharine Finn: enterprising booksellers in Kilkenny (1766-1801)â€™). By 1780 he established his printing office in Tralee, where for more than half a century he and his sons ran a successful business. Johnâ€™s wife Sarah (nÃ©e Saunders) died in Tralee in January 1782 (Cork Evening Post, 4 Feb 1782). Shortly afterwards he married again and with his second wife, Catherine Hilliard, had eight children (irishgenealogy.ie online), Richard (born 31 May 1783), William (born 5 Dec 1784), George (born 1786), John (born 11 Jul 1788), Morgan Oâ€™Connell (born 12 Jan 1790), Frances / Francis (born 5 / 6 Jan 1793), Barbara (born 12 Oct 1794), and Thomas Ellis Emmett (born 15 Aug 1797). John had joined him in business by 1809, and by 1813 at least one other son joined the business, which became Busteed and Sons. John Busteed died on 4 March 1819 (Clare Journal, 8 Mar 1819. Southern Reporter, 13 Mar 1819).\n\nJohn Busteed and his sons are mainly associated with The Kerry Evening Post, until it was taken over by John and Charles Eagar in 1829. Cusack stated that John arrived in Tralee in 1780 as Postmaster of Kerry, and bought up the proprietorship of The Kerry Journal from James Graves (Cusack 1871, p. 422). As no copies of the Journal have survived it is difficult to assess his connection with its publication, he had acted as its Cork agent when it was launched in 1775, but it is more likely that he took over The Kerry Evening Post, the title with which he had such a long association, although he may have had an involvement with both newspapers. The Evening Post, published twice a week, carried the usual range of foreign and domestic news, parliamentary proceedings from London, official and local business advertisements, and notices of births, marriages and deaths. In 1819, the year of John seniorâ€™s death, John junior is listed in the British Parliamentary Papers (p. 34, no. 7, 3 Apr 1819), as receiving payment of Â£37.2s.7Â½d. for advertising the prices of corn and grain, and government proclamations, carried in The Kerry Evening Post. By 1824 the address of the printing office was 1, Day Place, Tralee (Pigot 1824). John junior continued the business until 1829, when the proprietorship of The Kerry Evening Post was transferred to John and Charles Eagar (Kerry Evening Post, 3 Jun 1829). Under their proprietorship the distribution of the Evening Post was extensive, with two agents in London and one in Dublin for sales and advertising (Kerry Evening Post, 3 Jun 1829).\n\nKerry Evening Post, 24 May 1813, masthead and colophon. Kerry Evening Post, 3 Jun 1829, colophon.\n\nThe poor survival of newspapers means that Busteedâ€™s newspaper advertising is lost for this period. When he worked in Cork he had a substantial bookshop selling a large variety of books, magazines and patent medicines which he advertised in The Hibernian Morning Post (20-23 Feb 1775). The printing office in Tralee is likely to have had a bookshop, or at least a public office attached where books and magazines could be ordered and purchased. In 1800 John subscribed to three copies of the Catholic work The philosophical catechism by Rev. F. X. de Feller, translated from French by Rev. J. P. Mulcaile (De Feller 1800). In 1809 Busteed and Son were selling agents for Sir James Wareâ€™s Ancient Irish histories published in Dublin (Ware 1809). It is not clear if John junior remained in business after the transfer of the Kerry Evening Post, he lived to be 75 years old, and died on 14 July 1863 (Southern Reporter, 21 Jul 1863).\n\nFlorence McCartie and George Chute worked as printers in Tralee from the 1790s. George was succeeded by Pierce (or Peirce) Chute, probably his son. McCartie was printer of The Kerry Chronicle from at least 1790, the date of the earliest surviving issue (Kerry Chronicle, 5 Oct 1790). Chute and McCartie printed The Western Mercury or Kerry Herald from 1793, one issue has survived from 26 March 1793, which is the second number of volume one, the cost was two pence halfpenny per issue. The name changed to Chuteâ€™s Western Herald or Kerry Advertiser, probably indicating sole proprietorship by George or Pierce Chute, while Florence McCartie went on to found The Kerry Dispatch in 1807 (Kerry Dispatch, 17 Feb 1807; Oâ€™Donoghue 2015). George Chute was succeeded as proprietor of Chuteâ€™s Western Herald by Pierce Chute before 1811 (Holden 1811).Pierce Chute was Justice of the Peace and Provost of Tralee for many years. He died on 15 May 1843. The paper was printed by Pierce Chute at the printing office in Nelson Street until September 1828 (Chuteâ€™s Western Herald, 27 Sep 1828). The proprietorship was taken over by Thomas Day and the name changed to The Western Herald, or, Tralee and Killarney Advertiser (Western Herald, 2 Oct 1828). No printerâ€™s name was given, it was printed in Church Street â€˜for the proprietorâ€™ until 12 February 1829 when it was printed â€˜for the proprietorâ€™ by John Castles in Church Street (Western Herald, 12 Feb 1829). Castles, with his address in Church Street, is likely to have been the printer from the time of the changeover. The Western Herald continued until May 1835 (Western Herald, 4 May 1835). Castles had previously worked in Abbey Street, where in 1827 he printed a 28 page octavo pamphlet, Truth vindicated; being an answer to a pamphlet said to contain the speeches of Mr. Wright and Mr. Rd. Oâ€™Connell at Edinburgh on the 8th of March 1827, selling for 6d.\n\nWestern Herald, 1 Jun 1829, colophon. Tralee Mercury, 4 Jun 1831, advertisement.\n\nIn 1829 a new newspaper, The Kerry Mercury, was founded by John Flynn in Castle Street, in opposition to the two established papers (Kerry Mercury, 14 Feb 1829). It was a twice weekly paper priced at 6d per issue, or two guineas per annum. Flynn, a native of Tralee, had worked as a reporter in London and Dublin, before returning to Tralee in 1828 (Oâ€™Donohoe 2015). Flynnâ€™s tenure was short as he died in 1831 and the proprietorship of the newspaper and printing office equipment was advertised for sale by his widow, Mary Flynn (Tralee Mercury, 4 Jun 1831). From July 1831 it was printed by M. Stack for the proprietor, William Oâ€™Reilly (Tralee Mercury, 7 Sep 1831). The newspaper lasted until 1839 under the direction of John Lynch as proprietor and William Raymond of Upper Castle Street as printer (Tralee Mercury, 20 Jul 1839).\n\nThe book trade in County Kerry was mainly served from Dublin, Cork and Limerick until the last quarter of the eighteenth century when printing offices were set up in Tralee to publish local newspapers. Newspaper distribution before this time was done through the Post Office and other agents. By the first decades of the nineteenth century book and stationery shops took their places in the main towns. Tralee had two circulating libraries in 1811, McAlifâ€™s, and 1812, Joseph Connorâ€™s on the Mall (Manley 2018, p.214). Killarney had at least two bookshops by 1824 (Pigot 1824). Evidence for book buyers is sparse, but a number of books published by subscription in Dublin and Cork during the eighteenth century reveal Kerry book purchasers in their lists. These customers had access to advertising, probably through the newspapers circulating in the county, and they obtained their books from non-specialist traders or agents and newspaper offices or delivery centres. Some of the more high profile subscribers may have ordered their books directly from the bookshops in Dublin or Cork.\n\nBook Trade Personnel in Eighteenth-Century Kerry\n\nReferences:\n\nAncell, Samuel, 1793.

The city was at the centre of a wealthy and populous hinterland (Dickson 2005). Cork harbour was a main port of call for the English navy and other transatlantic shipping, Cork merchants had close links with the Atlantic ports of France and Spain, where family members often held commercial concerns. The size and security of the deep-water harbour, in addition to the prime situation of Cork for trade with the West Indies and the Americas, ensured its prosperity throughout the century. Cork was primarily a merchant city, outward looking and open to new ideas. The population of the city was varied: politically Protestant-dominated, commercially it had a strong and wealthy Catholic sector, the Huguenot community was active in trade from the late seventeenth century, various regiments of the British army were stationed in Cork throughout the century.\n\nPerspective view of Cork in Charles Smith, The antient and present state of the county and city of Cork (Dublin, A. Reilly for the author, 1750).\n\nBy the mid eighteenth century the city was finding its place as a cultural centre, the book trade was active from the early years of the century and visiting troupes of actors had been bringing theatrical entertainment in the summer season from the late 1730s (Clark 1965). The first newspapers published in the city were short-lived and it was not until the 1750s that regular newspapers could be sustained (National Library of Ireland Newsplan database). The Irish language was still spoken by many of the inhabitants of the city and surrounding areas up to the last quarter of the century (Beecher 1993). The business of the city and port, however, was carried out in English, and virtually all printing work was in English. Several printers, booksellers and stationers worked in the city from the early century supplying the civil administration, religious and educational institutions and Corkâ€™s intellectual elite (Kennedy 2005). Books were distributed from Dublin or imported directly from London. Because of Corkâ€™s prime position for trade the road networks were extensive. Local booksellers distributed their printed works to the main towns in Munster using the Post Office network and private couriers to circulate newspapers, periodicals and books (Kennedy 1998).\n\nCork Harbour from Old Monkstown Road from Mrs S. C. Hall, Ireland: its scenery, character, &c. (London, How and Parsons, 1841).\n\nLiteracy and Reading:\n\nPost-elementary education was available to the sons and daughters of the middle classes from the early years of the eighteenth century. Classical, diocesan and royal schools provided education of boys, preparing them for university and careers in trade and the army. Tutors and governesses were employed by wealthy families to educate their children. An important strand of private academies and schools teaching boys and girls at post-elementary level began to appear before the middle of the eighteenth century. These schools were important as they brought education within the scope of less well-off parents who had ambitions for their children. For girls the subjects generally taught were English, French and sometimes Italian, geography, history, needlework, music and dancing.\n\nReading aloud was an important social accomplishment, and girls in particular were encouraged to develop their reading skills. Guides for reading aloud were published for the benefit of young persons to enable them to distinguish themselves in company. The reading of novels was not always encouraged, older readers fearing a detrimental affect on young minds. However, novels were widely available either for purchase or for borrowing from a circulating library. Contemporary literature points to the extensive use of circulating libraries by women, most notably in Sheridanâ€™s The rivals (Sheridan 1775). Irish booksellers ran circulating libraries in many Irish towns in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. They prided themselves on stocking the very latest and most fashionable reading matter, especially novels, plays and poetry. For a modest sum, on average 6Â½d. per week, 5s.5d. per quarter, or 16s.3d. per year in the 1780s and 1790s, books could be borrowed and read. Circulating libraries helped to create and satisfy the need for novel reading, with every new publication published in Cork, Dublin and London available as soon as published. Locally-produced novels were published with the expectation of good sales and a place on the shelves of circulating libraries. These libraries appealed to readers who were not wealthy, the quarterly fee amounting to less than the cost of a two volume work.\n\nAuthorship:\n\nReaders make writers: from being an avid reader it is frequently a short step to becoming a writer. Women wrote poetry and novels and sought outlets for their work. Outlets which were available to budding authors and did not involve the expense of publication included newspapers and literary periodicals. One example is the novelist and travel writer, Mary Boddington (nÃ©e Comerford), born in Cork in 1776, who began her career writing verse for the Cork papers (Oâ€™Donoghue 1892). As early as the 1770s â€˜literary contributors of both sexesâ€™ were encouraged by William Flyn and his newspaper the Hibernian Chronicle (Hibernian Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772; Kennedy 2009). Flyn had as his editor Henry Sheares, who guided the early years of the Hibernian Chronicle from 1769 until his death in December 1775. Sheares gathered around him a coterie of literary men and women who contributed to the paper. Essays, prose and poetry were published in the pages of the Hibernian Chronicle under Flynâ€™s proprietorship for over thirty years. A selection of these contributions was published in a volume entitled The modern monitor, or Flynâ€™s speculations in 1771 (Modern monitor 1771). As this is volume one the intention was clearly to publish more, but no further volumes appeared. All surviving copies are the second edition, the first edition being publication in the Chronicle. Subscriptions were taken by booksellers James Williams and Thomas Walker in Dublin, Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford, John Ferrar and Catherine Long in Limerick, and at all country places where the Chronicle was circulated in 1770 (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Jul 1770). The subscription list is quite small, 102 names, 31 (or 30%) of whom are women, including most of the contributors, some of whom subscribed to multiple copies. Contributions were anonymous, the writers using initials or pseudonyms. Several copies of this volume have contemporary annotations identifying the contributors, one copy belonging to the Countess of Shannon notes some of them (Dublin City Library and Archive: Dix Collection 082).They included Henry Sheares, his wife Mrs Jane Anne Sheares, Dr John Longfield, Dr Joseph Fenn Sleigh, Mrs Elizabeth Gray, Mrs Stack, Miss Waterhouse and Mrs Therry. Flynâ€™s daughter, Eliza, who married the bookseller James Haly, was a frequent contributor to the Hibernian Chronicle (Ã“ Casaide, n.d., p.33; Kennedy 2009).\n\nThe modern monitor; or Flynâ€™s speculations (Cork, William Flyn, 1771), title page. Mrs Creech, Mary (Cork, J. Connor, 1796), title page.\n\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century locally produced literary and general periodicals were a feature of the Cork book trade. They drew on local talent for their contributions and were published and sometimes edited by local booksellers. The Weekly repository, begun in 1779, covered a broad range of topics: history, philosophy, mathematics, poetry, â€˜with several curious and entertaining originalsâ€™. The Cork weekly magazine, or universal repository of knowledge, instruction and entertainment published by the bookseller Thomas Lord from 1790, the Quiz (1794), the Medler (1795), the Tickler (1795), the Rover (1795-96), the Museum (1796), the Monthly miscellany (1796), and the Casket (1797-98) were all short-lived literary periodicals published in Cork in the last decade of the eighteenth century (Ã“ Casaide, n.d.).They provided a forum for female authors as well as their male counterparts. Mr Trant, printer at Hanover Street, published the Museum in 1796. A weekly publication issued on Saturdays, it contained essays, poetry, theatrical scripts and correspondence. It is not certain if he can be identified with James Philip Trant, who worked from Academy Street a decade earlier. In 1788 James Philip had published The vale of Irvine a two-volume novel by Harriet Westrop Atkins. In 1797 Mr Trant subscribed to 25 sets of the two volume novel A history of Julia and Cecilia de Valmont, by a young lady, lately deceased, published by John Connor.\n\nThe locally produced literary magazines, although short-lived, testify to this upsurge in literary interest. John Connor, James Haly and Michael Harris were to the fore in publishing original works of fiction and poetry, often by subscription. The last decade of the eighteenth-century saw an increased level of literary activity in the city, and the publication of several original works. Connorâ€™s literary output was especially significant, publishing at least twenty-seven literary titles in the twenty year period from 1794, more than half of which were original works (Loeber 1998). Connor established his circulating library at 17, Castle Street, the corner of Cornmarket, in the early 1790s (Cork Gazette, 17 Apr 1793; 20 Apr 1793), later moving to Chattertonâ€™s Buildings, Grand Parade, by 1798. As well as his bookshop, the circulating library required a wide range of new publications and the most fashionable reading matter for its success. Connor regularly advertised new novels lately published in Dublin and London as well as his own publication of original works.\n\nEdward Henry Morgan was proprietor of the Classic Novels Office in Daunt Square in 1803 where he published a series of small-format popular works. Titles included The history of Rasselas, prince of Abissinia (Samuel Johnson), The man of feeling (Henry Mackenzie), Paul and Virginia (Jean-Jacques Rousseau), Julia de RoubignÃ© and Don Quixote (Cervantes) in four volumes. He published a new edition of Frances Sheridanâ€™s The history of Nourjahad, the Persian, first published in London in 1767, as part of the series. The project was short-lived, however, and he was declared bankrupt in May 1804 (Freemanâ€™s Journal, 10 May 1804). The project was probably too ambitious and the market was not able to give rapid enough returns on such an investment. Morgan may not have had the customer base to sustain this project in the way that John Connor or James Haly had.\n\nSubscription editions:\n\nBooks were published by subscription to help finance the publication and to gain an idea of the size of the interested market. Subscription lists indicate support and patronage for the author rather than readership. Subscription campaigns were usually quite focussed, a large percentage of the names linked by a number of common factors: relationship with the author, regional interest, charitable motive, professional or confessional support. A typical book published by subscription in Ireland was a religious work, or a collection of poems, in small format, duodecimo or octavo, and printed for the author. In general 200 subscriptions were required to make a venture viable, but sometimes lists containing 100 names or less are found. The usual range of commitment was from 200 to 500 names, some subscribing for multiple copies. Womenâ€™s names appear less in subscription lists than menâ€™s, on average amounting to less than one-third of subscribers.\n\nInteresting evidence comes from four novels written by women and published by subscription in Cork in the 1790s. All had an interested female audience, ranging from 23% for Anna Millikinâ€™s Corfe Castle (1793), 34.1% and 34.5% for Millikinâ€™s Eva (1795) and Mrs Creechâ€™s Mary (1796) respectively, to 43.8% for The history of Julia and Cecilia de Valmont (1797) (Kennedy 1999, p. 90). Three were published by John Connor, and the fourth by James Haly. In each case the lists show a strong local support in the Munster region.\n\nAnna Millikinâ€™s novels and other writings began to be published in Cork from the 1790s. She and her brother Richard, lawyer and poet, founded the Casket, or Hesperian magazine, a literary periodical, in 1797, which lasted until the eve of the rebellion in 1798. In duodecimo format, it was printed for the proprietors by Anthony Edwards in Castle Street. It contained serialized fiction, short stories, biography and poetry. Her first novel, Corfe Castle, was published by James Haly in 1793, and later novels, Eva (1795), Plantagenet; or secrets of the House of Anjou (1802), and The rival chiefs; or, the battle of Mere (1804) were published by John Connor. Her works attracted a popular audience as can be seen from the subscription lists, and in particular the number of copies taken by booksellers for resale (Kennedy 1999). As a teacher in the English academy for females in Cork, she also wrote textbooks â€˜for the use of her pupilsâ€™ (Millikin 1808).\n\nAnna Millikin, Corfe Castle (Cork, James Haly, 1793), title page and first page of subscription list.\n\nAnna Millikin was from Castlemartyr, County Cork, and was supported by many of the important Cork families: Lord Boyle, Countess Shannon, Lady Harriet Bernard of Bandon, members of the Freke family, as well as her neighbours in Castlemartyr, Youghal, Killeagh, Ardmore and across the harbour in Passage West. Her first novel, Corfe Castle; or historic tracts, was published by James Haly in two volumes duodecimo, costing 5s.5d. (Cork Gazette, 30 Mar 1793; 24 Aug 1793). The subscription list contains 139 names, taking 249 copies of the book, Lord Boyle took 21 sets, and Countess Shannon four sets. Three Dublin booksellers took multiple copies for sale in their bookshops, Patrick Byrne 50 sets, Patrick Wogan 25 sets and Richard M. Butler twelve sets.\n\nAnna Millikin, Eva (Cork, J. Connor, 1795), title page. Advertisement for Eva in The Cavern of death (Cork, J. Connor, 1795).\n\nMillikinâ€™s novel, Eva, in one volume duodecimo, selling at 3s.3d., attracted 171 subscribers for 464 copies of the book. In her â€˜Advertisementâ€™ in a preliminary page, she thanks the subscription gatherers: â€˜her most grateful acknowledgments to those friends, who have so kindly exerted themselves in her favour, as to enable her to produce the following List, without having recourse to the public Printsâ€™ (Millikin 1795). The novel appealed to the trade as a certain bestseller, possibly due to the popularity of Corfe Castle. John Connor, bookseller and proprietor of the circulating library in Cork, the publisher of the work, subscribed to 100 copies, as did Dublin bookseller Patrick Wogan. John Millikin, bookseller in Dublin, who may have been a relative, took 50 copies, while the booksellers James Johnson in Youghal and Thomas White in Cork took twelve each. In this case the copies of the book ordered by booksellers greatly outnumbered those pledged to individual subscribers. John Connor used the final leaf to advertise his new books likely to appeal to this readership, which included novels by Mrs Bennett, Mrs Radcliffe, Miss Gunning and Charlotte Smith. In 1796 John Milliken advertised Eva as one of his new books just published, but this was not his own publication, but one of the 50 copies taken from John Connorâ€™s edition ((The Oracle, 9 Nov 1796). Of the eight novels advertised only four were actually printed by Milliken. This way of advertising was typical of the period, new books were listed as â€˜published byâ€™ the seller, who was offering copies for sale, and did not have a financial stake in the production costs of the edition, except in so far as pledging for 50 or 100 copies can be seen as a subvention to the undertaker of the project.\n\nMrs Creech ran a school for young ladies in Cook Street, Cork, in 1795. She advertised her forthcoming novel, Mary, or the uses of adversity in August of that year, and it was published the following year (Cork Gazette, 5 Sept 1795). Printed in two volumes duodecimo, it attracted 179 subscribers, 61 of them women. John Connor, the publisher, took 100 copies of the book, and Michael Harris, bookseller in Cork, took 25 copies. The novel featured among new books added to the Belfast Circulating Library in July 1796 (Belfast News Letter, 11 Jul 1796).\n\nWomen often wrote anonymously, â€˜by a ladyâ€™, and in many cases the authorâ€™s identity is never revealed. In some cases the identity can be gleaned from the composition of the subscription list. The history of Julia and Cecilia de Valmont is attributed to Sophia Briscoe, a young woman who died young, having written the novel at the age of 17, and the preface was written by one of her relatives. Published in Cork in two volumes duodecimo by John Connor, the author clearly had connections in Limerick and Tipperary. An extract from the novel was published in the literary periodical the Casket in May 1797 (Loeber 2006). Subscribers giving an address in Cork city and county amounted to 40%, but County Limerick provided 25.6%, County Tipperary over 11%, and County Waterford 9% of names, of which twelve individuals were from the Waterford Regiment. The National Library copy of The history of Julia and Cecilia has the ownerâ€™s signature: â€˜Elizabeth Sayers, Bridges Square, Limerick, 22 May 1798â€™. Miss Sayers appears in the subscription list, as do seven other subscribers with an address at The Square in Limerick. The Lord Bishop of Limerick is among the subscribers, Lord and Lady Inchiquin, and the Countess of Clare. William Goggin, bookseller in Limerick, subscribed to 15 sets for local customers. Members of the Cork aristocracy and gentry also supported the novel, including Lord Boyle, the Earl and Countess of Shannon, Lady Doneraile, Lady Gillman, and Lady Longueville. The composition of the list points to its being supported by Anna Millikinâ€™s circle, and publication in the Casket further emphasises this. Six sets were taken by Vincent Dowling, for the Apollo Circulating Library at Suffolk Street, Dublin. Connor took the opportunity of advertising new books available at his circulating library, which included eight novels.\n\nThese novels, all in small format duodecimo size, published within a five year period expected a sizable general readership, with booksellers subscribing to substantial quantities. Multiple copies for sale, and for circulating libraries are recorded. It is not known if the market lived up to expectations. Anna Millikin found that she could not repair the family fortunes by writing, and turned to teaching instead. Mrs Creech also had an outside income from teaching and running a private school. These lists point to print-runs of 500 or so, a small quantity compared with school and college texts, devotional works, and topical or sensational works such as trials. It seems certain that these novels were targeted at the lending libraries where they would reach a large and diverse audience. Dublin booksellers such as Patrick Wogan and Patrick Byrne had an extensive country trade, with contacts throughout Ireland, and it seems likely that they intended to distribute the volumes countrywide to smaller towns and country readers.\n\nSubscription lists show that Cork publications were supported by the local aristocracy and gentry, and subscribers extended across the Munster region, through the counties of Cork, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, and as far as Clare and Kerry. Women authors were encouraged at different levels: at a micro level their pieces were accepted for publication in newspapers and periodicals, and at a macro level novels and books of poetry were published by mainstream booksellers and supported by general audiences and by the book trade.\n\nThe identities of women readers and book buyers are often hidden from view, but subscription lists help to reveal their presence, their tastes, and the authors they supported. Novels and other literary works appealed to women and girls, literary periodicals catered to this taste by providing extracts of new work, and gave a forum for poets to publish their work. The handy duodecimo size of many novels allowed for reading outdoors while walking or taking the air. Easy to fit in a pocket, they facilitated more informal reading habits.\n\nReferences:\n\nBeecher, SeÃ¡n, 1993.

An examination of five works printed by subscription by William Flyn, printer, bookseller and newspaper proprietor at the Shakespeare in Castle Street, Cork, can give a window into this cohort (Kennedy 2009). The titles, published from 1768 to 1775, provide 1,479 names, ranged over six counties in the Munster region: counties Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, Clare, Waterford and Limerick.. The use of subscription lists is not without its problems, but they constitute an important source of evidence that cannot be found elsewhere. The spread of subscribers closely mirrors the distribution patterns of The Hibernian Chronicle, although other factors would also have been at work in gathering subscriptions. Subscription lists do not provide a cross section of book buyers as each one has its own audience, made up of sectional interests, friends or neighbours of the author, readersâ€™ interest in the subject matter, or other unifying strands of which we may not be aware. Furthermore only a small number of publications were produced in this way. The occurrence of five such publications in a seven year period from the same printer gives an opportunity to examine any connections and overlaps between readers, and the distribution of purchasers in a limited geographical area.\n\nFlynâ€™s publication of the twice-weekly Hibernian Chronicle from October 1769 gave him access to the reading public throughout Cork and surrounding counties. He printed 2,000 proposals to establish the newspaper in September 1769, and when he had attracted â€˜a respectable number of ladies and gentlemenâ€™ as subscribers he launched the venture (Hibernian Chronicle, 23 Oct 1769). The paper was published on Mondays and Thursdays, at the price of one penny per issue, or five British shillings (5s.5d. Irish) per annum to town subscribers, and a half guinea (10s.6d.) per annum to country subscribers, for this sum Flyn included a title page and index at the end of each year (Hibernian Chronicle, 31 Dec 1770; 2 Jan 1772). The newspaper was distributed widely using the Post Office network and by employing couriers, whom Flyn paid quarterly (Hibernian Chronicle, 16 Jul 1772). By early 1770 agents were in place in the major Cork towns: Castlemartyr, Cloyne, Kinsale, Mallow, Midleton and Youghal, and by the middle of the year he had an agent in Killarney, County Kerry. These agents were not booksellers but an innkeeper, a merchant, an apothecary, a cooper, two post masters, and a teacher (see Note 1). By 1772 The Hibernian Chronicle was circulated by couriers to 26 towns in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Kerry, â€˜besides a great number to the different post-offices in the kingdomâ€™ (Hibernian Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772). A provincial newspaper created a network by which books and periodicals could be distributed to the smaller towns and country places. The regular delivery of a paper ensured a constant audience for the advertisements carried in its pages. The agents for the newspaper took in subscriptions and orders for books advertised.\n\nThe earliest of the five publications considered here is The history of Hypolitus, Earl of Douglas, translated from the French by a Gentleman, printed in 1768, in duodecimo format and selling at a cost of three British shillings (3s.3d. Irish) bound. This project was undertaken by the printer himself and we have no evidence that the translator needed to pay a subvention. It attracted 291 subscribers, including Cork booksellers John Bardin, who took 21 copies, and Thomas White, who took 14, and John Ferrar, bookseller in Limerick. Flyn took 21 copies for his own bookshop. The history of Hypolitus was translated from the French by local French teacher, Peter Guitton, who ran a boarding school in Cork city, and an advertisement for his school is carried at the end of the subscription list. The original Histoire dâ€™Hypolite by Madame dâ€™Aulnoy was first published in 1690, and was one of the most popular novels of the eighteenth century. This translation appealed to a literary audience, Francophile readers, and members of the Huguenot congregation including Rev. John Madras, minister of the Huguenot church in Cork, and Peter Ardouin, a prominent Huguenot merchant, who took 20 books. It is dedicated to the Right Honourable Richard, Earl of Shannon, a supporter of literary endeavour, who also subscribed to other publications printed by William Flyn.\n\nThe history of Hypolitus (Cork, 1768), titlepage. The works of the late Rev. George Russel (Cork, 1769), titlepage.\n\nThe following year Flyn printed The works of the late Rev. George Russel in two volumes octavo â€˜for the benefit of the authorâ€™s widow and childrenâ€™. This project was a benevolent one and it attracted 323 subscribers, 19 of whom were named in the additional list in volume two. It sold for two British crowns (10s.10d. Irish), sewed, and subscribers could have it bound to their own taste afterwards. Rev. Russel was Church of Ireland Rector of Schull in West Cork and his works were made up of â€˜original poems, translations, letters, essays and criticisms, with an entire translation of the Lettres galantes of Fontenelleâ€™. Clergy and members of the Church of Ireland communities supported this work. On the final two pages Flyn printed a catalogue of â€˜Books published and sold by W. Flynâ€™, including The history of Hypolitus.\n\nFlynâ€™s next subscription project, The modern monitor; or, Flynâ€™s speculations, was entirely his own, being a selection of literary contributions from the pages of The Hibernian Chronicle. As a newspaper the Chronicle carried local and foreign news and advertisements, but Flyn also wished to give it a literary turn, inviting readers of both sexes to contribute pieces to create â€˜a compleat reservoir of politics, history, poetry, literature, agriculture, commerce, â€¦ and everything relative to the fair sexâ€™ (Hibernian Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772). The leading article of each issue was an essay, signed only with an initial or pseudonym. In addition to original essays, the Chronicle reprinted literary and scientific pieces. Flyn was well supported by his editors and contributors, numbering some of Corkâ€™s literary elite. In 1802, when he handed over full control of the Chronicle to his successors, Flyn thanked the public for their support over thirty-three years and paid tribute to â€˜the great talents which first brought it to its maturityâ€™ (Hibernian Chronicle, 22 Mar 1802), and nearly a decade later his obituary stated that the paper was set up â€˜under the auspices and support of the first literary characters in this cityâ€™ (Cork Mercantile Chronicle, 20 Dec 1811). Flyn had as his editor Henry Sheares (Madden 1867, ii, pp 172-78), an eminent banker in Cork, and M.P. for Clonakilty, who guided the literary content of the paper from the beginning until his death in December 1775 (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Nov-4 Dec 1775; 4-7 Dec 1775). Sheares was very influential in the cultural life of Cork at the period and gathered around him a coterie of men and women who made regular contributions to the literary section of the Chronicle. Very much part of this circle was Flynâ€™s daughter, Eliza Haly, a cultured woman deeply involved in literary pursuits. A selection of these literary essays were gathered together and reprinted in The modern monitor. Several copies of this volume have contemporary annotations identifying the authors, one copy belonging to the Countess of Shannon notes some of them (Dublin City Library and Archive: Dix Collection 082). The main regular contributors were the editor, Henry Sheares, often using the signature William Flyn or any of the letters W.F.L.Y.N., Mrs Sheares, Dr John Longfield, Mrs Elizabeth Gray, Dr Richard William Stack of London, Mrs Stack, Miss Waterhouse, Mrs Therry, Mr Comerford and Dr Joseph Fenn Sleigh.\n\nIn July 1770 Flyn issued proposals for printing the first volume of The modern monitor, in duodecimo priced at a British half crown (2s.8Â½d. Irish), bound and lettered (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Jul 1770). He clearly had the intention of producing further volumes in due course. Even though proposals were issued in July 1770, which corresponds with the imprint date of 1771, it may not have appeared until 1774 (Ã“ Casaide, typescript). All surviving copies are the second edition, the first edition being publication in the Chronicle. Subscriptions were taken by booksellers James Williams and Thomas Walker in Dublin, Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford, John Ferrar and Catherine Long in Limerick, and at all country places where the Chronicle was circulated in 1770 (Hibernian Chronicle, 30 Jul 1770). The subscription list is quite small, 102 names, including most of the contributors, some of whom subscribed to multiple copies (see Note 2).\n\nThe modern monitor (Cork, 1771), titlepage. James Poulson, Moral and divine observations (Cork, 1775), titlepage.\n\nIn 1773 Flyn printed Richard Challonerâ€™s Considerations upon Christian truths in two volumes duodecimo, selling at 5s.5d. bound (Challoner 1773). He advertised proposals for printing it by subscription in January 1772, his subscription agents were booksellers Richard Fitzsimons and Thomas Walker in Dublin, Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford, Edmund Finn in Kilkenny, and Catherine Long in Limerick. Volume one was completed in February 1773, with volume two due to follow shortly (Hibernian Chronicle, 13 Jan 1772; 4 Feb 1773). Flyn specialised in the sale of Catholic books, by wholesale and retail, and he advertised it as part of a â€˜variety of Catholic books and school books, printed and sold by William Flynâ€™, listed in his edition of An abstract of the Doway catechism in 1774. Only volume two of this work has survived, the main subscription list in volume one is lost, and volume two contains the supplementary list of â€˜Subscribers whose names were returned too late to be inserted in the first volume.â€™ This list comprises just 150 names, a large proportion are from County Kerry, including the Catholic bishop, Rev. John Madgett, who took 80 sets. At a cost of 5s.5d. this amounts to a total of Â£420, with at least Â£200 to be paid in advance. This is an extraordinary commitment, amounting to a subvention for the edition.\n\nRichard Challoner, Considerations upon Christian truths (Cork, 1773), titlepage. William Flynâ€™s advertisement in Abstract of the Doway catechism (Cork, 1774).\n\nThe fifth title, James Poulsonâ€™s Moral and divine observations, printed for the author and sold by William Flyn and Thomas White, has the largest subscription list of the five, comprising 613 names taking 732 copies of the book. Addresses are given for many, but a note states that â€˜those subscribers whose places of abode are not specified, reside in or near Corkâ€™. The mainly religious observations, interspersed with remarks on land and estate improvement, are the result of a tour through Munster, in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Tipperary, Clare and Kerry. It is dedicated to the Right Honourable John De Courcy, Baron of Kingsale, and in return Lord and Lady Kingsale each subscribed to three copies of the book. At the end of the octavo volume, completed in January 1775, the author promises another volume in April or May, but this does not appear to have been published. An expanded version in two volumes was published by subscription in Belfast in 1777, as Observations on various subjects (Poulson 1777), volume one was dedicated to the Baron of Kingsale, and volume two to his widow, Lady Dowager Kingsale.\n\nA cross-section of readers and potential readers can be glimpsed in Cork and surrounding counties at this period. The subject matter of the different works determined their particular support: The history of Hypolitus and The modern monitor appealed to literary subscribers. The works of Rev. George Russel attracted large support from members and clergy of the Church of Ireland. Challonerâ€™s Considerations was supported by Catholic individuals and families. Poulsonâ€™s Moral and divine observations is a religious work by a local author with a local following. The analysis of the subscription lists is limited as most do not provide occupations or addresses. Those subscribers who have a title (Rev., Capt., Mrs, Miss) are most easily categorised. In the five lists considered here women account for over 14% of subscribers. Members of the professions are represented in small numbers: clergy (just under 10%), the military (over 5%), legal, political and administrative (under 4%), and medical (over 2%). In 111 cases one customer subscribed to two of the five publications, and in a further eleven cases one subscriber took three titles. Thomas White, bookseller in Cork, subscribed to four of the five publications.\n\nFive booksellers, including William Flyn, appear on the lists, but with a substantial subscription list capturing most of the interested readers, only small numbers of a work would be taken for a booksellerâ€™s stock. Flyn, as the publisher, often took multiple copies for sale to non-subscribers in his bookshop. He took 21 copies of The history of Hypolitus and 20 copies of James Poulsonâ€™s Observations, but just one copy of Rev. Russelâ€™s Works. Poulsonâ€™s work was obviously considered likely to be popular, Thomas White, the other undertaker of the edition, took 50 copies. White also took 14 copies of The history of Hypolitus and one copy each of The modern monitor and Rev. Russelâ€™s Works. John Bardin, bookseller in Cork, took 21 copies of The history of Hypolitus and one copy of Rev Russelâ€™s Works. Eugene Daly, bookseller and bookbinder in Cork, took seven copies of The modern monitor, and one copy of The history of Hypolitus.\n\nMany names which appear on the lists are known as book collectors. Dr John Longfield, one of the contributors to The Hibernian Chronicle, subscribed to three of the five publications, and he is known to have subscribed to a range of publications coming from Cork, Dublin and London presses. From a distinguished North Cork family, he practised medicine at Patrick Street, Cork, having qualified at Edinburgh (Longfield 1759). He had a keen interest in the sciences, particularly astronomy and mathematics. He corresponded with the Astronomer Royal, and letters from 1773, 1774 and 1779, on the subject of his observations for determining the latitude and longitude of Cork, were published in The philosophical transactions of the Royal Society (Lecky 1917).He subscribed to such works as Dr John Ruttyâ€™s Natural history of the county of Dublin (Dublin, 1772), Joseph Priestleyâ€™s History of vision, light and colours (London, 1772), Thomas Sheridanâ€™s General dictionary of the English language (Dublin, 1784), John Hellensâ€™ Mathematical essays (London, 1788), Michael Taylorâ€™s Tables of logarithms (1792) and Beaufortâ€™s Memoir of a map of Ireland (London, 1792). His interests also included poetry, subscribing to J. S. Doddâ€™s Essays and poems, and James De la Courâ€™s A prospect of poetry, both published in Cork in 1770, the first by Eugene Swiney and the second by Thomas Lord, and John Leslieâ€™s Killarney, a poem, published in London in 1772.\n\nHenry Sheares, editor of The Hibernian Chronicle, his wife, Jane Anne, and sons Henry and John, were frequent subscribers to literary works published in Cork and Dublin. Henry senior supported several Cork publications, subscribing to James Eyre Weekesâ€™ Poems on several occasions in 1743, Charles Smithâ€™s Antient and present state of the county and city of Cork in 1750, David Fordyceâ€™s Dialogues concerning education in 1755 and J. S. Doddâ€™s Essays and poems in 1770. Lieutenant, later General, Charles Vallancey, the antiquary and Irish language enthusiast, subscribed to Poulsonâ€™s Moral and divine observations. His library of over one thousand lots was sold by auction after his death in 1812 (Vallancey 1813). An army engineer, Vallancey came to Ireland with Lord Townshend to assist in a military survey, he designed the plans for Queenâ€™s Bridge in Dublin and was responsible for fortifications on Spike Island in Cork harbour. He translated two works from French, Essay on fortification (Dublin, 1757) and The field engineer by De Clairac (Dublin, 1760). Another subscriber, Barry Yelverton, later Lord Avonmore, also collected an extensive library in his lifetime (Yelverton 1807). When he subscribed to The history of Hypolitus in 1768 he is listed as barrister-at-law, he went on to become attorney general for Ireland in 1782, and chief baron of the exchequer in 1784.\n\nSeveral well-known county families are in evidence across the lists: Richard and Catherine Boyle, Earl and Countess of Shannon, the leading Protestant family in the county with their seat at Castlemartyr, County Cork, were subscribers. The Earl subscribed to The history of Hypolitus in 1768, and both Earl and Countess subscribed to The works of the Late Rev. George Russel in 1769, this last certainly to support the cause of the rectorâ€™s widow and children. They did not subscribe to The modern monitor yet an annotated copy has survived that belonged to the Countess. Lord and Lady Midleton, the Countess of Tyrone, Lord and Lady Blayney, Lord and Lady Kinsale, and Lord Mountcashel represented the aristocracy. Henry Cole Bowen built up a renowned library at his country house, Bowenscourt, County Cork. He and his wife subscribed to The works of the late Rev. George Russel, he had also subscribed to John Ruttyâ€™s Essay towards a â€¦ history of the mineral waters of Ireland in 1757 and William Templeâ€™s History of the general rebellion in Ireland in 1766. The local administration included the Honourable St John Jefferyes, M.P., Lieutenant Governor of Cork, the Honourable Joseph Lysaght, M.P., Collector of Cork, John Travers, Mayor of Cork, Hugh Carleton, Recorder of Cork, Thomas Brown, Register of Cork, Aldermen John Harding, Philips, Westropp, and Samuel Maylor of Cork, John Newman, Collector of Kinsale, Matthew Pennefeather, Mayor of Cashel, Nicholas Stout, Mayor of Youghal, Richard Harte, Mayor of Limerick, Robert Hallam, Town Clerk of Limerick, and Thomas Dixon, Under-Sheriff of Limerick. In all, the lists represent the professional people, local administration, merchants and tradesmen, the middling and higher clergy, country gentry and members of the local aristocracy. There is evidence for cross-confessional support for these publications consistent with their subject matter.\n\nSubscriptions were put in place to fund a project, half the cost of a work was paid in advance to provide finance, and the remainder was paid when the volume was delivered. For a project with an uncertain market this indemnified the printer against losses and gave them an estimate of the projected audience to enable them to assess the print run. Subscription lists do not give evidence of reading, but purchase of a title shows an area of interest for the subscriber and support for a particular author. Purchasers had the pleasure of seeing their names listed as a permanent record of their support. A higher level of support is shown when a subscriber takes multiple copies. In the case of these five lists we see a group of people who were all, at least once, customers of William Flyn or his agents, spread across the province of Munster. The social composition of a list is of interest, although this can be more difficult to ascertain. Subscription lists are a good source for identifying women book buyers, otherwise largely unknown to us. The geographical distribution of customers, when known, reflects the influence of the author and his or her subscription gatherers, and shows the commercial reach of the printer. Some works are printed â€˜for the authorâ€™ by a printer, this puts the financial burden on the author, and could point to a subvention or other form of funding needed before a printer would take on a project. Finally a large list of names is always of interest to historians, helping to give depth and complexity to a past society, and to show links and interactions between individuals and families.\n\nNotes:\n\nNote 1.
