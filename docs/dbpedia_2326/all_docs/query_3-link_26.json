        "text": "A few things I recall from the days of attending Mass every Sunday at Holy Name.\n\n1-Communion.\n\n2-The collection box. I was always broke. Never had any cash to drop in.\n\n3-The altar boys. I was jealous of them. Heard they made money for weddings.\n\n4-Shaking hands with the people around you when the priest told us to.\n\n5-Reciting “The Our Father.”\n\n6-“Mass is ended, go in peace.” Music to my ears.\n\nHonorable Mention: Couldn’t play basketball in the boys schoolyard while mass was going on…\n\nThose were the days my friends…\n\nE-Mail: SteveFinamore@yahoo.com\n\nA message from Nick Sisto.\n\nDo you remember being at the required 9 o’clock required mass on Sunday morning?\n\nSeveral things stand out…\n\nAmongst them, Msgr. Downing would give his homily before mass started. After Communion he would walk to the pulpit and everyone would kneel in unison and recite; “Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus…”\n\nMost of the time the mass would end with everyone joining the organ while it played, “Oh My God.” It was a very short hymn with only four lines.\n\nOh my God, I believe in you,\n\nOh my God I adore you,\n\nOh my God I hope in you,\n\nOh my God I love you…\n\nWe would sing these phrases over and over; and the organ notes would get slightly higher each time. Somehow, everyone seemed to know when the song was over.\n\nIt was often said that Msgr. Downing wrote this piece himself. Wouldn’t it be fitting to reintroduce this piece of music as we work to restore Holy Name to its former glory?\n\nIs there anyone who would have a copy of the music or is talented enough to try and recreate the music from memory?\n\nTo get involved and for more information, please like us on Facebook (Holy Name of Jesus Brooklyn Church Restoration Project), contact the Buildings Committee at HNJBuildings@aol.com or call the Holy Name Rectory at 718-768-3071.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSteve\n\nHoops135@hotmail.com\n\nOur own Pat Fenton with an amazing recollection of the neighborhood and the teens who lived here.\n\nIn their heart of hearts, most of the guys and the girls who appear in the Windsor Terrace “Brooklyn Gang” pictures, were really good people. Even the photographer, Bruce Davidson has said that the book is not really about a gang, it’s more about a bunch of young people and their lives together. They certainly were not the toughest guys in our neighborhood.\n\n(Courtesy of Bruce Davidson, ‘Brooklyn Gang’)\n\nI was very close to Junior Rice, and Bengie, and Lefty Jensen who appear in much of the pictures, and on the cover of Bruce Davidson’s book. When I was young, I stayed over at Junior’s house on 20th Street almost as much as my own. His older brother Bob Rice and I are still as close as brothers. Unfortunately for them, they got lost somewhere between the violent culture that existed in the 50′s in parts of our Windsor Terrace neighborhood, and the sweet innocence which I think really represented it. Junior passed away recently, and so did Lefty Jensen; Bengie has managed to turn his life around.\n\nThis I remember about Lefty Jensen, who I once went out to a shoe store in Bay Ridge with in the 50′s, a place that sold second-hand motorcycle boots, he had this sort of James Dean sensitivity to him. Sadly, it probably helped to destroy him. He died way too young. The only good thing I walk away with is, the three of them, Junior, Lefty, and Bengie will live on, forever young together, on the cover of Bruce’s book, “Brooklyn Gang.”\n\nTruth is, we were all lucky to grow up in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, a neighborhood that to me was like a working-class opera taking place every day of our lives. Yeah, it had its share of violence and drugs, but I think overall it had a certain pride, patriotism, and a strong belief in doing the right thing in life. The choice was ours. And most of us learned well from those lessons we were taught here.\n\nIt had the original McFadden Brothers American Legion Post on 9th Avenue when it was located near 17th Street in the vast former, wedding hall of Sorrentos Italian Restaurant. And all through the 50’s and into the 60’s, when neighborhood soldiers came home from the wars, they would be welcomed here.\n\nSimple “football weddings” were made up of cold cut sandwiches wrapped in wax paper and passed across the table like footballs, barrels and barrels of tap beer and plates of cheese and crackers, some set ups of Seagram Seven and ginger ale, and a live three-piece band playing, and people dancing. And they were the best weddings ever.\n\nOn nights when Holy Name Church would have a Novena the church would get so packed with kids and adults that they had to open up the gates to the altar to let people sit there. And we all had Holy Name School yard where other lessons of life were being taught to us, lessons we would take with us forever.\n\nEvery Irish bar in the neighborhood had a baseball team, and 17th Street on a Saturday afternoon had stick ball tournaments that went on all day. Come the summer and 17th Street would be closed down from 9th to 8th Avenue for a P.A.L. play street. We had the Sanders Theatre and Prospect Park to fish in, and a wonderful zoo that we could walk to. And in the cold winter when the streets were empty and covered with new snow it was still safe enough to go down your block alone and trade comic books at friends’ houses. It was good to be young then.\n\nHOOPS135@HOTMAIL.COM\n\nThe one unbreakable staple of our neighborhood was the outstanding people; always there for each other.\n\nAs kids, we didn’t realize how much help was available to us (at least I didn’t know).\n\nWhether it was a coach at Holy Name, a teacher, a friend, a store owner up on the Avenue or even a neighbor; if you looked hard enough, there was help. Speaking of help, did they have ‘Self-Help’ books back in the day?\n\nMatter of fact, sometimes I don’t think we fully realize how much we can help others. If only I knew back then, what I know now. Mamma mia!\n\nI recently came across something on Facebook that inspired me to step up to the plate.\n\nOften times you hear about a local fundraiser or someone putting on an event for some sort of inspiring situation.\n\nWith the many readers of the blog, I felt like I could raise awareness on an all-important cause and let people know about a special,upcoming event.\n\n6th Annual Fundraiser\n\nValentine’s Day Dinner/Dance\n\nFor Briann’s Angels\n\nAll proceeds to: Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF)\n\nPlease join Karen Burke-Abruzzese and Friends for a night of dinner, drinks and dancing. Listen to the sounds of DJ Joey Pira.\n\nSaturday, February 11,2012\n\nSheperd’s Hall at Holy Name Church\n\n245 Prospect Park West\n\n7:00 PM to Midnight.\n\n$60.00 donation for admission per person.\n\nContact Karen at: kabruzzese@nyc.rr.com\n\nYou can also stop in Farrell’s to see Hooley or Rhythm and Booze on 10th avenue and Prospect avenue to see Jamie.\n\nRSVP by January 30.\n\nClick here for the JDRF Website.\n\nIn speaking with Karen, she told me that the night always turns into a neighborhood reunion.\n\nSo come on out and have a good time with friends from the neighborhood but most important, you’re helping a great cause.\n\nIf you can’t make it out to the event, help us spread the word…because if you’re from the neighborhood, it’s what we do!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSteve\n\nHoops135@hotmail.com"
