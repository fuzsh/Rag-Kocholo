His real income in 1862 from all sources, after the above expenditure, was £311 4s. 5d. It is to be remarked, that in all parishes receiving minister's money a Curate whose stipend is £100 per annum costs the Rector but £75 per an. ; or a Curate at X745 costs the Rector but £56 5s. It is also to be noted that the true value of any benefice which is entitled to minister's money varies with the poor-rate, or income tax, or as often as any change takes place in the items of necessary expenditure, or in the number of Curates employed. The income of the chancellorship may in future years be increased by an addition of nearly £300 per annum, if there be no renewals granted to the present tenants of their holdings. The previous Chancellors took fines, <strong>and</strong> renewed leases at a merely nominal rent. <strong>ST</strong>. <strong>PAUL</strong>. <strong>1726.</strong> Sept . 19.
