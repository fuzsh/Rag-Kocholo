        "text": "Part II. History of Thomond\n\nBook of Forfeitures and Distributions: Notes\n\n1. The whole parish of Bunratty belonged to the Earl of Thomond, and formed that magnificent park so highly lauded by Rinuccini and his secretary.\n\nIn the year 1663, John Cooper, Esq., is returned, in the list of tenants of Clare, as liable for the subsidy levied upon the whole parish of Bunratty. He was, therefore, the tenant of the Earl for all the lands in the parish.\n\n2. Ballycunneen is incorrectly placed here. It belongs to the parish of Drumline.\n\nDuring the reign of Queen Anne, the Earl of Thomond made lettings, in perpetuity, of the whole of this parish to the following persons:— Bunratty, to Thomas Studdert, Esq., at the yearly rent of £120. Clonmoney, to Messrs. Robt. and John Westropp, yearly rent £180. Ballycunneen, to Michl. Hickey, yearly rent, £20. Bunratty Park, to Edwd. Dalton, Esq., yearly rent £70.\n\n3. Sir Henry Ingoldsby, Bart., to whom many denominations of land were granted under the Cromwellian Settlement, was son of Elizabeth Cromwell, niece of the Protector. He was an able officer of the Parliamentary army, and his proceedings in the subjugation of the South of Ireland were rigorous and merciless in the extreme. He married the daughter of Sir Hardress Waller of Castletown, Co. Limerick, another Presbyterian like himself.\n\n4. In 1659, the “Titulado” of Caherteige was John O’Ruddane. This Spanish term Titulado, is used by Sir William Petty, in a census of Ireland taken by him in 1659, to denote the tenants who held from the great grantees under the Act of Settlement. These were in Clare, the Earl of Thomond, Lord Inchiquin, Lord Clare, the Bishops of Killaloe and Kilfenora, Sir Henry Ingoldsby, and others. The Titulados appear to have held their lands by limited tenures, scarcely any of their descendants being now, or for a long time past, found in the county. They were a little Protestant garrison scattered through the country, and placed there to cooperate with the other Cromwellians to whom lands had been assigned, in keeping down the Catholic inhabitants. Petty’s census was discovered by the late Mr. Hardinge amongst the papers preserved in the collection of the Marquis of Lansdowne. A transcript, made by him, is deposited in the Royal Irish Acadamy.\n\n5. In 1659, Roger Hickey was Titulado of Clonloghan, and in 1661, Wm. Hartwell was the Bishop’s tenant.\n\n6. In 1659, Wm. Sarsfield was Titulado of Drumgeely, and in 1663, Patrick Sarsfield was tenant. Afterwards, Robert Hickman had a lease of Drumgeely at the yearly rent of £20.\n\n7. In 1663, Turlogh O’Brien was tenant of Leamaneigh and Ballynoosk.\n\n8. In 1663, George Clancy was tenant of Killulla and Lisarinka.\n\n9. Nicholas Fanning was Mayor of Limerick in 1630, and was, doubtless, a mortagee of these lands in 1641.\n\n10. In 1663, Thomas Cullen, Esq., was tenant of Lisconor and Lismacleane.\n\n11. In 1659, Daniel O’Brien, gent., was Titulado, and in 1663, Cormuck Hickey was tenant of Tullyglass.\n\n12. In 1659, Pierce Arthur, gent., was Titulado of Tullyvarraga.\n\n13. In 1610, Conor, son of Teige MacNamara of Smithstown, claimed Ballycaseybeg as against the Earl of Thomond, but in vain.\n\n14. Tenant of Crossagh in 1663, Donagh na Croishe MacNamara.\n\n15. Tenant of Culleen in 1663, George Clancy.\n\n16. Titulados of Drumline in 1659, Daniel MacNamara, and John his son.\n\n17. Tenant of Knocknecullin in 1663, Cormuck Hickey; of Ballycasey, John Reddan and Michael Leaver; of Ballycuneen, Michl. Stritch; and of Enagh, Maurice Halloran.\n\n18. Titulado of Smithstown in 1659, Maurice O’Halloran, gent.\n\n19. Titulado of Tullyvarraga in 1659, Richard Clancy, gent. In the reign of Queen Anne, the Earl of Thomond made a lease for ever, to John Miller Esq., of Ballycaseybeg, at the yearly rent of £100, and of Drumline to Thos. Westropp Esq., at the yearly rent of £70.\n\n20. Titulado of Ardkyle, in 1659, Oliver Bourke, gent. Tenant of same in 1663, Daniel MacNamara.\n\n21. Tenant of Feenagh in 1663, Thos. Fanning. Mrs. Wilson became tenant, in perpetuity, of Feenagh in 1712.\n\n22. Tenants of Rath in 1663, Wm. Purefoy, Esq., and Jeremiah Reeves.\n\n23. Titulados of Rosmanagher in 1659, John Tomkins, Edmond Somers, John Leo, and Michael Fitzgerald. Tenant in 1663, John Conyers. In 1610, Rosmanagher was claimed from the Earl, by Mahone, son of Donogh MacNamara, of Kilkishen, but his claim was disallowed. In 1642, the castle of Rosmanagher was occupied by a man named Christian Coule. The Hon. Robert O’Brien, in his notes to Dineley’s Journal, mentions that in 1675, Abraham Dester obtained from the Earl of Thomond, a lease of the castle and two plow-lands, at £103 10s. yearly rent. The lease was afterwards converted into a fee—farm grant, and the lands belong still to the same family, who have assumed the name of D’Esterre. Its present representative is Henry V. D’Esterre, Esq., J.P., of Rosmanagher.\n\nDuring Queen Anne’s reign the Earl of Thomond made leases in perpetuity of the following lands in this parish, in addition to Rosmanagher:— Ardkyle to John Hickie, at the yearly rent of £5; Feenagh, to R. Wilson, yearly rent £35; Seersha to Thos. Vandeleur, yearly rent £4.\n\n24. In 1663, Thomas Cullen, Esq., was tenant of the townlands of Stonehall, Carrowbane, and Inishmacnaghtan; John Reddan of Ballycalla; and Pierce Creagh, of Garrynamona and Rineanna. In 1661, Thomas Cullen of Stonehall, was High Sheriff of Clare. He was one of the first Justices of the Peace appointed for the County in 1662, and was evidently a man of position and authority. More than twenty years before this time (in 1635), he was one of a civil survey jury, at an Inquisition held at Clare. After the expiration of his lease, he appears to have left Stonehall, for it was acquired by Sir Donogh O’Brien of Dromoland, from Sir Henry Ingoldsby. Sir Donogh settled it, with other large estates beside, upon Henry, the son of his second marriage. This Henry resided at Stonehall, until his marriage with Miss Stafford of Blatherwycke Park in Northamptonshire, to which place he removed, and it has continued to be the principal residence of his descendants up to this time.\n\nIn the above list the townlands of Ballyhennessy and Carrigerry are omitted. Ballyhennessy was let, in the reign of Queen Anne, by the Earl of Thomond, to Thomas Spaight, Richard Wilson, and James Fitzgerald, at the yearly rent of £20, by lease for ever; Inishmacnaghtan to Henry O’Brien, at £33 per annum; and Feenish Island to James Fitzgerald, at £20.\n\n25. Ardmaclancy.— The tomb of this Teige O’Ruddane is in the old church of Kilfinaghta, and his epitaph will be found where I have described that building. The lands of Ardmaclancy and Ballysheenbeg subsequently became the property of Daniel Molony, a Captain in O’Brien’s Regiment of Foot, who was attainted for his adherence to the cause of James II. His lands were sold in consequence, by the Chichester House Commissioners in 1703, to Thomas St. John of Ballymulcashel, Esq., for £268. See Book of Sales in Library of King’s Inns, Dublin.\n\n26. In the abstracts of grants under the Acts of Explanation and Settlement, Peter Crainsborough is described as of “Waterford, gent.; son of Marcus, Mercht.” He was a Transplanted Papist. He sold his lands in Clare to Henry Ivers and others.\n\n27. Ballycullen.— The Thomas Fanning named as part proprietor of Ballycullen and Ballynevan, was a citizen of Limerick who, no doubt, was a mortgagee of those lands.\n\n28. Ballymulcashel.— Bartholomew Stacpoole was a citizen of Limerick. He was the son of James Stacpoole of that place, who, in 1636, married a daughter of Dr. Arthur. A curious account of the wedding presents bestowed upon her is found in the Arthur MSS. as given in Lenihan’s History of Limerick. This Bartholomew, in the female line, was the ancestor of the Earls of Limerick.\n\n29. Conor O’Brien, proprietor of Ballymulcashel in 1641, was the grandson of Teige Oultagh O’Brien. Clare Inquisitions, Sixmilebridge, 10th January, 1628.\n\n30. Ballynevanbeg.— William Lysaght was Sheriff of Limerick city in 1636. Lenihan’s History, p. 702. Nothing is known of Robert Dixon.\n\n31. Ballyroe and Castlecrine.— According to the Clare Inquisitions, David Ruddane was the owner of Ballyroe in 1610. Dominick Fanning was Mayor of Limerick in 1646. Of the Colonel William Purefoy, to whom grants of lands in this and other parishes were made, little is known. In 1659, he was Titulado of Rosroe castle, and afterwards, in 1683, he had a suit with Lord Clare touching the ownership of that place; but the confiscation of the Viscount’s estates put an end to the matter. Note by the Hon. Robert O’Brien to Dineley’s Journal.\n\n32. Ballyarrilla (Mount Ivers).— Henry Ivers was “Titulado” at Ballymolony, parish of Killokennedy (vide Petty’s census). He is thus described by Thomas Dineley in his Journal written in 1680. [See Journal of Kilkenny Archæological Society, vol. i., new series, 1856—57, pages 170, &c.] “Within a quarter of a mile of Sixmilebridge is a castle belonging to Henry Ivers, Esq. The gentleman owner hereof, came over, [a young man, clerk to one Mr. Fowles, a barrister], since the King’s Restoration, and hath, in this time, by his industry, acquired one thousand pounds a year. The first and chiefest of his rise was occasioned by being concerned in the revenue, as Clerk to the King’s Commissioners for settling the Quit Rents, and afterwards became the Deputy Receiver, is now in the commission of the peace, not worth less than sixteen hundred pounds a year.” In a note, written by the late Hon. Robert O’Brien, at foot of this passage, he says, that Henry Ivers became patentee, under the Acts of Explanation and Settlement of 5,773 statute acres of profitable land, to which a further large area was added under the name of waste. By his patent of Ballyluddane East, adjoining Sixmilebridge, he obtained power to hold a Saturday market and two fairs yearly, on part of the lands of Ballyarrilla, alias Mount Ivers. In 1668, he was appointed his agent by Colonel Daniel O’Brien, third Viscount Clare, and from him he obtained leases of considerable tracts of lands. He was married to the daughter of Captain Stephens of Ballysheen, was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1669, and High Sheriff in 1673. He died in 1691, and was succeeded by his son John, who was elected Member of Parliament for Clare in 1715. He is now represented by his descendant James Butler Ivers, Esq., J.P., of Mount Ivers. In reference to the Mr. Fowles above mentioned, Mr. O’Brien further writes, “The lands of Tarbert, County Kerry were, in 1666, possessed by Cornet John Cooper of Bunratty, a Cromwellian officer to whom the mother of Sir Donat O’Brien, (the well known Mary Roe) of Leamaneh and Dromoland was married, and by whose means the estates of Sir Donat were preserved at the general confiscation. Thomas Fowle of Dublin obtained a judgement for £1,800, principal against Cooper, and seized his lands of Tarbert in execution. Afterwards, Fowles’ executor let them to Henry Ivers for £100 per annum, to be paid at Strongbow’s Tomb. At the Chichester House sale of forfeited lands in 1702, Henry Ivers purchased several estates. In the adjoining town of Sixmilebridge, belonging to the Earl of Thomond, several of the new Protestant settlers built houses. They found that residence in a town, inhabited by their co—religionists was conducive to their safety, and the Earl was desirous also to establish a Protestant colony at the place. On the adjacent townland of Cappa, he caused a residence for himself to be erected, and it appears to have been used as a hunting lodge. It was known by the name of Bunratty Lodge, and the townland yet retains the name of Cappa Lodge. The rents, says the Hon. Mr. O’Brien, paid at that time for houses and plots of ground bear a very high proportion as compared with the value of lands. Ten pounds a year, with a covenant to rebuild, was the rent of a house and shop; and £52 per annum that of a malt house at Sixmilebridge. At the same time, the best land in the neighbourhood could be had for five shillings an acre, with a lease for ever.\n\nAbout the time of Queen Anne’s reign, leases in perpetuity were made by Henry Earl of Thomond, of the following lands in this parish: Cappagh castle, to John Hickie and Thomas Spaight, yearly rent, £25; Cappagh Oilmills, to Robert Pease, and Mrs. Bew, yearly rent, £30; of the town of Sixmilebridge, to Sir Donat O’Brien, Bart., yearly rent, £125; Ballysheen, to Henry Stephens, yearly rent, £30; Ballymulcashel, to Thomas St. John, yearly £5; Cloonteen, to Cornelius Gilareagh, yearly rent, £2; Cappagh lodge, to Thomas Spaight, yearly rent, £30; Moygalla, to Richard Wilson, yearly rent, £27; Ballycullen, to the same, yearly rent, £16.\n\nIn 1664, the persons in occupation of certain lands in this parish were as follows; Ballyroe, Thomas Green; Moygalla, Mat Curtis; Ballymulcashel, George Bennis: Cloonteen, Mort Sullivan; Ballynevan, Wm. Rice; Ballyarrila, John Stockton; Ballysheenbeg, Mahone O’Ruddane; Ballysheenmore, Mrs. Stephenson; Cappagh, north and south, Ralph Conyers.\n\nIn 1664, and following years, the town of Sixmilebridge was made liable to ten pounds per annum as its portion of the subsidy tax levied on the County of Clare.\n\n33. Ballintlea.— In 1624, John, and Teige MacNamara of Ballintlea, claimed lands which had been granted by patent to the Earl of Thomond, but their claim was disallowed, (see Clare Inquisitions). In 1663, Ballintlea was occupied by Thomas Green alone.\n\n34. Ballybroughan.— Nicholas White was afterwards attainted, because of his adhesion to the cause of James II., and his estate of Ballybroughan was sold in 1703, by the Chichester House Commissioners to John Ivers. He had been originally a Transplanted Papist.\n\n35. Ballyliddane.— About the year 1608, the Earl of Thomond gave the lands of Ballyliddane to Simon Morris, in exchange for lands in the Barony of Moyarta; (see Clare Inquisitions temp. Charles I.). In 1624, James Morris claimed Ballyliddane as against the Earl to whom it had been recently granted by patent, but his claim was disallowed. James’ widow was Honoria O’Brien (see Clare Inquisitions). In 1663, the Ballyliddanes were occupied by F. Weedon, Thomas Harold, and Wm. Thompson.\n\n36. Ballymorris.— The Commissioners for settling the forfeited estates having granted Ballymorris and Cratloemoyle to Sir Henry Ingoldsby, under the Act of Settlement, claim was made to them, by John MacNamara, the ancient owner, and his right to them was confirmed by Decree of the Court of Claims, dated 16th July, 1663. [Appendix to 15th Annual Report on Irish Records, Dublin, 1824.] In this townland is found a hill, called in Irish, Knockthurles, which means the hill of the fortress. It is situate in the vicinity of the Shannon, and it seems probable that it was a stronghold of the Danes. The name of the townland itself appears to be derived from one Maurice, a chieftain of the Danes, at Limerick, whose name is mentioned by Keating. In 1659, Ballymorris was occupied by Pat Brett and his son Francis.\n\n37. Brickhill and Moyhill.— These townlands included the various sub-denominations above mentioned. They were granted, in 1610 by patent, to the Earl of Thomond. In 1656, he lease them to Teige O’Brien and Giles Vandeleur at the yearly rent of £70. In 1659, Vandeleur alone was tenant, and in 1675 he obtained a renewal of the lease. He was the ancestor of the Vandeleurs of Ralahine and Sixmilebridge. His father, a Dutchman, was the first of the name known in Clare. He occupied the mill at Sixmilebridge, and was a maltster and tanner there. His son Giles was appointed Collector of Customs at Limerick, and soon became a man of importance, for we find him High Sheriff of Clare in 1664. About the year 1680, Giles was employed with George Purdon, to adjust the incidence of the Crown Rents upon the various profitable lands in that county; and in the course of his inquiries became well—acquainted with the character of the soil. When Dineley visited Ireland in 1680, he found Giles Vandeleur residing in the castle of Ralahine, the former residence of one of the MacNamaras who had been expelled, and he describes him as a Dutchman. In 1687, he obtained a lease of lands at Kilrush and other places in the Barony of Moyarta from the Earl of Thomond. These he assigned to his second son, the Rev. John Vandeleur, M.A., Rector of Kilrush, of whom it is recorded that he fought and was severely wounded at the battle of Aughrim. This John became tenant in fee farm to the Earl, of his manor of Kilrush, and was the ancestor of Captain Hector Vandeleur, the present proprietor of those extensive estates. Dineley gives the inscription on the tomb of Mrs. Vandeleur in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Limerick. It sets forth that she was daughter of John Fitzgerald, Dean of Cork, by Miss Boyle, daughter of R. Boyle, Archbishop of Tuam, and that she died in 1678, aged 40 years, leaving issue eight sons and seven daughters. No trace of her monument exists now in St. Mary’s. (For these particulars, see Dineley’s Journal with the notes of the Hon. Robert O’Brien; Linehan’s History of Limerick; Affidavits touching massacres of 1641; Liber Munerum Hiberniæ.) As regards Teige O’Brien, Vandeleur’s co—tenant, he obtained patent of some lands in the barony of Tulla, under the Act of Settlement, but having joined King James in 1689, and become a captain in Lord Clare’s Dragoons, he was attainted, and his estate forfeited. [Dalton, King James’ Army List.]\n\n38. Portdrine.— “The Lord Henrye O’Bryen, Earl of Thomonde, 19o Martii, 1635, did lease unto me, for four score and nineteen years, three plowlands and a halfe in Cratlaghmore and Portreyne, at the rent of a red rose in midsummer, or a grain of pepper if it be demanded, upon condition, that if his honour, his heyres, exors., or assignes, die within six months after warning be given them be me, my heyres, and assigns, pay us in whole sum and entyre payment the sum of one thousand and fiftie pounds, sterling, with all arrears of interest thereof, then the said lease to be expired. Wm. Brickdale, Esq., and George Connessis, Esq., are bound with his honor in bonds of the statute staple for the warrantie and performance of covenants. His honor, by a special note under his hand, is bound to save me from all subsidies and other country charges to be imposed on that land during that mortgage. Edmond, Lord Baron of Castleconnell, who in right of his wife, Lady Margaret Thornton, the relict of Donogh O’Brien of Carrigogunnil, was tenant of the said Earl in the premises did attorne tenant unto me, and payed me during his life, a hundred pounds rent thereout per annum. And since his death, the said Lady Dowager Margaret, of Castleconnell, payed me duly every year, one hundred pounds sterling thereout until Easter, 1642, inclusively, but ever since then payed me no rent thereout, and yet detained the land until she deserted it in anno 1650.” From Dr. Thos. Arthur’s MS. Diary, quoted in Linehan’s History of Limerick, p. 144. In a marginal note, the land is said to contain in Kilfintinan, Portreigne, 243 acres profitable, and 58 1/10 acres unprofitable; in Killeely parish, 250 profitable, 183 unprofitable, in anno 1637, in Strafford’s time. The Civil Survey jurors in 1635 were; Rob. Starkey, Turlogh M‘Mahon, Paul M‘Namara, Neptune Blood, Thos. Hickman, Capt. Thos. Cullen, Thos. Clancy, Geo. Clancy, Thos. Fanning, and Geo. M‘Namara. It would appear that Sir Geo. Hamilton, Bart., of Nenagh, became the owner of this mortgage of Dr. Arthur, for in 1670, we find the lands of Cratloemore and Portdrine assigned to him by the Commissioners, under the Act of Settlement, to hold them till the Earl of Thomond should discharge the mortgage for £1,050 due to Hamilton. (See Abstract of Grants under Act of Settlement, Dublin 1824.) Portdrine in 1663, was occupied by Dr. Teige O’Guillernan.\n\nAbout the year 1712, the Earl of Thomond demised, by lease for ever, the lands of Brickhill, Ballinfonta, &c. to Mr. Thomas Hickman, at the yearly rent of £125; Ballyluddane west, to Henry Ivers, Esq., yearly rent £20; Moyhill to the Executors of Charles M‘Donnell, Esq., yearly rent £99 13s. 9d.; and Ballulyddane east to Thomas White.\n\n39. Melick.— By an Inquisition, held in Limerick in 1615, it was shown that Fibagh was owned by Thomas MacNamara, Owen MacMahone, and others; that the lands of Knockalishee, Ballycannan, Cappantimore, and Glannagross, were the property of the Earl of Thomond, and of Donogh, son of Teige O’Brien of Glannagross; that Cratloemoyle was possessed by Daniel MacNamara Finn; Cratloekeel, by Cumara, son of Sheeda MacNamara, and James Rochfort; and that Castle Donnell, alias Cratloemore, was held by the heir of Edward White. [Linehan’s History of Limerick, p. 140.] Edward White was Clerk of the Council of Clare and Connaught. By Inquisition, taken at Ennis in 1641, it was found that Edward White, then late of Ballinderry, in the Co. of Roscommon, died at that place on the 14th of May, 1611, possessed of the castle, town, and lands of Cratloemore and Portdrine. In 1659, the following were “Titulados” of land in this parish:—Meelick, John Cooper, Wm. Neylan, and Teige O’Brien; Clooncosse, Edward and Andrew Rice. In 1663, the occupancy, in some respects, appears to have been altered, for we find, as made liable for the subsidy money of that year, Thomas Green, Esq., for Fyboe, and Dr. Teige O’Guillernane, and Sir Henry Ingoldsby for Cratloe.\n\n40. Cratloemoyle.— After John MacNamara had established his right to this townland and to Ballymorris, he and his descendants continued to reside in Cratloemoyle Castle, until about the year1770, when his property was sold, under a decree of the Court of Chancery, to George Quin, Esq. of Quinsborough, uncle of the first Earl of Dunraven, by whom it was bequeathed to his grandson, Lord George Quin, the late owner. The MacNamaras of Cratloemoyle were the main stem of the family of MacNamara Finn of Dangan and Knopoge. About the year 1610, when a new Patent was served out by the Earl of Thomond for the enormous grants of land already made to him, Daniel MacNamara Finn of Dangan, laid claim to Cratloemore, Portdrine, Brickhill, Moyhill, Kilfintinan, and many other denominations as the ancient inheritance of his tribe, but his demand was disregarded, and the ownership of the Earl confirmed. John MacNamara of Cratloemoyle, was Lieut.-Colonel in Lord Clare’s Regiment of Dragoons, and fought at the Boyne, Aughrim, and Galway. His estate was saved to him by the clause in the Treaty of Limerick which declared, that all who were within the walls of the city should be exempt from attainder and confiscation of property. He was King James’ High Sheriff of Clare in 1689, and was one of the members for the county deputed to serve in the Parliament called in Dublin by that monarch.\n\nIn the foregoing list of persons to whom various lands were granted, it will be observed, in the case of Teige MacMahon, that he was the real owner, but being a Catholic, he was obliged to employ his cousin Donogh O’Brien, of Leamaneh as his Trustee. The MacMahons of Clenagh were a branch of the family of Clonderalaw, and they continued to hold the Clenagh and other property till about the year 1800, when they became extinct in the male line.\n\n41. In Cuffe’s account of the siege of Ballyallia Castle, 1642, Peter Ware is described as owner of Ing.\n\n42. The following townlands in this parish were occupied as tenants, in 1663, by the undernamed:— Ing, Jonathan Barnes, Robert Nightingale; Breckinish, John Pawpin; Islandmacnevin, John MacNamara; Clenagh, Sir H. Ingoldsby; Carrow, Thos. Cullen, Esq.; Lismoyle, Hugh, son of John MacMahon; Urlanbeg, Capt, Wm. Duckett; and Carrowbane, Turlogh, son of Brian MacMahon.\n\nIn the reign of Queen Anne, the lands of Islandmacnevin were let in perpetuity, by the Earl of Thomond, to James FitzGerald, at the yearly rent of £22.\n\n43. Cloonmunnia.— John, son of Teige Reddan. This is the Teige Raddan whose tomb is in the old church of Kilfinaghta.\n\n44. Rossroe.— The MacNamaras were long the owners of Rossroe, and Fineen, who died in 1621, was, at that epoch, the proprietor. His son, Sheeda (Nydar), succeeded, and after paying off a mortgage held on the estate by Nicholas Stritch of Limerick, he sold it to Lord Clare. Under the Act of Settlement it was granted to that nobleman, and he mortgaged it in succession to George Mathews of Thomastown, to Col. Robert Maud of Dundrum, to John Clignett of the Oilmills Sixmilebridge, and of Clonmacken, near Limerick, a fleming, and finally to Lady Shelbourne. In 1680, Dineley found the castle and lands in possession of Mr. John Fennell, as tenant of Viscount Clare. See notes of Hon. Robert O’Brien in Dineley’s Journal.\n\nIn 1659, certain of the lands in this parish were occupied by the following as “Titulados”:— Kilkishen, by Peter Purefoy, Esq.; Rosroe, by Wm. Purefoy, Esq.; and Shandangan, by Pat Lysaght and Wm. Meagh.\n\nIn 1703, John Cusack, Esq., the purchaser of various lands from the Chichester House Commissioners is described as of Kilkishen. He had too daughters, from one of whom is descended the numerous and respectable family of Studdert, by her marriage with the Rev. Mr. Studdert, Rector of Rathkeale, county of Limerick.\n\n45. Dromoland.— Dromoland Castle became the place of residence of the family of Leamaneh in the time of Sir Donogh O’Brien, Bart. A beautiful monument, executed by Rubilliac, and dedicated to the memory of Sir Donogh, stands in the church of Kilnasoolagh.\n\n46. Rathfolan.— In 1580, the Castle of Rathfolan belonged to Donogh O’Brien of Leamaneh. It afterwards passed to a branch of the family of MacNamara of Ayle, who had other estates immediately adjoining, MacNamara was ejected by Cromwell, and his lands given, about the year 1656, to Henry Colpoys. At the Restoration, Colpoys was displaced, and Daniel MacNamara reinstated. He in his turn, was put out in 1690, on account of his adherence to King James II., and his estate was sold at Chichester House, in 1703, to Sir Donogh O’Brien, Bart., for £300 under the following circumstances: During his lifetime he had mortgaged it to Lord Clare for £300. At his death, his heirs were his daughter Slaney, married to Domnick Fanning of Limerick, and his three grand-daughters (children of Mary, married to Major MacNamara) viz.:— Mary, married to Daniel O’Brien, gent., Honora, married to Francis Grady, gent., and Margaret, married to Cornelius Brody, gent. Lord Clare’s mortgage, by his attainder, became vested in the Chichester House Commissioners, and in April 1703, they handed over the property to Sir Donogh, as Trustee for the co-heiresses, he paying them the sum of £300. The lands have since remained in the possession of Sir Donogh’s descendants, and it is believed that, owing to the action of the penal laws the co-heiresses never made any attempt to pay off the mortgage, thus tacitly authorizing Sir Donogh to become the absolute owner of the inheritance.
