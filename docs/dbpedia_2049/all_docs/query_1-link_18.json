        "text": "The CIA has not released the names of terrorism suspects it held in secret detention with the exception of 14 who were transferred to Guantanamo Bay, in September 2006. Human rights groups have tried to track those identities using publicly available information about high-profile captures, eyewitness accounts from former detainees and family inquiries. In June 2007, six human rights groups released the names of nearly three dozen apparent CIA prisoners (PDF) whose fates remained unknown. We've updated that list based on the most current information available to Human Rights Watch. (For more details, also see our accompanying story.)\n\nWe asked the CIA whether any of the people on the list were in CIA custody, whether any of them were among those detainees whom the CIA transferred to other countries for prosecution or detention, as former President Bush said had been done when he publicly acknowledged the program in September 2006, and whether the CIA is aware of and can disclose the current locations of any of these people.\n\nCIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano sent the following response: \"The agency has not, as a rule, commented on these kinds of lists, which are typically flawed.\" We invited him to clarify those flaws but have not yet heard back.\n\n1. Hassan Ghul, a Pakistani citizen who was detained in Iraq in 2004. As we wrote last week, one of the recently released memos revealed Ghul had been in CIA custody.
