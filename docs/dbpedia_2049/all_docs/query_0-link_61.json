        "text": "\"So that's why you inquired about my inspiration. You believe I was influenced by the Order of Assassins? Amateurs who prioritize faith above all else? My League is far superior. It's an affront to suggest that I drew inspiration from such a subpar and unprofessional religious cult\" Ra's retorted, clearly offended by Raiden's insinuations.\n\nRa's Al Ghul responded, \"You? I'll concede that you are an excellent user of stealth techniques, but you seem to underestimate the danger you're in. You are surrounded by over forty of my elite, outnumbered and outmatched. What do you hope to achieve, young one? Surrender peacefully, and I'll spare your friends over there. They were willing to fight to the death for you. Why not spare them such a fate and end this peacefully?\" Ra's Al Ghul's patience was wearing thin with Raiden's theatrics, and he was ready to conclude this, whether by force or consent.\n\n\"Mr. Ra's Al Ghul, it seems that you are genuinely uninteresting. You've made numerous mistakes today. Perhaps you are not as great as your reputation suggests. You've insulted my Order, made baseless assumptions about my skills, and if you wish to discuss numbers, allow me to introduce you to the might of the Hashasheen,\" Raiden stated confidently.\n\nMuch to the astonishment of everyone present, whether they belonged to the team or the League of Shadows, a sudden emergence of Assassins, numbering one, two, three, and eventually four, five, twenty, and even forty, overwhelmed the scene. They all donned identical white masks and had matching complexions, but it was vital to understand that these were not clones. Each possessed unique abilities, skills, and advantages. Without warning, they appeared behind every member of the League of Shadows, with the most formidable positioned directly behind Ra's Al Ghul.\n\nA massive Assassin delivered a powerful blow to Ra's Al Ghul from behind, and two more assailants swiftly emerged from the left and right. To Ra's credit, he managed to deflect three of the attacks, but it was a futile effort. Two others closed in, with one delivering a crushing punch to his rib-cage, shattering it, and the other aiming a slicing attack at his chest. Although he narrowly evaded the latter because the other attac propelled him backwards to the right, it cost him the use of his arm, which, while not completely severed, was rendered useless.\n\nWally, took advantage of the momentarily distracted Black Spider, who was fending off four Assassins Assassins, and delivered a series of super-fast, powerful punches. some from the left, some from the right, some from the back, his speed, and the distraction that was given to him by the assassins, allowed him to swiftly end the battle, when done He quipped, \"That's what you get for making me look bad in front of my girl!\"\n\nAided by Megan and three Assassins, Artemis lunged toward Talia, who attempted to escape by tossing a smoke grenade on the ground. one of the Assassins retorted, \"Foolishness! You think you can hide in the dark? In smoke? We see it all; we are the darkness!\" A purple-haired Assassin delivered a powerful kick to Talia's face, sending her flying into a wall. As she attempted to evade another attack, three arrows pinned her to the wall from her shirt. She quickly discarded her shirt to escape the second assault, but then Megan used her telekinesis to immobilize her completly, as the purple haired Assassin jumped to kick her to the face.\n\n\"Father! Help!\" To her shock, her father was locked in combat with five Assassins, while Aqualad and Rocket provided support and protection. no matter what he would do, landing an attack on one, the others strike, forcing him back, and with one of his hands useless, Ra's was trying to come up with an escape route\n\n\"Father! Take down the leader; that might be our way to victory!\" Hearing his daughter's plea, Ra's al Ghul momentarily abandoned his own defense and focused all his strength on the leader. he knew that the moment he attacked, Rocket would defend him, so instead, he fainted an Attack on an assassisn, then risking injury, turnued to Aqualad, and threw few hidden blades, distracting rocket to protect him, with this he found the opening to attack the original assassin, Despite further injury to his already weakened body, he delivered the decisive blow, stabbing the main Assassin in the chest.\n\n\"One down... Seventy-nine to go.\" Ra's eyes widened as he realized the gravity of those words, but before he could express his shock he was stabbed in the back and another colossal assassin, punched him in the face, a punch so powerful it almost knocked him out, the giant was twice his size, so it wasn't all shocking that the punch sent him hurtling to the farthest reaches of the room.\n\nIn perfect unison, all the Assassins spoke simultaneously, \"While we may appear different, behave differently, and sound distinct, do not be mistaken. We are one, unified as Raiden Kagawa, as Hassan I. Sabbah. We exist as a collective, and the collective is an entity in itself. one of us goes down, another arises\"\n\njust as he said that, Another Assassin emerged from the shadows, that was the true power of the Noble phantasm [Zabaniya: Delusional Illusion] the Assassin, Named Hunderd Faces Hassan, was a man with multiple personality disorder, he used that to create real illusions of himself, each with their own individual powers and personalities, he could only summon eighty at one time, but they were a hundred, as for The Hassan himself, even he doesn't know which personality is the original\n\nWith all the other members of the League of Shadows incapacitated, Ra's gazed in shock as his elite assassins were defeated by a young individual in less than two to three minutes. His entire League of Shadows was now outnumbered and outclassed. He had been outwitted in his own domain.\n\n\"Raiden, you ignored my orders. It's important to exercise judgment and question me, but when you came here, you should have coordinated with us. You also cut off communication. From now on, even if you decide to go rogue, it's crucial to inform us of your next move, at least that way I won't have to worry about the enemy capturing you\" Aqualad explained in a stern voice. Kaldur wasn't angry that Raiden had ignored his orders, but he was concerned about Raiden as he was the target of today's attack. The responsibilities of a leader were a heavy burden on Kadlur, and he couldn't bear the thought of losing a team member.\n\n\"Yeah, that was super cool! There were like fifty of you out there fighting with us. The League of Shadows couldn't even figure out what happened to them! but let's be honest here, I played a major role too\" Wally added."
