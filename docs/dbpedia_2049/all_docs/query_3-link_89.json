Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\n\nBut the report, which the committee will decide whether to approve Thursday, Dec. 13, remains classified, with little likelihood that any of it will be public for months.\n\nIt has already become fodder for a partisan fight, with Republicans denouncing it as flawed and incomplete.\n\nNearly a decade after the CIA is last known to have waterboarded a suspect, the U.S. argument over torture remains unresolved and has lost little of its emotional potency, whether the spark is a blockbuster movie or a Senate report.\n\nAccording to intelligence officials and the incomplete public record, detainees who endured varying degrees of physical force did tell their interrogators some truths, as well as half-truths and outright lies.\n\nWhat remains unprovable is whether — as FBI agents with long experience questioning terrorists have argued — the same or better information might have been obtained without taking the morally and politically treacherous path the CIA chose.\n\nMark Boal, the screenwriter of “Zero Dark Thirty,” said Wednesday that the movie was no documentary, though it is based on extensive research.\n\n“I’m trying to compress a program that lasted for years into a few short scenes,” he said. The film, he said, attempts “to reflect a very complex debate about torture that is still going on” and shows brutal treatment producing both true and false information.\n\nJameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, who saw the film Tuesday, said he was concerned that because the film opens with torture and ends with the killing of bin Laden, “it may leave a hazy impression that it was cause and effect.”\n\nBut he added: “I don’t think it makes a strong case for or against torture. It shows the big breaks came from good, old-fashioned intelligence work.”\n\nA major difficulty in judging just how faithful “Zero Dark Thirty” is to the facts is that many facts remain hidden from the public.\n\nThe extended interrogation scene shows a terrorist identified as Ammar, whom Boal describes as a composite character, being waterboarded, deprived of sleep, chained to the ceiling and forced into a small box. But he delivers his important nugget of information — that bin Laden used a courier known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti — only later, over a relaxed meal of hummus, after CIA officers trick him into believing that he has already spoken freely during torture sessions.\n\nAnother character, loosely based on a militant named Hassan Ghul, does speak candidly after saying he had been tortured by a Middle Eastern spy service and “I don’t want to be tortured again.”\n\nBut in another scene, an al-Qaida member called Abu Faraj al-Libi is shown — accurately, intelligence officials say — lying about the courier despite the brutal treatment he has experienced.\n\nHowever, most of the movie, which is directed by Kathryn Bigelow and opens in January, portrays years of dogged intelligence sleuthing with no connection to torture. In the film, as in reality, the real breakthrough comes when the CIA learns the true name of the courier from a foreign intelligence service.\n\n“Zero Dark Thirty” portrays the name as having been overlooked for years in U.S. files; an intelligence official Wednesday declined to say whether that is accurate.\n\nThe portrayal of torture in television shows such as “24” — which makes no pretense of reflecting real events — may already have contributed to a notable shift in U.S. public opinion toward the idea that brutal interrogations are necessary and effective, said Amy Zegart, who studies intelligence at Stanford University.\n\nShe commissioned a poll in August that showed a switch since 2005 in views on the torture of terrorists who might know about new plots. There was a decline, for instance, in disapproval of waterboarding to 55 percent from 82 percent, and of chaining naked prisoners in uncomfortable positions in the cold to 51 percent from 79 percent.\n\nThe more spy shows people have watched, she said, the more enthusiastic they are about torture.\n\n“I think the evidence is that television is shifting views,” said Zegart. “Entertainment has an alarming impact.”\n\nOriginally Published: December 11, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
