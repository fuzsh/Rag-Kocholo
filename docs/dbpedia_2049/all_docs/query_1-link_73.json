        "text": "“Obama the Cowboy,” is a great article (Adam Brodsky, PostOpinion, May 9).\n\nFor once, I’m OK with this administration’s “do as I say, not as I do” policy.\n\nPete Ryan\n\nWarwick\n\n***\n\nPlease do not use the word cowboy to define President Obama.\n\nA cowboy was a man who rode for the brand, but Obama is more concerned about himself and how he appears to the world community.\n\nI am convinced that the only reason that Obama signed off on the raid is because he was afraid it would become public knowledge that he knew bin Laden’s whereabouts.\n\nJohn McAlexander\n\nRockwall, Texas\n\n***\n\nI love Brodsky’s article. It is fun and funny, except when he writes, “Consider Dubya’s biggest ‘cowboy’ sin: failing to get permission from allies like France and Germany to invade Iraq. Hmm . . . ”\n\nI know that Brodsky is being sarcastic, because those countries had oil deals with Saddam Hussein and it was against their best interests.\n\nBut a lot of people don’t know or wouldn’t remember that since the liberal media belittled that reality.\n\nNora Halpert\n\nMiami Beach, Fla.\n\n***\n\nI’m not sure if Brodsky wrote this article to create a stir or draw attention to his editorial career, but I find it hard to believe that he actually believes what he wrote.\n\nI’m a registered Republican and, politics aside, believe that Obama did what he had to do to get bin Laden.\n\nSo why is Brodsky trying to argue that bin Laden wasn’t personally armed and, therefore, America was not on the self-defense?\n\nAre we only defending ourselves during the exact moment when al Qaeda drives planes into our buildings?\n\nJoshua Michael\n\nManalapan, NJ\n\n***\n\nBrodsky sounds like a playground loser with his “left”-handed compliments.\n\nFace it, George W. Bush misfired, and Obama hit the bulls-eye. Get over it.\n\nLyle Mayer\n\nManhattan\n\n***\n\nObama complained about torture, not tough interrogation, and professionals doubt torture’s efficacy, saying that answers will be obtained but they may be false.\n\nWaterboarding Khalid Sheik Mohammed didn’t lead to bin Laden, but the interrogation of Hassan Ghul, without waterboarding, uncovered the courier’s name.\n\nAnd, while the courier was known to the CIA, it did not know of his value.\n\nAs for Bush, his cowboy act wasn’t his failure to get our allies’ OK for the Iraq invasion, it was the invasion on false information.\n\nObama’s incursion was limited and based on real facts.\n\nGet the difference, Brodsky?\n\nSteven Chinn\n\nManhattan\n\n***\n\nObama, we are told, is the coolest intelligence on the block — a man of calm demeanor and reasoned judgment when compared with his predecessor.\n\nBut, it turns out that Obama utilized the fruits of the Bush presidency, namely, information gleaned from the exact enhanced interrogation techniques he criticized in his quest for the White House.\n\nObama has drunk from the poisoned Bush well and not only lived but actually thrived.\n\nPaul Bloustein\n\nCincinnati\n\n***\n\nGreat piece, Brodsky!\n\nJed Duncan\n\nNew Canaan, Conn."
