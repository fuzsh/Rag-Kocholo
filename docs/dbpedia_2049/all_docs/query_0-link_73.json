        "text": "No spoilers here… however, the iconic villain has been the centre of major speculation off late. Here’s why...\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThanks to the recently released comic book, ‘Batman #123: The Shadow War’, the buzz around the mystery of who killed Ra’s al Ghul just got louder in the superfan circles. ‘The Shadow War’ focuses on the overarching mystery of Ra’s al Ghul’s killer, and as shown, Batman, Deathstroke, and Robin, have all been stumped so far. That said, a delicious hint has been provided, but first...\n\nWho is Ra’s al Ghul?\n\nThe DC Comics’ character — created by Julius Schwartz, Dennis O’Neil, and Neal Adams in June 1971’s ‘Batman #232: Daughter of the Demon’ — is one the greatest villains in the Batman universe. Ghul, is a twisted mentor of Batman, who sees the latter as his heir apparent.\n\nWhy is he special?\n\nAccording to the DC Universe, Ghul has lived for over 600 years (thanks to something mysterious called Lazarus Pits) in various incarnations. From wandering the Arabian deserts as a nomad, to becoming the head of the League of Assassins — and the League of Shadows in some versions — Ghul is adept at manipulating the world and often makes misguided attempts to save it. For example, he foresaw a future in which Bruce Wayne became a violent vigilante to protect his home of Gotham City, and drove himself to make that future a reality. His name is said to translate to ‘Demon's Head’.\n\nWhen did he die?\n\nRa's Al Ghul was shown to have been assassinated in the crossover ‘Shadow War: Alpha #1’. Ironically, the iconic villain is said to have died at a time when he was undergoing a dramatic shift in character. Reaching the end of his long, unnatural life, he had reconnected with both his daughter and grandson, and was planning on changing the way he tried to “save” the world."
