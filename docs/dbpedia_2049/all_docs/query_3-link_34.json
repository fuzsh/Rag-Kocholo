        "text": "As an Arabic-speaking FBI agent, Soufan was at the center of several Al Qaeda investigations before and after 9/11. He tells FRONTLINE that critical CIA intelligence about Al Qaeda was not communicated to the FBI before 9/11, and had that information been shared, “The world would be very different today.” After 9/11, Soufan conducted interrogations of key Al Qaeda figures, including Abu Zubaydah. Soufan says he gained actionable intelligence while interrogating Zubaydah, but the information dried up after the detainee became the test case for new, harsher methods of interrogation that would come to be known as “enhanced interrogation techniques.” He argues the techniques have not worked, and in one case, even resulted in faulty intelligence that helped build the case to go to war in Iraq. This is the edited transcript of an interview conducted on Aug. 30, 2011.\n\nThe Black Banners. Why did you decide to write this book?\n\nI decided to share the experiences that I went through in the war against Al Qaeda.\n\nThere is part of this story that hasn’t been told, and it is the involvement also of the law enforcement entities of the United States with the intelligence entities [and] with the people in the field and how they worked together in predicting the threat of Al Qaeda really early on and in fighting Al Qaeda when bin Laden was in Sudan, after the East Africa embassy bombing, after bin Laden went to Afghanistan, with the U.S.S. Cole.\n\nUnfortunately, 10 years after 9/11, Al Qaeda is this ghost that people don’t know, and people usually fear the unknown. So I hope that [the] book, 10 years after 9/11, can be a small little piece of the history of what happened in the fight against Al Qaeda from 1997 until today.\n\n1997 is —\n\n“They hit the glass ceiling with waterboarding. So what do you do? You do it again and again and again: with Abu Zubaydah, 83 times; with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, 183 times. When you repeat a tactic on an individual 183 times, do you think the technique is working? Because if it’s working, you don’t need to do it 183 times. This is just logic.”\n\nWhen I joined the bureau. So firsthand experience. Now, in the book, I also talk about the actions of so many people in the FBI, the CIA, the other law enforcement and intelligence agencies that have been fighting with the threat way longer than I joined the FBI. And I hope that with this book, 10 years after 9/11, people can get some answers, both to what we did right, what we did wrong and what really happened on that September day 10 years ago.\n\nYou wanted people to understand the nature of the enemy. It’s a bit surprising when you think about it, that after 10 years, we still don’t have a grasp on the nature of the enemy we’ve been fighting.\n\nAbsolutely. And we’re really behind the eight ball on this. We think they are Muslims, so we summarize it: Everyone who’s a Muslim must be Al Qaeda. We think they are jihadi, so the term “jihad” means Sept. 11, means the U.S.S. Cole or means the East Africa embassy bombing. Things are more complicated than this. Al Qaeda killed way more Muslims, for example, than they killed Americans. They have been attacking places all over the world, from Bali, Madrid, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan, bombing mosques, killing anyone who opposed them.\n\nSo this is a terrorist organization. This is an evil organization that has no religion whatsoever.\n\nAnd I talk in the book about some of the leaders of Al Qaeda, or the midlevel managers, the operatives, people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, [considered the mastermind of 9/11]; people like Mohammed Atta, who was the leader of the 9/11 attack; people like Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, [then-Al Qaeda’s chief of military operations]. And the way they were living does not live up to the Islamic preaching that they claim they believe in. …\n\nWhy is it that Americans have such a hard time understanding the nature of Al Qaeda?\n\nI think simply it wasn’t explained. It’s as simple as that. It wasn’t properly explained. It wasn’t put in a context.\n\nWe were so busy with 9/11 and understanding what happened in our soul in 9/11, and then we were so busy fighting wars overseas. And people were just told about threats. People were told something, somewhere is going to happen — we don’t know when; we don’t know where.\n\nSo people lived in fear, and usually people fear the unknown. And nobody tried to basically put that threat in an appropriate context.\n\nWhat strikes me about the book is how you get to know these guys through these various interrogations as ordinary guys with problems with money, with their wives, with their children, with internal matters within Al Qaeda. There’s a kind of portrait here that brings you to understand how ordinary their day-to-day concerns are.\n\nSure, if you look at each one of the individuals that we spoke about in the group and how we called them in the first place and then how we interviewed them, interrogated them and got their information from them, it’s exactly what you said.\n\nThese people all have issues, sometimes with their families, sometimes inside the group itself. The Qaeda, for example, as an organization is a terrorist organization. They want to unify the Islamic ummah [community]. This is at least one of their claims: Make the whole world an Islamic ummah.\n\nHowever, there’s deep divisions inside the group, between people from the Arabian Peninsula and people who are Egyptians, and they really hate each other. And we use sometimes these kind of divisions to our advantage in the interviews [with] these guys.\n\nThey argue about promotions; they argue about money.\n\nThey argue about who’s getting paid more than who, why you’re paying the Egyptians more than you pay the Sudanese or more than you pay the Yemenis. They argue about who’s going to be the leader. Why I am from Saudi Arabia and there is an Egyptian leading me? …\n\nThey argue about ideological reasons when they start discussing religion, trying to justify a lot of evil work that they do and see it through a religious prism.\n\nSo they’re not unified in any way, shape or form. However, the hatred to the United States, the hatred to the West is kind of unifying them in putting people together to conduct terrorist attacks.\n\nYou talk about your approach to interrogation. It has to do with the fact that these people are human beings with problems. Your philosophy of interrogation is that you have to adjust a different approach to each one of these people. Talk a little bit about how you solve the art of interrogation.\n\nThere’s no cookie-cutter approach for interrogation. What works on Mr. X will never work on Mr. Y, so you have to be very flexible.\n\nThe very first thing you need is basically knowledge. You need to know the group first and how the group is divided and how the group is structured, and use your knowledge to your advantage in the interrogation. And the interrogation became like a chess game or a poker mental game with the person that you’re interviewing or the person that you’re interrogating.\n\nAlso, in [sic] the same time, you have to try to learn as much as you can about the individual that you’re interviewing — … for example, why do you think he joined the group? Who are his friends in the group? Where does he fit in the different cliques that exist in the group? — and utilize a lot of these things to your advantage in conducting the interview.\n\nYou said your major weapon is information.\n\nAbsolutely. And you need information to get information.\n\nThis doesn’t seem surprising. On the other hand, you were around a lot of people who took different approaches to this.\n\nAbsolutely. And there’s different approaches. Every individual has their own style that works for them, and that creates that appropriate chemistry with the person that you’re trying to interrogate.\n\nI saw people, for example, who are older than me, so their technique was different from me. But it works for them. They [re]presented a father figure in the interrogation for that specific detainee. I saw some other people who used the fact that, “Look, you think you’re a soldier; I am a soldier. Let’s talk from one soldier to another, regardless of our ideology.” That works for them.\n\nEveryone has their own strengths and their own weaknesses, and they develop their own interrogation style based on that. And that’s why it’s very interesting.\n\nAnd these things we didn’t invent. These things have been used in law enforcement for many, many, many years.\n\nYou compare interrogating somebody [to] dating.\n\nSometimes it is, because it’s about building a rapport with an individual. It’s about building the chemistry. It’s about building a trust, a little bit, because if he’s going to tell you something, he needs to have some sense of trust about you.\n\nWhy did you join the FBI in the first place?\n\nThat’s the last thing I wanted to do. I never thought [about] a career in law enforcement or in intelligence or in counterterrorism. For me, [it] was like somebody telling me to join the circus or telling me to be a Formula 1 driver.\n\nI think somebody suggested it in college. People thought that it can never happen. So I said, hey, you know, I’ll apply and see what happens. And about two years later, finally, I get a letter offering me a job as a special agent.\n\nA fraternity brother had made a bet that you —\n\nIt’s actually a bunch of them. It became a joke, like: “Yeah, right, you’re going to be in the FBI. They will probably send you back the application.”\n\nBut you at the same time had come from the Middle East and were paying attention to what was developing as a hobby, in a sense.\n\nYes, I was always interested. My major in college was political science. I have two majors in undergrad, one political science and one international studies. And I was always interested in the non-state actors and their effect on regional and global security — non-state actors meaning mostly terrorist groups. And I was interested in that guy, Osama bin Laden, because in 1996, he did this declaration of jihad that was widely distributed in the Middle East and published in different newspapers. And his rhetoric was really kind of dangerous. And I felt that a lot of people will basically listen to what he was saying, especially from Saudi Arabia, from the Arab Afghan, as they used to call them at the time.\n\nEvery now and then, if I read something in the Arabic press, in Al Hayat or Asharq Al-Awsat, they always mentioned bin Laden. I used to be interested in reading what he said.\n\nHe made these declarations in 1996. How many people were really paying attention to it?\n\nI think in the government, people were paying attention in the CIA and the FBI. And I didn’t know that until I came to the bureau. And I actually spoke with someone in the FBI about this guy bin Laden, and they’re like, “Yeah, yeah, we have actually people working [on] him.”\n\nAnd I met some of the people who were focusing on bin Laden, but it was kind of like a bureaucratic focus. I don’t think it came to a policy focus in 1996 or 1997, or even after the East Africa embassy in 1998.\n\nSo you get a letter from the FBI saying, “Come on in for an interview.”\n\nNo, it’s actually, that letter was offering me a job. I went through all the interviews in about two years — two years of testings, interviews, polygraph, everything you can imagine. And they don’t tell you anything. You wait. And I wasn’t even that focused on it. I was getting ready to do my Ph.D. at the time, also in the same topic, international relations. And I wanted my focus in my Ph.D. to be on non-state actors.\n\nAnd I received a letter, I think it was on a Tuesday, and they told me to report to Quantico on a Sunday. I remember it was July 6.\n\nThat’s their training facility.\n\nYes, in Quantico, Va. And it was difficult to make a decision. Life of academia — that’s what I wanted to do — or go into the FBI?\n\nAnd at that time, I was going to the U.K. to do my Ph.D. The average age of my major in Ph.D. at the time was 36 years old; I was 25. So I thought, you know what? I can go for 10 years in the FBI and then maybe I can do my Ph.D. after that. I’m still too young for the Ph.D. And I decided to join the bureau, to give it a try.\n\nYou joined the bureau, and then you did what exactly? You had conversations about your interest in bin Laden?\n\nRight. I was appointed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force [JTTF] by John O’Neill at the time.\n\nCan you talk about your first meeting with John O’Neill and how that went and what your impressions were?\n\nYes. I was scared. I mean, this is your SAC, special agent in charge, who ran the national security division in the New York office, which is, I think, the largest national security division in the bureau.\n\nAnd I was taken to his office by Pat D’Amuro, who was the assistant special agent in charge, and he was heading the Joint Terrorism Task Force at the time. Under Pat, the task force was probably about 30, 35 different organizations. We’re talking early on in the ’90s.\n\nAnd when I went to see John, it was kind of, wow, this guy’s a legend; he’s known. So me, as a new agent who just came to the office, was very intimidated.\n\nHow did it go?\n\nI think it went good, from what I remember.\n\nI think I was very nervous to remember a lot of things that happened. I remember he has a beautiful view from his office. You can see all the way to the Empire State Building. And Pat introduced me to him, and John basically just talked about the importance of the work in terrorism, just [a] very short meeting. It was like, “Do you want to come to the task force?” I said yes. We joined the task force.\n\nWhat was your assignment?\n\nMy assignment was a squad called I-40, and it handled at the time Palestinian terrorist groups and Iraqi FCI, foreign counterintelligence. …\n\nI wanted to go to that squad because I knew a lot of people from the squad. Also [at] the same time, the supervisor of the squad at the time, Tommy Donlon, was one of the case agents on the first World Trade Center bombing. …\n\nThen when do you begin to focus on Al Qaeda?\n\nWhen I was on I-40, I wrote a paper, and I gave it to my supervisor, and that paper ended up with John O’Neill. It was about bin Laden and about the threat that bin Laden will cause for the United States.\n\nWhat prompted you to write that paper?\n\nI think the very first paper was prompted by the 1998 fatwa, I believe, to kill Americans.\n\nThis is before the East African —\n\nThis is before the East Africa embassy bombing. This is around February of 1998. And at the time, I started focusing more and more [on] what was a hobby before.\n\n[Now] it’s kind of like part of my job. And in a way, I [began] working with two squads, I-40 and I-49, that was handling at the time [Egyptian Islamic] Jihad, EIJ, Al Qaeda and the World Trade Center bombing, Ramzi Yousef, all these cases.\n\nAnd so this was a very important memo. This caught John’s attention.\n\nYes, it caught his attention. I think he distributed it to all the supervisors at the time, and he wrote “Great job,” or something like that.\n\nAnd I think John then maybe thought that I was an individual that not only speaks Arabic, but I have genuine interest in stuff that he’s interested in. And he started kind of like asking me to go out with him sometimes for dinner or for a drink, and we’d discuss issues about terrorism, about the Middle East.\n\nI believe he was kind of testing me at the time and seeing if I really know my stuff, if I’m worth his time.\n\nAnd?\n\nI hope that I was. He took care of me. He took me under his wing, and I learned a lot from him. Nobody knows how to work terrorism cases [better] than John. I mean, he was really a very demanding boss, but in the same time, very knowledgeable boss.\n\n… He has a lot of knowledge about the group, about the Arab Afghan. Unfortunately, at the time, not a lot of people were listening.\n\nWhy not?\n\nI don’t know. That’s politics, I guess. Who wants a problem? The easiest thing to handle a problem is put your [head] in the sand, sometimes.\n\nThey were focused on state actors, Saddam [Hussein]?\n\nThey were focused on a lot of things. They were focused on definitely state actors. There was a lot of problems in the Middle East. There was a lot of issues in the Middle East. Who wanted to put another problem on their table?\n\nBut there are other people who were very focused on that, especially the Southern District. And at the time, terrorism and organized crime was led by Pat Fitzgerald, [then- assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York].\n\nWhat you haven’t mentioned is that there had been an attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 that had gotten people’s attention, and you began to draw the lines between the group that did that attack and Al Qaeda.\n\nWe began to basically focus on the ideology that was behind the attack on the World Trade Center, the ideology and the background of some of the people who were involved in the World Trade Center attack and between what bin Laden was talking about.\n\nFor example, in the fatwa of 1998, he mentioned the “blind sheik,” Omar Abdel Rahman, [who was investigated for the attack on the World Trade Center in 1993]. So it does not mean that bin Laden was supporting Omar Abdel Rahman, but it is very difficult not to start looking at the ideology that bin Laden represented, at the history of that ideology that bin Laden represented, and the ideology and the history of the ideology that the blind sheik represented.\n\nSo there were ideological links.\n\nThere were ideological and historical ones. Afghanistan, for example — the Arab mujahideen against the Soviets; Abdullah Azzam, [a teacher and mentor of Osama bin Laden]. There’s a lot of links between these two entities.\n\nTell me about John himself. What kind of man was he?\n\nHe was a great boss, but he was a very, very demanding boss. And he knew the threat. He understood it, not superficially, but he knew the details of it. Also, in the same time, he’s a guy that he expects you, if you work for him, to give it 110 percent. Forget about having days off. Forget about nights and evenings for your family. That doesn’t work like this with John. If he’s working, you’re working. …\n\nJohn O’Neill also rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.\n\nWell, when you are demanding like this, that’s because you have different kind of personality. And people who don’t like his attitude or even sometimes his work ethics, he did not give them the time of the day. And people like this definitely were upset with John.\n\nAnd also, John’s personal life in an organization like the FBI can rub people the wrong way. So it wasn’t [so much] professional as it was also personal.\n\nHis flamboyance? What do you mean when you say his personal life?\n\nHis flamboyance, the stuff that has been published and talked about his marriage and all these kind of things. So some people were very judgmental. I never saw any of these things affecting John’s judgment in any way, shape or form, and I was honored to work and to learn from somebody like John. …\n\nThere’s long been tension between the FBI and the CIA.\n\nWhen I joined the bureau, I joined under Director [Louis] Freeh, and in my generation, the people who came during that time period, we were taught that we all work together. Actually, my very first partner in the JTTF, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, was a CIA officer.\n\nSo I worked a lot with the agency before 9/11 and after 9/11 in joint operations. So I saw sometimes tension, absolutely. But also at the time, it wasn’t different than any tension that existed with any of the other entities that we were working with at the time. So they were very helpful overseas; we were very helpful in the U.S.\n\nBut there’s an institutional rivalry.\n\nThere is an institution[al rivalry], absolutely.\n\nMany of the people listening to this may not fully understand. What is the role of the FBI versus the CIA? Both gather intelligence. What is the difference, and what leads to the sort of institutional tension?\n\nWell, the CIA is an intelligence agency. Their jurisdiction is mostly overseas. Their focus is to collect intelligence overseas. As an intelligence agency, they operate in the dark. And the reason they are successful is because they operate in the dark.\n\nIn the FBI, we are an intelligence agency, too, one of the intelligence agencies in the United States. We have the primacy over, for example, foreign counterintelligence work. But also, in the same time, we’re a law enforcement entity, and we don’t operate in the dark like the agency.\n\nIn other words, undercover.\n\nWe do a lot of undercover, but we’re not the dark side. Everything that we do, there’s a possibility that one day [it] is going to end up in court. So that by itself creates some kind of institutional culture. …\n\nBut when we start talking about terrorism, for example — and President Reagan put the FBI and the Department of Justice as the lead agency — actually, terrorism is a crime under U.S. Code 18, and then also you’re working with the CIA. Then you have the institutional culture clashing. When you’re talking about things that have some kind of U.S. dimension, you’re going to have the institutional culture clashing.\n\nAnd it’s not that the FBI is wrong and the CIA is right, or the CIA is wrong and the FBI is right. This is not the issue. This is basically, there is two different missions, and they are trying to work together.\n\nAnd I think a lot of good things happened under Director Freeh when the FBI start opening the legat [or legal attaché] offices overseas and having their own relationships with the law enforcement and intelligence entities in the different countries and worked with the CIA on that. It created additional tension, because now the CIA viewed the FBI being their on own turf, but also that tension exists when the CIA is trying to do something domestically and the FBI viewed the agency as they are on their own turf.\n\nAnd the same thing happens with Director [Robert] Mueller. He worked hard in having a better working relationship among the intelligence agencies and the FBI, especially the CIA. This is a really hard thing to do because of the mentality, because of the institutional culture of each agency. And it does not mean that one agency is right and one agency is wrong. …\n\nLet’s jump to the first incidents of terrorism that happens on your watch. Basically that’s August of 1998.\n\nYep, the East Africa embassy bombing.\n\nI learned about it by getting a phone call from my supervisor at the time, and I came to the office. I was convinced from the very beginning that it was Al Qaeda who was behind the attack. And many people in the JTTF — Pat D’Amuro, John O’Neill — also were convinced that Al Qaeda was behind the attack.\n\nI was taken to the command post by my supervisor at the time, Tom Donlon, and Pat D’Amuro and John O’Neill were both there, and I had to explain to John and to Pat why do I believe Al Qaeda was behind it. And I think John and Pat, both of them agreed with the assumption.\n\nWhy did you think Al Qaeda was behind it?\n\nMany reasons. First of all, you have the fatwa of 1998. Then you have the interview with John Miller [of] ABC News, which was kind of like a final threat. And you work in Al Qaeda, and you’re seeing what’s going on. You’re looking into the intelligence; you’re looking into the threat; you’re looking into bin Laden’s giving final warning in June of 1998.\n\nRemember, the New York office, the JTTF, the Southern District of New York indicted Osama bin Laden in June of 1998. Bin Laden and Al Qaeda were indicted before the East Africa embassy bombing, which indicated that we were really following that threat.\n\nWhat were they indicted for?\n\nTerrorism. So we were focused on that, and we knew that something is going to happen.\n\nAnd at the time, there was some kind of discussions in Washington, in headquarters, if Al Qaeda was behind [this] or some other terrorists, because if Al Qaeda’s behind it, then the investigators will go all from the New York office, because Al Qaeda’s office of origin, if you want to call it, is New York. If it’s another terrorist group, then the Washington Field Office of the FBI, WFO, will work the case.\n\nSo there was a debate at the time, the very first day, who was going to go to East Africa, to Nairobi, [Kenya], and to Dar es Salaam, [Tunisia], and work this investigation.\n\nSo they decided by sending two contingencies.\n\n[Wby?]\n\nWell, because they didn’t know. And we went there because of what we believed and because of what we wrote at the time, myself and other agents who were working on the JTTF, and especially from I-49, about why we believe Al Qaeda was behind the East Africa embassy bombing.\n\nAnd later on, evidence, the investigation on the ground, both in Dar es Salaam and in Nairobi showed that Al Qaeda was behind it. So the contingency from the Washington field office left and the New York agents continued to stay and finish the investigation. …\n\nSo you don’t go over to Africa, but you worked that case from —\n\nI continued to work the case from here, because John said there was a lot of agents on the ground, but he needs me to be with him. So I stayed with him. And then I ended up going to different places, following leads from the East Africa embassy bombing that were generating.\n\nI ended up, for example, in the U.K., working with Scotland Yard, SY13 at the time when Operation Challenge ended up in different areas, like in Albania and Italy, basically following up the leads.\n\nThat eventually gave us the whole kind of link between Al Qaeda and between Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) and with what happened in East Africa, both in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.\n\nSo your learning curve at this point is very steep. You’re learning a lot about Al Qaeda. You’re talking to people like [bin Laden aide Jamal Ahmed] al-Fadl.\n\nAbsolutely. I’m talking to a lot of people, but also at the same time I’m reading a lot. I mean, Operation Challenge was, for me, probably the best thing that ever happened to me, even though I was annoyed when I got the case because I had boxes and boxes that included thousands of pieces, literally thousands of pieces of documents, and I had to read it. We cannot wait for all the things to be translated and given to us; we were running against time. And I had to figure out a system, how can I know what’s in these boxes, just in case we needed something.\n\nAnd that probably was the best thing that ever happened to me. Sometimes I really didn’t go to my apartment. I just stayed in the office. That helped me tremendously — reading letters between people, not terrorist-connected, like sometimes they were talking about their family with each other, Egyptian Islamic Jihad members, for example, or Al Qaeda; fights inside the Egyptian Islamic Jihad about joining Al Qaeda or not joining Al Qaeda; memos; fatwas; ideology, ideological debates; internal hearings in the groups.\n\nIt made me basically live with them by learning and by reading a lot about what’s going on. It made me learn and be very familiar with their ideology. That helped me tremendously later on in fighting the group and in investigating their actions and interviewing their operatives.\n\nIt’s fair to say at this point you’re reading original source material in Arabic.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou’re one of only a handful of how many people in the FBI?\n\nAt the time I think it was maybe eight, nine, something like that.\n\nHow many of them were working on Al Qaeda?\n\nI don’t know. I think maybe I was the only one. At least in the New York office I was the only one.\n\nThat seems a little surprising.\n\nYeah. I never even thought about it at the time.\n\nI mean, here we have a major emerging terrorist threat, two embassies bombed, a number of other attacks, and we’ve got one guy, Ali Soufan, inside the FBI who speaks Arabic and can read the materials that were being —\n\nBut we have other people who definitely speak Arabic and can read, but they were not working Al Qaeda, or they were assigned to organized crime; they were assigned to computer crimes, different investigations.\n\nSo you’re up all night, poring through these boxes of all this material that’s been collected, and you have nobody to help you that spoke Arabic.\n\nYeah, I learned a lot, though. It definitely helped me tremendously down the road. And I was able to basically walk the walk and talk the talk with this group, to include doing undercover. I think Operation Challenge was probably a turning point in my career. …\n\nBut you could have used some help, right?\n\nWell, I can use some help, but I felt that I’m helping others, because remember, at that time I was still the new kid on the block. So you’re working with legends in terrorism. You’re working with people like John O’Neill; people like Pat D’Amuro; people like from NYPD, for example, Tommy Corrigan, who worked the World Trade Center bombing. You’re working with John Anticev, who was one of the case agents for TERRSTOP. You’re working with people that you read books about and you saw them in movies, you know what I mean?\n\nYou’re just hoping, I hope one day I will be as good as them. You know what I mean? So it’s a learning process. …\n\nHere you are, this young kid, but you’re at the tip of the spear in terms of this investigation. What were you learning about Al Qaeda? How was it different than what you might have perceived a few years back when it was your hobby?\n\nI was learning that there are different individuals, basically. It’s not one entity called Al Qaeda and everyone in that entity is so brainwashed, like a borg, to use —\n\nThey weren’t all marching in lockstep to —\n\nYeah, I was learning that there’s a lot of divisions inside the group.\n\nIt was less impressive?\n\nYeah, it was less impressive. It was a group of people who basically were trying to figure ways how to deceive others. I learned that ideologically some of them really don’t even believe in what they are preaching. I know that many of them are motivated by money.\n\nFor example, the whole merge between Egyptian Islamic Jihad and Al Qaeda, in [bin Laden’s second in command, Ayman] al-Zawahiri’s perspective, was to find somebody who can fund Islamic Egyptian Jihad [sic]. And a lot of the oppositions from the group to al-Zawahiri’s merging with Al Qaeda — and that goes back to 1998 — all the fights and the arguments were about money.\n\nI learned a lot about what motivated them, how do they brainwash their people, how the threat actually evolved. The threat did not start with the U.S. The threat started with different regimes around the Middle East, and then that kind of like, over the years, when they failed to do any substantial changes in Egypt or in Libya or in Algeria or in Saudi Arabia, they ended up in Afghanistan with that rich kid, Osama bin Laden, who has a lot of money to put a lot of people under his umbrella.\n\nSo I learned a lot about the group dynamics, internal dynamics: who likes who; who really hates who; how they do their own logistics; how they buy their stuff — a lot of these things. I think it was extremely beneficial for me at that time. …\n\nI’m going to move forward. I don’t want to dwell. From the African embassy bombings, though, you’re learning about an organization that is far less impressive, far less monolithic than you made out in the U.S. press. It’s less the bogeyman. But they were a dangerous organization.\n\nThey were very lethal. When you’re like this, you’re probably more lethal than when you’re all unified, because there’s a lot of things happening. There’s a lot of dynamics going on in the group that makes it sometimes less predictable.\n\nDid you think at that time that this was a group of, say, a few hundred people that was going to be around for a while, could be defeated? What was your assessment of how difficult it would be —\n\nWell, I thought at the time, the only reason that they were able to operate effectively is because they are in Afghanistan, and nobody is going to make any decision to go to Afghanistan to get these guys. In the back of the collective memory, I believe, of everyone who was working this threat is what happened to the Soviets in Afghanistan, the Red Army. The Red Army was defeated in Afghanistan.\n\nSo we knew that we’re going to be dealing with this, and the only thing we can do is disrupt the threats, is trying to basically disrupt the organization. But we cannot end the organization. That is not an intelligence operation. That’s not a law enforcement operation. That has to be a strategic decision by Washington. Unfortunately, nobody made that decision.\n\nSo the best you could do was to investigate.\n\nThe best at the time, we were using only one tool in the tool box, which is intelligence and the law enforcement. That’s it. We were using that, and that tool, I considered it one at the time, not two different tools. And we had a lot of other tools in the tool box that we should have used. Unfortunately, at the time, as you know, nobody was paying attention. They say now nobody was paying attention to John. But it was bigger than John. Nobody was paying attention to this threat.\n\nYou guys were paying attention.\n\nWe were. I’m talking about strategically, as a strategic decision. People, for example, in the White House, there are some people who basically believed in the threat, like [counterterrorism expert] Dick Clarke, for example, people in DOJ [Department of Justice], people in the agency. But that did not accumulate into a strategic decision on how can we defeat this group and eliminate. That never happened.\n\nWe continued doing what we were doing on a daily basis. That’s it. Even after the U.S.S. Cole, which was absolutely an act of war, we never responded. We never responded against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We didn’t do anything after the Cole.\n\nDid you expect after the East African bombing to see more than what happened? There were bombings in Sudan, missiles fired at Sudan [in 1998].\n\nIn my personal opinion, that was totally wrong, what we did, especially the bombing in Sudan. I think that helped Al Qaeda to recruit more people and helped Al Qaeda in its own propaganda, because I think regardless of what we believed the target was in Sudan, toward the end it was broadcasted all over the world that it was a pharmaceutical factory.\n\nI think we should have hit harder in Afghanistan, focused only on Afghanistan. Bin Laden wasn’t in Sudan anymore. The Sudanese already kicked him out. And that shows kind of the disconnect between the reality on the ground and between the decisions that were being made in D.C.\n\nSo I think we should have done more, but also I think we should have done more when we knew that Al Qaeda was behind the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in killing 17 sailors on the Cole. But unfortunately, we didn’t do a thing. Not a thing.\n\nSo on East Africa, I remember at the time, it was a surprise. Why was this organization located in Afghanistan attacking two embassies in East Africa? What was the reason for attacking these two embassies in Tanzania and Kenya?\n\nWell, at the time, you have to put it in the context of what was happening. First of all, you have the 1998 fatwa. Then you have all the statements of bin Laden that took place between the 1998 fatwa and between the June statement, or the June interview that he gave to ABC News and to John Miller. And he discussed publicly why Al Qaeda, why they hate the United States, why Al Qaeda is issuing a fatwa to kill Americans.\n\nHe talks about presence in the Arabian Peninsula and Saudi Arabia as an invasion. He talks about [how] the United States wanted to basically steal the wealth of the Muslims, talking about oil. He talked about the sanctions we had on Iraq at the time and all the Iraqi children who were dying. He talks about the moral corruption of the Saudi oil family. He talks about supporting dictatorships in the Middle East.\n\nSo he mentioned why Al Qaeda wanted to hit America. Now, the East Africa embassy bombings, both in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, the target, the geographic target did not come as a surprise to us, because we were informed, and we knew when bin Laden was in Sudan that that was his area of operation, especially they built a cell in Nairobi, and that cell was headed by Khalid al Fawwaz, who later started the cell in London that led us to Operation Challenge. So that geographic area of operation of Al Qaeda was very well known to people in the agency and people in the FBI at the time, to the U.S. government.\n\nDo you think that it was communicated to the American people by the government as to what was happening? It seemed very confusing at the time.\n\nWell, you know, it is very confusing, even after the East African embassy bombing. A friend of mine was telling me, from the task force, we were in Yemen when the conviction came out on the East Africa embassy bombing trial, when all these subjects were found guilty, and that was something major. The cover of the New York papers at the time was about a shooting that took place with Jennifer Lopez and P. Diddy in one club in New York. It didn’t even make the first page in New York newspapers, so you can imagine in other market newspapers. You follow what I’m saying?\n\nPeople usually are not interested in these kind of things. And as much as you try to educate them and tell them there’s a threat, I don’t think a lot of people are going to pay attention to it until they really touch it, they really feel it, they really see it next to them. And that, unfortunately, would happen on 9/11.\n\nFrom talking to members of Al Qaeda, were they frustrated? Was there frustration within the organization that they couldn’t get America’s attention?\n\nNo, because they believed that they got America’s attention. They totally see it from a totally different prism than us. But they look at our lack of action as cowardness [sic]. And that’s what bin Laden used to tell them: “America are a bunch of cowards. Look how they ran away after the Marines were bombed in Beirut. Look how they ran away from Somalia after Black Hawk Down [Battle of Mogadishu].” And you can see that in his speeches again and again and again.\n\nAnd many Qaeda operatives told me that they believed that. These terrorists truly believe that Americans are a bunch of cowards and we run away. Immediately when somebody faces us, we run away. And one of them actually told me, he said: “Look, if you want to blame anybody for 9/11, you have to blame yourself. You guys did not do anything after the U.S.S. Cole, so the old man wanted to really get your attention.”\n\nThat’s 9/11.\n\nYep.\n\nSo during the 1998 investigation of the African embassy bombings, you learn about a switchboard. You called the Al Qaeda switchboard. What’s that about?\n\nThat’s actually a telephone number in a house owned by an old man known as Ahmed al-Hada. And we came to know about the number with the interview of [Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-]’Owhali, who is one of the suicide bombers that survived the Nairobi bombing.\n\nHe decided basically that he did his job, and if he dies then it’s suicide. And suicide is forbidden, so he ran away. And in the hospital, one of the agents was asking him about who he was. And the guy’s denying. Basically, he’s like: “No, I was here on business. I was in the area. I got injured. I don’t know what he’s talking about.”\n\nSo slowly, he started asking him about Abdullah Azzam, and he noticed that ‘Owhali smiled a little bit when he heard the name, so he knew that the guy, this individual is not only a businessman who was here by mistake; this was —\n\nAzzam was a legendary leader.\n\nFor the Arab Afghan.\n\nHe was a precursor to bin Laden, a mentor.\n\nA mentor to bin Laden. So at the time, the agent who was doing that interview is John Anticev, who worked the World Trade Center bombing, who worked the TERRSTOP operation, the operation that disrupted the bombing of the U.N. building, the federal building and a few tunnels and bridges around New York City. So he was very familiar with the group, with the ideas of the group and what they stand for.\n\nSo Johnny knew, just from that small little smile that ‘Owhali gave when he was talking to him, that there was more to this guy than just merely “I was at the wrong time at the wrong place.” So he continued to talking to him, and then suddenly he said, “Give me the number that you called after the bombing.”\n\nAnd he basically bluffed. He didn’t know; John did not know that the guy called any number. But he said it with so much determination, because he knew if this individual survived the bombing, he has to report about what happened. So he had to call someone.\n\nSo he said it with such a determination that ‘Owhali thought, definitely they know. And he gave him a paper and a pen, and he said, “Give me the number now, the number that you called.” And ‘Owhali actually automatically just — he wrote the number.\n\nHe decides not to lie.\n\nIt was a 200578 number, which is al-Hada’s number in Yemen. We checked the number. We found that that number has been also in contact with bin Laden’s satellite at the time in Afghanistan, with ‘Owhali’s call. So somebody has been reported over what happened.\n\nAnd then ‘Owhali later gave us that he wanted money and he wanted a passport to get out, and that what he asked them to do — and that number became an important number in the war against Al Qaeda.\n\nYou then shared that information with the CIA.\n\nYeah, absolutely, absolutely. As I mentioned earlier, we were working very closely together. not only with the CIA. We shared it with the entire intelligence community of the United States.\n\nAnd at the time, you say in the book that you had an operating agreement with the CIA that was reciprocal, that they would share information that they derived from that al-Hada phone number.\n\nYeah, absolutely, absolutely. It was something that’s going on between all the different intelligence agencies. When it comes to this story, we’re working together. They have people detailed to us, we have people detailed to them, and we worked very close together. We didn’t have any reason to believe otherwise.\n\nSo you both were monitoring that switchboard, if you will.\n\nI cannot talk about monitoring the switchboard or not monitoring the switchboard, but I can tell you that we were working closely together.\n\nYou were watching al-Hada and what calls were coming in.\n\nWe were watching Al Qaeda, and al-Hada’s center or al-Hada’s house was just another place in the total picture that we have, another piece of the puzzle.\n\nLater it would prove to be very important.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nThere was a fellow named L’Houssaine Kherchtou. Who was he?\n\nHe was a member of Al Qaeda when bin Laden was in Sudan, and he was sent by bin Laden to Nairobi for flight school training. Bin Laden was grooming him to be his own personal pilot. He was a Moroccan, and he joined Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He went to Afghanistan, fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, so he’s one of the very early members of Al Qaeda, and later moved to Sudan and Nairobi when bin Laden relocated the organization.\n\nHe was involved with setting up the Nairobi cell of Al Qaeda. He worked closely with Khalid al-Fawwaz and then later with Wadih el-Hage. And he was a person that can bring a lot of good information to us in knowing the details of not only what happened in the East Africa embassy bombing, but the overall Al Qaeda operation in the Horn of Africa.\n\nSo how did you get to him?\n\nWell, it was a long process. Some people in the task force, on I-49, that was their focus. And they did a phenomenal job in tracking his movement and finally were able to locate him with the help of other intelligence agencies from our allies. And then we went in to have a chat with him. …\n\nAfter the people in the task force were able to basically work with others in putting him pocket, as we say, have him, he’s available. I was asked by John O’Neill to join him, to go to Morocco and to talk to L’Houssaine. Also the team included prosecutors from the Southern District of New York. John O’Neill definitely was there; a few people from the JTTF, including the individual who has been tracking him, and she did most of the work in trying to get to Joe.\n\nTo Joe?\n\nJoe the Moroccan. His alias in Al Qaeda is Yusuf, and Yusuf means Joe, Joseph. So we called him Joe, by his Al Qaeda name. And I learned a lot during the dealing with him. I think I learned how you don’t put all your cards on the table. Even people who are acting [like] they are cooperating with you, they will always try to hide things. And it’s your knowledge; it’s what you know. It’s playing that poker mental game with them that is going to give you the information that you want and guarantee that, to the most part, you’re going to get everything you need from them. I don’t think you get everything 100 percent from any individual you interrogate. That’s not possible. But I think you’ll get enough from these individuals.\n\nAnd I think with Joe, the deal was, or the mission was at the time with Joe, was that we also want his cooperation, not only to give us information during an interview, not only to interrogate him and get what we need from him, but also to have him cooperate and work with us, to have him actually switch sides from being Al Qaeda member to being a witness for the United States government.\n\nAnd how did you do that?\n\nI think it was a great teamwork, definitely. You cannot do any of these things if you don’t have the Justice Department onboard with you and working with you. And I think the credit [for] the most part goes to Pat Fitzgerald, who was the AUSA [assistant U.S. attorney] handling that case.\n\nBut you had received some specific information about his attitudes toward bin Laden.\n\nOh, absolutely. And that helped us tremendously.\n\nFirst of all, there’s a reason when all Al Qaeda left Sudan and went to Afghanistan. The guy stayed there. That by itself is very telling. Now, yes, for many years, all his friends are Qaeda members. It does not mean that he’s not still friends with them. But what is his ideological commitment? What is his operational commitment to the group if he didn’t go with them to Afghanistan?\n\nSo this was a guy you thought you might be able to pick off because he wasn’t making the pilgrimage to —\n\nHe wasn’t making the journey to Afghanistan. And also in the same time, we have from different sources that he had some problems, financial issues with bin Laden. And basically, Joe is a very caring husband and very caring father. And when he was working on Al Qaeda business in Nairobi, he came back to Sudan to find his wife almost living in the street. And that hurt him that they were not taking care of her.\n\nShe was supposed to be provided for by the Al Qaeda office.\n\nBy Al Qaeda office, by their administrative office. Also in the same time, she was sick. She was pregnant; she needed Caesarean operation, and Al Qaeda won’t give him the money — a few hundred dollars. But they said they don’t have any money. And he gets really upset. He said if he was Egyptian, they will give him the money, because Egyptians were in control of the organization — or he thought they were in control of the organization.\n\nAnd so they told him why don’t you go to a hospital that was a free hospital. It was a horrible hospital, and he will never take his wife there. So that left in Joe’s heart and in Joe’s mind a lot of resentment about Al Qaeda. And he knew that these guys will throw him under the bus in a second. And he truly believed it [was] his nationality that made them act like this with him.\n\nYou knew this about him.\n\nWe knew that about him.\n\nInformation, as you write in the book, is your weapon.\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely. So when you talk to an emotional individual, a loving husband, regardless [that] he was a member of Al Qaeda, but it does not mean that he does not love his children or love his wife, and tell him that “I know what happened,” I think emotionally you’re pressing a button. Luckily with Joe the Moroccan, it was a very bright button that we needed to press in order for him to spill his guts for you.\n\nSo you brought this up with him.\n\nWe brought this up with him, yeah.\n\nYou were out having pizza.\n\nYeah, actually the people that were helping us — the Moroccans — took us out. We went for prayers, for Friday prayers, and we went to a pizza parlor. And it was such an interesting situation where you’re sitting eating a pizza with Al Qaeda terrorist.\n\nAnd then we’re walking to the car, and it was so surreal. And I think it was so surreal for him and so surreal for me. And he kind of looked at me, and I looked at him. I said: “You know what? It’s very weird for me, too, to be in this situation.” But I think we developed a good rapport. We bonded. And I think that helped him make the decision to cooperate and come over.\n\nI talked to him about the United States. I talked to him about being an Arab in the United States and a lot of these kind of things, and cable television, stuff that he was interested to know about. Silly stuff, but also very important stuff.\n\nSo, as you put it, he sang.\n\nYep. Like a bird.\n\nAnd where is Joe the Moroccan now?\n\nWitness protection.\n\nLiving somewhere under the protection of the U.S. government?\n\nYep. And his statement, when he testified in the East Africa embassy bombing, was extremely important, because the casing for the Nairobi embassy that took place prior to the terrorist attack was done from his own apartment. So he witnessed what happened. He witnessed the surveillance photos. He witnessed the discussions, everything that took place.\n\nSo his statement as a witness was essential for the conviction of all those who were convicted for being involved in the conspiracy of attacking all two embassies in Dar es Salaam and in Nairobi.\n\nAnd from that, you learned a great deal about what you could accomplish with these guys.\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely. Yep. Because with Joe, it was from the beginning. With Fadl, yes, I saw him a couple of times, but I wasn’t involved in basically recruiting him. I wasn’t involved in getting all the information from him at the very beginning, because this is the hardest time, because you think these people are cooperating with you, but my God, it’s a process. They’re not going to be honest with you immediately.\n\nBut Joe was different, because Joe was from the very beginning. I worked a little bit on trying to track him down, but [for] the most part, I worked on trying to flip him. And I think I learned that with knowledge, you can accomplish a lot. And also I learned that you can catch way more flies with honey than with vinegar.\n\nSo he was really your first significant case, if you will.\n\nHe was. And I wasn’t the lead on him; I was part of the team. However, I learned a lot. This is a case that, to know how to use not only what information you have, but how and when in your interrogation strategy you should use the information that you have, and I learned that from witnessing and participating in the Joe the Moroccan operation.\n\nIt almost sounds like you liked him.\n\nYes, absolutely. As an individual, he’s a caring father; he’s a loving husband. He is a person who felt betrayed by Al Qaeda after he joined them to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. At the time, we supported the mujahideen against the Soviets. And I think after Sudan, he felt that Al Qaeda was taking advantage of him, and he left the group.\n\nNow, you can like an individual, you can like sitting with him, dealing with him, but also at the same time you have to keep in the back of your mind why you’re sitting with him and why you’re dealing with him. You cannot forget that.\n\nBut it’s very important that you were able to relate to him and to others as we go forward, not as monsters, not as evildoers, but as —\n\nYou have to make that connection. You have to have some empathy when you’re dealing with individuals. As least everyone is a human being at one level. Now, some people are way more evil than others, but my goal was to get what I need from the individual. That’s what my goal is: to get actionable intelligence, to get information that can help in the investigation, that can help my government in accomplishing its aims and its goals. And if I needed to build a rapport with an individual to do that, I will. But these individuals, like any other human being, have a tendency to really cooperate with you when there is some kind of rapport going on, because I differentiate greatly between compliance and between cooperation. I don’t want compliance. I’m not looking for compliance. Compliance means you will tell me whatever I need you to tell me. That’s not what I need. I want actionable intelligence. I want true information, not false leads. That can only be achieved through cooperation, not through compliance. …\n\nMany of them are motivated by the fact that they live under dictators in the Middle East, repressive, cruel dictatorships.\n\nSure. That helped in their recruitment.\n\nAnd they were fooled, perhaps, in your view, by joining Al Qaeda. But their motivation was something that you must have felt some kinship with. Nobody who lives in the Middle East can ignore that there are, in some cases, U.S.-supported dictatorships there perpetuating terrible —\n\nRight. I am not there to basically debate foreign policy with these individuals, right? There’s a lot of people who oppose our foreign policy in the world. There’s a lot of Americans who have criticism for our foreign policy in every region around the globe, not only the Middle East. That does not mean that they are killing innocent people. That does not mean that they are blowing up buildings. That does not mean that they are attacking nightclubs. That does not mean that they are blowing up mosques.\n\nHaving that choice, having the freedom to oppose something is one thing. Killing the innocent because you believe that it’s your way or not way is something else. So what I am focusing on is how we can save lives. What I’m focusing on [is] how can we prevent these guys from killing more people. That is the focus of what we’re doing. That’s the focus of any intelligence officer, any law enforcement agent, any person who is involved in this fight.\n\nAnd if you will talk about this with people who are fighting Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia or people who are fighting Al Qaeda in Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim country in the world, or people who are fighting Al Qaeda in the United States, there is no difference in the focus against the group.\n\nWhere were you? How did you learn about the Cole bombing? What was the first thing that came to mind?\n\nI remember I was on the Brooklyn Bridge. It was early in the morning. It was early in the morning. I was driving to the office, and I got a phone call saying to come to the office fast. I was told that a ship, a Navy ship, was attacked in Aden, in the Port of Aden. …\n\nSo I went to the office, and the only thing I can think of [is] why the heck do we have a Navy ship in Aden? I mean, that was not something new, that there’s heavy presence of Al Qaeda in Yemen. That is not new that there was a threat against attacking possibly a ship, an American ship in Aden. We got that during the interview with ‘Owhali.\n\n‘Owhali told Steve Gaudin — who was the agent that built the rapport with ‘Owhali and was able to create that relationship with him — that he heard a person known as Nashiri talk to another individual about attacking a Navy ship using missiles in Yemen. And that was disseminated to the entire intelligence law enforcement and military community.\n\nSo in the back of my mind: Why the heck do we have a Navy ship in Aden? I mean, hello? I honestly thought at the time that we don’t use the Port of Aden. I didn’t know any better.\n\nSo I went to the office, and again, it was the issue of who did it. Was it Al Qaeda, or was it some other group? So who’s going to respond? The New York office or the Washington Field Office?\n\nThe tug-of-war began.\n\nThe tug-of-war began again. And then the decision was to send two teams, one from the WFO and one from New York. And in this way, when we knew who did it, the other team can faze out so the investigations don’t get hurt.\n\nWas there any doubt who did it?\n\nNo, absolutely not. We had no doubt whatsoever.\n\n… I think when we went to Yemen and we started doing the investigation, we were very sure that it was an Al Qaeda operation; it wasn’t any other group. It has all the hallmarks of a bin Laden operation.\n\nHow soon did you go to Yemen?\n\nSame day. I actually left to Yemen wearing the same clothes in October, I think Oct. 12 of 2000. …\n\nAnd you began the investigation. How do you begin something like that? Where do you start?\n\nOh, my God. Luckily, you have excellent people working with you. You start from the crime scene. You start taking statements from people who were on the ship, or people in the harbor, anybody who saw something, and you start building on that.\n\nThen you start interviewing people seen about that fit the description. You start following the paper trail of rental agreements and boats, ownership, look into the car that you found at the launch site, who owns the car. So it’s kind of like, it’s a long investigative process. You start putting the pieces together, the puzzle together, small, little pieces at a time.\n\nWhen you get to Aden in Yemen, you’re not always dealing with the crime scene, but you’re dealing with your hosts in the country. It was a very difficult investigation.\n\nYes. Our first obstacle was that our host did not believe that the attack on the Cole was a result of a terrorist attack. At the beginning they believed it was just an accident. And then, after taking a high-level delegation to the ship, showing them the impact of the explosion that it’s going inward, not outward, them hearing from witnesses of what happened with the boat coming and everything, at least they were convinced that it was a terrorist attack; somebody attacked the ship; it was not a bombing or internal explosion that took place, as they claimed initially.\n\nThen, after the trip to the ship, we went back to the Mövenpick Hotel where we were staying at the time, and it was a Yemeni delegation on one side and the U.S. delegation on the other side, a long conference room-type of a table in the business center of the hotel. The Yemeni side, you had the head of the PSO [Political Security Office] in Aden, Yemen, the local PSO, some people from the different Yemeni entities, plus the head of the presidential security of President [Ali Abdullah] Saleh. And on our side it was John O’Neill, some of the people from the bureau, from DOJ, David Kelly and myself. And it was interesting that the person from the PSO, the Political Security Office, their intelligence service, started the conversation by saying: “Look, you are right. It was a result of a terrorist attack, we agree, but the suicide bombers had been killed in the process, so there’s nothing to investigate, because both of them are dead, so you can just go home.” As you probably can predict, it didn’t go well.\n\nEventually we met with President Saleh. Director [Freeh] came to Yemen, and President Saleh put the investigation in the hand of Ghalib [al-]Qamish who was the head of the Political Security Office, the PSO. He came from San’a. And John O’Neill at the time and us starting dealing straight with Ghalib Qamish, and this was the beginning of working together with the Yemenis on this case, but it was significantly difficult at the very beginning. Imagine going to a country where your counterpart doesn’t even want you there in the first place.\n\nIt didn’t immediately get easy for you, though, did it?\n\nNo. It was building also a rapport with Qamish. The visit helped tremendously, showed that we are very serious. There was the political support from the White House at the time, from the State Department for our investigation. The Yemenis knew that “You know what? You really have to cooperate on this investigation. That’s important for us.” And that was obvious with us dealing with Qamish on all the things that were taking place, and we developed a personal relationship with Ghalib Qamish. Ghalib wasn’t a guy who gave us anything we wanted.\n\nSo you’re in Yemen, you’ve got this incredible maze of leads to follow, you’re not getting cooperation from the Yemenis, and you’re beginning also to run up against what we call “the wall.” What’s going on here?\n\nWhen we started the investigation, we divided the group, our investigative team, to different units, if you want to call it. My co-case agent at the time, Steve Bongardt, he had a back injury, but he insisted to come with us to Yemen anyway, and he endured the very difficult flight on a military plane to Yemen. So he cannot be that mobile outside, so he was in the Command Post, and he was in charge of the intelligence.\n\nAt the very first meeting that we had, we found out that if he wanted to be, or if he is going to handle intelligence, he cannot share any of the information with us, because we’re considered criminal agents, and he is going to be handling intelligence. Now, all of us have been working in this world for a long period of time. We never encountered that. That was something new. That was what was later referred to as between intelligence and between criminal. There was misunderstanding of the Attorney General Guidelines of the time period that brought this interpretation that intelligence cannot be shared with people who are working on criminal investigations. And this misrepresentation of the facts and this misunderstanding of the Attorney General Guideline was very clear later with the 9/11 Commission.\n\nNow, Steve did not agree that if you share anything with me I cannot tell it to my team on the ground. There is intelligence sometimes about threats, and we know how to use that intelligence and for the system not to be abused. We’ve been doing it for a long period of time. That is the very first time we noticed that there was something different going on, that now people who are handling intelligence are not allowed to share the information with people who are working criminal cases. We never had this problem to that extent in previous investigations we worked with. As I told you before, we were working closely with the agency, and now there is this new wall that we have. Now there is this new interpretation of protocol. It’s the same Attorney General Guideline, but it’s a new interpretation of this guideline.\n\nBy the agency.\n\nBy the Department of Justice, by the agency, and by the FBI, by people in the FBI, so it was by the U.S. government in general.\n\nSo you’re being boxed out.\n\nWe’re being boxed out from the intelligence world, yes.\n\nSo if the CIA came across a piece of intelligence that might have helped your investigation and would have helped your investigation, you couldn’t be told about it.\n\nBecause of that wall.\n\nWhat sense does that make?\n\nNothing. It didn’t make any sense. We fought back. We fought back. We even at one point had a delegation, I think the end of June or July, come from the Department of Justice to the New York office to talk to agents and members of the JTTF about how silly that interpretation is. Unfortunately, we didn’t win the battle.\n\nYou write about how Steve used to take to putting on the recording of The Wall by Pink Floyd.\n\nWe did that. Steve was on the forefront of that, and the reason he was on the forefront of that was because he was the first person to be designated as an intelligence agent on the team to deal with the agency, to deal with the other intelligence agencies that’s operating and get the intelligence in order to share it with the investigative team. And he continued to fight this battle. He continued to fight these battles on different fronts.\n\nSteve is a Navy pilot. He’s a Top Gun pilot. He has a Top Gun mentality. He’s not convinced; he does not take no for an answer, and he continued to fight this until 9/11. And he was prophetic in some of the stuff that he said to people at the time. He said: “Wall or no wall, people won’t understand. People will die.” And the reason is, we felt that there was something going on. Unfortunately, because of the rules, or the alleged rules, “You guys cannot know about it.” And unfortunately, it took almost 3,000 innocent lives to perish until somebody decided that it’s time for us to know about it.\n\nTo take down that wall.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSo you’re going forward with your investigation. Who is the first person that you’re able to interrogate?\n\nThe very first person was Jamal Badawi. Jamal Badawi was a member of Al Qaeda. Before joining Al Qaeda he fought in Bosnia. He met many of the terrorists, the operational terrorists who were involved in the Cole and other terrorist activities, back in Bosnia, actually. Then he went to Afghanistan. He became close to other members of Al Qaeda that coordinated the Cole attack. He was the kind of on-the-ground liaison for the Cole attack.\n\nAnd you get onto him after a lot of groundwork.\n\nWe got to him after groundwork. We got to him after witnesses’ statements, people who saw him. I mean, you’re talking about a small little neighborhood called the Tiwal neighborhood in Aden, and people in that neighborhood know each other. And that neighborhood in Aden, some people call it Little Kandahar, because many youth from that neighborhood went to Afghanistan and fought in Afghanistan or became members of Al Qaeda. So this wasn’t brain surgery to figure out where the people were who were involved in it. And many witnesses, especially at the site that was considered to be the bomb factory, if you call it, stated that Jamal Badawi, a person that they know, they recognize he’s from their neighborhood, is a person who brought the unknown subs to run that specific location, so he was our logical lead.\n\nSo you asked for him to be picked up, or you picked him up?\n\nWell, we did not pick up people. The Yemen government picked him up, and we were allowed to have access to him and to interrogate him.\n\nAnd so how did you approach that? What happened?\n\nIt was difficult at the beginning, because Mr. Badawi didn’t want to cooperate. He was just giving you what you think you know, which is a typical counter-interrogation, a very intuitive counter-interrogation technique. And it took some time. The only knowledge we have at the time is our knowledge of Al Qaeda. We didn’t know much about what happened in the Cole. So we were taking these pieces and putting it together to develop our own interrogation plan. And Badawi tried to present himself as a leader, as a person who is very well known, and a pious Muslim, and he would never lie, and he’s not scared of anyone. And actually, that gave me a lot of things to work with. Every time he talks, he provided lies, we let it go, and then we face him with evidence that contradicts his lies.\n\nOne of the biggest problems Badawi had, and many of the people we interrogated in Yemen [had], was that they cannot keep a timeline; they are not linear thinkers. Most educated people have the tendency to be linear thinkers; everything leads to another thing; there is logic. With them, and I see that with many Al Qaeda people, Al Qaeda terrorists that I interrogated, they more believe in conspiracies. There’s a big conspiracy that controls everything that happens in the world. People who believe in conspiracies have the tendency not to be linear thinkers, to suspend logic, to suspend critical thinking, and that is the area where I approached the interrogation plan with Jamal Badawi.\n\nThat is the area [where] you approached the interrogation. What do you mean by that?\n\nThis is the angle that I used to develop my interrogation plan.\n\nFor example, Badawi, number one, doesn’t want to get caught lying. Number two, he cannot keep a timeline, so let him give his timeline and show him that he was lying. That will embarrass him, so he will give you more. Then you keep doing it again and again and again, not necessarily with the timeline, but every story he is telling you there is a timeline associated with the story; there is events that evolved into each other to get to the story that he was talking about — his trip to Bosnia, his trip to Afghanistan, him being in the training camps in Afghanistan, him getting sick in Afghanistan, how he met and how he became close associates with those who were involved in coordinating and carrying out the attack. So it’s small little things, but you have to take it one piece at a time.\n\nYou catch him in inconsistencies.\n\nYou catch him in inconsistencies. Sometimes people get annoyed with me when I tell them to repeat the story, and I actually act like [the TV detective] Columbo: “I’m sorry. I don’t remember. What did you mention?” But I remember everything you said before, and we’re trying to see where are you lying, where the story doesn’t fit, where there is some kind of inconsistencies, so then we can check why you’re giving that inconsistency. And sometimes it’s based on a hunch; it’s not based on anything else.\n\nFor example, he was talking about going to Afghanistan, so I said to him, “What passport did you use to go to Afghanistan?,” knowing that many Al Qaeda operatives, especially in Yemen, have multiple passports, because it was so easy to get a passport in Yemen under any name you want. So he said, “It’s my passport.” “Well, I know it’s your passport, but what name?” He said, “My name.” I said, “What’s your name?” He said, “Jamal.” I said: “I understand, but is it Jamal Badawi? Is it another Jamal? I mean, come on. We’re going to play this game forever?” And so he thought, how the heck do I know that Jamal — I said Jamal, but he has another passport with a different last name, so he basically said, “Well, yeah, it is Jamal al-Tali.”\n\nWell, that was significant, because a pager that was used in the attack to send —\n\nThe bombers?\n\n— the bombers, yeah, the code, the 01010 code, that pager was purchased by a guy with the name Jamal al-Tali. So actually you nailed him to the call itself. Then you don’t face him with this information. You keep it going. Later on you say, “Well,” when we’re talking more about the call now — this is the stuff that he doesn’t want to give you — “you were involved.” “No, I am not involved with that.” “OK, so how come a name that you just gave me, Jamal al-Tali, has been used to purchase a pager that was used in the attack?” Now he’s back. Now he is trying to collect his thoughts again. Most probably he’ll give you another lie, and you go with it, and you do another thing to catch him in it.\n\nSo it’s a combination of intelligence that you have. It’s a combination of information that you have. It’s a combination of gut feeling based on your knowledge, because I believe knowledge creates a sixth sense, and when you know how the group functions, you can predict their moves, and when you predict their moves, you know what the logical step is going to be. And when he is lying about that logical step, your role as an interrogator [is] to explore why [he] is lying about that stuff.\n\nYou had a partner during that interrogation.\n\nNCIS agent Ken Reuwer.\n\nSo Ken, he was taking notes.\n\nKen was sitting there. Bob couldn’t do the interrogation with me, so — Ken does not speak Arabic. Now, we have another person who kind of translated, but Ken was sitting kind of to the end of the table, so he wasn’t actually really knowing —\n\nHe wasn’t knowing what was being said.\n\nYeah, Ken was sitting, and Ken was just focusing on Badawi, looking at him. And every now and then, Ken remembers something, because he doesn’t understand what’s really happening, not verbatim. So he used to send me a yellow sticky — he had some yellow stickies on him– send a note: “Did you ask him about this? Did you mention this?” And, interestingly enough, Badawi for some reason, he became very suspicious about that. And I noticed that he started looking at Ken, looking at me, looking at the notes, so I asked him, I said, “It seems that you’re a little bit interested in these notes.” And he basically said: “No, that’s your job. I don’t care about it.” I said: “Well, I’ll explain to you. I told you that I will be very transparent with you. My friend here is an expert in human behavior. He’s a human polygraph machine. He looks at you. He tells me every time you’re lying, or he tells me at least when you’re not saying the truth. He tells me when you’re trying to hide things.”\n\nSo every time after that, because Badawi — in the interrogation room we have kind of a window, and he’s on the other side of the window — now every time Badawi was trying to hide something or not to be truthful, he, in the corner of his eyes, [is] looking at Ken and trying to move away from his eyesight. So actually Jamal Badawi became his own polygraph machine, so we start knowing every time he was lying to us just because of his behavior, trying to avoid Ken. Interestingly enough, Ken did not know what’s happening until the end, and we used it for the rest of our interrogation with him.\n\nThat’s the story of the human polygraph.\n\nThis is the story of the human polygraph machine.\n\nIs it from Badawi that you learn about Khallad, his deputy [Fahd al-]Quso?\n\nWe learned [a lot about] Khallad from both of them, but we also learned about Khallad before we interrogated them from our meetings with —\n\nUntil you talked to Quso?\n\nNo. The meeting in Southeast Asia?\n\nYeah.\n\nYes, but not in any details. We knew that he, back in November — and this is from the PSO, the Political Security Office — that Quso said that he traveled to Southeast Asia back in November of 2000, but we didn’t know much details until later on when we interrogated him and he provided more intelligence. But the meeting in Southeast Asia we knew about from Quso.\n\nSo you learn about Khallad from Badawi, and you’d also heard about him earlier. You’re starting to collect information.\n\nRight. We know about Khallad because of his involvement with Badawi and with Quso. And Badawi and Quso, we determined that they were directly linked, and they admitted that they were directly linked to the bombing of the Cole.\n\nSo after Badawi — this is the only guy you’ve been able to really get your hands on – and you’re continuing to get resistance from the Yemenis, and you were getting resistance also for just being in the country from the ambassador. Tell me what was going on.\n\nI think the ambassador [Barbara Bodine], it’s not fair to say that she was resisting us being in the country. The ambassador had a different view of what the FBI should do. I mean, from her perspective, we should trust the Yemenis more; we should work closely with the Yemenis. We were working closely with the Yemenis, but we have a problem with the issue of trust. She had the different view that Yemen is a safe place for us; we really don’t need the security that we needed. And that was, I think, the biggest problem between her and between the bureau at the time.\n\nShe also had an issue with the amount of people that we need initially for the investigation. This is a major investigation, and we look at it as an investigation where you need the technical people. You need the bomb tech; you need the divers to collect evidence; you need the investigators to interview people, to talk to witnesses. From her perspective, “Why don’t you have a small little delegation that can work closely with the Yemenis and investigate this together?”\n\nEditor’s Note: In 2002, Amb. Bodine was quoted in New Yorker magazine, “The idea that John or his people or the FBI were somehow barred from doing their job is insulting to the U.S. government, which was working on Al Qaeda before John ever showed up. This is all my embassy did for 10 months.”\n\nUnfortunately, the events that we witnessed in Yemen, systematically witnessed in Yemen, prevented us from trusting our counterpart at that time. The relationship became better later on, but initially, especially when we’re in Aden, we had a significant problem with that.\n\nWhat kind of events were leading you not to trust?\n\nFirst of all, the person who was in charge of the PSO in Aden, as I mentioned, even after he was convinced and we showed him evidence that it was a terrorist attack, he basically said, “The people are dead; go home; there’s nothing to investigate.” So this is a mentality.\n\nMany other things happened. Every time, for example, he knew about a witness talking to us, he used to go and punish the witness for talking to us. Sometimes he’d interrupt the interrogations of Quso, for example. He goes in, gives him hugs and kisses on both cheeks. Another individual who was cooperating with us from the group that helped Al Qaeda procure government passports — he’s an official in the Yemeni government — he basically at one point slapped him in front of us. That’s an indication that you don’t cooperate.\n\nOne day he allows access. If his boss is not in town, Ghalib Qamish, the PSO, he does not give access. So it’s a continuation process.\n\nAt one point, there was a poster needed to be published in all Yemeni newspapers. It’s the Rewards for Justice program by the State Department, basically putting a reward for anyone who provides information, secret information very confidentially to lead to those who were involved in the U.S.S. Cole. That helped us tremendously in East Africa. That gave us the phone call that led to the arrest in Tawfiq [bin Attash, also known as Khallad], the suicide bomber, in the first place. So, we did the same thing, and they did it through the embassy. The next day in all the papers, it’s basically warning people not to cooperate with us.\n\nIt was reprinted to say exactly the opposite of what you had handed the paper.\n\nYup.\n\nSo somebody got in the way.\n\nThey say it’s a translation error.\n\nI mean, [it was] one thing after the other. It made us very uncomfortable sometimes.\n\nSo you continued to have these problems, and Ambassador Bodine thinks your presence is too strong, that you’re not trusting the Yemenis enough, and John O’Neill and Barbara Bodine are having a difficult time getting along.\n\nRight. I think that Ambassador Bodine was looking at it from a State Department perspective. She has to deal with the Yemenis. We’re looking at it from a different perspective. There are 17 sailors who were killed, and we need to find justice for them.\n\nAnd I think it did not help that both Ambassador Bodine and John have very strong personalities, and it caused a clash, and then I think it became more personal than people focusing on the matter at hand.\n\nJohn was very upset.\n\nJohn was very upset, absolutely. I mean, John, I think, was the very first U.S. government senior manager that was PNG’d from a country by the ambassador, by the U.S. ambassador.\n\nPersona non grata.\n\nPersona non grata. She won’t allow him to come back and finish leading the investigation.\n\nSo he had gone back to New York to do some work and wasn’t allowed back in the country.\n\nHe came back to New York after Thanksgiving, I believe, and he wasn’t allowed back in the country. That never happened before. So it’s very difficult for him also not to take it personal. It’s very difficult for the FBI not to take it personal.\n\nWhat is the sense that you’re picking up as to what the support is at the higher levels of the government back in Washington?\n\nWe were getting a lot of good support from the director of the FBI who actually visited the country and from the attorney general at the time. We had almost daily conference calls, daily VDCs with them, and they were updated daily on the investigation. But I think everyone in Washington at the time was busy with the election, and then everyone was busy with Bush vs. Gore, and not a lot of people were focusing on what we were doing in Yemen.\n\nYou write about the resistance to linking the Cole bombing to Al Qaeda. What was that?\n\nThat continued.\n\nBut why?\n\nWhat we were hearing at the time, and we were told that by a chief of staff of a senator, that the country is not unified behind the president — I’m talking about President Bush now — that if we say that Al Qaeda was behind the Cole, the president has to do something about it, and if he doesn’t do something about it, he will look weak on national security.\n\nHowever, the political environment prevents him from doing anything at this time in Afghanistan, because the country is not unified behind him. And at the time, our response was, “Well, sorry, sir, but this is way above our grade level.” Al Qaeda did it. We knew Al Qaeda did it back in November of 2000. And that ended that meeting. And the person, to be fair for him, was just saying that they disagree with the White House on this, but this is what’s happening.\n\nAnd later on, we found out that even in the 9/11 Commission, some senior members of the administration called — to include the Secretary of Defense — called the Cole case old or too many times had passed or stale, in the word of [Deputy] Secretary [of Defense Paul] Wolfowitz, so that was the mentality of the administration of the time in looking at the Cole. It’s a stale case; it’s old; why focus on it?\n\nDrop it.\n\nDrop it.\n\nHow much time is there between Badawi and Quso’s interrogation?\n\nImmediately after each other.\n\nSo after you talk to Badawi, you’ve got a lead; there’s somebody else you now want to talk to. Tell me who that is.\n\nWell, after Badawi we wanted to talk to Quso, because in a way operationally, yes, he was a deputy. He was a person who managed the guesthouse in Aden. And Badawi told us that he delegated the videotaping of the operation to Quso, so we know Quso is involved. So we had access to talk to him.\n\nIn other words, at this point the Yemenis agreed to let you talk to Quso. Prior to that, without Badawi’s —\n\nWe had also an agreement that was signed by Ambassador Bodine and the Yemeni government about the way that we can proceed with the investigation. That agreement was negotiated by the Department of Justice here and their Ministry of Justice over there.\n\nAnd it took weeks.\n\nIt took weeks if not months to get to it.\n\nRight. Which delayed you.\n\nWhich delayed us.\n\nBut finally, after interviewing Badawi, you requested to see the deputy.\n\nAnd Quso was also another example, very similar interrogation style to Badawi. But Quso was more humble than Badawi was, and he provided significant information, not only about the Cole itself and what happened and his knowledge about it, but he provided a lot of information about Afghanistan, about the training camps, about people he met over in Afghanistan.\n\nHe talked about an emir of a guesthouse in Kandahar known as Abu Jandal. He talks about different people that he met when he was in Afghanistan. He talks about his close relationship with an operative known as Khallad. He talked about a person that he actually picked him up and drove him to Al Qaeda guesthouse in Kandahar. He’s a Sudanese Al Qaeda member. … So he provided a lot of good information.\n\nWhy is he talking to you?\n\nAgain, very similar interrogation technique that we used with Badawi. It wasn’t easy. It took days. It took maybe about a week in talking to him, and every day we used to get more information using the same style.\n\nQuso was one of these people who basically believed at one point that he saw me in Afghanistan. He did not believe that anyone from outside the group would know so much about the group, and he was convinced at one point that — he told me: “I saw you in Kandahar. Now I remember you.” I said, “Maybe.”\n\nI used it to my advantage, because the ego of these guys, they believe that they are the best in what they do. There’s no way America would know so much about them. So we used that to our benefit.\n\nQuso was also a guy that when I was waiting for him in the interrogation room, and he came over, I asked him how was he doing, and he looked at me, and he said, “I’ll wait for the American interrogator to come.” I said, “Well, it’s me.” And he was really shocked.\n\nHe thought you were a translator.\n\nA person like me, looks like me, Muslim from my name — it’s obvious —\n\nSpeaking Arabic.\n\nSpeaking Arabic to him, and I am an FBI agent? There’s no way. There’s no way. That’s against everything he believes in. So we utilized all these small little things as part of our interrogation plan. So in so many ways it’s similar to Badawi, but in so many ways it’s also very different than Badawi.\n\nEach one is different.\n\nEach one is different. There is no cookie-cutter approach.\n\nHe tells you about the December 1999 phone call.\n\nWell, Khallad was a very important person for us. We knew about Khallad for a while now, and we knew about Khallad’s involvement in Al Qaeda, not necessarily in the Cole and with Quso. So Khallad was an important person, so when he said his connection to this whole operation starts with Khallad, the very logical question [is], “When is the last time you saw Khallad?” And he said, “Well, I saw him last time in Bangkok.”\n\nFor me, what the heck [is] this guy doing in Bangkok? I said: “So tell me the story about Bangkok. Why did you go to Bangkok? Who did you go with?” To make a long story short, he said Khallad contacted him at his house. He asked him to go San’a, meet Ibrahim Nibras or Ibrahim al-Thawar, aka Nibras. Nibras was one of the suicide bombers in the Cole. That was in December of 1999.\n\nSo 10 or 11 months before the bombing.\n\nYup. And he told him to help Nibras deliver some money to him in Southeast Asia from Saudi Arabia.\n\nFrom Saudi Arabia. Some Al Qaeda operative had brought it to him, so he had this money.\n\nSo he had this money, and the idea was to send two people, because they can spread the money among them, and it will be less than the amount declarable by customs, so nobody will be suspicious if they separate it between them. The amount was $36,000, and Khallad told them to basically deliver it to Singapore.\n\nThey bought the tickets. They went to Singapore through Bangkok. However, they did not know that they actually needed visas to go to Singapore, so they ended up in Bangkok. They did not know how to reach Khallad, so they decided to call Yemen, call the Al Qaeda operative in Yemen that they know that Khallad will call him, and Quso also talked to his family and told them, “If this guy calls me, tell him I’m at this number.” And they gave him a number.\n\nSo Khallad called them at the hotel, and later on he came over, traveled to Bangkok, and went and saw them at the Washington Hotel and took the $36,000 from them. That’s what Quso told us. He provided information about when he received the call, how he traveled, how Khallad called his house and called Nibras’ house looking for them. We pieced all these things together, and we found out that the phone number that has been in contact with the Washington Hotel has been in contact with Quso’s house and has been in contact in the common number. And this is just regular investigative work. It’s a number in Malaysia. And that’s how we got to the Malaysia number.\n\nSo Khallad is calling to the Washington Hotel —\n\nTo the Washington Hotel.\n\n— from Malaysia.\n\nAccording to the story that Quso told us. We investigated all the phone numbers, and we found out —\n\nWhy does Quso think he’s delivering $36,000 with Khallad?\n\nWell, Quso claimed that he doesn’t know. He said maybe because Khallad wants to get a new leg, but a new leg over there costs about $1,600 — this is a top-of-the-line leg, so that amount is more than that. And later on, we found out that Khallad already got a new leg before the money was delivered, so it was definitely not for the leg.\n\nSo Quso doesn’t know why he’s doing this errand.\n\nAt least he claimed he did not know, and I believe that he didn’t know. I believe that at this instant he was truthful.\n\nSo you’re starting to think about why this is going on.\n\nOh, absolutely. We thought about many different things. The number one, the very first thing that came in our mind maybe it happened during the millennium.\n\nRemember, during the millennium there is many operations from Al Qaeda. There is [Ahmed] Ressam trying to do something in LAX. There is a millennium plot in Jordan that was coordinated by [9/11 suspect] Abu Zubaydah. There is also, we found out, uncovered, a failed attack on a Navy ship in Aden, the U.S.S. The Sullivans.\n\nSo we thought maybe Al Qaeda at the time, because it happened [at] the end of December, the money, maybe Al Qaeda was planning to do something in Southeast Asia. Maybe they were planning to do something in Singapore. So that was one option.\n\nThe other option that we thought of, maybe this is leftover money from the attack on The Sullivans, and they are taking it back. But if it’s a leftover money, why does it come from Saudi Arabia, number one? It should be local, right? But more importantly, number two, because maybe Khallad didn’t tell him the truth, so maybe it came from Saudi Arabia or didn’t come from Saudi Arabia. But number two is why is it going to Southeast Asia? If it’s a leftover money, it should go back to Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nThat’s a good question.\n\nSo we didn’t think it’s leftover money from The Sullivans, because The Sullivans didn’t happen until a few days later.\n\nAnd so?\n\nSo we thought that there was definitely something going on in Southeast Asia. Why was Khallad in Southeast Asia? Why was he in Malaysia? Why [did he meet] them in Bangkok? Why [is there] $36,000 being delivered over there? Was there some sort of a meeting going on for two people, the person who later became the suicide bomber, plus the person who was videotaping him blowing himself up, delivering money to a person who was heavily involved in the initial planning and coordination of the Cole attack? Many questions came to our mind.\n\nHowever, the very first logical step we can do is share it with the agency, because overseas is our jurisdiction in so many different ways.\n\nSo you called the CIA.\n\nAbsolutely. And we were working with them very closely, and we had excellent working relationships — well, we thought.\n\nYou had the wall. You had this separation.\n\nYes, but John O’Neill and Hank Crumpton at the time, he was there on the ground, and they figured out a way around it, at least to share information, so we were actually sharing information, working together, and the wall, on the operational level, we didn’t feel it as much when we were working over there.\n\nBefore we go forward, you took this information that Quso told you to John O’Neill right away.\n\nOh, yeah, absolutely.\n\nWhat did John make of it?\n\nWell, let’s ask the agency what’s going on. All the steps were definitely coordinated with our leaders. However, when they didn’t give us an answer, when they said that they did not know, we didn’t have any reason to doubt them.\n\nAnd every time we get more information — for example, first it was only about Bangkok, but then after a lengthy investigation with the phone calls and phone lines and all these things, typical law enforcement police work, we get to a common number that has been in contact with all these numbers around the same time in Malaysia, so now we have Malaysia.\n\nIt’s in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nExactly, and step by step by step by step. And every time we get new information, we used to share it with people who can hopefully help us and shed some light —\n\nWith the CIA.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYou go back to the CIA, and you say, “We’ve got this phone call.”\n\nYeah. We actually talked to them a lot face-to-face, but also we documented it on paper, too.\n\nSo you went back to the CIA. You say: “We’ve got this phone number in Kuala Lumpur. Do you know anything about it?” And they said?\n\nNo.\n\nThey said no. How many times did you go back to them and ask them about it?\n\nWell, we talked about it a lot on the ground, but we have a saying in the bureau. If it’s not on paper, it doesn’t exist. On paper, it’s at least three times.\n\nThree times?\n\nIt’s a teletype that goes from the FBI to the CIA.\n\nDo you learn any more about what had gone on?\n\nNo.\n\nNot until 9/11.\n\nNot until 9/11, yeah. 9/12, actually.\n\nIn June 11 of 2001, Steve Bongardt, who is your co-case agent, has a meeting with the CIA in New York.\n\nIt was with the bureau, with two people from the bureau, one person from the agency, analysts. And we were in Yemen at the time, in June. And the meeting was one of the weirdest meetings until today. We keep thinking about it and shaking our heads.\n\nIt was called by the agency.\n\nActually, it included two FBI analysts and one CIA analyst, and they came over, and they wanted to meet with the Cole team. And definitely Steve was a co-case agent, and he was here. Most of the team was in Yemen. They showed him a photo, and they said, “Do you recognize that person?” We don’t recognize that person. They won’t tell him who the person was. They won’t tell him why they are showing him the photo, where the photo was taken. And it just created a storm, that meeting.\n\nSteve had come all the way from D.C. “You haven’t told me anything. You just showed me a photo, and you say you cannot tell me anything? What is this? Why do you believe that this is connected to the Cole? Who is that person in that photograph? Why are you telling me about him? Why is he significant for my investigation? Why do you think the Cole investigation should be able to identify this guy?” No answers.\n\nThe CIA agents wouldn’t say anything.\n\nThe analysts and the FBI analysts, too, both, because of the wall, or at least they claimed because of the wall.\n\nSo both the CIA analyst and the two FBI analysts who were on the intelligence side of the wall wouldn’t say why they were showing this picture.\n\nBecause if they did, then they would be in violation of their security clearances.\n\nIf I recall correctly, that picture that they showed was a guy that looked a little bit like Quso, but it wasn’t Quso.\n\nSo what do you think they were doing, when you look back?\n\nI have no idea. This is one of the reasons that we keep shaking our head and saying, “What is the significance of that meeting?” And later on, after a lot of debates and fights, they said, “Well, this is a guy,” and they mentioned the name Khalid [al-]Mihdhar to him. But at the time, without putting it in context, Steve had no reason to believe that Khalid al-Mihdhar is connected to the call. “Who is Khalid al-Mihdhar? So why is he connected?” “We cannot tell you anything.”\n\nAnd that continued through a series of e-mails that took place around August, when Steve sent his very powerful e-mail when they were doing immigration announcements that Khalid al-Mihdhar is in the United States. He said: “Do you mean the same Khalid al-Mihdhar that you told us about in June? That’s the same guy? He’s in America? And by the way, why is he connected to the Cole? Why do you believe that?”\n\nThen they said, “Well — ” He said, “If Khalid al-Mihdhar is in the United States, he didn’t come to effing Disneyland.” And he said, “One day people will die and people won’t understand. Wall or no wall, people won’t understand that.” And he was so right and so accurate.\n\nAnd later on, on Sept. 12, we found that the significance about Khalid al-Mihdhar is he was in Bangkok with [hijackler Nawaf] al-Hazmi and Khallad. They traveled with him to come to Bangkok, and days after the money was delivered, they paid [for] first-class tickets and traveled from Bangkok to LAX, and started setting up the operation in San Diego.\n\nSo that’s what the money was for, the $36,000.\n\nMost probably.\n\nHow did you learn this? How did you react?\n\nAfter Sept. 11, nobody slept. We’re in Yemen. We finally get an order to evacuate, and we were at the airport ready to go on a plane when the person from the CIA came and said to me: “Call your headquarters. They want to talk to you.” And we set up a satellite communication outside the terminal and we contacted headquarters. And basically it was [FBI Agent] Dina Corsi on the other line, and she said that Bob McFadden and myself need to stay. Everybody can come back, but we have instructions from the top that we need to stay, and the reason we need to stay is —\n\nBasically, when she said that I was really upset, because in my perspective, something just hit New York and Washington. We have dozens of our colleagues missing. Everybody has families here. The last thing we want to be is in Aden, Yemen. There’s a lot of things happening back home.\n\nIncluding John O’Neill.\n\nExactly. And I said: “America is attacked now. We can do the Cole later.” She said, “No, it’s actually about what just happened here.” I said, “What do you mean what happened here?” And she said, “Well, it’s about Quso is the only lead we have.” And it was kind of like a knife; somebody put a knife in me. I’m like: “Quso? How the heck is Quso involved in what just happened? What did we miss? What did we just miss? We caused this.” So I was sick to my stomach.\n\nI went to Bob, and I told Bob what happened. He’s like: “Quso? What’s the link?” So a couple of other guys volunteered to stay with us, and then we went to the embassy, and I was handed a manila envelope, and I looked at it, and it was just the whole thing.\n\nWho handed you a manila envelope?\n\nThe CIA person on the ground. And it was the same person who asked me about the phone call. And it was all there. They end with the details of what happened, the Malaysia meeting and Bangkok and Khallad, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Hazmi and visas to the United States.\n\nWhat do you see, and what do you read?\n\nFirst of all, we see three surveillance photos, three pictures, three surveillance pictures of people that at the time, people I didn’t recognize.\n\nYou told were told they were taken in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nI was told they were taken in Malaysia, yeah. And still by then, I still did not make a link to the June meeting, by the way. Surveillance photos. But there is one photo of a person who looks like Quso. That made me think maybe there is something here; maybe it’s connected. But it was just like a really small little voice in the back of my mind.\n\nAnd there is a detailed report about the travel of Khalid al-Mihdhar, of Khallad, Malaysia, the alias that he was using in Malaysia, then going to Bangkok.\n\nAnd al-Mihdhar, was a person known to you?\n\nNo, not at the time.\n\nSo all you knew about was?\n\nThat he was with Khallad.\n\nWith Khallad.\n\nKhallad. And these two guys, the airport, what happened. And it was everything that we had been asking for in these three different reports. Now we know why Quso and Nibras delivered the money. There was a big meeting going on over there, and now we know that that meeting, just because of what just happened hours ago in New York and in Washington was for the 9/11 attack.\n\nSo you’re looking at this, and you’re seeing al-Mihdhar with Khallad, maybe with Quso, and you’re told in the report that al-Mihdhar was on Flight 77 that crashed into the Pentagon.\n\nYes.\n\nHow did you realize it?\n\nI basically ran to the bathroom and puked. At the time, remember, we thought there were 50,000 people there. We were missing at least 30 people from the task force. We thought that they were missing, they had probably died. And later on, they basically ran into a building adjacent to the World Trade Center. And we thought that the building collapsed on them, but they thought they’d get stuck in the basement. But they were alive and well.\n\nAnd your former boss, John O’Neill?\n\nMy former boss, John, we could not get a hold of him. It was difficult. It was very difficult.\n\nHow do you learn about John?\n\nFrom the office. They told us. We had a feeling that — when we could not get a hold of him.\n\nYou tried to call him on 9/11?\n\nYeah, many times. And we had a feeling that something probably happened to him. And I think a few days later, they pulled his body.\n\n… Everything we’ve been asking for since November of 2000 regarding that meeting in Malaysia and regarding the money t"
