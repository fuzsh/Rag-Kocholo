The Washington Post described a two-tier system of detention, with some 30 major terrorism suspects being held at high-security prisons operated exclusively by CIA personnel, and an additional 70 less important suspects being transferred to prisons run by other countries intelligence services.53 The major suspects, also known as High Value Targets, were alleged top al-Qaeda leaders, not foot soldiers.54\n\nThe picture emerging from detainee accounts, however, suggests that these numbers are understated, and that the true picture is more complex. For example, at the prison in Afghanistan where Khaled el-Masri was held, the guards were Afghan, but the interrogators, the main director, and the people in charge of prisoner transport appeared to be CIA.55 So while the prisoners had daily contact with Afghan personnel, all of the important decisions regarding detention, treatment, and release were made by Americans.\n\nAnd at the so-called Dark Prison in Afghanistan, which appears to have been operated solely by CIA personnel, there were a substantial number of detainees who were not top terrorism suspects. Human Rights Watch knows of some 20 prisoners previously held at that facility who are currently held at Guantanamo, as well as a former detainee who was released from Guantanamo in 2004.56 The majority of these prisoners (and obviously the one who was released) would not be considered major suspects.\n\nSimilarly, prisoners such as Marwan Jabour and the three Yemeni former detainees interviewed in 2005 by Amnesty International were far from top suspectsthey were eventually released without charge. Yet they too were held in prisons that seemed to have only American staff, as well as the extreme high-security arrangements characteristic of the CIA.\n\nMissing Detainees\n\nThere is no comprehensive accounting of CIA detainees. But based on detainee testimony, press articles, and other sources, Human Rights Watch has put together a list of 16 people whom we believe were once held in CIA prisons and whose current whereabouts are unknown. We have also compiled a separate list of 22 people who were possibly once held in CIA prisons and whose current whereabouts are unknown.57\n\nThe people listed belowby name, nationality, and presumed place and date of arrestare believed to have once been held in secret CIA prisons:\n\nIbn al-Shaykh al-Libi (Libyan) (Pakistan, 11/01)58\n\nMohammed Omar Abdel-Rahman (aka Asadallah) (Egyptian) (Quetta, Pakistan, 2/03)\n\nYassir al-Jazeeri (Algerian) (Lahore, Pakistan, 3/03)\n\nSuleiman Abdalla Salim (Kenyan) (Mogadishu, Somalia, 3/03)\n\nMarwan al-Adeni (Yemeni) (arrested in approximately 5/03)\n\nAli Abd al Rahman al Faqasi al Ghamdi (aka Abu Bakr al Azdi) (Saudi) (Medina, Saudi Arabia, 6/03)\n\nHassan Ghul (Pakistani) (northern Iraq, 1/04)\n\nAyoub al-Libi (Libyan) (Peshawar, Pakistan, 1/04)\n\nMohammed al Afghani (Afghan born in Saudi Arabia) (Peshawar, Pakistan, 5/04)\n\nAbdul Basit (probably Saudi or Yemeni) (arrested before 6/04)\n\nAdnan (arrested before 6/04)\n\nHudeifa (arrested before 6/04)\n\nMohammed Naeem Noor Khan (aka Abu Talaha) (Pakistani) (Lahore, Pakistan, 7/04)\n\nMuhammad Setmarian Naser (Syrian/Spanish) (Quetta, Pakistan, 11/05)\n\nUnnamed Somali (possibly Shoeab as-Somali or Rethwan as-Somali)\n\nUnnamed Somali (possibly Shoeab as-Somali or Rethwan as-Somali)\n\nIn addition, the following people may have once been held in secret CIA prisons:\n\nAbd al-Hadi al-Iraqi (presumably Iraqi) (1/02)\n\nAnas al-Liby (Libyan) (Khartoum, Sudan, 2/02)\n\nRetha al-Tunisi (Tunisian) (Karachi, Pakistan, early- to mid-2002)\n\nSheikh Ahmed Salim (aka Swedan) (Tanzanian) (Kharadar, Pakistan, 7/02)\n\nSaif al Islam el Masry (Egyptian) (Pankisi Gorge, Georgia, 9/02)\n\nAmin al-Yafia (Yemeni) (Iran, 2002)\n\n_ al-Rubaia (Iraqi) (Iran, 2002)\n\nAafia Siddiqui (Pakistani) (Karachi, Pakistan, 3/03)\n\nJawad al-Bashar (Egyptian) (Vindher, Balochistan, Pakistan, 5/03)\n\nSafwan al-Hasham (aka Haffan al-Hasham) (Saudi) (Hyderabad, Pakistan, 5/03)\n\nAbu Naseem (Tunisian) (Peshawar, Pakistan, 6/03)\n\nWalid bin Azmi (unknown nationality) (Karachi, Pakistan, 1/04)\n\nIbad Al Yaquti al Sheikh al Sufiyan (Saudi) (Karachi, Pakistan, 1/04)\n\nAmir Hussein Abdullah al-Misri (aka Fazal Mohammad Abdullah al-Misri) (Egyptian) (Karachi, Pakistan, 1/04)\n\nKhalid al-Zawahiri (Egyptian) (South Waziristan, Pakistan, 2/04)\n\nMusaab Aruchi (aka al-Baluchi) (Pakistani) (Karachi, Pakistan, 6/04)\n\nQari Saifullah Akhtar (Pakistani) (arrested in the UAE, 8/04)\n\nMustafa Mohamed Fadhil (Kenyan/Egyptian) (eastern Punjab, Pakistan, 8/04)\n\nSharif al-Masri (Egyptian) (Pakistan border, 8/04)\n\nOsama Nazir (Pakistani) (Faisalabad, Pakistan, 11/04)\n\nOsama bin Yousaf (Pakistani) (Faisalabad, Pakistan, 8/05)\n\nSpeen Ghul (from Africa) (Pakistan)\n\nThe crucial, unanswered question is: where are all these detainees now? One concern is that the US may have transferred some of them to foreign prisons where for practical purposes they remain under CIA control. Another worrying possibility is that prisoners were transferred from CIA custody to places where they face a serious risk of torture, in violation of the fundamental prohibition on returns to torture. On the latter question, it is worth noting that some of the missing prisoners are from Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Syria, countries where the torture of terrorism suspects is common."
