        "text": "Hollywood\n\nConsidering how well James Mangold – the director/co-writer of “Walk the Line” – knows Johnny Cash’s life and habits, it’s odd that he is tentative about one crucial thing. When the two first met, he’s unsure if the iconic Americana singer saluted him with his trademark, gravelly “Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.”\n\nIt was back in 1999, in Cash’s hometown of Hendersonville, Tenn. Mangold and his wife/producer Cathy Konrad were coming to talk about making a biopic on Cash and his wife, June Carter. The film opened Friday, two years after the deaths of Carter and Cash.\n\n“I remember John picked us up at the Holiday Inn in his diesel Mercedes and came right on into the lobby in his Ugg boots and said hello,” Mangold says. “My wife remembers it as, ‘Hello, I’m Johnny Cash,’ but I remember it as, ‘You must be Cathy; you must be Jim.”‘\n\nAs a result of that difference in recollections, Mangold now second-guesses himself on this.\n\nThe dark-haired, trim-bearded Mangold, 41, laughs about this confusion. He’s dressed in jeans and a red-striped long-sleeve shirt, relaxing before his film opens the American Film Institute Film Festival later in the day.\n\nHe knows he should be sure about something so important to him – and to Cash. After all, his movie makes a point of showing how Cash’s signature salutation derived from his days in mid-1950s Memphis as a door-to-door salesman, when he was still struggling to break into the music business. “I’d ask him, ‘John, what would you say when you came to people’s doors,”‘ Mangold says. “He’d say, ‘Hello, I’m John Cash and I’m here to sell …’ and I’d go, ‘My God, you’d say, ‘Hello, I’m John Cash a hundred times a day.”‘\n\nMangold grew up in New York City and upstate New York as the son of internationally recognized abstract painter Robert Mangold. His world was an artistic and intellectual one, but it turns out Dad was also a Cash fan.\n\n“I discovered Johnny Cash through my dad’s record collection,” Mangold recalls. “My dad really didn’t have that many records, but one was ‘At Folsom Prison.’ I don’t know how old I was, I could have been 6 or 10, but I remember being fascinated by the music and the image on that cover.\n\n“As a kid, the idea of a man singing for a bunch of convicts and hearing them all cheering on record is really gripping.”\n\nDirector’s dream project\n\nThe director has slowly moved up from indies like “Heavy” to Hollywood thrillers like “Identity.” Along the way, he gained enough clout to begin negotiating for rights to his dream project about Cash. It is based on the singer’s two autobiographies. John Carter Cash, his and Carter’s son, is an executive producer. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Cash and\n\nReese Witherspoon as Carter; the two do their own singing.\n\nIt also reveals the tortured and guilt-ridden (but mostly non-sexual) relationship between the already married Cash and twice-divorced Carter from the late 1950s well into the 1960s. Cash already felt guilty about his brother’s accidental death when he was a child; she hailed from an iconic country-music family that stood for traditional values. It was easy for them to doubt themselves.\n\nThis long, anguished phase of their relationship finally ended when, after Carter helped Cash withdraw from drugs, he got divorced from wife Vivian and married Carter in 1968. Well before that, Carter was a featured performer on Cash’s live shows.\n\nTheir duet on “Jackson,” in particular, seemed to imply a romantic connection with its sexy “We got married in a fever/hotter than a pepper sprout” opening line. And as early as 1962, Carter had grappled with her feelings for Cash in “Ring of Fire,” which she co-wrote with Merle Kilgore.\n\nCash and Carter kept the painfully intimate aspects of their private lives secret, even in their autobiographies. (At the time, Cash’s first wife was still alive.)\n\nAs a result, parts of “Walk the Line’ may be shocking for those who know the duo only as the American icons they became after their marriage and following the success of Cash’s “At Folsom Prison” and “At San Quentin” albums and their popular TV variety show.\n\nTryst revealed\n\n“In that first meeting with John and June, I addressed it right off,” Mangold says. “I said I thought they were going to have to go to some places they hadn’t gone in their books.”\n\nThey agreed, but it still was difficult to get them to confess all the details.\n\n“The breakthrough happened on a visit right before June passed, in March or April of that year,” Mangold says. “It was a very wonderful conversation in that John and June both felt the script was missing some of the romance they felt was in their relationship. It was very easy for me to say it’s hard to write a romance about people who don’t admit there was one. It was very clear to them I had a point.\n\n“It wasn’t like I needed them to confess to some huge rendezvous,” he says. “It was really just getting them to talk about an acknowledgment of a feeling that each was wrestling with, so I would not be fictionalizing things to be playing with that tension.”\n\nFinally, the couple told Mangold how their relationship became sexual during a Las Vegas stint in 1965. That becomes a key scene in the movie. “They always intimated something had happened in Vegas – it wasn’t like this was a bomb dropping,” Mangold says. “But now it became very clear what happened. There was this physicality between them, and then June was not comfortable.\n\n“Then John started not showing up for shows or came whacked out. In the end, June had to finish up their contract with Roger Miller headlining – her sister was going out with Roger Miller – because John was incapable of finishing. All this stemmed from this intimacy between them that she then realized was a mistake.”\n\nThroughout it all, Cash made it clear to Mangold that he didn’t think anyone in the film deserved to look bad – except himself. “He didn’t want to hurt anyone,” Mangold says. “The simple way of him saying that was, ‘If someone’s going to look bad, make it me, because I was.”‘\n\nAnd he does look bad at times in “Walk the Line.” (One of Cash’s daughters by his first wife, Kathy, recently told The Associated Press in Nashville that the film also is unfair toward her mother, who died this year.)\n\nBut Mangold believes that, now that Cash is gone, he looks better than just about any country or pop troubadour of his era. “I think John is one of the great storytellers of our time,” he says. “I’m really honored to have known him.”"
