        "text": "Johnny Cash fans listen up! There is a very special exhibit that is showing in Texarkana. It's called '1968: A Folsom Redemption'. This is a great collection of photographs and memories of two journalists that covered behind the scenes of the concerts that Johnny Cash performed at Folsom State Prison.\n\nThrough this exhibit, you'll see the candid and personal photos the journalist took during these historic concerts at the Regional Arts Center right here in Texarkana.\n\nBoth photographer Dan Poush and writer Gene Beley spent time with Johnny Cash, his family and friends (Can you say Merle?) the day before these concerts started. The exhibit will run through January 7, 2023. This exhibit is free.\n\nEven better is that TRAHC will have Gene Beley in Texarkana to present a photography master class and lecture about 1968: A Folsom Prison Redemption. You'll hear his experience, plus photos, and the personal recordings he made on that day back in 1968."
