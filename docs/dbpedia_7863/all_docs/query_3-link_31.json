        "text": "The late John Denver was one of the world’s greatest songwriters. And it’s not just because he was a favorite collaborator with Jim Henson’s Muppets! It’s also for songs like “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” as well as other tracks, like those listed below.\n\nWhile Denver, who passed away in a plane crash in 1997 at the age of 53, wrote some of his hits with other songwriters—some, like “Thank God I’m a Country Boy,” were written by others (John Martin Sommers)—he did write a number of his own tracks solo. Here below, we will dive into four such songs, including one Denver penned for the Muppets.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n[RELATED: The Meaning Behind John Denver’s Iconic Love Song, “Annie’s Song”]\n\n“Annie’s Song”\n\nWritten by John Denver\n\nThis song was released as the lead single off Denver’s 1974 LP Back Home Again. A huge hit for the artist, it became his second No. 1 hit in the U.S. that same year. It also hit the top spot on the UK singles charts. A folk song, Denver explicates his deep feelings and gratitude for the object of his affection. Like an old Irish folk tune, he sings plainly, simply, and beautifully,\n\nYou fill up my senses\n\nLike a night in a forest\n\nLike the mountains in springtime\n\nLike a walk in the rain\n\nLike a storm in the desert\n\nLike a sleepy blue ocean\n\nYou fill up my senses\n\nCome fill me again\n\nCome, let me love you\n\nLet me give my life to you\n\nLet me drown in your laughter\n\nLet me die in your arms\n\nLet me lay down beside you\n\nLet me always be with you\n\nCome, let me love you\n\nCome love me again\n\n“Leaving on a Jet Plane”\n\nWritten by John Denver\n\nSadly, Denver, who was an amateur pilot, died in a plane crash so this track bears with it some tragic irony. That aside, the song has remained part of the cultural zeitgeist for its lyricism and sticky chorus. Originally titled “Babe I Hate to Go” on Denver’s 1966 debut demo John Denver Sings, the title was changed to “Leaving on a Jet Plane” the following year. He recorded the tune again in 1969 for his formal debut LP Rhymes & Reasons, and it has stayed in the minds of music fans ever since, thanks also to many popular covers, including one from Peter, Paul and Mary. On it, Denver sings,\n\nAll my bags are packed\n\nI’m ready to go\n\nI’m standin’ here outside your door\n\nI hate to wake you up to say goodbye\n\nBut the dawn is breakin’\n\nIt’s early morn\n\nThe taxi’s waitin’\n\nHe’s blowin’ his horn\n\nAlready I’m so lonesome\n\nI could die\n\nSo kiss me and smile for me\n\nTell me that you’ll wait for me\n\nHold me like you’ll never let me go\n\n‘Cause I’m leavin’ on a jet plane\n\nDon’t know when I’ll be back again\n\nOh babe, I hate to go\n\n3. “Perhaps Love”\n\nWritten by John Denver\n\nThis John Denver song was recorded with Spanish opera singer Plácido Domingo. It was released on Domingo’s 1981 album of the same name and includes Denver’s vocals. Domingo released it as a single along with a cover of “Annie’s Song” and to date, the song has sold millions of copies, hitting No. 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1982. Epic and romantic, Denver sings on the duet,\n\nPerhaps love is like a window\n\nPerhaps an open door\n\nIt invites you to come closer\n\nIt wants to show you more\n\nAnd even if you lose yourself\n\nAnd don’t know what to do\n\nThe memory of love will see you through\n\n“Alfie, the Christmas Tree”\n\nWritten by John Denver\n\nThis song comes from the 1979 holiday television special John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together and captures on an album of the same name. The song, which includes spoken word from Denver, tells the story of Alfie, the Christmas Tree, but also touches on the true meanings of Christmas, from its religious connections to St. Nick. It’s a solemn but lovely song that features the Muppets singing along. To open the song, Denver speaks,\n\nDid you ever hear the story of the Christmas tree?\n\nWho just didn’t want to change the show\n\nHe liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels\n\nHe liked bicycles and snow\n\nHe liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears\n\nAnd critters and creatures that crawled\n\nWhy bugs were some of his very best friends\n\nSpiders and ants and all\n\nNow that’s not to say that he ever looked down\n\nOn a vision of twinkled lights\n\nOr on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes\n\nAnd a thousand other delights\n\nAnd he often had dreams of tiny reindeer\n\nAnd a jolly old man in a sleigh\n\nFull of toys and presents and wonderful things\n\nAnd a story of Christmas day\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nPhoto by Kathy Keough/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images"
