He said that he wanted to “use music to help create a world that works for everyone”.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nJohn Denver died in a plane crash on October 12, 1997, at the age of 53. He was flying an experimental aircraft, a Rutan Long-EZ, that he had recently purchased. He took off from Monterey Peninsula Airport and crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable cause of the accident was Denver’s inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The plane had an unusual fuel selector valve that was located behind the pilot’s seat and was difficult to reach. Denver also did not have proper training and certification to fly the aircraft.\n\nDenver’s death shocked and saddened his fans and friends around the world. He was widely mourned as a cultural icon of the American West and a beloved entertainer of his era. His music and humanitarian work were celebrated and honored by various tributes and memorials. His ashes were scattered in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, where he felt most at home.\n\nDenver’s legacy lives on through his music, which continues to inspire and touch millions of people. His songs have been covered by many artists, such as Ray Charles, Olivia Newton-John, Plácido Domingo, Dolly Parton and Blake Shelton. His songs have also been featured in many films, TV shows and commercials, such as Logan Lucky, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Alien: Covenant, Okja, Free Fire, Catch Me If You Can and The Wedding Planner. His songs have also been adopted as state songs by Colorado (“Rocky Mountain High”) and West Virginia (“Take Me Home, Country Roads”).\n\nDenver’s legacy also lives on through his environmental and humanitarian causes, which he supported with passion and generosity. His foundation, Plant-It 2020, continues to plant trees around the world to combat climate change and deforestation. His foundation, The Windstar Foundation, continues to promote environmental education and research. His foundation, The Hunger Project, continues to work for the sustainable end of chronic hunger. His foundation, The John Denver Aspenglow Fund, continues to support various charities that Denver cared about, such as The National Wildlife Federation, Save The Children, The Cousteau Society and Friends of The Earth.\n\nDenver once said: “I see more clearly now what I can do about (the Earth’s needs), and I see that it needs doing as I live my life daily reverently. This isn’t the reverence of ‘holier than thou,’ it’s the reverence that says ‘Do thyself no harm for we are all here together.’ Not you or me but you and me.” He also said: “Music does bring people together. It allows us to experience the same emotions. People everywhere are the same in heart and spirit.” These words reflect his vision and mission as a musician and a human being who wanted to make a positive difference in the world.\n\nJohn Denver: December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997\n\nIn conclusion, John Denver was a remarkable musician, actor, humanitarian and environmentalist who left a lasting impact and legacy on the world. His music touched the hearts and souls of millions of people with its uplifting and inspiring messages. His work reflected his love and appreciation for nature, his compassion and empathy for humanity, and his hope and optimism for the future. He was a true cultural icon of the American West and a global citizen who used his talents and resources to create a better world for everyone. As he sang in one of his songs: “All this joy, all this sorrow / All this promise, all this pain / Such is life, such is being / Such is spirit, such is love.”"
