        "text": "This excerpt was taken from an interview with drummer Jerry Carrigan, who also toured with Denver. It’s a great story!!\n\nGritz: Tell me about playing with James Burton.\n\nCarrigan: One time we were out with John Denver. We were going on a long flight from Austin, Texas, to Montreal, Canada. And James Burton got his acoustic guitar out. Everybody else had gone to sleep. And he serenaded me for hours. He played the solo to Ricky Nelson’s “Hello Mary Lou.” I had that record when I was a kid and I wore the grooves out on his solo and I had to buy another record! And he played beautiful stuff and then funky stuff. For hours this went on. Another time with John Denver we were over in Italy. And it was cold as the dickens over there. And we’d play these outdoor concerts in these ruins of old castles and these outdoor amphitheaters. Man, we’d play in winter coats. I looked over one night and there was Glenn D. Hardin playing piano with gloves on but he just had the ends of his fingers cut out. It was freezing cold, man."
