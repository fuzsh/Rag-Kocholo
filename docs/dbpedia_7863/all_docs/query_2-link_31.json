        "text": "To begin, allow me to say that as long as I write Ted Tocks Covers this day will be set aside to pay homage to John Prine.\n\nI suspect that if John Prine fans were asked to submit a list of their favourite Prine pearls of wisdom, or one-line gems, this one would appear on a high volume of submissions.\n\nFor I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve.”\n\nJohn Prine\n\nJust typing it here, cracks me up and I bet I have heard ‘Spanish Pipedream’ a thousand times. I could be wrong but I am pretty sure it was part of his setlist every time I saw him live. John Prine had a way of introducing his songs like they were an old friend. In this case, no introduction was necessary. As the old saying goes; the reputation preceded the song.\n\nBefore we move on, if you feel nostalgic, send me your favourite John Prine lines in the comments.\n\nOver 50 years ago, when John wrote this memorable piece about a rather unlikely couple who gave up everything to head to a life in the country, it was a case of necessity is the mother of invention.\n\nFamously, he had taken to the stage of a Chicago folk club called The Fifth Peg. Over time, his stage debut exists somewhere between a dare and a suggestion that he put his money where his mouth was. It seems, after a few beers he may have critiqued previous performers just a little too loudly. In his first ever live performance he played ‘Sam Stone’, ‘Hello in There’ and ‘Paradise’.\n\nHere, John Prine remembers the evening that may have changed his life.\n\nI sang those three songs and people just sat there and looked at me. I thought, ‘Wow, those are really bad.’ They wouldn’t even applaud.”\n\nJohn Prine\n\nTruth be told, the response was so positive, the owner of the club hired him, basically on the spot. Word began to spread and it was mostly positive. A rave review by Chicago Sun-Times entertainment reporter Roger Ebert inspired a wider audience. A musical collaboration and eternal friendship with Steve Goodman led to his writing more material. In time people like Kris Kristofferson, Jerry Wexler and even Bob Dylan sang his praises. Prine understood that he couldn’t play the same handful of songs every night. Gradually his repertoire expanded and every song was packed with wisdom in rhyming couplets.\n\nThis is how John Prine recalls the purpose ‘Spanish Pipedream’ served in his early days. Note the self-deprecation.\n\nI wrote this when I started performing. I thought the first song of the show should be up and bouncy. I can only play two rhythms—fast and slow—so this was written to go with my fast bouncy rhythm.”\n\nJohn Prine\n\nSomehow, every memory he offers begins with trademark humility. This is perhaps his most endearing quality. Over the years, countless friends have discussed their memories of John, and expressed the fact that it is 100% genuine.\n\nTo many, he is in fact the ‘singing mailman’. He never forgot where he came from and as a result, many of his stories begin with recollections of writing song passages in his head while walking this route.\n\nOriginally, the chorus wasn’t about blowing up your TV. It was something about the girls forgetting to take the pill, but sunk pretty low after that first great verse. I sounded like Loretta Lynn singing about ‘the pill.’ Then I got the line ‘blow up your TV.’ I used to keep a small bowl of real fine pebbles that I picked up on my mail route, and if somebody said something really stupid on TV I’d throw some at the screen.”\n\nJohn Prine\n\nMan! If he was around today, he would be launching boulders.\n\nBetween mailboxes, this is the set of lyrics that tells the story, with a combination of humour and social purpose.\n\n“She was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol\n\nAnd I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal\n\nWell she pressed her chest against me\n\nAbout the time the juke box broke\n\nYeah, she gave me a peck on the back of the neck\n\nAnd these are the words she spoke\n\nBlow up your TV throw away your paper\n\nGo to the country, build you a home\n\nPlant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches\n\nTry and find Jesus on your own\n\nWell, I sat there at the table and I acted real naive\n\nFor I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve\n\nWell, she danced around the bar room and she did the hoochy-coo\n\nYeah she sang her song all night long, tellin’ me what to do\n\nWell, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place\n\nWhen just as I was leavin’, well she looked me in the face\n\nI said “You must know the answer.”\n\n“She said, “No but I’ll give it a try.”\n\nAnd to this very day we’ve been livin’ our way\n\nAnd here is the reason why\n\nWe blew up our TV threw away our paper\n\nWent to the country, built us a home\n\nHad a lot of children, fed ’em on peaches\n\nThey all found Jesus on their own”\n\nJohn Prine\n\nIt’s as bouncy and positive as the day he wrote it. Within these lines every listener wishes they could follow the path of this naïve soldier and the ‘topless lady’ who knew the answer, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nTo this day, we are all singing along. Many of us wish we could do the same.\n\nAs I said, through the years ‘Spanish Pipedream’ was always close at hand when John Prine was playing for his adoring audience. Here he is live at Sony Music Studios on West 54th in Manhattan. This is from January 30, 2000.\n\nTen years later, John Prine released ‘In Person and On Stage’ on his label, Oh Boy Records’. It represented a snapshot of the live set he often performed over the previous decade.\n\nIn many ways this period of time was a personal triumph for Prine who had battled squamous-cell cancer on his neck. A 1998 surgery removed a significant portion of tissue. This procedure was followed by six weeks of radiation therapy. A side effect of this process resulted in some nerve damage on his tongue and salivary glands. With a ton of support from his wife, Fiona, family and friends, he convalesced while participating in speech therapy. Eventually he was ready to perform again. The product of this series of circumstances was a lower voice and what has been described as a ‘gravelly’ delivery.\n\nTo his fans, it symbolized resilience and made him even more lovable.\n\nThe love remains. In fact, an argument could be made that he has never been more popular.\n\nOnce word spread about John Prine, and his thought-provoking lyrics, it wasn’t long before his peers began to add his songs to their recordings. This was the case when John Denver added ‘Blow Up Your TV’ to his 1971 album ‘Aerie’.\n\nIt is no secret that John Prine loved Johnny Cash. The feeling was mutual. Cash famously recorded ‘Sam Stone’ even though he struggled with the line “Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose.” Here, Johnny and June perform ‘Spanish Pipedream’ in 1978. This serves nicely as a companion piece to ‘Jackson’.\n\nIn 2010, Oh Boy Records created a compilation album called ‘Songs of John Prine’. Here are The Avett Brothers performing their country-folk interpretation of ‘Spanish Pipedream’. This is awesome. It’s like they are performing from the very garden that the couple planted as soon as they found their home.\n\nHere is another fun version performed as a tribute to John Prine, in May of 2020. This is the Hogslop String Band. This is straight from the heart. A combination of John Prine adulation and bluegrass. Eat a peach and enjoy.\n\nThrough it all, John Prine always managed to look upon his success with a sort of ‘Aw Shucks’ attitude. He presents as an accidental legend.\n\nI guess I always loved to write, but I never had anything to really encourage it. I never thought I could be a journalist or novelist or anything, I just had a wild imagination and song-writing gave me enough rope to run with it.”\n\nJohn Prine\n\nSomehow, this makes him all the more likeable. This is why he is revered by so many.\n\nAs one goes through the John Prine catalogue they will discover an array of characters in his songs. These are people you would root for. The people he sings about could be subjects of a movie, TV show or novel. Often, they appear as sympathetic characters. They are flawed, but not beyond help. Within the context of his writing, you get the sense that as a society, if we work together, we can lift anyone, and ultimately the world becomes a better place.\n\nIn interviews, Prine frequently spoke to aspects of the human condition. He frequently alluded to accepting our vulnerability as individuals. When we can set ego aside, we open the door to a degree of empathy and compassion. It is here that we truly see others for who they are. This goal is made all the more possible if we cast any distractions aside. Is this what John was suggesting when he wrote this chorus?\n\nBlow up your TV throw away your paper\n\nGo to the country, build you a home\n\nPlant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches\n\nTry and find Jesus on your own”\n\nJohn Prine\n\nOne thing is for sure. With John Prine, everything just seems to come a little bit more into focus.\n\nIt all comes back to a sense of humility. Here is one example of the kind of person he was. He had this perfect combination of being both unassuming and wise all at the same time. I heard this in an interview with Todd Snider, conducted by Otis Gibbs.\n\nJohn, and his band, that included Dave Jacques and Jason Wilbur, along with Todd Snider who was invited to be his opening act had arrived in Europe. They got off the plane and gathered their stuff. They were greeted by a cocky guy in his mid 20s who was assigned to take the entourage to the first gig on their tour schedule. Without a thought everyone got in the van and they headed off. As Snider recalls, Prine sat in the front seat and began to read a newspaper. A short time later, he casually suggested that the driver may be heading in the wrong direction. Their chauffeur assured John that all was fine, so he just went back to reading the paper. About an hour into the trip, the young driver exclaimed that he had indeed gone the wrong way, and tail between his legs, turned the van around and aimed to rectify his mistake. Now, according to Todd Snider the entire van was fuming, but they took their cue from John. Nothing was really said. They were going to get to the show and that was all that mattered. Was this a problem? Probably. Could it be fixed. Yep. So, let’s just keep things in perspective. In the interview, Snider summarized everything like this.\n\nYou just can’t knock this guy off his square. But, the more I thought about it, it’s deeper than that. He doesn’t have a square. It’s hard to describe him, because he is a very special, touched by lightning type of person. I learned in the first few weeks that no one is like him. I mean he didn’t even look up from his paper…That’s just who he is.”\n\nTodd Snider\n\nThere is a lesson in here. Ironically, in this moment he just took momentary refuge in the content of all things; a newspaper.\n\nIt has been three years since John Prine left us. It still hurts to type this, but in that time the love has poured from the hearts and souls of his many fans.\n\nIf you take a look at his many fan pages you see numerous posts from people who discovered him as a result of the many stories that have been shared after he died. As sad as all of this is, there is a degree of solace.\n\nJohn Prine’s music will live on for generations to come, because it is about much more than the music.\n\nParables have a tendency to bridge generations because they exist as life lessons. It is in this sphere, that the message in so many of John’s songs reside.\n\nThis will remain his gift to us all."
