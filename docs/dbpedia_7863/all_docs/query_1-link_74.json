        "text": "My grandfather, Jim Baum, at his radio station in Colorado City, Texas\n\nCountry music is in my blood. George Strait was the soundtrack to the backseat of my mom’s 1999 Sienna minivan. My uncle played drums for Trace Adkins early in his career. In tiny Colorado City, Texas, my grandpa pulled double duty as the mayor and the owner of the local country music station.\n\nNaturally, I had to rebel.\n\nGrowing up in the Southwest in the early ’00s, you could select one of two personas: country queen or tortured alternative artist. As a self-proclaimed intellectual, I gravitated towards the thinkers’ bands of the day (Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, and Good Charlotte). When asked what type of music I liked, I’d respond, “Anything but country.”\n\nIn my mind, I was turning my back on bro music. I was making a stand against beer-drinkin’, boot-wearin’, women-objectifyin’ men named Rhett and Hunter. My disregard for country was a political statement (and, in retrospect, an ill-conceived way to annoy my mom).\n\nMy contempt for country followed me through my college and grad school years in Texas. During this period, 82% of social events took place at venues with apt names like “Dixie Chicken” and “Rebel Drafthouse.” I had to adapt to survive: I learned to two-step, drink Shiner, and sing “Friends in Low Places” with aplomb. Nevertheless, I stayed the alternative course.\n\nAnd then, when I moved to Tennessee, I met Dolly Parton.\n\nWell, I didn’t actually meet Dolly Parton. I listened to a Radiolab podcast called Dolly Parton’s America and fell in love with her sense of humor, big heart, and touching lyrics. This was a woman who’d grown up poor in the Smoky Mountains who blossomed into an icon with an incredible catalogue of songs and an equally amazing catalogue of wigs. For a solid month, my Spotify account was a shrine to Dolly. Whenever I listened to her music, I felt like a plucky upstart from East Tennessee on her way to change Nashville forver.\n\nHowever, as quickly as I fell in love with Dolly, I started to discover (and in some cases, revisit) other country artists: Kacey Musgraves. Loretta Lynn. The Chicks. I loved the songs that told stories about erstwhile relationships and memories from childhood. Eventually, songs from these artists began to punctuate memories from my own life. Kacey Musgraves’s “Butterflies” reminded me of flying down Mississippi roads with my partner. Brooks and Dunn’s “Neon Moon” embodied the nights I spent laughing and two-stepping with friends in college. And, more than anything, Tanya Tucker’s “Lizzie and the Rainman” reminded me of my grandfather’s radio station.\n\nTanya Tucker is a hardscrabble, hard-drinking, hard-smoking singer-songwriter from West Texas. In other words, she could easily be a member of my extended family. Apparently, my grandfather felt similarly. Tucker’s “Lizzie and the Rainman” was a constant presence on his radio station in Colorado City. During many road trips through West Texas, we’d often pass through the rang of PaPa’s station. I remember the anticipation of waiting to hear his voice crackle through the radio station: “Hi, this is Jim Baum, the voice of Mitchell County. You’re listening to KAUM Real Country!” On the days we were lucky, he’d blast “Lizzie and the Rainman.”\n\nPaPa passed away in 2018, but his radio station remains as a testament to his love of country music. For my family, “Lizzie and the Rainman” is a personal reminder of his passion for music and our roots in West Texas. On a broader scale, I think this kind of nostalgia is what makes country music special. A great country song allows you to live an alternate life (if only for four minutes) through its visceral storytelling. At the same time, an excellent country song conjures up memories from your own life. It’s a genre that feels both limitless and intimate.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I have to own my identity: I am a West Texas girl who likes country. You’ll need to buy me a couple of Shiners before I’ll admit to listening to “She Thinks My Tractor’s Sexy,” though."
