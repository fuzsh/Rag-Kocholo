        "text": "A question I’ve been hearing a lot lately is, “When did you start liking country music?”\n\nThat’s kind of a funny question to me, since it’s the first music I remember liking and knowing as a child. I grew up on Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, even Olivia Newton-John. (She was country first, you know!) The first albums I had were Loretta Lynn and John Denver, just for starters. I had an AM radio in my first car in college and it only got the country station. I didn’t care. Bellamy Brothers, Gatlin Brothers, George Strait, George Jones, Willie Nelson, the Hanks. And so on. CMT was my study music during graduate school. The point I’m making is that I probably started liking country music in the womb.\n\nMore to the point is that all my very favorite music (in any genre) is made by singer/songwriters. I know that not everyone in the industry writes their own songs or even has a desire to. However, there’s something about a storyteller. Someone who can put not only words but emotions on a page and on the air and in my brain and my heart.\n\nIf you can do that, you’re golden. You’re probably one of my favorites. You might be Def Leppard. Or Mumford and Sons. You might even be Kip Moore…\n\nIn which case you’d be a freaking GENIUS. Because that man can WRITE. And he can SING. And he leaves me crying in the aisles every time just listening to his albums, so imagine, if you will, what the scene will be when I’m front row at a concert in a couple weeks. I imagine that every day.\n\nAnd then there’s this song. My favorite song. Running For You.\n\nI am stating, for the record and you can quote me, that this song is a number one, multiplatinum blockbuster that’s going to launch Kip into the stratosphere. And it’s in writing, so I’ve got proof. Damn right, I said it!\n\nI remember when I heard it the first time—a teaser before the album release. I clicked on it at work, during lunch, as casually as all that. The Earth stopped turning. Gravity ceased to exist. My head might have blown right off my shoulders; I’m not sure. I was fixated on the computer and the rest of the world disappeared.\n\nGod, it’s gorgeous. Just ridiculous in its intensity and perfection. Texture upon layer upon emotional firestorm. Not a dry eye (or pair of underwear) in the house, I guarantee.\n\nThis is true: NOTHING IS SEXIER THAN UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. Not even Kip’s arms—and that’s saying something. (Seriously. No, SERIOUSLY.) And it’s all wound up in six words that have literally become my motto, inspiration and reason for going forward on the toughest of days:\n\nGo girl, Go girl, GO ON!\n\nHell, who wouldn’t want to hear that? What girl wouldn’t give her all and her eye teeth and her heart and soul for that kind of love and support? There are a lot of sexy songs on both of Kip’s albums, but let me tell you right here—this is the one. You want to melt my heart and knock down these walls and pretty much take me wherever you want to go, this is what you sing. This song, right here:"
