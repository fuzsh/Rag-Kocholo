        "text": "There was a short period of time starting on May 21, 1966 when many people in a folk music organization called The Queen City Balladeers were able to be around The Mitchell Trio, Denver Boise & Johnson, John Denver, and Michael Johnson for more than just concerts. It was the mutual love of folk music that enabled this remarkable time. The Queen City Balladeers are a Cincinnati, Ohio group of folk musicians who have been promoting the music and singing for over 40 years.\n\nSeveral years before he was well known, we knew John Denver as a wonderfully talented singer and guitar player who was very willing to spend hours with us, singing and playing. We came to know the other members of the group also and had many after-concert picking parties with all of them. We were in awe of Paul Prestopino and his multiple talents, we loved Michael Johnsonâs voice and guitar playing, we marveled over Bob Hefferanâs superb French Jazz and we enjoyed the humor and talent of David Boise. But on top of it all were the songs. It was their fantastic songs that made me want to tape their concerts and parties. Admittedly, a selfish part of wanting to tape them was to learn the songs for ourselves. When I looked at the set lists of John Denver, Denver Boise & Johnson and Michael Johnson recently, I was amazed at the number of their songs we learned for our own folk groups. The Denison tape was made by a friend of mine who was there; the tape from the Bistro Inn is not as good quality as the others, but Iâm just glad it was still ok. Iâve added, after the fact, recordings kindly sent to me by several JD enthusiasts and collectors. This includes the Philadelphia Folk Festival from 1968.\n\nThere was an unspoken trust between the Balladeers and John Denver where he knew that we would never do anything with these recordings. I only used these tapes to learn the songs, and for almost 40 years Iâve dragged these old tapes of mine from house to house. The last concerts of Denver, Boise & Johnson were mailed by John Denver to me and two other Balladeers in Cincinnati on reel-to-reel tape. The tape was a compilation of what John thought were the best songs from their last two concerts. We didnât ask him to do that, he just did it as a gesture to fellow folk musicians and friends. He knew how much we loved their music. (Michael Johnson also had a copy in his possession which he gave to me shortly before his passing.)\n\nMany of these songs have never been recorded on albums and Denver, Boise & Johnson never made a commercial album. What you hear on this web site is how they were and what they did in 1968 and 1969. This material is John Denver in his pre-Far Out days, and in the pre-âBluer Than Blueâ days of Michael Johnson.\n\nI hope you enjoy these songs as much as I do. If you have any questions about this treasure trove, email me at JohnMarlowe@CincinnatiDancingPigs.com.\n\nJohn Marlowe\n\nApril 1, 2007, revised slightly January 8, 2016, edited by Cindy McArthur, May 2022\n\nP.S. A CD was released of The Mitchell Trio and Denver, Boise and Johnson material in 2018. Details and the DB&J songs can be found at https://www.mjblue.com/dbjcd.html.\n\nWith Paul Prestopino and Bob Hefferan\n\n(Courtesy of Bob Hefferan)\n\nU of Minnesota & Graceland Univ - November 18/22, 1968\n\nSet 1\n\nThat's The Way It's Gonna Be\n\nDraft Dodger Rag\n\nWe Didn't Know\n\nTake Me To Tomorrow\n\nBoth Sides Now\n\nSaturday Night In Toledo Ohio\n\nCoal Tattoo\n\nWhen I'm 64\n\nMr Bojangles\n\nBells Of Rhymney\n\nOld Folks\n\nYou Done Stomped On My Heart\n\nLeaving On A Jet Plane\n\nLove Of The Common People\n\nSet 2\n\nGood To Be With You\n\nJohn Birch Society\n\nCircus\n\nVictoria Dines Alone\n\nYou Sure Have Got a Pretty Nice Bod\n\nFlint Hill Special\n\nEighth of January-Hop High Ladies Medley\n\nYellow Cat\n\nThe '68 Nixon (This Year's Model)\n\nTurning Point/Blowin' In The Wind Medley\n\nI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free\n\nSet 1\n\nThat's The Way It's Gonna Be (Bob Gibson & Phil Ochs)\n\nThis was on the first Mitchell Trio album, with John as the new replacement for Chad Mitchell. Back in the 60âs everyone did a Phil Ochs song or two. See a video of DB&J doing this song exactly as they did it on this cut on Michael Johnsonâs YouTube channel at the Bitter End, NYC.\n\nThe Draft Dodger Rag (Phil Ochs)\n\nThe Draft was traumatic in those days, especially to those who had to go to Vietnam because of it. I remember going in for the physical because I had temporarily lost my student deferment (â2Sâ, if I recall) and I remember seeing many of my peers doing their bit to avoid the draft, such as acting feminine, or taking a mix of drugs the day of the physical, or like me, pointing out that I had flat feet, at which the Draft Board guy sneered and then promptly passed me on to the next station. I was sure that my flat feet would be good for a physical deferment. Others joined the Reserves to avoid Vietnam, and I remember one friend being ecstatic over getting into a Post Office Unit of the Reserves. I also had a pharmacy student friend who swore he knew the mix of drugs to take that would guarantee a rejection at the physical. Phil Ochs was extremely right on with this song and his verses reflect how it really was. I was one of the lucky ones who eventually got a good number in the Draft Lottery, but some of my friends were not so lucky and were drafted and shipped off to Vietnam. This song was originally done by The Chad Mitchell Trio.\n\nWe Didn't Know (Tom Paxton)\n\nTake Me To Tomorrow (John Denver)\n\nThis song was done by the group on their only official recording, on the A side of a 45 that also included âThe 68 Nixonâ.\n\nBoth Sides Now (Joni Mitchell)\n\nThis is one of the most beautiful versions of this many times recorded song. Michael Johnsonâs lead singing on it is superb, the harmonies are great and Johnâs harmony is almost ethereal. Johnâs 12 string background picking made it even better. This song is a good representation of Paul Prestopino playing his Martin D-28 as a bass guitar. Paul may have started doing this because there were too many guitars in the group with Michael Johnsonâs addition. Want to see them on video doing the song exactly as on this recording? See below.\n\nSaturday Night in Toledo Ohio (Randy Sparks)\n\nThis song has a fascinating history. Randy Sparks, founder of The New Christy Minstrels, wrote the song. Michael Johnson was part of a Randy Sparks folk group and learned the song from Randy and George Blackwell while Michael was touring in Saigon, Vietnam with Randy. John Denver was originally part of Randy Sparksâ organization too. Michael brought the song to Denver, Boise & Johnson and John Denver subsequently made the song famous on his concert album after the group broke up. This was one of several Michael Johnson originated songs that John did after the trio breakup.\n\nAnd, I donât believe there are many people in the world who know these extra verses to the song, written by Randy. Here they are, and sing them in your mindâ¦.they fit, they were just not chosen by Michael Johnson and John Denver to be part of the song, for whatever reason, but probably because these verses made it too long:\n\nThere once was a ship that went down on Lake Erie\n\nNot far from Toledo one day\n\nI met one poor sailor who'd floated to town\n\nHe told me quite frankly he'd rather have drowned\n\nSo you bring the flowers and I'll give the eulogy\n\nWe'll, once and for all, do it right\n\nWe'll all shed a tear for Toledo, Ohio\n\nIt dies every Saturday Night\n\nCompared to the splendor of lovely Toledo\n\nGreat standards of beauty grow pale\n\nThe voice of Caruso emerges a grunt\n\nElizabeth Taylor become Allen Funt\n\n(Michael's demo of this song with the extra verses can be found at https://youtu.be/RdEwTlLB4zQ, early 70's)\n\nCoal Tattoo (Billy Ed Wheeler)\n\nDavid Boise is playing guitar on this song besides doing the lead. David also played guitar when Paul Prestopino was doing his Bluegrass banjo solos as part of their act. As far as we know, the Kingston Trio made this song famous and DB&J performing it was indicative of the fact that they were all âfolk singersâ in this era. I suspect that David Boise brought the song to the group. Not much has been heard about David Boise in years, except that he is still performing and playing bass in a C&W group. David apparently spent some time after the DB&J breakup, playing backup for Liza Minnelli. The Cincinnati Dancing Pigs do another Billy Ed Wheeler song called âLittle Brown Buildingâ and have met this fine singer and songwriter who has supplied a lot of hit records for other people. He wrote âHigh Flying Birdâ which Judy Henske made famous for instance, among many, many others. Heâs still performing. Some other songs he wrote are âThe Coming Of The Roadsâ, âThe Rev. Mr. Blackâ, and âJacksonâ. (Michael performed \"Coal Tattoo\" solo as late as 1978. Judy Collins also recorded this.)\n\nWhen I'm 64 (Lennon & McCartney)\n\nMr. Bojangles (Jerry Jeff Walker)\n\nDavid Boise keeps the guitar on after âCoal Tattooâ for this song and is doing the initial lead 6 string steel guitar picking on it. Johnâs 12-string is heard in the background and Michael Johnson can be heard doing very nice picking also. It sounds like Paul Prestopino is doing muted banjo on the song. (Hear Michael perform this solo at https://youtu.be/VwlTjEtdbW, 1968.)\n\nBells of Rhymney (Pete Seeger, based on a poem by Idris Davies)\n\nThis became Johnâs signature song as a great 12 string guitar player and singer. It was included on the first Mitchell Trio album. John mentioned in his autobiography that he learned it from Mike Crowley of the âBack Porch Majorityâ out in California when John was with the Randy Sparks organization. David Boiseâs job was saying funny things about the 12 string when John was having trouble tuning it, which happened a lot. John started telling these jokes, too, when he went solo, with things like âThe only difference between a 6 string guitar and a 12 string guitar, is an additional 6 stringsâ, or âThe 12 string guitar was invented in the late 18th century by The Marquis De Sadeâ. Or, âIn order to tune a 12 string guitar, you find the string out of tune and tune the other 11 to that one.â The Wise Owl and Denison concerts had long stretches of Johnâs 12 string guitar tuning. Certainly John Denver inspired many, many guitar players with this song.\n\nThis song was based on a poem by Welsh coal miner, Idris Davies, who was inspired by the hardships of himself and other miners. The poem was in Idris Daviesâ 1938 book, Gwalia Deserta, and Pete Seeger found it in a book by Dylan Thomas in a chapter called âWelsh Poetry in the English Languageâ. Further reading; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_of_Rhymney\n\nOld Folks (Jacque Brel, translation: Gerard Jouannest, Jean Cori, Eric Blau & Mort Schuman)\n\nAfter the trio's breakup, John recorded this song on his third album and Michael on his first, âThere Is A Breezeâ. Thereâs a very interesting interview with Michael Johnson regarding his love of Jacque Brel songs and his performing in the play after the breakup of DB&J. Apparently Michael had gone to see the show with John and was very impressed, so much that he auditioned for the show and was in it for a year after leaving DB&J. The interview is at http://www.mjblue.com/bmanof.html.\n\nYou Done Stomped on My Heart (Mason Williams)\n\nSee notes from Denison and Wise Owl concerts above. Iâve included on the website, two short party versions of this song, where the guys didnât quite know the song yet.\n\nLeaving on a Jet Plane (John Denver)\n\nIntro by Michael. Michael had as much respect for Johnâs songwriting as John had for Michaelâs talent. The Queen City Balladeers were thrilled to have known this song by heart before it became famous through Peter, Paul and Mary. This brings to mind that we became aware of John Denver as âour kind of folksingerâ because of hearing Peter, Paul and Mary do âFor Babyâ a few weeks prior to seeing the Mitchell Trio and John for the first time at the University of Cincinnati. When the song was introduced as âFor Bobbiâ and that it was written by John Denver, it was like a light bulb going off. Itâs another John Denver song that we had to learn and did.\n\nPaul Prestopino is once again playing bass on this song and using his nice old mellow Martin D-28.\n\nLove of the Common People (Ronnie Wilkins & John Hurley)\n\nThis song was recorded on Johnâs first commercial album, âRhymes and Reasonsâ. Michael Johnson does the lead on this song and it was a good set closer, intense and driving. I think it was Waylon Jenningsâs version that made this song known. (Michael's demo of this song can be heard at https://youtu.be/XT5Sc-vYwCc.)\n\nMarch 7, 1968 concert held at the Memorial Student Center, Graceland College, Lamoni, IA.\n\nCopyright Graceland University.\n\nSet 2\n\nGood to Be With You (Eric Andersen)\n\nEric Andersen was a much emulated songwriter of that time and the Mitchell Trio did several of his songs, âViolets of Dawnâ being another one. This song is from Ericâs âAvalancheâ album. (Good to Be With You was a MJ concert song through the late 70's and his 60's demo can be heard at https://youtu.be/CcrE78PaQ5A.)\n\nJohn Birch Society (Michael Brown)\n\nThis was a Chad Mitchell Trio song originally and made the group well known as daring and political. Note the lyrics changes in the song, some to keep it topical, and some that were personal. I think the group changed this song with every city they played in. Instead of âWestbrook Peglerâ they say âSpiro Agnewâ and John says âWell, GAC has agents that are flatly unashamedâ, which I think refers to a booking agency that DB&J had problems with. Instead of âNorman Vincent Pealeâ, itâs âDr. Spockâ. And they say âAnd even old Eagleville is full of Bolsheviksâ, referring to Eagleville, Iowa where they were playing. Michael Johnson says âDo you want President Higgins to be your commissar?â, and I suspect Higgins was the president of the college then. Instead of âDo you want Mrs. Krushchev in there with the DARâ, itâs âDo you want Mrs. Brezhnev in there with the DAR?â\n\nMy friend Ken Loar reminded me recently that when he produced the Miami University DB&J show, Johnâs mother was there from the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. Ken mentioned that the group did the line from the âThe John Birch Societyâ, âIf your mommy is a commie then you gotta turn her inâ for her after Ken introduced her to the audience. I seem to remember a nice laugh at that.\n\nCircus (Michael Johnson, John Denver and Laurie Kuehn)\n\nItâs possible this is really mostly a Michael Johnson & Laurie Kuehn song and that John Denver contributed little on it. The Kuehnâs may have been a family that Michael Johnson was close to. This is a quote from Mike Johnson (as he called himself in the late 60âs) in a Wise Owl concert in 1970 about the song, where he says: âI would say that half of this song was instigated by a 13 year old girlâ¦.. she had the ideas for the songâ. John played âCircusâ with a classical guitar at his initial solo concerts, ala Michael Johnson. He recorded this DB&J song on âRhymes and Reasonsâ, his first commercial album. But this version is the original way it was written to be sung, with Michael Johnson doing lead and John Denver doing harmony.\n\nVictoria Dines Alone (Tom Paxton)\n\nThere was a somewhat long intro to the song in concert, with John telling a story of a lonely looking girl he saw somewhere.\n\nYou Sure Have Got a Pretty Nice Bod (Michael Peter Smith)\n\nThis song was written by well-known Chicago songwriter Michael Peter Smith. Michael Johnson brought this song and so many other good songs to Denver, Boise & Johnson. Not included in the website yet is Michael Johnsonâs DB&J version of Michael Smithâs âWonderful World of Sexâ. The Cincinnati Dancing Pigs have been doing âThe Bod Songâ, as we call this song, since the DB&J days. It was written in 1966 and was one of Michael Smithâs first songs. Part of the Cincinnati Dancing Pigâs âschtickâ with this song, is bringing up one of the buxom/beautiful girls from the audience and singing it to her. There have been hundreds of âBod Girlsâ since the group started doing this song, most of whom have enjoyed it, but some of whom have been mortified by the attention and/or the words.\n\nPaul Prestopino solos:\n\nFlint Hill Special (with David Boise on guitar)\n\nEighth of January/Hop High Ladies\n\nWhat can you say about Paul Prestopino? Not enough, certainly. Heâs the ultimate finger picker, flat picker, bluegrass and frailing style banjo player, mandolin player, dobro player, bass player, autoharp and harmonica player, sound engineer, machine designer and nice guy. He played with the original Chad Mitchell Trio for years before John Denver joined the group. In a prior life, Paul played mandolin in the bluegrass group The Greenbriar Boys with the great John Herald and Bob Yellin. Most recently, Paul Prestopino was the accompanist for Peter, Paul and Mary and the Chad Mitchell Trio reunion. These two songs showcase his talents which John and Michael and David appreciated a lot. At one after-concert party, Paul and Bob Hefferan put on a display of guitar wizardly by playing âSweet Sueâ on the same guitar, impressing all of us. Michael Johnsonâs thoughts about Paul were that he was this very professional musician and the rest of them were just young dopes. Paul taught the Queen City Balladeers that you could save money by washing your guitar strings with steel wool, which brightened them up again and let you play them for a little bit longer. It was a wonderful tip for folk musicians who couldnât afford new strings all the time, though itâs been years since Iâve done that.\n\nYellow Cat (Steve Fromholz)\n\nThis was another song Michael Johnson brought to the group. On a party tape I recorded, John Denver can be heard saying âThis is one of the greatest songs youâll ever hearâ. The words seem a little rearranged from the Steve Fromholz original. John recorded this song on his first album, âRhymes and Reasonsâ. This song was also done by John on the Nowhere Coffeehouse tape, and I know JD purists will want to shoot me over this, but his solo version is truly awful in my humble opinion, and especially on the Rhymes and Reasons album, when compared to the way Michael Johnson did it with DB&J. (Hear Michael's solo version at https://youtu.be/bWE7XFxahhM)\n\nOne interesting piece of information is that Steven Fromholz was named âPoet Laureate of Texasâ on April 19, 2007.\n\nThe â68 Nixon (This Yearâs Model) (June Reizner, aka Bernie Cross)\n\nThis was on the only commercial recording released by Denver, Boise & Johnson and it was the B side on DB&J's 45 of âTake Me To Tomorrow.â\n\nTurning Point/Blowin' in the Wind medley (Martha Holmes/Bob Dylan)\n\nItâs a guess that the trio got this song from Nina Simon, who apparently called it âTurning Pointâ, as opposed to âLittle Brown Girlâ, or âMom Can She Come Overâ. Thanks to Roger Ooms for the research on this song. It makes sense that the song came from Nina Simone, since the next song was done by her too.\n\nI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free (Billy Taylor & Dick Dallas)\n\nThis song was one of the best that DB&J did and one of the Queen City Balladeers favorite John Denver, Michael Johnson, David Boise and Paul Prestopino songs. See below for their video. This is also another good demonstration of Paul Prestopino playing bass backup on his old Martin D-28. This is yet another DB&J song that John recorded on âRhymes and Reasonsâ.\n\nBistro Inn - Columbus, Ohio, summer of 1968\n\nIntroduction by The Bistro\n\nThat's the Way It's Gonna Be\n\nWhat This Country Really Needs Is Another Movie Star\n\nWe Didn't Know\n\nTake Me to Tomorrow\n\nSaturday Night in Toledo, Ohio\n\nRed Velvet\n\nI Like To Deal With The Ladies\n\nFlint Hill Special â Paul Prestopino\n\nEverybody's Talking\n\nBoth Sides Now\n\nLove Of The Common People\n\nI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free\n\nIf You Had Me In Shackles (partial)\n\nJohn Birch Society\n\nFor Bobbi\n\nYou Sure Have Got a Pretty Nice Bod\n\nVictoria Dines Alone\n\nYour Friendly, Liberal Neighborhood Ku Klux Klan\n\nLeaving On A Jet Plane\n\nEighth Of January/Hop High Ladies Medley â Paul Prestopino\n\nYellow Cat\n\nThe â68 Nixon\n\nTurning Point\n\nGet Together\n\nCoal Tatoo (end)\n\nLeyenda (classical guitar solo) - Michael Johnson\n\nBusiness Goes On As Usual\n\nCatch Another Butterfly\n\nFoggy Mountain Breakdown - Paul Prestopino\n\nCripple Creek - Paul Prestopino\n\nSticky Summer Weather\n\nLove Of The Common People â 2\n\nBoth Sides Now â 2\n\nI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free â 2\n\nBistro Closing\n\nThat's The Way It's Gonna Be (Bob Gibson & Phil Ochs)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nWhat This Country Really Needs Is Another Movie Star (June Reizner, aka Bernie Cross)\n\nI wish I knew more about who June Reizner was. I found an obituary for her, indicating she died in 1978, that she was a composer, and that she wrote for the Allan King Comedy show. This is a clever song, and I understand she had written âBarryâs Boysâ, âThe â68 Nixonâ, and âAlabama Motherâ too.\n\nWe Didn't Know (Tom Paxton)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nTake Me to Tomorrow (John Denver)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nSaturday Night in Toledo Ohio (Randy Sparks)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nRed Velvet (Ian Tyson)\n\nThis song was written and recorded at the height of the Folk Music Scare of the 60âs. Ian and Sylvia were one of the most favorite and emulated groups of The Queen City Balladeers and were one of the satirical folk group prototypes for the movie âA Mighty Windâ. There was nothing like an Ian and Sylvia recording with John Herald and Ian playing their Martin guitars on them. I still think that the early Ian and Sylvia recordings had the best sounding acoustic guitars on them. âRed Velvetâ came from Ian and Sylviaâs album âEarly Morning Rainâ, which also had âDarcy Farrowâ on it. I wish I knew Dave Boiseâs history before he joined the Trio, but Iâm guessing this was either one of his favorite songs, and/or one he did before the Trio.\n\nI Like To Deal With The Ladies (John Denver)\n\nFlint Hill Special (Earl Scruggs) Paul Prestopino solo\n\nEverybodyâs Talkinâ (Harry Nillson)\n\nThis is a beautiful Trio version of this song, which we first heard DB&J doing at a party.\n\nBoth Sides Now (Joni Mitchell)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nLove Of The Common People (John Hurley & Ronnie Wilkin)\n\nI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free (Dick Dallas, Billy Taylor)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nIf You Had Me In Shackles (Tom Paxton)\n\nAlse see the Philadelphia Folk Festival version of DB&J doing this song. The song was not recorded by Denver, Boise & Johnson, or The Mitchell Trio or anyone as far as anyone knows.\n\nJohn Birch Society (Michael Brown)\n\nFor Bobbi (John Denver)\n\nUnfortunately this is not a good recording of this song. I liked the song the from very first time I heard it because itâs a good, distinctive sounding 3-chord song, and because of Paul Prestopinoâs Carter Family style of Martin guitar picking on it.\n\nYou Sure Have Got a Pretty Nice Bod (Michael Smith)\n\nMichael Smith also wrote The Wonderful World of Sex and The Dutchman.\n\nVictoria Dines Alone (Tom Paxton)\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Ku Klux Klan (June Reizner, aka Bernie Cross)\n\nThis is from The Mitchell Trio album âViolets of Dawn.\"\n\nLeaving On A Jet Plane (John Denver)\n\nEighth Of January/Hop High Ladies Medley\n\nPaul Prestopino solo\n\nYellow Cat (Steve Fromholz)\n\nsee song notes aboave\n\nThe â68 Nixon (June Reizner, aka Bernie Cross)\n\nsee song notes aboave\n\nTurning Point (Martha Holmes)\n\nGet Together (Chet Powers)\n\nThis is a Youngbloods song and was on the Mitchell Trio album âThatâs The Way Itâs Gonna Beâ. Back in that era, we probably ignored the Youngbloods hit but learned the song after we heard DB&J doing it.\n\nCoal Tattoo (Billy Edd Wheeler)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nLeyenda (Francisco Tarrenga)\n\nMichael Johnson's classical guitar solo. FYI, in 1968, Michael Johnson went by âMikeâ. Francisco Tarrenga is considered the father of classical guitar, according to Wikipedia\n\nBusiness Goes On As Usual (Fred Hellerman and Fran Minkoff)\n\nThis was a Mitchell Trio song and it fit Johnâs growing though initially uncomfortable feeling anti-war sentiment. Anti-Vietnam war, that is. It was originally sung by Joe Frazier in the Mitchell Trio. It was interesting that John and Michael Johnson were both initially uncomfortable with âprotestâ songs back then. John seemed to eventually welcome this into his personality, though Michael was more comfortable not singing about causes in his later years. (Michael sang this solo as late as 1975 at the Guthrie.)\n\nCatch Another Butterfly (Mike Williams)\n\nI think itâs reasonable that this song was performed at the last two concerts of Denver, Boise & Johnson and that John Denver left it off of the compilation tape. This is yet another song brought to DB&J by Michael Johnson and one that John recorded on his first album, âRhymes and Reasonsâ. When the Balladeers first heard this song we all wanted to learn it immediately, and we did. Itâs a great, great song and Michael Johnsonâs distinctive classical guitar part on it was emulated by John when he went solo and by all of us who learned it. (Michael continued to sing this all his solo years.)\n\nThe story is complete now, as much as it can be, of Mike Williams and this wonderful song of his, âCatch Another Butterflyâ. Thanks to Mike for writing me back and filling in some holes about this song and about yourself. Mike says he wrote this song in September of 1966 and sang it on the day he wrote it, to Paul and Amy Johnson. âJohnsonâ, you say? Paul Johnson is Mike/Michael Johnsonâs brother. Amy Johnson is also known as Crow Johnson, a famous singer/songwriter and as the one for whom the âCrowâs Nestâ at the Kerrville Folk Festival is named. Michael Johnson has also recorded a number of Crowâs songs. (In Your Eyes, The Gypsy In The Photograph, The Glory & Ridin' In the Sky)\n\nMike Williams relates that from his memory, Michael Johnson was passing by Austin, TX on his way to Minneapolis and to joining the group Denver, Boise & Johnson, when he stopped by Paul and Amy Johnsonâs place. They taught him âCatch Another Butterflyâ. Michael drove north and taught the song to the Trio. Of course, we all know that John Denver and Michael Johnson took up the song when they went solo.\n\nI was amazed to find out that Mike Williams and Steve Fromholz (of âYellow Catâ fame) were in a duet in the spring of 1968, called âFrummoxâ. Mike and Steve were playing at a place called âGigiâs Loungeâ in Denver, when Steve got a call on the bar phone from Cherry Lane Publishing Company and was asked the question âIs it ok if John Denver records Steveâs âYellow Catâ and Mikeâs âCatch Another Butterflyâ on his first album? The two Frummox gentlemen said âYep, it was okâ. The rest is musical history. Thank you Mike for letting me and anyone else who reads this, know about your song. Mike has let me know that I can share not only his recollections of this wonderful song, but the words too, which contain an extra verse that not many people know. Some of us Balladeers knew this extra verse because Mike Johnson happened to do it in 1970 on a tape from the Wise Owl coffeehouse.\n\nMike Williamsâ thoughts about âCatch Another Butterflyâ, written 9/4/2007:\n\nJohn, I wrote \"Catch Another Butterfly\" on a sunny afternoon sitting under a tree outside the student union on the UT campus in Austin. There likely was a passing butterfly. Or maybe I was just feeling nostalgic. I was 22, an absurd age to be so reflective. Autobiographical? Yeah, I enjoyed catching butterflies as a kid, and surely experienced all the details in the song (except no son).\n\nThe writing was quick, maybe an hour. There's a saying among songwriters who are in the first rush of a write and see the whole vision and all that's left is to work out the details: \"This song is finished. Now all I gotta do is finish it.\" In that sense, \"Catch Another Butterfly\" took only a few minutes to write. Also, the melody came fast, and it had two qualities that songwriters crave: runs and jumps. The cascading runs, balanced with the little ups and downs, make this a memorable melody, a fun melody to sing.\n\nDid I know it was a good song? It felt good, coming out -- as a songwriter, that's a feeling I've learned to trust. And when I sang it for friends, their reaction was wonderful. I didn't really have a sense, back then, of how the song would hold up over the years. Only the passage of time, and word coming in from folks like you, have proved the song's reach.\n\n(An interview with Mike Williams by Crow Johnson along with the lyrics can be found at https://mjblue.com/bmwilliams.html and a video of Michael is at https://youtu.be/pE-lm7Y05kI at time 14:22.)\n\nFoggy Mountain Breakdown/Cripple Creek\n\nPaul Prestopino solos. Cripple Creek is an example of where Paul switched between frailing style banjo playing and the normal Scruggs style 5-string banjo picking. And of course, Foggy Mountain Breakdown is THE classic Earl Scruggs bluegrass tune, made massively famous by being in the movie âBonnie and Clydeâ.\n\nSticky Summer Weather (John Denver)\n\nThis was always one of my favorite John Denver songs. -JM\n\nLove Of The Common People (John Hurley, Ronnie Wilkins)\n\nBoth Sides Now (Joni Mitchell)\n\nSee song notes above\n\nI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free (Dick Dallas, Billy Taylor)\n\nsee song notes above\n\nWonderful World of Sex (Michael Peter Smith) â omitted from recording\n\nThis song was definitely performed at the same concerts that made up the last DB&J concert recordings. For some reason John decided to leave the song out of the DB&J last concerts compilation tape. It was introduced to DB&J by Michael Johnson. How do I know John left the song out? Michael Johnsonâs follow-up line to the song, âSex is just natureâs way of saying Hiâ was on the tape. Unfortunately, this song was also missing from the Bistro Inn tape, even though I had originally written that it was on it. The only other recording Iâve heard of this song was done by Steve Goodman and in my opinion Michael Johnsonâs version was better. (Michael's solo performance from 1968 can be heard here.)\n\nYou Done Stomped On My Heart\n\nMitchell Trio and DB&J early versions. Itâs interesting to see the progression of this song from when they barely knew it in the Mitchell Trio days, to where it was the almost finished DB&J version at the Miami University party. At the Oxford, Ohio party, âStomptâ was the first of a round of funny C&W songs, and it was followed by myself mentioning âEgg Suckinâ Dogâ (the great Johnny Cash song), Michael Johnson doing a little each of âIf You Think Youâve Reached The Bottom, Just Look Downâ, âThank You Dear Jesus, For Victory In Koreaâ, and then everyone at the party doing âAmelia Earhartâ. Erich Zwertschek knew the verses to âAmeliaâ, and is singing them. Itâs interesting that Paul Prestopino was originally in the bluegrass group âThe Greenbriar Boysâ and that this group was where we all learned âAmelia Earhartâ.\n\nLove Is The Answer (John Denver)\n\nIt took me a while to research and then to realize that this was truly an unknown song written by John. Iâve talked with two excellent JD historians and both agree that this is a song that was never recorded anywhere as far as we know. You can find the song listed at least, on the Cherry Lane Publishing site as written by JD. It brings to mind conversations Iâve had with Jochen Michalak about the other JD songs sitting in vaults somewhere, waiting to be rediscovered and recorded by someone, anyone.\n\nAs an FYI, Jochen Michalak belongs to a John Denver fan club in Germany that has been operating since 1981. This is a group of true fans, and I appreciate all the information Jochen, as one of the best JD historians around, has passed on to me. Their web site is at http://www.johndenverclub.org/\n\nWith The Wind On My Mind (John Denver)\n\nAnother song that JD never recorded.\n\nPhiladelphia Folk Festival\n\nIf You Had Me In Shackles\n\nYellow Cat\n\nTalking Vietnam Potluck Blues\n\nBusiness Goes on as Usual\n\nEverybody's Talkin'\n\n'68 Nixon\n\nLeaving on a Jet Plane\n\nLove of the Common People\n\nDenver, Boise & Johnson after-concert party in Oxford, Ohio October 12, 1968\n\nThere are several songs on these tapes where they were learning this song or the other before the group broke up. As examples, they were doing a wonderful version of the Chuck Berry song âMemphisâ, and Mike Johnson had lead on âLittle Green Apples.â\n\nBoth Sides Now\n\nEverybody's Talkin'\n\nRed Velvet\n\nLove is the Answer (\"I just wrote that about a week ago\", JD says)\n\nDriving Through the Hills of Mexico\n\nLittle Green Apples\n\nYou Dun Stomped On My Heart\n\nIf You Think You've Reached the Bottom, Just Look Down\n\nThank You Dear Jesus For Victory in Korea\n\nAmelia Earhart\n\nJohn Hardy instrumental\n\nBugle Call Rag instrumental\n\nFoggy Mountain Breakdown instrumental\n\nEarl's Breakdown instrumental\n\nUnknown (someone identify this bluegrass tune) 39:00\n\nUnknown inst\n\nUnknown inst - 44:00\n\nCripple Creek inst. 45:00\n\nPike County Breakdown inst. 47:00\n\nLove Come Home inst. 50:00\n\nElla Speed 52:00\n\nAlice's Restaurant 58:00\n\nMemphis - 1:00\n\nCindy's Crying 1:02\n\nNow That I've Taken My Life - 1:05\n\nThe Game is Over 1:09\n\nYellow Cat 1:12\n\nWaitin Around to Die 1:15:45\n\nFlower Time? 1:19\n\nChicken Road 1:23\n\nPeople Get Ready 1:26\n\nI Wish I Knew How To Be Free (let me tune that 12 string for god's sake) 1:31:46\n\nLeukemia Benefit\n\nDenver to Present Concert\n\nThe Denisonian\n\nApril 21, 1972\n\nby Rollie Travte\n\nJohn Denver. Mike Johnson, and Dave Boise of the popular Mitchell Trio will perform in a benefit concert for the Leukemia Society of America next Thursday al 8 p.m. in Livingston Gym.\n\nThe proceeds from the event will go towards the growth of the Buzz Rogert Fellowship Fund which was established in memory of Vincent \"Buzz\" Bogert, a 1970 graduate of Denison and member of Pi Delta Theta fraternity, who died last year of acute leukemia. The Leukemia Society will award the grant to the scientist with the best research program in the field of research in young adult leukemia.\n\nThe concert is being coordinated by the Phi Delta under the direction of their president, George Hodges, and Jon Wells, co-chairman. The University has donated the use of the 3,000 seat basketball facilities for the event.\n\nBogert Joined Phil Delt as a pledge in 1966 and was graduated from Dennison In June of 1970, when he entered the executive training program of the Pacific Telephone Company. In March of 1971 he developed acute leukemia and despite the latest treatments available, died at the age of 23 after his five-month fight against death.\n\nDenver and Bogert, both of Los Angeles, were close personal friends and when Denver requested to perform for the benefit, it was he who arranged fo the addition of Johnson and Boise to the bill. Bopert's parents, whe currently reside in California, have been working closely with the Los Angeles chapter of the Leukemia Society of American in order to raise the enormous funds required fo descover the potential cure for the disease.\n\nHodges revealed that the benefit had been a long time in planning and that all the members of the house were working together In efforts to make the benefit concert a success. He hopes that the donations to this cause will be high and that he has \"great confidence\" in the Denison students to make the endeavor an auspicious occasion. \"Denver, Johnson and Boise will perform separately for about 30 to 40 minute then the three will combine for the last port of the show,\" added Hodges, \"and we think that the benefit will be sold out for the performance.\"\n\nMembers of the house will go to various living units to promote the concert. Tickets will be available in the union is well as at the door and the concert will be open to students of all surrounding schools. The donation is $3.00.\n\nJohn Marlowe\n\nApril 1, 2007\n\nEmail: JohnMarlowe@CincinnatiDancingPigs.com\n\nCredits and thanks:\n\nThe biggest credit goes to Cindy McArthur, who assisted me in so many ways, starting with pulling a lot of the songs off of the reel-to-reel tapes.
