        "text": "John Denver's song \"For You\" is a touching and heartfelt declaration of love and devotion. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a love that is all-encompassing and unwavering. Denver's words express a deep longing to be close to his beloved, to share in their joys and sorrows, and to be a constant presence in their life. The repetition of the word \"just\" emphasizes the simplicity and purity of his desires, highlighting that his love is not about grand gestures but about the everyday moments and the deep emotional connection he shares with his partner.\n\nThe song is filled with tender imagery, such as looking into the eyes of his beloved, laying in their arms, and living in their laughter. These lines convey a sense of intimacy and closeness, suggesting that the singer finds immense joy and fulfillment in these simple acts of love. The lyrics also reveal a sense of selflessness, as Denver sings about offering prayers, longing for kisses, and dreaming of his partner's sighs. This selflessness is further underscored by the line, \"Just to know that I'd give my life for you,\" which speaks to the depth of his commitment and the extent to which he values his partner's happiness and well-being.\n\nThe chorus of the song reinforces the theme of lifelong devotion, with Denver pledging to dedicate the rest of his life to his beloved. The repetition of the phrase \"For you\" serves as a powerful reminder of the central focus of his love and devotion. The song concludes with a poignant declaration of love, as Denver sings about the words of a love song, the beat of his heart, and the pledge of his life. These final lines encapsulate the essence of the song, which is a beautiful and sincere expression of enduring love and commitment."
