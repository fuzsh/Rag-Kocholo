Singing on his iconic 1977 special John Denver & Friends - Thank God I'm a Country Boy, Denver was joined by country legends Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, Glen Campbell, and Mary Kay Place.  The scene kicked off with Denver slowly approaching his mark within a quaint church setting, cheerfully singing, \"Some bright morning when this life is over/ I'll fly away/ To that home on God's celestial shore/ I'll fly away.\"   Before long, the neighboring legends had risen to greet the country boy and harmoniously jumped into a soulful performance that had viewers craving more. \"I'll fly away, oh glory/ I'll fly away in the morning/ When I die, Hallelujah by and by/ I'll fly away,\" they sang, as each legend was given the opportunity to individually showcase their iconic voices.  The beloved gospel hit was originally written in 1929 by Albert E. Brumley, becoming one of the most recorded gospel hits in music. You can watch the nostalgic video below!",
