        "text": "3. Regeneration after Anterior Evisceration\n\n3.1. Morphological Aspects of Regeneration\n\nThe morphological aspects of gut regeneration after anterior evisceration have been described in sufficient detail only from one holothurian species, E. fraudatrix [24][42][43][46][61]. The early post-evisceration stage is approximately the same as in A. japonicus and H. glaberrima ( a–f). Within the first 3 dpe, the wound at the anterior end of the animal is healed [42], immunity is activated, the cell composition of the coelomic fluid is restored [26][27], and connective-tissue thickenings are formed along the mesentery edge ( d–f) [42][61]. The main difference from A. japonicus and H. glaberrima is that E. fraudatrix ejects not only the gut, but also the aquapharyngeal bulb (AB) during evisceration. As a result, regeneration begins with the formation of the AB anlage, and then, after 3 dpe, the anterior connective-tissue thickening begins to grow from it along the mesentery edge [42].\n\nFigure 4.

(g) Anterior part of holothurian on seventh day post-evisceration; (h) Longitudinal section of the region of gut anlage, which is marked by the rectangle in (g). (i) Transverse section of the site of embedding of coelomic epithelial cells into connective tissue thickening which is marked by solid line in (h). ab, aquapharyngeal bulb; bw, body wall; ce, coelomic epithelium; ct, connective tissue; ctt, connective tissue thickening; dc, de-differentiated coelomic epithelial cell; dm, de-differentiating myoepithelial cell; dp, de-differentiating peritoneal cell; ga, anterior gut anlage; m, mesentery; my, myoepithelial cell; nc, nerve cell; pc, peritoneal cell; sls, myofilaments grouped into spindle-like structures, tc, coelomic epithelial cell during transdifferentiation.\n\nAfter 5–7 dpe, the coelomic epithelial cells are embedded into the connective-tissue thickening and begin transdifferentiation ( g–i) [46]. The embedding occurs in a quite limited area on the ventral side of mesentery, near the AB anlage. The embedded cells divide and gradually migrate anteriorly and posteriorly inside the thickening, forming the luminal epithelium of the anterior gut anlage. The cells do not lose relationships with each other, and intercellular junctions are maintained. Transdifferentiation proceeds quite quickly, and the signs of specialization of enterocytes in luminal epithelium appear after 10 dpe [46]. The posterior anlage forms in the same way as in A. japonicus and H. glaberrima. Subsequently, both anlagen of the gut grow along the mesentery edge towards each other and merge into a single digestive tube within 15–20 dpe.\n\n3.2. Transcriptomic Data\n\nA total of 11 genes of TFs were identified and characterized in E. fraudatrix that showed higher transcriptional activity during transdifferentiation (5–7 dpe) than in the previous and subsequent stages (3 dpe and 10 dpe, respectively) [102]. They belong to 6 TF classes: Tryptophan cluster (Ef-elf), C2H2 zinc finger (Ef-prdm9, Ef-egr1, Ef-klf1/2/4 (klf2), Ef-snai2), bHLH (Ef-tcf24, Ef-msc, Ef-id2), C4 zinc finger (Ef-gata3), polycomb group ring finger (Ef-pcgf2), and T-box (Ef-tbx20). During this period, in addition to the embedding and transdifferentiation of a part of coelomic epithelial cells, the dedifferentiation and proliferation of coelomic epithelial cells on the surface of mesentery and anlage, and also the ECM synthesis and modification continue in the anterior gut anlage of E. fraudatrix. It can be assumed that genes whose expression increases during this period are involved in the regulation of one or more of the above mentioned processes.\n\nThe dedifferentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of the undifferentiated state of coelomic epithelial cells can involve Ef-elf, Ef-prdm9, Ef-klf1/2/4, and Ef-egr1. Ef-ELF belongs to the Ets family, whose members are powerful regulators of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, tumor transformation, and differentiation [106][107]. Proteins of the PRDM family are important epigenetic regulators of development, cell differentiation, and pluripotency in mice [108]. The KLF proteins play diverse roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and development [109]. EGR1 is involved in the cell cycle progression of various tumor types, and also in hepatic regeneration in mammals [110][111].\n\nThe Ef-gata3, Ef-egr1, and Ef-klf1/2/4 genes may be involved in the regulation of transdifferentiation. The Ef-gata3 gene is of particular interest as its homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans is involved in transdifferentiation [112]. Moreover, it regulates the mesoderm and endoderm specification in echinoderms and mammals [113][114]. In planarians, EGR1 is a “putative pioneer factor to directly activate wound-induced genes” in whole-body regeneration [115]. KLF2 and KLF4 are key TFs that maintain a stem cell-like state and somatic cell reprogramming [116]. It is worth noting that in the holothurians H. glaberrima and A. japonicus the expression of klf1/2/4 does not change during gut regeneration [28][75][117]. The different dynamics of klf1/2/4 expression between these two species and E. fraudatrix confirms presence of different gut regeneration mechanisms in holothurians [58].\n\nEf-elf and Ef-id2 can be involved in processes associated with the digestive system development and enterocyte differentiation. The expression of sea urchin elf is detected everywhere in late gastrula, being more concentrated in the gut [118]. The id2 gene encodes a protein that, strictly speaking, is not a TF, since it lacks the basic DNA-binding domain. Nevertheless, it plays an important role in the digestive system development in vertebrates by preventing the precocious differentiation of the embryonic intestinal epithelium [119].\n\nAs is mentioned above, in the period when transdifferentiation occurs, the dedifferentiation of myoepithelial cells continues on the surface of the gut anlage. Among the identified TFs, Ef-msc and Ef-tbx20 may probably be involved in the regulation of this process. In mammals, MSC (musculin) is a lineage-restricted repressor of embryonic skeletal muscle development [120]. TBX20 is a crucial cardiogenic TF in mammals [121]. The tbx20 gene is also expressed in the nervous system and embryonic lateral mesoderm in mice [121][122].\n\nHomologs of three TFs, Ef-pcgf, Ef-snai2, and Ef-id2, in vertebrates are involved in the mechanisms of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). PCGF2 is a chromatin-modifying protein that inhibits EMT and negatively regulates stem cell-like properties [123][124]. SNAI proteins play a crucial role in EMT and in repressing the mesenchymal-epithelial transition, being important in embryonic and tumor development [125][126][127]. On the other hand, a complex of SNAI and ID2 inhibits EMT [128][129]. Co-expression of Ef-snai2 and Ef-id2 may indicate a partial involvement of the EMT mechanisms during the gut regeneration in E. fraudatrix. It is probable that, while embedding in the connective-tissue thickening, coelomic epithelial cells acquire some mesenchymal features [130][131][132].\n\nGene tcf24 was first described in 2002 from humans as a paralog of the tcf23 [133]. Since then, no information about its functions has been obtained. Activation of Ef-tcf24 during regeneration in holothurians is the first description of its involvement in regeneration. The increase in the Ef-tcf24 expression after 5-7 dpe in E. fraudatrix suggests participation of this gene in gut regeneration in holothurians.\n\nMoreover, genes of Cyclins, Cdcs, Retinoic acid receptors and some other proteins participating in retinoic acid anabolism, are up-regulated during regeneration of anterior gut anlage in E. fraudatrix [102].\n\n3.3. Wnt Signaling Pathway\n\nThe Wnt signaling pathway is activated in the regeneration of the organs of the anterior part of the body in E. fraudatrix (AB and the anterior part of the gut). Gene transcripts of four ligands (wntA, wnt4, wnt6, and wnt16) and three receptors (frizzled1/2/7, frizzled4, and frizzled5/8) have been identified in the AB and gut anlagen [134]. All of them exhibit different expression dynamics. According to preliminary data, transcripts of the studied genes are localized in coelomic epithelium and organs of the water–vascular system of forming AB [135].\n\nThe increase in the wnt16 expression occurs earliest of all, after 3 dpe. In vertebrates, the wnt16 expression is often associated with the development or regeneration of connective-tissue structures, the transformation of the extracellular matrix, and the activation of metalloproteinases [136][137][138]. In E. fraudatrix, an increase in the activity of MMPs and ECM remodeling is observed in this period [97].\n\nAfter 5-7 dpe, the expression of wntA, wnt4, wnt6, frizzled1/2/7, and frizzled4 increases abruptly and reaches its maximum. At this time, the main structures of AB and luminal epithelium are formed [42][46]. It is probable that Wnt signaling, performed through these ligands and receptors, influences the regeneration of the canals of the AB water–vascular system (water–vascular ring and radial water–vascular canals), and is also involved in the regulation of transdifferentiation.\n\nThe following regeneration period (10 dpe) is characterized by either reduced or insignificantly changed expression of most of the studied genes. The exception is frizzled5/8, whose number of transcripts reaches its maximum. Subsequently, after 14 and 20 dpe, changes in the expression of all Wnt and frizzled genes are minimal. It is worth mentioning that the dynamics of frizzled1/2/7 differ between E. fraudatrix and A. japonicus [139][134]. This may be explained by different functions of pathways which activated through the receptor Frizzled1/2/7."
