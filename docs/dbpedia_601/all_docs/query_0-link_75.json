        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe British Antarctic Survey (BAS) JR275 research cruise on the RRS James Clark Ross visited the Weddell Sea from February to March in 2012 as part of a core EvolHist (Evolutionary History of the Polar Regions) project. Prior to this expedition, the south-eastern Weddell Sea had been a relatively under sampled area on the Antarctic continental shelf, according to a gap analysis carried out by Griffiths et al. (2014). The eastern Weddell Sea is characterized by perennial sea ice cover and very large icebergs. The Filchner Trough is known to be an area responsible for generating the oxygen and nutrient-rich Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which helps drive oceanic circulation. By sampling benthic animals from the eastern Weddell Sea continental margin and slope and the deepened shelf basins of the Filchner Trough, the expedition aimed to collect specimens and associated data to investigate patterns of biodiversity and feed into biogeography and phylogeography studies of this important region of the Southern Ocean. Recording current biodiversity in the region is becoming increasingly urgent with the drastic decline in summer sea ice in the Weddell Sea over the last 5 years likely to have major implications for the marine ecosystem (Turner et al. 2020). Echinoids from JR275 were reported by Saucède et al. (2015) and the Asteroidea are included by Moreau et al. (2018).\n\nThis dataset reports holothuroid species occurrences and richness for individual Agassiz Trawls (AGTs) during the JR275 expedition and is provided for comparison with and updating of known lists of Weddell Sea and other Antarctic holothuroids. O’Loughlin et al. (2010) provided a comprehensive overview of Antarctic sea cucumber species, listing 187 species (including 51 still undescribed at the time of that publication) along with cryptic species and synonymies indicated by mtDNA sequence data. O’Loughlin et al. (2010) also reported 37 known species from shelf and slope depths in the Weddell Sea; here we add 11 new known species to this list for comparative depths (Table 5). The Weddell Sea is reported to be one of the most species-rich regions for holothuroids in Antarctica (O’Loughlin et al. 2010). Subsequent papers have continued to expand our knowledge of the previously undescribed Antarctic holothuroid fauna including papers by O’Loughlin and VandenSpiegel (2010) on apodids, O’Loughlin and Whitfield (2010) on psolids, O’Loughlin et al. (2013) on new holothuroids from Admiralty Bay, Davey and Whitfield (2013) on additional psolid fauna, O’Loughlin et al. (2014) on new Antarctic holothuroids and taxonomic reviews of some genera, Bohn and Hess (2014) on Echinopsolus and revisions within Psolidae and Cucumariidae, O’Loughlin et al. (2015a) on a new species of apodid from this JR275 expedition, and O’Loughlin et al. (2015b) on sea cucumbers of the Kerguelen Plateau. Gutt et al. (2014) also provided the original dataset for earlier voyages by German research vessel Polarstern to the Weddell Sea, including the holothuroid identifications and distributions published by Gutt (1990, 1991a, b) and subsequently referenced by O’Loughlin (2002), before further examination and revision by O’Loughlin et al. (2010). The dataset itself has since been updated by Piepenburg (2019). O’Loughlin et al. (2016) also gave an overview of Antarctic holothuroids collected during the historic Discovery expeditions. This current paper continues to build on our knowledge of Antarctic holothuroids.\n\nThis is a contribution to the SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) AntEco (State of the Antarctic Ecosystem) Programme.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nCollecting equipment used on JR275 included an Agassiz trawl (AGT) and an Epibenthic Sledge (EBS) fitted with camera. This paper reports on the holothuroid specimens collected at 51 of the AGT sampling sites in the eastern Weddell Sea at depths of between ~400 and ~2,000 m, and a single test location at ~280 m depth off the South Orkney Islands (Fig. 1, Table 1). Weddell Sea deployments were mostly conducted along two transects, one running from south to north along the edge of the Filchner Trough and one running from west to east out of the Filchner Trough onto the shallower shelf. Over-deepened basins close to the Brunt Ice shelf were also sampled. At each site, three replicate AGT individual stations were taken and where the substrate was suitable a single EBS trawl was also conducted. EBS samples have not been examined for holothuroids at this stage and are not discussed further here, but this material is currently stored in the BAS collections in Cambridge, UK. The AGT used an inner mesh size of 1 cm, had a mouth width of 2 m, and was trawled at 1 knot for between 2 and 10 minutes depending on depth, substrate, and condition of animals in the initial catch. The deployment protocol was standardized and is outlined in full in the JR275 cruise report, available from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/10598/).\n\nTable 1.\n\nDownload as\n\nLive or early preservation images of specimens were taken on board the RRS James Clark Ross by Camille Moreau (Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer, Brest, France) with assistance from Melanie Mackenzie (Museums Victoria), James Rudd (BAS), and Douglas Hamilton (University of East Anglia) using a digital SLR Nikon D3X with 60 mm lens and flash rigging and Nikon D700 with 60 mm lens.\n\nPreliminary identification of holothuroid material was carried out during the cruise by Melanie Mackenzie. DNA tissue samples (chiefly tentacle or tube foot sub-samples) were taken by Melanie Mackenzie with assistance from Stuart MacMillan (BAS) for BOLD barcoding. A total of 190 specimens from 50 AGT stations (~15% of all specimens) were sampled during the cruise. DNA extractions of some Elpidiidae holothuroid specimens were conducted onboard by Jennifer Jackson (BAS) with assistance from Melanie Mackenzie using QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue molecular kit. Tissues samples of Peniagone specimens were also sent to Pamela Brannock at Auburn University and Rollins College in USA and a sample of Protelpidia was sent to Akito Ogawa at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Japan for further genetic analysis. Holothuroid specimens were preserved in 96% undenatured and pre-cooled (at −20 °C) ethanol and subsequently transferred to −20 °C freezer for a minimum of 48 hours with rotation of containers to ensure full preservation of material. Material was sent on to Melanie Mackenzie and Mark O’Loughlin at Museums Victoria, in Australia, for further examination and determination using stereo and compound microscopes. New species of Apodida (as Synaptida) specimens from this collection were described in O’Loughlin et al. (2015a) and are reported in Table 5 and Suppl. material 1: Table S1 alongside determinations of the remaining sea cucumber samples from AGT trawls. Specimens were identified to species level where possible, and to higher taxonomic levels where species-level determinations could not be made. Determinations here are based on morpho-taxonomic methods. Future genetic and morphological work may lead to additions or changes.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAntaBIS Antarctic Biodiversity Information System;\n\nAntEco State of the Antarctic Ecosystem;\n\nAntOBIS Antarctic Thematic Node of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System;\n\nBAS British Antarctic Survey;\n\nEvolHist Evolutionary History of the Polar Regions (a BAS core project);\n\nNHMUK British Museum of Natural History (registration number prefix NHMUK);\n\nNMV Museums Victoria, Australia, used with registration number prefix F.;\n\nSCAR The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research."
