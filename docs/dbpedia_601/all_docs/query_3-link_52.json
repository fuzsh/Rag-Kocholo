        "text": "Deuterostomes are animals that share such embryological similarities as radial, indeterminate cleavage and a blastopore that becomes the tail end.\n\nEchinoderms (starfishes, crinoids, sea urchins, and their relatives) are often radially symmetrical as adults, but their embryonic stages show similarities to the chordates.\n\nDeuterostome characteristics: Embryological similarities shared by chordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms:\n\nRadial cleavage: The 8-celled stage has 2 tiers of 4 cells each, with each cell directly below or above another.\n\nIndeterminate cleavage: Cells separated in early embryonic stages can develop into an entire embryo.\n\nDeuterostome condition: The embryo's blastopore becomes the posterior (tail) end. (Remember that in molluscs, arthropods, and other protostome phyla, the blastopore becomes the mouth.)\n\nPhylum Echinodermata:\n\nAnimals with a unique water-vascular system, using sea water as a circulatory fluid. Several embryonic similarities to chordates, including a true coelom, which develops as an enterocoel. Change of symmetry in many cases, from a bilateral larva to a radial adult, typically in a 5-fold pattern. Protective plates or shells frequently made of calcium carbonate and armed with bumps or spines. High ability to regenerate lost parts.\n\nSessile (attached) echinoderms (Homalozoa and Crinozoa): Echinoderms that grow attached include crinoids (sea lilies) and a variety of extinct groups (blastoids, cystoids, carpoids, etc.). Many grow on stalks attached to the bottom. Body cup-shaped, open toward the top, with a mouth in the center of the top surface. Arm-like rays, in multiples of five, grow out and upward from the margins of the mouth. Each ray has a ciliated groove that traps food particles and brings them to the mouth. The earliest fossil forms were irregular and lacked symmetry, but radial symmetry developed early, generally in a 5-fold pattern. Biologists believe that echinoderm ancestors were bilaterally symmetrical and that filter-feeding (filtering small particles of food from the water) made radial symmetry selectively advantageous. Attached echinoderms flourished mainly during Paleozoic times. Today, only a few crinoids remain; other attached echinoderms are extinct.\n\nFree-moving echinoderms (Echinozoa and Asterozoa): Mostly bottom-feeding scavengers and predators that attack other invertebrates. The mouth, on the lower surface, faces downward. Branches of the water-vascular system may form foot-like podia, used in locomotion.\n\nAsterozoa: Body star-shaped, with protruding arms. Includes starfishes and brittle stars.\n\nEchinozoa: Body globe-shaped, with no protruding arms. Includes sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and sand dollars.\n\nDeuterostomes\n\nIndex Syllabus\n\nPrev rev.
