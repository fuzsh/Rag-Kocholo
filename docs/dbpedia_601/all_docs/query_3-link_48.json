But, the five major living classes account for around seven thousand extant (surviving) examples.\n\nThis section contains fun facts and interesting information about the echinoderm marine invertebrate animals that belong to the phylum Echinodermata.\n\nFacts about Echinoderms (for Scuba Divers)\n\nIn the Greek language, echinoderm means spiny (from \"echinos\") and skin (from \"derma\").\n\nThe five surviving classes are morphologically diverse, represented by:\n\nAsteroidea (sea stars (starfishes))\n\nCrinoidea (feather stars, sea lilies)\n\nEchinoidea (sand dollars, sea urchins)\n\nHolothuroidea (sea cucumbers)\n\nOphiuroidea (basket stars, brittle stars, serpent stars)\n\nThere are around 13,000 extinct echinoderm species. Hence, understanding how the classifications relate to each other is mostly done through the largest fossilised echinoids and crinoids, some of which are more than 20 metres long (66 feet).\n\nMost of the living classes are found in abundance in all saltwater environments around the world. Plus, almost two hundred species of echinoderms can also survive life in the harshest Arctic regions, mostly brittle stars of the class Ophiuroidea.\n\nBut wait - there's more:\n\nThe widest distributions occur in the diverse habitats of coral reef formations and shorelines in the tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\n\nBy and large, most of the phylum echinodermata have limited depth ranges. Thus, shallower than 100 metres (330 feet) is the norm. Nevertheless, some of the deep-sea specimens can exist at incredible depths - approaching five thousand metres (16,400 feet).\n\nFun Fact: Only a few species can survive abyssal depths beyond nine kilometres (5 miles). They include 'sea pigs' (Elpidiidae) and some species of sea cucumbers of the genus Myriotrochus.\n\nCharacteristics of Echinoderm\n\nThe adult stage in deuterostomal (bilaterian) animals is the time when they feature their unmistakable pentaradial five-part symmetry (meaning divisible into five equal parts).\n\nAll echinoderms have an internal skeleton made from stereom (calcium carbonate), including the extinct fossilised forms.\n\nEven though these marine invertebrate species display various forms of sensory perception, they lack a \"definitive\" or well-developed sensory head region.\n\nHere's the thing:\n\nMost echinoderm clades function through a simplified \"one-way\" digestive system. Even so, they have a diversified range of feeding mechanisms.\n\nSome species are carnivorous, using a mouth, a stomach, and an intestine to metabolise their food, such as small mollusks.\n\nWhereas, others are herbivores and some are detritivores, grazing and chewing on marine algae or getting enough nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter.\n\nPhylum Echinodermata Regeneration Process\n\nIt's fair to say that having the ability to regenerate a lost body part is rare in the animal kingdom. Yet, brittle stars and sea stars are able to regrow arms and even divide in half to produce two completely new individuals.\n\nInteresting Fact: Some sea urchins can replace their spines and any lost (or damaged) tube feet. Plus, some sea cucumber species can regrow the whole of their digestive tract.\n\nEchinoderm Size and Colour\n\nCompared to some marine annelids and most saltwater crustaceans, echinoderms are small - rarely growing more than ten (10) centimetres long or diameter (4 inches).\n\nEven so, the snake sea cucumber (Synapta maculata) grows up to three metres long (ten feet), and sunflower sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides) have an arm span up to one (1) metre (3.3 feet).\n\nMoving on...\n\nOne of the striking features of the echinoderm species is the brilliant colouring. For example, many are flamboyant red, some are radiant orange, and others are green or purple.\n\nIn general, the tropical species tend to have dark brown or black body colouring. But, the deep water species that get very little daily sunlight are lighter shades of yellow and white.\n\nHow Do Echinoderms Reproduce?\n\nMost of the species have separate sexes (males and females) and, for the most part, reproduction is sexual. Thus, male sperm cells fertilise female eggs. But, some brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and starfishes can also reproduce asexually.\n\nAsexual Reproduction\n\nSome echinoderms display fragmentation, meaning they can divide their body into two (or more) parts. The same procedure is how some species regenerate missing body parts.\n\nSometimes, \"sexual reproduction\" fails to occur at all. But, the majority of asteroids, holothurians, and ophiuroids use fragmentation as the normal process for reproducing.\n\nSexual Reproduction\n\nGenerally speaking, echinoderm spawning is an annual occurrence that usually lasts four to eight (8) weeks. Even though some species spawn several times per year, the optimum months are spring and summer when the water gets warmer.\n\nFemale echinoderms that reproduce \"sexually\" cast several million eggs into the water column. At the same time, the males will shed their spermatozoa (a process called spawning) to fertilise the eggs.\n\nThreat and Predators\n\nThe major predators of echinoids are crabs, moray eels, octopuses, sharks, and some sea birds. Despite that, they have various defencive mechanisms that include sharp spines, venomous toxins, and the ability to discharge sticky entangling threads.\n\nImportant: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is a comprehensive source of information about the global conservation status of animals, fungi, and plants. Currently, the IUCN lists the pineapple sea cucumber (Thelenota ananas) as being \"Endangered\" (EN) and decreasing in population and the European edible sea urchin (Echinus esculentus) as \"Near Threatened\" (NT).\n\nEchinoderm Species List\n\nBrittle Stars\n\nFeather Stars\n\nSea Daisies\n\nSea Lilies\n\nDivers also enjoyed reading about..."
