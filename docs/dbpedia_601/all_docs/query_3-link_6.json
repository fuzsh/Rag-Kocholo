        "text": "Echinodermata\n\nThe Phylum Echinodermata is distinguished by characteristics such as spiny-skin, pentaradial symmetry, and an endoskeleton composed of calcareous ossicles. Given that all species in this phylum are exclusively marine dwellers, they also evolved a specialized water-vascular system. This includes several canals, that comprise part of a hydraulic system for functions such as the extension of limbs, movement, nutrient distribution, gas exchange and feeding [4]. Another fascinating aspect of Echinoderms is that the water vascular system also includes the tube feet with powerful suction capability. Due to the structural makeup of these organisms, largely in part to their calcareous plates, they dry and preserve well as both specimens and fossils."
