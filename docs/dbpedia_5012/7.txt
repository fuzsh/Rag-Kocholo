From the January 1st of 2018 HRT has HTV5, the specialized channel for Croatians in foreign countries and for the international public. Satellite signal is available in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. It broadcasts a selection of the content of four HRT national television channels and selection from the archival material.
