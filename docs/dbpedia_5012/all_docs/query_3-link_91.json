        "text": "One of the suspects arrested in an alleged plot to attack now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts in Austria this week had chemical substances and technical devices at his home, officials have revealed.\n\nThat individual, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots, was \"clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,\" Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, said on Thursday. The suspect quit his job on July 25 and made the statement \"that he still had big plans.\"\n\nOfficials also say investigators found ISIS and Al Qaeda materials at the home of the second suspect linked to the foiled plot – a 17-year-old Austrian with Turkish and Croatian roots, who had broken up with his girlfriend recently.\n\n\"He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made,\" Haijawi-Pirchner added, citing a full confession officials say the 19-year-old made.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT AUSTRIA CONCERTS CANCELED AFTER TERROR PLOT ARRESTS\n\nSwift was set to perform a trio of sold-out shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna starting today, drawing an estimated crowd of 170,000. The stadium now sits empty as the shows have been canceled, but London’s Metropolitan Police says a series of Swift concerts scheduled for next week in the United Kingdom will go along as planned.\n\n\"The situation surrounding the apparently planned terrorist attack in Vienna was very serious,\" Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer wrote Wednesday on X, but added that \"the threat was recognized early, combated and a tragedy prevented.\n\n\"Many thanks to the emergency services who are currently investigating at full speed. We live in a time in which violent means are being used to attack our western way of life,\" he also said. \"Islamist terrorism threatens security and freedom in many western countries.\"\n\nThe 19-year-old had downloaded manuals for bomb making and investigators found homemade explosives, detonators and hydrogen peroxide at his residence in Ternitz, south of Vienna, NBC News quoted Haijawi-Pirchner as saying.\n\nHaijawi-Pirchner reportedly added that investigators found videos and screenshots of home laboratories on both suspects' phones.\n\nNo other suspects are being sought after the two were arrested, though a 15-year-old who had been in contact with both suspects was also interrogated by police, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday in Vienna.\n\nKarner also said the foiled attack was planned for either Thursday or Friday and neither of the two suspects arrested had any tickets to the concerts.\n\nTheir names have not been publicly disclosed due to Austrian privacy rules.\n\nFranz Ruf, the public security director at Austria’s Interior Ministry, told public broadcaster ORF on Thursday that the 19-year-old suspect had uploaded an oath of allegiance to ISIS on an internet account a few weeks ago.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT ‘COMPLETELY IN SHOCK’ AFTER THIRD CHILD DEAD IN UK DANCE CLASS STABBING\n\nThe 17-year-old suspect, meanwhile, was arrested by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were supposed to take place.\n\nHe was employed a few days ago by a facility company providing services at the venue during the concerts, The Associated Press cited Austrian security officials as saying. Investigators revealed they found extensive material related to the Islamic State group and Al Qaeda at his home.\n\nEvent organizer Barracuda Music shared on Instagram that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\nSwift's website shared that all tickets will be automatically refunded within the next 10 business days.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Taylor Swift, the Eras Tour Vienna shows canceled due to government officials' confirmation of planned terrorist attack,\" Barracuda wrote Wednesday on Instagram. \"With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety.\""
