        "text": "The radio station is now fully digitalised with AEQ CAPITOL IP digital audio console.\n\nRadio Labin is a Croatian radio station that broadcasts from its central studios in the picturesque town of Labin. From there it has seen the profound change in the region, from its origins as the country's mining capital, to today as one of the main centres of rural tourism in the region. Radio Labin has always broadcast on 91.0FM and now broadcasts from numerous online platforms around the world, as well as from its comprehensive website https://radiolabin.hr/\n\nDuring the design of Radio Labin's new main studio, the company's technical management had clear requirements for its future audio mixer: it had to be digital and with IP connectivity given the high level of audio quality achieved and the ease of interconnection it allows, it also had to be a robust mixer ready for long uninterrupted working days, and finally it had to be simple to operate, allowing both qualified technicians and the youngest journalists to work with it. So the decision was finally made by Radio Labin, on the advice of Croatian integrator Radiocom, for the AEQ CAPITOL digital mixer.\n\nAEQ CAPITOL IP 12 is a 12-channel fixed configuration Digital Audio mixing console. In CAPITOL IP the implementation of IP connectivity is based on a single module of 16 input and 16 output channels, incorporated in its core. One of the main qualities of AEQ CAPITOL IP is the wide input capacity available: 4 mic/line, 12 analogue, 4 digital stereo AES/EBU (AES3), 2 digital stereo USB, 2 optional telephone lines, and optional digital multi-channel audio links; 16 AoIP channels over two ethernet connectors or 64 MADI channels input over optical fibre.\n\nInfo: www.aeq.eu & CALPRO *\n\n* Distributor for Hellas\n\nNotes: Press Release - AEQ - 20/12/2023"
