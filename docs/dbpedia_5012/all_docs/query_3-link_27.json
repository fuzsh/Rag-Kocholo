        "meta_description": "Croatian radio television (HRT) made a request for purchase for two identical digital TV outside broadcast vehicles (OB vans). After a long cooperative study between HRT and Sony engineers, the final system design and equipment specification was developed. The OB vans were built and delivered under HRTproject in less than 12 months. The OB vans are equipped with 8 digital TV cameras, 2 digital VTRs, disk recorder / slow motion, digital video switcher, character generator, digital audio console, intercom, etc. One of the first tests for technical staff and OB vans' equipment was the live TV transmission of the Croatian Women World Cup. For covering this World Cup slalom race with 18 cameras, two OB vans were connected together to become one large TV production facility. TV realization of Croatian FIS World Cup confirmed shooting and broadcasting of TV program on the very highest technical level. For HRT this was a great improvement over previous systems",
