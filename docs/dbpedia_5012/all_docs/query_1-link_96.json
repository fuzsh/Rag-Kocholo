        "text": "In any guide to the Croatian collections of the Library of Congress it is important to highlight digital resources. This section of the guide provides only a brief selection of freely available Croatian sites that are more useful for reference and discovery, than deep dives into specific subjects. It is by no means an attempt to provide a comprehensive list of what can be found on the Internet. Subscription electronic content from the Library of Congress is described on the page \"Onsite Only Electronic Resources.\"\n\nThe page is organized into the following sections:\n\nOnline Catalogs from Croatian Libraries\n\nDigital Collections from Croatia\n\nCroatian Language Internet News Sites\n\nEnglish Language Sites on Croatia\n\nThe online catalogs described below have been the most useful in general reference work about Croatia and in the preparation of various online guides about Croatian publications in the Library of Congress collections. Although there are several Croatian union catalogs with some overlapping content, they all have some unique materials.\n\nInformation about Croatia can be found on English-language sites from many realms such as news portals, newspapers, international organizations, and educational and cultural heritage institutions. Listed below is a small selection of such sites, for comprehensive coverage is impossible. In addition, other guides on Croatia created by the staff of the Library of Congress are described on the Introduction page of this guide."
