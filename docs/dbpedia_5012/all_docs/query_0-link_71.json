        "text": "This research studies the headlines representing migrants along the Balkan route in Bulgarian online news during the \" migrant crisis \" of 2015/2016, as well as the pictorial images that immediately follow the headlines. It compares the verbal and the visual representation of migrants and applies both critical discourse analysis and multimodal analysis. The study uses the term 'text' in a wider sense including both the verbal text and the pictorial display of migrants' social activities. The headlines develop two contradicting images of the migrants which are also reflected in the pictures. One of them is the image of poor and distressed people running away from the war in their home country. Europe for them is the Promised Land and they are presented with sympathy and compassion. The other image of the migrants is that of a natural disaster which cannot be stopped by country borders and threatens the stability on the continent.\n\nThis article examines the visual representation of refugees on the Croatian public broadcaster’s (HRT) online portal during the so-called European refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. A content analysis of 887 images is linked to the main research question of how refugees were represented and what this means for framing the refugee situation. I examine how the visual presentation of refugees relates to the dominant discourses on migration: discourses of victimhood or threat. The analysis concentrates on both the macro and micro levels following some assumptions of social semiotics, as well as research in psychology, media, and migration studies. The study finds that the visual presentation is strongly linked to the local context. The humanitarian approach and the visibilities of biological life and empathy were most prominent. Keywords: visual representation, refugee crisis, Croatian public broadcaster’s online portal, Identifiable victim effect, single victim effect, social semiotics\n\nIn recent years, a growing academic interest in both the theoretical and empirical examination of visual representations of migrants has become visible in the social sciences. Scholars coming from diverse disciplines have significantly contributed to our critical knowledge of the processes (e.g. depersonalisation, dehistorisation or orientalisation) and stereotypical representations through which migrants are depicted. The article expands on this research field and it examines the practices of visual communication among Facebook users, who actively contribute to online discussions on the issue of migration by creating and sharing topical visual material drawing upon the local and the international anti-immigrant content and context. In particular, it focuses on the visuals, which actively use the figures of humour, satire or parody in order to diminish the representatives of migration. The content of Facebook posts is approached in a complex way, and therefore visual as well as textual elements are analysed and their rhetorical strategies and intertextual references are also taken into consideration.\n\nThis paper analyses the visual frames of refugees and migrants that predominate in the media agenda of the main Western European countries, based on the study of the four levels of visual framing proposed by Rodríguez and Dimitrova [1]. The main objective is to identify the typology of symbolic frames that are most frequently transmitted in Western European media during the Mediterranean migration crisis, as well as the elements and attributes of denotative and stylistic nature that make up each of these frames. To this end, content analysis has been used as a methodological frame. The resulting findings offer a global vision of the visual treatment that the main European media are doing about the crisis, and how they mainly represent refugees and migrants. The analysis focuses on the four main and major news frames on displaced persons: normalization, victimization, burden and threat. The findings indicate that a typology of visual frames that represent the refugee and/or migrant as a victim, sufferer and in need, predominates in all media and countries. However, it has been found that the two frames of the most negative tendency, those that represent those subjects as a possible burden and/or threat to Western societies, surpass the other two frames in frequency. On the other hand, the denotative elements that contain each one of the symbolic frames are compared to know how they are constructed or what attributes conform in a specific way a type of framing or representation. In this regard, it has been found that displaced children and women tend to appear more frequently in normalization and victimization frames, while men and young people or adults appear more frequently in the burden and threat frames, usually in large groups of people that seems to be a mass, and showing religious elements and symbols.

In doing so, it focuses on the stereotypes about Romanians embedded in visuals published in national newspapers and on framing devices as semiotic resources. Using a qualitative and social semiotic approach, based on Kress and van Leeuwen's (1996/2006) framework, this article analyses 101 press photographs and captions from the digital editions of three Romanian newspapers (Adevărul, Gândul and Jurnalul Național), published during January 2013 – March 2014. By regarding the visuals as independently organized and structured messages, the analysis considers their positioning on the web page as well as their modes of representation, interaction, and composition (framing). The results show that the Romanian media reinforce especially the categorization of Roma people and three dominant visual frames emerge: the public security, economic and employment frames. The Romanian press is conflicted about its own national representation, dismissing the stereotypes about migrants only after having fully imported the frames from the British press. Résumé Cet article aborde le rôle de les nouvelles photos dans les cadrages médiatiques de les roumains migrer au Royaume-Uni et la construction de l'immigration comme une probléme sociale, considerér le contexte de la libre circulations des travailleurs dans le Grande Bretagne. La discussion se concentrera aux les stéréotypes sur les roumains dans les images diffusées par la presse quotidienne nationale roumain et le cadre-dispositif comme ressource sémiotique. Méthodologiquement, sera employé une recherche qualitative et une approche sémiotique sociale basée sur le modèl proposé par Kress et van Leeuwen (1996/2006), pour analyser 101 photographies de presse et leur légendes, publié en Janvier 2013 – Mars 2014 dans les éditions digitales des trois journaux roumaines (Adevărul, Gândul et Jurnalul Național). Ainsi, considérer les visuelles organisés indépendant et comme messages structurés, l'analyse se concentrera au le positionnement de site web et aux les modes de représentation, interaction et composition (cadres). Les résultats démontre que les média en Roumanie renforce la catégorization des Roms et trois cadrages visuelles dominantes émerge: les cadrages de la sécurité publique, de l'économie et du travail. La presse roumaine est confuse de sa représentation nationale, rejeter les stéréotypes sur les migrantes depuis importer les cadrages médiatiaques de la presse bretonne.\n\nThe aim of this research was to find out how refugees and migrants were narratively constructed and represented in selected Croatian daily newspapers during the migrant crisis in 2015 and 2016. We were interested to determine whether such people were addressed in the articles as \"refugees\" or \"migrants\", whether they were commonly portrayed as victims or as a threat, and if Croatia and the neighbouring countries were represented as a refugee-friendly or refugee-hostile country. We present the results of quantitative content analysis and narrative analysis of articles on refugees and migrants published in three of Croatia's most read daily newspapers (Jutarnji list, Večernji list and 24 sata) in different periods during the crisis.\n\nThis work analyses the denotative and connotative visual framing of migrants and refugees in European media during the migration crisis in Europe in general and in the Mediterranean in particular. The main objective is to identify the differences between Germany, the country that receives the most asylum requests, and other Western Europe countries (Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom). The second goal is to detect temporal differences between the first period of the crisis (2013-2014) and the second period (2015-2017), when the conflict worsened. We content analysed a sample of 500 news photographs from 10 media outlets of five European countries. The results indicate that the most predominant visual frame represents migrants and refugees as victims. However, it was also observed that the frames depicting these individuals as a threat to Western societies are more frequent in German media, and also during the second period of the crisis. JEL Classification: Z130\n\nIn this paper, we analyse how news images of the 2015 Syrian refugee 'crisis' visualise refugees and how, in so doing, they mobilise various forms of moral responsibility in 'our' mediated public life – various practical dispositions of action towards the misfortunes of migrants and refugees at Europe's border. On the basis of empirical material from European news (June-December 2015), we construct a typology of visibilities of the 'crisis', each of which situates refugees within a different regime of visibility and claim to action: i) visibility as biological life, associated with monitorial action; ii) visibility as empathy associated with charitable action; iii) visibility as threat, associated with state security; iv) visibility as hospitality, associated with political activism; and v) visibility as self-reflexivity, associated with a post-humanitarian engagement with people like 'us'. In conclusion, we argue that, important as these five categories of visibility are in introducing public dispositions to action towards the vulnerable, they nonetheless ultimately fail to humanise migrants and refugees. This failure to portray them as human beings with lives that are worth sharing should compel us, we urge, to radically rethink how we understand the media's responsibility towards vulnerable others."
