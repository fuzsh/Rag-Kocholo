        "text": "Television stations are seeing growth in revenues.\n\nCroatian television stations have been posting better business results in the last few years, and that was seen in 2015 as well. Three national television stations (Croatian Radio Television, Nova TV and RTL) have been operating in the green since 2013, reports Poslovni.hr on September 22, 2016.\n\nLast year, Croatian Radio Television, which is financed through both licence fee and advertising, had 1.4 billion kuna in revenues, with profits of 18 million kuna. The number of employees was reduced to 2,799, while the average salary of employees at the public broadcaster was 7,361 kuna.\n\nThe second place belonged to Nova TV, with 395 million kuna in revenues. Although Nova TV has been profitable since 2013, the profits dropped from 9 million kuna in 2014 to just 167,800 kuna last year. It employs 325 people, and the average salary is 9,297 kuna, which is the highest average salary among all national television stations. Nova TV is also the most popular among TV stations with highest average ratings, both for its news and entertainment programmes.\n\nThe third is RTL, with revenues which stood at 284 million kuna. That station posted losses in 2012 of 89 million kuna, but has since been operating with a profit. In 2013, it had a profit of 6 million kuna, while in 2015 its profits stood at 1.5 million kuna. RTL has 237 employees, and their average salary is 8,687 kuna.\n\nLast year, all the specialized and local television stations also posted profits, except for TV Istria and Sport TV, which is being financed by the Croatian Olympic Committee despite the losses which reach 20 million kuna a year.\n\nAmong local television stations, the largest revenues (10.8 million kuna) were posted by OTV from Zagreb, which also had a minimal profit. It was followed by Mre≈æa TV, with 9.3 million kuna in revenues and profits of 289,900 kuna, Kanal Ri from Rijeka with 7.5 million kuna in revenues and 389,700 kuna in profits, and finally Z1 from Zagreb, with 7.3 million kuna in revenues and 1.2 million kuna in profits.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
