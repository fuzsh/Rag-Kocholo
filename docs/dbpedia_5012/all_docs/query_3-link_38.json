        "text": "RICHMOND, Va. – Head Coach Martu Loncarica is excited to announce the addition of Sierra Espeland to the University of Richmond field hockey coaching staff as the Volunteer Goalkeeper Coach.\n\nEspeland, a native of Fredericksburg, Va., heads to Crenshaw Field after spending the 2023 season on the Mary Washington hockey staff as an assistant coach, working with the goalkeepers. She is also currently the director of the U16 and U19 teams at Panthers, a club field hockey program in Richmond.\n\nAs a four-year starting goalkeeper (2018-2022) for the University of Vermont Catamounts, Espeland finished her career as the program's all-time leader in career wins (39) and wins in a single season (13). She is also in the top 10 in program history in saves (391), shutouts (13) and has four of the top five lowest goals against average in a season (2022, 1.40). In 2022, Espeland was named America East Goalkeeper of the Year, the second in Vermont program history, adding to her America East first team (2022) and second team (2021) accolades.\n\nEspeland started playing with the US Women's National Indoor Team in 2016 and helped the squads win gold in 2017 and 2021 at the Pan American Cup. She was also a member of the 2018 US Indoor World Cup Team and served as a captain for the U21 National Indoor Team at the 2019 Croatia Cup.\n\nEspeland also has made coaching stops at St. Michael's College (Colchester, Vermont) and at Green Mountain Field Hockey club (Williston, Vermont) after completing her Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering at Vermont in May of 2021. In spring of 2019, Espeland served as a goalkeeper coach for the USA Field Hockey Futures program in the northeast region site."
