It broadcasts a selection of the content of four HRT national television channels and selection from the archival material.\n\nFrom 2015, all programming features produced by HRT are available to users at any time with no extra charge on the HRTi multimedia service.\n\nThe main bodies of HRT are: the General Manager, the Management of HRT, the Supervisory Board and the Programme Council.\n\nThe General Manager of Croatian Radio Television is appointed by the Croatian Parliament for a term of five years.\n\nThe Management of HRT consists of the General Manager and the heads of the units of the Croatian Radio Television - the Programme, the Production, the Technology and the Business Director.\n\nThe Supervisory Board consists of five members, four of which are appointed by the Parliament and one is directly elected by the employees of HRT.

Nine of them are determined by the Parliament (Committee on Information, Computerisation and the Media), chosen among prominent people from scientific, cultural and other institutions as well as from civil-society organisations. Two members are directly elected by HRT employees. Programme Council members have a four years mandate, but half of them leave after two years.\n\nThe work of the Council is public and their main duties are to represent and protect the public's interest by conducting program oversight and improving the radio and audiovisual program.\n\nThe HRT Council names an HRT Commissioner responsible for complaints and suggestions from viewers, listeners and other HRT users.\n\nHRT is a member of the EBU and has an active role in many international television and radio organizations and associations.\n\nHRT CENTRES\n\nRegion - Slavonia (Eastern Croatia)\n\nHRT Center Osijek\n\nAdress: Šamačka 13, 31000 Osijek\n\nPhone: +385 31 225 560\n\nMail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
