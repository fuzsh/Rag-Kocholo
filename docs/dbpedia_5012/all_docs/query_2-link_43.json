        "text": "Zagreb City Museum responded to the invited competition of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia to conduct rescue archaeological investigations along the course of the future Zagreb – Sisak motorway. The museum was considered an institution with great experience and capable of successfully organising, running and giving logistic support to a big project like this. And so Zagreb City Museum signed contracts with the Ministry of Culture to conduct the investigation.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009 the museum carried out investigations at several sites located along the course of the future motorway belonging in geographical terms to the Turopolje region and administratively to Zagrebačka County. This means the site called Šepkovčica, an area of 50,000 square metres, investigated in the period from 2006 to 2008; the sites Okuje I, II, Ia, IIa and IIIb, with a total area of 49,000 square metres; and the site of Mraclinska Dubrava, with an area of 2,800 square metres, investigated in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe head of the investigation was Aleksandra Bugar, archaeologist and curator at Zagreb City Museum, who had acquired experience on big rescue archaeology projects relating to the motorways of Slovenia and in a number of other sites in Croatia.\n\nDuring the long-lasting investigations, which were highly demanding in terms of organisation, extensive in their scope, and very complex in professional and technical terms, the large expert team was composed of archaeologists and many ABDs and students of the Archaeology Department of Zagreb University. The core professional team, along with the head of the research, consisted of Želimir Škoberne, museum adviser, and Boris Mašić, senior curator, as consultants, Iva Marochini, an outsource ZCM consultant, as well as archaeologists from the firm Kaducej d.o.o., Josip Burmaz, Dženi Los, Nikša Vujnović, Nikolina Antonić and Anita Sičić, who made an enormous contribution to the successful conducting of the archaeological investigations. Also taking part in the research was a numerous auxiliary technical crew and a team of manual labourers for the excavations done by hand. On a daily basis, there would be a team of over 100 people on average working on the sites. A large number of domestic and foreign experts were engaged on matters of assessment and analysis, conservation and restoration.\n\nThe operations are still going on, studying the finds from prehistoric, ancient and medieval periods found at these sites; how demanding this task is can be seen not only in the process of identification and evaluation, but also in the number of objects. There are more than 100,000 individual potsherds, over 800 metal objects, about 150 glass and bone objects, and over 330 ancient coins, wooden cladding from 18 wells, countless amounts of daub, brick and tile fragments, animal bones, slag and so on.\n\nRESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS"
