        "text": "TV is the main source of news, followed by the internet. As well as a digital terrestrial TV (DTT) service, there are established cable, satellite and internet protocol TV (IPTV) operators.\n\nPublic broadcaster HRT is funded by advertising and a licence fee. It faces stiff competition from private networks, including leading national station Nova TV, which is owned by a US investment company.\n\nRadio is a popular medium, with national and local commercial networks operating alongside public HRT.\n\nAustrian and German media companies have stakes in the print media. A tabloid, 24 Sata, is the best-selling newspaper. In line with worldwide trends, circulation figures for the printed press are falling.\n\nReporters face harassment and occasional attacks, says US-based Freedom House. Reporters without Borders says government \"meddling\" at HRT is a problem.\n\nThere were 3.7 million internet users by December 2021, comprising 92% of the population (Internetworldstats.com)."
