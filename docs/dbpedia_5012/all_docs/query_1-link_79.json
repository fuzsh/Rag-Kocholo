To remind the world not to take food for granted, but to treat it with care. Respecting food is the only way we can ensure a better future. And as a brand that believes in a better future, every day we’re working toward developing new technologies that fight food waste. That’s our mission.\n\nBy adopting Respect Food initiative with a strong eco conscience, we champion the cause of reducing food waste. Our «Respect Food» initiative aims to inspire everyone to fight with us, by showing people how to tackle waste in kitchens with innovative products and partnerships. That‘s how we manage to save more than 50 tonnes of food being wasted till today.\n\nLet’s #RespectFood together.\n\nThe only way to push quality forward is by joining brilliance.\n\nBased on our shared values for quality, aesthetics and ethics we’re collaborating with the world-renowned chef, one of the most influential people by Time magazine; Massimo Bottura.\n\n«Little things we do in our home have great impact outside», that’s our common belief with Massimo Bottura. Thanks to his influential power, our aim is to inspire people at home to pursue a better future.\n\nHomes. Massimo. Grundig. Our planet. Everything connected as one.\n\nThat‘s how we imagine Grundig coming together as an honest, relevant and unique home brand. We‘re in the right place, at the right time, with the right partner."
