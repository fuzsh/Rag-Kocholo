(Brown, Oakes, Timm, Vejoda)

In the navy

In the navy

Every navy mans the right guy

Everyone gives him the bright eye

And the navy they do right by

To a sailor

To a sailor

All the world is just his main street

When you′re in the navy

You're in the worlds best gleam

First you take your training as a boot

Swing a hammock navigate & shoot

Jump open ships & subs & planes

The seven seas are open lane

When the bow is down with Davy Jones

Folks will welcome home their rolling stones

For every navy mans a king

And you′ll hear everybody sing

Here comes the navy

Break out the red, white & blue

Here comes the navy

Fighting & sea going through

Make way for navy

Navy with anchors aweigh

Everybody loves the navy of the USA

First you take your training as a boot

Swing a hammock & navigate & shoot

Jump open ships & in subs & in planes

The seven seas are open lane

Here it comes, here it comes, here comes the navy

Sing a song of good cheer because the navy is here

Everybody loves the navy of the USA
