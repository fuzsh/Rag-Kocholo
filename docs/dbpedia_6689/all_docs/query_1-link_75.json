The song was a co-write by Baldwin and Ethan Hulse, Rita Springer and Mark Harris.\n\nBaldwin’s first solo project with Bethel Music, The War Is Over, debuted to critical acclaim in May 2017. Inspired by Baldwin’s cross country move with his family from North Carolina to California, The War Is Over reflects synonymous themes of taking an appointed journey into the unknown, motivated by the hope of promises that lie ahead. https://youtu.be/oFizRY8w0-I"
