        "text": "Singer-songwriter Robert Earl Keen makes his 10th appearance on Mountain Stage, recorded live on the campus of West Virginia University in Morgantown. One of roots music's most beloved and enduring performers, Keen first gained notice for his holiday song \"Merry Christmas From the Family.\" But it was the release of his album Picnicin 1997 that demonstrated his depth as a songwriter â€” and helped herald the coming of the Americana genre.\n\nKeen appears here alongside the same road band he's used for decades, including Rich Brotherton on lead guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass, Marty Muse on pedal steel and Tom Van Schaik on drums. Keen's set features songs from his most recent release, Ready for Confetti, as well as \"Corpus Christi Bay,\" a classic from earlier in his career. He also plays a cover of Todd Snider's \"Play a Train Song.\"\n\nSet List\n\n\"Ready For Confetti\"\n\n\"Who Do Man\"\n\n\"Play A Train Song\"\n\n\"Corpus Christi Bay\"\n\n\"I Gotta Go\"\n\nCopyright 2021 NPR.
