Muster rolls may contain such information as a soldier’s name, rank, age, birthplace, residence, occupation, enlistment date and location, muster-in date and location, mustering officer, term of enlistment, pay dates and amounts, and transfer and promotion data. The rolls may also list deserters and killed, ill, or discharged soldiers. Amounts spent for clothing or provisions for companies or the regiment as a whole are among the items found in accounts. Depreciation certificates were issued to soldiers to be redeemed at a later date, as Continental currency by 1780 was worthless. Correspondence includes missives from Delaware’s Council of Safety, military correspondence, a list of loyalist prisoners taken by Haslet’s regiment at Mamaroneck, New York, reports on the course of the war from officers to various Delaware officials, and communications between Delaware leaders. Lists of pensioners detail the name, rank, amount of pension, and residence of the pensioner. Pay rolls and regiment returns list the name, rank, and time of service of soldiers and officers. Petitions include officers requesting payment, former President McKinly’s request for reimbursement, and persons convicted of treason seeking leniency.\n\nThe vast majority of items are published in the first three volumes of the Delaware Archives: Military. Volumes IV and V of the Archives, dealing with the War of 1812, are not listed here. The sixth volume listed here, containing miscellaneous Revolutionary War items, was collated but remains unpublished.

Pension rolls from 1790 through 1846 are included (although not for every year inclusive). Pension rolls and correspondence are interspersed. A rough chronological order is followed.\n\nCorrespondence includes reports from the Treasury Department to loan agents concerning payment or inquiries about discrepancies, letters from the Navy Department after 1812, instructions on the issuing of money to heirs of pensioners, charts for determining payment, statements certifying the guardians of heirs, instructions on the payment of “half-pay” pensioners, and instructions on determining eligibility.\n\nOnly after 1822 do we find correspondence from individuals other than government officials or loan officers. This includes instructions for payment, statements certifying that an individual was the heir of a pensioner, and letters from physicians certifying disability.\n\n21.
