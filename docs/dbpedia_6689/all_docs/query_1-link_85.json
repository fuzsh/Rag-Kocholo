        "text": "ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS DREAM: Dexter Romweber died Friday, Feb. 16, reportedly of natural causes. He was a man as inextricably identified with Athens as with his hometown of Carrboro, NC. His band, Flat Duo Jets, rose to more-than-local prominence by virtue of its inclusion in the 1986 film Athens, Ga: Inside/Out. Its explosive presence therein caused no little controversy at the time due to the band having been recent transplants to town at the time. Dexter was a lifelong devotee to his beloved rockabilly, as well as folk and roots rock, and a fiery performer. The Jets broke up at least once before reuniting to start a proper recording career circa 1990 and left an impressively large discography. His post-Jets career was a mix of solo escapades, brief collaborations and his Dexter Romweber Duo, in which he played with his sister, Sara Romweber (Snatches of Pink, Let’s Active). While thrillingly exciting, and excitable, Dexter also often cut a tragic figure and was preceded in death by Sara, his mother Sara, and two brothers, Joe and Luke. His influence is writ large across the culture through acts like the White Stripes and on celluloid via the 2006 documentary Two Headed Cow, which was directed by Inside/Out director Tony Gayton. His most recent release was last year’s full-length album Good Thing Going. In a 1985 interview with The Red & Black, a then-19-year-old Dexter remarked, “I just want to make music onstage and in the studio for the rest of my life.” He was 57 years old.\n\nWAVE OF MUTILATION: Monsoon, still riding a wave of critical and popular acclaim for its 2022 album Ghost Party, is set to undertake a huge tour the week after this news is published. Beginning Mar. 8 in Nashville, the now-duo will play shows across the Midwest, Southwest and the West Coast before winding up in Atlanta on Apr. 13 at The Earl. Monsoon is a solid lesson in growing incrementally over the course of several years, honing one’s style sharper than a prison shank, and staying completely true to art for its own sake. Follow along at facebook.com/monsoonmusic, and listen in at monsoonband.bandcamp.com.\n\nWATCH THE WORLD FROM YOUR WINDOW: Former lead singer for The Good Looks Mitchell Blanton has released his very first solo single. It’s a fairly upbeat, breezy country-influenced tune named “Might As Well,” and what’s most impressive right off the bat is its stellar production qualities. Literally nothing about this says “local record.” It’s as pro as anything else you’re likely to hear out of Athens this year. It’s also hella enjoyable and a nice new benchmark for Blanton himself. Find this on Spotify and other services.\n\nTHE PICTURE’S CHANGING, EVERY MOMENT: Willow Avalon may be the daughter of musician and songwriter Jim White, but she’s done an extraordinary job of carving her own identity. Newly signed to Atlantic Records, she’ll celebrate the release of her debut EP for the label, titled Stranger, on Thursday, Feb. 29 at The Georgia Theatre, where she’ll be opening for “American Idol” finalist and Atlantic Records labelmate Briston Maroney. Avalon plays a very smoothed-out version of classic Americana-ish pop music, sometimes decorated with her signature vocal trill, which can be a curious distraction at first but then becomes a nice defining aspect. For a wonderful introduction, please check out her debut single “Drivin” from 2021. This show sold out immediately, so you’re out of luck there, but the internet is always open, so find her music on major streaming services.\n\nSEE FOR YOURSELF: It’s only been about a thousand years since we heard any news from singer-songwriter Scott Low. Well, he’s releasing his newest album, The Appalachian Blues, Friday, Mar. 1. Through these 11 songs, Low delivers a set of country blues and some other closely associated styles, with the highpoint very likely being “Worn Out Shoes.” Low will play the next night, Saturday, Mar. 2, at The Foundry opening for Athens jammy-boogie band Heart Of Pine, which will also have released its newest single, “Movin’ On,” the previous day. This particular track features guest background vocals by Betsy Franck and Ansley Stewart, and is one of three singles leading up to an LP release this July. For more information on each, please see heartofpineband.com and facebook.com/ScottLowSongs.\n\nTRY IT OUT: Norman Baldwin, one half of the duo Dooley & Baldwin, has released a full-length solo album named Jigsaw. His collaborator on this is Bobby Cole, who wrote and produced the music while Baldwin handled lyrics and vocal melodies. Much like his work in Dooley & Baldwin, his signature earnestness and lyrical honesty are the hallmarks of this release. Most of this fits into a solidly traditional pop-rock tradition, but the standout track here is the achingly personal piano-based tune “Pain Has Made Me Whole.” This isn’t for everyone, but nothing ever is.
