        "text": "On one of my initial panels as a first-time novelist, when asked what authors inspired me in my writing, I replied, “I was probably influenced as much by Steve Earle and Steely Dan as anybody I read.”\n\nI stand by that.\n\nI started my creative life as an accompanist for two superb women vocalists on the coffee-house circuit (billing myself as “The World’s Most Adequate Guitarist”), and then joined a bar band and toured the Midwest, performing in such famed musical Meccas as Kokomo, Indiana; Ypsilanti, Michigan; and Lima, Ohio. (Best compliment I ever got: “Who’s the guy who sings like a chick, he’s really good.”)\n\nMusic has always had a profound effect on me (my paternal grandfather was a music teacher). My first obsession was folk music, and I was particularly fond of revival stalwarts like Judy Collins, Tom Paxton, Odetta, Pete Seeger, and Dave Van Ronk.\n\nIt was from them, especially the traditionalists, that I gained an appreciation for the story song, especially old ballads such as “Pretty Polly,” “Barbara Allen,” and “John Riley.”\n\nBut the songs I came to love most deeply were written by the musicians themselves, which made them more personal. And looking back, I can see that I learned a number of writing lessons from those efforts.\n\nGranted, in general songs bear a greater resemblance to poetry than narrative, and they have the twin advantages of rhyme and music to bring their messages home. What I’ll be talking about here are songs that do indeed tell a story with the familiar beginning-middle-end structure.\n\nNOTE: If you’re unacquainted with the songs I mention below, I’ve provided links to their Youtube videos.\n\nTom Paxton: “My Son John”\n\nThis Tom Paxton original from 1966 really affected me, possibly more than the traditional ballads, because of its relevance to the Vietnam War and my own close relationship with my father:\n\nMy son, John, was a good boy, and good to me\n\nWhen we had hard times, well, he stood by me\n\nWe were in work and out of work and on the go\n\nIf he had complaints, I never heard a-one\n\nHe would pitch in and help me like a full-grown man\n\nMy son, John. John, my son\n\nMy son, John, went to college and he made his way\n\nHad to earn every penny, but he paid his way\n\nHe worked summers and holidays and through the year\n\nAnd it was no easy struggle that he won\n\nBut he laughed at the ones who thought he had it hard\n\nMy son, John. John, my son\n\nMy son, John, got his uniform and went away\n\nWith a band playing marches, he was sent away\n\nAnd he wrote me a letter when he had the time\n\nHe was losing his buddies one by one\n\nAnd I prayed and tried not to read between the lines\n\nMy son, John. John, my son\n\nMy son, John, came home yesterday, he’s here to stay\n\nNot a word to his father have I heard him say\n\nHe seems glad to be home, but I can’t be sure\n\nWhen I asked him what he’d seen and done\n\nHe went up to his bedroom, and he closed the door\n\nMy son, John, John my son\n\nHe went up to his bedroom, and he closed the door\n\nMy son, John, John my son\n\nThis is a classic example of less is more, in that it’s not made clear what the son has “seen and done”—that’s left to our imagination, and it’s all the more powerful because of that, especially after the long buildup showing the relationship between father and son and the profound respect the former has for the latter.\n\nAlso, the last two lines are repeated, which provides a haunting effect—something hard to duplicate literally in fiction. Instead we have to find ways to repeat an imagine or an idea indirectly so that the association is made unconsciously—for example, the use of water, fish, glass, and eyes in the screenplay for Chinatown. (For more on how to employ this technique, see John Truby’s discussion of symbol system in The Anatomy of Story.)\n\nThe Beatles: “Norwegian Wood”\n\nSpeaking of less-is-more—the first song that I realized was an actual short story was “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)” from Rubber Soul by The Beatles:\n\nI once had a girl\n\nOr should I say\n\nShe once had me\n\nShe showed me her room\n\nIsn’t it good\n\nNorwegian wood\n\nShe asked me to stay\n\nAnd she told me to sit anywhere\n\nSo I looked around\n\nAnd I noticed there wasn’t a chair\n\nI sat on a rug\n\nBiding my time\n\nDrinking her wine\n\nWe talked until two\n\nAnd then she said\n\n“It’s time for bed”\n\nShe told me she worked in the morning\n\nAnd started to laugh\n\nI told her I didn’t\n\nAnd crawled off to sleep in the bath\n\nAnd when I awoke\n\nI was alone\n\nThis bird had flown\n\nSo I lit a fire\n\nIsn’t it good\n\nNorwegian wood\n\nAbove and beyond the double-entendre in the first verse, or the twist ending, with its menace only enhanced by its ambiguity, this was my introduction to minimalism—nice preparation for my future reading of Raymond Carver. The actual story is incredibly spare, but no less evocative for that. And the tension between the man and the woman is palpable, despite the seemingly romantic setup. That tension lies in the details: Who had whom?… Why tell him to sit when there isn’t a chair:… He’s “biding his time” and at last gets rewarded with “It’s time for bed,” only to be laughed at and the “crawling off” to sleep in the bath. It’s hard to imagine establishing such an atmosphere of sociable hostility in so few words, but Lennon pulls it off.\n\n(Interesting side note: one commentator from a conservative Catholic magazine presumed the song was about a straight man trying to pick up a lesbian. The same writer opined that “Strawberry Fields” was about a man on acid stumbling onto a dead body at a party, and “I’m Only Sleeping” was about masturbation. For some more interesting background on this song and its meaning, go here.)\n\nTownes Van Zandt: “Pancho and Lefty”\n\nAs the sixties gave way to the seventies, the folkies morphed into singer-songwriters, exemplified by such luminaries as Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Rickie Lee Jones, John Prine, Sandy Denny, James Taylor, Phoebe Snow, Steve Goodman, and my two personal favorites, Randy Newman and Leonard Cohen.\n\nBut it was “Pancho and Lefty” by Townes Van Zandt that had the biggest impact on me at that time. Emmylou Harris introduced me to the tune. It’s been covered by a great many others, including Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, though for my money, except for Emmylou and Townes himself, no one’s done it justice like Jason Isbell and Elizabeth Cook.\n\nLiving on the road my friend\n\nIs gonna keep you free and clean\n\nNow you wear your skin like iron\n\nYour breath as hard as kerosene\n\nYou weren’t your mama’s only boy\n\nBut her favorite one, it seems\n\nShe began to cry when you said goodbye\n\nAnd sank into your dreams\n\nPancho was a bandit boy, his horse as fast as polished steel\n\nHe wore his gun outside his pants\n\nFor all the honest world to feel\n\nPancho met his match you know in the desert down in Mexico\n\nNobody heard his dyin words, ah but that’s the way it goes\n\nAll the Federales say, they could’ve had him any day\n\nThey only let him slip away, out of kindness I suppose\n\nLefty can’t sing the blues all night long like he used to\n\nThe dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty’s mouth\n\nThe day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio\n\nWhere he got the bread to go, there ain’t nobody knows\n\nAll the Federales say, they could’ve had him any day\n\nThey only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose\n\nThe poets tell how old Pancho fell, and Lefty’s livin in a cheap hotel\n\nThe desert’s quiet, Cleveland’s cold\n\nAnd so the story ends we’re told\n\nPancho needs your prayers it’s true, but save a few for Lefty too\n\nHe only did what he had to do, and now he’s growing old\n\nAll the Federales say, they could’ve had him any day\n\nThey only let him go so long, out of kindness I suppose\n\nA few gray Federales say, they could’ve had him any day\n\nThey only let him go so long, out of kindness I suppose\n\nFirst, who knew a song could have a prologue? And like any good prologue, it acts like an overture, providing an atmospheric/thematic setup without introducing any information that will be presented in what follows. Better yet, it’s in second person, creating a mysterious ambiguity: which of the two characters in the song is the singer addressing? And then it ends with the eerily evocative, “And sank into your dreams” (with a minor chord change to emphasize the haunting effect).\n\nNext, one by one we’re introduced to the two eponymous characters, with their stories laid out briefly by no less dramatically for that. Each has its elements of both irony and pathos. The couplet, “The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty’s mouth” is one of those lines you never forget, a reminder that stories need a little poetry, too. (An equally haunting couplet is “The desert’s quiet, Cleveland’s cold/And so the story ends we’re told.”)\n\nThe ending concludes with equal attention to both characters. The Judas character normally only earns our contempt, but the song tempers that judgment with, “He only did what he had to do” (though we’re left wondering why he had to do it). And the poignant, “And now he’s growing old” lets us know that Lefty no more escaped the consequences of his actions than Pancho did.\n\nFinally, the ending refrains, instead of repeating exactly, have the last one altering “All the federales” to “A few gray federales,” suggesting it’s not just Lefty who’s getting ever closer to death, while the legend of Pancho remains alive.\n\nIncidentally, introductory sections to songs like the “prologue” mentioned above were by no means unusual in the days of Tin Pan Alley. A classic example is “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg for The Wizard of Oz. Their version included an intro section that was dropped in the film:\n\nWhen all the world is a hopeless jumble\n\nAnd the raindrops tumble all around\n\nHeaven opens a magic lane\n\nWhen all the clouds darken up the skyway\n\nThere’s a rainbow highway to be found\n\nLeading from your windowpane\n\nTo a place behind the sun\n\nJust a step beyond the rain\n\nThis omission was a sign of things to come—these introductory verses were usually dropped from songs when singers performed them in subsequent years, and composers stopped writing them. To hear how this song sounds with the introduction, try this version by the young French singer Marie Oppert.\n\nRobert Earl Keen, Jr.: “The Road Goes On Forever”\n\nBy the 1980s three singer-songwriters had pretty much become the focus of my interest in the genre: Steve Earle, John Hiatt, and Robert Earl Keen, Jr. And for my money, there are few story songs better than “The Road Goes On Forever:”\n\nSherry was a waitress at the only joint in town\n\nShe had a reputation as a girl who’d been around\n\nDown Main Street after midnight, brand new pack of cigs\n\nA fresh one hangin’ from her lips, a beer between her legs\n\nShe rides down to the river to meet with all her friends\n\nThe road goes on forever and the party never ends\n\nSonny was a loner, older than the rest\n\nHe was goin’ in the Navy but couldn’t pass the test\n\nSo he hung around town, he sold a little pot\n\nThe law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught\n\nBut he was back in business when they set him free again\n\nThe road goes on forever and the party never ends\n\nThey soon ran out of money but Sonny knew a man\n\nWho knew some Cuban refugees that dealt in contraband\n\nSonny met the Cubans in a house just off the route\n\nWith a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot\n\nThe cards were on the table when the law came bustin’ in\n\nThe road goes on forever and the party never ends\n\nThe Cubans grabbed the goodies, Sonny grabbed a jack\n\nHe broke a bathroom window and climbed on out the back\n\nSherry drove the pickup through the alley on the side\n\nWhere a lawman tackled Sonny and was readin’ him his rights\n\nShe stepped out in the alley with a single-shot .410\n\nThe road goes on forever and the party never ends\n\nThey left the lawman lyin’ and they made their getaway\n\nGot back to the motel just before the break of day\n\nSonny gave her all the money and he blew a little kiss\n\n“If they ask you how this happened, say I forced you into this”\n\nShe watched him as his taillights disappeared around the bend\n\nThe road goes on forever and the party never ends\n\nIt’s Main Street after midnight just like it was before\n\nTwenty-one months later at the local grocery store\n\nSherry buys a paper and a cold six-pack of beer\n\nThe headlines read that Sonny is goin’ to the chair\n\nShe pulls back onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz\n\nThe road goes on forever and the party never ends\n\nNote the up-front introduction of the characters, much like “Pancho and Lefty.” The depiction of Sherry in particular is vivid because of the “brand new pack of cigs/A fresh one hangin’ from her lips, a beer between her legs.” The language and imagery combine to let us know exactly who she is, even before we get to the iconic river rendezvous with her friends. That attention to detail continues with Sonny’s inability to get into the Navy, his playing eightball (not just pool), the quart of Bombay gin, the single-shot .410.\n\nThe song also has a perfect cause-and-effect development with its share of twists, right up until the final line. And bringing the story back around at the conclusion to where it began is a classic story-telling device, showing how, after all that’s happened, things remain the same, just different.\n\nFinally, it has that special something a song has that’s hard to duplicate in fiction: the echoing refrain. I mentioned above how you have to find subtle ways to do that in short stories and novels, but even the ablest translation of the technique in fiction would have a hard time duplicating the specific nuance given the use of those exact same words—The road goes on forever, and the party never ends—at the conclusion of every verse, not to mention the twist at the end.\n\nJohn Hiatt: “Tennessee Plates”\n\nJohn Hiatt was probably the best musician of this group, but his lyrics were equally fine. One of his earliest tunes, “Tennessee Plates,” was an excellent example of his gift for phrasing, his humor, and his fondness for outré characters:\n\nI woke up in a hotel and didn’t know what to do\n\nTurned the TV on and wrote a letter to you\n\nThe news was talkin’ ’bout a dragnet up on the interstate\n\nSaid they were lookin’ for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates\n\nSince I left California baby, things have gotten worse\n\nSeems the land of opportunity for me is just a curse\n\nTell that judge in Bakersfield my trial will have to wait\n\nDown here they’re lookin’ for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates\n\nIt was somewhere in Nevada, it was cold outside\n\nShe was shiverin’ in the dark, so I offered her a ride\n\nThree bank jobs later, four cars hot-wired\n\nWe crossed the Mississippi like an oil slick fire\n\nIf they’d known what we was up to they wouldn’t ‘a let us in\n\nWe landed in Memphis like original sin\n\nUp Elvis Presley Boulevard to the Graceland gates\n\nSee we were lookin’ for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates\n\nWell, there must have been a dozen of them parked in that garage\n\nThere wasn’t one Lincoln and there wasn’t one Dodge\n\nThere wasn’t one Japanese model or make\n\nJust pretty, pretty Cadillacs with Tennessee plates\n\nShe saw him singing once when she was seventeen\n\nAnd ever since that day she’s been living in between\n\nI was never king of nothin’ but this wild weekend\n\nAnyway he wouldn’t care, hell he gave them to his friends\n\nWell this ain’t no hotel I’m writin’ you from\n\nIt’s the Tennessee prison up at Brushy Mountain\n\nWhere yours sincerely’s doin’ five to eight\n\nStampin’ out my time makin’ Tennessee plates\n\nThis might be the most hilarious tale of car theft in the annals of songwriting. Again, the inventive phrasing (“We crossed the Mississippi like an oil slick fire”…”We landed in Memphis like original sin”) kicks things along nicely. And the comedic twist ending is something of a Hiatt trademark. (For another example, check out “Trudy and Dave.”)\n\nSteve Earle: “Copperhead Road”\n\nAs mentioned at the outset, Steve Earle was particularly influential, and he was especially gifted in writing story songs: “Number 29,” “Tom Ames’s Prayer,” “Billy and Bonnie,” “Johnny Come Lately,” “Billy Austin,” and so many more. But it was “Copperhead Road” that hit me hardest, because it came out as I was writing my first novel, also about a character in the marijuana trade:\n\nMy name’s John Lee Pettimore\n\nSame as my daddy and his daddy before\n\nYou hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here\n\nHe only came to town about twice a year\n\nHe’d buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line\n\nEverybody knew that he made moonshine\n\nNow the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad\n\nHe headed up the holler with everything he had\n\nIt’s before my time but I’ve been told\n\nHe never came back from Copperhead Road\n\nNow Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge\n\nBought it at an auction at the Mason’s Lodge\n\nJohnson County Sheriff painted on the side\n\nJust shot a coat of primer then he looked inside\n\nHim and my uncle tore that engine down\n\nI still remember that rumblin’ sound\n\nThe sheriff came around in the middle of the night\n\nHeard Mama cryin’, knew something wasn’t right\n\nHe was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load\n\nYou could smell the whiskey burnin’ down Copperhead Road\n\nI volunteered for the Army on my birthday\n\nThey draft the white trash first ’round here anyway\n\nI done two tours of duty in Vietnam\n\nAnd I came home with a brand new plan\n\nI take the seed from Colombia and Mexico\n\nI plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road\n\nWell the D.E.A.’s got a chopper in the air\n\nI wake up screaming like I’m back over there\n\nI learned a thing or two from Charlie don’t you know\n\nYou better stay away from Copperhead Road\n\nHere again, the devil is in the details: a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line … a big black Dodge bought at an auction at the Mason’s lodge, Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side … the rumbling sound of the engine … the smell of whiskey burning as revenue agents destroy the family still … drafting the white trash first. That and the escalating violence, its specific nature, build tension to the very end. (This escalation of tension is amplified by an uptempo switch before the final verse and chorus that kicks the song into overdrive–again, not technique easily accomplished in fiction, but shortening sentences and paragraphs, using harder, earthier words can get you some of the way.)\n\nThe Steely Dan Influence\n\nAs I mentioned at the outset, Steve Earle and Steely Dan were particularly strong influences. The Dan’s musicianship and their attitude had more of an effect than their lyrics, which for the most part lacked the beginning-middle-end structure of the standard story song.\n\nBut their word play was a definite influence, with its caustic irony, its ambiguity, its use of hip lingo, and its obscure musical references (“Even Cathy Berberian knows/There’s one roulade she can’t sing”) as well as its literary ones (the band’s name is a nod to William Burroughs, who used the term to describe a specific type of dildo).\n\nBut it’s one of their more story-like songs, “Sign in Stranger,” that influenced me to the point I used it in a mashup with “Godwhacker” as a jumping off point for a story that was included in an anthology titled Die Behind the Wheel, a kind of fiction tribute to the band’s music.\n\nThe song reveals Donald Fagen’s and Walter Becker’s fondness for science-fiction—and their own unique take on the genre:\n\nHave you heard about the boom on Mizar 5?\n\nPeople got to shout to stay alive\n\nThey don’t even have policeman one\n\nDoesn’t matter where you’ve been or what you’ve done\n\nDo you have a dark spot on your past?\n\nLeave it to my man he’ll fix it fast\n\nPepe has a scar from ear to ear\n\nHe will make your mug shots disappear\n\nYou zombie\n\nBe born again my friend\n\nWon’t you sign in stranger?\n\nDo you like to take a yo-yo for a ride?\n\nZombie, I can see you’re qualified\n\nWalk around collecting Turkish union dues\n\nThey will call you sir and shine your shoes\n\nOr maybe you would like to see the show?\n\nYou’ll enjoy the cafe D’Escargot\n\nFolks are in a line around the block\n\nJust to see her do the Can-Can-Jacques\n\nYou zombie\n\nBe born again my friend\n\nWon’t you sign in stranger?\n\nLove or leave her, yellow fever\n\nSure, it’s all in the game\n\nAnd who are you?\n\nJust another scurvy brother\n\nYou zombie\n\nBe born again my friend\n\nWon’t you sign in stranger?\n\nClearly, this is no straightforward story in any conventional sense, but that lack of linearity gives it an evocative power. And what are Turkish union dues, or the Can-Can-Jacques, why “zombie”—who knows? Who cares? There’s a mischievous freedom here that I’ve too often been reluctant or afraid to embrace, too intent on “doing it right” to let go and allow my imagination to grab the wheel.\n\nCoda\n\nLike a number of mathematicians I knew in college, a lot of writers are frustrated musicians. And there is much to be said for trying to duplicate in our writing the whole music-plus-lyric experience of a great song.\n\nAbsent the backing soundtrack, however, we’re left with only words to create the atmospherics and nuance that melody, harmony, rhyme and rhythm offer. It’s difficult but not impossible, as some of the songs I’ve mentioned above make clear. By sticking to character, story, and repeated imagery or motifs—and letting logic take an occasional back seat to an inventive turn of phrase—we can replicate if not exactly duplicate the effect of a musical composition. And never forget the rhythms in language itself—it can often prove just as effective in conjuring meaning as the mot juste."
