Nathaniel Macon, U.S. Senator from North Carolina, 13 December 1815 to 14 November 1828, during the Era of Good Feeling. Macon was the biggest city in the Georgia congressional district of Representative Carl Vinson, then chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee and supporter of rigid airship development.\n\nA Confederate sternwheel gunboat had previously borne the name.\n\n(Map courtesy of HamsterMap.com.)\n\n\"Photograph of the Rear Control Car of a Dirigible, ca. 1933.\" USS Macon (ZRS-5).\n\n\"Investigating Dirigible Disasters. The Joint Committee to Investigate Dirigible Disasters was created [by House Concurrent Resolution 15, 73rd Congress,] to investigate the cause of the USS Akron disaster and the wrecks of other Army and Navy dirigibles and to determine responsibility. [This is one of the photographs that] were submitted to the Joint Committee during its investigation.\"\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA), National Archives Identifier 6708577.\n\nNote: This photo is incorrectly identified as pertaining to Akron (ZRS-4).

Moffett, shown as she recently christened the Macon, sister ship of the lost Akron.\"\n\n\"Widow of Rear Admiral Who Died on Akron on Air Trip to West—By Times Special—CHICAGO, April 28.—Mrs. William A. Moffett, undeterred from flying by the death of her husband, Rear Admiral Moffett, in the Akron disaster, stopped here Thursday on an air trip from Washington to Los Angeles.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Moffett was amazed that she could be considered daring for continuing to fly.\"\n\n\"'We all fly,' she declared, 'My sons, William and Lieutenant George Moffett, are naval aviators. My daughter, Mrs. Janet Moffett Moore, is a pilot, married to the executive director of the air lines between Los Angeles and Catalina Island.'\"\n\n\"'My other two sons, Charles, 17, and Beverly, 14, flew from Washington to the Pacific coast Tuesday.

Macon, the latest and largest dirigible of the U.S. Navy. As she is brought into her berth at Lakehurst, N.J., June 24th, after flying from Akron, OH.

Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary conducted a sonar survey in 2005 followed by the first archaeological expedition in 2006 that documented the Macon's remains.\"\n\n\"Commemorating the 75th anniversary of the loss of the U.S. Navy airship USS Macon, NOAA today [11 February 2010] announced that the wreck site on the seafloor within Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.\"\n\n(More information available at the NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] website.)\n\n\"This souvenir post card of the rigid airship Macon comes to you from the annual exhibition of the RUBBER CITY STAMP CLUB, AKRON, OHIO.

Ultimately it was based at the U.S. Naval Air Station, Moffett Field, Calif. Returning from maneuvers with the U.S. Fleet, in the Pacific, on Feb. 12, 1935, Macon suffered damage, settled into the sea, off Point Sur, California and subsequently was destroyed. Of the 83 aboard, all were rescued but two.
