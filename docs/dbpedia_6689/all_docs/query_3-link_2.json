        "text": "United States Naval Academy fight song\n\nFor other uses, see Anchors Aweigh (disambiguation).\n\nAnchors Aweigh! Organizational anthem of the U.S. NavyLyricsJohn Hagan, 1997MusicCharles A. Zimmermann, 1906Adopted1907; 117 years ago ( )Audio sample\n\n1993 recording of \"Anchors Aweigh\" in Zimmermann's original 1906 arrangement, as performed by the United States Navy Band\n\n\"Anchors Aweigh\" is the fight song of the United States Naval Academy and unofficial march song of the United States Navy. It was composed in 1906 by Charles A. Zimmermann with lyrics by Alfred Hart Miles. When he composed \"Anchors Aweigh\", Zimmermann was a lieutenant and had been bandmaster of the United States Naval Academy Band since 1887. Miles was midshipman first class at the academy, in the class of 1907, and had asked Zimmermann to assist him in composing a song for that class, to be used as a football march. Another academy midshipman, Royal Lovell (class of 1926), later wrote what would be adopted into the song as its third verse. Another member of the Naval Academy Band, Willy Perlitz Jr., assisting in writing the music for the different instruments used in \"Anchors Aweigh\".\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Weigh anchor\" is an old English sailors' expression first referenced in literature in John Dryden's The Tempest, 1670. It is an order that a ship's anchors be raised, To \"weigh anchor\" is to bring all anchor(s) aboard the vessel in preparation for departure. In response to the order, the phrase \"anchors aweigh\" reports back that all anchors are clear of the sea bottom; therefore the ship is officially under way.\n\n\"Anchors aweigh\" is often misspelled as \"Anchor's away\", leading to confusing the terms, and sometimes misunderstanding the order as meaning \"to drop anchor\".[citation needed] Confusion may also occur over two correct spellings typically encountered: that is, \"anchor's\" with an apostrophe, and without (\"anchors\"). Here the phrase \"anchor's aweigh\", (denoting a single anchor plus the contraction of the verb \"is\") means: this anchor is raised. The single phrase must be distinguished from the plural \"anchors aweigh\", which reports that all anchors of the ship are raised.\n\nAlthough the original (now archaic) \"aweigh\" is verbal and transitive, the \"aweigh\" used now is adjectival/adverbial in nature and meaning.[1][2] \"Weigh\" as a verb means to \"bear\" or \"move\", thus giving it several shades of meaning and derivation, including \"weight\" or \"heaviness\".\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nMany arrangements of the song exist, but the original composition by Zimmermann from 1906, is labelled as a \"March and Two-Step\" and consists of a lengthy instrumental march introductory section, which then becomes a two-step with lyrical accompaniment approximately halfway into the piece.[3]\n\nMany arrangements of \"Anchors Aweigh\" exist today, one arrangement by Paul V. Yoder often sees use by military bands, such as those of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, the Bundeswehr, and other nations' militaries.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song was first played during the Army–Navy football game on December 1, 1906, at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Navy won the game 10–0 before a crowd in excess of 30,000, their first win in the matchup since 1900.[citation needed]\n\nThe song was gradually adopted as the song of the U.S. Navy; although there is a pending proposal to make it the official song, and to incorporate protocol into Navy regulations for its performance, its status remains unofficial.[timeframe?] Its lyrics were considered too specific to the Academy and not representative of the Navy at large, and so were rewritten by George D. Lottman (note the reference to \"farewell to college joys\"). Its melody was also slightly rewritten by Domenico Savino.[timeframe?]\n\nThe song has a joyful, brisk melody, and it has been adopted by several other navies around the world, such as the Finnish Navy. In addition to being bandmaster at the Naval Academy, Zimmerman was also the organist at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Annapolis, and the opening notes of the melody to \"Anchors Aweigh\" bear a marked similarity (although in a different tempo) to the opening of the ancient Marian hymn Salve Regina, with which Zimmerman would have been thoroughly familiar.\n\nDuring World War II, members of the Navy Women's Reserve, known more popularly as the WAVES, wrote \"WAVES of the Navy\" to harmonize with \"Anchors Aweigh\".[9]\n\nBing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961).\n\nLyrics\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Anchors Aweigh\" (1906 version), which is still used today at the Naval Academy.[1]\n\nStand Navy down the field, sails set to the sky;\n\nWe'll never change our course, So Army you steer shy-y-y-y.\n\nRoll up the score, Navy, anchors aweigh!\n\nSail Navy down the field and sink the Army, sink the Army grey!\n\nGet under way Navy, decks cleared for the fray;\n\nWe'll hoist true Navy Blue, So Army down your grey-y-y-y;\n\nFull speed ahead, Navy; Army heave to;\n\nFurl Black and Grey and Gold, and hoist the Navy, hoist the Navy Blue!\n\nBlue of the Seven Seas; Gold of God's Great Sun\n\nLet these our colors be till all of time be done, done, done,\n\nBy Severn's shore we learn Navy's stern call:\n\nFaith, Courage, Service true, with Honor, Over Honor, Over All.\n\nRevised Lyrics of 1926 by George D. Lottman:[1]\n\nStand, Navy, out to sea, Fight our battle cry;\n\nWe'll never change our course, So vicious foe steer shy-y-y-y.\n\nRoll out the TNT, Anchors Aweigh. Sail on to victory\n\nAnd sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!\n\nAnchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh.\n\nFarewell to college joys, we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay.\n\nThrough our last night on shore, drink to the foam,\n\nUntil we meet once more. Here's wishing you a happy voyage home.\n\nRevised Lyrics of 1997 by then-MCPON John Hagan which is used today by the Navy:[1]\n\nStand Navy out to sea, fight our battle cry!\n\nWe'll never change our course so vicious foes steer shy-y-y-y!\n\nRoll out the TNT, anchors aweigh!\n\nSail on to victory, and sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!\n\nAnchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh!\n\nFarewell to foreign Shores, we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay;\n\nThrough our last night ashore, drink to the foam,\n\nUntil we meet once more, here's wishing you a happy voyage home!\n\nBlue of the mighty deep, Gold of God's great sun;\n\nLet these our colors be, Till All of time be done, done, done, done;\n\nOn seven seas we learn, Navy's stern call:\n\nFaith, courage, service true, With honor over, honor over all.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMusic portal\n\nMarines' Hymn, the song of the United States Marine Corps (USMC)\n\nSemper Paratus (march), the song of the United States Coast Guard (USCG)\n\nThe Army Goes Rolling Along, the song of the United States Army (USA)\n\nThe U.S. Air Force (song), the song of the United States Air Force (USAF)\n\nSemper Supra (march), the song of the United States Space Force\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nCollins, Ace.
