At the world premiere in December, 2022, the Chorale is joined by the Global Academy of Phoenix Treble Choir.\n\nWhat struck me most about Winner’s words in “Whispering Hope” was his balance of imagery pertaining to darkness and light. This poem does not contain an onslaught of optimism, but a realistic perspective: as surely as darkness exists, hope endures. Hope is never the loudest, most obvious voice, but its resilience makes it all the more worth seeking.\n\nThe piece begins in the middle of a storm, which clears just enough to perceive a glimmer of hope on the horizon. The children’s choir performs the role of the eagerly-desired voice of Hope, whose message gradually bolsters the morale of the adult choir. The music ends with jubilant celebration and a sense of deeply-rooted peace.\n\nHebrews 6:19a (NIV) We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.\n\nView Event →\n\n*WORLD PREMIERE* of \"Whispering Hope\" with the Arizona Masterworks Chorale\n\nThe Arizona Masterworks Chorale presents \"Here We Come A-Caroling\", a fun-filled, family-friendly concert of traditional Christmas songs, a world premiere, the sounds of handbells, audience carol sing-along, and letters to Santa Claus.\n\nTickets may be purchased at the door, or here in advance. $15 General/$12 Students & Seniors\n\nClick here to learn more about the concert.\n\nAbout “Whispering Hope”\n\nThe Arizona Masterworks Chorale commissioned this work to celebrate the joyous return of singing together, and to renew their commitment to the cultural life of the city and state.
