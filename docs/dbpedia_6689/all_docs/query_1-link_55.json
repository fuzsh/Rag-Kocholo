        "text": "Wow, what an exciting morning! I have the privilege of being one of 24 finalists in the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Song Competition. There were 1,341 extremely talented entrants this year, a record number of folks who have the ability to make this world a better place, one song at a time: it is a blessing to share this lifetime with such beautiful creators.\n\nI am so thrilled to have the opportunity to widen my constellation of new friends at this Festival. What a lovely opportunity this is to fill the love battery with the company of such good hearts and minds and spirits.\n\nI was taking a look at all the incredible creatives who have played this festival in the past, and feel gratitude to be in such stellar star stuff company: Nanci Griffith, Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen… there are too many to name. Headlining performers have included Willie Nelson; Peter, Paul, and Mary; Lyle Lovett; Mary Chapin Carpenter.\n\nI sent in six songs this year, and the two that were selected are called “Infinite Jest” and “Want”.\n\nInfinite Jest\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Rm0y-DDh7NY?si=WSaaLUosdx12ucCF\n\nWant\n\nhttps://youtu.be/071Ik0FA0fo?si=RwQZ3CFno_fno8dm\n\nThanks again to Kerrville Folk Festival for what they do, and for listening to all of us share our hearts, minds, and souls.\n\n“Life is a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.” - Bill Hicks\n\nWHO IS MIKE VITALE?\n\nI am a storyteller, singer, songwriter, music producer, traveling musician, Jungian dream analyst, all-around curious fellow (Spiritual, Mathematical Historical, Scientific), Taoist, and much much more, based out of Los Angeles, California. I’m constantly releasing new music, in all sorts of different genres. You can listen to me below, on Spotify:"
