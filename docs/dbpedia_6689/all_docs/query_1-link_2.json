He was born on May 15, 1954 in Salt Lake City, UT to Floyd Earl and May Belle Rosanna Baldwin.\n\nGarry graduated from Bonneville High School in Idaho Falls, ID and then moved to Salt Lake City where he met his \"Sassy Sweet\"-heart. He married the love of his life, Sharon Marie Peterson, on June 17, 1977.\n\nThroughout his life, Garry had an inherent passion for music.

Over his lifetime, he taught himself to play a wide variety of instruments including bass, piano, keyboard, drums, banjo, mandolin, and a variety of percussion instruments. He had a diverse style of music and when asked he would say that he played \"pop rock, jazz rock, blues rock, progressive rock, country rock, ballad rock, new age, techno, and movie type music.\"\n\nHe loved the mountains and being outdoors where he could often be found hiking, biking, and especially walking with his faithful friend Lizzy Lu.
