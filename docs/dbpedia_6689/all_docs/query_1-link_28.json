        "text": "Wow, what an exciting morning! I have the privilege of being one of 24 finalists in the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Song Competition. There were 1,341 extremely talented entrants this year, a record number of folks who have the ability to make this world a better place, one song at a time: it is a blessing to share this lifetime with such beautiful creators.\n\nI am so thrilled to have the opportunity to widen my constellation of new friends at this Festival. What a lovely opportunity this is to fill the love battery with the company of such good hearts and minds and spirits.\n\nI was taking a look at all the incredible creatives who have played this festival in the past, and feel gratitude to be in such stellar star stuff company: Nanci Griffith, Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen… there are too many to name. Headlining performers have included Willie Nelson; Peter, Paul, and Mary; Lyle Lovett; Mary Chapin Carpenter.\n\nI sent in six songs this year, and the two that were selected are called “Infinite Jest” and “Want”.\n\nInfinite Jest\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Rm0y-DDh7NY?si=WSaaLUosdx12ucCF\n\nWant\n\nhttps://youtu.be/071Ik0FA0fo?si=RwQZ3CFno_fno8dm\n\nThanks again to Kerrville Folk Festival for what they do, and for listening to all of us share our hearts, minds, and souls.\n\n“Life is a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.” - Bill Hicks\n\nWHO IS MIKE VITALE?\n\nI am a storyteller, singer, songwriter, music producer, traveling musician, Jungian dream analyst, all-around curious fellow (Spiritual, Mathematical Historical, Scientific), Taoist, and much much more, based out of Los Angeles, California. I’m constantly releasing new music, in all sorts of different genres. You can listen to me below, on Spotify:\n\nThis is a song I wrote when I was living in Long Beach, CA several years ago—what feels like a lifetime away from me, now. It was another life.\n\nI was exercising the deep hurt that I felt after the end of a relationship—transitory. A Dixie cup? It's not my place to say. Feelings. Truth. Facts. Gossip. What do any of those things really mean, when you are hurting. I think you just want the pain to stop—and it always does eventually.\n\nWhat I do know, is that I sobbed as I wrote these words, and that they were cathartic. Hopefully, they will be to someone else, now.\n\nNo Vacancy\n\nwords and music by Michael Patrick Vitale\n\nDancing with a lover on a dead-end street\n\nStepping on toes with my two left feet\n\nI fell asleep under a vacancy sign\n\nThe NO was burned out, but then she changed the lights\n\nA foggy walk alone on a new moon night\n\nShe disappeared all together when I closed my eyes\n\nThe street lights flicker on and off, on and off, on and off, like her emotion\n\nUntil I find I'm off the deep end of an abstract notion\n\nI forgot the melody a caged bird sings\n\nThe door's wide open but I've got clipped wings\n\nThe seed went sour in the dying light\n\nSo I'll sing for my supper 'til the water runs dry\n\nThe quick hide hid under a broken nail\n\nThe Essex split in two over an angry whale\n\nThere were rumors of cannibals living on the island nearby\n\nSo the survivors took the opposite course and ate each other when the truth was in short supply\n\nI forgot the melody a caged bird sings\n\nThe door's wide open but I've got clipped wings\n\nThe seed went sour in the dying light\n\nSo I'll sing for my supper 'til the water runs dry\n\nParallel lines in the wilderness\n\nTrain tracks broken by a small recess\n\nAs the casualties are listed by a talking head\n\nShe limits her emotion behind words she read\n\nI forgot the melody a caged bird sings\n\nThe door's wide open but I've got clipped wings\n\nThe seed went sour in the dying light\n\nSo I'll sing for my supper 'til the water runs dry\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nThe world is odd, and isn’t obliged to make any sense. Mathematics and science, the religious and pious, eternal discoveries or human invention?\n\nThese are the lyrics that occur later in this song. It’s called The Puzzle, and that’s how I see life.\n\nToday, as I was walking to Target to get a 9V battery for my acoustic guitar pickup, I was listening to an audio book discussing time on the quantum level, within the realm of Quantum Mechanics.\n\nWhat is time, really?\n\nAccording to John Archibald Wheeler, a theoretical physicist, “Time is what prevents everything from happening at once.”\n\nThe reason he said this is because the past and the present don’t exist as separate entities in the micro; the fabric of our reality. “There is no such thing as spacetime in the realm of quantum physics.” There is no linear time in the original quantum formalism. There is no explanation as to how one moment becomes the next, because in Quantum Physics, there is only one moment: the moment of observation, or what we as human beings call, The Present.\n\nAs Einstein put it: “People like us who believe in Physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future, is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”\n\nWe are always at the moment of observation. That is what the present is, and that is a gift. It is the moment of creation, for each and every one of us.\n\nThis is the first 45 seconds of the song. It is available to stream and purchase on my Patreon page, under the SHOP tab, through the Patreon App, which apparently, has always been there, even though I just created it.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mikevitalemusic/shop\n\nPatreon is a way to directly support creators and observers, such as myself. I like making things, and it is lovely to make a living and pay my car payment and my rent, doing what I love. Patreon is a way to help make that happen. If you are a $5 backer or higher, you get the song included for free for being a monthly subscriber.\n\nI like being a creator, now, in the present. I also like being the reason to shake some ass.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nI wrote this song shortly after moving to Los Angeles. I was astounded by the tremendous amount of homelessness in my neighborhood, and in Southern California in general. And if those numbers weren’t astonishing, the pandemic exponentially increased the homeless population to a scale I could never possibly imagine.\n\nI don’t have an answer to fix it. I really wish I did. I am an empathetic person, and there are millions of reasons why an individual ends up on the streets—and while I do not have a solution, I can say that I see possibility. I see value. I see the potential of a person. I see the sense of community amongst the ranks of people I know on a first name basis in my neighborhood. I see the folks who are suffering from Schizophrenia, and Tourette’s, and Manic Depression. I see self-medication. I see people. I see you. I see me.\n\nWant\n\nwords and music by Michael Patrick Vitale\n\nA tall glass of water\n\nA safe bed to sleep\n\nA roof overhead\n\nWarm food to eat\n\nA world full of want\n\nDesires and dues\n\nEveryone needs something\n\nWithout exception too\n\nSomeone to hug us\n\nWhen we’re feeling blue\n\nSomeone to love us\n\nThrough and through\n\nEveryone wants\n\nWe’re all living proof\n\nEveryone needs something\n\nAnd I’m no exception too\n\nMaybe under an overpass and over this life\n\nFeeling all alone and cold and scared and hungry at night\n\nEmpty as a Dixie cup, discarded just the same\n\nCrumpled up and wasted under pliable walls, blankets, and rain\n\nWho here marks value on things you can count\n\nPlease add up all the tents and tarps standing about\n\nEveryone here needs a home and no one ever wants to feel alone\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\n“Dandelion Seeds”\n\nwords and music by Michael Patrick Vitale\n\nWe’re dandelion seeds in the wind\n\nA couple kids playing pretend\n\nMaking wishes in the weeds\n\nReading our futures off of tarot cards and tea leaves\n\nWandering around the bend\n\nWith one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the bitter end\n\nReaching out towards the stars\n\nAbove a Hollywood sign and an ocean of cars\n\nI have my opinion, but you’re full of your own\n\nAnd there’s plenty of windshield time with our thoughts alone\n\nAnd some could wage argue that truth is both moot and plural\n\nYet I’m still in love with the girl\n\nStill in love with the girl\n\nWe’re dandelion seeds in the wind\n\nA couple kids playing pretend\n\nMaking wishes in the weeds\n\nReading our futures off of tarot cards and tea leaves\n\nWandering around the bend\n\nWith one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the bitter end\n\nReaching out towards the stars\n\nAbove a Hollywood sign and an ocean of cars\n\nI have my opinion, but you’re full of your own\n\nAnd there’s plenty of windshield time with our thoughts alone\n\nAnd some could wage argue that truth is both moot and plural\n\nYet I’m still in love with the girl\n\nStill in love with the girl\n\nI’m still in love with the girl\n\nI’m still in love with the girl\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about me and my songwriting, engineering, production, and album making process—or would just like to be a part of my creative endeavors, check me out at http://www.patreon.com/mikevitalemusic\n\nI have two albums that I’ve been working on to release this year.
