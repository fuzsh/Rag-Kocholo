Raised in El Paso, his sound is rooted in the Texas troubadour tradition. His songs reflect the familiar spirit of country music as it blends with the sounds he grew up on – classic country, rock, border Norteña, and the spontaneous freestyle of the mariachi street musicians of Juarez. An Americana Music top-40 artist and three time, first-round Grammy nominee. His guitar is the needle that weaves the yarn through the fabric of lost memories and forgotten dreams.\n\nEven if you are not familiar with Jimmy Baldwin's music, you have most likely seen his creative work. His Motel 6 commercials with Tom Bodett received numerous awards. As did his sun-baked beach spots for Corona beer. Jimmy Fallon even parodied his Corona \"Beeper\" spot on Saturday Night Live. Jimmy Baldwin also won an international directorial award from Wim Wenders and Dennis Hopper for his directorial debut."
