In the therapy demonstration, Dr. Curry applies his approach to behavioral activation and works with an adolescent teen who is suffering from depression.\n\nDVD Link: http://www.apa.org/pubs/videos/4310991.aspx\n\nFor more information about Dr. Curry and his work, refer to his publications below:\n\nPublications\n\nMeyer, AE, and Curry, JF. \"Pathways from anxiety to stressful events: An expansion of the stress generation hypothesis.\" Clinical psychology review 57 (November 2017): 93-116.
