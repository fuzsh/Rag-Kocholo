        "text": "The word ‘Religion’ as a concept in itself holds a great significance. It is very astonishing how it binds people in a very unique way like its origin Latin word “Religare” which means the same. Its presence is undeniable in any society which may not be discrete but it is there. The world is filled with uncertainty and horrors and people wanted to have faith in someone or something which gives them HOPE. This leads to the emergence of religion, which aims to fulfill emotional, social and psychological needs of the people. We often use the term belief knowingly or unknowingly to start our conversation related to Religion.\n\nMelford Spiro, in his study of Burmese religion, talked about Belief in this way:\n\nAny cognition concerning human beings, society, or the world that is held to be true. By “religious belief” I mean any belief that directly or indirectly relates to beings who are held to possess greater power than humans and animals, with whom human beings sustain relationship (interactions and transactions), and who can affect human lives for good or for evil. In short, “religious” beliefs are beliefs related to supernatural beings. (Spiro 1978: xii)\n\nAlthough the concept of ‘belief’ is very complex to comprehend even if we ask “In which god do you believe in?” it does not answer all of our doubts. We need to dig deeper on many levels to understand the large canvas that Religion makes and how people give different colour to it.\n\nIn an attempt to understand this concept, I chose this specific topic Religion while doing our Anthropological fieldwork in Dhinkli village. It is situated in Udaipur, Rajasthan and shares its vast boundary with Aravali mountains. My particular focus was on Bhil tribe living there and an attempt to understand who do they worship and their legends.\n\nPhoto 1: A man worshipping in Dhinkli’s temple.\n\nEach tribe has their own unique cultural and religious practices but as the boundary between them and other communities started disappearing the tribes acculturated many practices. It is evident even in Bhils of Udaipur, they follow Hinduism but it is not entirely same with mainstream religion. They have their own gods who either have independent existence or reincarnations of Hindu gods. There are 5 main religious scriptures in Hinduism that are: Vedas, Upanishades, Puranas, Ramayana and Mahabharta. Gods who have reincarnations written in these texts are main gods in this religion and those gods who are not mentioned in here are localized reincarnations and are known as legends. Among Bhils they have two higher gods Dharam Raj and Bhairav or Beruji. Both of them are mentioned in religious texts and varies from one region to other. People in Dhinkli told me that Beruji is the son of ‘Kalka Mata’ who is the goddess of anger and war. Also, Beruji is the reincarnation of lord Shiva in Hindu mythology.\n\nDharam Raj ji is similar to the god of righteousness of mainstream Hindu religion.\n\nThis shows how in order to assimilate; tribal groups often link their own religion with mainstream religions to be accepted in the society. Even though the role of the God varies among different cultures due to change of meanings, the broad essence remains the same.\n\nI observed three forms of Beruji were present in the temple of Bora Mangra. In one idol ‘Gora’ and ‘Kala’ beruji were present. According to Bhopaji (spiritual and medicinal man), ‘Gora bheruji’ has a calm personality whereas ‘Kala beruji’ is aggressive in nature. His personality varies based on different situations. ‘Angadh bhairav ji’ is another form coated with colourful aluminum foil papers. People who have vision problems, pray to him for healing or recovery.\n\nBhil tribe allows space for localized Gods to be assimilated in their culture. It gives distinct identity on the basis of ‘gotras’, as each ‘gotra’ has a distinct god which may or may not be associated with the mainstream god. Due to the practical limitations, it was difficult to gather such data in such a short span of time for me. Although, it came to my knowledge that certain ‘gotras’ such as ‘Chauhan’, ‘Hul’ and ‘Solanki’ have ‘Ashapuri’, ‘Baann Mata’ and ‘Kheenwaj Mata’ as their ‘kuldevis’ respectively.\n\nPicture 2 and 3: Idols of different goddesses among Bhil tribe.\n\nThere are localized gods and goddesses attributed with different powers, such as:\n\nBariya Mata– She is worshipped for good and timely rain for good harvest.\n\nDasha Mata- She is worshipped by married women for their good and fateful married life, as well as for the good health of their husbands and their children.\n\nSheetla Mata– She is worshipped to save the devotees from the suffering of the small pox.\n\nAshapuri Mata– As the name indicates she is the goddess who fulfills the wishes and desires of all those who trust and believe her. The unique thing about the idol of this goddess is that it has seven pairs of eyes. She is also the ‘kuldevi of Chauhans’.\n\nAvari Mata– She is worshipped as a symbol of creation it its feminine form. She is also considered as a form of goddess Parvati.\n\nKalka Mata– She is considered a fierce and angry form of eternal goddess. She is also worshipped by her devotees to be spared from the sufferings of chicken pox.\n\nGorja/ Gori Mata– She is called upon by Bhopaji during the ‘festival of Gauvri’, which is celebrated for bringing the prosperity, good crop and happiness of the community.\n\nPicture 4: Idol of Gorja Mata.\n\n7. Dharam Raj ji– He is the principle deity of the Bhil community and he is considered as the god of truth and righteousness.\n\n8. Bhairav/ Beruji– He is considered as a protector god and also the principle deity in witchcraft and mystical practices.\n\nPicture 5 (From L to R): Dharam Raj, ‘Gora’ and ‘Kala’ Bhairav and ‘Angadh bhairav ji’.\n\n9. Taka ji– He is a snake god who protects his believers against the snake bites. Some believe that he is a form of Dharam Raj ji.\n\nPicture 6: Idol of Taka ji.\n\nReligion is a binding force in the Bhil community, it is deeply rooted not only in their culture but also in their day to day activities. It is the pivotal aspect of their livelihoods and entwined in their every belief. The grip of religious faith is so overpowering that the community takes its last hope to their gods, for example, when someone is physically ill and the doctors are unable to treat the disease then the Bhils take refuge into their gods for the well being of the ill. Bhopaji acts as a vessel of the gods, whichever is needed.\n\nVideo showing Bhopa ji acting as a vessel of Beru ji and solving people’s problems:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LiWaMdh9UdSq9QIgfULrkxRdZXpXFeKL/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nThe status of women is highly inferior to men and patriarchy is very strong. Women are not allowed to visit the god’s idol without a veil. They are considered impure, submissive and weak in character, so they are deprived of equal rights in religious matters; as Bhopaji can only be a male.\n\nWomen are taught to be submissive and they are conditioned to accept themselves as inferior beings; as they believe that if they directly see the god’s idol then they will become the vessel of the god which would be highly inappropriate because they are married and they belong to some other man.\n\nI observed that the oral tradition of legends is being forgotten gradually as the young generation is unaware of the stories and essence of their own belief system. The aged people were best source for me to narrate the stories and significance of particular gods and goddesses. But I must admit that I faced difficulty in extracting the information because people claimed they did not remember the legends correctly and some also said they could not express the story in such a short span of time.\n\nReligion is deeply rooted in their day to day lives and as I attempted to study their belief system, it was practically very hard, challenging and tiresome at the same time to comprehend and understand it in its entirety.\n\nThe practical limitations were many but the foremost was the limitation of time. To study such a complex structure, it requires trust building, basic knowledge of the culture from the native’s perspectives and all of these require elaborated time period.\n\nVideo and Picture Credits: Smriti Dutta\n\nReferences:\n\nEller, Jack David “Introducing Anthropology of Religion”, Routledge,2007.\n\nBhuriya, Mahipal, “Tribal Religion in India: A Case Study of the Bhils.” Journal of Social compass, XXXIII/2-3, 1986, 275-283.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nI am truly thankful to my field supervisor Dr. Chakraverti Mahajan for guiding us throughout the fieldwork. I also want to express my gratitude towards my subjects who took out of their precious time to give me information unhesitatingly and all my classmates especially Tsering Chosen for their support and hard work."
