        "text": "One of the two British tourists killed after a train derailed in northern India has been named as Joan Nichols.\n\nA family member told the BBC the 71-year-old from South Shields was on a \"once in a life time holiday\".\n\nHer husband John, 72, has been released from hospital. Their two daughters and son are now travelling to India.\n\nInvestigations are under way to discover what caused the train, which was carrying 37 Britons on the Kalka to Shimla mountain line, to derail.\n\nSome reports suggest the specially-chartered train was going too fast.\n\nGreat Rail Journeys, the York-based tour company which organised the trip, earlier said the families of those killed had been informed.\n\nRepresentatives from the company are due to meet survivors.\n\nMrs Nichols's niece Andrea Davison told the BBC she was grandmother to five children and great-grandmother to two children. She was also volunteer for the Samaritans.\n\nThree carriages of the four-carriage train came off the rails shortly after leaving Kalka railway station at 13:20 local time, a rail official told the BBC.\n\nOnboard were 36 passengers and a tour manager on day three of a 13-day trip.\n\nConfirming the deaths of two British nationals on Saturday, Foreign Office minister for Asia Hugo Swire said he was \"deeply saddened\".\n\nLocal police said nine people were injured, including six Britons.\n\nThree people - two passengers and the tour guide - are still in hospital with what are believed to be non-life threatening injuries, Great Rail Journeys said.\n\nChief executive Peter Liney thanked the Foreign Office for its assistance, and said a group of passengers were now in a hotel in the nearby city of Chandigarh.\n\nAn emergency response team from the company, including a counsellor, had landed in Delhi and was on its way to Chandigarh, expected to arrive about 17:30 local time, he said.\n\n\"A number of the passengers have chosen to move on from the hotel in Chandigarh and have gone to Shimla, where Great Rail Journeys will ensure that an experienced tour manager is made available,\" he added.\n\nThe picturesque Kalka-Shimla mountain railway is a Unesco world heritage site and tourist attraction, often called the toy train line.\n\nIt was opened in 1903 to connect Shimla, the summer capital of British India, with the northern plains.\n\nThe railway climbs more than 4,000ft (1,200m) through the Himalayan foothills, and is famous for its many bridges, tunnels and panoramic views."
