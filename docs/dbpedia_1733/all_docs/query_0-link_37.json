        "text": "Introduction\n\nOne of the most well-known traditional medicinal practices from antiquity that has survived and developed over time is ayurveda. This system will endure for many more millennia because of the extensive knowledge of natural remedies, the linkages between environmental factors and human body composition and performance, and the cosmos's interconnected elements that have an impact on living things.1\n\nPanchkarma (detoxification therapy) is an Ayurvedic detoxifying retreat technique. Panchkarma is a detoxification and relaxing approach that has been used for centuries to help people cope with seasonal and societal changes. Benefits of this therapy include improvements in one's perception of social support, quality of life, and healthy behavior.2\n\nFor daily activities, focus, alertness, mental and physical performance, etc., sleep is crucial. Sleep disruptions can lead to serious health issues and other difficulties.\n\nAn individual who struggles to fall or stay asleep is said to have insomnia. Short-term and longer insomnia are both possible; short-term insomnia can last anywhere from one night to a few weeks, while long-term insomnia develops when sleep problems endure for longer than three months. Primary and secondary insomnia are the two categories of the condition. In contrast to secondary insomnia, which occurs when a patient's sleep problems are brought on by an underlying health problem such as asthma, cancer, heartburn, pain, medications, or other substances such as alcohol whereas primary insomnia is characterized by the absence of any other health concerns in the patient.3\n\nThe three pillars of life in Ayurveda are food (Ahara), sleep (Nindra), celibacy (Bramhacharya), according to a Hindu religious teacher, insomnia is mentioned in the Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, and Astang Hridaya, among other ayurvedic classic texts.4 Insomnia is defined in eight undesirable conditions (Asthonindtiya Adhyaah) by spiritual guide Charak, and insomnia is mentioned in Maharoga Adhyaya as one of the 80 types of Vata disease.5 It is described in the Susruta Samhita in the Sharir Sthana under Garbhavyakaran Sharir.\n\nThe causes of insomnia, according to Acharya Sushruta, are Santapa of vaata, pitta, and mana, as well as physical harm. Insomnia is caused by a variety of factors, the most prevalent of which are listed above.6 In Astang Hridiya spritual guide Vaghbhat has quoted the symptoms of insomnia as following throbbing pain, heaviness in head, yawning, stiffness all over body, exhaustion, giddiness, indigestion, drowsiness it may further causes Vata disease.7 It is said that a vitiated Vata Dosha sets off the effects of insomnia, hence balancing Vata Dosha can provide relief in the event of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia is said to affect 9% of the general population, with 30% of people experiencing it occasionally. 18.6% of the cohort research participants said they had sleeplessness. A north Indian urban population was found to have a greater prevalence of sleep disorders (28%) that affect the onset and maintenance of sleep.8\n\nConvolvulus pluricaulis herb is a memory enhancer that can also be used as a brain tonic to stimulate brain and brain function. It improves focus and learning capacities while also assisting in the treatment of insomnia, stress, depression, and mental stress.\n\nConvolvulus pluricaulis characterizes bitter taste. It shows oily, sticky, and slimy property, cold potency, and sweet metabolic property help in preventing a variety of health problem that disrupt sleep.\n\nThe intellectual effect boosts mental power and hence resists depression and anxiety etiology, resulting in restful sleep. Shankhpushpi is known to lower cortisol (the stress hormone), reducing stress and improving the quality and quality of natural sleep. Gastric problems can disrupt sleep, but this magical herbal remedy aids digestion and prevents reflux and gas accumulation, allowing you to sleep better. Chemical components found in Shankhpushpi, such as Shankhapushpine, convoline, convolidine, confoline, myristic acids, scopoletin, -sitosterol, tetratriacontane acids, flavonoid-kaempferol, and phytosterols, help to boost general health and ward off sickness- resulting in insomnia.9\n\nAccording to Ayurveda, the entrance to the brain is through the nose. Nasal administration refers to the practice of administering medication nasally. It is the most important therapy as it is used for the treatment of upper clavicular disease so in some places it has been given first place in the sequence of detoxification for e.g., in the chapter of Apamarga Tanduliyam of Charaka Samhita Sutrasthana.\n\nThe medication used in nasal administration enters the brain via a pathway known as the Vital point (Shringataka Marma), where it destroys the connection between toxins and brain tissues before transporting those molecules to the nose, where secretions force them out. People with brain illnesses are frequently given large amounts of unwanted medications by mouth. This may become troublesome for a patient's health if they live a long time or if they have a chronic ailment. Because of the brain's blood barrier restriction to oral use, tablets delivered orally are an incredibly poor approach to deliver medications to the brain when it comes to brain illnesses. Sneha can cross the blood-brain barrier because to its lipophilic activity, which releases the active principles of the constituents where they are needed. The likelihood that a medicine will cross the blood-brain barrier increases with its lipophilicity.10\n\nProtocol\n\nStudy setting\n\nThe patient of Insomnia will be recruited from the panchakarma OPD and IPD of Mahatma Gandhi Ayurved College, Hospital & Research Centre, Salod(H), and from peripheral camps.\n\nA total of 60 patients will be recruited for the study. They will be randomly divided into two groups. Group A will be given nasal administration with Ksheerbala oil, Group B will be given nasal administration with Shankhapushpi. All the baseline parameters will be recorded at the start of the study. The patients will undergo treatment for 15 days for both groups. After treatment, all the parameters will be recorded at the 16th and 30th day.\n\nGuideline: Used the SPIRIT guideline for the study.\n\nCase definition: Patient of insomnia (having age group between 20-60 year of irrespective gender) diagnosed based on Insomnia Severity Index.\n\nSampling procedure: Randomization computer generated table.\n\nType of Study: Interventional Study\n\nStudy design: Refer to Figure 1.\n\nStudy design: Randomization standard control double blind superiority clinical trial.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of committees: The study will start after clearance from IEC of Mahatma Gandhi Ayurved College Hospital and Research Centre, Salod(H), Wardha. And after CTRI registration Ref.No. MGACHRC/IEC/June-2023/707\n\nThe committee will decide on the endpoint and oversee the trial as it progresses.\n\nThe researcher will assess any adverse events and will report to the ethics committee.\n\nInclusion criteria\n\n1. Patients who are willing to give written inform consent.\n\n2. Patients’ gender age is between 20-60 years.\n\n3. Patients who are fit for Nasal administration procedure.\n\n4. Patient with controlled hypertension\n\n• (Systolic not more than 140 mmHg and diastolic not more than 90 mmHg).\n\n5. ICD10 criteria for primary insomnia – F51.01\n\n• Problems falling asleep or staying awake.\n\n• Sleep varies, i.e., one night of good sleep comes after several nights.\n\n• Daytime sleepiness.\n\n• Problems in performing daily activities.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n1. Patients < 20 years and > 60 years.\n\n2. Pregnant women and lactating mothers.\n\n3. Patient with co-morbidities Ex. uncontrolled Hypertension, DM-2, Thyroids, Cardiac disorders.\n\n4. Patient not fit for nasal administrating procedure, Rhinitis, Thirst, Indigestion, Menstruation etc.\n\n5. Patients with drug dependency like Antihistamines, Narcotics.\n\nOccupational disease.\n\nDetail of drug preparation\n\nDetail of drug preparation13\n\nThe coarse powder of the kalka Dravya will be taken in khalva yantra and triturated with little quantity of water till we obtain kalka (Paste).\n\nNow, tila taila will be consumed in a clean stainless-steel vessel with wide opening that is set over low flame.\n\nThen, shankhapushpi kwatha (decoction) and water followed by kalka will be added and processed with frequent stirring.\n\nThen as soon as all the Sneha siddhi lakshanas will be attained, the hot taila will be filtered into a clean stainless-steel vessel.\n\nThen, after the tail cool down by its own, it is packed and preserved in appropriate airtight containers for further therapeutic use.\n\nProcedure of nasal administration14\n\n1. Pre-procedure\n\n2. Procedure\n\n3. Post-procedure\n\nPre-procedure\n\nAll of the necessary tools and supplies should be acquired and organized prior to the procedure. The drugs required for Procedure i.e., Paste, Powder, Milk, Decoction should be available in a separate room free of dust, with direct air flow, sufficient lighting, Nasal administration table, and material required (the drugs required for procedure i.e., Paste, Powder, Milk, Decoction, nasal dropper, cotton swab, oil, medicinal smoke machine. A special smoke machine is required for Pradhamana Nasya. An attendant, as well as dressing tools, a spittoon, napkins, bowls, and towels, should be available.\n\nThe patient should be appropriately prepared by ensuring that they thoroughly comprehend the procedure and that they are willing (permission) to carry it out. Before lying down on the nasal administration table, the patient is recommended to pass his or her natural cravings. Soft and gentle massage should be done on scalp, forehead, face, neck for approximately 10-15 minutes using medicated oil. For the liquefaction of the Dosha, mild sudation (mridu swedan) should be performed, Mild sudation must be administered with caution, as sudation should not be performed on the head region, according to Ayurveda's classical text.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe patient should be advised to lie down on the nasal administration table in a supine posture with his or her head hanging downward and not overly stretched or flexed. The reason behind this is because if the head is not appropriately lowered, the injected medicine may miss its target, and if it is lowered too much, the drugs may reach the brain and become lodged there. Cotton or cloth should be used to cover the patient's eyes. The physician should next use the left thumb to lift the tip of the nose, and the right hand to pour the medicine into the nostrils. The drug should be taken in the correct amount, neither too much or too little. Depending on the patient's tolerance, it should be lukewarm. The patient should be encouraged to remain cool and composed throughout the process, and to refrain from speaking, laughing, sneezing, or shaking his head. Then keep the patient lying down and observe the symptoms arising in him.\n\nObservation\n\nProper Sudation (Samyak Yoga) Improper sudation (Asveda Lakshana) Excessive Sudation (Atisvedana Lakshana) Lightness in head region (Shiro laghav) No relief of coldness (Sita Aprasama) Fainting (Murccha) Good Sleep (Sukhaswapana) No sweating (Sveda Aapravrutti) Burning sensation (Daha) Remission of disease (vyadhihani) No relief of pain (Sula Aprasama) Weakness (Daurbalya) Improve sense organ (Indriyashuddhi) Itching (Kandu) Appearance of blister (Sphotha Utpati) Cleans the channels (Shrotoshuddhi) Heaviness (Gourava) Exhaustion (Klama) Relief stiffness (Stambha Nigraha) ----------- Pain in joints (Sandhipida)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe three Ayurvedic sthambhas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha—oversee all the body's essential processes. When the three Sthambhas are in an equilibrium state, a person is said to be healthy. There are three Pillars (Upsthambha) to support these Sthambha.\n\nFood (Ahara), Sleep (Nindra) and Celibacy (Brahmacharya) are the three. Upsthambha is one of the main forces that contribute to and support life. Such Pillars (Upsthambha) increase the strength of an individual. Sleep (Nindra) has an impact on both mental and physical elements. Nidra is therefore crucial for both physical and emotional wellness.\n\nWork, ageing, illnesses, constitution, and some Doshas like Vata and Pitta were only a few of the many causes of sleep deprivation that were explained by Ayurveda. These elements have a direct impact on sleep and result in sleep loss. Loss of sleep can occur for a variety of causes, including disease, stress, ageing, pain, mental illness, and others, according to modern scientific theory. Insomnia was included in the 80 Vataja disease by Charaka and Kashyapa.\n\nThe herb Convolvulus Pluricaulis (Shankhpushpi), a memory enhancer utilized as a brain tonic to stimulate cognition and brain function. It improves focus and learning skills and aids in the treatment of conditions such as depression, stress, and mental tiredness.\n\nThe Medhya effect increases strength of mind, which helps one resist the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety and promotes restful sleep. Convolvulus Pluricaulis (Shankhpushpi) is said to improve the quality and length of natural sleep by lowering cortisol (the stress hormone) levels, which in turn reduces stress.\n\nThe chemical components of Shankhpushpi, including flavonoids kaempferol and phytosterols, myristic acids, scopoletin, -sitosterol, tetratriacontane acids, and convoline, aid to promote general health and prevent disease-related sleeplessness.\n\nSince the nose serves as the brain's entrance, this procedure allows for the administration of medications in accordance with the severity of the patient's illness. It is a very effective therapy modality that is included in the arsenal of purification therapies due to the numerous classifications and varieties of nasal procedure that have been stated, as well as the various methods of medication delivery. Following a thorough examination of the patient and the selection of a particular nasal procedure, pre-procedure, procedure, and post procedure can be readily carried out systematically. The method's likely mode of action indicates that it is successful in producing the desired effects in the treatment of insomnia."
