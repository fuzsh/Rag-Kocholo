        "text": "UNESCO team starts inspection visit.\n\nSOLAN: The two men team of UNESCO started its six days inspection visit on Kalka-Shimla narrow gauge rail track to consider it for world heritage status today. Dr. Robert Lee and Mr. E.V. Walker embarked at Kalka railway station in morning. Accompanied by Mr. H.K. Jaggi, DRM, Ambala the team spent around two and half hour at Kalka station. Before to proceed further the team inspected the station, workshop and diesel shed thoroughly.\n\nOn entering the state the team got traditional rousing welcome at Taksaal railway station near Parwanoo. The people gathered in good number to welcome the team. The school children of Anand Primary School enthralled the team with the chanting of self written poem on rail.\n\nLater the team made a halt at Dharampur railway station where railway and district administration organized a small culture program for team. Talking to media the team praised the track. The team was quite impressed with the tunnels, bridges and pristine beauty of railway buildings en- route to Dharampur.\n\nThe team inquired some facts about track from Dharampur station staff besides taking photographs of a vintage wall clock at station. The clock made in 1903 was lying neglected after it stopped working long time back. Interestingly the clock got attention of station staff after media made query about it.\n\nWhile refusing to divulge more details the team members said that at this time they could not disclose more inputs. Mr. H.K. Jaggi said that to counter the often breakdown in engines deployed on this track the five new engines would be put into service by this year end.\n\nLater the team reached at Timber Trail Resort, Parwanoo by road for night stay . Tomorrow morning the team would restart its journey from Dharampur to Kandhaghat. During visit, the team would inspect whole track till Shimla. After visit it would meet central ministry before to prepare a report on visit. The outcome of report will be known after a year."
