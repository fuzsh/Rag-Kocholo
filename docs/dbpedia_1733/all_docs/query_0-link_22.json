Esti- mate of Akbar in the light of the Din-i-Ilahi, Pp. 290-309 FOREWORD 1 have great pleasure in commending to students of the Mughal period of the Indian History, Prof. Makhanlal Roy Choudhury's book on the Din-i-Ilahi or the religion of Akbar. While all the biographies of Akbar contain some reference to the subject dealt with in this book, yet there is no work which deals elaborately and specifically with this important theme. Prof. Roy Choudhury has brought to the discussion of Akbar 's religion a profound study of the original sources, and has also carried on research on his own account, with the result that his book is a masterly exposition of the Din-i-Ilahi of Akbar. The work is planned on an extensive scale, and is not only sound and instruc- tive but also highly interesting. After having surveyed the historical and cultural background of Akbar 's period, the author describes at length the various forces that were at work at that time. He then deals with the various religious communities, who, as important factors at the Court of Akbar, contributed their respective shares to the evolution of the Din-i-Ilahi the Sunnis, the Shias, the Hindus, the Jains, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the Parsis, the Jews and, last but not the least, the Christians. The author accurately summarises the results of the impact of these various communities at the Court of Akbar and the resultant trend xviii(fc) FOREWORD thereof which ultimately culminated in the estab- lishment of the Din-i-Ilahi. Covering, as the book does, an extensive ground, it is not possible that all the conclusions of the author will find ready acceptance. To take but one of the many controversial points in the book, I may refer to the author's conclusions about the religion of Akbar himself. It is well-known that various historians of Akbar 's period, and also his biographers, have come lo the conclusion that Akbar practically and some hold, even for- mally and openly renounced Islam. Of these, the late Mr. Vincent Smith, an eminent writer of Indian history, in his life of Akbar, is definitely of opinion that Akbar renounced Islam. The author does not share that view. He holds, on the contrary, that inspite of his having founded the Din-i-Ilahi, Akbar continued to be a Muslim to the last ; and he attributes, what he regards as a wrong conclusion on the part of Vincent Smith, to his having misread the original text on the subject. But the author is, no doubt, aware that almost all contemporary writers hold that he was not at all a believer in Islam. And it cannot be said that there are no reliable materials and data from which we may justly come to that conclusion. At the same time, students of Indian history of Akbar 's period will be deeply interested in the study of the facts brought together by the author in support of the view propounded by him that FOREWORD xviii(c) Akbar remained a Muslim to the last chapter of his life. It is not my duty to take sides in this highly interesting controversy between the author and several of his predecessors. But I have referred to this one particular point, as showing how the mate- rials of Indian history are still undergoing a process of re-interpretation, and to what extent the author has made a contribution towards it. His book is learned and luminous, and should attract wide attention in circles interested in the study of the Mughal period of Indian history. PATNA UNIVERSITY, } SACHCHIDANANDA SINHA, PATNA. [ Vice-Chancellor, The 1st July, 1941. l Patna University. PREFACE The history of India is yet to be written. Formerly we read the history of kings, queens, battles, and sieges. To-day we read the history of men and thoughts. The perspective of history has changed nay, it has been revolutionised. No longer a student is satisfied with the old review of things. History is now a science of man the man within, and the man in the world and outside. Every age has a philosophy of its own and man interprets that philosophy by the life he lives. History is the study of that philosophy interpret- ed by examples the actions of the individual unconsciously form the spokes in the wheel of progress. No event is isolated and no action is complete by itself. If the trasformation of energy explains the evolution of the Universe of matter, the individual thoughts and actions reveal and accelerate the progress of the Universe of mind. The present comes out of the womb of the past and the future is embedded in the present. There is an unbroken continuity through the past, present and future. In the onward flow of civilization, we some- times come across waves and curves which often find explanation in the actions of the individuals. But they must not be taken in isolation. They XX PREFACE generally form the parls of vaster current flowing through different channels. But they are nothing if not movements of the Universal current flowing through all ages. When there is a sudden up- heaval in one country at a particular period of time., there is a vibration in every direction in the common level. This is particulaily true of the great upheaval of the 16th century of Indian history I mean, the age of Akbar. It was an age of Renaissance in Europe, of Mehdi move- ment in Islam, IVIiug revival in China, and of the Sufi forces and Bhakti cult in India. In the 16th century of the Christian era, every civilised country in the world was pulsating with a new life ; new orders of things were on the anvil, vigorous dynasties appealed -in England the Tudors, in France the Bourbons, in Spain and Austria the Hapsburgs, in Prussia the Hohenzollems, in Turkey the Osmanlis, in Egypt the Mamluks, in Persia the Safavis, in Transoxiana the Saha- banids, in China the Mings, in India the Timurids all in the same period. Greatness of the indivi- dual k'ngs rather realised the spirit of the Age Henry VIII and Elizabeth in England, Henry IV in France, Fredrick William in Prussia, Sigismund in Austria, Philip II in Spain, Soleiman in Turkey, Shah Ismail and Shah Tahmasp in Persia, the Sahabani Khan in Transoxiana, Yung Lo in China and Babar and Akbar in India. Indeed the unison was perfect. PREFACE xxi European writers on the Timurids in India tried to explain the life and actions of the great Emperor Akbar as mere accidents. They made an isolated study of Akbar without reference to the Central Asian background, neglecting the unity of the Islamic movements of the period. The range of their study was circumscribed by the conception of history current in the 1 9th century . They interpreted the facts of Timurid India as mere isolated accidental happenings. Few of them tried to enter into the spirit that inspired the movement of Indian events their currents and cross currents. Their life was different and the perspective was exclusive. As such their interpretations of Indian history were coloured by their predilections. They depended on the contem- porary writers on Muslim India who were mere narrators of events. These writers were ecclesias- tics, merchants, adventurers and travellers. The scope of their writings was determined by the nature of the professions to which they belonged. Even stray acquaintance with Muslim chronicles did not alter their angle of vision, because almost all the Muslim chroniclers were mere writers of events (waqia nawis), and their conception of history may be gathered from the name they gave to history \" Tuoari^h \" (date records). Thus in the light of stereotyped conception of history, with materials of doubtful value furnished by contemporary European recorders of events *xii PREFACE and with chronicles maintained by Muslim chrono- logists at their command, the European historians failed in many cases to offer reliable interpretations of Indo-Muslim thoughts and events. Moreover most of the early English writers were obsessed with a feeling of superiority when they wrote the history of the conquered people of India specially of the Muslims from whom they conquered Hindu- stan. They laid stress on Akbar as a conqueror, as an empire-builder and as an administrator. They showered encomiums on Akbar for his personal qualities, for his versatility. Certainly Akbar deserves a good deal of what has been said of him as a builder of the Timurid empire in India and as a founder of some institutions which survive even to-day. But that is only one side of the medal. The explanation of Akbar 's life and contemporary events is incomplete unless they are treated in the spirit of the atmosphere he breathed, the ideals for which he stood and the cultural synthesis which he and his great associates brought about. The veil of seclusion that had concealed India from the gaze of the outside world was no longer there, she was no longer dead to the play of forces that were working in the con- temporary world. A mere narration of events of the age of the Emperor Akbar is not a satisfactory approach to the history of that important epoch of the Indians. Without a study of the cultural and intellectual activities of the Ibadat Khana PREFACE XXIU the first parliament of the religions of the world it is impossible to understand the forces and ideals for which India had been working for centuries. Indian civilisation has a wonderful capacity of assimilating extraneous currents and transmitting her own to others. The Din-i-Ilahi of Emperor Akbar clearly demonstrated how the Central Asian forces, winding their course through the Semitism of Arabia and filtering through the Monism of Iran, were ultimately Aryanised by the touch of Hindustan. The con- tribution of the different cultures, as represented in that great Hall of Worship, to the transformation and Indianisation of Islam was immense, though the process had already begun. Maintaining the basis of real Islam, the great savants of the age metamorphosed and crystallised the spirit of the age into a Sufi order, called the \" Din-i-Ilahi.\" Indeed, without the study of the Din-i-Ilahi, the history of the 16th-century India is incomplete. In this book I have attempted to offer an inter- pretation of the movement of forces that worked in India throughout this period and to estimate the contribution of Akbar to the new synthesis which characterised this very important epoch of Indian history. Before 1 conclude, I must acknowledge my thanks to Dr. Syamaprasad Mookerjee, M.A., B.L., D.Lin. , Barrister-at-Law, M.L.A., Ex-Vice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University, for the encouragement I received from him, and to Dr. S.

A., Ph.D., of Calcutta University, obliged me by ungrudingly suggesting some interesting interpretations of old facts. Prof. Priyaranjan Sen, M.A., P.R.S., Kavyatirtha, has placed me under a deep debt of gratitude by going through the MSS. Dr. R. P. Tripathi, M.A., D.Sc.

Zakaria, formerly editor of Mornin Gazette of Cawnpore, also deserves my gratefulness for interpreting the theological abstractions of Islam from the orthodox standpoint. Finally, I must thank Mr. D.

BHAGALPUR, ) M. L. R.-C. The 7th March, 1941. ) INTRODUCTION In the absence of any original work on the DlN-I-lLAHI, writers of the 19ih century interpreted the religion of Akbar according to theories current in the period. Western writers of the History of the East tended to bring everything Eastern into line with Western notions. Western political principles were accepted to be ideals of government. One point of similarity with the West in the life and manners of an Eastern Sovereign was supposed to be a feather in the cap of his greatness. Western political principles like \" a state has no connec- tion with religion,\" \"statecraft is a purely secular affair,\" \" the conception of a nation presupposes religious unity,\" and so forth, had become stand- ards of thought among historians. They too readily concluded influences and borrowings from the West in all such cases of similarity. In the absence of any treatise on Akbar's religion, historians gave full play to their fancies. Some found Akbar's religion \"to be the outcome of a political necessity, the need of a universal religion in which Hindoos and Muslims could join.\" According to them Akbar, like Elizabeth of England and Henry IV of France, \" was actuated by the motive of a compro- mise.\" A few asserted that \" Akbar became the supreme head of the Church because he wanted to D 1280B xxvi INTRODUCTION keep the warring factions at peace.\" Others judged Akbar from an entirely secular point, viewing his ordinances as very personal. They said that \" Akbar had a fondness for flattery, a weakness for adoration.\" One suggested that Akbar \" founded a new religion in order that he might pose himself as God or at least the vicegerent of God.\" 1 Another remarked, \" Akbar allowed pro- stration before himself because he liked to be treated as God on Earth.\" Remarks like these have been made and swallowed by unsuspecting readers as truths of history. They are generally astounding and pleasing and also easy to remember, being clad in familiar Western words. Few people take pains to enter into the sources of these remarks and fewer still have opportunity of seeing things through by examining the originals in a true spirit of inquiry. Even Dr. Smith, the author of \" Akbar the Great Mogul,\" did not hesitate to say, \"The whole scheme was the outcome of a ridiculous vanity, a monstrous growth of unrestrained autocracy. . . . The new faith was but a testimony to his grasping ambition, his pompous desire to be the Emperor, Pope and Prophet rolled into one. ... It was the love of power that induced Akbar to deny the authority of the Prophet and start a new religion.\" In Ain No. 77 Abul Fazl promised to write separately on Akbar as \"a Spiritual Guide 1 This is due to a misreading of Mul la Sheri's verse, which was a sarcasm quoted by Badauni. INTRODUCTION xxvn to the people,\" but sudden murder did not permit him to fulfil his pious intentions. The subject has been treated by Badauni in his \" Muntakhabu-t Twarikh.\" He has discussed the regulations of Akbar purely from the point of view of a Mulla. The \" Dabistan-i-Mazahib,'' a work written about 60 years after Akbar 's death, has discussed the principles of the religious views of the Emperor. Modern European writers have mostly based their conclusions on the testimonies of a hostile association in the court of the Emperor and of the Jesuits then in India. Badauni specially is the basis of Dr. Smith's conclusions, and what are Badauni 's credentials ? Abdul Qadir Badauni entered the court along with Abu 1 Fazl in 1572 and was put into office with Abul Fazl. Badauni lamented that the \" time- serving ' ' and ' ' flattering * ' Abul Fazl gradually rose higher and higher in the court while \"his own star\" remained in a \"static position.\" 2 Indeed it was really tormenting for Badauni to see his colleague and class-mate go so high up while he remained an ordinary courtier and \" leader of Wednesday piayers,\" 3 more than once for his 2 See J.R.A.S., 1869, Blochmann's article on Badauni. Badauni seems to have been no less time-serving. Though he criticised Sijdah, he himself made Zaminbos (Sijdah) three limes. 3 Abul Fazl and Badauni read together under Shaikh Mubarak. Both were good students and were well-read. Badauni grew jealous of Abul Fazl's rise, and his personal grudge and jealousy were vented in his discussions round the religious views of Akbar, Abul Fazl and Faizi. xxvin INTRODUCTION incapacity and for overstaying leave he was driven out of office, only to be reinstated on the recom- mendations of Faizi. Badauni was so charitable and grateful that he never used a word in favour of his benefactor, Faizi ! * Badauni thus describes the death-bed scene of Faizi, \" The Emperor went to visit him when he was on his last gasp; Faizi barked like a dog *'n his face, his face was swollen and his lips had become black. ...\" Then he composed a monogram on the death of the famous poet : ' ' A dog has gone from the world in an abomin- able state/' () And yet another : \" Faizi the inauspicious, the enemy of the Prophet, Went bearing on him the brand of curses, He was a miserable and hellish dog, and hence The words * what dog-worshipper had died ' give the date of his birth.*' 7 Hatred of Badauni for Faizi was so violent that he could not even condescend to praise the poems of Faizi. Badauni remarks, \" His (Faizi 's) taste is lewd, raving in boastful verses and infidel * Badauni, Muntakhbu-t TwarikH, II, Lowe, p. 420. 5 Ibid, p. 420. 1003 A.H. (one year short). 7 1004 A.H. INTRODUCTION xxix scribblings. He was entirely devoid of love of truth, of the knowledge of God.\" But Faizi was made the Poet-Laureaute by the Emperor and had composed about 20,000 couplets. His command over rhetoric, we know, has not yet been surpassed, and, as a poet, Faizi is a class by himself. Still, in his hatred for Faizi, Badauni says, \" He (Faizi) wrote poetry for a period of 40 years, but it was all imperfect. He could set up the skeleton of verses well but the bones had no marrow in them, and the salt of his poetry was entirely without savour.\" Badauni does not find \" even one couplet amongst them that is not as much without fire as his withered genius, and they are despised and rejected to such an extent that no one, even in lewdness, studies his verse as they do those of the other base poets.\" Badauni could not tolerate even the slightest difference of opinion. He seldom alludes to Birbal as other than a \" hellish dog.\" Muhammad of Basakwan, a learned man of Timur's time, is called \" hyprocrite and filthy \" because he had written * ' Titul \" \" science of the expressed and implied language.\" Badauni deplores his own fate because he had to translate the Ramayana into Persian, for in course of translation he had to write the names of Hindu Gods like Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. At Lahore a Shia was killed by a Sunni, for \" the former had spoken disrespectfully of the xxx INTRODUCTION first four Khalifas.\" Baclauni had no words of pity for the murdered man, who, he wrote, \" has the face like that of a pig,\" but \" the Sunni murderer was a hero.\" When his own son died, he attri- buted the untimely death to his not reading the Quran at his birth. So far as religion was concerned, Badauni was essentially the type of a Sunni who does not only hate a non-believer but who cannot even stand the sight of one who would not believe in things which he had faith in. In his blind fanaticism he ceased to be a historian while he dealt with the religious views of Akbar. He distorted and suppressed facts to suit his own conclusions. He quoted only por- tions of the regulations of Akbar, because quotations of them in toto would defeat his purpose. For example : along with the killing of cows, Akbar prohibited the killing of camels, horses, dogs and other domestic animals. But Badauni quoted only apart of the Ain, 0/z., that regarding the killing of cows, and so proved Akbar to be anti-Islam because cow is sacred to the Hindus. 8 \" From* such a man like Badauni can we expect that Akbar 's deviations from religious orthodoxy would find no favour,\" and \"we have to discount his stories concerning the same as being certainly exag- gerated.\" Even Khafi Khan is of opinion that 8 Similar references will be quoted when we discuss the \" Aint \" (regulations} of Akbar. See post, pp. 226-68. * Pringle Kennedy, History of the Mongols, Vol. I, pp. 285-86. INTRODUCTION xxxi Badauni ought not to have said and written of Akbar as he had done. 30 Akbar was a king who would not only reign but would also rule. He would, unlike others before him, not willingly be a tool in the hands of a Mulla theocracy. In course of his administration he found that the Mullas and the Qazis had interfered too much with affairs of state, often with corrupt motives and pernicious results. He turned many Qazis out of their offices for bribery ; many were deprived of their \" Aymas.\" n Some Qazis were angry that Brahmins had been engaged in deciding disputes in which Hindus were concerned as accused or in which both the parties were Hindus ; also because the . highest court of appeal was no longer the Sadr-us-Sadur or Makhdum-ul-Mulk but the Emperor himsef . Christians who came to the court of Akbar were mostly Jesuit priests. They were by no means historians, and the despatches, reports and letters which they sent to their masters at home or at the eastern central station at Goa, were mostly reli- gious in nature. References to contemporary events are certainly to be found in them but they are to be judged very critically before they car be accepted as materials of history. Their W Seir-al Mutakharin, Vol. I, p. 196. 11 For religious endowments, see Badauni, of>. ci'r., Vol. II, Lowe, p. 207. Some Qazis were exchanged for horses at Qandahar after the Bengal rebellion for political reasons, xxxii INTRODUCTION despatches mostly dealt with religious matters and v/ere often coloured by their own religious predi- lections, so deep rooted in the Christians of the 16th century. Their perspective was never historical they wrote whatever came in their way, without taking caie to verify them. When Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut, he thought he saw Christian churches there ; in- them he heard Christian bells, recognised Christian shepherds known as Kafir, and noticed a Nayar who wore top-knot to show that he belonged to Christianity ! 12 Vasco da Gama's statement was accepted as true for 200 years. Then it was found out that the Churches referred to, were nothing but domes of the Hindu temples of Siva, which appeared to be like the churches of the Portuguese; the bells referred to were those rung by Hindus at the time of their evening prayers ; and the priests mentioned were none other than the Brahmin priests of the Temple. Such is some- times the standard of accuracy of the Portuguese travellers or missionaries who visited the country in the early days of Christian advent ! Dr. Smith has often emphasised the versions of the Western writers without caring to judge them in the light of unbiassed criticism. Take, for example, the story of the fall of Asirgarh. Asirgarh fell, according to Abul Fazl, owing to 12 Payne, Scenes and Characteis from Indian History, pp. 90-92. INTRODUCTION xiii the pestilence which carried away 25,000 men from the fort and owing to the \" devices ** of Akbar; but according to \"Relacam \" of Guerreiro, whose account was the source for Du Jarric, the fort fell on account of the treachery of the Emperor. Accord- ing to Dr. Smith, the account of Father Xavier is literally true and \" deserving of acceptance as being the most authentic history of the events which led to the capitulation of Asirgarh.\" Smith's \" Akbar the Great Mogul,' 1 p. 276.) The learned historian denounced the Indian versions as deliberate forgeries and systematic distortions of facts. The account of the Jesuit Father does not exist in the original. The version of* Du Jarric is based on Relacam is a word- for-word translation of what is given in Relacam. Smith claims that he subjected Du Jarric's account to a critical examination and states that Du Jarric had summarised the letters of Xavier. Dr. Smith says that the \" Histoire \" of Du Jarric contains a detailed account of the siege. He also asserts that Guerreiro in his Relacam gives no details and confirms Du Jarric's statement that the capitulation was obtained by treachery. But as a matter of fact, Guerreiro gives a detailed account of the siege and not Du Jarric whose account ie rather ' ' a word-for-word translation of that given in Relacam.\" It is strange that Dr. Smith makes references to and gives quotations from Relacam, Part 1 , the actual volume where the account pf the E-I280B INTRODUCTION siege occurs; but he has not compared Du Jarric's version with Guerreiro's and found out the truth,. Possibly Dr. Smith was very imperfectly acquainted with these two works. Payne says that the Portuguese were often wrongly informed or even hoaxed, and we are compelled to share his views in the light of facts. What were Dr. Smith's conclusions about the siege of AsirgarhP He says that Father Xayier was present at the siege and hence his version cannot be untrue. But our reading of the facts proves that Father Xavier was not present at the siege of Asirgarh. Had Father Xavier been really present there, he would surely have mentioned the great famine which had caused so much havoc Amongst the defenders of the fort which we get . from all contemporary authors, namely, Faizi Sar- hindi, Abul Fazl and the author of Zafar-ul-Walih (Arabic history of Gujrat). Again, the account of the murder of Muqarib Khan by Akbar during the siege, as given by the Jesuit, is against all evidence. We know it for certain, from direct evidences of Faizi Sarhindi and of Zafar-ul-Walih, that the death of Muqarib was a case of suicide. But Xavier says that Muqarib was killed by Akbar. Further, the very name of Bahadur Khan, the king of Khandesh, against whom the war was going on, has been wrongly put by the Jesuit Father. It, therefore, becomes difficult to believe that the Portuguese writer was present at the siege. INTRODUCTION XX*V Dr. Smith rejects the account of Abul Fazl as entirely baseless and deliberate falsification, on the ground that he has not mentioned the treachery of Akbar in connection with the fall of Asirgarh. 18 We are sorry to say that Dr. Smith has not gone carefully through Abul Fazl's version in Akbar- nama. In Volume III, Akbarnama definitely men- tions the deceptions and simulations practised by Akbar to procure the capitulation of the fort ; so where is the attempt of Abul Fazl to hide it? We would say with Rev. Payne that \"Dr. Smith's references are equally misleading and inaccurate and his investigation is of a perfunctory nature.\" u Regarding the honesty of Abul Fazl's account let us quote the remark of Price in his Preface to Elliot's Volume VI. lc Price observes, \" His (Abul Fazl's) veneration for the Emperor amounted almost to adoration. Apart from occasional blemishes, his faults are those of the rhetorician rather than of the flatterer, and his style ought to be judged by an oriental standard, not by a contrast with the choicest of European memoirs.\" Blochmann says, \" Abul Fazl has far too often been accused by European writers of flattery, and even of wilful concealment of facts damaging to the reputation of his master. A study of the Akbar- Smith, op. cit., p. 284. 14 Payne, Intro., op. eft., p. xxxv. U Elliot and Dowton, Vol. VI, pp. 7-8, xvi INTRODUCTION nama will show that the charge is absolutely unfounded/' (J.R.A.S., 1869, article on Badauni by Blochnann.) Dr. Smith has taken the Jesuit accounts regard- ing Akbar's religion as gospel truth, because Badauni 's versions tally with theirs on many points. But we must say that both were actuated by similar motives, and often Badauni and the Mulla party supplied information for the Jesuit writers. The Jesuit priests came to India with the motive of converting the \"Mogors,\" 10 and there have been similar attempts by Christian priests for converting the \"Mogors of Central Asia.\" At first, when Akbar's invitation reached the Jesuits, they thought that the Emperor's motives were political 17 ; and so it was only after a good deal of hesitancy that the highest Jesuit priest decided to send a Mission. To start with, they were all praise for Akbar. The encomiums used by the members of the first Mission are often so flattering that they seem to have been written by hired eulogists. On reaching Agra the Fathers began to collect information about the Emperor, and in their credulity they eagerly swallowed all they heard about him. It was certainly a revolution from the point of view of M Pringle Kennedy, op. cir., VoL'.I, Chap, I. 17 De Sousa, Oriente Conquistado, Vol. II, p. 150. There was a suspicion in the mind of the Governor of Goa that Akbar might keep the Fathers as hostages. Moreland is of opinion that Akbar would have ailed the Jesuits even if all political motive* we*e absent. INTRODUCTION . xxxvii the Mullas and the orthodox party that Akbar, a iMuslim Emperor, should go beyond the usual Sunni interpretations and consult non-Mulsims for his 'knowledge.' Hence, they began to manu- facture and circulate all sorts of ' news and views ' regarding the Emperor. The Fathers simply despatched those calumnious bits of information to their headquarters in India and Europe. As the Emperor began to enquire more and more about Truth, and as they found their chances of converting the Emperor growing remote every day, they also began to grow cold. Again, when they found the Emperor giving them audience and permitting them to make conversions and build churches, they grew elated ; at once followed despatches narrating all the stories of the Emperor's apostasy with all the prospects of conversion. The Fathers wrote that all the mosques at Lahore had been ordered to be demolished and that the study of the Quran had been suspended in the Empire. Du Jarric avows that \" Akbar promised to become a Christian even at the cost of his kingdom in case the Fathers would explain to him the Trinity and incarnation.\" 18 The Portuguese and the Jesuits are often so inconsistent amongst themselves that if we 11 Similar passages occur in almost all Jesuit narratives. Maclagan ays, \" Akbar would have become Christian but for his wives, for if he became Christian he would have to forsake his wives all except one.\" Du Jarric says, \" Akbar actually distributed all hi* wives amongst hit courtiers and kept only one,\" nxvui INTRODUCTION compare them (specially regarding the story of Akbar 's death), it becomes palpable that the Fathers had first-hand knowledge in very few things. 10 Even the ordinary state regulations of Akbar have been condemned and interpreted by the Mullas with distrust and suspicion. Badauni was very angry with Akbar because he had opened ' ' Dharampura ' ' and \" Yogipura \" for \"non- believers.\" Social and political regulations have been interpreted and interdicted from a religious point of view. A charge against Akbar is that he stopped pilgrimage to Mecca. But we know it definitely, from the testimony of the third Mission, that, even in the last years of his life, he sent members of his family to Mecca on pilgrimage. During the period of the so-called transition (1 572-82) he had given every intending pilgrim a sum of Rs. 600 as passage money. A regular department, known as the Haji Department, had been started and was placed under an officer, Mir-i-Haj. This department had one hundred ships (Jahaz-i-llahi) reserved for the pilgrims. There are evidences that Akbar used to send clothes and presents to Mecca as a part of religious duty, and that he was contem- plating the foundation of a pilgrim house at Mecca. During the discussions of the Ibadat Khana, it wa 1* French traveller Laval says, \" Akbar promised to become a Christian and gave hopes that he would become a Christian, should he be permitted all his wives, as his religion allowed, and pending the solution of tlie question, he died\" INTRODUCTION xxxix, found that the Mir-i-Haj and Sadr, who were the guardians of the Pilgrim Fund, had embezzled money. Mirza Azam Khan, 20 a staunch Musalman, returned from Mecca with a great disgust for the Sharif s of Mecca for their corrupt practices. Condi- tions in the Holy Land were in no sense better than those in India. Owing to Portuguese piracy, journey to Mecca by sea was no longer safe. Tickets issued by Christian shipowners bore the pic- ture of Mary on their back. The orthodox could not condescend to accept a ticket with a picture, for it would be countenancing idolatry. The route by land was controlled by the Qazibillis (Shias of Persia) and the life of a Sunni was never, safe in the land of the Shias. Akbar for some time discouraged pilgrimage to Mecca from the point of view of state policy. Even a staunch Musalman like Sekandar Lodi had stopped Haj for women and regulated pilgrimage. 21 Akbar made regulations for the pilgrims and not against the institution of pilgrimage. * There were some other regulations to which exception may be taken from a religious point of view. The customary words at the top of a book \" Bhmillah-ir-Rahman-ir Rahim\" were changed into * ' A llah-o-A kbar. ' ' The Mullas suggested that the new words were a sly substitution of the '<> Bad., Lowe, Vol. H, p. 412; Bloehmann, A in, p. 32*. * Taiikhi Dawdi, E. & D. f Vol. IV. pp. 445-46. xl INTRODUCTION personal name of Akbar for that of God. 22 Badauni rebuked Abul Fazl for this innovation and inter- dicted him as an apostate. 23 But we find Faizi beginning his famous book ' * Naldaman ' ' with the customary \" Bismillah, etc.\" It was no innovation in Islam to begin books without \"Bismillah, etc.\" This epithet \" Bismillah, etc.,\" is an imitation of the Persian Zoroastrian phrase ' * Banam-i~ Bakshainda-i-Bafyhshaishgar-i-Meherban.' >24 (In the name of God the charitable and the merciful.) It has not been everywhere in use. \" Ka/uih,\" an Arabic Grammar by Ibn-i-Hajib, does not contain the customary words in praise of God. In Sharah-i-Jami and Tahrir-i-Sambat, commentaries on that book, absence of the customary words in praise of God have been discussed and Ibft-i- Hajib has been supported. There are many books which begin with \" Alhamdu-lillah \" instead of \" Bismilla, etc.\" Even some orthodox Muslims do not write the long customary sentence but simply put the name of God, through the numerals 786, on their books. Akbar was quite a good Musalman but the sad fact is that he had, on account of his state regulations, displeased the orthodox theocracy. The 1 6th century was a century of upheavals : no civilised country escaped the wave of Renaissance, 11 Badauni, op. cit., Lowe, Vol. II, pp, 212, 267. \" Ibid., p. 210. 14 Jamshedji Lumji Api, Jartash-nama, Preface. INTRODUCTION xli and forces were working from different directions and at different angles. The life and actions of Akbar cannot be explained by themselves without their context. The forces that had been working in him, were not Indian only. The psychology of Akbar was a complex phenomenon ; unlike, Asok he was an emperor first and a priest next. In the first chapter, we have described the setting of the Indian stage on which Akbar appeared. The time was propitious, and the ground had been prepared by the Hindu Saints and Muslim Sufis. A spirit of eclecticism and fusion was on the anvil. Forces were at work which would have moulded the life of Akbar even without many of the polititical events. In the second chapter, the hereditary traits (of Chengiz and Timur and of their families) have been depicted. Inspite of all the liberal tendencies of the age, Akbar could not be absolutely free from the Central Asian influences. Many of the social regulations of Akbar can be explained by a refer- ence to the manners and customs of his ancestors. The third chapter shows that Akbar was by birth a mystic, by heredity a lover of knowledge, by experiences of early life impressionable and by court influences a Sunni. Here we notice the extremely devout bent of Akbar 's temperament. The foundation of the Ibadat Khana was a testimony to his reverence and faith in God and Islam and it was not the fruit of his scepticism and apostasy. F 1280B xlii INTRODUCTION The fourth chapter deals with the discussions in the Ibadat Khana. Akbar was amazed at the variety of interpretations of the Texts. The Ibadat Khana, which, to start with, was a hall of worship for the Sunnis, was thrown open to other sections of Islam, and, ultimately, also to non-Muslims. The Ibadat Khana became a real parliament of religions. On the other hand, Akbar was disgusted by the discovery of the dishonesty of the Qazi department in the distribution of lands, of the Sadr in the grant of religious endow- ments, and of the Mir-i-Haj in the administration of pilgrim grants. Akbar had to issue many regula- tions for reasons of state, which the Mullas inter- preted from the religious point of view. In Appendix A to this chapter the extra- Indian forces, especially of Bagdad and Teharan, leading to the acceptance of Mahzar, have been examined. In Appendix B to this chapter, three paintings have also been examined. They illustrate the religious practices of Akbar and of some courtiers and their environments. The fifth chapter finds that the ever-expanding soul of Akbar could no longer be satisfied by the Mulla interpretations of the laws of God. The Ibadat Khana was thrown open to non-Muslims also Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Zoroastrians, Jew and Christians. Here we have estimated the influences of the different forces at work and their INTRODUCTION xliii respective contributions to the psychological changes in Akbar. In the sixth chapter, a classified summary of the Ains regulations have been given, though, strictly speaking, the life of a Musalman follows no such classification : to the orthodox there is nothing purely religious and nothing purely secular. We have discussed the different backgrounds of these regulations ; it has been shown that Akbar hardly ever did anything which was not allowed by i the Quran or the Hadis or by some of his predecessors. In an Appendix to this chapter the life of Badauni and his Mulla standpoint have been elabo- rately discussed, with a view to depicting the spirit and angularity of the contemporary theocratic mind. In the seventh chapter the Din-i-Uahi has been discussed. The principles from the Persian texts have been given. The ceremonies, initiations and symbols connected with the religion have been described. In the last chapter the Din-i~Hahi in practice has been described. We have stated the reasons for its non-acceptance by all and sundry and the non-missionary character of the religion. Akbar did not want that this Sufi cult should be accepted by each and every one. Incidentally we have tried to show that Akbar never renounced Islam and that he was a Mussalman all through his life. An estimate of Akbar in relation to the Din-i-Ilahi has been given. CHAPTER I THE INDIAN BACKGROUND Certainly instances are not wanting when Muslim monarchs have been guilty of crimes in the name of religion in spite of Commandments to the contrary. Timur has been credited with having killed 6,000,000 human beings, only \" to change his land of the infidels into that of the believers \" (Darul Harb into Darul Islam). After the victory at Ajmer, he was greeted with a turret of welcome built of 70,000 heads of the slaughter- ed and they were not unbelievers. One hundred thousand men were butchered at Sirusthi (Srabas- thi) and all in the name of Islam. 1 Sultan Bayezid would kill at least two Christians every day to celebrate his meals 2 : the dying shrieks of the victims would be the music to his dinner. Sekan- dar Lodi slaughtered 15,000 Hindus in one day to prove his love for Islam. He stopped the bath- ing of the Hindu pilgrims in the Jamuna at Allahabad and forbade the barbers from shaving heads of pilgrims.\" Hundreds of similar instances 1 In regard to these facts, we are indebted to Historians who, out of fanaticism, added to the list of crimes of their heroes. In their eyes, the larger number of victims, attributed to the religious zeal of their heroes, made them greater still in the eyes of the Muslim world. 2 Lane-Poole (Turkey. Story of Nations series\\ pp. 46-73. 3 Titus, Indian Islam, pp. 11-12, 2 THE DIN-MLAHI could be given to prove the spirit of intolerance, and bigotry, in the believers. In fact there are A/A/.jAx / AxA/A^^A / passages in the Quran j**j-*jU-SLS L^^ ^j&jXjJ|j (\"And kill them wherever you find them\"), 4 which has been construed as \" giving permission to kill.\" In spite of these commands supposed to justify the slaughter of infidels which were given purely from secular points of view, we find revelations in the Quran which breathe an atmosphere of tolera- tion to the non-believers and of a compromise with them. \" He professed his good- will to the Chris- tians, as an inclinable to entertain friendship for the true believers.\" He exhorted his followers \" not to dispute, but in the mildest manner,\" against those \" who have received the Scriptures, and ushered to come to a just determination between both parties, that they all worshipped not any but God.\" \" Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian but one resigned unto God 4 Chap. II, Verse 191. There has been much comment on this verse. The adverse critics of Islam have opined that, in this verse, the Quran has given ' permission to kill.* But this v'erse must he read along with the previous one. The pionoun \" them \" has its noun in the verse preceding, which has permitted the believers to\" war with those who fight with you*' ^believers). V. 190. Southern*' refers to those who fight with the Muslims. Thus in Verse 191, the Quran permitted the killing of those who were fighting with the believers. It is an occasional commandment, not a general command. Even in this permission, we read a note of toleration, for the Quran says, \" Do not exceed the limits ; surely Allah does not like those who exceed the limits.\" Verse 190, Chap. II. THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 3 (Muslim) \" ; \" excellence is in the hand of God ; He gives it unto whom He pleases.\" Muhammad further permitted the professors of every religion certain rights \" about which He prohibits all disputes.\" The document enunciated after the battle of Badr, which was meant for the Christians and Jews, is a wonderful testimony to the spirit with which the Prophet was animated . Lastly the Prophet says, \" If the Lord had pleased, verily all who are on the earth, would have believed in general, wilt thou therefore, forcibly compel men to be true believers ? No soul can believe but by the per- mission of God.\" David Shea and Antony Troyer are constrained to admit that although ' ' followers too often gave by their conduct a strong denial to these principles, still the existence of them in the Quran was a sanction to all those who were dispos- ed to profess them in words and actions/' In the early history of the Muslim Khalifas, we find in- stances of tolerance of which any nation or religion might be proud. Omar ordered payment of compensation for damages done to the people of the country through which he passed during his Syrian expedition. Omar was so tolerant that he was willing to say his prayers in a Christian Church at Jerusalem. When Muhammad bin Qasim sent information of his exploits to his Khalifa that he had demolished temples, converted Hindus to Islam and successfully waged war against them, the Khalifa \" reprimanded him, for it 4 THE DIN-MLAHI was against sanction and usage of the Holy Law and ordered Qasim to compensate the damages done by him.\" 5 The conduct of the Muslims in Spain when they dominated the Christians, is in contrast with the conduct of the Christians after their victory in the East. If that spirit were always translated into action, the history of Islam would have been written otherwise. When Islam stepped beyond the limits of Arabia, it came into contact with men of different outlooks on life, and the influence of this foreign contact silently worked themselves into Islam. If Arabia had conquered Persia physically, the victim conquered the victor intellectually. When Islam came into contact with the Turks and other nomad tribes of Central Asia, the Turki converts were amazed by the idea of the unity of God and the Islamic principle of universal brotherhood. They were lured by a prospect of a heaven in Islam, glorious with all its mundane joys. This could be secured by a war which would either make him a Shahid (a martyr to the cause of religion) or a Gazi (a killer of enemy), and heaven was both for a Shahid and a Gazi. For these blood-thirsty people, Islam offered two worlds power in this world and peace in the next. Consequently, in their hands, the true precepts of Islam underwent distortion, as was the case with Christianity in the 5 Elphinstone, pp. 302-03. THL INDIAN BACKGROUND 5 hands of the barbarian conquerors of Europe. The Turki converts changed Islam to suit their own instincts in their own way. A careful study of the early Turks and Afghans, who first invaded, conquered and ruled over Hindusthan, would prove the truth of our statement. Often these invaders had personal motives of conquest ; but when they found that a religious incentive would give a fresh urge, they took advantage of it and declared Jehad war in the name of religion. Thus, the historian Utbi G says of Mahmud of Gazni that he (Mahmud of Gazni) '* demolished idol temples and established Islam in them. He captured cities, killed the polluted wretches, des- troying the idolatrous and gratifying Muslims.'* He then returned home and \" promulgated accounts of the victories obtained for Islam and vowed that every year he would undertake a holy war against Hind.\" This spirit of Muhammadan conquest is in sad contrast with that of the first Muslim administration of Sind under the orders of .the Khalifa. Hasan Nizami 7 says of Muhammad of Ghor, \" he (Ghor) purged by his sword, the land of the Hind from the filth of infidelity and vice, and freed the whole of that country from the thorn of God-plurality and the impurity of idol-worship, and by his royal vigour and his intrepidity left not one 6 Tilus, p.

The inscription on the temple is a very interesting study regarding the motives of Iltutmish. 8 Alauddin, in spite of his anti-Mulla perorations, would not hesitate to des- troy temples, and he erected pulpits and arches of mosques in their place. 9 The peculiar mentality of the much praised Firoz Shah Tughluq, the flower of the Turko- Afghan period, was the type of attitude of the best O f the early Muslim conquerors. When Timur-Lang had come to India, the religious objective of the Muslim invaders had been condensed and formulated ; a specimen of this we read in the speeches of Timur on the eve of his Indian expedition, \" My object in the invasion of Hindustan is to lead an expedition against the infidels that, according to the law of Muham- mad, we may convert to the true faith the people of that country, and purify the land itself from filth of infidelity and polytheism ; and that we may over- throw their temples and idols and become Gazis and Mujahids before God.\" 10 Is he not that Timur who led all his expeditions against the believers except in Georgia and partly India ?

Is he not that Timur who destroyed the accredited leader of Islam, we mean the Khalifa, and himself took the title of Khalifat-ul-lillah ? In the name of religion, they excited their soldiers and themselves. In the lands of the non-Muslims, Turks, Afghans, Pathans and Mughal invaders carried the message of death in the name of Muhammad and Islam, and left no stone unturned to convert the land of non-believers into a land of believers. But in spite of all possible attempts to convert the Hindus to Islam, Islam could not make much headway in India. The Hindus with their age- long culture and deep-rooted religious convictions would not easily change their faith. The old Brahmin n (Zunnar-Dar) at the time of Firoz Shah Tughluq and Bhudan at the time of Sekandar Lodi would willingly and gladly offer their lives rather than change their religion ; at places the lees of society changed their religion to avoid Jezia or to avoid persecution ; but mass conversions could not take place. The Hindu masses remained loyal to their ancient faith. The fundamental outlooks of the two faiths are so different that volunlaiy con- versions of the upper class Hindus were few and far between. Still, in course of time, the followers of the two faiths, by long association with each \" Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi, E & D., Vol. HI. p. 365. 8 THE DIN-I-ILAHI other, by a community of interests in daily life, by a community of problems in politics, un- consciously approached each other. Even the most orthodox converts would not and could not give up the manners and customs which had been rooted into them for centuries. The Muslim conquest in India by Turko-Afghans was never thorough as it was in Persia by Arabs. 12 The Turks, Afghans and Pathans, who attempted the earliest conversion in India, were satisfied with the lip-service of the converts the reading of Kalema and the change of name as in China. Further the Indian conversions were piecemeal and scarcely general. Thus one brother became a Muhammadan while the rest of the family con- tinued to be Hindus living in the same village a$d locality ; one had to borrow the manners and cus- toms of the other. At all stages of social psycho- logy, local instinct always plays an important part. In the Punjab specially, where the activity of the Turks was most prominent, the tribal and local bond has been always stronger than the religious bond. 73 So an approach to fusion was more pos- sible in the Punjab on the common ground of customs rather than on the ground of religious 12 Arnold is of opinion that if India had been conquered by the Arabs instead of by the Turks, Afghans and Pathans, the preaching of Islam would have been different and with different results. 13 See transactions of the Third International Congress for the History of Religions, Vol. I, p. 314.

Sitala, the goddess of pox, is worshipped by Pindi Musalmans. Even frontier Muhammadans pay respect to the goddess of pox. The Avars of N. W. Punjab and the Bhats of U. P. use Bramhins as their family priests. The Maimans of Kutch ascetics besmear their bodies with ashes like Hindu Brahmins. The Musalman ** Suttars \" of the Punjab carry a \" danda \" (staff) and keep singing. The Sadique Nihang (in Jhang district, the Punjab) Muslim Faqirs keep going a fire called \" dhuni.\" n In U. P. Chuni- hars worship * ' Kalka Mai ' ' and observe the Sradh ceremony in imitation of the Hindus. Lakshmi Devi is worshipped by the Turknowasof Eastern Bengal. Songs of Lakshmi are still sung by Muslim Faqirs in Western Bengal villages. According to some, the Mushkil-asan cult of Bengal is a relic of the fire- worship of the Hindus. The \" Dude-Kulas \" of Madras worship tools in the Dashera holidays as do the Hindus in the Biswa Karma Festival. The ' Sada-Sohag * sect (founded in the 1 5th century) wear women's dress like the devotees of Bechna Devi near Ahmadabad. 15 14 Punjab Customary Laws ; Islam in Kashmere, by Ramcharan Kak, in the Journal of Indian History, 1928.

M Sen, 21. 2-1280B 10 THE DIN-MLAHI Panch Pir and Pir Badr are still worshipped by the boatmen of Hindu and Musalman sects in Bengal ; Satya Narayan Pir is a combination of Hindu god Narayan and Muslim Satya Pir. The Baul cult is an extreme form of Hindu-Muslim sublimation. The Holi, Dewali, Dashera, Basanta- Panchami and Baisakhi festivals are attended both by Hindus and Musalmans together. Same is the case with the Muhurrum. In Kashmir, the Muslims still worship the tutelary godlings of their villages, join Hindu festivals and employ Brahmins at their marriage ceremonies. The Malkana Rajputs, though converts to Islam, are reluctant to describe themselves as Musalmans. Their names are Hindu. They use \" Ram, Ram \" in their saluta- tions and greetings ; they mostly worship in Hindu temples, though, at times, they frequent mosques and practise circumcision and bury their dead. The Matia Kunbis, who were converted to Muhammadanism by Islam Shah Pirana in the 1 5th century, employ Brahmin priests and refuse to eat with their Muhammadan brethren. The Rasul Shahis of the Punjab drink wine and claim to con- trol superhuman deeds by means of \"Tantia \" an \"Yoga.\" In the process of this fusion, the effortless attempts of the saints and faqirs, Hindu and Muhammadan, had done much more than the thousand and one swords of the Islamic conquerors. For, the appeal was to a subtler and softer side THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 11 of man, where the ordinary calculations of loss and gain could not weigh much. The Dargha (Muslim pulpits) became a resort of both Hindus and Mus- lims (1072 A.D.). When Mukhdum Sayid Ali (al Hadjwari) found his resort at Lahore and laid down his mortal remains there, 1<J his grave imme- diately became a place of pilgrimage for both Hindus and Muhammadans^ Even to-day, the Bhathi Darwaza of Lahore is a haunt for the Hindu Muslim saints. 17 The Chishti-cult brought by the illustrious saint Mainuddin Chishti to India, is a landmark in the history of Indo-Muslim religious thoughts. He chose a place near the Hindu pilgrimage of Pushkar at Ajmer. His name and reputation spread far and wide and his lustre fell upon India like the rays of the sun and he is called Aftab-i-mulk-i-Hind, \" the sun of the land of Hindusthan.\" The Hindus were so much influ- enced by the Chishti-cult that we find round about Ajmer a sect called the Husaini Brahmins, who combine the Muslim religion with Hindu manners and customs and rituals. They claim to be Brahmins and declare the Atharva Veda to be their sacred book but at the same time they observe the fast of Ramjan as much as they observe Sivaratri. 18 16 For a list of the Muslim Saints and Suns in India, see Akhbar- ul-Akhiar, by Abdul Haqq (1572 A. D.). 37 Ganj Bakhsh's contribution to this fusion in the Punjab is interesting 18 A very sacred fast of the Hindus in honour of their god Shiva \"* 12 THE DIN-I-ILAH1 They beg alms in the name of Hasan, grandson of the Prophet ; they bury the dead ; practise circum- cision; their males wear Muslim dress and use \" Tilak \" 19 on their forehead, but the females dress like Hindu ladies and use vermilion on their fore- head. They style themselves as \"Mian Thakur.\" Just opposite to this, we find Karim Shah becoming a disciple of a Vaishnava saint and repeating Hindu \"Om. ' 20 TheKakas of Gujrat (15th century) have been so much Hinduised that they still retain their Hindu names and follow all Hindu customs though their preceptors are faqirs. Malik Muham- mad Jaisi (1540 A.D.) composed a very beautiful allegorical lyric called \" Padmavat \" on the relation between \" atma \" and \" paramatma.\" Alwal composed a \" Mahabharat \" and sang the praise of Siva. 21 Mirza Hasan AH produced hymns in honour of the goddess Kali ; Kulliyat-i-nazir is a treatise on the greatness of \"Sri Krishna.\" The Batyana sect made a considerable approach to Hindu Yoga and Tantra; they began to write books on \"Yoga/' \" Asan,\" \" Deha-Tatwa,\" \" Shat- Chakra.\" 22 In the Punjab, these books are still found in many of the old families. 23 19 Sacred marks of sandal or vermilion, a custom of orthodox Hindus. 20 The symbol of the highest Trinity of Hinduism. 21 History of Bengali Language, p. 793; Hindu Gods in Muslim Poetry, by Dinesh Chandra Sen, p. 25. 22 K M Sen, \" Madhya Juge Bharater Sadhana.\" 23 Ibid., pp. 21-25. THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 13 The great Chaitanya of Bengal (1484 A.D.^ allowed both Hindus and Muhammadans to become his disciples. Yavan Haridas was one of his most important disciples. Rup and Sanatan, two of his important disciples, were so very tolerant to Muslim converts to Vaisnavism that the orthodox Vaisnavas and Hindus refused to have any social intercourse with them. Ramanand, the great saint, ranks a Muhammadan weaver, Kabir, as his first disciple. He protested against caste and put faith in love of God above caste and rituals of religion. To him, \" there is no question of caste and rank before God. He, who 1 devotes himself to God, is God.\" Kabir was the personification of the process of Hindu-Muslim fusion in mediaeval India. He attacked the ortho- dox Hindu institutions like ' ' Tirtha ' ' (pilgrimage) \"Upabash\" (fast), \"Vrata\" (rites), \"Mala\" (beads) and \" Tilak \" (marks). 2 * Kabir 's great friend was saint Taqi of the Sahr- wardi sect. His daughter Kamal was married to a Brahmin. When he was charged with apostacy before Sekandar Lodi, he defended himself by saying that his definite aim was to unite Hindus and Musalmans. His followers, Kabirpanthis, remember God along with their breath, in the manner of the Hindu Yogis. Even women were allowed to become his disciples and Gangabai was 74 \" Hindi-ke Musalman Kabi,\" p. 35. Some say that Kamal was a disciple of Kabir. 14 THE DIN-MLAHI one of them. The great saints Ravidas and Nam- deb were contemporaries of Kabir and were much influenced by him. Ravidas was a *' Chamar,\" a cobbler, and his disciple was the Queen Jahli of Mewar. Kabir was followed by Nanak; the former, on his death-bed, is said to have remarked that he would die in peace because Nanak would take his place. Nanak raised his voice of protest against idolatory, caste-system and communalism. 26 Tell me where did you get two Gods ; who has led you astray ? The same God is called differently Allah or Ram, Karim or FCeshav, Hari or Hazrat. The same God is called Mahadev, Muhammad, Brahma or Adam*. Every one lives on the same earth, one is called Hindu, and the other Turk. The first reads the Vedas, the second the Quran, one is called Pundit, the other is called Maulana. They style themselves separately though they are pots of the same earth. Kabir says, both are mistaken ; none has got Ram (God). Macauliffe : \" He who worshippeth stones, visiteth places Of pilgrimage, dwelleth in forests, And icnounceth the world, wandereth and wandereth, How can his filthy mind become pure?** THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 15 His teachings were so liberal that, after his death, his Musalman disciples claimed his dead body for burial. Nanak's Japajis were more in- fluenced by Hinduism than by the Dohas of Kabir. His Musalman disciples assert that he was initiated into mysticism by a Sufi saint, Say id Hasan. He even visited Mecca on a pilgrimage. In Bagdad, his teachings have been embodied in Arabic and there stood for a long time Nanak's \" Dargah \" in that Islamic centre. Dadu ( 1575 A.D.) 2f> makes a definite attempt to combine the Hindus and Musalmans. Like Kabir, he consciously denounced pilgrimage, idola- try and outward symbols. Amongst his most important disciples were Sheikh Baharji, Bakarji and Rajjabji. Even in the far distant land of Assam, there appeared a new cult called \" Mahapurushia \" founded by Shankardeo. It was more liberal than Vaisnavaism. Himself he was a Kayastha. He counted amongst his disciples a large number of Musalmans. To him \" Temples \" were fraud and \" Prasad \" hypocrisy. Their Gurus are not Brahmins. Sanatan Goswami, a Hindu saint from Gaur, founded a new order called the Darweshia. The Darweshia cult is like that of the Vaisnavas and 26 K. M. Sen says that Dadu was a Muslim and his original name is * Dayood ' which means ' devoted/ 16 THE DIN-I-ILAHI Bauls. They wear beads called \" Tasbih-mala \" and put on the dress of Muslim faqirs called 'Alkalla.' Their songs contain the names of Allah, Khoda, Muhammad and of various saints. The \" Saini \" sect show an extreme form of fusion of Hindu and Muslim faiths. They drink intoxicating liquors and wear beads round the neck, bangles on the wrist and observe the fast of Ekadasi, etc., but like Musalmans they eat beef. They bring their beads, called the ** Khakshafa,\" from Mecca and the chain of beads is called Sulimani beads.' Their secret Mantra is \" Pir sat hai ' (the Guru is truth). They utter every day the following verse : L o^u- ^ - ^J The main feature of these Hindu teachers was a new outlook on religious quest. They sacri- ficed the forms and rituals which had formed the bedrock of the Hindu society since the time of Harsha. In almost all of them, we find a direct and eloquent protest against the ritualistic cult of Hinduism and a faith in the Almighty. The metaphysical aspect of the Hindus was combined with ethical aspect of the Semitics. The rigidity of their dogmas and the stress on their rituals were THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 17 much toned down by the onrush of these teachers, who came almost in a host. The literature of this period is full of Hindu ideas and thoughts. The Hindu poets who appeared in this period adopted the style of the Muslims ; no less were Muslim writers saturated with Hindu thoughts. The Muslims even addressed themselves in Indian languages. Amir Khusrau not only followed the Indian style but he combined it with Sanskrit and Hindi : f S 'l -'^ r \"|o-\"t<i -$ ?)) ^i* Amir Khusrau (13th century) was so liberal that he was sneered at by the orthodox Muslims as a worshipper of idols. He replied to his critics : M^ -uLc 3--I288B 18 THE D1N-I-1LAHI *T ajj4* j-LL \" I am begotten of love, I need no Islam, I have sacred threads all through my veins, there is no need of any other threads. People say Khusrau worships the idols : of course I am doing this and 1 stand not in need of the peoples of the world/' In the poems of Kamal (1565 A.D.), we find the Hindu Prophets and Gods taking a definite place : 1 TO *ft 3RW tJTf Wit, Ram's name has fulfilled all my desires; Lakshman's name has shown me my destination. By Krishna's name, I crossed the sea ; in Vishnu's, name, 1 find the peace of heart.\" With the advent of Malik Muhammad Jaisi (1518 A.D.J Hindu allegory entered into the themes of the Muslim writers of Hindu poetry. The Hindu idea of transmigration of soul, and eternal synthesis of Atma and Paramatma, found expression in the famous allegorical treatises called the Padmavat. Here, under the allegory of the THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 19 struggle between Alauddin and the Rana of Chitor, is excellently depicted from the Hindu standpoint the struggle in a soul between the forces of good and evil. His other Hindi works are no less important. \" Akharabat \" is still regarded as a standard work of Hindi literature. Rajjabji (1538-98) was a great disciple of the saint Dadu and was a follower of the Rama cult. He sang : By his time, quite a number of Muslims had definitely taken to the cult of Rama. Abdur Rahim Khan Khanan, son of Bairam Khan, is one of the best cultural products of the age. His Hindi \" Dohas \" read like the out- pourings of a great Vaishnava saint : \" Oh ! Rahim, if you converted your mind into a beautiful Chakor, which day and night looks at the moon.\" TW it *f WIT* ^t ^Tq- I II \" Oh ! Rahim, if you desire to cross this sea of life, there is no other way but the shelter of Ramachandra.\" 20 THE DIN-I-ILAHI Rahim's love poems are specimens of a won- derful combination of Sanskrit and Hindi : ^ |5ITt II 35TT Kanu played on his flute in the midst of a dense grove, at the dead of a moonlit autumn night, I deserted cupid, son, sleep and my husband and ran away ; Oh God of Love, what a calamity has come upon my head again/' Rahim was a good scholar in Sanskrit and he is responsible for the translation of some astro- logical treatises. Let us quote from one of his Sanskrit poems of dedication : *' Ratnakar is your home; your spouse is Padma (Goddess of Fortune) . [What shall I give to thee, Oh lord of the world? Hence accept this my heart, as your heart is already taken by Radha.\" The eclectic tendency of these Hindu teachers and Muslim litterateurs was very favourable for THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 21 the reception of the Muslim Sufi saints who had been making slow but steady progress towards the heart of Hinduism since their first advent inSind(812 A.D.). The origin, growth and development of Sufism in India is really a very interesting study. The Indian atmosphere, charged with its assimilative cosmic ideal and its Vedantic outlook, was very congenial to the growth of the Sufi ideas, and at the same time Islam, with its absence of metaphysics, its stern rigidity, clear commands and emphatic taboos was favourable to the birth of Sufism. Sufism is after all \" an attitude of mind and heart toward God and problems of life which is as different from strictly orthodox Islam as Quakers are from Catholics.\" In course of time Sufis, by interpreting some verses of the Quran and some sayings of the Prophet, deper- sonalised Allah, the God of Mercy and Wrath, into an abstract idea under the title of Love and Truth. But these abstractions were replied to by terrible persecution as the orthodox refused to admit meta- physics into their citadel of Ethics. It is difficult to conjecture what would have been the trend of Islam a religion almost bankrupt in Metaphysics if it would not have come in touch with Aryan meta- physics in Persia or Greek intellectual abstractions in Yunan. The Aryan idea of receiving instructions through contact with a soul already illumined, permeated with Semitic Islam or, in other words, the doctrine of Pir-Murid (Master and Disciple), 22 THE DIN-I-ILAHI permanently stuck its root into Islam in Persia. Hafiz went so far as to say, \" Drown your pulpit into the wine if your Pir says so, for your guide knows the way and its destination.\" 27 The Sufis believe that the marvellous powers of the illumined soul may be brought to the use and advantage of the disciple. When the Muslims appeared in India through the north-western gates from Persia, they found that the Indian mind was already in conso- nance with Aryan thoughts akin to those in Persia and that a process of fusion had already begun. In Sind, the Muslim Saints Chishti, Bahlol, Latiff, and Shah Baz were making steady progress. In Northern India Kabir, Nanak, Raidas and Chaitanya had already softened the rigidity of Hinduism and the Muslim Saints and Sufis found ready response amongst the people of India. No less were the Muslims influenced by the Hindu Saints. In course of a century, the Sufis adopted the Hindu doctrine of ' ' Guru-Shishya ' ' (Master and Disciple) with all their technique of worship. 27 Indian synonyms for Sufi terms.

THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 23 By the 16th century, Sufi teachers divided them- selves into various orders according to their individual religious experiences ; in India there were as many as seventy- two sects (Bahatar Ferqa). The spirit of the age was very favourable to the development of the Sufi tendencies and orders in Islam . It was a belief amongst many Muslims that, after 1 ,000 years of Muhammad's advent, would appear Al-Mehdi who would \" set disorders at right. 5 ' By the time Akbar was in India, the cycle of 1 ,000 years had just been completed ; volumes of literature had been written in all parts of Islam regarding the appearance of Al- Mehdi. Abdul Qadir Badauni says, in his Munta- khabut-Twarikh, that \"questions of Sufism, scien- tific discussions, enquiries into philosophy and law were the order of the day.\" Many conflicting doc- trines and interpretations were introduced and con- troversy among the religionists and commentators was characterised by bitterest feelings and uncharit- able effusions. In and outside India many a claimant arose who professed themselves as the promised Messiah ; to name a few only in India Mir Sayid Muhammad of Jaunpur, Ruknuddin of Delhi, Sayid * Ahmad of Guzrat, Shaikh Ali of Byana. The forces of this Mehdi movement gave a terrible shake to the orthodox Sunni interpretations of Islam and prepared the way for new doctrines to germinate. The movement was in another way in consonance with the spirit of the time in India. The old stereotyped interpretations would not fit in with 24 THE DlN-l-ILAHI the expanding empire of Islam in the non-Muslim land of India liberal interpretations and adaptations were the needs of the moment ; without the spirit of a Mehdist the orthodox would be far too strong for any Muslim empire-builder in Hindusthan. This move of Islam on a new quest was not an isolated movement nor a sporadic growth. Just then, a wave was passing all over the world both in the East and in the West. It is the nature of the world-thought movements that civilisations of a more or less similar stratum are effected consciously or unconsciously by common currents. In Europe, the intellectual sphere was pulsating with a new wave of scholasticism leading to the Renaissance. The search for the whys and wherefores of every- thing led to the famous system of Inductivism in the field of logic and enquiry ; the quest of the old truth led to the rebirth of the old learning. The whole civilised world was in an intellectual travail. The Islamic world and the Indian mind were also recipients of the same thought-currents. The rise of Ramanand, Ravidas, Kabir, Chaitanya, Dadu, Mirabai and others on the one hand, and of Saber, Abu Ali Kalandar, Nizamuddin Awlia, Bahlol and others on the other, were in part due to the time force. Neo-Sufism and scholastic theology and repu- diation of the orthodox interpretations of the Hadis and the Quran are but the different features of the same movement or their reactions. In India, the scholastics and spiritualists were all \" putting the THE INDIAN BACKGROUND 25 world to flames. \" The mind of young Abul Fazl was not satisfied with the learning he had in India. He intended to move to Laban, Tibet, Bagdad \"in quest of goods \" for his ever -expanding intellect. Badauni compares him to \"a man who, having a light in his hand and not knowing what to do, came out into the street in the day-time.\" Indeed the scholastics, by the light of their intellect, \" made a day of a night and a night of a day.\" Akbar appearing in that age in the midst of the scholastic environments during the process of cultural fusion, was but the natural product of the spirit of the time and not a mere accident. 4 U8UJ5 CHAPTER II THE CENTRAL ASIAN BACKGROUND The birth of Akbar marks the consummation of the process of unification in the two greatest houses of Central Asia, those of Chengiz Khan and Timur-Lang. Akbar combined in him all that was best in the two of the greatest men of Central Asia in the middle ages. Chengiz Khan, apparently known in history as the scourge of God and man, was not altogether devoid of finer elements in his nature. Without entering into a justification or vindication of Chengiz Khan, it may be stated that, in religion, he gives the lie to the popular conception of the great conqueror. In religious belief, Chengiz was a Shaman. 3 \" He 1 \" Shaman \" is possibly a loose form of Buddhist *' Shramana \" which means a monk, though Encyclopedia of Religions, Vol. XI, p 441, suggests that \" Shaman \" is derived from native Tungus name for priest or medicine man Though originally Buddhist, Shamans have deviated so much from the religion of Buddha, that one hardly finds any similarity between the two \" Idols are worshipped in this form of religion but its special feature is the influence of the Shamans (or priests). These persons differ not very greatly from African rain-doctors. They practise astrology to have communication with demons and familiars. Their main power lies in the fact that they pretend to have information from the unseen world as to those who are about to cause misfortune in the future \" (Kennedy, Vol I, p. 14.). The Shaman foietells the future and declares the will of God ; when he awakens (from his trance under the spell of incantation or herbs), he remembers nothing of what has passed. Rythmic songs, prayers and adorations are used by the Shamans in the Kaiwamic. THE CENTRAL ASIAN BACKGROUND 27 believed in God but not in dogma, respected all religions and was often present at all religious ceremonies of his subjects, for, from the state point of view, he found it useful that the people under his authority should give evidence of their faith in God.\" 2 After the conquest of Iran, Chengiz brought some learned men to his court, and asked them for information on the doctrine of Islam. He did not find it inferior to any other religion he knew, hut denounced pilgrimage to Mecca as useless, saying that the whole world is the house of God and that prayers reach him from every- where. 3 Howorth, in his history of the Mughals, says, \"Justice, tolerance, discipline, virtues that make up the modern ideal of a state, were taught and practised at his court/' 1 In keeping with his contemporary usages, Chengiz was absolutely careless of human lives ; \"he had a general belief that all religions had more or less truth and more or less untruth in them.\" 5 \"The body that is born is immortal. It goes hence without home or resting place. \" h This spirit of free-thinking is a common trait in the family of the Mughals of Central Asia, \" they are not fettered by any belief, restrictions of 2 Felix Vayle, Islamic Culture, Hyderabad, Vol. I, 1927, p 17 3 Ibid, p. 18 4 Howorth gives a fine description of the Mughals in their original home. 5 Kennedy, History of the Mughals, Vol. I, p. 13. 6 Howorth, Vol. I, p 104 28 THE DIN-I-ILAH1 dogmas.\" 7 An eclectic spirit pervaded the whole family of Chengiz. \" They took part equally in Christian (of the Nestorian form), Muhammadan and Buddhist services.\" 8 Howorth describes a scene of Mangu Khan's court in which \" Christian services were performed.\" \" On one feast day, Mangu Khan's chief wife and her children entered the Nestorian Chapel, kissed the right hand of the saints, and then gave her right hand to be kissed according to the fashions of the Nestorians. Mangu also was present and with his spouse sat down on the gilt throne before the altar.\" Even Hulaku Khan, who is said to have killed eight hundred thousand men at Bagdad, protected the tomb of Ali at Kerbela. 10 They were liberal enough to employ Christian generals and merce.- naries. Though they carried the message of death and destruction in wha :ever direction they turned their eyes, still \" they carried to and brought from those lands, all the knowledge they could com- mand.\" A spirit of inquiry was a native instinct in them. *' Though not an originative people,\" says H. G Wells, \"yet as transmitters of knowledge and method their influence upon world's history has been enormous.\" 11 Kublei 7 Howorth, Vol. I, p. 202. * Kennedy, Vol. I, p. 27 9 Howorth, Vol I, p. 190 10 Kennedy, Vol. I, p 30. Outlines of the History of the World by H. G. Wells, gives a fine description of the Mongol culture. THE CENTRAL ASIAN BACKGROUND 29 Khan, grandson of Chengiz, sent to the Pope, in 1 269, a mission with evident intentions of finding some common mode of action with the Western kingdom. He asked that one hundred men of learning and ability should be sent to his court to establish an understanding. Here was an opportunity for the Popes to fulfil their ambition of converting the great Mughals to their faith for which attempts had been previously made. But when Kublei asked for some men of knowledge, they failed to utilise the opportunity, for papacy was then at its worst and struggling for existence. The two friars sent were unequal to the task. The attempts made by the Nestorians and Catholics proved abortive. Inspired by the great Chinese sage, Chu-Tsi, Kublei Khan, the Mongol, accepted a Chinese name, for he was an Emperor of China. He gave a wonderful tone to the Shamanic cult. \"He began to respect the religion and culture of the conquered and did not believe in the cultural superiority of the victors. He was kind to the learned, to the artists and poets, and gave them shelter, irrespective of their religion and tradition. He completely identified himself with the interest of his subjects. The efforts of Kublei to revive Chinese agriculture, his great struggle against famine, his financial laws he ordered the printing of bank-notes and his works of charity deserve admiration of all generations. The Chinese historians recognise that this 30 THE DIN-MLAHI descendant of the greatest swordsman was their greatest ruler. \" JL> If Kublei was great as a ruler of Chinese soil, he was greater still as a ruler of Chinese soul. To decide what was the best among the religions of the people, he called a council of the wise men of all belief s. 1;5 Thus came the Muslim divines, Buddhist Shamans, Christian theologians to the Imperial Court and we possess a very fascinating record of their discus- sions in the writings of Rubrukis, the ambassador of Saint Louis, King of France. 11 The Christian Gospels were asked to be translated. Mati-Dhwaja, the great Lama, was at his court and was afterwards honoured with the seat of the Tibetan Dalai Lama. A great Lama, named Shakya Pandit lj from Tibet (probably of Indian origin), went over to his court, and is said to have delivered three lectures on Buddhism ; he ultimately convinced Kublei of the greatness of the teachings of Buddha and was accepted as the ' Phagspa ' (or preceptor).

Beginning from Asok, we find, \" Religious conferences follow one upon the other at the court of the Asiatic rulers in search of a means of reconciling the different doctrines.'* Felix Vayle. 14 Guillamme Baucher, a Persian, and Eaquette de-Melz, a French lady, are also mentioned in this connection 15 Sanskrit *' Shiksh,\" Chinese Po-se-pa, Bhaspa and Phagspa; Acharya, meaning \" preceptor.\" THE CENTRAL ASIAN BACKGROUND 31 the script of the Chinese, Mongols and Zoroas- trians. 10 This spirit of enquiry, a tendency to free-thinking and absence of a steady religious background are mainly responsible for the changes of beliefs in the Mughal tribes in different parts of Asia. The Mughals in China adopted Buddhism ; in South Russia and Western Turki- stan, they embraced Islam ; in Kipchak, though Muslim by profession, they still retain most of their earlier traces . of Shamanism. The Mughals of Ukraine reverted to Christianity, forming the Cossacks nomad half-civilised tribes in Russia and Poland The pliability of the Mughals to some extent continued even when they reached India after two hundred years of their stay in Islamic environments. If they had not embraced Islam before they came to India, they might as well have accepted the religion of India with all its merits and demerits. The same spirit characterises the paternal line of Akbar. The early Turks who accepted Islam, made it a condition precedent that, even when Muslims, they would not part with wine and would not kill cows ] ' \\ By no means was their pro-* fession of Islam orthodox.\\ Timur-Lang was so wonderful a personality that a thousand and one fascinating fables grew around him and he is For a discussion on this srript, see the aiticle on the alphabet of Phagspa in Asia'Major - Kennedy, Vol I, p 34. 17 Sachau's Introduction to Alberuni. 32 THE DIN-1-ILAHI depicted in most diverse lights according to the temperament of the authors. He is claimed as an orthodox Sunni, and no less a Shia ; some credit him to be a Gazi ; others shun him as a Schismatic ; he is hated in Europe as a scourge of God and men. He is cursed by others as a pagan too. And there is more or less truth in every one of the epithets applied to him. His conquest extended from the Mediterranean to the Ganges and from Pekin to Moscow. His history has been written by the vanquished, and certainly the spirit of venom, which the vanquished bore against the victor, has entered into their writings. 1R The Sunni Musalmans, whom he practically destroyed in Bagdad and Allepo, never accepted him as an orthodox Musalman and he was looked down upon by the Khalifas and Ulama as a pagan. He did not feel much rever- ence for Mecca. Even after the conquest of the Khelafat, Say ids refused to regard him as a monarch of Islam. in In his communications, he never styled himself a monarch of Islam, which isr invariably the custom with orthodox Muham- madans. He styled himself, \"I, Timur, a servant of God/' He never changed his hereditary name * 8 Harold Lamb, \" Tamerlane the Earth Shaker,*' a well-known work on Timur. Zafarnama, written by Sarafuddin Ali, under the patro- nage of the Timurids, is full of flattery.

He did not even hesitate to assume the title of Khalifat -ul-lillah to pose as the greatest com- mander of the faithful, vindicating the superiority of Timurid arms to those of Abbassids. He gladly employed Christians as his envoys to different contemporary courts. The claim of his panegyrists that he was an orthodox Sunni Musalman is not tenable. The circumstances which drew his profession of the Sunni creed, were p"
