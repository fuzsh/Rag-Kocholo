        "text": "We’re exploring a more WYSIWYG editor in the composer, while keeping compatibility with Discourse features and post markup.\n\nEarly experiments led by @renato are very promising, but since composer is such large and important part of Discourse we are not rushing nor making any promises around details of the implementation.\n\n@Falco summed the general idea up nicely. We want to create a composer that feels more familiar, intuitive, and accessible to new users by aligning more with the various writing experiences out there today, such as a single-pane composer where formatting is applied in real time. It’s still early days though in our design and planning process.\n\nFeel free to share any and all feedback about the current experience and problems you’d like to see us solve here!\n\nHere is a small collection of difficulties in our community:\n\nPasting Lists\n\nPart of the content into our discourse is written in word / other office and then pasted into discourse.\n\nBullets are not converted to - or + disabling lists.\n\nPasting Cursive Fonts\n\nFor pasted referenced email content, every line gets quoted in asterisks.\n\nIf such texts are detected, embracing with a tag (<em> or similar) would be more appropriate.\n\nNew Users Do Not Understand Using Hashes for Headlines\n\nNew users do not understand using hashes for headlines.\n\nThey keep using the available buttons and use bold text instead.\n\nAn Icon to add headlines could help here.\n\nIn addition, some heuristic could trigger educational texts.\n\nOrientation in a Collection of Images\n\nWhen working with a bunch of images, the preview and cursor position are not synced. To identify uploads, the image caption has to be edited.\n\nPossible improvements:\n\nauto increment the image description\n\nadd visual clue about cursor position into the preview and sync this into view"
