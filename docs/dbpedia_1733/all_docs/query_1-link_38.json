        "text": "photo by Ryan Kalka\n\nCAPTION: Senior quarterback James Valdez exploits a crease in the Taft defense, amassing 44 all purpose yards on the way to the end zone for the only Husky touchdown of the game to start the second half.\n\nThe varsity football team managed to score only seven points this past Thursday against William Taft High School at Gus stadium. The Huskies playoff chances are gone, but after a 41-7 loss, but with one game to go, they still have a chance at tying the best record since 2001.\n\nThis time around, the Huskies defense did exceptionally well in the first half as they held Taft to only two scores. That’s exactly what they needed to turn the game in their favor, the only problem was the Husky offense was never able to get anything going. The passing game was impotent and the rushing game was effective at first, until Taft began predicting the plays and stopping them. The score was 14-0 heading into halftime.\n\n“We needed to wake up and focus in order to get back in the game heading into the second half,” Senior offensive linemen Willie Garza said.\n\nThe start of the second half was strong for the Husky offense as they marched down the field to make the score 7-14. The score came from a one yard rushing touchdown from senior quarterback James Valdez, who was a key factor leading to the score, earning 44 all-purpose yards during the long drive.\n\nIt seemed as if the score could have shifted momentum in the Husky’s favor, but Taft thought otherwise, as they quickly responded with a rushing touchdown of their own. From that moment on, the Huskies lost all momentum on both sides of the ball. Offense failed to convert on third and fourth down, and the defense allowed 20 points in the fourth quarter.\n\n“We worked hard from the beginning to the end. The effort was there. We just couldn’t execute the way we wanted to,” senior defensive linemen Mason Meffert said.\n\nphoto by Ryan Kalka\n\nCAPTION: The Husky student section stays in the game no matter the score, rooting for the Huskies in the second half despite an impending loss.\n\nDespite not making the playoffs, the Huskies still have chance to do something that hasn’t been done in years, finishing the season with a winning record of 5-5. The last year the Huskies had a winning or non-losing season was in 2001 where they finished 5-5. The Huskies are currently 4-5 as they compete against the John Jay Mustangs this Saturday at Gus Stadium at 7:00pm. Be sure to support our fellow Huskies as they finish off the last game of the season. Husky fight never dies."
