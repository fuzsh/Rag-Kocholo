Hepper] Productivity from the Rhizosphere Soil of DibruSaikhowa Biosphere Reserve (DSBR) Forest of Assam, India\n\nBy: Soneswar Sarma , Apurba Saikia , Kumud Das\n\nPage No : 1-15\n\nAbstract\n\nAn experiment was conducted with efficient Rhizobial isolates from the rhizosphere soil of Dibru-Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve (DSBR) forest of Assam, India in both laboratory and field condition with black gram. The purification, authentication, characterization and screening of efficient isolates viz. MDB1 (Microbial Diversity Bacteria), MDB9 , MDB11, MDB12 and MDB15 have been done in vitro experiment in Gibson’s tube and Leonard jars. Lone inoculation of these five isolates in black gram with prominent parameters like dry weight (g, plant-1) of shoot and root, chlorophyll content (mg, g-1fresh wt.), N & P content (g/plant) and yield (kg, ha-1) were recorded in field condition. Dry weight of nodule (51 g, plant-1), shoot (7.80 g, plant-1) and root (3.55 g, plant-1) was observed high in MDB11 inoculation while low (nodule= 34, shoot= 5.60 and root= 2.30 g, plant-1) in MDB15. The N & P content showed high (3.15 & 1.86 mg/plant in shoot and 1.69 & 1.06 mg/plant in root) in MDB11 inoculation comparison to others. Subsequently, the highest productivity (460.48 kg, ha-1) of the test crop observed in due application of MDB11 while lowest (365.32 kg, ha-1) in MDB15. In this piece of research work, we used all the above-mentioned Rhizobium isolates as PGPR (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria) which were isolated from Dibru-Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve Forest of Assam.\n\nThis study thus underlines the potentials of the rhizobial isolates correspondence to the growth and development of black gram and submits this piece of work in original form for greater benefit of mankind in future.\n\nAuthors :\n\nKumud Das : Department of Botany, Nowgong College (Autonomous), Nagaon, Assam, India.\n\nApurba Saikia : P.G.

Currently, research in nanotechnology focuses on the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis. Green synthesis of nanoparticles is an economic and non-toxic alternative to conventional methods. In the present study, aqueous bark extract of Ailanthus excelsa Roxb. was used for the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). UV-Visible Spectroscopy confirmed the presence of AgNPs with an absorption Surface Plasmon peak at 450nm. Biosynthesized AgNPs and bark extract were investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for determining the functional groups in phytochemicals that act as reducing and capping agents in the synthesis process. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) analysis denotes that AgNPs were predominantly spherical, with an average size of 18.84 ± 2.28nm. The bark extract was evaluated qualitatively by preliminary phytochemical screening. Antioxidant potential of biosynthesized AgNPs and bark extract were analyzed using the DPPH method in which biosynthesized AgNPs showed significant free radical scavenging potential. Antibacterial properties of biosynthesized AgNPs were analysed against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Biosynthesized AgNPs and bark extract were also checked for Germination Percentage, Germination Speed Index and Seedling Vigor Index on Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Moong (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek) seeds. The present study infers that Ailanthus excelsa Roxb. act as a potential source of green synthesis of AgNPs and may help to build a resilient system for its commercial applications in various fields.\n\nAuthors :\n\nSumita Nair and Neeraja Tutakne\n\nDepartment of Botany, SIES College of Arts, Science and Commerce (Autonomous), Sion (W), Mumbai, India.\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.01.2\n\nPrice: 251\n\nAnthocyanins as Natural Plant-derived Antifungal Agents\n\nBy: Momin Naziya , Shaikh Asfiya , Ansari Shahana , Nirmalkar Vaishali\n\nPage No : 29-38\n\nAbstract\n\nAnthocyanins are polyphenolic compounds found as natural pigments in various parts of plants that share the same diphenyl propane skeleton (C6 C3 C6 ) and are collectively known as flavonoids. They are water-soluble pigments responsible for the blue, purple, and red color of various plant parts and are particularly abundant in fruits, flowers, and vegetables. These pigments are natural colorants that are low to non-toxic. They also show antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, and food preservative properties. This study aims to perform in vitro analysis of the antifungal activity of anthocyanins extracted from different plant materials. Anthocyanins were extracted in acetone and acidified methanol. For qualitative determination of anthocyanins, thin layer chromatography was used whereas for quantitative determination pH differential method was used. The antifungal potential of anthocyanins was determined using the MIC and agar well diffusion methods against Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. Acetone extract exhibited higher antifungal potential compared to acidified methanol extract against both fungal strains. It is suggested that anthocyanins, being strong antifungal agents, can be used to prevent fungal spoilage and deterioration of processed foods.\n\nAuthors :\n\nNirmalkar Vaishali, Ansari Shahana, Shaikh Asfiya and Momin Naziya\n\nK.M.E Society’s G.

Borail Reserve Forest of Dima Hasao district, Assam is endowed with typical Sub tropical monsoon climate which provide adequate habitat for the growth and development of various types of vegetation as well as diverse species of macrofungi. The study attempts to assess the macrofungal diversity in certain areas of Borail Reserve Forest as it is yet to explore. The investigation was conducted in the year 2021 (June-December). Sampling was done using quadrat method each measuring 100×100m2 . During the survey, a total of 21 species belonging to 15 families were encountered and identified up to species level i.e. Auriculariaceae, Clavulinaceae, Psathyrellaceae, Fomitopsidaceae, Ganodermataceae, Agaricaceae, Lyophyllaceae, Marasmiaceae, Polyporaceae, Phallaceae, Pluteaceae, Schizophyllaceae, Stereaceae, Tremellaceae and Xylariaceae. It is found that 20 species belong to basidiomycota group and only 1 species belongs to ascomycota group. However, Marasmiaceae and Polyporaceae family are found to be the most dominant family of macrofungi in the region. The inference of the study revealed the diverse treasure of macrofungi of Borail Reserve Forest. The record of macrofungi of the study gives the baseline information for the biological diversity. The significance of macrofungi is not only to balance the ecosystem dynamics but also in human diet and beneficial impact to health, which increases the need for the conservation of this valuable resource.\n\nAuthors :\n\nMairingdi Jarambusa : Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Botany, University of Science and Technology, Meghalaya, India.\n\nPradip Kumar Baruah : Professor, Department of Botany, University of Science and Technology, Meghalaya, India.\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.01.4\n\nPrice: 251\n\nIsolation and Biochemical Characterization of Endophytic Bacteria Associated with Roots of Salvadora oleoides\n\nBy: Neetu Poonar , Sangeeta Kumari , Anita Yadav , Shweta Sharma , Neelam Poonar , Ritu Kumari\n\nPage No : 49-56\n\nAbstract\n\nThe reduction of plant diseases by the use of plant associated microbes is being increased nowadays.

Every year, there has been an increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. One of the least expensive ways to minimize this gap is by biological carbon sequestration in plants. Ecosystems of forests are the most significant carbon sinks among terrestrial ecosystems and have long-term sustainable impacts on limiting climate change. Sacred groves are known as the small patches of conserved forests protected by man’s spiritual beliefs and cultural practices. These sacred forest patches were studied from the ecological, environmental and floristic point of view by several research workers. Due to their religious and mythological myths and beliefs, sacred groves and sacred plants are conserved well. Apart from being conserved, these sacred plants can also have a higher potential for carbon sequestration. The total biomass and carbon sequestrated in the Sacred tree species have been estimated using a non-destructive method. The main focus of the current article is on estimating the carbon sequestration of sacred tree species in sacred groves found in selected areas Abdasa Taluka of Kachchh District. Total 51 sacred groves were recorded from 33 villages which cover approximately 23.64 hectares of land area. Carbon sequestration of 537 individuals of 23 tree species was estimated through the standard method. Ficus benghalensis L. is dominated in carbon i.e., 7.36 tones followed by Tamarindus indica L. (5.77 tones), Ficus religiosa L. (5.22 tones), Delonix regia (Boj.) Raf (3.02 tonnes). Lowest carbon sequestration was recorded in Prosopsis cineraria (L.) Druce, Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Delile, Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Butea monosperma (Lam.) Taub and Punica granetum L. less than 1 tonnes respectively.\n\nAuthors :\n\nAlpesh Malsatar : Research Scholar, Department of Earth and Environmental Science, KSKV Kachchh University, Bhuj, Gujarat, India.\n\nPK Mehta : Assistant Professor, Government Science College, Mandvi, Gujarat, India.\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.01.6\n\nPrice: 251\n\nTerrestrial Orchid Diversity in Sagara Taluk of Shimogga District Central Western Ghats Region of Karnataka\n\nBy: K Krishnaswamy , Soumya Mahabaleshwar Hegde\n\nPage No : 67-74\n\nAbstract\n\nThe current article evaluates the study of terrestrial orchids in Sagara taluk of Shimogga district, reports total 26 terrestrial orchid species in Sagara taluk region Shimogga district Karnataka from the period of January 2019-January 2022 and provides information on their distribution, phenology aspects and biological status in the district.

The attributes of the plant population in protected areas like Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary (NWLS), Nongkhyllem Forest (NRF), and District Council governed Eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) were studied using Important Value Index (IVI), Shannon’s and Weiner Diversity Index and Sorenson’s similarity index. Shorea robusta C.F.Gaertn., Tectona grandis Linn. L.f., Schima wallichii (D.C.) Korth, had the highest IVI value of 64, 56, 42, etc. respectively, while the diversity index showed maximum values of 0.78 in recorded forest area and minimum of 0.60 under district council area. Similarity index ranged between 16.67 % and 39.22 %. The species richness and diversity in the recorded forest area was higher compared to the forest under the district council. In addition, tree girth and density of other species were determined. The study revealed that the cultivation of betel nut (Areca catechu L.), betel leaf (Piper betle L.), broom (Thysanolaena maxima Kuntze) and banana (Musa spp.) though for livelihood and income generation contributed to vegetation alteration in the district council forest area. Strict enforcement of ESZ laws & creating alternative livelihood opportunities can help minimize biodiversity loss.\n\nAuthors :\n\nThoudam James Singh and Subhasish Das Gupta\n\nDepartment of Environment & Traditional Ecosystems, Martin Luther Christian University, Shillong, Meghalaya, India.\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.01.8\n\nPrice: 251\n\nCurculigo Species: A Wide Spectrum Research Review\n\nBy: Vinita Srivastava , Pratibha Chaturvedi\n\nPage No : 83-93\n\nAbstract\n\nTropical regions of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas are rich with Curculigo species belongs to family Hypoxidaceae.

Kharbuli , Gunjana Chaudhury , Khrote-u Lasushe , Aabid Hussain Mir , Hiranjit Choudhury , Rajib Borah\n\nPage No : 163-175\n\nAbstract\n\nThe present study was carried out to investigate the orchid diversity in community managed subtropical broad-leaved forests in Khasi Hills of Meghalaya. A total of 87 community forests were surveyed in Khasi Hills. The study revealed the presence of 123 species belonging to 54 genera. The highest numbers of species (66) were recorded in sacred forests, followed by reserved (51) and village (32) forests. Majority of the recorded species (87) were epiphytic and 36 were terrestrial. Of all the species, 28 (22.76%) were recorded as endemic and 12 (9.76%) were rare. Dendrobium with 19 species was the dominant genera followed by Coelogyne with 11 species. Owing to a number of anthropogenic disturbances followed by habitat loss, these species are subjected to continuous threat, hence warrants immediate conservation actions. Therefore, it is suggested that mass propagation, through conventional and tissue culture techniques should be adopted to conserve the dwindling orchid diversity of the state.\n\nAuthors :\n\nAabid Hussain Mir, Khrote-u Lasushe and Gunjana Chaudhury\n\nDepartment of Environmental Studies, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong, Meghalaya, India.\n\nRajib Borah, Nellie V.

H.Patel , Nidhi Parmar\n\nPage No : 249-256\n\nAbstract\n\nCitrus fruits are most commonly consumed fruits. However, the peels of these fruits yield a huge waste. The peels also contain important phytoconstituents. This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant properties of peels of two selected citrus fruits (sweet lime and lemon). The peels were extracted using four solvents namely methanol, ethanol, acetone and distilled water. The extracts were analysed for total phenolic content, flavonoid content, DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The result revealed that highest antioxidant profile was found for methanol extract of both sweet lime peel and lemon peel as compared to other extracts. The extracts of peels of sweet lime possessed higher total phenol, flavonoid and FRAP. The antioxidant capacity in terms of DPPH RSA and FRAP were attributed mainly to total phenolics as compared to flavonoids for both the peels. The higher antioxidant potential of peels of selected citrus fruits make them key ingredient for the development of functional foods and other supplementary products.\n\nAuthors :\n\nNidhi Parmar, V.

Rajani , A. Kavitha\n\nPage No : 31-38\n\nAbstract\n\nThe epiphytic orchid species known as Cymbidium mastersii can only be found in the region of India known as Northeast India. The preservation of wild populations faces a significant obstacle in the form of a significant threat when it comes to the necessity of obtaining an additional source of the material required to fulfil commercial demands. The objective of this research was to build an in vitro system for the bulk multiplication of C. mastersii, and it was successful in that endeavour. This required the capacity to control the growth of the seedlings through the development of the primary protocorm and germination from a limited number of fruit capsules. Also necessary was the ability to limit the amount of fruit capsules that could be used. Each protocorm resulted in the production of a number of robust plantlings that, once they had been separated from their mother plant, flourished in the conditions of the greenhouse. The child plants, in terms of both their size and the development they underwent, were genetically identical to their parent plant. The streamlined process will make it possible to cultivate Cymbidium mastersii for use in the commercial sector, which will reduce the negative influence on remaining viable wild populations. We offer here for the very first time a method of producing C. mastersii on a commercial scale that makes use of bioreactor technology.\n\nAuthors :\n\nA. Kavitha and A.

Ba influenced the seedling growth of wheat and mung bean in similar fashion. Ba enhanced the germination relative index at lower concentration (upto 10 μg ml-1). The relative yield of biomass increased at lower doses of Ba and decreased at higher concentration (>100 μg ml-1). Lower applied doses of Ba showed a maximum index of tolerance while higher applied doses of metal showed a toxic effect on plant growth.

According to the traditional knowledge, the roots of the plant would be highly effective for wound healing. The plant-based secondary metabolites remain an essential aspect in developing novel drug candidates. The early screening of bioactive compounds for a therapeutic property would be strongly evidenced to carry out the in vitro and in vivo studies. The current study focuses on screening bioactive compounds involved in wound healing using in silico molecular docking studies. The LCMS analysis of H. auriculata yielded about 15 compounds in positive and negative modes with the greatest medicinal properties. The drug-likeness, physicochemical properties, and bioactivity scores were evaluated for 15 compounds using SWISS ADME online tool. The compounds that indicate drug like properties and adhere to the permissible parameters are epiafzelechin, betulin, caffeic acid 3-glucoside, quercetin, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, chlorogenic acid, myristic acid, and 5, P coumaroyl quinic acid implying to be a cell-permeable and orally active drug. The bioactivity scores indicated that the compounds to be highly active. The binding affinities were checked with the wound pathogenic proteins such as Elastase, Glycogen synthase kinase-3β, gelatinase, and collagenase. The compounds that fall within the drug-likeness limit were further evaluated for ADMET properties and predicted that majority compounds are nontoxic and easily absorbed. The docking score ranged from -1.56 kcal/mol to -9.65 kcal/mol which exhibited the strongest binding affinity. The effective binding of compounds like epiafzelechin, betulin, kaempferol-7-O-Glucoside, linoleic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin with these proteins provides evidence for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanism that promotes wound healing of Hygrophila auriculata root.\n\nAuthors :\n\nDeepika E and Santhy KS : Department of Zoology, School of Biosciences, Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.02.7\n\nPrice: 251\n\nBiochemical Changes due to Pathogenesis in French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)

French bean has evolved from wild growing vine distributed in the high lands of Middle America and Andes. This important legume crop is grown for its dry grain and tender pods in North-Western India. This offseason crop can be successfully raised under Punjab conditions during winter season which fetches higher price in the market and economical to the farmers when there is no availability of green pods from high altitude. It is widely cultivated in tropics, sub-tropics and temperate regions. When bean plant infected by fungal, bacterial or any other pathogen, different alternations are observed. The present study was carried out in the department of Botany, Darrang college to compare the biochemical changes occurring in bean plants growing in normal soil, and sterilized soil mixed with fungus Rhizoctonia solani.\n\nAuthors :\n\nNikita Deka, Rajashree Bordoloi and Dipanjali Devi : PG Department of Botany, Darrang College, Tezpur, Assam, India\n\nPhatik Tamuli : Lanka Mahavidyalaya, Hojai, Assam, India.\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.02.8\n\nPrice: 251\n\nHepatoprotective Plants used in Ayurveda System- A Review\n\nBy: Niranjan M.H , Jyothi S.T\n\nPage No : 83-91\n\nAbstract\n\nLiver is an essential organ of our body. Bile secretion, detoxification, metabolism of fat and carbohydrates, storage of proteins, vitamins, iron and glycogen are the vital functions of the liver. Liver involves the biochemical pathways like supply of nutrients, growth, reproduction and production of energy. Liver injury is caused by certain antibiotics, carbontetrachloride, chemotherapeutic agents, thioacetamide, chronic alcohol consumption, antitubercular drugs, autoimmune diseases and microbes. Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive agents are used as drugs but they have adverse effects. Though these are developments in allopathy, there is no effective medicine that enhances hepatic function and protects liver. In Ayurveda system, plant materials have been used to protect liver injuries. Herbal medicines have gained popularity because they are easily available, safe, efficient and cost effective. The current research work laid down avenues to the production of novel herbal medicines for jaundice and reports the work on Ayurveda plants that have been proved and tested in hepatotoxicity.\n\nAuthors :\n\nJyothi S.T : Research Scholar,Department of Studies in Biotechnology, Shivagangotri, Davangere University, Davangere\n\nNiranjan M.H : Associate Professor, Department of Studies in Biotechnology, Shivagangotri, Davangere University, Davangere.\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.02.9\n\nPrice: 251\n\nEffect of Various Solvents Extraction on the Antioxidant and Aldose Reductase Inhibition Activities of the Tamarind Leaves (Tamarindus indica L.)\n\nBy: Khushbu Dalwadi , V.

Despite high economic value and consumption, the nutritional values of banana pseudostems have not been studied. The present study evaluated the nutritional values and antioxidant activity of four highly consumed banana pseudostems [MN13 (Meitei Hei), MN14 (Maring Hei), MN15 (Ningol Hei) and MN20 (Ching Laphu)] found in different parts of Manipur. Two of the cultivated banana pseudostems (MN13 and MN15) were identified as Musa acuminata, MN14 as Musa hybrid cultivar and MN20 as Musa balbisiana of the family Musaceae. The total sugar (0.99 %), reducing sugar (0.57 %), starch (39.22%) and amino acid (23.94 μg/mg) contents were recorded highest in MN14. Non-reducing sugar (0.57 %), crude protein (12.84 %), ash content (30.63%), total phenolic content (23.31 ug GAE/mg) and flavonoid (15μg RE/mg) were found highest in MN20. Among minerals, the highest values of N content was recorded in MN20 (2.05%), P in MN13 (400.78 mg/100g), K in MN14 (42.88 mg/100g) and Na (1.14 mg/100g) in MN15. The antioxidant properties of the pseudostems were found to be very low in all samples as compared to cow pea (31.56%), ascorbic acid (65.86%) and gallic acid (69.2%). The present study reveals that the two banana pseudostems, MN14 (Musa hybrid cultivar) and MN20 (Musa balbisiana) were found to possess the highest nutritional contents based on mineral and dietary values. Further, studies may lead to the development of a suitable management strategy for conservation and sustainable utilization of MN20 as an important vegetable in the future.\n\nAuthors :\n\nThokchom Sonia Devi and Padmaraj Gajurel : Department of Forestry, North Eastern Regional Institute of Science & Technology, Nirjuli, Arunachal Pradesh, India.\n\nSorokhaibam Sureshkumar Singh : Department of Botany, School of Life Sciences, Manipur University, Canchipur, Imphal, Manipur, India\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.02.21\n\nPrice: 251\n\nAn Overview on Ethnomedicinal Uses of Aloe vera Plant\n\nBy: Binod Kumar Mohapatra , Gyanranjan Mahalik , Swagat Kumar Mallick , Ushashee Mandal\n\nPage No : 213-217\n\nAbstract\n\nPlants are utilized as nutrition, medicine, livestock farming, and construction material.

Ex. Schult\n\nBy: Nagaveni C , Rajanna. L.\n\nPage No : 229-234\n\nAbstract\n\nAerva lanata (L.) Juss. ex-Schultz, is a medicinally important herbal plant with many medicinal properties like the antihyperglycaemic, lithotriptic, urolithic, antibiotic, antihelmintic, antihyperlipidemic, antimicrobial and hepatoprotective activity that intrigued us to study and propagate this plant. As the plant displayed challenges in propagation by conventional methods, especially during the off-season, the in vitro multiplication method was deployed. During this experimentation, in vitro flowering for two consecutive years both during the on-season and off-season was recorded. L2 media fortified with 2.5 mg/L IBA, and 1.5 mg/L BAP emerged as the best media for proliferation and direct organogenesis. Resultant shoots were subcultured onto similar media fortified with 1 mg/L GA3 to get elongated inflorescences. As flowers and inflorescences are of great medicinal importance, these results aid in sustaining the plant during the off-season and find its application accordingly.\n\nAuthors :\n\nNagaveni C and Rajanna.

R.K. Jansen\n\nBy: K. Priyadharshni , P. Shanthi\n\nPage No : 235-243\n\nAbstract\n\nThe phytocompound 5,7,3’,4’–Flavon-3-ol isolated and characterized through spectral studies was analyzed for its anticariogenic activity through disc diffusion method and In-silico analysis. It was carried against dental caries causing microbes such as Streptococcus mutans at different concentration (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160 μg/ml) of which the maximum zone of inhibition was noticed at 160 μg/ml. In in-silico analysis, the molecular docking of phytocompound was analyzed against 4 proteins of the pathogen which were retrieved from PDB database. The phytocompound 5,7,3’,4’ – Flavon-3-ol showed good response against all proteins. Among these, the highest ligand and protein interaction was noticed in 3AIE protein of Streptococcus mutans. The flavonoid compound was tested for its drug likeness and ADME/T properties. The results revealed that the compound accepted the three rule out of four in Lipinski rule of five. ADME properties and toxicity of the phytocompound showed oral bioavailability which are under permissible limit. From the present investigation, it was proved that the phytocompound 5,7,3’,4’–Flavon-3-ol is harmless and effect potent against dental caries causing microbes.\n\nAuthors :\n\nK.

Millisp.)\n\nBy: Asha Rani\n\nPage No : 1-7\n\nAbstract\n\nTo find the viable morphological mutations in mung bean seeds of two varieties of green gram (Vigna radiata) i.e. Narendra mung-1 (NM-1) and Pantnagar mung-2 (PTM-2) were obtained from Pantnagar seed department, Pantnagar University, Pantnagar. These mutations occur due to the toxic effects of heavy metals which were present in city waste water. This effluent was collected from the B.D.A. colony nalah situated near Gulabrai Inter college of Bareilly city. The concentrations of the heavy metals such as copper, zinc and lead were found 7.500 mg/l, 7.270 mg/l and 3.740 mg/l respectively in city waste water. Different concentrations (80%, 90% and 100%) of the effluent were prepared to treat the mung bean seeds.\n\nIn first (M1) generation the phytotoxic effects of effluent on different growth parameters were observed. The seeds of M1 plants were collected and sown on plant to row progeny basis to raise second or M2 generation. Different type of viable morphological mutations were recorded in second (M2) generation. A wide range of viable mutants on seedling length, appearance, leaf number, shape and size, maturity pattern , yield were isolated in the M2 generation. Synchronous, early maturing and high yielding mutants are agronomically desirable which may be utilized in future breeding programme. Spectrum and frequency of these viable mutants were calculated. It has been observed that frequency of viable mutation increased with increasing concentrations of heavy metals. The heavy metal treatment showed increase in induction of viable mutation frequency and it reached to 3.255 in 100% ZnSO4 in PTM-2.\n\nAuthor :\n\nAsha Rani : Ph.

In this study, a comparative in silico pipeline has been used for the identification and functional annotation of 10HPs of O. sativa obtained from NCBI database. The structure, function, subcellular localization and interacting partners of the proteins were analysed along with orthology prediction to the hypothetical proteins of the data set. 90% successful annotation was done where most of the annotated HPs have functionally significant domains and protein superfamilies. Majority of the proteins were predicted to be Enzymes. Subcellular localization is a vital step for effective protein identification as subcellular localization of HPs elucidates their cellular mechanism. Most of the proteins were localized within the nucleus followed by cytoplasm, chloroplast, mitochondria, plasma membrane, extracellular matrix. No signal peptide was predicted. Mainly, the proteins had their closest orthologous members belonging to other species of Oryza. Functional analysis has revealed the role of few HPs in both biotic and abiotic stress management in the plants. The consequence of this research may be beneficial for outlining general set pipeline or etiquettes for an improved perception of the function of HPs in physiological development of several plant system. The understanding of the structure and function of these important proteins and their binding sites would be beneficial in understanding their role in metabolic pathway and in docking studies for aiding in the drug discovery.\n\nAuthors :\n\nArpita Banerjee, Monali Bhattacharjee, Debapriya Das, Renia Mullick and Debleena Roy : PG Department of Botany, Lady Brabourne College, Kolkata, India\n\nSujata Dhar (Dutta) : Department of Zoology, Lady Brabourne College, Kolkata, India\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.03.2\n\nPrice: 251\n\nProline Metabolism in Two High Yielding Groundnut Cultivars that Differ in their Drought Tolerance\n\nBy: C. Sudhakar , K.V. Madhusudhan\n\nPage No : 21-29\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this study, we compared the effects of drought stress on proline metabolism, glycine betaine and lipid peroxidation in two groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivars, K-6 and JL-24, that are droughttolerant and drought-susceptible, respectively. As RWC decreased over time, leaf dry weight values also decreased across all stress regimes and cultivars. In the leaves of both cultivars, pyrroline-5- carboxylate reductase (P5CR) was upregulated in response to water stress, while proline oxidase (POX) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) were downregulated. These results imply that the induction of proline levels during groundnut development is associated with the elevation of proline synthesis enzyme (P5CR) and the downregulation of proline degrading enzymes (POX and P5CDH) that contribute to the plant’s decreased sensitivity to drought. Proline levels are greater in cultivar K-6 than in cultivar JL-24, which may be attributed to increased P5CR rates and less inhibition of POX and P5CDH. At all stress levels, the groundnut cv. K-6 accumulated more glycine betaine than the cv. JL-24. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an indicator of lipid peroxidation, and in cultivar JL-24 it was found in significantly higher concentrations than in cultivar K-6. Dry mass buildup and physio-biochemical responses differed across cultivars and were based on the intensity of the stress. Tolerance levels of these two cultivars were compared.\n\nAuthors :\n\nK.V.

Compound-1 was added to starch solutions at different concentrations (0, 20, 30, and 40% v/v) and transformed into nanofibers through electrospinning. The resulting electrospun fibers were analyzed for their morphology, size distribution, thermal stability, FT-IR spectra and wound healing potential. The nanofibers loaded with compound-1 exhibited a uniform morphology and had average diameters ranging from 76 to 98 nm. Moreover, the compound-1 encapsulated within the nanofibers demonstrated higher thermal stability compared to the free compound-1. FT-IR analysis revealed interactions between the starch and compound-1. Notably, the nanofibers loaded with 40% compound-1 exhibited significantly enhanced viability in HaCat cells. Western blot analysis showed increased expression levels of VEGF and PDGF proteins, suggesting that the developed nanofibers could promote angiogenesis and cell proliferation, thereby potentially accelerating the wound healing process. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the developed starch-based electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds, incorporating compound-1 from Mollugo nudicaulis, possess potent wound healing properties by activating the VEGF and PDGF signaling pathways. Nevertheless, further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to validate these findings.\n\nAuthors :\n\nMani Panagal and Siva Shankar Raj : Department of Biotechnology, Annai College of Arts and Science (Affiliated by Bharathidasan University), Kovilacheri, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, India\n\nDOI : https://doi.org/10.32381/JPSR.2023.39.03.4\n\nPrice: 251\n\nAntioxidant and Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity of Basella alba Leaves\n\nBy: Neeta R.
