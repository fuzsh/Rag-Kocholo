        "text": "The concept that faith and science are in conflict is a relatively recent one. Oft-cited examples such as Galileo were primarily about politics and power, not science and religious beliefs. Even more recent examples such as the Scopes trial and the deliberate polarization of Christianity in America over abortion and the racial integration of schools were primarily politically motivated, as historian Mark Noll unpacks in his classic (and recently updated) book, The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind. https://lnkd.in/efRzQePH and Francis FitzGerald delves into in The Evangelicals, https://lnkd.in/ex8Rk_hs. But what do actual scientists today actually think about faith? That's the question that motivated sociologist Elaine Howard Ecklund to survey nearly 2,000 scientists at R1 universities across the U.S. over a decade ago. Her research showed that a surprising majority, 70%, considered themselves to be spiritual people, with fully half identifying with a specific religious label (e.g. Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, etc.) Now, she's taken her work global, and in a new study that includes scientists from eight countries and regions, including the UK, India, Hong Kong, Turkey and the US, she finds that at least 30% of respondents declare a religious affiliation. Unsurprisingly, Elaine's research has also found that scientists are not always open about their faith at work or in education settings. ‚ÄúI think there is the perception sometimes that other scientists won‚Äôt take you seriously if you talk about your faith,‚Äù she says. TBH, that was my own fear in 2009, when I co-wrote a book about climate change with my husband, a pastor. However, exactly the opposite happened. I found the scientific community and my colleagues to be extremely generous and supportive, regardless of whether they share my beliefs. On the other hand, I'm told nearly daily by people who identify as Christians that I can't be a real Christian if I'm a scientist (often accompanied by ad hominems). It's a sad commentary on how religion today is more about ideology than theology. If you're interested in how Elaine herself interprets her work and what she feels she's learned, I highly recommend her book, \"Why Science and Faith Need Eachother\" https://lnkd.in/eD4m7fyZ Read more about Elaine's research here: https://lnkd.in/e6jV9aEB\n\nAmerican Religion in the Era of Increasing Polarization - PDF: https://lnkd.in/guW_aWS5 Americans are increasingly polarized by a variety of metrics. The dimensions, extent, causes, and consequences of that polarization have been the subject of much debate. Yet despite the centrality of religion to early discussions, the analytical focus on America‚Äôs divides has largely shifted toward partisan identity, political ideology, race, and class interests. I show that religion remains powerfully implicated in all dimensions of American polarization, and sociologists must once again make religion more central to their analyses. After outlining research on American polarization, focusing on the role of religion, I survey findings within the burgeoning literatures on cultural transformation processes, (White) Christian nationalism, complex religion, and Americans‚Äô attitudes toward science in order to underscore the centrality of ethno-religious identities, religious demography, and religious institutions for both shaping and exacerbating various forms of polarization. Lastly, I propose an agenda for elucidating religion‚Äôs ongoing role in understanding polarization beyond public opinion research at the macro-, meso-, and micro-levels. Though polarization research has been dominated by political scientists, leveraging religion in our analyses‚Äînot merely as a sui generis variable, but as a site of complex social behavior‚Äîfacilitates novel sociological contributions to these literatures via our relative attention to multiple levels of analysis, theoretical eclecticism, and methodological fluidity.\n\nReligion: A Bridge Or A Battering Political Divide? We witness how religion and politics intersect in a conflictual and divisive way in many parts of the globe. For example, separating religious beliefs from political views in America's current political climate is challenging, to say the least. Mixing politics and religion can benefit some, like prayer, before making substantial political or related decisions. It can also increase secularization (a more worldly view) or lead to demonizing those with opposing viewpoints, which shows up in Congress, public places, the courts, and church meetings. The founding fathers of the USA applied their minds to this potential conflict. Separation of church and state is written into its founding documents, yet the philosophical debate continues. Where's the line between the two? As the debate hots up, the line remains blurred between political ideologies and religious ethics, philosophies, and principles. God gets mixed reviews on Amazon. This is perhaps surprising. Some slogans like ‚ÄúGod is Great!‚Äù are upbeat and positive. Many shoppers enthusiastically effuse. ‚ÄúWonderful,‚Äù \"Beautiful,\" and \"Amen,\" are some reviews beneath His best-known work, the Bible. Other reviewers remain critical. Americans remain divided and conflicted on the question. A 2019 Pew Research Center survey found that 63% of U.S. adults want religious groups to stay out of politics. More than 50% of Americans also view religion as a force for good in society. Consider it; where did many of us, as children, get our moral and ethical values and grounding, apart from our families and school teachers? For many, the church and religion played a significant role. But to what extent can and does religion become a battering political divide? 'Religious freedom for all' and 'national unity are best served when we respect and protect the individual beliefs of believers and non-believers alike - when we are \"bigger than any denomination. It allows people to express and practice their beliefs (or not) without fear or favor. Fear of persecution or discrimination while ensuring that no particular religion receives preferential treatment from the government and non-believers are protected, too. In a secular world, we can better promote societal equality and justice. To Unify, We Must Be \"Bigger\" than Any One Denomination of Believers. Tune in, Sign Up, and Share.

Journal: Religions. Open Access. (Cite Score 59/664 [Q1] in 'Religious Studies' category. Guest editor: Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Haynes, London Metropolitan University, UK; tsjhayn1@londonmet.ac.uk Deadline for paper submission: 31 October 2024 Details of special issue: https://lnkd.in/enGtqrGP Whether ranging from the United States to the Middle East or from Asia to Africa, religious nationalism is an important component of political activity and organisation in the world. At present, however, we lack a global survey of the political impact of religious nationalism. The relationship between religion and nationalism is not a new area of research. Nevertheless, it has grown in importance in recent years, as there has been a rise in examples of the phenomenon, with these often having significant political impacts. When there is a clear and sustained relationship present between religion and nationalism, a hybrid term of the two is then useful to use in the study of this phenomenon: that of ‚Äòreligious nationalism‚Äô. Religious nationalism signifies a demonstrably close, even synonymous, relationship between the concepts of ‚Äòreligion‚Äô and ‚Äònationalism‚Äô, which are not inherently close ideologically. Thus, religion corresponds to this context when it is a defining component of what a nation is said to comprise, helping to forge a collective ethos of identity and being expressed in a collective culture. As such, manifestations of religious nationalism depend on historical, religious, political, and cultural contexts.

A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2007 showed that in answer to the question ‚ÄòDo you need to believe in God to be moral?‚Äô, the overwhelming majority of people in countries outside Europe said yes. But surprisingly, perhaps, scientists remain divided on the question. Part of the reason for this is that there are many gods and many moral systems, and it isn‚Äôt always clear what we mean when we refer to either religion or morality. Nevertheless, one might still ask whether morality is in some way integral to religiosity bias. Do our intuitive ideas about the afterlife, contagion, or intelligent design fundamentally alter our moral behavior? Socrates posed a similar question when he asked whether goodness is loved by the gods because it is good or whether goodness is good because it is loved by the gods. The science of morality Today, some of the best answers to this question come not from Greek philosophy but from scientific research. Studies led by my colleague Oliver Scott Curry have shown that much of human morality is rooted in a single preoccupation: cooperation. More specifically, seven principles of cooperation are judged to be morally good everywhere and form the bedrock of a universal moral compass. Those seven principles are: help your kin, be loyal to your group, reciprocate favors, be courageous, defer to superiors, share things fairly, and respect other people‚Äôs property. This new idea was quite a big deal because up until then it seemed quite reasonable to assert ‚Äì as cultural relativists have always done ‚Äì that there are no moral universals, and each society has therefore had to come up with its own unique moral compass. As I will explain, this is not the case. Moreover, the same seven principles of cooperation on which these moral ideas are based are found in a wide range of social species and are not unique to human beings. These moral intuitions evolved because of their benefits for survival and reproduction. Genetic mutations favoring cooperative behaviors in the ancestors of social species, such as humans, conferred a reproductive advantage on the organisms adopting them, with the result that more copies of those genes survived and spread in ensuing generations. Take the principle that we should care for (and avoid harm to) members of our family. This moral imperative likely evolved via the mechanism of ‚Äòkin selection‚Äô, which ensures that we behave in ways that increase the chances of our genes being passed on by endeavoring to help our close genetic relatives to stay alive and produce offspring. Loyalty to group, on the other hand, evolves in social species that do better when acting in a coordinated way rather than independently. Reciprocity (the idea that I‚Äôll scratch your back if you scrat...\n\nFor a long time, I struggled to get a grip on the idea of 'Secularism'. What is Secularism? What does it really mean? Why do I have such conflicting feelings about it? Recently, I cracked it! The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines Secularism as \"indifference to, or exclusion of, religion and religious considerations.\" Growing up, my general understanding of Secularism was - \"Remove religion from life, and lo, I am secular!\" So I grew up removing even my own religion from my life! The problem with this \"exclude religion from life\" definition was that even though I excluded my religion from my life (and missed-out on its richness), I was tolerant towards the inclusion of others' religions in their lives (rightfully so). And before I knew, I became \"pseudo-secular\"! Let's get a better grip on this. If I am critical about my son, but praise the neighbor's kid, am I being a good neighbor? No! I am damaging my son's self-esteem. I know it. If I complain about my wife's cooking, but appreciate the neighbor's menu, am I being a sensitive neighbor? No! I am being mean to my wife! I know it. If I am comfortable saying Shukriyaan & Thank you, but cringe at saying Dhanyawaad, am I being secular? No, I am a hypocrite! I simply don't realize it. That's not to say that I should not praise the neighbor's kid or her cooking, nor that I should stop saying Shukriyaan or Thank you! That would be dogmatic - a perfect example of the pendulum swinging the other way! That's also divisive & counter-productive. We can not move ahead as a nation with dogma! Instead, I must accept my son for what he is, accept my folks for who they are, and be as comfortable saying Dhanyawaad as saying Shukriyaan or Thank you. That's when I am truly secular! Sensitivity begins at home! Only recently, I realized that Secularism is a very simple concept. I had unnecessarily complicated it. Secularism means \"All religions are equal!\" That means my religion is also equal. In fact, for me, my religion is \"first amongst equals!\" Secularism is an inclusive principle, not an exclusive one! #RediscoveringBharat aspires to connect Indians with the glory & essence of Bharat!\n\nThe UK's religious make-up is changing, but not in the way we might think. Some of the long term trends are completely as expected: ‚úÖ We're getting more secular - the number of adults who say they don't have a religion is now around 50% - up from a third in the early 1980s ‚úÖ Younger people are much less likely to have a religion. Nearly three-quarters of 18-24s aren't religious, and two-thirds of 25-34 year olds ‚úÖ Christianity is less dominant as a religion than it was. In 1983, only about 3% of people *with* a religion weren't Christian. Now, about 12% of the religious population follow a non-Christian religion. But there's other ways in which religious trends are developing that might be slightly counter to our expectations. ‚òë We have a looser connection with faith. Among those who are religious, 37% are now non denominational Christians. That was 5% a few decades ago. ‚òë In the last 20 years, increases in secularity have been driven more by older groups than younger. In Trajectory's latest Slow Futures piece (https://lnkd.in/eFF2Sn7i). We explore in detail these slow changes to a foundational aspect of UK society, and consider the implications of them for brands and institutions, our politics and constitution, and the rhythm of daily life.\n\nDear colleagues, please share this: Call for Papers: Perceptions of Gender in Early Modern Radical Religious Communities Participation, Text, Communication, and Reception. University of Copenhagen, 15th ‚Äì 17th May 2024. The purpose of this seminar is to elucidate and discuss perceptions of gender in radical Christian movements in the Early Modern Era. We wish to bring together researchers from different parts of Europe, thereby pursuing a transnational and trans-confessional approach. The aim is to investigate similarities and differences in narrative patterns, rhetorical strategies and practices, which surrounded alternative perceptions of gender in radical religious communities. Early modern scholarship has long had an interest in women's participation in religious communities. Especially in radical religious communities, such as the Quakers and radical Pietist, women were not only numerous, they also often took leading roles as organisers, prophets or mystics with immediate connections to a divine being. Furthermore, in recent years there has been an increasing focus on how women and men developed coherent theological interpretations, where femininity and different notions of gender were prominent and provided real alternatives to established theology. Presentations can address one or more of the following topics and questions: Participation: ‚ÄúRadical‚Äù is a modern term, which today is often used to designate believers, who in the Early Modern Era were nicknamed enthusiasts, quakers, separatists, atheists etc. What do we mean when we use the term, and which groups and convictions do we understand as radical? To what extent did men and women, who were marginalized by state churches and official theology, establish contact across countries and confessions? Did radical religious communities emulate discourses on gender from other religions or other denominations? What discourses and practices were prevalent in excluding women from the public sphere, and how did radical dissenters address and refute these? What happened when radical assemblies became institutionalised? Text and theology: How did radical religious men and women explain Biblical passages that exhorted women to silence and submission, and which did they identify as female-affirming or androgynous passages? What was the role of mysticism as a literary genre in this particular context? Communication: In which ways did women claim authority and what role did dreams, visions and bodily practices play in reinforcing their claim to election? Reception: How did moderate religious communities and the wider public respond to these developments? Is it possible to detect patterns of accusations? We invite researchers in any domain to submit proposals including an abstract of 200-300 words to the organizer, Juliane Engelhardt at juliane@hum.ku.dk. With your abstract, please submit a short biographical statement. The seminar will be held fully in person."
