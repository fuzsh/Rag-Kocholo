        "text": "Anandpur Sahib Resolution Authenticated\n\nby Sant Harchand Singh Longowal\n\nThe Resolution\n\nAdopted, in the light of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, at the open session of the 18th All India Akali Conference held at Ludhiana on 28-29 October, 1978 under the Presidentship of Jathedar Jagdev Singh Talwandi are as under:\n\n(It was after the passing of these Resolutions that Shiromani Akali Dal started the struggle therefore).\n\nResolution No. 1\n\nMoved by S. Gurcharan Singh Tohra, President Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee and endorsed by S. Prakash Singh Badal, Chief Minister, Punjab.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal realizes that India is a federal and republican geographical entity of different languages, religions and cultures. To safeguard the fundamental rights of the religious and linguistic minorities, to fulfil the demands of the democratic traditions and to pave the way for economic progress it has become imperative that the Indian constitutional infrastructure should be given a real federal shape by redefining the Central and State relations and rights on the line of aforesaid principles and objectives.\n\nThe concept of the total revolution given by Lok Naik Sh. Jaya Parkash Narain also based upon the progressive decentralization of powers. The climax of the process of centralization of powers of the states through repeated amendments of the Constitution during the Congress regime came before the countrymen in the form of the Emergency, when all fundamental rights of all citizens were usurped. It was then that the programme of decentralization of powers ever advocated by Shiromani Akali Dal was openly accepted and adopted by other political parties including Janata Party, C.P.I. (M), A.D.M.K. etc.\n\nShiromani Akali Dal has ever stood firm on this principle and that is why after very careful considerations it unanimously adopted a resolution to this effect first at all India Akali Conference, Batala, then at Shri Anandpur Sahib which has endorsed the principle of State autonomy in keeping with the concept of Federalism.\n\nAs such, the Shiromani Akali Dal emphatically urges upon the Janata Government to take cognizance of the different linguistic and cultural sections, religious minorities as also the voice of millions of people and recast the constitutional structure of the country on real and meaningful federal principles to obviate the possibility of any danger to National unity and the integrity of the Country and further, to enable the states to play a useful role for the progress and prosperity of the Indian people in their respective areas by the meaningful exercise of the powers.\n\nResolution No. 2\n\nThe momentous meeting of the Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Government of India to examine the long tale of the excesses, wrongs illegal actions committed by the previous Congress government, more particularly during Emergency, and try to find an early solution to the following problems:\n\nChandigarh originally raised as a Capital for Punjab should be handed over to Punjab.\n\nThe long standing demand of the Shiromani Akali Dal for the merger in Punjab of the Punjabi speaking areas, to be identified by linguistic experts with village as an unit, should be conceded.\n\nThe control of Head Works should continue to be vested in Punjab and, if need be, the Reorganization Act should be amended.\n\nThe arbitrary and unjust Award given by Mrs. Indira Gandhi during the Emergency on the distribution of Ravi-Beas waters should be revised on the universally accepted norms and principles, thereby justice be done to Punjab.\n\nKeeping in view the special aptitude and martial qualities of the Sikhs the present ratio of their strength in Army should be maintained.\n\nThe excess being committed on the settlers in the Terai region of UP in the name of Land Reforms should be vacated by making suitable amendments in the Ceiling Law on the Central guidelines.\n\nResolution No. 3\n\n(Economic Policy Resolution)\n\nThe chief sources of inspiration of the economic politics and programme of the Shiromani Akali Dal are the secular, democratic and socialistic concepts of Sri Guru Nanak Dev and Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Our Economic programme is based on three basic principles.\n\nDignity of Labour.\n\nAn economic and social structure which provides for the uplift of the poor and depressed sections of society.\n\nUnabated opposition to concentration of economic and political power in the hands of the capitalists.\n\nWhile drafting its economic policies and programme, the Shiromani Akali Dal in its historic Anandpur Sahib Resolution had laid particular on the need to break the monopolistic hold of the capitalists foisted on the Indian economy by 30 years of Congress rule in India. This capitalistic hold enabled the central government to assume all powers in its hands after the manner of Mughal Imperalism. This was bound to thwart the economic progress of the states and injure the social and economic interests of the people. The Shiromani Akali Dal once again reiterates the Sikh way of life by resolving to fulfil the holy words of Guru Nank Dev:\n\nHe alone realizes the True Path who labours honestly and shares the fruits of that Labour.\n\nThis way of life is based upon three basic principles:\n\nDoing honest labour.\n\nSharing the fruits of this labour, and\n\nMeditation on the Lords Name.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Central and the State Government to eradicate unemployment during the next ten years. While pursuing this aim special emphasis should be laid on ameliorating the lot of the weaker sections, Scheduled and depressed classes, workers, landless and poor farmers and urban poor. Minimum wages should be fixed for them all.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal urges upon the Punjab Government to draw up such an economic plan for the State as would turn it into the leading province during the next ten years, by raising per capita income to Rs. 3,000 and by generating an economic growth rate of 7% per annum as against 4% at National level.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal gives first priority to the redrafting of the taxation structure in such a way that the burden of taxation is shifted from the poor to the richer classes and an equitable distribution of National income is ensured.\n\nThe main plank of the economic programme of the Shiromani Akali Dal is enable the economically weaker sections of the Society to share the fruits of National income.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Central Government to make an international air-field at Amritsar which should also enjoy the facilities of a dry port. Similarly a Stock Exchange should be opened at Ludhiana to accelerate the process of industrialisation and economic growth in the State. The Shiromani Akali Dal also desires that suitable amendments should be made in the Foreign Exchange rules for free exchange of foreign currencies and thereby removing the difficulties being faced by the Indian emigrants.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal emphatically urges upon the Indian Government to bring a parity between the prices of the agricultural produce and that of the industrial raw materials so that the discrimination against such states which lack these materials may be removed.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal demand that exploitation of the producers of the cash crops like cotton, sugarcane, oil seeds etc. at the hands of the traders should be stopped forthwith and for such a purpose arrangements for the purchase of these crops by the government, at remunerative prices should be made. Besides, effective steps should be taken by the government for the purchase of cotton through the Cotton Corporation.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal strongly feels that most pressing National problem is the need to ameliorate the lot of millions of exploited persons belonging to the scheduled classes. For such a purpose the Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Central and State Governments to earmark special funds. Besides the State Governments should allot sufficient funds in their respective budgets for giving free residential plots both in the urban and rural areas to the Scheduled Castes.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal also calls for the rapid diversification of farming. The shortcomings in the Land Reforms Laws should be removed, rapid industrialization of the State, ensured the credit facilities for the medium industries, expanded and unemployment allowance given to those who are unemployed. For remunerative farming perceptive reduction should be made in the prices of farm machinery like tractors, tubewells as also the inputs etc.\n\nResolution No. 4\n\nThis huge session of the Shiromani Akali Dal regards the discrimination to which the Punjabi language is being subjected in the adjoining States of Himachal, Haryana, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir etc. It is firm demand that in accordance with the Nehru Language Formula the neighbouring States of Punjab should give second language status to the Punjabi language because a fairly large sections of their respective population are Punjabi speaking.\n\nResolution No. 5\n\nThe meeting regrets the claims of the refugees who had migrated to Jammu and Kashmir as a result of the partition of the country, no compensation has been provided to them even after such a long time and these unfortunate refugees are rotting in the camps ever since then.\n\nThe Akali Dal Session therefore forcefully demands that their claims should be soon settled and immediate steps should be taken to rehabilitate them even if it involves an amendment in Section 370.\n\nResolution No. 6\n\nThe 18th session of the All India Conference notes with satisfaction that mechanization of farming in the country handled to increase in the farm yield and as a result the country is heading towards self-sufficiency.\n\nHowever, the session feels that poor farmers are unable to take to mechanization because of the enormity of the cost involved.\n\nAs such, the Shiromani Akali Dal urges upon the Government of India to abolish the excise duty on tractors so that with the decrease in their prices the ordinary farmers may also be able to avail of farm machinery and contribute to the growth of gross agricultural produce of the country.\n\nResolution No. 8\n\nThe meeting of the Shiromani Akali Dal appeals to the Central and State Government to pay particular attention to the poor and labouring classes and demands that besides making suitable amendments in the Minimum Wages Act, suitable legal steps should be taken to improve the economic lot of the labouring class to enable it to lead a respectable life and play a useful role in the rapid industrialization of the country.\n\nResolution No. 9\n\nThis session seeks permission from the Government of India to install a broadcasting station at Golden Temple, Amritsar, for the relay of Gurbani Kirtan for the spiritual satisfaction of those Sikhs who are living in foreign lands.\n\nThe session wishes to make it clear that the entire cost of the proposed Broadcasting Project would be borne by the Khalsa Panth and its over-all control shall vest with the Indian Government. We have every hope that the government would have no hesitation in conceding this demand after the consideration.\n\nResolution No. 10\n\nThe huge Session of the Shiromani Akali Dal strongly urges upon the Government of India to make necessary amendments in the following enactments for the benefit of the agricultural classes who have toiled hard for the larger national interests:\n\nBy suitable amendment in the relevant clause of the Hindu Succession Act, a women should be given rights of inheritance in the properties of her father-in-law instead of the fathers.\n\nThe agricultural land of the farmers should be completely exempted from the Wealth Tax and the Estate Duty.\n\nResolution No. 11\n\nThe vast Session of the Shiromani Akali Dal strongly impresses upon the Government of India that keeping in view the economic backwardness of the scheduled and non-scheduled castes provisions proportionate to population should be made in the budget for utilization for their welfare. A special ministry should be created at the Central as a practical measure to render justice to them on the basis of the reservation.\n\nThe Session also calls upon the government that in keeping with the settlement already no discrimination should be made between the Sikh and Hindu Harijans in any part of the country.\n\nResolution No. 12\n\nThe Congress government is called upon to vacate the gross injustice discrimination done to Punjab in the distribution of Ravi-Beas waters. The Central Government must also give approval for the immediate establishment of six sugar and four textile mills in Punjab so that the state may be able to implement its agro-industrial policy.\n\nBasic Postulates of The Shiromani Akali Dal\n\nAs adopted by the working committee of the Shiromani Akali Dal at its meeting held at Sri Anandpur Sahib on 16-17 October, 1973.\n\n(A) Postulates\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal is the very embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of the Sikh Nation and as such is fully entitled to its representation. The basic postulates of this Organization are Human progress and ultimate unity of all human beings with the Spiritual Soul.\n\nThese postulates are based upon the three great principles of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, namely, a Meditation on Gods Name, dignity of labour and sharing of fruits of this Labour.(Nam Japo, Kirat Karo, Wand Chhako)\n\n(B) Purposes\n\nThis Shiromani Akali Dal shall ever strive to achieve the following aims:\n\nReiteration of the unicity (Oneness) of God, meditation on His Name, recitation of Gurbani, renewal of faith on the ten Holy Sikh Gurus and the Holy Sri Guru Granth Sahib and other appropriate measures for such a purpose.\n\nGrooming accomplished preachers, Ragis, Dhandis, and poets in the Sikhs Missionary College for a more effective propagation of Sikhism, Sikh Philosophy, belief in Sikh code of conduct and Kirtan etc. at home and abroad, in schools and colleges, in villages and in cities as indeed at every place.\n\nBaptising the Sikhs (Amrit Prachar) on a vast scale, with particular emphasis on Schools and College of which the teachers and the taught shall be enthused through regular study circles.\n\nReinculcate the religious practice of DASWAND among the Sikhs. (Given one tenth of ones earnings for the welfare of the Community).\n\nGenerating feelings of respect for the Sikh intellectuals, writers, preachers, granthis, etc., who also in turn, would be enthused to improve upon their accomplishments while conforming to the basic Sikh tenets and traditions.\n\nStreamlining the Gurdwara administration by giving better training to their workers. Appropriate steps would also be taken to maintain Gurdwara buildings in proper condition. For such a purpose, the party representatives in the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee and local Committees would be directed time to time to pull their weight.\n\nMaking appropriate arrangements for the error free publication of Gurbani; promoting research work in the ancient and modern Sikh history as also its publication; rendering Gurbani in other languages and producing first rate literature on Sikhism.\n\nTaking appropriate steps for the enactment of an All India Gurdwara Act with a view to introduce improvements in the administration of the Gurdwaras throughout the country and to reintegrate the traditional preaching sects to Sikhism like Udasis and Nirmalas with the mainstream of Sikhism without in any way encroaching on the properties of the respective individuals maths.\n\nTaking such steps as may be necessary to bring the Sikh Gurdwaras all over the world under a single system of administration with a view to run them according to the basic Sikh norms and to pool their sources for the dissemination of Sikhism on a wider and more impressive scale.\n\nStriving for free access to all those holy Sikh Shrines, including Nankana Sahib from which the Sikh Panth has been separated, for pilgrimage and proper upkeep.\n\nPolitical Goal\n\nThe political goal of the Panth without doubt, is enshrined in the commandments of the Tenth Lord, in the pages of Sikh history and in the very heart of the Khalsa Panth, the ultimate objective of which is the pre-eminence of the Khalsa.\n\nThe fundamental policy of the Shiromani Akali Dal is to seek the realization of this birth right of the Khalsa through creation of congenial environment and a political set up.\n\nFor attainment of this aim\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal is determined to strive by all possible means to:\n\nHave, all those Punjabi speaking areas deliberately kept on: of Punjab, such as Dalhousie in Gurdaspur District; Chandigarh; Pinjore-Kalka and Ambala Saddar etc. in Ambala District; the entire Una tehsils of Hoshiarpur District; the Desh area of Nalagarh; Shahabad and Gulha blocks of Karnal District; Tohana Sub-Tehsil, Ratia block and Sirsa tehsil of Hissar District and six tehsil of Ganganagar District in Rajasthan; merged with Punjab to constitute a single administrative unit where the interests of the Sikhs and Sikhism are specifically protected.\n\nIt this new Punjab and in other States the Centre's interference would be restricted to Defence, Foreign relations Currency and General Communication; all other departments would be in the jurisdiction of Punjab (and other states) which would be fully entitled to frame own laws on these subjects for administration. For the above departments of the Centre, Punjab and other States contribute in the proportion to representation in the Parliament.\n\nThe Sikhs and other religious minorities living out of Punjab should be adequately protected against any kind of discrimination.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal would also endeavour to have the Indian Constitution recast on real federal principles, with equal representation at the Centre for all the States.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal strongly denounces the foreign policy of India framed by the Congress party. It is worthless, hopeless and highly detrimental to the interests of the country, the Nation and the mankind at large. Shiromani Akali Dal shall extend its support only to that foreign policy of India which is based on the principles of peace and national interests. It strongly advocates a policy of peace with all neighbouring countries, especially those inhabited by the Sikhs and their sacred shrines. The Akali Dal is of the firm view that our foreign policy should in no case play second fiddle to that of any other country.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal shall raise its firm voice against any discrimination against any Sikh (or even other) employees of the Central or State Governments. The Shiromani Akali Dal shall also endeavour to maintain the traditional position of the Sikhs in all the wings of the defence departments and the Panth would pay particular attention to the needs of the Sikh Armymen. The Shiromani Akali Dal would also see that 'kirpan' is accepted as an integral part of the Uniform of the Sikhs in Army.\n\nIt shall be the primary duty of the Shiromani Akali Dal to help rehabilitate the ex-servicemen of the Defence Departments in the civil life and or such a purpose it would extend them every help to enable them to organize themselves so that they are able to raise their voice in an effective way of giving adequate concessions and proper safeguards for a life of self-respect and dignity.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal is of the firm opinion that all those persons males or females -- who have not been convicted of any criminal offences by a court of law, should be at liberty to possess all types of small arms, like revolvers, guns, pistols, rifles, carbines etc., without any licence, the only obligation being their registration.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal seeks ban on the sale of liquor and other intoxicants and shall press for prohibition on the consumption of intoxicants and smoking on public places.\n\nThe Economic Policy and Programme of The Shiromani Akali Dal\n\nAs adopted by its Working Committee on 17th October, 1973 at its meeting held at Sri Anandpur Sahib:\n\nAlthough the mainstay of the Indian economy is agriculture and all those political powers who claim to raise social structure on the basis of justice cannot afford to ignore this fact, yet this is a hard fact that the levers of economic powers, continue to be in the hands of big traders, capitalists and monopolists. Some marginal benefits might have accrued to other classes, but the benefits of economic growth have been reaped by these categories during the last 26 years after Independence. The political power has also been misappropriated by these classes which are wielding the same for their own benefits. As such, any peaceful attempt to usher in a new era of social justice would have to break the economic and political strongholds of these categories of the people.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal strongly advocates that the growing gulf between the rich and the poor, in the urban and rural areas both, should be abridged but, it is of the firm opinion that, for such a purpose, the first assault would have to be made on the classes who have assumed all the reins of economic power in their hands. In rural areas, the Akali Dal determined to help the weaker classes, like the scheduled castes, backward classes, landless tenants, ordinary labourers, the poor and middle class farmers. For such a purpose, it stands for meaningful land reforms which envisage a ceiling of 30 standard acres and the distribution of excess land among the poor farmers.\n\nThe motto of the Shiromani Akali Dal is to provide employment for all, requisite food and clothing for all, a house to live in, suitable transport and to create means to fulfil all those necessities of a civilized life without which life appears incomplete.\n\nAs such, the economic policy of the Shiromani Akali Dal shall endeavour to achieve the following objectives:\n\nAgriculture Sector\n\nDuring recent years the agriculture sector has witnessed land reforms and green revolution. The Shiromani Akali Dal undertakes to enrich the green revolution by an increase in yield per acre. It shall also ensure perceptible improvement in the standard of living of all rural classes, more particularly of the poor and the middle class farmers, as also the landless labourers. For such a purpose it plans to work on the following lines:\n\nIntroducing land reforms and measures for increasing agricultural production with a view to remove the growing gap between the rich and the poor. For such a purpose the existing legislation on land ceiling would have to be revised and a firm ceiling of 30 standard acres per family would have to be enforced with proprietary rights to the actual tillers. The excess land would be distributed among the landless tenants and poor farmers, while the cultivable government land unused shall be distributed among the landless classes, especially the scheduled castes and tribes. While distributing such lands the interests of Harijans and landless labourers would be particularly taken care of. The Akali Dal would also consider the possibilities of allowing the tenants to service loans by mortgaging the land under their plough, as also prohibiting the scheduled castes/tribes and backward classes from mortgaging the land distributed among them.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal shall work for the modernization of farming and would also try to enable the middle class and poor farmers to seek loans and inputs made available by different agencies.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal shall try to fix the prices of the agricultural produce on the basis of the returns of the middle class farmers. Such prices would be notified well before the sowing seasons and only the State government would be empowered to fix such prices.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal stands for complete nationalization of the wholesale trade in foodgrains through the establishment of State agencies.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal strongly opposes the demarcation of food zones and the attendant restrictions on the movements of foodgrains. The whole country should be the single food zone.\n\nThe party shall make special efforts to bring the Thein Dam and the Bhatinda Thermal plants to a speedy completion so that increased and cheaper power and irrigation facilities are made available. Definite efforts would be made for the establishment of an Atomic power station in the state.\n\nCo-operative societies would be set up in the rural areas. In all those areas where canal water is not available small irrigation projects would be taken in hand.\n\nIndustrial Sector\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal strongly advocates that all key industries should be under the public sector.\n\nIt is of the opinion that consumer industries should be immediately nationalized to stabilize the prices of the consumer goods and to save the poor consumer from exploitation at the hands of the industrialists and the middlemen.\n\nThe public sector industries should be established in such a way that the imbalance between different States is removed.\n\nA planned effort to establish agro-industries in the rural areas should be made to relieve the growing population pressure in the urban areas. The industrial management should be democratized by enabling the workers to have a say in the management and by fair distribution of profits between the industrialists and the workers. The credit agencies, especially the nationalized banks, should be directed to invest a fixed ratio of their deposits in the rural areas. Every industrial unit beyond worth one crore assets should be brought under the public sector. The Akali Dal stands for progressive nationalization of Transport.\n\nThe Public Sector units should be fully autonomous and manned by competent young executives drawn from a central pool of talent.\n\nEconomic Policy\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal demands that the whole tax structure be revised in such a way that the evasion of taxes and the flow of black money is completely eradicated. It stands for a straightforward system of taxation. The present infrastructure of taxation weighs heavily against the poor and enables the rich to bypass it. The party stands for a more realistic policy in this respect so that the black money running a parallel economy may be usefully employed.\n\nWorkers, Middle Class Employees and Agricultural Labour.\n\nFor their benefits the Shiromani Akali Dal would try its best:\n\nTo fix need based wages for industrial workers.\n\nTo bring progressive improvement in the standard of living of government employees.\n\nTo re-assess the minimum wages of agricultural labour and to standard of living for them.\n\nTo take necessary steps to provide roofed accommodation for standard of living for them.\n\nTo take necessary steps to provide roofed accommodation for the rural and urban poor.\n\nUnemployment\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal stands for full employment in the country. For such a purpose it is of the firm opinion that the Govt. must provide immediate employment to the educated and trained persons, otherwise reasonable unemployment allowance should be paid to them. This amount should be shared by the centre and the state government. The minimum rates of such an allowance should be as under:\n\n. All persons above the age of 65, should be given old-age pension.\n\nWeaker Section and Backward Classes\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal shall try to improve the economic conditions of the backward classes and weaker sections of Society by extending them facilities for education, employment and other concessions, to enable them to come at par with other sections of society. Foodgrains at cheaper rates would be made available to them.\n\nEducational and Cultural\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal aims at grooming the Sikhs into a strong and sturdy Nation highly educated, fully aware of its fundamental rights, very well versed in various arts and ever ready to honour the more outstanding of its sons. For such a purpose:\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal regards the educationalists, scientists, philosophers, poets, writers and artists of the Sikh Nation as its most prized asset.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal stands for compulsory and free education upto matric standard.\n\nTo check the growing rate of unemployment, Shiromani Akali Dal would try to introduce such courses to study as would enable their students to get immediate employment on completion of a course.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal shall make arrangements for the education of the rural and weaker Classes and would also make provision for the higher education of the more promising students among them.\n\nPunjabi would be a compulsory subject for all students upto the matric standard.\n\nSpecial attention would be paid to the science and technical field of education, with particular emphasis on the study of Nuclear physics and space science in the University.\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal shall try to improve the standard of games and bring them on level with international standards.\n\nSd/-\n\nGiani Ajmer Singh\n\nSecretary. Dated: 1-8-1977\n\nShiromani Akali Dal."
