        "text": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a nerve damaging disorder associated with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic microvascular injuries involving small blood vessels that supplies to nerves i.e., Vasa nervorum are responsible for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nIn Ayurveda, Madhumeha Vyadhi has similarity with Diabetes Mellitus. Madhumeha is one of the four varieties of Vataja Prameha. It is Asadhya (incurable) stage, Madhumeha gives rise to many Upadrava (complication) viz. Daha (burning sensation), Suptata (numbness), Harsha (tingling sensation), Shosha (wasting), Dourbalya (weakness), and Angasada. These Upadrava (complication) of Madhumeha, which are nearly similar to the symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nIt is a common condition, often unreported and inadequately treated resulting in a great deal of morbidity.\n\nThe functions of peripheral nerves are damaged in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In Ayurveda, Vata Dosha especially Vyanavayu performs the functions of peripheral nerves. The functions of normal Vata Dosha are Utsahashakti (enthusiasm), Shwasa Prashwasa Kriya (respiration), Chesta (motor and reflex activities) etc; hence it acts as receptor, as well as a stimulator.\n\nThe function of a peripheral nerve is to transmit signals from the spinal cord to the rest of the body or to transmit sensory information from the rest of the body to the spinal cord. Nerve impulse can be correlate with functions of normal Vata Dosha as it is self-originated, propagated, it reaches anywhere. Hence, the disease Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is considered as an abnormal function of Vata Dosha.\n\nPrevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in India is about 26.1%. In region of Maharashtra, it was found to be 30.3% in 2015 study. As estimated, it is 2.8% affecting 171 million people worldwide, in year 2000. With current trends, the prevalence worldwide is estimated to reach 4.4%, affecting 366 million people by the year 2030.\n\nHypothesis\n\nH0 - Madhutailika Basti has no significant effect on Madhumehajanya Nadipratan Shothar.t Diabetic Neuropathy\n\nH1 – Madhutailika Basti has significant effect on Madhumehajanya Nadipratan Shothar.t Diabetic Neuropathy\n\nNeed of Study\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is relatively earlier and commonest poorly controlled complication occurring in almost every 3rd diabetic in same form or the other. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, and topical capsaicin, of which duloxetine and pregabalin have been approved by the US FDA. These regimens are effective but most of them are expensive and having side effect. Madhutailika Basti is believed to have a noteworthy role in the management of such impaired metabolic condition by importing equilibrium state of Doshas, nourishes the Dhatu and maintains the blood sugar level. This research study is being conducted to find out cost effective treatment of Diabetes Neuropathy and improve the quality of life. The number of people suffering from diabetic neuropathy is rising tremendously and at an alarming rate on the global scale which is having a strong negative impact on the entire society at large and hence it is the prime need of the hour to find a reliable solution in order to combat the problem and hence the current study was undertaken.\n\nIngredients\n\nMadhu (Honey) – 4 Pala – (16 Tola) - 160 ml\n\nErandamool Kwatha (Ricinus communis) - 8 Pala (32 tola) = 320 ml\n\nTil Tail (Sesamum indicum) - 4 Pala (16 Tola) - 160 ml\n\nSatapushpa Kalka (Anethum sowa) - 3 Karsha = 30 gm\n\nSaindhava - 1 Karsha = 10 gms\n\nSOP of preparation of Madhutailika Basti\n\nInitially 100ml of Madhu and 5gm of Saindhava Lavana are taken in the equipment. Preparation is continued until Lavana is completely dissolved. Then 100ml of Tila Taila is added and again mixed for specific time period. Here oil layer should become minute globules, mixture should become homogeneous. It is followed by adding of 10gm of Shatapushpa Kalka. Mixing is done so that Kalka particles remain uniformly distributed and do not settle down at the base of the vessel. At last 320 ml of Erandamula Kwatha is added, mixing is continued until it properly mixes with oil globules. Homogeneity of final mixture is assessed with certain features under the heading Suyojithaniruhalakshana. Finally quantity of 530 ml Basti formulation is measured.\n\nMethods\n\nResearch Place: Dept of Kayachikitsa, OPD/IPD, DY Patil School of Ayurveda, Nerul, Navi Mumbai\n\nTable 1: Type of Study Single Arm Clinical Study\n\nSample size 30 patients Medicine Madhutailika Basti Dose 530 ml Duration 8 days Kala Prataha (Abhakata) Type of Basti Niruhavata Parihara Kala 16 days\n\nSample\n\nTotal numbers of 30 subjects were selected from the OPD and IPD of Dr. D.Y. Patil College of Ayurveda, Research Institute and Hospital.\n\nThe patients were assessed according to case report form.\n\nMethod of Data Collection\n\nTable 8: Age wise Distribution of 30 patients.\n\nAge in yrs.

Followed by 13.33% patients to age group 70 yrs& above.\n\nTable 9: Gender wise distribution of 30 patients\n\nSex No. of patients Percentage Male 11 36.67% Female 19 63.33%\n\nGender: It is evident from table that maximum no. of patients i.e., 63.33% was female and 36.67% were male.\n\nTable 10: Religion wise Distribution of 30 Patients\n\nReligion No. of patients Percentage Hindu 26 86.67% Muslim 4 13.33%\n\nReligion: In this series of 30 patient maximum number of patients i.e. 86.67% patients were Hindu, whereas 13.33% patients were from Muslim community.\n\nTable 11: Occupation wise Distribution of 30 Patients.\n\nOccupation No. of patients Percentage Service 6 20.00% Housewife 14 46.67% Retired 7 23.33% Business 3 10.00%\n\nOccupation: Maximum number of patients i.e. 20% patients were doing service, followed by 46.67 % were housewives 23.33% patients were Retired, and 10 % were in business.\n\nTable 12: Marital status of 30 Patients.\n\nMarital Status No. of patients Married 35 Unmarried 0\n\nMarital status: The maximum i.e. 100% of the patients were married, followed by 0% patients were unmarried.\n\nTable 13: Diet Habit of 30 Patients\n\nDiet No. of patients Percentage Vegetarian 6 20.00% Mixed 24 80.00%\n\nDiet Habit: Patients (20%) of this series were vegetarian and 80% were having the habit of mix diet of vegetarian and non-vegetarian.\n\nTable 15: Prakriti wise Distribution of 30 patients\n\nPrakruti No. of patients Percentage Vata-Pitta 4 13.33% Kapha-Vata 18 60.00% Kapha-Pitta 8 26.67%\n\nPrakriti: All the patients of this series were having Dvandaja Prakriti with 26.67 % patients of Kapha-Pitta and 60 % of Vata-Kapha Prakriti. Remaining 13.33% patients were of Vata-Pitta Prakriti.\n\nTable 16: Agni wise Distribution of 30 patients.\n\nAgni No. of Patients Percentage Sama 0 0.00% Vishama 7 23.33% Tikshna 3 10.00% Manda 20 66.67%\n\nAgni: 66.67 % patients were of Mandagni, 23.33 % were of Vishamaagni, 10 % patients were of Tikshnaagni, and none patients were of Samaagni.\n\nTable 17: Koshtha wise Distribution of 30 patients\n\nKostha No. of Patients Percentage Krura 7 23.33% Mridu 2 6.67% Madhyam 21 70.00%\n\nKoshta: Maximum number of patients of this series were of Madhyamakoshtha (70 %), followed by Krura (23.33%) and Mridu (6.67%) Koshtha.\n\nTable 18: Socioeconomic wise distribution of 30 patients\n\nClass No. of Patients Percentage Upper Class 10 33.33% Middle Class 17 56.67% Lower Class 3 10.00%\n\nSocioeconomic: Maximum number of patients of this series were from Middle class (56.67 %), followed by Upper Class (33.33%) and Lower Class (10%).\n\nMadhutailka Basti maintains the equilibrium of the body tissue with Hridya and prevents exhaustion or Dhatupaka to prevent loss of Ojas, and nourishes all Dhatu tissue including Mansa- Majja and Shukra and enhances more strength to the Dhatus at the cellular levels and increase the proper cellular.\n\nIt produces the following changes:\n\nCure the vitiated or aggravated Dosha (elimination of circulatory waste products)\n\nIncreases digestive capacity (altered metabolism - Agni Sanrakshan)\n\nPurification of Koshtha and remove the constipation (Koshthashudi)\n\nStrengthen the host defence mechanism without increasing circulatory levels of sugar, facts and metabolities.\n\nEnhances the function of all Agni Sthula and Sukshmaagni (Aamapachana)\n\nProduction of better Dhatus and Upadhatus (immunomodulatory action - Dhatusanrakshana)\n\nEnhances strength of body (adaptogenic activity)\n\nProper functioning of nervous tissues (improvement of micro circulation by modulation of macrophage function - Strotoshodhana)\n\nIncreases the resistance of body (Dhatuvardhana - maintain tissue regeneration).\n\nFrom the above discussion it is clear Madhutailika Basti is one among Yapna Basti. It is Nirapada and Nishparihara / Ishatparihara, having both Langhana as well as Brihmana Karma, this is Nishparihara and Nirapada Basti can be practiced even in Bala, Vruddha, Stree, Sukumaras without any complications. It is Pushkala Phala Pradhana and Sarvakaladeyamana Basti like Matra Basti. “Yasmat Madhu Cha Tailam Cha Pradhanyenadeeyate.” This unique Basti contains Madhu and Taila as main ingredient, hence this Basti is named as Madhutailika Basti. Madhu is Yogavahi, and basically it does Karshana by Rukshadiguna. Simillarly Tilataila also causes Lekhana by its Teekshnoshnadiguna after reaching each and every Srotas by its Sukshmaguna. Basti\n\nAyurveda suggested use of Shodhana Chikitsa for the management of metabolic disorder such as Diabetes. Shodhana Chikitsa pacifies vitiated Doshas and break pathogenesis of disease. Basti Karma normalizes Vata, Kapha, Meda, Kleda and Sneha for the management of Avaranjanya Madhumeha. Basti controls Vyan and Apan Vayu which play significant role in the pathogenesis of Madhumeha. Basti reduces Shirahshoola, Anidra, Bhrama and Santapa which may precipitate Diabetes. The proposed autoimmune theory of modern science may be correlated to the Oja Dushtiavastha seen in long lasting Prameha and its Upadravas especially Diabetic Neuropathy. Although there was good symptomatic relief in Diabetic Neuropathy at the end of the trial revealed in these patients.\n\nThe patients showed excellent improvement in almost all the symptoms. The more bothering symptoms of Diabetic Neuropathy were pain, burning sensation, tingling sensation, numbness and hyperaesthesia. All these symptoms appeared to have improved in 30 days. The present study is carried out to evaluate the effect of Madhutailika Basti based on the properties like Medho Kaphahara and Vatahara, Deepana, Pachana, and Srotoshodhaka. Madhutailika Basti is believed to have a noteworthy role in the management of such impaired metabolic condition by importing equilibrium state of Doshas, nourishes the Dhatu and maintains the blood sugar level. This research study is being conducted to find out cost effective treatment of Diabetes Neuropathy & improve the quality of life.\n\nThus, procedure acts only on functional deformity and not on the structural deformity because this disease is Asadhya. No untoward effect of the drug was noticed after administration for a period of 8 days.\n\nResult obtained with respect to the parameter burning sensation, tingling sensation, numbness, weakness & Neuropathy Disability Score had shown statistically improvement. Madhutalika Basti present window of opportunity in the clinical management of Diabetic Neuropathy. There were symptomatic"
