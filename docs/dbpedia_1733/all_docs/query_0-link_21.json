        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nAnthropogenic impacts' intensity on the environment is increasing, resulting in disproportionate biodiversity loss and ecosystem services collapse (Butchart et al., 2010; Laurance et al., 2012). Like habitat modification, poaching also represents a major threat to wildlife (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Dirzo et al., 2014). These multiple and increasing anthropogenic stressors result in cumulative effects with the potential to cause large-scale changes in ecosystems (Griffith et al., 2011), and make many species endangered (Beisiegel, 2017). Poaching, for example, is an activity that can negatively impact several populations of target species (Watson et al., 2013). The millionaire black market, especially in Asia, makes poaching effect on biodiversity even more dramatic. Even with international pressure to end illegal trade, thousands of animals are slaughtered annually, mainly in Africa, to supply the black market (Poachin Facts, 2020). In East Africa, for example, the elephant population has declined by almost 50% in recent decades due to poaching (Simons, 2016). While in India, populations of tigers, leopards, Asian rhinos, and elephants are also suffering severe declines because of the market self-worth of their skins and ivories (Poaching Facts, 2020).\n\nPoaching is a widespread activity in several parts of the world generating impacts that include population reductions or extirpation, additional capture of non-target species threatened with extinction and reducing ecological interactions in the communities (Peres, 2000; Becker et al., 2013; Sousa and Srbek-Araujo, 2017; Ferreguetti et al., 2019). Although in some context subsistence is the main reason for hunting, there are several other motivations that lead people to hunt wild animals (Bell et al., 2007). Hunting is an activity deeply rooted in cultural and social traditions (Castilho et al., 2017). In Brazil, poaching is widespread throughout the territory (Bragagnolo et al., 2019), but in the Brazilian semiarid region (Caatinga domain), this activity becomes even more dramatic. Given the adverse conditions of Caatinga, rural populations have developed a strong relationship and dependence on natural resources, and poaching intensity is high and occurs since human occupation in the region, which has endangered the persistence and even caused local extinctions of some species (Alves et al., 2016). In the last decade, a wide scope of Ethnozoological study was produced for the Brazilian semi-arid region (Bezerra et al., 2011; Souza and Alves, 2014; Barbosa et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2019; Chaves et al., 2020). These studies demonstrated different uses of wild fauna by rural communities, which include food, medicinal use, religious rituals and pets.\n\nIn this context, wildlife harvesting can reach unsustainable levels due to increased human population and demand for wildlife, improved hunting techniques and increased access to natural environments (Castilho et al., 2017). Caatinga's rapid and continuous large-scale advancement of infrastructure, especially wind farms, has significantly increased access and facilitated poaching activities in several previously remote regions (Dias et al., 2019). Similar scenarios have been observed in the forests of the Congo, where the establishment of logging companies has resulted in the expansion of roads and consequently boosted poaching and illegal bushmeat trade (Wilkie et al., 2000). In Brazil, hunting has been banned for over 50 years by the Wildlife Protection Act (Federal Law 5197/1967) and ratified by the Environmental Crime Law (Federal Law 9605/1998) and is permitted only for subsistence purposes on indigenous lands and in extremely poor rural areas. Those who break the law are subject to detention from six months to one year, and a fine (art. 29 Federal Law 9605/98).\n\nAlthough penalties be tripled for poaching within protected areas and for the killing of endangered species (art. 29 Federal Law 9605/98), unfortunately poaching in Brazil occurs intensely, even in protected areas (Sousa and Srbek-Araujo, 2017). This is partly because these protected areas are insufficiently managed due to the lack of human, financial and infrastructure resources to monitor and combat poaching (Peres and Lake, 2003; Ferreguetti et al., 2018). In addition, a quantitative metric is lacking to effectively assess the impact of poaching across the Neotropical region (Ferreguetti et al., 2019). Therefore, given the critical need for effective allocation of limited resources to combat environmental crime, understanding spatial and temporal patterns of poaching is an essential component of focusing conservation efforts on protected areas (Watson et al., 2013).\n\nIn this scenario, combating poaching is a challenge worldwide, given that efforts against this illegal practice are always underfunded and with few resources. In this study, we combined occupancy models and heat map technique to identify where hunting activities occur most intensely in protected areas of an endemic ecosystem of Brazil. With our distribution models, we aimed to illustrate areas with a high probability of poaching and help environmental agents to allocate their limited resources in these areas. Our general hypothesis was that poaching spatial distribution and intensity is higher in sites with greater accessibility. We then predicted that the probability of poachers' occupancy and detection would be higher at sites closer to human settlements and roads. Considering that water is a limiting and scarce resource in the Caatinga domain, we expected to find a negative correlation between the likelihood of occupancy and detection of poachers and the distance to permanent water holes. We also predicted that poachers' occupancy and detection would be higher at locations with higher frequency of game species.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur study was carried out in the largest continuum of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in Brazil, a representative area and considered a high priority for conservation. We showed that occupancy modeling can be a useful tool to identify areas with a higher incidence of poaching in protected areas, using different covariables that can influence the occupancy and detectability of poachers. Our findings indicated that distance to roads and frequency of game species were the best-fitted covariates to estimate poaching distribution in the protected areas of Boqueirão da Onça. These predictive models can help environmental managers to identify and combat these illegal activities.\n\nAmong our accessibility covariates, the distance from roads was the only that influenced the spatial distribution of poachers. Our findings reflected a strong influence of roads on poacher's detectability. Similar relationships were observed in other regions of Brazil and around the world (Wilkie et al., 2000; Barboza et al., 2016), where the spatial distribution of poaching occurrence and intensity was highly correlated with accessibility. Roads are considered strong predictors of poaching as they act as access routes between settlements and favorite hunting grounds (Watson et al., 2013). In Caatinga, poachers increasingly use roads to access areas deemed most suitable for poaching (Barboza et al., 2016). Economic development is particularly important for human societies, especially in less favored areas, such as the Brazilian semiarid region. The establishment of wind farms in various locations in Caatinga has somewhat changed this landscape, providing employment and income for several families in rural communities. However, these large infrastructures have been of concern to conservation biologists operating in the region (Dias et al., 2019). Although wind power is an important source of renewable energy, it also causes environmental impacts (Costa et al., 2017). In this sense, expansion plans of wind power sector has overlapped the areas considered of high importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Caatinga (Neri et al., 2019). In addition, the establishment of several wind farms in Boqueirão da Onça resulted in the exponential increase of new roads and other accesses in areas previously considered remote (Dias et al., 2019). These new accesses have benefited poachers, who can travel ever higher distances by motor vehicles. As observed elsewhere, vehicles continued use associated with trained dogs and firearms has increased pressure on wildlife populations and, consequently, concerns about species conservation (Barboza et al., 2016).\n\nWe did not identify the influence of distance to water holes on the distribution of poaching. We believe that this result may be related to the hunting technique used in our study area. In Boqueirão da Onça, as in other locations in the Caatinga, poachers generally use active search with the cooperation of trained dogs, especially to hunt mammals (Alves, 2009; Dias et al., 2019). Ambush hunting near water holes is most often carried out with the aim of catching birds (Alves, 2009). Thus, the distribution of poaching aimed at mammals does not seem to depend on the water availability.\n\nOur results indicated that frequency of game species was the only covariate that positively influenced poachers' occupancy probability in Boqueirão da Onça. This positive effect of frequency of game species in poachers' occupancy, suggests that the distribution of poaching is higher in areas of greatest abundance of game species. As noted by Ferreguetti et al. (2018), poachers prefer areas where they know that some preferred mammal species are found more often, thereby increasing the cost-effectiveness of poaching expeditions. This also reflects the influence of habitat type, as more preserved environments harbor high mammal diversity and abundance, including endangered species (Barboza et al., 2016). It is important to consider that the game species evaluated in this study are widely poached throughout the Caatinga domain, highlighting the preference for this group of mammals by poachers in this region of Brazil (Alves et al., 2016). Mammalian poaching in Caatinga has already proved unsustainable, as local extinctions and population declines of Mazama gouazoubira, Pecari tajacu and Tolypeutes tricinctus have been documented (Alves et al., 2016; Barboza et al., 2016). Not surprisingly, these game species are classified at some level of concern for conservation, especially in the state of Bahia (Campos et al., 2019). Contrary to our expectations, poachers' detection probability was negatively affected by the frequency of prey species. Although most occupied sites by poachers are those with the greatest frequency of game species, the intensity of use of these sites by poachers did not follow this pattern. This result indicates that the poaching pressure in Boqueirão da Onça is not homogeneous, it concentrates in some specific locations forming the most intense poaching hotspots.\n\nOur spatial analysis corroborates this effect, indicating three critical areas, two in Boqueirão da Onça NP in the Gameleira do Nosinho farm area and one in the outer edge of the protected area, in an area close to the Gameleira do Bento farm. These findings may be related to the proximity to the headquarters of these farms. In southeastern Brazil, poaching intensity is related to proximity to human settlements, which favors access to natural habitats (Ferreguetti et al., 2018). During our fieldwork, we obtained various evidence of poaching in all areas visited, most often being observed on the Gameleira do Nosinho and Gameleira do Bento farms. In these farms we observed wild animal carcasses, hunting dogs, firearm sounds and the presence of the poachers themselves, who usually gather in these places on weekends, from where they depart for poaching in the native vegetation. It is notable that both game species abundance and accessibility are attractive to poachers, which increases poaching pressure on wild species (Wilkie et al., 2000; Ferreguetti et al., 2018).\n\nIn Brazil hunting is prohibited by law (Federal Law 9605/1998) and is only allowed on a subsistence basis in indigenous lands and extremely poor rural areas. However, while poverty is a motivator for hunting in rural communities, this activity transcends socioeconomic needs (Bell et al., 2007). In the past two decades, for example, large federally funded social programs were introduced in Brazil, with the aim of reducing poverty (Bragagnolo et al., 2019). In addition, studies show that poachers spend resources on poaching expeditions, including fuel for vehicles, weapons, and ammunition, which invalidates the argument of the need to hunt for food (El Bizri et al., 2015; Barboza et al., 2016). Thus, poaching in Caatinga is more a matter of leisure and taste for wild meat than a food necessity (Barboza et al., 2016). However, with the emergence and worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic in the world, there is a fear of an increase in poaching in rural communities (Briggs, 2020). The relationship stems from the economic impact and loss of income of societies in the face of the pandemic (McKibbin and Fernando, 2020). This is very worrying, especially in regions with a low human development index (HDI) such as the municipalities that make up Boqueirão da Onça, who's average HDI is 0.59 (IBGE, 2010). In this sense, with the imminence of increased pressure from poaching on legally protected species in times of global economic crisis, becomes an even greater challenge to curb criminal practices against wildlife.\n\nIt is also important to note that the impunity feeling motivates many people to practice poaching in Brazil. In part, because law enforcement in many regions is irregular, infrequent, or even non-existent due to lack of human and financial resources (Castilho et al., 2017). The inefficiency of Brazilian environmental surveillance agencies is further compounded by the planning of protected areas. At the landscape level, poorly planned reserves may include, among other factors, a biased outline of the original boundaries, where crucial habitats are left unprotected (Peres and Lake, 2003). An example of this is the mosaic of protected areas of Boqueirão da Onça, where the proposal to create the National Park lasted 16 years. Successive changes due to different land use and occupation interests in the region culminated in the creation of a mosaic of different types of protected areas, with a reduction of >50% in the area of the National Park, originally proposed (Campos et al., 2019). In addition, Brazilian law provides that private areas within the boundaries of National Parks will be expropriated (Brasil, 2006). Unfortunately, these expropriation processes take many years to complete, while impacts continue to occur within the reserves as noted in Boqueirão da Onça. Thus, reducing poaching in protected areas in Brazil is challenging and complex, requiring an integrated approach focused on mapping the most critical areas that depend on more conservation efforts.\n\nPoaching is an activity strongly rooted in the Brazilian semi-arid region, and this relationship between humans and biological resources is strongly linked to cultural and socioeconomic conditions (Silva et al., 2019). Several ethno-zoological studies have outlined an overview of hunting techniques used in the Caatinga, as well as the preferred species and main uses (Bragagnolo et al., 2019; Chaves et al., 2020). In this way, the knowledge about the behavior of poachers combined with the results that we present here, can help in understanding about the impacts of poaching on wildlife. Our study has shown that poaching occurs within and around the mosaic of protected areas of Boqueirão da Onça, northern Bahia. We provide here an assessment of the spatial patterns of poaching in relation to different landscape elements and biotic influences, allowing clear predictions of where poaching hotspots occur in the landscape and where enforcement efforts should be focused. Hotspots are clearly concentrated inland and on the edge of Boqueirão da Onça NP and are associated with roads and some farms. To achieve conservation objectives, we suggest that environmental agencies and Boqueirão da Onça managers should limit road expansion and expropriate settlements within the National Park. Patrols must also be carried out at the borders of protected areas to combat not only hunting but also deforestation and burning. However, the current scenario is daunting, as Brazilian environmental policy has suffered serial setbacks. State environmental agencies have been delegitimized and their actions limited by the federal government itself. Additionally, a law project is been debated in the Brazilian Congress (PL 6268/2016) aimed at repealing the fauna protection law (Law No. 5.197, 1967), thus allowing hunting and killing of wild animals in the national territory, if approved by congresspeople. Given this bleak panorama, it has never been so urgent to do conservation in Brazil."
