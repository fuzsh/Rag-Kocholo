We regularly provide free food, shelter, clothing, blankets, and medical treatment to orphans, the elderly, poor, or sick. We also financially assist patients in hardship.\n\nCommunity support to serve humanity\n\nEach Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra retreat center operates on a charitable basis, embodying service to humanity by offering free accommodation, food, and medical services, to people in need. We organize charitable social service programs that distribute basic needs to families in low-income neighborhood areas.\n\nDisaster relief programs\n\nIn response to natural calamities, our centers mobilize our volunteers to proactively respond and serve by preparing, packaging and distributing cooked food, rations and relief material to the sufferers. We also provide building material to help those who cannot afford to rebuild their homes.\n\nFree well being programs\n\nWe offer free programs guided by unity in diversity, service to humanity, compassion for all, a natural lifestyle, and devotion to the omnipresent God pervading all. These are the cornerstones of Sant Baljit Singh Ji’s teachings. Our Sunday programs include an inspirational discourse (satsang) to raise spiritual awareness.\n\nFree devotional celebrations\n\nWe organize events during devotional festivals and other occasions as a free service to those who wish to come together to celebrate these festivals in grandeur, but may not be able to afford the associated costs. These events also offer free food, accommodation, and medical services, around the clock.\n\nCHARITY PROJECTS\n\nActions that make a difference\n\nWhen we serve humanity, we serve anyone and everyone.\n\nSant Baljit Singh Ji\n\nRecent charitable activities\n\nVishav Manav Ruhani Kendra conducts multiple charitable programs to serve humanity. Our teams of volunteers work closely with local authorities to provide asssitance and relief to those in dire circumstances. We donate supplies and equipment to schools and hospitals to support their service to humanity.\n\nPilgrimage services\n\nIn 2014, Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra launched its program to serve pilgrims who undertake the annual Kanwar Yatra pilgrimage throughout the month of Sawan. In 2022, Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra extended its pilgrimage services to support pilgrims participating in the Shri Amarnath Ji Yatra.\n\nCovid-19 response\n\nIn March 2020, Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra started its Covid-19 charitable response. Sant Baljit Singh Ji said: “People need help. We have to go out there and help, and do it responsibly.” Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra rallied with zest and zeal to help people in need, and donate medical supplies to hospitals.\n\nDEVOTION TO THE OMNIPRESENT GOD PERVADING ALL\n\nEvents\n\nLife is like a festival, meant for rejoicing. Your supreme reality is that you are a soul. Eternal bliss is your truth. You are all-consciousness, an image of unending peace.\n\nSant Baljit Singh Ji\n\nSpiritual Discourses (Satsangs)\n\nOn special occasions, Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra hosts events that feature a spiritual discourse by Sant Baljit Singh Ji. Often, the events offer the opportunity to learn the meditation on the inner Light and Sound.\n\nThe events are guided by Sant Baljit Singh Ji’s teachings of unity in diversity, service to humanity, compassion for all, a natural lifestyle, and devotion to the omnipresent God pervading all. These teachings inspire accompanying charitable activities to serve the event attendees and surrounding communities. The activities include medical camps, blood donation camps, and distributing educational material to underprivileged students.\n\nNavratri\n\nThe Navratri festival, usually held for nine days, celebrates Goddess Durga and her nine divine forms: Shailaputri Maa, Brahmacharini Maa, Chandraghanta Maa, Kushmanda Maa, Skandmata Maa, Katyayani Maa, Kalratri Maa, Mahagauri Maa, and Sidhidatri Maa. Each day of the festival is associated with one form of Goddess Durga. A sacred text—the Devi Mahatmya (The Glory of the Goddess)—explains the extraordinary virtues and greatness of each form and is read as a reminder about them.\n\nThe spring and autumn Navratri Festivals are celebrated each year at Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra, Nawan Nagar, India.\n\nGuru Purnima\n\nThe word Guru is a union of the Sanskrit words gu and ru wherein gu means darkness and ru means light. A Guru gives the light of knowledge to the disciples to dispel their darkness of ignorance. Guru Purnima celebrates the significance of the guru-disciple relationship. On this auspicious day, disciples express their gratitude towards their spiritual teacher.\n\nGuru Purnima is celebrated on the full-moon day in the Hindu calendar month of Ashada (June-July of the Gregorian calendar). Vishav Manav Ruhani Kendra celebrates Guru Purnima to express gratitude to Sant Baljit Singh Ji.\n\nSawan Month\n\nThe auspicious month of Sawan or Shravan is dedicated to Lord Shiva, the supreme being. He has the role of protecting, transforming, creating, and recreating the material universe. In his highest form, Lord Shiva is timeless and absolute reality, without form or limits. He represents the primal soul, atman, and the value of meditation, devotion, and self-discipline.\n\nIn recognition of Lord Shiva at this time of year, millions of people (Kawariyas) traditionally go on religious pilgrimages, bathe in sacred rivers, and make resolutions to demonstrate their love and devotion for the Divine."
