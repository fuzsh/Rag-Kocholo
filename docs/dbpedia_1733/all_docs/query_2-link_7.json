        "text": "Mandhana\n\nMandhana village lies in the Morni hills of Panchkula district in Haryana. It is located 25 km from the district headquarters at Panchkula. The terrain is hilly and scenic. The population of the village is about 1800, comprising mainly Chowdharys, Brahmans, and Harijans. The Chowdharys practice agriculture. The Brahmans have traditionally been priests but also practice agriculture. The Harijans typically engage in manual labor.\n\nThe primary occupation is agriculture; there is also some wage labor involving loading stones in the Ghaggar River that passes through the village. The main sources of water in the village are tutis (public taps), bawdis (springs), and johads (village ponds). Each of the 7 baas (settlement areas) in the village has 1 bawdi and 1 johad.\n\nWater remains a priority need in the village (Table 1). There is no steady source of irrigation. Some low-lying land along the Ghaggar River receives irrigation during the rainy months. There is also a dam under the JFM project. However, the delivery pipe is not aligned correctly to the fields. This fails to bring water to the fields (personal communication, JFM team; cross-checked in village discussions). Only some land around Bharal, a small settlement in the village where the dam is located, is irrigated by the dam. The rest of the farmland is rainfed. There is little marketable surplus; agricultural production is mainly for subsistence.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nPrioritizing of problems in Mandhana village.\n\nSeveral developments have improved the availability of water in the village, as inferred from the village timeline. The first tap providing piped water came to the village in 1972. In 1975, the first electricity connection was introduced. From 1975 to 1976, a tube well was installed to pump water from the nallah (drain). A second tube well was constructed in 1992, increasing local pumping capacity. The creation of yet another tube well between 1995 and 1996 meant that water could now be pumped to Jakhri, a small settlement at an elevation.\n\nIn the past, women collected water from the bawdis, or springs, located at a steep elevation in the hills. These were located 3–5 km from the settlement area. Bringing sources of water closer to homes through the public taps (tutis) has reduced the drudgery women endure walking long distances over steep terrain to collect water from the bawdis. As 1 respondent said, “Earlier the whole day would go simply in getting water.… We are then better off than the previous generation.… Our future generations will be better off still.” Moving the water sources closer also reduced physical discomforts related to collecting water: “I [used to] have a shooting pain radiating from my neck down to my hip—now I no longer need to confront that” was a typical comment made by a respondent in field interviews. Nevertheless, even with a source of water located closer to home, women still usually spend the first 2 to 3 hours of their day collecting water from public taps, as revealed by time budget exercises and direct observation of the water-collection activity.\n\nThough the women now walk shorter distances to collect water and must no longer negotiate steep terrain to reach the bawdis, the volume of water they carry home has increased. This is because several activities that were previously performed at traditional, public water sources—such as bawdis and johads—are now performed at home, and water must be carried home for these relocated activities. Earlier, men would regularly bathe at the bawdi. They would also occasionally bathe at the johad. Today, they do so rarely. Now that sources of piped water are available closer to home, bathing activities are increasingly performed at home. As a result, women are expected to carry water home for these purposes. In addition, the timing of water collection coincides with that of other crucial household chores, especially getting children ready for school. This caused frustration among the women interviewed.\n\nBased on the interviews, men did not appear to appreciate the effort involved in water collection, and they frequently sought to legitimize their claims to the new water. Typical responses included: “Now there is no problem getting water.… Earlier they had to walk steep slopes.… Now it is a short walk away, and all this is time to socialize.… Why should we not bathe in our homes now?” In addition, commenting on their daughters-in-law, the older generation of women made observations such as, “We have seen drudgery in water collection.… Their life is easy.” Many men echoed this sentiment as well: “Hard times were seen by my mother.… These ladies only sit and gossip.”\n\nSome men also refrained from helping their spouses with the tasks of water collection because their parents or elderly male relatives perceived this as compromising their masculinity. However, this appeared to be less pronounced among lower-caste households. In the latter households, the gender-based division of labor related to water collection was more fluid and norms of masculinity and femininity were less rigid. Nevertheless, women's workloads related to water collection increased across all households, regardless of caste.\n\nAnother important factor contributing to women's increasing water burdens has been the decline of the institution of the johad. A johad is a pond that stores rainwater. Because of the deterioration of institutions supporting the use of the johads, many functions performed at these water sources are now performed at home, and additional water must be carried home for these purposes. Earlier, when villagers' houses were kutcha (made of mud), women would desilt the johads and take the mud for their homes. Thus, there was an integrated mechanism for maintaining them. Today, pucka (concrete) houses have replaced kutcha houses, and the practices of desilting and maintaining johads have died out. In the past, urinating in the johads was prohibited, and the word of the elderly was sacrosanct on such matters. Strong norms prohibited contamination of the johads. With the arrival of piped water supplies, people's interest in maintaining the johads waned. Men have also become more conscious about hygiene; because the johads are a source of water for livestock, and often contaminated, men now refuse to bathe in them. One of the johads observed is now used to collect village wastewater. Taken together, these factors have increased the volume of water women must carry home.\n\nDhamala\n\nDhamala is a village in Kalka tehsil (District) of Panchkula district in Haryana, at the foothills of the Shivaliks. It is situated 12 km from the district headquarters at Panchkula. It has a population of about 900, comprising mainly Jats, Brahmins, and Harijans. The Jats are agriculturists and dominate the village by sheer number, socially, and in terms of land ownership. The Brahmins have traditionally been the priests, but some also practice agriculture and work in the government.\n\nDrinking water is more easily accessible in the village now compared with a decade ago. Hand pumps have been installed that serve virtually all households. A water connection typically serves 5 or 6 households; some serve even more. However, certain wealthier households (eg Jat) have a private household tap. Female respondents in these households spoke of substantial time savings because of recent water supply interventions. In the past, they typically made five 10-minute trips per day to collect water, so women in these households now spend about 1 hour less per day on water collection. Most female respondents described using the saved time for leisure.\n\nFor some households, however, the drinking water situation has worsened despite the introduction of drinking water sources (hand pumps) closer to home. Their water supply only lasts about 1 hour every day, forcing them to forgo certain water needs. Furthermore, as in Mandhana, the men in Dhamala no longer bathe at a common water source and now expect water to be brought home for bathing.\n\nSeveral women in Dhamala felt that their earlier situation was better. They spoke of frequent clashes and fights in the present context. In times of water scarcity or when supplies break down, lower-caste women must typically accept unmet water needs. Across households, women were found to compromise their own water needs related to hygiene and sanitation while making sure that scarce water could be used by men and the elderly.\n\nOne important observation that emerged in this village was that women belonging to the upper castes were the main beneficiaries of the water interventions. Such women had private taps installed in their households. For other women who had to use shared water standposts, the results were increased conflicts because of erratic, insufficient water supplies. Even though these women no longer had to walk long distances to collect water, they now confronted conflicts over shared standposts. According to 1 respondent: “Earlier there was a spirit of cohesion when we walked together to fetch water from the springs, now there is competition in taking water from the standposts.”\n\nLower-caste women also faced other forms of discrimination when accessing water; they were often expected to give priority to upper-caste women, especially in times of scarcity or when water supplies broke down. In the event of irregularities or breakdowns in water supplies, women commonly used their social capital—social relationships and networks—to meet their needs (Putnam 1993; McKenzie and Harpham 2006; McKenzie 2008). For example, when the supply of water at a public tap was erratic, some women were able to fetch water at a private tube well based on their social relations. However, in times of extreme water scarcity, they were often denied access to such private wells.\n\nWomen in different life stages also experienced the impacts differently. Newly married women, for instance, perceived more intrinsic value in water-collection activities. For them, the act of collectively going to the standposts to fetch water provided an opportunity to socialize and escape the confines of the household.\n\nAnother important insight that emerged from direct observation of water collection was that much of women's time was spent waiting in a queue at the standpost. Thus, one way of reducing time spent would be to increase the number of outlets. Another portion of the time was taken up by socializing en route. Hence, it is valuable to deconstruct the components of time spent collecting water.\n\nTo summarize, though women walked longer distances and negotiated steep slopes to carry water before the water supply interventions, following the interventions they were expected to collect and carry larger volumes of water. This was because several functions performed at common property water sources were moved to the home and because common property water sources deteriorated. Men perceived themselves as having a legitimate right to the newly supplied water but viewed sharing in water-collection tasks as compromising their masculinity. Negative effects were more pronounced among lower-caste women who had to share water from standposts, while upper-caste women often had exclusive private taps."
