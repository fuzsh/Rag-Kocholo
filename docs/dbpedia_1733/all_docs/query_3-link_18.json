        "text": "#newdaynewchapter From the arrival of Narendranath to his ultimate transformation as Swami Vivekananda on the world stage, the doctrine of the harmony of religions and the subsequent flowering of the Ramakrishna Math & Mission into the forefront of the world’s spiritual and philanthropic landscape are all rooted in the Dakshinehshwar Kali Temple. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa is considered as an incarnation of God and he practiced the different religious beliefs like Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Vedantism, and Tantrikism. Apart from the main Kali temple, visitors to the temple also make it a point to visit the hallowed dwelling chamber of Sri Ramakrishna located to the northwestern side of the temple premises in close proximity to the last of the Shiva temples. In this chamber, there are two beds used by Sri Ramakrishna where his photographic images are installed and ritual pujas are performed every day by the temple priest. A glass enclosure separates Sri Ramakrishna’s beds from the visitors. In the evening, in time for the all-important Aarati, a Hookah pipe is attached to Sri Ramakrishna’s image and doesn’t he seem to be in a trance piping that Hookah? Such is the fervor of the devotees that they believe, the ‘Master’ is very much present in not only his chamber but everywhere else around the temple. There are authentic reports of numerous devotees who have been blessed with his divine presence at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. There is a popular belief that every month during “Amabaishya” evening if one sits on the steps of the bathing ghat opposite to the main temple, one is likely to hear the footsteps of the ‘Master’ as he rises from the holy river the Ganges and walks all the way to the main temple wearing only his loincloth and “Kharam” or wooden slippers. The main temple is conspicuous by a magnificent “Natmandir”, or music hall, which is well supported by regally done up pillars. To the northwest and southwest parts of the temple premises, there are two “Nahabats” or music towers. The elaborate planning of the temple premises with its paved courtyard has a number of rooms exclusively meant for use by the staff and guests of the temple. Of special importance is the orchard to the north of the temple premises where the “Panchavati” consisting of the Banyan tree and the Bel tree, associated integrally with Sri Ramakrishna's spiritual practices where he would sit in meditation for hours together. Presently the entire Panchavati area and its surroundings have been remodeled with an ethnically designed hut, the kind found mostly in the villages of Kamarpukur and Jayrambati where Sri Ramakrishna and his holy consort Sri Sarada Devi belonged. Apart from the Panchavati, the dwelling place of Sri Sarada Devi “Nahabat” which is a double storied edifice has been remodeled by architects and restored to its former glory. On the ground floor, the image of the Holy Mother is ritually worshipped every day by the temple’s priest. Jay Ma Kali"
