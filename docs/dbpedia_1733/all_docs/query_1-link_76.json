        "text": "Train journeys are the best. Imagine being on a train while everything else is covered in snow! Sounds heavenly, right?\n\nWell, here's a visual for you to make it even more real. A short clip posted on Twitter shows a train stopped at a railway station. The entire area around it is covered in snow, and passengers are clicking pictures and recording videos of the same.\n\nThe clip was posted on the microblogging website by the Ministry of Railways with the caption, 'Spellbinding! Taradevi Station of Shimla-Kalka heritage route covered in a blanket of snow is a sight to behold'.\n\nThe train was halted at the Taradevi Station in Himachal Pradesh while on the Shimla-Kalka heritage route. It looked almost like a scene out of a fairytale.\n\nThe 20-second clip has been viewed over 20,000 times and liked almost a thousand times. People took to the comments section to express how delighted they were to be blessed with the video.\n\nOne user wrote, 'BLISSFUL TO WATCH,' while another commented, 'IT IS REALLY FANTASTIC, AMAZING AND AWESOME SIR'.
