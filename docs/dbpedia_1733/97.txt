ALEXANDER TIP OF THE DAY Are you holding your abs inbecause of tension or in an effort to look thinner? Begin by pausing. Until you know where you currently are, you won't be able to let go of unnecessary tension. Going through the steps in the graphic will help you let go of what you don't need. ✅ If you undo tension in your neck, your head will naturally nod, dropping your nose slightly. ✅ This allows your spine to lengthen, which naturally drops the pelvis, releasing excess tension in the lower back. ✅ Being in balance will naturally engage you abdominal muscles so that they support your lengthening spine and provide new opportunities for movement.

Clara Barton (1821-1912) was known as the “Angel of the Battlefield” during the Civil War. From 1861-1868, Barton ran the Missing Soldiers Office, where she employed 12 clerks and received over 60,000 letters from families searching for their loved ones. ✍🏽 She created a roll of missing men which she updated 5 times. Over the course of 8 years, Barton and her team sent out 100,000 copies. The Missing Soldiers Office answered over 41,000 letters and helped locate more than 22,000 missing soldiers. 👏 Clara Barton worked tirelessly from the start of the Civil War and then in the Missing Soldiers Office until she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered her to rest. 🚢 She went to Europe to do just that, but shortly after arriving, she met members of the International Red Cross. She joined their volunteer efforts on the battlefield of the Franco-Prussian War. When she returned home, she lobbied for the foundation of the American chapter of the Red Cross and served as its first president in 1881. Thank you, Clara Barton, for your lifetime of service to the health of our nation and for the systems you created that still serve us to this day. 🫶 #stephaniekalka #onlinebusinessmanagement #BusinessOrganization #EfficiencyTips
