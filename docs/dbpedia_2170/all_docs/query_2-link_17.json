Childhood and adolescent mental disorders often remit, but they often transform into other types of psychopathology and remain significant predictors of health through the life course. The early manifestations of psychopathology offer an opportunity for interventions at a stage when human development is malleable. Early identification of risk in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood is a step towards targeted prevention. In this talk, I will review the interplay of genetic and environmental risks in developmental psychopathology, early identification of risk and prevention with special reference to the interface between eating disorders and other types of mental and physical illness. Pharmacological Studies In Eating Disorders: A Historical Review\n\nYael D. Lewis1,2, Lukas Bergner3, Holger Steinberg 3, Jessica Bentley4, Hubertus Himmerich 4,5\n\n1Hadarim Eating Disorders Unit, Shalvata Mental Health , Hod Hasharon, Israel, 2Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, 3Forschungsstelle fÃ¼r die Geschichte der Psychiatrie, Klinik und Poliklinik Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Medizinische FakultÃ¤t der UniversitÃ¤t Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany, 4Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Kingâs College London, London, United Kingdom, 5South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London , London, United Kingdom\n\nPsychopharmacological medication is an important component in the treatment of eating disorders (EDs). We performed a historic analysis of pharmacotherapeutic research in EDs based on the scientific studies included in the recently published World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry guidelines for ED treatment. The analysis focuses on early approaches and trends in the methods of clinical pharmacological research in EDs, from early case studies in treatment of anorexia nervosa, to later usage of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) model in the major disorders including bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. We found the development of psychopharmacological treatments for EDs followed advancements in general psychiatric pharmacotherapy, with predominant medication groups examined in EDs including antidepressants and antipsychotics of earlier and later generations. The overall scale of studies in EDs is relatively small with total number of participants in all ED trials reviewed standing roughly at 10,000. While many trials address outcomes beyond the key disorder-specific ED symptoms, the RCT model focuses on a single outcome, with limited evaluation of the complex nature of EDs. Difficulty in recruitment and limited funding hinder research progress. Our findings point to the need for novel, biologically based treatments, with a more comprehensive understanding of EDs and individualised approaches to guide research and drug development for improved treatment outcomes. Pharmacotherapy Of Bulimia Nervosa And Binge Eating Disorder\n\nSusan L McElroy\n\nLindner Center of HOPE, Mason, OH, United States\n\nThis talk reviews progress in pharmacological options for the treatment of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). Only two drugs have regulatory approval for either condition at this time—fluoxetine for BN and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for BED. The data for these regulatory approvals will be briefly reviewed. Then, available data for antidepressants, ADHD drugs, antiepileptics, and weight loss, many of which may have some efficacy in BN or BED, will be reviewed. Drugs presently under study (solriamfetol) and those probably without efficacy (naltrexone, samidorphan, and nivasorexant) will then be reviewed. Future areas for research in the pharmacotherapy of BN and BED will be suggested. Importantly, until drugs are developed specifically for eating disorders, drugs developed for other conditions that are centrally acting and associated with beneficial psychotropic effects and/or reduced appetite or weight loss might be considered for repurposing in BN and BED. Associations Between General Psychopathology And Binge Eating Episodes In The General Population Of Rio De Janeiro\n\nCarlos E. Moraes1,3, Jose C. Appolinario1, Rosely Sichieri2, Phillipa Hay3\n\n1Obesity and Eating Disorders Group, Institute of Psychiatry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 22. Social Medicine Institute, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 33. Translational Health Research Institute, School of Medicine, Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia\n\nThe present study investigated the associations between psychiatric comorbidities and binge eating episodes (BEE) in a representative sample of the general population of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Participants comprised 2,297 randomly selected adults aged 18 to 60 years. The Questionnaire of Eating and Weight Patterns 5 was used to assess the occurrence of recurrent objective binge eating episodes (OBE), subjective binge eating episodes (SBE), and both forms (OSBE). Psychiatric comorbidities were assessed through validated instruments. Logistic regression was used to investigate the associations between the variables. The prevalence of OBE, SBE, and OSBE was 4%, 6.5%, and 2.2%, respectively. Individuals with BEE exhibited higher odds ratio of having symptoms of depression [OBE: 9.1 (95%CI, 5.0-16.7); SBE: 5.3 (95%CI, 3.3-8.7); OSBE: 19.9 (95%CI, 8.3-47.6)], anxiety [OBE: 7.6 (95%CI, 4.1-14.4); SBE: 5.5 (95%CI, 2.8-10.5); OSBE: 14.0 (95%CI, 5.1-38.9)], ADHD [OBE: 7.7 (95%CI, 3.4-14.2); SBE: 3.5 (95%CI, 1.6-7.6); OSBE: 31.2 (95%CI, 17.1-57.0)] and alcohol use disorder [OBE: 2.8 (95%CI, 1.3-6,2); SBE: 5.6 (95%CI, 2.9-11.0); OSBE: 5.0 (95%CI, 2.1-11.5)]. In conclusion, there is a continuum of severity among BEE. The OSBE group displayed the greater association with psychiatric comorbidities, followed by those with OBE, and individuals with SBE. The Bodily Intolerance Of Uncertainty Scale: The Conceptualization, Development, And Psychometric Evaluation Of A New Construct\n\nJojanneke Bijsterbosch1, Paul Boelen1,2,3, Anouk Keizer1, Dave Hessen1, Annemarie van Elburg1,4, Lot Sternheim1\n\n1Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands, 2ARQ National Psychotrauma Centre, Diemen, Netherlands, 3ARQ Centrumâ45, Diemen, Netherlands, 4Co-eur, Utrecht, Netherlands\n\nA growing body of literature supports intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as underlying and as exacerbating symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN). Though research predominantly conceptualizes IU as a dispositional trait, some studies suggest that the situational context contributes to the salience of uncertain stimuli (e.g., body image disturbances). An AN-specific scale for IU, specifically focused on symptoms of a disturbed body image, has not yet been developed. This study targets to capture the nature of the association between body image and intolerance of uncertainty and bring them together in a new construct: bodily intolerance of uncertainty, defined as the overwhelming and intolerable feeling triggered by uncertainty related to (potential changes of) one’s body and which is experienced within the body. The present study involves the development and the initial psychometric evaluation of a fully structured measure of the bodily intolerance of uncertainty construct: the Bodily Intolerance of Uncertainty Questionnaire (BIUQ). The BIUQ was tested in 7 independent samples including adolescent girls with and without AN, adult men and women, in a Dutch and an English version. A one factor structure was confirmed by a multi group confirmative factor analysis, demonstrating an excellent fit. Furthermore, across studies, internal consistency and construct validity was supported. The BIUQ is a psychometrically sound to assess the intolerance for body-related uncertainty in research and clinical settings. Atypical Anorexia Nervosa After Bariatric Surgery: The Clinical Significance Of &Ldquo;Significant Weight Loss&Rdquo; And &Ldquo;Significantly Low Weight&Rdquo;\n\nEva ConceiÃ§Ã£o1, Ricarda Schmidt2, Ben Schreglmann2, Thomas Mansfeld3, Johannes Sander4, Florian Seyfried5, Stefan Kaiser6, Christine Stroh7, Arne Dietrich8, Anja Hilbert2\n\n1Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal, 2University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany, 3Asklepios Clinic, Hamburg, Germany, 4SchÃ¶n Klinik Hamburg Eilbek , Hamburg, Germany, 5University Hospital WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, 6Hospital Konstanz, , Konstanz, Germany, 7Municipal Hospital Gera , Gera, Germany, 8University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany\n\nObjectives: To investigate the clinical significance of “significant weight loss” and “significantly low weight”, DSM-5 criterion A of (atypical) anorexia nervosa (AAN) in patients after bariatric surgery (BS). Specifically, we compared patients with AAN meeting criteria B (fear of gaining weight) and C (undue influence of shape and weight) with those without AAN-BC criteria on % total weight loss (%TWL), % alterable weight loss (%AWL), body mass index (BMI). Methods: N=729 patients of the prospective, multicenter Psychosocial Registry of Bariatric Surgery, were assessed 1 year after BS. Assessment included anthropometrics, the Eating Disorder Examination interview, and a set of self-report measures. Results: N=27 (3.7%) patients met B+C criteria (AAN-BC; 85.2% female; median age 48y.o). Patients with AAN-BC scored significantly higher on self-report measures assessing eating disorder psychopathology, health-related quality of life, and weight bias (e.g., EDEQ global score z=5.364, p<.001) than patients without AAN. EDE-Q (Mdn=2.8) and weight bias scores (Mdn=5.18) of patients with AAN-BC fell above the clinical cut-offs/norms. There were no significant differences in %TWL, %AWL, or BMI between patients with and without AAN-BC. Among AAN-BC, 3 (11.1%) had normal weight, 2 (7.4%) overweight, and 22 (81.4%) obesity. Conclusion: DSM-5 criteria B and C for AN capture a clinically significant condition in patients after BS that is not associated with BMI or weight loss. Understanding Food Addiction In Adolescents: Association With Eating Behaviors And Psychometric Properties Of The Dyfas-C 2.0\n\nAna Matos1, Silvia FÃ©lix1, Carol Coelho1, Eva ConceiÃ§Ã£o2, BÃ¡rbara Machado3, SÃ³nia GonÃ§alves1\n\n1Escola de Psicologia, Universidade do Minho, Braga, Portugal, 2Escola de Psicologia, Universidade do Minho, Braga, Portugal, 3Escola de Psicologia, Universidade do Minho, Braga, Portugal, 4Faculdade de Psicologia e CiÃªncias das EducaÃ§Ã£o, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal, 5Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa, Porto, Portugal, 6Escola de Psicologia, Braga, Portugal\n\nThe dimensional Yale Food Addiction Scale for Children 2.0 (dYFAS-C 2.0) was developed to provide an adequate psychometric measure to assess food addiction in adolescents, in accordance with the updated addiction criteria proposed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSMâ5). The present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the dYFAS-C 2.0 among Portuguese adolescents and to explore relations between food addiction and other eating behaviors. One hundred and thirty-one adolescents aged between 10 and 15 years (M = 11.8, SD = 1.36) completed self-reported measures assessing food addiction, grazing eating behavior and intuitive eating. Weight and height were also collected. Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed an adequate fit for the original single-factor model (χ² (104) = 182; p <0.001; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.97; NFI = 0.94; SRMR = 0.101; RMSEA = 0.074; 95% IC [0.056; 0.091]). Convergent and divergent validity was found between food addiction and grazing and intuitive eating. No significant association was found between food addiction and BMI z-score or food addition and age. Results support the use of dYFAS-C 2.0 as a valid and reliable measure to assess food addiction in Portuguese adolescents. Future research with a larger sample may shed light on the association between food addiction and other variables, namely multi-impulsive behaviors in adolescence. The Clinical Impairment Assessment Does Not Adequately Capture Psychosocial Impairment In Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n\nP. Evelyna Kambanis1, Lilian Palmer1, Iman McPherson1, Haley Graver1, Elisa Asanza1, Lauren Shabazian1, Lauren Breithaupt1, Lazaro Zayas1, Kamryn Eddy1, Madushmita Misra1, Nadia Micali2, Laura Holsen1, Elizabeth Lawson1, Kyle De Young3, Kendra Becker1, Jennifer Thomas1\n\n1Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States, 2Mental Health Services of the Capital Region of Denmark, Ballerup, Denmark, 3University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, United States\n\nINTRODUCTION: Psychosocial impairment (PI) is a key diagnostic criterion for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), but its assessment is subjective. The Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) is the leading assessment of PI in eating disorders (EDs) but has not been validated in ARFID. In Study 1, we calculated the proportion of patients with ARFID whose clinically assessed PI would be correctly ascertained by the CIA (i.e., cut-off score > 16). In Study 2, we tested a modified CIA-ARFID with a new question stem that specifically referenced ARFID symptoms. METHOD: In Study 1, 179 patients with ARFID completed the CIA. In Study 2, 39 adults with ARFID completed both the CIA and CIA-ARFID. RESULTS: In Study 1, more than two thirds (69%) of patients who met criteria for ARFID by PI scored below the clinical cut-off on the CIA. In Study 2, the CIA-ARFID did not outperform the CIA (p = .999); of 28 participants who met diagnostic criteria for ARFID by PI, nearly two thirds still scored below the clinical cut-off on both the CIA (64%) and CIA-ARFID (61%). CONCLUSIONS: Neither the original CIA nor the modified CIA-ARFID adequately captured clinically ascertained PI in ARFID. It is possible that modifying the CIA stem question is insufficient because individual CIA items (e.g., feeling “guilty” or like “a failure”) are less pertinent to ARFID than other EDs. Given the centrality of PI to the diagnostic criteria, novel assessments of PI in ARFID are urgently needed. Further Validation Of The Multifaceted Instrument For Body Image Disturbance (Mi-Bod) Among Athletes\n\nDeborah Mitchison1, Katarina Prnjak1, Scott Fatt2, Emma George2, Nikki Jeacocke3, Phillipa Hay2\n\n1Graduate School of Health, Discipline of Clinical Psychology, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia, 2Translational Health Research Institute, School of Medicine, Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia, 3Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra, Australia\n\nThe recently developed Multifaceted Instrument for Body Image Disturbance (MI-BoD) assesses Body Dissatisfaction, Overvaluation, Preoccupation, Fear of Weight Gain, Body Checking and Body Exposure, and performs well psychometrically in symptomatic and asymptomatic samples. The aim of this study was to further validate the MI-BoD in a sample of elite athletes. Methods: 193 elite athletes (71% women; Mage[SDage] = 25.65[8.68]) completed an online survey. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit for the original model with 6 factors according to some fit indices (CFI = .975, SRMR = .033) but not others (RMSEA [95% CI] = .116 [.097–.137]). Spearman correlations between the MI-BoD subscales were moderate to strong (.64 to .86). Moreover, internal consistency was good for the total score (ω = .979) and subscale scores (ω: .889 – .956). Spearman correlations with other body image scales (convergent validity) ranged from .281 to .857 whereas correlations with non-body-image variables (divergent validity) ranged from .072 and .658. The MI-BoD total score and 6 subscale scores explained significant variance in eating disorder symptoms, above and beyond other body image scales. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that the MI-BoD has relatively good psychometric properties in athletes, yet high inter-factor correlations raise a question of the extent to which some body image facets can be distinguished from one another in this sample. Follow-Up Study Of Children And Adolescents With Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Compared With Anorexia Nervosa\n\nEduardo Serrano-Troncoso1, 2, Laura CaÃ±as-Vinader1, 2, Carolina Palma-Sevillano2\n\n1Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u, Barcelona, Spain, 2Universidad Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To compare follow-up outcomes between children and adolescents with ARFID and those with anorexia nervosa (AN) in regard to rates of recovery illness. Method: A longitudinal, naturalistic study was carried out analyzing clinical and sociodemographic variables from sixty-six patients (33 with ARFID and 33 with AN) who were consecutively followed-up after a mean of 2.5 years of treatment. Results: At follow-up, 13 (39.4%) patients with ARFID had a total remission, 16 (48.5%) continued with the current diagnosis, and 4 (12.1%) dropped out treatment. Regarding the AN group, 11 (33.3%) patients had a total remission, 7 (21.2%) had a partial remission, and 10 (30.3%) continued with an eating disorder (ED) diagnostic at follow-up. Four (12.1%) AN cases changed their diagnostic to bulimia nervosa, and 5 (15.2%) dropped out treatment during this time. These percentages differences were statistically significant in recovery rates (p=0.034) and changes in the ED diagnostic (p=0.039). There were a significant relation between time of treatment and remission in ARFID (p=0.006) and AN (p=0.003) patients. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with ARFID have a worst prognostic than those with AN after treatment. The ARFID diagnostic compared to AN show a higher symptomatic stability and similar dropouts after intervention. The time from the beginning of the treatment was related with a better outcome at follow up. Inconsistencies In The Eating Attitudes Test-26 (Eat-26): Findings From New Israeli Studies\n\nDaniel Stein1,2, Zohar Spivak-Lavi 3, Ora Peleg3, Orna Tzischinsky3, Yael Latzer4,5\n\n1Pediatric Psychiatry Division, Safra Children's Hospital Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, 2Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv, Israel, 3Max Stern Yezreel Valley College, Yezreel Valley, Israel, 4School of Social Work, Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel, 5Rambam Medical Center, Eating Disorders Institution, Haifa, Israel\n\nBackground: The Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) in the tool of choice to differentiate community samples with and without eating disorder (ED) symptoms, showing a classical three-factor structure. Nonetheless, studies in different cultures have found other non-three factor structures. Aim: To assess the consistency of the EAT in different Israeli populations Methods: First we assessed the EAT-26 in community Israeli Jews, Muslims, and Christians. Second, we compared the EAT-26 between community adolescents and adolescents hospitalized with EDs. In the third study we compared the EAT-26 between hospitalized adolescents with EDs at admission and discharge. Results 1. Different factors were found in the three ethnic groups, most not corresponding with the 3-factor-structure. 2. Both the clinical and community groups did not present with the 3-factor structure. A 19-item EAT version was more stable and suited to capture ED symptoms in both groups; a cutoff point of 22 best differentiated the clinical from the non-clinical sample. 3. The factor-structures of the EAT-26 at admission and discharge were different. A 15-item EAT version was more stable at both admission and discharge vs. the EAT-26 version. A cutoff score of 23 in the EAT-15 better defined patients improved at discharge vs. the original cutoff score of 20. Conclusions The three studies demonstrate inconsistencies of the EAT in different ethnic groups, clinical vs. community samples, and different illness stages. Self-Perception Of Eating Disorders In University Students With And Without Food Insecurity\n\nHoor Ul Ain1, Jaelin Isquith1, Kelsie/T Forbush2, Kara Christensen Pacella1\n\n1University of Nevada Las Vegas , Las Vegas, NV, United States, 2University of Kansas , Kansas, KS, United States\n\nIntroduction\n\nEating disorder stereotypes impact the mental health literacy and self-perception of having EDs. Inaccurate self-perception of EDs is a barrier for help seeking (Ali et al., 2020). People with food insecurity (FI) do not conform to the Skinny, White, Affluent Girl (SWAG) stereotype, but are at a higher risk of EDs than those without FI (Becker et al., 2017). Hence, it is possible that despite higher ED risk, individuals with FI may have less accurate perceptions of their eating behaviors (lower mental health literacy) and may not see them as indicative of EDs.\n\nMethods\n\nStudents (N = 938; Mage = 21.58, SD = 5.76) from two US public universities completed a screening of FI and a question assessing if they thought they had an ED. Responses from the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale and the Clinical Impairment Assessment were used to classify individuals as positive or negative for an ED. Sensitivity and specificity of self-perception of having an ED was computed by FI status. Chi-square tests assessed whether sensitivity and specificity of ED self-perception differed based on FI status.\n\nResults\n\nSensitivity and specificity of ED self-perception were not significantly different between the no FI (67.79%, 86.41%) and the FI (74.76%, 83.17%) groups (chi square ps>.39).\n\nConclusion\n\nStudents with FI had similar accuracy in their self-perception of EDs compared to students without FI. Results suggest that FI status is not a risk factor for misidentification of one's own ED symptoms.\n\nThe Association Between Eating Disorders, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ANd Schizophrenia Vulnerability Traits IN A Large Population-Based Youth Sample\n\nStefana Aicoboaie1,2, Helena L. Davies1,2, Bilal A. Ashraf1, Edoardo Pappaianni 1,3, Nadia Micali1,2,4\n\n1Center for Eating and feeding Disorders Research, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2Institute of Biological Psychiatry, Roskilde, Denmark, 3Danish Research Center for Magnetic Resonance, Hvidovre, Denmark, 4Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom\n\nMany symptoms and behaviours are shared between eating disorders (EDs) and other psychiatric conditions. Investigating phenotypic expressions in the general population can shed light on the developmental pathways relevant to both shared and unique psychiatric risk, with less confounding due to active psychiatric psychopathology. In a non-clinical, longitudinal sample of United States (US) youth aged 9 to 12 years (N=11305), we explored the association of psychopathology (particularly obsessive compulsive [OC] and psychotic symptoms), neurocognitive, and cortical brain markers with multiple outcomes including cognitive (fear of fatness) and behavioural (binge eating (BE) and weight control) ED symptoms. Lifetime OC symptoms was associated with increased odds of lifetime of fear of fatness (OR = 2.04, 95%CI = 1.82–2.28, p <.001), lifetime BE (OR=1.79, 95%CI= 1.59–2.01, p <.001) and lifetime weight control behaviours (OR=1.75, 95%CI=1.54-1.98, p <.001). Moreover, lifetime fear of fatness was significantly associated with lower cortical thickness (β= -0.008, t= -4.008, p <. 001) and reduced working memory performance (β= -2.367, t= -6.79 p <. 001). ED cognitions and behaviours were associated with psychopathology, particularly OC symptoms. Additionally, we replicated our previous findings from another US youth cohort showing an association between ED behaviours and altered brain characteristics. Further research is warranted to clarify risk pathways responsible for the reported associations. &Ldquo;I Might As Well Go All The Way&Rdquo;: Increased Subjective Costs Of Control-Related Effort After Eating In Bulimia Nervosa\n\nLaura A Berner1, Jiulin Dai1, Blair R. K. Shevlin1, Andrew Westbrook2, Thalia Viranda3, Maia Chester1\n\n1Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States, 2Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States, 3Cornell University (Cornell Tech), New York, NY, United States\n\nBecause exerting control is cognitively demanding, we must make cost-benefit decisions about whether even trying to exert control is worth the effort. These decisions may play a major role in bulimia nervosa (BN): After eating begins in binge episodes, individuals with BN endorse thinking, “Now that I have done it, I might as well go all the way.” Here, we tested whether starting to eat abnormally affects the subjective effort costs associated with cognitive control in BN. Women with and without BN (N=31) completed the Cognitive Effort Discounting task in two states: after a 16-h fast and after a standardized meal. The task assesses the discounting of cash offers to complete more demanding levels of an N-back. Steeper discounting indicates higher estimated effort costs. In a fed relative to fasted state, women with BN showed steeper effort discounting than healthy controls (HC; p=0.014). After eating, sensitivity to effort costs decreased in HC, but women with BN showed a persistently strong influence of the costs of cognitive effort on control-related decisions. Moreover, women with BN who more steeply discounted cognitive effort in a fed state reported more frequent binge eating (p=0.001). Results suggest that in BN, an altered effort-cost computation after eating starts may reduce willingness to expend effort on control and leave urges to continue eating unchecked. Interventions that decrease subjective effort costs, specifically after eating, may prove fruitful for BN. Patients With Eating Disorders Reporting History Childhood Trauma Showed Distinct A Different Pattern In Terms Of Microbiome And Microbiota Metabolites As Compared To Other Patients\n\nGiovanni Castellini1, Emanuele Cassioli1, Eleonora Rossi1, Valdo Ricca1, Carlotta De Filippo2\n\n1Psychiatry Unit, Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy, Firenze, Italy, 22National Research Council, Institute of Agricultural Biology and Biotechnology, Pisa, Italy, Pisa, Italy\n\nThe etiopathogenesis of Eating disorders (EDs) includes childhood traumatic experiences, and biological factors. The microbiome has been hypothesised to play a role, impacting on emotion regulation, through its metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This study investigated the interactions between psychopathology of EDs, the gut microbiome and SCFAs in patients with Anorexia Nervosa (n=30), Bulimia Nervosa (n=25), Binge Eating Disorder (n=15) and in 42 healthy controls (HCs). Patients were also evaluated for general (SCL-90) and EDs psychopathology (EDE-Q), and history of childood abuse (CTQ). The assessment was repeated at one year follow-up after enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy. Gut microbiota composition differences were found between subjects with EDs and HCs, and in association with pathological behaviors (binge eating vs restrictive). A mediation model showed that butyric acid significantly predicted higher levels of trait anxiety, which in turn was associated with EDE-Q scores; both mediators (butyric acid and anxiety) were associated with early trauma. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was performed to examine the evolution of SCFAs and EDs psychopathology across time. A possible interpretation for this model might be that childhood trauma represents a risk factor for gut dysbiosis and for a stable modification of mechanisms responsible for SCFAs production, and that this dysfunctional community is inherited in the passage from childhood to adulthood. The Role Of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis To Understand Binge Eating - A Systematic RevieW\n\nCatarina Gomes1,2, Alondra GonzÃ¡lez3, Diogo Prata1,2, Eduardo LÃ³pez-Caneda1,2, Clarisse Nobre4, Eva ConceiÃ§Ã£o5\n\n1Psychology Research Center, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, Braga, Portugal, 22School of Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, Braga, Portugal, 33CEB â Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, Braga, Portugal, 44LABBELS â Associate Laboratory, 4710-057 Braga, Campus de Gualtar, Portugal, Braga, Portugal, 55Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Porto , Porto, Portugal\n\nOBJECTIVES: This work reviews the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis to further comprehend loss of control (LOC) eating behaviors by assessing: 1) specific alterations in the gut microbiota (GM) composition; 2) the potential relationship between dysbiosis and brain functioning impairments and 3) the role of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in modulating the LOC eating. METHOD: PRISMA guidelines were followed using Scopus, WebScience, and EMBASE databases. The search equation included terms related to GM, LOC eating behavior, and potential modulators of the GM. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were selected. The results showed: 1) a set of bacteria mainly belonging to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes involved in leaky gut symptoms and inflammation; 2) leptin levels are negatively associated with Sutterella wadworthensis; 3) decrease in Bacteroides, Eubacterium, and Akkermansia muciniphila, and an increase in Megamonasassociated with the activity of reward areas and 4) increased weight loss and eating control linked to probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: LOC eating behaviors were associated with dysbioses that contribute to ‘leaky gut’ symptoms. Ultimately, gut dysbioses contribute to stimulating reward areas activity, which facilitates LOC eating. Restorage of the dysbiosis with probiotic, prebiotic and symbiotic supplementation seems to modulate gut-brain mechanisms, leading to increasedcontrol over eating. Behaviorally-Assessed Negative Urgency Is Uniquely Associated With Binge-Eating Frequency\n\nGlen Forester1,2, Joseph A. Wonderlich1,2, Angeline R. Bottera3, Elizabeth N.

However, negative urgency is typically assessed via self-report, which captures only some aspects of urgency and may be subject to bias. Few studies have examined impulsivity following experimental manipulations of affect in binge-eating samples. Methods: In the present study, individuals who engage in regular binge eating completed a behavioral impulsivity (go/no-go) task with high- and low-calorie food stimuli, once following negative affect induction and once following neutral affect induction. Results: Greater behavioral impulsivity to high-calorie food cues while in a negative (and not a neutral) affective state was associated with more frequent binge-eating behavior. Further, this behavioral measure of negative urgency uniquely accounted for variance in binge-eating frequency when controlling for self-reported negative urgency, suggesting that behavioral measures may be a useful complement to self-report measures. Conclusion: These findings provide novel and compelling evidence for the relationship between negative urgency and binge eating, highlighting negative urgency as a potentially important target for intervention. Efficacy Of Adjunct Olanzapine (Olz) Treament In Adolescents With Anorexia Nervosa: A Comparison Of Two Patient Cohorts\n\nHelene Krauss1, Andreas Karwautz1, Michael Zeiler1, Julia schwarzenberg1, Dunja Mairhofer1, Julia Philipp1, Gabriele SchÃ¶fbeck1, Hans Rock2, Hartmut Imgart3, Regina Taurines4, Stefanie Fekete4, Marcel Romanos4, Karin Egberts4, Manfred Gerlach4\n\n1KJP, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, 2CIO Marburg, Marburg , Germany, 3Parklandklinik, Bad Wildungen, Germany, 4KJP, UniversitÃ¤t WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany\n\nIntroduction: Antipsychotics, mostly OLZ has been used in several studies for AN treatment. This study assesses effectiveness of OLZ in enhancing weight gain and modifying symptomatology in adolescents with AN treated in a multidimensional inpatient setting at a specialized university-based facility. Methods: Ninety-four female adolescents in two patient cohorts: one cohort receiving OLZ treatment (OLZ group, N=47) and one cohort without any antipsychotic medication (non OLZ group, N=47). Measurements included weight gain, BMI, EDE and EDI scores, and serum markers. Results: The group receiving OLZ showed significantly higher weekly weight gain (0.90 kg vs. 0.68 kg; p = 0.004). There was no superiority of the OLZ group vs. the non OLZ group regarding improvements in eating disorder symptomatology. A significant increase in prolactin levels in the OLZ group compared to the non OLZ group was observed. (OLZ group: 81% above recommended reference range vs. 31.8% in the non OLZ group). Conclusions: OLZ can aid weight gain in AN but does not significantly improve overall eating disorder symptomatology. Monitoring prolactin levels is crucial due to significant elevations. White Matter Microstructural Changes In Adolescent Patients With Anorexia Nervosa: A Longitudinal Diffusion Tensor Imaging (Dti) Study\n\nLara Keller1,2, Lucia Hornig3, Florian Ph.S. Fischmeister4, Andreas Karwautz5, Beate Herpertz-Dahlmann3, Jochen Seitz2,3\n\n1Child Neuropsychology Section, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany, 2Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, LVR University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany, 3Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany, 4Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, 5Eating Disorders Unit at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria\n\nINTRODUCTION Numerous studies demonstrated brain volume reductions in anorexia nervosa (AN), however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers more detailed insight into white matter microstructure based on water molecule diffusivity. Previous DTI studies reported fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions, however, findings were mixed. The very few longitudinal studies suggest reversibility after weight recovery, though evidence is unclear, especially in adolescents. METHODS Our study, part of the ERA-NET NEURON project “MiGBAN”, aimed to longitudinally investigate white matter microstructure in adolescents with AN. 66 patients and 47 healthy controls aged 12-19 years from two sites were scanned three times (admission, 6- and 12-month follow-up). Data analysis is being performed using FSL, including tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) for group comparisons and associations with clinical parameters. RESULTS The data analysis will be completed within the next few months so that the results can be presented at EDRS 2024. We expect FA reductions in AN patients, possibly linked to clinical symptoms. Longitudinal data will assess reversibility post recovery and extend to 1 year follow-up for the first time in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS Understanding microstructural changes through DTI could shed light on AN brain pathophysiology linked to clinical symptoms, particularly important in adolescents, where results are still scarce and heterogeneous. Dynamic Reconfigurations Of Brain Subnetworks In Alcohol Use Disorder Or Bulimia Nervosa: A Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study\n\nNicolas Leenaerts1,2, Tommy Broeders3, Jenny Ceccarini1,4, Stefan Sunaert1,5, Menno Schoonheim3, Christiaan Vinkers6, Elske Vrieze1,2\n\n1KU Leuven, Leuven Brain Institute, Department of Neurosciences, Research Group Psychiatry, Leuven, Belgium, 2Mind-Body Research, Research Group Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 3MS Center Amsterdam, Anatomy & Neurosciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam UMC location VUmc, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 4KU Leuven, Leuven Brain Institute, Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Research Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging, Leuven, Belgium, 5Translational MRI, Department of Imaging and Pathology, Biomedical Sciences Group, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 6Psychiatry, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam UMC location VUmc, Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nIntroduction: The brain forms a complex functional brain network. This network is dynamically reconfigured to support various cognitive processes. Previous studies showed altered static network patterns in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) or bulimia nervosa (BN), but ignore network dynamics. This study investigates dynamic network reconfigurations in female patients with AUD or BN and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Resting-state functional MRI data were acquired of 102 female participants (AUD:27, BN:24, HC:51). A sliding-window approach assigned brain regions iteratively to one of seven literature-based subnetworks for each window. Then, previously validated parameters of network reconfiguration were assessed: promiscuity (number of subnetworks switched to) and flexibility (number of switches). Results: Compared to HC, patients with BN displayed a higher promiscuity of all brain subnetworks combined, and regionally for the dorsal attention network, with no change in flexibility. Patients with AUD showed no difference in either promiscuity or flexibility. Global and dorsal attention network promiscuity were negatively correlated with subjective stress. Conclusion: Regions typically assigned to the dorsal attention network changed their association with a higher number of other subnetworks in BN compared to HC. This suggests a less focused dynamic integration of information, which could play a role vulnerability to stress, attentional biases and impulsivity. Alexithymia And Interpersonal Stress: An Experimental Study In Individuals With Eating Disorders\n\nAlessio Maria Monteleone1, Eugenia Barone1, Marco Carfagno1, Giammarco Cascino2\n\n1University of Campania L. Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy, 2University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy\n\nIntroduction The association between alexithymia and eating disorder (ED) psychopathology has been poorly explored through experimental studies. This study aimed to assess if individuals with EDs and alexithymia showed impaired biological and emotional responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Methods According to Toronto Alexithymia Scale scores, 51 participants (29 with anorexia nervosa and 22 with bulimia nervosa) were classified as alexithymic ED participants while 38 participants (21 with anorexia nervosa and 17 with bulimia nervosa) were identified as non alexithymic ED participants. Forty healthy women were also enrolled. Cortisol, anxiety, and hunger responses to TSST were measured. Results Alexithymic individuals with EDs showed heightened production of cortisol in comparison to both non alexithymic ED participants and healthy women but lower cortisol reactivity than healthy women. Compared to healthy women all individuals with EDs showed increased anxiety response; alexithymic individuals with EDs displayed heightened anxiety than non alexithymic ED participants. Lower hunger response was found in alexithymic individuals with EDs than in healthy women. Conclusions Alexithymia affects biological and emotional responses to an acute psychosocial stress in individuals with EDs. This experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that heightened difficulties with identifying and describing emotions are associated with vulnerability to face social challenges. Multivariate Reward And Anxiety Neural Patterns In Adolescents With Anorexia Nervosa\n\nHayden J Peel1, Nicco Reggente2, Jamie D Feusner1,3,4,5,6\n\n1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada, 2Institute for Advanced Consciousness Studies, San Jose, CA, United States, 3Institute for Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, 4Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, Los Angeles, CA, United States, 5Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, United States, 6Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nIntroduction: People with anorexia nervosa (AN) have elevated anxiety, and most imaging studies show attenuated univariate reward responses. We examined the neural effects of reward, and the effect of anxiety on reward, using multivariate pattern analysis. Methods: 24 adolescent girls with AN and 22 controls completed a monetary reward task during fMRI. Before reward receipt, personalized anxiety-provoking or neutral word stimuli were presented, and their influence on neural response patterns in reward regions was analyzed with representational similarity analysis. Hypotheses were preregistered. Results: AN showed lower representational similarity than controls across neutral-word reward trials (F=6.65, p=.014). However, no such difference was found for anxiety-word reward trials (p=.425). Within-group analysis identified clusters of significant representational similarity during neutral-word reward trials that were present in controls but absent in AN in bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left basolateral amygdala. Conclusions: AN showed less consistent responses in neural activity patterns to reward receipt in a neutral state, whereas, in an anxious state, group differences were not detected. This distributed pattern of decreased consistency in the neutral state indicates altered reward processing in AN, affecting both reward circuit and cognitive control regions during the receipt of reward.

Norton College of Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States, 55. D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nTo investigate the associations among symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with binge eating spectrum conditions – BESC [BED, BN and recurrent binge eating (RBE)], psychiatric and somatic comorbidity and healthcare utilization (HU) in a representative sample of Rio de Janeiro. A household survey with 2,297 adults was conducted. The Adult Self-Rating Scale Screener was used to assess ADHD. BESC was assessed using the Questionnaire of Eating and Weight Patterns-5 and confirmed by telephone interview. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess psychiatric comorbidity. Close-ended questions investigated somatic comorbidity and healthcare utilization. Results: Participants with ADHD symptoms had a significantly higher prevalence of BESC compared to their counterparts (BED = 11% vs 0.9; BN = 8.8% vs 0.3%; RBE= 17.1% vs 3.4%). ADHD symptoms were highly associated with BESC, even after adjustment for BMI and somatic comorbidity. With further adjustment for psychiatric comorbidity (depression, anxiety, alcohol use and impulsivity), the ORs were no longer significant. Healthcare resource utilization was significantly higher in participants with ADHD symptoms associated with BESC but lost significance after controlling for the psychiatric comorbidity. Conclusions: ADHD was associated with an increased prevalence of BESC, and healthcare utilization. Nonetheless, there was an essential interplay among psychiatric comorbidity in the associations of ADHD and BESC. Prevalence And Clinical Correlates Of Complex Ptsd In Eating Disorders\n\nSinead Day1, Phillipa Hay1, Christopher Basten2, Susan Byrne3, Amanda Dearden4, Mandy Goldstein1,5, Amy Hannigan4, Gabriella Heruc6, Catherine Houlihan7, Marion Roberts8, W.

Under ICD-11 criteria, individuals with CPTSD have both PTSD symptoms and additional disturbances of self-organisation (DSO). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ICD-11 PTSD and DSO symptoms and diagnostic rates of PTSD and CPTSD in eating disorder treatment seekers. Methods: The study included 217 participants attending residential, partial hospitalisation, and outpatient services, who completed measures of eating disorder and trauma-related symptoms, and childhood adverse experiences. Results: One third of participants reported PTSD symptoms and over half reported DSO symptoms, with probable ICD-11 diagnostic rates of 3.8% for PTSD and 28.4% for CPTSD. CPTSD was significantly more prevalent than PTSD, and more common in higher levels of care. Both PTSD and DSO symptom severity positively correlated with eating disorder symptoms and impairment, r = .285-.642. DSO symptom severity was a significant and unique explanatory factor of eating disorder severity and impairment. Conclusions: Findings highlight the prevalence of CPTSD in eating disorders and the association between DSO symptoms and eating psychopathology independent of PTSD symptoms. Implications are discussed for adjunct treatment approaches for individuals with this comorbidity. A Cognitive Behavioural Model Of The Bidirectional Relationship Between Disordered Eating And Type 1 Diabetes Self Care: The Experiences Of Men And Women\n\nAmy Harrison1, Emmanouela Konstantara2, Natalie Zaremba2, Jennie Brown2,3, Jacqueline Allan2, Divina Pillary2, David Hopkins3, Janet Treasure4, Khalida Ismail5\n\n1University College London, Department of Psychology and Human Development, London, United Kingdom, 2King's College London, Diabetes Research Group, London, United Kingdom, 3 Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Obesity, King's Health Partners, London, United Kingdom, 4King's College London, Centre for Research on Eating and Weight Disorders, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom, 5King's College London, Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction Disordered eating affects >40% of people with type 1 diabetes and is associated with high distress and greater acute and chronic diabetes complications. This research aimed to 1) Utilise the lived experience of adults living with type 1 diabetes and experiencing disordered eating (T1DE) to develop the first cognitive behavioural (CBT) model of T1DE and ensure that this conceptualisation reflects more diverse experiences by involving both men and women. Methods Twenty-six adult women and 26 adult men with lived experience of T1DE participated in individual semi-structured interviews, analysed using thematic analysis and individual five areas CBT formulations were produced to conceptualise each participant’s experiences with T1DE. Results Both men and women experienced negative thoughts/emotions about food, insulin, weight, shape and diabetes self-care, leading to behaviours like restriction, bingeing, insulin omission and excessive exercise. For women, the sensitising factor for disordered eating was weight change around diabetes diagnosis and commencement of insulin, and the necessary focus on the details of food required for diabetes self-care. For men, practical difficulties with diabetes self-care made them feel more dissatisfied about their body. Conclusions Men and women with T1DE experience similar behaviours, but the experiences that 'switch on' disordered eating in type 1 diabetes may differ. We have tested this CBT model in a feasability randomised controlled trial. Neuroanatomical Associations With Autistic Characteristics In Those With Acute Anorexia Nervosa (Aan) And Weight Restored (Wr) Individuals\n\nMichelle Sader1,2, Daniel J. Halls3, Jess Kerr-Gaffney2,3, Gordon D. Waiter1,2, Karri Gillespie-Smith2,4, Fiona Duffy2,4,5, Kate Tchanturia2,3\n\n1School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom, 2Eating Disorders and Autism Collaborative (EDAC), University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 3Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom, 4School of Health in Social Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 5NHS Lothian Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n\nIncreased rates of co-occurrence are highly reported between those with anorexia nervosa (AN) and Autistic individuals, and restoration of body mass index (BMI) has been shown to play a role in the presentation of autistic characteristics. This study aims to examine neuroanatomical correlates associated with autistic characteristics in those with acute anorexia nervosa (AAN) and those weight restored (WR). Analysis included 183 individuals (nHC=67; nAAN=68; nWR=48) were included to establish group-wise differences, with autistic characteristics linearly examined in AAN/WR individuals (n=116). To examine the potential impact of BMI on associations, tests were repeated in the Lowest 20% (n=23) and Highest 20% (n=23) BMI percentiles. Those with AAN demonstrated increased levels of depression/anxiety/obsessive-compulsive disorder (p<0.001) and increased presentation of autistic characteristics (p<0.001), which did not differ across AAN or WR groups. Group-wise differences were identified within volume/surface area of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (p<0.001/p<0.01) and orbitofrontal cortex (p<0.05/p<0.01), with differences also unrelated to BMI. Autistic characteristics were inversely associated with volume of the MFG (β=-0.20968; p<0.05) and the anterior cingulate cortex (β=-0.19260; p<0.05). No associations were found across BMI percentiles. Findings suggest that the presence of autistic characteristics in those with AAN are identified within the MFG and are unrelated to BMI restoration. Self-Regulation Profiles In Addictive Behaviors Among Adolescents: A Transdiagnostic Approach\n\nEva Van Malderen1, Lien Goossens1, Laurence Claes2, 3, Tom F. Wilderjans2, 4, 5, 6, Eva Kemps7, Sandra Verbeken1\n\n1Ghent University, Department of Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology, Ghent, Belgium, 2KU Leuven, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Leuven, Belgium, 3University of Antwerp, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Antwerp, Belgium, 4Leiden University, Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences,, Leiden, Netherlands, 5Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 6Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum, Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, Netherlands, 7Flinders University, School of Psychology, Adelaide, Australia\n\nDual-pathway models suggest that poor self-regulation (immature regulatory combined with strong reactive processes) is a factor underlying addictive behaviors among adolescents. This study examined whether there are different self-regulation profiles among community adolescents, and how these profiles are related to the presence, severity and comorbidity of addictive behaviors. A community sample of 341 adolescents (13-17 years) was recruited. Participants self-reported on regulatory (inhibitory control) and reactive (reward and punishment sensitivity) processes and on different addictive behaviors (binge eating, tobacco, cannabis and alcohol use, gaming, gambling, pathological buying). A model-based clustering analysis revealed three profiles: ‘impulsive/under-controlled’, ‘anxious’ and ‘resilient’. The ‘impulsive/under-controlled’ had the highest prevalence and severity of cannabis use and the most severe alcohol use. The ‘impulsive/under-controlled’ and ‘resilient’ demonstrated the highest prevalence and severity of tobacco use; the ‘impulsive/under-controlled’ and ‘anxious’ showed the most severe binge eating. Adolescents with more than three types of addictive behaviors generally belonged to the ‘impulsive/under-controlled’ profile. The profiles did not differ for gaming, gambling and pathological buying. Overall, the ‘impulsive/under-controlled’ emerged as the most vulnerable profile, especially for binge eating and substance use. Interoceptive Abilities And Intolerance Of Uncertainty As Potential Factors Contributing To A Distorted Body Representation In Adolescent Girls With Anorexia Nervosa\n\nJojanneke Bijsterbosch1, Lot Sternheim1, Paul Boelen1,2,3 , Unna Danner1,4, Chris Dijkerman1, Anouk Keizer1\n\n1Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands, 2ARQ National Psychotrauma Centre, Diemen, Netherlands, 3ARQ Centrumâ45, Diemen, Netherlands, 4Rintveld Centre for Eating Disorders Altrecht, Zeist, Netherlands\n\nA distorted mental body representation (MBR) is a complex symptom of anorexia nervosa (AN). It entails a disturbance in the processing of multimodal information and its subsequent integration into the internal model of the body in the brain (e.g., overestimation of own body size). Two factors may potentially contribute to these distortions, namely intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and interoceptive abilities (IA). Processing this distorted multimodal information whilst inadequately sensing and interpreting bodily signals may lead to an increase of ambiguous body-related information. In those high in IU, this ambiguous information may be negatively experienced and this distress may contribute to a more severely distorted MBR. This study tested differences between MBR, IA, and IU (AN and controls) as well as associations between study variables. 34 AN and 34 control participants (14 - 18 years) using experimental tasks (Tactile estimation task & Heartrate discrimination task) and self-report measures (BAT, BCAQ, IUS-12 & MAIA-2). We hypothesized that AN showed a greater disturbed MBR and IA , and higher levels of IU and relations between study variables were stronger when compared to controls. Preliminary findings indeed indicate differences in AN vs controls showing a larger disturbance and a stronger association on studied variables. Adolescents with AN may benefit from extensive body image programs that include components of IA and IU. Cross-Sectional And Longitudinal Associations Of Parental Binge Eating With Child Binge Eating And Weight-Control Behaviors\n\nJanet Lydecker1, Zhijun Zhang2, Nicole Larson 3, Katie Loth3, Melanie Wall2, Dianne Neumark-Sztainer3\n\n1Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States, 2Columbia University, New York, NY, United States, 3University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States\n\nIntroduction: Cross-sectional and retrospective research has shown parental binge eating is associated with disordered eating in their children. The present analysis extends the evidence by examining both cross-sectional and longitudinal relations between parental binge eating and child binge eating and extreme weight-control behaviors. Methods: Adolescents (n=2381; M=14.5±2.0y), followed to adulthood (M=22.1±2.0y), and their parents (n=3664) completed surveys as part of EAT 2010-2018 and Project F-EAT 2010. Models adjusted for parent weight category and gender, and child gender, age and ethnicity. Results: Approximately 5% of parents reported binge eating, which was not related to their age, gender, education, or ethnicity. Parental binge eating (during their child’s adolescence) was associated with adolescent children’s use of extreme weight-control behaviors (e.g., vomiting, Odds Ratio=2.34, p<.01) and with children’s future binge eating during young adulthood (Odds Ratio=1.80, p=.02). Other associations did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Findings extend the literature by using separate child and parent assessments, a population-based sample, and multiple timepoints. Children of parents with binge eating appear to have elevated risk of extreme weight-control behaviors during adolescence and binge eating during young adulthood. Research should develop and test clinical tools to support parents with binge eating and strategies for prevention and intervention. Feasibility And Acceptability Of A Brief, School-Based Intervention For Eating Disorders: Qualitative Perspectives Of Pupils, Parents And School Staff\n\nTabitha Jackson1, Sophie Fletcher1, Talar Moukhtarian1, Carla Toro1, Charlotte Kershaw1, Glenn Waller2, Caroline Meyer1\n\n1University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom, 2University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom\n\nObjectives: While around a third of UK secondary school pupils exhibit clinically significant eating pathology, in-school mental health provision does not include interventions for such individuals. This qualitative study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a brief, school-based intervention for eating disorders, by exploring the views of staff, parents and pupils, gaining insights on how to overcome practical obstacles. Method: Eighty pupils, parents and staff took part in twelve focus groups across four schools. The semi-structured interview guide included questions about the practicalities of a potential eating disorders treatment programme, the acceptability of the intervention, and the likelihood of future uptake. Results: Five overarching themes and twelve sub-themes emerged, reflecting perceptions of the scale of eating and body image concerns, the limitations in their management, and the importance of prioritising mental health over education. Advantages, challenges, considerations, and solutions were proposed for an in-school eating disorders treatment programme. Conclusions: These qualitative data show that there is substantial support for an appropriately-implemented in-school delivery of brief, evidence-based treatment, demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach to support children and adolescents to receive early help with their eating problems and body image concerns. Longitudinal Associations Between Weight-Based Discrimination And Mental Health In Youth\n\nArielle T. Pearlman , Mikela A. Murphy , Sorana Raiciulescu , David A. Klein , Joshua C. Gray , Natasha A. Schvey\n\nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, United States\n\nThe current study assessed prospective associations between weight-based discrimination and mental health outcomes among participants in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. At the one-year visit, children indicated whether they had experienced weight-based discrimination in the past year and parents completed the KSADS to determine the presence of sub-or-full threshold eating and mood disorders, and suicidality for their child. At the two-year visit, youths completed the KSADS to assess the same outcomes. Logistic regressions, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI-z, and parent-reported presence of the respective mental health condition at 1-year, were conducted to assess associations between weight-based discrimination and mental health outcomes one year later. Participants were 11,878 youths (Mage: 10.9y, 45.1% female, 48% racial/ethnic minority). The presence of weight-based discrimination, reported by 6.1% of youths, was significantly associated with greater odds of both sub- or full-threshold mood (aOR (95%CI): 3.10 (2.11-4.55)) and eating disorders (aOR: 3.79 (1.90-7.59)), and suicidal ideation (aOR: 3.38 (1.78-6.42)), but not with suicidal behavior. Weight-based discrimination may confer risk for the onset of eating- and mood-related pathology, including suicidal ideation, beyond the contribution of weight. Research is needed to examine the impacts of multiple forms of discrimination on mental health as well as risk and protective factors. Links Between Childhood Food Insecurity And Adolescent Eating Disorder Symptoms In A Uk Cohort Study\n\nNora Trompeter1, Marie-Christine Opitz2, F. Diego Rabelo-da-Ponte3, Helen Sharpe2, Sylvane Desrivieres 3, Ulrike Schmidt3, Nadia Micali1, 4\n\n1Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL, London, United Kingdom, 2Department of Clinical Psychology, School of Health in Social Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 3Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom, 4Center for Eating and feeding Disorders Research, Mental Health Center Ballerup, Copenhagen University Hospital â Mental Health Services CPH,, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nIntroduction: Food insecurity is increasingly linked with disordered eating. However, studies have not yet explored impacts of childhood food insecurity on disordered eating in adolescence. This study examined the links between patterns of childhood food insecurity and adolescent disordered eating in a large population-based sample in the UK. Methods: Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (N=6,723; 55.7% girls). Food insecurity was reported by mothers from pregnancy to age 7. Disordered eating was reported by adolescents at ages 14, 16, and 18. Results: Most participants experienced no food insecurity in childhood (n = 5,801, 77.9%), followed by low food insecurity (n = 416, 12.4%), decreasing food insecurity (n = 292, 6.0%), and stable food insecurity (n = 214, 3.7%). Adolescents with decreasing childhood food insecurity had higher odds of binge eating and compensatory behaviours at age 14 than those with no childhood food insecurity (OR = 1.61, p = .042; OR = 1.49, p = .019). Adolescents with stable food insecurity had higher odds of compensatory behaviours than those with no childhood food insecurity at age 14 (OR = 1.49, p = .037). No significant associations were found with disordered eating at ages 16 or 18. Discussion: Food insecurity that persists or decreases over childhood seems to have proximal effects on disordered eating at age 14, but not 16 or 18. This highlights the potential impact of early childhood experiences on disordered eating. Diagnostic Migration From Arfid In Childhood To Other Eating Disorder Symptoms In Adolescence And Early Adulthood\n\nLisa Dinkler1, Liv Hog1, Ralf Kuja-Halkola1, Paul Lichtenstein1, Henrik Larsson1,2, Sebastian LundstrÃ¶m3, Mark J. Taylor1, Cynthia M. Bulik1,4,5\n\n1Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, 2School of Medical Sciences, Ãrebro University, Ãrebro, Sweden, 3Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden, 4Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States, 5Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nIntroduction: Although diagnostic migration is common across anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder; we know little about whether it occurs between ARFID and other eating disorders (EDs). An important knowledge gap is whether children with ARFID are at increased risk of developing later EDs. Methods: We examined migration from childhood ARFID to other ED symptoms in adolescence and early adulthood using a longitudinal cohort design. In 30,795 Swedish twins, we identified ARFID between age 6 and 12 in 616 children (2.0%). The Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2) and additional self-report questions were used to assess ED symptoms at three time points (age 15, 18, and 24). We applied linear and logistic regressions and tested potential sex differences. Results: We did not find any significant differences between children with and without ARFID in mean scores of all three EDI-2 subscales at all time points. The ARFID group did not have an increased risk of self-reported dieting, purging, excessive exercise, fear of weight gain, or loss of control eating at any time point. No sex effects were found. Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, but consistent with three small previous studies, ARFID in childhood was not associated with increased risk of other ED symptoms in adolescence and early adulthood. This lack of diagnostic migration might differentiate ARFID from other EDs. Studies with clinically diagnosed EDs and even longer follow-up times are needed. Food Addiction Is Associated With Psychiatric Morbidity Irrespective Of Bmi\n\nChristina Horsager1, Emil FÃ¦rk1, Jens Meldgaard Bruun2,3, Marlene Briciet Lauritsen1,4, SÃ¸ren Dinesen Ãstergaard3,5\n\n1Psychiatry, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark, 2Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, 3Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark, 4Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, 5Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry, Aarhus, Denmark\n\nIntroduction: Food addiction is characterized by an addiction-like attraction to ultra-processed foods and has shown to be associated with psychiatric morbidity and BMI. However, it remains unclear whether the association with psychiatric morbidity is mainly driven by the high BMI itself. We aimed to investigate whether food addiction is associated with psychiatric morbidity in individuals with overweight/obesity from a general population irrespective of BMI and sociodemographic status. Methods: Data stems from the Food Addiction Denmark Study; a large nation-wide survey conducted in Denmark in 2018. A random sample of 5000 adults age 18 to 62 from the general population were invited to participate in a web-based survey. The questionnaire included the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 measuring food addiction, a range of measures on psychopathology, and BMI. Data on socioeconomics from the Danish registers were linked to all invitees. Data were analyzed by multivariable regression analyses. Results: Individuals with overweight/obesity and food addiction were more likely to experience a range of self-reported psychiatric symptoms compared to individuals, with the same BMI, but without food addiction. Conclusion: This study finds a cross-sectional association between food addiction and psychiatric morbidity in individuals with overweight/obesity irrespective of BMI. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the causality of the association between food addiction, BMI and mental health. Eating Disorders In Indigenous Populations Across The Globe\n\nDeborah Mitchison1, Ann Ragnhild Broderstad2, Adam Burt3, Kirsti KvalÃ¸y2,4,5\n\n1Graduate School of Health, Discipline of Clinical Psychology, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia, 2Centre for Sami Health Research, Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, TromsÃ¸, Norway, 3School of Medicine, Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia, 4HUNT Research Centre, Department of Public Health and Nursing, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, 5Levanger Hospital, Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Hospital Trust, Levanger, Norway\n\nThe dominant view of eating disorders has been that they primarily affect Western White and metropolitan populations. However, evidence now shows that disordered eating (DE) is widespread, if not phenomenologically uniform. This narrative review addressed the comparative prevalence and characteristics of DE among Indigenous populations relative to colonizing majority populations. Methods: We applied a systematic search to capture and synthesise findings from historical to recent studies that investigated the prevalence of DE among Indigenous peoples within colonized countries. Results: Most studies were conducted in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; though a small proportion were conducted in other countries - Norway, Guam, India, and Colombia. Overall, an elevated risk for DE among Indigenous groups was observed relative to the colonizing majority ethnic group – however this was not uniform. A consistent correlate of increased DE risk was higher BMI among Indigenous groups; however, there was a lack of consideration of other explanatory factors. Conclusions: We recommend that future research seeking to improve our understanding of DE among Indigenous peoples (a) prioritise original studies designed to specifically to understand eating patterns and body image among Indigenous peoples (most studies have relied on pre-existing data), and (b) consult and engage with local Indigenous communities to ensure cultural sensitivity of protocols. Epidemiology And Correlates Of Eating Disorders In Southern Africa: A Systematic Review\n\nBernou Melisse1, Jojanneke M Bijsterbosch2, Lot C Sternheim2\n\n1American Center for Psychiatry and Neurology , Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 2Dep. Clinical Psychology Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands\n\nResearch suggests that eating disorders (EDs) are on the rise in low- and middle income countries, yet ED studies in in Southern Africa are limited. Globalization, instrumental in the rise of obesity and EDs, is growing in Southern Africa, whilst simultaneously Southern Africa experiences food insecurity, which in turn is associated with increased levels of ED pathology (e.g. binge eating, compensatory behavior, dietary restraint). Alongside a lack of appropriate assessment tools, there is a the lack of access to care in most of Southern Africa’s countries. Adressing EDs in Southern Africa is warranted and the current review aims to provide estimate rates of EDs, individuals at high risk for an ED, and ED behaviors in Southern Africa. Prisma guidelines were followed to identify, select and include articles. Twenty-six peer-reviewed studies in English from 1981 onwards were included. ED point prevalence was 0.7%. The reports on Anorexia Nervosa varied from being absent to 2.9%, for Bulimia Nervosa between 0.5-1%, Binge Eating Disorder = 3.2% and Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder by 4.7%. High prevalences were found for PICA. In addition, 3.5- 10.4% scored above a clinical cutoff on an ED screener, and 5-39.8% reported other ED symptoms. Data suggest that developing appropriate diagnostic tools and interventions for ED in Southern Africa are much needed. Who Is Included In Studies Of Night Eating Syndrome? A Scoping Review Of Reported Participant Characteristics.\n\nTaylor Penwell1, Sarah Attaway1, Isabella Pruscino2, Ava Hogan2, Ruth Striegel Weissman2, Caitlin Martin-Wagar1\n\n1University of Montana, Helena, MT, United States, 2Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT, United States\n\nIntroduction. Though definitions of Night Eating Syndrome (NES) have changed over time, there is a lack of consensus about at-risk populations. Early NES studies focused on higher-weight individuals, but with newer criteria, a wider range of individuals can be included in NES research. The current review focused on understanding the participant samples in NES studies. Method. PubMed and PsychINFO were used to search for titles and abstracts using the term “night eating syndrome” from 1/2013 to 8/17/2023. Review studies, samples ages <18 years old, non-English language, and ≤ 10 NES participants were excluded. Two authors independently coded each article for eligibility, sample demographics, and study inclusion/exclusion. Results. The majority of the 62 eligible articles were from the United States (n = 18; 29%), followed by Turkey (n = 11; 17.7%). Over one-third of the articles reported no NES sample demographics at all. The most reported demographics were sex/gender (n = 37; 59.7%), BMI/weight class (n = 33; 53%), and age (n = 32; 51.6%). Conclusions. The findings show that there is a dearth of demographic data reported across NES samples. The review highlights the need for future research to report sample characteristics, along with being intentional about who is included in NES studies to improve knowledge about and generalization of findings. Understanding Food Addiction: A Genetic Perspective\n\nGiovanni Castellini1, Elvira Carbone2, Marianna Rania3, Renato De Filippis2, Ettore DâOnofrio2, Cristina Segura Garcia3,4\n\n1University of Florence, Florence, Italy, 2Department of Health Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy, 3Center for Clinical Research and Treatment of Eating Disorders, University Hospital R. Dulbecco,, Catanzaro, Italy, 4Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy\n\nIntroduction\n\nFood addiction (FA) has gained more scientific attention but needs deeper understanding. Evidence indicates that the central melanocortin (MC) system through the MC4 receptor and its polymorphisms play a crucial role in the regulation of eating behavior and motivation for the rewarding properties of food leading to the emergence of altered reward-related behaviors. The study aims to evaluate the genetic contribution of rs17782313, rs12970134, rs10871777, rs6567160,rs17700144 MC4R polymorphisms to the development of FA and to assess the association between MC4R variations and clinical features.\n\nMethods\n\nEating (EDE-Q, BES, NEQ, GQ) and general psychopathology (BDI, STAI-S, DERS) were evaluated in patients with obesity with and without FA (FA group/control group). Y-FAS 2.0 was used to assess FA. A blood sample was collected from all patients for the genotyping of MC4-R polymorphisms.\n\nResults\n\nAll the polymorphisms were equally distributed between groups except for rs17782313. A direct association between rs17782313 with FA was evident. Patients in FA group with C allele showed higher risk of FA compared to control group. There was a significant effect of rs17782313 on STAI and BDI-II in the FA group. Allele C carriers exhibited higher anxiety and depression than T carriers.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe rs17782313 of MC4R showed an association with FA. A significant direct influence of C allele on anxiety and depression emerged in the FA group but not in the control group. Ketogenic Diet And Ketamine Infusion Treatment To Target Chronic Persistent Eating Disorder Psychopathology In Anorexia Nervosa; A Pilot Study\n\nB Scolnick1, L Calabrese2, B Zupek-Kania3, C Beckwith4, G Frank5\n\n1Internal & Addiction Medicine, Waban, MA, United States, 2Innovative Psychiatry, So Windsor, CT, United States, 3Ketogenic Therapy, Milwaukee, WI, United States, 4Peer Counseling, New York, NY, United States, 5University California San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States\n\nPurpose Shape and weight concerns are often chronic despite weight normalization in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). A case study using a ketogenic diet followed by ketamine infusions led to sustained remission in one patient with chronic AN. We conducted an open-label trial to test whether this response could be replicated. Methods Five adults, weight recovered from AN but with persistent eating disorder thoughts and behaviors adopted a therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD). After sustaining nutritional ketosis, participants received six ketamine infusions and were followed over 6 months. Results All participants completed the study protocol without significant adverse effects. Two participants maintained TKD for 8 weeks prior to ketamine infusions due to good behavioral response and remained on TKD. Three participants received TKD for 4 weeks prior to and during ketamine, then tapered off. The group showed significant improvements on the Clinical Impairment Assessment (p = 0.008), Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ) Global score (p = 0.006), Eating Disorders Recovery Questionnaire (EDRQ) Acceptance of Self and Body (0.027). Weight remained stable, except for one participant who relapsed 4 months after treatment and off TKD. Conclusion This novel treatment appears to be safe and effective for adults with chronic AN-related psychopathology and merits further study. Does Watching #Whatieatinaday Videos On Tiktok Impact Eating Disorder Cognitions And Urges To Engage In Eating Disorder Behaviors? An Experimental Investigation\n\nHeather A Davis1, A. Gabrielle G. Patarinski1, Jacqueline A. Kosmas1, Chloe Roske2, Meredith Kells3\n\n1Department of Psychology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, United States, 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States, 3School of Nursing, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States\n\nObjective. “What I Eat in a Day” (#WhatIEatInADay) videos are common on TikTok and show a creator eating food in one day. Research indicates two types of #WhatIEatInADay videos: Lifestyle, which includes restrictive diets and eating disorder (ED) themes, and Eating Only, which includes eating excessive amounts of food. We examined effects of viewing #WhatIEatInADay videos on weight/shape preoccupation and urges to engage in ED behaviors. Method. College students [N=456; 73% women, 67% white] were randomly assigned to view Lifestyle, Eating Only, or control (#Art) TikTok videos for 6 minutes. Before and after, participants rated their weight/shape preoccupation and urges to binge eat, vomit, and exercise. Results. Mixed between-within subject ANOVAs revealed a significant interaction between time and condition for weight/shape preoccupation and ED behavior urges. The Lifestyle condition reported an increase in weight/shape preoccupation (t152=-4.44, p<.001) and urges to vomit (t151=-3.21, p<.01) and exercise (t152=-4.30, p<.001), but not binge eat. The Eating Only condition reported an increase in weight/shape preoccupation (t148=-3.00, p<.01) and urge to vomit (t143=-3.50, p<.001) but not binge eat or exercise. The control condition reported a decline in urges to binge eat (t149=2.65, p<.01) and exercise (t150=3.06, p<.001) but no change in weight/shape preoccupation or urge to vomit. Conclusion. Watching TikTok #WhatIEatInADay videos may elevate risk for ED cognitions and behaviors. Disabilities And Eating Disorders: A Theoretical Model And Call For Research\n\nMolly W. Fennig1, Phaedra Longhurst2, Lindsay Gillikin3, M. Ariel Cascio4, C. Blair Burnette5, Kirsten E. Gilbert6, Samantha L. Hahn7\n\n1Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, United States, 2School of Psychology and Sport Science, Anglia Ruskin University, East Anglia, United Kingdom, 3Department of Psychology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, United States, 4Center for Bioethics and Social Justice & Department of Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States, 5Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States, 6Department of Psychiatry, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, United States, 7College of Medicine, Central Michigan University,, Mount Pleasant, MI, United States\n\nWhile eating disorder (ED) research has worked to broaden the inclusion of marginalized groups (e.g., sexual and gender minorities), such efforts have yet to be fully expanded toward the disabled population. This paper highlights the lack of research on the relationships between disabilities and EDs, despite their common convergence. We aim to 1) highlight the need for further research investigating the relationships between disability status and EDs, 2) describe existing frameworks for conceptualizing disability, 3) utilize such frameworks to propose a novel theoretical model of ED/disability relationships and related sociocultural factors and 4) identify future directions for research in this area. We propose a theoretical model of bidirectional ED/disability relationships. Further, we describe how these relationships are likely influenced by a system of individual factors (e.g., disability (in)visibility, food access, and self-identification) and sociocultural factors (e.g., ableism/discrimination and weight stigma). Scholars are encouraged to test our proposed model and further investigate experiences of disability and ED co-occurrence with participatory and mixed-methods research. There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate ED prevention and screening programs, as well as treatment access and efficacy, for disabled populations. Disability should also be routinely collected as a demographic, and ED measures should be validated and/or developed for individuals with disabilities. Protocol For Co-Designing A Clinical Research Registry For A Youth Eating Disorders Service\n\nStephanie Miles1,2, Erica Neill1,2, Kamryn T. Eddy3,4, Genevieve Pepin5, Shannon Calvert6, Kathleen de Boer7, Caroline Gao1,2,8, Dominic Dwyer1,2, Andrea Phillipou1,2,9,10,7\n\n1Orygen, Melbourne, Australia, 2The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, 3Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States, 4Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States, 5Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia, 6N/A, Perth, Australia, 7Swinburne University, Melbourne, Australia, 8Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, 9St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, 10Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia\n\nIntroduction: A clinical research registry is an efficient and pragmatic data repository that can be used clinically to guide patient care and provide rich information for research. Such data can shed light on clinical profiles, illness trajectories, and existing heterogeneity in treatment responses, ultimately guiding more effective and meaningful clinical care and research. This paper describes the creation of a clinical research registry for a youth eating disorders (ED) service. Methods: The registry will be implemented at an outpatient mental health service for 12–25-year-olds from Melbourne, Australia. The registry is co-designed with researchers, clinicians, individuals with lived experience of an ED, and carers/family of individuals with an ED. Registry development involves 5 phases: Phase 1: Identifying Priorities (family members and people with lived experience of an ED will be interviewed to identify registry priorities), Phase 2: Registry Development (measures selected to capture Phase 1-identified priorities), Phase 3: Registry Validation (registry design will be presented to the interview groups for feedback), Phase 4: Registry Finalisation (the registry will be finalised and pilot tested), Phase 5 – Registry Implementation. Conclusions: This project will create the world’s first lived experience-informed clinical research registry for EDs. Sharing this protocol will demonstrate how co-design can occur in ED research and highlight the value of registries. An Integrated Qualitative Investigation Of Clinician And Implementation Specialist Views On An Early Intervention Service For Eating Disorders In England\n\nLucy Hyam1, Claire Torkelson2, Olivia Yeadon-Ray2, Katie Richards3, Amy Semple4, Karina Allen1,5, Jill Owens4, Aileen Jackson4, Laura Semple6, Danielle Glennon5, Giulia Di Clemente5, Jess Griffiths5, Regan Mills1, Ulrike Schmidt1,5\n\n1Centre for Research in Eating and Weight Disorders, Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom, 2Department of Psychosis Studies, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom, 3Centre for Implementation Science, King's College London, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom, 4Health Innovation Network, Academic Health Science Network, London, United Kingdom, 5South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom, 6The Academic Health Science Network, hosted by Manchester Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: The First Episode Rapid Early Intervention for Eating Disorders (FREED) is the leading early intervention model for eating disorders. FREED has demonstrated positive clinical outcomes, has been scaled across England, and is now being adapted across the globe. We explored implementation challenges, facilitators and processes via the views of implementation specialists and clinical staff delivering FREED in two integrated studies. Methods: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted to explore the views of 13 implementation specialists and 26 clinicians, respectively. These were analysed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Subthemes were rated as facilitators and/or barriers. Results: Data revealed that FREED was viewed positively as a flexible pathway with potential for high patient benefit. A strong inter-organisational support network was perceived as important for implementation success. Key barriers included issues within eating disorder services such as staffing shortages and variable team/managerial support. Conclusions: Both studies revealed wide support for FREED. However, continued investment and research are crucial to improve implementation fidelity and address identified challenges. Overall, these studies offer valuable insights on ‘real-world’ early intervention and the scaling of novel healthcare initiatives, and learning for those currently adapting FREED to different continents and healthcare systems. It&Rsquo;S Not Black And White: Examining Drive For Thinness And Bulimia In Women From Two Academic Institutions\n\nHarmony F. Vides-Varini , Sarrah I. Ali , Pamela K. Keel\n\nFlorida State University, Tallahassee, FL, United States\n\nIntroduction: What is known about eating disorders is heavily influenced by studies in which most participants are White. Small numbers of minoritized participants limits power for detecting effects of race or ethnicity, raising concerns about generalizability. This study examined the influence of ethnoracial status on levels and associations between Drive for Thinness (DT) and Bulimia scores from two academic institutions.\n\nMethods: Female undergraduates completed the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) from an Ivy League (N=1004, 9% Hispanic, 66% White, 8% Black, 22% Asian, 1% Native American, 1% Native Hawaiian, 2% Other) and a public university (N=673; 11% Hispanic, 71% White, 25% Black, 2% Asian, 1% Native American, 1% Other). MANOVA was used to test the effects of race, ethnicity, college, and their interactions on DT and Bulimia.\n\nResults: Racial identity had a significant main effect on DT (.007) and Bulimia (p=.01), with Bonferroni-corrected posthoc tests supporting significantly higher DT and Bulimia in White and higher DT in Asian women compared to Black women. No other effects were significant. In addition, race moderated the association between DT and Bulimia scores (p=.003), with a weaker association in Black (r=.52) compared to White (r=.66) and Asian women (r=.69).\n\nDiscussion: Future work should examine potential influence of ethnoracial status on measurement variance of the EDI to fully capture potential threats to generalizability of results. Risk, Reward, And Restriction: Evidence Of Association Between Restrictive Eating Pathology And Impaired Performance During Approach-Avoidance Conflict\n\nLisa M. Anderson1, Katherine Schaumberg2\n\n1University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States, 2University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States\n\nObjective: Maladaptive avoidance behavior in eating disorders (EDs) may reflect altered decision making when approach and avoidance tendencies conflict. Little research has examined decision-making in the context of approach-avoidance conflict in EDs. Methods: Adolescent and adult females (N=87, Mage = 22.14 years, Mbmi = 23.66) with varying levels of restrictive eating pathology completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory and an approach-avoidance conflict task (Weaver et al., 2020). We conducted trial-by-trial analyses to characterize approach and avoidance behavior changes in response to reward (receiving points) or ED-related threat (i.e., seeing a fat body) when faced with approach-avoidance conflict, and determine if behavior relates to restrictive eating severity. Results: Approach-avoidance task performance negatively related to restrictive eating severity. For instance, individuals with low to medium levels of restrictive eating changed their response to cues after a threat outcome, and stayed with their prior response after a reward (ps<.001). Individuals with high levels of restrictive eating changed their response to cues, regardless of threat or reward outcome in the prior trial. Conclusions: Individuals with low restrictive eating make adaptive decisions to approach or avoid stimuli based on prior experience. Those with high restrictive eating inconsistently select responses, likely interfering with learning and decision making in the context of approach-avoidance conflict. Disgust In Anorexia Nervosa: Testing A Theoretical Model Connecting Negative Body Image To Disgust Propensity, Disgust Sensitivity, And Self-Disgust.\n\nFleur Boonstra1, Rebecca Schulz1, Peter J. Peter1, Klaske A. Glashouwer1,2\n\n1Clinical Psychology and Experimental Psychopathology, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands, 2Department of Eating Disorders, Accare Child- and Adolescent Psychiatry, Groningen, Netherlands\n\nIntroduction Negative body image (NBI) is a core feature of anorexia nervosa (AN) and thought to play a central role in its development, maintenance and relapse. Prior findings showed that the general tendency to experience disgust (i.e., disgust propensity; DP) was related to a NBI via self-disgust. No moderation effect was found of disgust sensitivity (DS) on the relationship of self-disgust and NBI. The major aim of the current study was to investigate this theoretical model in a clinical sample of adolescent with AN. As a subsidiary aim, we explored how body checking and body avoidance related to NBI and self-disgust. Method Participants were 64 adolescents with AN and 62 without AN, all female and aged 13-19. They completed the questionnaires about eating disorder symptoms, negative body image, self-disgust, disgust propensity and sensitivity and body checking and body avoidance behaviors. Results Self-disgust fully mediated the relationship between DP and NBI. Body checking, but not body avoidance, mediated the relationship between self-disgust and NBI. DS did not moderate the relationship between self-disgust and NBI. Conclusions In line with our theoretical model and prior findings, disgust propensity indeed was associated with a NBI via self-disgust. The relationship between self-disgust and NBI may run via increased body checking behavior. These results point to the potential importance of (self-)disgust-related mechanisms in AN. A First Look At Eating Behaviors And Negative Affect In The Daily Lives Of Adults With Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n\nKendra R. Becker1,2,3, Haley Graver1,2, Ross D.

We aimed to 1) describe the frequency of 8 avoidant/restrictive eating behaviors and 2) test if behaviors are more likely on days with elevated negative affect. Methods: Thirty adults (Mage=29.2; 69% female) with ARFID completed an ARFID symptom checklist and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale 9 times/day for 7 days. Results: Fifty-two percent of reports included behaviors (760 behaviors over 1,454 momentary assessments). Food avoidance (eating alone, eating the same foods for consecutive meals, avoiding non-preferred foods, declining new foods) was endorsed in 36% of assessments with avoiding non-preferred foods the most common. Food restriction (refusing preferred foods, eating slowly, missing meals, and not finishing meals) was endorsed in 16% of reports with missing a meal the most common. Avoiding non-preferred foods, eating the same foods, and missing meals, were most likely to be reported multiple times in a single day. On days when a participant reported higher than average negative affect, they were more likely to refuse to eat with others (p<.001). Conclusions: Avoidant/restrictive eating occurs multiple times a day in adults with ARFID. Results offer initial evidence that—like in other eating disorders—negative affect is associated with maladaptive eating in ARFID. Exploring The Trajectory Of Guilt Around A Loss-Of-Control Eating Episode And Attributions Of Guilt\n\nEmily K Burr1, Robert D Dvorak1, Lauren M Schaefer2, Alejandra Medina1\n\n1University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States, 2Sanford Center for Bio-behavioral Resaerch, Fargo, ND, United States\n\nThe relationship between loss of control eating (LOCE) and momentary changes in guilt around these episodes appears to be complex, and may be impacted by other factors (e.g., causes of guilt, emotion dysregulation). Adults (N = 75) with recurrent LOCE completed a 10-day ecological momentary assessment. Momentary ratings of guilt and eating behavior were recorded across five random timepoints a day, and in self-initiated surveys around eating. When guilt was endorsed, participants indicated reasons for guilt by selecting from three options (guilt due to a prior eating episode, upcoming eating episode, or other). The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was administered at baseline. A multilevel model examined the trajectories of guilt around LOCE episodes, and the impact of baseline DERS scores on these trajectories. Significant quadratic and cubic effects indicated that guilt increased immediately prior to LOCE episodes, and the linear slope of guilt continued to increase after LOCE episodes. DERS scores did not moderate the trajectory of guilt, although participants with greater emotion dysregulation reported higher levels of guilt overall. In guilt attributions, 44% of responses attributed guilt to a past eating episode, 19% were due to an upcoming eating episode, and 36% were for a non-eating reason. Findings suggest that guilt related to future and past eating episodes contribute strongly to LOCE episodes, potentially representing an important treatment target. Linking Adverse Childhood Experiences And Eating Disorders In Young Adulthood: The Role Of Mentalization And Personality Functioning\n\nDanguole Cekuoliene , Rima Breidokiene\n\nVilnius University, Institute of Psychology, Center of Developmental Psychopathology Research, Vilnius, Lithuania\n\nObjective. Research has demonstrated that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) may be linked to diverse psychopathologies in adulthood including eating disorders (ED), poorer mentalization and lowered personality functioning (PF). In the light of the novel conceptualization of personality dysfunction (ICD-11 model) this study examines the role of mentalization and PF level as possible mediators in relation between the history of ACE and ED symptoms in young adults. Method. Convenience sample of 306 adults (83.3% female, M age= 23.84, S= 4.06) was assessed by the self-report online questionnaire involving Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, The Level of Personality Functioning Scale and Mentalization Scale. Results. 63.7 % of the participants reported current or previous ED. Severity of ED was predicted by the lower level of self-directed mentalization and personality functioning and higher indexes of emotional neglect (EN) in childhood. ED symptoms manifestation was directly associated with EN in childhood and indirectly related to it through poorer mentalization and lowered level of PF. Conclusions. Study findings shed light on the links between adverse childhood experiences, mentalization and personality functioning as the potential underlying mechanism in eating pathology formation as well as may offer some practical implications in treatment of ED. Research was funded by Lithuanian research council No. S-MIP-23-10. Peripersonal Space And Body Perception: Contrasting Impacts Of Bmi And Perceived Body Size In Anorexia Nervosa And Healthy Controls\n\nEnrico Collantoni1, Valentina Meregalli1, Matteo Girondini2, Gaia Risso2, Andrea Serino2, Angela Favaro1\n\n1Department of Neuroscience, University of Padova, Padova, Italy, 2MySpace Lab, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nIntroduction: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) involves a disturbance in body representation, including body schema and multisensory integration. The peripersonal space (PPS), representing the immediate space surrounding the body for physical interaction, is linked to these abilities. This study examines PPS representation in patients with AN compared to healthy controls (HCs). Methods: 36 patients with AN and 42 HCs performed a task assessing PPS extent and sharpness, responding to vibrotactile stimulations while observing an approaching stimulus in Virtual Reality. Based on the relationship between the visual stimulus distance and reaction time, we derived the slope"
