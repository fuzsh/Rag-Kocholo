        "text": "Lasers for tattoo removal: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoudhary, Sonal; Elsaie, Mohamed L; Leiva, Angel; Nouri, Keyvan\n\n2010-09-01\n\nTattoos have existed and have been used as an expression of art by man for ages-and so have the techniques to remove them. Lasers based on the principle of selective photothermolysis are now being used to remove black as well as colorful tattoos with varying successes. The commonly used lasers for tattoo removal are the Q-switched 694-nm ruby laser, the Q-switched 755-nm alexandrite laser, the 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser, and the 532-nm Nd:YAG laser. Newer techniques and methods are evolving in tattoo removal with lasers. Choosing the right laser for the right tattoo color is necessary for a successful outcome. Our review aims to understand the principles of laser tattoo removal and their applications for different types and colors of tattoos. The review also highlights the complications that can occur such as dyspigmentation, allergic reactions, epidermal debris, ink darkening, and so on, in this process and how to prevent them.\n\nLaser Tattoo Removal: An Update.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaga, Lina I; Alster, Tina S\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTattoo art has been around for thousands of years in every culture and is currently flourishing in all age groups, social classes, and occupations. Despite the rising popularity of tattoos, demand for their removal has also increased. While various treatments, including surgical excision, dermabrasion, and chemical destruction have historically been applied, over the past 2 decades, lasers have revolutionized the way tattoos are treated and have become the gold standard of treatment. To achieve optimal cosmetic outcome of treatment, lasers emitting high energies and short pulses are required to adequately destroy tattoo ink. We review the history of laser tattoo removal, outlining the challenges inherent in developing lasers that can most effectively remove tattoo particles while safely protecting skin from unwanted injury.\n\nThe picosecond laser for tattoo removal.\n\nPubMed\n\nHsu, Vincent M; Aldahan, Adam S; Mlacker, Stephanie; Shah, Vidhi V; Nouri, Keyvan\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe prevalence of tattoos continues to grow as modern society's stigma towards this form of body art shifts towards greater acceptance. Approximately one third of Americans aged 18-25 and 40Â % of Americans aged 26-40 are tattooed. As tattoos continue to rise in popularity, so has the demand for an effective method of tattoo removal such as lasers. The various colors of tattoo inks render them ideal targets for specific lasers using the principle of selective photothermolysis. Traditional laser modalities employed for tattoo removal operate on pulse durations in the nanosecond domain. However, this pulse duration range is still too long to effectively break ink into small enough particles. Picosecond (10 -12 ) lasers have emerged at the forefront of laser tattoo removal due to their shorter pulse lengths, leading to quicker heating of the target chromophores, and consequently, more effective tattoo clearance. Recent studies have cited more effective treatment outcomes using picosecond lasers. Future comparative studies between picosecond lasers of various settings are necessary to determine optimal laser parameters for tattoo clearance.\n\nOptimising Laser Tattoo Removal\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSardana, Kabir; Ranjan, Rashmi; Ghunawat, Sneha\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLasers are the standard modality for tattoo removal. Though there are various factors that determine the results, we have divided them into three logical headings, laser dependant factors such as type of laser and beam modifications, tattoo dependent factors like size and depth, colour of pigment and lastly host dependent factors, which includes primarily the presence of a robust immune response. Modifications in the existing techniques may help in better clinical outcome with minimal risk of complications. This article provides an insight into some of these techniques along with a detailed account of the factors involved in tattoo removal. PMID:25949018\n\nLaser Tattoo Removal: A Clinical Update\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHo, Stephanie GY; Goh, Chee Leok\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTechniques for tattoo removal have evolved significantly over the years. The commonly used Quality-switched (QS) ruby, alexandrite, and Nd:YAG lasers are the traditional workhorses for tattoo removal. Newer strategies using combination laser treatments, multi-pass treatments, and picosecond lasers offer promising results. The tattoo color and skin type of the patient are important considerations when choosing the appropriate laser. Standard protocols can be developed for the effective and safe treatment of tattoos.

The generation of giant pulses by the method of Q-switching is responsible for the unique laser-tissue interaction that is seen in tattoo removal by QS lasers. The QS lasers work by impaction and dissolution of the tattoo pigments. Mechanical fragmentation of the tattoo pigments encased in intracellular lamellated organelles followed by their phagocytosis by macrophages is thought to be the major event in the clearance of pigments by QS lasers. A few novel techniques have been tried in recent times to hasten the clearance of tattoo pigments.

We simultaneously employed a laser-beam deflection probe (LBDP) to measure the shock wave and a camera to detect the plasma radiation, both originating from a high-intensity laser-pulse interaction with a tattoo. The experiments were performed in vitro (skin phantoms), ex vivo (marking tattoos on pig skin), and in vivo (professional and amateur decorative tattoos). The LBDP signal includes the information about the energy released during the interaction and indicates textural changes in the skin, which are specific for different skin and tattoo conditions. Using both sensors, we evaluated a measurement of threshold for skin damage and studied the effect of multiple pulses. In vivo results show that a prepulse reduces the interaction strength and that a single strong pulse produces better removal results.\n\nPicosecond lasers for tattoo removal: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nReiter, Ofer; Atzmony, Lihi; Akerman, Lehavit; Levi, Assi; Kershenovich, Ruben; Lapidoth, Moshe; Mimouni, Daniel\n\n2016-09-01\n\nGiven that the pigment particles in tattoos have a relaxation time of <10Â ns, picosecond lasers would be expected to be more effective than nanosecond lasers in tattoo removal. To systematically review the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of picosecond lasers for tattoo removal, Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists were searched for relevant trials. The primary outcome was >70Â % clearance of tattoo pigment. Secondary outcomes were 90-100Â % clearance of tattoo pigment, number of laser sessions required, and adverse effects. Eight trials were included, six with human participants (160 participants) and 2 with animal models. Seven of the eight trials explored the usage of either 755, 758, 795, 1064, or 1064/532-nm picosecond lasers for black and blue ink tattoos. In the human trials, 69-100Â % of tattoos showed over 70Â % clearance of pigment after 1-10 laser treatments. Reported side effects included pain, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, blister formation and transient erythema, edema, and pinpoint bleeding. Included articles varied in type of laser investigated, mostly non-comparative studies and with a medium to high risk of bias. There is sparse evidence that picosecond lasers are more effective than their nanosecond counterparts for mainly black and blue ink tattoo removal, with minor side effects.\n\nNew and Advanced Picosecond Lasers for Tattoo Removal.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdatto, Maurice A; Amir, Ruthie; Bhawalkar, Jayant; Sierra, Rafael; Bankowski, Richard; Rozen, Doran; Dierickx, Christine; Lapidoth, Moshe\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEarly methods of tattoo removal ultimately resulted in unacceptable cosmetic outcomes. While the introduction of laser technology was an improvement over the existing chemical, mechanical, and surgical procedures, the use of nonselective tattoo removal with carbon dioxide and argon lasers led to scarring. Q-switched lasers with nanosecond (10-9) pulse domains were considered to have revolutionized tattoo treatment, by selectively heating the tattoo particles, while reducing the adverse sequelae to adjacent normal skin. Theoretical considerations of restricting pulse duration, to heat tattoo particles to higher temperatures, proposed the use of sub-nanosecond pulses to target particles with thermal relaxation times lower than the nanosecond pulses in Q-switched lasers. Initial studies demonstrated that picosecond (10-12) pulses were more effective than nanosecond pulses in clearing black tattoos. Advances in picosecond technology led to the development of commercially available lasers, incorporating several different wavelengths, to further refine pigment targeting. Â© 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.\n\nPulsed photothermal depth profiling of tattoos undergoing laser removal treatment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMilanic, Matija; Majaron, Boris\n\n2012-02-01\n\nPulsed photothermal radiometry (PPTR) allows noninvasive determination of temperature depth profiles induced by pulsed laser irradiation of strongly scattering biological tissues and organs, including human skin. In present study, we evaluate the potential of this technique for investigational characterization and possibly quantitative evaluation of laser tattoo removal. The study involved 5 healthy volunteers (3 males, 2 females), age 20-30 years, undergoing tattoo removal treatment using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. There were four measurement and treatment sessions in total, separated by 2-3 months. Prior to each treatment, PPTR measurements were performed on several tattoo sites and one nearby healthy site in each patient, using a 5 ms Nd:YAG laser at low radiant exposure values and a dedicated radiometric setup. The laser-induced temperature profiles were then reconstructed by applying a custom numerical code. In addition, each tatoo site was documented with a digital camera and measured with a custom colorimetric system (in tristimulus color space), providing an objective evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy to be correlated with our PPTR results. The results show that the laser-induced temperature profile in untreated tattoos is invariably located at a subsurface depth of 300 Î¼m. In tattoo sites that responded well to laser therapy, a significant drop of the temperature peak was observed in the profiles obtained from PPTR record. In several sites that appeared less responsive, as evidenced by colorimetric data, a progressive shift of the temperature profile deeper into the dermis was observed over the course of consecutive laser treatments, indicating that the laser tattoo removal was efficient.\n\nVisualization of laser tattoo removal treatment effects in a mouse model by two-photon microscopy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJang, Won Hyuk; Yoon, Yeoreum; Kim, Wonjoong; Kwon, Soonjae; Lee, Seunghun; Song, Duke; Choi, Jong Woon; Kim, Ki Hean\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLaser tattoo removal is an effective method of eliminating tattoo particles in the skin. However, laser treatment cannot always remove the unwanted tattoo completely, and there are risks of either temporary or permanent side effects. Studies using preclinical animal models could provide detailed information on the effects of laser treatment in the skin, and might help to minimize side effects in clinical practices. In this study, two-photon microscopy (TPM) was used to visualize the laser treatment effects on tattoo particles in both phantom specimens and in vivo mouse models. Fluorescent tattoo ink was used for particle visualization by TPM, and nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) lasers at 532 nm were used for treatment. In phantom specimens, TPM characterized the fragmentation of individual tattoo particles by tracking them before and after the laser treatment. These changes were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). TPM was used to measure the treatment efficiency of the two lasers at different laser fluences. In the mouse model, TPM visualized clusters of tattoo particles in the skin and detected their fragmentation after the laser treatment. Longitudinal TPM imaging observed the migration of cells containing tattoo particles after the laser treatment. These results show that TPM may be useful for the assessment of laser tattoo removal treatment in preclinical studies. PMID:28856046\n\nA retrospective analysis of the influencing factors and complications of Q-switched lasers in tattoo removal in China.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Mengli; Gong, Xiangdong; Lin, Tong; Wu, Qiuju; Ge, Yiping; Huang, Yuqing; Ge, LiYu\n\n2018-04-01\n\nQ-switched (QS) lasers are the gold standard for tattoo removal. The purpose of the present study was to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the efficacy of QS lasers and their associated complications in the removal of tattoos in China. Clinical data of 266 patients were analyzed retrospectively. The tattoo clearance rate was evaluated using the 4-point scale. The Cox regression model was applied to analyze the factors that affected the efficacy of QS lasers in tattoo removal. In addition, treatment-related adverse reactions were analyzed. The results showed that several variables had a statistically significant effect (pÂ <Â 0.05) on the efficacy of QS laser-mediated tattoo removal treatment, including the patients' age, the tattoo's age, type, color, or ink density and the number of treatments. A variety of adverse responses occurred during the laser treatment. The overall incidence of adverse responses was approximately 24.06%, including pigmentation, hypopigmentation, bulla formation, allergic reactions, and skin texture changes or hypertrophic scarring. Some factors may influence the efficacy of QS lasers in the treatment of tattoos and certain adverse reactions may occur during this process.\n\nA novel dualâwavelength, Nd:YAG, picosecondâdomain laser safely and effectively removes multicolor tattoos\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchomacker, Kevin T.; Basilavecchio, Lisa D.; Plugis, Jessica M.; Bhawalkar, Jayant D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground and Objectives Although nanosecondâdomain lasers have been the mainstay of laser tattoo removal for decades, recent disruptive innovations in laser design have introduced a new class of commercial Qâswitched lasers that generate picosecondâdomain pulses. Study A picosecondâdomain, Nd:YAG laser with a KTP frequencyâdoubling crystal was used to treat 31 decorative tattoos in 21 subjects. Safety and effectiveness were determined by blinded evaluation of digital images in this prospective clinical study. Results The average clearance overall as evaluated by blinded observers evaluating randomized digital photographs was 79âÂ±â0.9% (meanâÂ±âsem) after an average of 6.5 treatments. Of the 31 tattoos completing treatment, 6 had evidence of mild hyperâ or hypoâpigmentation by evaluation of photographs. Conclusion The 350 picosecond, 532ânm, and 450 picosecond 1,064ânm Nd:YAG laser is safe and effective for removing decorative tattoos. Lasers Surg. Med. 47:542â548, 2015. Â© 2015 The Authors.

They have been available in the clinical context since 2012. Dermatologists are now using picosecond lasers regularly for the treatment of blue and green pigment tattoo removal. This article reviews the use of picosecond lasers beyond tattoo removal. The overall consensus for the use of picosecond lasers beyond tattoo treatment is positive. With examples of this in the treatment of nevus of Ota, minocycline-induced pigmentation, acne scarring, and rhytides.\n\nAccelerated tattoo removal with acoustic shock wave therapy in conjunction with a picosecond laser.\n\nPubMed\n\nVangipuram, Ramya; Hamill, Selina S; Friedman, Paul M\n\n2018-06-25\n\nConventional tattoo removal consists of single-pass treatments, spaced 7-8 weeks apart, for a total of 7-10 sessions. A major limiting factor of this procedure is the development of cavitation bubbles and vacuoles within the epidermis and dermis that result from the rapid heating of tattoo particles by the laser. While multiple-pass methods using the R20 protocol or the PFD patch enhance tattoo removal through epidermal clearance, they have no effect on deep-intradermal pigment associated vacuoles that arise from treatment with lasers such as the Q-switched laser. A 28-year-old female with Fitzpatrick skin Type V presented for treatment of a 6-year-old professional black tattoo on the left ventral wrist. She underwent three treatment sessions at 6-8 week intervals using a commercial 1,064-nm picosecond Nd:YAG laser (PicoWay; Candela, Wayland, MA) and a perfluorodecalin (PFD) patch (Merz; Raleigh, NC). At each treatment session, she received two passes with 1,064-nm, 4-mm spot size, a fluence ranging from 2.8 to 3.2âJ/cm 2 and a laser repetition rate of 2âHz. Between laser passes and following the final laser pass, the medial portion of the tattoo was treated with acoustic shock wave therapy (ASWT) using the Zwave device (Zimmer Medizin Systems; Irvine, CA) with 90âmJ, 22âHz, and 1,200 pulses. After three treatment sessions, there was 80% clearance of the medial portion of the tattoo that received the ASWT compared with 60% clearance of the lateral portion of the tattoo that was treated with the picosecond 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser and PFD patch alone. In the days following each treatment session, the patient noted consistently less edema, erythema and epidermal crusting on the portion of the tattoo that received the ASWT. We report a case of 80% tattoo clearance with ASWT in a patient with Fitzpatrick type V skin compared with 60% clearance with the picosecond 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser and PFD patch alone. The concurrent use of the PFD patch, which facilitated multi\n\nLasers in tattoo and pigmentation control: role of the PicoSure(Â®) laser system.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorbeck, Richard; Bankowski, Richard; Henize, Sarah; Saedi, Nazanin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe use of picosecond lasers to remove tattoos has greatly improved due to the long-standing outcomes of nanosecond lasers, both clinically and histologically. The first aesthetic picosecond laser available for this use was the PicoSure(Â®) laser system (755/532 nm). Now that a vast amount of research on its use has been conducted, we performed a comprehensive review of the literature to validate the continued application of the PicoSure(Â®) laser system for tattoo removal. A PubMed search was conducted using the term \"picosecond\" combined with \"laser\", \"dermatology\", and \"laser tattoo removal\". A total of 13 articles were identified, and ten of these met the inclusion criteria for this review. The majority of studies showed that picosecond lasers are an effective and safe treatment mode for the removal of tattoo pigments. Several studies also indicated potential novel applications of picosecond lasers in the removal of various tattoo pigments (eg, black, red, and yellow). Adverse effects were generally mild, such as transient hypopigmentation or blister formation, and were rarely more serious, such as scarring and/or textural change. Advancements in laser technologies and their application in cutaneous medicine have revolutionized the field of laser surgery. Computational modeling provides evidence that the optimal pulse durations for tattoo ink removal are in the picosecond domain. It is recommended that the PicoSure(Â®) laser system continue to be used for safe and effective tattoo removal, including for red and yellow pigments.\n\nParadoxical darkening and removal of pink tattoo ink.\n\nPubMed\n\nKirby, William; Kaur, Ravneet Ruby; Desai, Alpesh\n\n2010-06-01\n\nIt is widely accepted that Q-switched lasers are the gold-standard treatment for the resolution of unwanted tattoo ink. Although much safer than other tattoo removal modalities, the treatment of tattoo ink with Q-switched devices may be associated with long-term adverse effects including undesired pigmentary alterations such as tattoo ink darkening. Darkening of tattoo ink is most often reported in cosmetic, flesh-toned, white, peach, and pink tattoos. In this paper, we briefly review a case of pink tattoo ink that initially darkened paradoxically but eventually resolved with continued Q-switched laser treatments.\n\nUse of Q-switched alexandrite laser (755 nm, 100 nsec) for removal of traumatic tattoo of different origins.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoreno-Arias, G A; Casals-Andreu, M; Camps-Fresneda, A\n\n1999-01-01\n\nQ-switched laser systems have been used for removal of tattoo-related carbon, graphite, and other particles. We assessed elimination of traumatic tattoos of different origin with Q-switched alexandrite laser in nine patients. Fluence threshold was determined and a spot test was made. Q-switched alexandrite laser, with a fluence range 4.5-8.0 J/cm(2) (mean, 7.16 +/- 1.18), was used at 4-5-week intervals. Total treatment ranged from 3-12 sessions (mean, 6.1 +/- 3.6 sessions). Double-pulse technique was used in black/black-bluish areas, but single-shot was applied to slate-gray pigment. More than 95% lightening was achieved in five patients after 5.2 +/- 2.3 sessions, and >75% lightening in six subjects after 6.1 +/- 3.1 sessions of treatment. Blacktop, surgical pen, and gravel tattoos presented a better response than gunpowder/fireworks tattoos (>95% vs. 68.7 +/- 23.9% clearance), or tattoos of unknown origin (>95% vs. 62.5 +/- 53% clearance). Epidermal splattering and pinpoint bleeding were observed in one case. No pigmentary alteration or scarring was seen. The Q-switched alexandrite laser is a useful system for removal of traumatic tattoos of diverse origin. The best response (>95% clearance) was achieved in blacktop, surgical pen, and gravel tattoos, although an acceptable degree of lightening may be obtained in tattoos due to gunpowder or fireworks.

This study investigates the potential outcome of using muscle relaxation techniques to reduce pain among people having their tattoos removed with laser treatment. This study consists of 56 participants (mean age 18.1âÂ±â2.1Â years) that had tattoos removed using the principle of selective photothermolysis. These participants underwent muscle relaxation before receiving the laser treatment. Their peripheral skin temperatures (PST) were measured both at the beginning and the end of the muscle relaxation period. Then, the Beck Anxiety Inventory was applied to evaluate anxiety levels. Once the laser treatment was completed, pain levels were measured using a visual analogue scale. A total of 125 person-sessions of laser treatment and psychometric assessments were performed in this study. The muscle relaxation method significantly increased the PST of the participants while reducing the levels of anxiety and pain throughout the course of the laser treatment procedure. The PST, anxiety scores, and pain scores all showed significant correlations with one another. According to the results obtained, this study proposes that muscle relaxation techniques be considered possibly auxiliary treatment options for individuals having tattoos removed through laser treatment. Additional studies with a comparison group and a larger sample size are required in the future to confirm the effectiveness of such intervention.\n\nSimulation of laser-tattoo pigment interaction in a tissue-mimicking phantom using Q-switched and long-pulsed lasers.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, K J; Kim, B J; Cho, S B\n\n2017-08-01\n\nLaser therapy is the treatment of choice in tattoo removal. However, the precise mechanisms of laser-tattoo pigment interactions remain to be evaluated. We evaluated the geometric patterns of laser-tattoo pigment particle interactions using a tattoo pigment-embedded tissue-mimicking (TM) phantom. A Q-switched (QS) neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser was used at settings of 532-, 660-, and 1064-nm wavelengths, single-pulse and quick pulse-to-pulse treatment modes, and spot sizes of 4 and 7 mm. Most of the laser-tattoo interactions in the experimental conditions formed cocoon-shaped or oval photothermal and photoacoustic injury zones, which contained fragmented tattoo particles in various sizes depending on the conditions. In addition, a long-pulsed 755-nm alexandrite laser was used at a spot size of 6 mm and pulse widths of 3, 5, and 10 ms. The finer granular pattern of tattoo destruction was observed in TM phantoms treated with 3- and 5-ms pulse durations compared to those treated with a 10-ms pulse. We outlined various patterns of laser-tattoo pigment interactions in a tattoo-embedded TM phantom to predict macroscopic tattoo and surrounding tissue reactions after laser treatment for tattoo removal.

A total of 40 patients were treated with an Alexandrite picosecond laser in our department from August 2015 to July 2017, with a fluence of 1.96-6.37J/cm 2 , spot size of 2.0-3.6Â mm, and pulse width of 750 ps. Another 32 patients were treated with an Nd:YAG nanosecond laser, with a fluence of 2.80-7.00Â J/cm 2 , spot size of 3Â mm, and pulse width of 5-20 ns. All analysed patients completed at least one treatment and follow-up. The median number of treatment for all the patients was 1 (range, 1-4). After a single session, no difference was found between the two lasers for the eyeliner removal (pÂ >Â 0.05). For the people who achieved an excellent response of tattoo clearance, there was still no difference between the two groups (pÂ >Â 0.05). Transient side effects were observed in two groups, but neither group had significant adverse reactions. To treat blue-black Chinese eyeliner tattoos over 10Â years, Alexandrite picosecond laser does not provide better clearance than the Nd:YAG nanosecond laser.\n\nFractional CO2 laser is as effective as Q-switched ruby laser for the initial treatment of a traumatic tattoo.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeitz, Anna-Theresa; Grunewald, Sonja; Wagner, Justinus A; Simon, Jan C; Paasch, Uwe\n\n2014-12-01\n\nQ-switched laser treatments are considered the standard method for removing both regular and traumatic tattoos. Recently, the removal of tattoo ink using ablative fractional lasers has been reported. Ablative fractional CO2 laser and q-switched ruby laser treatments were used in a split-face mode to compare the safety and efficacy of the two types of laser in removing a traumatic tattoo caused by the explosion of a firework. A male patient suffering from a traumatic tattoo due to explosive deposits in his entire face was subjected to therapy. A series of eleven treatments were performed. The right side of the face was always treated using an ablative fractional CO2 laser, whereas the left side was treated only using a q-switched ruby laser. After a series of eleven treatments, the patient demonstrated a significant lightening on both sides of his traumatic tattoo, with no clinical difference. After the first six treatments, the patient displayed greater lightening on the right side of his face, whereas after another five treatments, the left side of the patient's face appeared lighter. No side effects were reported. In the initial stage of removing the traumatic tattoo, the ablative fractional laser treatment appeared to be as effective as the standard ruby laser therapy. However, from the 6th treatment onward, the ruby laser therapy was more effective. Although ablative fractional CO2 lasers have the potential to remove traumatic tattoos, they remain a second-line treatment option.\n\nA widespread allergic reaction to black tattoo ink caused by laser treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernstein, Eric F\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThis is the first reported case of a local and widespread reaction in a 39 year old woman, to black tattoo ink, induced by Q-switched laser treatment. A 39 year old woman was treated with the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for removal of a decorative tattoo of her lower back. Subsequent to laser treatment, a severe, widespread allergic reaction developed within and surrounding the treated tattoo. Tattoo reactions subsequent to laser treatment should be considered in addition to reactions to topical antibiotics or wound dressings, following laser treatment of tattoos.

It is shown that compared to the single-pulse procedures tattoo removal by series of laser pulses allows not only for reducing the necessary laser fluence, but also for improving the degree of bleaching. The dynamics of formation and dissolution of microscopic gas bubbles in tattooed skin phantoms exposed to laser radiation is also studied. A laser-induced tattoo bleaching mechanism is suggested, based on the process of selective photo-thermolysis of pigmented particles in conditions where the thermal conductivity of the medium surrounding the particles is decreased because of the microbubbles formed therein.\n\nCauses and Recommendations for Unanticipated Ink Retention Following Tattoo Removal Treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Cynthia L.; Desai, Alpesh; Desai, Tejas\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWhile placement of ink into the skin is a long-standing tradition, patients are now seeking tattoo removal on a more frequent basis. Once considered acceptable removal options, tattoo ink removal via physical destruction included dermabrasion, chemical destruction, salabrasion, thermal destruction, and cryotherapy. Now these options are used extremely infrequently. These modalities provided unpredictable results and often required prolonged healing times and left patients with skin discoloration, pain, scarring, and ink retention. Even the widely adopted use of lasers, now considered the gold standard method, offers some level of unpredictability surrounding the natural progression of ink resolution. Multiple factors need to be taken into consideration when successfully removing tattoo pigment including the modalities used, number and frequency of treatments, proper device technique, and physiological barriers to tattoo removal. This paper serves to elucidate the common causes of ink retention following tattoo removal treatment with recommendations on how best to address this relatively common occurrence.

Other modalities may be required to enhance the efficacy and shorten the treatment course. To compare the efficacy of Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser alone versus combination of Q-switched Nd:YAG and Ultrapulse CO2 lasers for eyebrow tattoo removal after a single session. After local anesthesia, the right eyebrow of 20 patients was treated with Ultrapulse CO2 laser with the parameters of 4 J/cm(2) and 3.2 J/cm(2) for the first and the second passes. Both eyebrows were then treated with 1064-nm and 532-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. The spot size and pulse duration were 3 mm and 5 nanoseconds for both wavelengths, and the fluence was 7 J/cm(2) for 1064 nm and 3 J/cm (2) for 532 nm. The side treated with combination of Q-switched Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers improved 75-100% in 6 of 20 patients versus only 1 of 20 in the side treated with Q-switched Nd:YAG alone. Similarly, the right side in 13 of 20 patients showed more than 50% improvement with combination therapy versus the left side (the monotherapy side), where only 6 of 20 cases showed more than 50% improvement. The Mann-Whitney test was 2.85 for the right side and 1.95 for the left side (P value = 0.007). Using Ultra pulse CO2 laser enhances the efficacy of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser in eyebrow tattoo removal.\n\nA continuously variable beam-diameter, high-fluence, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for tattoo removal: comparison of the maximum beam diameter to a standard 4-mm-diameter treatment beam.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernstein, Eric F; Civiok, Jennifer M\n\n2013-12-01\n\nLaser beam diameter affects the depth of laser penetration. Q-switched lasers tend to have smaller maximum spot sizes than other dermatologic lasers, making beam diameter a potentially more significant factor in treatment outcomes. To compare the clinical effect of using the maximum-size treatment beam available for each delivered fluence during laser tattoo removal to a standard 4-mm-diameter treatment beam. Thirteen tattoos were treated in 12 subjects using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser equipped with a treatment beam diameter that was adjustable in 1âmm increments and a setting that would enable the maximally achievable diameter (\"MAX-ON\" setting) with any fluence. Tattoos were randomly bisected and treated on one side with the MAX-ON setting and on the contralateral side with a standard 4-mm-diameter spot (\"MAX-OFF\" setting). Photographs were taken 8 weeks following each treatment and each half-tattoo was evaluated for clearance on a 10-point scale by physicians blinded to the treatment conditions. Tattoo clearance was greater on the side treated with the MAX-ON setting in a statistically significant manner following the 1st through 4th treatments, with the MAX-OFF treatment site approaching the clearance of the MAX-ON treatment site after the 5th and 6th treatments. This high-energy, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with a continuously variable spot-size safely and effectively removes tattoos, with greater removal when using a larger spot-size.

The optimal treatment for removing these pigments remains unknown. To compare the effects of two Q-switched lasers and a short-pulse erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (SP Er:YAG) laser to remove cosmetic tattoos in an animal model. Rats were tattooed using white, flesh-colored, and brown inks (4 bands of each color) on their backs. For each color, one band was left untreated, and one each was treated with a Q-switched neodymium-doped YAG laser, a Q-switched alexandrite laser, and a SP Er:YAG laser every 3 weeks until the pigments were clear. The two Q-switched lasers were equally effective; all three pigments darkened initially and then resolved gradually. Up to 20, 18, and 10 sessions were required to remove white, flesh-colored, and brown tattoos, respectively. Only six sessions were required with the SP Er:YAG laser. Minimal scarring was observed with all lasers. Skin biopsies confirmed pigment granule fragmentation after Q-switched laser treatment and a decrease in the amount of pigment after SP Er:YAG laser treatment. The SP Er:YAG laser was superior to the Q-switched lasers for removing cosmetic tattoos.

The objective was to describe a large sample of French people asking for tattoo laser removal, to investigate their reasons for being tattooed and for tattoo removal, and to identify groups of subjects sharing similar characteristics. A prospective exploratory study was conducted on 151 consecutive subjects asking for tattoo removal. The study population was composed of 65 women and 86 men, aged between 18 and 60 years. The reasons mentioned for tattoo removal included aesthetic, social, employment, family or partner pressure, change of lifestyle or partner and incompatibility with present attitudes and values. Four profiles were identified. Types 1 and 3 correspond to subjects with amateur tattoos more frequently reporting social reasons for tattoo removal, whereas types 2 and 4 correspond to subjects with studio tattoos who more frequently report aesthetic reasons. Types 1 and 4 are mainly composed of men (aged over forty and under forty, respectively), type 2 of women under thirty and type 3 of subjects of either sex aged over forty. These profiles could be used to target information campaigns about tattooing and tattoo removal techniques to avoid unwanted tattoos, and afterwards, possible disappointment after removal, as well as to target education programs on possible health risks. Furthermore, our findings open the way to focus further studies on more homogenous group of tattooed subjects. Â© 2010 The Authors.

A rabbit model was developed to study the Q-switched ruby laser in the treatment of traumatic tattooing. On the backs of white New Zealand rabbits, three 3 cm patches were dermabraded and dressed with carbon black and antibiotic ointment. After a healing period of eight weeks, pre-treatment biopsies were obtained, and the rabbits were treated with the Q- switched ruby laser at various fluence settings with a pulse width of 34 nsec. At set intervals, further biopsies were obtained and studied with light and electron microscopic analysis, and photodocumentation was performed. Grossly, clearance of the tattooed areas was noted in the laser treated specimens. More effective clearance was observed with higher fluence treatment. No infections occurred, and hair regrowth was noted in all cases, though the rate seemed to be altered by laser treatment.\n\nPattern analysis of laser-tattoo interactions for picosecond- and nanosecond-domain 1,064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers in tissue-mimicking phantom.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, Keun Jae; Zheng, Zhenlong; Kwon, Tae Rin; Kim, Beom Joon; Lee, Hye Sun; Cho, Sung Bin\n\n2017-05-08\n\nDuring laser treatment for tattoo removal, pigment chromophores absorb laser energy, resulting in fragmentation of the ink particles via selective photothermolysis. The present study aimed to outline macroscopic laser-tattoo interactions in tissue-mimicking (TM) phantoms treated with picosecond- and nanosecond-domain lasers. Additionally, high-speed cinematographs were captured to visualize time-dependent tattoo-tissue interactions, from laser irradiation to the formation of photothermal and photoacoustic injury zones (PIZs). In all experimental settings using the nanosecond or picosecond laser, tattoo pigments fragmented into coarse particles after a single laser pulse, and further disintegrated into smaller particles that dispersed toward the boundaries of PIZs after repetitive delivery of laser energy. Particles fractured by picosecond treatment were more evenly dispersed throughout PIZs than those fractured by nanosecond treatment. Additionally, picosecond-then-picosecond laser treatment (5-pass-picosecond treatmentâ+â5-pass-picosecond treatment) induced greater disintegration of tattoo particles within PIZs than picosecond-then-nanosecond laser treatment (5-pass-picosecond treatmentâ+â5-pass-nanosecond treatment). High-speed cinematography recorded the formation of PIZs after repeated reflection and propagation of acoustic waves over hundreds of microseconds to a few milliseconds. The present data may be of use in predicting three-dimensional laser-tattoo interactions and associated reactions in surrounding tissue.\n\nClearance of yellow tattoo ink with a novel 532-nm picosecond laser.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlabdulrazzaq, Hamad; Brauer, Jeremy A; Bae, Yoon-Soo; Geronemus, Roy G\n\n2015-04-01\n\nAlthough technology and tattoo removal methods continue to evolve, yellow pigment clearance continues to be challenging and usually unsuccessful. We describe a case series of six tattoos containing yellow ink, successfully treated with a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG 532-nm picosecond laser. Case series with six subjects participating for the treatment of multicolored tattoos that contain yellow pigment. Treatments performed with a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG 532-nm picosecond laser at 6-8 week intervals. One subject achieved complete clearance of the treated site after one session, and five subjects required 2-4 treatments to achieve over 75% clearance. Minimal downtime was experienced, and no scarring or textural skin changes were observed in any of the treated sites. This is the first case series that demonstrates effective and consistent reduction of yellow tattoo ink using a frequency doubled Nd:YAG 532-nm laser with a picosecond pulse duration. Treatments were well tolerated and subjects had positive outcomes. This is a small observational case series from an ongoing clinical trial, and studies with a larger sample size and comparative group are needed in the future.

Picosecond lasers are supposed to be more efficient in clearing tattoos than nanosecond lasers, but prospective comparative data remain limited. To compare on different types of tattoos the efficacy of a nanosecond laser with two types of picosecond lasers. We conducted a prospective randomized study performed from December 2014 to June 2016 on adult patients with all types of tattoos. The tattoos were divided into two halves of equal size. After randomization, half of the tattoo was treated with a picosecond laser and the other half with a nanosecond laser. The evaluation was performed on standardized pictures performed before treatment and 2Â months after the last session, by two physicians, not involved in the treatment, blinded on the type of treatments received. The main end point was a clearance above 75% of the tattoos. A total of 49 patients were included. Professional tattoos represented 85.7%, permanent make-up 8.2% and non-professional tattoo 6.1%. The majority were black or blue and 10.2% were polychromatic. No patient was lost during follow-up. A reduction of 75% or more of the colour intensity was obtained for 33% of the tattoos treated with the picosecond lasers compared to 14% with the nanosecond laser (PÂ =Â 0.008). An improvement superior to 75% was obtained in 34% monochromic black or blue tattoos with the picosecond lasers compared to 9% for the nanosecond laser. Only one of the five polychromic tattoos achieved more than 75% of improvement with the two types of laser. Our results show a statistically significant superiority of the picosecond lasers compared to the nanosecond laser for tattoo clearance. However, they do not show better efficacy for polychromic tattoos and the difference in terms of side-effects was also minimal with a tendency of picosecond\n\nComparison of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser alone versus its combination with ultrapulse CO2 laser for the treatment of black tattoo.\n\nPubMed\n\nVanarase, Mithila; Gautam, Ram Krishan; Arora, Pooja; Bajaj, Sonali; Meena, Neha; Khurana, Ananta\n\n2017-10-01\n\nQ-switched lasers are conventionally used for the treatment of black tattoo. However, they require multiple sittings, and the response may be slow due to competing epidermal pigment in dark skin. To compare the efficacy of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser alone with its combination with ultrapulse CO 2 for the removal of black tattoo. Sixty patients with black tattoo were randomized into two groups viz., group A and group B. Group A was treated with QS Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) alone, and group B received combination of ablative ultrapulse CO 2 followed by fixed-dose QS Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm), at 6-week interval for a maximum of 6 sittings. After each sitting, 3 independent physicians noted percentage of improvement that was evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) and grading system for tattoo ink lightening (TIL). Combination laser (group B) showed statistically significant improvement in mean VAS score in the last 2 noted visits as compared to 1st session (p < 0.007, p < 0.001) and TIL mean score in last three noted visits as compared to 1st session (p < 0.008, p < 0.020, and p < 0.004). There was no statistically significant difference in the side effect profile of both the groups. For refractory professional tattoos, combination of ultrapulse CO 2 laser and QS Nd:YAG laser is superior to QS Nd:YAG laser alone.\n\nFormation of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide upon ruby laser irradiation of the tattoo pigment phthalocyanine blue.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchreiver, Ines; Hutzler, Christoph; Laux, Peter; Berlien, Hans-Peter; Luch, Andreas\n\n2015-08-05\n\nSince laser treatment of tattoos is the favored method for the removing of no longer wanted permanent skin paintings, analytical, biokinetics and toxicological data on the fragmentation pattern of commonly used pigments are urgently required for health safety reasons.

However, bulla formation is a well-known and expected side effect of this novel treatment and causes patient discomfort. To analyze the incidence of bulla formation after tattoo treatment using the combination of the picosecond Alexandrite laser and fractionated CO2 ablation. This is a retrospective chart review to determine the incidence of bulla formation after laser tattoo removal in 95 patients who were treated with either with the picosecond Alexandrite laser alone or in combination with fractional CO2 ablation. Twenty-six patients (32%) treated with the picosecond laser alone experienced blistering, whereas none of the patients treated with the combination of the picosecond laser and fractionated CO2 ablation experienced blistering. The difference in incidence of bulla formation between the 2 groups was found to be statistically significant (p < .05). This study shows a significant decrease in bulla formation associated with tattoo treatment when fractionated CO2 ablation is added to the picosecond Alexandrite laser, which is consistent with observations from a previous case series. This is important because decreasing extensive blistering likely results in increased patient satisfaction and willingness to return for future treatments.\n\nSurgical Removal of lipoma from an area with tattooed skin\n\nPubMed Central\n\nInchingolo, Francesco; Tatullo, Marco; Abenavoli, Fabio M.; Marrelli, Massimo; Inchingolo, Alessio D.; Corelli, Roberto; Servili, Andrea; Inchingolo, Angelo M.; Dipalma, Gianna\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe presence of tattoos on the skin of people of all ages is on the rise. On occasion, the tattoo is in close proximity to an area which has to undergo a surgical operation, therefore why not using the tattoo itself to cover the cicatrix? The case we treated was that of a 39 year old female who, for a couple of years, had a large lipoma on her right shoulder which she never treated because it was beneath a large tattoo. During the surgical treatment of the lipoma, we followed the exact lines of the tattoo itself thus obtaining precise access for lipoma removal which minimized visible post operative cicatrix while maintaining the original tattoo design. No similar case was found in literature.

So far, there was no real control of their use due to the absence of regulations. Some of the tattoo pigments contain carcinogenic amines e.g. azo pigment Red 22. Nowadays, the European Union starts to control the administration of tattoo pigments. There is an interest to obtain information on the intratissue distribution, their interaction with living cells and the extracellular matrix, and the mechanisms behind laser tattoo removal. Multiphoton tomographs are novel biosafety and imaging tools that can provide such information non-invasively and without further labeling. When using the spectral FLIM module, spatially-resolved emission spectra, excitation spectra, and fluorescence lifetimes can pr provided. Multiphoton tomographs are used by all major cosmetic comapanies to test the biosafety of sunscreen nanoparticles.\n\nLong-term evaluation of ink clearance in tattoos with different color intensity using the 1064-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser.\n\nPubMed\n\nMankowska, Agata; Kasprzak, Wojciech; Adamski, Zygmunt\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of tattoo removal treatments using the 1064-nm Q-switched (QS) Nd:YAG laser. Today, QS lasers appear to be the most common, effective, and safest methods to treat unwanted markings. A total of 64 patients with 75 unwanted tattoos were enrolled in the study. Tattoo clearance was evaluated according to the color intensity - concentration of pigment: group I (34) - black; group II (41) - gray. Consideration included methods of tattooing and tattoo techniques. In group I, after the first treatment session the median of clearance was 30% (10-50%), while in group II, the median was 50% (40-70%). After the second treatment session, median in group I increased to 40% (30-50%). Median of group II increased to 70% (50-80%). The highest number of treatment in group I was 7. After that, the median grew to 75%, while the highest amount of treatment in group II was 5 and a median of 90% was achieved. Effects were dependent upon the amount of ink deposited in the tissue. Old amateur tattoos and tattoos containing small quantities of ink (technique: shading and lines) demonstrated the quickest and the most efficacious results. Tattoos with large quantities of ink, obtained by filling, required the greatest number of treatment sessions. The final outcome in tattoo clearing can only be assessed following treatment completion, which may in some cases take 2-3 years. Presumably, in some cases, complete clearance is impossible.

We report a case of tattoo-induced pseudolymphoma, who failed treatment with potent topical and intralesional steroids. She responded well to sequential treatment with ablative fractional resurfacing (AFR) followed by Q-Switched (QS) Nd:YAG 532 nm laser. Interestingly, we managed to document the clearance of her tattoo pigments after laser treatments on histology and would like to highlight the use of special stains such as the Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain as a useful method to assess the presence of tattoo pigment in cases where dense inflammatory infiltrates are present.

The pigments contained in tattoo inks are manufactured for other uses with no established history of safe use in humans and are injected into the skin at high densities (2.5 mg/cm(2)). Tattoo pigments disseminate after tattooing throughout the human body and although some may photodecompose at the injection site by solar or laser light exposure, the extent of transport or photodecomposition under in vivo conditions remains currently unknown. We investigated the transport and photodecomposition of the widely used tattoo Pigment Red 22 (PR 22) following tattooing into SKH-1 mice. The pigment was extracted quantitatively at different times after tattooing. One day after tattooing, the pigment concentration was 186 microg/cm(2) skin. After 42 days, the amount of PR 22 in the skin has decreased by about 32% of the initial value. Exposure of the tattooed skin, 42 days after tattooing, to laser light reduced the amount of PR 22 by about 51% as compared to skin not exposed to laser light. A part of this reduction is as a result of photodecomposition of PR 22 as shown by the detection of corresponding hazardous aromatic amines. Irradiation with solar radiation simulator for 32 days caused a pigment reduction of about 60% and we again assume pigment decomposition in the skin. This study is the first quantitative estimate of the amount of tattoo pigments transported from the skin into the body or decomposed by solar or laser radiation.\n\nDetermination of the thermal and physical properties of black tattoo ink using compound analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHumphries, Alexander; Lister, Tom S; Wright, Philip A; Hughes, Michael P\n\n2013-07-01\n\nDespite the widespread use of laser therapy in the removal of tattoos, comparatively little is known about its mechanism of action. There is a need for an improved understanding of the composition and thermal properties of the tattoo ink in order that simulations of laser therapy may be better informed and treatment parameters optimised. Scanning electron microscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry identified that the relative proportions of the constituent compounds of the ink likely to exist in vivo are the following: carbon black pigment (89Â %), carvacrol (5Â %), eugenol (2Â %), hexenol (3Â %) and propylene glycol (1Â %). Chemical compound property tables identify that changes in phase of these compounds lead to a considerable reduction in the density and thermal conductivity of the ink and an increase in its specific heat as temperature increases. These temperature-dependent values of density, thermal conductivity and specific heat are substantially different to the constant values, derived from water or graphite at a fixed temperature, which have been applied in the simulations of laser therapy as previously described in the literature. Accordingly, the thermal properties of black tattoo ink described in this study provide valuable information that may be used to improve simulations of tattoo laser therapy.\n\nEfficacy of the Q-switched Neodymium: Yttrium Aluminum Garnet Laser in the Treatment of Blue-black Amateur and Professional Tattoos\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLakshmi, Chembolli; Krishnaswamy, Gayathri\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: Q-switched neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm primarily targets dermal melanin and black tattoo ink. Recent studies have shown that this laser is effective in treating black tattoos. There are few studies conducted in India for the same. Aim: The aim was to assess the effectiveness of Q-switched Nd: YAG laser (QSNYL) in the treatment of blue-black tattoos following 3 treatment sessions. Materials and Methods: This study, a prospective interventional study included a total of 12 blue-black tattoos. Following informed consent for the procedure, as well as for photographs, a questionnaire was administered, and improvement perceived by the patient was recorded. In addition, global assessment score (GAS) by a blinded physician was also recorded. Photographs were taken at baseline and at every follow-up. Each patient underwent three treatment sessions with 1064 nm QSNYL at 4â6 weekly intervals. Fluences ranged from 1.8 to 9 J/cm2. The follow-up was done monthly for 4 months from the first treatment session. The response was assessed by patient assessment (PA) and GAS by comparing photographs. Results: After three treatment sessions, although no patient achieved clearance, most patients showed good response with few adverse effects. An average of 64.1% (GAS) and 54.2% (PA) improvement was observed in 12 tattoos. Tattoos more than 10-year-old showed quicker clearing than those less than 10-year-old. Amateur tattoos also showed a better response in comparison to professional tattoos. Conclusion: Totally, 1064 nm QSNYL is safe and effective for lightening blue-black tattoos in pigmented Indian skin. All patients achieved near complete clearance following the continuation of treatment (an average of six sessions) although this was spaced at longer intervals.

Many tattoo image retrieval systems have been described. In a retrieval system tattoo segmentation is an important step for retrieval accuracy since segmentation removes background information in a tattoo image. Existing segmentation methods do not extract the tattoo very well when the background includes textures and color similar to skin tones. In this paper we describe a tattoo segmentation approach by determining skin pixels in regions near the tattoo. In these regions graph-cut segmentation using a skin color model and a visual saliency map is used to find skin pixels. After segmentation we determine which set of skin pixels are connected with each other that form a closed contour including a tattoo. The regions surrounded by the closed contours are considered tattoo regions. Our method segments tattoos well when the background includes textures and color similar to skin.\n\nTreatment of resistant tattoos using a new generation Q-switched Nd:YAG laser: influence of beam profile and spot size on clearance success.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarsai, Syrus; Pfirrmann, Gudrun; Hammes, Stefan; Raulin, Christian\n\n2008-02-01\n\nMultiple treatments of resistant tattoos often result in fibrosis and visible textural changes that lessen response to subsequent treatments. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of beam profile and spot size on clearance rates and side effects in the setting of resistant tattoos. Thirty-six professional, black tattoos (32 patients) were treated unsuccessfully with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (MedLite C3, HoyaConBio Inc., Fremont, CA). Because of therapy resistance all tattoos were re-treated using a new generation Nd:YAG laser (MedLite C6, HoyaConBio Inc.). Maximum energy fluence (E (max)), mean energy fluence, mean spot size, level of clearance, side effects and beam profile (irradiance distribution) of both laser systems were assessed and evaluated in a retrospective study. All tattoos were previously treated with the C3 laser at 1,064 nm using a mean E(max) of 5.8+/-0.8 J/cm(2) (range 3.8-7.5 J/cm(2)) as compared with a mean E(max) of 6.4+/-1.6 J/cm(2) (range 3.2-9.0 J/cm(2)) during the C6 treatment course. Corresponding spot sizes were larger during C6 treatments as compared with C3 (5.0+/-0.9 and 3.6+/-0.2 mm, respectively). The C6 laser had a \"flat top\" and homogenous profile regardless of the spot size. For the C3 laser the beam shape was \"Gaussian,\" and the homogeneity was reduced by numerous micro-spikes and micro-nadirs. After the C6 treatment course 33.3% of the tattoos showed clearance of grade 1 (0-25%), 16.7% of grade 2 (26-50%), 16.7% of grade 3 (51-75%), 30.5% of grade 4 (76-95%), 2.8% of grade 5 (96-100%). The total rate of side effects due to C6 treatment was 8.3% in all tattoos (hyperpigmentation 5.6%, hypopigmentation 2.7%, textural changes/scars 0%). This clinical study documents for the first time the impact of a 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser with a more homogenous beam profile and a larger spot size on the management of resistant tattoos. Only a few treatment sessions were necessary to achieve an additional clearance with a low rate of\n\nApplication of double-layered skin phantoms for optical flow imaging during laser tattoo treatments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Byeong-il; Song, Woosub; Kim, Hyejin; Kang, Hyun Wook\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe feasible application of double-layered skin phantoms was evaluated to identify artificial blood flow with a Doppler optical coherence tomography (DOCT) system for laser tattoo treatments. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used to fabricate the artificial phantoms with flow channels embedded. A double-integrating sphere system with an inverse adding-doubling method quantified both the absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients for epidermis and dermis phantoms. Both OCT and caliper measurements confirmed the double-layered phantom structure (epidermis = 136 Â± 17 Âµm vs. dermis = 3.0 Â± 0.1 mm). The DOCT method demonstrated that high flow rates were associated with high image contrast, visualizing the position and the shape of the flow channel. Application of the channel-embedded skin phantoms in conjunction with DOCT can be a reliable technique to assess dynamic variations in the blood flow during and after laser tattoo treatments.\n\nUnwanted Tattoos\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

An unusual case of QSRL-treatment of a traumatic tattoo composed of firework debris is presented. A young man's traumatic tattoo, composed of firework debris, underwent QSRL ablation at 4-7 J/cm2 (pulse width 5 mm; duration 20 ns). Each test pulse produced visible sparks and focal projectile ejection of skin with pox-like scar formation. Caution is advised when using the QSRL for the treatment of traumatic tattoos composed of potentially combustible debris.\n\nExtensive amalgam tattoo on the alveolar-gingival mucosa.\n\nPubMed\n\nGalletta, Vivian C; Artico, Gabriela; Dal Vechio, Aluana M C; Lemos, Celso A; Migliari, Dante A\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAmalgam tattoos are common exogenous pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa occurring mainly by inadvertent placement of amalgam particles into soft tissues. The diagnosis of amalgam tattoo is simple, usually based on clinical findings associated with presence or history of amalgam fillings removal. Intraoral X-rays may be helpful in detecting amalgam-related radiopacity. In cases where amalgam tattoo cannot be differentiated from other causes of oral pigmentation, a biopsy should be performed. This article deals with an extensive amalgam tattoo lesion which required a biopsy for a definitive diagnosis.\n\nTattoo inks in general usage contain nanoparticles.\n\nPubMed\n\nHÃ¸gsberg, T; Loeschner, K; LÃ¶f, D; Serup, J\n\n2011-12-01\n\nTo our knowledge tattooing has never been thought of as a method of introducing nanoparticles (NPs) into the human body by the intradermal route, and as such it has never been a topic of research in nanotoxicology. The content of NPs in tattoo inks is unknown. To classify the particle sizes in tattoo inks in general usage. The particle size was measured by laser diffraction, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The size of the pigments could be divided into three main classes. The black pigments were the smallest, the white pigments the largest and the coloured pigments had a size in between the two. The vast majority of the tested tattoo inks contained significant amounts of NPs except for the white pigments. The black pigments were almost pure NPs, i.e. particles with at least one dimension <100 nm. The finding of NPs in tattoo inks in general usage is new and may contribute to the understanding of tattoo ink kinetics. How the body responds to NP tattoo pigments should be examined further.

Rising concerns regarding consumer safety, led to legal restrictions on tattoo and permanent make-up (PMU) inks. Restrictions also include bans on certain colourants. Both ink types use organic pigments for colour-giving, plus inorganic pigments for white and black and colour tones. Pigments are only sparingly soluble in common solvents and occur as suspended particles in the ink matrix. Their detection and identification therefore pose a major challenge for laboratories involved in monitoring the legal compliance of tattoo inks and PMU. We overcame this challenge by developing a direct laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry method, which included an easy sample clean up. The method proved to be capable of detecting and identifying organic pigments in almost all of the tested ink samples. Method validation and routine deployment during market surveys showed the method to be fit for purpose. Pigment screening of 396 tattoo inks and 55 PMU taken from the Swiss market between 2009 and 2017 lead to the following conclusions: Pigment variety is much greater in tattoo inks (18) than in PMU (10); four prohibited pigments (Pigment Green 7, Pigment Red 122, Pigment Violet 19 and 23) were found in both ink types; for PMU, these four pigments made up 12% of the pigment findings, compared to 32% for tattoo inks. Therefore, legal compliance of PMU was at a higher level. A comparison of pigments found with those declared on tattoo ink labels clearly showed that banned pigments are rarely declared, but rather masked by listing non present legal pigments and label forging; therefore, highlighting the urgency of widespread market controls.

Intriguingly, there are multiple prejudices in the general population and published data that concern tattooed persons, such as being criminals, having a low education, being alcohol or drug abusers, or more risky in their life style. Objective : To obtain and to evaluate sociodemographic data on tattooed persons, to investigate the incidence of tattoo-related cutaneous complications and to define personal risk factors and course of the persons after being tattooed concerning behavior of personal environment. Patients and Methods : We interviewed 426 participants with already existing tattoos and 20 participants just before getting a new tattoo by using an online questionnaire. The participators were asked about socio-epidemiologic aspects of tattoos in general and special aspects of their own tattoo(s) in particular. There were no exclusion criteria. Results : Tattoos are interesting for people seeking popular body art, esp. university graduates and financially-secure individuals. 446 persons participated in this study. Most of the persons were female with a mean age of 35. Local pruritus around the tattooed area was the most common cutaneous side effect among the participants. 93.5% of the participants did not want a tattoo removal. Intriguingly, most of the participants experienced no career problems related to the tattoo(s). Limitations : The study population is not representative as we included only persons being tattooed prior to or getting newly tattooed. Furthermore, there is a potential selection bias as the participation in this study was voluntary. Only persons that felt involved by the flyer did answer the questionnaire.

At that time, nonspecific thermal damage had been an intrinsic limitation of all commercially available lasers, despite efforts to mitigate this by a variety of compensatory cooling mechanisms. Fifteen years later, experimental picosecond lasers were first reported in the dermatological literature to demonstrate greater efficacy over their nanosecond predecessors in the context of targeted destruction of tattoo ink. Within the last 4 years, more than a decade after those experiments, the first commercially available cutaneous picosecond laser unit became available (Cynosure, Westford, Massachusetts), and several pilot studies have demonstrated its utility in tattoo removal. An experimental picosecond infrared laser has also recently demonstrated a nonthermal tissue ablative capability in soft tissue, bone, and dentin. In this article, we review the published data pertaining to dermatology on picosecond lasers from their initial reports to the present as well as discuss forthcoming technology.\n\n3D printing-assisted fabrication of double-layered optical tissue phantoms for laser tattoo treatments.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Hanna; Hau, Nguyen Trung; Chae, Yu-Gyeong; Lee, Byeong-Il; Kang, Hyun Wook\n\n2016-04-01\n\nArtificial skin phantoms have been developed as an alternative tissue for human skin experiments due to convenient use and easy storage. However, fabricating both thin (â¼100âÎ¼m) epidermis and relatively thick dermis is often cumbersome, and most developed phantoms have hardly reflected specific human skin types. The objective of this study was to fabricate skin phantoms with 3D printing technique to emulate various human skin types (I-VI) along with the corresponding optical and mechanical properties for laser tattoo removal. Both gelatin and agar powders were mixed with coffee and TiO2 particles to fabricate skin phantoms with materials properties for various skin types (I-VI). A 3D printer was employed to precisely control the thickness of each phantom for epidermis and dermis layers. A number of concentrations of the coffee and TiO2 particles were used to determine the degree of absorption and scattering effects in various skin types. The optical properties between 500 and 1,000ânm for the fabricated phantoms were measured by double-integrating spheres with an inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and rheometer were also utilized to evaluate optical (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) and mechanical properties (compression modulus) of the fabricated phantoms, respectively. Visible color inspections presented that the skin phantoms for types I, III, and VI similarly emulated the color space of the human skin types. The optical property measurements demonstrated that the absorption (Î¼a) and reduced scattering (Î¼(s')) coefficients decreased with wavelengths. Compared to the human skin type VI, a dermis phantom represented quite equivalent values of Î¼a and Î¼(s') whereas an epidermis phantom showed up to 30% lower Î¼a but almost identical Î¼(s') over the wavelengths. The OCT measurements confirmed that the thicknesses of the epidermis and the dermis phantoms were measured to be 138.50âÂ±â0.01âÎ¼m and\n\nLaser-tissue interaction studies using a modified alexandrite laser\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaterson, Lorna Menzies\n\nThis thesis forms a detailed study of the alexandrite laser and its potential in the medical field. Applications suggested include dermatological and dental procedures. This body of work encompasses these areas and touches on wider potential applications. A theoretical model has been developed to explain and predict the reaction of tissue to laser light with the wavelength and temporal profile of the alexandrite laser. The interaction of the fundamental 755 nm radiation with a variety of human tissues was initially studied and further studies carried out on porcine liver with long pulse and Q-switched laser pulses. The results were then compared to an analytical theoretical model and also to the standard de Beer's model of an exponential dependence of the light intensity on the attenuation coefficient of the tissue. The presence of a plume of debris was also taken into account. The interaction of the alexandrite laser output with hard dental material was studied. It was observed that 755 and 378 nm (second harmonic) laser light does not significantly affect healthy enamel or dentine. The selective ablation of carious material at 378 nm was observed. A system to photograph a plume of debris leaving an interaction site, with a known time delay from the moment of irradiation, was developed using a frequency doubled, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. This system could be used to measure plume velocities and also to observe the different stages of fast interactions, e.g. the different thresholds for water evaporation and tissue removal in infrared irradiation of water rich tissue. The removal of tattoo pigment by the alexandrite laser light was investigated using excised human tattoo sections. The limited number of samples available showed a clearing of the intradermal pigment and professionally tattooed pig skin was then used as a replacement for excised human tattoo samples. Professional tattoo pigment embedded in agar was used to look at the acoustic waves induced by laser\n\nTattoos\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

We report a rare case of a graphite tattoo on the palate of a 62-year-old patient with a history of pencil injury, compare it with amalgam tattoos, and determine the prevalence of oral tattoos in our Oral Pathology Service. We also compare the clinical and histological findings of grafite and amalgam tattoos. Oral tattoos affect women more frequently in the region of the alveolar ridge. Graphite tattoos occur in younger patients when compared with the amalgam type. Histologically, amalgam lesions represent impregnation of the reticular fibers of vessels and nerves with silver, whereas in cases of graphite tattoos, this impregnation is not observed, but it is common to observe a granulomatous inflammatory response, less evident in cases of amalgam tattoos. Both types of lesions require no treatment, but in some cases a biopsy may be done to rule out melanocytic lesions.\n\nTinea on a Tattoo.\n\nPubMed\n\nOanÅ£Ä, Alexandru; Irimie, Marius\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn the last twenty years, the prevalence of individuals with tattoos in the general population has increased in Europe (1) as well as in Australia (2) and the United States of America (3). A series of complications such as acute inflammatory reactions, allergic contact dermatitis (4,5), photoinduced, lichenoid, and granulomatous reactions (6, 7), pseudolymphoma (8), pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (9), skin infections (6), and skin cancers (10) may occur on tattoos. Infectious complications on tattoos include bacterial infections (pyoderma, leprosy, syphilis, cutaneous tuberculosis, mycobacteriosis) (11-14), viral infections (molluscum contagiosum, warts, herpes simplex, hepatitis B and C) (15-17), and fungal infections (sporotrichosis, dermatophytosis) (18,19). We present the case of a 29-year-old immunocompetent female patient who was consulted for the development of an erythematous-squamous placard that appeared on a tattoo about 18 days after tattooing. Dermatological examination revealed a circular, erythematous, scaly plaque, with centrifugal growth and central resolution, presenting an active, raised, erythematous, vesiculopustular edge, giving the appearance of tinea corporis. The lesion's starting point was on the tattoo in two colors located on the middle third of the left calf and subsequently evolved to beyond the surface of tattoo (Figure 1). No other skin, scalp, or nail lesions were observed. Mycological examination of the material obtained by scraping of the scales and the vesicles from the edges and the surface of the plaque revealed numerous hyphae on direct microscopy examination, and white, flat colonies with a cottony surface and radial grooves developed in Sabouraud dextrose agar culture (Figure 2). Spindle-shaped, thick-walled macroconidia and a few pyriform microconidia were observed on microscopic examinations of the colonies. Based on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, Microsporum canis was identified.

However, not everyone is suited to getting tattooed. Indeed, it is not rare for patients with a chronic skin disease or another systemic condition to be eager to get a tattoo. They perceive tattooing as a harmless, risk-free procedure. Therefore, some patients may not seek medical advice before the procedure. Some also fear a judgmental approach by their physician, who may try to discourage them. Lastly, the tattooist does not have either the training or the education to properly advise a customer about his/her condition. Therefore, it is important that any physician be able to provide adequate counselling regarding the possibility of getting tattooed and under which conditions. Even though an exhaustive list is impossible to address, the main issues include chronic skin disorders, pigmented lesions of the skin, (congenital) heart disease, immunosuppressive diseases and treatments, blood clotting disorders, and pregnancy/breastfeeding.

Tattoo pigments are small particles and may be hypothesized to reach the blood stream and become distributed to peripheral organs. This has not been studied in the past. The aim of the study was to trace tattoo pigments in internal organs in mice extensively tattooed with 2 different tattoo ink products. Three groups of mice were studied, i.e., 10 tattooed black, 10 tattooed red, and 5 untreated controls. They were tattooed on the entire back with commercial tattoo inks, black and red. Mice were sacrificed after 1 year. Samples were isolated from tattooed skin, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, and lung. Samples were examined for deposits of tattoo pigments by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM identified intracellular tattoo pigments in the skin and in lymph nodes. TEM in both groups of tattooed mice showed tattoo pigment deposits in the Kupffer cells in the liver, which is a new observation. TEM detected no pigment in other internal organs. Light microscopy showed dense pigment in the skin and in lymph nodes but not in internal organs. The study demonstrated black and red tattoo pigment deposits in the liver; thus, tattoo pigment distributed from the tattooed skin via the blood stream to this important organ of detoxification. The finding adds a new dimension to tattoo pigment distribution in the body, i.e., as observed via the blood in addition to the lymphatic pathway. Â© 2017 S.

Tattoo ink also has soluble ingredients and contaminants. Pigments can distribute via the lymph and possibly also directly to the blood, and a minute fraction may over time undergo metabolic breakdown and as hapten(s) induce allergic reactions of red tattoos. Carbon black of black tattoos has a tendency to agglomerate and form larger bodies that can elicit foreign body reactions in black tattoos and even granuloma formation with overlap to sarcoidosis in the clinic. Very little is known about the biokinetics and safety profile of the many tattoo pigments in use, and no specific pigment-related chemical of tattoo ink causing identified adverse reactions in humans has been depicted. Inks have many ingredients and contaminants.
