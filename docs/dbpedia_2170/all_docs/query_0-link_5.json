Monarch High School’s searing production of Lost Girl was an immersive exploration of the repercussions of being forgotten.\n\nWinner of the 2018 Kennedy Center Playwrighting Award, Kimberly Belflower’s Lost Girl is a continuation of J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan, recalling Wendy Darling’s trauma and the effects of her time in Neverland. As time goes on, she stays in her second-floor nursery, gazing at the second star from the right, while her mother grapples with her daughter’s distress and friends around her grow up. Told in an incredibly intimate setting, the story’s resonance and underlying message becomes even more stark when watching 5 feet away from the actors.\n\nBringing the titular lost girl to life, Isabella Le Sante (Wendy Darling) embodied her role beautifully. LeSante, who never left the stage, stayed emotive and consistent. Her chemistry with the audience was palpable, conveying a genuine and dark story with grace.\n\nOpening the story with chilling dialogue, Kiana Linares (A), Catherine Hoskins (B), Gabriella Galeno (C) played narrating dolls throughout the show. Voicing the lost girl’s inner thoughts, The ABC Girls created an interesting dynamic, shifting from onlookers to Wendy’s story, to empathizing victims. The trio’s popcorn style of line delivery was well executed, as well as their impressive physicality and stylistic movement.\n\nHailing from Neverland, the Lost Boys served as Wendy’s reminder of what she had lost. The lost boy ensemble played off one another well, notably in scenes with Wendy. Through her comedic timing, Morgan Rens (Toodles) brought levity to tense moments in the show. Phoenix Orival (Slightly) was a standout from the Lost Boys, giving a truthful performance as he attempted to connect with Wendy. Showcasing how time heals, the company brought an important story to life, telling the untold stories of adolescence and abuse. From the shadows of a dark tale, Sofia Nayar (Callie) displayed an in-depth performance of a survivor’s tale, with decisive delivery and acting choices.\n\nTechnically, Lost Girl embraced student driven work. The stage management team called cues promptly and ran a smooth show overall. Lighting, by Samantha Johns and Val Feria, created a star-twinkling atmosphere that when shifted, conveyed a change in energy throughout the theater. The hair and makeup team, led by Gabriella Galeno, created designs that represented the themes of the show and read well onstage. Additionally, the set was well used and helped bring the audience in to highlight the importance of the story.\n\nAlthough sparkles may have dimmed, Monarch High School’s production of Lost Girl brings untold stories out of the shadows, allowing audience members to think about their show for more than 8 minutes a day.”\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Sam Dyer of NSU University School\n\nLove can feel like flying, but what happens when you never land? Balancing childlike wonder with the complexity of romantic trauma, Monarch High School’s production of Lost Girl truly set the bar sky high!\n\nA fairytale focused on faulty imagination, Lost Girl was crafted by Kimberly Belflower. The story was based upon the 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up and its subsequent 1911 novel reworking Peter and Wendy, both penned by playwright J.M. Barrie. Unlike other retellings of Barrie’s work, Belflower chose to focus this adaptation on Wendy Darling, the girl who flies off with Peter Pan, and her quest to retrieve the kiss she gave him in Neverland. Lost Girl was acclaimed by critics upon release and was awarded The Kennedy Center’s Darrell Ayers National Playwriting Award in 2018.\n\nDearest and distraught, the darling Wendy was brought to life by Isabella Le Sante. Her expert delivery across Wendy’s emotional adventure carried an urgent potency, making every word feel like a desperate wish upon a star. Even more impressive were the small choices Le Sante made to amplify her expressions, from anxiously shaking her shoulders to vitriolically scrunching up her nose. Le Sante displayed such profundity that it’s certain audiences will think about her performance for at least eight minutes a day from now on!\n\nAugmenting this woman waiting to be found, other cast members also hooked the audience with their artistry. Such charm could be found in A, B, and C, the storytelling personifications of Wendy’s childhood portrayed by Kiana Linares, Catherine Hoskins, and Gabriella Galeno respectively. With doll-like physicality that opened windows into Wendy’s psyche, all three of these lettered lulus demonstrated mesmerizing synchronization and dedication to their childish characters.\n\nAnother noteworthy portrayal was found in Slightly, the lovestruck Lost Boy played by Phoenix Orival. Promising to support Wendy for the rest of time, Orival packaged both light-hearted warmth and emotional intensity into one stellar performance.\n\nAlong with the captivating cast, there was also true magic to be found in the technical achievement of this production. To foster an immersive intimacy and heighten Bellflower’s text, this production of Lost Girl was staged in the round with actors in proximity of the audience as if they too were watching Wendy’s journey unfold.\n\nWhile this approach provided a unique challenge, the Stage Management team (Laylah Francois and Morgan Swanson) was up to the task! With over a hundred different cues to call, each one was handled with professional precision that never overshadowed the powerful narrative.\n\nEqually enchanting, the perceptive Props team (Val Feria & Crew) soared above the stars! From a bottle of flickering fireflies to a clever inclusion of Peter Pan’s red feather in a book and quill, their work shimmered in the blue like pure pixie dust.\n\nFollowing the second star to the right straight on ‘til morning, the cast and crew of Monarch High School’s production of Lost Girl charted a course destined to reach the hearts of any audience!\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Sydney Lotz of Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS\n\nIn the wake of a moonlit adventure from Neverland, Wendy Darling steps back into the ticking rhythm of the real world and starts to grow up. Join us, for just 8 minutes, to see just how Monarch High School uses a little faith, trust, and pixie dust into their mesmerizing rendition of Lost Girl.\n\nCrafted by Kimberly Belflower, “Lost Girl” intricately weaves threads of J.M. Barrie’s cherished character, Wendy Darling. Amidst the countless cinematic adaptations that have explored Peter Pan’s tale from various angles, this rendition casts a spotlight on Wendy’s perspective. Long after the memory of Peter’s ethereal departure from her bedroom window fades, Wendy resolves to embark on a journey to reunite with him, seeking to reclaim her stolen kiss and, in doing so, rediscover the path to her own onward journey in life.\n\nIsabella Le Sante embodied the role of Wendy with remarkable ease, skillfully employing a range of expressive emotions, nuanced vocal inflections, and adept physicality. Le Sante seamlessly executed outstanding characterization, marked by a convincing sense of naivety throughout the entirety of the production, in which her presence never left. The chemistry between Le Sante and Phoenix Orival, personifying Slightly, was nothing short of exemplary. Together, they artfully navigated the spectrum of their relationship, effortlessly transitioning between moments of humor and profundity with a captivating finesse.\n\nKiana Maria Linares, Catherine Hoskins, and Gabriella Galeno skillfully embodied the doll-like essence of A, B, and C, consistently presenting expressive facials, characterized vocal tones, and captivating narration throughout their entire performance. Collectively, the ensemble of this production adeptly maneuvered through the somber shades of trauma and heartbreak, employing expressive physicality and immersive storytelling. Despite sporadic lapses in character consistency, the overall dedication to delivering a commendable performance in such an intimate setting stands out. The set crew, in particular, crafted and built an immersive audience seating arrangement on the stage, enhancing the interaction and connection between characters and viewers to a profound level.\n\nWith an impressive number of sound and lighting cues, stage managers Laylah Francois and Morgan Swanson flawlessly executed the arduous task of orchestrating synchronized cues, seamlessly transitioning the settings and emotional landscapes of Wendy’s psyche. The lighting team carefully selected a blue color palette, intertwined with spotlights, artfully illuminating Wendy’s inner struggles and revelations. This captivating aesthetic extended beyond the stage, playing a pivotal role in the publicity team’s efforts to engage their community. From hosting lunchtime Kahoots to strategically placing photo ops around the school and creating entertaining social media content, the team successfully fostered community involvement, ultimately achieving the remarkable feat of selling out three shows.\n\nCurious about Wendy’s fate? Monarch High School has the answers to all your burning questions, demonstrating that magic, just like Peter’s enduring shadow, lingers well beyond the final curtain in their production of “Lost Girl.”\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Charlotte Canter of North Broward Preparatory School.\n\nA tinge of magic, the chill of an open window, and the age where everything changes — everything matters. Become immersed in Monarch High School’s enchanting production of Lost Girl as Wendy Darling steps out of the shadows of her nursery to reclaim her kiss — and grows up in the process.\n\nYears following Wendy’s return from Neverland, Lost Girl explores her life after Peter failed to reappear on her windowsill. Written by Kimberly Belflower, the dramatic coming-of-age play was awarded the 2018 Kennedy Center Darrell Ayers National Playwriting Award. Haunted by her memories of Peter Pan, Wendy navigates an adventure of self-discovery, meeting others who were taken to Neverland and struggling to reconcile the magical world she once knew with the realities of adulthood. In Lost Girl, J.M. Barrie’s renowned story continues, yet this time, no pixie dust can conceal the hardships of hurting and healing.\n\nA girl stuck in the past , Isabella Le Sante expertly portrayed the iconic, imaginative Wendy. Le Sante brought extensive depth to the role, with physical choices contributing to the character arc exhibited. The intentionality of her movements was particularly impressive when her back was facing the audience — due to the show being performed in the round — as her emotional intent remained distinct. Le Sante’s facial expressions and vocal inflection synergized to craft a constant vulnerability in her performance, a noteworthy achievement given the extensive time spent on stage. Audiences will need far more than eight minutes to praise Isabella Le Sante’s passionate performance.\n\nAs the loyal, lovesick Slightly, Phoenix Orival excelled. He adeptly showed an expansive range of emotions, bringing laughter with each quippy remark while maintaining the serious tone of the story. Orival’s dynamic with the Lost Boys (Morgan Rens, Emma Alpern, Travis Cousino) was commendable.\n\nThe Lost Girl cast demonstrated distinct individuality while fostering a dark ambiance. As A, B, and C, Kiana Linares, Catherine Hoskins, and Gabriella Galeno should be praised; they maintained consistent characterization, and their chemistry as an ensemble was notable. Although the lack of projection in certain moments made it difficult to hear dialogue, the outstanding storytelling in the immersive yet unconventional space compensated for any discrepancies.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the skill exhibited by the crew of Lost Girl was immense. The props were highly detailed, referencing previous variants of Peter Pan and Wendy’s story. The cues were perfectly timed, and the lighting aided the plot — the execution of Peter’s shadow was especially striking. The makeup team did a fantastic job: the silver highlighter, representing pixie dust, ensured the audience always knew who had journeyed to the second star to the right and straight on ‘til morning.\n\nMonarch High School’s production of Lost Girl leaves all longing for the magic of Foreverland. As Wendy closes the nursery window curtains, bidding Neverland goodbye once and for all, audiences are reminded that to fly, you must first fall.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Abby Goldberg of Cooper City High School.\n\nOne kiss, one adventure, one boy, all only to be thought about in the fleeting span of eight minutes. Monarch High School’s riveting production of Lost Girl, beautifully encapsulates the magic and heartache of a tragic first love.\n\nWritten by Kimberly Belflower, Lost Girl follows characters from the timeless 1900’s tale of Peter Pan. As Wendy Darling struggles to heal from the insurmountable pain of her first love, the world around her appears to effortlessly move on. On a mission to find Peter and reclaim her kiss, Wendy discovers the truths behind embracing change and growing up. Eventually, she learns the power in shutting her window, keeping both feet on the ground, and letting go.\n\nLeading the show with talent and grace was Isabella Le Sante as Wendy. With each nuanced gesture and expression, she masterfully conveyed a powerful range of emotions throughout the production. Le Sante impressively remained on stage throughout the entirety of the 90-minute production, without falter in her energy or emotion. Portraying Slightly, Phoenix Orival skillfully navigated a tapestry of feelings, serving as Wendy’s anchor in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nEmbodying A, B, and C, Kiana Linares, Catherine Hoskins, and Gabriella Galeno worked extremely well together. They each remained consistent, maintaining perfect synchronization throughout. All three actresses played off one another well and enhanced the overall cohesion of the performance. Travis Cousino was absolutely hilarious as Nibs. His comedic timing and humor brought much needed light amidst the moments of darkness.\n\nThe cast as a whole, must be commended for their truly phenomenal performance. Each actor crafted distinct and well-developed characters. The cast also remarkably conquered the difficult task of performing in the round with ease. They impressively remained immersed in each scene and maintained an incredible focus. Their overall portrayal of complex themes and heavy subject matter with vulnerability and grace helped to create an authentic and stellar performance.\n\nThe technical aspects of the show were fantastic. Since the audience was sat extremely close to actors, attention to detail was vital. The stage managers, Laylah Francois and Morgan Swanson, must be applauded, as their timely cues allowed audiences to be immersed into the world of the show. The hair and makeup team, led by Gabriella Galeno, must also be commended as their creative use of glittery makeup showed the lasting effect Neverland has on each person it touched.\n\nThere are two kinds of people in this world, those who shine and those who notice. The cast and crew of Monarch High School’s Lost Girl undeniably shine, captivating audiences who can’t help but notice.\n\n. * * *\n\nReviews of “The Fantasticks at American Heritage School Palm Beach Campus on Wednesday, 12/13/2023..\n\nBy Makayla Whelchel of North Broward Preparatory School\n\nWhat if the thing that’s keeping us apart is actually the only thing holding us together? As wildly wonderful and darkly delicate as a puppet master’s strings, American Heritage Palm Beach asks this question and many more in their production of The Fantasticks.\n\nChildren. Lovers. Fantasticks. Geese. First written in 1960 by Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones, The Fantasticks follows the story of Luisa and Matt, two lovers separated by an impenetrable wall, as they explore a world taut with the puppet strings of their parents and eventually tainted by the light of reality;s unexpectedly bright sun. The story of The Fantasticks weaves together a hopeful, humorous, and utterly honest tale about what it means to break down the dividing walls between us.\n\nWith a tip of his hat and a glint in his eye, Jack Pawlowski’s portrayal of El Gallo was as grand and glorious as the abduction his character so expertly orchestrates. Pawlowski lived in his character, bringing every second alive with deliberate physicality and phenomenal comedic timing that allowed the multifaceted depth of his character to shine through. Abigail Trachtenberg as Luisa likewise delivered a performance as perfectly “not normal” as her character hopes to be. Trachtenberg’s expansive vocal range and total commitment to her character was utterly captivating. Together with Jonathan Jacknow (Matt), the two created a delicate and believable dynamic that grew and changed over the course of the story, and which was furthered by the depth and subtlety of Trachtenber’s and Jacknow’s acting. The moment of reconciliation between the two after Matt returns home was a testament to the talent of these two actors.\n\nFrom Hamlet to Romeo, King Lear to Caesar, there isn’t a role that Henry (Morgan Small) and Mort (Jamie Lauffer) can’t bring to life — or rather, death. From their consistent accents to their spot-on comedic timing, Small and Lauffer created a fantastically funny character dynamic that made the audience’s applause “accelerando con mucho pesto.” Kiara Charles (Bellany) and Evie Price’s (Hucklebee) chemistry was also commendable, as were their difficult harmonies.\n\nAs a whole, the ensemble of The Fantasticks was just as spectacular as the name of the show implies. Although some actors struggled with breath support, vocals as a whole were quite lovely, especially the multilayered harmonies present in more difficult musical numbers. Despite minor dips in energy, the cast completely committed to every onstage moment, including audience interaction led by El Gallo (Jack Pawlowski) and the Mutes (Nicole Miller, Domenick Swanson). Tech only enhanced this show-stopping production, Samuel Artel’s masterful accompaniment riddled with as many memorable moments as the show itself.\n\n“The play is not ended, and the story is never done.” American Heritage Palm Beach’s production of the Fantasticks invoked new faith in the love that ties us together, showing us all that it is never too late to reach across the walls between us and find each other again. Because after all, it was never about the wall in the first place.\n\n. * * *\n\nReviews of Pygmalion at Calvary Christian Academy on Friday, 10/13/2023.\n\nBy Jahanna Galloway of South Plantation High School\n\nRomance? Authentic characters? Organic humor? And an interesting plot that ties it all together? What more could you want in a show! Calvary Christian Academy’s production of “Pygmalion” is a humorous-yet-layered love story that truly unfolds in five acts.\n\nTaking inspiration from Greek mythology, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote “Pygmalion” in 1912 and transformed the tale of a man falling in love with his own creation. A year later, the first production of “Pygmalion” was performed in German at the Hofburg Theatre, and the English premiere took place the following year at His Majesty’s Theatre. The story follows Henry Higgins, a famous linguist obsessed with accents. Accompanied by Colonel Pickering, who is also known for his work in linguistics, these men take on the formidable task of passing off a young woman by the name of Eliza, who lives in poverty and has a Cockney accent, as a well-spoken duchess.\n\nWhile suffering from some issues with diction, Calvary Christian’s adaptation of “Pygmalion” is charming, hilarious, and carried by its strong and interesting characters that never break or lose authenticity during the course of the play. Putting on an effortlessly clever and witty performance, Jesse Joel Oliva, playing Henry Higgins, captures the audience’s attention with his fast-paced dialogue and punctual humor. Elisabeth Chew, playing Eliza Doolittle, does an incredible amount of work maintaining such an authentic Cockney accent throughout the first two acts and then gracefully transitions into an elegant British accent after intermission.\n\nNot to leave out any outstanding actors, Emma Bruce, who plays Henry Higgins’ mother (Mrs. Higgins), is able to be such a vocal and entertaining character while also being able to exhibit the restraint you would expect from an upper-class woman from the time period. Another hidden gem amongst the characters is Mrs. Pearce, played by Emma Glashower. While not being in the play nearly enough, Emma’s comedic timing as well as her ability to play off her fellow cast members is remarkable.\n\nIt is difficult to talk about the production without mentioning the meticulous attention to detail when it comes to the set. Everything from the luxurious-looking chairs to the smaller items, such as the phonograph, seem as though they came right out of the early-1900s. The costume designs are also very detailed and appropriate for the time. The costumes are also a well-thought out way to show the character changes that go on throughout the show. For instance, Eliza, in the beginning, dons more drab clothing as she lives in poverty, but towards the end, she wears refined and elegant dresses, signifying the character transformation that Eliza goes through.\n\nIn the end, Calvary Christian Academy has truly put on quite the production. From the first act, the audience is able to see every ounce of passion that went into the acting and the technical aspects. Now go see this bloody amazing show!\n\n. * * *\n\nReviews of Company at Boca Raton Community High School on Friday, 11/03/2023\n\nBy Olivia Allen of Coral Springs High School\n\nHere’s to the ladies who lunch — and Boca Raton Community High School’s production of Company! If you want a fun filled show with laughs and maybe some tears, Have I got the (show) for you!\n\nBased on a book of the same name by George Furth, Company was adapted for stage with music and lyrics by the renowned Stephen Sondheim. Its first production was in 1970 and it won six Tonys. The plot follows a non linear narrative and is strung together with the themes of marriage and love as the main character, Robert, takes a peek into the lives of his married friends.\n\nIn the role of Robert, Austin Tindell stood out with his lovable personality and charming demeanor. His vocals were strong and the chemistry he had with every character led the show to having an air of authenticity. Despite being the sole main lead in the show, Tindell had no problem commanding the stage and staying entertaining throughout.\n\nMia Salerno’s delivery of the frantic indecisive Amy was a joy to experience. Their use of body language and character choices set them apart. This is represented best in their performance of Getting Married Today, an insanely difficult song to pull off yet they did excellently! Harry, played by Antonio Saladino, was also a highlight of the show. His line delivery and acting was amusing and felt natural which paired well with his steady vocals.\n\nThe ensemble was just a joy to watch. Every time the characters were seen on stage together, it really brought the show to life. Some of the dancers left little to be desired, but it was made up for by continuously strong and powerful harmonies upheld by the entire cast. A noteworthy feat for a Sondheim production!\n\nThe show has a concept of organized chaos which the set encapsulates perfectly. The bar at the rear of the stage had a four-colored spread of diamonds, some with shadow some without, cleverly representing each of the couples and their struggles. The set also features separable moving chairs with the same four colors in more of a chaotic pattern. The color blocking reflects the time period and also serves as a way to fill more space on the stage, which is a feeling you want when the show revolves around the idea of Company.\n\nBoca Raton Community High School’s production of Company is a joyous show that runs through the complex topics of love, marriage, divorce, and even just Being Alive!\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Sofia Fernandez of Calvary Christian Academy\n\nStop over on your way home! Drop by anytime! We’ll be so glad to see you at Boca Raton Community High School’s production of Company!\n\nWritten by George Furth with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Company was an award-winning sensation that received six Tony awards. It premiered at the Shubert Theatre in Boston on March 24, 1970, and made its Broadway debut at the Alvin Theatre a month later. This concept musical is a composition of several vignettes that follows the love life (or lack thereof) of Robert as he navigates the struggles of singleness while surrounded by all of his married friends.\n\nWho better to keep you company than Austin Tindell as Robert? His performance brought this charming and charismatic character to life. This role specifically highlighted his incredible vocal abilities where songs such as Marry Me a Little and Being Alive showcased his powerful belts and clean falsettos. Portraying some of “those good and crazy people” he calls his friends, Antonio Saladino (Harry) and Claudia Hammes (Sarah) had excellent chemistry and comedic timing together. Their coordinated karate sequence during The Little Things You Do Together specifically exemplified this couple’s playful dynamic.\n\nEverybody rise for Nisa Guvenilir and her toast-worthy rendition of Joanna! Her mannerisms were elegant and sophisticated, portraying her character with confidence and poise. Vocally, her range was astounding, particularly in her song The Ladies Who Lunch. Jasmine Massari also had an exceptional vocal performance in the role of Jenny. Her airy and angelic voice shone in her solos in Getting Married Today and in the higher harmonies of group numbers.\n\nAs a cast, The Company distinctly developed each of their characters to create a unique yet cohesive ensemble. Each individual showed immense commitment to their roles with high energy levels throughout the entirety of the show. The expertise of their performance was best featured through their vocals where each harmony was crisp and blended beautifully. Although the pacing was occasionally slow, their dedication and consistent engagement allowed the audience to feel immersed in their performance.\n\n“Phone rings, door chimes”, here comes stage manager Freddy Cycholl calling all the cues to perfection! The light cues specifically were thoughtfully designed to match the color scheme and mood of each scene. The same hues showcased in the lights were incorporated into the set design through wall decorations and furniture to create a more home-like environment. Finally, student choreographer Claudia Hammes impressively choreographed several dance sequences and showcased her advanced dancing techniques in the dance number Tick Tock. One could have no greater birthday wish than having such a fabulous crew!\n\nSo even when all the candles are blown out and the surprise parties come to an end, Boca Raton Community High School’s production of Company encourages their audience to cherish the company of the ones they love the most and celebrate everything that comes with “being alive.”\n\n. * * *\n\nReviews of Chicago at Cypress Bay High School on Thursday, 3/07/2024.\n\nBy Anthony Costanzo of Dillard Center for the Arts\n\nStrut into the alluring world of swinging jazz, electrifying dance, and violent crime with Chicago: Teen Edition.’ Prepare to be razzled, dazzled, and all that jazz as Cypress Bay High School takes to the stands.\n\nNow for eyewitness testimonies with lyricist Fred Ebb, Composer John Kander, and legendary Director/Choreographer Bob Fosse. “Chicago takes a satirical look at justice and fame during prohibition era Chicago with a stylish vaudeville frame. The production opened on Broadway on June 3rd of 1975 at the 46th Street Theatre where it would remain till August 27th,1977. The show was revived in 1996 and is still the second longest-running show on Broadway with over 10,000 performances. In 2002, they made a picture out of the spectacle and it was a hit, winning 6 Academy Awards including best picture. With such a popular production, it wasn’t long till the Teen Edition arrived for high schools to put on a less scandalous adult story of scandals and adultery.\n\nOnto a compelling deposition delivered by our dastardly diva Roxie Hart (Martina Rodriguez). Rodriguez delivers a phenomenal performance perfectly capturing the unhinged essence of Roxie with her physicality and emotion, all with a voice so fantastic it must be a crime. On the subject of criminally irresistible voices, representing the defense tonight is Billy Flynn (Miguel Cabrera). But he wasn’t just a good voice, Cabrera brought a certain charm and flair to this role that could win over any crowd. The pair absolutely excelled alongside the ensemble, which flawlessly executed every step choreographed by Cabrera and Gabbi Bongiovi in the number We Both Reached for the Gun. Calling a loveable dope to the stand, Amos Hart (Yoah Dahan) was hilarious. Dahan had wonderful expressions and body language. Dahan’s interactions with the rest of the cast were also a blast, clearly showing how well Dahan understood his character. The last witness takes the stand: the vaudevillianess h\n\nerself Velma Kelly (Julia Poms). Poms‘s dancing was enchanting despite challenging choreography. Pom was performing beautifully while singing as well.\n\nNow for a closing statement from the masterminds behind this whole operation. The stage manager Stefanny Hamburger ran a tight ship resolving any minor issues quickly and quietly. The prop team led by Victoria Shand and Joey Mejiah had wonderful and accurate props including one newspaper with Roxie’s picture in it. The sound had some issues picking up certain actors, but the show was mixed very well overall.\n\nThe jury’s made their decision and Chicago: Teen Edition.’ at Cypress Bay High School has been found … it appears they’ve left to chase the next story. Well, who needs them — overall the production was a spectacular one-of-a-kind experience, court is adjourned.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Kenny Gervais of Cooper City High School\n\nPop! Six! Squish! Uh-huh!

Cypress Bay High School’s dazzling production of Chicago shares accounts of murder and lies while following themes of fame, manipulation, corruption and All That Jazz.\n\nSet in the bustling city of Chicago in the 1920’s, this satirical musical futures music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb and book by Ebb and Bob Fosse. Based on real murders and trials, Chicago follows wannabe showgirl Roxie Hart after she murders her lover in cold blood. When she turns to her husband for cover and is betrayed, Roxie is thrown into the Cook County Jail, where fame buys you a quicker court date. Deception becomes a daily routine in a Cell Block Tango for media attention.\n\nThe name on everybody’s lips is gonna be Martina Rodriguez for her stellar performance as Roxie Hart. Rodriguez wonderfully executed Roxie’s iconic ditzy blonde personality while still maintaining the intensity of the show. Portraying the murderous starlet, Julia Poms gave a glamorous rendition of the narcissistic Velma Kelly. Poms’ impressive dancing ability shined onstage through her sharp movements and flexibility. Her expertise was evident through every tango and fosse. Together, Rodriguez and Poms’ chemistry splendidly built the rivalry between the two girls in their fight for the limelight.\n\nCamera’s flash and reporters crowd at the sight of Miguel Cabrera in his performance as Chicago’s best criminal lawyer, Billy Flynn. Cabrera expertly implemented his triple threat abilities, especially through his audacious stage presence. Proving that When You’re Good to Mama any favor can come true, Julia Amigorena captivated audiences through her fantastic performance as the corrupt matron Mama Morton. Amigorena’s stellar vocals in her principal number made her a standout member of the production.\n\nThe ensemble is to be applauded for a killer performance! Although there were some issues with sound, the cast persevered and projected loudly to ensure they were heard by the audience. The Six Merry Murder Mistresses ensemble were cohesive and concise in their performance. Their breathtaking dancing and execution in Cell Block Tango established the relationships between the girls exquisitely. A notable performer was Neena Shaw as June. Shaw’s fluid dancing ability allowed her to dominate the stage with every hip, kick, and drop.\n\nThe technical aspects of this production gave it the old Razzle Dazzle. They showed extreme attention to detail and time period research was evident through specialized props (such as a newspaper with the cast member on it) and costumes such as Roxie’s court dress. Choreography expertly crafted by Miguel Cabrera and Gabbi Bongiovi grouped cast members together effectively in group numbers such as We Both Reached for the Gun and All That Jazz.\n\nCypress Bay High School pleads guilty to a breathtaking production of Chicago. Full of action, drama and comedy, it would simply be a crime to miss.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Sophie Simon of American Heritage Broward Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You’re about to read a review that tells of a musical full of murder, greed, corruption, violence, exploitation, and, last but certainly not least, talent! Cypress Bay High School’s production of Chicago: Teen Edition was so captivating, it’s almost criminal!\n\nWith music and lyrics by the dynamic, death-dealing duo, Kander and Ebb, Chicago has become a comfortable resident on the Great White Way, becoming the second longest-running show on Broadway in 2014. Showing teenagers that they too can Cell Block Tango, Concord Theatricals adapted the Tony-winning musical into Chicago: Teen Edition. As the curtain rises on a roaring twenties Chicago stage, the audience finds themselves locked up between Roxie Hart’s murder, her attempt to frame her husband, and her fight for freedom.\n\nThe name on everybody’s lips is gonna be Martina Rodriguez! Rodriguez’s portrayal of the not-so-righteous Roxie Hart was lethally illustrious. Equipped with delicate vocals and acting fit for the vaudeville age, Rodriguez had the audience falling at her silver shoes (with the rhinestone buckles, of course). In Roxie’s journey from innocence to infamy, she realizes that [She] Can’t Do It Alone. Enter Velma Kelly: fierce, fearless, and All That Jazz. Julia Poms’s take on Velma Kelly was striking, with clean Fosse jazz hands and astounding flexibility and vocal stamina as evidence.\n\nNo Merry Murderess would be complete without a lawyer pulling the strings. Miguel Cabrera as Billy Flynn was alluring and displayed a commanding stage presence! While he might not be Mr. Razzle Dazzle, Mr. Cellophane is sure to swell your hearts! Andy — I mean, Amos Hart, played by Yoav Dahan, was equally comedic and charming. Whether trapped behind the curtain or stuck with silence as exit music, Dahan’s performance was the furthest thing from see-through. Bailiff, bring in the defendants. These Cook County convicts, consisting of Gabbi Bongiovi, Mya Wolf, Neena Shaw, Isabel Rodarte, and Samantha Garcia, showed versatility in dance styles and portrayal of multiple characters. An uncommitted ensemble? Not guilty!\n\nUnlike Billy Flynn, All I Care About is tech! Orchestrating this fatally flawless production, Stage Manager Stefani Hamburger Tellez called consistent cues and ensured that no cast or crew member was caught red-handed. Taking part as both the brains and ballerinas of this operation, Miguel Cabrera and Gabbi Bongiovi’s choreography was made for 42nd Street! Incorporating shoulders fit for Fosse, Cabrera, and Bongiovi’s skill can not be acquitted. The publicity team, run by Miguel Cabrera and Victoria Di Lauro, turned TikToks into ticket sales. From a black-and-white-themed Instagram to flash-mob performances on campus, this team let everyone know that it would be a crime to miss their show.\n\nNow, jurors and jailbirds alike. You have heard evidence of a roaring audience and raving reviews following this production of Chicago: Teen Edition, and it is time to reach a verdict. It is clear that if polished performances are a crime, the cast and crew at Cypress Bay High School are found guilty! Case dismissed.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Mia Martinez of American Heritage Broward\n\nBilly Flynn once said Give ’em a show that’s so splendiferous. Row after row will grow vociferous and that’s exactly what Cypress Bay High School delivered. Cypress Bay High School’s captivating production of Chicago: Teen Edition was full of mystery, shimmies and shakes, glamor, and All that Jazz!\n\nThe musical Chicago was created by Bob Fosse, Fred Ebb, and John Kander and was published in 1975. Ever since then the name on everybody’s lips [has been]Roxy with the musical winning both six Tony Awards and five Drama Desk Awards! The musical is set in the Roaring Twenties jazz era in Chicago and in this town murder’s a form of entertainment.\n\nCypress Bay High School did an incredible job giving us the old Razzle Dazzle performing the satirical story of Chicago’s story-hungry reporters and the corrupt system of celebrity criminals surrounding the main murderesses Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart. The main murderess with all the buzz was Velma Kelly until young, blonde, and beautiful Roxie Hart steals not only the spotlight but also the support of the infamous lawyer Billy Flynn and matron Mama Morton, leaving Miss Velma Kelly in an act of desperation.\n\nWho says that murder’s not an art?. Definitely not Roxie Hart because Martina Rodriguez gave a masterful performance portraying the cunning and conceited vaudevillian wannabe Roxie Hart. The line “the audience loves me and I love them” became a reality for Rodriguez as she delivered consistently strong vocals, dancing, and committed comedic acting choices in numbers like We Both Reached for the Gun. However, she simply could not do it alone. This show-stopping number could not be done without the charismatic and calculated character of Billy Flynn skillfully presented by Miguel Cabrera. Cabrera drew audiences in with his confident characterization, vocal stamina, and dancing that perfectly embodied Billy Flynn’s suave nature. Notably, Miguel Cabrera and Gabbi Bonjovi choreographed the production leaving audiences stunned by the eye-catching and intricate Fosse-inspired choreography in numbers like Cell Block Tango.\n\nMama Morton’s motto “The system called reciprocity” proved successful during this performance! Mama Morton played by Julia Amigorena commanded the audience’s attention with her powerful vocals in When You’re Good to Mama proving the more energy you give the audience the more you win them over. Julia Poms did an outstanding job as Velma Kelly remarkably performing electrifying dances that never hindered her singing, demonstrating immense stamina in iconic numbers like All That Jazz. Lastly, we can not forget about our Funny Honey Amos Hart or should I say Mr. Cellophane played by Yoav Dahan who stole the audience’s heart with his sincere portrayal of Amos’ innocence and loyalty, especially with his exceptional vocals in these musical numbers.\n\nAs Amos said “I hope I didn’t take up too much of your time,” but before the final curtain closes it must be said one last time that Cypress Bay High School’s production of Chicago: Teen Edition had all the latest news, charm, and talent to make it big in any city!\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Mia Wilson of Cooper City High School\n\nCypress Bay High School’s amazing production of Chicago was complete with revenge, revolvers, and Razzle Dazzle!.\n\nFrom the minds of Fred Ebb, John Kander, and Bob Fosse in 1975, this iconic and engaging show encompasses the unique jazz style of the 1920s and the atmosphere of the bustling city of Chicago. Chicago follows the story of Roxie Hart when she gets caught for murdering her secret lover. As she strives to enter the spotlight to gain support from the press and jury, her dreams of becoming a showgirl gets closer to becoming a reality.\n\nMartina Rodriguez (Roxie Hart) displayed incredible characterization through her charismatic role as the iconic murderess. Her mannerisms as she interacted with the other members of the cast stayed consistent throughout the performance. Her chemistry with her on-stage husband, Yoav Dahan (Amos Hart), showed their dynamic perfectly. Dahan’s vocal inflection and outstanding commitment made him unforgettable.\n\nMiguel Cabrera (Billy Flynn) had a fantastic stage presence that perfectly encompassed his character. His role as a choreographer truly showed as he danced wonderfully without missing a beat. Another performer who showcased incredible dance ability was Julia Poms (Velma Kelly). Her flawless execution of choreography throughout the entire show paired with her outstanding vocals exhibited her impressive stamina and breath control. Despite some mic issues her lines were heard clearly, demonstrating her ability to project.\n\nThe ensemble of this production was very talented, displayed through their beautiful blend of harmonies and powerful dance numbers. They also were extremely reactive through their facial expressions creating a captivating atmosphere. A standout member of the ensemble was Julia Amigorena (Mama Morton) who had perfect pitch throughout her performance of When You’re Good to Mama. Her strong voice and physicality allowed the power of her persona to shine through. Other performers who wowed the audience were Gabbi Bongiovi, Mya Wolf, Neena Shaw, Isabel Rodarte, and Samantha Garcia. Their performance in Cell Block Tango, with the addition of Poms, showed stunning technique and precision. Each actress individually was expressive and unique while also having unity as a whole.\n\nThe technical achievements of the crew truly brought this show to life. The intricate choreography by Cabrera and Bongiovi was extremely impressive showcasing their knowledge of the iconic Fosse style and 1920s jazz. Their ability to create formations and beautiful images on stage complemented the true nature of the show. The costumes by Neena Shaw and Sofia Di Lauro created many different versatile characters and had extreme attention to detail. This team also executed many quick changes throughout the show which made transitions appear seamless. The set by Alex Gomez, Samantha Garcia, and Julia Amigorena created a setting that transformed the space into many diverse locations from the courtroom to the stage.\n\nOverall, Cypress Bay High School’s production of Chicago was an astonishing show with sparkle, pizzazz, and All That Jazz!\n\n. * * *\n\nReviews of Mamma Mia at West Boca Raton High School on Thursday, 3/07/2024.\n\nBy Shaiden Tamim of AW Dreyfoos School of the Arts\n\nIn a whirlwind of ABBA-inspired energy, West Boca Raton Community High School’s rendition of “Mamma Mia” sizzles with talent, charm, and infectious joy that’ll have you dancing in the aisles from start to finish.\n\nSet against the idyllic backdrop of a Greek island paradise, “Mamma Mia” weaves a tale of love, laughter, and unexpected twists as Sophie Sheridan (Gabriela Estabrook) embarks on a quest to discover her father’s identity before her wedding.

Become immersed in a tale of finding oneself and the bond of family, as West Boca Raton High School’s production of Mamma Mia! ignites a fire within every soul.\n\nSince its debut on London’s West End in 1999, “Mamma Mia!” has captured audiences worldwide, evolving into a cultural phenomenon. With a book by Catherine Johnson and music by the iconic Swedish pop group ABBA, this jukebox musical unfolds on the enchanting fictional Greek island of Kalokairi, exploring the nature of unconventional family dynamics. At its heart are Donna and Sophie, a close-knit mother-daughter duo. However, tensions arise between them as Sophie’s impending wedding reignites her desire to uncover the truth about her paternity, wishing her father would walk her down the aisle. When three remnants of her past arrive on the little island, Donna must confront her history before her daughter slips through her fingers.\n\nAs an icon of female independence Marni Gass expertly portrayed Donna Sheridan, the former lead singer of Donna and Dynamos. Gass’s vocals were flawless, with profound range and maturity — particularly impressive in her act two solo, The Winner Takes it All. Her execution of a grand character arc and chemistry with on-stage daughter Gabriella Estabrook, who portrayed Sophie Sheridan, was noteworthy. As a duo, their dynamic was intimate and passionate, culminating in a tear-jerking rendition of Slipping Through My Fingers. Estabrook shined as the exuberant bride-to-be. Her vocal scope was expansive, coupled with a bright, clear tone, and her expert use of facial expressions aided her embodiment of the character.\n\nBeyond the guise of being a successful architect, Lucas Brown brought layers of depth to his characterization of Sam Carmichael. Brown displayed unwavering commitment, engagement, and exuberant energy. His vocal skill was vast, explicit in the act two ballad, Knowing Me, Knowing You. Due to the emotional depth and vocal virtuosity exhibited, it was a standout. Marcos Ortiz-Marrero excelled in his portrayal of “headbanger” Harry Bright. His use of physicality and witty line delivery amplified the comedic element of the production.\n\nThe Mamma Mia! ensemble effectively enhanced the plot while maintaining individual characterization.

The costumes were cohesive, with residents of the island maintaining a beachy, disco aesthetic while tourists, such as Tanya (Julia Gonzalez), starkly contrasted in bright-colored attire and stilettos. The publicity team should be praised for their successful financial campaign and execution of engaging Instagram takeovers.\n\nIf you have a dream and a song to sing, West Boca Raton High School’s rendition of Mamma Mia! certainly exceeds the wonder of a fairy tale. As wedding bells ring, audiences yearn to embrace their inner super trouper, feeling like a number one.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Sofia Palhano of Coral Springs High School\n\nTake A Chance on West Boca Theatre Arts Academy’s production of Mamma Mia as they lay all their love on the stage!\n\nWith a book by Catherine Johnson and music based on ABBA’s discography, Mamma Mia premiered on April 6, 1999, at the Prince Edward Theater in London. On July 18, 2008, the stage show was adapted into a movie. The story takes place on a Greek Island, where 20-year-old Sophie is planning a wedding with her beloved Sky. All she wants is to walk down the aisle with her father, but there’s a problem; she doesn’t know who he is. She finds her mother’s diary and discovers three past lovers that could potentially be her father, so she invites them all to her wedding.\n\nHoney, Honey, how Gabriella Estabrook thrilled the crowd with her outstanding performance as Sophie Sheridan!

She took the viewers along on her journey of emotions as she faced the problems that lay ahead.\n\nSophie can’t have a wedding without her dear fiance, Sky, played by Jaden Blanco. Blanco brought to life the silly yet intimate persona of his character. His vocal range and execution were impressive, as well as the connection he had with his cherished Sophie. He wasn’t the only lover who shone on stage because Lucas Brown as Sam Carmichael dazzled the stage in his sparkly jumpsuit. Brown showed astonishing vocal clarity and characterization. He was constantly acting and reacting to everything around him, leaving no dull moment when he was on stage!\n\nHelping the audience immerse themselves in the reality of the characters is the tech crew. Prop Designer Cindy Jacob and Prop Director Valerie Joy did an excellent job of finding and creating appropriate props that further helped the actors carry out the story. Props like Donna’s diary played a crucial role in the plot. Costume designers Lisa Lubinsky and Kelsey Bonner did a phenomenal job with the cast’s wardrobe. One song where the costumes were memorable was Under Attack because their circus attire helped indicate that the events occurring were a dream.

They were the real Super Troupers!\n\nThank You For The Music that was given to us by West Boca Theatre Arts Academy’s production of Mamma Mia!

One of Sophie’s fathers, Sam Carmichael (played by Lucas Brown), was another amazing singer and a phenomenal actor. Vocals were an extremely integral part of the show, so for that one must say Thank You For the Music!\n\nDonna’s dynamo counterparts Rosie (Rachel Sadow) and Tanya (Julia Gonzalez) had incredible chemistry and comedic timing, especially in Chiquitita when they comfort Donna as she stresses over the arrival of her daughter’s three potential fathers. Speaking of Sophie’s fathers, Bill Austin, played by Isaac Lynne, and Marcos Ortiz-Marrero as Harry Bright were hilarious! They both portrayed their characters very well and created clear and clever distinctions between the three fathers through mediums like accents. Of course, the show would not have been complete without the Islanders ensemble who all maintained their energy throughout the show, creating a dynamic background without removing focus from the scene. They executed complicated choreography exceedingly well and with electric energy like a true Dancing Queen.\n\nThe set was very well designed and versatile, allowing for the use of the stage in large numbers to look less crowded. Numbers such as Mamma Mia! where doors and windows were constantly opened and shut showed the set’s functionality. Costumes were very well chosen for the setting of the show, and only a few felt out of place or did not fit the character wearing them. Stage management for this show must be commended for their efficient set changes during blackouts. The storyline was even creatively worked into set changes as cast members set up for the wedding while moving set pieces into their places, creating a very natural and flowy feel.\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You, knowing that West Boca High School’s Mamma Mia! was a smash hit through its cast members’ robust voices, the ever-intriguing choreography, and beautiful set elements.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Yael Eliani of David Posnack Jewish Day School\n\nLook at what the tide washed in!

As the wedding day approaches, secrets are revealed, relationships are tested, and Sophie learns valuable lessons about love, family, and self-discovery.\n\nIn her starring role, Gabriella Estabrook as Sophie Sheridan commanded the stage with her bubbly, sweet characterization and princess-like vocals. She had great chemistry with her fellow actors and really encapsulated the character well. Beside her, Marni Gass as Donna had an extremely powerful voice, which was amazingly demonstrated in solos like The Winner Takes It All. Alongside the mother-daughter duo were the 3 fathers: Marcos Ortiz-Marrero as Harry Bright, Isaac Lynne as Bill Austin, and Lucas Brown as Sam Carmichael. Each provided a great differentiation to their characters and relationships with their possible daughter. Ortiz-Marrero must be commended for his incredible accent work, comedic timing, and amazing vocals.\n\nAnother stand-out performance was Julia Gonzalez as Tanya.

Mean Girls was then made into a movie premiering January 8th of 2024. Featuring Cady Heron, a homeschooled girl from Africa, finding herself in a frenzy of cliques in her new high school. Cady finds herself seated next to the apex predator herself, becoming a compliant prey in months.\n\nStarting at the bottom of the food chain, Angelina Kennedy as Cady Heron does an impressive job embodying her role with undeniable vocal talent. “Regina! Regina! Regina!” played by Alanis DeSouza powered through the halls, with great dedication to her character and showcased her acting abilities.\n\nIt’s a Revenge Party with your two best friends: Ella Valente and Oliver Paul as Janis Sarkisian and Damian Hubbard! Valente remained amazingly in character throughout the whole show and wowed the audience with her impeccable vocal quality. Valente also showed great, believable chemistry with Oliver Paul as Damian Hubbard. Paul was a joy and shined a bright light of humor during emotional scenes with his clever comedic timing and impressive dance talent, featured in numbers such as Stop.\n\nThey’re shiny, fake, and hard: they’re The Plastics! The trio dominated the stage as a force to be reckoned with. All three actresses did an amazing job working together in their respective roles. As well as the Dance Team who nailed every dance thrown their way, livening up the stage with high energy and character dedication most notably in songs such as Whose House Is This?\n\nI See Stars with the lighting design by Nicholas Eichner, who did a beautiful job at encapsulating the mood of the scene. The choreographers Zara Dautruche and Zoe Schwartzberg left the audience roaring with applause after every big number, such as Sexy, creating impressive choreography for nearly every song. Beautiful harmonies echoed throughout the stage with phenomenal vocal direction by Sydney Lotz, who powered through teaching regardless of any setbacks.\n\nWhether you belong with the mathletes or the art freaks, the audience left Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Stupid With Love with their wonderful production of Mean Girls!\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Avia Collymore of Coral Glades High School.\n\nIn the Wild-Wild-North Shore, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s Mean Girls: HS Edition shows that the line between the jungle and high school isn’t as thick as it seems.\n\nFrom the mind of Tina Fey, who wrote this story after reading Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman, Mean Girls was originally a teen comedy film directed by Mark Waters. It later gained its musical adaptation that was released at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. on October 31, 2017. It was nominated for twelve awards at the 72nd Tony Awards, including Best Musical. It has recently received a film adaptation which premiered on January 8, 2024. The show follows Cady Heron, who moves away from Kenya and into the hands of North Shore High, an American high school with cliques and drama alike, and discovers the truth about where she belongs.\n\nPlaying Cady Heron, Angelina Kennedy showed great talent in her performance. As we watched Cady slowly transition from the math-loving new girl into the newest member of the Plastics, her changes in tone and body language were evident as she seamlessly maintained both personalities.

As Dance Captain, Fronstin showed acumen in her lively performances, seamlessly bringing an abundance of enthusiasm to the production. Zara Dautruche, who is also in the Dance Team, gave an exemplary performance with her lively stage presence.\n\nThe technical aspects of this show were a “massive deal.” Nicholas Eichner, responsible for lighting, proved himself clever in the artful use of red lighting to represent the animalistic savagery of high school. The frequent use of spotlights added a great touch of suspense, especially during Regina George (Alanis DeSouza)’s arrival in “Meet The Plastics.” While many vocals were clear, there were several microphone issues, such as them continuously switching on and off at the beginning, and lower register vocals being harder to hear during numbers.\n\nWith hilarity, enthusiasm, predators, and prey, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s production of Mean Girls: HS Edition is the fetch-iest thing since toaster strudel.\n\n* * *\n\nBy Christine Johnson of Coral Springs High School “Seriously, Whose House Is This?” You’ll never have to question that again after watching Marjory Stoneman Douglas High’s production of Mean Girls!\n\nBased on the 2004 film of the same name, the musical Mean Girls, was written by actress Tina Fey, with music and lyrics by Nell Benjamin and Jeff Richmond.

Even with a minor mishap with her mic in the beginning of Act One, Kennedy still showcased to the audience her stunning vocal ability and strong emotion to a high level, never losing her professionalism and determination to the role.\n\nHer name is Karen, and her hair is shiny. Also in the position of vocal director, Sydney Lotz quickly became a fan favorite among the audience. She absolutely dominated the stage with her hilariously timed “dumb blonde” moments and stellar commitment to the character. Sydney’s body language and facial expressions stayed consistent throughout the entire show never falling short of what was expected of her character. He’s almost too gay to function. Playing the role of the iconic Damian Hubbard, Oliver Paul went above and beyond. His dynamic and characterization was absolutely flawless.

With good characterization throughout, Kennedy showed good chemistry with the rest of the plastics, especially Alanis DeSouza, in her role as Regina George. DeSouza herself also showed admirable vocals, displaying an impressive low range in songs like “Someone Gets Hurt.”\n\nShining like stars in their roles as Janis Sarkisian and Damian Hubbard were Ella Valente and Oliver Paul. With palpable chemistry between them and truly stunning vocals on both parts, the pair brought to life the ferocity of this cautionary tale. Hilarious comedic timing was joined by incredible choreography, notably in songs like “Stop”, including a high-energy tap dance brought to life by Oliver Paul.\n\nCompleting The Plastics, Zoe Schwartzberg and Sydney Lotz, as Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith, respectfully, displayed impressive chemistry both between them and other cast members. Lotz’s comedic timing as Karen Smith excelled, maintaining a steady undercurrent of hilarious moments throughout the show.\n\nJoining them in the wildness of high school was the ensemble of North Shore High students. Maintaining high energy and executing impressive choreography while singing, these ensemble members brought the savannahs of Kenya all the way to North Shore. With clear set awareness, ensemble members expertly managed prop and set pieces throughout the show, and executed high-energy scenes with clear dedication.\n\nHighlighted especially during I See Stars, lighting designer Nicholas Eichner created stunning lights transporting the audience into Cady’s world. Joining in creating a world around the audience, special effects designer Gracy Fraysure created projections throughout the show, often relating to on-stage events. Hair and makeup designers Rhi Markaj and Avery Robbins and costume designer Adrian O’Connell created stunning looks for cast members, notably on Janis, with complicated designs that matched the classic Mean Girls aesthetic.\n\nWith admirable vocals, ever-present energy, and transporting tech work, Marjory Stoneman Douglas’s production of Mean Girls (High School Edition) proves again and again that more is always better.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Josie Grimmett of David Posnack Jewish Day School.\n\nEveryone needs to Stop and see Marjory Stoneman Douglas’s performance of Mean Girls!\n\nMean Girls the Musical is a comedy with music by Jeff Richmond and lyrics by Nell Benjamin. It’s based on the popular 2004 teen comedy film “Mean Girls,” written by Tina Fey. Mean Girls opened on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre in April 2018 and was nominated for several Tony awards. The plot follows Cady Heron, a teenager who moves from Africa to a new high school and navigates the complex social divisions dominated by the “Plastics,” a clique of popular girls. Along the way, Cady must grapple with identity, friendship, and morality issues.\n\nPlaying Cady Heron, Angelina Kennedy embodied the demanding role through her voice and characterizations perfectly portraying Cady’s naivety to the new world she’s exposed to. Even with microphone issues, she persevered by projecting her voice and having clear diction, showcasing her great talent. Sydney Lotz’s rendition of Karen Smith accurately showed her character’s ditzy personality and infectious enthusiasm throughout. She had impeccable comedic timing and physicality when putting her hands out by her sides the whole performance.\n\nThe remarkable performance of Ella Valente as Janis Sarkisian was nothing short of fantastic! Valente had strong and illuminating vocals, bringing captivating intensity to the role. Her portrayal is rich in vulnerability and strength, capturing the nuances of Janis’s character with raw emotion and authenticity. This is especially seen in her performance in A Cautionary Tale with her right-hand man, Damian Hubbard, played by Oliver Paul. Paul’s comedic timing, flamboyant demeanor, and expressions set him apart through his infectious optimism and unwavering loyalty to his friends. Whether delivering a hilarious one-liner, offering a shoulder to cry on, or even lending a pink shirt, Damien is always there to lift spirits and spread joy.\n\nThe ensemble’s impeccable timing, fluidity, and infectious energy brought the world of North Shore High to life, creating a bustling and vibrant space for the cast to shine. Their harmonies never faltered, especially in the song Revenge Party where their voices blended beautifully and created an energetic mood.\n\nAlthough some costumes did not properly represent the era of the 2000s, lighting design by Nicholas Eichner worked fantastically. Eichner’s lighting design was nothing short of impeccable, as he created lighting that shaped each scene’s mood, atmosphere, and emotional resonance. This was evident in What’s Wrong With Me with the blue lighting as Gretchen and Mrs. George had emotional moments and in Stupid with Love where Eichner made hearts by combining lights together when Cady was singing about her newfound sense of love.\n\nI See Stars in Marjory Stoneman Douglas’s fun-filled performance of Mean Girls!\n\nReviews Amelie Teen Edition at NSU University School on Saturday, 3/09/2024\n\nBy Gavin MacArthur of Cooper City High School\n\nSeptember 3, 1975, a baby is born right as a blue fly takes flight. Through the years, soaring through the heavens, it lands on NSU University School, and becomes part of their admirably magnificent production of Amelie Teen Edition.\n\nOpening on Broadway in 2017, Amelie encompasses music from Daniel Mess’, lyrics by Mess and Nathan Tysen, and book by Craig Lucas. This whimsical French tale revolves around Amelie who, after an unusual childhood, begins working as a waitress in a cafe. After a bizarre series of occurrences, Amelie devotes her life to kindness and, through a mysterious scrapbook, falls in love with a man whose name she does not yet know.\n\nThey say times are hard for dreamers but, with Lindsay Stern’s talent, they certainly won’t be hard for her! As the bright young woman, Lindsay Stern (Amelie Poulain) smoothly constructed her character through realistic mannerisms and facials. These attributes carried beautifully into Stern’s impeccable voice that lit up the theater with every flawless note. Lost in love, Jack Steinman (Nino Quincampoix) presented an equally remarkable vocal ability that aided in his powerful inflection through critical lines and lyrics. Together, these unlikely lovers carefully developed their adorable relationship until reaching its climax in the charmingly executed duet Stay.\n\nEveryone’s connected though they may not understand — even to — Elton John? Depicting the Rocket Man himself, Sam Dyer thrilled the audience with his exceptionally accurate and elevated portrayal, flaunting hilarious comedic timing that invoked consistent uproar. Dyer was among a collection of actors who must be commended for expertly memorizing and performing for both their characters, and auxiliary members of the exceptional Two Windmills Band. Bringing youth to this wise musical, Rubi Katz (Young Amelie) exhibited adolescent awe that connected this whole interwoven production.\n\nFollowing the blue arrows, finding the extraordinarily skilled cast of Amelie Teen Edition is as simple as discovering a purple-peeled fig! Fabulously, this company balanced evident stage business without drawing focus from the main scene or characters. Embodying these ideals, Zachary Kopelman (Joseph Cottard) excellently maintained character throughout appearances, accentuating every lifelike moment. The performers formulated exquisite harmonies to sound simply ravishing when grouped together.\n\nShowing There’s No Place Like Gnome, the multi-talented Lindsay Stern choreographed many stunning numbers with grace. Stern cleverly incorporated set changes and furniture to create effective displays of the minds of the characters. They certainly were not in need of A Better Haircut, Sofia Caseres, Sophia Goldstein, and Haleigh Mish of the hair and makeup crew designed unique styles to match the time period and its current events.\n\nWhen a finger points to the sky, only a fool looks at the finger. NSU University School was undoubtedly not a fool, as they delivered a transcendent production of Amelie Teen Edition.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Kimaya Lindo of Dillard Center for the Arts\n\nSeptember 3rd, 1975, a fly takes flight – bzzz — it passes a fruit stand, lands on a fig; the cloths start to dance and take turns in the wind.The fly meets the girl and before it lands, the girl named Amelie’s journey began! With buzzingly beautiful instruments and heartfelt vocals, NSU University School’s production of Amelie: Teen Edition reminds us that everyone’s connected and that even little buzzing flies at some point must land!\n\nEntre dans the world of Amelie. Amelie is a musical based on the 2001 romantic comedy film of the same name with music by Daniel Mess, lyrics by Mess and Nathan Tysen, and a book by Craig Lucas. Le Magnifique Musicale first made its grandiose opening at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2015, later on, a transformed production of the show with a new vision opened on the West End in December 2019, at the Other Palace. L’histoire follows a young girl named Amelie who finds her voice in the realization that to find happiness she;ll have to risk everything and say what’s in her heart!\n\nThey say times are hard for dreamers, but they won’t be hard for Amelie (Lindsay Stern)! Stern played the role of the silent dreamer beautifully; from her strong and lovely vocals to her in-depth characterization, Stern navigated this intricate character well and in return gave a swoon-worthy performance! Stern put out the breadcrumbs and went where they led; he stayed for his notebook but found her instead! Nino Quincampoix (Jack Steinman) did a great job at playing the offbeat but sweet daydreamer; from the choices in physicality to the beauty in his vocality, Steinman did a phenomenal job! Together the couple made quite the pair, their growing relationship was apparent and beautiful to watch as the chemistry was undeniable!\n\nBa-Bum Ba-bum goes the young Amelie’s (Rubi Katz) heart as she gets her checkup. Katz did a phenomenal job at playing the younger role. She accurately captured the childlike essence of the girl and did it with astounding vocality, not to mention her great puppet skills! In the cafe reside three girls with stories of their own (Lea Boldon, Haleigh Mish, and Ellie Esquenazi), these three girls shook the theater with their beautiful harmonies and strong individuality within their characters. Their dynamic with Amelie was also beautiful to watch!\n\nFrom the strumming guitars to the simplistic choreography, the tech was quite the sight to behold! All the tech in the show was simple yet wholly fitting as it did just enough to make the show beautiful every move felt meaningful! The choreography for the cast members with instruments was quite fitting as it allowed them to move freely and still be engaged in the piece.\n\nThere were a few issues with balance between the orchestra sound and the mics, but they were quickly resolved by Act Two!\n\nOverall the show was beautiful and NSU University School’s production of Amelie: Teen Edition helped me to remember that everyone is truly connected!\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Charlotte Canter of North Broward Preparatory School.\n\nEmbark on a Tour de France through NSU University School’s impeccable rendition of Amelie.\n\nBased on the French film of the same name, Amelie follows the adventures of its titular character — a shy yet imaginative young woman who discovers the magic hidden within everyday moments. With music by Daniel Mess, lyrics by Mess and Nathan Tysen, and a book by Craig Lucas, the musical enjoyed a brief but memorable run on Broadway in 2017. As Amelie finds joy in committing small, selfless acts for strangers, she soon discovers that love can be the most magical adventure of all — if only she can muster the courage not to run away. Set against the backdrop of Paris, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery, learning to overcome her fears and embrace the world around her. In Amelie, an introspective dreamer finds her voice, discovering the power of possibility in the process.\n\nFollow the trail of breadcrumbs to Lindsay Stern’s captivating performance as Amelie Poulain. Stern’s vocal control and range were a testament to her talent, showcased in every featured moment. Her emotional depth, particularly evident in the act two duet, Stay, and her expressive facials and precise mannerisms truly brought the character to life. Stern’s stark choices to distinguish between internal and external dialogue added depth to her portrayal.\n\nIn portraying Young Amelie, Rubi Katz masterfully distinguished herself from her older counterpart with convincing idiosyncrasies and explicit facial expressions. Her duality and versatility as a puppeteer and performer were also noteworthy; she excelled simultaneously in both aspects of her role. Haleigh Mish enthralled audiences as former trapeze artist Suzanne Sacripant. Her physicality was impressive, especially with the consistent use of a realistic limp. Mish’s dance technique was also praiseworthy.\n\nOverall, the Amelie cast demonstrated well-balanced, blended harmonies and pristine choreography execution while maintaining unique characterization. As Elton John, Sam Dyer should be applauded; his vocals, comedic timing, and individualization of an iconic character were notable throughout Goodbye, Amelie.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the crew of Amelie exhibited immense skill. Stage Management should be praised for their perfectly timed cues. Highly detailed props, including the dual photo-and-phone booth, furthered the plot effectively. The members of the live orchestra, doubling as actors, deserve recognition for their large undertaking and impeccable performances.\n\nNSU University School’s exemplary production of Amelie is a love letter to dreamers everywhere. Guided by a path of blue arrows, audiences are reminded that even in the most ordinary of circumstances, there is magic to be found for those who dare to dream.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Jailah Butler of Dillard Center for the Arts\n\nFrom Point A to Point B. Everyone falls as the fly comes into view, and everyone’s connected though they may not know it’s true. On September 3rd, 1975, a child was born. A child who lived loudly in her mind, but was afraid of reality. But later in the evening, her life will change; later that evening it did in Amelie: Teen Edition at NSU University School.\n\nPremiering on Broadway in 2017, based on the film of the same name, with music & lyrics written by Daniel Mess and Nathan Tysen, and book by Craig Lucas, Amelie takes us on a trip to France. Living in her imaginary world has been safe, but it’s time Amelie finds joy for herself and leaves her dreams. In this, she finds love with a mysterious man through his photo album. It’s a beautiful tale for dreamers everywhere.\n\nWhat do you see when the booth goes bright? For this performance, it was Lindsay Stern (Amelie Poulain) and Jack Steinman (Nino Quincampoix). Stern’s vocals are nothing short of wonderful, leaving the audience in awe. Her quirkiness and actions perfectly align with the character of Amelie. Similarly, Steinman as Nino captivated the audience with his mesmerizing voice. His rendition of “When The Booth Goes Bright” has the audience falling in love. Steinman’s acting is also strong, being honest and clear with his intentions. The chemistry between these two characters is palpable, and it is beautifully witnessed as they develop a connection, never meeting face-to-face until the very end. After all, Nino loves her, but he doesnt even know her name.\n\nAmelie has the best Maman, and Sofia Casares (Amandine Poulain) did an amazing job portraying her. Despite appearing for just a few minutes, she showed how Amelie became the person she was, hidden from the world. While playing the mother, Casares was also a part of the on-stage orchestra. Learning the lines, vocals, and dances of the show requires a great deal of strength.\n\nWhere do we go from here? We go to the Two Windmills Cafe where we meet the ensemble of Amelie who were one of the main causes of the whimsical magic felt throughout the room. With harmonies so clean, the ensemble was an amazing background to this beautiful show. But, Lea Bolden (Georgette Corunel) stood out with her comedic prowess and clean vocals.\n\nNow behind the scenes of the Cafe, we meet the orchestra that gave a sense of life to the story. Although there were moments where it was overpowering the cast’s voices, this was easily fixed by Act 2. When the entire cast came together to sing, there was no overwhelming sound, but rather a smooth and harmonious blend of voices. The choreography also was simple and never overshadowed the vocals of the cast. Rather, it complemented and enhanced the overall performance, adding another layer of enjoyment for the audience. It also took inspiration from Hamilton, which was well progressed throughout the show.\n\nThey say times are hard for dreamers, and who knows, maybe they are. Amelie: Teen Edition at NSU University School was a whimsical story full of love, magic, and dreams. We learned that it’s good to step into reality and take risks. We’ve gone from Point A to Point B, but what’s gonna happen? I don’t know, but whatever happens, here we go.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Kenny Gervais of Cooper City High School. * * *\n\nIf you look for it, love is all around. Whether it’s in the photo booth, the Two Windmills Cafe or the local train station, you can find romance anywhere in the City of Love. So, pull the curtain tight, adjust the seat and lean into the light of NSU University School’s enchanting production of Amelie Teen Edition.\n\nOpening on Broadway in 2017, Amelie features music by Daniel Mess, lyrics by Mess and Nathan Tysen, and a book by Craig Lucas. Set in 1990’s France, this romantic comedy follows Amelie Poulain, a girl who is quiet to others yet imaginative and bold in her mind. Her life changes when she discovers a treasure in her home and dedicates herself to returning it to the rightful owner. After seeing the effect of her good deed, she realizes the joy she can bring to others. However, when she falls in love, Amlie must learn to live her own life rather than the lives of others.\n\nGuiding the stage like a blue fly in flight was Lindsay Stern as Amelie Poulain. Stern’s impressive vocals alongside her prominent expressions wonderfully contrasted Amelie’s shy external appearance to her creative mind. With a performance brighter than the flash in a photo booth, Jack Steinman captivated the audience as Nino Quincampoix. His bold characterization and excellent emotions exquisitely built Nino’s quirky personality. Together, Steinman and Stern’s romantic chemistry was as complex as Zeno’s paradox, building from a distance until they finally met Halfway.\n\nPainting the picture of love was Sam Dyer as the reclusive Julien Dufayel. Dyer’s elderly inflection and impeccable line delivery beautifully crafted a love as fragile as glass. He impressively balanced being an orchestra member while maintaining consistent character and stage presence. Dyer also graced the stage with his angelic voice as Elton John. His audacious stage presence and amusing comedic timing had audiences roaring in their seats. Rubi Katz excelled onstage as Young Amelie. Her stellar vocals and childish characterization wonderfully represented Amelie’s childhood.\n\nThe entire cast is to be commended for their hard work and dedication. Although there were occasional issues with diction, each ensemble member employed exquisite stage business and energy. The Waitresses ensemble was a dynamic trio, each exhibiting strong vocal ability and characterization. Haleigh Mish led the ensemble as Suzanne Sacripant through her proficient dancing and consistency.\n\nThe technical achievements in this production were delightful. Choreography done by Lindsay Stern used Hamilton-inspired movement to create simple yet effective stage business in the cafe. Stage Manager David Taylor impeccably called 682 light cues, creating an immersive environment. Dramaturgy led by Sam Dyer masterfully incorporated research of the period and playwright to ensure accuracy in both technical elements and acting.\n\nNSU University School’s heartfelt production of Amelie Teen Edition promotes that even when life seems confusing and you wonder Where Do We Go From Here?, remember that everyone’s connected, though they may not know it’s true.\n\nReviews of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at American Heritage Broward on Friday, 3/08/2024.\n\nBy Makayla Whelchel of North Broward Preparatory School It’s rad, it’s rocking, it’s a 1960s banana-infused take on the first book of the Bible. American Heritage Broward presents a ferociously funny and earnestly entertaining production of a lifetime: Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\n\nAn origin story for the ages, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was written in 1968 by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber first as a 15-minute mini production that soon evolved into the ride of a show we know today. It follows the constantly dreaming Joseph, whose unpopular prophetic visions lead his eleven fantastically jealous brothers to sell him into slavery. With trials and tribulations and Twister games galore, the production eventually culminates in this underdog’s rise to the most powerful figure in Biblical Egypt.\n\nIn the role of Joseph, Jack Ryan delivered a performance greater than Potiphar’s claim to the Nile. Ryan truly lived in his character, and his humble but captivating presence coupled with his undoubtedly beautiful vocals were more than enough to fulfill any theatergoer’s dream. Maya Levinson, Krystal Molina, and Shea Korman likewise delivered as the story’s Narrators, their vocals entrancing from start to finish.\n\nThe performances from Joseph’s Brothers had everyone ready to Grovel, Grovel for more! Their energy as an ensemble was unmatched. With great chemistry, full-out dance, and fabulously funny stand out performances from individual brothers such as Judah (Daniel Font-Wilets) and Simeon (Nathan Rothbard), this ensemble greatly contributed to the show.\n\nEnsemble as a whole was also on point throughout the entirety of the production, featuring performers such as Mira Levinson, who imbibed the stage with crackling energy as Pharaoh, and Sara Awada, whose dance and technique as Mrs. Potiphar was commendable. Although there were issues with diction, the ensemble’s high energy dance and heavenly harmonies were more engaging and colorful than the Dreamcoat itself.\n\nBlow-up bananas, dancing cows, happy meals and Stanley cups- this props team did it all. Tara Peart and Daniella Bieber’s props were well crafted and consistent, bringing Joseph’s dream sequences to life. Lighting work by Hayley Schachter was likewise admirable with color-coordinated effects in songs like Joseph’s Coat and a creative jail bar effect in Close Every Door. Makeup by Emma Kolb and Damien Ellowitz added to the storybook vibe with well executed flair, and the student orchestra was nothing short of flawless. Although there were some minor mic issues, sound was on point throughout the show and stage management’s near perfect cueing had everyone tipping their French berets to a job well done.\n\nYou know what they say? You’ll make it someday. American Heritage Broward’s production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat showed us all that however wild our dreams may be, we too have the power to take control of and thrive in the lives we lead.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Broderick Sullivan of Saint Thomas Aquinas High School The story of Joseph and his brothers has been passed down for ages, reinterpreted time and time again — but it’s never been quite so flashy! Just like its eponymous accessory, American Heritage Broward’s dreamy production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was an eclectic sight to behold!\n\nThis tale of a dreamer has been around for a long time! The story of Joseph originates in the Book of Genesis in the Bible, and in 1968, famed lyric and music duo Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber put on their first version of the musical adaptation at Colet Court School, where it gained immediate attention in amateur circuits. Following the success of Rice and Webber’s next collaboration, Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph immediately received more attention, moving to the West End in 1973 and Broadway in 1982. The show follows Joseph as he reads dreams and goes from favorite son to slave to a prince of the Pharaoh.\n\nBrothers, Ishmaelites, cows, oh my! American Heritage Broward’s cast was a shapeshifting group of passionate actors who exceeded expectations throughout. Jack Ryan’s Joseph was the emotional core of the show, a technical powerhouse that soared from scene to scene, situation to situation. The show’s narrators, played by Maya Levinson, Krystal Molina and Shea Korman, were both incredibly funny and well timed, as well as doing their part to keep the story understandable and investing. Jacob’s eleven other sons, the ensemble of brothers, kept spirits high with their incredible comedic range, with raps and ballads only being the tip of the infectiously funny iceberg. While projection and diction could sometimes muddy lines, the full-force energy of the cast kept things moving with their clear love of the material and performance.\n\nBuilding on a complex spectrum of characters and scenes, American Heritage Broward’s tech team provided the flourishes to make their production truly catch the eye. The Heritage Pit Orchestra accented each and every song with their passionate, wide-ranging score that never missed a beat. Tara Peart and Daniella Bieber’s prop work added visual flair to the stage, with a multitude of items from Happy Meals to fanny packs creating havoc on stage. Similarly, the colors cultivated by Hayley Schachter’s lighting work were beautifully timed and matched the vibrant energy of the show. A few facets of technical work had issues during act one, but by act two, the crew’s determined work shined through.\n\nFrom country to calypso, American Heritage Broward’s inspired take on Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was bright and bold, a high-concept display of talent that was a joy to watch unfold.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Abby Goldberg of Cooper City High School\n\nTransporting audiences to a world of vibrant hues and kaleidoscopic wonder, American Heritage Broward’s dazzling production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” was a delightful journey that rewrote history with child-like wonder.\n\nWith music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” is based on the story of Joseph from the Bible’s Book of Genesis. Premiering on the West End in 1973 before gracing Broadway in 1982, this musical tells the biblical tale of Jacob’s favorite son, Joseph, and his 11 brothers. When Joseph is gifted “a coat of many colors,” his brothers become so consumed with jealousy that they sell him into slavery. Thrown into the journey of a lifetime, Joseph must learn to survive and reclaim his vibrancy.\n\nLeading the show with a boundless charisma was Jack Ryan as Joseph. Through heavenly vocals, captivating stage presence, and an infectious child-like charm, Ryan delivered a consistently stellar performance. His ability to express such a vast range of emotions was a testament to both his commitment and talent. No story can be properly told without a good Narrator, or three. Maya Levinson, Krystal Molina, and Shea Korman, brought this story to life with their phenomenal vocals and remarkable storytelling. Their performance, complete with crisp harmonies and clear dedication, was impeccable.\n\nThe ensemble of 11 brothers worked brilliantly together with impressive vocal technique and endless energy. While also displaying individuality between their characters, the brothers maintained an excellent dynamic and hilarious comedic timing that made the performance that much more enjoyable. Notably, Christopher Moody as Reuben exhibited expressive facials and physical comedy, making him a hilarious standout.\n\nThe cast as a whole must be commended for their colorful performance. The ensemble maintained high energy through intense numbers and intricate choreography. Mira Levinson must be commended for her standout performance as Pharaoh. Her exceptional vocals and unique stage presence made for a mesmerizing performance.\n\nThe technical elements of this production were stellar. Each aspect was creative and successfully worked hand-in-hand to help cultivate feelings of adolescence. With an impressive 350 light cues, stage manager Rebecca Weltmann and lighting designer Hayley Schachter worked well to create and call each vibrant cue seamlessly. As each prop was carefully crafted to appear from a child’s perspective, the stage was filled with a storybook-like wonder. Proving to be both effective and at times comedic, Tara Peart and Daniella Bieber must be commended on their creative design.\n\nAmerican Heritage Broward’s shining production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” was a testament to their talent and imaginations, offering a reminder of hope to the dreamers of the world.\n\n. * * *\n\nBy Clara Pangalangan of Cypress Bay High School With visions of corn stalks and cows, dancing bananas, and a brightly colored cast, American Heritage Broward’s production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was a dream come true!\n\nFirst arriving on Broadway in 1982 and running for 747 dazzling performances, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat features a book and lyrics by Tim Rice as well as music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The show takes a journey through the story of Joseph from the book of Genesis in the Bible. Joseph, most beloved by his father out of the twelve sons, is betrayed by his brothers in an act of jealousy, resulting in his enslavement in Egypt.\n\nLeading the stellar production as Joseph, Jack Ryan delivered a truthful depiction with every color of emotion and expression. Ryan also showcased exceptional vocals in songs such as Close Every Door, demonstrating a different dimension of the character compared to that at the end of the show. While there were some moments where actors were hard to understand due to sound imbalances, Ryan captivated the audience with his amazing performance.\n\nThe three narrators’ exhilarating performance held the show together with their technicolor telling of the story, not once wavering in energy as their voices blended harmoniously. The narrator played by Shea Korman presented electrifying vocals that continuously impressed the audience, particularly in Potiphar and Poor, Poor Pharaoh. Similarly, Nathan Rothbard’s hilarious portrayal of Simeon, the most jealous of Joseph’s brothers, stole the show in Those Canaan Days while holding an effective French accent.\n\nRuling over all of Egypt, Pharaoh, played by Mira Levinson, stood out amongst the rest of the cast. Levinson masterfully emulated Cher with excellent characterization throughout her time on stage. Daniel Font-Wilets’ unexpected solo as Judah in Benjamin Calypso was a terrific display of talent, especially in singing while being lifted in the air.\n\nWithin the cast, the ensemble held the show’s comedic tone well throughout the production. Each dance was filled with energy and was synchronized to perfection. The Brothers especially shined with constant chemistry with one another, standing out in the lively song One More Angel In Heaven.\n\nRegarding the technical aspect of the production, the impressive work by stage manager Rebecca Weltmann and light board operator Hayley Schachter in seamlessly executing hundreds of complex lighting cues perfectly on time created a brilliant visual that persisted throughout the show.
