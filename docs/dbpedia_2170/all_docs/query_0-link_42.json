        "text": "Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Situs Inversus Totalis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nS, Mahesh Shetty; BB, Sunil Kumar\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSitus inversus totalis is a rare condition where the organs in the body is placed in the opposite side. When such patient presents with the diseases of the intra abdominal organs the diagnosis is challenging and the operative procedure to be performed will be difficult. This may require the anticipation of variations in anatomy, ergonomic changes required during surgery and mastery over the operative skills in reversed anatomy. Cholelithiasis in situs inversus totalis is one such situation. Herein we report a case of situs inversus totalis who underwent successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallbladder calculi. PMID:25177601\n\nCoexisting Situs Inversus Totalis and Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura.\n\nPubMed\n\nGundogdu, Kemal; Altintoprak, Fatih; UzunoÄlu, Mustafa Yener; Dikicier, Enis; Zengin, Ä°smail; YaÄmurkaya, Orhan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSitus inversus totalis is a rare congenital abnormality with mirror symmetry of mediastinal and abdominal organs. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disease with destruction of thrombocytes. This paper is presentation of surgical approach to a case with coexistence of these two conditions.\n\nFluorescence cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a patient with situs inversus totalis: a case report and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nRungsakulkij, Narongsak; Tangtawee, Pongsatorn\n\n2017-04-20\n\nSitus inversus totalis is a rare autosomal disorder in which the patient's affected visceral organs are a perfect mirror image of their normal positions. Surgery in these patients is technically challenging. Minimally invasive surgery such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis, but it can be difficult to perform. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with situs inversus totalis may be even more technically challenging. Fluorescence cholangiography is a new innovation in the field of navigation surgery. This procedure is safe and easy to perform, its findings are easy to interpret, and it does not require a learning curve or radiographs. It can be used in real time during surgery to identify extrahepatic biliary structures. We herein report a case of situs inversus totalis in a Thai patient with a history of biliary pancreatitis. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative fluorescence cholangiography. The operation was successfully completed without complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of the use of fluorescence cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a patient with situs inversus. Fluorescence cholangiographyis a new navigational surgical technique with which to identify extrahepatic biliary structures. It can be used as an adjunct technique during laparoscopic cholecystectomy to avoid biliary tract injury in difficult cases.\n\nMandibular symphyseal midline distraction osteogenesis for micrognathia associated with aglossia and situs inversus totalis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRen, X C; Li, Y F; Liu, Y; Zhu, S S\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAglossia is a rare congenital abnormality, often associated with micrognathia and limb defects. Situs inversus totalis is also a rare congenital abnormality, defined as a mirror-image reversal of all the asymmetric organs of the thorax and abdomen. The concurrence of these two abnormalities has only been reported in eight similar cases in the literature. Although micrognathia and malocclusion were observed in all of these cases, few treatments were performed for the patients' dentofacial deformities. This report describes the case of a 7-year-old boy suffering from micrognathia, aglossia, and situs inversus totalis simultaneously, and the treatment for his micrognathia by mandibular symphyseal midline distraction osteogenesis, guided by virtual surgical planning and a three-dimensional printed surgical template. In a review of the literature, this is the first case of micrognathia associated with aglossia and situs inversus totalis that has been treated by mandibular symphyseal midline distraction osteogenesis for the dentofacial deformity.

However, in rare cases of previously undiagnosed situs inversus totalis (with dextrocardia), the presentation of the cholecystitis, its diagnosis and the operative procedure can pose problems. We present here one such case and discuss how the diagnosis was made and difficulties encountered during surgery and how they were coped with. A 35 year old female presented with left hypochondrium pain and dyspepsia, for 2 years. A diagnosis of cholelithiasis with situs inversus was confirmed after thorough clinical examination, abdominal and chest X-rays and ultrasonography of the abdomen. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the standard treatment, was performed with numerous modifications in the positioning of the monitor, insufflator, ports and the position of the members of the surgical team and the laparoscopic instruments. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Situs inversus totalis is itself a rare condition and when associated with cholelithiasis poses a challenge in the management of the condition. We must appreciate the necessity of setting up the operating theatre, the positioning of the ports, the surgical team and the instruments. Therefore, it becomes important for the right handed surgeons to modify their techniques and establish a proper hand eye coordination to adapt to the mirror image anatomy of the Calot's triangle in a patient of situs inversus totalis.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor with an annual incidence of 2-8 cases per million people and for years has been studied its relationship with the hypoxic pathway. Case Report: A 29 year old male with a history of tetralogy of fallot corrected at 10 years and situs inversus totalis. He was admitted to hospital with a progressive story of four months of constipation, palpitations, headache, dyspnea and sweating. Physical examination revealed a thinned man with peripheral cyanosis, clubbing and signs of decompensated congestive heart failure as hepatomegaly, legs edema, multifocal systodiastolic murmurs, abdominal distension and jugular venous distention. The echocardiogram shows severe right ventricular dysfunction and severe pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, abdominal computed tomography shows right adrenal mass. Elevated metanephrines and catecholamines confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Surgical removal is decided and preoperative management begins with alpha-adrenergic blockade, however the patient had a hemodynamic decompensation with an unfavorable evolution. Discussion: In conclusion, there are few reports of cyanotic congenital heart disease with pheochromocytoma. Several studies show a significant association between both of them due to chronic hypoxia leads sustained hyperresponsiveness in adrenal medulla and it would cause the tumor. Special preoperative management of pheochromocytoma is recommended when there underlying heart disease and congestive heart failure. We present the first international report of tetralogy of fallot and pheochromocytoma in a patient with situs inversus totalis.

This situation leads to diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in patients with acute surgical abdomen. The objective of this report is to present the case of a patient who presented with colonic pain in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium, in which the diagnosis of SIT, cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis was reached after the respective imaging studies. Once the diagnosis was made, treatment was performed through retrograde endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and subsequent surgical exploration of bile ducts. Both procedures were failed due to technical difficulties generated by the patient's condition. In conclusion, in spite of the report of successful cases in the literature of ERCP and surgical treatment of the biliary tract in SIT, there may be situations that do not allow a successful approach, so meticulous surgical planning and the use of support methods are necessary In the management of these patients.\n\nSitus inversus totalis associated with subaortic stenosis, restrictive ventricular septal defect, and tricuspid dysplasia in an adult dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nPiantedosi, Diego; Cortese, Laura; Meomartino, Leonardo; Di Loria, Antonio; Ciaramella, Paolo\n\n2011-11-01\n\nA rare association between situs inversus totalis (SIT), restrictive ventricular septal defect, severe subaortic stenosis, and tricuspid dysplasia was observed in an adult mixed-breed dog. Primary ciliary dyskinesia and Kartagener's syndrome were excluded. After 15 mo the dog died suddenly. The association between SIT and congenital heart diseases is discussed.\n\nA Homozygous Nme7 Mutation Is Associated with Situs Inversus Totalis.\n\nPubMed\n\nReish, Orit; Aspit, Liam; Zouella, Arielle; Roth, Yehudah; Polak-Charcon, Sylvie; Baboushkin, Tatiana; Benyamini, Lilach; Scheetz, Todd E; Mussaffi, Huda; Sheffield, Val C; Parvari, Ruti\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWe investigated the cause of situs inversus totalis (SIT) in two siblings from a consanguineous family. Genotyping and whole-exome analysis revealed a homozygous change in NME7, resulting in deletion of an exon causing an in-frame deletion of 34 amino acids located in the second NDK domain of the protein and segregated with the defective lateralization in the family. NME7 is an important developmental gene, and NME7 protein is a component of the Î³-tubulin ring complex. This mutation is predicted to affect the interaction of NME7 protein with this complex as it deletes the amino acids crucial for the binding. SIT associated with homozygous deletion in our patients is in line with Nme7(-/-) mutant mice phenotypes consisting of congenital hydrocephalus and SIT, indicating a novel human laterality patterning role for NME7. Further cases are required to elaborate the full human phenotype associated with NME7 mutations.

An 82-year-old woman with dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis underwent successful off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting using internal mammary arteries. The operative technique was similar to that of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting for situs solitus. However, for a right-handed surgeon the operation was easier standing on the left side of the patient.\n\nBrain structural and functional asymmetry in human situs inversus totalis.\n\nPubMed\n\nVingerhoets, Guy; Li, Xiang; Hou, Lewis; Bogaert, Stephanie; Verhelst, Helena; Gerrits, Robin; Siugzdaite, Roma; Roberts, Neil\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain structural and functional asymmetries in 15 participants with complete visceral reversal (situs inversus totalis, SIT). Language-related brain structural and functional lateralization of SIT participants, including peri-Sylvian gray and white matter asymmetries and hemispheric language dominance, was similar to those of 15 control participants individually matched for sex, age, education, and handedness. In contrast, the SIT cohort showed reversal of the brain (Yakovlevian) torque (occipital petalia and occipital bending) compared to the control group. Secondary findings suggested different asymmetry patterns between SIT participants with (nâ=â6) or without (nâ=â9) primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, also known as Kartagener syndrome) although the small sample sizes warrant cautious interpretation. In particular, reversed brain torque was mainly due to the subgroup with PCD-unrelated SIT and this group also included 55% left handers, a ratio close to a random allocation of handedness. We conclude that complete visceral reversal has no effect on the lateralization of brain structural and functional asymmetries associated with language, but seems to reverse the typical direction of the brain torque in particular in participants that have SIT unrelated to PCD. The observed differences in asymmetry patterns of SIT groups with and without PCD seem to suggest that symmetry breaking of visceral laterality, brain torque, and language dominance rely on different mechanisms.\n\nLaparoscopic radical nephrectomy for a right renal tumor with renal vein tumor thrombus in a patient with situs inversus totalis.\n\nPubMed\n\nIto, Jun; Kaiho, Yasuhiro; Iwamura, Hiromichi; Anan, Go; Sato, Makoto\n\n2018-05-23\n\nSitus inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by complete inversion of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Many intra-abdominal and vessel anomalies have been reported in association with SIT. However, there have been no reports on the use of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy for renal vein thrombus, which is considered as a safe and feasible procedure, in patients with SIT. We herein present the case of an 80-year-old man with SIT who was preoperatively diagnosed with a right renal tumor and renal vein tumor thrombus. The patient underwent laparoscopic right nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy with no intraoperative complications. To ensure a safe procedure, the anatomy and vessels were carefully evaluated preoperatively using 3-D multiplanar reconstructed CT imaging. Assessing anatomical structures leads to safer laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma with venous tumor thrombus in patients with SIT.

METHODS: In this prospective study, participants with suspected PCD were referred to our multisite consortium. We measured nasal nitric oxide (nNO) level, examined cilia with electron microscopy, and analyzed PCD-causing gene mutations. Situs was classified as (1) situs solitus (SS), (2) SI, or (3) situs ambiguus (SA), including heterotaxy. Participants with hallmark electron microscopic defects, biallelic gene mutations, or both were considered to have classic PCD. RESULTS: Of 767 participants (median age, 8.1 years, range, 0.1-58 years), classic PCD was defined in 305, including 143 (46.9%), 125 (41.0%), and 37 (12.1%) with SS, SI, and SA, respectively. A spectrum of laterality defects was identified with classic PCD, including 2.6% and 2.3% with SA plus complex or simple cardiac defects, respectively; 4.6% with SA but no cardiac defect; and 2.6% with an isolated possible laterality defect. Participants with SA and classic PCD had a higher prevalence of PCD-associated respiratory symptoms vs SA control participants (year-round wet cough, P < .001; year-round nasal congestion, P = .015; neonatal respiratory distress, P = .009; digital clubbing, P = .021) and lower nNO levels (median, 12 nL/min vs 252 nL/min; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: At least 12.1% of patients with classic PCD have SA and laterality defects ranging from classic heterotaxy to subtle laterality defects. Specific clinical features of PCD and low nNO levels help to identify PCD in patients with laterality defects.

Herein we have presented 2 cases of complex congenital heart disease with atriovisceral situs inversus. Both of the patients shared many common cardiac anomalies, such as a single ventricle, a single AV valve with severe regurgitation, and severe pulmonary stenosis. We completed the venous connection in 2 different ways. In the first case, the donor inferior vena cava (IVC) was anastomosed to the recipient left-sided IVC directly, making the heart slightly counterclockwise rotated. In the second case, the IVC venous reconnection was accomplished by a composite conduit made of recipient right atrium.\n\nSuccessful Obstetric Outcome in Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus and Moderate Pulmonary Hypertension- Rare Case.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeepika; Wadhwa, Leena; Shekhar, Chandna; Saini, Jyoti; Chetani, Monica\n\n2016-10-01\n\nSitus inversus is a rare congenital anomaly, which is characterized by right sided heart (Dextrocardia) and inversely rotated visceral organs of abdomen. In present case, the patient reported with G3p2l2, 34 weeks of gestational period along with breathlessness accompanied and labour pains. On further investigation, she was diagnosed as dextrocardia with situs inversus and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension along with severe iron deficiency anaemia. Patient had normal vaginal delivery with intra-partum and post-partum period. Normally, any patient having situs inversus has a normal life expectancy and is not associated with any significant morbidity or mortality.\n\nPancreatic fibrosis calcification and situs inversus in a Liberian female; a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nNjoh, J; Findley, G; Dharmavaratha, S\n\n1986-06-01\n\nWe report the first case of the Pancreatic fibrosis calcification syndrome (PFCS) in a Liberian. The patient presented with the classical features of the syndrome - a history of recurrent abdominal pain, diabetes mellitus, malabsorption and pancreatic calcification on plain abdominal X-ray. The patient also has situs inversus; we believe that this combination is a casual one. Since describing this case, five more cases have been diagnosed; we believe that this condition is not rare in Liberia.\n\nScoliosis convexity and organ anatomy are related.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchlÃ¶sser, Tom P C; Semple, Tom; Carr, SiobhÃ¡n B; Padley, Simon; Loebinger, Michael R; Hogg, Claire; Castelein, RenÃ© M\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a respiratory syndrome in which 'random' organ orientation can occur; with approximately 46% of patients developing situs inversus totalis at organogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between organ anatomy and curve convexity by studying the prevalence and convexity of idiopathic scoliosis in PCD patients with and without situs inversus. Chest radiographs of PCD patients were systematically screened for existence of significant lateral spinal deviation using the Cobb angle. Positive values represented right-sided convexity. Curve convexity and Cobb angles were compared between PCD patients with situs inversus and normal anatomy. A total of 198 PCD patients were screened. The prevalence of scoliosis (Cobb >10Â°) and significant spinal asymmetry (Cobb 5-10Â°) was 8 and 23%, respectively. Curve convexity and Cobb angle were significantly different within both groups between situs inversus patients and patients with normal anatomy (PÂ â¤Â 0.009). Moreover, curve convexity correlated significantly with organ orientation (PÂ <Â 0.001; ÏÂ =Â 0.882): In 16 PCD patients with scoliosis (8 situs inversus and 8 normal anatomy), except for one case, matching of curve convexity and orientation of organ anatomy was observed: convexity of the curve was opposite to organ orientation. This study supports our hypothesis on the correlation between organ anatomy and curve convexity in scoliosis: the convexity of the thoracic curve is predominantly to the right in PCD patients that were 'randomized' to normal organ anatomy and to the left in patients with situs inversus totalis.\n\nA unique case of right-sided Poland syndrome with true dextrocardia and total situs inversus.\n\nPubMed\n\nAtasoy, Halil I; Yavuz, Taner; Altunrende, Sevil; Guven, Melih; KÄ±lÄ±cgun, Ali; Polat, Omer; Yesiller, Erkan; Duzenli, Selma\n\n2013-02-01\n\nPoland syndrome has been reported to be associated with true dextrocardia, but not with true situs inversus.

Levocardia with abdominal situs inversus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdullah, Nor Lenny; Quek, Swee Chye; Seto, Kar Yin; Teo, Lynette Li San\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLevocardia (left-sided cardiac apex) with abdominal situs inversus is extremely rare. This is also known as isolated levocardia and is almost always associated with severe forms of congenital heart defects with poor prognosis. We report isolated levocardia in a 13-year-old symptomatic male patient. The purpose of this paper is to outline the imaging features of isolated levocardia and to highlight the role of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in the diagnosis and management of such cases. Other forms of cardiac malposition, including dextrocardia, mesocardia and criss-cross heart, with chest radiograph and CMR correlation, are also discussed.

Ninety-five published cases of LSAA were evaluated and a 25-year-old female, who presented to our clinic with left lower abdominal pain caused by LSAA, is reported. In the reviewed literature, fifty-seven patients were male and 38 were female with an age range of 8 to 82 years and a median age of 29.1 Â± 15.9 years. Sixty-six patients had SIT, 23 had MM, three had cecal malrotation, and two had a previously unnoted congenital abnormality. Fifty-nine patients had presented to the hospital with left lower, 14 with right lower and seven with bilateral lower quadrant pain, and seven subjects complained of left upper quadrant pain. The diagnosis was established preoperatively in 49 patients, intraoperatively in 19, and during the postoperative period in five; 14 patients were aware of having this anomaly. The data of eight patients were not unavailable. Eleven patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, which was combined with cholecystectomy in two cases. Histopathological examination of the appendix specimens revealed adenocarcinoma in only two of 95 patients. The diagnosis of left lower quadrant pain is based on well-established clinical symptoms, physical examination and physician's experience.\n\nFirst trimester diagnosis of parapagus diprosopus dibrachius dipus twins with cranirachischisis totalis by three-dimensional ultrasound.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃlker, Kahraman; Akyer, Åahika P; Temur, Ä°smail; Tan, Temel; Karaca, Mehmet; AdÄ±gÃ¼zel, Esat; GÃ¼l, AbdÃ¼laziz\n\n2012-02-01\n\nParapagus (laterally fused), diprosopus (two faces), dibrachius (two upper extremities), dipus (two lower extremities) conjoined twinning is extremely rare. The coexistence of anencephaly with a contiguous spinal defect (craniorachischisis totalis) makes the present case one of the rarest of the published cases. In our case, it was difficult to make the final diagnosis by two-dimensional abdominal and vaginal ultrasound. Three-dimensional ultrasound was helpful for final diagnosis and post-abortal examination confirmed the prenatal ultrasound diagnosis. The heart, diaphragm, liver and perineum were all united. Fine dissection of the heart showed four vessels arising from the ventricles and a membranous type ventricular septal defect. Â© 2011 The Authors.

The clinical phenotype of this case included blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome, Dandy-Walker malformation, and global developmental delay. Contiguous heterozygous deletion of FOXL2, ATR, ZIC1, and ZIC4 was postulated as the causative mechanism of the clinical phenotype. The association of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome with developmental delay or mental retardation may be an indication for the use of brain imaging and chromosomal analysis capable of detecting chromosomal rearrangements encompassing several candidate genes.\n\nA case of triple volvulus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBasu, I; Phillips, D\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSitus inversus is a rare congenital anomaly that has reportedly been associated with caecal volvulus.

The SDLT was also used to study twenty four age-matched normal subjects that were from 6 to 48 years old (mean 21.7 years old, S.D. = 15.3); the twelve males and twelve females were all strongly right-handed and served as a control group. Eight out of the nine subjects (88.9%) with SI more often reproduced the sounds from the right ear than sounds from the left ear; this is called right ear advantage (REA). The ratio of REA in the control group was almost the same, i.e., nineteen out of the twenty-four subjects (79.1%) showed REA. Results of the present study suggest that the left-right reversal in situs inversus does not involve functional asymmetry of the brain. As such, the system that produces functional asymmetry in the human brain must independently recognize laterality from situs asymmetry.\n\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy for a left-sided gallbladder.\n\nPubMed\n\nIskandar, Mazen E; Radzio, Agnes; Krikhely, Merab; Leitman, I Michael\n\n2013-09-21\n\nCholecystectomy is a common procedure.

We have positionally cloned a novel, putative winged helix/forkhead transcription factor gene, FOXL2, that is mutated to produce truncated proteins in type I families and larger proteins in type II. Consistent with an involvement in those tissues, FOXL2 is selectively expressed in the mesenchyme of developing mouse eyelids and in adult ovarian follicles; in adult humans, it appears predominantly in the ovary. FOXL2 represents a candidate gene for the polled/intersex syndrome XX sex-reversal goat.\n\nDe Novo 3q22.3q24 Microdeletion in a Patient With BlepharophimosisâPtosisâEpicanthus Inversus Syndrome, Dandy-Walker Malformation, and Wisconsin Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRamineni, Anand\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInterstitial deletions affecting the long arm of chromosome 3 have been associated with a broad phenotype.

The authors aimed to evaluate the involvement of FOXL2 in familial and sporadic cases of BPES in an Indian cohort. The present cohort comprised clinically well-characterised BPES cases that included six affected families, two sporadic cases and 60 unaffected normal controls. The 5' untranslated and coding region of FOXL2 was screened by resequencing and confirmed by restriction digestion. Further, genotype-phenotype correlations were done to understand the implications of the observed mutation. Six mutations were observed in eight cases (87.5%). These included a novel deletion (c.860delC), three previously reported duplications (c.663-692dup 30, c.672-701dup30 and c.843-859dup17), a frame shift (c.804dupC) and a homozygous missense mutation (p.E69K). The p.E69k mutation was seen in both heterozygous and homozygous form in a large four-generational family, and disease severity was found to be directly linked to the allelic dosage. Two SNPs (c.501CâT, c.536CâG) were also noted. An unusual coexistence of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) with BPES was also seen in one of the families. Mutations in the region downstream of the fork-head domain were predominantly responsible for BPES among Indian patients.\n\nLoss of Nephrocystin-3 Function Can Cause Embryonic Lethality,Â Meckel-Gruber-like Syndrome, Situs Inversus, and Renal-Hepatic-Pancreatic Dysplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBergmann, Carsten; Fliegauf, Manfred; BrÃ¼chle, Nadina Ortiz; Frank, Valeska; Olbrich, Heike; Kirschner, Jan; Schermer, Bernhard; Schmedding, Ingolf; Kispert, Andreas; KrÃ¤nzlin, Bettina; NÃ¼rnberg, Gudrun; Becker, Christian; Grimm, Tiemo; Girschick, Gundula; Lynch, Sally A.; Kelehan, Peter; Senderek, Jan; Neuhaus, Thomas J.; Stallmach, Thomas; Zentgraf, Hanswalter; NÃ¼rnberg, Peter; Gretz, Norbert; Lo, Cecilia; Lienkamp, Soeren; SchÃ¤fer, Tobias; Walz, Gerd; Benzing, Thomas; Zerres, Klaus; Omran, Heymut\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMany genetic diseases have been linked to the dysfunction of primary cilia, which occur nearly ubiquitously in the body and act as solitary cellular mechanosensory organelles. The list of clinical manifestations and affected tissues in cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) such as nephronophthisis is broad and has been attributed to the wide expression pattern of ciliary proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to this dramatic diversity of phenotypes. We recently reported hypomorphic NPHP3 mutations in children and young adults with isolated nephronophthisis and associated hepatic fibrosis or tapetoretinal degeneration. Here, we chose a combinatorial approach in mice and humans to define the phenotypic spectrum of NPHP3/Nphp3 mutations and the role ofÂ the nephrocystin-3 protein. We demonstrate that the pcy mutation generates a hypomorphic Nphp3 allele that is responsible for the cystic kidney disease phenotype, whereas complete loss of Nphp3 function results in situs inversus, congenital heart defects, and embryonic lethality in mice. In humans, we show that NPHP3 mutations can cause a broad clinical spectrum of early embryonic patterning defects comprising situs inversus, polydactyly, central nervous system malformations, structural heart defects, preauricular fistulas, and a wide range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). On the functional level, we show that nephrocystin-3 directly interacts with inversin and can inhibit like inversin canonical Wnt signaling, whereas nephrocystin-3 deficiency leads in Xenopus laevisÂ to typical planar cell polarity defects, suggesting a role in the control of canonical and noncanonical (planar cell polarity) Wnt signaling.

Heterotaxy is often accompanied by multiple congenital malformations, and it generally comprises asplenia and polysplenia syndromes. To our knowledge, polysplenia syndrome has been reported in only three cattle, and computerized tomographic (CT) images of these animals were not obtained. A six-month-old Holstein heifer had ruminal tympani and right abdominal distension. CT imaging showed that the rumen occupied the right side of the abdominal cavity, the omasum and abomasum occupied the left ventral side and the liver was positioned on the left. The colon and cecum were located at the left dorsum of the cavity, and the left kidney was located more cranially than the right. Postmortem findings revealed two spleens attached to the rumen. Significantly, the duodenum was too short to be divided into segments, except the cranial and descending parts, or flexures, except the cranial flexure, and the pancreas, which lacked a left lobe, was covered with mesojejunum. The liver comprised a relatively large right lobe and a small left lobe without quadrate and caudate lobes. The caudal vena cava that connected to the left azygous vein passed irregularly through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm, and the common hepatic vein without the caudal vena cava passed through the caval foramen. Although the lungs and heart were morphologically normal, the right atrium received three major systemic veins. Polysplenia syndrome was diagnosed based on the CT and postmortem findings. We defined the positions of the abdominal organs and morphological abnormalities in various organs of a calf with polysplenia syndrome based on CT and postmortem findings. These findings will improve understanding of the malpositioning and malformations that can occur in the\n\nThe role of electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of dextrocardia with mirror image atrial arrangement and ventricular position in a young adult Nigerian in Ile-Ife: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nOgunlade, Oluwadare; Ayoka, Abiodun O; Akomolafe, Rufus O; Akinsomisoye, Olumide S; Irinoye, Adedayo I; Ajao, Adewale; Asafa, Muritala A\n\n2015-09-28\n\nDextrocardia with situs inversus is a rare congenital disease. In patients with this condition, the heart is presented as a mirror image of itself with its apex pointing to the right. The pulmonary and abdominal anatomies are reversed. Dextrocardia with situs inversus occurs at birth but its diagnosis may be in adulthood. This case advances knowledge by graphically describing the unusual electrocardiographic features of dextrocardia in a young adult. We report a case of a 22-year-old Nigerian man of Yoruba ethnicity who presented himself for preadmission medical test. He had a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram which revealed uncommon features: inversion of P waves in leads I, aVL and aVR; dominantly negative QRS waves in leads I, V1 to V6; reverse R wave progression in chest leads; low voltage in V4 to V6; extreme QRS axis; flattened T waves in V4 to V6 and aVR; and inverted T waves in lead I and aVL. An electrocardiogram diagnosis of dextrocardia was made. The differential diagnosis considered was right ventricular hypertrophy. A cardiovascular examination showed pulse rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/62mmHg, visible cardiac impulse at right precordium, apex beat was located at his fifth right intercostal space mid-clavicular line. A chest X-ray (posterior anterior view) including upper abdomen showed dextrocardia; his aortic arch was located on the right. His stomach bubble was located below his right hemidiaphragm. His trachea was slightly deviated to the left. The findings in his lung fields were not remarkable. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography showed that right-sided intra-abdominal organs (liver, gallbladder) were located on the left while left-sided organs (stomach, spleen) were located on the right. His abdominal aorta was on the right while his inferior vena cava was located on the left. A diagnosis of dextrocardia with situs inversus was made ultrasonographically. A properly interpreted electrocardiogram was useful in suspecting the\n\nAn extremely rare clinical entity: congenitally corrected transposition with situs Ä±nversus and single coronary artery presented with complete atrioventricular block in a young man.\n\nPubMed\n\nCirakoglu, Omer Faruk; Bayraktar, Ali; Sayin, Muhammet Rasit\n\n2018-05-01\n\nCongenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is a rare form of CHD.

This combination of abnormalities is presented as a first in the literature.\n\nPIERCE1 is critical for specification of left-right asymmetry in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSung, Young Hoon; Baek, In-Jeoung; Kim, Yong Hwan; Gho, Yong Song; Oh, S Paul; Lee, Young Jae; Lee, Han-Woong\n\n2016-06-16\n\nThe specification of left-right asymmetry of the visceral organs is precisely regulated. The earliest breakage of left-right symmetry occurs as the result of leftward flow generated by asymmetric beating of nodal cilia, which eventually induces asymmetric Nodal/Lefty/Pitx2 expression on the left side of the lateral plate mesoderm. PIERCE1 has been identified as a p53 target gene involved in the DNA damage response. In this study, we found that Pierce1-null mice exhibit severe laterality defects, including situs inversus totalis and heterotaxy with randomized situs and left and right isomerisms. The spectrum of laterality defects was closely correlated with randomized expression of Nodal and its downstream genes, Lefty1/2 and Pitx2. The phenotype of Pierce1-null mice most closely resembled that of mutant mice with impaired ciliogenesis and/or ciliary motility of the node. We also found the loss of asymmetric expression of Cerl2, the earliest flow-responding gene in the node of Pierce1-null embryos. The results suggest that Pierce1-null embryos have defects in generating a symmetry breaking signal including leftward nodal flow. This is the first report implicating a role for PIERCE1 in the symmetry-breaking step of left-right asymmetry specification.\n\n[Spain, New Spain and the autopsy of an anatomic malformation].\n\nPubMed\n\nde la Garza-VillaseÃ±or, J Lorenzo; Pantoja-MillÃ¡n, Juan Pablo\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAlmost 250 years ago the autopsy of Agustin de Ahumada y Villalon was performed by Domingo Russi, Chief Surgeon at the Royal Hospital for Natives in Mexico City. This situation will be unimportant if the former wasn't the 42nd Viceroy of New Spain; his autopsy showed a situs inversus totalis, and probably this is the first scientific report of such malformation. For many years the report by Mathew Baillie (1761-1823) of an autopsy with the same findings as the first of its kind was believed, but actually the former almost three decades earlier was performed. In 1688 Jean M. Mery (1645-1722) at the Paris Academy of Medicine gave a talk reporting autopsy findings of the same malformations. Some aspects of the life of both personages are described, the autopsy report is showed and a short history about postmortem studies are mentioned mainly those made in Spain and New Spain. Through many centuries a very close relationship has been kept and medicine has not been the exception, in the field of human pathology in the middle third of the 20th century a distinguished pathologist, Dr. Isaac Costero-Tudanca, migrated to Mexico and gave flowering to pathology and a great generation of Mexican pathologists was generated headed by Dr. Ruy Perez-Tamayo.\n\nClinical and Genetic Aspects of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia / Kartagener Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeigh, Margaret W.; Pittman, Jessica E.; Carson, Johnny L.; Ferkol, Thomas W.; Dell, Sharon D.; Davis, Stephanie D.; Knowles, Michael R.; Zariwala, Maimoona A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia. Most of the disease-causing mutations identified to date involve the heavy (DNAH5) or intermediate (DNAI1) chain dynein genes in ciliary outer dynein arms, although a few mutations have been noted in other genes. Clinical molecular genetic testing for PCD is available for the most common mutations. The respiratory manifestations of PCD (chronic bronchitis leading to bronchiectasis, chronic rhino-sinusitis and chronic otitis media) reflect impaired mucociliary clearance owing to defective axonemal structure. Ciliary ultrastructural analysis in most patients (>80%) reveals defective dynein arms, although defects in other axonemal components have also been observed. Approximately 50% of PCD patients have laterality defects (including situs inversus totalis and, less commonly, heterotaxy and congenital heart disease), reflecting dysfunction of embryological nodal cilia. Male infertility is common and reflects defects in sperm tail axonemes. Most PCD patients have a history of neonatal respiratory distress, suggesting that motile cilia play a role in fluid clearance during the transition from a fetal to neonatal lung. Ciliopathies involving sensory cilia, including autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Alstrom syndrome, may have chronic respiratory symptoms and even bronchiectasis suggesting clinical overlap with PCD.

To determine the relative contribution of ZIC3 mutations to both heterotaxy and isolated CHD, we screened the coding region of ZIC3 in 194 unrelated patients, including 61 patients with classic heterotaxy, 93 patients with heart defects characteristic of heterotaxy, and 11 patients with situs inversus totalis. Five novel ZIC3 mutations in three classic heterotaxy kindreds and two sporadic CHD cases were identified. None of these alleles was found in 97 ethnically matched control samples. On the basis of these analyses, we conclude that the phenotypic spectrum of ZIC3 mutations should be expanded to include affected females and CHD not typical for heterotaxy. This screening of a cohort of patients with sporadic heterotaxy indicates that ZIC3 mutations account for â¼1% of affected individuals. Missense and nonsense mutations were found in the highly conserved zinc fingerâbinding domain and in the N-terminal protein domain. Functional analysis of all currently known ZIC3 point mutations indicates that mutations in the putative zinc finger DNA binding domain and in the N-terminal domain result in loss of reporter gene transactivation. It is surprising that transfection studies demonstrate aberrant cytoplasmic localization resulting from mutations between amino acids 253â323 of the ZIC3 protein, indicating that the pathogenesis of a subset of ZIC3 mutations results at least in part from failure of appropriate nuclear localization. These results further expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of ZIC3 mutations and provide initial mechanistic insight into their functional consequences.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of colon cancer associated with intestinal malrotation and mesenterium ileocolicum commune. A 34-year-old man with a 2-month history of diarrhea associated with abdominal pain and weight loss underwent abdominal ultrasonography, colonscopy with biopsies and abdominal computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast. A right colonic neoplasm was diagnosed, observed only at surgery, as neither computed tomography or ultrasonography showed the intestinal malrotation. Particularly, the third and the fourth part of the duodenum descended vertically, without Treitz's ligament in support to the duodeno-jejunal flexure. The small bowel and the colon were located in the right and left side of the abdominal cavity, respectively. The anomaly of situs viscerum inversus influenced the surgical strategy in this case because of the vascular and lymphatic anomalies. Lymphatic vessels were therefore marked with subserosal injection of patent blue in the proximity of the tumor. Subsequently, right colectomy was performed. Colectomy extended from the distal ileum to the descending colon, by ligature of the right colic artery and vein at the origin from the superior mesenteric vessels. Patent blue guided lymphadenectomy was also performed with curative intent. Finally, a mechanical ileo-colic anastomosis was carried out. After right colectomy and ileo-descending anastomosis, the Ladd's procedure for intestinal malrotation was unnecessary. The authors believe that this strategy, despite the anatomical difficulties, represents an effective procedure for the radical surgical treatment of the right colon cancer associated with anomalies of intestinal rotation and fixation.\n\nThe Role of Cerl2 in the Establishment of Left-Right Asymmetries during Axis Formation and Heart Development\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe formation of the asymmetric left-right (LR) body axis is one of the fundamental aspects of vertebrate embryonic development, and one still raising passionate discussions among scientists. Although the conserved role of nodal is unquestionable in this process, several of the details around this signaling cascade are still unanswered. To further understand this mechanism, we have been studying Cerberus-like 2 (Cerl2), an inhibitor of Nodal, and its role in the generation of asymmetries in the early vertebrate embryo. The absence of Cerl2 results in a wide spectrum of malformations commonly known as heterotaxia, which comprises defects in either global organ position (e.g., situs inversus totalis), reversed orientation of at least one organ (e.g., situs ambiguus), and mirror images of usually asymmetric paired organs (e.g., left or right isomerisms of the lungs). Moreover, these laterality defects are frequently associated with congenital heart diseases (e.g., transposition of the great arteries, or atrioventricular septal defects). Here, reviewing the knowledge on the establishment of LR asymmetry in mouse embryos, the emerging conclusion is that as necessary as is the activation of the Nodal signaling cascade, the tight control that Cerl2-mediates on Nodal signaling is equally important, and that generates a further regionalized LR genetic program in the proper time and space.

In addition to the asymmetry of internal organs (visceral), there is also functional (i.e., asymmetrical functioning of organs on the left and right sides of the body) and behavioral asymmetry. The question of a possible association between different types of asymmetry is still open. The study of the mechanisms of such association, in addition to the fundamental interest, has important applications for biomedicine, primarily for the understanding of the brain functioning in health and disease and for the development of methods of treatment of certain mental diseases, such as schizophrenia and autism, for which the disturbance of left-right asymmetry of the brain was shown. To study the deep association between different types of asymmetry, it is necessary to obtain adequate animal models (primarily animals with inverted visceral organs, situs inversus totalis). There are two main possible approaches to obtaining such model organisms: mutagenesis followed by selection of mutant strains with mutations in the genes that affect the formation of the left-right visceral asymmetry and experimental obtaining of animals with inverted internal organs. This review focuses on the second approach. We describe the theoretical models for establishing left-right asymmetry and possible experimental approaches to obtaining animals with inverted internal organs.\n\nRare variants in the notch signaling pathway describe a novel type of autosomal recessive Klippel-Feil syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaraca, Ender; Yuregir, Ozge O; Bozdogan, Sevcan T; Aslan, Huseyin; Pehlivan, Davut; Jhangiani, Shalini N; Akdemir, Zeynep C; Gambin, Tomasz; Bayram, Yavuz; Atik, Mehmed M; Erdin, Serkan; Muzny, Donna; Gibbs, Richard A; Lupski, James R\n\n2015-11-01\n\nKlippel-Feil syndrome is a rare disorder represented by a subgroup of segmentation defects of the vertebrae and characterized by fusion of the cervical vertebrae, low posterior hairline, and short neck with limited motion. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns were reported in families with Klippel-Feil. Mutated genes for both dominant (GDF6 and GDF3) and recessive (MEOX1) forms of Klippel-Feil syndrome have been shown to be involved in somite development via transcription regulation and signaling pathways. Heterotaxy arises from defects in proteins that function in the development of left-right asymmetry of the developing embryo. We describe a consanguineous family with a male proband who presents with classical Klippel-Feil syndrome together with heterotaxy (situs inversus totalis). The present patient also had Sprengel's deformity, deformity of the sternum, and a solitary kidney. Using exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.299delT; p.L100fs) in RIPPLY2, a gene shown to play a crucial role in somitogenesis and participate in the Notch signaling pathway via negatively regulating Tbx6. Our data confirm RIPPLY2 as a novel gene for autosomal recessive Klippel-Feil syndrome, and in addition-from a mechanistic standpoint-suggest the possibility that mutations in RIPPLY2 could also lead to heterotaxy.

Most of the disease-causing mutations identified to date involve the heavy (dynein axonemal heavy chain 5) or intermediate(dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1) chain dynein genes in ciliary outer dynein arms, although a few mutations have been noted in other genes. Clinical molecular genetic testing for primary ciliary dyskinesia is available for the most common mutations. The respiratory manifestations of primary ciliary dyskinesia (chronic bronchitis leading to bronchiectasis, chronic rhino-sinusitis, and chronic otitis media)reflect impaired mucociliary clearance owing to defective axonemal structure. Ciliary ultrastructural analysis in most patients (>80%) reveals defective dynein arms, although defects in other axonemal components have also been observed. Approximately 50% of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have laterality defects (including situs inversus totalis and, less commonly, heterotaxy, and congenital heart disease),reflecting dysfunction of embryological nodal cilia. Male infertility is common and reflects defects in sperm tail axonemes. Most patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a history of neonatal respiratory distress, suggesting that motile cilia play a role in fluid clearance during the transition from a fetal to neonatal lung. Ciliopathies involving sensory cilia, including autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Alstrom syndrome, may have chronic respiratory symptoms and even bronchiectasis suggesting clinical overlap with primary ciliary dyskinesia.\n\nAssociation of PKD2 (polycystin 2) mutations with left-right laterality defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nBataille, Stanislas; Demoulin, Nathalie; Devuyst, Olivier; AudrÃ©zet, Marie-Pierre; Dahan, Karin; Godin, Michel; FontÃ¨s, Michel; Pirson, Yves; Burtey, StÃ©phane\n\n2011-09-01\n\nMutations in the PKD1 (polycystin 1) and PKD2 (polycystin 2) genes cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Most Pkd2-null mouse embryos present with left-right laterality defects. For the first time, we report the association of ADPKD resulting from a mutation in PKD2 and left-right asymmetry defects. PKD1 and PKD2 were screened for mutations or large genomic rearrangements in 3 unrelated patients with ADPKD presenting with laterality defects: dextrocardia in one and situs inversus totalis in 2 others. A large gene deletion, a single-exon duplication, and an in-frame duplication respectively, were found in the 3 patients. These polymorphisms were found in all tested relatives with ADPKD, but were absent in unaffected related individuals. No left-right anomalies were found in other members of the 3 families. A possible association between heterotaxia and a PKD2 mutation in our 3 patients is suggested by: (1) the existence of laterality defects in Pkd2-null mouse and zebrafish models and (2) detection of a pathogenic PKD2 mutation in the 3 probands, although PKD2 mutations account for only 15% of ADPKD families. The presence of left-right laterality defects should be systematically screened in larger cohorts of patients with ADPKD harboring PKD2 mutations. Copyright Â© 2011 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

She had bronchial asthma and bilateral sinusitis during her childhood. She married and experienced childbirth. In December 2003, she was admitted to our Division complaining of wheezing, expectoration and dyspnea on effort. Bronciectasis was visualized on chest X-ray and CT. Electron microscopic examination of the nasal cavity epithelium and bronchial epithelial cilia revealed a deficit of bilateral dynein arms. These findings, helped establish a diagnosis of Kartagener's syndrome, which is characterized by primary ciliary dyskinesia. The restrictive and obstructive pulmonary dysfunction with increase of residual volume in the lung function tests and diffuse centrilobular small nodules with hyperinflation on chest CT were consistent with the findings of diffuse panbronchilitis (DPB) and suggested extended obliterative peripheral airway disease. Clarithromycin which is highly effective for DPB failed to prevent the aggravation of airway infection, arousing the concern about the progression into chronic respiratory failure.\n\nEvaluation of the portal vein after duodenoduodenostomy for congenital duodenal stenosis associated with the preduodenal superior mesenteric vein, situs inversus, polysplenia, and malrotation.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhno, Koichi; Nakamura, Tetsuro; Azuma, Takashi; Yoshida, Tatusyuki; Hayashi, Hiroaki; Nakahira, Masashi; Nishigaki, Kyoichi; Kawahira, Yoichi; Ueno, Takayoshi\n\n2007-02-01\n\nA male infant weighting 2970 g with total situs inversus, polysplenia, malrotation, duodenal stenosis, and complex cardiac anomalies, was admitted to our hospital. At 4 days of age, he underwent surgery that revealed a blood vessel passing over the duodenum from the mesenterium to the porta hepatis. A loose overbridging duodenoduodenostomy was performed to prevent compression of the vessel. The cardiac anomalies were corrected, and he could eat unrestricted diets. At the age of 1 year and 3 months, a 3-dimensional computed tomographic scan demonstrated that the vessel on the duodenum was the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and it formed the portal vein with the splenic vein at the porta hepatis. Further, the scan revealed no compression of the SMV at the anastomosis. Doppler ultrasonography revealed a normal portal blood flow of 118.6 mL/min. This report describes the junction between the SMV and the splenic vein in a patient who had the SMV passing over the duodenum from the mesenterium. Correctly, patients previously diagnosed with a preduodenal portal vein could have a preduodenal SMV. The loose overbridging duodenoduodenostomy had advantages not only in passage of the anastomosis but also in maintenance of the portal blood flow for the congenital duodenal obstruction with the preduodenal SMV.\n\nA new heterozygous mutation of the FOXL2 gene is associated with a large ovarian cyst and ovarian dysfunction in an adolescent girl with blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaile, K; Stobbe, H; TrÃ¶bs, R B; Kiess, W; PfÃ¤ffle, R\n\n2005-09-01\n\nBlepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant syndrome in which eyelid malformation is associated with (type I BPES) or without premature ovarian failure (type II BPES). Mutations of a putative winged helix/forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 account for both types of BPES. We report on a 16-year-old adolescent girl with blepharophimosis and ptosis. Subsequently she developed oligomenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea for 6 months, and an extremely large cyst of one ovary. The cyst contained 8 l of cyst fluid and histopathology displayed a large corpus luteum cyst. Following laparotomy, gonadotropin levels were elevated (LH 17.2 U/l, FSH 29.4 U/l) and estradiol levels decreased (67 pmol/l). Because of clinical aspects of BPES and abnormal ovarian function we suspected a mutation of her FOXL2 gene and found a new in-frame mutation (904_939dup36) on one allele, leading to a 12 alanine expansion within the polyalanine domain. We conclude that the FOXL2 mutation 904_939dup36 may account not only for blepharophimosis and ptosis but also for ovarian dysfunction and growth of the large corpus luteum cyst. In contrast to known FOXL2 mutations with polyalanine expansions and association with BPES type II, clinical aspects of our girl may indicate some degree of ovarian dysfunction that might finally lead to BPES type I with premature ovarian failure.\n\nGenetic basis of human left-right asymmetry disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeng, Hao; Xia, Hong; Deng, Sheng\n\n2015-01-27\n\nHumans and other vertebrates exhibit left-right (LR) asymmetric arrangement of the internal organs, and failure to establish normal LR asymmetry leads to internal laterality disorders, including situs inversus and heterotaxy. Situs inversus is complete mirror-imaged arrangement of the internal organs along LR axis, whereas heterotaxy is abnormal arrangement of the internal thoraco-abdominal organs across LR axis of the body, most of which are associated with complex cardiovascular malformations. Both disorders are genetically heterogeneous with reduced penetrance, presumably because of monogenic, polygenic or multifactorial causes. Research in genetics of LR asymmetry disorders has been extremely prolific over the past 17 years, and a series of loci and disease genes involved in situs inversus and heterotaxy have been described. The review highlights the classification, chromosomal abnormalities, pathogenic genes and the possible mechanism of human LR asymmetry disorders.\n\nBi-allelic Mutations in PKD1L1 Are Associated with Laterality Defects in Humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nVetrini, Francesco; D'Alessandro, Lisa C A; Akdemir, Zeynep C; Braxton, Alicia; Azamian, Mahshid S; Eldomery, Mohammad K; Miller, Kathryn; Kois, Chelsea; Sack, Virginia; Shur, Natasha; Rijhsinghani, Asha; Chandarana, Jignesh; Ding, Yan; Holtzman, Judy; Jhangiani, Shalini N; Muzny, Donna M; Gibbs, Richard A; Eng, Christine M; Hanchard, Neil A; Harel, Tamar; Rosenfeld, Jill A; Belmont, John W; Lupski, James R; Yang, Yaping\n\n2016-10-06\n\nDisruption of the establishment of left-right (L-R) asymmetry leads to situs anomalies ranging from situs inversus totalis (SIT) to situs ambiguus (heterotaxy). The genetic causes of laterality defects in humans are highly heterogeneous. Via whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified homozygous mutations in PKD1L1 from three affected individuals in two unrelated families. PKD1L1 encodes a polycystin-1-like protein and its loss of function is known to cause laterality defects in mouse and medaka fish models. Family 1 had one fetus and one deceased child with heterotaxy and complex congenital heart malformations. WES identified a homozygous splicing mutation, c.6473+2_6473+3delTG, which disrupts the invariant splice donor site in intron 42, in both affected individuals. In the second family, a homozygous c.5072G>C (p.Cys1691Ser) missense mutation was detected in an individual with SIT and congenital heart disease. The p.Cys1691Ser substitution affects a highly conserved cysteine residue and is predicted by molecular modeling to disrupt a disulfide bridge essential for the proper folding of the G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS) motif. Damaging effects associated with substitutions of this conserved cysteine residue in the GPS motif have also been reported in other genes, namely GPR56, BAI3, and PKD1 in human and lat-1 in C.Â elegans, further supporting the likely pathogenicity of p.Cys1691Ser in PKD1L1. The identification of bi-allelic PKD1L1 mutations recapitulates previous findings regarding phenotypic consequences of loss of function of the orthologous genes in mice and medaka fish and further expands our understanding of genetic contributions to laterality defects in humans.

Dextrocardia with situs inversus is also called mirror-image dextrocardia. A combination of mirror-image dextrocardia with medulloblastoma has not been reported previously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this rare combination in a family with medulloblastoma. The clinical manifestation, radiographic characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of 3 medulloblastoma cases in 2 cousins and their maternal uncle was described. Tumor samples of the 2 cousins were first examined for histologic subtypes. Total RNA of their tumors was extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. Then, expression of 22 subgroup-specific genes and 3 housekeeping genes was analyzed by the NanoString nCounter Analysis System. The posttest data were normalized by NanoStringNorm package for molecular subgroup prediction. The proband remains tumor free and alive up to the latest follow-up. His cousin, who had combined mirror-image dextrocardia with situs inversus, died of anoxia after surgery and his uncle died of tumor 2.5 years after surgery. Medulloblastoma of the 2 cousins was classified as classic and molecular group 4 subtype. The same classic and molecular group 4 subtype of the 2 cousins may suggest a similar genetic predisposition. Involvement of the Otx2 gene dysfunction in both group 4 subtype medulloblastoma and mirror-image dextrocardia with situs inversus points to a possible mechanism that dysfunction of a shared signaling pathway such as Otx2 might be the underlying cause of these 2 conditions in this family.

The active preparation produced a highly significant incidence of hair regrowth. A cosmetically acceptable response was noted in 16 patients. No side effects were seen. The study confirmed that topical minoxidil will induce new hair growth in alopecia areata but that it is less likely to do so in more severe and extensive disease. Furthermore, patients with alopecia universalis and totalis may not respond at all. Nevertheless, as compared with other drugs minoxidil applied topically is relatively non-toxic, is easy to use, and has no systemic or local side effects.

There are no reliably effective therapies for AA. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Janus kinase 1/3 inhibitor, tofacitinib, in a series of patients over an extended period of time. This is a retrospective study of patients age 18Â years or older with AA with at least 40% scalp hair loss treated with tofacitinib. The primary end point was the percent change in Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score during treatment. Ninety patients met inclusion criteria. Of 65 potential responders to therapy, defined as those with alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis with duration of current episode of disease of 10Â years or less or alopecia areata, 77% achieved a clinical response, with 58% of patients achieving greater than 50% change in SALT score over 4 to 18Â months of treatment. Patients with AA experienced a higher percent change in SALT score than did patients with alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis (81.9% vs 59.0%). Tofacitinib was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. The retrospective nature of the data, the relatively small number of patients, and lack of a control group are limitations. Tofacitinib should be considered for the treatment of severe AA, alopecia totalis, and alopecia universalis; tofacitinib dose response will be better defined by randomized controlled trials.

The twins were joined at the head and thorax. The brain was exencephalic and the neural plate was completely open throughout its length. The notochord was duplicated throughout its entire length. Partial twinning of the neural plate as indicated by histologic reconstruction is suggested with fusion or non-separation of the neural plates in the medial alar wing area. There was complete separation of the neural plates together with duplication of the lower extremities and tails in the caudal region of this specimen.\n\nAutism and Autoimmune Disease: A Family Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMoney, John; And Others\n\n1971-01-01\n\nDescribed in a family in which the youngest boy has early infantile autism, Addison's disease, and moniliasis and two older boys have autoimmune disease with hypoparathyroidism, Addison's disease, moniliasis, and either alopecia totalis or diabetes mellitus, while the oldest boy and parents are symptom free.

Non-interventional case report. A 2-year-old boy with Poland syndrome was referred for ophthalmic evaluation after abnormal optic discs were found on exam. Physical exam at birth revealed right-sided aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle, symbrachydactyly, hypoplastic scapula, and an abnormal third rib. On dilated examination the optic nerve heads were dysplastic. The findings included multiple cilioretinal vessels, situs inversus, inferotemporal excavation, and surrounding pigmentary disturbances. Only one case of optic disc anomaly has been reported in Poland syndrome and was described as morning glory syndrome. The optic discs in our patient do not fit well with other optic disc excavation syndromes but are most reminiscent of those in papillorenal syndrome. As both Poland syndrome and papillorenal syndrome share vascular dysfunction as a possible etiology, this case adds to the literature of vascular dysgenesis in Poland syndrome.\n\nDiprosopus with multiple craniofacial, musculoskeletal, and cardiac defects in a purebred Suffolk lamb.\n\nPubMed\n\nKerr, Nancy J\n\n2007-10-01\n\nA stillborn Suffolk ewe lamb with 2 heads was found to have tarsal arthrogryposis, kypholordosis, craniorachischisis totalis, cheiloschisis, palatoschisis, deviation of the right maxilla, prognathia, patent ductus arteriosus, 3 ventricular septal defects, and 4 great vessels.

Clinical features include typical facial gestalt, atrophy of the skin, and hypotrichosis. Ophthalmologic abnormalities, normally present in HSS, are only found in one of the two patients. Both of them have respiratory problems secondary to the classical narrow upper airway described in this syndrome. Both these patients have laterality defects and one has additional structural cardiac malformations. Cardiac defects have occasionally been reported in the HSS literature, but are not considered as a classical feature of the syndrome. Situs inversus has never been reported in this syndrome. Almost all HSS cases have been sporadic and their origin and inheritance pattern remain unknown.\n\nBlepharophimosis, ptosis, polythelia and brachydactyly (BPPB): a new autosomal dominant syndrome?\n\nPubMed\n\nWittebol-Post, D; Hennekam, R C\n\n1993-10-01\n\nA father and two sons with blepharophimosis, ptosis, polythelia and brachydactyly are presented, apparently without other abnormalities.

Consequences for sequential chamber localisation.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMacartney, F J; Zuberbuhler, J R; Anderson, R H\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe atrial morphology and venous connections were assessed \"blind\" in 51 necropsy specimens from patients with visceral heterotaxy. This was compared with bronchial morphology as established by dissection. Six specimens were found to have both atria and bronchi in situs solitus or inversus, and were rejected. In the remainder, atrial isomerism was diagnosed, though this required minor revision of the atrial assessment in two patients. Thirty-four patients had isomeric right atria and bronchi, while 11 had isomeric left atria and bronchi. In seven cases, splenic status was unknown, but in seven of the remaining 38 (18.4%) atrial isomerism was not associated with either asplenia or polysplenia. Nevertheless, right isomerism was strongly associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (as is asplenia) and left isomerism was likewise associated with interruption of the inferior vena cava (as is polysplenia). Bilateral superior venae cavae and hepatic veins, and absence of the coronary sinus, were frequent in both forms of isomerism (as they are in asplenia and polysplenia). These findings suggest that atrial situs can be defined as solitus inversus, right isomerism, and left isomerism. This determination of atrial situs is quite independent of any other abnormalities of visceral situs. The high incidence of anomalies of both venous return and common atrium resulted in presumed complete mixing of blood at atrial level in all but one patient (97.8%), making the haemodynamic connection between atria and ventricles almost always ambiguous. To describe this anatomical connection as ambiguous when there are two ventricles present is therefore no more than recognition of anatomical and haemodynamic reality.

While frustrating for patients, it can also be frustrating for clinicians to treat, as there is no definitive treatment. Dermatologists are very familiar with the use of methotrexate for psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases, and this medication is generally well tolerated in children. This study presents a case series reviewing the efficacy of methotrexate in our pediatric patients with alopecia areata, making use of a retrospective chart review design from 2011 to 2016. In this data set, 8/14 subjects (57%) experienced good regrowth with methotrexate, while 3/14 (21%) had a response that could not be assessed due to loss to follow-up or premature discontinuation of the medication. No cases discontinued the medication due to recognized methotrexate side effects. This review suggests methotrexate is a generally safe and often effective medication in pediatric alopecia areata.\n\nSystemic treatment for alopecia areata.\n\nPubMed\n\nOtberg, Nina\n\n2011-01-01\n\nOf the world population, 1.7% is suffering from alopecia areata at some point in their lives.

Pro-brain natriuretic peptide (ProBNP), creatine kinase (CK), cardiac form of CK (CK-MB) and Troponin I are circulatory biomarkers related to cardiac functions. We aimed to determine whether these biomarkers are related to PP and placenta accreta. In this case-control study, fifty-four pregnant women who attended our tertiary care center for perinatology with the diagnosis of PP totalis, and of them, 14 patients with placenta accreta were recruited as the study groups. Forty-six uncomplicated control patients who were matched for age, BMI were also included. Maternal venous ProBNP, CK, CK-MB and Troponin I levels were compared between the three groups. Obstetric history characteristics were comparable among groups, generally. CK and CK-MB levels were similar among three groups. Troponin I levels in the previa and accreta groups were significantly higher than the controls. ProBNP levels in the accreta group were significantly higher than other two groups. The multivariate regression model revealed that ProBNP could predict placental adhesion anomalies. Troponin I and ProBNP levels in PP cases were higher than controls and ProBNP could predict placenta accreta.\n\nInfluence of Roads on the Surrounding Natural Environment - Vegetation, Soil, and Ground Water\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1980-02-01\n\n0 __________ _______ ___ _ ii _ _ _ _ en 12bm ~11 I.IO .Figuz 9.

Nasal symptoms and respiratory distress usually start soon after birth, and by adulthood bronchiectasis is invariable. Organ laterality defects, usually situs inversus, occur in â¼50% of cases. The estimated prevalence of PCD is up to â¼1 per 10,000 births, but it is more common in populations where consanguinity is common. This review examines who to refer for diagnostic testing. It describes the limitations surrounding diagnosis using currently available techniques and considers whether recent advances to genotype patients with PCD will lead to genetic testing and screening to aid diagnosis in the near future.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of PTABO in cases of suspected placental adhesion and to examine antepartal risk factors and perinatal outcomes in women with placental adhesion. Between January 2012 and December 2015, 77 patients who had undergone ultrasonography for evaluation of placenta previa were enrolled in this study. Seventeen of these patients with suspected placental adhesion by ultrasonography and Pelvic MRI underwent PTABO before cesarean section and another 59 patients underwent cesarean section without PTABO. Antepartal risk factors and peripartum maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between patients with PTABO and those without PTABO. More advanced maternal age, longer in gestational weeks at delivery, and more common previous cesarean section history were observed in the PTABO group. Placenta adhesion, abnormal Doppler findings, and frequency of transfusion were more common in the PTABO group. However there was no significant difference in estimated blood loss, hospital days, and neonatal outcome. It had occurred 3 cases of hysterectomy and 1 case of uterine artery embolization after cesarean section in the PTABO group. Close surveillance of antepartum risk factors for placental adhesion using ultrasonography and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging is important to prevention of massive hemorrhage during cesarean section. PTABO before cesarean section might result in reduced blood loss and requirement for transfusion during the operation.\n\nHeterozygous Deletion of FOXA2 Segregates with Disease in a Family with Heterotaxy, Panhypopituitarism, and Biliary Atresia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTsai, Ellen A.; Grochowski, Christopher M.; Falsey, Alexandra M.; Rajagopalan, Ramakrishnan; Wendel, Danielle; Devoto, Marcella; Krantz, Ian D.; Loomes, Kathleen M.; Spinner, Nancy B.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBiliary atresia (BA) is a pediatric cholangiopathy with unknown etiology occurring in isolated and syndromic forms. Laterality defects affecting the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems are the most common features present in syndromic BA. Most cases are sporadic, although reports of familial cases have led to the hypothesis of genetic susceptibility in some patients. We identified a child with BA, malrotation, and interrupted inferior vena cava whose father presented with situs inversus, polysplenia, panhypopituitarism, and mildly dysmorphic facial features. Chromosomal microarray analysis demonstrated a 277kb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 20 which included a single gene, FOXA2, in the proband and her father. This deletion was confirmed to be de novo in the father. The proband and her father share a common diagnosis of heterotaxy, but they also each presented with a variety of other issues. Further genetic screening revealed that the proband carried an additional protein-altering polymorphism (rs1904589; p.His165Arg) in the NODAL gene that is not present in the father, and this variant has been shown to decrease expression of the gene. As FOXA2 can be a regulator of NODAL expression, we propose that haploinsufficiency for FOXA2 combined with a decreased expression of NODAL is the likely cause for syndromic BA in this proband.
