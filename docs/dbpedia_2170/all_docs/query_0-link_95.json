Sign Guestbook at chicagotribune.com/obituaries OBITUARIES Associated Press Donegan, a musician whose sound inspired John Lennon and Pete Townshend to learn to play guitar, has died, his publicist said Monday. Mr .\n\nDonegan died Sunday in Peterborough, central England, while on a tour of Britain, publicist Judy Totton said. He was 71 and had suffered several heart attacks. His hits included Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor (on the Bedpost Old A and Island but he may have been more important to British music for inspiring young talents to imitate and then eclipse his success. He had planned to play later this month in a concert tribute to former Beatle George Harrison at the Royal Albert Hall. Born Anthony Donegan in Glasgow in 1931, he was a fan of American country, folk, and blues music .\n\nHe changed his name as a tribute to bluesman Lonnie Johnson. Skiffle music, which Mr. Donegan introduced to Britain in the 1950s, was a mixture of styles that traced its roots to 1920s America, blending jug band, acoustic, folk, blues, and country and western styles. The son of a symphony violinist, he absorbed a wide range of popular music from across the Atlantic, including the Andrews Sisters, Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong, Josh White, Bessie Smith and Leadbelly. A stint in the British army took him to Vienna, where he was influenced by music on the American Forces Radio Network .\n\nHe formed the Tony Donegan Jazz Band in 1952 and later joined Chris Barber in the Ken Colyer Jazzmen, which became a popular club band. Mr. Donegan, playing guitar or banjo, performed American blues, country and folk songs in the breaks between sets. Colyer quit in 1954, and the renamed Chris Barber Jazz Band made a recording for Decca Records of a few of Mr. skiffle tunes, including Island The album was a hit, but the single release of Island was a phenomenon, spending 22 weeks on the British chart and breaking into the top 20 in the United States .\n\nThe single was credited to Lonnie Donegan Skiffle and he was a star. Skiffle was simple and cheap, apparently within the ability of anyone, regardless of musical talent. All that was needed was a guitar, a snare drum, jugs, a washboard or a standup bass made from a broom handle attached to an empty tea and two chords. Island inspired two young Liverpudlians, John Lennon and George Harrison, to take up guitar. A year later, skiffle group, The Quarrymen, was playing at a church fete near Liverpool when 15- year-old Paul McCartney introduced himself .\n\nTownshend, The lead guitarist, started out as leader of a skiffle group that also featured Who vocalist Roger Dal- trey. Mr. Donegan continued to appear with Van Morrison, who started his career in a Belfast skiffle band, and they teamed up for a 1999 recording, Mr. Donegan was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire, one of highest honors, in 2000. LONNIE DONEGAN, 71 king inspired Beatles, other rockers Lonnie Donegan in 2000 On Nov .\n\n6, 1792, George Washington was re-elected president by a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.

In 1860 former U.S. Rep. Abraham Lincoln (R-Ill.) defeated three candidates for the presidency .\n\nIn 1928, for the first time, presidential election results were flashed on an electronic sign on the New York Times Building, reporting the results of Herbert victory over Alfred E. Smith. In 1962 the United Nations General Assembly called for economic sanctions against South Africa because of the racial policies. In 1976 Benjamin L. Hooks was chosen as executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, succeeding Roy Wilkins .\n\nIn 1984 President Ronald Reagan was elected to a second term, winning every state except Minnesota, home of Democratic opponent Walter Mondale, and the District of Columbia.
