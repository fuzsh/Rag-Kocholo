As women of color, sharing our achievements is pivotal. It's not about bragging; it's stating the facts, the receipts of what you've done. And here's why: ➡ Your achievements show EVERYONE what is possible! ➡ You bring diverse perspectives. Sharing your achievements represents the community and becomes an inspiration. ➡ Seize the Moment. If you don't share your successes, who will? Write your own success story; don't leave it to someone else. I once hesitated to create a simple one-page slide showcasing my accomplishments, fearing I'd come across as too self-promotional. But then I realized something crucial: while I was worrying about being humble, someone else was out there confidently presenting a full deck of their achievements. And guess what? Not an eye was batted. So BE BOLD. Don't wait for someone else to recognize your gifts; create your platform and find a path to be seen. #WomenInLeadership #RepresentationMatters #WomenSupportingWomen

As Women's History Month winds down, I’m reflecting—not just on the iconic shakers and movers who've left their indelible mark on history—but on the gritty, everyday hustle that defines the paths of women today. From Shirley Chisholm's unapologetic claim to her seat at the table, to Jeanette Rankin's trailblazing presence in Congress, and the unwavering voice of the Notorious RBG, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in the halls of justice—they've all thrown down the gauntlet for us to pick up. These were my hero's growing up (clearly I was a kid who loved history, politics, and the rule of law) because they fought tirelessly for their beliefs, even when it was unpopular, while also finding common ground with their ideological opposites. But let's talk about today. About me, you, us—balancing on the tightrope of progress and tradition, percariously balancing work, life, home. I'm a CEO and business owner, but before the titles, I'm a mother teaching my daughter the dance of defiance and grace. How to throw punches in silk gloves, to chase her dreams with a ferocity that's both elegant and relentless, always reminding her that she is powerful and strong. This month is a nod to our past, but I'm hell-bent on making sure it fuels our future. A future where ‘woman’ is synonymous with 'powerhouse.' Whether you're wearing a tiara or a power suit, I hope you know your worth is non-negotiable, your place is wherever you damn well choose it to be. As the curtain falls on this month, let's not take our foot off the gas. Let’s crank it up—make every month, every day, every minute count. And yes, if there's no seat for you at the table, bring a folding chair, or better yet, build a new table—one where there's room for all of us. #Leadership #WomensHistoryMonth #WomenInBusiness #BeTheChange #WomensHistory #PowerfulWomen #LegacyBuilding #SeatAtTheTable #LifeAtCadence3 #LeadLikeAWoman #Empowerment #Innovation #Cadence3 #RoleModel #FutureGenerations #FindingCommonGround

I’ll never forget that conversation with Coco Brown. We’d been discussing work when I segued into sharing a personal struggle with my daughter. Bridging the gap between the professional and the personal isn't always easy, but Coco met me where I was and then some. She listened intently and responded with a warmth of mom advice, sharing her own challenges and experiences. In that moment, Coco fostered a new, deeper connection between us. She reminded me that sharing private, sometimes uncomfortable stories with others allows them to realize that their messy challenges are okay. I met Coco through Gavriella Schuster at a pivotal moment in my career, and from that first encounter, I've been inspired by Coco and all she has accomplished with the Athena Alliance. Coco recognized the significant need for women to be more involved across senior levels in organizations. In 2016, she founded the Athena Alliance with the mission of helping women secure board positions. Coco played a pivotal role in the passing of a California law mandating at least one female representation on public boards (though the law was later overturned...a story for another time). An incredible advocate, Coco is a BOLD and powerful voice for women who may not feel they have the power, resources, or know-how to navigate board positions where their impact can be profound. Coco leads with vulnerability, transparency, and honesty. She freely shares her books, goals, and life with those she works with and is always available to offer help, coaching, or guidance. Coco’s leadership style, rooted in vulnerability, makes her a force to be reckoned with. Coco, I am in awe of you and the extraordinary work you do. —— To commemorate #WomensHistoryMonth, I'm dedicating each day to spotlighting a different woman who inspires me, personally, professionally. Join me in highlighting the incredible women in your life. Advocacy begins here. —— #WomensHistoryMonth #InternationalWomensDay #InternationalWomensDay2024 #InternationalWomensMonth #WomenWhoLead #WomenWhoInspire #UpliftWomen #ExtraordinaryWomen #WomensLeadership #InspiringWomen #CelebrateWomen #CelebrateAllies #AthenaAlliance #ThinkBigger #ModernBoardroom #BoardService #ModernLeadership #AthenaImpact #WomenLeaders

One of my favorite months is coming up… Women’s History Month (and International Women’s Day)! 🎉 Themes for this year: Inspire inclusion, and celebrate the women who advocate for equity, diversity and inclusion. As someone who: ✔️ Raised and is raising strong accomplished young women ✔️ Invests in multiple ways to rise other women up ✔️ Launched Leap Consulting Solutions leveraging my platform to support women through things like #womencrushwednesday celebrating women in our industry ✔️ Co-authored Together We Rise (along with 14 other female Lady Leaders in the staffing industry) where I recount pivotal moments in my life and struggles to rise up and stand out in an industry with few women at its highest ranks… ✔️ Created "THE PLEDGE" : "One deliberate act a day to help another woman rise." I understand first-hand how important it is to celebrate the strides made by women who are paving the way for those who follow. I remain committed to sharing stories that inspire, encourage and support other women and all allies to rise up the underrepresented. And, a big piece of spreading that message is to “take the stage” wherever possible.

I recently came across a beautiful quote that struck a chord with me: "We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they have come." 💪 This quote reminds us of the incredible journey we're all on, especially the remarkable women in the workforce. In this journey, I believe in the strength of unity and the power of collective progress. 💬 Reflecting on Our Journeys: Take a moment to reflect on your own path. How far have you come? Celebrate your achievements, both big and small, as they serve as the foundation for your future success. 🤝 Empowerment Through Togetherness: Just as mothers provide a stable foundation, let's stand together in the workplace. By fostering a supportive environment, we can inspire and uplift each other to achieve remarkable progress. 🚀 Creating a Legacy: Every step we take today contributes to a legacy of progress for the generations to come. Together, we are architects of workplaces where every woman has the opportunity to thrive and make a lasting impact. 🌐 Share Your Story: I invite you to share your experiences and stories in the comments. Let's inspire one another with our journeys and accomplishments. Remember, our collective journey is about supporting one another, breaking barriers, and achieving new heights.

Together, we can rise and rewrite the narrative. 📖 In the staffing industry, the journey toward diversity and inclusion starts strong at the entry level with a 48% representation of women. However, these numbers plummet to a mere 21% in the C-Suite, and shockingly, only 4% for women of color. It's time we rewrite these statistics and pave the way for a more equitable future. The Lady Leaders Book "Together We Rise" is a message of shattering stereotypes, nurturing self-assurance, and empowering the next generation of leaders to take the reins. It's a rallying call for women to stand by each other and for all allies to uplift the voices of the underrepresented. Proceeds from the sales of "Together We Rise" are dedicated to organizations working to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our inaugural partner is the American Staffing Association's Women in Leadership Scholarship Program, committed to amplifying the visibility of women within the staffing industry and providing scholarships to cover registration fees for high-profile industry events.
