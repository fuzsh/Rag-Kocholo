To remain economically competitive, companies must be capable of identifying trends and developing appropriate products/services – or even anticipating and bringing about change themselves.\n\nIn short, businesses need to be able to innovate.\n\nOver the years, we have benefited from the support of subcontractors whose specialized skills added useful value to our clients’ projects. These skills are varied and include collective intelligence, design studio (generic and sectoral), and graphic overviews of innovative ideas.\n\nThanks to our clients’ satisfaction with the quality of service provided by our partners – who share our values of listening, support, and innovation – we have developed a relationship built on trust. It is thus with confidence that we can work together on future projects."
