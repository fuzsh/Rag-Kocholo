        "text": "At the University of West Georgia, we hold our donors close to our hearts because their support allows us to change students' lives.\n\nScott Evans\n\n\"This is so significant,\" said Jeff Reber, associate professor of psychology. \"We serve a large number of the underserved population. They have financial and advising needs. This will open doors for them, and they will be so grateful to know of Misty’s care for her community.\"\n\nThe University of West Georgia will once again benefit from the generosity of others with the establishment of the Misty Evans Endowed Scholarship Fund. The fund was established by Misty’s husband, Scott Evans, and her sister, Danielle Tackett, to serve as a lasting tribute to her dedication to her family and community.\n\nAfter graduating from Haralson County High School, Misty received her bachelor’s in psychology in 2002 from the University of West Georgia, followed by her master’s degree in 2004. Misty had a strong love for animals. That love was shown daily in her service to the West Georgia Spay Neuter Clinic, where she served as director. She was also a member of the Carrollton First United Methodist Church.\n\nThe fund will be awarded to female psychology undergraduate students with overall GPAs of 2.50 or higher who are active in community service, preferably in animal welfare organizations.\n\nDr. Earl Perry\n\n\"I am extremely pleased to be able to endow this scholarship,\" Dr. Perry said. \"I am also pleased to be able to state that I am within a few hundred dollars of having money accumulated to fund similar scholarship endowment agreements I have with my two alma maters.\"\n\nIf you have ever received or applied for a scholarship to pay for school then you can relate to University of West Georgia Professor of Mathematics Emeritus Dr. Earl Perry. Born into a financially poor family, he made his way through college with the help of charitable scholarships. Just like someone else had the confidence in him, today he continues to do the same for other scholars like him, no matter their background. He recently established an endowment in the sum of $50,000 for the mathematics department at UWG.\n\nFred and Lillian O'Neal\n\n\"This was really a no-brainer for us. We do know, from being students ourselves, the challenges that are faced. We funded the bulk of our own educations. I had three jobs when I was going through school. We made it through, but we realize that funding does help in the environment we’re in now because it does allow you to put more effort into your education. And, of course, we want to make sure all students have an opportunity for an education.\n\nHopefully, this will open up some new possibilities for students, too. We feel like the university gave us so much, there are so many resources here. So this is a way for us to give back, because there are so many intangibles that you get through an education.\"\n\nFred '82 '85 '88 and Lillian O’Neal '86 are powerhouses in the local community, serving on the boards of multiple civic organizations and volunteering their time to better the lives of others. Fred has grown a successful career in Carrollton as a financial advisor the past 28 years while also contributing to UWG boards and committees.\n\nFred and Lillian have given tirelessly of their time and themselves to see that today’s youth have a better tomorrow. Now, they continue that legacy of selfless giving by bequeathing a portion of their estate to UWG to aid the university in recruiting and retaining a diverse student population."
