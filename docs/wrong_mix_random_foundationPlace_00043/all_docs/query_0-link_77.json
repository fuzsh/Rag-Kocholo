In a letter to his mother he wrote that when he got back home, all he wanted was to be with Audrey and their Son Gordon and never leave Humboldt County again. If it hadn't been for his love of racing, he might never have left, or so it seems. Mom and Dad were a team; a perfect pair who drew people to them. Everyone wanted to be around them, and the fun, food, music and campfires at Willow Creek, and the bright light they brought to family life. Dad was a \"motor head\" magnet and at the age of 36 got his expert rating in enduro motorcycle racing. He sponsored hardtop, midget, motorcycle and stock car racing. He was a flagman, announcer, watertruck driver, pitman, whatever it took, he made it happen. He was a 50+ member of the Masonic Lodge #79, a lifetime member of the American Motorcycle Association, Farwest Motorcycle Club, Trinity Trailsters, Retreads, E Clampus Vitus 101 and past president of Six Rivers Racing Association. In 1951 he started K & M Glass Company with his wife Audrey and brought both their children into the business in '67 and '70. In this endeavor they set a high standard of ethics that has kept this fine reputation all these years. During this time in business he trained many men to his expectation of high standards of workmanship. He was like a dad and brother to many and will remain a part of them all. He was a true gentleman, and could fit in with any crowd. Always a great storyteller (Hey Dad, tell 'em about the time Dingo ate the $100 bill!). So many favorite stories, I could never get tired of them. He was funny and not from the era of politically correctness, although he was always polite. Women and children loved him. Men admired him. He was a charming gentleman always. Ross was preceded in death by his wife Audrey Lee Britt Kuhnle; and Fay Britt and Stedman Winter. He is survived by his sister Phyllis M. Wilson; brother Edward C. Kuhnle (Bunny); nieces Debra Kuhnle Heyerman, Susan A., Quillen, Louise McDonell, Nancy Vellis and Renee Miller; nephews David Kuhnle, Daniel Wilson, Jon Wilson, and Storme Winter; and cousins LeeAnn Lantrip and Janeane Camacho.

Captain Dennis Beaulieu had a positive attitude, quick wit, and love of life that was infectious. Dennis fell victim to Multiple System Atrophy, a degenerative neurological malady. Flying airplanes was Dennis' dream job. His passion began as a young boy, when his father took him flying in an Aeronca Champ that today sits in the family garage waiting to someday be rebuilt and flown again by another member of the Beaulieu family, Dennis' 13-year-old son Austin. In college, Dennis worked as a member of the United Auto Workers in Detroit but knew he was destined to fly and nothing was going to stand in his way. He began his aviation career as a commuter pilot in Michigan and then went on to fly for a small cargo airline, Zantop. In November 1978 at age 26, Dennis became a Flying Tiger DC-8 Second Officer. Dennis would go on to fly the B747, DC-10, B727, and finally the MD10 and MD11. He circumnavigated the globe many times in his career and particularly loved flying in Europe. Those who flew with him say it was always a pleasure; he was a true gentleman, the consummate professional, and an excellent Captain. For years Dennis served his fellow pilots as a member of the FDX MEC Professional Standards Committee; a position to which he was well suited. Dennis loved the water almost as much as he loved the sky. Racing his Thistle and Catalina sailboats in San Diego became a passion, one he was able to share with his wife, Marie, and his son Austin. A memorial mass will be held on Friday, October 15th, at Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church in La Mesa at 11:00 a.m. Memorials may be made to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, AZ.\n\nDonald David Rosenberg Donald David Rosenberg, a former resident of Tiburon and a 25 year resident of Oakland, Ca, passed away on October 7, 2010. He is survived by Christa, his wife of 25 years, sons Daniel of Tampa, Florida (and his wife Julia), David of Modiin Illit, Israel (and his wife Hila), his first wife of 20 years (& mother of son Daniel) Ann Marie Meagher M.D. in Tiburon, CA, grandchildren Daniel (and his wife Michelle), Hannah, & Meir, siblings Muriel Wakefield, Nancy Schmid (and husband Herb), Louis Hall (and husband Ken), and Alan Rosenberg, and six nieces & nephews and numerous grand-nieces & nephews. Donald was born June 11, 1930 in Milwaukee, Wisonsin to Harry and Yetta Rosenberg. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin and Stanford University Law School with honors. He served in the, . Upon leaving the Navy, he was hired by the Judicial Council of California, where he helped draft laws for the state. He was then hired as the first in northern California in the then new program that provided court commissioners to adjudicate cases in a similar capacity to judges. He was the traffic commissioner in Oakland for 20 years where he did the weighted caseload work of three commissioners or judges. It was his practice to spend many lunch hours driving to intersections to see if what the defendants described as the conditions that prevented them from following the law were valid. He was active in many political and academic committees including leading discussion groups at the Commonwealth Club. He was also involved with the Sierra Club, Americans United for Life, Smile Train, the Nature Conservancy, and many more. In 1991, he lost his home in the Oakland Hills fire. His home was about 100 yards from where the fire started, and before it was fully engaged, Donald tried to help a neighbor extinguish the fire on his roof before realizing the fire was spreading quickly and he barely made it out before the fire reached him. Donald was beloved for his strength, principles, kindness, intelligence, wisdom, willingness to help others, hard work, and toughness.

Later, she would meet and marry the love of her life, Merle Joseph Finnerty (Bones). Together they made their home in Baden, Pa., along with their two children, Deborah Lynn Brook (Finnerty) and Merle Joseph Finnerty Jr. (Joe), both of Vacaville. It was during this time Dolores accepted the Lord as her personal Savior; which she found comfort after Bones passed away in 1971., In 1984, Dolores joined both her children in Merced, Calif. She attended Merced Community College and also worked there. When she wasn't working or studying, she was a Red Cross volunteer at Castle Air Force Base. She also spent countless hours at the local nursing home visiting people who didn't have family. In 1987, she once again followed her children to Vacaville, Calif.

Dolores had many friends at Solano Community College and looked forward to each day with her staff and students., Dolores' two main purposes in life were to serve her Lord and to care for her children. You knew not to disturb her in the early hours of the morning, because that was her time to read her Bible and worship.

While raising them, she always made sure they went on vacations, had grand birthday parties, took them to the drive-in theater to see a scary movie, or just open her home to her children's friends to hang-out or go swimming. Her children loved playing practical jokes on Dolores and on one particular occasion she made her young son, Joe, undress outside because she knew he had a snake. Only problem is she didn't know he hid the snake in his folded clothes. Once Joe came in the house you could hear a blood curdling scream for miles!, Dolores enjoyed life and the people she met to the fullest. She always felt the need to show compassion to those less fortunate, especially the homeless. Her other passion was traveling with both her children while they were in the Air Force. Along with them she got to see the world! When she wasn't taking care of all her plants, she would be relaxing reading a good book., Dolores is survived by both her children; son-in-law, Gary Brook; and daughter-in-law, Charmaine (Woodard) Finnerty.

But he had no pretentions; he irreverently strove to be ordinary, and he yearned to transcend the impeachable trappings of truth. Through a strong sense of duty, ethics, and loyalty; through his support of a bright girl growing up with few options in rural Mexico; through meditative walks to Lake Ilsanjo and earthy baths in Wilbur Hot Springs; through altered states of consciousness, deep-bellied humor, and gentle-hearted whimsy; through music, poetry, aikido, and flights inside the sky; and through a sometimes stubborn but deeply potent embrace of family and friends; he strove to connect to love. Early Saturday morning, with wife and son by his side, Milton gently sent-up his collected wisdom; tokens of his sweet heart and active mind are left behind. He was deeply loved and will be achingly missed by many. Milt was the first board-certified neuropsychologist in Sonoma County, where he practiced as a clinical psychologist for over thirty years. He was a longtime member and served numerous times on the executive board of the Redwood Psychological Association (President 1985, 1999-2001; 2007-2008); a member of the American Psychological Association (Division of Neuropsychology); California Psychological Association; International Neuropsychological Society; National Academy of Neuropsychology; Northern California Neuropsychology Forum; and Society for Personality Assessment. Born in Pittsburgh, PA to parents Milton and Ruth, he grew up among the cheering fans of the Pittsburgh Pirates, most memorably during the 1960 World Series. Milt asked that as you remember him, you also remember Roberto Clemente, the right fielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Roberto was one of Milt's heroes and one his many soul mates. Milton will be missed by his wife Lea Goode-Harris; son Orin Harris, and Orin's mother, Elizabeth Harris; brother and wife, Richard Harris and Marjorie Levinson; nieces Olivia and Cecily, nephew Daniel; in-laws Dale, Nydia, and MimÃ­ Goode; and by his many friends and colleagues near and far.

The beloved matriarch was the last of the second generation of the Seghesio wine family; her entire life was dedicated to family, farming and the wine business. Rachel Ann was aided in life by her faith, rich friendships and the love of reading, gardening and travel. Rachel Ann was born in Healdsburg on February 28th, 1930 to Emil and Camille Passalacqua who instilled in her a strong Catholic faith, a love of farming and an appreciation for learning. Her early childhood was deeply influenced by grapes and wine.

Her wine roots are traced to Oliveto Winery in Healdsburg (purchased by her grandmother Rachele Passalacqua in 1934) where her father was the winemaker. After graduating from Healdsburg High School, she attended San Francisco College for Women (Lone Mountain) and received her B.A. Returning home, she taught first and second grade in Sonoma County Schools for five years during which time she met her future husband Eugene Peter Seghesio. Upon their marriage in 1956, she moved to the Home Ranch at Chianti, California, becoming active and devoted to the Seghesio family wine business.

She quickly developed a reputation for her gracious hospitality and legendary culinary skills whereby she brought her extensive garden to the table. She later became a travelling ambassador for the winery into the marketplace. Her last role, by far the most rewarding, began in 2006 when, at the request of her son Peter, she began working as hostess of the family's weekend wine "
