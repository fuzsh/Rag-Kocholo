        "text": "Nestled in Palm Desert, Alps Village is a culinary gem showcasing a delightful fusion of European flavors crafted by Chef Milka and her daughter, Blanka. Milka's culinary journey from her birthplace in Mostar, former Yugoslavia, to her time in Germany during the Yugoslavian war has profoundly influenced the menu, which boasts a diverse selection of specialties from Germany and the former Yugoslavia, including traditional dishes from Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia such as Schnitzels, Cevapcici, homemade sauerkraut, Cabbage Rolls, Goulash, salads, desserts, and more. As a family-owned and run establishment, Alps Village holds a deep-seated tradition of entertaining and cooking for friends, ultimately leading them to open the restaurant and share their culinary passion with patrons. The restaurant's inviting ambiance provides a welcoming space for guests to savor delicious homemade fare, European beers, and signature cocktails while immersing themselves in the warmth and hospitality that defines the Alps Village dining experience."
