We are still working to reach our goal of welcoming 50 new members to our Partners for Tomorrow monthly giving program.\n\nAt this year’s Hope Awards, Sherylon shared her story.\n\nSherylon lived at Calvary during the pandemic and has since moved into her own home! After leaving Calvary, Sherylon decided to join as a Partner for Tomorrow to “give back what was so freely given to me.” We are so grateful to have Sherylon as part of our monthly giving community.\n\nIn order to achieve our vision of ending homelessness for women in our community, Calvary is growing. Over the next year, we will increase the affordable housing available to women, expand opportunities for women to secure sustainable income, and advocate to improve the lives of women in DC."
