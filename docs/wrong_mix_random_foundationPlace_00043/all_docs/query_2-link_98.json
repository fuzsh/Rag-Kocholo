        "text": "Six and a half hours of hiking, uphill and downhill, which I completed without any problems. (Who would have thought that four days ago.) Over the Monte Foresto to Caprese Michelangelo. Again with beautiful viewpoints, back to La Verna, into the Tiber Valley and to the artificial di Montedoglio reservoir (which the path will take me along tomorrow). Now it is mainly sweet chestnut trees, which become more and more numerous the closer we get to the valley.\n\nMichelangelo\n\nNo less a person than King Victor Emmanuel III issued a decree on February 9, 1913, allowing the town to be named Michelangelo in memory of the gifted artist who was born here. His birthplace, which stands high above the village, is now a museum.\n\nHermitage since 1522\n\nHalfway through today's tour, in a clearing at an altitude of 1241 meters (with a fantastic view), you will find the Eremo della Casella. A small chapel is attached to a hostel. Anyone who wants to can spend the night here. Firewood for the fireplace is ready and the table, which is more than 3 meters long, immediately makes me think of the most wonderful thoughts of a happy gathering.\n\nPilgrim acquaintances\n\nSince La Verna, the signposts have become more reliable and the number of pilgrims (Pellegrino) has increased. They are accompanied by two different hiking guides. You quickly find out who is using which guide by exchanging information, and you therefore know in advance who you are likely to meet in which accommodation. Nevertheless, there is always a surprised hello when you cross paths."
