I attended school here and am now proudly raising my family in our town. I have two sons; both are graduates of Desert Hot Springs High School. My oldest son is married and works in healthcare. He has given me my first grandchild, she just had her first birthday on July 6th. My youngest son graduated from the University of California Riverside with a B.A. in English and is now working for the nonprofit Olive Crest in their at-risk youth program.
