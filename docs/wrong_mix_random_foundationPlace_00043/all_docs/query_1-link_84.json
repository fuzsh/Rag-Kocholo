        "text": "If you have received a positive pregnancy test at Birth Choice Centers, you might be eligible for limited obstetric ultrasound. Having an ultrasound will determine if your pregnancy is viable (meaning the fetus is alive). This knowledge is critical in making a pregnancy decision.\n\nUltrasounds are provided through referral to onsite doctors office.\n\nThe Earn While You Learn program empowers expectant and new parents with life skills and child care essentials, equipping you to be the best parent you can be. Not only will you receive emotional and educational support, but with each class you are earning points that can be redeemed in our Baby Shops.\n\nDo you think you might be pregnant? Have questions about how far along you are or need pregnancy verification? Or maybe you just need someone to talk to who doesn’t have a vested interest in the choice you make. Our compassionate staff understands you have a unique set of circumstances and are here to help.\n\nYou have time to explore all your options before you decide what your next step will be. Knowledge is power and every Birth Choice Center is prepared to assist you in finding the answers to the questions you may have.\n\nAll services are at no cost and completely confidential.\n\nThey help with clothes free of charge for kids once a month until they turn 2! This place has amazing, kind & helpful staff! While I was picking out clothes for my two youngest, one of the ladies was reading to my 4 year old it was adorable and beyond helpful!\n\nI didn’t think anyone would listen to me or cared about my problems. But the Birth Choice of the Desert did, they listened and give me the individual attention I really needed. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that they really did care.\n\nThe staff is great and nice. Helped us out throughout the whole pregnancy. Would recommend to anybody to come. If I were to ever have a baby again I would not hesitate to come back. Also, was a good learning experience about the baby."
