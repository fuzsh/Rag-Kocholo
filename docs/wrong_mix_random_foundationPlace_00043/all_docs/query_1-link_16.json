        "text": "A baby boy was born on January 1st, 4:04 a.m. at JFK Memorial Hospital in Indio. His name is Gian Navarrete. Proud father, Daniel Aguirre is stunned at his new son's early achievement.\n\nBaby Gian Navarrete is the first baby born in the desert in 2024. \"I was telling Stephanie that it's gonna be history for him,\" says Aguirre. \"He can say to everyone, hey, I was the first baby in the Coachella Valley 2024. That's crazy.\" Gian's mother, Stephanie Navarette was rushed to the hospital. Nurses at JFK say she checked in by 3:50 a.m. and by 4:04 a.m., Gian was here.\n\nAguirre says he is getting the hang of swaddling. \"I just couldn't believe it,\" says Aguirre. \"He is with us. And that was Gian was inside mommy's belly. It was amazing.\"\n\nNow a family of four. Aguirre gave us a photo of Gian's big brother when he was a baby, saying they looked like twins. Jael Aguirre is Gian's big brother.\n\nBoth brothers as babies: Jael (Left), and Gian (Right)\n\n\"They're gonna be hanging,\" says Aguirre. \"Very, very close. That's that's what we're waiting for. He's going to have a sibling to play around.\"\n\nGian is not going home empty-handed. Jennifer Rios from Desert Care Network presented a certificate and gifts. The nurses at JFK Memorial gave Gian a big bag of baby clothes, bibs, and more.\n\n\"They've been so kind,\" says Aguirre about the nurses at JFK Memorial. \"I mean, everyone was amazed that of course, the hospital was the winner. Because Gian is the first.\"\n\nHere are a few babies born on New Year's Day in the valley.\n\nEach of our hospitals in the desert delivered at least one baby. The first photo is Gian Navarrete born at JFK Memorial at 4:04 a.m., weighing 7 lbs and 14 ounces. The second photo is Sterling born at 4:19 am at Desert Regional Medical. The third baby's name is Asé (pronounced Ah-Shay which means Amen in Yorubian). He was born today at the Eisenhower Family Birth Center at 12:11 p.m. weighing 6 lbs and 9.9 ounces.\n\n\"For all the mothers out there, babies right now, Happy New Year,\" says Aguirre. \"May the lord bless you with many many health.\""
