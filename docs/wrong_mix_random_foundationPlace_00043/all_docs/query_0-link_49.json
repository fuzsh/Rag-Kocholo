He was eloquently drunk, lovingly and pugnaciously drunk. He leaned against the bar of the Old Home Sample Room, the most gilded and urbane saloon in Cato, Missouri, and requested the bartender to join him in \"The Good Old Summer Time,\" the waltz of the day.\n\nBlowing on a glass, polishing it and glancing at Elmer through its flashing rotundity, the bartender remarked that he wasn't much of a hand at this here singing business. But he smiled. No bartender could have done other than smile on Elmer, so inspired and full of gallantry and hell-raising was he, and so dominating was his beefy grin.\n\n\"All right, old socks,\" agreed Elmer. \"Me and my room-mate'll show you some singing as is singing! Meet roommate. Jim Lefferts. Bes' roommate in world. Wouldn't live with him if wasn't! Bes' quarterback in Milwest. Meet roommate.\"\n\nThe bartender again met Mr. Lefferts, with protestations of distinguished pleasure.\n\nElmer and Jim Lefferts retired to a table to nourish the long, rich, chocolate strains suitable to drunken melody. Actually, they sang very well. Jim had a resolute tenor, and as to Elmer Gantry, even more than his bulk, his thick black hair, his venturesome black eyes, you remembered that arousing barytone. He was born to be a senator. He never said anything important, and he always said it sonorously. He could make \"Good morning\" seem profound as Kant, welcoming as a brass band, and uplifting as a cathedral organ. It was a 'cello, his voice, and in the enchantment of it you did not hear his slang, his boasting, his smut, and the dreadful violence which (at this period) he performed on singulars and plurals.\n\nLuxuriously as a wayfarer drinking cool beer they caressed the phrases in linked sweetness long drawn out:\n\nStrolling through the shaaaaady lanes, with your baby-mine,\n\nYou hold her hand and she holds yours, and that's a very good sign\n\nThat she's your tootsey-wootsey in the good old summer time.\n\nElmer wept a little, and blubbered, \"Lez go out and start a scrap. You're lil squirt, Jim. You get somebody to pick on you, and I'll come along and knock his block off. I'll show 'em!\" His voice flared up. He was furious at the wrong about to be suffered. He arched his paws with longing to grasp the non-existent scoundrel. \"By God, I'll knock the tar out of um! Nobody can touch my roommate! Know who I am? Elmer Gantry! Thash me! I'll show um!\"\n\nThe bartender was shuffling toward them, amiably ready for homicide.\n\n\"Shut up, Hell-cat. What you need is 'nother drink. I'll get 'nother drink,\" soothed Jim, and Elmer slid into tears, weeping over the ancient tragic sorrows of one whom he remembered as Jim Lefferts.\n\nInstantly, by some tricky sort of magic, there were two glasses in front of him. He tasted one, and murmured foolishly, \"'Scuse me.\" It was the chase, the water. But they couldn't fool him! The whisky would certainly be in that other lil sawed-off glass. And it was. He was right, as always. With a smirk of self-admiration he sucked in the raw Bourbon. It tickled his throat and made him feel powerful, and at peace with every one save that fellow--he could not recall who, but it was some one whom he would shortly chastise, and after that float into an Elysium of benevolence.\n\nThe barroom was deliriously calming. The sour invigorating stench of beer made him feel healthy. The bar was one long shimmer of beauty--glowing mahogany, exquisite marble rail, dazzling glasses, curiously shaped bottles of unknown liqueurs, piled with a craftiness which made him very happy. The light was dim, completely soothing, coming through fantastic windows such as are found only in churches, saloons, jewelry shops, and other retreats from reality. On the brown plaster walls were sleek naked girls.\n\nHe turned from them. He was empty now of desire for women.\n\n\"That damn' Juanita. Jus' wants to get all she can out of you. That's all,\" he grumbled.\n\nBut there was an interesting affair beside him. A piece of newspaper sprang up, apparently by itself, and slid along the floor. That was a very funny incident, and he laughed greatly.\n\nHe was conscious of a voice which he had been hearing for centuries, echoing from a distant point of light and flashing through ever-widening corridors of a dream.\n\n\"We'll get kicked out of here, Hell-cat. Come on!\"\n\nHe floated up. It was exquisite. His legs moved by themselves, without effort. They did a comic thing once--they got twisted and the right leg leaped in front of the left when, so far as he could make out, it should have been behind. He laughed, and rested against some one's arm, an arm with no body attached to it, which had come out of the Ewigkeit to assist him.\n\nThen unknown invisible blocks, miles of them, his head clearing, and he made grave announcement to a Jim Lefferts who suddenly seemed to be with him:\n\n\"I gotta lick that fellow.\"\n\n\"All right, all right. You might as well go find a nice little fight and get it out of your system!\"\n\nElmer was astonished; he was grieved. His mouth hung open and he drooled with sorrow. But still, he was to be allowed one charming fight, and he revived as he staggered industriously in search of it.\n\nOh, he exulted, it was a great party. For the first time in weeks he was relieved from the boredom of Terwillinger College.\n\n2\n\nElmer Gantry, best known to classmates as Hell-cat, had, this autumn of 1902, been football captain and led the best team Terwillinger College had known in ten years. They had won the championship of the East-middle Kansas Conference, which consisted of ten denominational colleges, all of them with buildings and presidents and chapel services and yells and colors and a standard of scholarship equal to the best high-schools. But since the last night of the football season, with the glorious bonfire in which the young gentlemen had burned up nine tar barrels, the sign of the Jew tailor, and the president's tabby-cat, Elmer had been tortured by boredom.\n\nHe regarded basket-ball and gymnasium antics as light-minded for a football gladiator. When he had come to college, he had supposed he would pick up learnings of cash-value to a lawyer or doctor or insurance man--he had not known which he would become, and in his senior year, aged twenty-two this November, he still was doubtful. But this belief he found fallacious. What good would it be in the courtroom, or at the operating table, to understand trigonometry, or to know (as last spring, up to the examination on European History, he remembered having known) the date of Charlemagne? How much cash would it bring in to quote all that stuff--what the dickens was it now?--all that rot about \"The world is too much around us, early and soon\" from that old fool Wordsworth?\n\nPunk, that's what it was. Better be out in business. But still, if his mother claimed she was doing so well with her millinery business and wanted him to be a college graduate, he'd stick by it. Lot easier than pitching hay or carrying two-by-fours anyway.\n\nDespite his invaluable voice, Elmer had not gone out for debating because of the irritating library-grinding, nor had he taken to prayer and moral eloquence in the Y.M.C.A., for with all the force of his simple and valiant nature he detested piety and admired drunkenness and profanity.\n\nOnce or twice in the class in Public Speaking, when he had repeated the splendors of other great thinkers, Dan'l Webster and Henry Ward Beecher and Chauncey M. Depew, he had known the intoxication of holding an audience with his voice as with his closed hand, holding it, shaking it, lifting it. The debating set urged him to join them, but they were rabbit-faced and spectacled young men, and he viewed as obscene the notion of digging statistics about immigration and the products of San Domingo out of dusty spotted books in the dusty spotted library.\n\nHe kept from flunking only because Jim Lefferts drove him to his books.\n\nJim was less bored by college. He had a relish for the flavor of scholarship. He liked to know things about people dead these thousand years, and he liked doing canned miracles in chemistry. Elmer was astounded that so capable a drinker, a man so deft at \"handing a girl a swell spiel and getting her going\" should find entertainment in Roman chariots and the unenterprising amours of sweet-peas. But himself--no. Not on your life. He'd get out and finish law school and never open another book--kid the juries along and hire some old coot to do the briefs.\n\nTo keep him from absolutely breaking under the burden of hearing the professors squeak, he did have the joy of loafing with Jim, illegally smoking the while; he did have researches into the lovability of co-eds and the baker's daughter; he did revere becoming drunk and world-striding. But he could not afford liquor very often and the co-eds were mostly ugly and earnest.\n\nIt was lamentable to see this broad young man, who would have been so happy in the prize-ring, the fish-market, or the stock exchange, poking through the cobwebbed corridors of Terwillinger.\n\n3\n\nTerwillinger College, founded and preserved by the more zealous Baptists, is on the outskirts of Gritzmacher Springs, Kansas. (The springs have dried up and the Gritzmachers have gone to Los Angeles, to sell bungalows and delicatessen.) It huddles on the prairie, which is storm-racked in winter, frying and dusty in summer, lovely only in the grass-rustling spring or drowsy autumn.\n\nYou would not be likely to mistake Terwillinger College for an Old Folks' Home, because on the campus is a large rock painted with class numerals.\n\nMost of the faculty are ex-ministers.\n\nThere is a men's dormitory, but Elmer Gantry and Jim Lefferts lived together in the town, in a mansion once the pride of the Gritzmachers themselves: a square brick bulk with a white cupola. Their room was unchanged from the days of the original August Gritzmacher; a room heavy with a vast bed of carved black walnut, thick and perpetually dusty brocade curtains, and black walnut chairs hung with scarves that dangled gilt balls. The windows were hard to open. There was about the place the anxious propriety and all the dead hopes of a second-hand furniture shop.\n\nIn this museum, Jim had a surprising and vigorous youthfulness. There was a hint of future flabbiness in Elmer's bulk, but there would never be anything flabby about Jim Lefferts. He was slim, six inches shorter than Elmer, but hard as ivory and as sleek. Though he came from a prairie village, Jim had fastidiousness, a natural elegance. All the items of his wardrobe, the \"ordinary suit,\" distinctly glossy at the elbows, and the dark-brown \"best suit,\" were ready-made, with faltering buttons, and seams that betrayed rough ends of thread, but on him they were graceful. You felt that he would belong to any set in the world which he sufficiently admired. There was a romantic flare to his upturned overcoat collar; the darned bottoms of his trousers did not suggest poverty but a careless and amused ease; and his thoroughly commonplace ties hinted of clubs and regiments.\n\nHis thin face was resolute. You saw only its youthful freshness first, then behind the brightness a taut determination, and his brown eyes were amiably scornful.\n\nJim Lefferts was Elmer's only friend; the only authentic friend he had ever had.\n\nThough Elmer was the athletic idol of the college, though his occult passion, his heavy good looks, caused the college girls to breathe quickly, though his manly laughter was as fetching as his resonant speech, Elmer was never really liked. He was supposed to be the most popular man in college; every one believed that every one else adored him; and none of them wanted to be with him. They were all a bit afraid, a bit uncomfortable, and more than a bit resentful.\n\nIt was not merely that he was a shouter, a pounder on backs, an overwhelming force, so that there was never any refuge of intimacy with him. It was because he was always demanding. Except with his widow mother, whom he vaguely worshiped, and with Jim Lefferts, Elmer assumed that he was the center of the universe and that the rest of the system was valuable only as it afforded him help and pleasure.\n\nHe wanted everything.\n\nHis first year, as the only Freshman who was playing on the college football team, as a large and smiling man who was expected to become a favorite, he was elected president. In that office, he was not much beloved. At class-meetings he cut speakers short, gave the floor only to pretty girls and lads who toadied to him, and roared in the midst of the weightiest debates, \"Aw, come on, cut out this chewing the rag and let's get down to business!\" He collected the class-fund by demanding subscriptions as arbitrarily as a Catholic priest assessing his parishoners for a new church.\n\n\"He'll never hold any office again, not if I can help it!\" muttered one Eddie Fislinger, who, though he was a meager and rusty-haired youth with protruding teeth and an uneasy titter, had attained power in the class by always being present at everything, and by the piety and impressive intimacy of his prayers in the Y.M.C.A.\n\nThere was a custom that the manager of the Athletic Association should not be a member of any team. Elmer forced himself into the managership in Junior year by threatening not to play football if he were not elected. He appointed Jim Lefferts chairman of the ticket committee, and between them, by only the very slightest doctoring of the books, they turned forty dollars to the best of all possible uses.\n\nAt the beginning of Senior year, Elmer announced that he desired to be president again. To elect any one as class-president twice was taboo. The ardent Eddie Fislinger, now president of the Y.M.C.A. and ready to bring his rare talents to the Baptist ministry, asserted after an enjoyable private prayer-meeting in his room that he was going to face Elmer and forbid him to run.\n\n\"Gwan! You don't dare!\" observed a Judas who three minutes before had been wrestling with God under Eddie's coaching.\n\n\"I don't, eh? Watch me! Why, everybody hates him, the darn' hog!\" squeaked Eddie.\n\nBy scurrying behind trees he managed to come face to face with Elmer on the campus. He halted, and spoke of football, quantitative chemistry, and the Arkansas spinster who taught German.\n\nElmer grunted.\n\nDesperately, his voice shrill with desire to change the world, Eddie stammered:\n\n\"Say--say, Hell-cat, you hadn't ought to run for president again. Nobody's ever president twice!\"\n\n\"Somebody's going to be.\"\n\n\"Ah, gee, Elmer, don't run for it. Ah, come on. Course all the fellows are crazy about you but--Nobody's ever been president twice. They'll vote against you.\"\n\n\"Let me catch 'em at it!\"\n\n\"How can you stop it? Honest, Elm--Hell-cat--I'm just speaking for your own good. The voting's secret. You can't tell--\"\n\n\"Huh! The nominations ain't secret! Now you go roll your hoop, Fissy, and let all the yellow coyotes know that anybody that nominates anybody except Uncle Hell-cat will catch it right where the chicken caught the ax. See? And if they tell me they didn't know about this, you'll get merry Hail Columbia for not telling 'em. Get me? If there's anything but an unanimous vote, you won't do any praying the rest of this year!\"\n\nEddie remembered how Elmer and Jim had shown a Freshman his place in society by removing all his clothes and leaving him five miles in the country.\n\nElmer was elected president of the senior class--unanimously.\n\nHe did not know that he was unpopular. He reasoned that men who seemed chilly to him were envious and afraid, and that gave him a feeling of greatness.\n\nThus it happened that he had no friend save Jim Lefferts.\n\nOnly Jim had enough will to bully him into obedient admiration. Elmer swallowed ideas whole; he was a maelstrom of prejudices; but Jim accurately examined every notion that came to him. Jim was selfish enough, but it was with the selfishness of a man who thinks and who is coldly unafraid of any destination to which his thoughts may lead him. The little man treated Elmer like a large damp dog, and Elmer licked his shoes and followed.\n\nHe also knew that Jim, as quarter, was far more the soul of the team than himself as tackle and captain.\n\nA huge young man, Elmer Gantry; six foot one, thick, broad, big handed; a large face, handsome as a Great Dane is handsome, and a swirl of black hair, worn rather long. His eyes were friendly, his smile was friendly--oh, he was always friendly enough; he was merely astonished when he found that you did not understand his importance and did not want to hand over anything he might desire. He was a barytone solo turned into portly flesh; he was a gladiator laughing at the comic distortion of his wounded opponent.\n\nHe could not understand men who shrank from blood, who liked poetry or roses, who did not casually endeavor to seduce every possibly seducible girl. In sonorous arguments with Jim he asserted that \"these fellows that study all the time are just letting on like they're so doggone high and mighty, to show off to those doggone profs that haven't got anything but lemonade in their veins.\"\n\n4\n\nChief adornment of their room was the escritoire of the first Gritzmacher, which held their library. Elmer owned two volumes of Conan Doyle, one of E. P. Roe, and a priceless copy of \"Only a Boy.\" Jim had invested in an encyclopedia which explained any known subject in ten lines, in a \"Pickwick Papers,\" and from some unknown source he had obtained a complete Swinburne, into which he was never known to have looked.\n\nBut his pride was in the possession of Ingersoll's \"Some Mistakes of Moses,\" and Paine's \"The Age of Reason.\" For Jim Lefferts was the college freethinker, the only man in Terwillinger who doubted that Lot's wife had been changed into salt for once looking back at the town where, among the young married set, she had had so good a time; who doubted that Methuselah lived to nine hundred and sixty-nine.\n\nThey whispered of Jim all through the pious dens of Terwillinger. Elmer himself was frightened, for after giving minutes and minutes to theological profundities Elmer had concluded that \"there must be something to all this religious guff if all these wise old birds believe it, and some time a fellow had ought to settle down and cut out the hell-raising.\" Probably Jim would have been kicked out of college by the ministerial professors if he had not had so reverent a way of asking questions when they wrestled with his infidelity that they let go of him in nervous confusion.\n\nEven the President, the Rev. Dr. Willoughby Quarles, formerly pastor of the Rock of Ages Baptist Church of Moline, Ill., than whom no man had written more about the necessity of baptism by immersion, in fact in every way a thoroughly than-whom figure--even when Dr. Quarles tackled Jim and demanded, \"Are you getting the best out of our instruction, young man? Do you believe with us not only in the plenary inspiration of the Bible but also in its verbal inspiration, and that it is the only divine rule of faith and practise?\" then Jim looked docile and said mildly:\n\n\"Oh, yes, Doctor. There's just one or two little things that have been worrying me, Doctor. I've taken them to the Lord in prayer, but he doesn't seem to help me much. I'm sure you can. Now why did Joshua need to have the sun stand still? Of course it happened--it says so right in Scripture. But why did he need to, when the Lord always helped those Jews, anyway, and when Joshua could knock down big walls just by having his people yell and blow trumpets? And if devils cause a lot of the diseases, and they had to cast 'em out, why is it that good Baptist doctors today don't go on diagnosing devil-possession instead of T. B. and things like that? Do people have devils?\"\n\n\"Young man, I will give you an infallible rule. Never question the ways of the Lord!\"\n\n\"But why don't the doctors talk about having devils now?\"\n\n\"I have no time for vain arguments that lead nowhere! If you would think a little less of your wonderful powers of reasoning, if you'd go humbly to God in prayer and give him a chance, you'd understand the true spiritual significances of all these things.\"\n\n\"But how about where Cain got his wife--\"\n\nMost respectfully Jim said it, but Dr. Quarles (he had a chin-whisker and a boiled shirt) turned from him and snapped, \"I have no further time to give you, young man! I've told you what to do. Good morning!\"\n\nThat evening Mrs. Quarles breathed, \"Oh, Willoughby, did you 'tend to that awful senior--that Lefferts--that's trying to spread doubt? Did you fire him?\"\n\n\"No,\" blossomed President Quarles. \"Certainly not. There was no need. I showed him how to look for spiritual guidance and--Did that freshman come and mow the lawn? The idea of him wanting fifteen cents an hour!\"\n\nJim was hair-hung and breeze-shaken over the abyss of hell, and apparently enjoying it very much indeed, while his wickedness fascinated Elmer Gantry and terrified him.\n\n5\n\nThat November day of 1902, November of their Senior year, was greasy of sky, and slush blotted the wooden sidewalks of Gritzmacher Springs. There was nothing to do in town, and their room was dizzying with the stench of the stove, first lighted now since spring.\n\nJim was studying German, tilted back in an elegant position of ease, with his legs cocked up on the desk tablet of the escritoire. Elmer lay across the bed, ascertaining whether the blood would run to his head if he lowered it over the side. It did, always.\n\n\"Oh, God, let's get out and do something!\" he groaned.\n\n\"Nothing to do, Useless,\" said Jim.\n\n\"Let's go over to Cato and see the girls and get drunk.\"\n\nAs Kansas was dry, by state prohibition, the nearest haven was at Cato, Missouri, seventeen miles away.\n\nJim scratched his head with a corner of his book and approved:\n\n\"Well, that's a worthy idea. Got any money?\"\n\n\"On the twenty-eighth? Where the hell would I get any money before the first?\"\n\n\"Hell-cat, you've got one of the deepest intellects I know. You'll be a knock-out at the law. Aside from neither of us having any money, and me with a Dutch quiz tomorrow, it's a great project.\"\n\n\"Oh, well--\" sighed ponderous Elmer, feebly as a sick kitten, and lay revolving the tremendous inquiry.\n\nIt was Jim who saved them from the lard-like weariness into which they were slipping. He had gone back to his book, but he placed it, precisely and evenly, on the desk, and rose.\n\n\"I would like to see Nellie,\" he sighed. \"Oh, man, I could give her a good time! Little Devil! Damn these co-eds here. The few that'll let you love 'em up, they hang around trying to catch you on the campus and make you propose to 'em.\"\n\n\"Oh, gee! And I got to see Juanita,\" groaned Elmer. \"Hey, cut out talking about 'em will you! I've got a palpitating heart right now, just thinking about Juanny!\"\n\n\"Hell-cat! I've got it. Go and borrow ten off this new instructor in chemistry and physics. I've got a dollar sixty-four left, and that'll make it.\"\n\n\"But I don't know him.\"\n\n\"Sure, you poor fish. That's why I suggested him! Do the check-failed-to-come. I'll get another hour of this Dutch while you're stealing the ten from him--\"\n\n\"Now,\" lugubriously, \"you oughtn't to talk like that!\"\n\n\"If you're as good a thief as I think you are, we'll catch the five-sixteen to Cato.\"\n\nThey were on the five-sixteen for Cato.\n\nThe train consisted of a day coach, a combined smoker and baggage car, and a rusty old engine and tender. The train swayed so on the rough tracks as it bumped through the dropping light that Elmer and Jim were thrown against each other and gripped the arm of their seat. The car staggered like a freighter in a gale. And tall raw farmers, perpetually shuffling forward for a drink at the water-cooler, stumbled against them or seized Jim's shoulder to steady themselves.\n\nTo every surface of the old smoking-car, to streaked windows and rusty ironwork and mud-smeared cocoanut matting, clung a sickening bitterness of cheap tobacco fumes, and whenever they touched the red plush of the seat, dust whisked up and the prints of their hands remained on the plush. The car was jammed. Passengers came to sit on the arm of their seat to shout at friends across the aisle.\n\nBut Elmer and Jim were unconscious of filth and smell and crowding. They sat silent, nervously intent, panting a little, their lips open, their eyes veiled, as they thought of Juanita and Nellie.\n\nThe two girls, Juanita Klauzel and Nellie Benton, were by no means professional daughters of joy. Juanita was cashier of the Cato Lunch--Quick Eats; Nellie was assistant to a dressmaker. They were good girls but excitable, and they found a little extra money useful for red slippers and nut-center chocolates.\n\n\"Juanita--what a lil darling--she understands a fellow's troubles,\" said Elmer, as they balanced down the slushy steps at the grimy stone station of Cato.\n\nWhen Elmer, as a Freshman just arrived from the pool-halls and frame high school of Paris, Kansas, had begun to learn the decorum of amour, he had been a boisterous lout who looked shamefaced in the presence of gay ladies, who blundered against tables, who shouted and desired to let the world know how valiantly vicious he was being. He was still rather noisy and proud of wickedness when he was in a state of liquor, but in three and a quarter years of college he had learned how to approach girls. He was confident, he was easy, he was almost quiet; he could look them in the eye with fondness and amusement.\n\nJuanita and Nellie lived with Nellie's widow aunt--she was a moral lady, but she knew how to keep out of the way--in three rooms over a corner grocery. They had just returned from work when Elmer and Jim stamped up the rickety outside wooden steps. Juanita was lounging on a divan which even a noble Oriental red and yellow cover (displaying a bearded Wazir, three dancing ladies in chiffon trousers, a narghile, and a mosque slightly larger than the narghile) could never cause to look like anything except a disguised bed. She was curled up, pinching her ankle with one tired and nervous hand, and reading a stimulating chapter of Laura Jean Libbey. Her shirt-waist was open at the throat, and down her slim stocking was a grievous run. She was so un-Juanita-like--an ash-blonde, pale and lovely, with an ill-restrained passion in her blue eyes.\n\nNellie, a buxom jolly child, dark as a Jewess, was wearing a frowsy dressing-gown. She was making coffee and narrating her grievances against her employer, the pious dressmaker, while Juanita paid no attention whatever. The young men crept into the room without knocking. \"You devils--sneaking in like this, and us not dressed!\" yelped Nellie.\n\nJim sidled up to her, dragged her plump hand away from the handle of the granite-ware coffee-pot, and giggled, \"But aren't you glad to see us?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I am or not! Now you quit! You behave, will you?\"\n\nRarely did Elmer seem more deft than Jim Lefferts. But now he was feeling his command over women--certain sorts of women. Silent, yearning at Juanita, commanding her with hot eyes, he sank on the temporarily Oriental couch, touched her pale hand with his broad finger-tips, and murmured, \"Why you poor kid, you look so tired!\"\n\n\"I am and--You hadn't ought to come here this afternoon. Nell's aunt threw a conniption fit the last time you were here.\"\n\n\"Hurray for aunty! But you're glad to see me?\"\n\nShe would not answer.\n\n\"Aren't you?\"\n\nBold eyes on hers that turned uneasily away, looked back, and sought the safety of the blank wall.\n\n\"Aren't you?\"\n\nShe would not answer.\n\n\"Juanita! And I've longed for you something fierce, ever since I saw you!\" His fingers touched her throat, but softly. \"Aren't you a little glad?\"\n\nAs she turned her head, for a second she looked at him with embarrassed confession. She sharply whispered, \"No--don't!\" as he caught her hand, but she moved nearer to him, leaned against his shoulder.\n\n\"You're so big and strong,\" she sighed.\n\n\"But, golly, you don't know how I need you! The president, old Quarles--quarrels is right, by golly, ha, ha, ha!--'member I was telling you about him?--he's laying for me because he thinks it was me and Jim that let the bats loose in chapel. And I get so sick of that gosh-awful Weekly Bible Study--all about these holy old gazebos. And then I think about you, and gosh, if you were just sitting on the other side of the stove from me in my room there, with your cute lil red slippers cocked up on the nickel rail--gee, how happy I'd be! You don't think I'm just a bonehead, do you?\"\n\nJim and Nellie were at the stage now of nudging each other and bawling, \"Hey, quit, will yuh!\" as they stood over the coffee.\n\n\"Say, you girls change your shirts and come on out and we'll blow you to dinner, and maybe we'll dance a little,\" proclaimed Jim.\n\n\"We can't,\" said Nellie. \"Aunty's sore as a pup because we was up late at a dance night before last. We got to stay home, and you boys got to beat it before she comes in.\"\n\n\"Aw, come on!\"\n\n\"No, we can't!\"\n\n\"Yuh, fat chance you girls staying home and knitting! You got some fellows coming in and you want to get rid of us, that's what's the trouble.\"\n\n\"It is not, Mr. James Lefferts, and it wouldn't be any of your business if it was!\"\n\nWhile Jim and Nellie squabbled, Elmer slipped his hand about Juanita's shoulder, slowly pressed her against him. He believed with terrible conviction that she was beautiful, that she was glorious, that she was life. There was heaven in the softness of her curving shoulder, and her pale flesh was living silk.\n\n\"Come on in the other room,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"Oh--no--not now.\"\n\nHe gripped her arm.\n\n\"Well--don't come in for a minute,\" she fluttered. Aloud, to the others, \"I'm going to do my hair. Looks just ter-ble!\"\n\nShe slipped into the room beyond. A certain mature self-reliance dropped from Elmer's face, and he was like a round-faced big baby, somewhat frightened. With efforts to appear careless, he fumbled about the room and dusted a pink and gilt vase with his large crumpled handkerchief. He was near the inner door.\n\nHe peeped at Jim and Nellie. They were holding hands, while the coffee-pot was cheerfully boiling over. Elmer's heart thumped. He slipped through the door and closed it, whimpering, as in terror:\n\n\"Oh--Juanita--\"\n\n6\n\nThey were gone, Elmer and Jim, before the return of Nellie's aunt. As they were not entertaining the girls, they dined on pork chops, coffee, and apple pie at the Maginnis Lunch.\n\nIt has already been narrated that afterward, in the Old Home Sample Room, Elmer became philosophical and misogynistic as he reflected that Juanita was unworthy of his generous attention; it has been admitted that he became drunk and pugnacious.\n\nAs he wavered through the sidewalk slush, on Jim's arm, as his head cleared, his rage increased against the bully who was about to be encouraged to insult his goo' frien' and roommate. His shoulders straightened, his fists clenched, and he began to look for the scoundrel among the evening crowd of mechanics and coal-miners.\n\nThey came to the chief corner of the town. A little way down the street, beside the red brick wall of the Congress Hotel, some one was talking from the elevation of a box, surrounded by a jeering gang.\n\n\"What they picking on that fella that's talking for? They better let him alone!\" rejoiced Elmer, throwing off Jim's restraining hand, dashing down the side street and into the crowd. He was in that most blissful condition to which a powerful young man can attain--unrighteous violence in a righteous cause. He pushed through the audience, jabbed his elbow into the belly of a small weak man, and guffawed at the cluck of distress. Then he came to a halt, unhappy and doubting.\n\nThe heckled speaker was his chief detestation, Eddie Fislinger, president of the Terwillinger College Y.M.C.A., that rusty-haired gopher who had obscenely opposed his election as president.\n\nWith two other seniors who were also in training for the Baptist ministry, Eddie had come over to Cato to save a few souls. At least, if they saved no souls (and they never had saved any, in seventeen street meetings) they would have handy training for their future jobs.\n\nEddie was a rasping and insistent speaker who got results by hanging to a subject and worrying it, but he had no great boldness, and now he was obviously afraid of his chief heckler, a large, blond, pompadoured young baker, who bulked in front of Eddie's rostrum and asked questions. While Elmer stood listening, the baker demanded:\n\n\"What makes you think you know all about religion?\"\n\n\"I don't pretend to know all about religion, my friend, but I do know what a powerful influence it is for clean and noble living, and if you'll only be fair now, my friend, and give me a chance to tell these other gentlemen what my experience of answers to prayer has been--\"\n\n\"Yuh, swell lot of experience you've had, by your looks!\"\n\n\"See here, there are others who may want to hear--\"\n\nThough Elmer detested Eddie's sappiness, though he might have liked to share drinks with the lively young baker-heckler, there was no really good unctuous violence to be had except by turning champion of religion. The packed crowd excited him, and the pressure of rough bodies, the smell of wet overcoats, the rumble of mob voices. It was like a football line-up.\n\n\"Here, you!\" he roared at the baker. \"Let the fellow speak! Give him a chance. Whyn't you pick on somebody your own size, you big stiff!\"\n\nAt his elbow, Jim Lefferts begged, \"Let's get out of this, Hell-cat. Good Lord! You ain't going to help a gospel-peddler!\"\n\nElmer pushed him away and thrust his chest out toward the baker, who was cackling, \"Heh! I suppose you're a Christer, too!\"\n\n\"I would be, if I was worthy!\" Elmer fully believed it, for that delightful moment. \"These boys are classmates of mine, and they're going to have a chance to speak!\"\n\nEddie Fislinger bleated to his mates, \"Oh, fellows, Elm Gantry! Saved!\"\n\nEven this alarming interpretation of his motives could not keep Elmer now from the holy zeal of fighting. He thrust aside the one aged man who stood between him and the baker--bashing in the aged one's derby and making him telescope like a turtle's neck--and stood with his fist working like a connecting-rod by his side.\n\n\"If you're looking for trouble--\" the baker suggested, clumsily wobbling his huge bleached fists.\n\n\"Not me,\" observed Elmer and struck, once, very judiciously, just at the point of the jaw.\n\nThe baker shook like a skyscraper in an earthquake and caved to the earth.\n\nOne of the baker's pals roared, \"Come on, we'll kill them guys and--\"\n\nElmer caught him on the left ear. It was a very cold ear, and the pal staggered, extremely sick. Elmer looked pleased. But he did not feel pleased. He was almost sober, and he realized that half a dozen rejoicing young workmen were about to rush him. Though he had an excellent opinion of himself, he had seen too much football, as played by denominational colleges with the Christian accompaniments of kneeing and gouging, to imagine that he could beat half a dozen workmen at once.\n\nIt is doubtful whether he would ever have been led to further association with the Lord and Eddie Fislinger had not Providence intervened in its characteristically mysterious way. The foremost of the attackers was just reaching for Elmer when the mob shouted, \"Look out! The cops!\"\n\nThe police force of Cato, all three of them, were wedging into the crowd. They were lanky, mustached men with cold eyes.\n\n\"What's all this row about?\" demanded the chief.\n\nHe was looking at Elmer, who was three inches taller than any one else in the assembly.\n\n\"Some of these fellows tried to stop a peaceable religious assembly--why, they tried to rough-house the Reverend here--and I was protecting him,\" Elmer said.\n\n\"That's right, Chief. Reg'lar outrage,\" complained Jim.\n\n\"That's true, Chief,\" whistled Eddie Fislinger from his box.\n\n\"Well, you fellows cut it out now. What the hell! Ought to be ashamed yourselves, bullyragging a Reverend! Go ahead, Reverend!\"\n\nThe baker had come to, and had been lifted to his feet. His expression indicated that he had been wronged and that he wanted to do something about it, if he could only find out what had happened. His eyes were wild, his hair was a muddy chaos, and his flat floury cheek was cut. He was too dizzy to realize that the chief of police was before him, and his fumbling mind stuck to the belief that he was destroying all religion.\n\n\"Yah, so you're one of them wishy-washy preachers, too!\" he screamed at Elmer--just as one of the lanky policemen reached out an arm of incredible length and nipped him.\n\nThe attention of the crowd warmed Elmer, and he expanded in it, rubbed his mental hands in its blaze.\n\n\"Maybe I ain't a preacher! Maybe I'm not even a good Christian!\" he cried. \"Maybe I've done a whole lot of things I hadn't ought to of done. But let me tell you, I respect religion--\"\n\n\"Oh, amen, praise the Lord, brother,\" from Eddie Fislinger.\n\n\"--and I don't propose to let anybody interfere with it. What else have we got except religion to give us hope--\"\n\n\"Praise the Lord, oh, bless his name!\"\n\n\"--of ever leading decent lives, tell me that, will you, just tell me that!\"\n\nElmer was addressing the chief of police, who admitted:\n\n\"Yuh, I guess that's right. Well now, we'll let the meeting go on, and if any more of you fellows interrupt--\" This completed the chief's present ideas on religion and mob-violence. He looked sternly at everybody within reach, and stalked through the crowd, to return to the police station and resume his game of seven-up.\n\nEddie was soaring into enchanted eloquence:\n\n\"Oh, my brethren, now you see the power of the spirit of Christ to stir up all that is noblest and best in us! You have heard the testimony of our brother here, Brother Gantry, to the one and only way to righteousness! When you get home I want each and every one of you to dig out the Old Book and turn to the Song of Solomon, where it tells about the love of the Savior for the Church--turn to the Song of Solomon, the fourth chapter and the tenth verse, where it says--where Christ is talking about the church, and he says--Song of Solomon, the fourth chapter, and the tenth verse--'How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine!'\n\n\"Oh, the unspeakable joy of finding the joys of salvation! You have heard our brother's testimony. We know of him as a man of power, as a brother to all them that are oppressed, and now that he has had his eyes opened and his ears unstopped, and he sees the need of confession and of humble surrender before the throne--Oh, this is a historic moment in the life of Hell-c--of Elmer Gantry! Oh, Brother, be not afraid! Come! Step up here beside me, and give testimony--\"\n\n\"God! We better get outa here quick!\" panted Jim.\n\n\"Gee, yes!\" Elmer groaned and they edged back through the crowd, while Eddie Fislinger's piping pursued them like icy and penetrating rain:\n\n\"Don't be afraid to acknowledge the leading of Jesus! Are you boys going to show yourselves too cowardly to risk the sneers of the ungodly?\"\n\nThey were safely out of the crowd, walking with severe countenances and great rapidity back to the Old Home Sample Room.\n\n\"That was a dirty trick of Eddie's!\" said Jim. \"God, it certainly was! Trying to convert me! Right before those muckers! If I ever hear another yip out of Eddie, I'll knock his block off! Nerve of him, trying to lead me up to any mourners' bench! Fat chance! I'll fix him! Come on, show a little speed!\" asserted the brother to all them that were oppressed.\n\nBy the time for their late evening train, the sound conversation of the bartender and the sound qualities of his Bourbon had caused Elmer and Jim to forget Eddie Fislinger and the horrors of undressing religion in public. They were the more shocked, then, swaying in their seat in the smoker, to see Eddie standing by them, Bible in hand, backed by his two beaming partners in evangelism.\n\nEddie bared his teeth, smiled all over his watery eyes, and caroled:\n\n\"Oh, fellows, you don't know how wonderful you were tonight! But, oh, boys, now you've taken the first step, why do you put it off--why do you hesitate--why do you keep the Savior suffering as he waits for you, longs for you? He needs you boys, with your splendid powers and intellects that we admire so--\"\n\n\"This air,\" observed Jim Lefferts, \"is getting too thick for me. I seem to smell a peculiar and a fishlike smell.\" He slipped out of the seat and marched toward the forward car.\n\nElmer sought to follow him, but Eddie had flopped into Jim's place and was blithely squeaking on, while the other two hung over them with tender Y.M.C.A. smiles very discomforting to Elmer's queasy stomach as the train bumped on.\n\nFor all his brave words, Elmer had none of Jim's resolute contempt for the church. He was afraid of it. It connoted his boyhood . . . His mother, drained by early widowhood and drudgery, finding her only emotion in hymns and the Bible, and weeping when he failed to study his Sunday School lesson. The church, full thirty dizzy feet up to its curiously carven rafters, and the preachers, so overwhelming in their wallowing voices, so terrifying in their pictures of little boys who stole watermelons or indulged in biological experiments behind barns. The awe-oppressed moment of his second conversion, at the age of eleven, when, weeping with embarrassment and the prospect of losing so much fun, surrounded by solemn and whiskered adult faces, he had signed a pledge binding him to give up, forever, the joys of profanity, alcohol, cards, dancing, and the theater.\n\nThese clouds hung behind and over him, for all his boldness.\n\nEddie Fislinger, the human being, he despised. He considered him a grasshopper, and with satisfaction considered stepping on him. But Eddie Fislinger, the gospeler, fortified with just such a pebble-leather Bible (bookmarks of fringed silk and celluloid smirking from the pages) as his Sunday School teachers had wielded when they assured him that God was always creeping about to catch small boys in their secret thoughts--this armored Eddie was an official, and Elmer listened to him uneasily, never quite certain that he might not yet find himself a dreadful person leading a pure a boresome life in a clean frock coat.\n\n\"--and remember,\" Eddie was wailing, \"how terribly dangerous it is to put off the hour of salvation! 'Watch therefore for you know not what hour your Lord doth come,' it says. Suppose this train were wrecked! Tonight!\"\n\nThe train ungraciously took that second to lurch on a curve.\n\n\"You see? Where would you spend Eternity, Hell-cat? Do you think that any sportin' round is fun enough to burn in hell for?\"\n\n\"Oh, cut it out. I know all that stuff. There's a lot of arguments--You wait'll I get Jim to tell you what Bob Ingersoll said about hell!\"\n\n\"Yes! Sure! And you remember that on his deathbed Ingersoll called his son to him and repented and begged his son to hurry and be saved and burn all his wicked writings!\"\n\n\"Well--Thunder--I don't feel like talking religion tonight. Cut it out.\"\n\nBut Eddie did feel like talking religion, very much so. He waved his Bible enthusiastically and found ever so many uncomfortable texts. Elmer listened as little as possible but he was too feeble to make threats.\n\nIt was a golden relief when the train bumped to a stop at Gritzmacher Springs. The station was a greasy wooden box, the platform was thick with slush, under the kerosene lights. But Jim was awaiting him, a refuge from confusing theological questions, and with a furious \"G'night!\" to Eddie he staggered off.\n\n\"Why didn't you make him shut his trap?\" demanded Jim.\n\n\"I did! Whadja take a sneak for? I told him to shut up and he shut up and I snoozed all the way back and--Ow! My head! Don't walk so fast!\"\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n1\n\nFor years the state of sin in which dwelt Elmer Gantry and Jim Lefferts had produced fascinated despair in the Christian hearts of Terwillinger College. No revival but had flung its sulphur-soaked arrows at them--usually in their absence. No prayer at the Y.M.C.A. meetings but had worried over their staggering folly.\n\nElmer had been known to wince when President the Rev. Dr. Willoughby Quarles was especially gifted with messages at morning chapel, but Jim had held him firm in the faith of unfaith.\n\nNow, Eddie Fislinger, like a prairie seraph, sped from room to room of the elect with the astounding news that Elmer had publicly professed religion, and that he had endured thirty-nine minutes of private adjuration on the train. Instantly started a holy plotting against the miserable sacrificial lamb, and all over Gritzmacher Springs, in the studies of ministerial professors, in the rooms of students, in the small prayer-meeting room behind the chapel auditorium, joyous souls conspired with the Lord against Elmer's serene and zealous sinning. Everywhere, through the snowstorm, you could hear murmurs of \"There is more rejoicing over one sinner who repenteth--\"\n\nEven collegians not particularly esteemed for their piety, suspected of playing cards and secret smoking, were stirred to ecstasy--or it may have been snickering. The football center, in unregenerate days a companion of Elmer and Jim but now engaged to marry a large and sanctified Swedish co-ed from Chanute, rose voluntarily in Y.M.C.A. and promised God to help him win Elmer's favor.\n\nThe spirit waxed most fervent in the abode of Eddie Fislinger, who was now recognized as a future prophet, likely, some day, to have under his inspiration one of the larger Baptist churches in Wichita or even Kansas City.\n\nHe organized an all-day and all-night prayer-meeting on Elmer's behalf, and it was attended by the more ardent, even at the risk of receiving cuts and uncivil remarks from instructors. On the bare floor of Eddie's room, over Knute Halvorsted's paint-shop, from three to sixteen young men knelt at a time, and no 1800 revival saw more successful wrestling with the harassed Satan. In fact one man, suspected of Holy Roller sympathies, managed to have the jerks, and while they felt that this was carrying things farther than the Lord and the Baptist association would care to see it, added excitement to praying at three o'clock in the morning, particularly as they were all of them extraordinarily drunk on coffee and eloquence.\n\nBy morning they felt sure that they had persuaded God to attend to Elmer, and though it is true that Elmer himself had slept quite soundly all night, unaware of the prayer-meeting or of divine influences, it was but an example of the patience of the heavenly powers. And immediately after those powers began to move.\n\nTo Elmer's misery and Jim's stilled fury, their sacred room was invaded by hordes of men with uncombed locks on their foreheads, ecstasy in their eyes, and Bibles under their arms. Elmer was safe nowhere. No sooner had he disposed of one disciple, by the use of spirited and blasphemous arguments patiently taught to him by Jim, than another would pop out from behind a tree and fall on him.\n\nAt his boarding-house--Mother Metzger's, over on Beech Street--a Y.M.C.A. dervish crowed as he passed the bread to Elmer, \"Jever study a kernel of wheat? Swonnerful! Think a wonnerful intricate thing like that created itself? Somebody must have created it. Who? God! Anybody that don't recognize God in Nature--and acknowledge him in repentance--is dumm. That's what he is!\"\n\nInstructors who had watched Elmer's entrance to classrooms with nervous fury now smirked on him and with tenderness heard the statement that he wasn't quite prepared to recite. The president himself stopped Elmer on the street and called him My Boy, and shook his hand with an affection which, Elmer anxiously assured himself, he certainly had done nothing to merit.\n\nHe kept assuring Jim that he was in no danger, but Jim was alarmed, and Elmer himself more alarmed with each hour, each new greeting of: \"We need you with us, old boy--the world needs you!\"\n\nJim did well to dread. Elmer had always been in danger of giving up his favorite diversions--not exactly giving them up, perhaps, but of sweating in agony after enjoying them. But for Jim and his remarks about co-eds who prayed in public and drew their hair back rebukingly from egg-like foreheads, one of these sirens of morality might have snared the easy-going pangynistic Elmer by proximity.\n\nA dreadful young woman from Mexico, Missouri, used to coax Jim to \"tell his funny ideas about religion,\" and go off in neighs of pious laughter, while she choked, \"Oh, you're just too cute! You don't mean a word you say. You simply want to show off!\" She had a deceptive sidelong look which actually promised nothing whatever this side of the altar, and she might, but for Jim's struggles, have led Elmer into an engagement.\n\nThe church and Sunday School at Elmer's village, Paris, Kansas, a settlement of nine hundred evangelical Germans and Vermonters, had nurtured in him a fear of religious machinery which he could never lose, which restrained him from such reasonable acts as butchering Eddie Fislinger. That small pasty-white Baptist church had been the center of all his emotions, aside from hell-raising, hunger, sleepiness, and love. And even these emotions were represented in the House of the Lord, in the way of tacks in pew-cushions, Missionary suppers with chicken pie and angel's-food cake, soporific sermons, and the proximity of flexible little girls in thin muslin. But the arts and the sentiments and the sentimentalities--they were for Elmer perpetually associated only with the church.\n\nExcept for circus bands, Fourth of July parades, and the singing of \"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\" and \"Jingle Bells\" in school, all the music which the boy Elmer had ever heard was in church.\n\nThe church provided his only oratory, except for campaign speeches by politicians ardent about Jefferson and the price of binding-twine; it provided all his painting and sculpture, except for the portraits of Lincoln, Longfellow, and Emerson in the school-building, and the two china statuettes of pink ladies with gilt flower-baskets which stood on his mother's bureau. From the church came all his profounder philosophy, except the teachers' admonitions that little boys who let gartersnakes loose in school were certain to be licked now and hanged later, and his mother's stream of opinions on hanging up his overcoat, wiping his feet, eating fried potatoes with his fingers, and taking the name of the Lord in vain.\n\nIf he had sources of literary inspiration outside the church--in McGuffey's Reader he encountered the boy who stood on the burning deck, and he had a very pretty knowledge of the Nick Carter Series and the exploits of Cole Younger and the James Boys--yet here too the church had guided him. In Bible stories, in the words of the great hymns, in the anecdotes which the various preachers quoted, he had his only knowledge of literature--\n\nThe story of Little Lame Tom who shamed the wicked rich man that owned the handsome team of grays and the pot hat and led him to Jesus. The ship's captain who in the storm took counsel with the orphaned but righteous child of missionaries in Zomballa. The Faithful Dog who saved his master during a terrific conflagration (only sometimes it was a snowstorm, or an attack by Indians) and roused him to give up horse-racing, rum, and playing the harmonica.\n\nHow familiar they were, how thrilling, how explanatory to Elmer of the purposes of life, how preparatory for his future usefulness and charm.\n\nThe church, the Sunday School, the evangelistic orgy, choir-practise, raising the mortgage, the delights of funerals, the snickers in back pews or in the other room at weddings--they were as natural, as inescapable a mold of manners to Elmer as Catholic processionals to a street gamin in Naples.\n\nThe Baptist Church of Paris, Kansas! A thousand blurred but indestructible pictures.\n\nHymns! Elmer's voice was made for hymns. He rolled them out like a negro. The organ-thunder of \"Nicæa\":\n\nHoly, holy, holy! all the saints adore thee,\n\nCasting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea.\n\nThe splendid rumble of the Doxology. \"Throw Out the Lifeline,\" with its picture of a wreck pounded in the darkness by surf which the prairie child imagined as a hundred feet high. \"Onward, Christian Soldiers,\" to which you could without rebuke stamp your feet.\n\nSunday School picnics! Lemonade and four-legged races and the ride on the hay-rack singing \"Seeing Nelly Home.\"\n\nSunday School text cards! True, they were chiefly a medium of gambling, but as Elmer usually won the game (he was the first boy in Paris to own a genuine pair of loaded dice) he had plenty of them in his gallery, and they gave him a taste for gaudy robes, for marble columns and the purple-broidered palaces of kings, which was later to be of value in quickly habituating himself to the more decorative homes of vice. The three kings bearing caskets of ruby and sardonyx. King Zedekiah in gold and scarlet, kneeling on a carpet of sapphire-blue, while his men-at-arms came fleeing and blood-stained, red blood on glancing steel, with tidings of the bannered host of Nebuchadnezzar, great king of Babylon. And all his life Elmer remembered, in moments of ardor, during oratorios in huge churches, during sunset at sea, a black-bearded David standing against raw red cliffs--a figure heroic and summoning to ambition, to power, to domination.\n\nSunday School Christmas Eve! The exhilaration of staying up, and publicly, till nine-thirty. The tree, incredibly tall, also incredibly inflammable, flashing with silver cords, with silver stars, with cotton-batting snow. The two round stoves red-hot. Lights and lights and lights. Pails of candy, and for every child in the school a present--usually a book, very pleasant, with colored pictures of lambs and volcanoes. The Santa Claus--he couldn't possibly be Lorenzo Nickerson, the house-painter, so bearded was he, and red-cheeked, and so witty in his comment on each child as it marched up for its present. The enchantment, sheer magic, of the Ladies' Quartette singing of shepherds who watched their flocks by nights . . . brown secret hilltops under one vast star.\n\nAnd the devastating morning when the preacher himself, the Rev. Wilson Hinckley Skaggs, caught Elmer matching for Sunday School contribution pennies on the front steps, and led him up the aisle for all to giggle at, with a sharp and not very clean ministerial thumb-nail gouging his ear-lobe.\n\nAnd the other passing preachers; Brother Organdy, who got you to saw his wood free; Brother Blunt, who sneaked behind barns to catch you on Halloween; Brother Ingle, who was zealous but young and actually human, and who made whistles from willow branches for you.\n\nAnd the morning when Elmer concealed an alarm clock behind the organ and it went off, magnificently, just as the superintendent (Dr. Prouty, the dentist) was whimpering, \"Now let us all be particularly quiet as Sister Holbrick leads us in prayer.\"\n\nAnd always the three chairs that stood behind the pulpit, the intimidating stiff chairs of yellow plush and carved oak borders, which, he was uneasily sure, were waiting for the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.\n\nHe had, in fact, got everything from the church and Sunday School, except, perhaps, any longing whatever for decency and kindness and reason.\n\n2\n\nEven had Elmer not known the church by habit, he would have been led to it by his mother. Aside from his friendship for Jim Lefferts, Elmer's only authentic affection was for his mother, and she was owned by the church.\n\nShe was a small woman, energetic, nagging but kindly, once given to passionate caresses and now to passionate prayer, and she had unusual courage. Early left a widow by Logan Gantry, dealer in feed, flour, lumber, and agricultural implements, a large and agreeable man given to debts and whisky, she had supported herself and Elmer by sewing, trimming hats, baking bread, and selling milk. She had her own millinery and dressmaking shop now, narrow and dim but proudly set right on Main Street, and she was able to give Elmer the three hundred dollars a year which, with his summer earnings in harvest field and lumber-yard, was enough to support him--in Terwillinger, in 1902.\n\nShe had always wanted Elmer to be a preacher. She was jolly enough, and no fool about pennies in making change, but for a preacher standing up on a platform in a long-tailed coat she had gaping awe.\n\nElmer had since the age of sixteen been a member in good standing of the Baptist Church--he had been most satisfactorily immersed in the Kayooska River. Large though Elmer was, the evangelist had been a powerful man and had not only ducked him but, in sacred enthusiasm, held him under, so that he came up sputtering, in a state of grace and muddiness. He had also been saved several times, and once, when he had pneumonia, he had been esteemed by the pastor and all visiting ladies as rapidly growing in grace.\n\nBut he had resisted his mother's desire that he become a preacher. He would have to give up his entertaining vices, and with wide-eyed and panting happiness he was discovering more of them every year. Equally he felt lumbering and shamed whenever he tried to stand up before his tittering gang in Paris and appear pious.\n\nIt was hard even in college days to withstand his mother. Though she came only to his shoulder, such was her bustling vigor, her swift shrewdness of tongue, such the gallantry of her long care for him, that he was afraid of her as he was afraid of Jim Leffert's scorn. He never dared honestly to confess his infidelity, but he grumbled, \"Oh, gee, Ma, I don't know. Trouble is, fellow don't make much money preaching. Gee, there's no hurry. Don't have to decide yet.\"\n\nAnd she knew now that he was likely to become a lawyer. Well, that wasn't so bad, she felt; some day he might go to Congress and reform the whole nation into a pleasing likeness of Kansas. But if he could only have become part of the mysteries that hovered about the communion table--\n\nShe had talked him over with Eddie Fislinger. Eddie came from a town twelve miles from Paris. Though it might be years before he was finally ordained as a minister, Eddie had by his home congregation been given a License to Preach as early as his Sophomore year in Terwillinger, and for a month, one summer (while Elmer was out in the harvest fields or the swimming hole or robbing orchards), Eddie had earnestly supplied the Baptist pulpit in Paris.\n\nMrs. Gantry consulted him, and Eddie instructed her with the divinity of nineteen.\n\nOh, yes, Brother Elmer was a fine young man--so strong--they all admired him--a little too much tempted by the vain gauds of This World, but that was because he was young. Oh, yes, some day Elmer would settle down and be a fine Christian husband and father and business man. But as to the ministry--no. Mrs. Gantry must not too greatly meddle with these mysteries. It was up to God. A fellow had to have a Call before he felt his vocation for the ministry; a real overwhelming mysterious knock-down Call, such as Eddie himself had ecstatically experienced, one evening in a cabbage patch. No, not think of that. Their task now was to get Elmer into a real state of grace and that, Eddie assured her, looked to him like a good deal of a job.\n\nUndoubtedly, Eddie explained, when Elmer had been baptized, at sixteen, he had felt conviction, he had felt the invitation, and the burden of his sins had been lifted. But he had not, Eddie doubted, entirely experienced salvation. He was not really in a state of grace. He might almost be called unconverted.\n\nEddie diagnosed the case completely, with all the proper pathological terms. Whatever difficulties he may have had with philosophy, Latin, and calculus, there had never been a time since the age of twelve when Eddie Fislinger had had difficulty in understanding what the Lord God Almighty wanted, and why, all through history, he had acted thus or thus.\n\n\"I should be the last to condemn athaletics,\" said Eddie. \"We must have strong bodies to endure the burden and the sweat of carrying the Gospel to the world. But at the same time, it seems to me that football tends to detract from religion. I'm a little afraid that just at present Elmer is not in a state of grace. But, oh, Sister, don't let us worry and travail! Let us trust the Lord. I'll go to Elmer myself, and see what I can do.\"\n\nThat must have been the time--it certainly was during that vacation between their Sophomore and Junior years--when Eddie walked out to the farm where Elmer was working, and looked at Elmer, bulky and hayseedy in a sleeveless undershirt, and spoke reasonably of the weather, and walked back again. . . .\n\nWhenever Elmer was at home, though he tried affectionately to live out his mother's plan of life for him, though without very much grumbling he went to bed at nine-thirty, whitewashed the hen-house, and accompanied her to church, yet Mrs. Gantry suspected that sometimes he drank beer and doubted about Jonah, and uneasily Elmer heard her sobbing as she knelt by her high-swelling, white-counterpaned, old-fashioned bed.\n\n3\n\nWith alarmed evangelistic zeal, Jim Lefferts struggled to keep Elmer true to the faith, after his exposure to religion in defending Eddie at Cato.\n\nHe was, on the whole, rather more zealous and fatiguing than Eddie.\n\nNights, when Elmer longed to go to sleep, Jim argued; mornings, when Elmer should have been preparing his history, Jim read aloud from Ingersoll and Thomas Paine.\n\n\"How you going to explain a thing like this--how you going to explain it?\" begged Jim. \"It says here in Deuteronomy that God chased these Yids around in the desert for forty years and their shoes didn't even wear out. That's what it says, right in the Bible. You believe a thing like that? And do you believe that Samson lost all his strength just because his gal cut off his hair? Do you, eh? Think hair had anything to do with his strength?\"\n\nJim raced up and down the stuffy room, kicking at chairs, his normally bland eyes feverish, his forefinger shaken in wrath, while Elmer sat humped on the edge of the bed, his forehead in his hands, rather enjoying having his soul fought for.\n\nTo prove that he was still a sound and freethinking stalwart, Elmer went out with Jim one evening and at considerable effort, they carried off a small outhouse and placed it on the steps of the Administration Building.\n\nElmer almost forgot to worry after the affair of Eddie and Dr. Lefferts.\n\nJim's father was a medical practitioner in an adjoining village. He was a plump, bearded, bookish, merry man, very proud of his atheism. It was he who had trained Jim in the faith and in his choice of liquor; he had sent Jim to this denominational college partly because it was cheap and partly because it tickled his humor to watch his son stir up the fretful complacency of the saints. He dropped in and found Elmer and Jim agitatedly awaiting the arrival of Eddie.\n\n\"Eddie said,\" wailed Elmer, \"he said he was coming up to see me, and he'll haul out some more of these proofs that I'm going straight to hell. Gosh, Doctor, I don't know what's got into me. You better examine me. I must have anemics or something. Why, one time, if Eddie Fislinger had smiled at me, damn him, think of him daring to smile at me!--if he'd said he was coming to my room, I'd of told him, 'Like hell you will!' and I'd of kicked him in the shins.\"\n\nDr. Lefferts purred in his beard. His eyes were bright.\n\n\"I'll give your friend Fislinger a run for his money. And for the inconsequential sake of the non-existent Heaven, Jim, try not to look surprised when you find your respectable father being pious.\"\n\nWhen Eddie arrived, he was introduced to a silkily cordial Dr. Lefferts, who shook his hand with that lengthiness and painfulness common to politicians, salesmen, and the godly. The doctor rejoiced:\n\n\"Brother Fislinger, my boy here and Elmer tell me that you've been trying to help them see the true Bible religion.\"\n\n\"I've been seeking to.\"\n\n\"It warms my soul to hear you say that, Brother Fislinger! You can't know what a grief it is to an old man tottering to the grave, to one whose only solace now is prayer and Bible-reading\"--Dr. Lefferts had sat up till four a.m., three nights ago, playing poker and discussing biology with his cronies, the probate judge and the English stock-breeder--\"what a grief it is to him that his only son, James Blaine Lefferts, is not a believer. But perhaps you can do more than I can, Brother Fislinger. They think I'm a fanatical old fogy. Now let me see--You're a real Bible believer?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Eddie looked triumphantly at Jim, who was leaning against the table, his hands in his pockets, as expressionless as wood. Elmer was curiously hunched up in the Morris chair, his hands over his mouth. The doctor said approvingly:\n\n\"That's splendid. You believe every word of it, I hope, from cover to cover?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. What I always say is, 'It's better to have the whole Bible than a Bible full of holes.'\"\n\n\"Why, that's a real thought, Brother Fislinger. I must remember that, to tell any of these alleged higher critics, if I ever meet any! 'Bible whole--not Bible full of holes.\" Oh, that's a fine thought, and cleverly expressed. You made it up?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly.\"\n\n\"I see, I see. Well, that's splendid. Now of course you believe in the premillennial coming--I mean the real, authentic, genuwine, immediate, bodily, premillennial coming of Jesus Christ?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sure.\"\n\n\"And the virgin birth?\"\n\n\"Oh, you bet.\"\n\n\"That's splendid! Of course there are doctors who question whether the virgin birth is quite in accordance with their experience of obstetrics, but I tell those fellows, 'Look here! How do I know it's true? Because it says so in the Bible, and if it weren't true, do you suppose it would say so in the Bible?' That certainly shuts them up! They have precious little to say after that!\"\n\nBy this time a really beautiful, bounteous fellowship was flowing between Eddie and the doctor, and they were looking with pity on the embarrassed faces of the two heretics left out in the cold. Dr. Lefferts tickled his beard and crooned:\n\n\"And of course, Brother Fislinger, you believe in infant damnation.\"\n\nEddie explained, \"No; that's not a Baptist doctrine.\"\n\n\"You--you--\" The good doctor choked, tugged at his collar, panted and wailed:\n\n\"It's not a Baptist doctrine? You don't believe in infant damnation?\"\n\n\"W-why, no--\"\n\n\"Then God help the Baptist church and the Baptist doctrine! God help us all, in these unregenerate days, that we should be contaminated by such infidelity!\" Eddie sweat, while the doctor patted his plump hands and agonized: \"Look you here, my brother! It's very simple. Are we not saved by being washed in the blood of the Lamb, and by that alone, by his blessed sacrifice alone?\"\n\n\"W-why, yes, but--\"\n\n\"Then either we are washed white, and saved, or else we are not washed, and we are not saved! That's the simple truth, and all weakenings and explanations and hemming and hawing about this clear and beautiful truth are simply of the devil, brother! And at what moment does a human being, in all his inevitable sinfulness, become subject to baptism and salvation? At two months? At nine years? At sixteen? At forty-seven? At ninety-nine? No! The moment he is born! And so if he be not baptized, then he must burn in hell forever. What does it say in the Good Book? 'For there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.' It may seem a little hard of God to fry beautiful little babies, but then think of the beautiful women whom he loves to roast there for the edification of the saints! Oh, brother, brother, now I understand why Jimmy here, and poor Elmer, are lost to the faith! It's because professed Christians like you give them this emasculated religion! Why, it's fellows like you who break down the dike of true belief, and open a channel for higher criticism and sabellianism and nymphomania and agnosticism and heresy and Catholicism and Seventh-day Adventism and all those horrible German inventions! Once you begin to doubt, the wicked work is done! Oh, Jim, Elmer, I told you to listen to our friend here, but now that I find him practically a free-thinker--\"\n\nThe doctor staggered to a chair. Eddie stood gaping.\n\nIt was the first time in his life that any one had accused him of feebleness in the faith, of under-strictness. He was smirkingly accustomed to being denounced as over-strict. He had almost as much satisfaction out of denouncing liquor as other collegians had out of drinking it. He had, partly from his teachers and partly right out of his own brain, any number of good answers to classmates who protested that he was old-fashioned in belaboring domino-playing, open communion, listening to waltz music, wearing a gown in the pulpit, taking a walk on Sunday, reading novels, trans-substantiation, and these new devices of the devil called moving-pictures. He could frighten almost any Laodicean. But to be called shaky himself, to be called heretic and slacker--for that inconceivable attack he had no retort.\n\nHe looked at the agonized doctor, he looked at Jim and Elmer, who were obviously distressed at his fall from spiritual leadership, and he fled to secret prayer.\n\nHe took his grief presently to President Quarles, who explained everything perfectly.\n\n\"But this doctor quoted Scripture to prove his point!\" bleated Eddie.\n\n\"Don't forget, Brother Fislinger, that 'the devil can quote Scripture to his purpose.'\"\n\nEddie thought that was a very nice thought and very nicely expressed, and though he was not altogether sure that it was from the Bible, he put it away for future use in sermons. But before he was sufficiently restored to go after Elmer again, Christmas vacation had arrived.\n\nWhen Eddie had gone, Elmer laughed far more heartily than Jim or his father. It is true that he hadn't quite understood what it was all about. Why, sure; Eddie had said it right; infant damnation wasn't a Baptist doctrine; it belonged to some of the Presbyterians, and everybody knew the Presbyterians had a lot of funny beliefs. But the doctor certainly had done something to squelch Eddie, and Elmer felt safer than for many days.\n\nHe continued to feel safe up till Christmas vacation. Then--\n\nSome one, presumably Eddie, had informed Elmer's mother of his new and promising Christian status. He himself had been careful to keep such compromising rumors out of his weekly letters home. Through all the vacation he was conscious that his mother was hovering closer to him than usual, that she was waiting to snatch at his soul if he showed weakening. Their home pastor, the Reverend Mr. Aker--known in Paris as Reverend Aker--shook hands with him at the church door with approval as incriminating as the affection of his instructors at Terwillinger.\n\nUnsupported by Jim, aware that at any moment Eddie might pop in from his neighboring town and be accepted as an ally by Mrs. Gantry, Elmer spent a vacation in which there was but little peace. To keep his morale up, he gave particularly earnest attention to bottle-pool and to the daughter of a nearby farmer. But he was in dread lest these be the last sad ashen days of his naturalness.\n\nIt seemed menacing that Eddie should be on the same train back to college. Eddie was with another exponent of piety, and he said nothing to Elmer about the delights of hell, but he and his companion secretly giggled with a confidence more than dismaying.\n\nJim Lefferts did not find in Elmer's face the conscious probity and steadfastness which he had expected.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n1\n\nEarly in January was the Annual College Y.M.C.A. Week of Prayer. It was a countrywide event, but in Terwillinger College it was of especial power that year because they were privileged to have with them for three days none other than Judson Roberts, State Secretary of the Y.M.C.A., and a man great personally as well as officially.\n\nHe was young, Mr. Roberts, only thirty-four, but already known throughout the land. He had always been known. He had been a member of a star University of Chicago football team, he had played varsity baseball, he had been captain of the debating team, and at the same time he had commanded the Y.M.C.A. He had been known as the Praying Fullback. He still kept up his exercise--he was said to have boxed privily with Jim Jefferies--and he had mightily increased his praying. A very friendly leader he was, and helpful; hundreds of college men throughout Kansas called him \"Old Jud.\"\n\nBetween prayer-meetings at Terwillinger, Judson Roberts sat in the Bible History seminar-room, at a long table, under a bilious map of the Holy Land, and had private conferences with the men students. A surprising number of them came edging in, trembling, with averted eyes, to ask advice about a secret practice, and Old Jud seemed amazingly able to guess their trouble before they got going.\n\n\"Well, now, old boy, I'll tell you. Terrible thing, all right, but I've met quite a few cases, and you just want to buck up and take it to the Lord in prayer. Remember that he is able to help unto the uttermost. Now the first thing you want to do is to get rid of--I'm afraid that you have some pretty nasty pictures and maybe a juicy book hidden away, now haven't you, old boy?\"\n\nHow could Old Jud have guessed? What a corker!\n\n\"That's right. I've got a swell plan, old boy. Make a study of missions, and think how clean and pure and manly you'd want to be if you were going to carry the joys of Christianity to a lot of poor gazebos that are under the evil spell of Buddhism and a lot of these heathen religions. Wouldn't you want to be able to look 'em in the eye, and shame 'em? Next thing to do is to get a lot of exercise. Get out and run like hell! And then cold baths. Darn' cold. There now!\" Rising, with ever so manly a handshake: \"Now, skip along and remember\"--with a tremendous and fetching and virile laugh--\"just run like hell!\"\n\nJim and Elmer heard Old Jud in chapel. He was tremendous. He told them a jolly joke about a man who kissed a girl, yet he rose to feathered heights when he described the beatitude of real ungrudging prayer, in which a man was big enough to be as a child. He made them tearful over the gentleness with which he described the Christchild, wandering lost by his parents, yet the next moment he had them stretching with admiration as he arched his big shoulder-muscles and observed that he would knock the block off any sneering, sneaking, lying, beer-bloated bully who should dare to come up to him in a meeting and try to throw a monkey-wrench into the machinery by dragging out a lot of contemptible, quibbling, atheistic, smart-aleck doubts! (He really did, the young men glowed, use the terms \"knock the block off,\" and \"throw a monkey-wrench.\" Oh, he was a lulu, a real red-blooded regular fellow!)\n\nJim was coming down with the grippe. He was unable to pump up even one good sneer. He sat folded up, his chin near his knees, and Elmer was allowed to swell with hero-worship. Golly! He'd thought he had some muscle, but that guy Judson Roberts--zowie, he could put Elmer on the mat seven falls out of five! What a football player he must have been! Wee!\n\nThis Homeric worship he tried to explain to Jim, back in their room, but Jim sneezed and went to bed. The rude bard was left without audience and he was practically glad when Eddie Fislinger scratched at the door and edged in.\n\n\"Don't want to bother you fellows, but noticed you were at Old Jud's meeting this afternoon and, say, you gotta come out and hear him again tomorrow evening. Big evening of the week. Say, honest, Hell-cat, don't you think Jud's a real humdinger?\"\n\n\"Yes, I gotta admit, he's a dandy fellow.\"\n\n\"Say, he certainly is, isn't he! He certainly is a dandy fellow, isn't he! Isn't he a peach!\"\n\n\"Yes, he certainly is a peach--for a religious crank!\"\n\n\"Aw now, Hell-cat, don't go calling him names! You'll admit he looks like some football shark.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess he does, at that. I'd liked to of played with him.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to meet him?'\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\nAt this moment of danger, Jim raised his dizzy head to protest, \"He's a holy strikebreaker! One of these thick-necks that was born husky and tries to make you think he made himself husky by prayer and fasting. I'd hate to take a chance on any poor little orphan nip of Bourbon wandering into Old Jud's presence! Yeh! Chest-pounder! 'Why can't you hundred-pound shrimps be a big manly Christian like me!'\"\n\nTogether they protested against this defilement of the hero, and Eddie admitted that he had ventured to praise Elmer to Old Jud; that Old Jud had seemed enthralled; that Old Jud was more than likely--so friendly a Great Man was he--to run in on Elmer this afternoon.\n\nBefore Elmer could decide whether to be pleased or indignant, before the enfeebled Jim could get up strength to decide for him, the door was hit a mighty and heroic wallop, and in strode Judson Roberts, big as a grizzly, jolly as a spaniel pup, radiant as ten suns.\n\nHe set upon Elmer immediately. He had six other doubting Thomases or suspected smokers to dispose of before six o'clock.\n\nHe was a fair young giant with curly hair and a grin and with a voice like the Bulls of Bashan whenever the strategy called for manliness. But with erring sisters, unless they were too erring, he could be as lulling as woodland violets shaken in the perfumed breeze.\n\n\"Hello, Hell-cat!\" he boomed. \"Shake hands!\"\n\nElmer had a playful custom of squeezing people's hands till they cracked. For the first time in his life his own paw felt limp and burning. He rubbed it and looked simple.\n\n\"Been hearing a lot about you, Hell-cat, and you, Jim. Laid out, Jim? Want me to trot out and get a doc?\" Old Jud was sitting easily on the edge of Jim's bed, and in the light of that grin, even Jim Lefferts could not be very sour as he tried to sneer, \"No, thanks.\"\n\nRoberts turned to Elmer again, and gloated:\n\n\"Well, old son, I've been hearing a lot about you. Gee whillikins, that must have been a great game you played against Thorvilsen College! They tell me when you hit that line, it gave like a sponge, and when you tackled that big long Swede, he went down like he'd been hit by lightning.\"\n\n\"Well, it was--it was a good game.\"\n\n\"Course I read about it at the time--\"\n\n\"Did you, honest?\"\n\n\"--and course I wanted to hear more about it, and meet you, Hell-cat, so I been asking the boys about you, and say, they certainly do give you a great hand! Wish I could've had you with me on my team at U of Chi--we needed a tackle like you.\"\n\nElmer basked.\n\n\"Yes, sir, the boys all been telling me what a dandy fine fellow you are, and what a corking athlete, and what an A-1 gentleman. They all say there's just one trouble with you, Elmer lad.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"They say you're a coward.\"\n\n\"Heh? Who says I'm a coward?\"\n\nJudson Roberts swaggered across from the bed, stood with his hand on Elmer's shoulder. \"They all say it, Hell-cat! You see it takes a sure-enough dyed-in-the-wool brave man to be big enough to give Jesus a shot at him, and admit he's licked when he tries to fight God! It takes a man with guts to kneel down and admit his worthlessness when all the world is jeering at him! And you haven't got that kind of courage, Elmer. Oh, you think you're such a big cuss--\"\n\nOld Jud swung him around; Old Jud's hand was crushing his shoulder. \"You think you're too husky, too good, to associate with the poor little sniveling gospel-mongers, don't you! You could knock out any of 'em, couldn't you! Well, I'm one of 'em. Want to knock me out?\"\n\nWith one swift jerk Roberts had his coat off, stood with a striped silk shirt revealing his hogshead torso.\n\n\"You bet, Hell-cat! I'm willing to fight you for the glory of God! God needs you! Can you think of anything finer for a big husky like you than to spend his life bringing poor, weak, sick, scared folks to happiness? Can't you see how the poor little skinny guys and all the kiddies would follow you and praise you and admire you, you old son of a gun? Am I a sneaking Christian? Can you lick me? Want to fight it out?\"\n\n\"No, gee, Mr. Roberts--\"\n\n\"Judson, you big hunk of cheese, Old Jud!\"\n\n\"No, gee, Judson, I guess you got me trimmed! I pack a pretty good wallop, but I'm not going to take any chance on you!\"\n\n\"All right, old son. Still think that all religious folks are crabs?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And weaklings and pikers?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And liars?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"All right, old boy. Going to allow me to be a friend of yours, if I don't butt in on your business?\"\n\n\"Oh, gee, sure.\"\n\n\"Then there's just one favor I want to ask. Will you come to our big meeting tomorrow night? You don't have to do a thing. If you think we're four-flushers--all right; that's your privilege. Only will you come and not decide we're all wrong beforehand, but really use that big fine incisive brain of yours and study us as we are? Will you come?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sure, you bet.\"\n\n\"Fine, old boy. Mighty proud to have you let me come butting in here in this informal way. Remember: if you honestly feel I'm using any undue influence on the boys, you come right after me and say so, and I'll be mighty proud of your trusting me to stand the gaff. So long, old Elm! So long, Jim. God bless you!\"\n\n\"So long, Jud.\"\n\nHe was gone, a whirlwind that whisked the inconspicuous herb Eddie Fislinger out after it. And then Jim Lefferts spoke.\n\nFor a time after Judson Roberts' curtain, Elmer stood glowing, tasting praise. He was conscious of Jim's eyes on his back, and he turned toward the bed, defiantly.\n\nThey stared, in a tug of war. Elmer gave in with a furious:\n\n\"Well, then, why didn't you say something while he was here?\"\n\n\"To him? Talk to a curly wolf when he smells meat? Besides, he's intelligent, that fellow.\"\n\n\"Well, say, I'm glad to hear you say that, because--well, you see--I'll explain how I feel.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you won't, sweetheart! You haven't got to the miracle-pulling stage yet. Sure he's intelligent. I never heard a better exhibition of bunco-steering in my life. Sure! He's just crazy to have you come up and kick him in the ear and tell him you've decided you can't give your imprimatur--\"\n\n\"My what?\"\n\n\"--to his show, and he's to quit and go back to hod-carrying. Sure. He read all about your great game with Thorvilsen. Sent off to New York to get the Review of Reviews and read more about it. Eddie Fislinger never told him a word. He read about your tackling in the London Times. You bet. Didn't he say so? And he's a saved soul--he couldn't lie. And he just couldn't stand it if he didn't become a friend of yours. He can't know more than a couple of thousand collidge boys to spring that stuff on! . . . You bet I believe in the old bearded Jew God! Nobody but him could have made all the idiots there are in the world!\"\n\n\"Gee, Jim, honest, you don't understand Jud.\"\n\n\"No. I don't. When he could be a decent prize-fighter, and not have to go around with angleworms like Eddie Fislinger day after day!\"\n\nAnd thus till midnight, for all Jim's fevers.\n\nBut Elmer was at Judson Roberts' meeting next evening, unprotected by Jim, who remained at home in so vile a temper that Elmer had sent in a doctor and sneaked away from the room for the afternoon.\n\n2\n\nIt was undoubtedly Eddie who wrote or telegraphed to Mrs. Gantry that she would do well to be present at the meeting. Paris was only forty miles from Gritzmacher Springs.\n\nElmer crept into his room at six, still wistfully hoping to have Jim's sanction, still ready to insist that if he went to the meeting he would be in no danger of conversion. He had walked miles through the slush, worrying. He was ready now to give up the meeting, to give up Judson's friendship, if Jim should insist.\n\nAs he wavered in, Mrs. Gantry stood by Jim's lightning-shot bed.\n\n\"Why, Ma! What you doing here? What's gone wrong?\" Elmer panted.\n\nIt was impossible to think of her taking a journey for anything less than a funeral.\n\nCozily, \"Can't I run up and see my two boys if I want to, Elmy? I declare, I believe you'd of killed Jim, with all this nasty tobacco air, if I hadn't come in and aired the place out. I thought, Elmer Gantry, you weren't supposed to smoke in Terwillinger! By the rules of the college! I thought, young man, that you lived up to 'em! But never mind.\"\n\nUneasily--for Jim had never before seen him demoted to childhood, as he always was in his mother's presence--Elmer grumbled, \"But honest, Ma, what did you come up for?\"\n\n\"Well, I read about what a nice week of prayer you were going to have, and I thought I'd just like to hear a real big bug preach. I've got a vacation coming, too! Now don't you worry one mite about me. I guess I can take care of myself after all these years! The first traveling I ever done with you, young man--the time I went to Cousin Adeline's wedding--I just tucked you under one arm--and how you squalled, the whole way!--mercy, you liked to hear the sound of your own voice then just like you do now!--and I tucked my old valise under the other, and off I went! Don't you worry one mite about me. I'm only going to stay over the night--got a sale on remnants starting--going back on Number Seven tomorrow. I left my valise at that boarding-house right across from the depot. But there's one thing you might do if 'tain't too much trouble, Elmy. You know I've only been up here at the college once before. I'd feel kind of funny, country bumpkin like me, going alone to that big meeting, with all those smart professors and everybody there, and I'd be glad if you could come along.\"\n\n\"Of course he'll go, Mrs. Gantry,\" said Jim.\n\nBut before Elmer was carried away, Jim had the chance to whisper, \"God, do be careful! Remember I won't be there to protect you! Don't let 'em pick on you! Don't do one single doggone thing they want you to do, and then maybe you'll be safe!\"\n\nAs he went out, Elmer looked back at Jim. He was shakily sitting up in bed, his eyes imploring.\n\n3\n\nThe climactic meeting of the Annual Prayer Week, to be addressed by President Quarles, four ministers, and a rich trustee who was in the pearl-button business, with Judson Roberts as star soloist, was not held at the Y.M.C.A. but at the largest auditorium in town, the Baptist Church, with hundreds of town-people joining the collegians.\n\nThe church was a welter of brownstone, with Moorish arches and an immense star-shaped window not yet filled with stained glass.\n\nElmer hoped to be late enough to creep in inconspicuously, but as his mother and he straggled up to the Romanesque portico, students were still outside, chattering. He was certain they were whispering, \"There he is--Hell-cat Gantry. Say, is it really true he's under conviction of sin? I thought he cussed out the church more'n anybody in college.\"\n\nMeek though Elmer had been under instruction by Jim and threats by Eddie and yearning by his mother, he was not normally given to humility, and he looked at his critics defiantly. \"I'll show 'em! If they think I'm going to sneak in--\"\n\nHe swaggered down almost to the front pews, to the joy of his mother, who had been afraid that as usual he would hide in the rear, handy to the door if the preacher should become personal.\n\nThere was a great deal of decoration in the church, which had been endowed by a zealous alumnus after making his strike in Alaskan boarding-houses during the gold-rush. There were Egyptian pillars with gilded capitals, on the ceiling were gilt stars and clouds more woolen than woolly, and the walls were painted cheerily in three strata--green, watery blue, and khaki. It was an echoing and gaping church, and presently it was packed, the aisles full. Professors with string mustaches and dog-eared Bibles, men students in sweaters or flannel shirts, earnest young women students in homemade muslin with modest ribbons, over-smiling old maids of the town, venerable saints from the back-country with beards which partly hid the fact that they wore collars without ties, old women with billowing shoulders, irritated young married couples with broods of babies who crawled, slid, bellowed, and stared with embarrassing wonder at bachelors.\n\nFive minutes later Elmer would not have had a seat down front. Now he could not escape. He was packed in between his mother and a wheezing fat man, and in the aisle beside his pew stood evangelical tailors and ardent school-teachers.\n\nThe congregation swung into \"When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder\" and Elmer gave up his frenzied but impractical plans for escape. His mother nestled happily beside him, her hand proudly touching his sleeve, and he was stirred by the march and battle of the hymn:\n\nWhen the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,\n\nAnd the morning breaks eternal, bright and far.--\n\nThey stood for the singing of \"Shall We Gather at the River?\" Elmer inarticulately began to feel his community with these humble, aspiring people--his own prairie tribe: this gaunt carpenter, a good fellow, full of friendly greetings; this farm-wife, so courageous, channeled by pioneer labor; this classmate, an admirable basket-ball player, yet now chanting beatifically, his head back, his eyes closed, his voice ringing. Elmer's own people. Could he be a traitor to them, could he resist the current of their united belief and longing?\n\nYes, we'll gather at the river,\n\nThe beautiful, the beautiful river,\n\nGather with the saints at the river\n\nThat flows by the throne of God.\n\nCould he endure it to be away from them, in the chill void of Jim Lefferts' rationalizing, on that day when they should be rejoicing in the warm morning sunshine by the river rolling to the imperishable Throne?\n\nAnd his voice--he had merely muttered the words of the first hymn--boomed out ungrudgingly:\n\nSoon our pilgrimage will cease; Soon our happy hearts will quiver With the melody of peace.\n\nHis mother stroked his sleeve. He remembered that she had maintained he was the best singer she had ever heard; that Jim Lefferts had admitted, \"You certainly can make that hymn dope sound as if it meant something.\" He noted that people near by looked about with pleasure when they heard his Big Ben dominate the cracked jangling.\n\nThe preliminaries merely warmed up the audience for Judson Roberts. Old Jud was in form. He laughed, he shouted, he knelt and wept with real tears, he loved everybody, he raced down into the audience and patted shoulders, and for the moment everybody felt that he was closer to them than their closest friends.\n\n\"Rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race,\" was his text.\n\nRoberts was really a competent athlete, and he really had skill in evoking pictures. He described the Chicago-Michigan game, and Elmer was lost in him, with him lived the moments of the scrimmage, the long run with the ball, the bleachers rising to him.\n\nRoberts voice softened. He was pleading. He was not talking, he said, to weak men who needed coddling into the Kingdom, but to strong men, to rejoicing men, to men brave in armor. There was another sort of race more exhilarating than any game, and it led not merely to a score on a big board but to the making of a new world--it led not to newspaper paragraphs but to glory eternal. Dangerous--calling for strong men! Ecstatic--brimming with thrills! The team captained by Christ! No timid Jesus did he preach, but the adventurer who had joyed to associate with common men, with reckless fishermen, with captains and rulers, who had dared to face the soldiers in the garden, who had dared the myrmidons of Rome and death itself! Come! Who was gallant? Who had nerve? Who longed to live abundantly? Let them come!\n\nThey must confess their sins, they must repent, they must know their own weakness save as they were reborn in Christ. But they must confess not in heaven-pilfering weakness, but in training for the battle under the wind-torn banners of the Mighty Captain. Who would come? Who would come? Who was for vision and the great adventure?\n\nHe was among them, Judson Roberts, with his arms held out, his voice a bugle. Young men sobbed and knelt; a woman shrieked; people were elbowing the standers in the aisles and pushing forward to kneel in agonized happiness, and suddenly they were setting relentlessly on a bewildered Elmer Gantry, who had been betrayed into forgetting himself, into longing to be one with Judson Roberts.\n\nHis mother was wringing his hand, begging, \"Oh, won't you come? Won't you make your old mother happy? Let yourself know the joy of surrender to Jesus!\" She was weeping, old eyes puckered, and in her weeping was his every recollection of winter dawns when she had let him stay in bed and brought porridge to him across the icy floor; winter evenings when he had awakened to find her still stitching; and that confusing intimidating hour, in the abyss of his first memories, when he had seen her shaken beside a coffin that contained a cold monster in the shape of his father.\n\nThe basket-ball player was patting his other arm, begging, \"Dear old Hell-cat, you've never let yourself be happy! You've been lonely! Let yourself be happy with us! You know I'm no mollycoddle. Won't you know the happiness of salvation with us?\"\n\nA thread-thin old man, very dignified, a man with secret eyes that had known battles, and mountain-valleys, was holding out his hands to Elmer, imploring with a humility utterly disconcerting, \"Oh, come, come with us--don't stand there making Jesus beg and beg--don't leave the Christ that died for us standing out in the cold, begging!\"\n\nAnd, somehow, flashing through the crowd, Judson Roberts was with Elmer, honoring him beyond all the multitude, appealing for his friendship--Judson Roberts the gorgeous, beseeching:\n\n\"Are you going to hurt me, Elmer? Are you going to let me go away miserable and beaten, old man? Are you going to betray me like Judas, when I've offered you my Jesus as the most precious gift I can bring you? Are you going to slap me and defile me and hurt me? Come! Think of the joy of being rid of all those nasty little sins that you've felt so ashamed of! Won't you come kneel with me, won't you?\"\n\nHis mother shrieked, \"Won't you, Elmer? With him and me? Won't you make us happy? Won't you be big enough to not be afraid? See how we're all longing for you, praying for you!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" from around him, from strangers; and \"Help me to follow you, Brother--I'll go if you will!\" Voices woven, thick, dove-white and terrifying black of mourning and lightning-colored, flung around him, binding him--His mother's pleading, Judson Roberts' tribute--\n\nAn instant he saw Jim Lefferts, and heard him insist: \"Why, sure, course they believe it. They hypnotize themselves. But don't let 'em hypnotize you!\"\n\nHe saw Jim's eyes, that for him alone veiled their bright harshness and became lonely, asking for comradeship. He struggled; with all the blubbering confusion of a small boy set on by his elders, frightened and overwhelmed, he longed to be honest, to be true to Jim--to be true to himself and his own good honest sins and whatsoever penalties they might carry. Then the visions were driven away by voices that closed over him like surf above an exhausted swimmer. Volitionless, marveling at the sight of himself as a pinioned giant, he was being urged forward, forced forward, his mother on one arm and Judson on the other, a rhapsodic mob following.\n\nBewildered. Miserable. . . . False to Jim.\n\nBut as he came to the row kneeling in front of the first pew, he had a thought that made everything all right. Yes! He could have both! He could keep Judson and his mother, yet retain Jim's respect. He had only to bring Jim also to Jesus, then all of them would be together in beatitude!\n\nFreed from misery by that revelation, he knelt, and suddenly his voice was noisy in confession, while the shouts of the audience, the ejaculations of Judson and his mother, exalted him to hot self-approval and made it seem splendidly right to yield to the mystic fervor.\n\nHe had but little to do with what he said. The willing was not his but the mob's; the phrases were not his but those of the emotional preachers and hysterical worshipers whom he had heard since babyhood:\n\n\"O God, oh, I have sinned! My sins are heavy on me! I am unworthy of compassion! O Jesus, intercede for me! Oh, let thy blood that was shed for me be my salvation! O God, I do truly repent of my great sinning and I do long for the everlasting peace of thy bosom!\"\n\n\"Oh, praise God,\" from the multitude, and \"Praise his holy name! Thank God, thank God, thank God! Oh, hallelujah, Brother, thank the dear loving God!\"\n\nHe was certain that he would never again want to guzzle, to follow loose women, to blaspheme; he knew the rapture of salvation--yes, and of being the center of interest in the crowd.\n\nOthers about him were beating their foreheads, others were shrieking, \"Lord, be merciful,\" and one woman--he remembered her as a strange, repressed, mad-eyed special student who was not known to have any friends--was stretched out, oblivious of the crowd, jerking, her limbs twitching, her hands clenched, panting rhythmically.\n\nBut it was Elmer, tallest of the converts, tall as Judson Roberts, whom all the students and most of the townpeople found important, who found himself important.\n\nHis mother was crying, \"Oh, this is the happiest hour of my life, dear! This makes up for everything!\"\n\nTo be able to give her such delight!\n\nJudson was clawing Elmer's hand, whooping, \"Liked to had you on the team at Chicago, but I'm a lot gladder to have you with me on Christ's team! If you knew how proud I am!\"\n\nTo be thus linked forever with Judson!\n\nElmer's embarrassment was gliding into a robust self-satisfaction.\n\nThen the others were crowding on him, shaking his hand, congratulating him: the football center, the Latin professor, the town grocer. President Quarles, his chin whisker vibrant and his shaven upper lip wiggling from side to side, was insisting, \"Come, Brother Elmer, stand up on the platform and say a few words to us--you must--we all need it--we're thrilled by your splendid example!\"\n\nElmer was not quite sure how he got through the converts, up the steps to the platform. He suspected afterward that Judson Roberts had done a good deal of trained pu"
