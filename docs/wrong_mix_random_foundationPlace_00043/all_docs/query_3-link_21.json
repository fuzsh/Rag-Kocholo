        "text": "Education can’t wait. Our COVID-19 response program, Tomorrow Is Now, supports the capacity of local leadership in rural districts throughout Uganda by recruiting and training thousands of Community Education Volunteers as education extension agents. These are the stories of five CEVs addressing the learning crisis in Nakasongola, Central Uganda.\n\nAt times it almost feels normal to see schools boarded up, classrooms empty, and children sitting idly at home. In fact, this has been the new normal since March 2020, when the government of Uganda declared that all schools immediately close to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. But take a close look at any district in the country and you will remember that this is far from ordinary; it is perhaps the greatest education crisis of our lifetime.\n\nThe longer students remain out of school, the greater the risk they will never return to the classroom. Our team is already beginning to see children in the communities we serve lose hope in ever completing their education.\n\nThat’s where our COVID-19 response program, Tomorrow Is Now (TIN), comes in. In partnership with the Mastercard Foundation and other partners, TIN leverages the expertise of 16 graduates of our Fellowship program, re-deploying them in a leadership role at the district Sub-County level in 5 districts throughout Central Uganda. Their primary task is supporting government officials in recruiting and training a corps of Community Education Volunteers, who work directly with neighbors and families in their villages to host community learning camps while schools remain closed.\n\nThese camps, held outdoors and in small groups in accordance with local health guidelines, are the only formal learning many children have received in nearly two years.\n\nThese are the stories of five CEVs in Nakasongola District, Central Uganda who are reigniting a love for education in rural communities throughout the district, ensuring that learners are gaining confidence in their academics and becoming eager to return to the classroom.\n\nGodfrey\n\nKyeyindula Village in Kakooge Sub-County\n\nI decided to join Building Tomorrow as a Community Education Volunteer because of a word called “patriotism.” I have so much love for my country and its development. I want to build up these young ones so they can become the future doctors, teachers, and artists of Uganda.\n\nBuilding Tomorrow taught me some teaching methods that are not used in government schools, like using songs and games to motivate students. For example, when a learner answers a question, we have to motivate them by clapping and singing for them! This helps build relationships with the learners and gives them confidence.\n\nChildren enjoy coming to my camp every day. They always tell me, “Master, we wish we could learn with you all the time!” This lockdown has affected them a lot. But when we come together and they’re learning, they are happy.\n\nThanks to Building Tomorrow, I was also able to get my COVID vaccine so I can feel even more safe leading these camps. I was so happy to finally get my first shot! Getting vaccinated? Now that’s patriotism.\n\nMiriam and Susan\n\nKigazi and Kisenyi Villages, Kalungi Sub-County\n\nWe became Community Education Volunteers earlier this year with the goal of empowering children to wake up their brains in this corona time because they have been at home for so long. We started going door-to-door throughout the villages to recruit children to join our camp. Parents were so excited about the program! So many parents wanted their children to join us, but according to health guidelines, we can only have a group of 15 at a time. So we have alternating groups of learners who come and learn from us!\n\nAt our camps, we play so many games! They’re meant to help the children learn syllables, numbers, and reading in a fun way. So far, we’ve noticed our students learning so much and improving their confidence each day. Their brains are waking up, and they are re-learning all of the things they’ve forgotten since they were last at school. They’re starting to love education, and education is so important for their future.\n\nAgnes\n\nBamusuuta Village, Kakooge Sub-County\n\nWhen Building Tomorrow first came to my home, I was told they were going to send volunteers into the community to teach kids how to read and write. I felt that I could do it! I studied up to Senior 3, so I had some knowledge to share with the kids in my village. Then Building Tomorrow and the Kakooge Sub-County leadership invited me to a teacher training, and I gained even more skills, like how to teach literacy and numeracy in a fun way. I didn’t know those things before!\n\nMy favorite thing about leading Roots to Rise learning camps (at a small, open church near my home) is the love I get from the children. When I’m walking down the road, they shout, “Teacher, teacher!” They are trusting me, and so are their parents. That trust is so important because many children in the community say they have given up on continuing their education. They are getting older, but schools remain closed.\n\nI see my primary role as giving them hope. Through my mentorship, I’m convincing them of the importance of education. I’m reminding them that if they go to school, they can have a better life. Everyday, I feel that I’m improving my community, one child at a time.\n\nGeoffrey\n\nRampanga Village, Migeera Sub-County\n\nI became a Community Education Volunteer because I wanted to improve the academics of children in my village while schools remain closed. They have been at home for so, so long. Many of them will choose to drop out, or become pregnant and start families. I completed university and was trained as a teacher. I knew that I could make a difference in this crisis.\n\n“Building Tomorrow is so, so good. Because of them, children have had the chance to learn.”\n\nAs a CEV, I have been going door-to-door visiting homes, giving lectures about the importance of education, and leading Roots to Rise community learning camps. The learners like the games we play so much. They’re being entertained, but also learning at the same time.\n\nBuilding Tomorrow is so, so good. Because of them, children have had the chance to learn. When they are at my camp, they feel like they’re at school. Now, they are so eager for schools to reopen so they can practically apply what they’re learning in the classroom. They are ready to go back.\n\nBuilding Tomorrow’s Community Education Volunteers have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 education crisis, working tirelessly to connect out-of-school children with learning opportunities while schools remain closed throughout Uganda. Our CEVs are passionate about developing their villages through the power of education, and utilize their strong connections within the community to mobilize household caregivers to enroll their children in our at-home learning programs. The longer students sit at home, the more at-risk they become of never returning to the classroom. Our CEV outreach is an absolutely critical component of ensuring that no child has to throw their dreams of an education away because of COVID-19.\n\nSupport our CEV program at buildingtomorrow.org/donate."
