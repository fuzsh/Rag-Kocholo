        "text": "It was our second time dinner at Eight4Nine.. food was great.. very friendly n kind staff, ambiance was great! I highly recommend it and will definitely go hack there next time i visit Palm springs. Last note: Music choice is one of the best and it makes me want to go back n enjoy dinner in that beautiful ambiance. Keep up the good work\n\nMade reservations for Saturday lunch/brunch. Arrived a few minutes early and we were still seated immediately. The staff was so friendly and provided excellent t service. I love the decor and vibe of Eight4Nine! It's so Palm Springs chic. The food was awesome! My husband and I shared the Turkey and Brie Monte Cristo and so glad we did; huge portions. It was very very good...\n\nI am a foodie. And although the food culture in Palm Springs has matured significantly, still few experiences stand out beyond merely a \"good meal in Palm Springs.\" Eight4nine i superb by standards anywhere. I have long dreamed of finding a dish to rival the duck relleno poblano if Rebecca's in Venice in the early 90s, but I found an almost identical dish on the menu here.\n\nWent here to celebrate my daughter's and my birthdays. Yes, we were born on the same day few years apart... Seated outside 10 ft way from others. Food was good, service was good. They even brought 2 deserts with candles for us to blow out. We really appreciated it. This was our second time here and will definitely be back next time we are visiting Palm Springs.\n\nReally nice restaurant! They have a lovely outdoor space that we really enjoyed! The food was wonderful. We got the crab and corn chowder which was tasty, but it could have used a little spicy kick! We also had a Cesar salad, it was dressed perfect. Lastly, we ordered the Chilean sea bass with crab stuff piquillo pepper over greens. It was very good and cooked perfectly! We enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere. Would recommend! It gets very busy, so book a reservation early!"
