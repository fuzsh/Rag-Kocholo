        "text": "Heading East to South of North\n\nWe’ve been experiencing a heatwave this week, with temperatures getting well above 100 degrees. Then on Saturday statewide news outlets reported a fire had broken out near the Placerville airport. Given the tinder-dry conditions and the large number of historic wooden structures in the area, my mind naturally turned to this question:\n\nThere’s an airport in Placerville?\n\nI’d certainly never heard of it before. And now it was burning?? Borrowing an aphorism from Ronald Reagan, I decided to trust but verify. So this morning I headed up the hill and just east of town I came to the very real Placerville Airport (PVF). It’s a one-runway airport that apparently mainly handles private, single-prop aircraft.\n\nI didn’t manage to get a photo of the airport because there was a Sheriff’s cruiser blocking the entrance, presumably to keep our lookie-loos like myself. But I can report that there was absolutely no evidence of a fire. No scorched trees, no smell of smoke, no nothing. This is odd, because to judge by the news reports you’d think it was the Second Coming of the Great Chicago Fire. Friends and relatives from all over the country have been texting me asking if our home was threatened by the inferno.\n\nAnyway, as long as I was heading east on US 50 I figured I’d continue up to Lake Tahoe and enjoy a respite from the heat. I met up with my old college roommate, Bruce, who was with his dad at Zephyr Cove for a music camp. It’s always nice to come up to Tahoe, with the smell of pine and the views of the lake and the cool(er) temperatures.\n\nNear Zephyr Cove is a brew pub with the confusing name of South of North Brewing Company. This is where Bruce and I went for lunch, and we were glad we did. It’s nestled into a relaxing setting, with plenty of outdoor seating under pine trees and solar shades. Amidst the outdoor seating are a ping-pong table and the now-requisite Cornhole game. A rustic but homey building houses their service counter/bar, an event space, a bar, and their brewing operation. Yes, they brew their own beer. Today they had eight of their delicious beers on tap, plus another half-dozen guest brews. Notably, they are the only brewery in the area to draw their water directly from Lake Tahoe, and I want to think it makes a real difference in the taste. Didn’t some Brand X brewer used to say “it’s the water, and a lot more”?\n\nThe head brewer is a Sacramento transplant named Thomas. He’s been here for a little over three years, and with a single assistant they make all those beers. The brewing space is a converted hotel room. (Their business abuts an old hotel.) Their brewing tanks were custom designed for the space.\n\nSo Bruce and I found a table in the shade and enjoyed pastrami sandwiches, salads, Bavarian pretzels with beer cheese, and a handful of beers. The food was delicious, the weather was perfect, and the bartender, Heather, had her personal 1970’s classic rock playlist feeding into the speakers. It was just what we were looking for.\n\nMeanwhile, the Community Engagement Event Coordinator, Sam, was setting up a stage for their signature “Listening Room” program, where local artists share their music and tell their stories. The place was a hub of activity, and is clearly one of the go-to destinations in the Tahoe area.\n\nSo, if it hasn’t already been made obvious, this is an awesome place that’s a worthy Tahoe destination, no matter where you’re coming from. I’m definitely coming back soon.\n\nBREW OF THE DAY\n\nThe BOTD is South of North’s Solar Midnight Imperil Stout. This is a deceptively drinkable beer, even on a hot day (by Tahoe standards). It’s exceptionally smooth with the consistency of strong coffee. Served with almost no head, this is not as heavy or creamy as your average stout. It has distinct notes of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and licorice. Each sip is pretty sweet on the front, but it finishes with some mild hoppiness that keeps the whole experience from becoming cloying.\n\nThis beer clocks in at 9 percent ABV, which is why it’s only available in a 10-ounce pour. You can’t drink just one, though, so I was compelled to order a second. Then Sam bought me a third as a way of saying thanks for helping her with the stage curtain. It wasn’t until after I finished that one that I realized I hadn’t taken a picture of my drink. Given my dedication to my readers, I was compelled to the counter and asked for another pour purely as a photo op. Heather insisted that this one was on the house, and I felt it would seem ungrateful not to drink it. This all explains why I’m sitting here trying to sober up before heading back down the mountain to Placerville.\n\nOctopus’s Garden\n\nVery recently I visited the second-oldest railroad depot in California. And that naturally got me to wondering about the first-oldest (otherwise known simply as the oldest) railroad depot in California. And that would be the Santa Clara Depot, built in 1863.\n\nI happened to grow up near Santa Clara, and I’m sure I must have visited the Santa Clara depot with my friend Detlef, as he and I would regularly ride our bikes to various railroad sites in the area to explore the ancient (though still-active) passenger cars and use our cassette recorders to capture the panoply of sounds emanating from the Southern Pacific locomotives as they pulled their trains to the platforms. Occasionally one of us would take a photo, but this was in the days before phone cameras, and lugging around an SLR was a hassle. Still, it was those experiences–seeing and hearing and smelling the various aspects of the moribund Southern Pacific passenger trains in the 1970s–that number among the best memories of my youth.\n\nThe Santa Clara Depot was built by the long-forgotten San Francisco and San Jose Railroad Company. Like most of the other small railroads in California around that time, the SF&SJ was acquired by the mighty Southern Pacific (non-affectionately known as The Octopus).\n\nThough it’s survived for over a century and a half, the depot has undergone its share of work over the years. Notably, in 1877, the entire station was moved across the railroad tracks and joined to an existing freight facility. The historic photo below (lifted from my Uncle Edward’s celebrated Dome o’ Foam) clearly shows the original passenger depot in the front, connected to the larger freight building in the back.\n\nAs you can see from the photos I took today, the original appearance remains largely intact.\n\nA hundred and fifty years ago, before Starbucks and shopping malls, a railroad station like this would be a major hub of activity in the community. Santa Clara Depot’s fortunes of course declined in the automobile age, but it survived the shift of passenger service to Amtrak, the demise of Southern Pacific, and the arrival of CalTrain. Indeed, the depot still had a functioning ticket office as late as 1997.\n\nToday the depot is part of what’s called the Santa Clara Transit Center, where several rail and bus lines converge. There are also plans to eventually tie in a BART extension.\n\nWhile the depot no longer offers its ticket office or waiting room or even restrooms to train travelers, it does house a railroad museum. Sadly, the museum is only open two days a week, and was closed when I was there. So I can’t report on the depot’s interior features. That said, the building lends an authenticity and ambiance to this transportation hub, and I’m pleased to see it featured so prominently.\n\nJust a stone’s throw from the depot is another historic structure: This “interlocking tower” (whose purpose is to control rail switches in the nearby Santa Clara railyard) was constructed in 1926.\n\nThe tower was in service until 1993, when switch and signal controls were centralized at San Jose. Those of you who watched the 2010 movie Unstoppable know the risks of that kind of technological advance….\n\nAnyway, next to the tower is a commemorative plaque installed by the City Council in 2002:\n\n..and next to that plaque is a second one, installed by E Clampus Vitus in 2013. Note in particular the narrow secondary plaque beneath the main one:\n\nNow, there are two notable points here: First, while E Clampus Vitus installed the second plaque 11 years after the City Council’s plaque, they take pains to point out they were prepared to be first. You’ve got to wonder what caused the 14-year delay. Second, and more importantly, is this: What in tarnation is E Clampus Vitus? You see their plaques all over the west. Are they a legit historical society? A dangerous cult? An Andy Kaufman-esque hoax? You can of course get some insight to these questions through Wikipedia, but I am going to do some hard-hitting investigative journalism on this topic and present a full blog post on ECV in the near future. If any of my loyal readers is a member of the ECV (i.e., a Clamper), please contact me.\n\nIn the meantime, I leave you with this sign that stands at the Santa Clara Depot, which raises a question that a Clamper might ask: Who is the “Lookout” for the locomotive?\n\nObelisk and Doggie Head Update!\n\nAttentive readers will recall that last November, while in the Bay Area burg of Port Costa (pop: 200), I encountered this dachshund from the long-defunct Doggie Diner chain.\n\nToday as I was cruising CA Route 49 through Amador County, I passed another Doggie Diner head. This one is at the Vino Noceto winery in the town of Plymouth (pop: 1,100).\n\nThe giant heads adorned the 30 or so Doggie Diner restaurants around the Bay Area (concentrated mainly in San Francisco). It seems that when the chain closed in the 1980s, many of the doggie heads were purchased by private parties. The owners of Vino Noceto got theirs in 1985 at a fundraising auction for their kid’s nursery school. On a lark they had offered $300, expecting that surely someone else would outbid them. But theirs was the only bid. Let that be a lesson to you all.\n\nThese orphan heads remind me of the Golden Bear signs. I encourage all faithful readers of this blog to report any Doggie Diner Heads you might be aware of. And of course, also let me know of any Golden Bear sightings.\n\nSpeaking of crowd-sourced photo collections, loyal reader Brian W shared this photo he took of an obelisk in front of the South Carolina statehouse.\n\nBrian has been commissioned to photograph all the state capitols, which is itself an impressive project. The obelisk is part of the state’s African American History Monument, and was installed in 2001. The artist who designed the monument asserts that obelisk is a form that originated in Africa. Wikipedia tells us that the earliest obelisks come from Egypt, so I guess it depends on whether you consider Egypt to be an African or an Asian country. Either way, the monument is an impressive one and is part of a historic compromise that also removed the Confederate flag from the statehouse building.\n\nThat’s it for this brief update. Next week I’ll have the story of California’s oldest operating railroad depot.\n\n“We’re Number Two!”\n\nThe other day I passed a billboard near Sacramento State University, which touted the campus football team’s Number 6 ranking in a media poll. This of course raises the question: how quickly do bragging rights decay as you move down the list, from first to second to third to fourth….?\n\nA 1966 novelty song (on heavy rotation on Dr. Demento’s radio show while I was growing up) poked fun at this phenomenon. “The Ballad of Irving” sang the praises of the “142nd fastest gun in the West.” My favorite line: “A hundred and forty-one could draw faster than he/\n\nBut Irving was looking for one forty-three.” Give it a listen:\n\nI bring all this up because son Ian called my attention to “the second oldest railroad depot in California.” It’s in Calistoga, in the upper Napa Valley. The depot was built in 1868. (A quick Google search identifies the oldest Depot as Santa Clara Depot, which was constructed in 1863.)\n\nThe important thing about the Calistoga Depot is that it held a grand (re-)opening just a couple of months ago, and it’s now repurposed as a microbrewery, distillery, and restaurant venue. Once I learned this I decided it’s obviously time for a road trip. So this morning I set out for Calistoga.\n\nThe city of Calistoga (pop: 5,300) was established in the mid-1860s, centered on Sam Brannan’s Hot Springs Resort. Sam Brannan had come to California from New York in 1846, and made his fortune selling gold pans to the miners during the Gold Rush. It should be noted that he first bought all those gold pans and other gear from every supplier in the West, monopolizing the market shortly before the Gold Rush became big news. He sold the equipment at an enormous profit.\n\nAs a result, Brannan became California’s first millionaire. In addition to building the Resort he co-founded the Napa Valley Railroad. The Calistoga Depot marked the northern terminus of that short line, carrying vacationers from the Bay Area.\n\nBrannan’s Napa Valley Railroad didn’t last long, and was absorbed by what eventually became the Southern Pacific. SP dropped passenger service along the route in the 1920s, but today trains run again on those rails, in the form of the Napa Valley Wine Train.\n\nIncidentally, the name “Calistoga” is supposedly the result of an unintentional Malapropism. Brannan liked to compare his Hot Springs Resort to the famous Saratoga Springs in his native New York. So at the grand opening of his resort, he intended to say something like “Here’s to the Saratoga of California!” But it came out as “the Calistoga of Sarafornia.” (OK, that’s not exactly a Malapropism. Leave a comment below if you know what specifically this error of speech should be called.)\n\nOne other thing about Sam Brannan: He built a distillery that cranked out huge amounts of bandy that, it’s said, rivaled the finest French cognac. All this, as a Mormon leader. The brandy will figure into our story a bit later.\n\nAnyway, as I was saying, I headed out for Calistoga this morning. I took the scenic route roughly paralleling Putah creek westward from Davis. When I stopped for gas in Winters (pop: 7,300) this second-story window of an old office building caught my attention. I guess Sam (Spade, not Brannan) decided to relocate 70 miles eastward from San Francisco sometime after solving the Maltese Falcon caper.\n\nI followed Putah Creek to Monticello Dam, which was built in 1957 as a hydroelectric project that also resulted in Lake Berryessa. (Since we’re focused on rankings, Lake Berryessa is the 7th largest man-made lake in California.) After 65 years, the dam is showing its age, but the lake remains a popular spot for boating.\n\nConveniently, I rolled into Calistoga around lunchtime. And there was the Calistoga Depot, in all its glory. If Monticello Dam is looking a little long in the tooth after 65 years, the Calistoga Depot looks fabulous after more than 150 years.\n\nIn fact, it might be a little too fabulous. Over the past few years the property has undergone an extensive renovation and repurposing, to the point that it doesn’t really feel as authentic as some of the dilapidated historic structures I’ve seen on other travels. I fear most of the Depot’s ghosts are long gone. Still, the building’s footprint and outward features are largely as they were in Sam Brannan’s time. Just compare the above photo to the historic photo near the beginning of this post.\n\nAdding to the ambiance, a half-dozen vintage passenger cars are situated at the station platform. Each car is being used as a restaurant, bar, or boutique. Sadly, the “First Millionaire Saloon” car was closed today.\n\nBut all was not lost. You can sit anywhere you like on the property–inside a lounge railcar, out in the biergarten, inside the Depot itself–and then you can order whatever you want–drinks, food, dessert. Roaming servers make sure you’re taken care of wherever you choose to sit. I opted for a seat in the biergarten, as the weather was perfect, and had me an awesome wood-fired pizza and a flight of local whiskeys.\n\nAlthough all the whiskeys are local, none is distilled on site. It seems that the fire risk inside the ancient station is just high. So they work with other local distilleries to create house brands.\n\nAfter lunch I moseyed into the Depot building itself. It’s an impressive space, with upstairs seating that looks down on the main bar, taxidermied animals, a regulation pool table, antique chandeliers, historic photos, and various artifacts.\n\nI bellied up to the bar and was served by the estimable Eddie. He’s been here since the (re-)opening, which admittedly was only like two months ago. But still, he’s in for the long haul. He served me a full pour of the second tasting from my flight: The First Millionaire Single-Malt Scotch.\n\nWhile I enjoyed my Scotch, Eddie pointed out a few features of the bar. Such as the shovel handles lining one end of the bar, and the shovel heads lining the other. Obviously, these are a reference to the tools Sam Brannan sold to the miners at exorbitant prices.\n\nI’m sure you spotted the irregularity among the shovel heads. Yes, it’s a–ahem–hoe. Eddie informs me it’s a none-too-subtle reference to Lola Montez, who was a famous Bohemian courtesan (among other things). Could she have been a lover to Sam Brannan? Eddie thinks so.\n\nWhich leads us to today’s BOTD–which is not a beer, but a rye whiskey. (Let’s call it the “Beverage Of The Day.”) Named “Fame and Misfortune,” it features a picture of Lola Montez.\n\nIt’s a straight rye finished in Angelica (brandy) casks. Eddie poured me a healthy two fingers, and we were off to the races.\n\nNow this is a soft and spicy rye. I’ll leave it for others to opine on how that might correlate with its namesake. But this is exceptionally smooth and warm, with no bite. I detect hints of cinnamon, cloves, licorice, and anise. The ABV is a standard 80 proof, which suited me just fine for the lunch hour. I enjoyed it so much I was ready to take a bottle home, but at $150 I found the price (but not the whiskey) hard to swallow. Four stars out of five.\n\nAfter making my goodbyes to Eddie, I had one more mission: Remember that Sam Brannan had started out in this area with his Hot Springs Resort. It turns out there’s lots of geothermal activity in Calistoga. (It’s not for nothing that Calistoga Mineral Water is based here.) Today, one of the most famous such features is the Old Faithful geyser, which would be my final stop.\n\nOn my way to the geyser I crossed an old (1902) stone bridge over Gannett Creek. I can’t find much in the way of history about the bridge, but she’s a beauty. They just don’t make ’em like this anymore.\n\nTwenty minutes later I was at Old Faithful. Not to be confused with the geyser in Yellowstone, this one is, well, not quite as faithful. The time between eruptions can be anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour. Today it was about 30 minutes. While I waited, I checked out this photo op:\n\nNow, doesn’t it seem odd that the hole for your face isn’t replacing the goat’s face, but just his forehead/nose?\n\nFinally, I was rewarded with a spray of 130-degree water that lasted over five minutes. Check out the video:\n\nAnd thus concludes my trip to Calistoga. I must say that the Calistoga Depot preserves a worthy slice of California history, not so much because of the short-lived Napa Valley Railroad but because of larger-than-life Sam Brannan. And even those without a huge interest in early California History can enjoy some great food, drink, and hospitality.\n\nStay tuned for my visit to the oldest railroad station in California, in about two weeks!\n\nBack To Benjamin\n\nToday I returned to Philadelphia to finish up my Ben Franklin research. This took me a couple of sites that you might not associate directly with Franklin. For example, I spend a couple of hours meandering about the labyrinthine Eastern State Penitentiary. Opened in 1829, it’s considered the world’s first true “penitentiary,” designed specifically to promote penitence among its inmates. Toward this end, prisoners at Eastern State were kept entirely isolated from one another, housed in (relatively large, by today’s standards) cells that resembled small chapels, prohibited from speaking, and given solitary jobs to perform. The idea was that isolation would impel prisoners to reflect on their crimes and on spiritual salvation.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Ben Franklin, you ask? Eastern State Penitentiary was a direct (though delayed) outgrown of a meeting held at Ben Franklin’s house in 1787. Franklin and other notable Philadelphians formed “The Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons,” and many of the points for which the Society advocated were adopted into the design of the new prison. It was truly a paradigm shift in the punishment of lawbreakers.\n\nThe model underlying Eastern State was adopted across the world, with many hundreds of prisons following the so-called “Pennsylvania System.” Over time, however, Eastern State’s approach proved too costly, and the principles of isolation and silence were officially abandoned at the prison in 1913. It closed due to obsolescence in 1970.\n\nFor decades the prison simply decayed in place and was eventually slated for demolition. But it was saved by preservationists at the last minute, and since the 1990s it has been maintained in a state of arrested decay, with tours offered most days of the week.\n\nIt was a sobering visit. And while one can certainly find fault with the system of incarceration, we can thank Ben Franklin (among others) for helping to move the country away from the horrific practices of the 18th century.\n\nMy next visit of the day is harder to connect with Ben Franklin: the Edgar Allan Poe house on N. 7th Street. But there is a connection. Poe wrote a short story titled “The Business Man” that, some scholars claim, is meant as a satire of Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography. (Poe actually wrote several satirical pieces that ridicule the concept of a “self-made man” and conceit more generally.)\n\nAnyway, as we learned a couple of days ago at The Philadelphia Free Library, Edgar Allan Poe had called Philadelphia home for about six years, from 1838 to 1844. The last year of that time was spent at the house on N. 7th Street, which is now a US Parks Service site.\n\nThe house is a small, three-story brick structure that was built sometime between 1840 and 1842, so it was still quite new when Poe lived there. After Poe moved out the house changed hands dozens of times, with very little if any attention to its Poe connection. Finally it was purchased by Richard Gimbel (son of the department store magnate), who was a Poe fanboy. After his death in 1970, it eventually ended up with the National Park Service.\n\nThe house is mostly unfurnished, but the Park Rangers told me the floorplan and “bones” of the house are virtually unchanged from Poe’s day. In fact, I think this unfurnished space is more conducive to Poe’s spirit than one filled with period antiques and interactive displays and such. I found it quite easy to imagine Poe in this house, climbing these stairs, writing next to that window.\n\nPoe wrote a number of his best-known stories while living in Philadelphia. It’s difficult to connect specific tales with each of his four Philadelphia homes. But the basement of this house is very, very suggestive of the basement in “The Black Cat.”\n\nDo yourself a favor and re-read the story.\n\nWhile visiting the yard surrounding the house I ran into a trio of women tending the planting beds. They are Daughters of the American Revolution and they care for the plants once a week. They are very enthusiastic, and explained in some detail the types of herbs and flowers that Mrs. Poe probably grew out here.\n\nAlso in the garden area was this sculpture of a raven. I’ve got to say, though: It looks a little, uh, Third Reich for my tastes. I thought Dickens’ stuffed raven (Grip) looked more like it belonged on a pallid bust of Pallas.\n\nFinally, as I was leaving Poe’s house, I noticed a neighboring building with a Poe mural. It does seem that Philadelphia takes its Poe connections seriously.\n\nThe Park Rangers at the Poe house told me there are two other Poe homes in existence. The one in Baltimore (which I describe in this 2022 blog post, which also contains an Easter Egg related to The Thinker!) and one in The Bronx (which will have to be the subject of a later trip). I did impress the Rangers by pointing out that there’s a third extant Poe domicile in the form of his dorm room at UVA. (I describe it in this blog post.)\n\nBREW OF THE DAY\n\nMy final Ben Franklin experience today took place at Victory Brewing Company. The connection here is simply that it’s located at 1776 Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n\nIn 1996 Victory Brewing was established in Downingtown, PA (which you will recall is home to the diner featured in The Blob). This Philadelphia location opened in 2021.\n\nI ordered Victory’s Moonglow, which is a weizenbock. As you know, a weizenbock is a like a bock, but much of the barley is replaced with wheat. It’s a German style that you might find at the Munich Oktoberfest.\n\nVictory’s version displays a medium copper color, almost no head, and high carbonation. At the front it’s quite sweet, and reminiscent of a classic saison. You can’t help but notice the distinct flavor of dried apricot and raisins. Then there’s a burst of spices mid-palate, including clove, cinnamon, and maybe anise. This morphs into the distinctive flavor of banana Runts, which I consumed by the handful in the 1990s. Finally there’s a little bit of menthol on the finish. Overall, it’s an interestingly complex beer. At 8.7 percent ABV, it’s a beer for sipping rather than quaffing. But I ordered a second one anyway. I’m compelled to give it 4.5 stars out of 5.\n\nO Say Can You See?\n\nThe short answer is: Not very well.\n\nThe longer answer is this: Son Ian recommended I take advantage of my proximity to Baltimore (pop: 570,000) and check out the remains of the Francis Scott Key bridge, which collapsed a scant 3 weeks ago. It’s the kind of light-hearted whimsy we Boilards are known for.\n\nThe FSK Bridge opened in 1977, and it carried over 11 million vehicles annually until a container ship struck one of its piers last month. Much of the span is now underwater, posing a hazard to ships.\n\nThis week the Army Corps of Engineers is supposed to be removing much of that wreckage. It should make for a cool photo op! And according to Google Maps, I was only about an hour and a half from the foot of the bridge.\n\nSo after getting a cup of coffee and a Power Muffin from The Speckled Hen in Strasburg, I set out for the greater Baltimore area.\n\nGetting there was easy enough–until the last couple of miles, when I encountered a police roadblock. They weren’t going to let me get anywhere close to the foot of the bridge. I’m not sure what I was expecting. I guess I envisioned a big, Roadrunner-style “Bridge Out” sign on sawhorses a dozen yards from the shore of Boston Harbor.\n\nNo matter. There’s more than one way to skin a cat. I consulted Google and found a nearby spot that should afford a good view of the salvage operation. Alas, all the property in the area seemed to be a naval base or some other official facility that prohibits visitors. Undeterred, I drove under the harbor through the miraculous Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, and approached the Key bridge from the southern end. More roadblocks. Finally, I headed further south to a private beach community, where through a combination of illegal parking and trespassing I was able to get a decent view of the Francis Scott Key bridge in the distance.\n\nSo, now with that pointless project out of the way, I began a leisurely drive in the direction of Philadelphia.\n\nThe drive through the Maryland countryside was pleasant and picturesque. The road carved its way through hills dense with trees and other flora. My only complaint is that some of the signage was a bit hard to comprehend at a glance.\n\nSigns like these remind me of the nighttime driving scene in Pee Wee’s Big Adventure. It appears in the following clip, which is only 45 seconds. Note that the guy who uploaded the clip wants to point out you can see a pulley system moving the scenery. But we want to watch the clip just for the signs.\n\nAlong the way I passed another bridge that, like the FSK Bridge, no longer carries traffic. The Gilpin’s Falls covered bridge in Maryland’s Cecil County was originally constructed in 1860, and restored in 1959 and again in 2010. And unlike the FSK Bridge, it still sits on the same piers where it was placed in 1860.\n\nThe next roadside attraction requires a bit of a setup: You may recall that I’ve been charmed by Tin Man-themed yard art that I’ve spotted on my travels. Here are two recent examples:\n\nNow, recall my photo of Rodin’s “The Thinker” that I took in Philadelphia:\n\nPut them together and what do you get? This sculpture of “The Tinker” (note spelling) that sits in front of a brewery in York, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe artist claims his sculpture says something about York’s industrial history. I don’t know about that, but I’m simply taken by the whimsy and humanity of the thing. As I’ve said before: This world needs more Tin Men.\n\nI stopped for the night in Wilmington, Delaware–less than an hour from Philly. After my big splurge on the Red Caboose Motel last night I figured I’d bed down in a simple Days Inn. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by this sign whose reference to “”the best” seems like a dubious claim.\n\nThen I got to the office and saw this idling near the front doors:\n\nTomorrow I’ll head back into Philadelphia. God willing.\n\nMail Corner\n\nLoyal reader Brian W sent along this photo he took of a Lincoln Highway sign he spotted near Route 30 in Tama, Iowa. It dates from 1915, which is just two years after the Lincoln Highway was established.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the boring, utilitarian signage I encountered today in Strasburg.\n\nBrew of the Day\n\nI got today’s BOTD at Valhalla Brewing Company in Elkton, Maryland. It’s an out-of-the-way roadhouse with an empty parking lot and an nearly-empty bar. The bartender spent most of his time leaning on the bar and staring at his phone. But to be fair, it was 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday.\n\nI chose the Zombie Ice Double IPA. It turns out it’s a guest brew, made by 3 Floyds Brewing Co, in Munster, Indiana. Behold the golden-copper color:\n\nThe first sip suggested that this is just a basic IPA. But with subsequent sips it became more interesting. The usual citrus and hops are omnipresent, but as you move through it you detect orange peel, library paste, and shoe polish. You might not think that sounds especially tasty, but somehow it works. There’s a total lack of pretentiousness about this beer (except for its name, of course). It’s solid, genuine, and hardworking. I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I should note that I paired this IPA with Valhalla’s “Big Ass Pretzel,” which is served with mustard, beer cheese, and a maple-caramel sauce that is to die for. So consider that it might just be the pretzel talking. In fact, the Pretzel gave the beer 5 stars.\n\nBlob Blog\n\nBy coincidence, I recently received as gifts two books concerning the Lincoln Highway. The first, which I read last year, is The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles. It’s a fictional account about a trip along the fabled transcontinental route. The second book, which I’m currently reading, is American Road by Pete Davies. It’s a true account about a caravan of military vehicles which traversed the Lincoln Highway in 1919, in an effort to raise awareness and promote the paving of the route.\n\nEstablished in 1913, the Lincoln Highway was the country’s first transcontinental route for automobiles. It began as a patchwork of existing stretches of roadway, most of which were just rutted dirt roads. Over time it got re-aligned and paved, with gas stations and diners and motels dotting the roadside. Today, most of the old Lincoln Highway is long gone, superseded by modern interstates.\n\nIn California, I-80 roughly traverses the old route. There are a few markers and memorials a long the way. (A couple of years ago I hiked a crumbling, original section of the road near Donner Pass. Here’s the blog post and here’s the photo:)\n\nI also discussed the Lincoln Highway and included a photo of an original Lincoln Highway marker in this blog post.\n\nI bring all this up because today I drove around a hundred miles of the old Lincoln Highway route heading west out of Philadelphia. Most of the original route is now U.S. Route 30. I was hoping to see some ancient infrastructure and roadside structures from the Old Days, but most of the route today looks like any other two-lane highway. Yet I did spy a few elements that date back to the early 20th century.\n\nWhen I eventually arrived in Downingtown (pop: 7,900) I was feeling a bit peckish. I stopped at the mid-century Downingtown Diner, whose sign announces that it’s the “Home of the Blob.”\n\nYou remember The Blob, right? It was a 1958 science fiction film that featured a young Steve McQueen in his first starring role. The plot (such as it is) involves a giant, carnivorous blob of Jell-O from outer space. Do yourself a favor and watch the trailer; there’s even a shot of the diner.\n\nI went into the diner and was greeted by Shannon. I quizzed her about the Blob connection, but surprisingly (shockingly, even) she admitted to never having watched the movie. She did inform me, however, that the diner building was replaced since the movie was made. (“But the basement is original!”)\n\nThe Downington Diner doesn’t shrink from it’s B-movie connection. Not only is The Blob featured on their roadside sign, but the menu features a “Blob Special.”\n\nShannon, who was as friendly and helpful as they come, instead whipped me up a delicious mint chip milkshake. (“It’s green, like the Blob!”) Which is true, if you go by the green blob on their sign. But it should be noted that the Blob in the movie is red.\n\nNow that I was fortified with 1,700 calories of blended ice cream, there was only one thing to do: Head over to the nearby town of Phoenixville (pop: 20,000), where the Blob’s famous Movie Theater Scene was filmed. (You saw it in the trailer, above.) Phoenixville was founded in 1849, and for years the local economy was centered on the Phoenix Iron Works. The company closed in the 1980s, and Phoenixville suffered a economic decline. But in recent years the city has been transformed, and today it appears charming and downright prosperous.\n\nI sensed a good deal of civic pride in the spotless business district and beautiful homes. I even encountered a group of students from the local college who were spending the morning sprucing up the public spaces with rakes and brooms. These kids are seriously the best–energetic, outward-oriented, positive, friendly.\n\nBut let’s get back to the reason I came to Phoenixville: to see the theater from The Blob. The place looks practically unchanged from its 1958 movie appearance.\n\nThe Colonial Theater actually dates all the way back to 1903, when it started out hosting Vaudeville shows. Showbiz greats like Mary Pickford and Harry Houdini have graced its stage. It’s gratifying that the good people of Phoenixville have seen fit to preserve and support this historic venue. In fact, every summer the town and the theater throw a major festival called Blobfest. I’m seriously thinking about coming back in July…\n\nIt was now time to return to the Lincoln Highway, which in the form of US Route 30, cuts through Pennsylvania’s picturesque Amish county. Farm houses, rolling hills, and horse-drawn buggies constitute the main scenery. I figure these scenes are pretty much unchanged from when the Lincoln Highway was established over a century ago.\n\nOf course, when one travels through Pennsylvania’s Amish country one is obligated to take advantage of the Intercourse photo-op.\n\nAfter Intercourse I had a cigarette, and then headed into Strasburg, which is a well-known railroad Mecca. In addition to several impressive railroad museums, a steam-powered railroad, a model railroad display, and antique stores jammed with railroad memorabilia, Strasburg has a motel comprised entirely of old, full-size railroad cabooses.\n\nWhen I was a lad I begged my dad to let us stay at a place like this while we were on a driving vacation. What could be more cool than sleeping in a railroad cabooses? Dad said no, however, figuring that the fun factor (such as it was) wouldn’t justify the compromises in terms of comfort. But today I made a different calculation. So, over a half-century later, I’m finally spending the night in a caboose. It’s actually a nice little room, and the funky floorplan and high windows really lends a certain charm. Plugs, I’m surrounded by other railcars and a full-size steam railroad. I admit, however, that if my wife were with me this would not be an option.\n\nBsOTD\n\nToday’s Brews (note the plural) Of The Day come from Spring House Brewing Company in Strasburg. Their tavern on Main Street is comfortable and inviting, with ancient dark-wood paneling and a dark-wood stairway to unexplained upstairs rooms. My server (Dani) didn’t know how old the building is, but the ripples in the front window glass suggest at least a century.\n\nThe brewery had 13 of their own beers on tap, and I found it hard to choose just one. So I ordered a flight of four. And then, I ordered another flight of another 4. What follows, then, are my eight Brews of the Day.\n\nEmpty Terrarium: Nitro Fruited IPA (6.3% ABV). Watery. Boring. A slight tinge of citrus but no real flavor and no fizziness. It’s like a chocolate Easter Bunny after the first, decapitating bite: no head and not hoppy. 1 star out of 5.\n\nCommander Salamander: Fruited sour (4.5%). Seems to start with the same base as the Empty Terrarium, but somehow it’s fizzier (without really becoming hoppy). The sour taste is quite enjoyable–it’s fairly understated; more like sour apple gum than a lemon Warheads (TM) hard candy. This would be satisfying on a warm day (which today is not). It’s one of those beers that you should only have one of–not because of the alcohol, but because the second pint could be cloying. For the first glass, though, it’s quite satisfying. 3.5 stars.\n\nTasty Little Devil: Imperial Milk Stout (7.5%). Characteristic sweetness and creaminess of a milk stout. More roasty than chocolatey, But a slight peppermint note on the finish evokes a Christmas hot chocolate. Well balanced. I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. I would have given it a 4 if they upped the alcohol at least to 8 percent, which in my mind is the floor for anything called “Imperial.”\n\nKerplunk! Imperial chocolate stout (8.0%). The punctuation is part of the name, presumably taken from the Milton Bradley game. A bit harsher than the Tasty Little Devil. But more importantly, this doesn’t really attain its potential. Reminds me of brownie mix stirred into water. 2 stars.\n\nPainted Pony: English style brown ale (5.4%). Nicely balanced. A bit on the bitter side (which maybe is the “English style” coming through?) Definite chocolate notes. Good backbone. The kind of beer you’d enjoy at the neighborhood pub at the end of your 12-hour shift in the mines. 3 stars\n\nThe Angler: Cali Pale Ale (5%). Definitely the California style. Clean, citrusy, bright. It’s perfect for those of you who like this style of beer. Which I don’t. But I know quality when I taste it, so I’ll give it four stars.\n\nDemon Squirrel: Amber lager (5.3%). Now this is interesting. Malty, with some hints of fruitiness. Very balanced hops. Heavy carbonation adds dimensionality and compensates for the neutral finish. Flavorful without being overpowering. 4.5 stars.\n\nCASK Mild Party: Dark mild (3.3%). The name of the style (“dark mild”) says it all. Intentionally served at room temperature, this is a dark-colored beer with absolutely no structure, backbone, carbonation, or even flavor. It has the consistency and mouthfeel of dishwater. It tastes like watery tea that’s been left in a styrofoam cup on the dirty Formica counter for a day and a half. And it can’t even deliver a mild buzz. It’s the kind of beer that makes you question your faith in God. 1/2 star.\n\nPhiladelphia Stories\n\nI’ve been working on a top-secret project (which will likely be revealed by the end of the year) and it involves, oddly, Benjamin Franklin. I’m not making this up. And this project has made clear to me how much my grasp of American history is lacking.\n\nGrowing up in California, I never learned much about the Continental Congress or the Revolutionary War or really anything that took place before 1849. I’ve made a few attempts to remedy this, including my trip with friend Vic to Salem, Mass.\n\nSo I’m now trying to fill in some of the gaps in my education Which is why this morning I found myself in The Quaker City for a few days of exploration. What could go wrong?\n\nMy crash course on Philadelphia actually began on the plane ride. I’d taken a red-eye from Sacramento, and my seatmate was a garrulous Philadelphian (if you’ll permit me that redundant phrase). He was on his way home after a vacation with his wife, but they were taking separate planes. It seems there was some kind of booking mix-up related to the use of frequent flyer points. But the real point, for my purposes, is that he was unexpectedly flying solo and looking for someone to talk to. And having learned that I was going to be sight-seeing around his home turf, he spent the next few thousand miles sharing his insights about the city. (Did you know that Elphreth’s Alley is the oldest continuously-habitated street in America?)\n\nAnyway, I got breakfast and a Nissan Sentra near the airport and set out for downtown Philly. Ben Franklin is certainly well represented around the city. Bridges, parkways, institutes, boulevards, schools, and various other features of the city are named after Franklin. There’s even a large, modern sculpture of his distinctive bespectacled face and stringy hair on a random street corner.\n\nWhile chatting up the National Park ranger at the Ben Franklin Museum, I learned the following story: Some years back the Philadelphia Inquirer was taking up a collection for a Frank Sinatra mural somewhere in the city. A rival paper objected, pointing out in an editorial that Philadelphia should instead create a mural for one of its native sons. And, perhaps as a joke, the editorial noted that Larry Fine (of Three Stooges fame) is one such native son. The idea nevertheless caught on, donations were made, and the mural was painted at the location (S. 3rd and South Street) where Fine was born.\n\nBut I digress. I was talking about how Ben Franklin has captured this city’s imagination. And in addition to all the named structures and graven images, the city has been tagged with various plaques that commemorate Franklin’s various activities in the area. For example, on St. Stephen’s Church is a brass plaque which claims Ben Franklin conducted his famous kite experiment on this site in 1752.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the plaque:\n\nNow, it turns out that there’s considerable debate as to whether this is really the site of Frankin’s kite adventure. And while the “Certified” marker above the plaque would seem to lend credence to the plaque’s claim, it turns out the marker relates to the church building, and not to the plaque.\n\nA few blocks from the dubious kite claim is a bare steel pipe structure outlining where Franklin’s last family home had stood. Ben’s kids had the house razed some years after he died. But in the 1940s, archeological efforts uncovered the foundations of the house. The steel “ghost house” was erected in the 1970s, since there were insufficient records or drawings to reconstruct the house itself.\n\nFinally, and inevitably, Franklin’s body rests in Philadelphia, not far from the ghost house. He is buried at Christ Church Burial Ground under a smooth marble tablet that’s perpetually covered with a scattering of pennies from passersby.\n\nOf course, Philadelphia isn’t all Ben Franklin and Larry Fine. For example, there are these random nudes built into a pedestrian walkway. For no discernible reason.\n\nThere’s also Auguste Rodin’s bronze sculpture The Thinker on the grounds of Philadelphia’s Rodin Museum:\n\nYou probably know of this piece. Rodin actually cast a number of identical bronze Thinkers. I remember once seeing one at Stanford University. But I’ll forever associate it with Dobie Gillis, who had a habit of sitting next to the statue in a copycat pose.\n\nAnd if that’s not enough, today I also ran into some literary luminaries that you don’t often associate with Philadelphia. In the Philadelphia Free Library’s Central branch (built almost a century ago in the beau arts style) one finds a bust of Charles Dickens in the Rare Books Room.\n\nNot far from the Dickens’ bust is his actual pet bird, now stuffed and mounted in a glass box.\n\nThe bird is (was?) a raven by the name of Grip. Grip even gets some speaking lines in Dickens’ novel Barnaby Rudge. But she (for Grip is a female) also played a much more important literary role: She is said to be the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven.\n\nAs we all know, Poe lived in Philadelphia for six years. And one of his Philadelphia homes still stands. I will be visiting it on Friday, so we’ll be returning to this theme later.\n\nIt’s now getting late, but I do have two more items to share from today. The first is:\n\nOBELISK CORNER\n\nI was taking an afternoon walk through Philadelphia’s Woodlands Cemetery. It dates back to the 1840s, and has a distinctive Victorian air about it. Many of the grave markers take the form of obelisks, with some quite large specimens cropping up here and there.\n\nBut take a closer look at that one in the center. Though it doesn’t appear especially large in the photo, it’s actually about 15 stories high. In fact, it’s the largest gravestone in the Continental U.S. Let’s take a closer look:\n\nThe obelisk marks the grave of one Thomas Wiltberger Evans, who died in 1897. You never heard of him either? It seems that the man with the country’s tallest headstone was a….dentist.\n\nAnd now, let’s finish up with the\n\nBREW OF THE DAY\n\nI drank my BOTD at Manayunk Brewing Company, which sits in a cavernous, historic cotton mill on the banks of the Schuylkill River. The cotton mill dates back to 1822, and it operated (making cotton or, later, wool) until 1992. At that point it became a brewery.\n\nMy words can’t do justice to the wonderful setting. Not only is the historic building awe-inspiring, but there’s an old railroad (?) bridge crossing the river right behind the brewery. And I had a great spot in the sun to enjoy the view.\n\nI had my heart set on getting one of Manayunk’s home-made brews. But sadly, my server informed me that they lost their entire brewing setup to a flood a few years back. It seems that flooding has been a recurrent problem, judging from the “high water mark” signs in the bar.\n\nHowever, a few of their beer recipes are still being faithfully produced by local brewing partners. I selected the Schuylkill Punch, which is being brewed by Yards Brewing.\n\nThis is nothing like what I normally drink. It’s light, with a body light iced tea. There’s almost no malt. And with an ABV of 4.5 percent, it has about half the alcohol of my usual brews.\n\nBut this is an exceedingly smooth beer, and it complemented the warm weather perfectly. It’s slightly sweet, with distinct citrus notes of grapefruit, lemon, and some tropical fruits. Carbonation is low, but it has a nice head. Overall, I’d call this a “session” beer, especially if your session is outdoors on a warm day next to the Schuylkill River. I give it 3.5 stars out of five. If they could up the flavor a bit (maybe brewing it with more fruit), I’d knock it up to a solid 4.\n\nRoute 82–Bonus Features\n\nThank you all for your kind comments, recommendations, and suggestions while I was cruising Route 82. I’m now back home, planning my next journey. Meanwhile, I leave you with a few additional photos from that trip that didn’t fit into the daily blog posts. Enjoy!\n\nGotta Catch ‘Em All!\n\nToday was the day. In the course of my many, undistinguished years, I’ve visited 49 out of the 50 states in this country. I’m not sure why this is important to me, but it’s been a goal of mine for awhile. I’ve even developed a set of rules for counting the states–for example, simply changing planes at an airport does count. Neither does just passing through on an interstate. For a state to count, I need to place my feet on its soil, have a meal at a local (non-chain) restaurant, and learn something I didn’t know about the state. Even with that fairly low bar, I’ve been unable to claim that I’ve visited all 50 states.\n\nUntil today.\n\nNow, I’m sure much of this is due to serendipity, but I was struck by the contrast of yesterday’s stormy, soggy drive through Georgia, and today’s sunny, warm drive through Florida. What’s more, just a couple of minutes after I crossed the state line I was literally greeted by a smiling Floridian offering me a cup of Florida’s Natural Orange Juice (TM).\n\nI drove around the Jacksonville area for an hour or so, admiring the palm trees and the sandy beaches. As I said, the weather was pleasant and sunny, so I just kind of basked in the respite from winter.\n\nAll that was left was to have a meal at a local eatery. The breakfast I’d eaten didn’t count, because it was in Georgia. That place, by the way, was perplexing. Remember that Monty Python skit where Eric Idle goes to a travel agency and the receptionist asks if he wants to go upstairs? If not, here’s the clip:\n\nAnyway, I was thinking of Eric Idle’s experience when I walked into The Facility Coffee.The person at the counter looked at me and asked “are you shooting today?,” and when I looked puzzled she hastily added “Oh, or are you here for coffee?” It was at that moment I noticed the various firearms accessories for sale, as well as the fully-equipped firing range in the back. I’m not making this up.\n\nYou might think it’s an odd business model, to combine a coffee shop and a firing range. If so, the T-shirts they had for sale probably wouldn’t appeal to you\n\nSo when I asked for a bagel to go with my coffee, the young woman pointed to literally two lonely bagels in the case–one plain and one everything. That was it. Surely the coffee shop side of this business was a front.\n\nAnyway, that was all in Georgia. For me to be able to check off my last state I still had to eat at a local restaurant in Florida. So I stopped at the Flying Fish Taproom in Jacksonville (pop: 955,000) and ordered a burger. That task has now been completed, and I’m now able to declare that I’ve visited all 50 states. Finally I can die happy.\n\nBrew of the Day\n\nWhile at the Flying Fish Taproom I enjoyed a goblet of the Buckle Up Buckaroo Barleywine (which is, of course, not a wine but a beer). It’s clocks in with an ABV of 10.5 percent.\n\nThe Buckle Up Buckaroo has a beautiful golden honey color and a thin, foamy head. There’s almost no nose to speak of, save a very slight hint of cloves and maybe some cardamom. Overall, it appears pretty innocuous just sitting there on the table.\n\nThings get more interesting when you take a sip. The taste has something of a Belgian vibe. It’s not sweet exactly, but it kind of brushes up against the sweet receptors on your tongue, similar to when you lick the blood from a cut finger. What, you don’t find that to be an enjoyable taste?\n\nThis barleywine imparts a distinct flavor of dates, figs, and maybe a little bit of Ocean Spray Craisin. Underlying that is an earthiness that evokes spoiled milk and apple cider vinegar. This drink is light on the hops but not on the carbonation, so you get a tingle without the bitterness. The overall experience is a taste that’s not immediately gratifying, but which you nevertheless find yourself wanting more of. This is perhaps a cautionary tale in itself.\n\nBut let’s talk about the alcohol. For your average beer, 10.5 percent is a lot. But not for a barleywine, which can get as high as 13 percent. (The very term “barleywine” was invented to describe high-alcohol beers. I’d always understood this was because, in some jurisdictions and at some point in history, beers above a threshold ABV were not permitted to be called beer. Readers able to confirm or reject this theory should please comment below!) All that said, this 10-oz goblet knocked me for a loop. By the time I took the final sip I was hugging a lamp post and singing Auld Lang Syne.\n\nNow, the point of the alcohol in a beer is not just to give you a buzz. It also influences the taste and body and mouthfeel. I’d also argue that a higher-alcohol beer imparts a certain warmth, which is welcome on a winter day. It’s not for nothing that St. Bernards carried brandy to rescue snowbound travelers.\n\nBut my point is that I was unprepared for the buzz this tiny glass produced. And I’m writing this under the influence. So I’m awarding this barleywine six stars out of five."
