        "text": "Faruq Rasheed Burns was born August 31, 1972 in Hollis- Queens, New York to the late Viola Dean and John H. Burns, Jr. He was a loving husband, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and a close friend and companion.\n\nIn 1978, the Burns family moved from New York to Broomfield, Colorado to provide a better quality of life and a healthier environment to combat Faruq’s asthma. Faruq had a competitive nature and was high spirited. He channeled this passion into sports and from an early age he proved gifted in football, basketball and soccer becoming an All-Star, as well a black belt in Karate. He completed his education in the Broomfield Public School District at Witt Elementary school, Mandalay Middle school and Stanley Lake High School. His college career began at Mesa Community College in Mesa, Arizona where he earned his Associates Degree. He obtained a full football scholarship to the University of Alabama in Birmingham (UAB), where he pledged Phi Beta Sigma, studied Criminal Justice and received his bachelor’s degree.\n\nHe met his best friend, soulmate, and the love of his life Angela Marie Johnson while attending UAB. They started dating in 1995 and the couple married on June 29, 2002. Because of their inseparable love, the night before their wedding, Faruq kept calling for Angie. Eventually, their cousin took the phone saying, “she will see you tomorrow…now good night!” They have been intertwined for 26 years and spent their 19-year marriage building a home together in Denver, Colorado growing in love and devotion.\n\nUnder the guidance and ownership of their father, Faruq and his siblings operated MDJ Coating until it was dissolved in 2008. Faruq later worked with UPS in the Airport Cargo division. His free time was well spent with his family. Together they conversated about self-improvement and community empowerment. The most remarkable times were filled with singing karaoke alongside his beautiful wife. His very special relationships with his nephew Qahhar Jr. and nieces Faith and Rhiaun brought him so much joy and personal fulfillment.\n\nFaruq’s gift of unconditional love gave stability and strength to his entire family. His compassion was limitless, and he embraced anyone who needed a hand. On May 31, 2021, Faruq transitioned peacefully with his devoted wife at his side. He leaves to cherish his memory; his wife Angela Johnson Burns, Jeff Burns (uncle), Hope Burns (aunt), his Brother Qahhar, his sister Tahirah, Qahhar Jr. (nephew), Faith and Rhiaun (nieces), and a host of other relatives and friends. We will never forget Faruq’s love for life, his willingness to be the peace maker, and that extraordinary smile."
