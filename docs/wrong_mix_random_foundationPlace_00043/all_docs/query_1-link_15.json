        "text": "The Perfect Climate\n\nFamously boasting 350 days of sunshine, the climate in the Coachella Valley is influenced by the geography of the surrounding areas. There are high mountain ranges on three sides and a south-sloping valley all of these contribute to the unique and year-round warm climate of the Coachella Valley. The surrounding mountains block rainstorms from coastal areas and funnel in hot, dry air from the surrounding desert. The Coachella Valley boast the warmest winter in the Western United States with a very dry climate. The city’s low humidity, makes it an ideal climate to take in the sun and get a tan or take a tour on one of the many hiking trails in the area! The average high temperature is 89°F (32 °C) and the average annual low is 62 °F (17 °C).\n\nA Golf Mecca Was Born!\n\nThe Shadow Mountain Golf Club (1952) was the city’s first golf course and tennis club. It was followed by Marrakesh (1954), the Palm Desert Greens mobile home park golf course (1961), and the Palm Desert Country Club (1962). 1992 marked a milestone in home construction when the ambitious Del Webb development of Sun City Palm Desert began take shape. This development alone accounted for 5,000 more homes once construction finished in 2002. The overwhelming total number of golf clubs in Palm Desert (there are over 30 and they are located within 10 miles from the city) has given it a reputation as a touchstone for golfers around the world.\n\nThe city is home to some impressive attractions, including the College of the Desert, the McCallum Theatre, the Living Desert Zoo and Gardens, and the Palm Desert Civic Park (a favorite among dog owners). Residents of the city are treated to a wide array of events running all year round including the popular El Paseo Fashion Week.\n\nPalm Desert Real Estate\n\nPalm Desert homes for sale have a median price of $310,000 as of 2016. This has increased in recent years to be well over $500,000. These homes have increased in value significantly since the 2008 recession. There is a wide variety of homes available in the city for sale. Most homes are single level homes and basements in the area are a rare feature. If you are looking for the perfect community for a second or permanent home in the area, see the complete list of Golf Course and Non-Golf Course communities.\n\nPalm Desert Map\n\nPalm Desert is a centrally located city in the Coachella Valley. This beautiful city has some truly amazing golf course communities and is home to some of the largest municipal parks in the Coachella Valley. Palm Desert is an incorporated city covering 27.02 square miles within Riverside County.\n\nPalm Desert Links:\n\nhttps://www.cityofpalmdesert.org/\n\nhttps://discoverpalmdesert.com/\n\nhttps://www.mccallumtheatre.com/\n\nhttps://theshopsonelpaseo.com/\n\nhttps://www.livingdesert.org/"
