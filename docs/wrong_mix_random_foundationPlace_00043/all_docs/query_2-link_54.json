        "text": "(A vaginal birth after 2 caesareans) Baby was born in the water, read on.‚Ä¶.‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nFrom Natasha: ‚ÄúI have some news ‚Äì been meaning to message‚Ä¶I went into spontaneous labour yesterday morning and gave birth a beautiful little boy in the pool with absolutely no pain relief at the hospital by 1pm. It was the most empowering birth. I didn‚Äôt even tear. I just used my breath and out popped a baby.\n\nI can‚Äôt thank you enough for the mental strength you gave me. Things really changed for me after the Hypnobirthing course you gave. Thank you for empowering me and giving me the tools to achieve my dream birth story!\n\nI really got very lucky with the incredible people who helped me achieve this dream. Thank you for being part of it and thank you for the wonderful reflexology sessions which also massively helped.\n\nI obviously won‚Äôt be seeing you tomorrow now. (Janet: Natasha was booked in for Reflexology again with me the next dayüë£) But I look forward to staying in touch always.\n\nSending the hugest hugs. Have the most wonderful Christmas and New Year break. Xxx‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes please share my story (happy for you to add our names like our testimonial before) and if you need any more info just let me know.\n\nJust like the incredible work you have done and still doing ‚Äì I really want to empower women to believe in themselves and remember that they were built to birth and really want them to trust nature again. xx‚Äù\n\nIt is always a pleasure to work with clients on their journey towards an informed and empowered birth experience ü§©\n\nHuge congratulations to Natasha and Ben üéäüß∏üéâ who attended one of my Hypnobirthing Groups in Kendal. Thank you so much for allowing me to share your birth story, as people really need to hear positive and inspiring birth stories especially in todays medical\n\nmodel of birthing!"
