The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:38 p.m. in room SD-106, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Jeff Bingaman, chairman, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF BINGAMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO Chairman Bingaman. Now, moving on to our hearing this afternoon, I would propose to follow the same format that we used this morning. That is, that I would make a brief opening statement, Senator Murkowski would then make whatever statement he would like, we would then call upon the two Senators from Colorado and Governor Owens to introduce the nominee, and then call on Ms. Norton to make her statement. Once that is completed, we would then go to questions and have an 8-minute round of questions from each member. If there are additional questions after that first round, we will have additional rounds of questions and they will be 5 minutes each. So with that set of ground rules, let me go ahead and make a short statement. The purpose of this hearing this afternoon is to consider the nomination of Gale Norton to be the Secretary of the Interior. The office of the Secretary of the Interior is one of the highest positions of public trust in our Federal Government. The Secretary is the principal steward of nearly a third of our Nation's land. The Secretary is the chief trustee of much of the Nation's energy and mineral wealth as well. The Secretary is the principal guardian of our national parks and our most revered historic sites and much of our fish and wildlife. It is the job of the Secretary of the Interior to protect this precious legacy and to pass it on to future generations. While the President is clearly entitled to appoint Cabinet members who share his political views, the Senate has a constitutional duty to ensure that the Secretary of the Interior will be a faithful steward of the public lands and our national treasures. I have no doubt that Ms. Norton is an extremely decent and capable person, and we have many recommendations to that effect. I do have doubts about some of the policies that she has promoted and whether they are consistent with the responsibilities of the job of Secretary of the Interior. For over 20 years, she has consistently championed the interests of individuals as opposed to the public interest in many of the issues that come before this committee and before the office of the Secretary of the Interior. She has championed the rights of States as opposed to the Federal Government and the interests of economic development rather than environmental protection in many cases. These positions may have been understandable for a lawyer representing her clients. They certainly may have been understandable for an attorney general of a Western State, and I have some experience in that regard. They may have been understandable for a Republican Senate candidate. But some of those positions are disturbing, at least to my mind, in a nominee for Secretary of the Interior. This hearing will afford Ms. Norton the opportunity to state her views on the role of the Secretary of the Interior, explain how she can reconcile her past positions with the responsibilities that she would have entrusted to her in this new position. Her answers to these questions will determine how I am able to vote on this nomination. Senator Murkowski. STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK H. MURKOWSKI, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Murkowski. Thank you very much, Chairman Bingaman. I want to commend you and your staff, working with our staff, for the structure of this hearing. I think that with the testimony that we are going to hear we are going to be able to answer many of the questions that we have relative to this nominee. I want to commend our President-elect Bush for nominating the first woman, the first woman for the Secretary of the Interior. I think it is an outstanding nomination of a candidate who has certainly the knowledge, the experience, to take on one of the most challenging positions in the Executive Branch. Her responsibility is one in my opinion of balance. She is going to have to balance the protection of our Nation's resources with the realism that we need to develop those resources using the best technology available. I think one of the themes that have been suggested is using the fuels of today to get to the technology of tomorrow. Now, this is a balance in my opinion that has swung dramatically out of proportion in the last 8 years, as evidenced by the energy crisis that is existing in this country today, more particularly in the State of California, where as a matter of fact to some extent the lights are out. Now, I have heard criticism that Ms. Norton has been identified with groups that advocate such things as more complete appreciation of the economic consequences of governmental action or a better understanding of the balance provided by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. The issue of the power of the Federal Government vis-a-vis the States has always been a contentious issue and it is not going to go away. But there has always been room for diversity and debate in the marketplace of ideas, and that includes the Department of the Interior. Did his work as president of the League of Conservation Voters disqualify the previous Secretary, Bruce Babbitt? Did George Frampton's lobbying for and his position as head of the Wilderness Society disqualify him? No. They both had strong advocacies for their point of view. I guess it depends on whether you happen to agree with their point of view. So it is a question of balance. Now, those on the ideological side of the current protesters are going to be heard through, I think, various members of this committee. Ms. Norton has been accused only of guilt by association, has been tarred with innuendoes and brushed with, I think, misinterpretation. Well, today let us look at the record and proceed with this nomination hearing. You know, this committee has had a long history of asking tough questions on policy issues and avoiding character assassination, and I know this tradition can continue. Senator Bingaman and I have worked closely together during the time I was chairman and a day and a half or so. We will continue to work closely together when I resume that responsibility, assuming my colleagues on the right are of that particular disposition. And if they are not, we can talk later--no, I did not mean that. [Laughter.] Now, I do not think the implication of the Natural Resource Defense Council that Gale Norton is an anarchist should have any place in this society. On the other hand, caution is in order. We need the balance, as I have stated. I often recall with some amusement when the so-called ``cell phone naturalist'' drives his or her sports utility vehicle into the national forest. He calls home on his cell phone, looks for direction from his global positioning system, checks the time on his watch. As he communes, I guess, with nature, he makes the decision there and then that no mining, no energy development, should ever take place in this spot. He ignores the fact that each person in this Nation uses about 22,000 pounds of non-energy minerals each day and those minerals must come, they must come from somewhere. We look at the timber resources, which is renewable. Do we want them to come from the rain forests of South America, where there is very little environmental control, or do we want to bring it along on a renewable basis from our own forests in this country, where we can do it right with the regeneration process? At the same time, the beauty that this so-called, I guess, cell phone naturalist recognizes, we have to have a realistic claim on protection for future generations. So again, it is a question of balance. Balance is the key in my opinion at the Department of the Interior, and I think Ms. Norton will provide that balance. The Secretary is responsible for our public domain, the public lands that support the wilderness, recreation, grazing, forestry, mining, oil, gas development, and many, many other uses as well. If we are going to deal honestly with our energy situation, we will need carefully to examine the process for granting right of ways. How can you generate more energy sources if you do not have right of ways? The same can be said for transmission corridors and the needs for rural communities for access. Unlike the various interest groups who have the luxury of advocating only one position, the Secretary has been given the mandate to balance those needs and be a steward of the land on behalf of all Americans, not just special interest groups. As a consequence, I think we would all agree that the Secretary has trust responsibilities as well. They go into the Indian tribes. Very frankly, the record there is not a very good one. The management of the trust funds in my opinion has been a disaster. Activities under the mining laws, the Mineral Leasing Act, the outer continental shelf, will all come under her direction. We have the capability to develop the vast supplies of oil and gas in this Nation in an environmentally sensitive manner and we should do so. What is not being given credibility is the advanced technology that we have been able to develop as we, if you will, evaluate the risks associated with that development. I am reminded in my own State of Alaska about 15 years ago we brought in the tenth largest field and we used 56 acres. It was called Endicott. It was the technology of 15 to 20 years ago. Given the opportunity, because of our increased dependence on imported oil, which is about 57 percent and the Department of Energy indicated this morning it would be up to 62 percent within the next 4 years, we have an opportunity to open up a portion of the coastal plain. That is 19 million acres up there, an area the size of the State of South Carolina. Yet industry tells us that, if the oil is there, the footprint is 2,000 acres. That is what is lacking in the consideration in my opinion by the environmental community as we look at our ability, by using the technology, to open up our resources in an appropriate manner. Now, as Secretary you are going to have the responsibility for the U.S. territories. Many people overlook that, but we cannot on this committee because we are the committee of oversight. Our record is not very good there. The Virgin Islands are on the edge of bankruptcy. American Samoa is surviving only by borrowing against its portion of the tobacco settlement. The Northern Mariana Islands has an economy that has been allowed to become totally dependent on an immigration and labor situation that simply should not exist under the American flag, and to a large degree it is ignored. Senator Akaka and I have worked very hard on that. We have been over there and observed that situation, and I can tell you it is despicable. All of these areas require an openness and a willingness to undertake the balance necessary to provide for the needs of this and future generations. I am confident that she will carefully enforce the laws and work with the Congress and particularly this committee. On a personal note, Ms. Norton has been to Alaska on several occasions and that is several more times than some of the self-appointed experts who want to manage my State. She knows what the effect of decisions made in Washington can be on local economies and how dependent those economies are on the Federal estate. She has, I think, a distinguished record of public service and the respect of those she has dealt with as well. She has also had a record of openness and being directly involved in decisions. I am certainly pleased to support her nomination. Mr. Chairman, I would like to add for the record the names of 12 governors supporting her nomination: the Governors of Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Texas, North Dakota, Nevada, and Montana, as well as Colorado. I thank the chair. Chairman Bingaman. We now have our two distinguished colleagues from Colorado here to introduce the nominee, as well as the Governor of Colorado. So first I will call on Senator Campbell. STATEMENT OF HON. BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO Senator Campbell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a member of this committee, I am honored and pleased to be introducing my friend and my colleague of many years, my fellow---- Senator Murkowski. Would you pull that mike up a little bit, Senator Campbell. Senator Campbell. Sorry. I am pleased to introduce my friend and colleague Gale Norton from Colorado. She is overwhelmingly qualified and the absolute right person for the Secretary of the Interior post. I have known Gale, as all of us have here at this table, for many years and let me state right up front and for the record, she has a long and distinguished record of doing the right thing always. She is a consensus builder, which might just be illustrated by her 8 years as Colorado's Attorney General, where she served under a Democratic governor and still accomplished many initiatives for the betterment of Colorado, including Superfund cleanups. For more than 20 years, she has provided leadership on environmental and public lands issues and has demonstrated a responsible, common sense approach in preserving our natural heritage. In my view, in fact, she is being accused now, as you probably read in the newspapers, of being not centrist enough. But I liken that to the current administration, which has in the last few years advocated tearing down dams. I think if you went to California now and talked to the people who are closing their factories and the lights are shut off in their restaurants and they cannot see the stoplights because they are out on the corners and so on and you talk to them and said, is tearing down the energy-producing dams a centrist view, they would probably say not so and they would agree much more with Gale Norton, who believes in the careful production of energy. Another significant fact to know about Gale Norton is that she is committed to enforcing the law as it is written and not by rule and regulation. As Attorney General of Colorado, she created an environmental crimes task force to prosecute the most flagrant polluters. She has played a leading role in the cleanup of pollution at mining sites to protect the environment and restore Colorado's natural resources, and she led the way in ensuring a safe cleanup of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, personally arguing and winning a landmark case in court to force the Federal Government and an oil company to meet Colorado standards for environmental protection and public health, which in many cases are more stringent than Federal standards. Gale Norton believes that everyone has a role to play in defending and preserving our environment. Businesses and communities, government and people, all need to have a seat at the table. As you know, in the last couple days nine more large tracts of land have been locked up in the West without any local input whatsoever. Gale believes that local people should be involved in decisionmaking and that their lifestyle that is often dependent on those public lands should be considered. As a researcher at Stanford University, Ms. Norton researched emissions trading approaches like those later adopted in the Clean Air Act. These approaches created market- based incentives for businesses to reduce emissions. Gale Norton supported the Colorado audit law, a law which was co- sponsored by several Democrats and signed by a Democratic governor, to achieve better environmental protection by encouraging early and full identification of environmental problems and, most important, long-term decisions. Another issue which is important to many of the members on this committee since they come from public lands States in the West is that of water rights. Gale Norton has championed Western water rights over the years. Growing populations and changing values are placing increasing demands on our existing and limited water supplies in the West, resulting in water use conflicts throughout the country. Recent conflicts are particularly apparent out where we live, where agriculture needs for water are often in direct conflict with urban needs, like the demand for water for the Endangered Species Act, for recreation and picturesque scenery. In the arid West, naturally scarce water supplies and growing urban populations have increased Federal-State tensions because States have historically had primacy in interstate water allocation. Debate over Western water centers around the issue of how best to plan for and manage the use of this limited resource. I believe that Gale Norton will be able to use her background in water issues to build a consensus and start settling some of the disputes on water. She was one of the first and early advocates of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, commonly called the ALP, which you, Chairman Bingaman, and I both supported over the years. As the past chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee and I suppose the next chairman in a few more days again, I believe that Gale will effectively manage Indian affairs with the Department of the Interior, which it has responsibility for. During her 8-year tenure as Colorado's Attorney General, Gale Norton developed a strong working relationship with Colorado's two tribes, the Ute Mountain Tribe and the Southern Ute Tribe. Together they worked on a number of important matters, including water rights settlements and environmental regulation, taxation, and a whole bunch of other complex issues. In fact, she testified a number of times before our committee. She is very knowledgeable in Indian law and she will bring that knowledge and experience of working with the tribes to the Department, and I am confident that she will continue that work. I have two letters I would ask unanimous consent, from the Ute Mountain Indian Tribe and the Southern Ute Tribe supporting her nomination, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bingaman. We will include those in the record. Senator Campbell. Mr. Chairman, Senator Murkowski mentioned the trust fund debacle over there at the Interior Department. All of us on this committee are aware that there is $2.5 billion of missing money in the Bureau of Indian Affairs accounts that they say is there but nobody can find it. She has made that a priority, to try to straighten that up and make sure the people who actually own that money, the individual Indians living on trust land, will receive their just dues. Mr. Chairman, the Ute Tribes strongly support her, but in talking with other tribes around the country, they also do. All the ones I have talked to also support her. She listens to common sense while she searches for common ground. Unlike many in Washington, she understands that real environmental solutions seldom come just from the Beltway professionals. They come from real people with honest concerns for the land and the water, people on the ground dealing with those concerns on a daily basis. She will insist that the Federal Government work with local communities to find the best way to preserve and protect our Nation's natural resources. I am pleased to say that Gale Norton has my full support and will make an outstanding Secretary of the Interior. Frankly, I am a little disturbed about the opposition. I saw this morning's Washington Post, as you probably did, with a full page ad taken out by some of the extreme environmental community, where they have half of her face on the page and half of her face off of the page. I know that it seems to be in vogue now to disagree with the nominees by embarking on some form of character assassination. But I would compare that senseless business in the Post this morning with the very thoughtful and carefully written editorial by our colleague John Breaux, who is a man that I think everybody in this body supports, who basically says in his editorial that she is a good person for the job and should be supported. Those shrill voices of the extreme elements of our society we are hearing now in the current process of confirming our nominees, I think they have very limited perspectives and make up in shrillness what they lack in common sense in my view. Mr. Chairman, as a member of this committee I offer my support once again to Gale Norton, and I thank you. Chairman Bingaman. Thank you very much. Senator Allard. STATEMENT OF HON. WAYNE ALLARD, U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO Senator Allard. Mr. Chairman, it is an honor for me to be here to be able to introduce to you Gale Norton, Secretary- designate for the Department of the Interior. I have known Gale Norton for some time. I consider her to be a very close friend. She is a great Coloradoan. She was born and educated in the State of Colorado. Today she enjoys many of the natural resources we have in our great State. I want to take a few moments to talk about her resume. As you might imagine, she has a long one. So what I have done is I have selected those parts of her resume which I think is very important to the committee's deliberation today as they consider her nomination by the President for Secretary of the Interior. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Denver in 1975. Then she went on to graduate from the College of Law with a juris doctor degree in 1978. She is a member of the Law School Honor Society. She moved forward from that point with her academic credentials to become a part of the faculty of the University of Denver. She is truly an academician. She knows how to evaluate issues, she knows how to talk about the pros and cons of various issues that may come before her. Because of this strong academic background, she was frequently called upon to give speeches and to talk to groups in Colorado and across the country on issues that were important to them in which she was considered an expert. She went on from the University of Colorado to serve as a law clerk for the Colorado Court of Appeals. In the 1980's she decided to come to Washington and she worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and then moved over to the Department of the Interior as Associate Solicitor for Conservation and Wildlife. Then she returned back to Colorado, she ran for public office and was elected by the people of Colorado to serve as their Attorney General. She served from 1991 to 1999 as Colorado's Attorney General. The point that I would like to make to the committee is that Gale Norton has had a broad experience in her life. It includes her having to walk in many of the shoes of somebody who has worked for a Federal agency here in Washington in the Department of Agriculture, as well as in the Department of the Interior. She has had to walk in the shoes of the State from which she was born and educated and representing many of her constituents as the Attorney General of the State of Colorado. I think that when we look at her academic background, we look at her experience both at the Federal level and at the State level, I think she is uniquely qualified to be the next Secretary of the Interior and I strongly endorse her, because I think her total of 20 years of experience on environmental and natural resource issues will make her a great Secretary of the Department of the Interior. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bingaman. Thank you very much. We are honored to have Governor Bill Owens from Colorado here also to introduce the nominee. Please go right ahead. STATEMENT OF HON. BILL OWENS, GOVERNOR, STATE OF COLORADO Governor Owens. Senator Bingaman, thank you very much. members of the committee, thank you for allowing me to say a few words on behalf of Gale Norton. It is good to be back in the Senate. Years ago, 25 years ago, I served on the staff of Senator John Tower, and I regret to this day what happened to him, to that fine American, during his Senate confirmation. Years before that I served with Jim Wright. I was Jim Wright's page in the House of Representatives. I have a lot of respect for what it is you are charged with doing this afternoon. I guess what I really hope is that we do not take this fine person and tear her apart through this process, because I know Gale Norton, I have worked with her, I have known her for 15 years, and this is a dedicated public servant who has always done what she thought was best for the people of Colorado. I am going to not be redundant to what my friends Senator Campbell and Senator Allard have already said. You have heard about her distinguished 8-year career as Attorney General. You know, when you are looking to see where Gale Norton comes from it is important to note that she was elected in 1990 in a landslide as a Republican in the same year that Governor Roy Roemer was re-elected by a landslide as a Democrat in Colorado. The same thing occurred in 1994. Gale Norton won in a landslide on the Republican side, Roy Roemer won in a landslide on the Democratic side. It is because Colorado is a centrist State. It votes for the person, not the party. In voting for Gale Norton, it was voting for a person who really represented the mainstream that I think is the reality of Colorado. You are going to hear a lot today about a number of issues. Just from a Colorado perspective, we have a self-audit law in the State of Colorado, as do 29 other States in this Union. In Colorado this law passed, for reference purposes, by a vote of 60 to 4 in our House of Representatives, obviously bipartisan; it passed our Senate by a vote of 24 to 8, again clearly bipartisan; was then signed into law by Governor Roy Roemer. It was Gale Norton's job as Attorney General to defend that Colorado law in court, a defense which she performed admirably. But that law was a bipartisan law, a well-intentioned and I believe successful effort to bring more companies into a partnership in terms of cleaning up the environment. Again, today it has been copied throughout these United States. You are going to hear about a mine called Summitville. Summitville is a disaster which we are all familiar with in Colorado. Just let the record reflect that that mine was cited in 1983 under the administration of my very good friend Governor Dick Lamb. The environmental failure occurred in 1986. Gale Norton was elected in 1990. She took office in 1991. She sued the owner of Summitville in 1992, sued the owner again to keep the mine filtering system open when that owner declared bankruptcy, sued the personal owner of that mine in 1996, and 3 weeks ago the current Attorney General, Ken Salazar of Colorado, a Democrat, was able to settle with that owner for almost $30 million based on the work that he did and based on the work that Gale Norton did. That is one reason I believe that Ken Salazar, our Democratic Attorney General in Colorado, along with four other Democratic attorney generals, has endorsed Gale's nomination. I am so proud of what she did with Rocky Mountain Arsenal. This is a chemical warfare plant that we have just outside of the Denver metropolitan area. She sued the Federal Government to force a cleaner standard, a higher standard of cleanup, actually to force the Federal Government to follow Colorado's standard rather than Federal standards for the cleanup of that site, and she won that lawsuit. In suing the Federal Government, she also sued Shell Oil Company. She has done the same thing with Rocky Flats, our nuclear bomb factory, which also is right outside Denver, Colorado. She has gone to court to allow individuals to sue the Federal Government under the Superfund Act. This is a lady that is moderate and centrist and has worked hard for our environment in Colorado and I know would do an outstanding job as Secretary of the Interior. One final issue that I know you are going to hear about. It concerns a legal case called the Adderand case in the State of Colorado. It is a case involving minority set-asides and involving a lawsuit against the State of Colorado by a gentleman named Adderand. Colorado had in place a set of required mandatory set-asides for construction projects. Over the years the Supreme Court had successively weakened its standard and in fact made it clear that our Adderand case was indefensible in court based on Supreme Court dicta. So there was an attempt in Colorado to pursue this case to higher courts. Our Governor, Governor Roy Roemer, wanted to pursue the appeals higher. Gale Norton as an attorney and as Attorney General said, we are going to lose if we do so. I know that, Senator Bingaman, you have been an attorney general and I know we have a former governor, Mr. Bayh, Senator Bayh. She said to her client: We cannot win this case and we should not pursue it. Under Colorado law, the Governor had the right to pursue it and did so by retaining outside counsel, a former Supreme Court justice, and we lost twice in the U.S. Supreme Court. She was fulfilling her oath as an attorney and as Attorney General of Colorado in terms of following what the Supreme Court had told us was legal. So gentlemen, I really appreciate your courtesy in allowing a Governor to speak to you today. I am telling you that Colorado is proud of Gale Norton. As a State senator, I voted on 266 of Governor Roemer's appointees in my 6 years in the State senate. I voted for 264 of that Governor's appointees. I understand the constitutional responsibility you have to advise and consent. I just ask you to, as I know you will, Mr. Chairman, give this lady a fair hearing. As you do so, I am confident she will be confirmed. Thank you very much. Chairman Bingaman. Thank you for your statement. Thank all three of you for your statements. Ms. Norton, I am required to administer the oath to you. But before I do so, did you have family members you wanted to introduce before we went through that formality? Ms. Norton. Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce my husband, John Hughes. Chairman Bingaman. We welcome him to the committee. [Applause.] Chairman Bingaman. The rules of the committee which apply to all nominees require that the nominee be sworn in connection with her testimony. Could you please rise and raise your right hand, please. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Ms. Norton. I do. Chairman Bingaman. Thank you. Why don't you be seated. Let me ask you three questions. Will you be available to appear before this committee and other congressional committees to represent departmental positions and respond to issues of concern to the Congress if you are confirmed? Ms. Norton. Yes, I will be. Chairman Bingaman. Are you aware of any personal holdings, investments, or interests that could constitute a conflict or create the appearance of such a conflict should you be confirmed and assume the office to which you have been nominated by the President? Ms. Norton. I have worked with the Office of Government Ethics to review my finances. We have determined that there is one company in which I own stock, that I will divest and so that will not be a continuing conflict. I have also taken additional steps to ensure that appearances of conflict are alleviated. For example, I had a tax-sheltered annuity that was established when I worked with Mountain States Legal Foundation. I will be moving that into another program so there is absolutely no connection with the foundation. Chairman Bingaman. The final question: Are you involved or do you have any assets held in blind trusts? Ms. Norton. No, sir, I do not. Chairman Bingaman. Why don't you go ahead with your statement, then. Thank you. TESTIMONY OF GALE NORTON, NOMINEE TO BE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the committee. I am honored to appear before you today as President-elect Bush's nominee for Secretary of the Interior. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with you and to answer any questions that you might have. I am glad to have this chance to tell you something about the goals that President-elect Bush and I share and which we hope to achieve if you see fit to confirm me as Secretary of the Interior. As you all know, America is a land of singular beauty. Americans are proud of the many exquisite natural treasures within our shores. President-elect Bush believes, as I do, that the top priority of the Department of the Interior must be to conserve those natural treasures. One of President-elect Bush's priorities is to protect our National Park System. We plan to return scientists to our parks and to work with Congress to eliminate the major maintenance backlogs that have been obstacles to resource protection, and to do that within 5 years. This initiative would help restore our national parks and ensure a positive legacy of protecting our cultural, natural, and recreational treasures for Americans today and in the future. The great wild places and unspoiled landscapes of this country are the common heritage of all Americans and we must both conserve them and manage them for Americans living today and for the Americans of the future, our children and our children's children. That is our goal. I don't think any of us here today would disagree on that goal. In that I believe lies the basis for common ground. We have the opportunity for bipartisan environmental cooperation and leadership. I have worked for more than 20 years on environmental issues. I am proud of my accomplishments: preserving endangered species, cleaning out mountain valleys polluted by mining, working to convert the Rocky Mountain Arsenal from a place polluted by pesticides and nerve gas residues to a wildlife refuge. Based on these experiences, I am firmly committed to a process of consultation and collaboration. We should listen to all voices and involve all citizens. That is fair. It is also wise. People are a magnificent resource for ideas, for knowledge, for insights. I've lived and worked here in Washington. I've also lived and worked in the great American West. Those of us here in Washington need to be good partners with the Americans living in other parts of this country and in our territories. America is a stronger Nation because of the diversity of its people. These people hold many different views and perspectives. We need to work with them, to involve them, to benefit from their creativity and their capacity to innovate. One top priority that I want to mention to you today concerns the special responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior with regard to American Indians. I think we should all recognize that the situation in Indian country is not as it should be. There is much that I believe we can do, in partnership with our Nation's proud Native American tribes, to improve conditions and provide a more hopeful future. President-elect Bush has said many times that he will leave no child behind. To accomplish that requires that we improve the schools that serve more than 50,000 Native American children. A good education is the key to a better life for any child, whether that child lives in Washington, D.C., or Miami, Florida, or on a reservation in New Mexico. Recognizing the historic relationship of the Federal Government and Native American tribal governments, I will work very hard to achieve real results for every Indian child. President-elect Bush has proposals to build conservation partnerships, to help States, local communities, and private landowners to conserve wildlife habitat, watersheds, and open space. I am excited by the chance to work together on these proposals. Working together, there is much that we can do to promote conservation in the United States. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I will be candid in telling you that I am both a conservative and a conservationist. I see no conflict there. In fact, I am a compassionate conservative and a passionate conservationist. I believe that too is entirely consistent. If confirmed as Secretary of the Interior, I intend to make the conservation of America's natural resources my top priority. Using consultation and collaboration, forging partnerships with interested citizens, we can succeed in our effort to conserve America's most precious places. What is more, we can achieve this while maintaining America's prosperity and economic dynamism, while respecting constitutional rights and nurturing diverse traditions and cultures. It won't always be easy. It will require a lot of hard work and a willingness to be creative, to think outside the usual boxes. That is the mission that President-elect Bush has asked me to undertake. With your help, your wisdom, and your cooperation, I believe that we can succeed. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Norton follows:] Prepared Statement of Gale Norton, Nominee to be Secretary of the Department of the Interior Thank you very much Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the Committee. I am honored to appear before you today as President-elect Bush's nominee to be Secretary of the Interior. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with you and to answer your questions. And I'm glad to have this chance to tell you a little about the goals that President-elect Bush and I hope to achieve should you see fit to confirm me as Secretary of the Interior. As you all know, America is a land of singular beauty. Americans are proud of the many exquisite natural treasures we have within our shores. President-elect Bush believes, as I do, that the top priority of the Department of the Interior must be to conserve those natural treasures. One of President-Elect Bush's priorities is to protect our National Park System, return scientists to the parks, and work with Congress to eliminate the major maintenance and resource protection backlog within five years. This initiative would help restore our national parks and ensure a positive legacy of protecting our cultural, natural and recreational resources for Americans today and in the future. The great wild places and unspoiled landscapes of this country are the common heritage of all Americans, and we must both conserve them and manage them for Americans living today, and for Americans of the future--our children and our children's children. That is the goal. And I don't think any of us here would disagree with that goal. In that, I believe, lies the basis for common ground and, yes, for bipartisan environmental cooperation and leadership. Let me tell you a little about how I think we can best achieve this common goal. I have worked for more than 20 years on environmental issues. As Attorney General, I involved local communities, as well as State and federal officials, in the cleanup of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and the Leadville Superfund site. Our enforcement actions ranged from government sites to private mining interests, utility plants and water exploration. As Associate Solicitor, one of my proudest accomplishments was helping keep the California condor from becoming extinct. Based on these experiences, I am firmly committed to a process of consultation and collaboration. We should listen to all voices and involve all citizens in decision-making because that is fair. But we also should listen because that is wise. People are a magnificent resource--for ideas, for knowledge, for insights. I have lived and worked here in Washington. I have lived and worked in the great American West. Those of us here in Washington need to be good partners with Americans living in other parts of the United States and its territories. America is a stronger nation because of the diversity of its people. Those people hold many different views and perspectives. We need to work with them, to involve them, to benefit from their creativity and capacity to innovate. This approach, I would submit to you, is a fundamentally democratic approach--and it is the approach that I favor, and the approach I will adopt if I am confirmed as Secretary of the Interior. I also intend to take a ``performance-focused'' approach. It is not enough for the Federal government to have good intentions--we need to measure outcomes and, when necessary, correct our course so that we get where we aim to go. To help in this regard, I intend to use as fully as possible the new technologies available to us; to employ the new digital tools, to implement ``e-government'' effectively as a means to encourage public participation, to make the Department of the Interior more open and more accessible. Another top priority I want to mention to you today concerns the special responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior with regard to American Indians. I think we all recognize that the situation in Indian Country is not what it should be. There is much that I believe we can do, in partnership with our nation's proud Native American tribes, to improve conditions and create a more hopeful future. President-elect Bush has said many times that he will ``leave no child behind.'' To accomplish that requires that we improve the schools that serve more than 50,000 elementary and secondary Native American students, and increase the educational opportunities available to Indian children. A good education is the key to a better life for any child--whether that child lives in Washington D.C., Miami, Florida, or on a reservation in New Mexico. Recognizing the historic relationship of the Federal government and individual Native American tribal governments, I am convinced we can do better in this sphere. Indeed, we must do better. With your help and cooperation, I will work very hard to achieve real results for all the children of Indian country. In addition, I am looking forward to working with the talented men and women who keep the Department of the Interior going from one administration to the next, regardless of which party is in the White House. I want to open the Department's doors of opportunity to all Americans who have the skills and the drive to participate in this great mission of conservation. President-Elect Bush has proposals to build conservation partnerships--to help states, local communities and private landowners to conserve wildlife habitat, watersheds and open space. Working together, there is much we can do to promote conservation in the United States. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I will be candid in telling you that I am both a conservative and a conservationist. I see no conflict there. In fact, I am also a compassionate conservative--and a passionate conservationist. I believe that, too, is entirely consistent. As I said when I began my remarks, if confirmed as Secretary of the Interior I intend to make the conservation of America's natural treasures my top priority. Utilizing the approach I have outlined--consultation and collaboration, forging partnerships with all interested citizens and groups including, not least, those most affected by Federal decisions-- we can succeed in our effort to conserve America's most precious places. What's more, we can achieve this while maintaining America's prosperity and economic dynamism, while respecting constitutional rights, and diverse traditions and values. It won't always be easy. It will require a lot of hard work and the willingness to be creative, to think outside the usual boxes. But this is the mission that President-elect Bush has asked me to undertake. And with your help and your wisdom and your cooperation, I believe we can succeed. Years ago, the eminent environmentalist, biologist and Pulitzer Prize-winner, Rene Dubos, advised us to ``think globally, act locally.'' I think that is still good advice. Let me leave you with one additional thought from Rene Dubos which, I believe also is relevant to us and to our mission today: ``We cannot escape from the past,'' Dubos said, ``but neither can we avoid inventing the future. ``With our knowledge and a sense of responsibility for the welfare of humankind and the Earth, we can create new environments that are ecologically sound, aesthetically satisfying, economically rewarding, and favorable to the continued growth of civilization. ``But the wooing of the Earth will have a lastingly successful outcome only if we create conditions in which both humankind and the Earth retain the essence of their wildness.'' Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you distinguished Members of the Committee. Chairman Bingaman. Thank you very much. Let me start with some questions. Your statement about your priorities is welcome and I certainly heard that with great interest. A few years ago, according to a writing that you did, you described yourself as ``a free market conservative, an advocate of judicial restraint, as well as a champion of States' rights.'' Over the years you have taken some positions on the Takings Clause, for example, on the Federal taxing power, on the Tenth Amendment, on the now long discredited theory about economic due process, which seem, at least as I read some of those earlier writings of yours, to be at odds with mainstream legal thought. Can you give this committee assurance that, if confirmed, you would feel comfortable enforcing the existing laws and regulations of the Department of the Interior as they now stand? Ms. Norton. Mr. Chairman, I have served 8 years in the capacity of a State Attorney General, enforcing the laws of Colorado and of the United States. I feel very comfortable in enforcing the laws as they are written. I will be fully committed to ensuring that our Nation's environmental laws and laws for the protection of natural resources will be fully enforced. Chairman Bingaman. Many of the Republican members of Congress, some on this committee, have been sharply critical of the environmental initiatives and policies of Secretary Babbitt and of President Clinton and his administration. Which, if any, of those legal or policy positions that have been adopted by the Department of the Interior during this last 8 years would you depart from or attempt to change? Ms. Norton. There are many things that have been adopted over the past few years. We will be looking at what needs to be changed in our views and at the many things that will remain the same. We will examine issues across the board and apply the best legal standards, as well as the views that I believe many of us would share, to ensure that we are doing the best to preserve our natural resources. At this point I am not sure where we may depart from the past administration, but we will carefully examine those things and work with this Congress in order to examine issues. Chairman Bingaman. One issue that the President and the Secretary of the Interior, the current Secretary of the Interior, have been roundly criticized about by Republicans here in the Congress is this issue of designation of national monuments. I believe this President has designated 19 areas as national monuments under the authority that he has under the Antiquities Act. Do you believe that President Clinton's use of that Antiquities Act was appropriate or not? Ms. Norton. The goal of preserving lands is an admirable goal and I share the goal of trying to be sure that we are identifying those areas that ought to be natural treasures and setting those aside. The process in which those decisions were made is one that causes me concern. Many of those decisions were made through a top-down process, without consulting the people who are most affected by those decisions. President-elect Bush has established his view, and I certainly share that, that decisions about the land should be made in a process that includes the people who are affected by those decisions. I would certainly hope that in the future we would hear input from those of you on this committee, from governors, from local communities, before we take actions that are going to deeply impact people's lives. Chairman Bingaman. Would you advocate a repeal of the Antiquities Act or some changes in that basic statute? Ms. Norton. The Antiquities Act is something that has been very useful in the past. It has shown its ability to preserve some of our most important national monuments. I would like to see a process of involvement of the people most affected by decisions. That certainly would be the practice that would be followed in a Bush administration if I am selected to be Secretary of the Interior. Whether that would require changes in that statute for the long term is a decision that I have not made in terms of what we would advocate and obviously would require congressional action in order to make any of those changes. Chairman Bingaman. On this issue of water rights, do you agree that when the Federal Government reserves land from the public domain that it also impliedly reserves a sufficient quantity of water to fulfill the primary purposes of the land that it has reserved, thereby creating a Federal reserved water right? Ms. Norton. The U.S. Supreme Court has established clear standards for determining whether a Federal reserved water right is established with any particular reservation, and it depends on an examination of each particular area and the purposes for that. What it boils down to at the core is the intent of Congress and whether Congress intended when it set aside some land or whether in a presidential proclamation setting aside land the purpose of that proclamation, whether the intent of Congress or the President was to create a reserved water right. That is a decision that needs to be made on a case by case evaluation for each particular reservation. Chairman Bingaman. In the case of areas designated as wilderness, do you have a general view as to whether a reserved, implied Federal reserved water right is intended to be created with the designation of an area as wilderness? Ms. Norton. Obviously, it is important for us to preserve wilderness areas and to be sure that those wilderness areas are able to preserve the values that we want to see. One of the issues that I will need to address as Secretary of the Interior if I am confirmed is exactly that issue of water rights in wilderness areas. As you know, the Idaho Supreme Court recently held that Congress did not intend to set aside water rights when it created wilderness areas. So that decision will be coming up for review. I will carefully study that and work with the Department of Justice. Of course, it is their decision as to what position the United States will take. I will work with them to evaluate that case and determine what the course of action should be following from that. Chairman Bingaman. My time is up. Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski. Thank you very much, Chairman Bingaman. Again, Ms. Norton, let me welcome you to the committee. I was particularly pleased that you chose to mention the plight of the American Indian reservation and the manner in which the Department of the Interior has handled its responsibilities. I would encourage you to evaluate the system within the Department of the Interior, and recognizing that there is a great deal of technology and expertise to be contracted for, as opposed to trying to maintain a function that a trust department or a notarized public accounting firm would guide you into expert procedure for reporting back to the individual Native tribes, because it is an unbelievable set of circumstances. I would also call your attention, as I indicated in my opening statement, to the plight of some of our territories that are going to require your attention. The Virgin Islands, I hope, Chairman Bingaman, that we can take some of the members down there and see the difficulty and the debt load that those folks are under and their inability to have any realistic relief other than the reality that we are going to have to recognize some debt forgiveness and try and help them restructure. It is a tragedy that has been overlooked. The same is true in American Samoa. I have been out there and these are territories that we have simply ignored. You are going to have to bring together, I think, in order to develop a policy that the President-elect George W. Bush has indicated relative to the energy situation in this country. We have lacked a cohesive policy. We have lacked a direction, and I think partially due to a management style. You know, you have got the Department of the Interior that controls land, controls access. Then you have got the Environmental Protection Agency that is concerned, as they should be, with air quality and environmental sensitivities. Then you have got, say, the Department of Energy. In many cases, the Secretaries have been going different ways, as opposed to coming together and saying, all right, within the administration we're going to have to address this crisis. As we look at the hearing that we held this morning, a good deal of discussion was on California and the fact that the lights are about out, people are getting stuck in elevators, traffic lights don't work, and revolving blackouts, which suggests we're going to have to do something about the problem, that somebody is going to have to make some decisions. That's why I had mentioned a great deal of effort's going to have to go into balancing this process. Do you feel that you can bring together within this new administration the wherewithal and the policymakers to resolve and make some decisions about how we're going to relieve our dependence on imports, 56 percent, going up to, we heard this morning, 62 by the year 2004? Our greatest source seems to be coming now from Saddam Hussein. We fought a war in 1992. We lost 197 lives. We cannot address what to do with our nuclear wastes. Oil prices continue to go up. We're looking towards natural gas now. We're using it faster than we're finding it. You're going to have to come up with some of these answers with your collective colleagues. How do you propose to do it? Ms. Norton. The issues of Americans' being so dependent on foreign oil is obviously a great cause for concern. The idea that people in California this very day are facing serious shortages of energy is another great cause of concern. We will have to pull together all of our resources and work across departmental lines to find ways of addressing those issues. Obviously, it's going to be difficult to find short-term answers. We'll have to do a lot of planning to be able to find long-term answers. We would hope to work with you to find the right kinds of solutions that would balance environmental protection as well as finding ways of providing the kind of energy resources that need to be available. Senator Murkowski. I think it's appropriate that I bring up the issue of ANWR because some would be disappointed if I didn't. In any event, many members of our environmental community have opposed your nomination because of the President-elect's position on environmentally responsible oil and gas exploration in that small portion of the Arctic coastal plain in my State of Alaska. However, the reality is you nor the President currently has the authority to open up this area. Only Congress has that authority. In this regard I have two questions for you. If Congress is to undertake the debate on this issue, will you commit to aid those debates with the very best science available from the Department of the Interior? Ms. Norton. Absolutely. I view the role of the Department of the Interior as helping provide the information to this Congress so that you can make an informed decision. We hope to look at the issues of how we can provide the best scientific evaluation of the environmental consequences, how we can do any exploration and production, if it is done, in the absolute most environmentally conscious way that we can have that happen. Senator Murkowski. My second question is, if Congress approves a measure to allow exploration and development of the coastal plain and it becomes law, will you uphold the law Congress passes and use all the powers afforded to you to mitigate any potential negative environmental consequences? Ms. Norton. I will certainly follow any laws that are passed to be sure that the protection of the important resources of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preserved at the same time that any exploration or production would take place. Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Now, moving over to Prudhoe Bay, which was discovered 30- some-odd-years ago, in the search for oil in Prudhoe Bay, which has been providing this Nation with about 20 percent of the total domestic crude oil produced for some 27 years, and it is falling off now as Prudhoe Bay declines. But not looking for it, but as a sidelight, we found some 36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Nobody paid much attention to it because of the cost of getting that gas out when gas was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet, which is what it was a year ago. Now gas is $8.40 and, as we look at our reserves and the fact that we're pulling down our reserves, there is more and more thought given to marketing that gas. In order for this to become a reality, it's going to take a transportation system and it's going to require an investment of about $10 billion, the largest single construction project that would be on the horizon and larger than anything that we have undertaken in this country. Should the owners of the gas decide to move forward with such a project, the Department of the Interior, through the Joint Pipeline Office, will have an awful lot to say about the permitting and development. My question to you is, if confirmed, will you act in your role as Secretary to provide all the resources needed to the Joint Pipeline Office in Alaska to help expedite a project of this magnitude if indeed it becomes a reality? Ms. Norton. I'm aware of the important need for natural gas, not just because our economy is expanding and there's more demand for energy, but also because natural gas is seen as one of the ways of having the cleanest supply of energy. So it's important for us to have some mechanisms to be able to draw upon gas resources. I will look forward to working with you to learn more about that issue. It's not one that I have had the opportunity, obviously, to discuss the details on. I will look forward to working with you so that we can resolve that issue. Senator Murkowski. February and March are a good time for a visit to Prudhoe Bay because you can see it as it really is 9 months of the year. My last appeal to you is, please come visit us in Glacier Bay. Glacier Bay is the number two tourist destination in our State. The number one is Denali National Park, both of which are maintained by the Park Service. But there seems to be a great reluctance on the Park Service to allow the entries of passenger ships during the season, which is only 90 days of the year, to allow 2 ships a day so that the visitors can see this, and to suggest that the environmental damage would be any more than an occasional cigarette butt that somebody might throw over the side of a ship--it's pretty hard to make a case that there's not a more compatible environmental way to see this beautiful area than by cruise ship. For the life of me, the Park Service just doesn't want to let access in, and they have no good scientific justifiable reason. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bingaman. Senator Dorgan. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Gale Norton, welcome to the committee. As we hear the public debate that occurs on this nomination, it occurs to me that various groups describe two different Gale Nortons. One of them is described as bright and charming, interesting, soft- spoken, self-confident, reasonable, thoughtful, and moderate. Another some describe a nominee who thinks on the political fringes, favors polluters, cares little about the environment, is unsympathetic to endangered species, and is a friend of both lead paint and James Watt. So the question is, who is Gale Norton? I don't know Gale Norton except to have met you last week. We need to separate the fact from the fiction in this debate. Saying that, I recognize that these spotlights that shine on public lives these days can sometimes offer almost perfect vision and other times offer a pretty warped view of what is real. So I'm going to ask you a series of questions about things that have been said about you and things the you have said, and I'd like to get some response. I kind of feel about the same way as Senator Bingaman feels. I have not made a decision about this nomination, but I do believe that Presidents have the opportunity to send us their candidates and we have an opportunity, of course, under the advise and consent responsibility to ask questions. You have a very distinguished record. You've done a lot of things. I, too, am a graduate of the Graduate School of the University of Denver and I'm pleased to hear that you were on the faculty. Let me ask you some questions, and I'll try to do a number of them quickly. Global warming. You have written that there is little consensus over whether global warming is occurring. Do you think there's any kind of a scientific consensus at all that there is some significant climate change occurring or global warming occurring? Ms. Norton. Thank you very much for the opportunity to begin to reconcile the parts of my record and to have the opportunity to explain myself so that perhaps the picture of me that emerges at some point will be a little more clear. Global warming is an issue that has seen scientific information developing over time, and the further we go through the process the more information we have available. The article that you referred to is something that was written several years ago. I will maintain an open mind and receive new scientific information as it is put forward. Senator Dorgan. But my question is do you think there's a consensus on any side of this issue? Some would say, you know, while there are doubters certainly, and some respected doubters, there seems to be a fairly overwhelming consensus among most scientists that something is occurring in the area of global warming. Do you share that view? Ms. Norton. It does seem, based on my evaluation, which is not a scientific one, that there is beginning to be more of a consensus that global warming is occurring. There is still disagreement as to the causes and the long-term future. Obviously, there is disagreement about what ought to be done in that regard. I will certainly rely on scientific information as it becomes available and evaluate the information as it is presented to me. Senator Dorgan. Thank you. Let me ask you about the issue of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause and some of the comments that have been made about your position on that. You have indicated that the Government must pay compensation when its actions interfere with private property rights, in an article you wrote or a speech you gave. And you talked about the fact that it may even extend to a property owner's right to pollute. Could you tell us what you meant by that? Ms. Norton. The issue of private property rights is something that is important to me beginning from the time that I worked with farmers and ranchers who feel very strongly about the land that belongs to them, who care very much as stewards for that land. I think it's important for government to be able to work with the people who feel closest to land and to try to find ways to reconcile with them, ways of protecting the environment and allowing people to use their property. In an article I once was talking about extreme examples of environmental analysis and the analysis of takings laws. The idea of a right to pollute is not something that I support. That was actually a phrase that is taken from some work that I did earlier on the concept of emissions trading. The idea of emissions trading, of the ability to find economic incentive ways of dealing with pollution, is something that early on was called an emissions credit, a right to pollute. That is a tradeable concept that has now been embodied in the Clean Air Act and it has very widestream, very mainstream acceptance. It is absolutely not clear from that article that that was the way in which I was using that phrase and I recognize that. I do not support the concept of a right to pollute, as many people have tried to characterize that. Senator Dorgan. I'll try to come back to that in a future round. But let me just ask on the takings issue. You believe that local governments have a right to be involved in zoning? For example, if you have a home in Denver and I buy the lot next door and put up a sheep barn and bring in 2,000 sheep, you have a right to complain about that because that violates zoning? Or, because they say I can't put up sheep or put up a sheep barn and house some sheep next to your house, have they taken something from me? Ms. Norton. The concept of zoning and the way in which we use our property are things that do require an evaluation of property rights. I think it's certainly appropriate for a local government to say you can't put a sheep ranch right next to a residential community. Senator Dorgan. And that is not a taking? Ms. Norton. That is not a taking. Going back to the ancient aspects of common law, there have always been limits on using property. You cannot use property in a way that harms the property of your neighbors, and that's a concept I wholeheartedly agree with. My view of property rights is, as it applies to the Department of the Interior, what inspires me to want to find ways of working cooperatively with landowners to have incentive-based approaches, to encourage them to enhance habitat on their property or to protect endangered species on their property. I think we can find very cooperative ways of working with farmers and ranchers and other landowners that are based on recognition of the importance of property rights and to tie that in with protection of the environment. Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, I'm just about out of time. I want to just ask two very brief questions and you can perhaps answer them at the same time. One is, do you support the Endangered Species Act, what are your thoughts about that? Second, can you just briefly describe your feeling about States' rights overriding tribal self-government's rights with respect to Indian nations? Ms. Norton. I support the Endangered Species Act and the preservation of endangered species. I've been privileged to work on the protection of species like the California condor, on the endangered fish species in the Colorado River. I think we've seen some accomplishments there that hopefully will allow those species to survive. So I do support that. As to States' rights and tribal sovereignty, those are complex legal questions. It boils down I think to the idea that decisions of government are often best made when made closest to the people who are affected by those decisions. What is true for States is true for tribes. Self-government is very important and I support that as a concept. Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, I'm out of time. Thank you very much for your responses. Chairman Bingaman. Thank you. Senator Domenici. STATEMENT OF HON. PETE V. DOMENICI, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO Senator Domenici. Thank you very much. First of all, let me say to you that I did not know that you were also a Denver University graduate. I can say it that way because I graduated from their law school a long time before you ever got involved. First I want to thank the three public officials who testified in your behalf. I think each one of them contributed in a very special way, the two Senators first, in kind of shedding a positive, shedding a view of you that from my standpoint I had already arrived at. I read most of the attacks and allegations and then I read the reality of them, and I had already concluded that President Bush wants you to be his Secretary of the Interior and that you ought to have the job, that you see more of what you feel and see and think about public land issues in tune with his philosophy, and that's as it should be. If as a matter of fact that does not suit every single Senator, then they have prerogatives. But to bring up ideas that would diminish the fact that you can serve him well by doing what he thinks is the right thing to me does not make any sense. I believe you're entitled to the job. I'd like to say, I read the newspapers that are associated with your history. That would be the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post. And I'm actually very pleased with both of their editorials. I would say to anyone that thinks the negative record that is being made here is the other side of Gale Norton, that they ought to read these editorials. I mean, they say in the first three paragraphs of each one that you are competent, you're a wonderful legal scholar, you bring people together, and while the environmentalist community does not agree with you on everything, in many instances such as the reserved water debate, that you are in tune with the legal issues and that you have indeed been on the right side of most of those issues, even if there are some who would not like that view. Now, I would say for the record, from this Senator's standpoint, I read the Summitville mine issue in its entirety. I believe you have done everything appropriate in that regard and the State of Colorado's lucky to have you represent them in that issue. Now to the third person that testified in your behalf, let me say to the distinguished Governor, who I've recently had an opportunity to meet--everyone should know, I met him in the campaign of George W. Bush, so there's no doubt about it. We are right, on the same side. I think today, for those who are thinking that there are two sides to this very, very scholarly Attorney General, I think you have convinced me and you should convince most Americans that you know her best and the side that you have described as the positive side of her is the real Gale Norton. I don't think there's any question about it. You did a marvelous job and I thank you. Madam soon-to-be Secretary, I would be very upset if you didn't disagree with the Secretary of the Interior who is leaving in some respects and on some issues. As a matter of fact, if you choose to be as mellow about the way you feel about some of his decisions, I might not vote for you. Who knows. I mean, you ought to honestly tell us that many of the things he has done and that he put on the books of this country are not exactly what George Bush for President wants, but you will comply with the law and hopefully you can make some changes. Changes in what? Changes in the endangered species law. Not that it should be abolished, but we are so timid and so frightened we won't even consider an amendment to it now when even the administration and the Republicans agree, because somebody is fearful that you shouldn't tinker with that law. Well, it's not working very well. You want to know about it, come down to my State and see how the Bureau of Reclamation is about to determine that our water is all Federally controlled because of an endangered species. We aren't going to let that happen. We don't believe the endangered species, in that case a minnow that's preserved there, that we should let the Government run all of our water up and down the Rio Grande, our only real water supply. And we're not going to let that happen. I'm very pleased this election occurred because I believe you're not going to let it happen. When you see the equities of that, you're going to work toward some habitat and cut out the fighting that's been going on down there. My last observation is, if you weren't willing to take some new views on energy supply as it pertains to your properties, the properties you will run for all of us, then I would not be voting for you, because I believe we need some changes. We have a detailed report on energy supply from the public domain. It was issued only 2 months ago. I urge that you read it. It says on properties that have been withdrawn there are 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It is worth looking at those in light of our energy dilemma when we use 20 trillion a year. That's 10 years supply. There ought to be a darn good reason for locking it up when California's got their lights out today and maybe tomorrow they won't have any industry left. In conclusion, I assume you would be willing to be tasked by the President to work on energy issues as you work on the other issues and to look at those in light of your policy decisions; is that correct? Ms. Norton. Senator Domenici, I would be proud to work on trying to solve those difficult problems. Senator Domenici. My last one has to do with Indians. You talked about what you might do and you left out one big thing, so I would ask you to include it, because you talked about what the President-elect said. He said to the Indian leaders in New Mexico as a public statement that he would put $1 billion in this year's budget for Indian public schools. I think you should add that to your testimony, and since he said it I would hope you would agree that you will support it. Ms. Norton. I will strongly support that. Senator Domenici. What we've got now is a school system where the buildings are falling down, the Indian kids are in buildings we would not have other than Indians in, and he wants to get rid of the problem in 5 or 6 or 7 years. We've been working on it for 5 or 6. I laud him for it and I think you should support that. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield. Chairman Bingaman. Senator Wyden. STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Norton, thank you for the chance to have visited with you. I believe the American people will vigorously resist exploitation of public lands by private interests. I also believe that they will not resist and in fact will welcome an Interior Secretary with creative ideas for forging consensus, both to protect our treasures and be sensitive to our economic needs. Anyone who believes it can't be done ought to just take a look to my right--he likes to say he's always to my right-- where Senator Larry Craig sits. He and I worked together to resolve one of the most contentious natural resource issues last session dealing with timber harvests and payments to rural counties. So, it is possible to find consensus on these issues. I can tell you as a westerner, I share the view that one size does not fit all. When you're trying to comply with environmental law, what works in the Bronx may not necessarily work in Pineville, Oregon. But you have to convince me in these hearings that, as you provide flexibility to States and various other parties, your bottom line will be unwavering: All Federal environmental laws must be complied with, and you will have to enforce them. Finally, I will tell you I am concerned about the approach that you have supported in the past with respect to self- policing. Here again, it's a matter of degree. I like the idea of having people come forward and take the initiative, but I'm concerned in a number of cases like Summitville, where that approach was allowed to go on for too long, and I hope that you will take a different position. Now, for purposes of my question I'd like to follow up on what Senator Bingaman asked about in terms of enforcing the law. You said categorically you would and we appreciate that. But I have an article that I'd like to submit for the record from the Denver Post, where, when you disagreed with the affirmative action program in Colorado, they had to go out and hire outside counsel to represent the State. Now, I know absolutely nothing about the affirmative action law in your State. I'm against quotas. Affirmative action can certainly be improved. But would you do that again or have your attitudes changed, because when you told Senator Bingaman you would carry out the laws of the land as they are written and I have in front of me the Governor having to go out and hire outside counsel to carry out a State statute, that doesn't seem to square. Ms. Norton. Senator Wyden, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the questions that you have raised. Let me begin with the last point, on affirmative action. As Governor Owens described in his comments--and I thank him for his warm comments toward me--the program in question was not a State law. It was a program that was adopted on a discretionary basis, and that program was later held to not comply with the standards established by the Federal courts and so that program was essentially thrown out by the courts. As Attorney General it is my responsibility to advise the agencies of State government and I provided that advice to them. They felt that, and I concurred, that it would be stronger for them to have someone else who had not provided the advice that I did to them, and they went forward with a different attorney and they were not successful. I think my position on that was vindicated. As to Summitville, I think there has been some misconception that Summitville was an example of self-policing. It was not. It was a situation that was a company that did not comply with the laws that were in effect. My office took a very vigorous role in trying to deal with the Summitville mine situation. When we heard that that company was going into bankruptcy and had plans to just walk away and not operate the water treatment system, that cyanide would be flowing down into the river, we immediately stepped in to get a court order to prevent that from happening. We worked in the bankruptcy court to obtain as much as we could through that company's bankruptcy to try to use that money for the cleanup process. We cooperated with EPA, with the other State agencies, to try to have a coordinated approach. As a result of that coordinated approach, working with the State and the Federal regulators, we have taken actions to deal with what was a disastrous and awful situation. Senator Wyden. I know you cooperated with the Federal Government. But my concern is, when it was in your court, my sense is you were slow to deal with the issue. For example, the Denver Post on November 10, 1995 took you to task when they said that the environmental task force, with which you worked closely, was debating whether to extend the statute of limits on environmental crimes. You ultimately decided not to press the issue. They thought you should, rather than take it to the Federal Government. I guess my concern is, as with the answer on affirmative action, I gather that there you felt you would lose, so you wouldn't challenge the law, the law that is on the books. On the Summitville question, I think there was an opportunity for the State to have demonstrated leadership earlier on. These are some of the philosophical questions that I think need to be explored. Now, in your comments to Senator Dorgan you touched on an area that is very important to my constituents and that's the Endangered Species Act. I happen to believe that we can protect these species and be sensitive to local communities. You challenged the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act in an amicus brief that you filed in the Sweethome case. Now, I would like to know whether you would no longer file that brief today, given the opportunity to serve in this position, and whether that's what you meant when you told Senator Dorgan you supported the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act. Ms. Norton. Let me first address an unfinished point as to the Summitville matter, and that is that criminal prosecutions did occur. My office worked with the Federal agencies. And yes, we were frustrated by the fact that we had a short statute of limitations. We felt that in that situation, working through the environmental crimes task force that my office took the initiative in establishing, that it was best for us to work cooperatively with the Federal agencies. That has resulted in, I believe, the strongest possible action being taken against the operator of that mine. We have recovered--just recently they've recovered millions and millions of dollars against that operator, that will go into the cleanup of that site. As to the Endangered Species Act, I was involved in a piece of litigation that dealt primarily with the interpretation of the act and how that would be applied. The States of Arizona and Colorado filed a brief in which we said that it should be interpreted in one way. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that it should be interpreted differently. I will certainly uphold the position taken by the U.S. Supreme Court and will enforce the Endangered Species Act. Senator Wyden. I have a number of other questions, Mr. Chairman, but the light is on. I appreciate it. Chairman Bingaman. Thank you very much. Senator Craig. STATEMENT OF HON. LARRY E. CRAIG, U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO Senator Craig. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Gale, it is really an honor for all of us to have you before this committee for your confirmation hearings. As the crowd was gathering, I had never seen so many photographers in my life. Now, as a politician I was extremely jealous. I mean, I work at trying to get a crowd out like this and they never come. I couldn't imagine that that crowd had assembled for you. Really, I thought they'd come to see Ben's new bike. If you don't know, Ben's got a beautiful new bike that he's going to have in the Inaugural Parade the day after tomorrow, and it is a gorgeous sight to behold, I am told. I was quite confident that's why all of you photographers had assembled. Not the case. The case was that you had been promoted in a way that just does not meet the standards of the record. And it is exciting for me not only to hear your Governor, but your colleagues, your two Senators, begin to set that record straight, and we have heard repeatedly again here today that somehow what has been said about you over the last good number of days, when literally the Senate has placed a gag order on you and your colleagues, simply doesn't seem to match. So it's always fun, exciting, and appropriate that we have you here to speak in your own words, as you are doing so well at this moment, on these kinds of issues. My colleague from Oregon Ron Wyden mentioned the success that he and I had recently on a piece of legislation that dealt with public lands and communities of interest that had been dramatically depleted of their resources for schools and counties and roads and bridges over the last decade because we have reduced logging on our national forests by over 80 percent. Now, having said that, I am not going to suggest that you come and return to that. But what I am of the belief, and you've mentioned it at least three times in your statements, and I've kept track, you've used the word ``collaborative.'' That is an exciting new term that the national preservationists shudder at. Ron Wyden and I implemented it for local communities to begin to work together with all of the stakeholders of interest at those local community levels to resolve the current crisis in the relationship between economies and local communities and the public lands around them. The reason the national preservationists don't like that term and the reason the photographers have assembled today and the reason the word has gone out about you is that they are losing their top-down authority to control the way decisions are made without public participation, without the collaborative process. Most importantly, without this community or this committee of jurisdiction. I find it interesting, Gale, that your predecessor who is soon to be leaving his office treated this authorizing committee in this way. He said: ``It is a highly partisan debating society, staffed by munchkins that wrangle a lot.'' Now, I know that aggravated the ``h'' out of me, and my guess is if you continued to treat us like your predecessor has it would begin to aggravate the heck out of my colleagues on the other side. You see, collaboration not only is important for local communities of interest today, it is extremely important for all of us, working with you, to arrive under the law at the way we resolve these public land disputes when they occur, but, most importantly, to establish long-term policy that impacts our States and these valuable lands and the treasures upon them. As you know, yesterday the President again in great pride and gesture announced new monuments. Let me tell you briefly the story of one that occurred in Idaho in the last few weeks. It is to recognize internment camps where Japanese Americans were held during World War II. It was a time in our Nation's history we will not repeat and we are embarrassed about. And that area, an internment camp in Jerome County, south central Idaho, should be recognized. I agree and the whole of the delegation and our Governor agree. Herein lies the problem. And as I describe it to you, you will know all so well why I had to publicly oppose the designation--not the intent, not the purpose, and not the value. We were told it was going to happen, some 70,000 acres of land set aside for the designation. I said to the gentlemen at Interior and Council of Environmental Quality: Do you realize that within your area there is an irrigation canal and a right of way for that canal for the Minidoka Irrigation District? Do you realize there is also a road right of way and that you're creating a new level of bureaucracy and a whole new relationship that this irrigation district and road right of way, county in this instance, will have to establish with the National Park Service? If you move your lines a little bit and you adjust a little bit, you can still have the purpose, but you avoid the conflict. Their answer was basically they didn't care. They wouldn't hold a public hearing. They wouldn't listen to the public. They wouldn't incorporate the interests of the broader area to adjust the boundaries to avoid the conflict. They seemed to be an awful lot interested in politics and not very interested in local involvement, in collaboration, and, if you will, a rather democratic process. So it is exciting to me that you would use the word ``collaborative.'' Oh, it's inflammatory, because it suggests that all of us ought to be involved in decisionmaking on the resources of our public lands. I find it also interesting that you're being attacked over States' rights and Tenth Amendment issues. We are not a democracy. We are a representative republic. We are a union of States, and we are still that even though some would like to deny that. This means that States should and must have equal standing when it comes to deliberations that involve them, their resources, and their people. Somehow over the last 8 years we've just forgotten all about that, or at least some have who preside within the Beltway of this city. You and I may differ a little bit on States' rights, but I think we understand the relationships, the value of States and governors and our responsibility to them, but also our responsibility to the Nation and to the resources involved. I look forward to working with you. I think you will be confirmed by a large and substantial vote of the U.S. Senate, because the billing that you're getting isn't holding up. The record will set you free, because it is an outstanding record of service to the public, service to the resources and to the environment that we all love. I thank you for your willingness to commit yourself to what you have committed to for the next 4 years and I am confident that we will have a collaborative working relationship that involves both Democrats and Republicans, that we will not see king-like actions being dictated to us by a Bush administration, recognizing that all of us ought to have a piece of the action. That's the way our country works in a republic through a democratic process. Thank you for being with us. Ms. Norton. Thank you. Chairman Bingaman. Senator Graham. STATEMENT OF HON. BOB GRAHAM, U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Ms. Norton. I would like to talk some about the issue that Senator Craig has just explored, and that is collaboration. My particular interest is your views on the role of the States and the Federal Government and particularly the Department that you have been nominated to head in the management of natural resources which are either within that State or adjacent to that State. Could you give us some general statement of your philosophy as to what should be the role of the States in determining uses of natural resources that are in properties owned by the Federal Government, but either within or adjacent to those States? Ms. Norton. Thank you, Senator Graham. The very difficult issues of trying to manage public lands are best illuminated by the information that comes from the people who know those lands the best. The Federal Government obviously has control of its lands and constitutionally it is the Federal Government that makes the decision about those lands, and there is no mistake that it is Congress and the Federal Government that have control over those issues. We ought to have, though, a cooperative working relationship with the States. When decisions are made in a way that involves the States, those I think are the best decisions in the long run. A few years ago I worked with Senator Hank Brown, when he was in your midst, on the issue of wilderness areas in the State of Colorado. As State Attorney General, I worked with him in trying to deal with some of the water issues that came from the designation of that wilderness area. We worked with environmental groups and local governments, trying to find the best way of handling those issues that was really tailored to what we needed in Colorado to be able to preserve our wilderness. What you need in Florida is obviously different than what we needed in Colorado. There are no ``one size fits all'' solutions. So I would hope to work with the States to be able to find the things that would best fit each State. Senator Graham. Well, I am pleased at that response. The particular issue or application of that issue that I am concerned with is the use of the Outer Continental Shelf which is adjacent to our State. For 20 years through Republican and Democratic administrations here and in Tallahassee, if there has been one issue which has united our State, it is an appreciation for the potential vulnerability of both our environment and our economy to oil and gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf. For approximately 20 years, the Congress has repeatedly passed a series of moratoriums against any additional grant of leases in that, off the coast of Florida. I was concerned when I saw an item issued by the National Ocean Industries Association urging the Minerals Management Service to include offshore moratoria regions in the agency's next 5-year Outer Continental Shelf leasing program. Could you comment as to what you feel should be the significance of a State's determination in opposition to further Outer Continental Shelf leasing in areas adjacent to that State? Ms. Norton. Consistent with the idea of trying to take into account the wishes of local communities, President-elect Bush has made clear that he supports continuing the moratoria on offshore leasing as to California and as to Florida, where the States have opposed that offshore activity. There are, as you know, some areas that are not covered by that because the process has already taken place, and those issues will need to be dealt with on a case by case basis. Senator Graham. Would you believe that other States such as North Carolina, which has taken a similar position, would be accorded the same treatment that California and Florida would be accorded? Ms. Norton. We would work with the officials from those States to try to reach an appropriate solution. Senator Graham. During the administration of the first President George Bush, there was not only the continuation of moratorium on existing leases, but a buy-back program for leases, particularly in the area of the Florida Keys. Would you support an expansion of that lease repurchase program to other areas adjacent to States which have taken a position similar to Florida's? Ms. Norton. That, Senator, if an issue that I will have to explore more and learn more about as I move into the position of Secretary if I am confirmed. I will be happy to work with this committee and with you to try to resolve that issue. Senator Graham. I would hope that early on in your administration that we would have the opportunity to sit down and develop a plan that would be acceptable to the administration and to the States affected for that purpose of eliminating the threat that is represented by leases, many of which are many years old, to the environment and economy of those States. There is an immediate issue now and that is a proposal for the grant of a drilling permit on one of those leases in the vicinity of Pensacola, Florida. Would you plan to work with my State and other States that might be subject to such a potential drilling to assure that the wishes of the State are fulfilled? Ms. Norton. Yes, Senator Graham, I would be quite interested in working with those States and in learning more information about that issue so that we can make a good decision. Senator Graham. When we met in my office we talked about some of your principles as they relate to private property rights and I tried to suggest a few hypothetical cases in order to elucidate how those principles might apply in a reality case. If I could suggest another of those hypotheticals, assume that the unfortunate situation should occur that a drilling permit were to be granted for one of these currently outstanding leases. The effect of doing so would have an adverse effect on the value of private property adjacent to where those wells might be drilled. It would also have an adverse effect on commercial activity, such as hotels and motels. Would you support Federal compensation for commercial and private owners who experienced a reduction in the value of their property as a result of the Federal Government first granting the leases and then granting the drilling permits to utilize those leases? Ms. Norton. Senator, it is important to recognize the impact of any Federal action on the people who are affected by it. There are legal standards for determining when compensation is appropriate. That kind of situation is probably not the sort of situation where direct compensation is ordinarily paid under the court system. The issue of compensation is usually a legal issue that depends upon the statutes and the court analysis. We also need to bear in mind that sometimes ways of trying to compensate people, whether that is direct compensation or whether it is ways of trying to mitigate the harms that are caused by an action, are also things that ought to be taken into account from a policy perspective in trying to be sure that when we have a benefit to society the burdens of that are appropriately and fairly spread across other people within society. To the extent that there are impacts upon people who are affected by a government program, whether it is people in Florida in the kind of situation that you describe, of whether it is people in the West who are affected by government decisions about Federal lands, those are things we ought to take into account and we ought to look at the whole range of different ways of trying to make sure that everyone is as satisfied as we can have with the decisions that are made. Senator Graham. Mr. Chairman, my time is up. I would like in the next round to come back and pursue this a little further. Chairman Bingaman. Very good. Senator Campbell. Senator Campbell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gale, have you read the papers lately and read some of the paid-for advertisements that have been put in the paper about you, about how bad you are? Ms. Norton. I've seen a few of those, unfortunately. Senator Campbell. Hurt your feelings? Ms. Norton. Well, I have to say it doesn't hurt my feelings that much because it doesn't sound like me. Senator Campbell. It doesn't sound like you to me, either. But I have to tell you, as one who was in that pool for Interior for a while, am I glad you got it. My wife's particularly glad you got it. I am seriously glad"
