        "text": "TOMORROW NOW: when design meets science fiction\n\n25 May to 24 September 2007\n\nMudam Luxembourg\n\n3 Park Dräi Eechelen\n\nL-1499 Luxembourg\n\nTel. +352 45 37 85-1\n\n11am to 6pm, Wednesdays 11am to 8pm, closed on Tuesdays.\n\ninfo@mudam.lu\n\npresse@mudam.lu\n\nwww.mudam.lu\n\nTOMORROW NOW – when design meets science fiction is the first exhibition devoted to the relationship between design and science fiction. Homage to Luxembourg-born Hugo Gernsback, the inventor of the term “science fiction”, it explores the links created between the two disciplines from the beginning of the 20th century until today.\n\nCurated by Alexandra Midal and Björn Dahlström, the exhibition presents the territory covered by both disciplines and the richness of their combination through works created by designers, architects, artists, science fiction authors and film directors on the subject of science fiction. More than 800 pieces by more than 100 artists have been brought together and are the subject of a thematic circuit that develops through the different galleries of the museum. The show design, by Mathieu Lehanneur, is in keeping with the exhibition in that it modifies our perceptions with monumental mobile cubes at the entrance to rooms that decide whether to allow the visitor to enter or not, a mountain of unidentified material which seems to pour towards the visitor and inflatable flying objects in a geostationary state…\n\nA catalogue with essays and interviews with and by various artists, authors and designers\n\n(including Dan Graham, Shane Carruth, Denis Santachiara, Kyoichi Tsuzuki, Paul Lesch,\n\nTim Armstrong, Dunne & Raby, Piero Frassinelli, Paco Rabanne and many more) about design and science fiction in history, literature, cinema, architecture and fashion will be published in autumn 2007. Some of these interviews can already be viewed as short films on www.mudam.lu.\n\nThe exhibition is a production of Musée d’Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean, Mudam Luxembourg."
