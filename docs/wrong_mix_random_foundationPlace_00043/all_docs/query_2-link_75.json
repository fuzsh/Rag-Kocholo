If you enjoy her episodes, please consider supporting her on Patreon.\n\nThe people who planned Notre Dame 850+ years ago were crafting the Paris we visit today. I wonder if that thought ever entered their mind or if they went about the challenge that lay ahead with their nose to the grindstone. Probably the latter because they had a massive challenge ahead of them!\n\nNotre Dame architecture is striking both inside and out. Maurice de Sully, who commissioned the construction of the new Cathedral, wanted it to surpass the beauty of the Temple of Salomon or the Celestial Jerusalem described in the New Testament. As a token of God’s approval on the endeavor, the Pope came to Paris lay the first stone and bless the project.\n\nNo expense was spared and the best artisans were hired for the job. What they created is one of the most celebrated icons of Paris, the place where French people have gather to celebrate and mourn for centuries. It is also one of the most visited historical monuments in all of France.\n\nOn today’s episode Elyse Rivin tell us about all the things we should pay attention to when we’re looking at Notre Dame architecture. The different gothic styles we will encounter there and what sets it apart from other Cathedrals built in the 1100s.\n\nFOLLOW US ON:\n\nEmail | Facebook | Instagram | Pinterest | Twitter\n\nSubscribe to the Podcast\n\nApple Google Spotify RSS\n\nSupport the Show\n\nTip Your Guides Extras Patreon Audio Tours\n\nIf you enjoyed this episode, you should also listen to related episode(s):\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral, Episode 4\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral Self Guided Tour, Episode 6\n\nLet's Review\n\nAfter listening to this episode, your head should be full of thoughts of rose windows, flying buttresses and gargoyles.
