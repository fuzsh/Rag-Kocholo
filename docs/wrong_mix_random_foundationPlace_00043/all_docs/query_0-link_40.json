        "text": "Nanci Griffith & That Sweet Blue Bonnet Spring, Catch Some Blackbird’s Wing Down at the Five + Dime\n\nA yellow dress covered in pink and red cabbage roses, mint and emerald green leaves seemingly holding them to the fabric. She had mousy brown hair, bangs that descended like staggered drapes around her elongated heart-shaped valentine of a face with eyes so sparkling and alive they glittered into the cameras/\n\nHer speaking voice sounded like a small child’s, matching her diction. Her words bathed with wonder at it all – street light halos, Woolworth stores, trinkets and hope, she lit up as she shared what she knew or saw or felt.\n\nUnder the covers in a too cold house my much older fiancée didn’t own in Coral Gables, he’d left to go do errands. I could draw close to the oversized television on the table at the end of the bed, sheets pulled up around me as I stared at this anti-Barbie singing smart such smart songs. Miami’s PBS station ran “Austin City Limits” at an early hour, and in the black-out-curtained window, it felt like a Girl Scout meeting gone a little long.\n\n“Austin City Limits” was once truly a Texas texture, as Guy Clark would sing in “Rita Ballou.” Every now and then, they’d pick a few local writer/artists or bands, given them a show. Nanci Griffith, whose name I didn’t know, had just released Once In A Very Blue Moon on small indie Philo Records – and this was a showcase for those brilliantly turned sketches, almost scrimshaw miniatures of small town life.\n\nHer voice, when she sang, was deeper, throaty, had that Stevie Nicks’ vibrato – or a pure, soaring crystalline quality. It melted over the kind of acoustic music that exists in the fertile delta between country and folk, where the violin is more fluid, the steel guitar more diamonds sprinkled across still water. It didn’t straddle the genres, as much as float back and forth like sheets on a breeze when they’re hung outside to dry in the sun.\n\nShe was obviously older than me, but was so young seeming, she was the grown-up answer to my far older than my own 12 year old appearance while slinging bylines for The Miami Herald, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, Tower Pulse and Southern Magazine. There was a place for us kid-looking people with hearts older and more erudite than our looks suggested. And, her melodies were sweet but salty; the loves and adventures were pure and sized for an actual life someone could inhabit.\n\nBy the time Jason returned, I was out of mind about this woman I’d seen in the yellow dress like Helen, my extra grandma by choice instead of blood, wore while playing a guitar almost as big as she herself was. She had an upright bass and a cellist and a licorice whip thin guy who sang, so minimal chic but with this hair, and and and...\n\nFull grown, exfiancee #2 glazed over. But he knew when I got on a tear, it didn’t stop. We got in the car, drove down to Spec’s, the South Florida record chain, and walked in. Me blabbering, him trying to figure out how to decode this problem. Turns out one of the clerks had had “ACL” on, saw the same thing I did – and walked us back to the folk section.\n\nOnce In A Very Blue Moon was in a bin for the taking. We did.\n\nWalking out pleased with the purchase, I excused myself from any further conjugal duties and went back to my dorm room. I sliced into the shrink wrap, drew out the disc and put on side one. “Ghosts In the Music,” indeed.\n\nIt all poured out, puddled on the cold linoleum tiled floor of a room mostly packed up towards semester’s end. Endearing, charming, unselfconscious, it was small stories, big truths, moments you might not notice – but that might just define you.\n\nIt had been recorded at something called the Cowboy Arms Hotel & Recording Spa with the same producer of John Prine’s Aimless Love. I couldn’t know so many of the players – Roy Huskey, Jr on upright bass, Mark O’Connor on fiddle, Phillip Donnelly on guitar – would become figures in my own story, nor that the background singer Lyle Lovett would be one of the singular voices of Nashville’s progressive traditionalist moment.\n\nIt was just magical, and perfect. Like a Truman Capote or Willa Cather novel, moments seemed pressed between pages and saved for the ages.\n\nThe obsession was such that I called Rounder, raved about this woman from Texas I’d never heard of – writing for The Herald enough I knew lots of record company people in those days before MTV, let alone internets and instant gratification – and asked them to please keep me posted. That I didn’t know what story or who for, but I wanted to write about her, absolutely.\n\nMy exfiancee thought I’d fallen into toxic shock from my obsession with Southern and Dust Bowl fiction. He just couldn’t... so we started taking separate cars as the candy-coated voice unfurled these sweet stories. Pulling up, banging what Griffith came to call “folkabilly,” on the cheap aftermarket cassette player attenuating the cassette I’d bought, her voice sounded a bit like a muppet gone tipsy.\n\nRounder didn’t forget my lunatic raving. They sent me an advance cassette of Last of the True Believers, an even more accomplished and confident album that still did the Currier & Ives meets Norman Rockwell vistas. Her sound had solidified; Rooney’s always tasteful production was at its greatest elevation. Each instrument was its own sparkling diamond around Griffith’s at times guttural, at others shimmering or tender velvet vocals.\n\nTower Records’ Pulse bit. My first conversation with Griffith via phone was delight; her Texas twang rolled down the line with girlish giggles for punctuation. She conjured a instant friend intimacy that suggested the same kind of friendship that made the innocence of “There’s A Light Beyond These Woods, Mary Margaret” such a covetous thing for a young woman starting to make her way in the real world.\n\nWe talked Larry McMurtry, O. Henry, steel guitar as a mood-setter, John Prine, dime store treasures, the journey. She’d had two albums I’d never heard of (again, it was world before the internet made everything instantly accessible), with dreams of having music take her around the world.\n\nShe was exotic as peacocks on the front lawn, as familiar as homemade bread or a well-washed linen shirt with a slightly frayed collar. Twee as some found it, she could bite into the world, too. Whether the reeling fiddle of “More Than A Whisper” was a grown-up love’s complicated nature and need for true manifestation, or the rushed and rushing bawdy declaration of life from a whore waiting on a trick “Lookin’ for the Time (Workin’ Girl)” with its profession “This sidewalk ice is cold as steel/ and I ain’t Dorothy, I can’t click my heels...” and the utterly business forward “If you ain’t got money, I ain’t got the time for you.”\n\nAuthoritative. Straight to the heart, the gut, the throat. It was a money shot, and she – the little folkabilly goddess in the white anklets and Hooverette house dress – didn’t flinch or waver. To say I loved it would be like saying Chanel is expensive.\n\nAround that time, Tony Brown rolled into Florida to meet up with Steve Wariner, an artist he’d produced at RCA Records and had just signed to MCA Nashville. The Chet Atkins protégé was that same kind of wide-eyed kid as Griffith’s persona suggested. Driving Brown back to the Howard Johnson’s by the , urnpike after a night of hanging out and closing down a Palm Beach restaurant/boite, I pulled out my advance of the album – and threw it in my cassette player.\n\nI’d made a speech about how I didn’t know whether it could work at country radio, if it made sense for a major Nashville record company, but this was special. He needed to listen. That voice poured out of the speakers of the little tin mosquito Nissan Pulsar I was driving, bounced around the car and lit the piano-playing A&R man up like a pinball machine.\n\n“Can I keep it?” he asked. I let him have it, let him bounce out of my car into the mildew-scented hotel in the grove of sagging palm trees. The next day, his head most likely throbbing, he got in my car, so I could take him to where Wariner was sound-checking. He went on and on about how much he liked it, the writing, the voice, the person singing it.\n\nSaid in some ways, she reminded him of Wariner, who he was doing pre-production with. Someone who didn’t want to be more than they were, each sang about a life that was the right perspective for the room. Wariner – beyond the crushing guitar skills and sweet voice – truly was a small-town Indiana kid; Griffith, though, a product the local Texas songwriter rooms dreamed of larger worlds and other places.\n\nThe legend is Lyle Lovett turned Tony Brown onto Nanci Griffith. But that day in the sun-parched parking lot outside a strip mall honky tonk, the Elvis and Hot Band veteran witnessed like a new convert. We were two people talking over each other about how incredible this artist was; me saying I was so glad I hadn’t overstepped my bounds, Brown saying he needed to figure it out, but was going to..\n\nAt the same time, Steve Popovich, a rock & roll student of all music and the head of Polygram’s Nashville operation, heard “Love at the Five & Dime” – and told Kathy Mattea it was her next single. The West Virginia songstress with the dusky eiderdown voice that curried the folk out of mainstream country product smiled. She’d not followed up “Soft Place To Fall” with a hit, and she needed to breakthrough before it all fell apart.\n\nDriving north on I-95 a few weeks later, “Love at the Five & Dime” came pouring out of the speakers – and it wasn’t Griffith’s version. It felt like a hit, slightly folkie, very homespun and charming in the way it told the story of Eddie and Rita, waltzing the aisles of a Woolworth store. Suddenly, Mattea’s sweet spot was colonized – and Nanci Griffith was a hit songwriter.\n\nMomentum and dominos both move fast. Suddenly, Griffith’s record deal came through at MCA Nashville. She was touring Europe, becoming the queen of Ireland, a nascent then full-on friendship with dean of Nashville songwriters Harlan Howard. “Letterman” and “The Tonight Show,” Rolling Stone, back when it was every two weeks and excruciatingly hard to get into. Was it Liz Thiels, the publicist? David Wild, the reviews editor, who adored roots music? Was it just how intriguing her special mix of elements was?\n\nDid it matter? Even if country radio found her voice too bracing, Mattea had another #1 with “Going, Gone,” while the touring life saw Griffith become a full-on headliner around the world – and a theater-sized draw in the States, where she also headlined folk festivals.\n\nFree to explore the lives of characters who intrigued her, able to make a good living making music she believed in, it was fluid. She moved to MCA Pop, then Elektras Records, worked with producers Glyn Johns, Pete Buck, Rod Argent, Don Gehman, Peter Collins, Ray Kennedy and served as a comrade and peer to Lyle Lovett, Steve Earle, Emmylou Harris, Guy Clark, Tom Russell, Townes Van Zandt.\n\nChampioning Julie Gold, Griffith’s “From A Distance” so transfixed anyone who heard it, it wasn’t long until Bette Midler recorded it. Midler’s version defined ubiquity for many years, reminding people we are all small and equal, that “God is watching us” not as an enjoinder, but a comfort in our hard times.\n\nLike a good folkie, she lifted people up in song. A later album, The Loving Kind, boasted a title track inspired by the obituary of Mildred Loving, whose Supreme Court case overturned laws banning interracial marriage, and the capital punishment indicting “Not Innocent Enough.” Earlier, Storms’ “It’s A Hard Life Wherever You Go” considered kids without chances in Northern Ireland, impaled racists in Chicago and measured the hope of America’s ‘60s idealism with a chorus that implores, “It’s a hard life, a hard life, a very hard life/ and if we poison our children with hatred, then a hard life is all that they’ll know/ and there ain’t no place in this world for these kids to go...”\n\n“Trouble in the Fields” from Lone Star State of Mind lamented the plight of family farmer, while the dobro-drenched, accordion-basted “Love Wore A Halo (Back Before the War)” from Little Love Affairs measured the outlaw lives of number runners, a Jersey hotel and perhaps some comfort paid for by the hour. Unlikely people, missed or stumbled over, they rose up under Griffith’s sense of detail and zeal.\n\nShe would do a pair of covers projects, this woman who’d generously covered everyone from Tom Russell to Robert Earl Keen to ex-husband Eric Taylor, that celebrated her influences. Other Voices, Other Rooms gathered up 17 songs from Bob Dylan, Kate Wolf, Gordon Lightfoot, Jerry Jeff Walker, Woody Guthrie, Janis Ian, Buddy Mondlock and Harry Belafonte with Carolyn Hester, Emmylou Harris, Iris Dement, Arlo Guthrie, longtime collaborator James Hooker and Linda Solomon’s “Wimoweh” boasting Odetta, the Indigo Girls, Kennedy Rose, Holly & Barry Tashian, John Gorka, David Mallett, her father and Jim Rooney.\n\nA supple versatility, a fluid sense of folk made the project seamless – and earned her her first Grammy Award. Best Contemporary Folk Album, an honor that matched the present to the past and the future. Other Voices measured how much veneration she brought to the art of songwriting, the ones who came before. Raising a light for the generations to come, she shone on – and fans flocked to the light.\n\nBut Voices’ Wim Wenders’ “Wings of Desire”-evoking video for “Speed of the Sound of Loneliness” duet featuring the song’s writer John Prine that nailed the way reverence, searching, kindness and the echo of emptiness converge. Black and white, grainy, urban, Griffith in white and Prine in black, they are angels living in our world as supernatural forces and mortal beings. Beyond the whimsy, there was a sense of truth matching the reality of being a star in the musical sense.\n\nJust as important as her O. Henry character sketches and embrace of the postcards and polaroids that make up a life, the woman with a mouth like a bow conjured a tenderness that permeated her songs. Love was sometimes perfect and attained; occasionally flawed and wild. But as often, it was failed and someone – usually the woman – was leaving, frustrated, sad, but never beaten by what had transpired.\n\nAs a music critic carving a path when there weren’t really women covering music, as a female working her way through six engagements and many suitors always trying to be reasonable as I left, as a girl raised on books and dreams and hopes and songs, Griffith seemed a chimera before me, radiant and resplendent as Our Lady of Bookworms or the Patron Saint of Coffeehouse Angels. Could she really be real?\n\nAny single woman with a career or a drive to find their place in the world – in those days before Mary Chapin Carpenter’s Rickenbacker-downstroked suburban tales – found a richly-colored construction paper fortunecatcher every time Griffith released an album. Those stories of old couples we hoped we’d turn into like True Believer’s “One of These Days,” but also the unflinching make it happen drive of “Ford Econoline” that allows for self-propulsion, for dreams that required some form of screw it.\n\nThere was the romance of it all. No matter which album you landed on, that romance of life, the sweet nectar of somebody’s smile or a flick of a wrist taking a cigarette to their lips, it was all spark and igniting properties. Wherever, however, drink it in, swallow it down – and let whatever it was rush to your head. Don’t lose your senses, but go ahead and enjoy every last tingle.\n\nThat was the thing about the bookish, kindergarten teacher-looking songwriter: she could smoke’em if you had ‘em and drink’em down with the best. She would show up half kewpie doll, half brainiac and leave the room in ashes, all hearts splayed. Who wouldn’t wanna do that?\n\nMany, many years ago, dressed in a pink and white gingham dress with buttons down the front and pale pink Buster Brown shoes, I went to UCLA to see Nanci and Guy at some hushed concert hall. I made the decision to dress for her people out of respect, but also to honor the way she’d lit my way coming into my own as a writer.\n\nAfter slipping backstage between their sets to say my hellos, I had to slink out halfway through Griffith’s performance, drive into West Hollywood and make my way to the Whiskey A-Go-Go where I looked beamed in from another galaxy. Security guards a 100 yards from the door couldn’t believe someone looking like this could be on the guest list, nor could the guy at the Will Call window where the show was about to go on. Of course, I didn’t care that at the height of spandex, slashed tshirts and Aquanet, I was a giant neon goody two shoes. I was on the list, and they were ushering me in.\n\nAs the Nasty Habits took their positions in the world’s smallest nurse uniforms, I made my way through the snickering throng. Sam Kinison bounded onstage to introduce Motley Crue, who were kicking off their Girls! Girls! Girls! album en fuego. Riling the crowd up, the band came on like a jet engine hitting prime thrust -- the crowd reacted accordingly.\n\n“What the hell do you have on?” asked my surly comic friend when he got back to us. “God, Holly...”\n\nI explained where I’d been, what I’d seen, screaming over Nikki Sixx’s throb and Mick Mars’ squealing guitar. He took me in, started to laugh, shook his head. Dressed like a pirate, with a rag tied diagonally across his overprocessed hair, he pulled me close and hugged me, whispering, “Well, okay, respect.”\n\nRespect. More than anything that’s what Nanci brought the world: respect. She smoked. She drank. She recorded other people’s songs to make sure people heard them, shared duets with everyone from the BoDeans to Mac MacAnally, Tanita Tikaram to Darius Rucker.\n\nShe loved Loretta Lynn, could talk about her for hours long before Jack White made her a hipster madonna, and Carolyn Hester, a folk goddess almost nobody today remembers. She never played the ingenue, nor did she throw sex around like a hipcheck in ice hockey.\n\nShe may’ve veered towards country radio, or closer to adult alternative at times, but she was always utterly herself. She knew how to be true to her literary influences in her songwriting, yet never lose the thread of who she was most of all.\n\nNow she isn’t. Slipped through a crack in time, just – POOF! – and gone.\n\nA couple years ago, her manager sent me to the house to do some interviews for a possible memoir. She was so happy to see me, remembered times I’d interviewed her, places I’d seen her play and so many friends we had in common. It was sweet and fun, like running into an old friend in an unlikely airport.\n\nShe treasured her memories, the people she’d met, all the twists along the way. Talking she’d light up, clearly delighted by the memory. But somehow, she wasn’t ready to tack down her past. Yes, it had all happened. She’d had a miraculous life, done amazing things, seen the world many times over, shared stages with incredible musicians.\n\nBut to talk about it, you could feel it weighing her down. If she was measuring her past this way, what else was left? She wasn’t sure, and she didn’t know. Not that we ever talked about that in those terms. Sometimes you just know people who look back too much run the risk of turning to salt and blowing away.\n\nNot Nanci Griffith. She was one who held her own course, made her own journey. Of course, she would quietly slip away while no one was looking, just like one of the girls in her songs. She knew where she was going, knew Guy and Townes and Prine and Cowboy Jack and Steve Popovich and Phillip Donnelly and so many more were waiting.\n\nWhen you’re headed to that, why would you stay? Long ago, she wrote “Gulf Coast Highway” with two friends, a song about love and death and spring in Texas, parsing the way progress siphons off the delicious parts and places of life. The melody feels like steam rising from a blue line on an old map in that kind of swelter only Southern towns near water can muster, the chords moving slowly like a cloud of melancholy.\n\nYet, “Gulfstream Highway” is a song of triumph and a letting go. When I heard the news, it was the third or fourth thing I played, because the joy in life’s fading is perhaps the thing -- after all the cultural dissonance, all the lives lost -- we need most.\n\nAs she sings towards the song’s end:\n\n“Highway 90, the jobs are gone\n\nWe tend our garden, we set the sun\n\nThis is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow\n\nAnd once a year they come and go\n\nAt this old house here by the road\n\nAnd when we die we say we’ll catch some blackbird’s wing\n\nAnd we will fly away to heaven\n\nCome some sweet blue bonnet spring...”\n\nwww.hollygleason.com\n\nConnie Bradley shone brighter than 4th of July fireworks. Part of it is simple: she was so dang pretty. Blond hair, eyes like a fox that twinkled, the turned-up nose, the mouth that was also always perfectly lipsticked.\n\nAnd she knew how to put those outfits together. Bright colors. Mixed fabrics and textures. Sweatshirts and jeans. Cocktail clothes and ball gowns. All of it always set off with the most perfect accessories, just that one touch that made you look and made you smile.\n\nBut that really wasn’t the deal about why and how the woman who got her start as a receptionist at WLAC-TV mattered. Sure, she worked at a couple labels, spent more thirty years at ASCAP before rising to the head of the Nashville office. Really what stands out was Connie Bradley and her acute curiosity, which drew people, especially songwriters and artists, to her.\n\nShe was a magnet for the creative types, who could tell by the way she listened, she “got” it, she understood their gift and their humanity. And even when she didn’t, she knew who was vulnerable and who needed a little shove when it came time to respond.\n\nBecause what Connie Bradley wanted, more than anything, was for people to win. Nothing delighted her more than seeing a young artist or writer have that first #1. Few things excited her like hearing a great song; a demo, a kid with a guitar or a final master recording, she didn’t care. Bring it on: more music, more life, more heart, more emotion.\n\nShe wasn’t a snob, either. She loved great big gooey hits, as much as she loved the deepest songs from Rodney Crowell or Emmylou Harris. To her, every song was the writer’s child – and every record was the artist’s face to the world.\n\nSo when you walked up the red carpet at the Nashville ASCAP Awards and Connie saw you, she’d light up, throw her arms around you, know everything about not just your song, but your journey to that moment. She had great writers’ reps, whom she empowered, so it wasn’t some kind of overcompensation. No, she just loved writers and their stories that much.\n\nWhile Connie was the queen – head, or EVP feels too mundane – of the Nashville ASCAP office forever, trying to remember when that happened is fuzzy. To me, she had always been there, had always been that force of song, of magic, of propulsion for artists.\n\nI can’t think of a time when Connie wasn’t there. Like the sun coming up, Connie Bradley – who married into a behemoth Music City music family when she married legendary producer Owen Bradley’s son Jerry, who would help Chet Atkins make RCA the home of country music’s first platinum album Wanted: The Outlaws – defined creative life for legends, newcomers, breakouts and superstars.\n\nShe came of age as an executive when women actually ran Nashville. Jo Walker-Meador at the Country Music Association. Frances Preston at BMI. Maggie Cavender at the Nashville Songwriters International Association. Helen Farmer, also at the CMA. Donna Hilley at Tree, which was purchased for huge dollars by Sony.\n\nNot only did these women matter, these women broke ground for artists they believed in. They created opportunities, blazed trails and often fought behind the scenes to change fates and outcomes. They’d look at you if anything was said about what they’d done, as if they had no idea what you were talking about; but they did massive career-changing things. Over and over again.\n\nTo them, that was what mattered: music, artists, songwriters, people.\n\nThough when I think of Connie, I think of the most amazing laugh, the flashing smile, the way her eyes lit up when she saw you – waved you over, patted the seat next to her, put her ear near your mouth for some delicious bit of news. Welcoming isn’t a strong enough word, nor is inviting. Perhaps, most plainly put, it was inspiring – you to be the best you, the most you, the Connie-est you you could be.\n\nAnd the only thing richer than Connie was Connie with her best friend Donna Hilley, or Conna as they were collectively known. Together, they could warp speed, make gravity loosen and hard hearts melt. Always laughing, always up to some great adventure – even if it was just a trip to the Dollar General Store or lunch at some white table cloth restaurant or local dive joint.\n\nThey got each other, celebrated each other, lifted each other, amused each other. To morph Scarlett O’Hara and Aunt Mame, they lived to prove that if life were a banquet where most poor such’n’so’s were starving, they were never going to go hungry again.\n\nLaughter was their currency. Brilliance and instinct were their blood. They knew publishing, creativity, reality. They could shuffle their decks, build people up, high five when the music mattered – or connected.\n\nWhen Donna Hilley suddenly died, a pall fell over the myriad people who loved her. My first thought ran to Connie. What do you say? Do? Offer? I send cards all the time. But what good is a card when half your boisterous spirit has gone to heaven?\n\nOne day, a few weeks after the news settled and people had gone back to work, my assistant said, “Connie Bradley on 1.”\n\nI couldn’t imagine. I was close to Donna, who I’d helped get on Entertainment Weekly’s Nashville Power List at either #2 or #4, having explained both the dollar amount of the publishing revenue she stewarded or the careers she touched, legacies she ensured. I mostly knew Connie through Donna. But maybe I’d said, “If you need to talk...” in my card; maybe she was curious about my relationship with her friend.\n\n“Hello,” I said quietly, figuring I’d let her lead.\n\nWe had a twenty-minute conversation... about me. Of all things. “I just want you to know that I know this is a tough business for women, and I watch you. I know you always stand up for the right things, you speak up when it matters and when it’s hard. I see that, and it matters and makes a difference. Don’t stop.\n\n“Donna really believed in you, what you do... and I do, too. If you ever need me, I’m here.”\n\nIf you ever need me, I’m here...\n\nFrom a very powerful woman who I could do nothing for. Jaw-dropping.\n\nBut that was Connie Bradley.\n\nWhen a young manager and a big dreamer were trying to get the artist broken, really broken – not just a cascade of stats about #1 hits and albums sold – Connie got out her phone book and made calls. She told people why the kid mattered, why the young manager who was giving it his all should be given a break, should be taken as someone good for “our business.”\n\nShe counseled. She schooled. She cajoled. But what she really did that was game-changing was believe.\n\nWhen people laughed about Kenny Chesney -- hard to believe now, but as the ‘90s became the 21st century, they did -- Connie dug in. She told anyone who’d listen why the young man from East Tennessee mattered, why the young manager – and she believed in Clint Higham, not just Dale Morris the legend who’d broken Alabama – would color outside the lines to realize Chesney’s demi-traditional country take on heartland kids’ experience.\n\nShe wouldn’t say it like that, but that’s what she meant.\n\nAnd when they’d hit a road block, a speed bump, Connie would have Higham to lunch or dinner or drinks, make him laugh, remind him what mattered, send him on his way. Nobody believed like Connie believed, and if she did, how dare you falter?\n\nNo one thrilled more seeing good things happen to the young songwriter with his will to rock the kids beyond the media centers than Connie Bradley! She would show up, drink it all in, laugh, clap, dance, have a cocktail, hug all the right people.\n\nAs his star collected, his meaning solidified, his vision focused – moving from a young traditionalist to someone drawing on the same essence of rock that grounded Springsteen, Mellencamp, Seeger and Petty in a way kids in rural America could locate themselves – she kept crowing, kept the heat on, kept the industry powers-that-be’s feet to the fire.\n\nSuddenly the kid making music videos with dancing cockatoos, whirling girls from the salsa bottle and John Deere tractors quickened. He was heroic. He was honest. He was real. When the young people of the flyover, coming of age in towns and small cities, saw “Young,” “When the Sun Goes Down,” “Anything But Mine,” they saw themselves – and they saw a “star” who represented their dreams, desires, triumphs and heartaches.\n\nConnie knew. Always.\n\nBecause Connie Bradley never let go, never moved on to an easier act with momentum, people paid attention. Sustained focused, faith that didn’t falter is a big witness in show biz. Connie Bradley understood that, and she brought it at 40,000 watts without flicker.\n\nA few years ago, under the guise of interviewing her husband Jerry Bradley for the CMA Board, she was on a stage, doing what she does best: bringing the business piece of country music to life for people who had some idea, but not the essential nuance Connie had.\n\nWhile she’s doing the glorious hostess thing, charming and enchanting the audience, leading her husband through his unbelievable history, a door to the side opened and a thin, muscular man emerged with his head down. Approaching the stage, the raw charisma pulled all eyes his way, and Connie turned.\n\nKenny Chesney was there to present the CMA’s highest honor for service, the Irving Waugh Award, to his friend. Shocked, Connie didn’t know what to say, but Chesney did.\n\n“To the best friend a dreamer ever had...”\n\nConnie cried some, laughed more, hugged hard, beamed mightily.\n\nNot that she ever did it for awards, or for honors. She never did anything except make people more, give them chances, offer them help or a hand up.\n\nWhen I think of Connie, I think of her laughing, telling some story about something that happened to some writer that tickled her to death... I think of her and her girl gang drinking a little too much wine and laughing a little bit too loud... I think of Clint Higham during rough patches coming back so fired up and happy after their lunches... I think of her blessing my desire to hire Michelle Goble when I needed a killer assistant, telling me, “She’s a good one, and she needs to grow” – and taking her back into the ASCAP fold when Goble’s health insurance needed to cover a husband’s pre-existing conditions... I think of her willingness to tell it like it is, even when the news wasn’t what someone wanted to hear; but it was always the clarity that most people never had, a clarity that came from years of watching, challenging, recognizing why things failed and how to make them fly.\n\nI think of her always knowing just what to say, and when to say it. And I think of her complete happiness watching a song come to life, whether it was a stadium of 60,000 singing along or some boy or girl Ralph Murphy had brought into her office, a young person who didn’t even know where to begin.\n\nThose things have nothing to do with the fabulous gowns, the joy she brought to every room she was in, the love she shared with her husband Jerry, even the incredible haircuts that always made you feel like somehow it was easy for her to look glorious. Truth is: it was Earl at Trumps.\n\nThey say when you die, you can measure the life by what you leave – not the things, but the moments. If that’s true, Connie Bradley will never truly be gone.\n\nToo many moments with too many people that made too much of a difference makes them impossible to count – and every single one of us will keep her light burning brightly, will hopefully find ways to bring her joy with us where we go. Certainly, that’s what she would’ve wanted and hoped that she left in her wake.\n\nSomething tells me, too, she’s watching us. Once she and Donna got caught up on the state of creativity in heaven, they’re probably both lying on their stomachs, legs in the air behind them, laughing and trying to figure out how to help us from up above. No doubt they’re laughing, crying with joy for being back together – and wondering where the next great song is coming from.\n\nApril 21, 2013\n\nChoices and decisions. Roads taken, things that mighta, things that oughta, things that should…\n\nMichael Stanley should have been a rock star. Like the “Almost Famous” not quite broken, eternal open act Stillwater, Stanley did everything but become an arena-sized headliner.\n\nExcept in Cleveland, Ohio, the Rock & Roll Capital of the World, the watershed scene in Cameron Crowe’s coming of age as a baby rock critic film where Stillwater is confronted by the encroaching reality of business as survival for a little band tilting at the impossible notion of “making music, you know, and turning people on.”\n\nIn Cleveland,Ohio in the late ‘70s and early 80s, you didn’t get any bigger than the Michael Stanley Band. Two nights at the Coliseum sold out faster than Led Zeppelin. Five nights in a row at Blossom Music Center. It was a frenzy, and the city had their shot at the brass ring that regional heroes Tom Petty, Bob Seger, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen manifested into national renowned for their hometowns.\n\nBut that was then, this is now. What happens to rock stars who fail to launch? The ones who don’t make it, who leave an entire city gasping for their moment to seen. Because if Michael Stanley did one thing for the psysche of a downtrodden city, he let them feel seen, recognized in th eslog and shove of surviving a rough Rust Belt reality. It wasn’t Springsteen heroic, but real to the streets of Cleveland, Akron and the other factory towns that were struggling across on Northern Ohio.\n\nMake that kind of music, especially where people are used to digging in, they show up.\n\nGive them dignity, some swagger, some reason to believe, they hang on.\n\nAnd when it’s over, they don’t forget.\n\nRock stars get real jobs when it’s over, blend in, make due; but they don’t forget, either. Just everything changes.\n\nThe reasons, the drives, the motifs. Still, the ones who believe never falter.\n\nBecause even when life moves on; the power of what music means sustains.\n\nThe trick is to swerve beyond the trap of nostalgia, bypass the sodden machismo of “who we were.” Things may be larger in the rearview, but they’re gone. Hang onto what’s gone, you might as well lay down and die. Over and done, you’ll miss what’s ahead to be savored.\n\nFor Michael Stanley, and the fans who peopled the four capacity nights at the slightly shabby Tangiers, it’s not about merely remembering. Not any more. If in the two decades he’s been doing these intimate shows, there were years of marking time and fulfilling people’s desire to hear the canon of their truly golden years one more time; it happens. In some ways, it’s the gravitational force of the needing to return to something you knew without thinking that lets tedium set in.\n\nWhatever the last several months have held, there was a moment where it all flipped over. What it was becomes what is. That which “never quite happened” suddenly matters, perhaps even more than when it first had its moment. Because now the need to believe, the need to celebrate is even more pressing.\n\nLike the city of Cleveland itself, Michael Stanley is still here. Still writing songs, still brandishing that brand of heartland rock and roll that makes the people of the flyover know they’re not forgotten in the rush for newer, hipper, younger. A little weathered from the miles, it’s not about still standing, but being triumphant in the journey. Celebrating where you are for what it is and flying the defiant flag of “we don’t give a damn about you, either/we have each other-- and know how to hang on when it ain’t easy,” the now becomes imperative.\n\nThrowing the gauntlet from the very first downstroke of “It’s All About Tonight,” a brakes-cut bit of bravado that is all carpe nocturnum, they don’t look back. Stanley, who’s earned the right to coast, hits the stage with purpose. Sixty-five years old, he sings harder, digs deeper and drops his often stoic resolve more now than ever.\n\nIt is music that, when fully surrendered to, transforms, lift people up and drives them past the inertia of merely getting by. That is where Stanley is now. It is obvious from his attack and his intensity that he wants to take his people with him.\n\nHis old songs burn with an urgency. A whiplash sting to “In Between The Lines,” the song ofpersonal and cultural reckoning ignited by the murder of John Lennon, it's a brutal indictment and fierce reminder. In some ways, a napalm rage against the killing of our innocence, “Lines” serves as a call to investment, to engagement, to taking an active role in making the world a place beyond rage, avarice and nihilism.\n\nThat electricity echoes on the waves of Danny Powers’ slow burning lead guitar and Bob Pelander’s cascade of piano notes during the bridge of “I Am You.” Again, Stanley sees the power in identification, the embodiment of being in it together. For him, it’s a state of inclusion, the combined energy making everyone so much more… and also the unspoken declaration of the heroic position of enduring for others.\n\nRock and roll used to mean that. In Northern Ohio, it still does.\n\n“I Am You” leads to the pensive “Winter,” a meandering Celtic-folk-leaning ballad that starts innocently enough. Equal parts reflection and regret, it’s also a knowing measure of where one is. To be willing to want to live, to hang onto what could be is the greatest fuel there is – especially knowing that one’s days are numbered.\n\nThe rush of that awareness fosters a force that fuels a colossal jam as the song shifts tempos, builds and lunges towards some exhaustive shudder. Harkening back to when AOR songs left room for excavation of melody and form, “Winter” bookends the much older “Lets Get The Show On The Road,” a bitter snapshot of the ennui of road life, the emptiness of the dream when it betrays you and the dead end that never seems to actually end.\n\nContaining the line “the Lord uses the good ones, and the bad ones use the Lord,” “Let’s Get The Show On The Road” illuminates an insight not yet experienced. Yet strung across the free form jazz back section, all paper tigers and Trojan horses of the lies we’re sold, what we need to believe and the way the dream can draw and quarter you, Stanley's seething witness blisters.\n\nIt is not blind rage, but the ballast of knowing.\n\nThe revenge is to keep coming. No retreat, no surrender. Indeed, exult in what is, what’s left, what you know and what yougot, not what people try to sell you. This beer won’t make you sexier, that hair care product won’t make you young.\n\nThat unflinching staredown transforms a song of not nearly enough into a rallying cry. The kick inside may be the only shot you got. But it’s what you got, and that seems to be the resonant note this night in Akron.\n\nWith an encore of “Working Again,” from the aptly titled Heartland, there is the Rodney Psyka conga/Tommy Dobeck drum pastiche that works multiple rhythms into a frenzy that sets the urgency in motion. Ultimately, another song of making ends meet, borrowing against tomorrow because that’s all there is, the desperation is marked by a fierce commitment to getting by with one’s two hands and the strength of a very broad back. If there is a more joyous drummer to watch than Dobeck, who hits with as much finesse as punch, it is hard to imagine – and that euphoria feeds the performers as they dig in for the duration.\n\nLike “It’s All About Tonight,” the immediacy is visceral. These fans know how these realities feel, they’re not American Express premium ticket holders buying the illusion of authentic blue collar exigency. These are their songs, cast as large as the room – and their souls – can contain. Packing a walloping Bo Didley beat, which Stanley tells them “is the beat your parents warned you about,” the crowd is on their feet, shaking what their mothers gave them for all its worth.\n\nThe Resonaters know the power of that primal pull. As the vamp builds, the “uhn, ahh” turns into the call and response of coitus. It is both metaphoric and literal – and the crowd surges towards their own sort of full-tilt musical climax. They want it, they’re gonna have it – and they shriek with abandon, spent but not quite exhausted.\n\nIn part, it’s a case of momentum being exponentiated via the ballads the fans are most invested in – “Falling In Love Again” sung more by the crowd than Stanley, a stately trek through the ’79 steamy slow dancer “Lover” – which allows regaining their collective breath to gather their fervor, then pushing further onto a pulsing forward tilt of these blue collar anthems that define the Midwest.\n\nBeing the last night of the stand doesn’t hurt. Stanley sung as hard on the fourth night as he’s ever sung, leaning into vocals, pushing phrases with a power that supercedes his normally smoky pensiveness or bitter bark. It’s as if he’s singing for his life; in many ways, though, his is.\n\nThese songs, culled from years in the trenches, are a litany of fighting back, of almost/not quite and try, try again. To get knocked down and denied so many times, and to get still back up and play, not for the record deal or the big tour or a Grammy, but because your soul requires it is the purest reason there is.\n\nA holy pursuit, there is no gain beyond the moment, remembering how alive you can feel. That moment of putting the pedal down, pushing the night to its limits – and feeling the things that gave you such potency when you were young, realizing those emotions are still something you can feel, embrace, wrap yourself in offers an energy otherwise untapped.\n\nIt’s not buying a Corvette and driving too fast, looking like an old fool too deep into losing touch to know the difference. This is about the intersection of dignity and what you’re made of is. The simplicity of suiting up, showing up and throwing down to the point of all that there is. Not for the money or the glory or the fame, but because as Springsteen says, “it ain’t no sin to be glad you’re alive.”\n\nWho we were, who we are, who we will be. It dangles in the humidity on one of Paul Christensen’s sax solos, sultry and ripe with the promise of desire; echoes of moors and Appalachia in Marc Lee Shannon’s mandolin turns. Beyond words, it's in the blood, pumping, throbbing, surrendering to how fierce it must be to be true to its point of origin.\n\nNo one else may ever see. No one beyond the moment will ever know. It doesn’t matter. For the assembled, this is all there is – and it fills the need in ways the superstar on his private jet, the high gloss fame monger or pampered starlet will never know.\n\nSnookie be damned, this is real. Real is what matters once you know happily ever after is right where you stand if you wrap your arms around it, and take it for all its worth. Michael Stanley – and the people who love his music – have figured that out. It is all that they need to get by.\n\n20 April 2013\n\nHe was a little bit shy, and big. Great big, big big. Half standing when I walked up to the table at the old Longhorn just off West End, he was almost too big to extricate himself from the hard wooden booth. A shock of hair fell across his eyes as he reached out a man’s forearm clad in denim and smiled into my eyes, nodding a welcome.\n\nI clenched the extended hand, forgetting... We’d never met, but the legend of Billy Joe Shaver losing most of three fingers in a saw-mill accident was known... and I clenched my fingers into a “man appropriate” grip.. A firm handshake, my Dad used to tell me, levels the playing field, says you’re strong, says you’re true.\n\nOnly when I closed my fingers, there was a whole lot of nothing there. He gripped with the fingers he had, closing his great big hand around mine. His palm had seen enough physical labor, you knew this wasn’t a pampered soul, who got rich and fancy when Waylon Jennings cut an entire album of his songs called Honky Tonk Heroes.\n\nI tried not to react, show surprise or yelp. He’d seen it all; he’d’ve probably laughed, but I was there to do an interview for Tramp on Your Street, his first album in a decade. I wanted to maintain not just my cool, but a sense I could handle the story. The project was a pungent roots rock affair, long on muscular guitar that was a narcotic musk of twang, tone and jangle courtesy of his son Eddie.\n\nThat was why the album was Shaver, not Billy Joe Shaver. It had that thumping backbeat that made Waylon Jennings an outlaw of equal stripes biker and cowboy, as well as the acoustic-forward tilt that pulled you into Willie Nelson’s far friendlier Armadillo country orbit. As Garth Brooks exploded, Vince Gill’s sweetness reigned and Alan Jackson brought traditionalism back into fashion, Shaver struck a blow for the roughneck place in country music where men were men and the ladies were glad.\n\nAn almost primitive writer, capable of great poetry and earth-cracking truths, Shaver’s gift was an odd gentleness, a vulnerability that recognized the failings of our mortal coil matched with a hell-raising, take-no-shit kind reckless good-timing. Still sitting there in that packed chain restaurant all the songwriters and old guard business types congregated in for mid-price red meat, potato planks and cold beer, draft or bottle, he was mostly funny, charming, patient recounting the story of a life Cormac McCarthy, Larry McMurtry and Tom McGuane couldn’t conjure as a team sport.\n\nRaised by his grandma, supplementing their social security singing on a pickle barrel in a general store, he was a bona fide Texas blue collar texture from a time forgotten. Though solid teachers’ pet stock, the brawling suited him better – a fact testified to in “Georgia on a Fast Train” that proclaimed, “I got a good Christian raisin’ and an 8th grade education/ Ain’t no reason for y’all to be treatin’ me this a way” – and manual labor for a big strong boy was an honest way to get life done.\n\nAs for his fingers, he shrugged, and said, “Yup, I was feeding planks on the line, reached back, got tangled up and next thing you know, my hand got pulled in.”\n\nMatter of fact, matter of life. Maintaining eye contact, he half-shrugged assessing my limit for gore, then kept going, “I looked down, saw my fingers in the saw dust, scooped’em up and put’em in my pocket. They tried to reattach’em, but too much damage was done.”\n\nNo big deal. Keep on. Keep on keepin’ on.\n\nChiseled features, a head bent to dreaming and the music inside, he found his way in the nightlife rooms of honky tonks and bars. Wrote some songs, banged around with his guitar, decided to give Nashville a try.\n\nThe story of Jennings’ repeated brush-offs after saying to bring the deep-voiced star some songs manifested into a threat to “kick your ass” if Waylon didn’t listen was as widely known as his the one about his mangled. He laughed telling the story sitting there, aw shucks and well, you knowin’ as if it was a just a little crappy on the line not the great big fish it was made out to be.\n\nFunny thing is: Jennings cut a whole album of his songs. More than the legend, there was the music, earthy, real, splintered in places and consumed by whatever emotion was driving the writing.\n\nLaughing at the table, he leaned over, wanting to share a secret.\n\n“You know that Madonna?” he asked, making sure I knew this wasn’t about some blessed virgin. When I nodded, his eyes gleamed and his chuckle tempered with something just to the left of lust. “Now there’s a gal, you know? I wrote ‘Hottest Thing In Town’ about her, the kinda gal that knows what to do no matter where you find her.”\n\n“Well, well...” I replied.\n\n“I mean, you don’t know her, do you?”\n\n“Only by records...”\n\n“Man,” he exhaled. “Just... man... I wouldn’t mind going a round or two with her...”\n\nIt wasn’t dirty, wasn’t nasty. Maybe the closest I’ve ever come to someone inhabiting that Hank Willilams’ notion of going “hawnkee tuhnkin’.” Though something told me if she wanted to use him as a human trampoline, he’d give at least as good as he got.\n\nLunch was savored, not rushed. He told stories, gossiped a little, talked about his past, his son, the future – and seemed not to notice the stolen glances from a pretty fast room. My mother’s mother, a salty gal who loved a character, would’ve pronounced him “darling.” My father, a former Marine, would’ve said, he was “A-OK.”\n\nWe stood up. He asked if he could give me a hug. It was like being swallowed by a mountain. He’d been off the rails for part of the previous decade, living rough and Tramp On Your Street was going to put him back on his feet. It gave him a reason to steal his son back from Dwight Yoakam – and to show rock crowds, college kids and old school country fans that there was still a spark of honest-to-goodness real men making stripped down, jacked up country-blues rock.\n\nTo hear something so unadorned, so almost turpentined then was a revelation. Today, it’s stark raving pure. Analog tape, real gear, musicians on the floor, throwing it down. You can almost hear the tracks sweat.\n\nAnd so I went home to write up a story for Tower Records Pulse! I made some calls, talked to some people. Convinced my editor at The New York Times this record, this artist in this moment was important. Sometimes it’s the antecedents (the people he’d impacted) that make the difference, but in the end, the 550 words in America’s paper of record make a very different kind of difference.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of that review, I wrote, “Ragged emotions are something Mr. Shaver earned through living, and that hard-won knowledge infuses \"Tramp on Your Street,\" his first recording in 10 years. Whether it's the roughneck bump and shuffle of \"Georgia on a Fast Train,\" with Mr. Shaver yowling the lyrics of bumpkin protest, or the meditational bluegrass of \"Live Forever,\" these are songs of redemption. In his world, though, redemption takes many forms: unabashed -- and unreal -- lust (\"The Hottest Thing in Town\"), surrender to a higher power (\"If I Give My Soul\") and, somewhere between, yearning (the fragile \"When Fallen Angels Fly,\" the eerie \"I Want Some More\").\n\nMr. Shaver once saw Hank Williams and sang of the experience: ‘His body was worn, but his spirit was free/And he sang every song, looking right straight at me,’ offering self-revelation in the process. With a gruff voice and awkward phrasing, he knows that truth isn't pretty. Still, he presents the tales and insights of a well-traveled soul wrapped in a buzzing barbed-wire guitar and a backbeat that crashes like a garden gate.”\n\nI’d write thousands of words about Billy Joe Shaver over the years, witnessing to his stoic grit, his naughty sense of fun, his abiding Christian faith, his ability to transcend hard times. But maybe nothing captures it better than those few lines.\n\nMoving around Nashville in those mid-90 days, in and out of camps and creative communities, I preached the gospel of Shaver’s core truths and rough-hewn, yet brutally exacting demolition country. So alive, so electric, you wanted to turn people on, shock them from the slickness.\n\nNotes were written, CDs left between people’s storm doors and front doors. Phone calls, but especially delicious sessions of “ooooh”ing and “ahhhhhh”ing over the viscerality of the tracks and the wisdom of the words.\n\n“Live Forever,” a quiet take on one’s spirit being eternal and a directive on kindness and the Christian way, seemed like a prayer the go-go ‘90s needed. With that kerosene rising melody, it deserved a torchy voice. Hummable; why not? It could bring sanctity to the radio.\n\nWhen the phone rang, Patty Loveless, on the other end, was raving about the album. An Appalachian traditionalist seasoned by wild hare juke joints in North Carolina, she understood every syllable and note twist on the album. “I’m gonna cut it,” she announced.\n\n“Live Forever?” I asked, gleeful\n\n“When Fall Angels Fly,” she returned. “It’s broken, but it’s saved. Holly, people need that kind of promise and that kind of hope.”\n\nIt was never a single, never a focus track. But the ache in her voice, the break in that vowels when she confessed, “I have climbed so many mountains, just to see the other side/ I have almost drowned in freedom, just to feed my foolish pride” was a revelation. Not a soul saved by love trope, but a woman who’d been places, who owned the miles and the men in the arms of that one person can embrace her whole being.\n\nWhile it didn’t earn seven figures, the song left a mark on history. When Patty Loveless became only the second woman to win the Country Music Association’s coveted Album of the Year, it was, “Patty Loveless... When Fallen Angels Fly” that got announced.\n\nNot long after Loveless and her husband Emory Gordy, Jr, cut the song, I came home to voice mail I could barely make out. Cell phones were new, reception was bad. A couple late nights later, I picked up the phone to that same voice: Billy Joe Shaver.\n\n“Holly, I will never forget what you did for me,” he said.\n\n“Well, it was a great song, and look what it did for Patty! It gave her a name for her record...”\n\n“I’m not kidding,” he said, being grave and serious. “When I heard her sing that song, I wept. It got down deep inside me. I can’t thank you enough.”\n\nPeople in moments are grateful. Gratitude in any form is lovely. The irony: Billy Joe Shaver never forgot. Decades later when I would run into him, he’d always find a way in a random moment to lean over and whisper some variation of “I mean it... man, the way she sang my song” in my ear. Because singers and songs and truth were holy, and he took it hardcore serious.\n\nAnd that was thing for all the sorrow and the pain... this is a man who lost his son to a heroin overdose on a New Year’s Day, and still showed up for his gig at Poodies later that night, who lost his mother and his wife in shortly thereafter, who just kept going, kept seeking to do the next right thing and help those who needed help.\n\nTucked into corners of the night, random multi-artist events or tv tapings, he was always glad to see you, always ready to sing his songs and tell his truth. He wasn’t detached, the songs showed that. “It’s Hard To Be An Outlaw,” flexing wicked double-entendres sung with Willie Nelson, from 2014’s Long In The Tooth has the same measured brio that made his early songs such unabashed articles of a certain kind of life.\n\n“Jesus Was Our Saviour And Cotton Was Our King,” “Old Chunk of Coal (But I’m Gonna Be A Diamond One Day,” “Ride Me Down Easy,” “Devil Made Me Do It the First Time,” “Old Five and Dimers,” “You Can’t Beat Jesus Christ” spoke volumes of how the Outlaws lived – and breathed. Later he got more randy, howling bawdy hilarity like “That’s What She Said Last Night,” or the hilarious truth-tell “Wacko from Waco” that rose from Shaver actually shooting a man.\n\nAnother larger than life legend that paled compared to the actual tale. Sitting at a bar with his lady friend, who was attracting unwanted attention, there were words. When the offender wouldn’t stop, Shaver suggested he was going to the bathroom, when he got back, the guy should be gone, or there’d be consequences.\n\nWith a chorus that promises, “I don’t start fights, I finish fights/That’s the way I’ll be/ I‘m the Wacko from Waco/You best not mess with me...,” Shaver walked out of the bar, looked at the guy threatenng to blow him away, and shook his head. “Where do you want it?” he asked him, then pulled the trigger.\n\nCool as is he is smart, Shaver rolled right up to Wille Nelson’s house, and started negotiating his surrender. Indeed, the bonus finds the Red-Headed Stranger admonishing listeners, “The Wacko from Waco is still on the run, A writer, a singer, a son of a gun/ Don’t cross him, don’t boss him/ Stay out of his way/ Don’t give him no trouble /Cause you’ll just make his day...”\n\nSo beloved by all, it was only a matter of time before justice was served. With Robert Duvall and Nelson sitting in the courthouse during the trial – and acting as character witnesses – Shaver was soon free again, exonerated by self-defense..\n\nFree again! Some men are freeborn men, others live their lives in shackles. Maybe that’s what made Shaver so transfixing. Never wanting to be anything more than he was, simple and willing and seeking higher ground while good-timing like few could, he walked that line between damned and sublime.\n\nThe acapella “Star In My Heart,” a tender love song to someone gone who will always be loved and dedicated to his son Eddy, on 2012’s Live from Billy Bob’s, manifests a purity you can’t fake. Tumbling into “Live Forever,” the Bee Spears-evoking back and forth bass part and the few gut string notes scattered beneath that slightly bent vocal tone, he weighs the words he’s sung for a couple decades at that point.\n\nYou fathers and you mothers\n\nBe good to one another\n\nPlease try to raise your children right\n\nDon’t let the darkness take’em\n\nDon’t make’em feel forsaken\n\nJust lead ‘em safely to the light\n\nWhen this whole world is blown asunder\n\nAnd all the stars fall from the sky\n\nRemember someone really loves you\n\nWe’ll live forever you and i\n\nI’m gonna live forever\n\nIm gonna cross that river\n\nI’m gonna catch tomorrow now...\n\nWhen the news arrived, via email from a mutual friend who moves through the same rooms of legends and songwriters, I shrieked. Literally, blinked twice and felt the blood curdling scream reflexively leaving my throat and through my lips.\n\nHow many more people are we going to lose? Are going to pass into the sky? Jerry Jeff Walker? Bobbi Cowan? JT Corenflos? Who next? It has been a cruel harvest, and a brutal year of too many unknowns.\n\nIn the vertigo and disorientation, it’s hard to know where the wall is, or why we should be believe it’s going to get any better. And yet, we have these songs, these recordings. From the ‘70s, the ‘90s, the ‘00s and the ‘10s.\n\nSlightly slurred, swooping down and lifting up, the joy is a dissolving agent, the faith is a buttress against what we can’t know. Typing this, another one, yet another one, I feel my heart lurch from shock to rage to sorrow to confusion and ultimately to being glad. In a world where all is temporal, Billy Joe Shaver was – all the contradictions, the swagger, the kindness, the hilarity. And there are so many memories to sustain.\n\nEven more, there is the music and the songs. Listening, absorbing it, I feel the corners of my mouth rising, my heart easing just a little. There are more tears to be shed, no doubt, but right now, it’s a little bit of Dixieland in “The Good Ole USA” and knowing he lived in glory, not in vain. Not a bad truth to tell.\n\nFor further reading: https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-billy-joe-shaver/\n\nYou couldn’t trust the Record Revolution near the Parmatown Mall. At least, not if you frequented the one on Coventry with the day glow punk rock window displays and surly clerks. Yet, there I was in front of a peg board display of “New Music,” weighing an offer from a way older than me golf pro to buy me a record.\n\nThe normal signals weren’t there. No interesting posters, stand-ups or displays to point the way. Just a bunch of shrink-wrapped albums, which I kept removing, turning over, assessing. How I got there, I don’t know. But I remember balancing my fear of his annoyance with my own desire to not squander a free record. Or in this case, 8-track, because that’s what his car played.\n\nPursing my lips, I made my decision. Van Halen. Definitely.\n\nI had no idea what it actually sounded like, but two burnt-out caddies had been raving about it earlier in the week. If it was good enough for them -- and they liked their rock – then it was exactly what I wanted.\n\nThe golf pro was non-plussed. “You sure?” he asked dubiously, flipping the album cover over and perusing the titles. Was it “Ice Cream Man” that gave him pause? “Atomic Punk”? “Little Dreamer”? I didn’t know, didn’t care. His pique made me want it more. There was no way this was going to be the Archies or the Partridge Family, so there was no shame in my game.\n\n“Positive,” I said. Marched towards the door of the little strip mall store, paused and waited. He took the bag, his change and headed for me. Passing through and onto the sidewalk, he looked over his shoulder, “This is gonna suck.”\n\n“Awesome,” I said, refusing to cower. “Can’t wait.”\n\nThat sound like an oncoming train turning into a space ship, the creeping bass throb made the opening 20 seconds feel like a lifetime. A cymbal strike, then another, and then... then... that guitar tone, swiping, slicing at the space inside that maroon muscle car. It was unlike anything I’d ever heard – and I’d heard a lot. T. Rex, Uriah Heap, Deep Purple, Les Dudek, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, the Stones.\n\nThe singer, wide open, vamping, rafting diving, wailing, was like a stripper on a pole. Swinging around the melody, yowling for effect, flexing what he had. It wasn’t power singing, slightly nasal, slightly throwing it out there. Like a javelin thrower, it was all about the moves.\n\nAnd then the guitar solo started – notes, surges, circles, a definite sense of progression. Whatever the singer was doing, and it seemed to be about howling over a big hook-filled chorus of multiple voices intoning “Running With The Devil,” it didn’t matter: the show was the guitar, and the guy playing it knew no fear.\n\nProof was in the second track. A tumble of notes, tons of notes, spinning and circling at a ridiculous pace. Like someone had taken a Gregorian organ piece, speeded it up, played it on an electric guitar. It was thrilling, no other word for it. Whomever this was, the dexterity was death-defying. And it wasn’t just fast notes, but someone chiseling a real piece of music out of thin air.\n\nI could feel the smirk crossing my face. Lips pressed together, the corners were repelling against each other, my eyes squinting as I tried not to be a poor winner. I’d been looking straight ahead, not making eye contact, just letting the music move through the car, me, the windows. When the notes were swallowed by something that felt like industrial noise, I exhaled. Turning towards my companion, the stabbing thrash that felt so familiar, that “when the whip comes down” flagellating the melody slapped across the bucket seats – and I realized the familiarity was... the Kinks!\n\nHoly crap! One, two, three. This Van Halen album, bought because two stoners, who were the best kind of bad news, had been talking about them, was yielding in ways that reinforced my authority about music and rock bonafides.\n\n“Well...” I leveraged, letting the smirk turn into a smile. “Well, well, well.”\n\n“Yeah,” he said. It was so good, he couldn’t disparage the record. And good in a way that suggested a brighter, cleaner kind of rock. This wasn’t the heavy metal or hard rock that was so onerous or dark. It almost felt like pop music, something that in another universe reconciled that serious playing of the guitar and a drummer who kept sweeping things along with the idea that big shiny chorus were what it was all about.\n\n“Ain’t Talkin’ ‘Bout Love” seemed to be the poon hound’s national anthem. Raised around golf pros always on the prowl for something quick’n’easy, I got the rub. This was hormones and want to, the idea that it’s just sex – and why not?\n\nFor all the macho posturing, damn that guitar player could play. And it just got better. “I’m The One” was a tangle that was blistering. Sure, there was an a capella “oh, wah, shooby doo wah” section that recalled the Doobie Brothers’ “Black Water,” but it was the guitar that just kept coming.\n\nBy “Jamie’s Crying,” Eddie Van Halen was playing with a wanton tone that slithered and swung from side-to-side like the hot chick who knows everyone’s watching her walk. The counter melody, counter vocal part spoke volumes about the intention, the aggression and the control he had over his instrument.\n\nWe were still sitting in the parking lot, letting the music pummel us. Looking at the clock, I flinched. Dinner-time! Oh, damn...\n\n“We gotta go.”\n\nBut having sat there, consumed by the playing, the swagger, the gusto for something big, loud and hip-shaking, there was something more to it than the guitar riffs, solos and weird ways of attacking the instrument. It was... FUN.\n\nThey played hard. But somehow – and not just the over-emoting, over-pouting singer – they didn’t take it all so serious. Yeah, virtuosity seemed to be an anchor, but they got the joke about how torqued up and testosterone-lacquered this was. Indeed, they leaned into with zeal. Who sings “I’m on fire” over and over in falsetto? Just a smokescreen for the spiraling runs, the punch punch pow of certain lines.\n\nOver the bridge, up Carnegie, up Cedar Hill and peeling off to the Fernway School district. The tape kept clicking into the next quadrant, and nobody was saying much of anything. Pulling into the drive, I was a little bit late. I’d have to explain, but the damage could be undone.\n\n“Can I keep it for now?” the golf pro asked, hoping to feel the grooves punch up whatever nocturnal adventures were ahead.\n\n“No,” I replied. “You said it was for me.”\n\nPulling it from its place in the dash, I smiled. Clearly victorious, I tucked my trophy on one hand, opened the door and hit the driveway. “I had a really good time, and I love this. Thank you so so much.”\n\nThe much older golf pro scowled. Thwarted from annexing the tape, the gap was between 20-something and 14 was becoming bigger by the nano-moment. Kid sister, mascot, pain in the butt, I was big fun – and I extracted a big price for my time.\n\n“You’re late,” my mother brayed. “Where’ve you been?”\n\nI slid the tape under the cushion of a living room chair, smoothed my clothes and said, “Oh, I went over to the West Side and played golf with a couple of the pros.”\n\nKnowing to start putting food on my plate and commit to dinner, I lowered myself into the seat that trapped me between the table and the wall. It was a basic dinner, no big deal, but dinner was always a big deal.\n\n“How’d you play?” my Dad asked.\n\n“Okay... Greens were slow, made a lot of putts.”\n\n“Anything good happen?”\n\n“Nope, just another day hustling golf with the hustlers.”\n\nWhat a lie!\n\nUp to the attic I stole after dinner, breathing in dust bunnies in the airless upstairs. Listening to “Eruption” over and over, trying to figure out how many notes, where they were going, how he was doing that. Finally, hitting the “Back” button over and over, I just let it wash over me like a rush of blasting water. Sinking into it, I drifted to a place beyond words or physical location – just rhythms, twists and tone.\n\nVan Halen, the band that split the difference between rock and pop, had exploded inside a mid’70s muscle car – and taken me away. If Aerosmith felt like the Stones seedy US underbelly, this was something else. For a girl who liked the guitars out front, the rhythms propulsive, so began a love affair and guilty pleasure that would sustain me throughout college.\n\nThe next day I saw the two stoners, went, “Van Halen... YEAH.” They looked at each other, then back me and smiled. We all just nodded and smiled.\n\nSpringing for the album, looking at the pictures, they were dangerous without being menacing. Carnal, sure, but more the kind looking for volunteers than hostages. And if you were just there for the music – wallflower that I sort of was – that was okay, too. Come, rock, be. Throw your hands in the air, shake your butt, jump up and down. Leave your frustration, put the accelerator down.\n\nBad days, Sad days. There was Van Halen. It could pick you up, spin you around.\n\nThere was nothing profound here, just a cymbal crash, the jackhammer beats. And that guitar – doing things that just kept you moving forward. But always, always with melody.\n\nAnd if David Lee Roth was that loudmouth guy who couldn’t shut his trap, hair like a lion, peacock strut and an arrogance that was laughable, Eddie Van Halen was cute. There, I said it. That smile, those impish eyes: he was a guitar god, but he was also really adorable.\n\nHaving grown up around the nerds for whom girls barely scanned – even their girlfriends seemed like an afterthought – the notion of a guitar hero who was darling was perfect. One more thing he did better than everyone else, yet that wasn’t even the point.\n\nBy the time Van Halen II dropped, they were massive. What had been my private stash, my jump around in my tshirt and jeans proposition had injected a Top 40 sort of hard rock sheen into Album Oriented Rock. The pulsing beats, the room on the tracks, the ear worm hooks – more often from the guitar as the lyrics – creating a new ubiquity.\n\nSuddenly, all boys played air guitar. Junior high school dances saw the wall-flowers spill onto the floor, lurching and churning to Alex Van Halen’s “stomp” here crashes. Even the cool Moms were down, turning up the car sound system and bouncing their head in time. It was primal, but polished into a light saber gleam.\n\nThey found a way to reinvent “You’re No Good,” a steamy soul song that my friends all knew from Linda Ronstadt’s exhortative version, as a dank sort of trepidation, then emergence. Whatever, whoever she was, the guitar’s ramble spoke more than Roth’s vocal. It was half self-salve, but more the confession of a man felled by love.\n\nMuch to unpack from a song all the little girls thought – via Ronstadt’s backbone – they understood. To stare at the block disc turning ‘round was to hypnotize oneself with the turning and the tone. Not that II was a journey to the center of your psyche.\n\nNo, they perfected the party on, lust’n’libido notion of rock and roll. Out front, shameless, yet not so threatening for their unabashed celebration of “Dance The Night Away,” “Beautiful Girls” and “Women In Love.”\n\nThere was ZZ Top/Tejas kinda boogie with “Bottoms Up,” an acoustic almost flamenco excavation called “Spanish Fly” that dropped into straight into the slice’n’spin “DOA.” Every flavor, every color of rock and roll, it was here. Narcotically infectious, even the rock based upon classical music geeks had to give propers to Eddie Van Halen and his crew.\n\nVan Halen merged being a party band with groundbreaking musicality. So much fun, you could miss the virtuosity – until that one riff corkscrewed by you, took hold, dropped your jaw. Whether you played an instrument or not, there was that moment when you stopped, went “What the...” or “How the...”\n\nMake no mistake, it was always the brothers Van Halen. Diamond Dave may’ve been the sideshow carny and Sammy Hagar the hardcore metal singer, but it was the propulsion of Alex’s drums and the igniting factor of Eddie’s playing.\n\nIf “Oh, Pretty Woman” put them squarely on Top 40 radio, “Jump” made them lords of MTV. Even more startling about “Jump,” it was the columns of synthesizer that architected the equally driving single that was feeding on the post-disco new wavery of Men Without Hats and the Thompson Twins with an authority that would one day ooze from Prince’s rock-taut funk.\n\nYes, the solo – hammer-ons and arpeggios -- was like a jungle gym you could climb all over, but the vision transcended mastery of the guitar. Suddenly, we were all one big musical gumbo, one big party where all elements cooked up hot.\n\n“Panama,” back squarely in the rock lane, worked just as well. Good times, good hooks, good grooves. They conviviality of the band of the band in the video made Van Halen a club you’d want to be part of: the thump bomping you forward, the red guitar with the white tape taking on another level of iconography.\n\nIt was all so thrilling, then the tempo dropped. If Roth’s recitation was a little creepy, Van Halen’s guitar – the tossed back and forth downstrokes, slithering licks – was a novella unto itself. A dark and stormy night, a misty roads end, a little bit of musk and misadventure.\n\nAnd “Hot For Teacher”? After school special took on a whole other, prurient realization.\n\nDiver Down and 1984 suggested a musical omniverse. A place where it all rocked together. But perhaps the greatest unifier had nothing to do with Van Halen at all.\n\nMTV was a bastion of blinding Caucasian whiteness. Like AOR radio, it was filled with the Camara and Trans Am friendly bands. For every wacky Cindy Lauper, boytoy Madonna or British new waver from Banarama to the Clash, there was no Hendrix, no Tina Turner, no soon-to-be-minted Prince of Pop or just Prince.\n\nEddie Van Halen, whose parents moved to America because of his prejudice his Indonesian mother faced living in Holland with his traveling musician father, understood. Without ever flexing his own family’s experience with racism, he showed up, put up and laid a solo down on “Beat It” that made Miichael Jackson a citizen in full of MTV’s rock hard jungle.\n\nNo one doubted Jackson’s talents, that wasn’t the fact. Without words, though, there was a segregation in place that no one wanted to address. With six strings and a whirlwind of dexterity, Eddie Van Halen showed it was all music. Bring the intensity, the creativity and let the best song win.\n\nLike a lot of rock stars, he struggled. Booze, primarily, but drugs. Late nights, party down. But always sweet to the core and chasing a dragon of what could he make the music do, where could his fingers go, his ability to drive deeper into his instruments, his vision, his curiosity.\n\nHanging with Sam Kinison, the comic/preacher/surprisingly facile musician, they could go for hours, for seemingly days. Talk, laughter, jamming, pressing into all the places people who fly so close to the sun see that elude the rest of us.\n\nAlways, always, seeking something more, walking a blade of music and shock, Where could it go? What unspeakable truth could you find?\n\nIf Diamond Dave was a flamboyant sideshow barker, Eddie Van Halen was seeking something more. If the party was what drew the masses, it was the playing that fed his soul and galvanized his band as more than one more hair metal act with momentum and a moment.\n\nThree patents. Licks every pimply faced kid who wanted to rock locked himself in his bedroom to learn. A currency of the road is communicated by his solos without ever calling a title.\n\nHaving risen from backyard parties and Hollywood’s Starwood/Gazarri’s scene, he understood the commerce of hot girls, good times and loud music. But Eddie Van Halen knew how much more it could contain.\n\nIf Roth wanted to fly solo, Sammy Hagar provided a way to take things more seriously. Sure, they’d still pack some leer factor, some brio, some of that rafter-diving vocalese. But “Right Now” suggested a band that could make you think, too.\n\nIt was a new day, a new way of rocking hard. Once again, in a whole other way, Van Halen had redefined their singularity. If the exploding reality of another discovery didn’t have the same seismic force, they broke ground wielding awareness with the same “check this out” as Roth twirling some girl’s g-string on his finger.\n\nEddie F’ing Van Halen.\n\nLike the Michael Jackson solo, heck like the solo on Nicolette Larson’s “Can’t Get Away From You” billed to “?,” he sought to keep his cancer struggle on the downlow. People knew, but had no idea. Word would spread, then be calmed.\n\nIt was as if he didn’t want people to lose site of the music in the struggle. He was a vessel of the Gods sent to pour the music out over us. The rest was just a matter of his mortal coil being mortal. Don’t look there, look here! See the sparks fly! Watch me ignite this 18 bar section of song! Hear the twists, swirls, corkscrews – and smile, or jawdrop, or marvel, or scream.\n\nScream! With delight, pleasure, rapture, awe. He didn’t care. He just wanted to play.\n\nStanding in the grocery store, the text came. Just the TMZ announcement, nothing more. Butt the sender: Kenny Chesney, a kid who had those songs pumped into his veins almost before he was double digits.\n\nHaving become real stadium-sized ticket-selling artist, Eddie Van Halen’s represented the blurring of lines in the name of music to the kid from East Tennessee. If Keith Whitley gave him heart, Van Halen was the blood pumping through his heart and his approach to music. The notion country could have real songs, could punch hard, could burn guitar solos into the night as 60,000 people screamed was born turning up Diver Down in his best friend David Farmer’s stereo.\n\nHe, who’d made friends with his hero, had shared at least one blistering night with the Van Halens. Not quite a “Wayne’s World” moment, but the pictures show a road band, clearly influenced by the brothers, beaming about the merging of worlds, the kindness they were shown and the moment to share a stadium stage with icons who’d seen and done it all.\n\nThe spice aisle blurred. Somehow the heavy whipping cream didn’t seem so important. These moments – so ordinary and uneventful – can knock the legs out from under you, take your breath away. Tears ran down my face, not because I knew him – beyond seeing that smile under those thick dark bangs falling across his face with Sam – but because Eddie Van Halen’s guitar set me free, let me jump into the brink and believe could fly.\n\nTexts flew all night. Emails came and were sent. Back and forth, back and forth. An art director friend passed me a couple of the Gene Simmons-produced demos, bursting with the inevitable.\n\nA couple calls, a lot of tears. For me, Van Halen -- where it all began – played way too loud, but exactly the same volume was when a barely teen found a record in the West Side Record Revolution.\n\nAnd that’s the thing about Eddie Van Halen: he -- seemingly -- knew no fear. Just higher, faster, squigglier, fuzzier, cleaner. He didn’t care about changing the world, he wanted to press the music as far as it could go. And he did. And we are all the more in so many ways for it.\n\nHe was cool. Not Steve McQueen cool, but good guy who’d do the right thing, help somebody out because he could cool. Indeed, he was the kind of cool that even before I knew what cool was, or really understood what the man with the curly dark hair and the bright smile did, I knew he was cool.\n\nPeople think the social upheaval happened in the ‘60s, then the ‘70s were one long disco inferno. Nothing could be further from the truth. In Cleveland, Ohio alone, the lake died, the river burned, four kids were shot to death protesting the Viet Nam war at Kent State, race riots saw America’s first Black mayor elected and nice girls from good families ran off with the Children of God, Mexico to get busted coming back with a lid of grass or New York because Roe V. Wade wasn’t a reality, but their pregnancy was.\n\nInto or against all that, Mac Davis emerged the unruffled songwriter who’d created hits that synthesized these moments. Elvis Presley’s “A Little More Talk” may be the musky brio that defines the King’s charisma, but “In The Ghetto” alone crystalized the stark pain of the inner city with a quiet conviction that matched Marvin Gaye’s own social awakening. But there was more, the tender “Watching Scotty Grow,” the heart-tugging “Memories” and the life-affirming “I Believe In Music” to temper the awareness you couldn’t turn away from.\n\nSuddenly, the kid from Lubbock who moved to Atlanta, then crossed the country seeking a toehold in music was a songwriter the famous artists clamored for. Nancy Sinatra had invested wisely when she signed him to a publishing deal. He wrote hits for Glen Campbell, Dolly Parton, Tom Jones, Johnny Cash, Bobby Blue Bland, Tammy Wynette, Frank Sinatra and Merle Haggard, plus Aviici and Bruno Mars of recent vintage.\n\nPeople who believe in music are the happiest people\n\nClap your hands, stomp your feet, shake your tambourines\n\nRaise your voices to the sky, God loves you when you sing\n\nThe son of a religious man, gospel permeated his music. Whether the slow burning carnality of “One Hell Of A Woman,” or the overt church-feel of “I Believe In Music,” the soul of his raising was evident. So was the innocence of dreaming when you’re small-town bred, but believing there’s something more: “Texas In My Rearview Mirror” spoke volumes about chasing what you don’t truly understand with enough passion to possibly catch it.\n\nThat hope in the face of impossible odds, that smile and sense of “why not?” embodied an optimism people needed. But this wasn’t a hoaky sap who didn’t know better, this was an actual man intent on embracing the best in people.\n\nGrowing up, my atonal Dad loved to sing along with the radio. Some songs got even more gusto than others, and Davis’ songs – whether he sung them or not – swung in a pocket perfect for Midwestern males content in the suburban realities. He found “It’s Hard To Be Humble,” wryly iconic with its confession “I’m perfect in every way.” He delighted in the real life reminder “Stop & Smell the Roses” with its gospel tinge.\n\nAnd as a golfer, he had a temperament that when we watched as a family, his deportment was that of an excellent athlete. But more than a cocky jock, he came off like the definition of “a sportsman,” the kind of gentleman who’d be nice to your daughter, respect your wife and wisecrack his way around the course. But also, the kind of guy who’d press on the last three holes, and pay his bet even if he didn’t think he should’ve missed that putt.\n\nHonor comes in many forms. Mac Davis seemed to embody it.\n\n“Lucus Was A Redneck” a swampy, bluesy funk, painted a pretty unapologetic picture of white trash. The wah-wah guitat’n’harmonica track was a corner of the mouth kinda special, where the narrator called out a bad seed for using the N word, beating up hippies – and just kept going, railing about racism and bullying without ever flinching.\n\nThat’s the kinda stuff my Daddy liked. No show, no big deal, just a solid cut to the gut, call it as it was and don’t look back. Other than that rearview mirror filled with Texas, neither did Davis. Between “In The Ghetto” and “Lucus,” Davis did as much for racial equality in a turbulent time as anyone – and he wasn’t looking for any credit, he was just showing the simple truth to a world that needed it.\n\nNeeded it. Never chiding, never holding it over someone’s head. Even “Baby Don’t Get Hooked On Me” stood as a warning to a girl who was a good hang about being a guy she didn’t wanna think about as a long term prospect. In someone else’s hands, the song would’ve been an arrogant brush-off, but for Davis with those Raphael-like curls, it was a gentle landing from a tall summit being prescribed.\n\nMusic is the universal language, and love is the key\n\nTo peace hope and understanding, and living in harmony\n\nSo take your brother by the hand and come along with me\n\nLift your voices to the sky, tell me what you see\n\nAnd then – after a couple years of music man tv variety show a la Campbell, John Denver, Andy Williiams, even Sonny & Cher – came “North Dallas Forty.” Playing a seasoned quarterback who was resolute and philosophical about the game, privileges and realities of being a sports hero, the songwriter/pop music star’s cool quotient went through the roof. Somewhere between DGAF and Ferris Bueller, Seth Maxwell was low to the ground and never one to let anyone see him sweat. With just enough drugs, booze, profanity and women, it was a pretty unflinching look into big time sports that candy-coated nothing.\n\nJust as tellingly, the earthy part of who a man is at his most venal permeated Davis’ performance. Opposite Nick Nolte, Dabney Coleman and Charles Durning, the bar was set pretty high.\n\nPlaying a flawed character, but one of modern heroics, the smiling guy from the variety show and so many PGA golf tournaments imbued Seth Maxwell, the peacock quarterback who knew the deeper aspects of his sport, with both swagger and a humanity bolstered by conflict.\n\nIt’s just a football movie, one could argue. But back when storyline, conflict and tension were key to film-making, “North Dallas Forty” sought to illuminate larger truths about a flashy game America was making its new religion. Like his songwriting, where there was often gritty truth beneath the indelible hooks, the performance showed how much of the world Davis had absorbed. Right down to knowing sometimes getting by can be an awful place to be.\n\nThe complexity is part of what fascinated Davis.\n\nMore than anything about the Songwriters Hall of Fame member, a Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame member, a 1974 Academy of Country Music Entertainer of the Year, Georgia Music Hall of Fame, Texas Country Music Hall of Fame and BMI Icon Award winner, it was the humanity that mattered. Well into his seventh decade, Davis was still collaborating with young artists on the rise. Just as Bruno Mars about “Young Girls,” or Avicii on the international hit “Addicted To You.”\n\nOnce upon a time, a young kid from East Tennessee at the beginning of his career was in Hollywood for business. A mutual friend introduced him to Davis, and it wasn’t long before he was invited to stay at their house when he was in California. It was a place he would visit, a home in the storm of chasing the fame – and an opportunity to talk songwriting, inspiration and what it all means.\n\nA small town kid, Davis found the highest reaches of what music can give. Rather than swelling up with selfishness, he opened his home to young artists coming up, reveling in new waves of creativity and the love of the game.\n\nHe had a beautiful wife of 38 years, children, grandchildren, joy and generosity. Family was something that didn’t just endure, but sustained – and the fertilizer that made “Stop and Smell The Roses” so sweet.\n\nThat sense of humor, the curiosity informed a willingness to come out and be seen, but never overshadow the others in the room.\n\nSometimes my life is measured by watching others, seeing how they move through the crowded halls or talk to people I’ll never know. Mac Davis was one of those: seen from the distance or up close in the conversation next to mine. He had a laugh you’d like to shower in, and a smile – all these years later – that said, “Amen! Thisis the place to be...”\n\nHe appeared a little late at that small town kid’s 40thbirthday party, slipping in so as to keep the focus on my friend. By then, Kenny Chesney was selling out stadiums by the handful, had won a few Entertainers of the Year Awards and was well on his way to a second greatest hits... But that wasn’t the point of his showing up. Mac Davis came to see his old friend, a kid who’d done well, but someone who’d become part of his family on a threshold where he could celebrate a life-marker because life is what mattered.\n\nThe hug they shared was profound. Friend*family*force of love.\n\nMore than money, more than fame, more than hit movies, tv shows or songs, the delight of seeing a buddy in the middle of a celebration made his light shine. Having spent more time in Nashville, co-writing and seeing friends, sometimes you’d see him coming out of a restaurant or event, often with Lise, his equally beautiful, equally in love with life companion.\n\nThe irony of Davis, with the smoky voice that could be seductive, droll or friendly, was that if you looked at his songs, it was always about bringing people together, giving them love and helping them find the joy that defined his life. Simple stuff, and yet, that’s where it gets tricky. Still, the man who wrote “I Believe In Music” pretty much lived it every single day of his life.\n\nAnd who knows maybe I'll come up with a song\n\nTo make people want to stop all this fussing and fighting\n\nLong enough to sing along\n\nI know there's an angel just for rock 'n rollers\n\nWatching over you and your daddy tonight\n\n-- Steve Earle, “Little Rock & Roller”\n\nJustin Earle never seemed to be afraid of anything. A lanky little boy, he’d turn up sometimes caught on fire and ready to take on the world. By the time, his dad had some success, the dark-headed child with the hubcap eyes that took in everything was immortalized on the second side of the iconic debut Guitar Town.\n\nCaught between Earle’s self-defining declaration “Fearless Heart” and the a capella bluegrass of “On Down The Road,” “Little Rock & Roller” was an aching phone call home. From a payphone somewhere near the Arkansas line. A tiny bit of chanson verité, the erstwhile lullaby – a father stunned his child can answer the phone stumbles into the reality of “I guess I didn’t know you could do that/ Lord help me, have I been gone that long?” – in some ways set Justin Townes Earle’s destiny in motion.\n\nTelling the child not to get his mama, savoring the few stolen minutes before getting back on the bus, Earle absorbs all he can – and tells his son not to be afraid, to get some sleep, to dream and know he’s always loved. Funny how what was once literal can be metaphoric and then literal again.\n\nJustin, with the middle name invoking his father’s mentor and friend Townes Van Zandt, was destined for songs. Even more than the drug addiction he battled from puberty, there were pains in his heart, a joy inside, too, that needed to live in songs. And so, after a few local bands, the inevitable rose – and Justin Townes Earle started carving out a place for himself in the Americana world.\n\nIn 2008, The Good Life appeared on Chicago’s insurrective Bloodshot, home to Robbie Fulks, the Mekons, Alejandro Escovedo, the. Bottle Rockets and Neko Case. Stark, it featured Dustin Welch, Chris Scuggs and a very young Amanda Shires on the cover. But just as his father reset Nashville with his bulked-up blue collar rock-country, JTE turpentined everything down to the essence – and wrote a record that. was lonely, broken, hopeful and a bit brash.\n\nThat old school charm –chartered in part by Mississippi roots master R.S. Field -- offered an almost time warping trip into ‘50s/’60s taverns where Wurlitzer jukeboxes reigned and the Opry was something people waited for on Saturday night radio’s across the Midwest and Southeast.\n\nA charming record, it introduced a young man with a lot of baggage, two big names to carry around and a musicologist’s sense of what he wanted to embrace – and. where he wanted to go. There was a Dickensian (Charles, but also Jim) innocence to the young man who’d already. OD’d five times – and. had lived to tell, not brag.\n\nLong legs demi-tucked up and sprawling out under the table of the funky sports bar in East Nashville, on the verge of leaving for the first tour for his first album, we laughed about the déjà vu and the inevitability of it all. Hard to believe the child I’d first met during the sessions for his father’s Exit Zero, the follow-up to Guitar Town, was embarking on the same dream.\n\nHarder still to believe, in a true Ecclesiastes manner, I profiling Justin for The Los Angeles Times, the same way I’d written his father’s first national piece for Tower Pulse all those years ago. We laughed about that, about feeling old, sometimes lost and out of place, but knowing that fate understands what we all merely tilt at.\n\nWe talked about the life he’d led, the drugs, the street running, the bad company, the broken heart, the lost child and always the hope. Music and addiction give that to you, but the talent – that’s something you have to home. There’s no genius pass when you’re a songwriter, no “just let it fly” when you were raised around the kinds of artists and music JTE was.\n\nHe won the Americana Music Association’s 2009 Best New/Emerging Artist. He showed up in Billy Reid, looking every bit the dapper young artist on the rise in a red velvet suit, closely tailored and retro enough to mirror his sound.\n\nHis manager Tracy Thomas, who’d worked for E-Squared when Steve and Jack Emerson founded a small label, looked every bit the proud mama. Known for her tenacity and ability to soothe troubled souls, the woman who’s gone on to manage Jason Isbell and was a force in the Drive-By Truckers’ world, Thomas was midwifing a tender heart who wrote with empathy and the cracked determination of an empty generation seeking their place.\n\nMidnight at the Movies and the gospel-flecked Harlem River Blues continued the walk-about through roots, influences and old school aesthetics. Like Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Justin understood how to make the antique contemporary, to create a vital sense of now out of something that was so lovingly out of time.\n\nHe struggled, too. Yes, he won at 2011 Americana Music Award for Best Song for “Harlem River Blues,” hair parted down the middle like Alfalfa from “The Little Rascals,” round glasses and that scarecrow body. Looking as much Dust Bowl chic as hipster nerd, it seemed Justin was finding a way to be his own man. even if the white-knuckle whispers suggested his demons were always close by.\n\nStill, Justin had that angel quality that made people root for him. Calling from Denmark for a story about Children of the Credibility Revolution, he was thoughtful, disarmingly honest, willing – perhaps too willing -- to talk about the misadventures that were as Earlean as the prodigious gifts of writing and culling music at the source.\n\nWhen Nothing’s Gonna Change The Way You Feel About Me Now, an album he’d been flirting with when we’d talked, arrived, it was a naked sort of wrestle that reckoned and buckled under the truth of how we mess our lives up. That was Justin’s native ground: loneliness, broken hearts, abandonment, yearning, alienation and always the way shadows inevitably creep up on you.\n\nThat sadness and the shuddered off sense of “I’m okay” permeated so much of the music, the kid whose looks were as much Hank Williams Senior as they suggested his own parents offered a refuge for anyone battling disappointment. Listening to Justin Earle, you didn’t feel so alone in your alone. Someone else had been there, his songs suggested, and knew the pain; but also lived to tell, to conjure these soft melodies, these words to let you know you’d make it.\n\nOnly somehow, Justin never quite got to the other side. Always slip-ups, backslides, missing chunks. Ultimately, a man’s choices are his own. Justin knew that, too\n\n“Look, I was 20 years old, a junkie on the street,” he said all those years ago. “If you don’t think that’s a dose of reality...I. figured out pretty quick that nothing’s owed me cause of the name I carry.\n\n“Sure, it may get the door open, but then it’s a pretty heavy door, cause it comes with expectations. I’m not intimidated by [the name]... And I’ve always been a fighter – I’ve got the. two fake front teeth to prove it -- so I’m not worried about it.”\n\nSingle Mothers and Absent Fathers followed four albums for Bloodshot. Recorded for emo/punk powerhouse indie Vagrant, the two-album song cycle explored that legacy, the wounding and also the marks left. Like everything, there was room on the tracks to let the light come in and the pain out.\n\nBy the time Justin landed on New West, Kids In The Street had a joie du something. Always one to find the bright in the dark, Earle seemed to be seeking a new kind of joy. On the verge of parenthood, perhaps there was a turn. As much a love letter to the scrappy Nashville where he grew up, one of the first razed areas in Nashville’s gentrification, its sweetness outstripped everything. Fatherhood can do that for you.\n\nStill, for all the crossed fingers and held breath, all the second chances and nine lives lived, there was a fragility to Justin that underscored everything. Not quite Jeff Buckley, he understood that the brittle places are the ones that made us precious – and in that, in those songs, perhaps he forged the thing that had gone unstated. His art was not washed in brio, even when he brought bravado to the table – and that allowed the disaffected, the uncertain, the depressed and rejected a comfort and even a bit of dignity.\n\nThat his last project was The Saint of Lost Causes seems prescient in the rearview. Evocative, vibey, it pulled you in, twisted his sense of historic, all those influences, he invoked a white working class blues with guitar tones that buzzed and churned inside. He took on truths for the losers, the poor, the cast off, pulled songs out of disparate genres and always put his own sad-eyed self out there.\n\nA gamut run, The Saint of Lost Causes surveyed all the things he’d explored. “Appalachia Nightmare” was raw knuckled Winters Bone kinda stuff, while the acoustic juke of “Don’t Drink the Water” impaled the toxic waters of Flint, Michigan balanced by the must live euphoria of the rockabilly “Flint City Shake It.” There was the atmospheric of “Memphis in the Morning,” a shuffling minimal blues street corner invitation “Say Baby” and the steel-guitar’n’cocktail drum kit self-reckoner “Talking To Myself” to offer the phases and stages of one man trying to move through the world.\n\nTragedy, triumph, torment. At 38, Justin Earle was too young to be gone. Yet at 38, it’s almost a miracle there were this many years, this many records and songs. Still...\n\nWhen the social media posts went up, because that’s what we do, someone drew on what was perhaps the best unintended elegy from his catalogue for. his official platforms. Always restless, always seeking, he summed his life up perfectly.\n\n“I've crossed oceans\n\nFought freezing rain and blowing sand\n\nI've crossed lines and roads and wondering rivers\n\nJust looking for a place to land...”\n\nNo cause of death was given, maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe all that matters is that he lived...\n\nToday, tears and songs are all that’s left. For all the people who loved him, the ones closest and two rings out, it’s unthinkable – and for those of us, even those who were the occasional beneficiaries of his conversations and his smiles, there’s the jarring notion of how temporal all this is.\n\nIt was cold, steely but not metal. It swirled and encircled you like a cartoon vine, only it was staccato – and the beat was so evident. A tension to it, a tautness that put you on edge, even as you leaned into it. And that sangfroid vocalist, slightly whiny, absolutely penetrating, higher register than Lou Reed, yet just as disaffected.\n\nWhen “Let the Good Times Roll” poured out of the crappy school car station wagon’s speakers, it still grabbed you by the ears, or the throat, or the heart. Nothing sounded like it. Punk was more fractious. Rock was more bloated. Pop was more hyper. Disco was, well, more shiny.\n\nLike Goldie Locks, this – whatever it was – was just right. Terse, hip, cool – and yes, romantic even its alienation. As a kid raised on Holden Caulfield, this singer was new wave perfection.\n\nAnd, as Kid Leo throatily told us, he and his partner in the Cars Benjamin Orr, were from Cleveland. Cleveland, Ohio, the rock & roll capitol of the world, where Alan Freed coined the phrase, Chrissie Hynde got that famed “Precious”-invoked abortion, Joe Walsh and the Raspberries and Pere Ubu and the Dead Boys had come from, had done it again. Only maybe better.\n\nRic Ocasek (oh-KASS-eck) was the praying mantis of rock: tall, thin, long limbs, hidden behind dark glasses with the most amazing structured hair cut. Never menacing or cruel, only wickedly cool and somehow removed from all the trivial things that hung up so many other odd balls and weirdos.\n\nWeirdos, yes, the mainstream preppy kids didn’t get them in their primary colors that suggested Stephen Sprouse, their downtown GQ chic that took the notion of tailoring to a minimalist sense of liquid movement.\n\nMaybe it was because Richard Otcasek was one more too thin ethnic kid in a city born an"
