        "text": "[bell clanging and train sound approaching]\n\nLacy Kowalski: Headwaters is brought to you by the Glacier National Park Conservancy.\n\n[train horn sounds]\n\nDaniel Lombardi: Just about every day I hear the rumble of trains throughout West Glacier. Whether I'm inside or out, the sound of trains punctuate a lot of daily life in Glacier.\n\nMichael Faist: And that line, running along the park's southern boundary, has been in service since the steam engine nearly 130 years ago. And anything with that long of a legacy leaves a mark. Tell me this, Daniel. What do you think the most common name for a business is around here?\n\nDaniel: I feel like Glacier being in the name of a lot of things.\n\nMichael: Yes. There's a lot of businesses named Glacier.\n\nDaniel: Glacier cat groomers, Glacier golf, Glacier gas. There's a bunch.\n\nMichael: So that shouldn't be surprising. But close behind are businesses named Great Northern. There's the Great Northern Veterinary Office, Great Northern Concrete, Great Northern Llama Ranch, close to 40 other businesses that share that name in Flathead County alone. So today our local railroad is serviced by Amtrak and BNSF, or Burlington Northern Santa Fe. But it was their predecessor, the Great Northern Railway, that started it all.\n\nOld Film: [audio sounds crackly and tinny; the narrator’s accent is of the early 1900s] Great Northern skirts the southern boundary, of Glacier Park for 57 miles. [ambient music begins to play in the video] This is Great Northern. Not the railroad or the train, but this car and its contents. A rolling inventory of America's wealth.\n\n[Headwaters season 3 theme begins playing; starting with mandolin]\n\nMichael: My question: who built the Great Northern Railway?\n\n[theme continues; a drumbeat, a flute line, and other instruments come in, before the music finishes]\n\nDaniel: History is shaped by great men wielding absolute power, men with vast vaults of money and epic dreams. Executives. Kings. Presidents. Generals. It is these men who bend the world and shape history into new chapters. The rest of us are mere pawns. Or at least that's how one theory goes. [a subtle electronic beat begins] You're listening to Headwaters, a podcast about how Glacier National Park connects to everything else. This is Season Three: Becoming. It's about the people, the profit margins, and the promises that defined the West before a national park tried to do the same. This episode starts with one of history's great men, James J. Hill, the founder of the Great Northern Railway. He cut a literal line across the country through towns, tribes and the edge of what would become Glacier National Park.\n\nMichael: And in the process became one of the most powerful businessmen of his time, even if it didn't start that way.\n\nDaniel: And you've been looking into that history of the Great Northern, both from the bottom up and the top down.\n\nMichael: Yeah, from a lot of different angles. Working here, you hear about Great Northern all the time. You get to hear a lot about all the things they would go on to do to shape the park. But what I've never understood is how did they get here in the first place? Like who built the Great Northern Railway? And how, after eight years of living here, have I never ridden the train?\n\nDaniel: So where do we start?\n\nMichael: We start at the beginning.\n\nMichael: [to Stephen] Assuming I have never heard of him before, who is J.J. Hill? And why should I know his name?\n\nStephen Sadis: [on the phone] Who is James J. Hill?\n\n[dramatic violin music begins]\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [movie narrator voice] He was known as the Empire Builder and the Devil's Curse. Streets, towns and counties were named in his honor, along with a persistent and invasive weed. He was mythologized in novels and was the subject of folk songs and union battle cries.\n\n[music fades out]\n\nMichael: I called Stephen Sadis, a producer and filmmaker who just finished a four-part docu-series called The Empire Builder: James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway, which you'll be hearing clips of throughout. At just 17 years old, Hill moved from Ontario, where he was born, to Saint Paul, Minnesota. Within 15 years, he went from a job as an entry level bookkeeper to running a warehouse of his own and operating a steamship company. He had made a name for himself.\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [different narrators voice each quote, with fiddle music beneath] Local newspapers took note. \"This remarkable young man has kept accurate statistics for many years of all the freight coming in.\" \"J.J. Hill is prepared to give shippers the lowest rates ever quoted from here to Eastern Points.\" \"He beats all his competitors and in return gets the bulk of the transportation business. When Mr. Hill starts to accomplish a thing, he does it complete.\"\n\nMichael: If you needed to ship something or have something shipped to you, he could do it faster and cheaper than the other guy. He was like Amazon, if they used ox carts and steamboats.\n\nStephen: He had a good reputation. He said what he meant and did what he said and people trusted him.\n\nMichael: [to Stephen] Why did he want—why did he get into the railroad business?\n\nStephen: You know, I think he had visions of a transportation empire. I mean, it's very clear in early Saint Paul history, when the town got its first locomotive, I mean, he was constantly saying to other people what he would do if he would run the line. I mean, it's to the point where people were like, “Yeah, yeah, Jim, we know you'd do a much better job.”\n\nMichael: Hill had an incredible track record for a young entrepreneur. And yet, when he finally bought a small bankrupt railroad and announced his plans to build it all the way to the West, people called him an idiot.\n\nDaniel: I need to know more. Why?\n\nMichael: Well, there were a few reasons. First of all, honestly, he was late to the game. He wanted to build a transcontinental line through Montana and onto the coast. But that line already existed. The Northern Pacific ran through southern Montana, and the Canadian Pacific, just to the north, ran through Alberta.\n\nStephen: So it was a fourth transcontinental that would thread a line between these other two, and it was unnecessary. It was ridiculous.\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [narrator voice with violin music beneath] The New York Times stated that no sane man could think of paralleling these lines without inviting bankruptcy, and dubbed the notion \"Hill's Folly.\"\n\nDaniel: So it sounds like there just wasn't a need, basically. Right.\n\nMichael: Like, the region already has two railroads. Why would it need a third?\n\nDaniel: Yeah.\n\nMichael: But the other reason people called this idea Hill's Folly was the money. Building 3000 miles of railroad isn't cheap, but for a while there, the U.S. government would pay you if you tried.\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [narrator voice with violin music beneath] Lincoln put his pen to the Pacific Railway Act, authorizing the government to offer loans and land grants to railroad owners for every mile of track laid from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMichael: This policy worked. It jumpstarted railroad construction, but it also encouraged railroad companies to game the system, building curvy lines in order to gobble up as much land as possible.\n\nStephen: I mean, really, the real estate business began with the railroads. At one point, the railroads owned like 6% of all the land in the United States, which is, you know, mammoth.\n\nMichael: By the time Hill was getting started, Congress had caught on. They stopped giving out land or loans to railroad companies. And without this assistance, Hill had to find private funding. He had to convince people that this line, which The New York Times was calling a bad idea, was a worthwhile investment.\n\nDaniel: Okay. So what's different here is that all the other railroad companies, they were getting federal aid.\n\nMichael: Right.\n\nDaniel: But Hill, he had to pay his own way for the Great Northern.\n\nMichael: Exactly. And letters from the Times suggest he found raising money to be the hardest part of the job. Networking, schmoozing, owing favors. But it paid off. He sold investors on the idea that his line could be built better and more efficiently than any other.\n\nStephen: His mantra was the lowest grade, least curvature, and shortest distance, and everything banked on that.\n\nMichael: What was next was finding a route that would make that possible.\n\nStephen: As Hill's heading west, he's—he's chosen his route. And it happens that he needs to get through Indian territory.\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [narrator voice, with sad violin music beneath] Beginning in 1851, the Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, River Crow, and Assiniboine were restricted to reservation land that spread across much of Montana territory. But over the course of 30 years, the reservation had been reduced nine times by treaty and executive order.\n\nMichael: But tribal land was still in Hill's way. He couldn't build through the Fort Berthold or Blackfeet reservations in present day North Dakota and Montana without a right of way. So in 1886, he started putting pressure on Congress and the president to open the land.\n\nStephen: Hill was working backchannels in order to get that approval to bring his lines through Indian territory.\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [narrator voice, with sparse guitars strumming beneath] Hill, for his part, was busy writing letters to congressmen. Mr. McGinnis is interested on behalf of his territory in a bill granting right of way to railroads in northern Montana. Any assistance you can render him will be a personal favor to me and to our friends, for which I will be glad at any time to reciprocate. Yours very truly, James J. Hill.\n\n[pensive music begins to play]\n\nMichael: Ultimately, it worked. They passed a bill that granted Hill a right of way, but it wasn't a permission slip through tribal lands. It required tribes already reeling from famine to give up a massive amount of reservation land, an area almost equivalent to the state of South Carolina. Here's Lea Whitford, a former Montana state senator and Blackfeet tribal member that Stephen interviewed to get the Blackfeet perspective on Hill blazing his railroad through Montana.\n\nLea Whitford: [speaking slowly, emotionally; flute music plays beneath] The 1888 agreement that came, well that was just right after the starvation winter. You have hundreds of people that are dying. You have leaders that have to make some real hard decisions. And what do we have of value? And so you have land. The Blackfeet are open to it because they have no choice.\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [dramatic narrator voice] The tribes living on the Blackfeet and Fort Berthold reservations accepted the terms drastically reducing their territory by 19.5 million acres.\n\nMichael: While many are quick to celebrate Hill's efforts to privately finance the railroad, the highest price paid for his progress wasn't a financial one.\n\n[pause]\n\nMichael: In September of the next year, Hill would change the name of his business to the Great Northern Railway. That November, Montana became a state. And the month after that, surveyor John F Stevens, located Marias Pass, the lowest elevation crossing of the continental divide between Canada and New Mexico, and Hill's ticket to the Pacific Coast.\n\nStephen: That at least ensures Hill that he can get through the Rockies, not without enormous difficulty in construction, but there is a pass that is manageable in its elevation gain. And that sort of is the first piece in the puzzle.\n\nMichael: The section of track that today borders the southern tip of Glacier was the proof Hill needed that his plan would work. By 1891, juggling an incredible amount of materials, manpower and unpredictable terrain, he laid rails over the Rockies, closing the distance on his transcontinental line.\n\nStephen: You know, you're talking about bringing thousands of railroad ties and tons of rails. It's like those cartoons where Daffy Duck is riding on the locomotive and he's laying down track in front of him. And it's not a whole lot different than that. [train on track noises begin and build] And so you have these 8000 men and 6000 animals, and you have to feed them, and you have to house them, and you have to take care of all sort of maladies that occur and injuries and whatnot. I mean, it's it's—it's like a mobile town that is building this line. It's an amazing achievement.\n\n[train whistle sounds]\n\nEmpire Builder Documentary: [narrator voice, guitar music begins to play] On January 6th, 1893, just west of the town of Scenic Washington, the eastern and western sections of the Great Northern Railway were connected. As two superintendents took turns driving home the final spike, revolvers shot into the air [gunshots; cheering] amid the cheers of 200 rail workers. It was a moment that crystallized Hill's longtime dream of a transcontinental railway of his own.\n\nMichael: It is hard to understand today how much Great Northern and railroads like it transformed the country. If you wanted to get from one side of the country to the other in 1800, it took maybe 4 to 6 months, either by arduous wagon trip or by sailing all the way around South America. In 1893, you can make the same trip by rail in less than a week. It's infiltrated our vocabulary in ways that I never really thought about, like \"blowing off steam\" might seem obvious, that's an expression from steam engines. But sidetracked, backtracked, even switchbacks, which I think of as being a trail thing, that's a train thing. And just the massive power that these lines had to dictate the future of a place. Like when Hill was building into the Flathead Valley, he had the choice to build south towards the first and largest town in the Flathead Valley, which was called Demersville. It had churches, banks, newspapers, over a thousand people. But Hill decided instead to found his own town just to the north, which he named Kalispell. Kalispell is the county seat today, and all that remains of Demersville is a cemetery. Great Northern transformed the landscape as it went and transformed Hill from the son of Irish farmers into one of the richest men alive, earning him the nickname the Empire Builder.\n\nStephen: You have this transformative technology that is making millionaires every week. I mean, it's not a whole lot different than when the internet emerged. He was enormously wealthy. He was at one time the third and another time the tenth wealthiest man in the country.\n\nMichael: James J. Hill embodied what many people see as the American dream, the promise that you can achieve the impossible if you put in the work. And when we look back at this era of transcontinental railroads, it's often with pride, admiring everything our nation accomplished in spite of all the obstacles. [pensive electronic music begins] Take, for example, a speech in 1969. Secretary of Transportation John Volpe went to speak at a celebration -- the 100th anniversary of the very first transcontinental railroad. Here's what he said.\n\nVoice Actor: [authoritatively, dramatically] Who else but Americans could drill ten tunnels in mountains three feet deep in snow? Who else but Americans could chisel through miles of solid granite? Who else but Americans could have laid ten miles of track in 12 hours?\n\nMichael: He either didn't know or didn't share the answer to his own question.\n\n[music ends, setting off the following line dramatically]\n\nVoice Actor: [with echo beneath] Who else but Americans?\n\n[street noise]\n\nMichael: 30 minutes outside of Glacier sits the town of Whitefish, another town that Great Northern put on the map. And early on, it was home to a lot of great northern employees. I went to Whitefish this summer in search of a historic plaque.\n\nMichael: [in the field; church bells clanging in the background] I think that’s it! Right on the corner.\n\nMichael: Not long after the Great Northern Railway announced its plans for a division point in Whitefish. Whitefish had its first church. I don't know about you, but I love reading plaques like this. I've seen them all over the country—sometimes bronze, sometimes silver, always with some interesting context about the place I'm visiting. And yet I somehow didn't know that my own employer manages this program. A guy named Paul oversees the state of Montana.\n\nPaul Lusignan: [on the phone] My name is Paul Lusignan. I'm a historian with the National Register of Historic Places Program within the National Park Service.\n\nMichael: I could tell you that at the time of this recording, there are 63 different national parks. But I didn't know until this year that a small team of Park Service employees helps preserve over 90,000 small sites like this all over the country. What is the National Register program? If you had to describe it.\n\nPaul: It is largely an honorary program, but it's a list of properties, cultural resources that are worthy of preservation.\n\nMichael: Paul said \"honorary\" because listing something on the register doesn't freeze it in time. You can still make changes to a building, for example, but it helps ensure that federally funded projects minimize their impact on our shared history.\n\nPaul: They have to review whether it will impact historic buildings or historic resources, the same way they have to take into account endangered species or water conservation.\n\nMichael: The Register is a record of sites like this church that have historical significance and helps them share their story.\n\nMichael: [in the field, reading the plaque; church bells clanging and street noise in the background] The committee chose a Romanesque revival style considered less ostentatious, masonry construction, heavily arched windows.\n\nMichael: Nominations are collected by states and tribes who send them to Paul and his boss, who just might have the coolest sounding job title in the National Park Service: the Keeper of the National Register.\n\nPaul: The Keeper has designated authority to me to list properties in the National Register. And this comes back to the good old days when the National Register was actually a book.\n\nMichael: [laughing] A literal book!\n\nPaul: It was a green book in which you opened the cover you wrote in the name of the property and the date of listing, and then you shut the book and it was listed in the National Register.\n\nMichael: But the whole process begins at the ground level. Anyone can identify something of historical value in their community and nominate it for listing. You could if you wanted to. That's how this church in Whitefish wound up on the register. Congregation members led the charge, and that's how I learned about the railroad history preserved in their stained glass windows.\n\n[greetings, church bells, street noise]\n\nPaul Hayden: Good morning.\n\nMichael: [in the field] Morning.\n\nPaul: You coming in here?\n\nMichael: [in the field] I am.\n\nMichael: I was actually invited in for a visit and was greeted by interim pastor Paul Hayden.\n\nPaul: Paul Hayden. Bob's right here.\n\nBob Paulus: Hello! You're Mike?\n\nMichael: [in the field] Michael, yep.\n\nMichael: And congregation members Bob Paulus and Jesse Fraser.\n\nMichael: [in the field] Where are we right now?\n\nJessie Fraser: First Presbyterian Church of Whitefish, Whitefish Montana.\n\nMichael: [in the field] Since this is all audio, would you mind describing the windows?\n\nBob: Describing ‘em?\n\nMichael: [in the field] What do they look like? How tall are they?\n\nBob: Oh, I don't know the dimensions.\n\nMichael: [in the field] Oh just eyeball it, doesn't need to be exact.\n\nBob: They're absolutely wonderful, beautiful… I don't know. [laughing]\n\nJessie: They're Tiffany style.\n\nBob: There you go.\n\nPaul: 14 feet wide by six feet across.\n\nJessie: Oh, wow. I knew you came along for a reason. [everyone laughing]\n\nPaul: From a minister’s standpoint, you'll notice that the pews are looking away from the windows, which I am very grateful for. [all laughing] Yeah you know, you're sitting there in church and being distracted—look, it's hard enough to keep people's attention as it is.\n\nMichael: Each pair of windows was donated by local community members during the building's construction in 1921. And reading the dedications is a regular who's who of early Whitefish. There are prominent bankers and early loggers…\n\nJessie: They all put money in towards these windows. Special.\n\n[pensive music begins to play]\n\nMichael: But the pair of windows that brought me in read, \"with gratitude from the Japanese.\"\n\nBob: And the Japanese said $705 for two windows.\n\nMichael: More than $8500 today—a small fortune—donated by Japanese men who worked for Great Northern. Men James J. Hill hired to realize his dream. And men I'd never heard of before.\n\nVoice Actor: [echoing] Who else but Americans.\n\n[music ends]\n\nLucas Hugie: [on the phone] So they would hire whoever would be willing to work for the company, including Irish immigrants or recent immigrants.\n\nMichael: To get some context, I turned to another national park site, Golden Spike National Historical Park.\n\nLucas: So we're located in Box Elder County in northern Utah, and it's where the first Transcontinental Railroad was completed on May 10th, 1869.\n\nMichael: This is Lucas.\n\nLucas: Lucas Hugie. I'm the lead park ranger here at Golden Spike National Historical Park.\n\nMichael: And I called him because the first Transcontinental Railroad, finished years before J.J. Hill joined the railroad business, set a precedent that everyone building out west would follow. They figured out who to hire.\n\nLucas: So you have people coming into the country, and they're not really anchored to any part of the country yet. And so when they find out that there's a chance to work on the railroad, make decent wages, they're willing to sign on for that.\n\nMichael: Irish, German and Italian immigrants were laying the tracks westward from Iowa alongside Civil War veterans and recently emancipated Black Americans. But the Central Pacific, who was building east from Sacramento, they were having a hard time keeping anyone on the payroll.\n\nLucas: Every time that there was a gold strike somewhere, this workforce would disappear. These guys would, as soon as they got paid, walk off the job and go try their luck in the gold fields.\n\nMichael: The promise of the gold rush drew thousands of people to California, including some of the first Chinese immigrants to the United States. Thousands of Chinese men emigrated to the U.S., but they weren't provided the same opportunity as other miners. Panic and prejudice among white Americans led to the passage of a foreign miners tax.\n\nLucas: And if you're a foreigner, specifically a foreigner from China, you actually could be taxed up to $20 a month to stake a gold mining claim.\n\nMichael: Nearly $800 a month today. And so men who had crossed the Pacific in search of a better life instead found themselves stuck working someone else's claim for a fraction of the payout. Meanwhile, Central Pacific is desperate to end labor shortage and decide to hire 50 Chinese workers as a trial run.\n\nLucas: They ended up being fantastic workers because they didn't walk off the job at the end of the day when there was a gold mining strike.\n\nMichael: Chinese men would soon make up most of the workforce on the Central Pacific, and as it turns out, the railroad also appreciated these workers because they could get away with paying them less.\n\nLucas: So you're looking at around $26 a month for, for these guys. The Union Pacific provided room and board for their workers. Whereas the Central Pacific, they just kind of let the Chinese fend for themselves. They had to pay for their own board or like wherever they're going to be sleeping. And they also had to pay for their own food.\n\nMichael: As many as 20,000 Chinese laborers went on to help build the first transcontinental railroad. And this hiring practice became a template for other railroads building in the West.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating; Chinese string instruments playing in the background] The railroads needed workers and the Chinese needed jobs.\n\nMichael: That voice, who you might recognize as George Takei, is from a documentary called From the Far East to the Old West, produced by the University of Montana.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating; Chinese string instruments playing in the background] Few people realize that Chinese labor made up most of the workforce on key sections of the Northern Pacific Railroad.\n\nMichael: In the face of backbreaking labor and deadly work with explosives, Chinese immigrant laborers were reliable and most importantly, in the railroad’s eyes, they were cheap. Which brings us back to Great Northern. Hill had recruited a lot of Scandinavian and German immigrants to help build his main line. But after the initial phase of construction, those employees either began to quit or ask for more money. This is where the other Western railroads turned to Chinese labor. But by the time Hill arrived in the West, the practice of hiring cheap Chinese workers, often in the place of white laborers who demanded higher pay, had driven loud and public anti-Chinese racism.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating, with other voices reading the quotes with crowd noise in the background; Chinese string instruments playing in the background] One especially lengthy and venomous commentary in the Missoula Gazette argued, \"Our government erred in never allowing that race a foothold on our soil.” “They have, in Missoula as elsewhere, usurped places which could be filled by respectable men. And the time has come when measures should be taken to rid ourselves of this past, lest it destroy us. Resolved!\"\n\nMichael: This sentiment led to the passage of more anti-Chinese legislation and the first significant law restricting immigration to the United States.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating; Chinese string instruments playing in the background] The most far reaching was the 1882 Exclusion Act, which prohibited immigration by Chinese laborers and their families.\n\nMichael: Hill, arriving after the passage of the Exclusion Act, had to look elsewhere.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating; string instruments plucking in the background] But those railroads still wanted cheap labor with their supply of Chinese laborers cut off. The railroad barons once again looked across the Pacific to fill their needs, this time to Japan.\n\nLinda Tamura: [on the phone] And actually the Japanese government was encouraging young Japanese men to go overseas to gain jobs.\n\nMichael: That voice is Linda Tamura.\n\nLinda: I'm Linda Tamura. I'm a proud orchard kid from Hood River, Oregon. I'm also a former elementary teacher and professor emerita of education at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon.\n\nMichael: Who I called to ask about Issei.\n\nMichael: [to Linda] You know, for people who've never heard the term before. Could you describe what you say means?\n\nLinda: Sure. They say we're the first generation of Japanese immigrants to the United States in Japanese. Ichi means one and sei means generation. So from ichi-sei we have Issei -- the first generation. My grandparents and their contemporaries.\n\nMichael: [to Linda] How did you first learn about early Issei laborers in the U.S.?\n\nLinda: I didn’t learn about Issei laborers from my grandparents or from other Japanese Americans, or even in high school or even college, because I learned about Western civilizations and Western immigrants. But in the early 1980s, my uncle suggested that I ask questions of my grandmother, Asio Nogi. She was in her eighties. Uncle Mam told me, \"your grandma lived a really interesting life—came to the United States to marry your grandfather. She's still got a great memory, and she tells great stories. So why don't you talk to her?\" Well, I did. My mom translated because Grandma spoke Japanese and I didn't. And Grandma began to tell me a little bit about her life, her immigration to the United States when she was 19 years old. I learned about Grandpa, their labor.\n\nMichael: What began as a conversation with her grandmother turned into a project to document the experience of other Issei laborers—people at the bottom, not the top, of this railroad history.\n\nLinda: My appetite was whetted, I wanted to learn more.\n\nMichael: Linda described Japanese immigration to the U.S. as a push and a pull. And the pull came from U.S. companies like Great Northern—\n\nLinda: And the push came from Japan.\n\nMichael: You could find ads in Japanese newspapers titled How to Succeed in America.\n\nLinda: They told us that Issei laborers could earn twice as much money in the United States as they might have in Japan. Some of the laborers who had gone to the United States came back and they were wearing suits and pretending that they were fairly wealthy. And even some of the young Issei whom I interviewed told me that that tantalized them.\n\nMichael: Japan had maintained a policy of isolation for centuries, but in the 1880s, Japan's new government began allowing its citizens to seek jobs abroad.\n\nLinda: The goal was that they would go to the United States. They would work for 3 to 5 years, earn enough money to come back and live comfortable lives in Japan. They became known as Birds of Passage. Those who are looking for ways to get rich quick.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating; string instruments playing in the background] By 1910, tens of thousands of Japanese had left their homeland seeking opportunities in the United States.\n\nMichael: Great Northern contracted with the Oriental Trading Company, a Japanese owned business based in Seattle, which organized Issei labor contracts and sent thousands of Issei to Montana.\n\nLinda: My grandfather was one of those. When he was 16 years old, his uncle was working in the United States and called him over to join him. Grandpa came over and his first job was actually working on a railroad crew in Cut Bank, Montana in Glacier County.\n\nMichael: Cut Bank is a small town, even today, on the east side of the Rockies, less than 50 miles from Glacier and more than 5000 from Japan.\n\nLinda: He was a hard worker. Even as an elderly man, he was a hard worker. And my grandmother told me that Grandpa's supervisors on the railroad would reward him with overtime labor.\n\nMichael: In 1901, a day's wage for Issei was $1.10, and a day's work could be 15 hours. Not to mention, their contractor, the Oriental Trading Company, would take a ten cent daily commission.\n\nLinda: The work was difficult and the pay was low. But the reason they accepted that was because it turned out it was double what they might have earned in Japan.\n\nMichael: [to Linda] So that wasn't false advertising on the newspaper's part. It was more than they would've made\n\nLinda: It was, right.\n\nMichael: But while the pay was better than what they might have received in Japan, conditions were still terrible.\n\nLinda: One story that I heard over and over was how malnourished they were. They had to pay a stipend for the meals that they were served. And some of them, because they were trying to save money, really almost starved themselves to increase their savings. And the meals were really paltry. Two meals that I heard about a lot were soups. One was miso soup. And that's made from soybean paste. And another was dango jiru, which was dumpling soup.\n\nMichael: I googled it for reference. One serving of miso soup has 40 calories. A banana has 105.\n\nLinda: With all the hard labor working 10 to 15 hour days, they had very little protein. And so apparently when they were able to find a jackrabbit or a cow that had been killed by the train, that was a banquet.\n\nMichael: [to Linda] Oh, my goodness, I bet.\n\nLinda: And apparently sometimes the men were even known to have arranged for a cow to be present on the tracks when a railroad train went by.\n\nMichael: Employees were required to dispose of any animals they came across that had been hit by the train.\n\nLinda: And so the section hands obediently did so. And then at night they'd go back and they'd dig up the carcass and they'd cook it, and then they had a source of protein. But those were the lengths they took to try to nourish themselves, doing hard labor on the railroad front.\n\nMichael: [to Linda] I can't imagine trying to do that on, you know, just soup -- like miso soup alone.\n\nLinda: Right, yeah. What a life.\n\nMichael: Many Issei who came to the US as Birds of Passage, hoping one day to return home started to realize that might never happen.\n\nLinda: So after my grandfather had been here, I think he was 32. He, along with other Issei men, began to realize their dreams of returning to Japan and—and be wealthy men were not to be realized, and that they would end up working longer in the United States, and they might even become residents.\n\nMichael: And so many Issei who had planned to work in the U.S. for 3 to 5 years started planning to spend a life here and wanted to find someone to share it with.\n\nLinda: They often didn't have enough money to go back to Japan to find wives. And so they employed picture brides.\n\nLinda: [excerpt from interview in documentary] The picture bride or shashin hanyome was the practice where a Japanese man in America exchanged photographs and letters with young women and their families in Japan. And through that exchange of letters and photographs and agreements by the families, they were formally married.\n\nLinda: And my grandmother was a picture bride when she came to the United States in 1916, 16 years after my grandfather had arrived.\n\nMichael: Not all Issei worked on railroads. Many worked on farms or in lumber mills. But no matter the job, they all faced the reality of life in a new place.\n\nLinda: They were young. Often they found that they were living in secluded areas. There were a lot of people who lived nearby, and certainly not a lot who spoke their language. Life was disappointing for them, although they weren't always ready to admit that easily.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating with string music in the background; an actor reads the quote] December 1905 Henry Katsuji Hasitani, who worked for the Northern Pacific near Missoula, wrote in his diary, \"all I have done so far is to survive as nothing more than a humble worker, like pigs and cows. Is my youth being wasted? No. I have dreams. I have hopes. Life is nothing if you don't try to better yourself.\"\n\nLinda: They had high dreams and high hopes, but often they were shattered.\n\nMichael: On top of the hard work, low pay, and isolation, Issei began to face discrimination from white Americans. Just like the Chinese before them.\n\nLinda: Apparently there were Issei who were working for the railroad, living in a house. There were six of them. [Ominous electric guitar music builds] And one night there were shots that rang through their windows and rioters stood outside for an hour and yelled and cursed at them. The Issei men piled up mattresses to try to protect themselves.\n\nMichael: It was a scare tactic, a gunpowder threat to leave town.\n\n[music ends]\n\nLinda: The next day they left and that was the goal. Apparently the rioters were farmers who during their offseason were hired by the railroad as section hands and they were concerned that their livelihoods might be in danger. That was the kind of incident that occurred along the West Coast and very likely in Montana as well, that other workers were concerned about the competition from Issei, who were willing to work long hours, take on jobs that others might not have relished and were willing to work for less pay because they considered the pay adequate. But yes, discrimination was—was an issue for the Issei laborers.\n\nMichael: An opinion piece in the Kalispell Bee, the newspaper in the early 1900s. Argued that these Japanese laborers weren't buying enough local goods, they were a drain on the local economy and used all sorts of racist terms along the way. And then, you know, the next week in the paper, the Oriental Trading Company would reply like, we buy everything locally except for miso soup, which isn't made here. And in looking through all these accounts, at no point did it seem like Great Northern ever stepped in and tried to advocate for its employees. Here's Stephen Sadis again.\n\nStephen: Yeah, I don't think there was any grander plan for Hill in how to, you know, keep the peace or acclimate an ethnic group into a community. I think he was looking at bottom lines and what's the—the most inexpensive way I can build my line.\n\nMichael: This discrimination wasn't unique to Asian immigrants. Irish, Italian, Greek laborers, Slavic laborers, among others, were met with racial slurs, politically charged vitriol in communities and in local papers. This wasn't an outlier, but a clear and consistent pattern. But U.S. legislation uniquely targeted immigrants from Asian countries.\n\nLinda: There was a concern about the yellow peril, that, Chinese at first, and then Japanese, would be threatening the white race.\n\nMichael: Understanding what had happened with the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Japanese government, facing pressure from the United States, signed the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907.\n\nLinda: The Gentlemen's Agreement restricted Japanese immigration only to family members of those who were already in the United States.\n\nMichael: No more Issei could immigrate to the U.S., and the ones who were already here continued to face prejudice.\n\nFar East to Old West Documentary: [George Takei narrating with string music in the background] Asians still couldn't become citizens unless they were born here. And in 1923, anti-Japanese legislators passed a Montana law that said If you couldn't become a citizen, you couldn't own land.\n\nMichael: But while policies and prejudice would continue to make life difficult for Issei, others embraced their Japanese neighbors.\n\nElizabeth Peck (voice actor): I'll tell you what I do with my time when I'm not cooking meals at 12:00 in the morning and washing socks.\n\nMichael: This is a letter written by Elizabeth Peck, a Whitefish woman who in the 1920s was a member of the Presbyterian Church of Whitefish, and it's being read for us by a voice actor.\n\nElizabeth: I took, for my part of the work in the church, the Japanese. [soft string music plays in the background] We have 14 families and 50 single men. They work for the railroad, most of them. I teach them to talk English, read and write it. And if I do say it, I've accomplished it. I never hoped to do so well when I started.\n\nMichael: Elizabeth wasn't a wealthy woman or a philanthropist. Here's Jessie Fraser, one of the congregation members who met me at the church.\n\nJessie: She was very poor. She had two boys. She—her husband died when the kids were very young. So she lived in a tar paper shack thing out someplace.\n\nElizabeth: I have three classes at the house and then I go twice a week to their homes. That is the ones that have children and can't come to me.\n\nJessie: And the Japanese would give her gifts to get her food. You know, gifts of food, chicken and eggs and things like that. Because she just—and thank you for doing what she was doing.\n\nElizabeth: One month I helped one man to buy a house, helped to bury one man that was drowned, and helped two babies into the world.\n\nMichael: And even though these events took place over 100 years ago, this kindness is still visible.\n\nElizabeth: We built a new church this year, cost $40,000, and I asked for a donation of the Japanese men, said it would be nice if they could give a window. Well, they sent in a check for $705, bought two windows. And when the windows came, one of them said, for Mrs. Elizabeth D. Peck, from the Japanese. What an honor to live up to.\n\nMichael: The Japanese families and men of Whitefish collected $705, over $8,000 today, and donated two pairs of windows to the church. One pair was dedicated to Elizabeth Peck and the other simply says, \"with gratitude from the Japanese.\" Because of Great Northern, Whitefish was home to a thriving Japanese community—a community that included railroad laborers, but also the owners of a candy store, a successful laundromat, and what many accounts described as the best restaurant in town. A community that was asked to put on a firework display for the 4th of July 1909, which one newspaper called the finest pyrotechnic display the county had ever seen. A community that largely isn't here anymore. Those businesses have closed. Those Issei have passed away. And their children, for the most part, have moved on. This history isn't easy to find.\n\nLinda: It's important for us to understand what they contributed, how they contributed, and the sacrifices that they made in order to help themselves. But even more so, to help our country. They were important contributors to the United States of America, even though they weren't treated fairly during their times.\n\nMichael: When I asked Linda why it's so hard to track down these stories, she pointed me to her grandmother.\n\nLinda: It came to me that Grandma didn't want to consider herself important enough to be interviewed by someone. She told me, \"I'm just a poor old woman. I've not done anything significant in my life. Now, if you want to interview someone important, go talk to Eleanor Roosevelt. Now, there's a woman who should be interviewed.\" But she said “there's nothing that I've done in my life that's important. You shouldn't ask me questions.” That would signify what every Issei told me. They wanted to focus on the group. And I would think that might have a lot to do with why you're having difficulty with stories, too.\n\nMichael: Mmhmm.\n\nLinda: And I think there are other reasons, though. They spoke Japanese, they wrote in Japanese. Any documents I found, any photos with inscriptions needed to be translated by those who spoke old Japanese. And there aren't that many—that many anymore now. In many ways, I think they don't want to harbor on the difficulties of the past. Now that they were finally getting along with others, their neighbors, they didn't want to bring up difficulties. [pensive music begins to play] So they really chose not to speak about the past. They wanted to leave it there. They wanted to move on and focus on positive. Unfortunately, yeah, there's a lot that we've lost, but hopefully there will be photos and documents that will help us to uncover more of those stories.\n\n[music ends]\n\nMichael: Linda highlighting how much of this history we've lost—it made me grateful for the National Register of Historic Places, a tool that helps communities preserve and share the history they have left. I ran this by Paul Lusignan, the historian from the Register program.\n\nMichael: [to Paul] and just thinking through this story, I learned about the history of these Japanese railroad laborers through the Register listing for this church in Whitefish. And it got me thinking that, you know, when I come to Glacier, a million acres, this grand place, you kind of implicitly expect to hear the stories of like grand people, too. And that the register seems to me like a way of preserving the stories that might not fit into that expectation to you. How does the Register complement the other parts of the National Park Service in pursuit of our mission?\n\nPaul Lusignan: I think you hit the nail on the head. I mean, it allows for kind of different perspectives and looking at the full story. You know, there's only so many times you can mention that Theodore Roosevelt came out here and stayed for a while. It's like, okay, if the Park Service is supposed to be conveying a preservation and conservation ethic, well, what types of things are we conserving, protecting and recognizing? What was it like to be a worker there? Who did they displace when they developed the park? There's nothing wrong with the big ingrained resources. They're great and they deserve to be preserved, but they don't tell the full story. And that's where I think that the Register program helps augment that and can augment that. And that's again, it's not the only tool, but it is a good preservation tool.\n\nMichael: One example is the First Presbyterian Church of Whitefish. As it approached 100 years old, the building was showing its age.\n\n[wistful music begins to build]\n\nJessie: It literally was falling down. And you could see I mean, we’re outside—you look up there and you could literally see the bricks separating from the wall, you know, like it's going to come down.\n\nMichael: One suggestion was to sell the valuable downtown real estate and move the congregation to a new and improved building. But they decided instead to repair—in large part because of the building's history. Little things that don't show up on your property value, but they do show up on your National Register listing.\n\nJessie: Because it's a historical church.\n\nMichael: And so one of the few pieces left of this Montana Issei community is protected. Not only are the windows still there, but people like Jessie will welcome you in and share their story.\n\n[music ends]\n\n[an electronic beat begins, with an excerpt from the early 1900s promo video we heard at the beginning of the episode. The lyrics say \"The railroad is many things. The Empire Builder.\"]\n\nMichael: To end this story, I wanted to do something that I've never done before.\n\nGaby Eseverri: [in the field] Are you excited?\n\nMichael: [in the field] I'm excited, I've never ridden the train before. Unless you count the one at my zoo growing up. But that was like a small fake train.\n\nMichael: I was joined by Gaby.\n\nGaby: There it is!\n\n[train whistle, and bell clanging as it arrives]\n\nMichael: After spending the entire summer digging into the history of this railway, I thought it would be fitting to actually ride it.\n\nGaby: There aren’t too many people here.\n\nRailroad worker: Last name guys?\n\nMichael: Faist and Eseverri.\n\nRailroad worker: I got you. You guys are good to go. Great.\n\nGaby: All righty. Thank you so much.\n\nRailroad worker: You bet.\n\nMichael: [in the field] I’m not the tallest person in the world, but I can stretch my legs out completely before it hits the other seat.\n\nGaby: Yeah. It’s comfortable.\n\nMichael: In this episode, I set out to answer the question, who built the Great Northern Railway, and looked at the story from the top down and bottom up. If I'm being honest, you could probably guess which version of this you're likely to hear if you come to the park. James J. Hill is on the greatest hits of ranger-led program topics: a larger than life figure and a remarkable success story. I never knew about this other piece of this history.\n\n[haunting violin music begins to play]\n\nMichael: [in the field] Like 15% of the people I would say in this car are sleeping, which is why I’m talking quietly\n\nGaby: [both laughing] We’re trying not to be too annoying\n\nMichael: The National Park Service is famous for big parks like Glacier—grand landscapes full of powerful people. But those parks are outnumbered by the over 90,000 sites that tell the rest of America's story. [an electronic beat joins the violin music] Places identified by a community, not by an act of Congress. Smaller stories that might not need a full staff of park rangers, but that are no less worthy of preserving. And that's comforting to me.\n\nGaby: Okay. We made it to the lounge car.\n\nMichael: [in the field] We did.\n\nGaby: Yeah. This is cool, there’s more windows here.\n\nMichael: [in the field] It's got skylights, wraparound windows. People are working on their laptops, reading books, eating a breakfast burger. I thought that was a bold choice. [both laugh]\n\nMichael: In the end, I think it's taught me that however small I might feel in a place like this, however insignificant my life may seem when stacked against these great men of history, we all lead lives worthy of remembering.\n\nGaby: Are we train people now?\n\nMichael: [in the field] I think I'm a train person now\n\nMichael: The people who bend history to their will—and those of us along for the ride.\n\n[music continues, then fades lower under the credits]\n\nDaniel: Headwaters is a production of Glacier National Park with support from our partner, the Glacier National Park Conservancy. This season of headquarters was made by Daniel Lombardi, Peri Sasnett, Michael Faist and Gary Eseverri. Frank Waln wrote and performed our music, and Eric Carlson created this season's cover art. Season Three absolutely would not exist without Lacy Kowalski, Melissa Sladek, Sierra Mandelko, Brent Rowley, Darren Lewis, and the whole team at the Park Archives. We relied on a lot of great resources from the Montana Historical Society too. Special thanks this episode to Steven Sadis, Lucas Hugie, Paul Lusignan and Linda Tamura, and thanks as well to everyone with the First Presbyterian Church of Whitefish, but especially Bob, Paul, and Jessie. Great Northern Filmworks for permission to share excerpts from their series Empire Builder: James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway. Filmmaker Pat Murdo and the University of Montana's Mansfield Center for permission to share clips from their documentary, From the Far East to the Old West. And lastly, of course, thank you to everyone at Amtrak for helping Michael fulfill a years-long dream of getting to ride a train.\n\nLacy: Next time on Headwaters.\n\nMichael: We follow in the footsteps of some of the first Black Americans in these mountains. To find out how they got here. And uncover what happened to their history.\n\nCarolyn: It matters who tells the story. This is the question of representation but it’s also a question of history.\n\nAhern Report: There were several places on the trail where a misstep meant certain death.\n\nShelton: Will this place remember me, will it remember my shadow cast on the earth, will it remember the sound of my horse, will that be remembered?\n\nMichael: That's next time on Headwaters.\n\n[music ends]\n\nMichael: So Headwaters is made possible by the Glacier Conservancy, right Andrew? But you also fund a lot of other projects going on in the park. Do you have any examples?\n\nAndrew: Yeah, a really cool one is the Ranger led education programing that's going to be happening has been happening.\n\nMichael: Yeah, well, I know what that is because I've worked in that position. What is what are the Ranger led activities?\n\nAndrew: Yeah so students can come in, visit Glacier National Park and go on a field trip with a ranger, which is a really special experience for them. But we also are going to be offering classroom visits. So Rangers will come to local schools and teach them about the park, as well as expanding our distance learning. So students all around the country from every state can get to experience a little glimpse of Glacier National Park, which I think is pretty cool opportunity for them.\n\nMichael: No, definitely. You get one day Rangers leading students up to Avalanche Lake. Later in the winter, you're giving snowshoe programs or you're talking to students in Puerto Rico with the green screen. It's you know, it's a really cool program. So if you want to learn more about that project and others that the Conservancy funds, where can they go to find that information?\n\nAndrew: Check out our website. It's easy to remember: glacier.org\n\nLacy Kowalski: Headwaters is supported by the Glacier National Park Conservancy.\n\nShelton Johnson: [slowly, poetically, with a slight southern accent] My name is Elizy Bowman, Sergeant Troop K, Ninth Cavalry. Today, the sun come up and it come up strong, burning through the treetops, [wind whooshes in the background throughout] and it lit up the world around me. And I saw the trail ahead of me, and I'm riding like we always do. And there was just the wind. Just the sound of the wind in the sky, in the sound of my horse and me [horse hoofbeats on the ground] breathing as we moved along the trail. And I started thinking that this is what freedom must feel like. Never felt freedom when I was a sharecropper growing up in South Carolina. [birds singing] Never knew about freedom when my mother and my daddy had been enslaved. Freedom was this wind. Freedom was this rain. Freedom was being pushed up into the sky by these mountains beneath my feet and the rain coming down. That was freedom. I couldn't find it in South Carolina. I couldn't find it where I enlisted in Nebraska. But now I got it. And I don't know if I could ever let it go. How do you let go of freedom when you hold it for the first time?\n\n[Headwaters season 3 theme begins playing; starting with mandolin]\n\nDaniel Lombardi: Welcome to Headwaters, a show about how Glacier National Park is connected to everything else.\n\n[theme continues; a drumbeat, a flute line, and other instruments come in, before the music finishes]\n\nDaniel: We're calling this season \"Becoming.\" It's not a complete history, but a series of stories about how Glacier National Park became what it is today. [slow drumbeat playing as Daniel speaks] Landscape and history are inseparable. No history can be understood apart from the place in which it happens. And like landscapes, histories can erode, stories can disintegrate or be buried under the sediment of those that follow. This episode is about a story that has been poorly preserved and deeply buried, why that happened and why it matters. It is the story of the first Black Park Rangers and how so much of their history has been overlaid by the grains of a thousand others.\n\n[beat finishes]\n\nDaniel: Peri. This episode is about the Buffalo Soldiers here in Glacier.\n\nPeri Sasnett Yes.\n\nDaniel: Get us started.\n\nPeri: So when I think of the Buffalo Soldiers, I think of our park service uniforms. Mm. You guys all have one, right.\n\nDaniel: In my closet.\n\nMichael Faist Of course, it's pretty iconic—not very breathable, but, [Peri laughs] you know, the gray shirt, green pants and sweater, and then the big flat hat.\n\nPeri: Well, did you know that those are based on the hats worn by the Buffalo Soldiers?\n\nDaniel: No! And just to spell that out. Buffalo Soldiers were regiments of African-American soldiers in the Army.\n\nPeri: Right. And they were essentially the first park rangers in the years before the Park Service was formed. And we still wear their hats.\n\nMichael: Huh, I didn't know that.\n\nDaniel: So give us the background. How did these black regiments of Army soldiers come about?\n\nPeri: Well, basically, segregation. After the Civil War, the army created regiments for black soldiers to serve in, and they had to be separate from the ones that white soldiers served in.\n\nDaniel: But still, I suppose they were led by white officers, right?\n\nPeri: Yeah. Although there is a famous exception, Charles B Young. He was a West Point grad who was acting superintendent of Sequoia National Park in 1903. And he's the first black superintendent of a park.\n\nDaniel: Hmm. So they're—they're soldiers in the army, but they're working in the national parks because the National Park Service, it doesn't exist yet.\n\nPeri: Right. And so there are national parks, you know, Yellowstone, Sequoia, Yosemite,\n\nAll, together: Glacier.\n\nPeri: But there are no park rangers yet. And that doesn't happen until 1916 when the NPS is formed.\n\nMichael: So like, what were they doing in parks at the time?\n\nPeri: Well, they were doing a lot of similar things to what park rangers do now. They built roads and trails. They did firefighting work. They kept out vandals and poachers, all that kind of stuff.\n\nDaniel: But outside of those park ranger duties, I'm sure they had other missions, right?\n\nPeri: Right. But back in those early days, this is post-Civil War. The racial climate back East isn't great. So for the most part, they were sent on assignments out west.\n\nMichael: Okay. So the thought was like less people, less prejudice, I guess.\n\nPeri: Right. Yeah, for the most part. But that doesn't mean it wasn't complicated. And so in addition to being proto-park rangers, a lot of their assignments were in the Indian Wars in the late 1800s. So they're fighting against indigenous people who are resisting being confined to reservations.\n\nMichael: Hmm. So, I mean, there's just a lot more to this story than meets the eye.\n\nPeri: Right. They also did peacetime and exploratory missions, too, including spending some time here in Glacier.\n\nMichael: Really?\n\nPeri: Yeah, they were here in 1910 fighting fires during the Big Burn. [drumbeat begins] And they were also part of a couple early expeditions before this was even a park, including the Ahern expedition.\n\n[drumbeat ends]\n\nPeri: One of the best surviving accounts of this expedition is from GE Culver, the geologists they brought along who starts his report by describing the group.\n\nCulver Report: [a voice actor reads these excerpts in a formal, deep, gravelly voice] The party consisted of two mountaineers, two prospectors, two Indian guides, a squad of soldiers, black as Ebony and the writer. All were mounted and well-armed. 30 days rations were carried.\n\nDaniel So, Culver. This guy is your—your main source for this story. He was the team's scientist, and he kept a record of the trip that you're looking at.\n\nPeri: Yeah, he recorded kind of the broad strokes of the adventure, but it's like 2 pages of adventure and 15 pages of geology. But through his writing and his sketches of the mountains, you can start to reconstruct where they went and why. I had an actor read some excerpts from the report.\n\nCulver Report: The object of the expedition was to find, if possible, a pass over the main range, farther north than any then known, to map the course of the streams and the principal Indian trails.\n\nPeri: So roughly they went up the east side trying to find a past over the mountains. They tried Many Glacier with no luck, and then kept trying further north.\n\nDaniel: I'm not surprised they had trouble finding a pass in the mountains here. They're glacially carved, they're famously steep.\n\nPeri: Yeah. So this expedition of about 15 people travels several hundred miles across the park and in a big loop around northwest Montana over 57 days.\n\nDaniel: Yeah, I don't think I've ever backpacked more than maybe a couple of nights at a time.\n\nPeri: Yeah, me neither. So while it would have been quite an adventure to retrace their whole journey, I decided to just follow their footsteps where they crossed the continental divide—probably the most challenging day of their trip. And today it's called Ahern Pass.\n\n[footsteps; yellow-rumped warblers and swainson’s thrushes singing]\n\nPeri: [in the field, out of breath] It takes a solid day of hiking to get to Ahern pass, if not a couple days. And I'm heading out with Michael and Gaby to see it for myself. [birds continue to sing] If you want to figure out what you don't know, go hiking without any cell service. As soon as you can't look something up, you realize how little you understand. And as I hike, I'm realizing how little I know about the soldiers themselves. Why aren't there any firsthand accounts from them? What did they think of this place?\n\n[bird sounds and footsteps fade out]\n\nShelton Johnson: My name is Shelton Johnson, and I currently work as the community engagement specialist for Yosemite National Park.\n\nPeri: Shelton is one of the most renowned and respected rangers in the Park Service. He appeared in Ken Burns's National Parks documentary, and he's one of the foremost experts on this history. He's studied, portrayed and written about Buffalo Soldiers for decades, including the first person narrative that began this story, which was a clip from his podcast series, A Buffalo Soldier Speaks.\n\nPeri: [to Shelton] And so based on your research, can you can you speculate like what their experience was like? Like, what did they think of the landscape? What did they—\n\nShelton: No I think that they felt what most people feel, it's a universal sentiment, if you will, to be impressed by a landscape that is literally overwhelming. That happened in Yosemite, it happened in Yellowstone, it certainly would have happened in Glacier National Park, because the landscape itself sparks that sense of wonder. And I think that's a human trait that is universal.\n\n[wind whooshing]\n\nCulver Report: The morning when we looked out of our tents, the fog was slowly drifting away and glimpses of the lofty peaks could be had through rifts in the fog. The effect was quite striking.\n\nPeri: This was one of the earliest mapping expeditions of the region, long before the park existed. They climbed peaks, made camp and spent weeks in this rugged mountain ecosystem. It's the sort of trip that people take today to get away from it all, to escape everyday life.\n\nShelton: The difference would be that they lived and operated in a virulently racist time period. When you're part of an expedition, there's a certain level of interdependence and respect that has to be there in order for it to function properly, for—in order for everyone to benefit from that association.\n\nPeri: If you've ever been camping or backpacking with a group, you can understand this sort of teamwork. [fire crackling in the background] You figure out who carries what, who sets up the tent, who cooks the food.\n\nCulver Report: [fire crackling continues; sounds of fat sizzling in a pan] A few ducks, grouse and ptarmigan paid our cookhouse a visit, as did numerous fine trout of large game. We secured one big horn and six mountain goats. The young of the latter are very fine eating -- the old bucks taste of musk.\n\n[subtle, pensive music begins to play]\n\nShelton: So and as you get to know people, you see beyond to a great degree, ethnicity, you see beyond gender. But be that as it may, they were still, quote unquote, colored soldiers of that time.\n\nPeri: America's prejudices followed them everywhere, even into the wilderness.\n\nShelton: If you did something that was done very well, you did that in spite of your race. If you failed at a task, you failed at that task because of your race. But race was always part of that dynamic. You were viewed fully through the lens of race and through the lens of class. And there was no—really, there wasn't an escape from it. At any point.\n\nPeri: At one point, the group reached a dead end, a high-walled mountain basin where they met a group of Stoney Indians, also called the Nakoda People. Ahern loaned their chief his rifle and the chief gave them directions. [music ends] And this wasn't the first time they'd encountered Indigenous people on the expedition. By one account they shared a third of their rations along the way with Blackfeet people. But elsewhere, regiments of Buffalo Soldiers had been fighting wars against tribal nations, most famously in the Southwest, fighting the Apache.\n\nPeri: [to Shelton] I have often wondered what the Buffalo Soldiers thought of interacting with the Indigenous people. Would they have felt like a solidarity with another oppressed people?\n\n[same spare, pensive music from before begins again]\n\nShelton: When you read a lot of the colored newspapers of that time period, there was certainly a sentiment that why should we aid and abet the theft of a land from another group of people who are not that dissimilar from ourselves? Dissimilar certainly in terms of culture, but in terms of the racial attitudes of the time, they were all cast into the same box. But at the same time, there were African-Americans who felt that by enlisting in the United States Army and potentially sacrificing their life, it was almost like we have done this for you, for this nation. And so it was an investment, an investment in the future by—by potentially sacrificing yourself for a nation that did not recognize the fullness of your humanity, perhaps the fullness of that humanity would be recognized for your children.\n\n[music ends]\n\nPeri: While this expedition was a peaceful one, it was still dangerous. Following the advice of the Stoney Indians, the party set out to climb the rocky mountain pass ahead of them: Ahern Pass. Here's Lieutenant Ahern's report from that day.\n\nAhern's Report: [out of breath, sounds weary; horse footsteps and the sounds of men talking in the background; wind whooshing] August 22nd. As I led the pack train out this morning, I felt extremely anxious, as there were several places on the trail where a misstep meant certain death. At one place, we climbed a narrow and very steep rock, 15 feet high, in which we had to cut steps. We led our most troublesome animals over this. My feelings were indescribable when I started up this rock, not knowing what the horse would do. The ledge was about 18 inches wide. On the lower side was a fall of 1900 feet.\n\nPeri: I can only imagine riding a horse through this kind of terrain. But Shelton doesn't have to. He's done reenactments of Buffalo Soldier patrols in Yosemite, on horseback, in full uniform with saddles and gear of the period.\n\nPeri: [to Shelton] Why did you choose to-- to wear the uniform, to ride on horseback? Why was that important to you? And what did you learn from it?\n\nShelton: I chose that pathway because I wanted to not just see the history from the outside looking in the way that you look through a window at a world that's that there's a partition between you and that world. I wanted to put myself into the history, and the best way to do that would be to do what they did, and to wear the uniform that they wore, to ride a saddle that they might have ridden. And when you're on a horse and you look straight down, all you see is the horse. The horse is blocking the view of the ground beneath your feet. And when you're 12 feet above the ground and you look over, you just see an abyss, if you're going on the trail along a canyon wall. You can talk about it, but it's better if you live it. And if you live it, then you really feel it. And if you feel it, then that's you. You've become the past that you're interpreting. And that's what I wanted. That's why I did that. And it did deepen my—my experience and deepened my perception of this entire history.\n\n[music begins to play, starting with strings plucking]\n\nPeri: To deepen my experience and perception of this history, I have to live it. I wanted to go to Ahern Pass.\n\n[a drumbeat layers over it, then an excerpt from an old scratchy interview with the words “the Indians called us Buffalo boys.” Music ends]\n\n[footsteps, white-crowned sparrow singing]\n\nPeri: [in the field, out of breath] Hello.\n\nMichael: Hi. Where are we?\n\nPeri: [in the field, out of breath] We're almost at Ahern Pass. Very class. But not quite.\n\nMichael: Well, how are you feeling right now?\n\nPeri: [in the field, out of breath] Tired. Hot. Bit out of breath. [birds singing] Pretty excited about the view.\n\nPeri: It's been a long hike, but since I'm being recorded, I'm trying to act like I'm not too out of breath.\n\nMichael: Look around. What do you see?\n\n[wind in the background]\n\nPeri: [in the field] I see a snow field, this flat, grassy pass... [gasps] Sheep! [laughing] There's like, oh my God there's like a dozen of them! Are those little baby sheeps? [gasps] I love them.\n\nPeri: We finally made it to Ahern Pass. The mountains on either side are towering and impenetrable, but the pass itself is a low point between them. A small meadow full of wildflowers and tiny trees with a view down to Helen Lake and the plains beyond. There's even a trail up here now on the west side, but that's not the side the Buffalo Soldiers came up.\n\nMichael: How steep do you think it is down to Helen?\n\nPeri: [in the field] I don't know. Let's take a peek over the edge if we can…not fall off of it.\n\n[white-crowned sparrow sings; rocks start to clatter underfoot\n\nPeri: Their route? Basically a cliff.\n\n[rocks clattering; loud wind noise rumbles in the background]\n\nPeri: [in the field] This is very steep. Aaaaah! Michael! Don't get so close to the edge.\n\nGaby Eseverri: Oh, my God. Oh!\n\nPeri: I know!\n\nGaby: No way. [laughing]\n\n[raven caws, wind continues blowing]\n\nPeri: I— [laughing] I'm flabbergasted at trying to take up here. This is absurd.\n\nGaby: That's a lot steeper than I expected.\n\n[swelling string music begins]\n\nPeri: [in the field] Yes. I thought there would be these sort of grassy green slopes with beargrass, and that can be tough to traverse. And there was maybe one rock ledge that they had to climb over or something, and that's what they cut steps into. But this is just a vertical cliff.\n\n[a beat layers into the music]\n\nMichael: It's major bighorn habitat.\n\nPeri: Glaciers carved this valley, leaving behind a steep rock wall below the pass. It's perfect for cliff dwelling bighorn sheep, but a terrifying place to take a horse. The slope rises sharply from the lake, turning into a network of ledges covered in crumbling rock that clatters loose at the slightest nudge. Ahern Glacier looms to the north, and the landscape feels alive—the geology and active force.\n\nPeri: [in the field] We're looking down at Helen Lake, and I see Elizabeth Lake in the distance and—\n\nAhern's Report: Ahern Pass is 2000 feet above the lake at its foot and the summit wall on either side of the pass was estimated to be at least 1500 feet more. The entire force had worked two days in making a trail from the foot of the tall a slope to the summit of the pass. The ascent is very steep and was made with difficulty.\n\nPeri: [in the field, with wind in the background] I did not imagine it would look like this.\n\n[calmer, more pensive music begins to play]\n\nGaby: Well knowing that they had horses and stuff, I definitely imagined it to be a bit more gradual. Yeah.\n\nPeri: [in the field] Like if I looked at this like could I get down this or up this, I'd be like, “um, I don't know if I really want to do that. I would definitely need a helmet.”\n\nGaby: I don't know that this is the most hopeful way to get across.\n\nPeri: [in the field] No, I'd be like, maybe let's try Canada instead. [both laughing] How about Logan Pass? [more reflectively] It definitely gives me a newfound respect for what they were doing here and their skill to navigate a place like this.\n\n[foosteps; white-crowned sparrows singing]\n\nPeri: [in the field] Because they still had hundreds of miles of journeying left in this expedition. But I think this was probably the toughest point.\n\nGaby: It makes me feel like really reflective because this was... 1890? 1890.\n\n[birds twittering]\n\nPeri: [in the field] Yeah. 20 years before the park was even established. So in a way, their presence probably hastened or contributed to the eventual formation of the park. But yeah, it was 132 years ago. And so, I mean, it's pretty cool to know that they walked right through this spot.\n\n[wind whooshing; raven caws]\n\nPeri: Visiting Ahern Pass was the first time I felt close to this story that so far I've only read about. Retracing their steps feels like another way of reaching out, in the same way that Shelton has tried to understand the Buffalo Soldiers by writing and performing from their perspective.\n\n[wind whooshing; pensive music begins to play]\n\nShelton: [reading as Elizy Bowman; his Buffalo Soldier character from the opening of the episode] But around here I noticed these rocks got a tendency to remember everything that's ever happened to them. This place got a tendency to remember everything that has ever happened to it... [music fades out]\n\nPeri: [in the field] It's easy to think of the backcountry here as a place where, you know, you go to get away from people. But like—I don't know, it's been really cool to think about all the people that have been here before me and all the stories that this landscape contains.\n\nShelton: [reading as Elizy Bowman; music resumes and swells] And we call that an echo. We call that something over your shoulder that makes you pull back and look quick to see if you can catch it. But nothing that ever comes through this place is ever forgotten. And you ain't got to lie down in the bedroll for too many nights before you realize that it's all being remembered and it's all being held on.... [music ends]\n\nPeri: In a way it feels... less lonely to be out here, when you think of all the other people who've—who've come here before me.\n\n[wind whooshes; raven caws]\n\nShelton: [reading as Elizy Bowman; music resumes] So I'm wondering this. Will this place remember me? Will it remember my shadow cast on the earth? Will it remember the sound of my horse as it moved through that canyon? Will that be remembered?\n\n[music ends as we hear the sounds of winds and ravens]\n\nPeri: Every place has a history, and history has a place too. But most people have never been to Ahern Pass, and most people don't know this story. If history can be eroded, some rocks are harder than others, more resistant to wearing away. Some layers of history become bedrock—common knowledge that we all share. Or they crystallize into something easily found, like when a place is named for a person: like George Patrick Ahern, the expedition leader. A peak, a creek, a glacier and, of course, a pass are all named for him, the white leader of this diverse group that mapped this section of the park. His story might not be common knowledge, but his biography isn't hard to find either.\n\nPeri: [to Shelton] Can you tell that story and talk about, you know, how you talked about expanding the frame?\n\nShelton: Yeah. And that's the photograph of—of Theodore Roosevelt next to John Muir in May of 1903 at Glacier Point. And then I discovered through my research that in 1903, Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks were protected by the Ninth Regiment of Cavalry, one of the Buffalo Soldier regiments. And so since the official escort for Theodore Roosevelt at that time for President Roosevelt were these African-American troops that belonged to the Ninth Cavalry—they're there! And yet there's no there's no photographic evidence of them being there. And so when I give my performance and I share that story, I talk about how a soldier might be standing there and being within 10 or 15 feet of the president. And they get kind of moved, \"Oh no, no, could you guys move back. Could you move over there? You're in the picture.\" The picture is a focus on Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir. The picture is not supposed to capture the African-American soldiers who are there, who are actually protecting the park all summer long. And so the question then becomes, who also throughout history, who are the folks that have been pushed away to the boundaries, to the frontier of that light that tries to capture a moment in time? And frequently it's women. And frequently, it's people of color. And that's how history is lost.\n\nPeri: [to Shelton] What I like about kind of how you tell the story is that you don't need to rewrite history. You're expanding the frame. You're expanding our understanding of what happened in these moments that we think we already know about.\n\nShelton: Yeah, that's what it really is. It's—if you look at it from the point of view of a tapestry, the threads, those colorful threads of ethnicity were always there. It's just that the perception that we have of that tapestry has literally been put into black and white, and the black part's not there, the red part's not there. The all these other colors that were always present weren't there. [music begins to play] And if that became an established the template for our perception of who was in the West at that time, then we we've been gifted with a distortion.\n\n[repetition of the music and sample of “the Indians called us Buffalo boys” to mark transition]\n\nPeri: I was also curious about some of the structural reasons that this kind of distortion might happen again and again. I reached out to Anthony Wood, a historian who has focused on Black history in Montana. I started by asking him why stories about people of color like the Buffalo Soldiers, and especially the ones on this expedition can be so hard to find in history.\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] And because that's one of the things I've been wondering about with the Buffalo Soldiers is like, we don't really have many of those primary sources. So it’s like, what existed in the first place and what is preserved over time or not?\n\nAnthony Wood: Mm hmm. So in this particular case, I'm fairly confident saying there is a high, high likelihood that everyone involved was probably literate. There are obviously a handful of black soldiers from these divisions that were very eloquent writers and really and more so excellent storytellers. But those are those are stories that certainly were existing. The primary sources, the letters of this is what we did today, even if they were short, certainly existed at one point, probably on a fairly large scale.\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] So then what affects whether those are preserved over time or not? Like whether we have those today?\n\nAnthony: Right well, there's—there's the very practical matter of whether or not families, a lot of working class, you know, people did not keep papers in the same way that wealthier upper class people did. But it's also probably something else. I think that by the time you get into the 20th century, the narratives, the stories that have been taken up and carried about what types of people went out and, you know, \"conquered the untamable wilderness\" and so on. And the, the role that soldiers often played in this is a very racialized one, and it's predominantly the figure of a white, hyper masculine, you know, man who's, who's going out and is—\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] The mountain man\n\nAnthony: The mountain man.\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] And so you're kind of saying that, like, if people had these letters, maybe they were their parents or their grandparents from when they were in the Buffalo Soldiers out in the West. That wouldn't seem like it would fit into the narrative. It wouldn't seem like something important that maybe they should preserve that it wasn't part of that history.\n\nAnthony: Right, yeah.\n\nPeri: So one way that some histories erode away is when the keepers of those stories don't recognize their importance. Sometimes, because the stories don't fit into the dominant narrative. Anthony has studied the Black community of historic Helena, Montana. But since there are so few firsthand accounts from early Black Montanans, he's often looked to other sources, like Black-owned newspapers.\n\nAnthony: In my case, I spent a lot of time working with and relying on the three Black newspapers in town, two of which were incredibly useful. But they also gave a window into a type of social history, the everyday lives, which I'm also really fascinated with, that just does not exist anywhere else outside of one person's perspective and, you know, maybe a journal or a diary. And that's these the sections of the paper that are like the community notes, or the they sometimes in Butte, the Butte newspaper, they call them the dope book, [Peri laughs] or they just do funny, sometimes serious, sometimes just newsy briefs. You know, this person when hiking today, you know, they caught this many fish or they, you know, this person went over and had, you know, lunch in Helena.\n\nPeri: But these black newspapers were only in print for a limited amount of time.\n\nAnthony: One year, you know, it’s eight months in 1894, one year in 1902, and then from 1906 to 1912.\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] Wow, that's very limited.\n\nAnthony: It narrows my scope to what I study, certainly.\n\nPeri: So for all the rest of those years outside the handful that those black newspapers operated, often the sources you end up with are from white writers, white journalists—white expedition leaders.\n\nAnthony: If you were to read them and try and reconstruct what life looks like for a daily Black Montanan, those sources just simply can't speak to it. The topography of, of the source world, it's not neutral. It's—it's has, you know, real and perceptible biases to it.\n\nPeri: Anthony uses landscape as a way to explain these aspects of studying history, especially the ideas of sedimentation and erosion.\n\nAnthony: Landscape is the dominant metaphor for the study of race in the United States. We think about, we say the racial landscape, and it's just an assumed metaphor.\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] So how does that fit for you into the historical record? How do you apply those terms?\n\nAnthony: So the way I apply the idea of erosion and sedimentation is to focus on the way that stories are told or not told. A story that is, you know, left aside and not told, we can think about it as being eroded. It sets us into certain ways of thinking about the past and about thinking about what really matters, you know, who really belongs, who's really at home in this place. Is this something that exists because it fits the pattern or fits the channel where the water is flowing most easily?\n\nPeri: Every time we tell our national story, some things are being added, while others are being forgotten—covered over by other stories, fresher in our memories, ones we choose to tell instead.\n\nAnthony: Erosion can take place in multiple speeds and durations. It can be fast and enormous, like a flood that just rips everything out and you get, you know, the scablands of Eastern Shore, Washington\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] Like a building is demolished\n\nAnthony: Or it can be slow and glacial. And it can just take a very long time and you can just an imperceptible change over such a long a generation or more.\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] Like a story that's not told, that's not passed on and slowly forgotten.\n\nAnthony: Yeah. And the way I'm experiencing this landscape right now is both as something that is in the past and changing in the present. And the way that is changing in the present is because of the past.\n\nPeri: When I looked out from Ahern Pass, I saw U-shaped valleys carved by glaciers during the last ice age. But the glaciers followed those paths because rivers and streams already flowed there. Today the glaciers are gone, but Ahern Creek flows down the valley those glaciers left behind. Everything in geology, and I'd argue in history, is shaped by what came before.\n\nAnthony: It's happening in the moment that you're studying it. It's happening, you know, in the 1890s. Then it happens again.\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] It’s like the sands are always shifting. Yeah.\n\nAnthony: So how do you study that?\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] I'm a geologist, so I love it.\n\nAnthony: I'm glad that. Yeah. I wonder if that was why...\n\nPeri: [to Anthony] I love thinking about geology this way too. It's like people think about geology as something that happened in the past, but it's still happening all the time.\n\nAnthony: Exactly.\n\n[a drumbeat plays, marking a transition]\n\nPeri: So many of these choices happened in the past -- what sources or places that people and institutions choose to preserve, which stories are told or not told. So what are the consequences of forgetting them?\n\nShelton: The past isn't dead. It isn't even past. That's the—that's the William Faulkner quote that I've often used, it lives on into the present. And that is one of the problems that we have today is that we do not fully see the challenges and the inequities that exist in the past, which is why so many people do not understand the anger that exists today that you see and hear in the newspapers among people of color, among African-Americans in particular, but also among Native Americans, is rooted in the inequities of the past. But the past isn't—it's still here. It's still happening today. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a modern day Black Lives Matter movement. It's rooted in the perception that what happened in the past is continuing into the present.\n\nPeri: And these choices about how we represent history not only affect how we view the past and understand the present, but they're still being made every day.\n\nPeri: [to Shelton] You've spent probably the better part of your career telling these stories, specifically the Buffalo Soldier story, these stories that we don't otherwise get to hear. Yes. Why is that? Why have you devoted your career to that?\n\nShelton: Well, because of the cultural perception that is literally held by African-Americans today. African-Americans in general feel that, “oh, national parks, that's not something that we do. That's something white folks do. We don't do that.” And they have that—they have that perception because of what we just talked about, because they've not read in a history book about the role of African-Americans in the trans-Mississippi West going all the way back to Lewis and Clark. I mean, that is that is our Odyssey. That's our Homer and that's our Virgil. It starts out with Lewis and Clark in 1803. The fact that there was a person of color that was part of that expedition, specifically an enslaved person, Clark's manservant, who became invaluable to the success of that expedition—that's something that should be shared at every classroom and every school in the United States, because then all children would grow up with this vision that is inclusive rather than a vision that is exclusive.\n\nCarolyn Finney: It matters who tells the story. This is the question of representation, but it's also a question of history.\n\nPeri: This is Dr. Carolyn Finney.\n\nCarolyn: I call myself a storyteller, in part because I stand at the intersection of the arts, education, and lived experience to talk about issues of race, place, belonging, the environment, justice—all the good stuff and a few things that are hard.\n\nPeri: I wanted to talk to one more person to bring this story into the present day. For eight years, Carolyn served on the National Park System Advisory Board, and she's the author of the book Black Faces White Spaces. There's a quote in her book that says, \"the power of representation lies in its ability to shape today's reality through the reality of the past.\" Dr. Finney explained that if you exclude the histories of certain people from national parks, then you're less likely to see those people in national parks.\n\nCarolyn: And so I can't talk about the past without talking about the present. There could be 100 reasons within, you know, for reasons why the Buffalo Soldier story took so long to come to light.\n\nPeri: [to Carolyn] Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCarolyn: Part of it is going to be Jim Crow. Part of it is going to be we're living in a country where and I'm only talking about Black folks here, that Black folks weren't seen as fully human, you know, until sometime in the last 50 years. You know, but not just Black people. All kinds of people from all walks of life have been challenged in terms of their skin color, their gender, you know, where they live, how much money they have in their pockets, their religious beliefs. I mean, we're still doing that today, and that's going to matter. So I—when I look at the history of Buffalo Soldiers or any group of people and wonder why it's taken this long for them to get there, I understand, you know, the first question I ask is, well, who was doing the telling? Mm hmm. Representation is important. If you leave a whole lot of stuff out, then I'm only getting part of the story. Mm hmm. And somewhere that means I am only partially who I can become.\n\nPeri: [to Carolyn] What do you think the role of national parks and public lands is in interpreting history and in exploring this relationship of people to place and landscape and land and environment?\n\nCarolyn: Well, you know, public lands? For whom? That's why I say, that's really, you know—and I always tell people, it's not like you crossed over into a public land and suddenly there was no racism.\n\nPeri: [to Carolyn] Mm hmm.\n\nCarolyn: And people carry those beliefs with them, whether they work in a park or are visiting a park or not, right? The public lands are for everyone is a really nice sentiment. [sighs, chuckles]\n\nPeri: [to Carolyn] Yeah.\n\n[haunting violin music begins to play]\n\nCarolyn: Who—who are you talking about? You know, who's claiming that? Where is that? You know, I think I understand the common good, the idea of land being for the public, this is for all of us. And I think it sits on a complicated history of blood, you know, sweat and tears for real. You know, and I think the only way that public lands can really serve us all is that we engage that blood, sweat and tears as part of the story. This is where our redemption lies. For me, the beauty of public lands is that we can actually find redemption and who we've been and who we are right now. The public lands give us that opportunity.\n\nPeri: To keep these histories from eroding, we need to do the work of preserving them.\n\nShelton: You know, I think when I look at the Buffalo Soldier story from the inside out, what becomes obvious to me, what becomes perceivable to me is that there are so many stories involving women, involving other people of color, other communities that are not told or not heeded. And those stories can have a profound impact on how we see ourselves and how we see our own country.\n\n[music begins to play]\n\nPeri: [to Carolyn] I think in parks like this, the history is often left out of the landscape. A big, beautiful park like glacier that people think of for the mountains and the rivers and the bears. All of those things are part of the story and so are people. And so are the history.\n\nCarolyn: Yes. Yeah.\n\nShelton: Those all those stories need to be told because we are not the America we think we are. We're still on the road to becoming the nation that we think we already are. We're not there yet. And people who feel that we are there yet do not understand the fullness of our history.\n\nCarolyn: That should actually that in and of itself should make us recognize and revere the idea of public lands so much more. Not avoid the telling of that history because it you know, it's not a pretty telling. That should make—it cost people something for us to be able to call a piece of land public. And we as a public have a responsibility and an accountability to that idea of public lands. That's the conversation I want to have around public lands.\n\n[haunting violin music begins again]\n\nShelton: And that is what's powerful about telling these stories. It makes American history reveals American history to be much deeper than we give it credit for being. And the anything that results in a deepening of light, a deepening of sound, a deepening of color, which results in a clearer vision of who we are as human beings, who we are as Americans.\n\n[music builds, then fades to play softly under the credits]\n\nDaniel: Headwaters is a production of Glacier National Park with support from our partner, the Glacier National Park Conservancy. This season of headquarters was made by Daniel Lombardi, Peri Sasnett, Michael Faist and Gary Eseverri. Frank Waln wrote and performed our music, and Eric Carlson created this season's cover art. Extra special thanks this episode to Shelton Johnson, Carolyn Finney, Anthony Wood, Daniel Brewster and the Black Park Ranger Experience. Also thank you to Ed Whittle, Tim Stephenson, and Frank Gerard. We could not have made season three without Lacy Kowalski, Melissa Sladek, Sierra Mandelko, Brent Rowley, Darren Lewis, and the Glacier National Park Archives team, and we relied on so many great resources from the Montana Historical Society, so thanks to them too. Thanks for listening.\n\n[drumbeat begins]\n\nLacy Next time on Headwaters:\n\nPeri: The history of homesteading and allotment in northwest Montana.\n\nJim Muhn: Everybody thinks it’s so simple, but it gets so complicated.\n\nLois Walker: There were strong personalities, and they disagreed about a lot of stuff, but in the winter, you get along.\n\nSam Resurrection (read by Frank Waln): To William Howard Taft, June 1910. There is 1,353 Flathead that don’t want to be open.\n\nPeri: That’s next time, on Headwaters.\n\n[music ends]\n\nPeri: So Andrew.\n\nAndrew Smith: Yes.\n\nPeri: Headwaters couldn't happen without the support of the Glacier Conservancy. But you guys also help with so many other projects in the park.\n\nAndrew: Yeah. One I wanted to talk about today is the project to build an accessible trail around Swiftcurrent Lake. Swiftcurrent Lake is right in front of the Many Glacier Hotel—it's probably one of the most popular trails in the Many Glacier valley.\n\nPeri: I've hiked it many times!\n\nAndrew: Yeah it's really beautiful. And we're working on a long term partnership over the next few years with the MCC, the Montana Conservation Corps, to make a wheelchair accessible trail all the way around so that people with mobility impairments can enjoy that lake and that beautiful area just like the rest of us.\n\nPeri: That sounds like a great project.\n\nAndrew: Yeah, we think the national parks should be available to everyone, so we're really excited to make it happen.\n\nPeri: And if people want to learn more, how can they do that?\n\nAndrew: They should visit our website, and they can find us at glacier.org\n\nLacy Kowalski: Headwaters is brought to you by the Glacier National Park Conservancy.\n\n[car noise]\n\nMichael Faist: [talking to himself] Nachos, restaurant and bar, 500 feet. Home ranch bottoms.\n\nDaniel Lombardi: This August, on a hot summer day, Michael and Peri went on a field trip.\n\nFlannery Freund: Oh cool. Hey guys!\n\nMichael: [to Flannery] Hello! We were able to borrow some of your time today…\n\nFlannery: Yeah.\n\nDaniel: They drove up to the North Fork to meet Flannery.\n\nFlannery: My name is Flannery Freund, and I co-own the Home Ranch Bottoms, a bar and restaurant here in the North Fork.\n\nDaniel: Flannery used to work as a ranger in Polebridge, Glacier's remote northwest entrance. But she's also part of the tight knit, off-grid community that lives just outside the park.\n\nMichael: [to Flannery] What is the community like up here?\n\nFlannery: It's small. It's the type of place where you there's different political persuasions, but you help each other change your tires. And you—we're all like surviving up here.\n\nMichael: [to Flannery] So for somebody who's never been to the North Fork before, how would you describe it?\n\nFlannery: You know, I feel like what's kind of cool as you journey up here that the essence of civilization just kind of trickles off of you. The pavement ends and then soon after, the cell phone service ends. I love witnessing people experiencing this place for the first time because it's totally awe-striking. That there's not that many places left without pavement, without cell phone service.\n\nMichael: [to Flannery] When did you come to the North Fork?\n\nFlannery: I arrived... Well, the first time I came here was October of 2008. I went camping up at Quartz Lake and it happened to be ten degrees that night. I definitely was intrigued. [both laugh] And then I moved here full time in May of 2009.\n\nMichael: [to Flannery] All right. That next year.\n\nFlannery: That next year. Yep. Knew nothing about the community. Knew nothing about how special and intact this place was. Except that you feel that innately, that's something else that, like, you know, this place is wild.\n\nDaniel: As a resident and president of the North Fork Preservation Association, Flannery works to preserve this area's rugged history. And as a baker, she makes a mean huckleberry peach pie, sharing a slice of North Fork life with those who pass through.\n\nMichael: [to Flannery] Pie is your jam here. Why pie?\n\nFlannery: I have to bake. We're a bar with a baking problem. [both laugh] And pie is charming. Pie is Montana. Pie has homestead vibes. You know, that's... That's why pie.\n\n[Headwaters season 3 theme begins playing; starting with mandolin, then a drumbeat, a flute line, and other instruments layer in before the music finishes]\n\nDaniel: What is the magnetic force that pulls people through history? Is it the dream of power and profit? Or is history moved by other, more benevolent forces, like the basic human longing for community, or dreams of leaving behind a better world for future generations? Welcome to Headwaters, a show about how Glacier National Park is connected to everything else. You're listening to Season Three. This episode is about the impact of homesteading on Northwest Montana, an era when incompatible dreams clashed like the opposing ends of a magnet. The promise of a new frontier and a promise left empty—a million acres set aside by the government only to be sold off to eager buyers.\n\nMichael: We're setting out to understand homesteading as a policy, and more personally, as seen through the eyes of early Montanans. But let's start with the Homestead Act.\n\nJim Muhn: Everybody thinks it's so simple, but it gets so complicated.\n\nMichael: This is Jim Muhn.\n\nJim: Former land law historian with the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nMichael: Jim said homesteading starts with a concept called the public domain, which is basically a term for lands owned by the U.S. government.\n\nJim: National land to be disposed of in the national interest.\n\nMichael: In the 1800s, the young United States was looking to expand, adding to the public domain through acquisitions like the Louisiana Purchase. Some would use the term Manifest Destiny to describe this era, arguing that the United States was divinely destined to expand. Others, even at the time, pushed back against that, labeling it as conquest. But the government's motives, at least initially, for these acquisitions, were practical.\n\nJim: Well, the national government understood that there was this pioneer spirit, that the country was always going to keep expanding. So they understood that. But their main concern when the public domain was first created was: they needed money.\n\nMichael: France and Spain helped fund the Revolutionary War, and the U.S. government still needed to settle the debt.\n\nJim: They decided that the best thing to do would be to sell the public domain. And when they did that, they weren't really concerned about the average settler. They sold to land speculators or other moneyed interests. They sold large parcels of land.\n\nMichael: [to Jim] Gotcha.\n\nJim: But this is like a big piggy bank that you can use to develop the country from there.\n\nMichael: From there, for our story anyway, two things happened. The first was that people didn't care if land on the frontier was available for them to buy. They were settling on it anyway—squatting essentially—and not paying a dime. And the second was that for many politicians, their dream of a successful America was a country filled with small, privately owned farms.\n\nJim: I think the agrarian ideal for America can be traced back to people like Thomas Jefferson. They felt that the farmer was the average American.\n\nMichael: Even the units that we use to measure land, like acres, are rooted in agriculture. Acres were invented in the Middle Ages to describe the area one farmer could plow in one day with a team of oxen.\n\nJim: I mean, you can only have so many shopkeepers. But you needed lots of farmers.\n\nMichael: Finally, an idea was hatched that claimed to answer both of these things at once. If the government offered everyday people parcels of land for free (ish), they could fill the west with farms and curtail unlawful settlement. Two birds; one stone. But it wasn't without its opponents.\n\nJim: One of the underlying issues there is slavery. If you populate Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas with small farmers, the place for slave holdings is kind of disappearing.\n\nMichael: The fact that small farms wouldn't require slaves meant that some saw homesteading as a way to keep slavery out of the frontier and expand the power of free states. Slaveholding senators opposed the idea as if it were an existential threat. But by the time the Civil War began, there were a lot of empty seats on Capitol Hill. And the Homestead Act was passed.\n\nJim: It was passed May 20th, 1862, signed into law by Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMichael: All of a sudden, if you were an American head o"
