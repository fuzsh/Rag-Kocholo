        "text": "Yesterday is gone, tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today, let us begin.\n\nThis quote from Mother Teresa is packed full of truth. It is not complicated. It hits the nail on the head when it comes to making the most of every day.\n\nTogether let’s look in detail at what exactly was Mother Teresa saying.\n\nYesterday Is Gone\n\nDepending upon how yesterday was will determine how we feel today. We could feel happy, sad, frustrated even excited. We may even have many furious feelings about yesterday.\n\nBut there could be danger looking back. We might find ourselves living in the past, perhaps building a monument to the past. Sometimes we feel we can’t move on. We therefore allow that action to determine and shape our today.\n\nI have learned that successes and failures can cause us to have the same reaction. We look back to our success but never make any real progress from there.\n\nSimilar to a failure where again we live on in hurt and rejection, never making any real progress.\n\nTomorrow Has Not Yet Come\n\nI am all for vision and forward planning. It is one of the things I do best. I am a ‘big picture’ guy. As a leader, I see things before many others see things.\n\nHowever, the danger can be that we always live for tomorrow sometimes putting off important stepping stones for today.\n\nIt is great to have a plan; however, you must ensure the plan also turns into Action.\n\nAlways thinking about tomorrow can have its dangers! Why do something today when there is always tomorrow?\n\nWe procrastinate, become lazy and then give ourselves a ‘pat on the back’ because we fool ourselves into thinking, “Tomorrow I will do….”\n\nIn reality, tomorrow never happens. Does this resonate with you? There are many people who fall into this trap, thus never make the progress in their personal growth that they desire.\n\nYou need to become more intentional – To learn my 3 steps to becoming intentional Click Here.\n\nSeize the day today!\n\nWe Have Only Today – Let Us Begin\n\nOnly God knows how long we will live. We do not choose the number of our days. However, we can choose to make the most of everyday.\n\nMother Teresa’s quote, “We have only today – let us begin.” is something to live by. She was not just a woman of quotes. She did not just talk-the-talk, she walked-the-walk.\n\nHer many quotes are a reflection of her amazing life. She helped, encouraged and impacted millions of people.\n\nMother Teresa realized that everyday counted. This should be the same for us. We should live life to the fullest every day. We should not allow the past or the future to hinder us.\n\nToday – whatever our circumstances are – we really can still contribute to the lives of others.\n\nMy challenge to you and to myself – seize the day. Look to impact those round us!\n\nWill we not allow yesterday and tomorrow to stop us having a huge impact on those around us today?\n\nToday really does matter. You can’t change yesterday but you can make the most of today. You can’t go back – but you can move forward.\n\nLet these words stay with you as you consider your day “Yesterday is gone, tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today, let us begin.” Mother Teresa”\n\nUnfortunately, too many plans fail because of a lack of vision, strategic thinking and planning. This hinders projects, development of a company, teams and even career progression. Therefore to have a business growth consultant come in and to work with the senior team in designing a strategic plan can have huge benefits for the company.
