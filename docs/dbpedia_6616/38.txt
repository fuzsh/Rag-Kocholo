Varsity Spirit is proud to announce the development of the United Scoring Partners; a group of nearly 60 brands and independent event producers dedicated to providing customers with one universal score sheet, which results in a more consistent scoring and judging experience.

The United Scoring Partners will implement best practices, share ideas, and invest in educational resources to arm gym owners, coaches, and athletes to be prepared to compete on the same score sheet throughout their competition season. All registered judges will have access to the online judges and score sheet training.
