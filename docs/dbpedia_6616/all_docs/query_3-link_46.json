        "text": "Complete Personal Narratives\n\nIn your Personal Narratives (PNs), you will answer questions prompting you to describe the knowledge, skills, and abilities you would bring to the Foreign Service. The PNs offer the opportunity to highlight not just what you have done, but how you did it and what you learned. You should provide examples from your experiences that show you have the skills to be a successful Foreign Service Officer (FSO). The PNs are an important part of your application and are carefully scored along with your FSOT results in determining who is invited to the Foreign Service Officer Assessment. Qualification Evaluation Panels (QEPs), made up of trained FSOs including career track representatives, review candidate submissions for the corresponding career track. The panels assess each candidate’s file based on responses to six prompts which reflect the skills that predict success in the Foreign Service. These skills are:\n\nLeadership: innovation, decision making, teamwork, openness to dissent, community service and institution building\n\nInterpersonal: professional standards, persuasion and negotiation, workplace perceptiveness, adaptability, representational skills\n\nCommunication: ability to effectively convey, interpret, and retain information; active listening, public outreach, foreign language skills\n\nManagement: operational effectiveness, performance management and evaluation, management resources, customer service\n\nIntellectual: information gathering and analysis, critical thinking, active learning, leadership and management training\n\nSubstantive Knowledge: Understanding of U.S. history/ government/culture and ability to apply such understanding in international situations; knowledge or application of relevant career track information.\n\nTo help write your PNs, focus on your own experience and actions in answering the questions. Use the skills above as a guide to (1) give positive examples that demonstrate your abilities; (2) identify learning experiences; and (3) indicate how your learning experience will contribute to success in your chosen Foreign Service career track. Make sure you show why you have skills or a particular interest in the career track you have selected. Please make sure you directly address each question as asked.\n\nSubmit FSO Application Online\n\nThe application to become an FSO opens for approximately five (5) weeks three times each year and immediately precedes the FSOT test window. (View the Take the FSOT section to see current testing periods). To begin your application, first, go to www.pearsonvue.com/fsot to create an account. You can create an account at any time but will not be able to begin your application until the specific registration window opens.\n\nOnce the window opens, you will need to submit completed eligibility verification and application forms as well as your completed Personal Narratives. When applying, keep in mind that all the information you submit to the Board of Examiners through Pearson VUE is subject to verification. Any exaggeration of your experience and qualifications, including your language ability, will weaken your candidacy. Misrepresentations may be grounds for terminating your candidacy, or for dismissing you even after you have joined the Foreign Service, and may be punishable by a fine or imprisonment.\n\nOnce an application is submitted it cannot be changed for that application window. You will receive an on-screen confirmation message after you submit your completed eligibility verification and application package.\n\nRegistration for an FSOT seat can only be done after your FSO application, including your Personal Narratives, is complete and submitted. Information about the FSOT and upcoming dates and locations can be found below in Step 3: Take the FSOT. You may register to take the FSOT up until the registration deadline closes or until capacity is reached.\n\nYou will receive a confirmation message after you select a seat. You will also receive an e-mail from Pearson VUE, which includes details about your testing appointment, ID requirements, and directions to the testing center.\n\nNote: You may select a seat for the announced testing window only. Applications are valid for a specific test period only and will expire when that testing window closes. The number of testing center seats for each window is limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis. You may, however, reschedule your appointment for another date during that same testing window up until the close of the five-week registration process. Once the five-week registration process closes you can only cancel an appointment.\n\nIf you need to cancel your test you must do so at least two business days (48 hours) before your scheduled appointment. Your e-mailed confirmation letter will contain information on how to do so. If you fail to appear or cancel in a timely manner, you will be assessed a $72 “no-show” fee. You will need to apply again, during another application window, if you cancel. You may apply and take the FSOT during any of the three annual testing windows but may only do so once in a 12-month period.\n\nIf you have technical problems/questions regarding the registration process, click on the contact Pearson VUE link for assistance.\n\nWhat to Expect During the FSOT\n\nEach of the four sections of the FSOT – Job Knowledge, English Expression, Situational Judgment, and Written Essay – is timed. Each section must be completed within the designated time limit, and candidates are not allowed to return to a previous test section if they finish a later section with time remaining. Therefore, it is important that candidates have a strategy for pacing themselves to ensure they will complete each test section in the time allotted.\n\nFor the multiple-choice test item sections, candidates can easily figure out how much time they should spend on each question to answer them in the allotted time. However, this is an individual decision. Some people may not wish to pay attention to the time at all, but may simply prefer to work as quickly and steadily as possible.\n\nIn the timed essay, candidates may wish to spend the early part of the test organizing their ideas on the topic. Of course, there are many methods for writing an essay. The important thing to realize is that candidates should have a plan for how to organize their time. The tests are designed so that most candidates can finish them in the designated time period.\n\nFor each section of the test, candidates should consider the following:\n\nRead the directions carefully. The urge to quickly scan the directions to the test and start answering the questions is a natural one, but it is also unwise. It is important to read each question and its answer choices carefully before responding. Skipping over key words or concepts could lead to making mistakes and inadvertently answering an item incorrectly.\n\nAt times, candidates may be unsure of the answer to a particular question. One strategy is to skip these questions, go on to the questions they can answer, and return to the more difficult questions later while time still remains before exiting that section of the test. NOTE: Once candidates exit a test section, they will not be allowed to return to it. Candidates need to balance their time in answering the items as accurately as possible throughout the test.\n\nBecause the Job Knowledge and English Expression sections of the FSOT contain multiple-choice questions, it is most advantageous for candidates to answer all of the questions — even if they have to guess. There is no penalty for guessing. The number of questions that candidates answer correctly on these two multiple-choice item tests determines their score. If candidates can eliminate one of the answer choices, they have a better chance of choosing the correct answer.\n\nOne strategy for guessing that should be avoided is choosing answers in a pattern. Standardized tests are designed so that the correct answers to items are randomly distributed and do not follow any “guessing patterns.” Thus, candidates should avoid using this guessing tactic, because it is likely to be ineffective and detrimental to candidates’ scores.\n\nWhen contemplating a strategy for completing the test in the required time, candidates should try to factor in time to review their answers. Candidates may need to return to questions they skipped or reconsider questions about which they were unsure of the answer when they first read them. Candidates should keep in mind that all test-taking tips are general and should determine a test-taking strategy that works best for them.\n\nOnce the Test Session is Over\n\nAt the completion of the testing session, candidates should raise their hand in order to be escorted from the testing area. Since individual candidates may have begun their tests at different times, they also may be leaving as others are still testing. Please be considerate and try to minimize any disruptions.\n\nBring any testing irregularities to the proctor’s attention immediately or, at the very least, before leaving the test center. Pearson VUE and the Department of State work hard to provide candidates with appropriate testing environments and the proper tools, and they need to know if anything fails to meet appropriate standards. Filing a complaint with the proctor will NOT have any bearing on whether a candidate passes the FSOT.\n\nPearson VUE sends out results notifications advising candidates to check their accounts for score reports no later than three weeks after the close of the testing window. Even if candidates do not receive an email directing them to retrieve their online score reports from Pearson VUE, they can log into their accounts to retrieve them. To prevent difficulties in receiving results, candidates should:\n\nCheck their spam folders.\n\nMake sure their spam filters accept emails from PearsonVUEConfirmation@pearson.com.\n\nMake sure the email address they provided to Pearson VUE is the same email they are currently using. Candidates can update the email address in their profile themselves.\n\nNeither Pearson VUE nor the Department of State will be responsible for the failure of candidates’ Internet servers to deliver email in a timely fashion.\n\nBeginning with candidates who took the FSOT in February 2024, the FSOA will transition to a virtual platform, conducted over two separate days. Invited candidates will receive instructions on scheduling the Case Management Exercise portion first, in advance of the remaining two components. After completing the Case Management Exercise, candidates will receive further instructions on scheduling the Group Exercise and Structured Interview to occur consecutively on the same day.\n\nIf you have technical problems/questions regarding the registration process, click on the contact Pearson VUE link for assistance.\n\nAll candidates have the option of testing either at a Pearson VUE location or through Pearson VUE’s online platform (OnVUE). Candidates who wish to use the OnVUE platform should confirm its availability in their location and perform a tech check to ensure access to the OnVUE platform prior to taking any assessment components. Please be aware that OnVUE is not available in certain locations. In those cases, we recommend candidates check Pearson VUE’s site for a testing center location where they can schedule here. While Pearson VUE has an extensive network of testing center locations, it may be necessary for some applicants to travel to locations outside of their immediate area.\n\nGroup Exercise\n\nFor the Group Exercise, candidates are brought together in groups of three to six to represent a mock Embassy task force charged with allocating resources to competing projects in their fictitious host country. Each candidate is given 20 minutes to read and absorb a package of common background materials as well as a five-page candidate-specific project. There are three components to this exercise: the Presentation Phase, the Discussion Phase, and the Ambassador’s Debrief.\n\nPresentation Phase: Each candidate has five minutes to present their project to the others, and should cover all relevant facets of the project, including both negative and positive points, U.S. interests, and required resources.\n\nDiscussion Phase: After the last presentation has been made, the group begins the Discussion Phase, the stage in which the candidates must reach a consensus on project selection and allocation of the limited resources.\n\nAmbassador’s Debrief: Following the conclusion of the group’s discussion, each candidate will have three to four minutes to privately brief two assessors on the results of the group’s deliberations in a simulated debrief for the Ambassador.\n\nGet more details about the Foreign Service Officer Assessment in the FSOA Information Guide found on the Careers Downloads page.\n\nStructured Interview\n\nAll candidates participate individually in a Structured Interview conducted by two assessors. In the Interview, candidates are expected to use sound judgment and draw from their personal background, experience, and motivation to respond to questions designed to assess their Experience and Motivation and responses to Hypothetical Situations and Past Behavior Questions.\n\nExperience and Motivation: In this section, candidates should present a clear and precise picture of themselves, including personality traits and their understanding of the Foreign Service. Assessors consider candidates’ motivation to join the Foreign Service, education and work experience, as well as cross-cultural skills.\n\nHypothetical Situations: This section consists of a series of hypothetical scenarios designed to test the candidate’s situational judgment. Assessors will give the candidate brief scenarios to read that provide information about a fictitious country and the candidate’s position in a mock embassy, setting the scene for hypothetical situations. Candidates are advised that, while the problems occur in a simulated Foreign Service setting, candidates are not expected to know how an Embassy operates or to be familiar with government rules and regulations. Rather, candidates are asked to fashion a solution that employs good judgment and common sense.\n\nPast Behavior Questions (PBQs): In this section, assessors ask candidates a series of targeted questions to elicit examples from the candidates’ own experiences in specific areas. The questions are based on job analyses and are keyed to successful performance required of entry-level Foreign Service Officers. Candidates will be given time to choose one of two questions related to a particular Dimension and prepare responses. Responses should include examples appropriate for the question and drawn from candidates’ past actions and experience.\n\nGet more details about the Foreign Service Officer Assessment in the FSOA Information Guide found on the Careers Downloads page.\n\nReceive a Top Secret clearance Following a Background Investigation\n\nCandidates who pass the Assessment must apply for the security clearance required for appointment to the Foreign Service. A comprehensive background investigation, conducted by the U.S. Department of State in cooperation with other federal, state, and local agencies, will provide the information necessary to determine a candidate’s suitability for appointment to the Foreign Service and for a Top Secret security clearance.\n\nThe process considers such factors as: failure to repay a U.S. Government-guaranteed loan or meet tax obligations; failure to register for the Selective Service; past problems with credit or bankruptcy; unsatisfactory employment records; a criminal record or other violations of the law; drug or alcohol abuse; and less than honorable discharge from the armed forces.\n\nCandidates who hold dual citizenship, have had extensive travel, education, residence and/or employment overseas, or who have foreign contacts, a foreign-born spouse, immediate family members or relatives who are not citizens of the United States, should be aware that the clearance process will take longer to complete. The background investigation includes interviews with current and previous contacts, supervisors and coworkers. Candidates who do not receive a security clearance are ineligible for appointment. Potential candidates who have any serious issues that may prevent them from receiving a clearance should give some thought to the likelihood of their being found ineligible before starting this process.\n\nWhat is the Register?\n\nIf you successfully pass the Foreign Service Officer Test; Qualifications Evaluation Panel; Officer Assessment; security and medical clearances; and a suitability review, you are placed on a hiring register. You are rank ordered on the Register based on the specific career track you chose at the time you registered for the Foreign Service Officer Test and your Assessment score, plus any additional credit for language ability or veterans’ preference you receive. You should be aware that your placement on the Register does not guarantee an appointment as a Foreign Service Officer. Hiring depends on the needs of the Foreign Service. Your position on the Register is dynamic. People with higher scores will be placed above you regardless of when they are placed on the Register. Likewise, you will be placed above candidates with lower scores, regardless of how long they have been on the Register. Your name may stay in the Register for a maximum of 18 months. If you do not receive an appointment offer within that period, your name will be removed. Veterans Preference points or credit for demonstrated foreign language proficiency (see below) may raise your standing on the Register. Instructions on how to receive additional credit in these areas will be provided on successful completion of the Assessment. You may also seek to improve your place on the Register by re-taking the Foreign Service Officer Test again after 11 months. You will need to complete the FSOT, Officer Assessment, medical and security clearances and suitability review processes successfully again before your name will be re-entered on the Register. You may choose a different career track through this process.\n\nWhat happens after I accept a final offer?\n\nIf you rise to the top of the Register in your chosen career track, based on the hiring needs of the Foreign Service, you may receive an offer of employment. This often entails locating to Washington, D.C. with only a few weeks’ notice in order to begin training. You may decline the first offer of employment. If you decline a second offer, however, your name will be removed from the Register. In rare cases, such as a military deployment or other overseas obligation to the U.S. government, you may be eligible to defer your appointment. These cases are not common.\n\nNew Foreign Service professionals begin their careers with a six-week orientation program. The purpose of orientation is to introduce new employees to the structure and function of the Department and its role in the development and implementation of U.S. foreign policy, and to enhance core skills needed by all Foreign Service professionals. The Orientation course, based at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, VA, is primarily a classroom experience, with sessions conducted in a combination of large group plenaries and smaller breakouts. In addition to presentations by guest speakers and U.S. Department of State officials, Orientation also includes a series of practical exercises and case studies. These sessions are complemented by virtual instruction and self-study. At the end of Orientation, Foreign Service professionals receive their first assignments, which will govern the type of specialized training that follows. For some, that may include training in consular affairs, political-economic tradecraft, public diplomacy, or resource management. Any required language training can last for an additional six to nine months. Overall, newly hired FS professionals can expect to spend from three months to one year in training before departure for their first overseas (or domestic) assignment.\n\nForeign Language\n\nWhile knowing a foreign language is not a requirement to be considered for the Foreign Service, demonstrated proficiency in a language will enhance a candidate’s competitiveness on the Register by giving an increase in points. (FSOA scores on a six-point scale.) FSO candidates can receive 0.17 bump-up points for any one language listed here if they pass a telephone language test at a speaking level 3 after passing the FSOA. The following eight languages are currently eligible for higher bump-up points: Arabic; Chinese (Mandarin); Hindi; Persian (Dari); Persian (Farsi); Pashto; Urdu; and Korean. Candidates testing in the eight languages eligible for higher points need only a level 2 speaking ability (as measured on the telephone test) to obtain the 0.17 language bump-up points. Generalist candidates, who pass the Office Assessment, receive a link to the Career Candidate Handbook, which describes how to arrange a telephone language test conducted by the Department of State’s Foreign Service Institute (FSI).To receive the higher bump-up points, candidates who pass the telephone test will then need to pass an in-person, two-hour speaking and reading test conducted by the Foreign Service Institute in Arlington, Virginia. Any costs associated with the in-person test (travel, lodging in Washington, etc.) are at the candidate’s expense. Those who achieve a minimum score of 3 speaking and 2 reading (S3/R2) will be eligible to receive a total of 0.38 bump-up points. Candidates who receive a rating of at least 2 speaking and 1 reading (S2/R1) but less than 3 speaking and 2 reading (S3/R2) will be eligible to receive a total of 0.25 bump-up points. Generalist candidates who choose to take the in-person test and do not meet the minimum S2/R1 score will forfeit ALL language bonus points in that tested language including any they may have earned through the earlier telephone-administered test.\n\nLanguage points will be granted for one language only. Candidates may test in another language only if they fail the initial test or if the second language has a higher point value. They may telephone retest in the same language after six months. Candidates who do not pass the in-person FSI test may take a first retest after six months; any further in-person retests are authorized only after a one-year interval from the last full test in that language. Telephone language scores are valid for 18 months or the length of any candidacy initiated during the 18-month language score validity period. In-person tests are valid for five years or the length of a candidacy initiated during the five-year period. A candidacy begins on the date a candidate takes the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT). Most candidates will need a security clearance specific to the country where the language is spoken before being granted the higher language bump-up. Generalist candidates who seek a 0.38 language bump-up must agree to serve in a position where that language is required once during their first two assignments and once after reaching mid-level grades of the Foreign Service. Candidates must complete their second service commitment prior to being able to compete for the Senior Foreign Service. Generalist candidates who qualify for 0.25 bump-up points must agree to serve once during their first two assignments in a post where that language is spoken.\n\nFor information to help you assess your own speaking level, visit http://www.govtilr.org and click on “Speaking” under the skill-level descriptions for a general description of the expected proficiency. The speaking self-assessment tool, available on the same site, will also help you estimate your language proficiency."
