        "text": "What is neuropsychological testing?\n\nNeuropsychological testing refers to a number of tests that healthcare providers use to get information about how your brain works. Specially trained psychologists — neuropsychologists — look at the results to better understand the relationship between your brain health and behavior, and mood and thinking (cognition). These tests can help healthcare providers:\n\nDetermine a diagnosis. Your healthcare provider may use your neuropsychological test results to help understand the cause of your issues with thinking and understanding. For example, let’s say you’re having difficulties with memory. Your results might help your provider distinguish between normal changes from aging, a neurological illness, depression, anxiety or other causes.\n\nIdentify strengths and weaknesses in your thinking processes (cognition). Sometimes, your healthcare provider may order tests if you’ve had a neurological injury, like a stroke or traumatic brain injury. They may also test you to get a baseline, for instance, if you play contact sports or have a family history of dementia. This way, your healthcare team can compare future test results to help understand how you’re doing. They may also use baseline results to see whether a treatment is helping you.\n\nUnderstand your personal risk for changes in your ability to think that can occur with certain brain surgeries.\n\nDevelop plans for future treatment and interventions like occupational or speech therapy. Providers can use test results to decide the focus of rehab or which strengths might be able to compensate for weaknesses. They may also use neuropsychological test results to recommend adjustments to school or work schedules or to determine which skills are most important to you to work on.\n\nWhat does a neuropsychological evaluation test for?\n\nIn a neuropsychological evaluation, your provider tests your mental functions, which may include:\n\nGeneral intellect.\n\nReading/reading comprehension.\n\nYour ability to use language and understand what others say.\n\nAttention/concentration.\n\nHow much time it takes you to receive, understand and respond to information (processing speed).\n\nLearning and memory.\n\nReasoning.\n\nHigher-level skills you use to organize and plan, manage your time, problem solve, multitask, make judgments and maintain self-control (executive functions).\n\nYour ability to understand the relationships between objects and space (visuospatial skills). This includes things like drawing, tying shoes, making a bed, etc.\n\nFine motor skills.\n\nMood and personality.\n\nWhat does neuropsychological testing diagnose?\n\nNeuropsychological testing doesn’t diagnose a condition directly. But it can give your healthcare providers more information to help them diagnose and manage conditions like:\n\nAlzheimer’s disease.\n\nBrain tumors.\n\nDementia.\n\nEpilepsy.\n\nLearning disabilities.\n\nTransient ischemic attack and stroke.\n\nTraumatic brain injury.\n\nParkinson’s disease and other movement disorders.\n\nMultiple sclerosis.\n\nWhen is neuropsychological testing done?\n\nHealthcare providers, like neurologists and primary care specialists, might want neuropsychological testing if they notice trends or changes such as:\n\nAn unexplained change in personality, like an increase in anxiety or depression, the development of delusions or hallucinations.\n\nChanges in short-term memory, like asking the same question over and over.\n\nDifficulty communicating or interacting with others.\n\nDifficulty speaking or finding words.\n\nDifficulty drawing or using a map.\n\nFrequently losing items or getting lost easily.\n\nNew difficulty with understanding or managing bills or finances.\n\nPoor attention and concentration.\n\nPoor judgment/decision-making.\n\nTrouble recognizing familiar people, like close family members and friends.\n\nTrouble staying organized or completing tasks.\n\nHow does the neuropsychological testing work?\n\nYour neuropsychologist may ask you to complete surveys about your mood and psychological symptoms before your testing appointment. Or if your child is having neuropsychological testing, their healthcare team will likely ask you to fill out questionnaires about your child’s behavior.\n\nAt the appointment, they’ll talk with you so they understand any concerns you and your family members might have about your cognitive (mental) functioning. They’ll also review your medical and psychological history and educational and work background. If a family member comes to the evaluation with you, your provider may also ask for your permission to interview them. And if your child is getting tested, the neuropsychologist will interview you both as appropriate.\n\nThis initial groundwork helps your neuropsychologist choose which tests to give you. A trained technician who works under the supervision of a neuropsychologist — a psychometrist — gives you the tests.\n\nYou’ll complete several tests for memory, cognition, verbal communication and motor skills. They typically involve:\n\nWriting or drawing.\n\nSolving puzzles or answering questions.\n\nResponding to things presented on a computer.\n\nMost people find some of the tests to be quite easy and others to be difficult. You aren’t expected to get everything right and no one “fails.” The point of the testing is to identify your personal strengths and weaknesses. It’s important to work as hard as possible on all the tests so the results are accurate and helpful.\n\nFinally, your healthcare team scores and interprets the results.\n\nHow do I prepare for the test?\n\nYou’ll want to function at your best to get the most accurate results. To do this:\n\nGet a good night’s sleep.\n\nTry to eat a good breakfast.\n\nTake all of your medications as usual unless you’re directly instructed to do otherwise.\n\nBring along any glasses, contact lenses, hearing aids or other assistive devices.\n\nShare with your care team the results of any past neuropsychological, psychological or academic testing. This includes records of any intellectual evaluation, psychoeducational evaluation, multifactored evaluation (MFE). If your child has an individual education program (IEP), bring a copy of that as well.\n\nWhat are the risks of this test?\n\nThere aren’t really any risks related to neuropsychological tests. But the testing often takes several hours. This can lead some people to feel tired, over-stimulated and agitated. Be sure to plan an easy dinner for the evening of the test. If your child is getting tested, don’t expect much from them for the rest of the day (and be gentle with yourself, too).\n\nHow are neuropsychological test results interpreted?\n\nMost of the tests are given the same way to everyone (standardized). Your neuropsychologist will compare your results with those of others who are the same age, and sometimes, with people who have the same educational background (norm-referenced).\n\nWhat type of results do you get and what do the results mean?\n\nYour neuropsychologist will write an in-depth report that explains your results. The report identifies both your strengths and any areas where you didn’t perform as expected. It includes recommendations and interventions to improve these skills, and possibly, referrals to other professionals. They won’t give you a diagnosis, but with your permission, they’ll share your results with your healthcare team.\n\nWhen should I know the results of the test?\n\nIt usually takes a couple of weeks for your neuropsychologist to score the tests, interpret the results and make recommendations. During this time, try to busy yourself with daily tasks and activities so you don’t worry too much about your results."
