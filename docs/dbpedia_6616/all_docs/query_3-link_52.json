        "text": "Setting Up Your Business in California\n\nWhether you’re starting a brand-new business, expanding or relocating, avoid expensive mistakes by making sure your entity is registered and permitted as required by State laws.\n\nPick Your Business Location\n\nYour operating address determines zoning, taxes, and regulations.\n\nChoose a Business Structure\n\nChoose a business structure that strikes the right balance of legal protections and benefits.\n\nChoose a Business Name\n\nYour name is your brand so it must reflect all the aspects of your business plan.\n\nRegister Your Business\n\nRegister your business as a legal entity in the State of California.\n\nGet Federal & State Tax ID Numbers\n\nBe prepared to pay your state and federal taxes on time.\n\nApply for Licenses and Permits\n\nMake sure you know what is required for your location and activities.\n\nOpen a Business Bank Account\n\nYour name is your brand so it must reflect all the aspects of your business plan.\n\nGet Business Insurance\n\nProtect yourself from accidents, disasters, and lawsuits.\n\nYou are a California business if any of these statements are true:\n\nYour business has a physical presence in the state\n\nYou have frequent in-person meetings with clients in the state\n\nA significant portion of your revenue comes from the state\n\nAny of your employees work in the state\n\nGetting coaching from a business advisor in our small business center network is always a good idea for this process.\n\nPick Your Business Location\n\nYour business address is a highly strategic decision: it determines the taxes, zoning laws, regulations your business must operate under as well as impacting your cost of doing business.\n\nDo your homework considering these factors:\n\nYour target market and customer\n\nCost of living and cost of commercial leases\n\nTransportation accessibility for workers and suppliers\n\nPermitting & licensing and other regulatory requirements\n\nState and local taxes\n\nAccess to suppliers and business services\n\nWorkforce availability\n\nZoning\n\nYour personal preferences\n\nUsing your home or office address as your business address may not always be the best option. A registered agent is a third-party entity that acts as your business address and receives important legal and tax documents on your behalf. A registered agent can provide privacy and anonymity, create a professional image and credibility, simplified mail and document management, and compliance with state regulations. Be sure to do your research and choose a reputable provider.\n\nWhether you will be a home-based business or will occupy commercial space, consult your local planning department to be sure your business activities are permitted. If your business will be located in an unincorporated area, consult the county.\n\nConsult with your local Small Business Center and local economic development teams including economic development corporations, chambers of commerce and workforce development boards.\n\nYou can also use these online tools:\n\nCommunity Data\n\nRegional Profiles | California Community Economic Development\n\nCalGold Permit Assistance Tool\n\nChoose a Business Structure\n\nThis impacts everything from day-to-day operations, to taxes, to how much of your personal assets are at risk.\n\nA sole proprietorship is the easiest to form and gives you, the owner, complete control. If you don’t register as another kind of entity, then you’re automatically qualified as a sole proprietorship. The risk is that your business and personal assets and liabilities are not separate. This means you can be held personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. A sole proprietorship can be the right choice for low-risk business activities or as a temporary status while you test your business ideas.\n\nOther business structures include:\n\nGeneral Partnerships (GP)\n\nLimited Partnerships (LP)\n\nLimited Liability Partnerships (LLP)\n\nLimited Liability Companies (LLC)\n\nC corp\n\nS corp\n\nBenefit corporations\n\nClose corporations\n\nNonprofit corporations\n\nWorker cooperatives and other forms of employee ownership\n\nWe recommend consulting with an attorney or tax consultant to fully understand the differences, but here are some good starter references:\n\nChoose a business structure | U.S. Small Business Administration (sba.gov)\n\nTypes of employee ownership | Project Equity (project-equity.org)\n\nChoose a Business Name\n\nIf your business name includes your legal last name, then your work is done. Any other name other than the owner’s last name requires filing a Fictitious Business Name statement.\n\nFor example, James Smith owns a sole proprietorship, and his business name is James Smith Painting. He does NOT need to file a fictitious business name. But if the business name were James and Sons Painting or House Painting Fast, then he DOES need a fictitious business name.\n\nLet’s say that James Smith instead owns either a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or a corporation, and then wants to open up additional businesses under the LLC or corporation parent. He needs to file a fictitious business name statement for any business name not stated in the original articles of incorporation or articles of organization filed with the state.\n\nHow to Register a Fictitious Business Name. A fictitious business name statement (known as Doing Business As or DBA) must be registered with the city and/or county clerk in the county of the registrant’s principal place of business if the business is:\n\nA sole proprietorship doing business under a name not containing the owner’s surname\n\nA partnership\n\nA corporation operating under a name other than its legal name\n\nYou must file for your DBA within the first 40 days of operating your business or before your current DBA expires. Fees and documentation requirements are determined by the county or city.\n\nWithin 30 days after filing a DBA, you must publish the statement in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of its principal place of business. The notice must appear once a week for four successive weeks. Within 30 days of the last publishing date, you must then file an affidavit of publication with the county clerk’s office.\n\nUse the CalGold Permit Assistance Tool to find the local agency where you must file for a DBA.\n\nFictitious business names are not filed with the Secretary of State’s Office. There is no provision in California for registration of fictitious business names.\n\nTIP: Even though a proposed corporate name has been checked and/or reserved, don’t buy stationery, signage, or other collateral until you receive notification of filing from your local agency and/or the Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nRegister Your Business\n\nAfter you’ve decided your business structure, you’ll need to register your business with the state, local and federal agencies.\n\nBusiness Entity Filing. Business entity filing is not necessary for sole proprietors, but if you intend to form a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, you must file with the California Secretary of State (SOS).\n\nSecretary of State: BizFile Online\n\nFor Employers:\n\nEmployer Registration: An employer is required to file a Registration Form within 15 days after paying more than $100 in wages to one or more employees. Consult the Employment Development Department (EDD).\n\nWorkers’ Compensation: Businesses with one or more employees must maintain Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Consult the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR).\n\nWages, Hours, & Working Conditions: Businesses with employees must comply with laws establishing minimum standards for wages, hours, and working conditions. Consult the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR).\n\nState Contracting. If you want to do business with the state, then you need additional certifications as a Small Business (SB) or Disabled Veteran Business Entity (DVBE).\n\nDepartment of General Services: SB/DVBE Certification\n\nStatewide Supplier Diversity Program\n\nMore Resources from CalOSBA:\n\nDoing Business with the State\n\nBeneficial Ownership. As of January 1, 2024, many companies in the United States will have to report information about their beneficial owners: the individuals who own or control the company. Beneficial ownership reporting is a requirement of the Corporate Transparency Act of 2021 that means filing a report to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nNewly created companies have 90 calendar days to file after receiving actual or public notice that their company’s creation or registration is effective. A report only needs to be submitted once, unless you need to update or correct information.\n\nU.S. Department of Treasury: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n\nGet Federal and State Tax ID Numbers\n\nThe California Tax Service Center is a partnership of tax agencies, including the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (Formerly the Board of Equalization), Employment Development Department, Franchise Tax Board, and Internal Revenue Service. It provides information related to payroll, personal and business corporate income, franchise, and sales and use taxes.\n\nCalifornia Tax Service Center\n\nState Income Tax (FTB)\n\nAll businesses are required to file state income tax with the Franchise Tax Board.\n\nSeller’s Permit (CDTFA)\n\nIf you will be selling tangible property, consult the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.\n\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS)\n\nEmployers with employees, business partnerships, and corporations, must obtain a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nApply for Licenses and Permits\n\nBusiness License Filing. Most local governments require a business license. If your business will be located in an incorporated city, you would obtain this from the city. If your business will be located in an unincorporated area, you would obtain this from the county.\n\nProfessional Licenses & Permits. A wide variety of activities may require you as the business operator to obtain a license before getting started. You may need both local and state permits depending on where you’re operating and the type of business. The CalGold website assists you in finding appropriate permit information and contact information for the various agencies that administer and issue these permits.\n\nCalGold Permit Assistance Tool\n\nMore Resources from CalOSBA:\n\nGuide to Permits, Licensing & Regulations\n\nOpen a Business Bank Account\n\nAs soon as you start accepting or spending money on behalf of your business, you should open a business bank account. Business-owners skip this step at their peril. Here’s why we recommend keeping your business banking separate from your personal banking.\n\nProtection. Business banking offers limited personal liability protection by keeping your business funds separate from your personal funds. Merchant services also offer purchase protection for your customers and ensures that their personal information is secure.\n\nCredibility. Customers will be able to pay you with credit cards and make checks out to your business instead of directly to you. If you have employees, then they can handle some transactions on your behalf.\n\nPreparedness. Business banking usually comes with the option for a line of credit for the company. This can be used in the event of an emergency, or if your business needs new equipment. It also establishes a credit history for your business that will help you obtain bigger loans when you need them.\n\nBusiness account types include checking accounts, savings accounts, credit card accounts, and merchant services accounts that allow you to accept credit and debit card transactions.\n\nYou’ll need a federal EIN to open a business banking account or a Social Security number if you’re a sole proprietor.\n\nOpen a business bank account | U.S. Small Business Administration\n\nGet Business Insurance\n\nAccidents, natural disasters, and lawsuits can put you out of business. If you have business property or employees, you are legally required to carry some of these insurance policies.\n\nBasic types of business insurance policies include:\n\nProperty/renters: Provides replacement costs for lost or damaged property\n\nBusiness vehicle: Provides repair costs for vehicle damage\n\nLiability: Protects from lawsuits arising from bodily injury or property damage\n\nProfessional Liability: Protects from lawsuits arising from negligence\n\nWorkers’ Compensation: Employees who become injured or ill on the job\n\nCommercial Property: Protects building, inventory, and equipment\n\nNatural Hazard: Protects you from local threats in your community\n\nBusiness interruption: Replaces business income lost in a disaster\n\nIf you run your business from home, you can also add coverage to your homeowner’s insurance as a rider to protect your business equipment and liability coverage for third-party injuries.\n\nCalifornia Department of Insurance: Small Business Guide To Commercial Insurance (ca.gov)\n\nIf you’re operating a business in an area at high risk of fire, you may have trouble obtaining coverage through the private market. This is why businesses can also obtain commercial insurance through the California FAIR Plan. It’s costly and that’s why it’s known as the “insurance of last resort”. But consider this option if you’re having trouble getting insured through traditional means.\n\nCalifornia FAIR Plan Association: The California FAIR Plan (cfpnet.com)\n\nMore Resources from CalOSBA\n\nLearn to evaluate the real-world hazards to your business and create a Business Resiliency Roadmap that mitigates your risks.
