        "text": "NOTE: The NAEP long-term trend (LTT) reading and mathematics scales range from 0 to 500. Because the scales were developed separately for each subject, comparisons cannot be made from one subject to another. Black includes African American. Hispanic includes Latino. Race categories exclude Hispanic origin. The information about National School Lunch Program (NSLP) variable is based on available school records. If school records were not available, the student was classified as \"Information not available.\" The category \"students with disabilities\" includes students identified as having either an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or protection under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The results for students with disabilities and English learners are based on students who were assessed and cannot be generalized to the total population of such students. See more information about student group variables. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding or the omission of categories. Although the estimates (e.g., average scores or percentages) are shown as rounded numbers in the charts, the positions of the data points in the graphics are based on the unrounded numbers. Unrounded numbers were used for calculating the differences between the estimates, and for the statistical comparison test when the estimates were compared to each other. Not all apparent differences between estimates are statistically significant. NAEP reports results using widely accepted statistical standards; findings are reported based on a statistical significance level set at .05, with appropriate adjustments for multiple comparisons. Only those differences that are found to be statistically significant are referred to as \"higher\" or \"lower.\"\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics, National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), various years, 1971â€“2022 Long-Term Trend (LTT) Reading and Mathematics Assessments."
