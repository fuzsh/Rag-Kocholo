The hero LiveScore app delivers world-class content and editorial alongside the fastest and most reliable updates on the matches that matter to them.\n\nThe latest edition of the app features lightning-fast notifications, aggregated and curated news feeds and even post-match highlights of English Premier League matches. Player profile and rich team stats contribute to a further enhanced offering, in addition to live highlights as part of a seamless user experience.\n\nAbout LiveScore Bet\n\nLiveScore Bet™, is a sportsbook offering customers in the UK, Ireland, Nigeria and the Netherlands a new and improved betting experience within the LiveScore ecosystem. Building on the existing user relationship with the trusted LiveScore brand that is already a core part of the live sport experience, LiveScore Bet seeks to deliver a best-in-class product and represents a new opportunity for customers to bet responsibly.
