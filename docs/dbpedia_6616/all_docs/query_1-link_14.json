        "text": "Portugal-based Score Consulting has been acquired by Conclusion, a Netherlands-headquartered consulting and technology services group.\n\nFounded in 2005 in Lisbon, Score Consulting is an IT consultancy firm specialised in SAP transformations. The firm (145 staff) operates as a full-service partner for the design, implementation, and support of SAP solutions. Score Consulting also has capabilities in emerging technologies, such as robotic process automation and advanced analytics.\n\nBuyer Conclusion is a firm consisting of around 25 consulting and technology companies in the Netherlands. Combined, the group – which operates with a fairly decentralised model – employs over 2.000 consultants and staff.\n\nCommenting on the joining of forces with Conclusion, Pedro Deusdado, director of Score Consulting, said: “Our ambition is to be a relevant player in the Portuguese market. We believe that this partnership with Conclusion will help us significantly to continue the steady growth path of the recent years.”\n\n“Conclusion’s ecosystem will broaden our services and expertise, allowing us to better serve our customers with more comprehensive solutions.”\n\nDeusdado added that the move will also boost the firm’s attractiveness towards talent. “We will become a more attractive working place for existing and new talent, offering access to international projects and knowledge.”\n\nMeanwhile, for Conclusion, the move marks its entry into the Portuguese consulting market, and continues its internationalisation strategy unveiled at the start of this year. In February, Conclusion closed a major refinancing round (around €410 million) with the aim of beefing up its capabilities in the Netherlands – and going international.\n\nKicking off the latter pillar, in July, Conclusion acquired South Africa based Lalandi (Cape Town), adding an offshore delivery centre to its network. Now, Portugal is the firm’s second international move, with Germany next in line, said CEO Engbert Verkoren in a statement.\n\n“With the acquisition of Score Consulting, we are establishing our first stronghold in Portugal,” he said. “Score Consulting is an established player with an excellent reputation in the Portuguese market and European SAP community. We are delighted to be able to add them to our ecosystem.”\n\nScore Consulting will also provide Conclusion with a foot in a number of other markets. The firm serves clients in a number of countries, mainly in North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt) and the Spanish-speaking market of Latin America (such as Brazil)."
