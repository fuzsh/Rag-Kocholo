        "text": "There are many reasons why you might get different results when you take the test more than once and the answer to this question might not be the same for everyone. It could mean that your attitude is highly variable, possibly due to it being a weak attitude. It could mean that your attitude changed in between tests. It could mean that you were more or less distracted or tired when you completed the test one time as compared to the other. It could also mean that the test is not working well.\n\nThere simply is not yet a scientific consensus on whether it is a problem to get two different IAT scores from the same test and if so, how big of a problem it might be. It is important for us that we are transparent about this disagreement. A lot of the scientific process consists of using data to work out disagreements, and this is one that our field has been working through for several years.\n\nOne of the questions that has been raised is whether the IAT measures something long-standing about a person that does not change much over time (like an adult’s height) or something that changes a lot due to the circumstances of the moment (like whether a person feels hungry or full).\n\nIf the test measures a trait (similar to your height), then getting different scores close in time might suggest that something is wrong with the test. However, if the test measures a state (similar to hunger), then getting different scores might be evidence that the test is, in fact, working as it should be.\n\nWe do know that “practice effects” can sometimes affect one’s score. That is, people tend to receive more neutral scores the more times they complete the IAT. This result is most likely because the person has had a chance to practice how to sort the words and/or pictures; they get faster at pairing things as they become more familiar with the task and the items that they are asked to pair.\n\nIn sum, taking an IAT should be an educational experience and an opportunity for reflection – to think about yourself and your mind in a way that you may not have before. Until we know precisely how much an individual score can tell us about a person and their future behavior, we recommend that you do not take any individual IAT score to mean something permanent about yourself, or about another person taking the test. However, this should not be taken to mean that the IAT does not or cannot measure something meaningful or important in the moment. It indicates that we should interpret any individual score with caution."
