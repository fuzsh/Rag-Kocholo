        "text": "We will release the following measures of diversity to clearly present and analyze the complexity of the 2020 Census results compared to the 2010 Census results:\n\nDiversity Index.\n\nPrevalence rankings and diffusion score.\n\nPrevalence maps.\n\nIn this blog, we provide a preview of these measures and explain what each can tell you about the nation’s racial and ethnic composition and diversity.\n\nThe concept of “composition” refers to the racial and ethnic makeup of a population.\n\nThe concept of “diversity” refers to the representation and relative size of different racial and ethnic groups within a population, where diversity is maximized when all groups are represented in an area and have equal shares of the population.\n\nFirst, it’s important to know how we collect and tabulate data on race and ethnicity in the 2020 Census. Like other statistical agencies, we follow standards on race and ethnicity set by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 1997. These standards guide how the federal government collects and presents data on these topics. Per these standards:\n\nThe 2020 Census collected data on Hispanic origin and race in two separate questions.\n\nWe tabulated the responses based on standard categories.\n\nFor race, the OMB standards identify five minimum categories:\n\nWhite\n\nBlack or African American\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\n\nAsian\n\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\n\nWe use a sixth category, Some Other Race, for people who do not identify with any of the OMB race categories.\n\nWe tabulate statistics on people who report only one race in one of these six “race alone” categories, and we include people who report multiple races in the “Multiracial” population, also referred to as the “Two or More Races” population.\n\nFor ethnicity, the OMB standards classify individuals in one of two categories: “Hispanic or Latino” or “Not Hispanic or Latino.” We use the term “Hispanic or Latino” interchangeably with the term “Hispanic,” and also refer to this concept as “ethnicity.”\n\nThe OMB standards also emphasize that people of Hispanic origin may be of any race. In data tables, we often cross-tabulate the race and Hispanic origin categories to display Hispanic as a single category and the non-Hispanic race groups as categories summing up to the total population.\n\nThese diversity calculations require the use of mutually exclusive racial and ethnic (nonoverlapping) categories. For our analyses, we calculate the Hispanic or Latino population of any race as a category; each of the race alone, non-Hispanic groups as individual categories; and the Multiracial non-Hispanic group as a distinct category.\n\nThe following groups are used in the diversity calculations:\n\nHispanic\n\nWhite alone, non-Hispanic\n\nBlack or African American alone, non-Hispanic\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native alone, non-Hispanic\n\nAsian alone, non-Hispanic\n\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, non-Hispanic\n\nSome Other Race alone, non-Hispanic\n\nMultiracial, non-Hispanic\n\nThe recent blog Improvements to the 2020 Census Hispanic Origin and Race Questions and Coding Procedures describes how we code write-in responses into these standard categories.\n\nOne of the measures we will use to present the 2020 Census results is the Diversity Index, or DI. This index shows the probability that two people chosen at random will be from different race and ethnic groups.\n\nThe DI is bounded between 0 and 1, with a zero-value indicating that everyone in the population has the same racial and ethnic characteristics, while a value close to 1 indicates that everyone in the population has different characteristics.\n\nWe converted the probabilities into percentages to make the results easier to interpret. In this format, the DI tells us the chance that two people chosen at random will be from different racial and ethnic groups.\n\nTo illustrate how the DI works, we compare the composition of three hypothetical populations below.\n\nIn Figure 1, the population is made up of only two large and even groups. The DI for this population indicates that there is a 50% chance that two people chosen at random will be from different race and ethnic groups.\n\nWe can also measure racial and ethnic diversity using prevalence rankings and the diffusion score.\n\nWith prevalence rankings, which show the most common group in an area, we look at patterns in the percentage of the population that falls into the largest race or ethnic group, second-largest group, and third-largest group. The prevalence ranking approach uses tables or graphs to show the percentages of the largest groups.\n\nFrom the rankings on 2010 Census data, we find:\n\nThe White alone, non-Hispanic population was the largest racial or ethnic group in the United States at 63.7%.\n\nThe Hispanic population was the second-largest at 16.3%.\n\nThe Black or African American alone, non-Hispanic population was third-largest at 12.2%.\n\nThe diffusion score measures the percentage of the population that is not in the first-, second- or third-largest racial and ethnic groups combined. This metric tells us how diverse and unconcentrated the population is relative to the three largest groups.\n\nFor example, the diffusion score for the United States was 7.7% in 2010, as 7.7% of the population was not one of the three largest racial or ethnic groups. When we look across the country, we see a lot of variation in the diffusion scores by state in 2010.\n\nThe diffusion score was highest in Hawaii at 20.1%, indicating that one-fifth of the population was in a racial or ethnic group that was not one of the three largest groups for the state.\n\nThe next highest diffusion score was for Alaska with 15.1%, followed by Oklahoma with 14.3%.\n\nThe lowest diffusion score was in West Virginia at 2.1%.\n\nWe chose this new set of diversity measures — the DI, prevalence maps, prevalence ranking, and diffusion scores — because they have clear conceptual definitions and interpretations. They also overcome some of the limitations of the diversity measures we have used in the past.\n\nIn the past, the Census Bureau had sometimes used the concept of “majority” and “minority” for measuring diversity, but this approach has several conceptual and practical challenges that limit its ability to illustrate the complex racial and ethnic diversity of the U.S. population.\n\nFor example, while some people classify individuals who identify with multiple population groups (such as Hispanic and White; White and Black or African American; and White and Asian) as part of the majority population, others classify them as part of the minority population. The dual identities of these groups highlight the social, political and economic complexities of race and ethnicity in 21st century U.S. society.\n\nThe inclusion of certain groups as part of the “majority” or “minority” has also become more complex and contested in recent decades, especially as many people may not identify with certain population groups even if that is how they are classified and tabulated per federal standards. The majority-minority approach is ambiguous, and it is further complicated by complex demographic and social realities.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we focused on these alternative race and ethnicity diversity measures to illustrate the racial and ethnic composition of the 2020 Census results. We plan to explore other diversity measures as part of our future research with 2020 Census data.\n\nThe analyses scheduled for release later this month will provide a complementary perspective to the statistics in the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File and will help the public to understand the racial and ethnic makeup of the U.S. population and the myriad diversity of identities that people share."
