        "text": "International Judging System (IJS)\n\nIn the IJS, competitors accumulate points based on the degree of difficulty (base value) of each technical element and how well each element is executed (grade of execution, or GOE). Skaters also earn points based on their overall skating ability and performance level through program component scores.\n\nTechnical Panel\n\nA technical panel of five people includes a technical controller, two technical specialists, a data operator and a video replay operator. During each performance, technical specialist 1 identifies each element and the level of difficulty as defined by the International Skating Union.\n\nThe technical controller and technical specialist 2 support the primary technical specialist to ensure all elements are correctly identified. Final decisions on elements and levels are determined by the majority opinion of the controller and two specialists.\n\nBoth specialists and the controller are recorded with an audio tape during each program, and video will be available to verify calls. The elements can be reviewed after a skater’s performance, and scores can be changed accordingly. The scores are final once they are posted and announced to the public.\n\nJudges\n\nA maximum of nine judges make up the judging panel at a competition. The judges focus completely on scoring the quality of each technical element and the five program components for each skater. A computer keeps track of comparative scores, records results and calculates totals to determine placements.\n\nTotal Element Score\n\nEach element of the program is assigned a base value, which gives skaters credit for every element they perform. Some elements, such as spins and step sequences, have levels of difficulty on which the base values are established.\n\nJudges grade the quality of each element using a grade of execution score within a range of -5 to +5, which is added to or deducted from the base value. GOEs are proportional to the base value of each element.\n\nThe highest and lowest scores for each element are thrown out, and the remaining scores are averaged to determine the final GOE for each element. The GOE is then added to or subtracted from the base value for each element, and the sum of the scores for all elements forms the total element score.\n\nProgram Components\n\nThe judges will award points on a scale from 0.25 to 10 (in increments of 0.25) for three program components to grade overall presentation. As with GOEs, the highest and lowest scores for each component are thrown out, and the remaining scores are averaged. The final program components scores are then multiplied by a set factor to ensure the total element score and program components score are balanced.\n\nThe three program components are:\n\nComposition - The intentional, developed and/or original arrangement of the repertoire of all types of movements\n\ninto a meaningful whole according to the principles of proportion, unity, space, pattern and musical structure.\n\nPresentation - The demonstration of engagement, commitment and involvement based on an understanding of the\n\nmusic and composition.\n\nSkating Skills - The ability of the skater to execute the skating repertoire of steps, turns and skating movement, with\n\nblade and body control.\n\nSegment Score\n\nThe total element score is added to the program components score to determine the segment score (short program/rhythm dance or free skate/dance). The scores for each segment are then added together to determine the competition score. The skater with the highest competition score is declared the winner.\n\nThe IJS is used at events in the national qualifying structure including the U.S. Championships as well as many local competitions at the juvenile through senior levels, including Excel.\n\nThe 6.0 Judging System\n\nThe 6.0 system has been the longstanding judging system for figure skating. Today, U.S. Figure Skating uses it for Compete USA events and many nonqualifying competitions, particularly at the pre-juvenile level and below.\n\nThe basic principle of the 6.0 system is a “majority” system. Each event is judged by an odd number of judges, and the winner of the event is the skater placed highest by a majority of these judges.\n\nFor all singles and pairs events and the free dance, judges award two marks: one for technical merit and one for program presentation. The technical merit mark expresses a judge’s evaluation of the quality of the required elements skated. The presentation mark reflects a judge’s assessment of the program as a whole — its composition, originality, use of ice, skater’s style and expression of the music.\n\nThe Scoring Scale\n\nEach judge will award marks ranging from 0.0 to 6.0, based on the following scale:\n\n0 - not skated\n\n1 - very poor\n\n2 - poor\n\n3 - mediocre\n\n4 - good\n\n5 - very good\n\n6 - outstanding\n\nHow do IJS and 6.0 Differ?\n\nThe IJS is based on cumulative points rather than the 6.0 standard of marks and placement. The IJS focuses on the skaters and not the judges. Judges don’t have to use their memory to compare all aspects of every skater and figure out where to place them, but simply evaluate the qualities of each performance."
