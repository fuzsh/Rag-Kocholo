You must meet high academic, physical, character and medical standards to be eligible for an appointment. Knowing what these standards are is the first step to surpassing them.\n\nBasic Requirements\n\nEvery cadet is different, but to earn an appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy, you must meet certain basic requirements.\n\nBe at least 17 but not past your 23rd birthday by July 1 of the year you enter the Academy.\n\nBe a United States citizen.\n\nBe unmarried with no dependents.\n\nBe of good moral character.\n\nAcademic\n\nProving You Belong Begins in the Classroom\n\nCadets who attend the U.S. Air Force Academy can expect to be challenged academically every day. That’s why we look for those who demonstrate a well-rounded academic record that includes exceptional class rank, GPA and college admission test results.\n\nAcademic Requirements\n\nPhysical\n\nPreparing Cadets Physically as Well as Mentally\n\nPhysical fitness is an integral part of Academy life, whether it’s participating in sports or Basic Cadet Training (BCT). Therefore, applicants must successfully complete the Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA), which tests their strength, agility, speed and endurance.\n\nPhysical Requirements\n\nCharacter\n\nOfficers of Character Begin as Cadets of Character\n\nTo lead others as an officer in the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force requires high moral character. That’s why at the U.S. Air Force Academy, we look at more than grades and physical fitness. Every cadet goes through a qualitative review as part of the application process.\n\nCharacter Requirements\n\nMedical\n\nMaking Sure You’re Physically Fit for the Job\n\nTo prepare cadets for their careers in the U.S. Air Force or U.S. Space Force, we require applicants to meet and maintain certain physical standards during their four years at the Academy.\n\nMedical Requirements\n\nCommitment\n\nSpend Your Career Leading Others, Not Paying Off Debt\n\nAn education at the U.S. Air Force Academy is provided at no cost to cadets. Instead, once you graduate, you will commission as an officer in the U.S. Air Force or Space Force. The length of your commitment will depend on your career path, but the benefits will last a lifetime.\n\nAbout Commitment"
