        "text": "RECEPTION AND CLASSIFICATION PROCESS\n\nWhat takes place when an incarcerated person first arrives to the prison?\n\nUpon arrival to a prison Reception Center, the incarcerated person must go through the reception and classification process. This could take up to 90 days. Once all the incarcerated person’s case factors are reviewed he/she/they will be assigned a classification score. He/she/they will then be recommended for appropriate placement at an institution based on his/her/their level. The incarcerated person’s family location is taken into consideration, however, being placed near family is not guaranteed due to many other factors.\n\nCan I call the incarcerated person or can he/she/they call me while in the reception process?\n\nWhile in Reception Center, the incarcerated persons are given a phone call within the first week and once a week thereafter as part of the Reception process. These calls will be made collect to the account the family sets up and are monitored by the institution. Incarcerated persons can also receive mail and writing supplies. Specifically, they can receive one hundred (maximum 100 per incarcerated person) sheets of yellow or white lined writing paper (no spiral metal binding, no cardboard, and no plastic wrap), forty embossed/metered envelopes from the post office, forty stamps, and forty blank envelopes (40 maximum per incarcerated person).\n\nTo send mail to the incarcerated person, address your letters this way.\n\nName, CDC#\n\nInstitution\n\nFacility, Building #, Cell #\n\nPO Box ____\n\nCity, State Zip Code\n\nCan I visit the incarcerated person while he/she/they is housed in the reception center?\n\nUpon completing the visiting application process and being an approved visitor, you can visit an incarcerated person in the reception center. Reception Center visiting takes place behind glass and is by appointment only. (For further information on visiting return to the Visiting Link)\n\nHow does the Department determine which institution an incarcerated person will be housed in?\n\nBelow is a listing of the placement scores that determine which level an incarcerated person will be placed in:\n\nINCARCERATED PERSON PLACEMENT (SECURITY LEVEL)\n\nExcept as provided in section 3375.2, each incarcerated person shall be assigned to a facility with a security level, which corresponds to the following placement score ranges:\n\n(1) An incarcerated person with a placement score of 0 through 18 shall be placed in a Level I facility.\n\n(2) An incarcerated person with a placement score of 19 through 35 shall be placed in a Level II facility.\n\n(3) An incarcerated person with a placement score of 36 through 59 shall be placed in a Level III facility.\n\n(4) An incarcerated person with a placement score of 60 and above shall be placed in a Level IV facility.\n\nPlacement Scores are determined by a thorough review of an incarcerated person’s case factors to include: age, crime committed and if violence was used, prior incarcerations, gang involvement, etc. Each year an annual review is performed by a Counselor to determine if an incarcerated person meets the criteria to have his/her/their placement score reduced. An incarcerated person has the opportunity to reduce their score if they have been programming and have not received any disciplinary actions. In contrast an incarcerated person’s score and subsequent housing level can be increased due to receiving disciplinary actions.\n\nWhat is meant by security levels?\n\nLevel I – Facilities and Camps consist primarily of open dormitories with a low security perimeter.\n\nLevel II – Facilities consist primarily of open dormitories with a secure perimeter, which may include armed coverage.\n\nLevel III – Facilities primarily have a secure perimeter with armed coverage and housing units with cells adjacent to exterior walls.\n\nLevel IV – Facilities have a secure perimeter with internal and external armed coverage and housing units or cell block housing with cells non-adjacent to exterior walls.\n\nAfter reviewing case factors and making a recommendation to a specific institution, the Classification Staff Representative (CSR) must approve “endorsement” to the institution. This process could take another 45-60 days. The inmate must then wait for a bus seat and an available bed at the endorsed institution.\n\nAll of this information is provided in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15 – Crime Prevention and Corrections.\n\nWhat are classification committees?\n\nEach determination affecting an incarcerated person’s placement within an institution/facility, transfer between facilities, program participation, work group, or custody designation is made by a classification committee. Equal access and effective communication is afforded in all committee hearings.\n\nUnit Classification Committee (UCC) – UCC is held for initial and subsequent program assignments/changes/transfers and composed of three members chaired by staff at the level of Facility Captain or Correctional Captain. Committee actions include:\n\nExplain facility expectations with incarcerated person.\n\nExplain job/program availability and review incarcerated person’s eligibility.\n\nPlace incarcerated person on job or academic/vocational waiting list as appropriate.\n\nEstablish work group.\n\nEstablish custody level.\n\nExplain appeal process and credit earning process, if eligible.\n\nAnswer incarcerated person’s questions.\n\nIncarcerated persons appear before a UCC at least annually to adjust the classification score and reevaluate his/her/their housing status.\n\nInstitutional Classification Committee (ICC) – This is the institution’s highest level of committee. It consists of a minimum of three members and is chaired at the level of Warden or Chief Deputy Warden. Events which require ICC review include: incarcerated person behavior resulting in Restricted Housing Unit; issues referred by lower committees; case by case reviews to determine eligibility for minimum facilities; review of Security Housing Unit term assessment and referral of cases for Departmental Review Board (DRB).\n\nWhat type of privileges is an incarcerated person entitled to while in reception?\n\nAn incarcerated person is in privilege group U until he/she/they have completed the reception and classification process. During this process, there are no family visits; one half of the maximum monthly canteen draw as authorized by the secretary; one telephone call within the first week and one per week thereafter; and no personal packages. The incarcerated person is informed of the specific privilege group and can give you this information. (California Code of Regulations, Article 3.5, Section 3044)\n\nPrivilege Group Criteria\n\nFour privilege groups have been established which provide a graduated system of incentives to promote a desire to achieve positive goals. Criteria for assignment to a specific privilege group shall be as follows:\n\nGroup A – full-time credit qualifying work/training program; diagnosed by a departmental physician or psychiatrist as totally disabled and incapable of performing a work/training assignment or partially disabled and assigned to a work/training program within the mental or physical capabilities of the partial disablement as determined by medical staff.\n\nGroup B – assignment to a half-time work/training program or involuntarily unassigned.\n\nGroup C – general population inmates who refuse to accept or perform in a work/training assignment.\n\nGroup D – inmates in special housing units who are not assigned to either a full-time or half-time work/training program (ASU, SHU, PSU)\n\nGroup U – reception center inmates under processing\n\nGroup Privileges and Restrictions\n\nWhat can an incarcerated person expect upon completion of the reception process?"
