Point Totals The first two games are to 5.\n\nThe third game, if necessary, is to 3.* Start of the Game The first game of the match (see “Point Totals”) begins according to Section 9.A. and the usual choice of end zone or possession. The initial choices are reversed at the start of the second game. If there is a tie-breaker game, then the teams fairly re-determine (according to Section 9.A) which team has the choice of end zone or possession.** Pull Each point starts with a pull, and teams switch ends of the field after each point, as normal, with the following exception.\n\nAny pull that touches the out-of-bounds area results in a brick. This includes all perimeter lines and includes any contact with those out-of-bounds areas even after the pull has hit the ground.\n\nThe brick is at mid-field.
