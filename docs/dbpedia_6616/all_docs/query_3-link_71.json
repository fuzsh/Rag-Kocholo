Candidates who wear corrective lenses must bring their glasses or contact lenses to the examination. Color vision will also be evaluated. The use of color deficiency corrective devices of any type is prohibited.\n\nHearing test- Candidates’ ability to hear a tone of varying decibels across a range of frequencies will be evaluated.
