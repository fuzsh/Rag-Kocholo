        "text": "We are grateful to the many corporate and individual gift donors for the financial support they bring to the SCORE Foundation. Those dollars allow SCORE to help entrepreneurs to start, operate and grow their small business, overcoming the challenges they face along the way.\n\nFor decades, SCORE has played an active role in fostering small businesses across the country through a volunteer network which today numbers 10,000 expert executives. They provide free advice and mentoring at the local level. In addition, national educational programs and tools are developed each year to help those founders take their company to the next level. The financial contributions drive the program creation and delivery – as well as the people that implement them – to reach both new and ongoing small business founders. Those companies bring the vibrancy and variety to the neighborhoods in which we choose to live and work. We need them.\n\nAs an entrepreneur and former small business owner throughout my career, I know the value of having trusted advisors just a phone call away. I invite you to join us in supporting America’s entrepreneurial spirit through your gift to the SCORE Foundation. And by patronizing those small businesses in your community.\n\nVP Public Policy, Bumble Inc.\n\nPayton Iheme is an accomplished public policy leader with over 20 years of experience in the field. She currently is the Head of Public Policy for North America and South America for Bumble Inc.
