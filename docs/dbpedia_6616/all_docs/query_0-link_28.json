        "text": "Top 100 ESG Companies\n\nWelcome to our new Top 100 ESG Companies ranking, identifying the corporations leading the way globally in the management of environmental, social, and governance factors.\n\nThe rapid growth of ESG investing over recent years has coincided with greater availability of nonfinancial corporate data; we now have access to more information on companies than ever before. However, markets need clearer ESG information to allocate finance efficiently to more sustainable outcomes\n\nESG Book is a global leader in sustainability data and technology, with an approach based on transparency, consistency, and accessibility. Offering a wide range of data-driven ESG solutions which are used by many of the world’s leading financial institutions, our platform provides access to almost 100,000 corporate disclosures. ESG Book’s solutions make sustainability data more widely available and comparable for all market stakeholders, enabling companies to be custodians of their own data, providing framework-neutral ESG information in real-time, and promoting transparency.\n\nTo comprise the Top 100 ESG Companies ranking, which will be updated online every month, ESG Book has examined each company on the platform with a market value of at least USD $10 billion, focusing on the largest global corporations.\n\nThere are three components to each company’s ranking:\n\nESG Score: measuring how well companies are managed on sustainability issues.\n\nTemperature Score: measuring companies’ climate impact.\n\nGHG emissions: the reported and estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of companies.\n\nThe result is a holistic view of the ESG and climate performance of the globe’s corporate ESG leaders."
