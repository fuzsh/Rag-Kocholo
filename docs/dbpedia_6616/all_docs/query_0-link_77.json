        "text": "The SAT is a prominent standardized test for high school students that most colleges consult as part of their admissions process. The SAT is scored on a scale of 400 to 1600 and a 1600 is considered the best possible result. A score of 1500 shows that you excelled on the exam and answered the majority of questions correctly.\n\nIs A 1500 SAT Score (95th Percentile) Good?\n\nA 1500 puts you in nearly the 95th percentile of all 1.7 million test takers. Just 100 points shy of a perfect score, a 1500 on the SAT makes you eligible to apply to every college and university in the country and be competitive for admission at almost every single one, including elite institutions. Since increasing eligibility and competitiveness for higher education institutions is the primary goal of taking the SAT, a 1500 is an extremely effective score.\n\nWhat Colleges Can I Get Into With An SAT Score of 1500?\n\nA score as high as 1500 makes you eligible to apply to every college and university in the nation, from small liberal arts colleges to large public universities. We’ve put together a sample list of schools to consider below. No SAT score guarantees admission, but all of these institutions have a history of accepting students with a 1500.\n\nShould I Retake the SAT With a 1500 Score?\n\nThere are very few reasons to retake the SAT except to become an even more competitive candidate at elite institutions. For instance, the SAT score of the most commonly accepted student hovers around 1540, which you’re shy of. If you’re a junior and you have your sights set on the most selective institutions out there, there’s no reason not to give it another go. Schedule the test 4 to 6 weeks out so you have time to study and take several practice tests. It’s not uncommon to have to take this standardized test multiple times to achieve a score of 1540, so don’t get discouraged!\n\nRetaking the SAT as a senior would likely be a difficult task, but, depending on where you are in the year, it’s not impossible. If there isn’t time in your schedule before the deadline for your dream college arrives, focus on the other components of your application. A 1500 SAT equates to stellar academic performance, so bring the rest of your application up to that same threshold.\n\nWith a score of 1500, the question is less about retaking the SAT and more about focusing on the type of college to attend. Pay a visit to your counselor to create a list of 7 to 10 colleges and universities that fit you, academically, socially, and regionally. Focus your efforts on maintaining or improving your GPA, fleshing out your extracurricular activities, and getting the other components of your college application together, such as your personal statement.\n\nThe personal essay is a chance to stand out from the pack of college applicants so set aside enough time to craft a piece that is meaningful and represents you. Ask for good recommendations from your more influential teachers, and don’t forget to double check all deadlines!\n\n1500 SAT to ACT Equivalent\n\nA 1500 SAT is equivalent to a 33 ACT.\n\nWhen it comes to taking the SAT versus the ACT, some states have requirements about which test you take to graduate, but you can also take whatever test will be better for your style of test-taking. Colleges and universities accept both and publicly say they have no preference for one over the other.\n\nWhen it comes to difficulty, neither test is really “harder” than the other, they’re just different. The ACT asks more advanced, complex math questions, but the SAT has a no-calculator math section, so, at the end of the day, that evens out. There are several other key differences, including the ACT’s not-science science section, the SAT requiring line citations in their Reading section, and their differing approaches to essays.\n\nThere is one very big difference, though: the ACT is more time-demanding, requiring test-takers to answer more questions that there are minutes on some occasions, whereas the SAT isn’t quite as demanding.\n\nScholarships for a 1500 SAT Score\n\nWith a 1500 SAT score, you should have no restrictions on applying for any merit-based scholarships. You might find a scholarship requiring a 1600 SAT, but those will be very few and very far between. Start applying for scholarships today so you can put together a little nest egg to help offset the cost of college tuition.\n\nView All Scholarships\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs 1500 a good SAT score?\n\nThe national average composite SAT score is 1059 — which puts a score of 1500 at quite an advantage. Good scores are ones that open up eligibility for admission at a vast number of colleges, and a 1500 certainly does that!\n\nWhat colleges can I get into with a 1500 SAT score?\n\nA 1500 SAT score is incredibly competitive and makes you eligible for admission into all colleges — even the most competitive ones, the Ivy Leagues. Included in the institutions you can apply to are the University of Chicago, Columbia University in the City of New York, and Duke University.\n\nWhat percentile is a 1500 SAT score?\n\nA 1500 SAT score puts you at the 95th percentile, meaning you scored higher than 95% of all other test takers.\n\nWhat is the ACT equivalent of a 1500 SAT score?\n\nA score of 1500 on the SAT is equivalent to a 33 ACT score.\n\nWhat scholarships can you get with a 1500 SAT score?\n\nWhen it comes applying for merit-based scholarships, you shouldn’t have any problem applying to scholarships with a 1500 SAT score. Apply for as many scholarships as possible!\n\nView All Scholarships\n\nThe University of California in Los Angeles, better known as UCLA, is one of 10 campuses in the UC system.
