The rewards/punishments show up, not only in earnings, but also in stock prices and make equity markets better aligned with consumer utility, which, in turn, causes an upward shift in demand curves. As a result, consumer spending increases and so does economic growth.”\n\nLess than two years ago, customer satisfaction in the United States was at its lowest point in 20 years. The decline began about a decade ago and was exacerbated by inflation, supply chain problems, and shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Since then, things have changed dramatically.\n\nCompanies with high ACSI scores typically do very well in the stock market. If one created a portfolio of the top 30-35 ACSI companies in their respective industries each quarter, weighted by customer satisfaction elasticity to customer retention, it would demonstrate something quite extraordinary."
