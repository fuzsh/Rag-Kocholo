We recommend a small number of charities that do an incredible amount of good.\n\nExplore our top charities\n\nPhoto credit to: Malaria Consortium/Sophie Garcia\n\nPhoto credit to: Malaria Consortium/Sophie Garcia\n\n1\n\nBacked by 50,000+ hours of research each year\n\nWe’ve been researching and funding charities since 2007. Our work aims to understand how charities work and how much they help the people they serve.\n\n2\n\nOnly the best, according to our high standards\n\nWe’ve reviewed hundreds of charities. Very few meet our high bar for funding.\n\n3\n\nGiveWell takes zero fees\n\nOur operations are funded by donors who choose to support us. 100% of all other donations (minus standard bank and credit card fees) will go to the fund or organization of your choice.\n\nThe gold standard for giving.\n\nAs seen in\n\n3 ways to donate.\n\nMost common\n\nTop Charities Fund\n\nHow will my donation be used?\n\nYour donation will be granted to one of our top charities. These are the most reliably high-impact and cost-effective charities we’ve identified. We’ve evaluated them extensively and have high confidence that donations to them will do a lot of good.\n\nIs there a downside?\n\nWe have a high bar for the evidence and scalability of these opportunities. This may limit the cost-effectiveness ceiling for these grants.\n\nBest for\n\nIf you want high confidence in the effectiveness of your donation, donate to the Top Charities Fund.\n\nAll Grants Fund\n\nHow will my donation be used?\n\nYour donation will be granted to the highest-impact programs across all our grantmaking in global health and well-being. Some programs may be much more cost-effective than our top charities, but we may also be much more uncertain about their impact.\n\nIs there a downside?\n\nIt’s riskier than our Top Charities Fund. For example, we may not have as much confidence in the evidence base or may not have the same extensive history working with the grantee.\n\nBest for\n\nIf you want the highest possible expected impact and are comfortable with higher risk, donate to the All Grants Fund.\n\nDirect to charities\n\nHow will my donation be used?\n\nYou can make a donation to any of our top charities through the GiveWell site, and your donation will be granted directly to that program.\n\nIs there a downside?\n\nYou may select a top charity that has lower-priority funding needs at the time of your donation. In contrast, donating to the Top Charities Fund ensures your gift will go to the highest-impact grant opportunities among any of our top charities.\n\nBest for\n\nIf you’d like to choose the specific charity that will receive your gift, any of our top charities are great options for making an impact.\n\nWe also offer an Unrestricted Fund, which includes donations at GiveWell’s discretion – including to our own overhead.\n\nPlease note that fungibility affects your gift to all donation options. Read more about this concept here.\n\nOur Research Process\n\nWe research each program extensively before funding it, and assess what the program accomplishes with that funding.\n\n1\n\nGather independent evidence\n\nWe look at independent studies, such as randomized controlled trials, of charity programs to understand if they achieve their goals. We also consult experts to gain practical and context-specific insights.\n\n2\n\nModel cost-effectiveness\n\nWe build in-depth models to analyze programs’ cost-effectiveness. We refine these throughout our evaluation process, based on budgets and monitoring data, to estimate impact per dollar spent.\n\n3\n\nConduct interviews and site visits\n\nWe conduct extensive interviews with staff from potential grantee organizations. We may visit them to see their work in action.\n\n4\n\nReview budgets\n\nWe review potential grantees' past spending and forecast their future spending to better understand their track record and expected impact.\n\n5\n\nAsk for program data\n\nWe ask organizations to share data so we can better understand how successful the programs have been.\n\n6\n\nFollow up on progress\n\nWe continually assess the work, progress, and future plans of the programs we fund. We will stop funding a program if we no longer believe it meets our criteria.\n\nMore than 125,000 donors have trusted GiveWell to direct their donations. Together, they have given over $2 billion to the organizations we recommend.\n\nThese donations will save over 200,000 lives."
