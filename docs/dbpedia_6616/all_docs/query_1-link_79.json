        "text": "The Family Health History and Health Appraisal questionnaires were used to collect information on child abuse and neglect, household challenges, and other socio-behavioral factors in the original CDC-Kaiser ACE Study. If you would like to receive copies of the questionnaires from the original CDC-Kaiser ACE Study, please email dvpinquiries@cdc.gov.\n\nThe questionnaires are not copyrighted, and there are no fees for their use. If you include the ACE Study questionnaires in your research, a copy of the subsequent article(s) is requested (send to dvpinquiries@cdc.gov).\n\nAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are categorized into three groups: abuse, neglect, and household challenges. Each category is further divided into multiple subcategories. Participant demographic information is available by gender, race, age, and education. The prevalence of ACEs is organized by category.\n\nACEs Definitions\n\nAll ACE questions refer to the respondent’s first 18 years of life.\n\nAbuse\n\nEmotional abuse: A parent, stepparent, or adult living in your home swore at you, insulted you, put you down, or acted in a way that made you afraid that you might be physically hurt.\n\nPhysical abuse: A parent, stepparent, or adult living in your home pushed, grabbed, slapped, threw something at you, or hit you so hard that you had marks or were injured.\n\nSexual abuse: An adult, relative, family friend, or stranger who was at least 5 years older than you ever touched or fondled your body in a sexual way, made you touch his/her body in a sexual way, attempted to have any type of sexual intercourse with you.\n\nHousehold Challenges\n\nMother treated violently: Your mother or stepmother was pushed, grabbed, slapped, had something thrown at her, kicked, bitten, hit with a fist, hit with something hard, repeatedly hit for over at least a few minutes, or ever threatened or hurt by a knife or gun by your father (or stepfather) or mother’s boyfriend.\n\nSubstance abuse in the household: A household member was a problem drinker or alcoholic or a household member used street drugs.\n\nMental illness in the household: A household member was depressed or mentally ill or a household member attempted suicide.\n\nParental separation or divorce: Your parents were ever separated or divorced.\n\nIncarcerated household member: A household member went to prison.\n\nNeglect1\n\nEmotional neglect: Someone in your family never or rarely helped you feel important or special, you never or rarely felt loved, people in your family never or rarely looked out for each other and felt close to each other, or your family was never or rarely a source of strength and support.2\n\nPhysical neglect: There was never or rarely someone to take care of you, protect you, or take you to the doctor if you needed it2, you didn’t have enough to eat, your parents were too drunk or too high to take care of you, or you had to wear dirty clothes.\n\n1Collected during Wave 2 only.\n\n2Items were reverse scored to reflect the framing of the question.\n\nParticipant Demographics\n\nDemographic information is from the entire ACE Study sample (n=17,337).\n\nParticipant Demographics\n\nDemographic Information for CDC-Kaiser ACE Study Participants, Waves 1 and 2.\n\nDemographic Information Percent (N = 17,337) Gender Female 54.0% Male 46.0% Race/Ethnicity White 74.8% Black 4.5% Asian/Pacific Islander 7.2% Other 2.3% Hispanic 11.2% Age (years) 19-29 5.3% 30-39 9.8% 40-49 18.6% 50-59 19.9% 60 and over 46.4% Education Not High School Graduate 7.2% High School Graduate 17.6% Some College 35.9% College Graduate or Higher 39.3%\n\nNote: Research papers that use Wave 1 and/or Wave 2 data may contain slightly different reports of participants’ demographic information.\n\nACEs Prevalence\n\nThe prevalence estimates reported below are from the entire ACE Study sample (n=17,337).\n\nACEs Prevalence\n\nPrevalence of ACEs by Category for CDC-Kaiser ACE Study Participants by Sex, Waves 1 and 2.\n\nACE Category Women Men Total Percent (N = 9,367) Percent (N = 7,970) Percent (N = 17,337) ABUSE Emotional Abuse 13.1% 7.6% 10.6% Physical Abuse 27% 29.9% 28.3% Sexual Abuse 24.7% 16% 20.7% HOUSEHOLD CHALLENGES Mother Treated Violently 13.7% 11.5% 12.7% Substance Abuse 29.5% 23.8% 26.9% Mental Illness 23.3% 14.8% 19.4% Parental Separation or Divorce 24.5% 21.8% 23.3% Incarcerated Household Member 5.2% 4.1% 4.7% NEGLECT Emotional Neglect3 16.7% 12.4% 14.8% Physical Neglect3 9.2% 10.7% 9.9%\n\nNote: 3Collected during Wave 2 only (N=8,629).

The ACE Study Survey Data [Unpublished Data]. Atlanta, Georgia: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2016.\n\nACEs are common across all populations. Almost two-thirds of study participants reported at least one ACE, and more than one in five reported three or more ACEs.\n\nSome populations are more vulnerable to experiencing ACEs because of the social and economic conditions in which they live, learn, work and play.\n\nThe ACE score is the total sum of the different categories of ACEs reported by participants. Study findings show a graded dose-response relationship between ACEs and negative health and well-being outcomes. In other words, as the number of ACEs increases so does the risk for negative outcomes. For an exhaustive list of outcomes see selected journal publications."
