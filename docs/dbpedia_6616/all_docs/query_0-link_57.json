        "text": "Superscoring\n\nMany in college admission talk about reading applications holistically and supportively; one way they can do this is by “superscoring” standardized tests. This means that if you take the SAT more than once, the admission office will take the highest section score across test administrations and assign you a new, higher total score.\n\nFor the ACT, this process generally takes the form of taking your highest test scores across test administrations, but may not result in a new Composite score because colleges use test scores individually. ACT has introduced its Superscoring report as of April 2021 as a convenient way for students to send their best scores. See our complete guide to the report.\n\nIn practice, this means that it’s almost always advisable to plan to take the test more than once. Multiple sittings mean multiple opportunities to maximize each section score, which can increase your superscore. You can take the test a second or third time knowing that if you have a worse day in Math but a great day in Reading and Writing, the lower math score won’t be held against you. You can still get the benefit of that great Reading and Writing score.\n\nStudents in the class of 2025 are in the unique position of potentially having scores from both the old paper version of the test and the new digital adaptive version. The vast majority of schools that have stated a superscoring policy across paper and digital tests have said that they will superscore. This includes Amherst, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Georgia Tech, Harvard, Northwestern, Notre Dame, University of Chicago, University of Florida system, University of Georgia, University of Michigan, University of Mississippi, UPenn, and Vanderbilt.\n\nOnly Princeton has said that they will not superscore between the paper and digital test. But they will superscore digital tests.\n\nScore Choice\n\nThe College Board and ACT have adopted policies, generally referred to as “Score Choice,” designed to give students some control over how SAT and ACT scores are reported. Colleges, however, have the final say over what scores applicants should submit and how those scores will be used. Many of the schools listed have temporary test optional policies that may change in 2025. Students should carefully review the score-reporting policy of each college to which they plan to apply.\n\nRequire all scores: These colleges explicitly require applicants to submit all test scores.\n\nRecommend all scores: These colleges recommend but do not require that applicants send all test scores. These schools’ admission offices will create superscores for applicants, and counselors do not want students to inadvertently neglect to send a high section score.\n\nAccept score choice: These colleges will accept whichever scores an applicant elects to submit.\n\nIn the table below, you will find the superscore and score choice policies of many popular colleges. We are working to build out this database to include the 400+ popular colleges whose ACT and SAT score ranges and testing policies we also track (excluding those with Test Free policies). We also track score ranges and policies for merit scholarships here.\n\n* Weak Superscoring: These school fall somewhere between “highest composite” and true superscoring. For instance, University of Illinois—Urbana-Champaign’s policy states, “If you took either test more than once, we’ll use your highest sub-scores in our evaluation. However, we don’t use your highest sub-scores from different test sittings to create a super-score.” We find this to be almost a distinction without a difference, especially since some colleges do the same thing behind the scenes but label it “superscoring.”"
