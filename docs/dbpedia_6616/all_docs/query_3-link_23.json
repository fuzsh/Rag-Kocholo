        "text": "Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) has been the state’s testing program since 1988, and it includes TCAP assessments in math, English language arts, social studies, and science, as well as alternative assessments, like MSAA and TCAP-Alt, for students with special needs.\n\nThe following are assessments offered in Tennessee.\n\nRequired\n\nOverview:\n\nEach subject-area test is divided into multiple subparts and will be administered during one testing window at the end of the school year.\n\nEnglish language arts (4 subparts) will assess the Tennessee Academic Standards through literary and informational texts requiring students to demonstrate the ability to read closely, analyze text, answer text-dependent questions, provide a written response to a prompt, and demonstrate command of the English language.\n\nMathematics (3 subparts) will consist of both calculator permitted and calculator prohibited subparts. It assesses the Tennessee Academic Standards requiring students to demonstrate a deep conceptual understanding of mathematics, number sense, fluency, problem solving and an understanding of the grade-level horizontal coherence embedded within the standards. The mathematics test will focus approximately 70 percent of the assessment items on major work of the grade and approximately 30 percent of the items on supporting work.\n\nScience (1 subpart in grades 3-8) will assess the current Tennessee Academic Standards requiring students to demonstrate a deep conceptual understanding of scientific concepts in Life Science, Earth and Space Science and Physical Science. Please note science will be a field test in the 2018-19 school year. There are no score reports available for individual students.\n\nSocial studies (2 subparts in grades 6-8) will assess the current Tennessee Academic Standards for social studies requiring students to demonstrate historical awareness, geographical understanding and the ability to analyze primary source documents.\n\nRequired:\n\nYes\n\nFederal and State Law:\n\nAdministered in accordance with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015 and T.C.A. § 49-1-602 pertaining to district and school accountability. Modified assessments in Braille and large print are also provided in accordance with the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1990.\n\nPurpose & Use:\n\nThe TCAP tests are designed to assess true student understanding and not just basic memorization and test-taking skills. TCAP measures student understanding of our state standards.\n\nAdministration Window:\n\nDistricts may select a more specific testing window within the state’s testing window of April 13 through May 8. However, ELA subpart 1, which includes a written response, must be administered in the first week of the administration window.\n\nLength of Assessment\n\nFor information on the length of each assessment, please see the Testing Times by Grade/Subject page.\n\nResults to Districts:\n\nRaw data is provided to districts at the very end of school year. This information may be used to help calculate final grades for report cards. State law requires TCAP scores be included as a percentage of a student’s grade in grades 3–8. Districts do have the flexibility, as provided in state law, to exclude TCAP data from student grades if the data is not available at least five instructional days before the last day for students.\n\nResults to Parents & Students:\n\nScore reports from the 2018-19 school year for grades 3-8 will be provided to districts in summer 2019 to distribute to parents.\n\nOverview:\n\nEach subject-area test is divided into multiple subparts and will be administered during one testing window at the end of the course.\n\nEnglish I and English II (4 subparts) assess the Tennessee Academic Standards through literary and informational texts requiring students to demonstrate the ability to read closely, analyze text, answer text-dependent questions, provide a written response to a prompt, and demonstrate command of the English language.\n\nAlgebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, Integrated Math I, Integrated Math II and Integrated Math III (3 subparts) will consist of both calculator permitted and calculator prohibited subparts.

This is now a graduation requirement for student seeking a regular or honors diploma. Districts in Tennessee contract with ACT to provide an opportunity to take the ACT at their own school during the school day at no cost to the student.\n\nRequired:\n\nYes\n\nFederal and State Law:\n\nAdministered in accordance with T.C.A § 49-6-6001(b).\n\nPurpose & Use:\n\nOur vision for student success in Tennessee is that all students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to successfully embark on their chosen path in life. Empowering our students to pursue the education and training that matches their chosen career pathway is essential to this vision. In order to prepare our students with the knowledge and skills valued by both employers and postsecondary educators, the department has set two major strategic goals:\n\nBy 2020, the average composite score on the ACT (or equivalent on the SAT) will be a 21.\n\nBy 2020, the majority of high school graduates will be on track to receive a postsecondary degree or credential.\n\nAdministration Window:\n\nACT state testing dates\n\nPaper testing: March 17, March 31, and April 21, 2020\n\nAccommodations (paper): March 17-20, March 23-27, 2020\n\nOnline window: March 20-29, 2018 (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday only)\n\nSAT\n\nStudents may register to take the SAT on the following dates:: August 26, October 7, November 4, and December 2.\n\nDates in 2018 include: March 10, May 5, and June 2.\n\nLength of Assessment:\n\nACT:\n\nEnglish: 45 minutes\n\nMath: 60 minutes\n\nReading: 35 minutes\n\nScience: 35 minutes\n\nSAT:\n\n25-minute essay\n\nSix 25-minute sections (mathematics, critical reading and writing)\n\nTwo 20-minute sections (mathematics, critical reading and writing)\n\n10-minute multiple choice writing section\n\nResults to Districts:\n\nDistrict receive ACT results 2-3 months after state testing is complete.\n\nResults to Parents & Students:\n\nACT results are delivered to parents and students 3-8 weeks after the assessment. SAT results are delivered to parents and students\n\nOverview:\n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know and can do in various subject areas. Assessments are conducted periodically in mathematics, reading, science, writing, the arts, civics, economics, geography, U.S. history, and in Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL). In 2017, NAEP began administering digitally based assessments (DBA) for mathematics, reading, and writing, with additional subjects to be added in 2018 and 2019. Only a small sample of Tennessee fourth, eighth, and twelfth graders will take this test. The representative sample group is chosen by NAEP each year. NAEP alternates sample sizes every other year, with even-year assessments being a national sample, and odd-year assessments being state samples.\n\nRequired:\n\nYes, NAEP is required for grade 4, 8 and 12 students at selected schools.\n\nFederal and State Law:\n\nAdministered in accordance with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015, which requires the state to participate in the biennial state academic assessments of fourth and eighth grade reading and mathematics. Districts that receive Title I funds are required to participate.\n\nPurpose & Use:\n\nNAEP assessments are administered uniformly using the same sets of test booklets across the nation. NAEP results serve as a common metric for all states and selected urban districts. The assessment stays essentially the same from year to year, with only carefully documented changes. This permits NAEP to provide a clear picture of student academic progress over time. In even-numbered years, NAEP measures Tennessee student’s academic achievement against students in other states also taking this test.\n\nAdministration Window:\n\nJanuary 29-March 9, 2018\n\nLength of Assessment:\n\n60–90 minutes\n\nResults to Districts:\n\nDistrict-level results are not provided.\n\nResults to Parents & Students:\n\nStudent-level results are not provided.\n\nOptional\n\nOverview:\n\nThe Grade 2 optional assessment measures student mastery of the Tennessee Academic Standards in English Language Arts and mathematics.\n\nThe English language arts (ELA) assessment uses an integrated format to measure student progress through literary and informational texts requiring students to demonstrate the ability to read closely, analyze text, answer text-dependent questions, provide a written response to a prompt, and demonstrate command of the English language. Additionally, it measures fluency, comprehension, and listening skills.\n\nThe mathematics assessment will focus approximately 70 percent of the assessment items on major work of the grade and approximately 30 percent of the items on supporting and additional work. Student mastery of math fluency, ability to problem solve, and understanding of the grade-level standards will be assessed. Further, students will be assessed on their ability to connect topics across the grade-level domains.\n\nRequired:\n\nNo\n\nFederal and State Law:\n\nNot applicable; participation is voluntary\n\nPurpose & Use:\n\nThis test is given to help measure how much a second grade student grows academically over the course of a school year.\n\nAdministration Window:\n\nApril 13–May 8\n\nResults to Parents & Students:\n\nScore reports from 2018-19 school year for Grade 2 will be provided to districts in summer 2019 to distribute to parents.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe TCAP Grade 2 Alternate assessment is the English language arts and math assessment for students in grade 2 with the most significant cognitive disabilities. The grade 2 Alternate assessment is administered via paper by the teacher.\n\nRequired:\n\nNo, however if a district opts to administer the TCAP grade 2 Alternate Assessment, they must also administer the grade 2 Alternate Assessment to eligible students.\n\nFederal and State Law:\n\nThe development of alternate achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities is authorized under a department regulation (34 C.F.R. Part 200) published on December 9, 2003, and T.C.A § 49-1-612. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title I require inclusion of all students with disabilities in the state assessment system.\n\nPurpose & Use:\n\nThis test is given to help measure how much a student grows academically over the course of a school year.\n\nAdministration Window:\n\nMarch 16–May 8\n\nLength of Assessment:\n\nStudents are given the assessment during class time throughout the window based on student needs and class schedules.\n\nResults to Districts:\n\nDistricts receive individual performance reports which detail student performance in early summer.\n\nResults to Parents & Students:\n\nDistricts can choose how and when to share these reports with parents.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is a study of classrooms across the country and around the world.

PISA also includes measures of general or cross-curricular competencies, such as collaborative problem solving. By design, PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of compulsory schooling.\n\nAdministration Window:\n\nThis assessment will not be administered in TN in the 2019-20 school year.\n\nLength of Assessment:\n\n2 hours\n\nResults to Districts:\n\nDistrict-level results are not provided.\n\nResults to Parents & Students:\n\nStudent-level results are not provided.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe International Early Learning and Child Well-being Study is designed to help countries to improve children’s early learning experiences, to better support their development and overall well-being. Literacy, numeracy, executive function, and social skills are assessed among kindergarteners.\n\nRequired:\n\nNo\n\nFederal and State Law:\n\nNot applicable; participation is voluntary.\n\nPurpose & Use:\n\nThe purpose of the Study is to provide countries with a common language and framework, encompassing a collection of robust empirical information and in-depth insights on children’s learning development at a critical age. With this information, countries will be able to share best-practices, working towards the ultimate goal of improving children’s early learning outcomes and overall well-being.\n\nResults to Districts:\n\nDistrict-level results are not provided.\n\nResults to Parents & Students:\n\nStudent-level results are not provided.\n\nInnovative Assessment Supports\n\nOperational Testing vs. Field Testing\n\nThe majority of tests are operational. This means that the test is officially scored, and results will be shared with districts, schools, teachers, and students. Some tests, however, are field tests. This means that the test isn't officially scored and reported; rather, it provides valuable information to the department of education in order to inform future test development.\n\nSometimes students take stand-alone field tests where the entire test would not be officially scored and reported but would instead be used to help the department design future tests. In most cases, field test questions are included within operational tests. In this scenario, a student would not know which question was a field test question and which questions was an operational test question. Student responses to the field test questions would not \"count\" toward a student's score on the test, but their responses would help the department of education design future test questions. Field tests strengthen future operational tests by ensuring each question measures what our students should know and can do."
