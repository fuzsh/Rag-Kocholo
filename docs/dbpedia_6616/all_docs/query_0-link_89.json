Changes made to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) in 2005 necessitated revisions to the original HEI. At that time, the HEI was significantly updated through a collaboration between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the USDA. The HEI was updated every five years to assess alignment with the new DGA. In 2020, the first HEI for toddlers was introduced based on the dietary pattern for the second year of life (i.e. age 12 through 23 months) in the 2020-2025 DGA.\n\nThis webpage details information about versions of the HEI from 2005 to present. For each iteration of the HEI, all of the key Dietary Guidelines food choice recommendations that relate to diet quality are reflected in that index's components. Refer to the webpage comparing versions for more information on the similarities and differences between each version of the index.\n\nHEI-Toddlers-2020\n\nHEI-Toddlers-2020 Components & Scoring Standards\n\n1: Intakes between the minimum and maximum standards are scored proportionately.

Online ahead of print.\n\nHEI-Toddlers-2020 Overview\n\nThe HEI-Toddlers-2020, like HEI-2020, has 13 components reflecting all constituents of complementary foods and beverages consumed by toddlers, with the exception of human milk, infant formula, or other nutritional formulas such as toddler milks or follow-on formula. Healthy dietary patterns for toddlers have unique considerations reflected in the scoring standards for Added Sugars and Saturated Fats. Toddlers have lower caloric intake relative to high nutrient needs, and added sugars should be avoided. Another distinctive difference is that there is no recommendation to limit saturated fats to less than 10 percent of energy intake in this age group, however, saturated fats cannot be unlimited without displacing the energy available to achieve other food group and subgroup goals.\n\nHEI-2020 & HEI-2015\n\nHEI-2020 & HEIâ€“2015 Components & Scoring Standards\n\n1: The HEI-2020 components and scoring standards are the same as the HEI-2015.

For the first time, the components and standards did not change between the HEI-2015 and HEI-2020 for the following reasons: the USDA Dietary Patterns remained virtually the same in the 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 DGA; there were no major changes in the key recommendations for children and adults ages 2 and older; and the state of the U.S. diet did not change significantly since 2015. Even though no changes were made, the index was renamed to clarify that it aligned with most current guidance (i.e., the HEI-2020 for the 2020-2025 DGA).\n\nHEI-2015\n\nThe HEI-2015 was designed to align with the 2015-2020 DGA. As with the previous DGA, the 2015-2020 edition emphasizes a variety of food groups, nutrient density, and improving food and beverage choices within calorie needs.\n\nA new aspect of the DGA introduced in 2015 is a specific recommendation on limiting intake of added sugars to less than 10% of total caloric intake.\n\nAs with the previous HEI versions, staff at the NCI and the USDA collaborated to revise the HEI to align with the recommendations in the 2015 DGA. Most of the HEI-2010 components were retained in HEI-2015; however, the \"Empty Calories\" component has been replaced by two separate components, \"Added Sugars\" and \"Saturated Fats,\" to better align with the newly quantified added sugars recommendation while still retaining the concept that these components encompass remaining calories in the diet.\n\nPreviously, excessive calories from alcohol were included in the Empty Calories component. With the changes regarding the Empty Calories component, alcohol is no longer specifically addressed within a single component. However, overall calories contributed from alcohol in the diet continue to be included in the total energy used as the denominator to calculate HEI-2015 scores.\n\nWhile the other dietary components remained the same with the HEI-2015 revision, a change was made to the method by which legumes are allocated to the components. In HEI-2015, legumes are now being allocated to four components: Total Protein Foods, Seafood and Plant Proteins, Total Vegetables, and Greens and Beans. Because legumes are consumed infrequently by many in the population, this change is expected to have little impact on total scores at the population level. However, for some subgroups, such as vegetarians, individual scores may improve substantially.\n\nAfter revisions, the HEI-2015 contains 13 components that sum to a total maximum score of 100 points. The total score is the sum of the score of adequacy components (i.e. foods to eat more of for good health) and moderation components (i.e. foods to limit for good health).\n\nAs in HEI-2005 and HEI-2010, each of the components is scored on a density basis out of 1,000 calories, with the exception of Fatty Acids, which is a ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. The details of the scoring standards of the HEI-2015 are shown in the accompanying table.\n\nHEI-2010\n\nHEI-2005"
