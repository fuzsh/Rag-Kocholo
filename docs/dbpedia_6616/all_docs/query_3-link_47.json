        "text": "A weight is a health value that you assign to each member of the HA group (that is, a pool, trunk, and/or VIPRION® cluster). The weight that you assign to each HA group member must be in the range of 10 through 100.\n\nThe maximum overall weight that the BIG-IP system can potentially calculate is the sum of the individual weights for the HA group members, plus the active bonus value. There is no limit to the sum of the member weights for the HA group as a whole.\n\nFor each member of an HA group, you can specify a setting known as a minimum threshold. A minimum threshold is a value that specifies the number of object members that must be available to prevent failover. The system factors in a threshold value when it calculates the overall score for the traffic group or device.\n\nThe way that the BIG-IP system calculates the score depends on the number of object members that are actually available as compared to the configured minimum threshold value:\n\nIf the number of available object members is less than the threshold, the BIG-IP system assigns a score of 0 to the HA group member so that the score of that HA group member no longer contributes to the overall score.\n\nFor example, if a trunk in the HA group has four trunk members and you specify a minimum threshold value of 3, and the number of available trunk members falls to 2, then the trunk contributes a score of 0 to the total score for the traffic group or device.\n\nIf the number of available object members equals or exceeds the minimum threshold value, or you do not specify a minimum threshold, the BIG-IP system calculates the score as described previously, by multiplying the percentage of available object members by the weight for each HA group member and then adding the scores to determine the overall score for the traffic group or device.\n\nThe minimum threshold that you define for pools can be less than or equal to the number of members in the pool. For clusters, the threshold can be less than or equal to the number of possible blades in the chassis, and for trunks, the minimum threshold can be less than or equal to the number of possible members in a trunk for that platform.\n\nTip: Do not configure the tmsh attribute min-up-members on any pool that you intend to include in the HA group.\n\nWhen you've configured the BIG-IP® system to use HA scores to pick the next-active device for a traffic group, the traffic group will fail over whenever another device has a higher score for that same traffic group. This means that an active traffic group could potentially fail over frequently because it will fail over even when its HA group's minimum threshold value is still met.\n\nTo mitigate this problem, you can define a sufficient threshold value. The sufficient threshold value specifies the amount of available resource (of a trunk, pool, or cluster) that is considered good enough to prevent the traffic group from failing over when another device has a higher score.\n\nThe default value for the Sufficient Threshold setting is All, which means that the system considers the amount of available resource to be sufficent when all of its component members are available. For example, if a trunk has a total of four links, and you specify the default sufficient threshold value, then all of the trunk links must be up to prevent failover when another device has a higher HA score. If you specify a sufficient threshold of 3, then only three of the four trunk links must be up to prevent failover when another device has a higher HA score.\n\nAn active bonus is an amount that the BIG-IP system automatically adds to the overall HA score of an active traffic group or device. An active bonus ensures that the traffic group or device remains active when its score would otherwise temporarily fall below the score of the standby traffic group on another device. The active bonus that you configure can be in the range of 0 to 100.\n\nA common reason to specify an active bonus is to prevent failover due to flapping, the condition where failover occurs frequently as a trunk member switches rapidly between availability and unavailability. In this case, you might want to prevent the HA scoring feature from triggering failover each time a trunk member is lost. You might also want to prevent the HA scoring feature from triggering failover when you make minor changes to the BIG-IP system configuration, such as adding or removing a trunk member.\n\nFor example, suppose that the HA group for a traffic group on each device contains a trunk with four members, and you assign a weight of 30 to each trunk. Without an active bonus defined, if the trunk on one device loses some number of members, failover occurs because the overall calculated score for that traffic group becomes lower than that of a peer device. You can prevent this failover from occurring by specifying an active bonus value.\n\nThe BIG-IP system uses an active bonus to contribute to the HA score of an active traffic group only; the BIG-IP system never uses an active bonus to contribute to the score of a standby traffic group.\n\nNote: An exception to this behavior is when the active traffic group score is 0. In this case, the system does not add the active bonus to the active traffic group or active device score.\n\nTo decide on an active bonus value, calculate the trunk score for some number of failed members (such as one of four members), and then specify an active bonus that results in a trunk score that is greater than the weight that you assigned to the trunk.\n\nFor example, if you assigned a weight of 30 to the trunk, and one of the four trunk members fails, the trunk score becomes 23 (75% of 30), putting the traffic group at risk for failover. However, if you specified an active bonus of 8 or higher, failover would not actually occur, because a score of 8 or higher, when added to the score of 23, is greater than 30."
