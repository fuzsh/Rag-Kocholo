        "text": "How long does it take to get a kidney transplant?\n\nOnce you are on the transplant waiting list, you may get called for a deceased donor kidney fairly quickly, or you may wait many years. In general, the average time is 3-5 years at most centers, but it can be longer in some parts of the country. You can talk to your transplant team about their list and how your specific situation will affect your wait time. Waiting times depend on several things, such as:\n\nHow long you have been on dialysis or on the transplant waitlist\n\nThe longer you wait, the higher you will be on the list for a kidney that matches you. Many people don’t know that the time you’ve spent on dialysis is also factored into how long you’ll wait for a kidney: the longer you are on dialysis, the higher up you’ll be on the list.\n\nBlood type\n\nSome blood types are more or less common. If you have a rare blood type that is hard to match, it can take longer to get matched with a deceased donor kidney.\n\nWhere you live\n\nThe geographical distance between where the donor is and where you live matters. Some parts of the country have more donors (shorter wait times). Other areas have more people on the waitlist (longer wait times).\n\nYour antibody levels\n\nMore antibodies make it more likely that your body’s immune system will attack the new kidney. If you’ve been pregnant before, have had blood transfusions, or have already had a transplant, chances are you have a high antibody level.\n\nYou can be on the waitlist at more than one transplant center to increase your chances of getting a kidney more quickly. This is called multi-listing. Most transplant centers will allow you to transfer your lab work and imaging, like x-rays and CT scans from another center, but you’ll still have to meet with the new transplant center’s team for an in-person evaluation. Another way to get a transplant sooner is to have a living donor kidney transplant. You won’t have to wait years for a kidney and you can schedule your surgery when it’s a good time for you and your donor. You can get a better understanding of what your wait time might be at different centers by sharing specific information about yourself with this helpful tool."
