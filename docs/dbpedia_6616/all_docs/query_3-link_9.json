        "text": "You’ve got enough to worry about, so let us make choosing between the ACT and SAT easier! Our detailed comparison and FAQ below will help you make the best decision as you prepare to complete college applications, compete for scholarship opportunities, and plan your career ahead.\n\nSome students choose to take both the ACT and SAT – while others find they are more comfortable with one test or the other based on their learning styles and preferences. Either way you choose, know that colleges and universities have no specific test preference.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are the two most widely recognized standardized tests used in the college admissions process in the United States. The ACT is an assessment that tests students on their understanding of their high school curriculum and covers coursework in English, reading, math, and science. The SAT, on the other hand, has traditionally been considered more of an aptitude test that includes only English, reading, and math; it does not have a science section.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between the ACT and SAT?\n\nWhile the ACT and SAT may seem similar at first glance, there are key distinctions that set them apart. Both tests evaluate your skills in reading, writing, and math. However, the ACT goes a step further by offering an optional essay component that can highlight your writing skills to provide a more well-rounded assessment of your academic abilities. Additionally, the ACT also includes a science section, making it a go-to choice for those interested in STEM fields.\n\nThe ACT’s emphasis on practical language skills, as opposed to memorizing a long list of complex vocabulary, can make it more relevant for many students. The ACT evaluates your ability to understand language in context, which many students find to be a more natural skill. Another significant difference is that the ACT offers support for English learners on every national test date, adding another layer of accessibility.\n\nAdditionally, the ACT's scoring system is designed to give you detailed insights into your strengths and weaknesses. This information can help you choose the right classes during your high school career and can add focus to your studying if you decide to retake the ACT to improve your scores.\n\nWhich Test Is Easier, the ACT or SAT?\n\nThat’s the question we always get. We know you’re smart enough to succeed on either! Questions on the ACT and SAT have very similar levels of average difficulty – so it really comes down to student preference. Check out our free practice test to get a sense of our test format to help you determine your best test fit.\n\nShould You Take the ACT or SAT?\n\nSome reasons a student might consider the ACT over the SAT:\n\nThe ACT gives each student that takes the ACT more than once the chance at an ACT Superscore, which takes the average of the four best subject scores from each ACT test attempt — and counts it as your official score.\n\nYou should consider what test center availability is like in your area – you may find there is more availability to take the ACT test! [Find a Test Center]\n\nStudents can choose how they take the ACT – either on paper or online. The SAT is now only offered online. Some students like paper and pencil, others like the computer. With the ACT, you decide which test format is best for you.\n\nThe ACT is the only standardized test to offer a test answer key (TIR) for certain test dates. This means you can choose to get your answer key back with your test and see the questions you missed and which you got right. This is an excellent study tool especially for those students who know they want to take the test multiple times to superscore.\n\nStudents who take the ACT will complete a science section which allows them to receive a STEM score. This is a strong benefit for any students looking to pursue STEM majors or STEM careers. The U.S. will need to fill millions of STEM jobs in the upcoming years; show your college of choice that you’re serious about your STEM future!\n\nThe ACT has an optional writing section which allows students to showcase their writing skills to colleges and universities. With AI technology changing the digital and writing landscape, it’s important that students can show colleges they have what it takes to write papers, compose essays, and utilize their communication skills in the classroom and beyond.\n\nACT is known for its commitment to equity and diversity. This expands to our test too! We offer accommodations for all types of diverse learners. One example of this is our English learner supports for U.S. students not proficient in English on all national test days.\n\nThe ACT is predictive! Students meeting three or four ACT College Readiness Benchmarks have a strong likelihood of experiencing success in first-year college courses."
