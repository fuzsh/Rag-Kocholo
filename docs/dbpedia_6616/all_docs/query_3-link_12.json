        "text": "How is the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade different from the Leapfrog Hospital Survey?\n\nThe Leapfrog Hospital Survey is an annual voluntary survey in which Leapfrog asks hospitals to report quality and safety data and then publicly reports that information by hospital. The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade is a letter grade Leapfrog bi-annually assigns to all general hospitals in the United States, whether they report to the Survey or not. If a hospital does not report to the Survey, the Safety Grade uses publicly available data from numerous secondary sources. The majority of data used to calculate the Safety Grade comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe infographic at right and the guide below are meant to help you understand the differences between the two, the timeline for each, and who to contact if you have any questions.\n\nScroll down or click the links below to learn more.\n\nI. What is the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade?\n\nII. What is the Leapfrog Hospital Survey?\n\nWhat is the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade?\n\nWeb address: www.hospitalsafetygrade.org\n\nWhat it is: The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade is a composite score made up of up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety, including CMS Medicare PSI 90 Patient Safety and Adverse Events composite which includes 10 component measures, The Leapfrog Group calculated a numerical score for all eligible hospitals in the U.S. These national performance measures of patient safety indicate how well hospitals protect patients from preventable errors, injuries and infections. Grades are assigned to U.S. general hospitals twice annually, using a scoring algorithm to determine each hospital’s score as an A, B, C, D, or F letter grade.\n\nHow many hospitals? Nearly 3,000 general hospitals are assigned a grade twice per year.\n\nWhat kind of hospitals are included/eligible? Any general, acute-care hospital in the U.S. for which there is enough publicly available data. Submission of a Leapfrog Hospital Survey is strongly encouraged but not required to receive a Grade, as long as the hospital has enough data available from other sources. Because of limitations and exclusions in publicly available data, the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade does not assess hospitals such as:\n\ncritical access hospitals\n\nspecialty hospitals such as children’s hospitals or cancer hospitals\n\nhospitals in U.S. Territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam\n\nWhat does it measure? The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade looks at publicly available measures of safety – inpatient injuries, infections, and medical and medication errors.\n\nOutcome Measures include, among other measures:\n\ninfections, including: central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, surgical site infections for colon surgery, MRSA and C. diff.\n\nfalls and trauma, very severe pressure ulcers\n\npreventable complications from surgery such as foreign objects retained in the body and accidental punctures or lacerations\n\nProcess/Structural Measures include, among other measures:\n\nstrong nursing leadership and engagement\n\ncomputerized physician order entry systems to prevent medication errors\n\nsafe medication administration\n\nhand hygiene policies\n\nthe right staffing for the ICU\n\nThe Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade does NOT measure:\n\nIssues commonly considered quality measures, such as death rates for certain procedures\n\nMeasures of hospital quality, such as ratings by specialty or procedure\n\nReadmission rates\n\nWhere does the data come from? The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade primarily consists of measures collected and publicly reported by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and also includes some measures from the Leapfrog Hospital Survey for hospitals that report to Leapfrog. Beginning with the spring 2021 Safety Grade, the Leapfrog Group will use an expert-developed New Link to calculate scores for three measures: Computerized Prescriber Order Entry (CPOE), Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA), and/or ICU Physician Staffing (IPS).\n\nHow is the data assessed? The scoring algorithm was developed by an Expert Panel of patient safety experts from across the country. The panel carefully considered the evidence base and opportunity for impact behind each of the measures, and weight the importance of each of the measures based in part on the strength of that evidence. The Panel regularly reconvenes to reevaluate the merits of each measure. Leapfrog’s transparent methodology involves computing data for these measures through a scoring algorithm and then assigning each hospital an A, B, C, D, or F letter grade.\n\nIs it true that hospitals can “game” the Hospital Safety Grade, as reported in Medical Care? While it’s theoretically possible to “game” any ratings system, we find that hospitals attempting this with the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade are generally frustrated by the result for two reasons. First, the grade is composed of more than 30 measures, meaning that there are thousands of potential statistical outcomes that cannot be predicted with certainty. Second, the grade is calculated on a curve, so even by using data from one point in time, hospitals cannot know how they will compare until the full range of hospitals are scored.\n\nHow long has Leapfrog been doing this? Since 2012\n\nHow often are results made available? The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade is issued twice a year, in the fall and spring. Results are publicly available and presented in an easy-to-use format for consumers and other interested parties.\n\nHow do I communicate with patients who have questions about our grade? Health care consumers are increasingly becoming concerned with the quality and safety of care they receive at hospitals and are using this information to make a decision on where to seek care. To help patients interpret your Safety Grade, refer them to the detailed information on the measures that make up your grade. The colored gas gauge images show areas where your hospital has demonstrated strong performance and where there is room for improvement. For areas in which your hospital scores poorly, assure your patients that you recognize this is an area of concern and illustrate what steps you are actively taking to improve the safety of care you provide. No hospital is perfectly safe, so even if your hospital has received an A Safety Grade, it is likely that there are still some areas where you score poorly. If your hospital has received a low grade and scores below average on many measures, explain to your patients how your hospital leadership has recognized these shortcomings and hopefully is instituting a facility-wide commitment to improving safety. Finally, you can also encourage patients who have additional questions to contact Leapfrog directly at info@leapfroggroup.org.\n\nWhere can I find more information? You can find more information and the full methodology at www.HospitalSafetyGrade.org.\n\nWho can I contact for help with this? For the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade, please contact HelpDesk@Leapfrog-Group.org.\n\nHow can my hospital promote our \"A\" grade? Hospitals that are interested in promoting their \"A\" or \"Straight A's\" Safety Grade are encouraged to issue a press release about their achievement.\n\nFor hospitals interested in using their Safety Grade in paid advertising or other promotional and marketing materials, a licensure agreement is required. Please visit our licensure agent's website, www.leapfroglicensing.org.\n\nFor more information about the timeline for hospitals, click here.\n\nWhat is the Leapfrog Hospital Survey?\n\nWeb address: www.LeapfrogGroup.org/Hospital\n\nWhat it is: The Leapfrog Hospital Survey is a voluntary, annual patient safety and quality survey that is free to all hospitals in the U.S. It was created to encourage hospitals to publicly report their progress in meeting quality and safety objectives, and it focuses on hospital structures, processes of care and outcomes.\n\nHow many hospitals are included? Over 2,300 hospitals voluntarily report to the Leapfrog Hospital Survey.\n\nWhat kind of hospitals are eligible? All hospitals are eligible and encouraged to submit data.\n\nWhat does it measure? The Survey includes a variety of nationally standardized and endorsed measures pertaining to the safety and quality of inpatient care, including maternity care, high-risk surgical procedures, Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) system implementation, ICU physician staffing, and more.\n\nWhere does the data come from? Hospitals provide all data for the Leapfrog Hospital Survey directly.\n\nHow is the data assessed? All measures on the Leapfrog Hospital Survey are reviewed and approved by a voluntary panel of experts in that subject area. Where possible, measures are harmonized with other reporting entities such as the Joint Commission or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to minimize the reporting burden on hospitals. The Leapfrog Hospital Survey does not have an overall composite score; each measure included on the survey is scored individually.\n\nHow long has Leapfrog been doing this? Since 2001\n\nHow often are results made available? Leapfrog publishes findings from the Leapfrog Hospital Survey starting in July each year, and monthly through February. From time to time, Leapfrog also releases topical reports on the results of the Survey, offering trends and insights on areas such as maternity care. All results are publicly available on the website.\n\nHow do I communicate with patients who have questions about our Survey results? Health care consumers are increasingly becoming concerned with the quality and safety of care they receive at hospitals and are using this information to make a decision on where to seek care. To help patients interpret your Leapfrog Hospital Survey results, refer them to your hospital’s detail page that can be accessed from ratings.leapfroggroup.org. This will allow patients to see where your hospital has demonstrated strong performance and where there is room for improvement. For areas in which your hospital scores poorly, assure your patients that you recognize this is an area of concern and illustrate what steps you are actively taking to improve the care you provide. Patients deserve full transparency from the hospitals in which they trust their lives and will likely be skeptical if they see your hospital has Declined to Respond to some or all of the Leapfrog Hospital Survey. We hope that you will respond to requests from patients to participate in the voluntary Survey, and escalate this request to your hospital leadership if appropriate. Finally, you can also encourage patients who have additional questions to contact Leapfrog directly at info@leapfroggroup.org.\n\nWhere can I find more information? You can find more information about the survey at www.LeapfrogGroup.org/Hospital, which also contains the link to the online survey tool that your hospital would use to complete the annual survey. Leapfrog Hospital Survey Results are publicly reported at ratings.leapfroggroup.org."
