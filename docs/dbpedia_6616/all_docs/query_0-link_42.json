        "meta_description": "Achievement Level Descriptors Achievement level descriptors (ALDs) describe the knowledge, skills, and processes that students demonstrate on state tests at pre-determined levels of achievement for each tested grade level. Technical Reports The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014) identifies professional standards, criteria, and recommendations for test developers and test publishers. One of those standards is to provide sufficient documentation that enables potential test users to evaluate the quality of a test, including evidence for the reliability and validity of test scores. Technical reports provide that documentation. Testing Statistics (Frequency Distribution) The intent of state testing is to determine a student’s skills and knowledge based our state learning standards in reading, writing, math and science. The score on each test (see sample score reports) is a snapshot of a student’s performance. Overall academic performance, not just a student’s state testing scores, should always be taken into account. Scale Scores: State Assessments Here you can find scale scores for Smarter Balanced, Washington Comprehensive Assessment of Science (WCAS) and other Historical Score Scale Ranges. Sample Score Reports Every student who participates in state testing receives a score report. If you have specific questions about your student's scores and/or performance, please contact your school. To view a sample score report, please choose one from the list below: Smarter Balanced Sample Score Reports Grade 3-8 Sample High School Sample Washington Comprehensive Assessment of Science (WCAS) Sample Score Report The Summative Scoring of ELA and Math document describes how math and ELA tests are scored. Please contact your local district office if you have any questions about your student's score reports. OSPI will assist District Test Coordinators in providing alternate formats (e.g., Braille) of score reports upon request. Email Assessment and Student Information at OSPI with the district request for assistance. Request to View Your Student's Test Parents and guardians of students who were enrolled full-time or part-time in Washington public schools during state testing may view their student’s Washington Comprehensive Assessment Program (WCAP) tests.",
