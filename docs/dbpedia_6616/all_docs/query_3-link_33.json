        "text": "How Do I Join?\n\nEnlisted\n\nFirst, contact a recruiter or request more information for answers to basic questions about joining.\n\nWith your recruiter, report to a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS). Here you will take the ASVAB and undergo a physical exam.\n\nSpeak with a career counselor about which Navy job is right for you based on your physical qualifications and ASVAB score.\n\nTake the Oath of Enlistment and receive orders for Recruit Training Command (RTC), also known as boot camp.\n\nOfficer\n\nThere are many avenues to becoming a Naval Officer. You can become an Officer through the United States Naval Academy (USNA), Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC), or Officer Training Command (OTC). OTC includes Officer Candidate School (OCS) and Officer Development School (ODS). To determine which route is best for you and explore available career paths contact a Navy Officer recruiter.\n\nDISQUALIFICATIONS\n\nThere are a number of reasons one may be unable to join the Navy. Even if you can’t serve, there are many other ways to help the American people.\n\nMEDICAL\n\nMaintaining physical, mental, and emotional health helps you succeed in the Navy. These requirements are established to make sure you’re prepared to carry out your duties. Some medical conditions may disqualify you from serving in the Navy:\n\nContagious diseases that would endanger the health of other personnel\n\nConditions or defects that require excessive time lost for necessary treatment or hospitalization\n\nConditions demanding geographical area limitations\n\nConditions aggravated by the performance of required duties and/or training\n\nCAN I STILL JOIN IF I HAVE ASTHMA, POOR VISION, OR POOR HEARING?\n\nAsthma could potentially prevent you from joining if you were diagnosed with it after your 13th birthday. Hearing, vision, and asthma qualifications are usually determined by medical exams and are not service-specific. You can still request an asthma, vision, or hearing loss waiver if a doctor denies your application. Connect with a recruiter.\n\nCAN I JOIN IF I HAVE ADHD?\n\nPotentially. It will only prevent you from joining the Navy if you’ve been treated with ADD/ADHD medication within the last year, or if you display obvious signs of the condition. Many with this history get medical waivers. Cases are looked at on a case by case basis. Connect with a recruiter.\n\nYou can still join with a medical disqualification as long as you get a medical waiver, which is issued on a case-by-case basis. If you have a specific medical condition and are not sure whether it disqualifies you, connect with a recruiter.\n\nVALUES & CHARACTER\n\nCandidates will be expected to follow and uphold the Navy’s core values of Honor, Courage and Commitment if they want to join.\n\nIF I HAVE A PREVIOUS FELONY OR A CONVICTION, CAN I STILL JOIN?\n\nThe Military Services are responsible for the defense of the Nation and should not be viewed as a source of rehabilitation for those who have not subscribed to the legal and moral standards of society at-large. Generally, felons and those with several convictions can’t join the Navy, but moral waivers or felony waivers are available in some cases. The waiver procedure is not automatic, and approval is based on each individual case.\n\nWHAT OFFENSES OR MORAL BEHAVIOR-RELATED ISSUES CAN'T BE WAIVED?\n\nThe offenses and moral behavior-related issues that cannot be waived include:\n\nIf you are under any form of judicial restraint (bond, probation, imprisonment, or parole)\n\nIf you are subject to civil court conviction or adverse disposition for more than one serious offense, or serious offenses with three or more other offenses (apart from traffic)\n\nIf you are found trafficking, selling, or distributing narcotics, including marijuana\n\nIf you have three or more convictions related to driving while intoxicated, drugged, or impaired in the past five years before joining\n\nIf you have been convicted of a felony crime of rape, sexual abuse, sexual assault, incest, any other sexual offense, or when the disposition requires the person to register as a sex offender.\n\nIf you are convicted for five or more misdemeanors\n\nIf you are unable to pass a drug or alcohol test, or if you have current charges pending against you\n\nIf you have been previously separated from the Military Services under conditions other than honorable or for the good of the Military Service concerned\n\nIn you have received an unfavorable final determination by the DoD Consolidated Adjudication Facility on a completed National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) or higher-level investigation, which is adjudicated to the National Security Standards in accordance with Executive Order 12968, Reference (j), during the accession process.\n\nCITIZENSHIP\n\nAlthough the Navy wants people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, all candidates must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident with a valid Green Card, (officially known as a Permanent Resident Card).\n\nDRUGS & ALCOHOL\n\nThe Navy has a zero-tolerance policy for drug use and alcohol abuse. Dependency on illegal drugs or history of drug use or alcohol abuse can disqualify you from service.\n\nWAIVERS\n\nWHAT CAN I DO IF I DON’T MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS TO JOIN?\n\nThe Navy has a waiver process that you can take advantage of to prove you overcame a disqualifying issue that would otherwise prevent you from joining the Navy. After submitting a waiver, a review takes place to make sure you can join. If your waiver is denied, you can also look into pursuing a civilian career within the Navy."
