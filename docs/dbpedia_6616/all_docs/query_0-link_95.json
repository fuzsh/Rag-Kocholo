The approach they take toward product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility. Build the best product: Their criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet. Cause no unnecessary harm: They know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good. Use business to protect nature: The challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life. Not bound by convention: Their success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things."
