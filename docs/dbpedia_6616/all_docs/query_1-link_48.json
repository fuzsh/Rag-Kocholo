        "text": "If you’re looking to learn more about credit scores, what a FICO score is (as well as bureaus like Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion), and how you measure up to other Americans, let’s dive into this exhaustive list of credit score statistics that you should know.\n\nNumber of Americans With No Credit History\n\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), approximately 26 million adults (one out of 10) are considered to be “credit invisible”, meaning they have no credit history as they’re without credit cards, loans, and other lines of credit.1\n\nOf course, if you have a credit card, that doesn’t necessarily mean you will have a credit score. Around 19 million adults lack a score altogether due to credit reports with minimal credit usage or out-of-date credit history. Now’s the time to open a credit card or loan to build your history.\n\nThe Average Credit Score by Cohort\n\nWhat Is the Average Credit Score?\n\nData provided by Experian revealed that the average FICO credit score (scores maintained by the credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) for Americans was 716 in 20212.\n\nAccording to Experian, this average FICO score may be a result of credit scoring factors such as fewer late payments or delinquencies on credit cards, shrinking debt (credit card debt, loan debt, etc.), and a decrease in credit utilization.\n\nThere are other credit scoring models such as VantageScore, but the majority of lending decisions are made using FICO scores, so this review is focused only on FICO scores.\n\nWhat is the Average Credit Score by Age Group?\n\nThe average credit score across various age groups in the U.S. reveals an upwards trend in the average credit score, with each age group experiencing a minor credit score increase in comparison to average credit scores reported in 2019.3\n\nHere is the following average score breakdown by age group:\n\nAges 18-23: 674\n\nAges 24-39: 680\n\nAges 40-55: 699\n\nAges 56-74: 736\n\nAges 75+: 758\n\nWhat Is the Average Credit Score By Generation?\n\nThe above credit score statistics translated into generations rather than age groups provide us with the same average scores. These average scores by generation include the following:\n\nGeneration Z: 674\n\nMillennials: 680\n\nGeneration X: 699\n\nBaby Boomers: 736\n\nSilent Generation: 758\n\nAverage Credit Score By Income\n\nAccording to American Express, the average credit score by income are as follows4:\n\n$30,000 or less per year: 590\n\n$30,001 to $49,999: 643\n\n$50,000 to $74,999: 737\n\nThe correlation between lower average credit scores and lower-income may be associated with factors like higher-income individuals being able to pay back credit card debts (with lower interest rates) more easily as well as being able to maintain a lower credit utilization ratio.\n\nThose with higher income may also have higher credit limits in comparison to those with lower income.\n\nThat being said, income is not the most accurate measurement of scores. Income is only one factor that plays a role in your score. You can still have a low income and have good credit. If you fall into a lower income bracket, don’t worry. Your income doesn’t determine your score.\n\nPercent of Credit Files that Don’t Qualify for a FICO Score\n\nThe Ascent (a publication operated by The Motley Fool) reports that data released in 2019 found 11 percent of Americans don’t qualify for a FICO credit score5.\n\nIn order to qualify for a FICO score, you must have:\n\nAt least one credit account (credit card, loan, etc.) that has been open for at least six months (the length of credit history will impact your score)\n\nAt least one account that has reported to credit bureaus within the past six months\n\nNo deceased status on your account6\n\nIf you share a credit card or other types of credit with someone who has passed, this may account for the deceased status that’s preventing you from receiving a FICO score on your credit report. Watch your credit with a credit reporting agency like Experian to report this.\n\nPercent of Americans Who Have a Credit Score of 800 or Higher\n\nAnother report from The Ascent reveals that only 22 percent of Americans have a credit score of 800 or greater7.\n\nThose who have a credit score of 800 to 850 are considered to have exceptional credit, and it appears that older individuals as well as those with incomes ranging from $101,000 to $150,000 have much higher credit scores within the perfect range.\n\nThe Average FICO Score Increase in the Last Decade\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, the average FICO score has increased by approximately 24 points. The average FICO score in 2010 was 687, while today’s average FICO score in the United States is 711.\n\nThis trend increase in credit score statistics also seems to appear in different age brackets, as illustrated in the data above in Experian’s and The Ascent’s reports.\n\nPercent of Adults Who Never Check Their Scores\n\nOne study conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research and sponsored by TransUnion revealed that 54 percent of adults never check their credit scores8.\n\nChecking your credit score is a crucial aspect of reaching your financial goals and correcting any mistakes in your credit report.\n\nWhether you regularly use a credit card or are paying back loans like student loans, always check your score on a regular basis, whether it’s through a third-party application or using an established credit reporting company like Experian.\n\nPercent of Adults Who Check Their Score Monthly\n\nData regarding how many adults check or don’t check their scores will vary from study to study due to the nature of the sample population. Research offered by CreditCardInsider.com found that only 21 percent of their respondents check their credit score on a monthly basis9.\n\nThis low number can be supported by data in other studies, such as a LendingTree survey that found only 33 percent of adults checked their score within the past year in 202010.\n\nWhat is the Highest Credit Score?\n\nThe highest possible credit score that you can receive is 850. FICO scores range anywhere from 300 to 850.\n\nWhat is Considered as a Perfect Credit Score?\n\nIf you manage to reach a score of 850, you have obtained the perfect credit score as this is as high of a score that you can reach when you grow your FICO score. That being said, an exceptional credit score falls anywhere between 800 and 850, which is close to perfect.\n\nWhat is Considered as a Poor Credit Score?\n\nAccording to Capital One, a FICO score that falls below 580 is considered to be a poor credit score. Lower credit scores can make it difficult to get approved for credit cards or loans as approximately 61 percent of those with low credit scores fall behind on their loans11.\n\nCome up with a credit card debt or loan repayment plan (for default loans like student loans) to reduce debt and credit utilization, look for accounts that build credit, and find other ways like Experian Boost to improve your score if you have negative items contributing to your bad credit.\n\nExperian also offers free credit score checks to help you stay on top of your score and payment history. Your credit card balance doesn’t have to stop you from moving forward financially.\n\nWhat is Considered as a Good Credit Score?\n\nEquifax reports that scores between 670 and 739 are considered to be good credit scores. Meanwhile, scores ranging from 580 to 669 are considered to be fair12.\n\nPercent of the U.S. Population that has a FICO Score Below 550\n\nFortunately, a low percentage of the U.S. population appears to have low FICO scores. Data released by FICO in 2019 reveals that only 11.1 percent of the U.S. population has a FICO score ranging between 300 and 54913.\n\nIt also reveals a downward trend, indicating that the average FICO score is on the rise and the average credit card debt and other debts are on the decline for Americans.\n\nWhat Percentage of the Population Has a Credit Score Over 700?\n\nThe same data referenced above also reveals the percentage of the population with a score of over 700. According to FICO.com, approximately 59.2 percent of the U.S. population has a credit score range between 700 to 850.\n\nWhich City/State has the Highest FICO Score?\n\nThe Ascent (which we referenced in the section, % of Americans Who Have a Credit Score of 800 or Higher) reports that the State with the highest FICO score is Minnesota, which has an average FICO score of 739, the highest average credit score in the U.S.\n\nWhich City/State has the Lowest FICO Score?\n\nMeanwhile, data from the resource above lists Mississippi as having the lowest average credit score among its residents, with the average FICO score being 675. This score is still considered to be a good credit score, which is a positive indicator of overall credit health in the U.S.\n\nThe Credit Score Needed to Buy a House\n\nYour FICO score plays a major role in your ability to secure a mortgage. The type of mortgage that you’re looking to secure will determine what your score should be. According to QuickenLoans, these are the following credit scores you need to work with lenders14:\n\nConventional Mortgage: 620\n\nVA Loan: 580\n\nFHA Loan With 3.5 Percent Down: 580\n\nFHA Loan With 10 Percent Down: 500\n\nIf you fall below these guidelines, ask yourself, how long does it take to build credit? Then, come up with a plan of action to help you work towards your goal.\n\nThe Credit Score Needed to Buy a Car\n\nAccording to Investopedia, the average credit score you will need to purchase a car is 661 and above15.\n\nYou may be able to find financing options with a bad credit score, but you will generally need a cosigner or more money to put down towards your car loan when you have bad credit since you are a nonprime or subprime borrower.\n\nYou should also consider the role insurance scores play in your car buying journey as credit scores help insurance companies assess risk when you apply for insurance. Make sure your credit score is correct with Experian or other bureaus before you apply for insurance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\nhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-study-shows-financial-product-could-help-consumers-build-credit/\n\n2. https://www.fico.com/blogs/average-us-ficor-score-716-indicating-improvement-consumer-credit-behaviors-despite-pandemic\n\n3. https://www.cnbc.com/select/average-credit-score-by-generation/\n\n4. https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/credit-intel/credit-score-by-age-state/\n\n5.https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/articles/22-of-americans-dont-have-a-credit-score-heres-why/\n\n6. https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/faq/scores/fico-score-requirements\n\n7.https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-credit-score/\n\n8.https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/02/11/credit-score-more-than-half-americans-check-monthly/4715077002/\n\n9.https://www.creditcardinsider.com/blog/2019-survey-reveals-widespread-credit-score-misconceptions/#credit-monitoring-misconceptions\n\n10. https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/americans-check-credit-reports/\n\n11. https://www.capitalone.com/learn-grow/money-management/what-is-a-bad-credit-score/\n\n12.https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/credit/score/what-is-a-good-credit-score/#:~:text=Although%20ranges%20vary%20depending%20on,and%20up%20are%20considered%20excellent.\n\n13. https://www.fico.com/blogs/average-us-fico-score-ticks-706\n\n14. https://www.quickenloans.com/learn/credit-score-to-buy-a-house\n\n15. https://www.investopedia.com/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-car-5181034\n\nGET STARTED"
