        "text": "Chances are if you've ever filled out an application for a college loan, apartment, auto loan or mortgage, you've been at least somewhat concerned with your FICO score. Any time you ask a lender to provide you with money, you can be sure they're going to look at your credit report to assess their risk in that relationship.\n\nAnd the odds are good that if you are among the roughly 60% who actually do know their credit score, you might also be curious where you rank among the masses.\n\nWe have sifted through a lot of information and compiled some average credit score statistics.\n\nWhy Is Credit Score So Important?\n\nCredit score is important because it reflects both your responsibility and your ability to pay off your credit bills. Any sort of business giving you a loan, either in a monetary form or in a form of a series of payments, will look at your credit score to determine how likely you are to pay back the loan, and to do so in a timely manner.\n\nCredit scores act as a mirror into your financial activity that lenders and even employers can look at to see how reliable they feel that you are with money.\n\nBenefits of Good Credit Score\n\nHigh credit scores come with many advantages. Lower interest rates allow you to pay less for a big purchase than others with a higher interest rate.\n\nHigh scores often result in lower interest rates because the seller or the bank sees your positive reputation and sees you as less of a risk to not pay back the money.\n\nSimilarly, you’re more likely to get approved to buy a house, rent an apartment or take out a loan with a high credit score. When you’re not seen as a risk and they feel like they can trust you to pay for the house or pay back the loan, they are far more likely to allow you to take out a loan or buy the house.\n\nConsequences of Bad Credit Score\n\nBad or lower credit scores can increase your interest rates and hurt your chances of getting approved for certain housing or loans.\n\nYou’ll most likely be seen as less reliable than those with positive credit scores because of your history with making payments back in a timely manner, if at all.\n\nGetting a loan can be especially tough. Low credit scores reflect your past ability to pay back credit payments. If they see a low credit score tied to you, they might think that you don’t have the ability to pay back the loan that they will give you.\n\nIf your credit score isn’t great, there are still other things that banks and lenders take into consideration. They might look at your level of income and make a determination of your reliability in that way.\n\nMaybe they’ll combine that with your age and see that you haven’t had a ton of time yet to grow your credit score. Whatever your credit score may be, there are other factors that are considered other than credit score.\n\nLenders and banks will also commonly look at your debt to income ratio. This will compare the amount of revenue that you make with your monthly debt payments.\n\nThis is a great way to see if a customer will have the money in the immediate future to pay back whatever the loan might be. So just because your credit score might be lower, don’t let that get you down.\n\nSure, you should try to improve your credit score as soon as you can. But, if you’re applying for housing and are worried about your credit score getting in the way, remember that other factors are taken into consideration aside from just your credit score."
