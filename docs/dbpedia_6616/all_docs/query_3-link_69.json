        "text": "Enlisted Soldiers must first qualify and then be selected to join Special Operations. Requirements vary within each of the five units, but can include things like qualifying for a security clearance or having an ASVAB entrance test score above 100. After qualifying, Soldiers begin rigorous mental, physical, and technical training that can take between several months to over a year to complete.\n\nSpecial Operations Soldiers complete more training and special courses, which means they receive promotions and climb in rank and pay faster than regular Soldiers. Special sign-up, re-enlistment and skill-based bonuses and other benefits are also available to them. Beyond compensation, there’s the opportunity for personal growth and the chance to have a unique and exceptionally rewarding experience.\n\nNot everyone who pursues Special Operations training is successful, but everyone who attempts it is respected—regardless of the outcome. If you don’t make it through training, you’ll still be highly trained and qualified for another position within a regular Army unit."
