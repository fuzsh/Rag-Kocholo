        "text": "Parentheses are curved punctuation marks that enclose text (like this). They always function in pairs, with each one curving away from the text inside it.\n\nThe word parentheses comes from the Greek parentithenai, meaning “insertion” or “to put beside.” It’s what parentheses do: They insert text in writing, beside the rest of the sentence.\n\nPersonification is a type of figurative language that gives human traits to animals, plants, objects, and other non-human things. For example,\n\nThe blanket held me close.\n\nThe computer suffered.\n\nThe dog scolded me.\n\nPeople can do amazing things, from running and leaping to feeling complex emotions. We are unique in that way. That's why personification is what writers use to bring non-human things to life by giving an animal or object qualities and abilities that only a human can have. This creative literary devices helps us better understand the writer's message and adds interest and fun to poems and stories."
