        "text": "This Chronology is provided for those new to the study of the Russian Revolution. It offers a fairly detailed time line of the events of 1917 itself but features only major historical events before and after the Revolutionary year. Events occurring in Russia are dated according to the Julian calendar; events occurring abroad are dated according to both the Julian and (Western) Gregorian calendars, until January 31 1918 when Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThis paper presents a corpus analysis of the addresses that the leaders of the Soviet Union and Russia deliver every year before the New Year. The content of a New Year address is strongly codified and usually contains references to important events of the previous year. Analysis of the ways that the lexical patterns used in the New Year addresses are transformed and follow changes that have occurred in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia provides information about the ways linguistic units reflect political realities.\n\nIn contrast to 1917 or the late 1980s, when respectively, socialism and Western-style liberalisation were seen as almost magical solutions to all problems, there is no consensus on the formula for change today, while Russiaâ€™s current zeitgeist in the form of great power nationalism is completely appropriated by Putin. In addition, the majority of the Russians already lived through the experience of the major upheaval during Perestroika and post-Soviet transition. Under these circumstances current evolution of the regime, which increasingly looks like stagnation, is much likelier than a new revolution. But the longer necessary changes are delayed, the higher the chance of a violent, sudden transformation in Russian affairs."
