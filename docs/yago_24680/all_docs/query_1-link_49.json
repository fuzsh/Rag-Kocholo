        "text": "Hey readers! This is the rewritten version of the original Ivangorod Prosperous: Russia's Early Rise to Power but just shortened it to Ivangorod Prosperous to not get so confusing. There are several changes that will occur between the original one and the rewritten version, in which I will eventually explain. Because of my successful attempts to post maps in my other threads, I will also try to include maps in this thread, but may not be successful in it. Without a further ado, the prologue.\n\n---\n\nPrologue: Divergence\n\nFate may seem to be indifferent to the misfortunes it hands out to unwary kings and queens in all of humanity’s history. At times, it grants good fortune to any king whose aspirations for national glory of his country will be granted, and at times it grants bad fortune to other leaders whose personal goals would be frustrated. Typically, any king during the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Ages must have a surviving son in order to select him as his successor as ruler. In the event that the king can only sire daughters with his wife, a transition to a new dynasty will be inevitable. However, dynasties can rapidly change at a whim, when a king dies without any children or when a king is overthrown by disgruntled citizens resentful of his ability to rule. Sometimes new dynasties are formed by mergers of ruling royal families as intermarriage between various clans have strengthened relations between nations. Of course, fate can also dictate whether a newborn prince or princess can have live past his or her infancy or die prematurely. This is the story of a newborn prince who would be credited with giving a desperate king a much needed son.\n\nEngland of 1536 was a time when King Henry VIII had already gone through one unsatisfied marriage with Catherine of Aragon, mainly due to the survival of Princess Mary who was born back in 1516 and the subsequent deaths of Mary’s other unknown siblings. It was not until his marriage to Anne Bolelyn that Henry had a chance of getting the son he needed. Indeed, three years before Anne would become pregnant with another child, she had given birth to Princess Elizabeth, for whom she will play a very different role from what she was assigned. As the newborn baby boy was brought into the world, Anne thanked God that she had finally given birth to the new heir of England. When the newborn boy didn’t respond at first, Anne grew worried. News of the birth and Anne’s worries reached the King as he went down into the room where Anne gave birth. Henry VIII prayed and pleaded for his new son to live. Finally after just three minutes of silent prayer, the baby boy began to cry. Henry laughed with joy as he saw his new son and gave another prayer of thanks.\n\n“As I began to lose hope, the Lord has decided to give life to my newborn son. Oh, how I’ve longed for the moment when I can finally groom him to succeed me when I will finally leave this Earthly realm.” – Henry VIII in 1536.\n\nThe newborn son was named Richard Tudor, in honor of his grandfather and was not yet baptized as the English Reformation was currently underway. Henry was not sure whether or not Richard should follow the Roman Catholic faith, as his daughter Mary was baptized as, or to embrace the Protestant faith like Richard’s sister Elizabeth. It would eventually be up to Richard himself to decide when he grows up, as the Protestants haven’t gotten powerful in this stage. For most of Richard Tudor’s childhood he was tutored by John Cheke until the age of 12 when Henry VIII searched for a more, practical tutor who can teach Richard the joys of maritime exploration. It fell upon Richard Chancellor (for whom he would later play a role in the formation of the Anglo-Russian relationship) to help teach his king’s namesake son how to be a practical sailor. As a young boy, Richard Tudor grew interested in watching ships leave the Thames River for their journeys into the Mediterranean and beyond, and occasionally he earned a chance to see English soldiers marching off to war. Such interests were noticed by Chancellor, who thought of Prince Richard as a more, suitable king that can actually pay attention to the needs of England’s economy and prestige in a world where the Reformation challenged the authority of the Catholic Church. At the same time, Henry also took care of his daughters’ educational needs, often resulting in Richard joining his siblings during their learning session. Such sibling interaction was observed by the chamberlains and what really piqued their interest were Richard’s relationships with Mary and Elizabeth. As the eldest child in the family, Mary had viewed Richard with mere indifference due to their different mothers, but Elizabeth shared a great bond with her brother to the extent that he would personally preside over the decision to marry his sister off.\n\nIn contrast to the extravagant lifestyle of his father, Richard preferred to live a frugal life, having witnessed the lavish and excessive spending Henry VIII undertook in maintaining the household and the construction of 53 warships needed to defend the British Isles from any French attack. Indeed, when he would inherit the throne of England in 1547 after his father’s death, Richard not only had to find ways to replenish England’s treasury but he had to contend with a power struggle against his eldest sister. Because of his young age, Anne Bolelyn became the Queen Regent and ruled in his name until Richard was old enough to rule by himself. It would be during King Richard IV’s reign that events in the east would drag England into a fateful meeting with the exotic domain known as the Tsardom of Muscovy.\n\nTurn for a Different Life:\n\nIn 1541, Baron Roman Yurievich Zakharyin-Koshkin and his family stayed in the town of Ryazan when a Crimean Tatar raid broke out in the outskirts of the city. As the Tatars plundered and burned the town, Baron Roman led a militia in repelling the Tatars from the outskirts of Ryazan, but an arrow struck him in the stomach. Even as a militiaman took out the arrow, the baron cried out in pain and died before he could see his family members abducted by them. One of the Crimean Tatars named Ayup gleefully dragged an eleven year old named Anastasia Zakharyina and tied her up. He saw the young girl as a potential bargaining chip for their deals with their Ottoman masters, though that prospect was short lived. A group of Don Cossacks ambushed the raiding party while they were close to the Don River and the border with the Ruthenian lands, led by an ataman named Timofey (this is OTL Yermak’s father). As Timofey’s Cossacks fought the Crimean Tatars, Ayup began to gallop away from his fellow raiders when Timofey gave chase. Even as Ayup looked back to his pursuer, he didn’t notice another group of Cossacks from a different host converging on him. The other ataman slashed Ayup’s throat and retrieved the young girl. Timofey then convinced the Cossacks of the different host to give the girl to him as she belonged to Muscovy. The other Cossacks agreed to hand her over to him and left. Timofey sadly notified the young Anastasia that her entire family was killed by the Tatars and he was the one who saved her. As young Anastasia wasn’t sure what to do next, Timofey suggested that she should live among the Don Cossacks instead of returning to Moscow, as he didn’t know if Anastasia had any relatives left. Sadly, her brother Nikita Romanovich was among the dead, as she was told. However, the tragic end of Anastasia Zakharynina would earmark the start of another chapter in her life as a young former boyar’s daughter who has now joined the Don Cossacks.\n\nAnastasia’s life took a turn for the better when Timofey announced in 1546 that she would be arranged to marry his son, Yermak Timofeyevich. At first, Anastasia was anxious at the prospect of marrying the son of a minor Cossack ataman. Having lived as a member of a prominent boyar family, the young lady was naturally uncomfortable with a marriage to someone of lower status. During her time among the Don Cossacks, Anastasia gradually learned that most of its members were runaway serfs who dislike their lives under domineering landlords and other nobility who owned land. Such a harsh life had been a sharp contrast with the comfortable life she had led before her family’s tragic death. Her courtship with Yermak was encouraged with Timofey’s blessing, though they would not formally marry until they reached 18. Thus Anastasia and Yermak eventually got married with Timofey, the other Don Cossacks and a local Russian Orthodox priest as witnesses. Though this march was an unusual one, it would have provided the Don Cossacks with a highly rare pedigree: Yermak’s descendants would have the bloods of both Cossack and boyar. An unusual mix, albeit a possibility in the political climate of Muscovy.\n\nMuscovy – From Lubeck to Ivangorod:\n\n1547. On a cold night in the port of Lubeck, several hundreds of craftsmen hid inside a ship heading eastwards. Hans Schlitte, the man who was ordered by his master in Moscow to bring the craftsmen into an unknown, backwater port of Ivangorod, in order to rebuild it for proper use as a merchant port. Earlier on, the Poles and Livonians gave the order to prevent any craftsmen, regardless of origin from traveling into the cold, harsh lands of Muscovy. However, the port authorities were inside a pub, having a good time while they kept buying each other drinks. They were unaware of the ship’s movement as it began to sail under the silent night. Schlitte promised most German merchant companies a bunch of lucrative contracts on trade and finance in the coveted Oriental trade through Muscovite territory. As the ship bound for Ivangorod continued to sail, not one recon ship has ever bothered to stop Schlitte’s ship for inspection and the German craftsmen arrived in Ivangorod without any incident whatsoever. Upon inspecting the port’s appearance, it soon became clear to Schlitte and the German craftsmen as to why they were recruited to work in the port. Ivangorod was dominated by a single fortress, but the harbor itself was pitiful. Neglected ships were about to sink deeper into the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the town itself was quiet. Old Muscovy was desperate to enter the Baltic Sea trade with many other nations, and little did Ivan IV knew, Ivangorod would become the place where it all started. How a tiny port has put Russia’s place in the world, albeit at the expense of its neighbors.\n\nIvan IV welcomed the craftsmen into the port of his namesake and allowed the local women to present them bread and salt. One of the craftsmen explained to the Muscovite tsar that it would take almost three years to completely rebuild the port and make it impressive for merchant firms to do business in. He had a good reason to express his desperation: the Polish domains and the Livonian Order were eager to shut out their Orthodox Christian neighbor from the Baltic, as well as the Black Sea for economical purposes. While the craftsmen would work on improving the port, Ivan IV had recruited local Russian peasants to Ivangorod so they can learn the tools and skills of the trade in building a port, for future expeditions. It also helped the peasants to learn a thing or two about building a village or a city as well, in case Russia herself might want to expand beyond her borders. In 1550, Ivangorod was finally completed. Three companies from three different countries expressed interests in opening a branch in Russia, in which one of them would express an interest in seeking an overland passage into China. The Muscovy Company was founded in 1551 by Richard Chancellor (King Richard IV of England’s erstwhile tutor), who would eventually become the first unofficial English ambassador to Russia.\n\nIn addition, Chancellor gave Ivan a letter written by Richard IV, stating his country’s desire to form relations with Muscovy and to form a mutual alliance against the Catholic powers of the day. He also suggested to Ivan that he should wed his sister to cement the alliance, though Ivan was uncertain about taking up the offer of marrying a foreign princess, especially a princess who happened to be a Protestant and has a Catholic sister. Besides, there were plenty of female candidates back in Moscow for whom he would like to choose as his new wife. Even so, the idea of marrying an English princess would surely be of great benefit as she will no doubt help Ivan with building the foundations for a modern, Russian state. Such reformations are sorely needed, for Moscow is in danger of becoming overrun by hostile neighbors, all of which were dominated by Catholics and the ever fear of Catholicization runs deep in the Russian psyche. Just before he met Schlitte’s guilders, he was formally crowned Tsar of All Russias, claiming his ancestry from the rulers of Kievan Rus’ and asserting his authority over Muscovite lands. In addition, the claim of Moscow as the Third Rome was now confirmed after he took the title of Tsar.\n\nIn 1553, Ivangorod was finally completed, with Ivan IV calling for the celebration of the port’s completion. The Russian Orthodox Church gave their blessing and prayed for its success. A new church was built to commemorate Ivan III’s foundation of Ivangorod as a port, which was set to be finished in 1556 as the St. Boris and Gleb Cathedral was officially named. In the same year however, Richard IV of England would face a power struggle with the Catholic factions rallying around Princess Mary for whom they viewed her as the rightful monarch that will keep England firmly within the Catholic Church, while the Protestant factions rallied around their king. It will all begin when Mary gave a harsh rhetorical speech just outside Northumbria, condemning Richard and Elizabeth for conniving with ‘heretics’ against the Papacy. Furthermore, she also criticized Richard’s decision to establish relations with a dangerous, half-civilized wasteland like Muscovy and vowed to overthrow his rule and launch a Counter-Reformation effort to stop the Church of England from breaking their union with Rome.\n\nElizabeth’s Tour of Russia and Ivan IV’s Hospitality:\n\nIn September of 1551, Richard IV wrote a letter to Chancellor of the Muscovy Company on Ivan IV’s search for a potential bride. Chancellor’s response was that the number of suitable brides left were either not qualified or connected to prominent boyars whom Ivan IV considered as enemies. In what was to become the most controversial and bold move, Richard IV sent his sister Elizabeth Tudor aboard an English ship bound for Ivangorod. There, Ivan IV and his entourage would inspect Elizabeth and see if she is suitable. If Ivan isn’t convinced, Elizabeth is instructed by her brother to formally invite the Tsar for a tour of England, though that instruction was later dropped on Chancellor’s advice. Instead, Elizabeth came to Ivangorod by herself, with a letter from Richard IV to the Tsar, as he was busy preparing for the civil war against English Princess Mary. Upon arriving in Ivangorod, Elizabeth and Ivan IV formally greeted each other while the English ambassadors inspected the streltsy guards. Though he was amused by her looks, it was her dominant personality that really moved him. For the first few days of October in 1553, Elizabeth cursed her brother for setting her up with such an unbearable man like Ivan due to their different personalities. However, during a party in November of 1553, Ivan had confided in Elizabeth that he had a deep personal hatred of the nobility within his realm due to bad experiences as a young child. His parents were killed by scheming boyars, and he was helpless to stop it. Elizabeth herself may not have sympathized with Ivan’s issues, though the idea of the nobility that can actually kill their monarch was nothing short of being a heinous crime. Moreover, as Ivan added, he wanted to build a foundation for a longer lasting empire that will last for a long time but right now Russia is in need of allies. Elizabeth then proposed to Ivan that if they got married, they could easily come up with new ideas to help improve the way Russia is governed. Although serfdom would become a hot issue within future Tsars, Elizabeth suggested that their movements could be made easier by setting a time limit on how long should a landlord keep their serfs. Elizabeth was also given a tour of the Moscow Print Yard as Ivan demonstrated his use of the printing press by arranging the letter blocks to compose a message. Although printing presses were now common in Europe, Ivan’s love for literature convinced Elizabeth that she could probably invite English playwrights into Russia to spearhead the development of Russian arts and literature.\n\nIn October of 1553, Elizabeth and Ivan formally married in the St. Boris and Gleb Cathedral in Ivangorod with numerous boyars attending the wedding. However, Elizabeth herself had to formally convert to the Russian Orthodox faith in order to be eligible as Ivan’s wife and eventual Tsaritsa, which she had some trouble until Chancellor told her that by converting to Ivan’s religion, she can also be in a position to help spearhead the much needed reforms Russia desperately needed. However, Elizabeth’s conversion would eventually provide the devout Catholic English Princess Mary the proof she needed: England is in danger from falling into apostasy and heresy with the Protestants and the schismatic Orthodox Christians in a joint alliance together. The first few months of their marriage was in good condition as Ivan was taught by both his reliable boyar allies and his new English friends in the Muscovy Company on table etiquette and proper manners befitting a gentleman, especially a Tsar who cares a lot about Russia’s image abroad. True to Elizabeth’s word, she wrote back to her brother and persuaded him to bring notable playwrights like Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare to Ivangorod in order to help publish Russian poems thought to have been lost.\n\nEngland – Of Civil Wars and Marriages:\n\nBack in 1551, both Richard IV and Princess Mary spent a considerable amount of time building their armies that would decide the fate of the English throne. At the same time, Richard IV’s sisters got married in the same year, with Mary’s decision to wed Philip II of Spain giving further boost to the Catholic cause in England (opponents feared that England would become a Spanish vassal) In May of 1553 Danish King Christian III visited England to sign a formal treaty of alliance with Richard IV and arranged for the young English king to marry Princess Anne of Denmark. Anne Bolelyn was thrilled with Richard IV’s choice for a bride since she was raised as a Protestant, and the bloodline of the Tudor family has now extended into the House of Oldenburg. Such connection would no doubt forge a closer bond between England and Denmark. In addition, Denmark would also promise the English Protestants aid in fighting the Spanish backed English Catholic factions supporting Mary, while the Spaniards have the Dutch Revolt on their hands.\n\nThe riots which plagued East Anglia and Northumbria were triggered by Catholic protests against increasing Reformation efforts by Richard IV to allow greater freedoms for Protestant priests and to promote the idea of a married clergy. Such proposals have naturally gone against Catholic doctrine of a celibate clergy, though there were dubious rumors of the Catholic missionaries’ behavior in the New World circling around. Furthermore, Protestant mobs have already begun to smash Catholic Churches of its images and at one point had torched a Catholic monastery. Sectarian violence around England continued on until 1553, in which both Richard IV and Mary waited until one of them made their move. On February of 1553, it would be Richard IV who will start the fight, but not in the British Isles.\n\nThe self-declared Dutch entity grew resentful at the Spanish attempts to suppress their religion. In a country where economic commerce was far more important than religious homogenization, religious tolerance was necessary. Though the Spanish Empire had gotten rich over their control of the silver mines in the New World, they never bothered to implement measures that would have kept the value of silver at a favorable level. Richard IV attempted to counter Philip II’s stern measures by signing an economical concession with the Spanish Netherlands in which Dutch merchants are free to trade with the English. This move infuriated Philip II to the extent that he began to send thirty Spanish warships to back the English fleet loyal to Princess Mary. Philip’s fleet engaged the combined Anglo-Danish fleet in what was now the Battle of Antwerp on March 2nd, 1553. Mary’s warships soon joined the Spanish fleet in deterring the Danish transport ships from entering English territory on Dover, though the Danes responded by bombarding Spanish land positions in the Spanish Netherlands. It certainly helped Richard IV’s Protestant cause when Dutch rebels pinpointed the location of the Spanish harbors in Antwerp, allowing the makeshift Dutch fleet to join the Danes and English Protestants in annihilating the Spanish warships. By March 4th, most of Mary’s warships were sunk on the bottom of the English Channel in their attempt to retreat back to England, while Philip was forced to withdraw his ships back to Spain. However, he did manage to sneak five Spanish troopships into Dover. 2,500 Spanish tercios landed in Dover by March 10th, while Richard IV rallied his armies stationed in East Anglia against Mary’s armies approaching Suffolk. The English Protestants were forced out of East Anglia and into the border with Scotland where Mary, Queen of the Scots, waited with her army. The Scottish Mary was well aware of her neighbor’s civil war which involved her namesake’s desire to launch a Counter-Reformation and decided to stay neutral. Her motive in allowing the English to destroy themselves was simple: with a weak England on Scotland’s border, the Scots could possibly expand into England. Moreover, Scottish Queen Mary also had in mind the liberation of Ireland from English occupation.\n\nThe Siege of York as it was now known began in June 19th, 1553 when English Princess Mary decided to attack the city. By capturing York, Mary would have encircled Richard IV from Northumbria and East Anglia and have the Protestants cut off from their Danish and Dutch allies. However, by July 5th, 1553, the Danish Army had attacked the Catholic stronghold in Suffolk in cooperation with a rebel Protestant force led by Thomas Wyatt. Consequently, the Spanish Army in England under the Duke of Parma’s command were now encircled from their temporary base in Kent, with Wyatt’s advance force inflicting a small defeat upon the Spaniards. As September approached, English Princess Mary’s forces were increasingly trapped in York as Wyatt’s main army began to advance northward. Though Richard IV’s army managed to rout the Catholics from York, things were about to get even more difficult. Yet as Richard IV approached the age when he can rule by himself, English Princess Mary grew even more desperate to depose him and Anne Bolelyn.\n\nRussia – The Plan for the Conquests of the Khanates:\n\nRussia’s trade with the Baltic grew exponentially as Ivangorod soon became the center of commerce in the Baltic, much to Poland and Livonia’s horror. Indeed in December of 1553 the Polish court arrested the port authorities in Lubeck for their failure to stop Hans Schlitte from smuggling the German guildsmen out of the port. Their subsequent executions did little to stop the Russians from using Ivangorod as their base from which they can trade with the Swedes, Danes, Dutch and the English. The Muscovy Company remained in charge of the European-Russian commercial trade, though Swedish King Eric XIV decided to pursue commercial relations with Russia instead of waging war against them, in return that Russia doesn’t target the ports in nearby Livonia and Estonia. Ivan IV agreed to Eric XIV’s deal and allowed Swedish merchant ships to ship in their goods into Ivangorod. The profits accumulated from the Ivangorod trade enabled the Tsar to build an army that would finally put an end to the troubling existence of the former Tatar khanates: the Kazan, Astrakhan and Crimean Khanates.\n\nChapter One: The Second Hundred Years’ War Part One\n\nEurope was not a safe place for any dissident of the Roman Catholic Church for obvious reasons, among which would be that the Protestants have directly challenged Catholic doctrine. Moreover, the Counter-Reformation movement in countries like Spain and Portugal would ensure that Catholicism must remain the dominant faith in their lands. The origins of the so-called Second Hundred Years’ War lay in the current English Civil War of 1553 between the Protestant King Richard IV and Catholic Princess Mary, by which the Protestants were at least victorious in certain battles like the Siege of York. However, the tide of the war soon began to turn against Richard IV as Philip II of Spain began to commit more troops to Mary’s cause by January of 1554. At the same time, Denmark began to help supply Richard IV with its own ships, soldiers and provisions while King Christian III became more active in the civil war. In February of 1554, Anne Tudor of Denmark successfully gave birth to a baby girl as Richard later named her Catherine Tudor, and eventually in 1556 Prince Alfred Tudor would be born. In a war weary English state, some English shipbuilders escaped across the border into Scotland while certain playwrights like Christopher Marlowe escaped to Russia.\n\nEngland – The Civil War Continues:\n\nSpanish troops fighting alongside English Princess Mary’s army had managed to occupy Portsmouth and Liverpool, which served as Richard IV’s primary naval bases. As a result, Richard IV was forced to occupy northeastern Ireland (also known as Ulster) in order to rebuild its naval might in order to challenge the Spanish fleet operating in the English Channel. However, Richard IV soon found himself surrounded by hostile Irish clans who were fighting a long war against English encroachment of their lands, with Scotland massing their troops at their border with England. Things went downhill from there when Sweden negotiated with Scotland regarding Scottish Queen Mary’s marriage prospects. Apparently Erik XIV of Sweden had learned of England’s rivalry with Scotland and Richard IV’s marriage to Anne of Denmark. Because Sweden and Denmark have a long standing rivalry, Erik XIV used the opportunity to arrange for his brother Johan of Sweden to marry Scottish Queen Mary. Because Mary, Queen of Scots’s brothers was declared illegitimate children fathered by former King James V, she was the only legitimate child to be qualified for the throne of Scotland, with her namesake Mary of Guise acting as her regent. With Mary of Guise’s blessing, the marriage was confirmed and the House of Vasa has established its roots in Scotland. Another branch of the House of Vasa will be established sometime in the 1600s.\n\nSouthern England soon became a hub for Counter-Reformation activities as English Princess Mary (later dubbed as Bloody Mary) launched the English Inquisition against suspected Protestant sympathizers and her personal opponents. William Shakespeare soon ran afoul of Bloody Mary’s ‘authority’ in London (Richard IV temporarily made York his base for a while) and was smuggled out of England with the help of Protestant supporters. He joined many other English playwrights who were accused of apostasy against the Catholic Church by writing anti-Catholic poems to live in exile, usually in the Russian port city of Ivangorod. The sudden exodus of English intellectuals has a devastating effect on English cultural development as Bloody Mary’s actions crippled its ability to accommodate different ideas. It certainly did not help Bloody Mary’s cause when Philip II decided to continue his campaigns against the Dutch, many of whom were clamoring for independence from the Holy Roman Empire. An attempted invasion of Wales by Richard IV’s forces in March of 1554 ended in disaster as Welsh Catholics sided with Bloody Mary in repelling his armies, though Wales itself plunged into civil war by April 6th. The Catholics continued to make steady gains throughout England as Manchester and Worchester came under siege by the Duke of Parma’s forces. Wyatt the Younger responded by attacking Bloody Mary’s armies in nearby Swindon, setting the beginning of the Battle of Swindon Town.\n\nFirearms were still a rare commodity in Europe at the time of the Second Hundred Years’ War, forcing nations like England to rely on the obsolete longbow as its main weapon. Yet under Richard IV’s auspices, muskets were being manufactured for his army’s use, and factories in northern England were built to produce these weapons. Cannons too, were a rare commodity and were much more difficult to produce due to the large amount of metals needed to cast the cannon. It was precisely because of these factories’ production of modern weaponry that Bloody Mary and Philip II agreed to capture the weapon factories in Northumbria in order to help modernize their forces, though Richard IV responded by attacking minor Catholic outposts within English territory.\n\nThe Battle of Swindon Town lasted for a week, with both sides unable to claim their victory, mainly due to sheer casualties and commanding officers were pulled out of combat for the Sieges of Manchester and Worchester. By May 21st, Wyatt the Younger was forced to retreat from Swindon Town as the Duke of Parma sent the Duke of Medina-Sidonia and 400 soldiers to bolster the English Catholics’ control of Swindon Town, which they later occupied in May 28th. Within six months, half of England came under Bloody Mary’s control as she confidently declared herself as Queen of England and Philip II soon acquired the new title of King of Spain and England. In effect, their marriage had resulted in a de facto dynastic union between England and Spain, though Richard IV still had a chance to regain his lost lands and restore Protestant control of the country. Starting in July 9th, 1554, Richard IV negotiated with the Dutch and the French for military aid in expelling the Catholics from England. Three days later, he wrote to his sister Elizabeth to plead for Tsar Ivan IV to send token reinforcements to bolster his invasion plans. In response, the Dutch were only able to send financial support, but the French were able to help Richard IV in another way: an attempted French invasion of Spain and Northern Italy.\n\nBy July 17th, 1554, the French Army under the nominal command of Duke Francis of Guise crossed the Pyrenees and attacked northeastern Spain, besieging Barcelona by July 30th after a grueling journey across the Pyrenees and dealing with sporadic Spanish resistance. Another French Army under French King Henry II’s command attacked Tuscany in conjunction with the Ottoman Empire, which had now allied with the French in the Italian Theater of the Second Hundred Years’ War. The Spanish islands of Majorca came under French naval bombardment as they were forced to surrender by September 3rd after news of the Spanish defeat in the Siege of Barcelona reached the Majorca defenders. With Philip II shifting his focus on defending the Spanish homeland from the French, he was forced to recall his troops from England, leaving Bloody Mary vulnerable to the vengeful wrath of Richard IV. As Richard IV’s armies began their re-conquest of English territories formerly under Bloody Mary’s control, the Protestant mobs soon accompanied them as they were motivated by revenge due to their condition and the English Inquisition that nearly destroyed their lives. English Catholics fled to Spain and Ireland, where they would form Diasporas within the Spanish and Irish communities. Richard IV soon returned to London as a conquering hero and his rule was restored. However, he received sad news from Parliament that his mother Anne Bolelyn was executed by Bloody Mary’s forces. Richard realized that as long as Bloody Mary was on the loose, England would never become secure.\n\nRussia – The Conquests Begin:\n\nWithin the same time as the 1553 English Civil War, Ivan IV had launched a war of conquest against the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan in which those two states fell under Russian control. However, Russia’s real challenge was their campaign against the Crimean Tatars, of which they were nominally under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. Yet at the same time, problems began to formulate in the Baltic front as Poland and Livonia began to amass their forces close to the Russian border. Their plan was to capture the port of Ivangorod and nearby Estonia in order to encircle both the Tsardom of Russia and the Kingdom of Sweden by a ring of hostile Catholic states. The conflict now known as the Ivangorod War (OTL Livonian War) would break out by December of 1554. Its origins lay in the successful escape of Hans Schlitte from Lubeck and it was only by November of 1554 that Poland threatened Russia with war if they did not extradite the German expatriate. Russia claimed that Schlitte is now a Russian citizen and therefore ineligible for extradition. Nevertheless, Poland was not so eager to allow Russia to become the dominant Baltic power any longer. By December 7th, the war between Poland and Russia began, with Lithuania, Livonia and to a lesser extent, the Crimean Khanate (because of their conflict against Russia).\n\nSweden saw the war as an opportunity to defend its Russian neighbor against its Polish rivals to ensure that its commercial interests in Ivangorod remained secured. Russia took advantage of its alliance with Sweden to launch an invasion of the Ruthenian lands, besieging Polotsk by January of 1555. At this time, the White Ruthenian population living under Lithuanian rule was at a loss as to whether or not they should support the Russian invasion, primarily due to their common Orthodox faith. Vasily Ivanovich Barbashin commanded a Russian force that besieged Polotsk, which eventually fell by January of 1555. Ivan IV’s main objective while Russia was allied with Sweden was to capture as much Old Ruthenian lands as possible in order to keep Poland and Lithuania weakened, though this had an additional outcome of speeding up the process of creating a more, lasting dynastic union that would later form the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Bryansk also fell under Russian control, as well as Vitebsk within three weeks, though Russian casualties reached 21,000 dead soldiers. For her part, Elizabeth was pushed into coming up with ideas to help sustain the Russian economy, and the Elizabethan reforms on finance which regulated the amount of taxes that can be raised was implemented, thereby making sure that the serfs pay enough money to replenish Russia’s treasury.\n\nDon Cossacks played an important part in the conquests of what is now Left-bank Ukraine, due to their knowledge of the terrain, as well as their roles in fighting the Crimean Tatars. Among the Don Cossacks, Yermak Timofeyevich would later emerge as a powerful ataman who later earned a reputation as a fierce fighter and a plague to his Crimean Tatar enemies. The lands around Zaporozhe was targeted by Yermak’s Cossacks, earmarking the first time the Don and Zaporozhian Cossacks clashed with each other, though neither side managed to grab the victory they needed. Other Don Cossacks had devastated the coastal cities of the Crimean Khanate in retaliatory raids. Devret Gilay, the Crimean Tatar Khan, sent a large force of Tatar horsemen to the Don host in order to cut off the Don Cossacks from their comrades in nearby Zaporozhe, though Russian streltsy sent by Ivan IV had successfully stopped the Crimean Tatar advance.\n\nEven as the Russian Army continued to advance towards the ancient city of Kiev, numerous problems remained unsolved. For instance, the Polish forces under the command of Stepan Bathory launched an attack on the city of Vitebsk (recently captured by the Russians back in February of 1555) and successfully routed the Russians out of southeastern White Ruthenia. Russian military leaders advised Ivan IV that Poland remained the most dangerous foe of the anti-Russian coalition and thereby must be taken out. The problem with the proposal was the other issue of the Crimean Tatars. Even as Sweden had second thoughts on maintaining its relationship with Russia, Poland was not willing to stop until Russia was permanently crippled financially. Thus a joint Polish-Livonian attack on Pskov began on February 23rd, 1555 with their intention to cut off the Russians from Ivangorod to Polotsk. Barbashin was recalled from Polotsk to defend Pskov with 39,000 soldiers against 37,000 Polish troops and 21,000 Livonian soldiers attacking the city. Luckily, a Swedish relief force sent by Erik XIV managed to help Barbashin’s forces in keeping Pskov from being overrun by Polish troops. In retaliation, Barbashin was ordered by Ivan IV to attack the important Livonian city of Daugavpils on March 3rd, 1555. The attack on Daugavpils would be one of the bloodiest battles of the Ivangorod Wars, as Russian losses were staggering. Out of 130,000 troops deployed, only 79,200 survived while Livonian losses were just as large, if not bigger.\n\nSwedish troops under Klaus Fleming’s command launched an invasion of Estonia in order to stop the Russians from conquering the much valued Estonian and Livonian ports in order to keep them contained in Ivangorod (and the caucus belli of a Russo-Swedish conflict during the 1610s) and to prevent the Poles from using Livonia to launch naval raids on Swedish territory. Consequently, Livonia was the first nation to withdraw from the war as they were forced to surrender to Sweden instead of Russia. The Treaty of Riga (1555) confirmed Swedish conquests of Estonia and Livonia and established claims on Semigalia. As Poland was forced to continue the war on their own, their military logistics were stretched to the limit. Only with the Kingdom of Hungary’s intervention in the Ivangorod Wars (their goal was to simply support the Polish Kingdom) did Poland’s chance of winning the war began to increase slightly. 50,000 Hungarian soldiers reinforced Stepan Bathory’s 32,970 troops stationed in the Ukraine and began to march towards Kiev, where the Don Cossacks under Yermak’s command fought against 21,000 defenders. In an ensuing battle between these forces, it was Yermak’s Cossack Army who was defeated on May 7th, 1555 as Bathory’s forces successfully routed them from Kiev.\n\nDespite Yermak’s setbacks in Kiev, Ivan IV was not upset at his failure to capture the cradle of ancient Rus’ civilization as he had more important matters to take care of. Vitebsk had to be retaken at all costs, and failure to do so would allow the Poles to menace Smolensk and position their troops within striking range of Moscow itself. However, other battles which had no small significance would continue to dominate the Ivangorod Wars until 1562. From the time period between 1556 and 1562, Yermak and his Don Cossacks would continue to fight the Crimean Tatars to a stalemate with both sides unable to win against each other. It was at during this time that William Shakespeare would create some of his most important works, such as “The Monk of the Volga” (1), a poem about a Russian Orthodox priest who faced a dire challenge in trying to convert the Muslim Tatars to Christianity, as well as historical plays like “Donskoy” (2), “Richard IV” (3), and a theatrical play which would become famous as it is intertwined with Yermak’s eventual conquest of Siberia, “Yermak”. As for Ivan and Elizabeth, four children were born within the time period from 1553 until 1663:\n\n- Andrei Ivanovich (1553-1562), the firstborn son of Ivan IV and Elizabeth. He died at the age of nine from a riding accident.\n\n- Yaroslav Ivanovich (1555-1608), the second son of Ivan IV and Elizabeth. He would eventually become Yaroslav IV, for whom Russia will face a succession crisis as he would father a daughter by his wife, Lyudmila Nagaya.\n\n- Anna Ivanovna (1560-1641), the first daughter of Ivan IV and Elizabeth. Not much is known about her.\n\n- Yuliya Ivanovna (1563-1617), the second daughter of Ivan IV and Elizabeth. Is famously known for her marriage to Yermak’s son with Anastasia Zakharynina, Nikita Yermakovich, for whom the House of Yermakov will eventually rise.\n\nIn 1563, Elizabeth discovered a plot hatched by the Bishop of Pskov and several prominent boyars in which they secretly planned to defect to Poland and to convert to the Catholic faith. She immediately told her husband of this plot. Ivan IV was outraged at the thoughts of his own subjects defecting to his enemies that he drew up plans to arrest the boyars implicated in the plot. As a result, several thousand citizens of Pskov and three hundred boyars who were found guilty of treason were sentenced to hard labor in the Ural Mountains instead. For some unknown reason, various boyars led by the Shuiskys also plotted to poison both Ivan and Elizabeth, for whom they perceived as a threat to their plans. Like the Pskov Conspiracy, Elizabeth’s trusted allies alerted her to this other plot and told the Tsar about it. Unlike the Pskov citizens who were guilty of treason, the Shuiskys were not spared from the Tsar’s wrath and had them impaled instead, in order to show example to any other defiant boyars of what happens when they try to defy their Tsar, though Elizabeth would later write bitterly in her memoirs that both Ivan IV and her brother Richard IV would implement such cruel punishments on their subjects.\n\nIn the same year, the Livonian Confederation launched a revolt against Swedish rule, with Polish help. Lithuania joined in helping their fellow Baltic allies eject the Swedes from their territories, although Ivan IV was pressured to take advantage of the chaos which unfolded in Estonia and Livonia. On August 4th, 1563, Ivan IV sent his trusted general Andrei Kurbsky to lead 69,000 Russian soldiers with an additional 3,500 Don Cossacks led by Yermak to capture all of Livonia and Estonia. However, Russia was not to gain all of those territories in this operation, but rather to help the Swedes suppress the rebellion. Five days after Kurbsky and Yermak crossed the border into Livonia; a Swedish relief force met up with them in the town of Reval and defeated the combined Polish-Livonian forces under Mikolaj Radziwill’s command. By September, the Swedes gained their momentum while the weakened Polish, Livonian and Lithuanian armies gradually weakened due to low provisions and further losses of the left bank Ukraine except for Kiev.\n\nUnfortunately, the Swedish and Russian governments were also hit by financial difficulties in sustaining their war effort as the sheer size of their armies proved to be difficult to sustain with monetary means. Even as the two nations were still confident enough to win the Ivangorod War, the mercantile traffic in the Baltic had stopped due to Denmark’s decision to close the straights guarded by the two islands of Funen and Zealand to merchant shipping. As a result, Ivangorod’s position as the top Russian port had declined in value. As a result, both sides had to meet in the Ukrainian town of Poltava for armistice talks. The Treaty of Poltava had restored the status quo between the two sides, as the Russians were forced to give up their gains in White Ruthenia and Ukraine to Poland and Lithuania, where as the Livonian Confederation became the sole governing body of Livonia proper while Estonia became a Swedish protectorate. Although Ivan IV expressed his displeasure in giving up such gains, he would later make up for it, in the conquest of Siberia.\n\nSuccess in Siberia, Failure in the Crimea:\n\nBeginning in the year 1566, three years after the Ivangorod Wars formally ended with the armistice and the Treaty of Poltava, Ivan IV and Elizabeth oversaw the reconstruction of Russian villages and cities with the funds they regained from the restored merchant shipping in the Baltic. King Christian III reluctantly authorized the reopening of the straights around Funen and Zealand to merchant ships. However, the lands beyond the Ural Mountains were unknown to most Europeans, and what lies ahead were soon discussed in Muscovite courts. The English Diasporas in Moscow consisted of Protestant merchants and playwrights like Shakespeare and Marlowe thrived on Ivan IV’s generosity as they used the Moscow Printing Yard to publish their works. Indeed, the first release of the play “Donskoy” in 1567 featured both men and women to play their roles. (As Elizabeth told Ivan in 1566, the young boys were selected to play the role of women, something the Tsar angrily disapproved for moral reasons) Russian literature thought to have been lost was published, while books banned by the Orthodox Church were still being burnt.\n\nNovgorod was placed under heavy surveillance in the wake of the Pskov Conspiracy as prominent boyars feared Ivan’s wrath. It was only at Elizabeth’s advice that Ivan eventually cooled down and loosened up the tight security in Novgorod. To improve communications between Novgorod and Ivangorod, Ivan IV authorized the construction of the Neva Road, named after the Neva River in which Ivangorod or Pskov was supposed to originate. The sole purpose of its construction was to help speed up traffic between those two cities, which in turn would help make communication and travel to Moscow and beyond a lot easier. Infrastructure was something that future Russian Tsars would take great care of within their domestic affairs mainly because of their need to ship out goods produced locally to be sold in foreign markets. As the European exploration period was currently underway with the Spanish and Portuguese empires staking out claims in the New World, other nations are eager to get into such trade. Yet even as the Spanish Empire would go on and become the wealthiest nation for a while until the rise of the Netherlands as a financial superpower, the Dutch began their long war for independence from Spanish rule. It was because of the Dutch Revolt that minor nations like Denmark and even Scotland would launch their own explorations of the New World. As for Russia, its geographical location makes it impossible for them to stake out claims in the New World, though they can certainly do so from another direction. That direction, would take them through the Khanate of Sibir. Before the colonization of Siberia can occur, one more problem had to be addressed. The main problem is the Crimean Tatar threat to Russia, and the Ottoman Empire that has launched an ambitious plan to conquer the Shahdom of Persia by building the Don-Volga Canal. The Ottoman Empire also called for the re-conquest of the Astrakhan Khanate from the Tsardom of Russia in order to regain its control of the lucrative slave market, though the plan had several flaws in it. Ottoman Grand Vizier Mehmet Pasha Sokolovic (Sokollu) authorized the deployment of 1,500 Janissaries and 2,000 Ottoman cavalry as well as several hundred cannons. Faced with such a grueling task of repelling the Ottoman Turks from the Pontic steppes, Krubsky was ordered to team up with Yermak in repelling the invasion force. At the same time, Elizabeth advised Ivan that the conflict between Russia and the Ottomans is a great opportunity to destroy the Crimean Khanate, and that he should send the Cossacks to conquer the Crimea.\n\nYermak’s Cossacks met up with Kasim Pasha’s forces in the outskirts of Old Sarai on February 3rd, 1566 and fought them to a standstill. Devret Gilay’s Tatar cavalry engaged the Don Cossack contingent forces east of Old Sarai, while Ottoman Janissaries advanced further northeast into Astrakhan. However, a main Russian Army led by Prince Serebianov met up with the Janissaries and began to bombard them with their artillery pieces. An additional 15,000 Russian streltsy descended upon the workforce constructing the canal and instantly drove them away while other Cossack regiments defeated a Tatar relief force attempting to protect the workers. Though the Ottoman project was ultimately abandoned, Ivan IV didn’t reject the idea of connecting the Don and Volga Rivers completely and made plans to continue what the Ottomans started. Though the Ottoman Empire was repelled from southern Russia, the Crimean Khanate remained a dangerous threat. So in cooperation with the Zaporozhian Cossacks, the Russians began to launch raids into the Crimean Peninsula, starting in April of 1566. It was also during this time that Ivan IV would personally lay a claim on the lands touching the Sea of Azov, with his goals of founding a brand new city overlooking the Black Sea. There was one problem: the fortress of Azov was controlled by the Ottoman Empire and control of the Don River to the Sea of Azov was protected by that fortress. Placing his faith in the Don Cossacks who proved to be valuable allies, Ivan IV sent Yermak once again to attack the Ottoman Turks and their retreating Crimean Tatar allies. The fortress of Azov has to fall, Ivan IV insisted, or control of the Black Sea trade will not be within reach.\n\nBecause the Russians had no town on the Black Sea from which they can build ships to attack the Ottoman controlled fortress, Ivan IV was forced to cancel the march on Azov until these conditions were met: one, the capture of territories which would later make up modern day Yaroslavidar Krai (OTL Krasnodar Krai), and having an ally as a backup. Unfortunately, none of these conditions would ever be met while Ivan IV was alive. It was now up to his son Yaroslav IV to pick up where he left. Thus Ivan IV suffered his first setback in his attempts to expand Russia’s territory south. In the east, it was another story. In 1567 Ivan IV launched an expedition against the Bashkir tribes and the subsequent annexation of their lands. The Stroganov merchant family presented their case to Ivan IV in Moscow on the economic potential of the lands east of the Ural Mountains if they were acquired through conquest by His Majesty’s armies. One of the boyars who expressed his concerns pointed out at the logistical nightmares the Russian Army would encounter, but the Stroganovs replied back by asking the Tsar for his consent in hiring enough Cossacks to destroy another Tatar Khanate east of the Urals. In this meeting Elizabeth observed the discussions held between her husband and the boyars. When the proposals for the possible conquest of Siberia seems to have fallen into obscurity, Elizabeth suggested that she could talk to her brother and ask him to send enough English pioneers to help with the expedition. Moreover, the riches of Siberia would not only help Russia economically, but Europe could benefit from the import of rare items that can only be acquired in Siberia. Ivan went along with the suggestion and later asked Anthony Jenkinson (the new leader of Muscovy Company as Chancellor died) for his advice. Jenkinson agreed to act as the middleman in the negotiation between Ivan and Richard IV’s governments. For Richard IV’s part, he sent three exploration ships with 60 pioneers aboard. While those exploration ships eventually arrived at Ivangorod after enduring three extra weeks of being confined at the island of Zealand, the Stroganovs also searched for several hundred pioneers among the Pomor community. It was only natural that the Pomors would be included in the colonization of Siberia, as they were experts in fur trapping, fishing and sailing.\n\nThe colonization of Siberia began in January of 1569 when Yermak arrived in Kazan with 500 of his men, along with 300 Pomors, 60 English pioneers and 340 Danish labourers sent by Christian III of Denmark. The start of the journey took them into the Ural Mountains and the Tagil River, where Yermak stationed 100 of his men to build a new Cossack host, later giving rise to the Tagil Cossack Host. By the time the expeditionary force reached the lands of the Siberian Khanate, Yermak proceeded to besiege the city of Qashliq with the available forces under his command, though they soon ran out of resources and had to return to the Tagil Host. Their retreat was not in vain, for within the Tagil Host the new trading town of Zakharyinsk was founded. Zakharyinsk was built on the Tura River (where the site of Verkhoturye stood IOTL), and it continued to serve as a major customs post between European Russia and Siberia. Within Zakharyinsk, the Danish and Pomor workers began to build new homes for the Cossack population (often away from the city itself as to preserve their way of life), as well as a city center and a military fortress to protect the city. The construction of Zakharyinsk would take three years to complete, by which the Russians would now shifting their focus from their southward expansion to the east. Zakharyinsk soon became the center of Russian power in the southern Urals as new enemies were beginning to take notice of its importance. The Nogai Horde was the second enemy Yermak’s forces had to deal with and it was not going to be east taking out two Tatar remnant Khanates at the same time. So Yermak decided to wait until 1575 in order to get enough reinforcements from Moscow. At the same time Ivan IV authorized the construction of artillery foundries in Moscow, Kazan and Zakharyinsk and to continue training new streltsy recruits. As Ivan realized, Yermak’s expedition was going to require more than just Cossacks and pioneers when they go up against Tatar raiders. By 1575, an additional 2,000 streltsy arrived in Zakharyinsk along with 50 cannons. Now Yermak was ready to capture Qashliq, and to destroy the Siberian Khanate.\n\nYermak’s second attempt to capture Qashliq began with the same predictable results as the first: the defenders were well equipped and well supplied through their raids on Russian settlements in the steppe, as well as help obtained from the Nogai Horde, who saw Russia as a threat to their position in the Caspian. In March of 1575, Yermak decided to split his forces when news of the Nogai Horde’s army approached Zakharyinsk from the south and appointed Pyotr Lyapunov to command the second army tasked with attacking the Nogais. By March 21st, Lyapunov’s forces met the Nogais in the outskirts of Zakharyinsk and aided by artillery barrages, the Nogais were routed back. When news of Lyapunov’s victory reached Yermak, he gave him full authority to extend his war into the heart of the Nogai Horde, but only to destroy their empire to remove another threat to Russia’s population. Qashliq soon fell by March 30th, and in an ensuing frenzy, the Cossacks looted the city. Yermak then proclaimed his victory over the Siberian Tatars and decided to rename it to Lyapunovsk, in honor of his subordinate who successfully defended Zakharyinsk from the Nogais. As Lyapunovsk and Zakharyinsk soon became important headquarters of the Siberian colonization efforts, Yermak authorized the construction of the Trans-Ural Road to connect the two cities together, as well as to extend the connection between Zakharyinsk and Kazan. From this point on, the Cossacks realized the importance of improved road connections in their plans to colonize Siberia and Yermak himself became de facto governor of Siberia. In addition, his new wife Anastasia Zakharyina gave birth to a boy named Danilo Yermakov back in 1556, and had now joined his father in the colonization efforts with his mother tagging along. The Siberian Royal Family were captured in the aftermath of Qashliq’s fall and were subsequently taken to Moscow as hostages, with a daughter of Kuchum Khan taken by the Cossacks and forced to marry Lyapunov.\n\nLife in the Siberian plains was not exciting at all, mainly because of its extreme climate. The Tagil Host was the only Cossack Host functioning in Siberia until the formation of three more Siberian Cossack Hosts: the Irtysh Host (founded in 1581), the Yenisey Host (founded in 1584) and the Ob Host (founded in 1585). For the most part, these Siberian Cossack hosts later integrated native Siberian peoples like the Mansis, Khantys and the Nenets into their ranks. Interracial marriages between Cossack men and native Siberian women occur frequently, resulting in the rise of mixed race Cossack warriors. As later generations of Cossacks in the Irtysk, Tagil, Ob and Yenisey hosts adapted to Siberian culture, they were able to have families of their own. These Siberian Cossacks also participated in one last campaign of their lives before Ivan IV’s death in 1584, and it was aimed at the Nogai Horde. Lyapunov was tasked with commanding the Cossacks for the last time as well.\n\nFall of the Nogai Horde:\n\nThe final campaign undertaken during the reign of Ivan IV occurred in 1582 when the threat of the Nogai Horde was impossible to ignore. Given the fact that Zakharyinsk remained a tempting target for Nogai raiders, Lyapunov’s army would finally put an end to such a troublesome state. Saray-Juk was under siege in July of 1582, with Russian artillery bombarding the city and the streltsy providing the distraction needed for the Cossacks to dig underneath the walls of Saray-Juk. As in the Siege of Kazan, the sappers kept on digging underneath while some streltsy helped carry barrels of gunpowder under the tunnel. When the sappers reached the walls and the streltsy volunteers rolled the last gunpowder underneath, one of the sappers lit up the fuse and waited until the gunpowder barrels blew up the wall. As the Nogais suffered casualties from the destruction of their walls, the Cossacks swooped down inside Saray-Juk and attacked the remaining survivors. After five additional days of fighting, the Nogais were forced to surrender on July 25th. Subsequently, the survivors of the Nogai Horde were left alone, though a few numbers of Nogai nobility were taken into Moscow and entered Russian service, where they also converted to Orthodox Christianity, just as their Siberian Tatar counterparts did. However, Lyapunov was recalled back to Zakharyinsk and was appointed governor of the newly named Southern Ural province.\n\n---\n\n(1) The Monk of the Volga is TTL’s version of “The Merchant of Venice”.\n\n(2) Donskoy is TTL’s version of “Hamlet”, though not really as much tragic as its OTL counterpart.\n\n(3) Richard IV is TTL’s version of Henry VIII, but it’s more leaning towards the tragic side.\n\nChapter Two: The Second Hundred Years’ War Part Two\n\nWhile Russia was busy expanding its domains into Siberia and Europe was becoming more entangled in the Reformation movements, the Ottoman Empire was in the middle of its own expedition. Buoyed by the need to stay on top of the competition with the Western European empires of Spain and Portugal and to gain control of the spice trade, the Ottoman Navy was deployed into what is now modern day Qaharistan (OTL Indonesia plus parts of Malaysia) in what was known as the Ottoman Expedition to Aceh. The Aceh Sultanate was on the front lines in their war against the Portuguese Empire over the spice trade, and while the Ottoman Turks were willing to help their predominantly Aceh-Champa allies, their involvement in later wars alongside the Sultanate of Brunei and the Kingdom of Tondo against the Spanish Empire will be the hallmark of Turco-Spanish rivalries until the 1800s. Unfortunately, the Ottoman Empire was set on expanding their domains in Africa, the Balkans and in the Caucasus that an expedition into SE Asia was deemed too costly. It was not until 1569 that Sultan Selim II would send Kurtoglu Hizir Reis into Aceh that would result in the rise of the Qaharid Empire in 1571 with Alauddin al-Qahar as the first ruler.\n\nOttoman and Qaharid Empires – Fateful Clash:\n\nIn 1568, Kurtogly Hizir Reis’s Ottoman fleet arrived in northern Aceh in the midst of Suleiman’s death and the succession of Sultan Selim II. Huge numbers of Janissaries, engineers and gunsmiths came along for the expedition, hoping that their expansion into SE Asia would help expand their spice trade with the Venetians. After suppressing a revolt in Yemen, Selim II was able to send more artillery on the journey to Aceh as well. Upon arriving in the city of Banda Aceh, Kurtoglu’s party was welcomed by the court of Allaudin al-Qahar, who offered the Ottoman Turks payment for their expertise in military matters with jewelry. Kurtoglu was notified by the Acehnese nobility that their rivals in the east, the Malacca Sultanate, continued to trade with the Portuguese and thereby posing a threat to their kingdom. Kurtoglu could see al-Qahar’s dream of empire in his eyes as he offered more than just mere jewelry to the Turks. A trade concession with the spice trade was far more lucrative to the Turks than to the Acehnese, and much more was to be done in ejecting these foreign strangers from their soils (ie: the Portuguese and the Spanish).\n\nIn October of 1568, Kurtoglu began to recruit three hundred Acehnese sailors and tradesmen in forming the small Acehnese Navy, though their purpose was to raid any coastal settlements controlled by the Portuguese and the Spanish. Three years back, the Spanish exploration party under Miguel Lopez y Legazpi had formally claimed the islands which will become the main theme of the Turco-Spanish rivalry, the Las Islas Filipinas, or the Philippine Islands. With Cebu established as their first city, Kurtoglu ordered the Acehnese sailors to begin their raids on Spanish settlements in 1569. At the same time, Allaudin al-Qahar requested to Kurtoglu that he should ask Selim II to send Ottoman administrators in helping him create a bureaucracy for his growing empire. Even though the Acehnese bureaucracy was impressive in its own right, they were still not strong enough culturally. So in March of 1569 Kurtoglu would sail back to the Ottoman Empire and request for skilled administrators from Selim II. In the Ottoman capital of Constantiniyye, Selim II wrote a letter to al-Qahar, formally establishing a partnership between the Ottoman and Qaharid Empires. Furthermore, Selim II would grant his Acehnese counterpart the right to bestow the title of Pasha on his skilled warriors. Kurtoglu Reis returned to Aceh with Selim II’s letter by 1570, by which al-Qahar’s Ottoman-trained Acehnese Janissaries would begin their campaigns throughout Sumatra.\n\nSpanish goals of Catholicization of the Philippine Islands were viewed by both the Qaharid Empire and the Sultanate of Brunei as a threat to their mutual interests. Earlier contacts between Acehnese pirates and Cebuano natives confirmed their suspicion with the construction of Magellan’s cross (which would eventually be burned down) and the further consolidation of Spanish rule in the Visayas region. Although the unification of Sumatra was achieved with indirect Ottoman help, Allaudin al-Qahar was eager to conquer both Brunei and Malacca in order to place his own domains on the frontlines of the war with Spain. Naturally, the Ottoman Turks would get involved in this conflict, which also contributed to the Turkish distractions from their wars in Europe. A bitter confrontation with the Malacca Sultanate resulted in the Acehnese-Malaccan War of 1570, where al-Qahar would command a small Acehnese fleet in bombarding the Malaccan stronghold of Pahang, and at the same time the Acehnese Janissaries engaged their ill trained Malaccan army. Al-Qahar’s forces proceeded to sack every single city in the Sultanate of Johor, while Kurtoglu’s Ottoman Navy had captured an important island on the tip of the Malay Peninsula and will later found a very lucrative trading port of Sarayada (palace of islands, located in OTL Singapore) Just as Zakharyinsk and Lyapunovsk were important assets to Russian colonization of Siberia, Sarayada and later on the city of Dagdasaray (OTL Singkep Barat) would become important trading centers in the Qaharid Empire, and those cities also served as de facto Ottoman special trading centers as well.\n\nThe surrender of Malacca’s Abdul Jalil Shah I resulted in his execution by al-Qahar and his subsequent decision to annex all of the former Malacca Sultanate triggered a hostile response from Portuguese colonial authorities in their occupied portion of Malacca. In December of 1570, the Ottoman Navy bombarded Portuguese Malacca and destroyed their trading post, leaving it vulnerable to Qaharid expansion. A naval clash between the Ottoman and Spanish navies just outside the island of Palawan resulted in a Spanish victory over the Turks, resulting in their withdrawal back to their bases in Aceh. However, it was the Ottomans who would gain an upper hand against the Spaniards in the 1571 First Sack of Manila.\n\nFirst Sack of Manila and SE Asian Seaborne Piracy:\n\nOn March 17th, 1571, twelve Ottoman navy ships and twenty Acehnese galleys sailed from Sarayada and reached Manila three weeks later due to a heavy storm. By the time Manila became the permanent Spanish capital city of their Philippine colony, the small states within Manila were declining, including the Kingdom of Tondo. By April 5th, the first Ottoman Janissary corps landed in the town of Namayan while Ottoman warships captured Corregidor Island. Their goal was not to capture Manila for the Qaharids, but to simply render it useless to the Spaniards. Much of the siege was similar in aspects to the Ottoman capture of Rhodes, though in this case the Ottomans completed their goals of sacking the city of its treasures, while Acehnese pirates would later recruit Visayans fleeing from Spanish Catholicization efforts and train them as apprentices in the art of seaborne piracy. Visayan and Acehnese pirates would become the focus of Spanish pacification efforts in the Indochina Sea (OTL West Philippine/South China Sea), as these pirates often targeted Chinese coastal cities for slaves to be sold into Ottoman markets, as well as cities in Vietnam. Vietnamese boys were often captured during these raids for the purpose of turning them into Qaharid loyalists through the Devsirme system adopted from the Ottomans. Most of these young Vietnamese Buddhist boys were later converted into Islam, along with boys of Chinese, Khmer, Siamese, Visayan and Tamil origin captured by the Visayan pirates.\n\n1584-1600 in Europe:\n\nAfter Ivan IV’s death, Yaroslav IV succeeded him as Tsar of Russia. By now, Dowager Tsarina Elizabeth (who was crowned as Tsarina back in 1578) had become influential in her children’s lives, with Yaroslav IV’s marriage to Yelena Sheremetyeva in the same year Elizabeth was formally crowned as Tsarina. Their lives in the post-Ivan IV regime started off with a different beginning. Indeed, on the day Ivan IV died, Yaroslav IV’s wife Yelena gave birth to a girl named Lyudmila Yaroslavna (1584-1648), though the midwives advised her not to get pregnant again after a complication in her labor nearly killed her. Yelena took the advice rather poorly as she failed her husband in getting him the son he needed. Yaroslav IV was also aware that the House of Rurik was bound to end at some point, though he also hoped to entrust the throne of Russia to the Pozharsky clan, one of the prominent boyars of either the Rurikid or Genghisid lineage, though Mikhail Pozharsky’s wife came from the Beklemishev clan.\n\nIn England, Richard IV and Anne of Denmark were successful in having three children: Catherine Tudor (1554-1610), Alfred Tudor (1556-1618), and Charles Tudor (1560-1620), while in Scotland John of Sweden and Mary, Queen of Scots were already married and the too, had three children: Malcolm Stuart-Vasa/Malcolm V Vasa (1566-1628), Alfred Stuart-Vasa (1570-1624), and Valdemar Stuart-Vasa (1572-1642). In Sweden, the long reign of Erik XIV without any interruptions allowed him to select Prince Gustav of Sweden as his heir designate. By the time Erik XIV died in 1577, Prince Gustav (1) succeeded him as King Gustav II Magnus of Sweden. He also received a marriage proposal from Sophie of Brandenburg and seriously considered marrying her. His decision to marry Sophie led to Sweden’s acquisition of Brandenburg and its expansion into Central Europe, though that marriage resulted in the births of five children: Wihelm Vasa (1584-1612), Anna Vasa (1587-1619), Johan Frederick Vasa (1590-1660), Hedwig Vasa (1594-1596) and Maria Vasa (1600-1671). However, Gustav II Magnus died in 1607 from his indulgent lifestyle, resulting in the ascension of Wilhelm I Vasa of Sweden. He would later be known for his two attempts to connect the House of Vasa with the House of Rurik in Russia, precipitating the War of the Russian Succession, and at the same time he would be the only Swedish monarch who remained unmarried, making his reign the shortest in Swedish history. At the same time, Yermak’s son Danilo Yermakovich would marry an unnamed daughter of the last Nogai Khan and have two children: Mikhail Danilovich Yermakov (1585-1652) and Rostislav Danilovich Yermakov (1590-1657).\n\nBy 1588, it was becoming clear that Alfred II lacked his father’s genius and preferred to ask advisors on what to do next. His inability to come up with policies would eventually lead to England’s first great crisis since the death of Richard IV. The main issue revolved around Irish resistance to the English presence in Ireland, and Alfred II’s response. When Richard IV was still alive, he preferred to deal with the Irish rebels through intermediaries. Alfred II on the other hand, had distrusted the Catholics so much that he made a fatal mistake after 300 English settlers were killed in Dublin. He ordered the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork to be burnt down to the ground to punish the Irish resistance. News of the Great Fires of Dublin, Limerick and Cork reached Philip II’s court in Madrid. Immediately, he began to send Spanish delegates to Dublin, promising them freedom in exchange for Spanish basing rights on Irish soil. The threat of the Spanish in Ireland was too much for Parliament as they requested for Alfred II to declare war. Thus Alfred II reluctantly declared war on Spain and began to mobilize his army. He began to ask for help from Denmark and France, but the French could not be in a great position to help. The Danes would be glad to help, but Sweden’s growing power prevented Christian IV from helping the English. Though the Spanish would be in a prime position to free the Irish Catholics from what they perceived as Protestant English rule, they had a war on their hands in Western Europe: the Dutch Revolt that had broken out in 1568.\n\nEnemy in the Backyard:\n\nIn 1590, the Spanish Navy led by the Duke of Alba landed in southern Ireland, on the ruined city of Cork. The rise of Hugh O’Neill as the leader of the Tyrone clan and his subsequent allegiance to the Catholic faith had fit well with Philip II’s goal of crippling English power in Ireland and to get the basing right the Spanish Empire desperately needed. English encroachment into Ulster was escalated under Alfred II’s watch as settlers from Protestant Scotland were sent to colonize Ulster. Irish infantry began to raid English settlements around Carrickfergus by driving out English sheriffs and expelling the colonists from the nearby villages. Faced with a well disciplined musketeer army, the English garrison in Ulster began to retreat towards the city of Belfast, where a large contingent of English troops remained. In what was to become the Siege of Belfast, O’Neill personally led 7,000 Irish soldiers and 2,000 Scottish mercenaries into the outskirts of the city and bombarded them with the artillery provided by the Spanish. At the same time, an additional 4,000 Spanish soldiers under the command of Enrique Alvar (the ancestor of the tragic Miguel Alvar) marched into Limerick and aided the local Irish rebels in Limerick and in Yellow Ford, where Hugh MagUidhir led a small motley group of Irish guerrillas in ambushing the remaining English garrison inside the city. Henry Bagenal, who was the commander of an advancing English army tasked with retaking Limerick, was killed in the initial attack by Irish irregulars who went into the hills. Many Irish factions now began to throw their support behind O’Neill’s leadership as they offered their services to his cause.\n\nIn London, Alfred II contemplated on abdicating from the throne due to his frustrations with domestic and foreign affairs. Domestically, he still couldn’t solve the financial problems they had from the sudden shortage of food due to its requisition by the English garrison in Ireland, and his insecurities gave way to dissatisfaction within Parliament. Rumors of a coup were easily cast aside by the king’s court, although Alfred II’s hesitation to find a match would nearly cost England its independence, and he had to find a solution to the Irish conflict rather quickly. It was then that Parliament began to formulate a plan to shift England from an absolute monarchy to an elective monarchy, on the Polish-Lithuanian model. In fact, Alfred II sent English emissaries to Warsaw for the election of Archduke Maximillian III to see how it works. Parliament began to nominate three candidates for the right to take the English throne, and those guys are: John Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, and Wilhelm Kettler of the Duchy of Courland. The campaign for England’s selection of its king gradually accelerated as Alfred II suffered an injury while he participated in a jousting tournament (the same kind of accident which eventually killed his grandfather, Henry VIII). Unlike Henry VIII though, Alfred II succumbed to a leg infection that eventually killed him in October 21st, 1592. Three days after his death, Parliament officially elected John Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp as King John Frederick I of England. To cement his power in the throne, John Frederick agreed to marry Isabella of Savoy, a move which raised Parliament’s anxiety that a Catholic queen would reignite the dreaded Inquisition of Bloody Mary. When she married John Frederick I, she was required to convert to the Anglican faith in order to be crowned as Queen of England. She agreed to do so, resulting in a public backlash within the people of Savoy. Nevertheless, John Frederick took charge of the war in Ireland and reorganized the English Navy instead of the army, mainly because of the Spanish Navy’s presence in Ireland.\n\nA rebuilt English fleet gathered in the port of Liverpool on December 9th, 1592 in a show of force against the Spanish Navy. The fleet arrived at Carrickfergus and engaged the Spanish Navy in what was to become the Battle of Emerald Sea, where a numerically inferior English Navy would go up against the larger Spanish warships. John Frederick I hoped to use the English fleet as a distraction so he can sneak in three transport ships containing 600 English soldiers and 400 Finnish mercenaries into Ulster. The diversion worked, but a well equipped Spanish coastal defense bombarded the transport ships as they reach closer to shore. Before the Finnish mercenaries could get into shore, the combined Spanish-Irish coastal batteries sunk the last two transport ships. The ship captain in charge of the ship containing the Finnish mercenaries at the last minute, decided to turn around and sail towards Scotland. To make matters worse, the English Navy ran out of gunpowder for their cannons and began to retreat. Sensing something wrong with the English fleet, the well supplied Spanish warships blasted twelve English ships into the bottom while the surviving warships limped back to Liverpool. However, the Spanish Navy soon ran out of gunpowder as well, though the English troops began to surrender.\n\nAlthough the rebellion in Ireland ended in a stalemate, in reality the Spanish only managed to get the port of Cork as their naval base and nothing more. The English were forced to grant Ireland its independence, and the Irish would have to elect their own monarch as well, as John Frederick I had to give up his claims on the Irish crown. An elective monarchy was established in Ireland, though the candidates in this case were all Catholic princes: Archduke Albrecht of Austria (known for his role in the War of the Russian Succession as the commander of the Commonwealth Army that invaded Russia), Archduke Wenceslaus of Austria, and Philip III of Spain. The Irish Parliament voted in favor of Archduke Albrecht to take the Irish crown, thereby becoming King Albert I of Ireland on December 31st, 1592.\n\nPoland-Lithuania – The House of Hapsburg Extends its Reach:\n\nIn 1569, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was formally established with the Union of Lublin. At that time, the Jaigellon dynasty was on its last throes as no other suitable heir was found to succeed Sigismund II Augustus, who would eventually die in 1572. Consequently, the Polish and Lithuanian nobility gathered in Warsaw to come up with potential new candidates. During Ivan IV’s reign, he was selected among the candidates for the throne, though he later withdrew his campaign because of pressure from Elizabeth and the rest of the Russian nobility. The remaining candidates were Stephen Bathory, Archduke Ernest of Austria and Henry Valois of France, though when Henry Valois became King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, his reign only lasted for four months due to his brother’s death and his return to France where he reigned as Henry III of France. It was then that the Lithuanian nobility began to send their emissaries to Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II’s court in Aachen, discussing the possibility of offering the Polish throne to one of his sons or brothers. Since Archduke Ernest was already selected as among the candidates for the Polish throne, the Lithuanians nominated Archduke Maximillian of Austria as their candidate. For six days, the discussions and negotiations went nowhere, and there was even talk of nominating Charles Tudor of England as potential King of Poland, but that nomination was rejected on the grounds that he was a Protestant and would not fit well within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Subsequently, the Papal nuncio intervened and suggested that they should elect Archduke Maximillian instead of his brother, Archduke Ernest. The Polish faction opposed the selection of a Hapsburg because of their demands for a Piast King. The discussions continued on until the Papal nuncio repeated their suggestion of choosing Archduke Maximillian, this time for strategic reasons. By having a ring of Catholic, Papal-friendly states from the Iberian Peninsula to the border with Russia, they can easily encircle the British Isles, Scandinavia, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. In the end though, Stephen Bathory withdrew his candidacy due to domestic problems in Hungary, and with further Papal pressure, Archduke Maximillian of Austria was elected as King Maximillian I of Poland-Lithuania. To this day, there is a famous Polish proverb, “Poland, thy doom comes from Rome”, indicating that Poland’s fortunes would go down with Papal intervention in its domestic affairs.\n\nRussia – War of the Russian Succession:\n\nYaroslav IV’s only daughter Lyudmila was the woman desired by most Russian boyars since Yelena Sheremetyeva was advised not to get pregnant again or she would die from childbirth complications. Indeed, the moment Yaroslav IV took the throne, numerous boyars that his father personally detested began to view Lyudmila as a legitimate bargaining chip for their ambitions. It was not only Russian boyars who took the advantage of Lyudmila’s presence. Wilhelm I Vasa of Sweden had also become King in the same year Yaroslav IV became Tsar, and he began to make preparations that would unite the Houses of Vasa and Rurik under Swedish suzerainty, though this was opposed by most boyars loyal to the current Tsar. The origins of the War of the Russian Succession will begin in 1590, when Yaroslav IV was searching for a suitable groom for his daughter. Among the candidates were: Dmitry Pozharsky, Prokopy Lyapunov (whose father was credited with the conquest of the Nogai Horde), Ivan Zarutsky and Ivan Bolotnikov. Most of these candidates were rejected by the boyars as they fought viciously within Moscow to select their own candidates. It only grew worse when Wilhelm I Vasa of Sweden arrived in Moscow for his negotiations with Yaroslav IV to have his brother Vladislaus marry Lyudmila and Stephen Bathory’s wife Anna Jaigellon would die in 1596. Stephen Bathory himself viewed the opportunity to gain Russia’s throne through his marriage with a Rurikid princess a suitable compensation for his failure to gain the Polish throne. Finally, a small skirmish in which Bolotnikov was killed by warriors loyal to Zarutsky and further boyar anger towards Yaroslav IV over his refusal to share power with those same greedy boyars ultimately led to the civil war.\n\nThe official start of the War of the Russian Succession began in January 7th, 1600 when the volcano in Peru erupted, contributing to the low levels of grain harvests and the subsequent shortage of food in Russia. Most of Europe also suffered from the same food shortages as Russia, though there were some countries that were lucky enough to escape from the tragic fate that befell the people of Russia. Subsequently, Zarutsky began to gather 5,000 Don Cossacks who were against Danilo Yermakovich’s position as ataman of the Don Host and marched towards Moscow. Yaroslav responded by asking for Ataman Danilo’s help in suppressing the rebel Don Cossacks with other Cossacks from the Tagil, Irtysh, Ob and Yenisey Hosts. Thus both sides met in the Battle of Smolensk.\n\nBattle of Smolensk:\n\nDanilo’s Siberian Cossacks ambushed Zarutsky’s forces just outside Smolensk on February 3rd, 1600. At that time, Smolensk came under Poland-Lithuania’s rule and Zarutsky asked for aid from Archduke Maximillian III in Warsaw with dislodging Danilo’s forces from Smolensk. However, Zarutsky’s liaisons with the Hapsburgs in Poland-Lithuania instantly received a negative response from his erstwhile supporters and were forced to defect to Poland only after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt by a Russian streltsy guard. While in Warsaw, Ivan fatefully met Marina Mniszech while searching for potential supporters within the Polish nobility. In February 28th, Poland-Lithuania declared war on Russia over their incursion into Smolensk.\n\n65,000 Commonwealth forces assembled outside the city, while Pozharsky was tasked with the defense of not only Smolensk, but Pskov as well. 54,000 Russian soldiers bravely defended Smolensk during the first initial Commonwealth bombardment, while Danilo’s Cossack contingent forces crossed the border and attacked Polotsk by March 1st. Unlike the earlier Russian war in which Ivan IV’s armies managed to conquer Polotsk but was forced to hand it back to Poland-Lithuania, Yaroslav IV’s army was going to capture not only Polotsk, but eastern White Ruthenia and keep it for themselves. In March 8th, Wilhelm I Vasa brought Sweden into the war on Russia’s side as he too, had plans to destroy the newly built Commonwealth. Three days after Sweden’s entry into the war, a Swedish relief force under Karl Gyllenhielm marched towards Koknese Castle in order to force the Poles to divert their troops from Smolensk. A Commonwealth cavalry force under Jan Carol Chodkiewicz’s command was sent to Smolensk to counter Ataman Danilo’s Cossack regiment and the two cavalry forces fought to a standstill. At the same time, the Principality of Moldavia witnessed the coup launched against Mihai Viteazul and the ascension of Radu Mihnea as Prince of Moldavia. Buoyed by the PLC’s distraction in Russia, Mihnea sent emissaries to Moscow for a potential alliance with Yaroslav IV against Hapsburg Poland-Lithuania and the Ottoman Empire. Within the Muscovite court, Yaroslav IV jumped on his chance to form an alliance with a Balkan country since it basically fulfilled one of the two requirements Russia had to fulfill in order to take the lands around the Sea of Azov and the Crimean Khanate. In addition, a large Moldavian army under the command of Mihai Dalca marched towards Odessa and besieged the port, forcing to divert even more soldiers from their siege in Smolensk. At this point, Archduke Maximillian III finally realized that Sweden and Moldavia’s entry into the war had something more to do with settling scores (Sweden wanted to cripple the PLC and Moldavia wanted to get rid of the pro-Polish government of Mihai Viteazul) than with helping Russia. At the same time, Pozharsky’s army managed to force Chodkiewicz’s Husarias to retreat from Smolensk. Finally on March 10th, Ataman Danilo’s Cossacks managed to raid Zarutsky’s camp and captured several Polish and Lithuanian soldiers.\n\nFall of Polotsk:\n\nJan Zamoyski was appointed the commander of the Commonwealth army tasked with the defense of Polotsk on the same day the Siege of Smolensk ended. After March 1st, Danilo’s Cossacks kept swinging back and forth between Polotsk and Smolensk in their daring task of defeating the Commonwealth armies, which was no easy task. By the time Smolensk had fallen, only 3,000 Commonwealth forces survived the battle long enough for them to be redeployed into Polotsk. A larger Russian Army under Prokopy Lyapunov’s command had bombarded Polotsk with the available artillery. By now, the Swedish defense of Koknese castle had reached a climax when Gyllenhielm ordered the Swedish cavalry to smash the depleted Commonwealth infantry positions.\n\nChodkiewicz’s Husaria forces were also deployed to defend Polotsk from Lyapunov’s army, though a third artillery barrage had killed the Lithuanian-born Husaria commander while attempting to rally his men under bombardment. At this point, the Swedes had reached Kircholm by March 21st and besieged the defending Commonwealth garrison there. By March 22nd, Pozharsky joined Lyapunov in Polotsk and decided to lure the Commonwealth forces out into the open. Lyapunov then sent a message to Ataman Danilo for his Cossacks to harass the Commonwealth defenders into pursuing them. Thus the Cossacks began to set fire on the villages controlled by Commonwealth troops, forcing Zamoyski to lead his cavalry out of the city. Just as Zamoyski had cornered the Cossacks in the town of Rasony, Pozharsky’s cannons ambushed the Commonwealth cavalry, killing several horsemen in the process, including Zamoyski himself, whose attempts to break out ended badly.\n\nAs Pozharsky’s artillery corps pounded the walls of Polotsk into rubble, Ataman Danilo’s Cossacks returned to the city as well, though they were now tasked with cornering the defenders by cutting off the supply routes from Polotsk. By April 2nd, Ataman Danilo’s Cossacks had reached the city of Borisov. White Ruthenian Orthodox Christians joined in the uprising against Commonwealth rule as Archduke Maximillian III’s uncompromising stance against the Orthodox Christian population alienated those communities, who hoped to live more comfortably under Commonwealth rule than either Ottoman or Russian tyranny. Five days later, Borisov fell to Ataman Danilo’s Cossack army. Faced with shortages of foodstuffs and medical supplies, the garrison in Polotsk was forced to surrender to Pozharsky’s forces.\n\nCampaigns of 1601-1609:\n\nFor most of 1601, Yaroslav IV began to delegate the task of daily management to Lyudmila, even as various Russian boyars and military leaders kept on fighting for power. Indeed, Pozharsky carved out a domain for himself in the Azov region with Ataman Danilo’s help. To cement the alliance between Ataman Danilo’s Cossacks and Pozharsky’s faction, Pozharsky would give them the task of conquering the eastern territories of the Ottoman Empire in present day southern Russia and to destroy the Crimean Khanate. However, the war against the Ottomans and the Crimean Tatars would be waged with the cooperation of the Moldavian Principality under Radu Mihnea’s command. Thus on September 24th, 1601, the Ottoman Empire entered the war against Russia in response to Ataman Danilo’s incursions into the Caucasus region. The fortress of Azov was attacked by the Cossacks while Pozharsky’s forces would attack the Crimean Khanate the next day and Radu Mihnea’s Moldavian Army would join in the day after. The siege of the Azov fortress would last for four months, in which heavy casualties were reported from both sides. Finally in January 2nd, 1602 the fortress finally fell to Ataman Danilo’s command. Yaroslav IV immediately sent 29,000 streltsy and 100 cannons to support Ataman Danilo’s 5,000 Siberian Cossacks. As the Ottoman garrison was forcibly ejected from the Azov fortress, Yaroslav IV himself grabed his sword and plunged it into the ground where he proclaimed the foundation of a new city: the city of Yaroslavidar, or “Yaroslav’s gift”, a site of Russia’s new port on the Sea of Azov. However, Yaroslavidar was only the first port in Russia’s south to be founded with many more ports to be acquired from the Ottomans and the Crimean Tatars. For his part, Pozharsky’s forces were defeated by the Crimean Tatars just outside Aqmescit and would not launch an attempt at defeating the Crimean Khanate until after dealing with the Commonwealth invasion of Russia.\n\nYaroslav IV brought shipbuilders to Yaroslavidar in order to build the city’s first shipyard and harbor. The project would be completed in 1605, with the shipyards completed in 1602 in order to build up Russia’s first Black Sea fleet that will take part in the eventual destruction of the Crimean Khanate. Fifteen warships were constructed within the years 1601-1602, and an additional seven ships were constructed after 1602. Most of the lumber used to build the ships came from the Don Host, allowing the Don Cossacks to participate in the economical development of the Don River region. By 1604, Yaroslavidar soon became a major economical hub in the Black Sea and Caucasus regions, with the shipyards dedicated to the construction of merchant ships. However, the cost of building up a sizeable fleet in the Black Sea outweighed the benefits of the city’s income from its maritime trade as Yaroslav IV grew increasingly worried that no one was going to succeed him. In 1608, Yaroslav IV died from old age in his beloved Yaroslavidar and requested to be buried there instead of Moscow. With no clear successor, the War of the Russian Succession would grow worse.\n\nBy 1609, various boyars claimed the title of Tsar of All Russias, including Dmitry Pozharsky himself. Things got worse when a large Commonwealth army led by Archduke Maximillian III’s brother, Archduke Albert of Austria, moved towards Smolensk once again. This time, the fortress of Smolensk would fall within just five weeks, as the Russian defenders were too busy engaging other Commonwealth armies within the Dnieper River region. Smolensk fell by October of 1609 after the siege began back in September 4th. With Smolensk secured, Archduke Albert’s forces moved towards Moscow and attacked it. As Russia’s position gradually weakened, their Swedish ally turned against them instead, besieging Pskov, Novgorod and Ivangorod in the process. Pskov fell under Arvid Staalarm’s control, though the inhabitants were lucky to live under Swedish rule. Ivangorod, the lynchpin of Russia’s Baltic trade, fell to Swedish control by October 18th, 1609, leaving Novgorod the only Russian stronghold not occupied by the Swedes. Russians living under Commonwealth rule were not as lucky, since the Hapsburg Polish King had no intention of showing mercy and tolerance towards the predominantly Orthodox Christian population there. So in a move that would forever mark Russia’s horrific reputation as an intolerant empire, Archduke Maximillian III requested to the Papal nuncio that a special committee of Inquisitors should be set up. Atrocities were committed by Commonwealth forces, much to their own commanders’ horror when news of villages in the Russian countryside were torn down and its peoples were killed. When the Commonwealth Army finally reached Moscow in November 22nd, 1609, Dmitry Pozharsky met Archduke Ernest’s 60,000 Commonwealth soldiers with 75,000 Russian soldiers in the fields of Kulikovo (the same site where the Muscovites defeated the Mongol hordes in 1380) and fought them to a standstill. Zaporozhian Cossacks who suffered from Hapsburg-sanctioned Commonwealth discrimination against Orthodox Christians switched sides and turned the tide of the battle against Archduke Albert’s forces. Numerous Commonwealth prisoners were executed en masse by Pozharsky’s victorious soldiers, and the Russian Orthodox Church recognized Pozharsky as the new Tsar, with his marriage to Lyudmila Yaroslavna confirmed by Patriarch Job of Moscow in December 7th, 1609. Now that ‘Tsar Dmitry I Pozharsky’ was officially declared Tsar, his first order as the new Tsar was to regain the lost Russian lands in the north. This time, he would assign the command of the Russian veteran armies to Ataman Danilo’s son, Mikhail Yermakov.\n\nConquest of the Baltic:\n\nRussia’s official start of its re-conquest of Pskov and Ivangorod began in December of 1611. Why Tsar Dmitry I Pozharsky took so long to prepare for the battle was mainly because he needed two years’ time to replenish the Muscovite treasury and because Lyudmila gave birth in 1610 to Dmitry I’s daughter Sophia Dmitryevna. By the time the plan to regain those cities mentioned above started, Lyudmila was pregnant with a baby boy. Prince Ivan Dmitryevich Pozharsky was officially born in May 27th, 1612, in the midst of Russia’s campaign against the Swedes in the Baltic.\n\nPskov was retaken in January of 1612 after its siege took a month to complete. Ivangorod was finally retaken by March 12th, 1612 after Staalarm’s Swedish garrison destroyed much of the city to render it useless. Dmitry I Pozharsky reacted by ordering Ataman Mikhail to capture the Swedish fort of Nyenskans. Thus the Siege of Nyenskans would last as long as the Siege of Azov Fortress, though the battle itself was much bloodier. By May of 1612, the fortress of Nyenskans fell to Ataman Mikhail’s control, and as a reward for his role in the liberation of Russia’s northern territories, he was authorized to build a new city that will serve as a temporary (until 1614) port until Ivangorod was rebuilt. On June 3rd, 1612, the port of Mikhailodar (OTL St. Petersburg) was officially founded as a small repair port for Russia’s Baltic fleet. Much of Ivangorod’s shipyard materials were relocated to Mikhailodar, allowing Dmitry I Pozharsky to double Russia’s naval buildup. It was said that by the time the Second Hundred Years’ War came to an end, all of Europe became poor, even the Protestant countries as well. Thirty ships were constructed in Mikhailodar and were subsequently deployed against a much larger Swedish fleet guarding the Baltic. Danish King Christian IV entered the war on Russia’s side in June 8th, 1612, though his primary goal was to keep the Swedes from invading Norway, which he successfully did in the Danish-Norwegian campaigns of 1612. Captain John Smith, who was among the English mercenaries hired by the Danes for the war against Sweden, became known for his role as the “Pirate of the Baltic”, raiding Swedish settlements for plunder and food. The so-called Smithsonian Pirates were notorious for their raids as far as Turku, Finland and even in Estonia and Livonia, where the port of Riga was raided on June 19th. As for the Russians’ part, the two islands of Hiiuma and Saaremaa were crucial in their control of the Baltic, and Dmitry I Pozharsky ordered its capture, along with all of Estonia and Livonia (including the city of Riga). However, he was about to receive help from an unlikely ally: the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nHapsburg Collapse and Reign of Sigismund Bathory:\n\nIn what became known as the Wilno Coup, a group of anti-Hapsburg Polish soldiers plotted to depose Archduke Maximillian and invite Sigismund Bathory in as the first hereditary King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. When news of the Commonwealth’s disastrous retreat from Russia reached Wilno on June 7th, 1612, they began their coup. At a session in the Polish Sjem the next day, Krzysztof Radziwill openly denounced Archduke Maximillian for violating the basic principles of the PLC’s Golden Freedom by demonstrating religious intolerance towards the Commonwealth’s Orthodox subjects. Furthermore, the massacres of Russian villagers during the Commonwealth’s march to Moscow had resulted in Russia’s hostility to the West and its thirst for revenge. After a unanimous vote in favor of Archduke Maximillian’s abdication, the Hapsburg King of Poland resigned in anger and subsequently returned back to Austria. Sigismund Bathory was invited by Polish nobles to take the throne of the PLC on June 12th, 1612 and launched a policy of rapprochement with Russia. In exchange for supporting Dmitry I Pozharsky’s war against the Swedes, King Sigismund III Bathory agreed to extradite Archduke Maximillian to Moscow, though that deal fell apart because of the Papal nuncio’s intervention. Nevertheless, Sigismund III Bathory agreed to send 51,000 Commonwealth troops in the conquest of the Baltic. In return for their participation, the PLC is to acquire western Livonia (including the port of Liepaja) while Russia would be entitled to get the rest. As compensation for what the Commonwealth forces had done in Russia during Archduke Maximillian’s reign, Sigismund III Bathory agreed to cede half of White Ruthenia to Russia. The question of Great Ruthenia would be decided after the war ended. Finally, Sigismund III Bathory agreed to aid Russia in the destruction of the Crimean Khanate.\n\nAn Uneasy Alliance:\n\nOn July 19th, 1612, Sigismund III Bathory sent 51,000 Commonwealth troops to aid the Russians in the conquest of the Baltic. For the first three years, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia fought together in numerous campaigns against the Kingdom of Sweden. Tsar Dmitry I Pozharsky in turn, had a score to settle with the Swedes, who for the most part, were being encircled in places like Dorpat, Koknese Castle and even Kircholm. Those same places where the Swedes had won their battles against the Commonwealth forces were now beginning to lose ground to a combined Russo-PLC coalition force. In August 6th, 1612, Koknese Castle was besieged by Russian troops commanded by Ataman Mikhail’s younger brother, Rostislav Yermakov. The first three weeks of the siege went well in the Swedes’ favor as Dmitry I Pozharsky constantly ordered several redeployments of Russian battalions to Dorpat and Kircholm. Such a decision proved to be costly, as the Russian forces in Koknese Castle were repelled and forced to retreat. Buoyed by their success in defeating the Russians, Swedish General Gyllenhielm was ordered by Wilhelm I Vasa to pursue the Russians back across the Estonian border. By August 17th, the Swedish Army arrived in Ivangorod and began to besiege the city. In addition, the Swedish Navy provided the extra firepower they needed to bring down the fortress, although the Russian Baltic Fleet stationed in nearby Mikhailodar sailed into Ivangorod and fought off the Swedish warships.\n\nAlthough Sigismund III Bathory was able to help the Russians by attacking the Swedes in the Siege of Liepaja on September 1st, 1612, the PLC was not a maritime power and had no way of helping their Russian allies in the Baltic. Luckily, the Russian court managed to hire John Smith and his three pirate ships in attacking Swedish settlements along the Swedish and Finnish coasts. Smith’s piracy"
