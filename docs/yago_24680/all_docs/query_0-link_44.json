        "text": "Ivan IV Vasilyevich (1530-1584), was the first of two children of Basil III and Elena Glinskaya. Ivan came into the world on August 25, 1530. Nearly a year after this Ivan's father died when he was only three. Basil had died due to a small, little pimple on his thigh that had developed into a deadly sore. Basil requested at his deathbed that his son Ivan would become the ruler of Russia when he became a man at age 15. Once Basil died the boyars took over Russia, denying Ivan's right to the throne. Ivan's mother then with other trusted boyars took over the ruling party. Elena was able to successfully rule Russia for four years, until she died suddenly in 1538, apparently from poisoning, leaving eight-year-old Ivan an orphan. They had ended and that Ivan had complete power. On Sunday, January 16, 1547, Ivan was crowned czar in Moscow's lavish Cathedral of the Assumption. Ivan soon married Anastasia Romanovna-Zakharyina-Yurueva. Anastasia bore him six children of whom only two survived infancy. At times Ivan was very devote; he used to throw himself before the icons, banging his head against the floor. It resulted in a callosity at his forehead. Once Ivan even did a public confession of his sins in Moscow.\n\nThe One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate is about Ivan, a silverback gorilla who is raised by a human and lives in captivity at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade. Ivan is brought to the Exit 8 after being captured and separated from his family while living in the wild. Ivan considers his new habitat a “domain” and refuses to admit that he is living in a cage. However, when Stella, an elephant, dies as a result of neglect, Ivan is forced to accept his situation. Moreover, he has to fight to keep the promise he made to save Ruby, a young elephant, from going down the same path as the rest of them. In her novel, The One and Only Ivan, Applegate uses characterization, setting, and plot to convey Ivan’s determination to become a protector.\n\nWorld leaders are leaders with high governmental power in the world. Every leader, not just world leaders, is either great or corrupt; they are rarely both. Most of Russia’s history is filled with corrupt leaders. Joseph was one of those leaders. Stalin killed millions of people during his rule. But Stalin also led the Soviet Union almost to the top in world power. Stalin had many influences that led him to his Soviet Leadership in which gave him many admirers but even more non-supporters.\n\nIvan the 5th, who is also heavily known as Ivan the Terrible was the first Tsar to rule over Russia. Ivan the Terrible, was known for his violent and ruthless outbreaks. He was feared greatly and this led to the fleeing of Prince Krubsky. Prince Krubsky was the leading general of the Tsar when he fled and deserted his lead for the Polish- Lithuanian forces in Livonia. Prince Krubsky who was also a member of the select council, did not want to adopt the dislike of Ivan the Terrible.\n\nTo begin, Maria Antonia Josepha Joanna’s early life was simple even though she was a princess who lived in a palace. Born in Vienna, Austria, on November 2nd in the year 1755 , Antoinette was one of the 11 children of Maria Theresa (The empress of Austria) and Francis I (The Holy Roman Emperor). In the 1765 Louis dauphin de France had suddenly died and his son Louis XVI had to marry Marie Antoinette because they were suppose to marry each other. Marie went to France to get married, and she was accompanied by 376 horses and 57 carriages and 117 footmen. Antoinette and her husband eventually had four children, her daughters Marie Thérèsa and Sophie Hélèn and her sons, Louis XVII and Louis Joseph.\n\nHow terrible was Ivan the Terrible? Fatih Yücel During the World War II, Joseph Stalin (1878-1953) commissioned famous director Sergei Eisenstein (1898-1848) who was the creator of movies such as Battleship Potemkin (1925), October (1928), and Alexander Nevsky (1938) to make a movie about Ivan IV, [Ivan the Terrible (Russian: Иван Грозный, Ivan Grozniy] the first Tsar of Russia, who ruled between 1547-1584. Stalin was known to identify himself with the ruler and he was much satisfied with the first part of the movie (1944) named Ivan the Terribe. Hence the first part of the movie which depicts the coronation of Ivan IV as Tsar, his marriage to Anastasia Romanovna, the Tsar’s sickness, the death of the Tsarina Anastasia, and Ivan’s embodiment of people support, was awarded the Stalin Prize; yet the second part which was named The Boyars’ Plot was banned by Stalin because it depicted the Tsar as a “mentally unstable” character in accordance with the origin of the name “Terrible”\n\nIn 1547 Ivan was crowned \"Tsar of all Tsars.\" It was also time for Ivan to take a wife. He held what was little more than a beauty contest amongst the noble women. Ivan was charmed by the beautiful Anastasia Romanovna, and married her soon after. It was against all odds a love match; there would be 13 years of happy marriage, although only two children would survive to adulthood.\n\nMost people, including myself, do not like to be told what to do by someone, such as my parents, teachers, or other classmates. Sometimes, I might do the opposite or just ignore them. My parents are constantly telling me to do the dishes or the laundry, and I never want to, I want to just ignore them and go do what I would rather do. Nicholas II was the ruler of Russia during the Russian Revolution in 1904. There was a few people in Russia that liked or looked up to him. Since he was not necessarily the best leader, the people did not like to listen to him, just like we do not want to listen to other people telling us what to do. Nicholas II was the main cause of the Russian Revolution. Nicholas II’s father, a past tsar, did not have a chance to\n\nIn many instances many people do not trust the tsar or tsarina judgment because of the presence of Rasputin. Rasputin becomes more of a nuisance to the royal family because he’s very uneducated and makes poor choices. His St. Petersburg apartment became a very busy office where he would take care of medical problems and with his healing powers. He let payment be paid in money, pledges of loyalty, or the most controversial “kisses.” This would have passed with no questions if at that time Russia were not entering a period of crisis of war. Nicholas was forced to grant the constitution and convene a parliament. Many loved and admired the tsar he was remarkably charming and just gave a special atmosphere to the people. Though during these times Nicholas’s greatest problems came from the moderate opposition. Liberals and moderate conservatives were alarmed over defeats. Nicholas refused to share power with the Duma. As time past in Russia tsar Nicholas and Alexandra became very unpopular with the people of Russia. By the early 1916 Alexandra was the most hated woman in Russia. Much popular opinion held that she was the leader of the dark forces that was driving the Russian nation to destruction."
