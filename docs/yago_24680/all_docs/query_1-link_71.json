        "text": "HISTORY\n\nBesides being the first Russian monarch to be crowned as Tsar (emperor or Casaer), Ivan IV Vasilyevich, otherwise known as Ivan The Terrible, was famous for being a fighter, a murderer, and a tyrant. But among all these admittedly terrible things, he was also a lover.\n\nIvan had eight wives, or “Tsaristas” as they were known, of whom two outlived him. Yet nearly all of them met unfortunate ends. Their demise, however, had little to do with the tsar’s fearsome title.\n\n1. Anastasia Romanova\n\nIn the Russian courts, nobles and aristocrats were known as “boyars.” Anastasia was the daughter of one such minor aristocrat and was born in 1530. Before being crowned Tsar, Ivan was the Grand Prince of Moscow and Russia."
