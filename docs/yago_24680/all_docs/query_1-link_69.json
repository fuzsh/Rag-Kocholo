        "text": "FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE A CASE OFLove’s Labour’s <strong>Lost</strong> Rima Greenhill ❦ There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown, To make theirs ours, and ours none but our own. The Princess: Love’s Labour’s <strong>Lost</strong> LTHOUGH not <strong>of</strong>ficially one <strong>of</strong> three so-called “problem plays,” Love’s Labour’s <strong>Lost</strong> is probably the least understood, liked, and performed play in the <strong>Shakespeare</strong> canon, due partly to its rambling, episodic nature and partly to its linguistic complexity. The density <strong>of</strong> plays on words, malapropisms, turns <strong>of</strong> speech, multiple meanings, and topical allusions is unusual even for a <strong>Shakespeare</strong>an play. <strong>Shakespeare</strong> scholars might have been more intrigued had they realized the extent to which Russian-English relations hold the key to its multi-layered refermmmmmmences to topical events and historical figures. The year 1553 marked the beginning <strong>of</strong> a relationship between England and Russia that was to be mutually pr<strong>of</strong>itable, frustrating, and occasionally comical. Prior to the 1550s, very few Westerners had any knowledge <strong>of</strong> Russian life. While trade with the countries <strong>of</strong> the Mediterranean had been going on for centuries, only a select few among the European nations had had dealings <strong>of</strong> any sort with distant Russia, among them merchants <strong>of</strong> the Hanseatic league, members <strong>of</strong> the German diplomatic service, and Italians, mainly Venetians, in the service <strong>of</strong> the Vatican. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries England was still a long way from “ruling the waves,” but her merchants were already seeking their own routes for the pr<strong>of</strong>itable spice trade with the East. In 1553, in an effort to find a north-east passage to China, three ships set forth under the command <strong>of</strong> Sir Hugh Willoughby, with Richard Chancellor as pilot general <strong>of</strong> the expedition. Chancellor, who provided the maps for the journey, was a protégé <strong>of</strong> John Dee, Elizabeth’s “oracle” and the mathematician/astronomer-astrologer/geographer under whom Chancellor trained as a navigator. Sadly, unaccustomed to the hardships <strong>of</strong> the northern climate, the ships became separated and both the Confidencia and the Esperanza, together with Willoughby and all his crew, perished when they were forced to winter on the desolate Scandinavian coast. Only the Bonaventura managed to survive. Having taken refuge in the White Sea, she ended up on the shores <strong>of</strong> Russia, or Muscovy, as it was then called. After attempting to send a message to the Tsar and getting no response, Chancellor went ahead and set out for Moscow, making the overland journey <strong>of</strong> over a thousand kilometers through the ice and snow <strong>of</strong> a Russian winter. 9"
