The last complete ballet to be choreographed by Martha Graham, the dance takes a sly look at the foibles of a contemporary choreographer (such as Graham herself) and gently mocks the plight of the artist in the throes of creation. With costumes by fashion designer Calvin Klein and a score featuring the music of Scott Joplin, the dance was immediately a favorite for Graham audiences. A ridiculous boomerang-shaped barre dominates the stage, the perfect prop for the cast of unruly characters that inhabit this ballet. Like figments of the imagination, these dancers enter and exit at will in a parody of movement themes drawn from classic Graham repertory.

In 1984, she decided to return to the score and create her own choreography for the Rite. The primal physical expression that is the hallmark of the Graham style has a deep connection with the primitive essences evoked in Stravinsky’s revolutionary score. The community in Graham’s Rite is defined through the complex, yet clear geometric patterns for the group that harken back to her ground-breaking works from the 1930s such as Primitive Mysteries and Dark Meadow. The organized structure for the group is a calm, somewhat disturbing, counterpoint to the violence of the story and vigorous physicality of the movement. Her choreography for the work, created over fifty years after she starred as the Chosen One for Massine, bookends her long creative career. Elements of her many theatrical innovations are distilled into this masterwork, one of her last.\n\nAPPALACHIAN SPRING\n\nChoreography and Costumes by Martha Graham\n\nMusic by Aaron Copland\n\nSet by Isamu Noguchi\n\nOriginal lighting by Jean Rosenthal, Adapted by Beverly Emmons\n\nPremiere: October 30, 1944, Coolidge Auditorium, Library of Congress, Washington, DC\n\nSpringtime in the wilderness is celebrated by a man and woman building a house with joy and love and prayer; by a revivalist and his followers in their shouts of exaltation; by a pioneering woman with her dreams of the Promised Land.\n\nThe Bride\n\nAnne Souder\n\nThe Husbandman\n\nJacob Larsen\n\nThe Preacher\n\nAlessio Crognale-Roberts\n\nThe Pioneering Woman\n\nLeslie Andrea Williams\n\nThe Followers\n\nSo Young An\n\nMeagan King\n\nDevin Loh\n\nMarzia Memoli\n\nCommissioned by the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation in the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe original title chosen by Aaron Copland was Ballet for Martha, which was changed by Martha Graham to Appalachian Spring.Used by arrangement with the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, copyright owners; and Boosey and Hawkes, Inc., sole publisher and licensee.\n\nIn 1942, Martha Graham received a commission from the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation for a new ballet to be premiered at the Library of Congress. Aaron Copland was to compose the score. Graham called the new dance Appalachian Spring, after a poem by Hart Crane, but for Copland it always remained “Ballet for Martha.” Choreographed as the war in Europe was drawing to end, it captured the imagination of Americans who were beginning to believe in a more prosperous future, a future in which men and women would be united again. With its simple tale of a new life in a new land, the dance embodied hope. Critics called Appalachian Spring “shining and joyous,” “a testimony to the simple fineness of the human spirit.” The ballet tells the story of a young couple and their wedding day; there is a Husbandman, his Bride, a Pioneering Woman, a Preacher, and his Followers.\n\nIn a letter to Aaron Copland, Graham wrote that she wanted the dance to be “a legend of American living, like a bone structure, the inner frame that holds together a people.” As Copland later recalled, “After Martha gave me this bare outline, I knew certain crucial things – that it had to do with the pioneer American spirit, with youth and spring, with optimism and hope. I thought about that in combination with the special quality of Martha’s own personality, her talents as a dancer, what she gave off and the basic simplicity of her art. Nobody else seems anything like Martha, and she’s unquestionably very American.” Themes from American folk culture can be found throughout the dance. Copland uses a Shaker tune, “Simple Gifts,” in the second half of his luminous score, while Graham’s choreography includes square dance patterns, skips and paddle turns and curtsies, even a grand right and left. The set by Isamu Noguchi features a Shaker rocking chair. Appalachian Spring is perhaps Martha Graham’s most optimistic ballet, yet it does contain a dark side. The fire and brimstone Preacher and his condemnation of earthly pleasures recalls the repressive weight of our Puritan heritage, while the solemn presence of the Pioneering Woman hints at the problems of raising families in remote and isolated communities. In this newly cleared land life was not simple, and Graham’s vision pays homage to that as well.\n\n– Ellen Graff\n\nTHE RITE OF SPRING\n\nChoreography by Martha Graham\n\nMusic by Igor Stravinsky†\n\nCostumes by Martha Graham and Halston\n\nNew Production Concept by Janet Eilber\n\nLighting by Solomon Weisbard\n\nPremiere: February 28, 1984, New York State Theater, New York City\n\nThe Chosen One: Marzia Memoli\n\nThe Shaman: Lloyd Knight\n\nSo Young An\n\nAne Arrieta\n\nLaurel Dalley Smith\n\nMeagan King\n\nDevin Loh\n\nAnne Souder\n\nLeslie Andrea Williams\n\nXin Ying\n\nAlessio Crognale-Roberts\n\nZachary Jeppsen\n\nJacob Larsen\n\nAntonio Leone\n\nJai Perez\n\nMatthew Spangler\n\nJustin Valentine\n\nRichard Villaverde\n\nCommissioned by Halston\n\n†Used by arrangement with Boosey & Hawkes, Inc., publisher and copyright owner.\n\nGraham’s connection to The Rite of Spring began in 1930 when she was propelled into international fame starring in the first American production of the work choreographed by Léonide Massine and conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

Her distinctive style, blending various genres and innovative aesthetics, has been recognized widely, establishing her as a significant figure in the music industry. Her high-profile collaborations with artists like The Weeknd, Kanye West, and A$AP Rocky have broadened her musical range and appeal, showcasing her ability to transcend conventional musical boundaries.\n\nBefore becoming a pioneering musical figure, twigs had a strong foundation in the performing arts as a classically trained ballet dancer and opera singer. This training has profoundly shaped her artistic expression, blending the precision of ballet and the expressive power of opera into her music career. Transitioning from dance to music, she has combined her diverse skills to create a distinctive sound and visual style that captivates audiences worldwide, reflecting her dedication to artistic innovation and pushing creative limits.\n\nThroughout her career, twigs has revitalized traditional movement forms like Voguing, Wushu, and Pole Dancing, integrating them into the mainstream and highlighting their cultural significance. Her classical training enriches her music and performances, making her work stand out in the contemporary pop scene. This blend of different artistic elements has defined her as a trailblazer in the arts, continually challenging and reshaping the creative landscape with her unique vision and talent.\n\nFKA twigs has also ventured into acting, gaining praise for her role in “Honey Boy” and taking on the female lead in the upcoming Lionsgate film “The Crow,” showcasing her versatile talent in the cinematic arena\n\nRhiannon Giddens has made a singular, iconic career out of stretching her brand of folk music, with its miles-deep historical roots and contemporary sensibilities, into just about every field imaginable. A two-time GRAMMY Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning singer and instrumentalist, MacArthur “Genius” grant recipient, and composer of opera, ballet, and film, Giddens has centered her work around the mission of lifting up people whose contributions to American musical history have previously been overlooked or erased, and advocating for a more accurate understanding of the country’s musical origins through art.\n\nAs Pitchfork once said, “few artists are so fearless and so ravenous in their exploration”—a journey that has led to NPR naming her one of its 25 Most Influential Women Musicians of the 21st Century and to American Songwriter calling her “one of the most important musical minds currently walking the planet.”\n\nGiddens also is exploring other mediums and creative possibilities just as actively as she has American musical history. With 1858 replica minstrel banjo in hand, she wrote the opera Omar with film composer Michael Abels (Get Out, Us, Nope) which received the 2023 Pulitzer Prize in Music, and, with her partner Francesco Turrisi, she wrote and performed the music for Black Lucy and the Bard, which was recorded for PBS’ Great Performances; she has appeared on the ABC hit drama Nashville and throughout Ken Burns’ Country Music series, also on PBS.\n\nGiddens has published children’s books and written and performed music for the soundtrack of Red Dead Redemption II, one of the best-selling video games of all time. She sang for the Obamas at the White House; is a three-time NPR Tiny Desk Concert alum; and hosts her own show on PBS, My Music with Rhiannon Giddens, as well as the Aria Code podcast, which is produced by New York City’s NPR affiliate station WQXR.\n\n“I’ve been able to create a lot of different things around stories that are difficult to tell, and managed to get them done in a way that’s gotten noticed,” as Giddens puts it. “I know who to collaborate with, and it has gotten me into all sorts of corners that I would have never expected when I started doing this.”\n\nJamar Roberts was the Resident Choreographer of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater from 2017-2022.
