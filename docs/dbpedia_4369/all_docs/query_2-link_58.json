As Turner points out, reducing history to impersonal causes gives rise to “a deterministic version of the past that lends a spurious air of high probability to what happened and blots out the effects of contingency that spring from immediate circumstances and individual choices” (p. 305). Lebow (fn. 59) argues that affected by this “certainty of hindsight bias,” structural explanations “fail to recognize the uncertainty under which actors operated and the possibility that they could have made different choices that might have led to different outcomes” (p. 559).
