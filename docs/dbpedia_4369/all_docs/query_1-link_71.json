        "text": "\"I’ve never been more excited about what we bring to the table to solve the issues we face today—the notion of equity.”\n\nTodd is proudly unconventional. His constant quest for innovation is aimed squarely at solving clients’ problems, reaching their goals, and elevating people’s everyday experience. Todd and his teams excel at complex projects where there aren’t obvious solutions. His extensive work in interiors has been widely celebrated, likely because he simply views interiors as architecture. Todd’s refusal to separate work into silos—his openness to new ways of thinking—is a hallmark of STUDIOS’ approach. Through decades of experience, he continues to feel incredibly fortunate to be able to come to work and imagine the best possible design that he can imagine for each and every client.\n\nTodd's depth of experience has made him a national voice for great design, being recognized and having work published across The New York Times, WIRED Magazine, Business Week and Architectural Record. As an acknowledged leader and proponent for the transformative power of design, Todd serves on the Executive Committee for the New York Restoration Project where he underwrote the regeneration of a garden in the Bronx, as well as on the Federal City Council where he led the master planning effort to revive the Carver Langston neighborhoods in Washington, DC. He is also a Trustee of the University of Cincinnati Foundation, the Museum of the City of New York, and the National Building Museum. Todd’s longtime belief in working in partnership with people from diverse backgrounds to innovate in design has been recognized by his induction into the Interior Design Hall of Fame and by his Fellowship in the AIA.\n\nAfter 35 years with STUDIOS, David retired as of April 2020. He is now spending his time relaxing and growing wine grapes. David was the firm's first employee and went on to direct the design and management of some of our most significant projects.\n\nDavid's work includes interiors, new buildings, and often whole new campuses for notable clients including Google, Apple, and LinkedIn. He built long-term relationships with building owners and real estate developers, which led to a series of campus planning and design projects across Silicon Valley. David also worked closely with UC Berkeley on a number of interiors, renovation, and new building projects for engineering, physics, natural sciences, and other programs.\n\nHe also served on various Design Review Committees over the years, most recently for the Cities of Mountain View and Cupertino.\n\n“I like challenging people to look at things differently—it facilitates lots of different responses. Testing early on helps push things in different directions. Our work is expressive and design first, but we’re also solving problems and overcoming limits.”\n\nDavid is a creative problem solver with vision. He believes that there is always a new and different way to look at a challenge. While exploring solutions from any and all angles, he constantly draws, evaluates, re-evaluates, and is even known to create verbal mantras that keep him and his teams focused on what matters: the end goal. David asks a lot of questions. What are the drivers of the project? How can we simplify what the team is solving for? How can we overcome perceived limits? His dedication and curiosity open up new ways forward.\n\nDavid’s career started in STUDIOS’ Paris office more than 20 years ago. Since then, he has played an integral role in designing several of our most complex and award-winning projects, from giving new life to landmarked 200 Fifth Avenue to stitching together community at Canal Park. His diverse design and leadership experience spans large-scale base-building, master planning, interiors, and renovations for a wide range of clients in the commercial, education, civic, and cultural spheres. Across the board, David challenges the status quo, elevates clients’ missions, and seeks to measurably improve lives and communities.\n\n“I get excited about clients who are interested in change and being sensitive to the employee experience in a changing workplace. I want to solve the challenges together.”\n\nInterpreter, guide, connector. Whether jumping in to sketch an idea or manage highly complex projects, Josh is driven to empower others. He loves teaming up with creative people and finding ways to push everyone along—building community, keeping communication open, and crafting the group dynamic. For Josh, intensive listening is essential to the design process and side-by-side conversations with clients drive solutions. Never passive and always adaptable to changing goals and deliverables, he proactively pursues the right success on every project. Josh believes that real curiosity, about clients and their goals, creates better design.\n\nHaving led designs for non-profit, education, tech, law, finance, media, and other commercial clients, Josh's career encompasses a wide range of industries, services, and perspectives. This breadth of experience gives him an in-depth understanding of how multi-faceted projects are successfully orchestrated, resulting in timeless and responsive designs for ever-changing environments.\n\n“My cultural heritage—French, Greek, born in Turkey—gave me an interest in bridging gaps, getting different groups to work together. I enjoy going to a country where I’ve never worked. How do we do it here? How do I adapt, survive, and deliver? I'm not interested in recipes. I’m interested in discovery. Swimming in unknown waters. That is how I get my kicks.”\n\nPierre loves people—seeing them grow, bringing them together in teams, and leveraging everyone’s talents. He views every project, just like every person, as totally unique. Thinking of STUDIOS approach as haute couture, or “design to suit,” Pierre’s work always culminates in a special and thoughtful solution, carved to fit just right. Inspired by Le Corbusier, Felix Candela and Luis Barragan’s pragmatic poetry, he focuses on blending buildings into their environment while showing respect for the people who experience and use the space.\n\nAs Founding Partner of the STUDIOS Paris office, Pierre has directed and overseen a multitude of projects throughout France, Europe and the Middle East that include site search, strategic and master planning, design and construction.\n\nWith over 30 years of experience guiding corporate clients through complex projects, his strong leadership skills and ability to cultivate successful long-term relationships have been instrumental in the success of STUDIOS Paris. He is integrally involved in all of his projects from conceptual design through final construction.\n\nPierre is fluent in French, English and Greek.\n\n“I’m proud of our people, more than any individual project we’ve done.
