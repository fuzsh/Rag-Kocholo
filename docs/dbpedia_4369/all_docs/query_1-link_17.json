        "text": "Robert Francis 'Bobcat' Goldthwait, born May 26, 1962, is an American comedian, writer, producer, director, and star of films and television shows. He is most widely known for his at times screechy voice and scattergun delivery during his standup comedy performances and some film roles.\n\nHe was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, the son of Kathleen Ann (Welch), a department store employee, and Thomas Lincoln Goldthwait, a sheet metal worker. His family, of Irish, German, and English descent, was Catholic. He decided on a career as a comedian at an early age and was performing professionally while still in high school at the age of fifteen. He and his classmate, Tom Kenny, performed in a comedy duo, billing themselves as \"Bobcat and Tomcat\". Goldthwait became recognized as a solo stand-up comedian and had three televised concert specials in The 1980s: Bob Goldthwait - Is He Like That All the Time?, An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait: Share the Warmth (1987) and Meat Bob.\n\nGoldthwait's first major film role was in Police Academy 2 - Jetzt geht's erst richtig los (1985). He reprised the role in the next two films in the series. During the fall of 1993, Goldthwait did stand-up material as an opening act for Nirvana on what would be their final North American tour. He has made several guest appearances on talk shows as well as comedy programs including The Ben Stiller Show (1992). On May 9, 1994, he made a controversial appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992), where, on impulse, he set a couch on fire. This incident was then the basis of the plot for his subsequent appearance on Die Larry Sanders Show (1992).\n\nOne of the most recognizable features of Goldthwait's performances is his voice. Goldthwait has voiced characters on the television series Mäuse an der Macht (1992); The Moxy Show (1995); Auf schlimmer und ewig (1995); Hercules (1998) and Captain Buzz Lightyear (2000). He has also appeared, as himself, hosting the comedy quiz show Bobcat's Big Ass Show (1998). Goldthwait has released two comedy albums: \"Meat Bob\" (1988) on Chrysalis Records and \"I Don't Mean to Insult You, but You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait\" (23 September, 2003) on Comedy Central Records.\n\nHe made his feature film directorial debut with Clowns - Ihr Lachen bringt den Tod (1991), which he wrote and starred in as well. His film, Windy City Heat (2003), won a Comedia Award for Best Comedy Film at Montreal's Just for Laughs Film Festival in 2004.\n\nBobcat began directing ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! (2003) in the fall 2004 season. Since joining the show's crew, the ratings went up to 2 million viewers a night, with the numbers rising nearly 50% with the teenage demographic. In May of 2006, he left to pursue his film career as a filmmaker/director but has since returned to the show. Goldthwait's feature, \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" (formally Stay (2006)), starring Melinda Page Hamilton, was in the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and it was part of the \"Independent Dramatic Features\" competition. \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" is about a youthful, impulsive sexual encounter which opens the door to a dark comedy about the complexities of honesty. It was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the \"Dramatic Features\" category. \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" was picked up in a mid-six figure deal for distribution in north America by Roadside Attractions & Samuel Goldwyn Films at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. A French film company called \"Gaumont\" bought it for the international rights to the film in France. \"Tartan Films\", a UK-based production company, also bought it for international rights in the United Kingdom. The film was released in the US on October 20, 2006.\n\nHe married Ann Luly in 1986 at the age of 24. The couple have two children (now grown), Tasha and Taylor, and divorced in May 1998. At one time, Goldthwait was engaged to his Auf schlimmer und ewig (1995) co-star, Nikki Cox, but the couple split.\n\nAmerican stage, screen and television actress, and comedian Carol Kane (b. Carolyn Laurie Kane, June 18, 1952, in Cleveland, Ohio), was born to Elaine Joy (née Fetterman), a jazz singer and pianist, and Michael Myron Kane, an architect. Her family is Jewish (from Russia, Poland, and Austria). Due to her parents' divorce, Carol spent most of her childhood in boarding schools until 1965. She also attended Professional Children's School in Upper West Side New York, and made her professional theater debut in a 1966 production of Die besten Jahre der Miss Jean Brodie (1969) starring Tammy Grimes. Kane, just 14 years old.\n\nAt 20 years old, Kane landed the lead role in William Fruets World War II film, Wedding in White (1972). Kane starred as Jeannie Dougall, a teenager whom after is raped is left with a moral dilemma when she discovers that the incident has left her pregnant. The actress received a surprise Academy Award nomination for her performance in the 1974 independent film, Hester Street (1975); Times of Israel describes Kane's character, Gitl, as \"a straight-from-the-shtetl immigrant who, with her young son, joins her husband (Steven Keats) who is already halfway assimilated in New York's Lower East Side; the push and the pull between tradition and change drive the story to its bittersweet conclusion.\"\n\nThe following decade, from 1980-1983, she appeared on the television series Taxi (1978). Kane portrayed Simka Dahblitz-Gravas, wife of Latka Gravas (Andy Kaufman). She received two Emmy Awards, and a Golden Globe nomination for her work in the series. Over the years, Kane racked up tons of credits from Taxi and Die Braut des Prinzen (1987), to Die Geister die ich rief... (1988), and more recently, the Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (2015); the actress is making audiences laugh by playing Lillian Kaushtupper, in a recent interview, Kane described Lillian as \"a hardworking landlady in Harlem who is very attached to the life in New York as she's known it.\"\n\nRobert Gerard Goulet was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to a family of French-Canadian origin. He was the son of Jeanette (Gauthier) and Joseph Georges André Goulet. After hearing his son sing \"Lead Kindly Light\", in their church hall, his father told him, \"I'm proud of you, son\". A few weeks later, his father, lying on his death bed, called Robert to his side and told him the Lord had given him a beautiful voice and he must go and sing. His father died when Robert was 13 and he moved to Edmonton, Canada, a year later. Goulet won a singing scholarship to the Royal Conservatory of music in Toronto and, in 1951, made his concert debut at Edmonton in George Frideric Handel's \"Messiah\". Goulet was also a DJ on Canada's CKUA in Edmonton for two years. In 1960, he landed one of his biggest roles as \"Lancelot\" in Broadway's \"Camelot\", opposite Richard Burton and Julie Andrews. He received a Tony award in 1968 for his role in \"Happy Time\". He and his first wife, Louise Longmore, had one daughter, Nicolette Goulet (aka Nikki). His second wife, actress and singer Carol Lawrence, produced two sons, Christopher and Michael. In 1982, with Glenn Ford giving the bride away, he was married in Las Vegas to Vera Goulet (aka Vera Novak), a Yugoslavian-born writer, photographer and artist. When not living at their home in Las Vegas, they reside on their yacht, \"Rogo\", in Los Angeles. Goulet has performed at the White House for three presidents, as well as a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nOn September 30, 2007, he was hospitalized in Las Vegas, where he was diagnosed with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, \"a rare but rapidly progressive and potentially fatal condition\". On October 13, he was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after it was determined that he \"would not survive without an emergency lung transplant\".\n\nGoulet died on October 30, 2007 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, while awaiting a transplant.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Vera Goulet, and three children, sons Christopher and Michael, and daughter Nicolette Goulet, who is the mother of his grandchildren, Jordan Gerard and Solange.\n\nBrooklyn-born Buddy Hackett was known mainly as a nightclub comic, especially in Las Vegas, where he first performed in 1952 and wound up being one of the biggest headliners in that city's history. Hackett always referred to himself as a \"saloon comic\" and preferred the intimacy of his stage act--where he would often bring members of the audience up on stage with him--to films and television. He, along with Lenny Bruce, pioneered \"blue\" comedy, although Hackett's career did not suffer nearly as much as Bruce's did because of it. Hackett's act was noted for its, at the time, \"adult\" content, and at one point he was sued by a woman who attended one of his shows and said she was \"shocked and offended\" at the language (she lost the suit). However, contrary to his nightclub image, Hackett's appearances in films were mostly of the family type, such as his roles in the \"Herbie\" series of comedies for Disney about a Volkswagen Bug with a mind of its own and as Robert Preston's sidekick in Music Man (1962). In 1954, Hackett was paired by Universal Pictures with Hugh O'Brian as a potential comedy team to replace the studio's reigning team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, They actually did replace the famous team in the film Fireman Save My Child (1954), due to Costello's illness (Bud and Lou can still be glimpsed in long shots). Hackett took the part that Costello was playing (an eerie coincidence considering that more than 20 years later he would actually play Costello in the movie Bud and Lou (1978)) and O'Brian took Abbott's place, but the film was not successful and Universal dropped its plans to make a team out of the two. Hackett also had a showy part in the ensemble comedy Eine total, total verrückte Welt (1963), partnered with Mickey Rooney. However, despite his success in movies, he still preferred his nightclub work and played Las Vegas and clubs in other cities whenever possible. He had a reputation among his fellow comics as a brilliant ad-libber and someone who knew exactly how far to take a joke before it ran its course, something not all comedians managed to do.\n\nBuddy Hackett died at age 78 of natural causes at his beach house in Malibu, CA, on June 30, 2003.\n\nThe actress Wendie Malick was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1950 and attended Ohio Wesleyan University, from which she graduated in 1972. The 5-foot, 10-inch beauty was a Wilhelmina model in the 1970s, giving it up to go to work for Buffalo-area Congressman Jack Kemp. She quickly left Washington, DC, behind to act in the theater.\n\nShe appeared as Judith Tupper Stone in the early 1990s on the HBO comedy Dream On (1990) for which she won four CableACE Awards as Best Actress in a Comedy Series. Malick has proved a gifted comedienne with great comic timing and reached the height of her career as one of the stars of the sitcom Just Shoot Me - Redaktion durchgeknipst (1997). Malick was hilarious as the beautiful fashion editor Nina Van Horn, a neurotic and pretentious ex-model struggling with middle age. For her work on the series, Malick won a Golden Globe and two Emmy Award nominations as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nOn television, she has also had regular roles in the series Trauma Center (1983) and Good Company (1996) and recurring roles on New York Cops: NYPD Blue (1993), Alles außer Liebe (1989), Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989), Kate & Allie (1984), and Frasier (1993). She also starred in several made-for-TV movies, including Paper Dolls (1982), Dynasty: The Reunion (1991) and Erfolg um jeden Preis (1997). She also starred in North Shore Fish (1997) on cable TV, based on a role which she originated on stage. Malick's work has included roles in the movies Hallo, Mr. President (1995), Die Geister die ich rief... (1988), and Bugsy (1991). With her distinctive voice, she is in high demand for voice-over work.\n\nAmy Hill's television and film credits number over 180. As a voice actor, she's been heard as recurring characters on numerous shows including \"American Dad\", \"Lilo and Stitch\" (film and series), \"King of the Hill\", and HBO's \"Happily Ever After.\" She had recurring roles on \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\", \"UnReal\", \"Preacher\", and the CBS sitcom \"Mom\".
