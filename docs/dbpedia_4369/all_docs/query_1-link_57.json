So, naturally, I am at home with and interested in different cultures. As an adult, I have lived briefly in India and for the most part in the United States and Canada. Toronto happens to be one of my favorite cities in the world! I have a passion for the design arts; I particularly love the textures and colors of fabric in interior design and fashion design. I believe in healthful eating and working out as ways to be in sync with nature. I love listening to the Blues (B. B. King, of course, is a favorite.) and reading Latin American literature, and I enjoy skiing in the winter and watching movies on Friday evenings. (I prefer my books and movies to have won awards.) I am married and we have one son.\n\nAcademic\n\nI received my Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of Alabama. My prior work experience includes teaching at Wayne State University and research contributions in world-class research centers at the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. My publications, among others, include peer-reviewed articles in Informatics for Health and Social Care and Information Research. My research interests are in mHealth, consumer health informatics, information needs of vulnerable patient populations, clinical decision support systems, and healthcare data analytics.\n\nAt NKU, I have taught graduate and undergraduate courses in healthcare operations and health informatics. I enjoy working with undergraduate students and appreciate the energy and enthusiasm they bring to learning.\n\nSusan Brudvig, Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nDirector, MS in Business Informatics\n\nGH 540\n\n859-572-7934\n\nbrudvigs1@nku.edu\n\nBio\n\nPersonal\n\nMy name is Susan Brudvig. I am a Wisconsin native who enjoys the more moderate temperatures and 4-season climate of this region. I joined NKU in Fall 2019. Prior to that, I was an Associate Professor as IU East and an Assistant Professor at Ball State University. I have been teaching full-time for more than a dozen years. Prior to top that, I was employed in business analysis in various professional capacities, most recently at Eli Lilly where I had global responsibility for neuroscience market forecasting. Forecasting is one of my professional specialties, and I continue to hone my skill as an enrollment consultant to school districts and educational services companies. Something unique about myself ... My top speed is over 180 mph in the two-seat IndyCar at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. I'm a motorsports fan, and I enjoy it ... but as a spectator. So, if I talk about racing, I probably am referring to cars, not horses. I also am a football fan and have been lucky enough to participate in 2 Super Bowls ... as a member of the half-time stage crew where I supported in-house audio.\n\nAcademic\n\nIn the College of Informatics, my teaching focus in Business Analytics. My research interest is in the use & application of analytics to business and teaching problems. I have most recently published in the Journal of Marketing Analytics, Communications in Statistics â Theory and Methods, and the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. I currently am engaged in several on-going research projects with colleagues from other universities. I earned my PhD from Florida State University and my MBA from Purdue University (2003). I was a first-gen student who earned my first degree from UW-Parkside, which is a regional state institution much like NKU.\n\nAnkur Chattopadhyay, Ph.

I was, and still am, curious about almost everything including music, art, history, philosophy, and technology. I was lucky to witness how small and local companies can become one of the largest and most advanced world-class companies. I also could witness how one of the poorest countries can be transformed into an advanced and (relatively) rich country. To understand why I came to the USA in 2005 because I could sense that the USA is one of the main powers behind the secret. I enjoy the second part of my life in the USA. Â Â\n\nAcademic Â\n\nI have two bios, one is âreal but fakeâ and the other is âfake but realâ.\n\nI graduated from Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea with a BS degree, cum laude, in Electrical Engineering. I traded my summa cum laude with a 1000 page programming book that I wrote when I graduated. After coming to the USA, I could earn my MS degree (Electronic Design Automation) from the University of California at Berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Ultimately, after returning to academiaÂ from software industry, I could earn my PhD degree (Software Engineering and Systems) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. My main research is software engineering, specifically application of software engineering to solve real world problems including Pervasive Computing and Internet of Things. I believe software engineering tools, methodologies, philosophies, design approaches, systems thinking, and processes can be used to to solve broader types of problems outside software developmentâindividual, team, and even country development. Â\n\nThis is a real bio in the sense that I can show you some nice papers that have the names of institutions that I described above. I also can show you the real academic papers and programming books that I have written so far. However, I call this fake because I believe engineering, especially software engineering, is about making products not earning papers. Â\n\nI was hooked right away when I first learned about programming in my freshman year. I was so fascinated about programming that I decided to learn everything about computers whatever that might be. This led to my co-founding a startup company, with great colleagues, where I developed virtually all kinds of software including web, desktop, embedded, and VHDL. Our product received the Presidential Award to show that even a small team can change the world a little bit. Furthermore, as a by-product, I could learn various software engineering theories and implementation skills. Later, I worked for a company that develops world-class software products, where I learned another aspect of software engineeringâprocesses and control. Luckily in there, my idea was selected as one of the top features of the year. I was also lucky enough to be involved in many types of research software engineering tools including Eclipse, EDA tools, SAT solvers, and most importantly my own invention âChitChatâ that was awarded the best paper from one of the top conferences. Â\n\nThis is a fake bio in the sense that these results are just by-products of my fulfilling curiosity and understanding the world. However, I call this real because I believe these are the proof that I love programming and everything about computers, and I think my proof is by making real-world products that people use. Â\n\nI always feel excited when I think how great things that NKU students can achieve \"when they understand their potential, and they decide to realize their potential to the limit.\" I believe my job is to help them to understand and realize, and make ready for their great journey.

I am currently working on a Master in Computer Science. I have worked in IT for over 20 years with the majority being at Chase College of Law. Once I completed my Masters I began adjuncting at the NKU COI department and in March 2019 I accepted the position of Lecturer/Lab Manager.\n\nI find teaching to be very rewarding and way to give something back to students from what I learned from completing my Masters. I enjoy time in the classroom and find that I am always learning something from the students.\n\nSome areas of interest are Cloud Computer, IOT, and networking. I have spent the last few years enhancing my coding skills as scripting and automation have become more popular. I am very fascinated by the small IOT devices that are capable of running Linux and networking.\n\nÂ"
