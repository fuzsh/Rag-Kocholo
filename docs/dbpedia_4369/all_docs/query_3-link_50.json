Substantive projects outside of the department may qualify. 1 credit = 42 service hours; 2 credits = 84 service hours. Three credits are required of all BFA visual arts majors; 2 credits are required of all BA art majors. Design majors do not complete VAP. Students must register for the course to earn academic credit.\n\nBA credits — by arrangement\n\n07:081:121 Drawing Fundamentals\n\nDrawing Fundamentals\n\nCourse Number: 07:081:121\n\nCourse Format: Lab/Studio\n\nMode of Instruction: Face-to-Face\n\nThis introductory course is designed to familiarize the student with the basic principles of drawing. Students are taught to see the three-dimensional world around them and to capture what they are perceiving in two-dimensions. Projects are designed to increase the student’s technical and perceptual ability within a variety of drawing-based approaches. The first half of the semester focuses on the use of line to address composition, creating space, perspective, accuracy in “seeing,” and mastery of materials such as pencil and charcoal. The second half of the semester focuses on the use of value, gesture, and mark-making to address similar formal and structural components with pen and ink. Critiques and discussions address both the formal and conceptual aspects of drawing such as ideation, subject, meaning, context, intentionality, and alternate readings of the work, among others. Art historical and contemporary art examples will be introduced throughout the course, and it is expected that students make at least one trip to New York City during the semester to explore contemporary galleries and attend three visiting artist lectures.\n\n4 credits\n\nCourse Prerequisites: None\n\nCourse Corequisites: None\n\nLearning Goals of Course: Students will demonstrate in a final portfolio mastery of the fundamental skills of observational drawing including: accuracy in perceptual ability; a sensitivity to line; an understanding of compositional strategies; a working knowledge of one and two point perspective; and a sensitivity to value (wide tonal range), gesture, and mark-making. Students will possess the ability to incorporate these into successful compositional strategies; and demonstrate how volume and space can be achieved through a variety of approaches. They will master the materials of pencil, charcoal, and pen and ink, and possess the skills to work with equal facility in line and value. In addition, they will develop a working vocabulary with which to assess their own drawing-based work, the work of their peers, and how the fundamental lessons of drawing can be applied to all visual art.\n\nFaculty Contact:\n\nCheon Pyo Lee, cl1828@mgsa.rutgers.edu\n\n07:081:122 4-D Fundamentals\n\n4-D Fundamentals: Time and Space\n\nCourse Number: 07:081:122\n\nWorking with the computer and with everyday technologies including smart phones, the internet, cameras, and audio recording devices, students learn fundamentals of time- and screen-based contemporary art practices. The class introduces students to a range of experimental techniques and approaches, working with photomontage, image sequencing, video recording and editing, and sound. The class includes screenings, demos, workshops, labs, readings, group discussions, and critiques. Students will develop their own creative and independent voices while working on a series of focused assignments.

Ideas of fracture, montage, image/object, process and environment will all be explored as students develop their own vocabulary and studio practice. Historical models, relevant texts, and contemporary artists will be examined, research, special projects and group and individual critiques are an integral part of the course.\n\n4 credits\n\nCourse Prerequisites and Corequisites: 07:081:121\n\nLearning Goals of Course:\n\nStudents will demonstrate through critique and discussion an ability to articulate how collage functions in their own work and the work of others\n\nStudents will demonstrate an understanding of the meaning and function of both historical and contemporary uses of collage in critiques, discussions and in development of their own works\n\nStudents will demonstrate, through A final portfolio their development of the practical, hands-on craft/mechanics/skills of collage\n\nStudents will demonstrate through A final portfolio an understanding and successful utilization of the conceptual aspects of collage in terms of fracture, synthesis, montage and sequence as well as its history as A radical act\n\nFaculty Contact:\n\nJulie Langsam, jlangsam@mgsa.rutgers.edu\n\n07:081:222 Drawing I-B\n\nDrawing I-B\n\nCourse Number: 07:081:222\n\nCourse Prerequisites: 07:081:121 or permission of instructor\n\nHow does color affect us? How does it function? How do we use it to convey information, create a mood or temperament, organize relationships? How has the use and ‘reading’ of color changed over time? What is a contemporary, 21st century approach to color? This course introduces the use of color into the drawing practice. While drawing is most often taught as a series of value and/or mark-making relationships, this course will introduce tools and materials that facilitate an approach to using color that goes beyond the simple differentiation of form. Using a variety of methods and materials to introduce color into the drawing process, students will experiment with oil pastel, watercolor, colored pencil and found color material (collage) to explore how color affects the meaning and reading of a work of art. Assignments, readings, presentations, and screenings will all examine color from various viewpoints including (but not limited to) historical, conceptual, psychological, cultural, and ethnographic ideas related to color and its use in the drawing practice.\n\n4 credits\n\nLearning Goals & Objectives:\n\nThrough practice, experimentation, research, and the use of various media, students will demonstrate the ability to:\n\nUtilize color effectively in the drawing process\n\nDemonstrate through a final portfolio an understanding of the use of color as both a formal and conceptual tool\n\nDemonstrate through critique and discussion an ability to articulate how specific practices integrate the conceptual, material and formal aspects of color including historical, psychological, cultural and ethnographic ideas related to color and its use in the drawing practice\n\nFaculty Contact:\n\nJulie Langsam, jlangsam@mgsa.rutgers.edu\n\n07:081:227 Visual Thinking A\n\nVisual Thinking A: Black and White\n\nCourse Number: 07:081:227\n\nCourse Format: Lab/Studio\n\nMode of Instruction: Face-to-Face\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the basic principles of “visual thinking”, or the basic formal and conceptual aspects of visual art and design which address issues related to visual culture, history, image/object, representation, and artistic intentionality. Projects are designed to increase the students’ technical and conceptual ability within a variety of visual arts mediums and approaches. Critiques and discussions play a crucial role in the course in analyzing work and art historical and contemporary art examples are introduced throughout. Students are expected to make at least one trip to NYC during the semester to tour contemporary galleries.\n\n4 credits\n\nCourse Prerequisites and Corequisites: None\n\nLearning Goals of Course:\n\nUpon completion of the course students will be able to:\n\nTransform ideas and materials from one form into another\n\nDemonstrate and document the process of making from ideation and concept to final execution\n\nConvey time and motion\n\nConduct artistic research\n\nUtilize a variety of formal design strategies such as figure/ground; sequence and narrative; symmetry/asymmetry; modularity; gestalt theory, etc. with respect to their effects\n\nAnalyze, critique, and interpret their own work, and the work of others.\n\nFaculty Contact:\n\nCheon pyo Lee, cl1828@mgsa.rutgers.edu\n\n07:081:228 Visual Thinking B\n\nVisual Thinking B: Color\n\nCourse Number: 07:081:228\n\nCourse Format: Lab/Studio\n\nMode of Instruction: Face-to-Face\n\nThis course builds on all of the principles of Visual Thinking I-A to explore the basic principles of color that address issues related to its physical properties, scientific principles, practical application, cultural implications, and concepts of color “theory.”\n\n4 credits\n\nCourse Prerequisites: None\n\nCourse Corequisites: None\n\nLearning Goals of Course:\n\nStudents should be able to demonstrate through a final portfolio that they have a basic, fundamental working knowledge of formalist design principles and basic compositional strategies in two and three dimensions as they pertain to color.

These are intended to be informative with an emphasis on community and conversation and foster an exchange of ideas between all participants. There are many ways to be in community with each other and all of these are considered.\n\nParticipation in critique sessions: As projects are completed, we will discuss all the work as a group in a critique. Critiques sessions are not intended as forums for demeaning criticism, instead they are to assist you in your creative development by providing focused opportunities for you to verbalize your intentions and process, and for fellow classmates and instructors to share opinions and assistance. Critiques in a studio class take the place of exams and quizzes in a lecture course. A critique is an opportunity to learn from the work of other students, who are working through the same questions that you are. Even if your project didn’t come out how you hoped it would, bring your best attempt, but don’t stay home. Your presence and willingness to give feedback to other students is just as important as your own work, and is part of your participation grade.\n\nClasswork/Homework Projects: Plan for a MINIMUM of 1 hour of homework for every 1 hour of class time. This means that a three hour class requires three hours of homework, i.e. 6 hours minimum of homework a week. Each assignment will be graded. If you do not like your grade, you may rework the assignment and turn it in again for online critique. Your willingness and effort to continually rework assignments will be positively reflected in your grade. I encourage you to resubmit assignments, but it is important that you bring the homework on time the day it is due for critique. If you improve your work because of feedback and decide to resubmit, you may receive an improved grade. But, late assignments will be penalized a letter grade. The highest possible grade for a late assignment is a B.\n\nCRAFT COUNTS!\n\nGood craft helps make color effects more visible. Poor craft detracts from the ability to see color relationships and effects. Even good color choices with poor craft will not produce a successful project.\n\nCraft for color-aid projects: Accurate measuring, attention to proportion and format of color squares. Straight edges, attention to borders, paper glued down flat, no visible rubber cement. The pickup eraser is your friend!\n\nCraft for gouache projects: Accurate measuring, evenly applied opaque color, attention to edges and borders between colors.\n\nAll aspects of a work will be critiqued. Take well-lit, no distraction, quality photographs of your work.\n\nAttendance:\n\nYou are responsible for any information, assignments, etc. that you have missed while being absent. If you miss a series of classes because of illness, you must have a letter from a doctor. If you have to miss a class and know this in advance, please notify the instructor. Attendance will be taken regularly. If you are late twice, you will be assigned an absence. If you are 30 minutes late to class or depart 30 minutes late before class ends, you will receive an absence. In most cases, three unexcused absences will result in a failing grade. The online absence notification option is not an excused absence and will not be viewed as such; you still must contact me directly with the reason for your absence.\n\n*Attendance is critical and active participation is required.\n\nYou are expected to be present in class, every single class. Why? Because above all, this class is a community. You will support each other when you need help, take risks with your work together, and provide critical feedback to help each other grow. You demonstrate your commitment to our community—to me and to your classmates—by showing up, on time, ready for class, every time. (Leaving class early, showing up late, or leaving in the middle of class to handle non-class related business is disruptive and counts as an absence).\n\nWhat does it mean to be present? It means to be prepared, with your assignments complete before class begins. It means to be mentally and physically alert and ready to spend an entire day learning alongside your classmates and helping your classmates learn.\n\nSometimes things come up: illness, traffic, childcare or family care, work for other classes, and other emergencies can affect your ability to be present.\n\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, three absences results in a failing grade.\n\nFaculty Contact:\n\nCheon pyo Lee, cl1828@mgsa.rutgers.edu\n\n07:081:231 Design I A: Type and Typography\n\nDesign I A: Type and Typography\n\nCourse Number: 07:081:231\n\nIntroduction to typography, the practice of making verbal language visual. Builds visual awareness of letterforms and their composition in space through studio projects that engage with type as a means for clear communication and visual expression. In addition to studio work, this course demands absorbing technical and historical knowledge in order to develop a visual sensitivity for typographic form. The practice of typography gives verbal language a visual form, material, and method of distribution. This course introduces the fundamental concepts and terminology of type, such as typefaces, type sizes, leading, kerning, grids, guides, composition, space, color, and motion. This studio course builds technical and practical skills towards a fluency in setting and manipulating type within a contemporary digital environment. Students will understand and use fonts and typesetting software to create and analyze typographic prototypes for both print and screen.\n\n4 credits\n\nCourse Prerequisites and Corequisites: None\n\nFaculty Contact:\n\nGerry Beegan, gbeegan@mgsa.rutgers.edu\n\n07:081:232 Design I-B\n\nDesign I-B: Form and Meaning\n\nCourse Number: 07:081:232\n\nIntroduction to a visual communication design process.

It’s in dialogue with the past and the present, with your beliefs and values, and with things you have seen, heard, felt, and cared about. It is in dialogue with the times in which you live, and it can be in dialogue with the conflicts or struggles that you’ve faced and the personal experiences you’ve had. It is also, always, in dialogue with other artists, even those you haven’t seen or don’t know about. In other words, sometimes these conversations are conscious and sometimes they’re not.\n\nThis is a class about becoming more conscious of the conversations your work is having with other artists. Engaging with other people’s artwork can be empowering. You can learn from and find motivation in these encounters, especially when you take them personally, when you think about the encounters in relation to your own work and ideas. The very act of engaging and trying to figure out questions and concerns other artists have can help you to identify and clarify your own questions and concerns. Critical engagement with other people’s work can help you feel less alone in the sometimes solitary practice of making art. It can provide you with motivation and inspiration, even in encounters with work that you find challenging and difficult, and even with work that doesn’t move you.\n\n3 credits\n\nCourse Prerequisites: Art & Design Foundations, Art & Design students or permission of instructor.
