        "text": "CEO pay continues to increase. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) ¹ reported that the median CEO pay increase last year was 6 percent among the S&P 500 companies. Given the methodology used to calculate CEO pay, this may be under reported. Most reports on CEO pay – including ours – use total disclosed compensation as reported by companies under SEC requirements. This includes an estimated “grant date value” of equity and stock option awards. In the recent sustained bull market, it has become apparent that this figure vastly understates the amount of money that executives receive. A report by the Economic Policy Institute found that value of CEO compensation has grown 52.6 percent in the recovery since 2009 using an “options- exercised” measure compared to just 29.4 percent using the “options-granted” measure.²\n\nWhen company performance is considered, the most overpaid CEOs are disproportionately overpaid. Regression analysis showed that 15 of the most overpaid CEOs on our list each had compensation that was at least $20 million higher than if their pay had been properly aligned with performance. Of these CEOs, one received compensation that was $200 million above what the performance of the company justified, another one was $100 million above what it should have been based on TSR, and two others more than $50 million higher.\n\nThe list of the 100 Most Overpaid CEOs contains many repeat offenders. Figure 1 identifies the companies with the 25 most overpaid CEOs, and his (yes, they are all men!) pay as reported in the company proxy statement, as well as the pay of his median employee and the ratio of the CEO’s pay to that of the employee. In this list, the Walt Disney company appears for the third year in a row, and American International, Ameriprise, Centene, Jefferies Financial, and Netflix appear for the second year in a row.\n\nShareholder votes against CEO pay packages can encourage companies to make significant reforms. An analysis by Equilar found that companies with failed pay votes in 2018 implemented a number of changes, the three most common of which were: increasing the proportion of long-term incentive plan grants strictly tied to performance, reducing overall pay, and changing metrics or weighting among other changes.³ Another analysis by Ran Bi of Equilar, covered by the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, found that “average CEO total compensation at companies that failed Say on Pay decreased significantly from 2011 to 2017, a total of 44.9% over that time frame.”⁴ Shareholder pressure at Disney led to several changes to Robert Iger’s employment agreement, including some just a few days before the annual meeting. (See page 20).\n\nThe level of shareholder opposition to excessive CEO pay continues to grow. A Financial Times article defines opposition from 20 percent of the shareholders as a marker to define a shareholder revolt. The article found that last year, among the S&P 500 companies, 61 had reached that level of opposition, a 33 percent increase from the 46 companies that had that level of opposition in 2014.⁵ As reported in the CLS Blue Sky Blog, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) calculated that the share of Russell 3000 companies with meetings from January to May receiving shareholder support of less than 80 percent for their CEO pay packages reached 13.5 percent in 2019, a stark 44 percent increase from the 9.4 percent of in 2017.⁶\n\nMany financial fund managers continue to improve their analysis and vote against more CEO pay packages each year. There were 30 financial fund managers (with combined AUM of over $3.6 trillion) that increased the number of CEO pay packages they voted against by more than 10 percent between 2018 and 2019. In this report we look at we look at several of them, specifically, UBS Asset Management, Sarasin, and CalPERS.\n\nThe largest fund managers – particularly BlackRock – are total outliers in their voting on the issue of CEO pay. They opt to vote against only a very few of the CEO pay packages, and their votes are hard to understand. In 2018, BlackRock voted against more pay packages of CEOs who were paid less than $5 million than they did for CEOs paid over $20 million. Since many pension funds use Blackrock as one of their financial managers, they may not be fully aware of what Blackrock is doing (and not doing) on their behalf.\n\nThe public recognition that CEOs are overpaid continues to grow. In November 2019 Stanford University published a survey of American views on Pay for Performance. The survey found “Eighty-six percent of respondents believe the CEOs of large, public U.S. companies are overpaid; only 14 do not.”⁷ This number is a 3 percent increase from 83 percent in 2016, when Stanford found many respondents tremendously under-estimated the actual level of CEO pay, but still considered CEO pay excessive on the less-informed grounds of their estimates.\n\nAn analysis by The Wall Street Journal in May 2019 found that in the prior year median CEO pay rose to $12.4 million among the S&P 500 companies, up 6.6 percent from 2017.⁸\n\nEven the 10 percent of the companies with the worst one-year shareholder returns had CEOs with median pay packages of $12.6 million. Study after study shows CEO pay moving upward. The Economic Policy Institute report found that from 1978 to 2018, inflation-adjusted CEO compensation based on realized stock options of the CEOs increased 940 percent. The increase was more than 25 to 33 percent greater than the stock market growth and, at 940 percent, substantially greater than the 11.9 percent growth in a typical worker’s annual pay over the same period.⁹\n\nCEO pay is a core contributor to America’s extreme and growing income inequality. The headlines tell the story: From The Washington Post, “Income inequality in America is the highest it’s been since Census Bureau started tracking it, data shows,”¹⁰ or from The Huffington Post, “Just 162 Billionaires Have the Same Wealth as Half of Humanity,”¹¹ and another one from The Washington Post, “The massive triumph of the rich, illustrated by stunning new data.”¹² Concern about this income disparity is getting at least some lip service, a recent piece in The New York Times covered the 2020’s Davos Manifesto,¹³ including demands that corporations to pay their “fair share” of taxes, continuously improve the “well-being” of employees, and treat “executive remuneration” responsibly.\n\nOne of the companies on our Most Overpaid list this year is Boeing. CEO Dennis A. Muilenburg received total compensation of $23.4 million for 2018. Under his leadership Boeing cut corners on the 737 Max, resulting in two plane crashes and the loss of hundreds of lives. These crashes and the subsequent grounding of the 737 Max cost the company billions of dollars of value and, in 2019, Muilenburg was fired. He received a huge $62 million payment upon his departure. In a letter to the Boeing board questioning the proposed bonus for incoming CEO Dave Calhoun, Senators Edward Markey, Richard Blumenthal, and Tammy Baldwin wrote “In pursuit of profit, Boeing rushed the design, production, and certification of the 737 MAX.” 14\n\nEven though two plane crashes killing 386 people and the resulting crash of Boeing’s stock price occurred prior to the 2019 annual meeting, the CEO pay proposal was supported at that meeting by 93.2 percent of shareholder votes.\n\nFinancial managers who voted the shares that they controlled against Muilenberg’s CEO pay package included BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, and Parametric. BMO Global Asset Management voted against the package based on concerns with the incentive awards, according to description on Proxy Insight, and added, “We encourage the company to consider its clawback options pending the substantial revenue booked this year on the sales of aircraft that have since been recalled.” The Florida SBA voted against the package based on insufficient disclosure of STIP (short term incentive plan) and LTIP (long term incentive plan) performance goals. The largest shareholder BlackRock, who controlled 6 percent of the shares at the time, voted in favor of Muilenburg’s CEO pay package.\n\nIn January 2020, the company disclosed the package in which Muilenberg would receive $62.2 million as he departed the company. It also disclosed its agreement with long-term board member and incoming CEO David L. Calhoun. 15\n\nShareholders will not vote on that agreement until this spring. The agreement includes a promised bonus based on returning the 737 Max to service. As the Senators noted in their letter, “This payment represents a clear financial incentive for Mr. Calhoun to pressure regulators into ungrounding the 737 Max, as well as rush the investigations and reforms needed to guarantee public safety.”16\n\nEach year we evaluate CEO pay at all S&P 500 companies using data provided by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). We also use data provided by HIP Investor that uses a statistical regression model to compute what the pay of the CEO would be, assuming such pay is related to cumulative total shareholder return (TSR) over the previous five years. This provides a formula to calculate the amount of excess pay a CEO receives. To this we add data that ranks companies by what percent of company shares were voted against the CEO pay package. Finally, we rank companies by the pay ratio between CEO’s pay, and the pay of the median company employee.\n\nThe rankings of companies by excess CEO pay and by shareholder votes on CEO pay are weighted at 40 percent each. The final ranking, based on CEO to worker pay ratio, is weighted at 20 percent. The complete list of the 100 most overpaid CEOs using this methodology is found in Appendix A. The regression analysis of predicted and excess pay calculated by HIP Investor is found in Appendix C, and its methodology is explained in further detail there.\n\nFigure 1 presents the 25 Most Overpaid CEOs. The full list of 100 is in Appendix A.\n\nTHE SHAREHOLDER RESPONSE TO EXCESSIVE CEO COMPENSATION\n\nIn 2011, under section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, companies have been required to allow shareholders to vote on the pay of the CEO, and the four other top corporate officers, in addition to electing the corporation’s board of directors and weighing in on various shareholder proposals. Since that time, opposition to high CEO pay has been growing and more companies have seen their CEO pay packages receive less support from their shareholders. Shares held by U.S. public pension funds and European financial fund managers have made their opposition to excess CEO pay clear.\n\nEven so, the level of shareholder opposition does not yet reflect broader attitudes toward CEO pay. Andrew Edgecliff-Johnson in a Financial Times opinion piece suggests that such shareholder votes “. . . may have blinded compensation committees to how non-shareholders see the ever increasing rewards for corporate leaders.”²²\n\nPROXY ADVISORS AND PROPOSED NEW SEC RULES\n\nFinancial managers often rely on proxy advisors to evaluate CEO pay packages. Though evidence has shown that financial fund managers do not blindly follow the advisors’ recommendations (particularly when they suggest voting against the pay of the CEO), companies have often blamed the advisors rather than themselves for low shareholder support for CEO pay packages.\n\nA new SEC proposed rule would require any proxy advisory service to submit a draft of proxy voting advice for review by the company before the advice can be issued. By giving the companies more time to review the advice, they are giving the advisor’s clients, the financial fund managers, less time.\n\nIn his statement on release of the rule SEC Commissioner Robert J. Jackson Jr. wrote, “Consider a proxy advisor deciding how to advise shareholders in a proxy fight driven by poor performance. Recommending that investors support management comes with few additional costs under today’s proposal. But firms recommending a vote against executives must now give their analysis to management, include executives’ objections in their final report, and risk federal securities litigation over their methodology. Taxing anti-management advice in this way makes it easier for insiders to run public companies in a way that favors their own private interests over those of ordinary investors.”²³ The same would be true, of course, for any compensation proposal.\n\nFirst Affirmative, in a comment letter on the topic writes, “We are particularly concerned that a product we pay for – impartial and comprehensive company research – will be subject to review and potential amendment by the very companies that are under review before we, the paying customer, ever receives the product.”²⁴ First Affirmative also cites an editorial by Kurt N. Schacht, for CFA Institute’s advocacy group:\n\n“[...] we do enormous damage to the honesty and integrity of markets when we let issuers try to modulate negative advice or subvert opinions in the guise of fact-checking. It is dangerously close to regulating an analyst’s buy/sell opinions on a stock. It is as much a Constitutional right for investment managers to hear the unexpurgated views of professional analysts as it is for the issuers to state their own case. We wish it were not so, but this proxy proposal by any other name is analyst retaliation.”²⁵\n\nThe two largest proxy advisors are Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, but there are also several smaller advisors, such as Egan-Jones, Segal Marco and PIRC.\n\nISS uses what they term “a quantitative degree-of-alignment scale” to evaluate CEO pay and company performance. In 2019, ISS recommended voting against 11 percent of the CEO pay packages at S&P 500 companies, and 32 of the 100 most overpaid CEOs. This represents little change year over year. These numbers are based on the default ISS “standard” policy. ISS also offers different voting recommendations based on other policies that may more accurately reflect the views of different sets of investors, and financial fund managers. For example, a policy developed for pension funds operating under the Taft Hartley Act recommends voting against 51 of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages. Another policy designed to appeal to “Socially Responsible Investors” recommends voting against just 33 of the 100 most overpaid CEOs. Many users of ISS proxy voting services take advantage of ISS’s ability to create their own custom policies. In the case of CEO pay, these custom policies can produce substantial differences from the standard ISS recommendations.\n\nGlass Lewis, which can also create custom policies, uses a model comparing CEO pay in relation to company peers, and company performance compared to peers, and awards letter grades between A and F. An “A” means that the percentile rank for compensation is significantly less than its percentile rank for company performance. For 2020 Glass Lewis has announced that the model will introduce an enhanced peer group methodology that is proprietary to Glass Lewis and leverages the global compensation data and analytics tools of CGLytics. In 2019, Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote against 10 percent of the CEO pay packages at S&P 500 companies, and 32 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEOs.\n\nEgan-Jones Proxy Services creates a proprietary EJPS Compensation Rating for each company that begins with a quantitative raw score of “wealth creation” that relates CEO pay and company performance. The company is then compared to peers, and ranked by quintile as “Needs attention,” “some concerns,” “neutral,” “good,” or “superior.”²⁶ Egan-Jones then considers qualitative adjustment factors. Egan-Jones recommended voting against 44 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEOs.\n\nWhen analyzing compensation, Segal Marco conducts a first screen to identify corporations with good financial performance and less-than-anticipated pay. Those companies typically receive a “yes” vote on CEO pay packages. Those that don’t meet criteria, receive a secondary screening on a variety of pay practices (from accelerated vesting to gross-ups). Segal Marco recommended that shareholders vote against 42 percent of the CEO pay packages at S&P 500 companies, and 70 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEOs. Maureen O’Brien, vice president and director of corporate governance for Segal Marco, notes that the Segal Marco Advisors cast votes for 84 pension funds that subscribe directly for proxy voting and corporate governance service, and that there are additional funds that receive consulting or discretionary services from them.\n\nPensions and Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) one of the largest proxy advisors in Europe, recommended voting against all of the 100 most overpaid CEOs in its portfolio. PIRC was founded in 1986 and is “Europe’s largest independent corporate governance and shareholder advisory consultancy.”²⁷\n\nThe three largest financial managers, (BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street) are the largest shareholders in the vast majority of S&P 500 companies. Each of them holds between five and ten percent of each company. A recent Bloomberg report noted that 22 percent of the shares of the typical S&P 500 company are held by them, up from 13.5 percent in 2008.²⁸\n\nA Reuters analysis of proxy voting at 300 of the worst-performing companies in the Russell 3000 index found that, “BlackRock voted with management 93 percent of the time, followed by Vanguard at 91 percent, and State Street at 84 percent during the proxy year ended June 30, 2018.”²⁹\n\nIn December 2019, Jeff Sommer of The New York Times had Jackie Cooke, who directs Morningstar’s research on investment stewardship, analyze every vote cast by large mutual funds in 2019. Morningstar found that, “...while index funds offered by different companies were often nearly indistinguishable in fees and performance, the voting behavior of the funds was very different.”³⁰ The analysis found BlackRock and Vanguard as the most inclined to follow what management says, very different from BNY Mellon, Prudential, UBS, Aberdeen and Allianz.\n\nMany of these large financial managers operate passive funds that may invest in every company within the index, regardless of how well or poorly the company is run. Thus, if they find something wrong with the company, they do not sell shares. As Reuters notes, this “...leaves proxy voting as the primary leverage for index fund firms to hold companies accountable for practices that undermine shareholders’ interests, such as exorbitant executive pay.”³¹\n\nBlackRock – $7,430 billion AUM\n\nBlackRock, the largest fund manager measured by AUM, manages a significant share of money from “institutional” investors, and is receiving increasing attention regarding how it votes.\n\nBlackRock voted against 3 percent of the CEO pay packages of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 8 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nBlackRock’s 2019 Investment Stewardship Annual Report is beautifully designed with numbers, but presented without sufficient meaning or context. BlackRock provides information on numbers of companies “engaged,” percentage of companies with multiple engagements, and percent of equity assets engaged. It does not detail any understandings, successes or failures that came from those engagements, or how it voted its shares at company meetings on CEO pay, or any other issue.\n\nThe stewardship report has section titled, “Executive Compensation: The Role of Public Company Shareholders” that says, “Executive compensation is often cited as an example of how index fund managers can wield outsized control over corporations because as public company shareholders, they can participate in Say on Pay votes on behalf of their clients. This misperception reflects a lack of understanding of how executive compensation is determined and what Say on Pay votes actually entail. Say on Pay votes permit shareholders to express their views on executive compensation, but they do not dictate how much executives will be paid.”³²\n\nUsing data from Proxy Insight, we looked at all 105 of BlackRock’s votes against CEO pay advisory compensation at U.S. companies, and at the level of CEO compensation at those companies. We found that BlackRock voted against CEO pay more frequently at companies whose CEOs were paid less than $5 million (more than 60 firms), than they did at companies with CEOs paid over $20 million (15 firms). More than half of our list of 100 Overpaid CEOs had pay higher than $20 million last year, and BlackRock voted against only five of them this year.\n\nBlackRock notes that this year it “engaged” with nearly 600 companies on compensation practices and tracks the change in shareholder support for the 458 of these companies that had say on pay votes. “Of those 458, 211 (46 percent) companies saw year-over-year increases in voting support. Furthermore, 93 of the 211 (44 percent) companies received a 10 percent or greater increase in support for their Say on Pay proposal.”³³\n\nFirst consider the inverse of the figures provided: 54 percent of the companies it engaged with had the same, or decreased levels of shareholder support, for the pay of the CEO. However, increased level of support, the feature BlackRock highlights as occurring at 46 percent of the companies it engaged with, is not proof of improved compensation governance. Second, consider what is not disclosed: specifics on problems with the CEO pay package, responses and resulting changes, if any. BlackRock could have provided a figure as to how it voted, whether pay went up or down, what else changed, if anything.\n\nBlackrock’s votes on climate issues have also been the subject of investor and media focus. In September 2019, Majority Action released a report “Climate in the Boardroom: How Asset Manager Voting Shaped Corporate Climate Action in 2019.” While focusing primarily on shareholder proposals related to climate, the report examined votes on management proposals at 49 companies as well. Among the findings was that BlackRock and Vanguard supported CEO pay packages at all U.S. large capitalization energy and utility companies. Indeed, “BlackRock and Vanguard not only voted with management more often than most of their asset manager peers; they were also more likely to support management at these fossil fuel intensive companies than they did across U.S. equities overall.”³⁴\n\nVanguard – $4,530 billion AUM\n\nVanguard has seen a great increase in size over the last several years, tripling its AUM since 2011. As noted by Robin Wigglesworth and Richard Henderson in Vanguard and the US Financial System: Too Big to Be Healthy, Vanguard now accounts for more than one-quarter of the retail US mutual fund market (nearly as much as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Capital Group combined).³⁶ Unlike BlackRock and State Street, it does not manage money for a significant a share of pension funds.\n\nVanguard voted against 4 percent of packages of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 10 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nVanguard updated its proxy voting guidelines effective April 1, 2019. The new guidelines on CEO pay highlight three areas of concern: “Alignment of pay and performance, plan structure and ‘other considerations.’ In general, a fund will vote case-by-case on executive compensation proposals (including Say on Pay, remuneration reports, remuneration policies, etc.) and will support those that enhance long-term shareholder value. It will also vote for compensation proposals that reflect improvements in compensation practices if the proposals are not perfectly aligned with all of these guidelines but are clearly in the interests of long- term shareholder value.”³⁷\n\nVanguard’s Investment Stewardship 2019 Annual Report offers more useful data than the BlackRock report, including annual comparisons that show slightly increased opposition to pay packages. Vanguard reports that the funds voted on 5,768 CEO compensation proposals globally and supported 91 percent of them in the 2019 proxy year. While this represents a high level of support for high levels of CEO pay, it is notable that this level of support is less than Vanguard’s support of 93 percent of such proposals in 2018, and 97 percent in 2017.³⁸ Thus, the trend line is toward increasing opposition, though moving at a slow pace.\n\nState Street Global Advisors - $2,810 billion AUM\n\nState Street in its 2018-2019 Stewardship Report says, “We leverage the size and scope of our investments to have a meaningful impact on companies and help create long-term value on your behalf” and discloses how it undertakes this task. Each year State Street sets out specific sectors and issues that will be its primary focus. Those issues are discussed in great depth. The report includes a section entitled “Impact of Engagement” where State Street details specific discussions they were involved in regarding the quantum of pay (at Walt Disney Corporation) and improving the structure of compensation plans (at CVS).³⁹ This report is the only one from the three largest financial managers that includes an appendix specifically detailing which companies were engaged with, and what topics come up in particular discussions.\n\nOne figure shows the top five reasons “...driving our rationale on pay proposals..,”: poor disclosure (32 percent); poor structure (31 percent); overall compensation matters (14 percent); excessive pay (12 percent) and one-off payments (4 percent).⁴⁰\n\nState Street voted against 5 percent of packages of the S&P 500 companies, and abstained on an additional 5 percent; it voted against 15 percent of the 100 Most Overpaid CEO pay packages, and abstained on an additional 13 percent.\n\nState Street is increasing its policy of abstaining, believing that abstaining indicates dissatisfaction with the CEO pay package.\n\nDuring the time frame covered in this report, State Street reports voting on 2,445 pay-related proposals in the U.S. and Canada, supporting 90 percent, abstaining from 4 percent and voting against 6 percent.\n\nSarasin & Partners LLP – $17 billion AUM\n\nSarasin voted against 89.6 percent of packages of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 94 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nLondon-based asset manager Sarasin & Partners LLP revamped its analysis of remuneration packages in 2017 after becoming convinced that the conventional mainstream design of executive compensation was not working. Natasha Landell-Mills, Head of Stewardship, in an essay “What has Gone Wrong with Pay and What Can Investors Do About it” wrote, “Chief executives are – broadly speaking – paid too much. This is our conclusion whether we are looking at pay for performance or data on absolute rent extracted by senior executives as a proportion of economic value created.”⁴¹\n\nAs a long-term investor, Sarasin noted that it had watched business cycles that drove stock down and then back up, but left investors no better off than before. At the same time, executives who rode out that same cycle were often excessively rewarded for simply seeing the stock price restored.\n\nThere are three characteristics Sarasin looks for in a good remuneration plan: simplicity, moderation, and long-term alignment with shareholders. The votes against this year were driven by one element of the policy in particular: that companies should have post-departure share ownership requirements that ensure that some portion of an executive’s equity is held by them following their departure from the company. According to Sarasin’s 2018 Stewardship Report “the primary reasons for our vote against remuneration schemes” in 2018 was “insufficient share ownership levels and our desire to see executives hold shares for up to two years after they depart.”⁴² While this issue has been gaining traction, Sarasin appears to be the leader in enshrining the requirement in its voting practices.\n\nUBS Asset Management – $831 billion AUM\n\nUBS Asset Management voted 65.3 percent of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 76 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nAccording to Proxy Insight, the firm increased its level of opposition on votes at S&P 500 companies by more than any other asset manager. Using the same base – S&P 500 companies – UBS opposed 26.3 percent of pay packages in 2018; in 2019 it opposed 72.8 percent (UBS’s own analysis differs slightly: the firm cites opposition of 67 percent in 2019.)\n\nThe change in voting practices stems from an update to the proxy voting guidelines effective March 1, 2019. The guidelines include 18 bullet points of common reasons, or concerns, that may cause UBS to “not support a remuneration scheme.”\n\nIn an email a spokesperson for UBS said votes against were driven in large part by:\n\nRemuneration structures where long-term incentive plans do not have at least 50 percent of awards subject to performance conditions;\n\nRemuneration structures where the potential value of short-terms awards is higher than the value of long-term awards.\n\nFor each element of guidance, UBS makes it clear that these are flags, and not triggers for automatic opposition. UBS says it may vote against a pay package:\n\nIf a salary increase greater than 10 percent has been awarded without a reasonable explanation.\n\nWhere the company uses discretion in awarding a one-off variable pay award without sufficient explanation.\n\nWhere there is an insufficient explanation for a retention or recruitment payment, or where a recruitment payment is not performance based.\n\nIn situations where the long-term incentive plan allows for re-testing, or the company amends performance criteria retrospectively during the term of the scheme.\n\nIf the company has used a benchmarking exercise as a reason to raise the pay of executives without wider explanation.\n\nWhen the salary of an incoming Chief Executive is positioned higher than that of their predecessor without an adequate explanation.\n\nSeverance packages which exceed 2 years fixed salary plus average bonus pay.\n\nAXA Investment Managers (AXA) – $821 billion AUM\n\nAXA IM voted against 34 percent of packages of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 51 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nLast year AXA voted against less than 10 percent of the CEO pay packages. This year AXA voted against more than three times as many. In an email to As You Sow dated November 19, 2019, Irfan Patel noted that following multi-year private engagements AXA IM, “reviewed and toughened this approach in the US (and globally) at the start of 2019 demanding a stronger alignment between pay and performance.”\n\nAXA IM told the Financial Times “Our approach targets those laggards where performance-linked pay is still underutilised and does not make up at least half of incentive awards granted.”⁴³\n\nCalPERS – $396 billion AUM\n\nCalPERS voted against 50.4 percent of CEO pay packages of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 76.7 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nCalPERS’s role as a leader on the compensation issue continues to grow. In 2019, we reported on the steep increase of opposition to pay that occurred between proxy seasons 2017 and 2018. The level of opposition increased further in 2019. The first version of CalPERS’ pay for performance framework was implemented in January 2018, and a new proprietary five-year quantitative pay- for-performance model was implemented in March 2019, and finally the CalPERS P4P Scorecard was introduced in August 2019.\n\nIn September Equilar released the CalPERS P4P Scorecard⁴⁶on Equilar Insight, a leading executive compensation benchmarking software solution. The scorecard calculates a CEO’s realizable pay over a five-year period and compares that to the shareholders’ gain over that same timeframe. Its availability to Equilar subscribers will make more broadly accessible and adoptable by others.\n\nCalPERS’ Executive Compensation Analysis Framework provides details on the scorecard calculation. Specifically, a Financial Outcomes Spread is calculated, based on the Shareholder Financial Outcome minus the CEO Financial Outcome (using CalPERS realizable pay methodology). The spread reflects how much better or worse off the financial experience of shareholders is relative to that of the CEO. The quantitative analysis is coupled with a qualitative analysis, which includes elements similar to other guidelines.\n\nA few specifics are notable. CalPERs considers the use of adjusted metrics, or non-GAAP metrics, on compensation plans (without sufficient justification and prominent disclosure of the reconciliation) to be problematic, noting that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) accounting “...is appropriate for consistency and comparability.”⁴⁷\n\nIn addition, CalPERs has stated a preference for holding periods under which executives should be “...permitted to sell no more than 20 percent of net after tax vested equity per year starting in the 6th year after grant date. In addition to the longer holding period requirements during employment, we also prefer longer post-separation holding periods – such as two years – to discourage short-term focus ahead of separation.”⁴⁸\n\nThis is only one example of how CalPERS takes a longer view than many funds. “Over one, two, or three years performance might look good, but over 10 years, the relationship sometimes just isn’t there,”⁴⁹ Simiso Nzima, Investment Director & Head of Corporate Governance at CalPERS said in a Bloomberg article CalPERS Ups Pressure on Companies Over Executive Pay, Harassment.\n\nThese changes are a component of the longer view the pension fund takes which incorporates sustainability in its analyses. Anne Simpson, investment director at CalPERS, told the Financial Times, “The long-term drivers of risk and return ride on companies’ ability to manage their human capital, their physical resources. It is not enough simply to deploy finance with flair.”⁵⁰\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA – $146 billion AUM\n\nBritish Columbia voted against 32.5 percent of the CEO pay packages of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 62.6 percent of the 100 most overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nIn its report “ESG Engagement in Public Markets” BCI reports that next to the election of directors, “BCI spends the most time analyzing executive compensation programs.”⁵¹\n\nAccording to its 2019 proxy voting guidelines, BCI generally will vote against compensation structures that:⁵²\n\nDo not emphasize a pay for performance philosophy, with linkage to protecting and building long-term shareholder value Provide largely discretionary and/or guaranteed forms of comp\n\nDo not provide clear and comprehensive disclosure that enables shareholders to evaluate the pay for performance linkage Targets pay above the median of peer\n\nUses narrow or duplicative metrics in both the long term and short term plans\n\nProvide for excessive pay levels or contractual arrangements\n\nRely excessively on stock options with no associated performance conditions; or\n\nLack sufficient risk mitigation features.\n\nWhile Canadian companies are not required to allow shareholders to vote on pay, Canadian investors continue to urge companies to voluntarily adopt such proposals. Advocating for say on pay proposals in Canada is one of the two main engagement activities around compensation outlined in BCI’s 2018 Responsible Investing Annual Report. This is done both through “...encourage[ing] regulators and security commissioners to mandate”⁵³ such a vote and encouraging voluntary adoption at companies that do not have such a vote. BCI reports that the number of NSX companies that hold a voluntary vote has increased by 113 percent from 2012 to 2018, from 76 to 162 companies.\n\nRHODE ISLAND – $8 billion AUM\n\nRhode Island voted against 27 percent of CEO pay packages of the S&P 500 companies; it voted against 54 percent of the 100 Most Overpaid CEO pay packages.\n\nAs we noted in last year’s report, Rhode Island did a significant rewrite of their guidelines in 2018. In 2018 their level of opposition to pay at S&P 500 companies was only 12.6 percent. In 2019, the fund voted against pay at more than half of the S&P 500 companies in its portfolio. The 2019 Shareholder Engagement Overview notes, “It is in the best interest of members of the Rhode Island pension system that executive compensation incentivize management to focus on long term, sustainable corporate growth, rather than rewarding short-term risk taking, which was a significant factor in the 2008-2009 financial crisis.”⁵⁴\n\n“At a time when income inequality has grown to alarming levels in our country, investors like the pension fund should not be paying enormous salaries to corporate executives at companies that are performing poorly,” said Seth Magaziner, General Treasurer for the State of Rhode Island. “Executive compensation must be closely tied to long-term performance and structured in a manner that keeps corporate executives accountable to investors, including members of our pension system.”⁵⁵\n\nThere may be no company where the release of the pay ratio information caused more consternation than at the Walt Disney Company. The median employee in 2018 earned $46,127. The CEO’s pay was $65,645,214. The pay ratio to median employee was 1,424:1. When employees, forced to sleep in their cars because they could not afford rent, reached out to the Abigail Disney – a member of the family – she took up their cause and wrote an editorial in The Washington Post, It is time to call out Disney – and anyone else getting rich off their workers’ backs.\n\nShareholders were also angry. At the company’s meeting in 2018, an astonishing 54 percent of shareholders objected to the contract Disney offered to their CEO. On March 4, 2019 just a few days before their March 7 annual meeting, Robert Iger agreed to a reduction of salary and guaranteed bonus of $13.5 million.\n\nThe board had already responded to the 2018 vote by amending the contract to address the treatment of some performance shares in the $100 million equity grant. Nevertheless, both ISS and Glass Lewis recommended against the CEO pay package, contending that those changes were not enough. The fact that the company made another change so close to the vote, suggests that perhaps the board was talking to some of their largest shareholders about their vote up to the last minute.\n\nIn the vote following the change, 41.3 percent of shareholders cast their vote against the package, and another 3.5 percent abstained. Vanguard, BNY Mellon and T. Rowe Price were the largest Disney shareholders that voted against the plan in 2018 and supported it in 2019.\n\nDisney’s compensation changes illustrate how desperately companies want to avoid having a majority of votes cast against their compensation plans. Disney has lowered CEO Iger’s pay in the package that will be voted on in the upcoming March 2020 annual meeting.56 Disney has lagged the S&P 500 and only recently is approaching the cumulative five-year performance of the index.\n\nFIGURE 4: 2019 OVERPAID CEOS SLIGHTLY UNDERPERFORM\n\n4.84-Year Total shareholder Return (TSR)\n\nfrom 02/31/15 to 12/31/19 of the 2019 Overpaid list\n\nThe trend we observed in Figure 3 is reinforced and made more visible over the almost 5- year period illustrated in Figure 4. Taking this year’s list of Top100 firms which overpay their CEOs, we are able to see a similar performance to the list from 2015. The trend therefore persists, where there is no proven connection between pay and performance.\n\nIn light of this, we should pay attention to what the compensation packages of the companies we invest in look like. Allocating the capital differently within the company may lead to improved long-term growth and returns for shareholders.\n\nYour portfolio is your money. The companies and funds you invest in should be aligned with your values and way of seeing the world. However, the most overpaid CEO pay packages are approved by Boards, elected by you the investor, and the mutual funds who\n\nhold their stocks. We encourage you as investors to speak up, vote your “say on pay,” and pressure the companies and funds in your portfolio with this evidence – which can benefit your long-term financial performance and a more appropriate level of rewards for results achieved.\n\nThe aggregated information comprising The Most Overpaid CEOs 2020 represents a snapshot in time of publicly available information regarding shareholder voting with U.S. public companies.\n\nThe information provided in The Most Overpaid CEOs 2020 is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind.
