        "text": "Students join Law Review by being accepted after the successful completion of a write-ons process. Law Review holds joint write-ons with CURRENTS: Journal of International Economic Law (CURRENTS: JIEL). To write ons to both South Texas Law Review and CURRENTS:JIEL, students must complete the Write-Ons Competition assignment. Students participating in the Write-Ons can specify a desire to be considered for one or both journals. Currently Write-Ons are held at least three times a year:\n\nafter the completion of the1st year full time spring academic semester;\n\nright be for the following fall academic semester\n\nafter the fall academic semester (the December break)before the start of the spring academic semester.\n\nFor those planning to take part in the upcoming Write-Ons, please look for and attend the information sessions put on by the Editors-in Chief (ECIs) of South Texas Law Review and CURRENTS:JIEL. Meanwhile, feel free to email either of the EICs.\n\nThe Write-Ons assignment is comprised of three components, a case note, an editing exercise, and a grammar exercise. The case note is a detailed analysis of a recent case through support or criticism of the respective court’s rationale and holding, which show cases necessary legal research and writing skills. Where the case note upholds substance over form, the editing exercise values the exact opposite. The editing exercise tests the student’s ability to adhere to the strict guidelines set forth in the Bluebook, the Green book, and the Manual on Usage and Style. Finally, the grammar exercise tests the student’s ability to think through the mechanics of syntax and focuses on proper use of vocabulary, punctuation, and, of course, grammar.\n\nStudents must submit all components of the assignment to the Coordinator of Scholarly Publications by the set deadline to qualify for consideration for either journal. Write-On submissions are reviewed anonymously, and offers are extended by South Texas Law Review and CURRENTS:JIEL to successful candidates."
