        "text": "Alvin Doyle Coombs (Dr. Doyle to all who knew him) passed away peacefully on July 20, 2023 at his home, surrounded by his loving wife and his children.\n\nHe was born October 5, 1942 to Andrew Alvin Coombs and LaVon Emma Smith in Fountain Green, Utah.\n\nDoyle attended elementary school in Fountain Green and Moroni. He graduated from North Sanpete High School in 1960, where he was an active member of the FFA and of the high school basketball team. After graduation he attended Snow College.\n\nHe married Ann Carter on March 2, 1962 in Nephi, Utah. They were sealed in the Manti Temple on June 30, 1990. They were the parents of six children.\n\nIn 1960 he started working for Dick Wetherall at Dick’s Service in Nephi as a station attendant, where Dick taught Doyle diesel mechanics. In 1975 he bought Dick’s Service and he and Ann established Doyle’s Diesel. Doyle was known nation wide as Dr. Doyle, and had a great reputation amongst the trucking industry for being a Cummins engine genius. In the early years, Doyle was a mobile mechanic serving the western United States. Doyle’s motto has always been, “never lose sight of the fact that the most important step of your success will be how you treat others, family, friends, co-workers and strangers you meet along the way.” He never expected an employee to do anything he wouldn’t do himself. His company was named Utah outstanding company of the year in 1991 for his work with disabled students. He was a member of the Utah towing association.\n\nDoyle was an active member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints where he held many callings. He served as the young mens president, a primary teacher, and Elders Quorum President. He would’ve said that they were all his favorite. He served as a temple ordinance worker at the Manti Temple for seventeen years and at the Payson Temple for six years. His favorite role to play in the live temple session was Satan, where he could wear his black suit and cowboy boots. He made many friends over those years working there.\n\nHe was a member of the Nephi Lion’s Club for many years until the time of his death. He was the president and loved serving there. He received the Melvin Jones Fellow award for dedicated humanitarian services for Lions Club International Foundation in 2021. He and Ann established the Juab County veterans memorial. Doyle was the Ute Stampede grand marshal in 2016, and he and Ann were the grand marshals for the Ute Stampede in 2021. He was an active member of the Utah Cutting Horse Association and the National Cutting Horse Association.\n\nHe was a member of the Nephi Nebo Posse, and the Nephi Fire Department. He did all repairs for the fire equipment as a service and Doyle’s Diesel continues that relationship. He was an avid BYU Cougar fan. He was a life time Silver Cougar Club Member. Ann and Doyle were awarded Juab’s big hearts and helping hands in 2023.\n\nDoyle was a little league wrestling coach for many years. Was always willing to donate both time and money into Juab High School Sports and his community. He was a member of The Royal Order of Elks and he loved taking his daughters, daughter in laws and grand daughters to the daddy daughter dinners/dance every year.\n\nHis favorite title was “Dad” and “Grandpa.” He loved camping, hunting, and fishing with his children and his grandchildren. They were his most prized possessions, he loved watching and supporting them in all their activities. He loved getting his family together in the backyard for barbecues. He also loved Thanksgiving dinner with his family where he made sure everyone had a place to sit at the table. He loved Christmas where he and Ann could spoil all the grandkids.\n\nDoyle is survived by his wife of sixty one years and five of his six children, Kelly (deceased) Jamie Coombs of Nephi, KC (Sherri) Coombs of West Valley City, Patsy Ragle (Angelo Schena) of Nephi, Khristie (Perry) Allred of Nephi, Tawhnye (Randy) Evans of Santaquin, Torry (Tina) Coombs of Nephi, twenty-four grand children and thirty-six great grand children, brother Garn (Carolyn) Coombs of Springville and sister in law Rae Coombs. Preceded in death by his parents, brothers Jay (Pat) and Boyd, son Kelly Doyle and grandson Brian KC.\n\nThe viewing will be held Monday, July 31, 2023 from 6:00 to 9:00 pm and Tuesday, August 1, 2023 from 10:00 am to 11:45 am at the Nephi Stake Center, 351 North 100 West, with funeral services starting at 12:00 pm at the Stake Center.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at Valeo Home Health and the staff at Central Valley Medical Center. Also, Brace Carroll and Mike Anderson with Anderson Funeral Home."
