        "text": "Welcome to Gatsby!\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is considered one of the great American novels and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide since its publication in 1925. As we celebrate the novel’s 99th anniversary, the A.R.T. has the unique opportunity to bring it to life for new generations. The process of adapting a novel for the stage is a chance to harness the storytelling power of theater—to transform the words on the page into a living, breathing, and musical experience that unfolds in time and space. Gatsby is a musical adaptation that reimagines Fitzgerald’s novel for the stage through the collaboration of the brilliant minds of international rock star Florence Welch (Florence + the Machine), Oscar and Grammy Award nominee Thomas Bartlett (Doveman), and Pulitzer Prize winner Martyna Majok (Cost of Living).\n\nLeading the team, Tony Award-winning director Rachel Chavkin returns to the A.R.T. after staging numerous productions including Moby-Dick; Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812; RoosevElvis; and Three Pianos. We are also thrilled to welcome back Tony Award-winning scenic designer Mimi Lien (Moby-Dick; Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812; The Communist Dracula Pageant), and lighting designer Alan C. Edwards (Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992). We welcome to the A.R.T. for the first time Tony Award-winning choreographer Sonya Tayeh, Academy Award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell, music supervisor Kimberly Grigsby, music director Wiley DeWeese, Olivier Award-winning sound designer Tony Gayle, hair and wig designer Matthew Armentrout, and make-up designer Sarah Cimino.\n\nWhether it’s your first time at the A.R.T. or you’ve joined us for past productions, we hope you enjoy this bold reimagining of a beloved classic.\n\nDiane Paulus\n\nTerrie and Bradley Bloom Artistic Director\n\nProduced by special arrangement with Amanda Ghost and Len Blavatnik for Unigram/Access Entertainment, and Jordan Roth, in association with Robert Fox and co-producer Hannah Giannoulis.\n\nFirst performance at the Loeb Drama Center on May 26, 2024.\n\nProduction support of Gatsby is provided by Katie and Paul Buttenwieser, The Linda Hammett Ory & Andrew Ory Charitable Trust, and Janet and Irv Plotkin.\n\nMedia Support of Gatsby is provided by WBUR.\n\nA.R.T.
