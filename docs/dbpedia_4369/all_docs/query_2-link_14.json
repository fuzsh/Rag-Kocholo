Vaughn was born on Sunday, May 21, 1972 at 9:30 am in Brooklyn, New York to Annette Vaughn Aiken and his late father, Henry Eugene Aiken. When he was two years old, the family moved to the Bronx, New York. Vaughn attended school in the Bronx until he enrolled at City College in Manhattan, New York where he graduated in 2003.\n\nVaughn began his federal government service at a young age working as a Clerk for the US Attorney's office before being hired by the U.S. Marshals Service in 1996 as a Support Specialist in the Southern District of New York. During his 22 distinguished years at the U.S. Marshals Service, Vaughn was promoted six (6) times working as a Support Specialist and Property Management Specialist eventually transferring to the Headquarters in Virginia for the last 12 years of his career. His last position was the Property Officer for the Information Technology Division until his retirement in June of 2018 due to his illness. Vaughn loved working in the Property Management field and consistently excelled at his job. His many achievements and accolades included several employee achievement awards and the 2016 Director's Distinguished Group Award for the implementation of a new property management system at the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nVaughn was full of life and was often found telling jokes to make people laugh. He was a lover of many things, Marvel movies, Batman - yes the actual Batman character, taking selfies of anyone and everyone who crossed his path, and especially martial arts. His passion for martial arts started at a young age when his Mom enrolled him in classes. He developed his skills over the years and opened up his own martial arts school in his garage 5 years ago teaching others about Jiu Jitsu and Bujinkan. He took pride in his martial arts skills and would frequently walk down the hallways at work trying out various martial arts techniques on his unsuspecting co-workers, much to their chagrin. He continued his teaching until his illness progressed and he could no longer hold classes. His obsession with Marvel and the Batman character also began at a young age and continued to his death. He often would dress up like Batman and anxiously wait for new Batman movies to come out. When asked why he loved Batman, he would simply respond \"We are soulmates. I am just like him - we are both out to save the world.\"\n\nChristopher David Hill\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshal\n\nEnd of Watch: January 18, 2018\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Christopher David Hill, 45, died in the line of duty at approximately 6:30 a.m. on January 18, 2018 while serving a warrant on a fugitive in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
