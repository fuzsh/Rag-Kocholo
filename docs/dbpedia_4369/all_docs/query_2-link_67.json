        "text": "Emma Specter in Conversation With Vanessa Friedman\n\nTuesday, August 13 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nMillions of us use restrictive diets, intermittent fasting, IV therapies, and Ozempic abuse to shrink until we are sample-size acceptable. But for the 30 million Americans who live with eating disorders, it isn’t just about less. More, Please (Harper) is a chronicle of a lifelong fixation with food — its power to soothe, to comfort, to offer a fleeting escape from the outside world — as well as an examination of the ways in which compulsory thinness, diet culture, and the seductive promise of “wellness” have resulted in warping countless Americans’ relationship with healthy eating. Melding memoir, reportage, and in-depth interviews with some of the most prominent and knowledgeable commentators currently writing about body shape and fatness, “emotional eating” and our disorders with food — Jennifer Weiner, Marisa Meltzer, Virgie Tovar, Sabrina Imbler, Leslie Jamison, and others — Vogue writer and rising culture commentator Emma Specter explores binge-eating disorder as both a personal problem and a societal one. In More, Please she provides a context, a history, and a language for what it means to always want more than you’ll allow yourself to have. Specter will be joined in conversation by Vanessa Friedman, deputy managing editor at Hey Alma.\n\nBuy the Book\n\nAmanda Bellows in Conversation With Michael N. McGregor\n\nWednesday, August 14 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nThe archetype of the American explorer, a rugged white man, has dominated our popular culture since the late eighteenth century, when Daniel Boone’s autobiography captivated readers with tales of treacherous journeys. But our commonly held ideas about American exploration do not tell the whole story — far from it. Amanda Bellows’s The Explorers (William Morrow) rediscovers a diverse group of Americans who went to the western frontier and beyond, traversing the farthest reaches of the globe and even penetrating outer space in their endeavor to find the unknown. Many escaped from lives circumscribed by racism, sexism, poverty, and discrimination as they took on great risk in unfamiliar territory to exercise personal freedom. Born into slavery, James Beckwourth found freedom as a mountain man and became one of the great entrepreneurs of Gold Rush California. Matthew Henson, the son of African American sharecroppers, left rural Maryland behind to seek the North Pole. Women like Harriet Chalmers Adams ascended Peruvian mountains to gain geographic knowledge while Amelia Earhart and Sally Ride shattered glass ceilings by pushing the limits of flight. In The Explorers, readers will travel across the vast Great Plains and into the heights of the Sierra Nevada mountains; they will traverse the frozen Arctic Ocean and descend into the jungles of South America; they will journey by canoe and horseback, train and dogsled, airplane and space shuttle. Readers will experience the exhilarating history of American exploration alongside the men and women who shared a deep drive to discover the unknown. Across two centuries and many thousands of miles of terrain, Bellows offers an ode to our country’s most intrepid adventurers — and reveals the history of America in the process. Bellows will be joined in conversation by Michael N. McGregor, author of Pure Act: The Uncommon Life of Robert Lax.\n\nBuy the Book\n\nMelissa Urban in Conversation With Michelle Tam\n\nWednesday, August 14 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nDo you struggle with cravings, fatigue, digestive issues, pain, or other symptoms?

What to do when you're the perpetual new kid, only child, military brat hustling school-to-school each year and everyone's looking to you for answers? Make some shit up, of course! And a young Jay Ellis does just that, with help from every child's favorite co-conspirator — their imaginary best friend. Born in the perfect storm of especially ferocious rain and a sugar-fueled imagination, Mikey, his imaginary best friend, steps in to figuratively hold Jay's hand through various youthful shenanigans. A testament to the importance of imagination, trusting oneself, and making space for your creativity, Did Everyone Have an Imaginary Friend (or Just Me)? (One World) is a story of a '90s kid who confided in his imaginary sidekick to navigate everything from parallel pop culture universes, like watching Fresh Prince alongside John Hughes movies or listening to Ja Rule and Dave Matthews, to a lifetime of birthday disappointment (being a Christmas-season Capricorn will do that to you) and hoop dreams gone bad. Mikey also guides him through greater tragedies, like losing his teenage cousin in a mistaken-target drive-by and the shame and fear of being pulled over by cops almost a dozen times the year he got his driver's license. As imaginary friend morphs into adult consciousness, Ellis charts an unforgettable story of looking within yourself for guidance to some of life’s biggest (and smallest) challenges, told in the roast-you-with-love voice of your closest homie. Ellis will be joined in conversation by Renée Watson, author of skin & bones.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nWilly Vlautin in Conversation With Patterson Hood\n\nFriday, August 16 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nWilly Vlautin explores loneliness, art, addiction, regret, love, and hard-won empathy in a poignant new novel — his most personal to date — that captures the life of a journeyman musician unable to escape the tragedies of his past. Al Ward lives on an isolated mining claim in the high desert of central Nevada fifty miles from the nearest town. A grizzled man in his sixties, he survives on canned soup, instant coffee, and memories of his ex-wife, friends and family he’s lost, and his life as a touring musician. Hampered by insomnia, bouts of anxiety, and a chronic lethargy that keeps him from moving back to town, Al finds himself teetering on the edge of madness and running out of reasons to go on — until a horse arrives on his doorstep: nameless, blind, and utterly helpless. Al hopes the horse will vanish as mysteriously as he appeared. Yet the animal remains, leaving him in a conundrum. Is the animal real, or a phantom conjured from imagination? As Al contemplates the horse’s existence — and what, if anything, he can do — his thoughts are interspersed with memories of his life as a musician, from the moment his mother’s part-time boyfriend gifts him a 1959 butterscotch blonde Telecaster, to the day his life as a traveling musician begins. He joins various bands — all who perform his songs once they discover his talent — playing casinos, truck stops, clubs, and bars. He falls in love, and finds pockets of companionship and minor success along the way. Never close to stardom or financial success, he continues as a journeyman for decades until alcoholism and a heartbreaking tragedy lead him to the isolation of the barren Nevada desert. Vlautin's The Horse (Harper) is a beautiful, haunting tale from an author working at the height of his powers. Vlautin will be joined in conversation by Patterson Hood, front man, singer, songwriter, and guitar player for Drive-By Truckers.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nMary E. Roach in Conversation With Courtney Gould & Megan Lally\n\nMonday, August 19 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nKnives Out meets A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder in Mary E. Roach’s debut YA mystery Better Left Buried (Disney-Hyperion), in which two girls try to get to the bottom of a town full of secrets, a family full of mystery, and an abandoned amusement park where people keep turning up dead. Lucy Preston just wants to go on vacation. But being the daughter of a famous private detective means that sometimes, your beach vacay goes off the rails a bit. Think: a clandestine meeting at an abandoned amusement park — except instead of a meeting, Lucy and her mom find a body. Because of course they do. As Lucy’s mom is swept into top-secret detective stuff, Lucy sets out to investigate her mom’s mysterious connection with this town. Lucy’s snooping sets her on a collision course with Audrey Nelson, the mysterious girl on the motorcycle who was there the night they found the body. Lucy has questions, and Audrey has answers, but there’s this tiny problem: Lucy’s mom is investigating Audrey’s mom… for murder. Everyone has something to hide, and if Lucy and Audrey can’t work together to uncover secrets that go back generations, there will likely be another body found at the base of the old roller coaster. And this time it might just be Lucy’s. Alternating between Lucy and Audrey’s point of view, and filled with suspense as secrets are spilled, Better Left Buried is sure to leave readers on the edge of their seats until the very last page. Roach will be joined in conversation by Courtney Gould, author of Where Echoes Die, and Megan Lally, author of That’s Not My Name.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nP. Djèlí Clark in Conversation With Caitlin Starling\n\nWednesday, August 21 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nWith The Dead Cat Tail Assassins (Tordotcom), Nebula and Alex Award winner P. Djèlí Clark introduces a brand-new world and a fantastical city full of gods and assassins. Eveen the Eviscerator is skilled, discreet, professional, and here for your most pressing needs in the ancient city of Tal Abisi. Her guild is strong, her blades are sharp, and her rules are simple. Those sworn to the Matron of Assassins — resurrected, deadly, wiped of their memories — have only three unbreakable vows. First, the contract must be just. That's above Eveen's pay grade. Second, even the most powerful assassin may only kill the contracted. Eveen's a professional. She's never missed her mark. The third and the simplest: once you accept a job, you must carry it out. And if you stray? A final death would be a mercy. When the Festival of the Clockwork King turns the city upside down, Eveen's newest mission brings her face to face with a past she isn't supposed to remember and a vow she can't forget. Clark will be joined in conversation by Caitlin Starling, author of The Death of Jane Lawrence and The Luminous Dead.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nDeb Miller Landau in Conversation With Kimberly A. C. Wilson\n\nThursday, August 22 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nThe 1987 murder of Lita McClinton Sullivan sent shockwaves through the affluent Atlanta suburb of Buckhead, Georgia like few other crimes before it. The neighborhood, with its stately mansions and top-tier schools, was simply not the kind of place where women were gunned down in cold blood in broad daylight. How many socialites had enemies so dangerous they would be murdered by a hitman pretending to deliver roses on an early winter morning? Lita was an intelligent, accomplished, and stunning Black woman from a respected Atlanta family. Her interracial marriage to white millionaire Jim Sullivan, who hailed from working-class Boston, was a newsworthy occurrence in 1970s Georgia. For a while, the couple made the marriage work, but it wasn’t long before Jim’s roving eye and controlling nature put Lita on edge. When he bought a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida (without telling her), the façade of their life together began to crumble. Finally, after a decade of marriage, she loaded her belongings in a U-Haul and never looked back. But as the legal battle over the divorce raged and Jim’s financial outlook grew precarious, he had a chance encounter with a long-haul trucker, a smooth-talking ex-con who said he could \"take care\" of Jim’s wife problem. In A Devil Went Down to Georgia (Pegasus Crime), award-winning writer Deb Miller Landau details the shocking events that followed Lita’s murder in 1987, including the surprising lack of evidence, racial bias in the justice system, and the international manhunt for Lita’s killer. Full of twists and turns, legal battles, and the McClinton family’s unrelenting dedication to justice, Landau's rigorous investigation is the first complete account of this tragic American crime. Landau will be joined in conversation by Kimberly A.C. Wilson, Executive Director of Hedgebrook.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nSteve Duda in Conversation With Jesse Robbins\n\nThursday, August 22 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nRiver Songs (Mountaineers Books) is rich with bracing, authentic, generous stories — writing that revels in language and spirit. Avoiding most of fly fishing’s clichés — the romantic elegies, the Moby-Dick-like conquests, the play-by-play detailing a \"victory\" over a fish — Steve Duda instead offers pieces that breathe lived experience, reveal vulnerabilities, and convey a broad perspective of what it means to have \"a long run with a tight crew.\" Duda is interested in what has been learned out there on the river: what is it about this \"ridiculous activity\" that connects us to this planet, makes us human, gives us hope? River Songs focuses on the in-between moments and the unexpected revelations — awe, fear, frustration, doubt, joy — that are as much a part of fishing as tying knots and chucking flies. Readers ride along with Duda in battered pickup trucks, fish \"between jobs,\" look longingly at unfished famous rivers while touring with a country-punk band, and wonder how a fishing trip led to getting a tooth pulled while being surrounded by trash-talking friends. They will find beauty, discovery, heartbreak, good dogs, and the wonder of nature within the expanse of Northwest landscapes and beyond. Duda will be joined in conversation by Jesse Robbins, Development Officer at WaterWatch of Oregon.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nKids' Storytime With Ana Velez\n\nSaturday, August 24 @ 10:30am (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nEveryone's heard of the three little pigs, but what about the three little guinea pigs? Way up in the Andes Mountains, Urku, Inti, and Nina have just finished building three new homes when a surprise visitor arrives. It's Fox, and being pigs, the guineas are quick to judge that he's up to no good, though he wears a stylish scarf and patiently calls, \"Guinea pigs, guinea pigs, come with me. I have something for your family.\" As young readers familiar with the traditional story will recall, many a pig has been tricked before, so it's not surprising that the trio wishes to huddle inside. What the guinea pigs don't see is how the animals are banding together to help them. In the end, it just might take the whole mountain of creatures to show them that things aren't always as they seem and traditional fairytale foes could actually be friends. Set in Andean South America, Ana Velez’s The Three Little Guinea Pigs and the Andean Fox (Page Street Kids) is a fresh, lighthearted twist on a classic tale which invites readers to challenge assumptions, embrace community, and trust in teamwork.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nIsmet Prcic in Conversation With Lidia Yuknavitch\n\nMonday, August 26 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nUnspeakable Home (Avid Reader Press/Simon & Schuster) is a stunningly original, stylistically brilliant, and brutally honest novel from an award-winning Bosnian refugee and writer who, decades after escaping his war-torn home country, looks back on his childhood, imploded relationships, and battles with addiction — offering powerful insight into the human cost of conflict. It’s been two years since our narrator divorced his beloved and lost his safest and most adoring home when he fled Bosnia as a teenager. The marriage couldn’t survive his brokenness, the trauma so entrenched and insidious that it became impossible to communicate to anyone outside of himself — even the person he loved most. But, as he writes in the first of many courageously candid fan letters to the comedian Bill Burr, he knows he must try. A linguistically adventurous, structurally ambitious, and emotionally brave odyssey, Ismet Prcic’s Unspeakable Home takes us through the memories and confessions of our refugee narrator as he reflects on his bomb-ravaged childhood, the implosion of his relationships, and an agonizing battle with alcoholism. As multiple narrators surface in fragments with increasingly tenuous connections to reality, Prcic unearths the psychological cost of exile and shame with a roving, kinetic energy and a sharp, searching sense of humor. What emerges is a vivid and poignant exploration of the stories we create to hide the deepest parts of our identity from ourselves, as well as a hard-won, life-affirming promise of redemption. Prcic will be joined in conversation by Lidia Yuknavitch, author of Thrust.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nDavid Daley\n\nWednesday, August 28 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nEqual parts Dark Money and Democracy in Chains, Antidemocratic (Mariner) is a riveting yet disturbing history of the fifty-year Republican plot to hijack voting rights in America, its profound implications for the 2024 presidential election, and the crucial role that Chief Justice John Roberts has played in determining how we vote. In 1981, a young lawyer, fresh out of Harvard law school, joined the Reagan administration’s Department of Justice, taking up a cause that had been fomenting in Republican circles for over a decade by that point. From his perch inside the Reagan DOJ, this lawyer would attempt to bring down one of the defining pieces of 20th century legislation — the Voting Rights Act. His name was John Roberts. Over thirty years later in 2013, these efforts by John Roberts and the conservative legal establishment culminated when Roberts, now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, wrote Shelby County vs. Holder, one of the most consequential decisions of modern jurisprudence. A dramatic move that gutted the Voting Rights Act, Roberts’s decision — dangerously premised on the flawed notion that racism was a thing of the past — emboldened right-wing, antidemocratic voting laws around the country immediately. No modern court decision has done more to hand elections to Republicans than Shelby. Now lauded investigative reporter David Daley reveals the urgent story of this plot to end the Voting Rights Act and encourage minority rule in their party’s favor. From the bowels of Reagan’s DOJ to the walls of the conservative Federalist Society to the moneyed Republican resources bankrolling restrictive voting laws today, Daley reveals a hidden history as sweeping as it is troubling. Through careful research and exhaustive reporting, he connects Shelby to a well-funded, highly-coordinated right-wing effort to erode the power of minority voters and Democrats at the ballot box — an effort that has grown stronger with each election cycle. In the process Roberts and his conservative allies have enabled fringe conservative theories about our elections with the potential to shape the 2024 election and topple the foundations of our democracy. Timely and alarming, Daley offers a powerful message that, while Shelby was the misguided end of the Voting Rights Act, it was also the beginning of something far darker.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nBrendan Shay Basham in Conversation With Theodore C. Van Alst Jr.\n\nThursday, August 29 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nSuffering the unbearable loss of his little brother, Kai, Damien heads as far south as his old truck and his legs will allow, landing in a fishing village beyond the reach of his past where he hopes to finally forget. But the village carries grief of its own. Mourning the death of a young woman from the community’s most powerful family, they do not trust this stranger new to their town. The object of gossip and suspicion, Damien is ignored by all except the dead woman’s mother, Ana María, who offers him a room and a job. Grateful for her kindness, Damien soon begins to fall under Ana María’s charismatic spell. But how long can he resist the rumors linking her and her daughter’s death? Or deny his strange kinship with one of Ana María’s surviving daughters, Marta, who knows too well the grief that follows the loss of a sibling — and who is driven by a fierce need for revenge? Swiftly, Damien finds himself caught in a power struggle between the brujas, a whirlwind battle that threatens to sweep the whole village out to sea. Resonant with the Diné creation story and the unshakable weight of the Long Walk — the forced removal of the Navajo from their land — Swim Home to the Vanished (Harper Perennial) is a mesmerizingly original tale that brilliantly, poignantly explores our capacity for grief and resilience and its lasting effects on the soul. Brendan Shay Basham’s haunting debut novel is inspired, in part, by Diné history and thought. Basham will be joined in conversation by Theodore C. Van Alst Jr., the Tilikum Professor and Chair of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University and author of Pour One for the Devil.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nAiden Thomas in Conversation With Tehlor Kay Mejia\n\nTuesday, September 3 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nAiden Thomas returns to the beloved world of The Sunbearer Trials in Celestial Monsters (Feiwel & Friends), a heart-stopping duology finale, in which three young semidioses travel through a dark monster-infested world, facing down chaotic Obsidian gods, in a quest to save their friends and return the sun to the sky. Teo never thought he could be a Hero. Now, he doesn't have a choice. The sun is gone, the Obsidian gods have been released from their prison, and chaos and destruction are wreaking havoc on Reino del Sol. All because Teo refused to sacrifice a fellow semidiós during the Sunbearer Trials. With the world plunged into perpetual night, Teo, his crush Aurelio, and his best friend Niya must journey to the dark wilderness of Los Restos, battling vicious monsters while dealing with guilt, trauma, and a (very distracting) burgeoning romance between Teo and Aurelio. Determined to rescue the captured semidioses and retrieve the Sol Stone, the trio races against the clock to return Sol and their protective light so order can be restored. Now the future of the whole world is in their hands. Thomas will be joined in conversation by Tehlor Kay Mejia, author of Sammy Espinoza's Last Review and We Set the Dark on Fire.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nScott Nadelson & Matt Young\n\nWednesday, September 4 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nScott Nadelson’s Trust Me (Forest Avenue Press) tells the story of a turbulent year in the life of Lewis Nelson and his daughter Skye, who spend their time together at the edge of a fragile wilderness in Western Oregon. As a last-ditch effort to save his marriage, Lewis — an East Coast suburban Jew who has run from his roots — buys a cabin on a wild and scenic river in the Cascade foothills; after the marriage falls apart, he moves to the woods and makes the long commute every morning to Salem, the state capital, where he works a tedious government job. Skye stays with him on weekends, leaving behind her middle-school friends, her cellular service, her cat, and her mom in exchange for ancient trees and clear water and moss-covered rocks. In 52 vignettes — one for each week of the year — that alternate between Lewis’s perspective and Skye’s, the novel traces their days foraging for mushrooms and searching for newts, arguing over jigsaw puzzles and confronting menacing neighbors, hosting skeptical visitors and taking city jaunts, finding pleasure in small moments of wonder and coping with devastating loss. By turns comic and heartbreaking, Trust Me is a study of the uneasy bond between a hapless father and his precocious daughter, of their love for a complex and changing landscape, of the necessity and precariousness of the relationships and places we cherish most.\n\nMatt Young’s End of Active Service (Bloomsbury) is a raw and rampaging debut novel from the author of the \"inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining\" (NYTBR) memoir Eat the Apple — examining the last phase of war for US veterans: returning home. What was it like? It's the only thing anyone wants to know about war — and the last thing Corporal Dean Pusey wants to talk about, at least not with one of these fat and happy civilians crowding the bar. Dean is two months free from the Marine Corps, and life back in his Indiana hometown is anything but peaceful. That's when the woman next to him offers to buy him a drink. Max is nice — gorgeous, funny, easy to talk to. Dean doesn't dare tell her about the sheep he took care of on his first deployment, only to watch it get torn to shreds by a pack of wild dogs; or the naked, shivering Iraqi teenager his platoon detained after an IED blast. He needs to leave all that behind and become a new person — the kind who sticks around when Max gets pregnant. He's white-knuckling it, trying to keep calm, and it's not easy. Harder still when his friend and comrade Ruiz starts showing up all over the place like he's been invited — like he didn't die a year ago. He has Max now, he has his baby daughter, River. He doesn't have time for ghosts. With his signature black humor, hard-eyed honesty, and stylistic ingenuity, Young delivers a novel that turns the typical war story on its head — beginning not with enlistment but with retirement, and locating the life-or-death stakes not in battle, but in the domestic theaters of fatherhood, family, forgiveness, and love.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition (Nadelson)\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition (Young)\n\nDaniel J. Levitin\n\nFriday, September 6 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nMusic is one of humanity’s oldest medicines. From the Far East to the Ottoman Empire, Europe to Africa and the pre-colonial Americas, many cultures have developed their own rich traditions for using sound and rhythm to ease suffering, promote healing, and calm the mind. In his latest work, neuroscientist and This Is Your Brain on Music author Daniel J. Levitin explores the curative powers of music, showing us how and why it is one of the most potent therapies today. He brings together, for the first time, the results of numerous studies on music and the brain, demonstrating how music can contribute to the treatment of a host of ailments, from neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, to cognitive injury, depression, and pain. Levitin is not your typical scientist — he is also an award-winning musician and composer, and through lively interviews with some of today’s most celebrated musicians, from Sting to Kent Nagano and Mari Kodama, he shares their observations as to why music might be an effective therapy, in addition to plumbing scientific case studies, music theory, and music history. The result is a work of dazzling ideas, cutting-edge research, and jubilant celebration. I Heard There Was a Secret Chord (W. W. Norton) highlights the critical role music has played in human biology, illuminating the neuroscience of music and its profound benefits for those both young and old.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nJoyce Maynard in Conversation With Laura Stanfill\n\nSunday, September 8 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nFrom bestselling author Joyce Maynard comes the eagerly anticipated follow-up to her beloved novel Count the Ways — a complex story of three generations of a family and its remarkable, resilient, indomitable matriarch, Eleanor. Following the death of her former husband, Cam, 54-year-old Eleanor has moved back to the New Hampshire farm where they raised three children to care for their brain-injured son, Toby, now an adult. Toby's older brother, Al, is married and living in Seattle with his wife; their sister, Ursula, lives in Vermont with her husband and two children. Although all appears stable, old resentments, anger, and bitterness simmer just beneath the surface. How the Light Gets In (William Morrow) follows Eleanor and her family through fifteen years (2010 to 2024) as their story plays out against a uniquely American backdrop and the events that transform their world (climate change, the January 6th insurrection, school violence) and shape their lives (later-life love, parental alienation, steadfast friendship). With her trademark sensitivity and insight, Maynard paints an indelible portrait of characters both familiar and new making their way over rough, messy, and treacherous terrain to find their way to what is, for each, a place to call \"home.\" Maynard will be joined in conversation by Laura Stanfill, publisher of Forest Avenue Press and author of Singing Lessons for the Stylish Canary.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nChris La Tray in Conversation With Sierra Crane Murdoch\n\nMonday, September 9 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nGrowing up in Montana, Chris La Tray always identified as Indian. While the representation of Indigenous people was mostly limited to racist depictions in toys and television shows, and despite the fact that his father fiercely denied any connection, he found Indians alluring, often recalling his grandmother’s consistent mention of their Chippewa heritage. When La Tray attended his grandfather’s funeral as a young man, he finally found himself surrounded by relatives who obviously were Indigenous. “Who were they?” he wondered, and “Why was I never allowed to know them?” Embarking on a deeply personal and revealing journey into his family’s past, he discovers a larger story of the complicated history of Indigenous communities — and the devastating effects of colonialism that continue to ripple through surviving generations. Combining diligent research and compelling conversations with Indigenous authors, activists, elders, and historians, La Tray follows a trail deep into the heart of his community — and himself. And as he comes to embrace his full identity, he eventually seeks enrollment with the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, joining their 158-year-long struggle for federal recognition. Both personal and historical, Becoming Little Shell (Milkweed) is a testament to the power of storytelling, to family and legacy, and to finding home. Infused with candor, heart, wisdom, and an abiding love for a place and a people, La Tray’s remarkable journey — and the journey of his tribe — is both revelatory and redemptive. La Tray will be joined in conversation by Sierra Crane Murdoch, author of Yellow Bird: Oil, Murder, and a Woman's Search for Justice in Indian Country.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nColleen Houck\n\nTuesday, September 10 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nFrom Colleen Houck, Tiger’s Tale (Blackstone) reimagines the epic fantasy that delighted readers with romance, danger, and magic, leaving them breathless and yearning for more. The Tiger’s Curse takes many forms....Anastasia and Verusha Stepanov are the tsar’s only children, heirs to the prosperous and sprawling Kievian Empire. Headstrong and fierce, the twins have long scorned their father’s opulent palace and the diplomatic obligations that come with it, preferring to train with the Royal Guard and dream of a soldier’s life beyond the palace walls. But with their father lost in the recent war and their once indomitable mother succumbing to illness, the young women know that one of them must soon ascend the throne, make a politically advantageous marriage, and begin producing heirs. Yet the succession is far from clear, as both would prefer the path of the second born: head the Royal Guard, travel the far reaches of the empire, and seek out a destiny of her own making. As their beloved mother’s condition worsens, the sisters grow more desperate, seeking any healer who might give her more time. But when a stranger arrives offering another option, the sisters refuse his proposal and banish the strange man. As he departs, the stranger unleashes a devastating curse that sends Veru and Stacia fleeing their home on an adventure beyond anything they ever imagined.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nCharlotte Shane in Conversation With Lydia Kiesling\n\nWednesday, September 11 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nIn her early twenties, Charlotte Shane quit her women's studies graduate program to devote herself to sex work because it was a way to devote herself to men. Her lifelong curiosity about male lust, love, selfishness, and social capital dovetailed with her own insatiable desire for intimacy to sustain a long career in escorting, with unexpectedly poignant results. Shane uses her personal and professional history to examine how men and women struggle in their attempts at romantic and sexual bonding, no matter how true their intentions. As she takes stock of her relationships — with clients, with her father, with friends, with married men, and later, with her own husband — she tells a candid and haunting tale of love, marriage, and (in)fidelity, as seen through the eyes of the perpetual \"other woman.\" Braiding the personal and the universal, Shane's memoir, An Honest Woman (Simon & Schuster), is a merciless and moving love letter to straight men and an indictment of habitual dishonesty, a condemnation of every social constraint acting on heterosexual unions, and a hopeful affirmation of the possibility for true connection between men and women. Shane will be joined in conversation by Lydia Kiesling, author of Mobility and The Golden State.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nSasha Abramsky\n\nSunday, September 15 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nDonald Trump’s November 2016 electoral victory was the beginning of four years of demagogy, presidential name-calling, and — ten months into a pandemic — an incitement to violence that led a mob of thousands to descend on the Capitol in Washington, DC. Fueled by suspicion, conspiracy, and bigotry, a faction of Americans had decided to seize control. But the biggest effect of this right-wing wave may not have been on our national politics, but on the local governments of communities around the country. In Chaos Comes Calling (Bold Type Books), Sasha Abramsky investigates the empowerment of the far right over the past few years, stoked by the Trump presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic. He tells the parallel stories of two communities, Shasta County, California and Sequim, Washington, where toxic alliances of QAnoners, anti-vaxxers, Christian nationalists, militia supporters, and other denizens of the far right have worked to take control of the levers of power. The trajectories of both communities expose the stark divisions and extremism that have come to define our political landscape over the past decade, and offer revealing glimpses of what the future may hold. While Sequim ultimately recalibrated in 2021, returning to rationality, Shasta County has descended further into a climate of intolerance and toxic divisiveness. Chaos Comes Calling vividly captures both the regressive forces gaining momentum all over the country and the tireless efforts of citizens determined to organize against them.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nAmie Kaufman in Conversation With Aiden Thomas\n\nWednesday, September 18 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nMagic and sacrifice will collide as lovers and gods, enemies and allies vie for the fate of the world in Amie Kaufman’s The Heart of the World (Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers), the heart-pounding sequel to The Isles of the Gods, which Stephanie Garber called \"deliciously diabolical and full of heart.\" When Selly and Leander began their treacherous voyage to the Isles of the Gods, the captain's daughter and the playboy prince were strangers. But amid talk of war and a deadly attack on their ship, the unthinkable happened. They fell in love. Leander's ritual at the island temple was meant to prevent a war between the gods. Instead, it nearly cost him his life, and drew the goddess Barrica back from exile. Now, as her Messenger, Leander is imbued with her deadly magic, and only Selly's presence can stop it from consuming him. But Barrica wasn't the only immortal roused from sleep. The God of Risk, Macean, was awakened by an enemy all thought dead, and across the sea he's calling for war. The fight to save their world will take Selly and Leander from the gilded ballroom of the royal palace to the hallowed halls of an ancient library. Battle lines will be drawn, and bonds will break. With the wrath of gods and the machinations of power-hungry rulers straining their loyalties, can their love withstand the trials that await them?

Thanks to her lies, she’s landed the life of her dreams, complete with a safe husband and two adoring children who will never know the terror that was routine in her own childhood. If her buried anxiety threatens to breach the surface, Clove (if that is really her name) focuses on finding the right supplement, the right gratitude meditation. But when she receives a letter from a women’s prison in California, her past comes screeching into the present, entangling her in a dangerous game with memory and the people she thought she had outrun. As we race between her precarious present-day life in Portland, Oregon and her childhood in a Waikiki high-rise with her mother and father, Clove is forced to finally unravel the defining day of her life. How did she survive that day, and what will it take to end the cycle of violence? Will the truth undo her, or could it ultimately save her?

A Kid from Marlboro Road (Seven Stories) opens at a wake where \"Kneeney,\" as his mother calls him, takes in the death of his beloved grandfather, Pop, a larger-than-life figure to him. The overflowing crowd includes sandhogs in their muddy work boots, old Irish biddies in black dresses, and cops in uniform, along with the family in mourning. There’s an open casket, the first time he’s seen a dead person. He watches it all, writing his observations for school projects, not yet realizing how this world defines and explains who he is and will be. His older brother Tommy has no patience for rules and domesticities; his father is emotionally elsewhere. Kneeney knows he’s the best thing his mother's got, though her sadness envelops them both. Stories cascade between the prior generation’s colorful origins in the Bronx and Hell's Kitchen, and the softer world of Gibson, the town on Long Island where the family lives now. There are scenes in the Rockaways, at Belmont Race Track, and in Montauk. Out of individual struggles a collective warmth emerges, a certain kind of American story, raucous and joyous.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nDanielle Walker in Conversation With Michelle Tam\n\nWednesday, September 25 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nIn this practical, time-saving guide to meal prepping and menu planning, Danielle Walker — beloved author of the Against All Grain series — removes all the guess work from your daily effort to get food on the table.

In the process, they’ve not only entrenched dictatorships and spread kleptocratic networks, but the’'ve secretly guided U.S. policy without the rest of America even being aware. And now, some of them have begun turning their sights on American democracy itself. These Americans are known as foreign lobbyists, and many of them spent years ushering dictatorships directly into the halls of Washington, all while laundering the reputations of the most heinous, repressive regimes in the process. These foreign lobbyists include figures like Ivy Lee, the inventor of the public relations industry — a man who whitewashed Mussolini, opened doors to the Soviets, and advised the Nazis on how to sway American audiences. They include people like Paul Manafort, who invented lobbying as we know it — and who then took his talents to autocrats from Ukraine to the Philippines, and then back to the White House. And they now include an increasing number of Americans elsewhere: in law firms and consultancies, among PR specialists and former lawmakers, and even within think tanks and universities. In Foreign Agents (St. Martin’s), Casey Michel shines a light on these foreign lobbyists as some of them — after decades of installing dictators and corrupting American policy — embark on their next mission: to end America's democratic experiment, once and for all.

In a compact and quick-read format, Missing Music collects the latest narratives from Brennan’s field-recording treks. This edition features a greater emphasis on storytelling and an even greater abundance of photos from his wife, Italian-Rwandan photographer/filmmaker Marilena Umuhoza Delli. Together, they meet the elderly shamans of the world’s most musical language, Taa, a tongue that sadly is dying, with fewer than 2,500 speakers left. The duo traveled the most remote roads of Botswana to find the formerly nomadic people now relegated to small desert towns. In Azerbaijan, Brennan and Delli ascended to the mountainous Iranian border to record centenarians in scattered villages of the Talysh minority, where the world’s oldest man reportedly reached the age of 168. The result is the only record ever released to feature the voices of singers over 100 years of age. Among other tales, Brennan also updates the saga of the Sheltered Workshop Singers following COVID, including the tragic deterioration of his sister, Jane. Arising from the more than 40 records that Brennan has produced over the past decade from underrepresented nations such as Comoros, Djibouti, São Tomé, Romania, South Sudan, Suriname, and Cambodia, Missing Music serves as the newest suite in the multiverse symphony of the world’s most ignored corners — the places where countries expire and the “forgotten” live.

In the summer of 2016, a divisive presidential election was underway, and a new breed of right-wing rage was on the rise. Emily Witt, who would soon publish her first book on sex in the digital age, had recently quit antidepressants for a more expansive world of psychedelic experimentation. From her apartment in Brooklyn, she began to catch glimpses of the clandestine nightlife scene thrumming around her. In Health and Safety (Pantheon), Witt charts her immersion into New York City’s dance music underground. Witt would come to lead a double life. By day she worked as a journalist, covering gun violence, climate catastrophes, and the rallies of right-wing militias. And by night she pushed the limits of consciousness in hollowed-out office spaces and warehouses to music that sounded like the future. But no counterculture, no matter how utopian, could stave off the squalor of American politics and the cataclysm of 2020. Affectionate yet never sentimental, Health and Safety is a lament for a broken relationship, for a changed nightlife scene, and for New York City just before the fall. Sparing no one — least of all herself — Witt offers her life as a lens onto an era of American delirium and dissolution. Witt will be joined in conversation by Lydia Kiesling, author of Mobility and The Golden State.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nChuck Palahniuk\n\nTuesday, October 8 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nFrom Chuck Palahniuk, the bestselling author of Fight Club, comes a dark, satirical parable about a string of mysterious high school disappearances, the seedy underbellies of billionaires, and the tough choices we make in the face of an uncertain future. In Shock Induction (Simon & Schuster), the best and brightest students at a seemingly reputable high school are disappearing. Every day it seems another overachiever is lost to an apparent suicide. But something far more sinister is lurking beneath the surface. These kids have been under surveillance since birth, monitored and measured by an online service called “Greener Pastures.” It’s here, in Greener Pastures, that billionaires observe and recruit the next generation of talent. The highest test scores, the best grades, and the most niche extracurriculars just might land these teenagers an enticing offer at auction. A couple billion dollars in exchange for the remainder of your life and intellectual labor sounds like a pretty fair deal — doesn’t it? In a high school only Palahniuk could imagine, students must choose between the risk of following their dreams or the security of money and a lifetime of servitude to the world’s wealthiest and most elite — but how much of a choice do they truly have?\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nGreg Barnhisel in Conversation With Christopher Zinn\n\nFriday, October 11 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nAlthough his impact on twentieth-century American cultural life was profound, few people know the story of Norman Holmes Pearson. Pearson’s life embodied the Cold War alliances among US artists, scholars, and the national-security state that coalesced after World War II. As a Yale professor and editor, he helped legitimize the study of American culture and shaped the public’s understanding of literary modernism — significantly, the work of women poets such as Hilda Doolittle and Gertrude Stein. At the same time, as a spy, recruiter, and cultural diplomat, he connected the academy, the State Department, and even the CIA. In Code Name Puritan (University of Chicago Press), Greg Barnhisel maps Pearson’s life, from his childhood injury that led to a visible, permanent disability to his wartime counterespionage work neutralizing the Nazis’ spy network to his powerful role in the cultural and political heyday sometimes called the American Century. Written with clarity and informed by meticulous research, Barnhisel’s revelatory portrait of Pearson details how his unique experiences shaped his beliefs about the American character, from the Puritans onward. Barnhisel will be joined in conversation by Christopher Zinn, former Executive Director of the Oregon Council for the Humanities.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nKeiko Lane in Conversation With Lidia Yuknavitch\n\nSunday, October 13 @ 3pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nIn 1991, sixteen-year-old activist Keiko Lane joined the Los Angeles chapters of Queer Nation and ACT UP. Their members protested legislation aimed at dismantling rights for LGBTQ people, people living with HIV, and immigrants while fighting for needle-exchange programs, reproductive justice, safer-sex education, hospice funding, and the right to die with dignity. At the same time, the activists were a queer chosen family of friends and lovers who took care of one another in sickness and in health. Sometimes they helped each other die. By the time Lane turned twenty-two, most had died of AIDS. In her evocative memoir, Blood Loss (Duke University Press), Lane weaves together love stories and afterlives of queer resistance and survival against the landscape of the Rodney King Rebellion, the movement for queer rights, and the censorship of queer artists and sexualities.

The pursuit of happiness, as defined by settlers and enshrined in the American Dream, has brought us to the brink: emotionally, spiritually, socially, and as a species. We stand on a precipice, the future unknown. But Indigenous people carry forward the values that humans need to survive and thrive. In Journey to Eloheh, Randy and Edith Woodley help readers transform their worldviews and lifestyles by learning the ten values of the Harmony Way. These ten values, held in common across at least forty-five Indigenous tribes and nations, can lead us toward true well-being: harmony, respect, accountability, history, humor, authenticity, equality, friendship, generosity, and balance. By learning, converting to, and cultivating everyday practices of Eloheh — a Cherokee word meaning harmony and peace — we have a chance at building well-being and a sustainable culture. In this riveting account of their own journeys toward deepening their indigeneity and embodying harmony, Edith, an activist-farmer, and Randy, a scholar, author, teacher, and wisdom-keeper, help readers learn the lifeways of the Harmony Way. The journey to Eloheh holds promise for all of us, Indigenous or not. We know the Western worldview is at odds with a sustainable Earth, a just common life, and personal well-being. Together we can convert to another way of living — one that recognizes the Earth as sacred, sees all creation as related, and offers ancestral values as the way forward to a shared future.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nThom Hartmann\n\nTuesday, October 15 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nThe widening wealth gap is all too familiar to many Millennials and Gen Zers, especially when home ownership and the lack of debt seem like faraway fantasies. And it’s no surprise when they only hold about 4.6% of the country’s wealth while Boomers held 22% at around the same age. So what happened to the promise of the American Dream? In his new, final entry of his celebrated Hidden History Series, The Hidden History of the American Dream: The Demise of the Middle Class — And How to Rescue Our Future (Berrett-Koehler), Thom Hartmann uncovers the rise of the American middle class through the progressive policies of FDR, through to its downfall with the increasing privatization and economic deregulations of the Reagan era. He also explores potential solutions including wealth and inheritance taxes to lessen economic inequality, supporting unions through increasing labor rights, and renationalizing public spaces and transportation. The American Dream often remains just a dream for many, but Hartmann’s new book highlights what needs to be done to take it back and help make it a reality for us all.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nJohn Larison\n\nThursday, October 17 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nA young boy and his older sisters find themselves suddenly and utterly alone, orphaned in an abandoned fishing village. Their food supplies dwindling, they set out across a breathtaking yet treacherous wilderness in search of the last of their people. Down the coast, raiders deliver the children's mother, along with the rest of their human cargo, to the last port city of a waning empire. Determined to reunite with her family, she plots her escape — while her fellow captives plan open revolt. At the center of power in this crumbling city, a young scholar inherits his father's business and position of privilege, along with the burden of his debts. As the empire's elite prepare to flee to a new utopia across the sea, he must decide where his allegiance lies. With a rapidly changing climate shifting the sands beneath their feet, these three paths converge in a struggle for the future of humanity — who will inherit what remains and who gets to tell its story. At once a sweeping survival story, an epic of the distance future, and a post-apocalyptic vision of hope and optimism, The Ancients (Viking) weaves a multilayered narrative about human resilience, hope, and stewardship of our world for future generations — from John Larison, author of Whiskey When We’re Dry.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nSally & Brian Dutra\n\nSaturday, October 26 @ 3pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nA new early chapter book series starring a lovable vampire who's just trying to fit in: Frankie D and his family have just moved from Transylvania, looking for a fresh start. Where Frankie is from, the school day began at midnight and ended at dawn. Now in America, Frankie and his family must adjust their sleep schedule, train to be out in the sun, and strictly adhere to a vegan, zero-blood diet. Not only that, Frankie has to navigate school as the \"new kid\" and keep his vampire identity secret from other humans. A tall order for a deathly pale, fanged fourth-grader with a three-legged wolf as a pet! Sally and Brian Dutra's Frankie D, Vegan Vampire (Kids Can Press) offers a whole new take on what it means to be an outsider. With so many playful twists on vampire tropes, a compelling plot (with a cliffhanger ending!), and loads of deadpan humor, their new chapter book is sure to have enormous appeal for early readers.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nMelissa Ludtke in Conversation With Elizabeth Mehren\n\nSunday, October 27 @ 3pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nWhile sportswriters rushed into Major League Baseball locker rooms to talk with players, MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn barred the lone woman from entering along with them. That reporter, 26-year-old Sports Illustrated reporter Melissa Ludtke, charged Kuhn with gender discrimination, and after the lawyers argued Ludtke v. Kuhn in federal court, she won. Her 1978 groundbreaking case affirmed her equal rights, and the judge’s order opened the doors for several generations of women to be hired in sports media. Locker Room Talk (Rutgers) is Ludtke’s gripping account of being at the core of this globally covered case that churned up ugly prejudices about the place of women in sports. Kuhn claimed that allowing women into locker rooms would violate his players’ “sexual privacy.” Late-night television comedy sketches mocked her, as newspaper cartoonists portrayed her as a sexy, buxom looker who wanted to ogle the naked athletes’ bodies. She weaves these public perspectives throughout her vivid depiction of the court drama overseen by Judge Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to serve on the federal bench. She recounts how her lawyer, F.A.O. “Fritz” Schwarz, employed an ingenious legal strategy that persuaded Judge Motley to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause in giving Ludtke access identical to that of her male counterparts. Locker Room Talk is both an inspiring story of one woman’s determination to do a job dominated by men and an illuminating portrait of a defining moment for women’s rights. Ludtke will be joined in conversation by Elizabeth Mehren, author of I Lived to Tell the World.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nNora Lange in Conversation With Kimberly King Parsons\n\nWednesday, October 30 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nJoanne and Bernadette Fareown are raised on their family farm in rural Illinois, keenly affected by their parents’ volatile relationship and mounting financial debt, haunted by the cursed history of the women in their family. Largely left to their own devices, the sisters educate themselves on Greek mythology, feminism, and Virginia Woolf, realizing they must find unique ways to cope in these antagonistic conditions, questioning the American Dream as the rest of the country abandons their community in crisis. As Jo and Bernie’s imaginative solutions for escape come up short against their parents’ realities, the family leaves their farm for Chicago, where Joanne — free-spirited, reckless, and unable to tame her inner violence — rebels in increasingly desperate ways. After her worst breakdown yet, Jo goes into exile in Deadhorse, Alaska, and it is up to Bernadette to use all she’s learned from her sister to revive a sense of hope against the backdrop of a failing world. With her debut novel, Us Fools (Two Dollar Radio), Nora Lange has crafted a rambunctious, ambitious, and heart-rending portrait of two idiosyncratic sisters, determined to persevere despite the worst that capitalism and their circumstances have to throw at them. Lange will be joined in conversation by Kimberly King Parsons, author of We Were the Universe.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition"
