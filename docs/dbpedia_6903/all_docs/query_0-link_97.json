        "text": "I finished adding more pictures and information for some of the Veterans below. Please take a close look and read about the requests if you are one of the relatives. I have a lot of dead-ends and missing information for many of these Veterans who gave their lives in the service of our country.\n\nFor a number of these Veterans I have no other family connected pictures or contacts which leaves me at a standstill. If family members don't come forward - what I have posted here is all that will be in the history book about those particular Veterans, which is not much.\n\nI know it will take you time to go through this latest feature but I sure hope you will and if you are a relative of one of these Veterans - won't you please take some time to help me out with any pictures and information you may have?\n\nEven if you have nothing please e-mail me. I may have questions you can answer which will save me a lot of time doing research elsewhere.\n\nIf you can help with Veterans featured here please email David Kusel right away\n\nBy adding more family and other connected pictures and information to the Veterans below who paid the ultimate price...maybe it will help someone realize they are related to a Veteran which will hopefully encourage them to dig in their old pictures to see if they might have something I'm looking for.\n\nThe main idea in featuring these Veterans is to hopefully reach out to someone who will have pictures and information about them.\n\nWhen something is lost/destroyed or a loved one has passed away, that is when we realize how important they were and how much we'll miss them.\n\nIf you listened to some of the interviews of the survivors of the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado the first thing that was brought up, after they said how fortunate they and their family members were to have survived the storm, was if they were able to find and save their PICTURES...even with most of the communications down they did not say how they missed their facebook/twitter accounts...it was the pictures that they probably seldom looked at but were a major concern in saving.\n\nFormerly known as Decoration Day - Memorial Day originated after the American Civil War to commemorate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died in that war.\n\nBy the 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who had died while in the military service.\n\nFor many years I have been asking for pictures and information about the 1000+ Manning Veterans to use in a future Manning Veterans' history book.\n\nSadly, not even a lot of family members are coming forward with that information about the deceased Veterans in their families.\n\nMany people proudly attend the Memorial Day and Veterans' Day events...just 2 days out of the year this is done.\n\nWhile these 2 National Holidays are very important...we need to do a much better job in preserving the memory and in honoring those who have served our country.\n\nThe Veterans who need to be honored at a higher level are those who died while serving their country.\n\nOne way to do that is to put their faces on the cover of the Manning Veterans' history book.\n\nUnfortunately there are quite a few of those Veterans I have no picture or only a copy made from the 1981 Centennial book or a newspaper clipping.\n\nThe only way to get a good quality image of these Veterans is for friends and relatives to look for original photos of these and other Veterans and bring them forward so I can scan them.\n\nBelow you'll see various images of most of the Veterans who paid the ultimate price...Most of these scans I have did NOT come from family members. If it wasn't for friends and neighbors who had these pictures and came forward I would not have as many as I do.\n\nSo if you are a relative or maybe someone whose parents or grandparents were friends of any of these Veterans please take a look in that old scrapbook or box of pictures...you may have exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nEven if I have a good quality image for some of these Veterans you may have other poses and images of these Veterans...I'd like to scan them too.\n\nPLEASE take some time to go through this list of names/pix below and see if you can help out with this small part of the Veterans' book project.\n\nThanks - Dave\n\nEmil Ewoldt\n\nin whose honor the Manning American Legion Post #22 was named after\n\nKIA during the Battle of Argonne Forest WWI\n\nScanned image from the Veterans' section of the 1981 Manning Centennial book\n\nI'm showing a blown up view of what a scan made from text books look like - with all the dot patterns.\n\nThis picture will need to be digitally cleaned up - which takes time\n\nbut it is a much better image to use in the Veterans' book\n\nfortunately Russ & Linda (Meggers) Frank had this photo and let me scan it.\n\nThis was a picture-postcard sent to Amanda (Mundt) Puck - a friend of Emil\n\nA scan I made from Orval Fink's collection...years ago he took a picture of the large portrait image made of Emil...The original image was recently dug out of the Legion attic by Gary Knueven and is now on display in the Legion hall.\n\nAlbert Dethlefs\n\nServed several months in the St. Mihiel, France, sector\n\nbecame ill and died of the Spanish Influenza on September 14, 1918\n\nAlbert's sister was Lillian Mohr\n\nI have NO pictures of Albert - need original photos to scan\n\nscan made from the 1981 book\n\nWWI plaque of honor placed in the city park for Albert\n\nWilliam Wulf\n\nHe saw action at the Verdun front\n\nthen returned to the US and died February 18, 1922, at the Fitsimmons Hospital in Denver\n\nI have NO pictures of William\n\nWWI plaque of honor placed in the city park for William\n\nFred Passick\n\nBecame ill from diphtheria near Brest, France, and spent time in a hospital\n\nhe returned to the front and was KIA August 2, 1918.\n\nPhoto from Marian (Arp) Knueven\n\nscan from the 1981 history book\n\nPhoto from Jan Lahndorf\n\nBack Row: Anna Petersen, Henry, August, Detlef, Catharina Arp\n\nFront: Mary Schumann, Otto, Sophia, Minnie Hagedorn, Fred\n\nMarian Knueven's mother was Catharina, a sister to Fred Passick.\n\nMarian's brothers were Lyle & Norman Arp.\n\nMarian & Joe Knueven had 4 children: Karen Price, Jan Lahndorf, Gary, & Deb Knueven\n\nLouie Rowedder\n\ndied October 21, 1918, as an infantryman while serving with the American Expeditionary forces in France\n\nPhoto recently provided by Louie's nephew, Robert Hansen of Manning\n\nscan from the 1981 history book\n\nThere were 12 children born to William & Anna (Kall) Rowedder\n\nHerman born August 19, 1879, and died December 12, 1957, in Aspinwall\n\nWillie 1881 to 1954\n\nHenry born January 29, 1883, and died in 1926 in Manning\n\nEmma Langbehn 1885 to 1962\n\nLena Wiese 1888 to January 1927\n\nAmelia Schroeder 1890 to December 8, 1963\n\nHilda Hansen 1892 to ?\n\nJohn born March 18, 1894, and died January 1965, in Iowa\n\nLouie 1896 to 1918\n\nElla who died in infancy\n\nJulius born April 30, 1901, and died June 1970, in Manning\n\nLaura Kasperbauer 1904 to 1951 Louie's brother, John's, family\n\nBack: LeRoy, Gilbert, Berdine Ehrichs, Virgil\n\nFront: John, Joan Mohr, Ella (Mordhorst) John and Ella Rowedder spent their entire lives in the Manning area.

They later purchased a farm in that area and lived there until their retirement to Manning in 1953.

Stuhr, was born in 1859 in Luhrachau, Schleswig, Germany, and died in 1929 in Manning. Emma Juels was born in 1872 in Schleswig, Germany, and died in 1941 in Manning. They are both buried in the Manning Cemetery. They had one son Bernhardt and an adopted daughter Mildred Stuhr. Mildred's birth mother was Mary (Petersen) Klue.\n\nClaus came to America and first settled in Minden, Iowa, where he and his brother owned and operated Stuhr Brother's Hardware. They sold hardware, furniture, coffins, and agricultural implements. Claus later returned to Germany to bring Emma Juels (his wife to be), her brother Gustav, and his wife to be, Maria Bruhn, to America. They were married in Minden and settled there. Gus and Maria later moved to Avoca, Iowa, and raised ten children. Claus and Emma moved to the Manning area and purchased a farm three miles north and one and a half miles east of Manning. Vernon Rohe purchased this farm from Mildred (Stuhr) Lyden in 1951.\n\nBernhardt was born in 1895 at Minden, Iowa. He died in 1918 from the Spanish Influenza Epidemic while at Camp Dodge, Iowa, where he had served in the Army for one month. He is buried in the Manning Cemetery. Mildred was born in 1905 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. She died in 1991 and is buried in the Manning Cemetery. Claus and Emma were Mildred's great-aunt and uncle.\n\nShe married Vincent Lyden, Sr., son of Charles E. Lyden who was a Manning photographer. Mildred and Vincent had three children. Vincent, Jr. lives in Turner, Oregon. His wife, Lillian, is deceased. Marianne (deceased) married Harold Addington of Concordia, Missouri. They had one adopted son Dan who lives in Chicago, Illinois. Jeanne and her husband Ronald Farley live in Aplington, Iowa. They have three children, Sherie, Ronald Jr., and Diane.\n\nMildred and Vincent Lyden owned an acreage where the present Lutheran church is located. During their younger years they had a large truck gardening business and sold their produce to local stores and the public. Vincent worked as a lineman for the Manning Electric Company.\n\nHenry Juels came to America at the age of seventy after his wife died to live with his daughter Emma. Albert Juels came to America in 1902. He was a nephew of Emma. Albert married Minnie Petersen who was born in South Dakota. Minnie was a niece of Claus Stuhr and a sister to Mildred Stuhr's birth-mother Mary (Petersen) Klue. Albert and Minnie had six children: Hazel, Vera, Arnold, Harold, (all deceased), and Edna who lives in California.\n\nMildred (Stuhr) with her husband Vincent Lyden\n\nMildred Stuhr\n\nMildred Stuhr & Edna Vollstedt\n\nJulius Vinke\n\nBecame ill from the measles & mumps on the ship half way to Europe and died October 1, 1918.\n\nI have NO pictures of Julius\n\nWWI plaque of honor placed in the city park for Julius\n\nA proclamation I found in the Manning Monitor microfilm\n\nscan from the 1981 history book\n\nRobert E.

Heinicke officiating. Organist was Dorothy Kusel. Interment was in Manning Cemetery with Terry Lake, Randall Lake, Nathan Lake, Richard Tibben, Vernon Ehlers and Paul Ehlers as casketbearers. The Ohde Funeral Home in Manning was in charge of arrangements.\n\nPauline, daughter of Gustav and Anna (Fischer) Ress, was born September, 25, 1897, in Lincoln Township, Audubon County, Iowa. She was baptized on October 10, 1897 at Trinity Lutheran Church in Lincoln Township, and on May 7, 1911, she was confirmed in the Lutheran faith at that church. She attended the German elementary school at Trinity Lutheran Church.\n\nOn December 5, 1923, she was united in marriage with Eustace Lee Lake at the Lutheran Church in Man­ning. Pauline and Eustace made their home in Man­ning, where Eustace was in the hatchery and feed business, and later owned and operated Manning Heating and Sheet Metal. Eustace died on August 5, 1967, and a year later Pauline moved to the Manning Plaza. She passed away at the Plaza on Sunday, September 6, 1981, at the age of 83 years, 11 months and 11 days.\n\nIn addition to her hus­band, Pauline was preceded in death by two children, Carl Leroy Lake in 1934, and Robert Lee Lake in 1945; also by a grandson, Michael Jon Lake, and one brother and one sister.\n\nShe is survived by three children: Margaret Pauline, Mrs. Leroy Hansen of Bel­lingham, Washington, Dorothy Anna, Mrs. Vernon Larsen, of Audubon, Eu­stace Roger (Junior) Lake, of Story City, Iowa, and one stepson, George William Lake, of Bellingham, Wash­ington. Also surviving are 8 grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren; 5 sisters and 2 brothers: Mrs. William (Ella) Asmus, Audubon, Mrs. Herman (Ida) Joachim­sen, Manning, Anna Hole­scher, Perry, Mrs. William (Edna) Hansen, Manilla, Mrs. Rockley (Norma) Wen­zel, Frazee, Minnesota, Hugo and Emil Ress of Manning; as well as nieces, nephews, cousins and other relatives and friends.\n\nPauline was a member of the Zion Lutheran Church in Manning and a member of the Dorcas Society. Pauline was also a Gold Star Mother.\n\nEustace Roger Lake, Jr\n\nMargaret (Lake) Hansen\n\nMarch 20, 1941, Lake Hatchery ad in the Monitor\n\nEarl H.

I have a lot of pictures thanks to Michele (Mohr) Olney and Ardith (David) Lage.\n\nDale Thomas Mohr, Donald Francis Mohr - in front of the Mohr home September 1946.\n\nArnold Musfeldt\n\nKIA in France on November 26, 1944\n\nPhoto from Lola (Hansen) Ahrendsen\n\nscan from the 1981 history book\n\nGolden Wedding Anniversary, Katie & William Musfeldt February 29, 1958\n\nThis picture came from the Jessie (Stribe) Nissen collection that Bob Nissen has.\n\nI assume these were Arnold's parents. In Arnold's writeup in the Veteran section of the 1981 Manning Centennial book it only says Arnold was the \"son of Mr. & Mrs. William Musfeldt of Lincoln Township\"\n\nThe Musfeldt families were big back then so there may have been several William Musfeldts, and why I need more help with family connections and pictures.\n\nUnfortunately these vague histories were written that way years ago, leaving off the wife's first name, many times her maiden name...even in obituaries. This is why we need to continue to collect and preserve our history and get the \"proper\" facts written down and not use the vague \"Mr. & Mrs.\" or first initials \"Mr. & Mrs. W. Musfeldt\" type poor historical identifications.\n\nWhen I find obituaries and other types of documents, or history books poorly written with these vague IDs I will try to find the full names and then change those original documents to the full information. Not doing so now will make it even more difficult in the future for genealogists and historians to figure out exactly who these \"abbreviated\" people are.\n\nErnest J. Nissen\n\nKIA on a bombing mission over Munich, Germany, June 6, 1944\n\nI have 1 picture of Ernest in uniform.\n\nscan from the 1981 history book\n\nErnie Nissen MHS 1935 In the 1981 Centennial book write-up about Ernest it mentions him as the son of E.C. Nissen and exactly what I was mentioning under the Musfeldt feature above. It is situations like this that take me extra time to figure out what the initials stand for and which family is connected.\n\nIf you are older than me or are related to Ernest you may say to yourself, \"why I know who E.C. is\" but it doesn't help me if you don't contact me and tell me.\n\nSo then I have to read through obituaries, look in the Manning Cemetery records, hope there is something written in the 1981 Centennial books, or I have to call someone which all takes me a lot of extra time.\n\nSo to give you and idea of what I have do to \"Sherlok Holmes\" many of the pictures I work with, here are some pictures of Nissens that I know the names and connections but will intentionally leave that information off for now.\n\nSee if you can figure out who they are and their family connections.\n\nThese pictures came from various sources, and not all were Nissen family members.\n\nLeroy Paulsen\n\nKIA in Germany, November 10, 1944\n\nI have no pictures at all of Leroy\n\nLeroy was the son of Pete & Cora (Weavers) Paulsen.

BUT this is only one part of the equation...Then I have to get family background and the military information to go along with the pictures. This is very difficult to do if no family members come forward and help me.\n\nThe Manning Veterans' history book is not just a book about those Veterans who served in action or overseas. If you are/were connected to the Manning area and served in any branch of the military, National Guard, etc we want your story and pictures...BUT it probably won't happen if those living Veterans don't come forward or the relatives of Veterans who have passed away don't come forward.\n\nI have tried nearly every possible way to encourage Veterans to submit their stories. I will continue to do so for the time being but eventually I'll have to set a deadline. Once that happens you'll no longer be able to become part of a very unique community military history book.\n\nPlease don't delay any longer and start digging out those pictures and writing down your military story.\n\nIf you can help with Veterans featured here please email David Kusel right away\n\nBack to Veterans' promotion page"
