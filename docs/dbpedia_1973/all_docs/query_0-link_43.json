        "text": "The lyrics of \"Mulaqat Ho Gaye\" by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan showcase the feeling of the inevitable end of a relationship. The song is about a couple who have decided to end their relationship and move on. The first few lines of the song are repeated multiple times, highlighting the fact that the separation has happened from one person's side. The singer accepts the truth that someone he/she was scared of has separated from them. The lines, \"Un Key Liye Koi Na Koi Baat Ho Gai\" signify that the person has moved on and might have found someone else.\n\nThe second stanza highlights the positive side of the separation. The singer mentions that it's a new revelation to see himself/herself in the mirror. Moreover, \"Ainaa Dekhne Mein Nayi Baat Ho Gai\" could also mean that the person feels a sense of freedom after the separation. The third stanza signifies that the separation is just a small event in the grand scheme of things. The couple will ultimately meet on the day of judgment, signifying that the separation might be difficult to handle for the time being, but something greater awaits them."
