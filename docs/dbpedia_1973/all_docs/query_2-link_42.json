        "text": "A collection of previously unreleased recordings by the legendary qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is set to be released on September 20, marking more than 27 years since his passing.\n\nAs reported by Rolling Stone, this “lost” album, titled Chain of Light, was discovered in the tape archives of Peter Gabriel’s Real World Records.\n\nThe label, which signed Nusrat in 1989, produced several highly regarded albums with him throughout the 1990s.\n\nChain of Light comprises four traditional qawwali tracks, including a newly unearthed piece. These recordings, made in April 1990 at Real World Studios, coincide with the period when Khan was collaborating on Mustt Mustt with Canadian producer Michael Brook, showcasing his vocal prowess at its zenith.\n\nCelebrated for his extraordinary vocal range of six octaves, Khan achieved global acclaim, earning admiration from Western rock and pop icons such as The Rolling Stones, Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. His voice also featured in soundtracks for films by renowned Hollywood directors including Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, and Tim Robbins.\n\nThe April 1990 tapes were uncovered during an archival relocation at Real World Studios in 2021. They capture Khan on the cusp of his international breakthrough.\n\nPainstakingly restored from the original analogue tapes, Chain of Light presents pristine renditions of classics like Ya Allah Ya Rehman and a rare performance of Ya Gaus Ya Meeran.\n\nReflecting on Khan’s legacy, producer Michael Brook commented, “These performances have an amazing clarity. They are more harmonically adventurous than the other songs Nusrat was recording at the time, with the whole group performing at their best.”\n\nKhan’s longtime manager, Rashid Ahmed-Din, highlighted 1990 as a crucial year, marking his expansion into Western markets.\n\nPeter Gabriel also expressed his admiration, stating, “I’ve had the privilege to work with a myriad of musicians from around the world, but Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was perhaps the greatest singer of them all. Discovering this tape in our library was a real delight. This album truly showcases him at his peak. It’s a wonderful record.”\n\nIn addition to the album, a definitive documentary on Khan’s life, titled Ustad, is set to be released by Islamabad-based Saiyna Bashir Studios by late 2025.\n\nSupported by a grant from the British Council, the studio plans to promote Chain of Light in collaboration with Real World Records."
