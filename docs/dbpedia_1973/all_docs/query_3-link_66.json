        "text": "The family of Fateh Ali Khans have redefined music for generations. Be it the Pakistani veteran Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or his infamous nephew Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, all of them made the globe groove to their mesmerising songs. In a recent incident, Rahat’s son Shahzaman left people stunned with his voice.\n\nAt a USA concert, Shahzaman Fateh Ali Khan joined his father to sing Nusrat’s iconic song “Kinna Sohna Tenu Rab Ne Banaya”.\n\nAs soon as the clip went viral, people drew similarities between Shahzaman and NFAK. The video was shared with the caption, “Maybe I'm getting overly excited but Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's son sounds like a very young Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the OG! Meet Shahzaman Fateh Ali Khan. What a time to be alive.”\n\nReacting to the video, one user wrote, “Rahat Fateh Ali Khan’s son. OMG does he not sound like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan?”. Another added, “He has a similar voice as Nusrat but both Nusrat and Rahat were much more polished qawwals by this age. Nusrat was truly the best!.” See some more reactions here:-\n\nAlso Read: ‘It’s A Disgrace’, Fans Support Priyanka Singh After Singer Cries On Stage After Mistreatment\n\nShahzaman is slowly gaining popularity in India as well. Back in April, he performed at Anant Ambani’s 28th birthday bash in Dubai.\n\nShahzaman often shares videos on Instagram where he is spotted jamming with his father Rahat. Earlier this month, while sharing one such video, the junior Rahat wrote, “What a great dad he is! Lets me occupy his seat as he takes mine. Knowing that I still have to earn this seat but still how willingly he wants to see me on this seat. How blessed I am to have a father & an Ustad like my dad.”\n\nThe unforgettable musical journey of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nNusrat has given Bollywood some of the most iconic songs including Dulhe Ka Sehra, Saanon Ki Mala, Tumhe Dillagi Bhul Jaani, and Sanu Ek Pal Chain among others. The Qawwali maestro also gave unforgettable tracks like The Dum Mast Qalander Mast and Jhule Jhule Laal.\n\nNusrat’s nephew Rahat Fateh sang for several Bollywood movies until 2016 when Pakistani artists were banned from working in India.\n\nHis forever iconic songs remain to be Jiya Dhadak Dhadak, Omkara’s Naina, Main Jahaan Rahoon, Zaroori Tha, Dagabaaz Re, O Re Piya, Bol Na Halke Halke among others. His last Bollywood song titled Tere Bin featured in Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan starrer Simmba."
