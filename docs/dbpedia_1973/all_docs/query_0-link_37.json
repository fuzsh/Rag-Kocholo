        "text": "Legendary Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was a powerhouse vocalist, musician, composer and music director, primarily known for his qawwali. He has been an inspiration to many musicians across the globe.\n\nWhile Khan is widely credited for introducing qawwali music to the international audience, he has also had a big impact on contemporary South Asian popular music, including Bollywood music.\n\nThe Shahenshah-e-Qawwali once opened up about music composers copying his music. He even took names of composers Anu Malik and Viju Shah.\n\nWhile interacting with Zee TV a few decades ago, Khan was asked about Indian music directors, who were inspired by his work. Responding to the question on who he thought made the ‘best copy’ of his songs and deserved the ‘best copy award’, the Pakistani musician said, “Not best copy, they have done good work. Viju Shah has done well. Anu Malik has also copied me well.\n\nBollywood has often been called out for plagiarising Khan’s songs.\n\nHindi cinema has been accused of adapting and copying NFAK’s qawwalis and songs a few of which include, Mera Piya Ghar Aya, Kitna Pyara Tujhay Rab Ne Banaya’ which happened to be a rip-off NFAK’s song ‘Kina Sona Tenu Rab Ne Banaya’ and another ‘Mujhe Ek Pal Chain Na Awe’ from the film Judaai that happened to be a copy of ‘Sanu Ek Pal Chain Na Awe’ by the legend himself."
