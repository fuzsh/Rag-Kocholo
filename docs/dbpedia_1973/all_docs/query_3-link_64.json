        "text": "By: Natalie Hamingson for Mideast Tunes.\n\nJunoon guitarist Salman Ahmad is often introduced in Western media as “the Bono of Pakistan.” It’s an easy comparison to make if you want an attention grabbing sound bite, in the sense that Ahmad sees his musical career as a platform for more than entertainment. But when I asked him in a recent interview if he thought it was accurate to call Junoon “South Asia’s U2,” he gave a pretty firm “No.”\n\nAhmad cites much respect for the legendary Irish band, but he also sees the comparison as a journalistic short cut. Ahmad says, “We’re stuck with that label. Yes, there’s some similarity in that music was a vehicle for social change….But at the same time, I think people overlook because there’s a rush to dumb down everything in the media. If you read the book “Rock’n’Roll Jihad,” you’ll know why it’s not an accurate comparison.”\n\n“Rock and Roll Jihad,” Ahmad’s autobiography, released at the beginning of 2010, chronicles his venture into music, from deciding to pick up a guitar after seeing Led Zeppelin at Madison Square Garden, to his eventual success with Junoon. For rock history aficionados, there’s a great story about Mick Jagger boogying it off with a Mujra dancer in Lahore. Political history junkies will enjoy the stories of Pakistani politics from the 1960s to present, as Ahmad’s tales of his unending obsession with music are intertwined with opposition from changing, and often strict and corrupt administrations. The political circumstances and lack of music industry at the time of Junoon’s inception are what Ahmad says makes their story truly different from U2’s.\n\nAhmad says, “Unlike anybody who wanted to become a rock musician in the West, we had to face government opposition, religious extremists trying to kill you, even if you [just] picked up a guitar at a talent show. We had no radio airplay, no t.v. airplay, not even proper record companies.”\n\nRather than be discouraged by these challenges, though, Ahmad refused to be bullied into giving up music. The book’s opening scene is the aforementioned talent show at his college, in which a “bearded one” smashes Ahmad’s sunburst guitar and threatens his life. Despite the dangers his chosen career posed, Ahmad decided that it was the healthiest path to take.\n\nHe says, “That’s how this whole journey of Junoon began. It was feeling the same, I guess frustration, that a lot of people who get brainwashed into blowing themselves up feel, but I’m saying, rather than fear, and anger, and hatred, choose love. Choose your passion. There’s a line that I always say, ‘Listen to the whisper in your heart. It may not have wings, but it has the power to fly.’ I listened to the whisper in my heart. I was scared when that guy destroyed my guitar, I didn’t want to die, but my whisper was saying, ‘keep following the music.’”\n\nThat decision eventually took Salman on tours around the world, that included being on the bill for historic occasions, like the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony in Oslo in 2007. He’s also collaborated with some big names ranging from qawwali legend Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Melissa Etheridge (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAoPm3nkCN0).\n\nYou would think it would be easy to promote a story about achieving success in the phase of adversity to the American public, but Ahmad’s publisher had serious reservations about that when he found out the book’s title included the word “Jihad.” Ahmad explains why he insisted on keeping the title.\n\n“The reason I wrote the book, and call my journey a sort of ‘rock and roll jihad’ is because the true meaning of the word is positive struggle to find your purpose in life, to overcome your ego, to help lift society up; never to bring people down, never to cause violence and spread fear. So I said ‘if there’s such a huge misperception among people that you’re asking me not to even use the word, well, that’s reason enough to use it.’”\n\nSince returning to the States in 2001, Ahmad has dedicated a large amount of time to speaking against skewed perceptions of his faith. After realizing “the story I want to tell isn’t just limited to CD’s and music videos,” he ventured into film, making two documentaries, the award winning “Rock Star and the Mullahs,” on music’s role in Islam, and “It’s My Country Too,” which chronicles the backlash against American Muslims that followed 9/11.\n\nAhmad admits it’s occasionally frustrating to be asked more about his religion than his music in interviews, but at the same time, he realizes sharing his story is necessary, especially in times where the media gives mass amounts of attention to stories of a destructive minority.\n\n“I understand that the media says, ‘if it bleeds, it leads,” but at the same time it tells me, man, make the loudest noise you possibly can. Turn your amp up to thirteen. You’ve got to tell people, ‘look, I also subscribe to the same holy book, but guess what? I’m writing songs of love and understanding.’ We are living in transformational times, in which communication is the key to defeating extremism.”\n\nAhmad’s ideas about the power of communication led to an invitation to speak at Clinton Global Initiative in 2006. A professor from New York’s Queens College happened to be in the audience and was impressed by his speech about “how powerful music, poetry, and film [are] as a mode of communication,” and thought he could expand on the idea for a whole course, which eventually became “Islamic Music and Culture of South Asia.” He recalls, “I tried it out for one semester, I loved it so much that I’ve been doing that ever since.”\n\nThough Ahmad still teaches one day a week, and participates in other extracurriculars, like his non-profit organization,Salman and Samina Global Wellness Initiative, he continues to make music. On June 1st, 2010, he dropped his solo album, also titled “Rock’n’Roll Jihad.” The ten-track album serves as a soundtrack to the book, featuring newly penned rock-infused pop ballads, and four tracks that were recorded live during Ahmad’s performance at the U.N. Concert for Pakistan in the fall of 2009. Rather than repeat the events in the book, the lyrics on the recently written songs serve to support the book’s encouraging tone, such as “Hold on, be strong, don’t fear. Time is on your side” on “Time.” Some also pay homage to Ahmad’s favorite lines of Sufi poetry, such as “When you see with the heart, the masks come tumbling down,” on the single “Love Can You Take Me Back.” (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz1F3Tsv-oY&feature=related) The live tracks that put the spotlight on Ahmad’s guitar playing show where he truly excels, such as on the extended guitar solo on his performance of Junoon hit “Sayonee.”\n\nAcoustic versions of the songs from “Rock’n’Roll Jihad” can be heard on one of Ahmad’s promotional tours for his book. He recently returned from a London book tour, which combined storytelling and serenading, and will head to Alexandria, Egypt, in late June. As he continues to spread his message of peace and understanding through cross-cultural art exchanges, Ahmad also seeks to inspire individuals with his extremely optimistic attitude.\n\nHe emphasizes, “The power of one person cannot be underestimated… One person’s passion can be infectious, can be addictive, and it can change the world. Sometimes, you know, we all feel overwhelmed, [but] if you follow your passion, and say these are the things I believe in with conviction, it’s amazing how quickly perceptions start changing. ”"
