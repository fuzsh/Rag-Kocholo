        "text": "The world remembers Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on his what have would have been his 72nd birthday today. NFAK also known as the Shahenshah-e-Qawwali (King of Qawwali) continues to live in millions of hearts today even years after his demise. A living legend, whose name is familiar to almost all music lovers globally continues to rule hearts with his mesmerising voice.\n\nIn 1993, the late American singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley described Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan as ‘my Elvis.’ This is proof of how well received NFAK was as an artist not just in Pakistan but worldwide. In the current times, Nusrat Fateh Ali’s Qawwalis and style of singing has been copied by many yet the originals still stand a class apart. With no one having made it close to him, the world continues to put him on a well deserved pedestal.\n\nHere’s how fans and followers are paying tribute to the legend on his birth anniversary today:\n\nNusrat’s classics like ‘Kali Kali Zulfein’, ‘Tumhe Dillagi’ and ‘Sanu Ik Pal’ amongst many others set the theme for chilly winter nights especially in Pakistan with Qawwali nights and bonfires in full swing!\n\nWhich Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Qawwali is your favourite? Let us know by leaving a comment on our Instagram page.\n\nUntil next time!"
