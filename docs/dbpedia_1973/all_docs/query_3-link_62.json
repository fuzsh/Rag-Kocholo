        "text": "INDIA CURRENTS\n\nGUIDELINES FOR WRITERS & VISUAL ARTISTS\n\n(revised June 30, 2008)\n\nAnnual subscription $19.95, sample copy $3.00 from:\n\nIndia Currents, P.O. Box 21285, San Jose 95151, (408) 324-0488\n\nwww.indiacurrents.com\n\nIndia Currents is an important facet of America’s emerging multicultural identity. It’s a monthly publication which explores the heritage and culture of India as it exists in the United States. The magazine covers a wide range of subjectsundefinedpolitics, arts, literature, music, dance, travel, business, and even recipesundefinedthat are of interest to a general readership. At the heart of the magazine is a comprehensive calendar of Indian events, used extensively by readers to plan their leisure and entertainment.\n\nOver the years, India Currents has won considerable recognition for its content, including awards from New America Media, the Arts Council Silicon Valley, and the South Asian Journalists Association as well as a nomination for the Utne Independent Press Awards.\n\nIndia Currents has been in publication since 1987, when it started as a utility for the burgeoning South Asian American community. Today, the magazine is published in two print editionsundefinedNorthern California and Southern California/Nationwideundefinedas well as online, but it remains true to its original ethos and is free to all California subscribers. It reaches about 32,300 households and has a particularly strong circulation among hi-tech professionals in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe premise on which India Currents is founded is simple: that Americans of all backgrounds are interested in learning about other world cultures and that they respond to information that is presented to them in an accessible and attractive manner.\n\nWHO MAY WRITE FOR INDIA CURRENTS: Our contributors come from a wide variety of backgrounds and write from all over the world. Indians, South Asians, Americans, and others write regularly for India Currents. What each of our writers has in common is an abiding interest in South Asia and India specifically: its people, culture, and evolving status in the world. Most of them live in the United States and have a good understanding of American people and culture. Without exception, they are all excellent communicators. Their challenge is to make India less exotic, less mysterious, more real, more nuanced, and more human.\n\nOur readership is mixed: about 80% Indian American, 20% non-Indian. Readers have a superior command of English, but don't necessarily have a very wide or deep knowledge of Indiaundefinedin fact, many don't. Writers can assume that almost every reader has a certain amount of curiosity about India and the Indian diaspora, and is turning to the magazine for better understanding and deeper insight. To that end, articles which treat Indian arts, culture, customs, and philosophy in simple, expository terms are welcome.\n\nHere are some notes about our major features and columns. If you are considering something that does not fit any of these pageheads, please feel free to email or call us.

How has it influenced or been influenced by other cultures? What relevance does it have for modern life? Length: 350-500 words.\n\nDEADLINES\n\nThe 1st of each month for the following month's issue.

Here is our most current list.\n\nA.D. Anno domini, in the year of the Lord. Use C.E. (Common Era).\n\nB.C. Before Christ. Use B.C.E.\n\nB.C.E. Before Common Era\n\nBanaras, Benares Use Varanasi, the modern name of the city in eastern Uttar Pradesh state. Where the old name must be used, use Banaras, as in Banaras gharana of music.\n\nBangla the language spoken by the people of West Bengal and Bangladesh.\n\nBengali the people of Bengal; the language of Bengal. Some Bengalis prefer this name for their language over Bangla, and have said so in their letters to India Currents.\n\nBharatanatyam Use bharatanatyam. As in ballet, do not capitalize names of Indian dance forms.\n\nC.E. Common Era. Preferable to A.D.

Do not use Dacca.\n\nEast Indian or Asian Indian Use only Indian, omit qualifiers like East or Asian. Other peoples to whom the term Indian is mistakenly applied have names of their own choosing: Hopi, Navajo, Miskito, to name a few. Calling them Indian is reminiscent of the colonial past in which non-European people were not accorded the dignity of being called by their own names. Indian has a distinctly native derivation (from Sindhu, the Indus river). It should not require qualification. There is only one India, there is only one kind of Indian.\n\net cetera, etc. used at the end of a list to denote more entries of the same kind. It is commonly misused by lazy writers. Best not used. If list is not complete or exhaustive, rephrase sentence along the lines of: “includes items such as A, B, and C” instead of “includes A, B, C, etc.”\n\nexotic does not describe the object to which it is applied, rather it describes the feelings of the describer towards the object. Carries connotations of strange, foreign, alien, mysterious. One of the truly meaningless words in cross-cultural communication, patronizing, revealing of ignorance, a hindrance to better understanding. Best not used except to make this point.\n\nfund-raise\n\nfund-raiser\n\nfund-raising\n\nGanga North India's major river.

For repeated occurrences, use only the last name.\n\nNorth India, North Indian Always capitalize both words.\n\nOdissi Use odissi. As in ballet, do not capitalize names of Indian dance forms.\n\nProper Names Use native names and native spelling wherever possible. If relevant, include tips on accurate pronunciation. E.g., Ganga, not Ganges; Kanpur, not Cawnpore; Himalaya (pronounced him-mah-luh-yuh); Taj Mahal (pronounced Tah-dj Muh-hull).\n\nPunjab, Punjabi a state in North India; its language and its people\n\nrag Use raga.\n\nraga preferred spelling for a mode in the Indian system of music\n\nsacred cow something that is irrationally exempt from criticism.

Not to be confused with South East Asia.\n\nSouth East Asia does not include India and neighboring countries. A common mistake in America. The correct geo-political term is South Asia: it includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Burma, Maldives (and Tibet, depending on your politics). South East Asia refers to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Laos, Kampuchea, Vietnam, and New Guinea.\n\nSouth India, South Indian Always capitalize both words.\n\nSpelling Use Indian spellings of Indian names & terms. E.g., Mughal, not Moghul; Muslim, not Moslem; Hindu, not Hindoo.\n\nVaranasi a city in eastern Uttar Pradesh state known earlier as Banaras or Benares. Where the old name must be used, use Banaras, as in Banaras gharana of music.\n\nvilayat “the foreign land,” originally applied to Turkey, later came to mean Europe and the West. Do not use vilayet.\n\nveena preferred spelling for India's ancient plucked string instrument\n\nvina Use veena.\n\nNOTES ON SPELLING\n\nIndians have a unique way of spelling names in Roman script. Each letter is used consistently to represent the same sound. If you want to pronounce Indian names properly, learning the spelling is the first step.\n\nPeople who have grown up with the arbitrariness of English spelling and pronunciation do not find Indian spelling immediately intuitive, but after some familiarity, begin to see a clear pattern and method.\n\nThe letter a is the source of much confusion to non-Indians. It is one of the few letters which has come to represent two different sounds in Indian names: the sound of a in elephant (short a), and the a in far (long a). It is never used to represent the sound of a in fat. E.g., Bharati (Bhah-ruh-tee), Himalaya (him-mah-luh-yuh).\n\nWatch the h's carefully. The correct placement of the letter h is crucial. By itself, it represents the sound of h in house. When it follows another consonant, as in kh, gh, it stands for aspiration - aspirated k, aspirated g, and so on. Misplacing the h in some names may make it meaningless (the name is Gandhi, not Ghandi) or change its meaning entirely, sometimes from the sublime to the ridiculous. The Washington Post devoted an entire review to khatak (a knock or sound) when it meant kathak (the classical dance of North India).\n\nThe same Indian name may be spelled differently in North & South India: Sarasvati (North India) and Sarasvathi (South India).\n\nThe letters v and w do not necessarily represent different sounds. Divali & Diwali, Sarasvati & Saraswati are both acceptable.\n\nNOTES ON PUNCTUATION\n\ncomma In lists of three or more items, use a comma before the “and” or “or.” E.g.: one, two, and three; four, five, six, and seven.\n\nellipsis Three periods, no spaces between them, always a space before if preceded by a word, always a space after if it is followed by a word. E.g.: He rambled on and on and on ... but no one paid attention. Use sparingly.\n\nexclamation mark Use sparingly."
