Khusrow (d. 1325). Bulleh Shah (d. 1757) is said to have modified this song to create the popular qawwal “Mast Qalandar” in honor of the Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar (d. 1274) whose tomb in Sindh (pictured below) attracts thousands of pilgrims every year.\n\n‘Ali plays an important role in virtually all Sufi orders as the first link in the initiatic chain from the Prophet, and whether Sunni or Shi’a, Sufi poets around the world have praised ‘Ali for his sanctity, knowledge, and spiritual perfection. Like the Prophet, ‘Ali remains a living presence in Sufism, especially in Qawwali music.\n\nDam Mast Qalandar\n\nPartial Translation:\n\n“Intoxicated, intoxicated\n\nUpon My breath and in my intoxication is the great Qalander.\n\nMy worship and upon my breath is the name of Ali.\n\nI am intoxicated with the beloved Qalander\n\nI am intoxicated with Jhoole Laal who is intoxicated with Qalander\n\nKeep repeating his name you follower of Ali\n\nYou Ali !!!
