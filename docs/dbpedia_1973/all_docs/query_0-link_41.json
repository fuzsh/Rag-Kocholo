        "text": "The phrase \"Allah Hoo\" translates to \"God is\" or \"there is only God,\" and it serves as a recurring chant throughout the song. The first verse establishes the idea of God's oneness and coexistence with all things, proclaiming \"Malik ul mulk lashareeka lahoo\" which translates to \"Master of the universe, with no one to share His power.\" The second verse describes a time before the earth, skies, and stars existed, emphasizing the eternal and limitless nature of God. The third verse switches to a more personal tone, reminding the listener of their own insignificance and the greatness of God, questioning why they would ever need anything beyond God's existence."
