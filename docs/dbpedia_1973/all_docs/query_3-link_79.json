The wonderful new Israeli musical group named \"Sheva\" heard it and adapted it for Jewish use. \"Sheva\" taught the song to a group of people from the synagogue \" B'nei Jeshurun\" in New York City. The names of the Rabbis who were there were Rabbi Marcelo Bronstein and Rabbi Rolando Matalon. Cantor Avi Preiven learned it as well. I've seen notes from a Hava Nashira conference stating that Rabbi Bronstein wrote the second part of the song. This is incorrect, per my conversation with Cantor Priven today. It was written by \"Sheva\". If anyone would like to see proof of this, all you have to do is look at the album \"With Every Breath-The music of Shabbat at BJ\". In the liner notes, by song #9 Halleluyah, it will state this. Cantor Ari Priven will also be glad to confirm this.I hope this clarifies any misinformation that has been transmitted regarding the origins of this wonderful song. Ken \"Daniel A.
