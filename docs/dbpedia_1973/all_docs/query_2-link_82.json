        "text": "Google on Tuesday paid tribute to iconic qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan with a customized doodle on his birthday.\n\nThe doodle features Khan singing with other qawwals. A click on the doodle would take you to a number of pages providing information on the legendary qawwali singer.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan, known for qawwalis (devotional Sufi music) became popular across the world. His most famous compositions include \"Kinna Sohna Tainu\", \"Dam Mast Kalandar\", \"Afreen Afreen\", \"Mera Piya Ghar Aaya\", and many more. Born in 1948 in Pakistan, Khan passed away at a very early age of 48. He died of a cardiac arrest on August 16, 1997.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKhan is accredited for popularising qawwali music and bringing it to the international audience. Carrying forward the 600-year-old tradition of qawwali in his family, Khan, in his active years, toured extensively and collaborated with many international artists.\n\nKhan is widely considered to be the most important qawwal in history and was awarded the UNESCO Music Prize in 1995."
