        "text": "Music Reviews: Walk Your Walk\n\nNouvelle Vague; Luaka Bop\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan: The Early Years Vol. 1; Narada\n\nLea Delaria: Double Standards; Telarc\n\nReviewed by Debi Winston Buzil\n\nMy girlfriends and I had a night planned for a while: We were going out on the town! And what do yoginis in the city do in their down time? Why, we went to hear a swami speak! I considered the swami “cool”--he was young, vibrant, really funny and living in one of the largest cosmopolitan cities in the world. He seemed to embody “being here now.”\n\nDiscussing spiritual principles, our swami began to talk about prakriti, or the “unmanifest universe.” Prakriti can be envisioned as a seed that contains the whole tree, composed of three balanced elements--the three gunas. In order for the world to “manifest,” these gunas must move out of balance. These three principles can best be described by their properties. Tamas is inert, lazy and decaying, while raja is energetic, passionate and vibrant. Sattva--or the “yogi’s best friend”--is balanced, light and clear. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali explain that the purpose of the gunas is to provide both experiences and liberation to the purusha, or the seer--The True You.\n\nThe surrounding world can be delineated by these properties. There’s no judgment--a stone is simply tamasic. It’s inactive and just sits. Caffeine, by any account, is described as rajasic. And from my understanding, garlic and onions are so very rajasic that they are considered tamasic and restricted from a serious yoga practitioner’s diet! Sattvic ideals include true knowledge, whole grains, fresh fruits, veggies--and classical music! That’s what the swami told us!\n\nClassical music…hmmmmm. Well, in short, I agree. Classical music sounds like it should be oh-so-sattvic. After the birth of my son Asa, we’ve often tuned into the local classical station, and I’d have to say that some pieces are so heavy, so brooding, I’d be hard pressed not to feel dark and heavy--super tamasic--from just listening. Other pieces are so quickly paced and filled with notes that I’d have to call them rajasic. Just think of Rimsky-Korsakov’s ”Flight of the Bumblebee.”\n\nThe swami described tamasic music as being rap, hip hop and disco, while rajasic music is “heavy metal.” Hmmm…My contrary mind finds this hard to handle. For example, at a certain age my brother started playing this dark heavy metal Black Sabbath song in our house (really loudly). “Sweet Leaf” had no more energy than the above-mentioned stone. Tamasic tamasic tamasic!\n\nThere’s lots of disco with the most uplifting, god-loving, life-affirming (sattvic) messages. Sylvester’s “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)” and Sister Sledge’s “We are Family” can really lift me up on a dark day. While Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration” may seem a little cheesy now, it’s a reminder to “celebrate good times--come on!” And the post-disco hit “Groove is in the Heart” by Dee-Lite sums it all up --“groove” or flow only appears when the heart opens. Add a bit of booty shakin’ to enliven the yogi’s soul, and we’re really on a roll!\n\nIf my yoga practice has taught me one thing, it’s that everything can be looked at uniquely, and then the seer’s experience is a reflection of the seer’s self. Yoga asks us not to believe dogma, but to discover meaning for ourselves. We can be shown the path, but it’s up to us to walk it and interpret our discoveries ourselves.\n\nNouvelle Vague’s self-titled debut is a reinterpretation of the post-punk period of early to mid 80's. Nouvelle Vague translates from the French to new-wave and the (Brazilian) Portugese to bossa-nova. Nouvelle Vague’s music is certainly a blend of the two. Created by a talented duo of French multi-instrumentalists and producers, along with a parade of guest female vocalists, the music is unexpected and lovely. Reconfiguring Joy Division’s dark dance-floor hit “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” Public Image’s “This is Not a Love Song” and The Cure’s “A Forest” into lovely bossa nova numbers conjures up the Brazilian feeling of suadade, or yearning.\n\nOther covers include The Clash, Depeche Mode and Modern English. These songs held meaning for me as a young woman growing up in the eighties. The mellow, purely acoustic reinterpretations allow the luminous melodies to shine and the lyrical content to move to a different level.\n\nThere are two versions available. If you have a sensitive psyche, go for the clean edit and skip the explicit lyrics. No matter how sweetly sung, it may leave you feeling a little tamasic. Other than that, Nouvelle Vague is so chill that you won’t need to turn on your AC this summer.\n\nThe Ultimate Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan--The Early Years, Vol. 1, is a double CD consisting of rare recordings from his early days. The late “Nusrat” (as his legion of die-hard fans refer to him) brought qawwali music from Pakistan. Qawwal literally means “the word,” and the qawwali represents the voice of divine power. The strength of Nusrat was his gift of capturing the attention of his listeners and elevating their consciousness. The singer considered himself nothing but “a simple follower in the Sufi tradition.” Nonetheless, his illustrious nicknames include “The Pavarotti of the East,” “The Singing Buddha” and simply “The Voice.”\n\nNusrat’s vocal stylings show the expertise of improvisation--going with the spirit, finding the flow. This high quality double CD release has just seven tracks. With two songs clocking in at just under 30 minutes and the others averaging more than 15 minutes, we see the evolution of melody, of variations of simple phrases and the flights into his beloved voice of ecstasy.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan takes us to the very highest realm, that of devotion and love. This is truly, in the traditional sense of the word, sattvic music.\n\nComedian turned jazz singer Lea Delaria’s Double Standards is another album of covers, moving through Blondie’s “Call Me” to Nirvana’s “Just a Girl” to Neil Young and Green Day songs. Husky and passionate, Lea brings a smokiness to the music along with some great scat singing. Based in traditional jazz, there’s nothing “out” about the recording, just straight-ahead reinterpretations from the pop-rock canon. She has a great band, including legendary bassist Christian McBride.\n\nWhen I was just a young tyke, my grandma, an accomplished jazz pianist, sat me down and explained the concept of improvisation. We listened to Art Tatum’s “Love for Sale” over and over again to hear the theme and its variations. The artist takes a theme and makes it his or her own. The above performers have their yoga mojo working for them with their reinterpretation of a song. Taking the ball and running with it. Or perhaps it’s in being shown the path--a melody and a lyric--and then making it their own. This is the yoga tradition.\n\nMy night out with the girls and the swami wasn’t a bust--it was far from it. I adore being in a community of like-minded folks, or satsang. The swami reminded me why I do yoga in the first place. Years ago, I thought it was in order to attain a strong and flexible body. Now I know that the practice brings clarity and flexibility far beyond the physical realm. In our post-swami wrap-up session, my yogini pal D. reminded me how yoga can bring us to a more profound, deeper understanding of things and, consequently, helps us to avoid making rigid classifications. The path of yoga can help us move through the river of life with grace and equanimity. Yogis and yoginis everywhere, walk your walk!\n\nDebi Winston Buzil is a kirtan-wallah, leading chants with the group Devi 2000.
