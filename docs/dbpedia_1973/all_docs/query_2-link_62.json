        "text": "Read other people's comments then Tell us what you think:\n\nNaseem Zia, Australia\n\nPlease dont think like HALF GLASS IS EMPTY, I am surprised on Gaudi's selection. He selected the one and only one Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Best wishes Guadi\n\nAmir Khan, U.S.A\n\nI am Pakistani/American World Music composer. So I was excited to learn that a European musician has utilized NFAK's recently found recordings in his new album.However, I am very disappointed to hear the result. I am sure Gaudi is good at what he does. Unfortunately, often, eastern classical singing cannot be simply backed with western chords. The result is that within the first 12 sec of the recording, NFAT sounds \"off\" (which I am sure he is not but rather due to orchestration/chords used in the background). The same thing happens again at 2:08 min into the recording.I think the overall sound or feeling of the song has to be appealing to your ears. In my humble opinion, this song is not.\n\nirfan pakistan\n\nwhat a classic excellent remix...great gaudi keep it up.\n\nRob Constantin\n\nThis album Dub Qawwali is simply fantastic! Excellent production, quality songs, fresh ideas and innovative style crossing reggae culture with sufi, for me this is a masterpiece!\n\nmaya (BZH) & london\n\nThis album is just fantastic!!!I fly every day on it...beautifulthanks soo muchmaya\n\nDJ Don't F*** About\n\nGaudi rules, he should easily win one of your awards\n\nSarah Flavell\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no!This is an awful desecration of wonderful music. It sounds like someone is just playing bad reggae in the background.\n\nnishatro sanghera, London\n\nLoved it- a wonderful combination of sounds.\n\nhasan khalid, US\n\ni am a huge fan of Nusrat and Gaudi gave it new style, i liked it\n\nNaveed Awan Khan, London\n\nQawalli is timeless and doesnt but this album will age and is wrong. Its like the Bally Sagoo production which is rubbish. Gaudi has tried but it falls short.\n\nKANWALJIT SINGH INDIA\n\nI LOVE NUSRAT SONGS. THIS SONG IS ALSO VERY EXCELLENT AS OTHERS SONGS OF NUSRAT\n\nstephan wikkler (Sweden)\n\nI really love this cd, Sufi music and reggae music combined in the most beautiful way. the production in here is perfect!! Gaudi did an incredible job, and of course the inimitable voice of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan gives to this album a unique and \"top level\" touch! thank you. Stephan\n\nmark (brighton - uk)\n\nthis album Dub Qawwali is a gem!!! superb production by Gaudi, gives an extra amazing \"dub touch\" to the beautiful voice of a true legend: Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Gaudi/Khan a perfet combination!\n\nShafat, Kashmir, India\n\nJust Awesome!!!! Just a step behind Night Song. Remixed very well otherwise considering that Nusrat was around in this one as he was very much active during Night Song"
