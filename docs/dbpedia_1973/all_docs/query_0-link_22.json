        "text": "Early life and career\n\nKhan was born in a Punjabi Muslim family in Faisalabad in 1948, shortly after the partition of India in 1947 during which his family had migrated to Pakistan from their native city of Jalandhar in East Punjab, British India (now in Punjab, India).He originates from Basti Sheikh in Jalandhar. His ancestors learnt music and singing there and adopted it as a profession. He was the fifth child and first son of Fateh Ali Khan, a musicologist, vocalist, instrumentalist, and qawwal. Khan's family, which included four older sisters and a younger brother, Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan, grew up in central Faisalabad. The tradition of qawwali in the family had passed down through successive generations for almost 600 years. Initially, his father did not want Khan to follow the family's vocation. He had his heart set on Nusrat choosing a much more respectable career path and becoming a doctor or engineer, because he felt Qawwali artists had low social status. However, Khan showed such an aptitude for and interest in Qawwali, that his father finally relented. He began by learning the tabla before moving on to vocals. In 1964, Khan's father died, leaving his musical education under the supervision of his paternal uncles, Mubarak Ali Khan and Salamat Ali Khan. He is the uncle of singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nIn 1971, after the death of his uncle Mubarak Ali Khan, Khan became the official leader of the family Qawwali party and the party became known as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Mujahid Mubarak Ali Khan & Party. Khan's first public performance as the leader of the Qawwali party was at a studio recording broadcast as part of an annual music festival organised by Radio Pakistan, known as Jashn-e-Baharan. Khan sang mainly in Urdu and Punjabi and occasionally in Persian, Braj Bhasha and Hindi. His first major hit in Pakistan was the song Haq Ali Ali, which was performed in a traditional style and with traditional instrumentation. The song featured restrained use of Khan's sargam improvisations.\n\nLater career\n\nIn the summer of 1985, Khan performed at the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival in London. He performed in Paris in 1985 and 1988. He first visited Japan in 1987, at the invitation of the Japan Foundation. He performed at the 5th Asian Traditional Performing Art Festival in Japan. He also performed at Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York in 1989, earning him admiration from the American audience.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan, throughout his career, had great understanding with many south Asian singers such as the (late) Alam Lohar, the (late) Noor Jehan, and various other Pakistani and Indian singers.\n\nIn the 1992–93 academic year, Khan was a Visiting Artist in the Ethnomusicology department at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States.\n\nIn 1988, Khan teamed with Peter Gabriel on the soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ, which led to Khan being signed to Gabriel's Real World label. He would go on to release five albums of traditional Qawwali through Real World, along with the more experimental albums Mustt Mustt (1990), Night Song (1996), and the posthumous remix album Star Rise (1997).\n\nKhan's experimental work for Real World, which featured his collaborations with the Canadian guitarist Michael Brook, spurred on several further collaborations with a number of other Western composers and rock musicians. One of the most noteworthy of these collaborations came in 1995, when Khan grouped with Pearl Jam's lead singer Eddie Vedder on two songs for the soundtrack to Dead Man Walking. Khan also provided vocals for The Prayer Cycle, which was put together by Jonathan Elias, but died before the tracks could be completed. Alanis Morissette was brought in to sing with his unfinished vocals. In 2002, Gabriel included Khan's vocals on the posthumously released track \"Signal to Noise\" on his album Up.\n\nKhan's album Intoxicated Spirit was nominated for a Grammy award in 1997 for best traditional folk album. That same year, his album Night Song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album, but lost out to The Chieftains' album Santiago.\n\nKhan contributed songs to, and performed in, several Pakistani films. Shortly before his death, he composed music for three Bollywood films, which includes the film Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya, in which he also sang for \"Koi Jaane Koi Na Jaane\" onscreen with the lead pair, and \"Zindagi Jhoom Kar\"; He also composed music for Kartoos, where he sang for \"Ishq Da Rutba\", and \"Bahaa Na Aansoo\", alongside Udit Narayan. He died very shortly prior to the movie's release. His final music composition for Bollywood was for the movie, Kachche Dhaage, where he sang in \"Iss Shaan-E-Karam Ka Kya Kehna\". The movie was released in 1999, two years after his death. It is notable that the two legendary singing sisters of Bollywood, Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar sang for the songs he composed in his brief stint in Bollywood. He sang \"Saya Bhi Saath Jab Chhod Jaye\" for Sunny Deol's movie Dillagi. The song was released in 1999, two years after Khan's death. He also sang \"Dulhe Ka Sehra\" from the Bollywood movie Dhadkan which was released in 2000.\n\nKhan contributed the song \"Gurus of Peace\" to the album Vande Mataram, composed by A. R. Rahman, and released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of India's independence. As a posthumous tribute, Rahman later released an album titled Gurus of Peace, which featured \"Allah Hoo\" by Khan. Rahman's 2007 song \"Tere Bina\" was also composed as a tribute to Khan.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter traveling to London from his native Pakistan for treatment for liver and kidney problems, Khan was rushed from the airport to Cromwell Hospital.\n\nLondon's Daily Telegraph reported that doctors at the hospital attributed Khan's death to his treatment in Pakistan with infected dialysis equipment, from which they said he contracted hepatitis. The singer, who various reports said weighed over 300 pounds, had been seriously ill for several months, according to a spokesperson at his U.S. label, American Recordings.\n\nHe died of a sudden cardiac arrest at Cromwell Hospital, London on 16 August 1997, aged 48. His body was repatriated to Faisalabad, and his funeral was a public affair. He was buried in Kabootran Wala Qabristan also known as Jhang Road Graveyard on Jhang Road, Faisalabad.Map\n\nHis wife, Naheed Nusrat, died on 13 September 2013 in Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Naheed had moved to Canada after the death of her husband. She is survived by their daughter Nida Khan. Khan's musical legacy is now carried forward by his nephew, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nAwards and titles\n\nKhan is widely considered to be the most important qawwal in history. In 1987, he received the President of Pakistan's Award for Pride of Performance for his contribution to Pakistani music. In 1995, he received the UNESCO Music Prize. In 1996 he was awarded Grand Prix des Amériques at Montreal World Film Festival for exceptional contribution to the art of cinema. In the same year, Khan received the Arts and Culture Prize of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes. In Japan, he was also remembered as the Budai or \"Singing Buddha\". In 2005, Khan received the \"Legends\" award at the UK Asian Music Awards. Time magazine's issue of 6 November 2006, \"60 Years of Asian Heroes\", lists him as one of the top 12 artists and thinkers in the last 60 years. He also appeared on NPR's 50 great voices list in 2010. In August 2010 he was included in CNN's list of the twenty most iconic musicians from the past fifty years. In 2008, Khan was listed in 14th position in UGO's list of the best singers of all time.\n\nMany honorary titles were bestowed upon Khan during his 25-year music career. He was given the title of [[Ustad] (the master)] after performing classical music at a function in Lahore on his father's death anniversary.\n\nTributes, legacy and influence\n\nKhan is often credited as one of the progenitors of \"world music\". Widely acclaimed for his spiritual charisma and distinctive exuberance, he was one of the first and most important artists to popularise Qawwali, then considered an \"arcane religious tradition\", to Western audiences. His powerful vocal presentations, which could last up to 10 hours, brought forth a craze for his music all over Europe. Alexandra A. Seno of Asiaweek wrote:\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan's voice was otherworldly. For 25 years, his mystical songs transfixed millions. It was not long enough ... He performed qawwali, which means wise or philosophical utterance, as nobody else of his generation did. His vocal range, talent for improvisation and sheer intensity were unsurpassed.\n\nJeff Buckley cited Khan as a major influence, saying of him \"He's my Elvis\", and performing the first few minutes of Khan's hit \"Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hai\" (including vocals) at live concerts. Many other artists have also cited Khan as an influence, such as Grammy-nominated Pakistani-American Nadia Ali, Zayn Malik, Peter Gabriel, A. R. Rahman, Sheila Chandra, and Alim Qasimov. Author and neuroscientist Sam Harris cited Khan as one of his favourite musicians of all time.\n\nPaul Williams picked a concert performance by Khan for inclusion in his 2000 book The 20th Century's Greatest Hits: a 'top-40' list, in which he devotes a chapter each to what he considers the top 40 artistic achievements of the 20th century in any field (including art, movies, music, fiction, non-fiction, science-fiction). The Derek Trucks Band covers Khan's songs on two of their studio albums. Their 2002 album Joyful Noise includes a cover of \"Maki Madni\", which features a guest performance by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's nephew. 2005's Songlines includes a medley of two of Khan's songs, \"Sahib Teri Bandi\" and \"Maki Madni\". This medley first appeared on the band's live album Live at Georgia Theatre, which was released in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, a tribute band called Brooklyn Qawwali Party (formerly Brook's Qawwali Party) was formed in New York City by percussionist Brook Martinez to perform the music of Khan. The 13-piece group still performs mostly instrumental jazz versions of Khan's qawwalis, using the instruments conventionally associated with jazz rather than those associated with qawwali.\n\nIn 2007, electronic music producer and performer Gaudi, after being granted access to back catalogue recordings from Rehmat Gramophone House (Khan's former label in Pakistan), released an album of entirely new songs composed around existing vocals. The album, 'Dub Qawwali', was released by Six Degrees Records. It received huge critical acclaim internationally, reaching no. 2 in the iTunes US Chart, no. 4 in the UK and was the no. 1 seller in Amazon.com's Electronic Music section for a period. It also earned Gaudi a nomination for the BBC's World Music Awards 2008.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, Google celebrated Khan's 67th birthday with a doodle on its homepage for India, Pakistan, Japan among other countries calling him the person \"who opened the world's ears to the rich, hypnotic sounds of the Sufis\". “Thanks to his legendary voice, Khan helped bring \"world music\" to the world,\" said Google.\n\nIn February 2016, a rough mix of song recorded by Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1998 called \"Circle of the Noose\" was leaked to the internet. Guitarist Dave Navarro described the song saying \"It's pop in the sense of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, hook. I really love it and we use a loop of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. It's really nice. The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves.\"\n\nDocumentaries\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan: le dernier prophète (1996).
