        "text": "Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the Pakistani devotional singer who had\n\nworked with such Western musicians as Eddie Vedder, Peter Gabriel\n\nand progressive guitarist and producer Michael Brook, died Saturday\n\nat age 48. After traveling to London from his native Pakistan for\n\ntreatment for liver and kidney problems, Khan was rushed from the\n\nairport to Cromwell Hospital, where he suffered a fatal heart\n\nattack.\n\nLondon’s Daily Telegraph reported that doctors at the hospital\n\nblamed Khan’s death on his treatment in Pakistan with infected\n\ndialysis equipment, from which they said he contracted hepatitis.\n\nThe singer, who various reports said weighed over 300 pounds, had\n\nbeen seriously ill for several months, according to a spokesperson\n\nat his U.S. label, American Recordings.\n\nKhan was a master of qawwali singing, which combines lyrics\n\nfrom Sufi religious poems with hypnotic rhythms and vocal chants.\n\nConsidered a superstar in the Sufi community, Khan drew thousands\n\nof fans to concerts, where many danced as though lost in ecstatic\n\ntrances and threw money at his feet while he played.\n\nThough he never performed in English — he sang in Urdu,\n\nPunjabi and Farsi — Khan also captivated many Westerners,\n\nincluding such musicians as Vedder, Joan Osborne and the late Jeff\n\nBuckley, as well as Hollywood types like Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon\n\nand Tim Robbins. Khan signed to a U.S. record deal with Rick\n\nRubin’s American Recordings in mid-1996, and he recorded at least a\n\nfew songs with Rubin last fall, according to a spokesperson for the\n\nlabel.\n\nBorn into a family with a centuries-long tradition of qawwali\n\nsinging, Khan began recording in the early ’70s after ignoring his\n\nfather’s wishes that he pursue medicine. Although he recorded for\n\nlabels in Pakistan, England and Europe, he was barely known in the\n\nU.S. pop mainstream until he toured with Peter Gabriel’s 1985 WOMAD\n\nfestival. He also sang on Gabriel’s soundtrack for “The Last\n\nTemptation of Christ” and released several albums on that singer’s\n\nReal World label.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n“I feel a great sense of loss,” said Gabriel in a statement.\n\n“Since our first meeting at WOMAD in 1985, Nusrat, his voice and\n\nhis music have been an important part of me life.\n\nTrending\n\n“I have never heard so much spirit in a voice. My two main\n\nsinging inspirations, Nusrat and Otis Redding, have been the\n\nsupreme examples of how far and deep a voice can go in finding,\n\ntouching and moving the soul.”"
