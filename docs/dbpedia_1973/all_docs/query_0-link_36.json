        "text": "Today marks 20 years since one of the greatest international stars Pakistan has ever produced, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (NFAK) died; leaving behind a treasure of melodies for us to cherish forever.\n\nOn his 20th death anniversary, as the world pays tribute to this great legend, let’s revisit his 10 all-time greatest hits which prove why NFAK is revered as “Shahenshah-e-Qawwali” (The King of Kings of Qawwali) all around the world!\n\nAlso Read: To Junaid Jamshed With Love\n\n1) Dum Mast Qalander Mast\n\nA mandatory part of every Qawwali night, “Dum Mast Qalander Mast” remains our favorite owing to the ecstatic experience it offers and thus, is essential on this list!\n\n2) Tumhen Dillagi Bhool Jaani Padegi\n\nCan’t thank enough NFAK saab for such a melodious counseling every time we went through heartbreaks!\n\n3) Kinna Sohna Tainu\n\nFor all those times when NFAK described our feelings for our crush better than us!\n\n4) Sanu Ek Pal Chain Na Aawe\n\nAdmit it or not, we all have had this number on repeat at least once in our lives!\n\n5) Tum Ek Gorakhdhanda Ho\n\nListen to this with your eyes closed at night and you will surely tear up because of the overwhelming aura NFAK creates with his magical voice in this Sufi composition.\n\n6) Jane Kab Honge Kam Is Duniya Kay Gham\n\nThis song shows us the protagonist side of Nusrat Saab who in a soulful voice raises his concerns over the atrocities being committed all over the world.\n\n7) Afreen Afreen\n\nThe fact that Coke Studio’s version of Afreen Afreen did not receive much appreciation last year has a lot to do with the earworm rhythmic original which sets a standard that could not be met even by the likes of Rahet Fateh Ali Khan, who does not only belong to the same family but is also one of the best singers of our generation. See for yourself what I am talking about!\n\n8) Tere Bin Nahi Lagda Dil Mera Sohnya\n\nAgain, a song that has many renditions but none has succeeded in creating a melody like the percussion- soaked original! Tere Bin Nahi Lagda is indeed among Nusrat Saab’s masterpieces.\n\n9) Gurus of Peace – Chanda Suraj Lakhon Taare\n\nOne of the most famous international collaborations of NFAK, Gurus of Peace – Chanda Suraj Lakhon Taare was produced by and for A. R. Rahman’s 1997 album, “Vaande Mataram”. This was the first time that an Indian and Pakistani artist came together to create music with the purpose of spreading peace and love, an initiative much needed at that time.\n\n10) Wohi Khuda Hai\n\nNow it’s time for the last and the most obvious pick, Wohi Khuda Hai which I consider is a wholly unique venture. No list of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s hits is complete without this name. Based on a simple melody, this hamd has what it takes to soothe a savage breast and that too effortlessly. Its mesmerizing sound transports a person to another world where there are no distractions and a man feels closer to his Creator.\n\nWe know that the list misses out many other great compositions of Khan Saab for which he is remembered but no matter how long is the list, it cannot justly celebrate the work of this maestro. We will remain indebted to Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan for his contribution in making the world a better place through his music and giving us one more reason to be proud of our motherland."
