        "text": "1 year, 10 months ago | 1,474 views | Comments 0 | Share 0\n\n74th birth anniversary of the world renowned Pakistani musician and legendary “Qawaal’’ Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan was observed on Thursday.\n\nHe was popularly known as “Shahenshah-e-Qawwal”.\n\nHe was born in Faisalabad on 13th October 1948. He was a pioneer of fusion music in Pakistan.\n\nUstad Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan was the first musician to blend eastern and western musical styles together.\n\nHe introduced his Qawali traditions to international level.\n\nHis name is included in Guinness Book of World Record for the largest recorded output by a Qawwali artist, a total 125 albums.\n\nDum mast Qalandar, Wohi khuda hai, Kasy da yar na bichry, tumhy dillagi bhooljani paryge, Jany kb hon gy km, Tera inam Pakistan are some of the maestro’s work of the King of Qawal.\n\nHe was awarded the Pride of Performance award by the Government of Pakistan for his contribution to the promotion of music.\n\nNusrat Fatah Ali Khan received the UNESCO Music Prize and Legends award at the UK Asian Music Awards in 2005.\n\nUSTAD NUSRAT FATEH ALI KHAN is credited for having introduced the form of qawwali music to Western audiences, something that no one from the east had done before.\n\nHe possessed one of the greatest voices ever recorded in the history of music as a performing art and could sing qawwalis at high intensity for up to 10 hours at a stretch.\n\nHe was also the first qawwali singer to have been nominated for a Grammy award, albeit both his nominated albums Intoxicated Spirit and Night Song were in collaboration with foreign musicians.\n\nHe is the only singer to have had a dedicated tribute band in New York City, which is called the Brooklyn Qawwali Party, founded by Brook Martinez. The band was formed 6 years after his death, marking how he made the whole world a fan of the qawwali music.\n\nHe died of lungs cancer in 1997."
