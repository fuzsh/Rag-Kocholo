        "text": "Growing up in the 80s & 90s, Qawwali was the staple music in our Muslim household. A form of devotional Sufi music with origins in ancient Islamic poetry and brought to the west in the 20th century by the incomparable master of Sufi singing, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Qawwali music is a form of art popular in South Asia with a tradition which stretches back for 700 years. Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was responsible for bringing Qawwali music from Pakistan to the Western world. His personal impact on my personal life & memories on earth are innumerable. Just as American gospel music spawned a whole pop industry of soul music, traditional qawwali developed a commercial aspect which attracts young listeners and international audiences. Both forms have transcended their ritual contexts and their traditional audiences, yet, in both cases, the original spirit of devotion and energy remain intact. One need not be be a Sufi, a Muslim, a Pakistani or of South Asian heritage to listen to and enjoy qawwali.\n\nBorn in Faisalabad to a Muslim Punjabi family, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan had his first public performance at the age of 15. He became the head of the family qawwali party in 1971 and brought his unique style of sargam, khayal, and rhythm to his family’s legacy. Signed by Oriental Star Agencies, Birmingham, England, in the early 1980s, Khan went on to release movie scores and albums in Europe, India, Japan, Pakistan, and the U.S. He engaged in collaborations and experiments with Western artists, becoming a well-known “world music” artist.\n\nOn the 15th of January, 2024, I had the distinct pleasure of meeting the magical Ustad Shahid Ali Khan, student of the magnificent & untouchable Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. In 2002, Ustad Shahid Ali Khan performed in front of Queen Elizabeth II in Hamilton, Ontario. The second photo below is Shahid Ali Khan with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in a photo dated 10/11/1995. There are many more.\n\nI was accompanied by my son Zinedine Ali Khan & fellow artist Haleema Khan that evening. The thundering performance made hours seem like minutes, creating a trance we may never come back from. It was the closest i’ve ever come to hearing an almost identical musical performance to that of the real flesh and blood NFAK.\n\nTabla Percussion was by Waris Ali Khan, student of the great Sajjad Ali Khan & the great Dildar Hussain who played with NFAK for 30 years. Also performing were the legends Sajid Ali Khan, Shahzaib Ali Khan, Wajid Ali Khan, the sons of Ustad Shahid Ali Khan. The remaining team consisted of renown North American keyboard player Nadeem Ali, Majid Ali Khan, Javed Sarfraz, Saleem Mohammed & Bhadur Faryad. With great respect, Ustad Shahid Ali Khan introduced me to Lucky Kaur Bhardwaj. We agreed to stay in touch to work on something together.\n\nTo understand Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s influence on world music however, i’ve prepared a summary of just who Ustad Shahid Ali Khan’s teacher was. It follows.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan was ranked the fourth greatest singer of all time by LA Weekly in 2016. According to Alexandra Seno of Asiaweek, “Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s voice was otherworldly. For 25 years, his mystical songs transfixed millions. It was not long enough … He performed qawwali, which means wise or philosophical utterance, as nobody else of his generation did. His vocal range, talent for improvisation and sheer intensity were unsurpassed.”\n\nHe toured extensively, performing in over 40 countries. In addition to popularizing qawwali music, he also had a profound impact on contemporary South Asian popular music, including Pakistani pop, Indian pop, and Bollywood music.\n\nThe two singing sisters of Bollywood, Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar sang for the songs he composed in his brief stint in Bollywood. He also sang “Saya Bhi Saath Jab Chhod Jaye” for Sunny Deol’s movie Dillagi. The song was released in 1999, two years after Khan’s death. He also sang “Dulhe Ka Sehra” from the Bollywood movie Dhadkan which was released in 2000 and continues to be a floor smasher to this day.\n\nNFAK inspired A. R. Rahman whom he collaborated with. Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan contributed the song “Gurus of Peace” to the 1997 album Vande Mataram, composed by Rahman, and released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of India’s independence. As a posthumous tribute, Rahman later released an album titled Gurus of Peace which included “Allah Hoo” by Khan. Rahman’s 2007 song “Tere Bina” for the film Guru was also composed as a tribute to Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nHis wildest Canadian connection however is this: He collaborated with the creator of the “Infinite Guitar”, Toronto-born Canadian guitarist, inventor, music producer, and film music composer Michael Brook three separate times in the 90s. Brook was studying music and electronics at York University during those times and worked as an engineer at Grant Avenue studios, then owned by the Lanois brothers where he worked with Brian Eno.\n\nHe contributed music to the official soundtracks for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Natural Born Killers (1994) and Dead Man Walking (1995). British-Indian producer Bally Sagoo released a remix of “Tere Bin Nahin Lagda”, which was later featured in the 2002 British film Bend It Like Beckham, starring Keira Knightley. He is known as the Singing Buddah in Japan.\n\nIn February 2016, a rough mix of a song recorded by Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1998 called “Circle of the Noose” was leaked to the internet. Guitarist Dave Navarro described the song saying, “It’s pop in the sense of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, hook. I really love it and we use a loop of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. It’s really nice. The best way I can describe it is it’s like pepped-up ’60s folk with ’90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it’s not, it moves.”\n\nAlthough he recorded for labels in Pakistan, England and Europe, he was barely known in the U.S. pop mainstream until he toured with Peter Gabriel’s 1985 WOMAD festival. Peter Gabriel was the original lead singer of Genesis. A champion of world music for much of his career, Gabriel co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982 & joined Cat Stevens on stage to perform “Wild World” during Nelson Mandela’s 46664 concert. At the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Gabriel performed John Lennon’s “Imagine”.\n\nHe said about NFAK “Unlike many artists working with devotional music Nusrat was very open and very generous and willing to try almost anything with anyone who was enthusiastic and it was great for us that we had the wonderful chance to work with him on the Passion soundtrack. It was probably the most magical evening of that whole recording and there’s a scene in the film with Christ carrying the cross and it is deeply spiritual music for me and I think Scorsese too was delighted with that performance and it’s really Nusrat’s voice that builds it and lifts it.” In that very performance, Shahid Ali Khan’s voice is part of the blend; he is the background singer.\n\nKhan signed to a U.S. record deal with Rick Rubin’s American Recordings in mid-1996, and he recorded at least a few songs with Rubin.\n\nJeff Buckley said about him, “I have never heard so much spirit in a voice. My two main singing inspirations, Nusrat and Otis Redding, have been the supreme examples of how far and deep a voice can go in finding, touching and moving the soul.”\n\nOn 13 October 2015, Google celebrated Khan’s 67th birthday with a doodle on its homepage in six countries, including India, Pakistan, Japan, Sweden, Ghana, and Kenya; calling him the person “who opened the world’s ears to the rich, hypnotic sounds of the Sufis.” “Thanks to his legendary voice, Khan helped bring ‘world music’ to the world.”\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan was a two-time GRAMMY award winner."
