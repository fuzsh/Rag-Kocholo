CHAPTER I. GENERAL ASPECTS.— THE COUNTRY AND ITS INHABITANTS. Geographical Position. — Geology.* ^ RANGE occupies a medium extent amongst those countries of the world which have played a distinct part in politics and in the history of civilisation. Smaller in area than either China, Russia, the Brazils, or the United States, it is nevertheless far more con- siderable than that of either Greece, Portugal, Switzerland, Holland, or even of England, all of which have left their mark upon the march of human history. Scarcely covering the 225th part of the habitable portion of the globe, its dense population ha« nevertheless enabled it to play a part quite out of propor- tion to its area. It would be presumptuous if we claimed on behalf of France a sort of moral hegemony amongst the nations of the world. Still, within the comparatively small territory bounded by the Alps and Britany, by the Pyrenees and Vosges, there have taken place events whose influence has made itself felt to the farthest corners of the world. In arts and science France has found worthy rivals since the beginning of this century, and there are other nations which claim to march at the head of civilisation. But this merely proves that the area of the civilised world has been enlarged — that there are other nations capable of giving birth to initiatory movements. But France has at all times performed her share of this work of human progress, and looking to the influence which her ideas have exercised throughout the world, it would be difficult to conceive a future history of nations with France blotted from the map of Europe. To a very large extent * Dufrenoy et £lie de Beaumont, \" Memoires pour servir a ime Description geologique de la France.\" 36 2 . FRANCE. the inhabitants of France are indebted for the eminent position they hold to the climate, the soil, and the geographical features of the country which they inhabit, and a faithful description of these will be our task in the following pages. It has often been said that France enjoys exceptional advantages from its position between the Mediterranean and the open ocean. This position has made it the intermediary between the old countries of the Mediterranean and Northern Fig. 1. — The Contour of France. ^^ 1^ 1^ l*^ l7 f^^^ Actual ioundtay . ^J!cj- &. diagonaia of/yanc&. Europe. Nowhere else in Europe is communication between the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic equally facile. The plains of Poland and Russia may offer fewer obstacles to intercommunication, but the Baltic and the Black Sea, which they unite, are remote inland seas. In Central Europe the Alps are an obstacle to the exchange of ideas and merchandise between the North Sea and the Adriatic, but in France great natural highways join the Atlantic and Mediter- ranean ports and river basins. Mountainous Europe may be said to terminate at GEOGEAPHICAL POSITION.-GEOLOGY. 3 the foot of the Cevennes, and the great diagonals of the western portion of that continent, viz. that drawn from Germany to the Iberian peninsula, and that connecting Italy with England, intersect each other within the boundaries of France, which is thus marked out by nature as the great centre in which European thought may be elaborated, where North and South may exchange their ideas. The contour of France is distinguished by compactness no less than by a certain elegance. A meridian passing through the capital connects the two extreme points of the territory, dividing it into two symmetrical portions in such a manner as to form an octagon. Oceanic alternate with land boundaries, and these latter for the most part consist of mountain chains, which separate France very distinctly from neighbouring countries. The principal of these natural frontier ranges are the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Jura, the Vosges, and the Ardennes.* We may even include amongst these bastions the granitic heights of the Armorican peninsula, which overlook the fields of Normandy and Anjou to the west. To these sterile hills France is probably indebted for not having been conquered by England, for if Britany had been capable of attracting hardy Anglo-Saxon settlers, it would have formed a link between Guyenne and Normandy, and these provinces might then have remained for ever in the posses- sion of the foreigner. Curiously enough, it is the highest amongst these frontier ranges which separate the French from nations of kindred origin, whilst the less elevated ranges consti- tute the boundaries towards the Germanic countries. The Pyrenees, a most formidable barrier, hardly to be passed in winter, divide France from Spain ; the Alps, an obstacle almost equally formidable, separate it from Italy. But farther north, the Jura and the Vosges, which are of comparatively small height, separate the French from the German-speaking populations, whilst in the north-east, in the direction of the ravined plateau of the Ardennes, the boundary in certain parts is completely open and quite conventional. The frontier there has varied much in accordance with the fortunes of war, but the two conterminous races did not assimilate. In the south, however, had there not been the Pyrenees and the Alps, it is to be assumed that instead of three Latin nations — French, Spaniards, and Italians — each possessed of some special genius, there would now be but one. France is thus doubly privileged. Its southern mountain barriers have pre- served it from a premature fusion with other Latin nations, whilst in the north, where the frontier is open, it was preserved by the natural antagonism of race, and yet, owing to the facilities of communication, it rendered possible an extensive commerce and an exchange of ideas. Paris, placed close to this open frontier, was thus marked out by nature as the capital of the country : valleys and hills con- verge upon it ; it is the principal seat of commerce and industry, and whether in peace or war has always held the foremost place. The physical features of the interior of France are harmonious in their very * Development of coast-line, not including indentations of less than three miles, 1,939 miles (Channel 696, Atlantic 861, Mediterranean .382 miles).

A granitic j)lateau of a triangular contour occupies the centre of the country. In the east it is bounded by the deep valley through which flow the Saone and the Rhone ; on the south-west it is bounded by the valley of the Garonne, whilst its north-eastern boundary runs parallel with the Loire. The granitic mountain of Eouergue and the heights of Morvan are attached to this plateau-like peninsula. Porphyries and lavas have been erupted through the granites forming the nucleus of this plateau, and on all sides it is enveloped by rocks of more recent age, as the bones of a human body are by flesh. This comparison may be carried even further, and we may liken the granites and other ancient rocks of the Alps and Pyrenees, of Poitou, Britany, and Cotentin, of the Vosges and Ardennes, to the skeleton, whilst the sedimentary rocks depo- sited in the valleys separating them represent the flesh. A zone of Jurassic limestones surrounds almost completely the granitic moun- tain mass of Central France, spreading out in the north-east along the foot of the Vosges and Ardennes, and bounding in the north-west the peninsula of Britany. A corresponding zone of cretaceous rocks extends along the northern foot of the Pyrenees, from sea to sea, whilst the crystalline rock masses of the Alps rise above the strata of Jurassic formation. The space occupied by rocks of more recent origin than the chalk and Jurassic limestones is of small extent. Geological formations and the relief of the soil divide France into a number of historical and geographical regions. The elevated granitic plateau of the interior, as well as the mountain barriers on the frontiers, must at all times have exercised a deterrent influence upon the surrounding populations, whilst the rich and fertile plains extending between them proved a powerful attraction. The rugged plateaux, however, offered a secure shelter, whilst the plains were open at all times to the incursions of enemies. Down in the valleys man struggled for the posses- sion of the land ; in the mountains he held it securely. The historical contrast between this barren central plateau and the surrounding lowlands is very evident. The valley of the Rhone in the east, the basins of the Garonne and the Charente in the west and south-west, and the huge bend of the Seine in the north, pulsate with life, and the number of mountaineers who descended into these inviting plains has been greater by far than that of the lowlanders who sought a home in the moun- tains, for men, like water, always travel downhill. The direction of the great historical highway's of France has necessarily been influenced by the configuration of the .soil thus indicated. From Paris routes radiate in all directions towards the north, the east, and the west, for there they encounter no obstacles, but to the south of the Seine and the Loire these routes had to accommodate themselves to the relief of the soil, and there are in reality but two of them, viz. the great Roman road which leads across the lowest part of the plateau of the Cote d'Or into the valley of the Rhone, and which Ca}sar followed when he invaded Gaul ; and the great Iberian road, which passes to the west of the central plateau. A third natural highway joins the extremities of these two roads in the south. This latter skirts the southern slopes of the Cevennes, and joins the Mediterranean to the basin of the Garonne.

It has been noticed that the larger towns along these roads are generally two stages apart, the intermediate stages being marked by places of less consequence. In fact, these towns were originally merely military stages, the distances being accommodated to the marching powers of infantry and cavalry. Fjcv. 2.— Thf, HisTOKicAL High-roads of France. Where exceptions occur, they are due to special features of the soil or to the neces- sities of commerce. In our own days railways have almost annihilated space, and towns no longer grow up at such regular intervals. It would be interesting to ascertain the great routes of the migration of man and animals in prehistoric times. But this is a matter of no inconsiderable diffi- culty. Constant Prevost, Delesse, and others have attempted to construct maps exhibiting France during various geological epochs, but their value is merely 6 FRANCE. conjectural, for, irrespectively of the uncertainty still existing with regard to the age of certain rocks, it is almost impossible to tell to what extent the more ancient formations have disappeared, owing to subsidence or denudation. In the Silurian age it would appear Gaul consisted merely of an elongated peninsula extending from where the Alps are now to modem Britany. Subse- quently a wide strait separated this peninsula from a few Alpine masses, then recently upheaved above the ocean, whilst newly formed land joined it to the Fig. 3. — LiTHOLOGicAL Map of the Buitish Channel, showixg the Ancient Connection between Bkitany and England.

Delesse's lithological map, shows where the union between the two BritanieS existed. When the liassic strata were being deposited in the gulfs of the sea, the contours of the great plateau of Limousin and its outer fringe, consisting of the Cevennes, the Forez, and the Morvan, were pretty much as they are now, excepting that a deep strait intersected the southern portion. Four wide arms of the sea separated this plateau from the Ardennes and Yosges, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and Britany. The framework of modern France had thus become CLIMATE.-RIVEES. 7 apparent, and each subsequent formation helped to fill it up. During the cretaceous age the central plateau was finally united on the one hand to Britany, and on the other to the Vosges and the Ardennes : Boulonnais rose like an island in the centre of the sea to the north. At the commencement of the tertiary age this sea had become a gulf, the estuaries of the Garonne and the Adour had much diminished in size, lakes were drained or filled up by alluvial deposits, and at the time of the last glacial epoch, the date of which cannot be fixed even approximately, the contour and relief of France were nearly what they are now. The innumerable agencies, however, which change the surface of the land are still at work : mountains are being washed away, lakes silted up, rivers change their courses, extend their deltas, or enlarge their estuaries, while secular oscillations of the land efiect changes along the coast. As regards these latter an upheaval during historic times has been distinctly traced along the Mediterranean coasts. On the Atlantic seaboard the coast of the Landes has subsided ; to the north of the Gironde we meet with incontestable proofs of an upheaval ; and along the British Channel there are again indications of a subsidence, which extends through the Netherlands as far as Denmark and the southern shores of the Baltic. These slow movements have resulted in changes which have exercised an appreciable influence upon the march of history. Climate. — Rivers.* There can be no doubt that the cHmate of France has undergone changes since the beginning of the historical period, although it would be difficult precisely to deter- mine their extent. The destruction of forests, the draining of swamps, and the embankment of rivers must necessarily have affected local climates. There exist no precise data in that respect, for exact meteorological observations are only of recent growth, but a few general considerations prove it incontestably. Certain plants can no longer be cultivated at the same altitude as during the Middle Ages : olive, fig, and orange trees have retired farther south ; the vine no longer grows in Picardy and along the Channel. This retreat of certain plants, however, may be due to our improved means of communication with countries where their cultivation yields a richer harvest than under the inclement northern skies, and we cannot therefore conclude from it that the climate of France has deteriorated since the Middle Ages. But that changes in the climate have nevertheless taken place is amply proved by an examination of our fossiliferous strata, from which we learn that a sub-tropical and an arctic climate succeeded each other at intervals. France at the present moment is divided into two climatic zones by the gra- nitic masses of the great central plateau. The mean temperature to the north of that barrier varies between 50° and 54° F., whilst to the south of it it gradually rises to 59°. The contrasts are still greater if we take into account the moistuie of the air, rainfall, winds, and all those other meteorological phenomena which constitute climate. We then find that the northern Atlantic slopes of France * Bourlot, \" VariatioDS de Latitude et de Climat.\" 8 FRANCE. form a portion of Western Europe, whilst the southern Mediterranean slopes are almost African in their aspect. Eastern and Western France contrast likewi.5e, though not in so marked a manner. The Atlantic coasts are exposed to the influence of the gulf-stream and of warm south-westerly winds, and their temperature is more elevated than might be concluded from their latitudes. As we proceed inland the warm Atlantic Fig. 4. — Isothermal Lines of Fp By M. Eenou, 7I el si 4I jI zl 4 »|«/flzrj current gradually loses its power, westerly winds blow less frequently, and the mean temperature of Cherbourg is thus nearly 3° higher than that of Verdun, in spite of its lower latitude. But this decrease in mean temperature is not the only contrast between the extreme west of France and the inland districts, for the seasons in these latter present greater differences. The climate along the Atlantic coast is essentially a maritime one, and the differences between the extremes of temperature are not CLIMATE.— EIVEES. 9 very great. In the east, where the equalising influence of the ocean is less felt, the summers are warmer, the winters more severe than on the coast. The farther we proceed inland the more will lines of equal winter and summer temperature be found to differ. Localities in Eastern France, whose mean annual temperature is inferior to that of localities on the coast, nevertheless enjoy a higher tempera- ture than the latter during summer. The influence which these varying con- Fig. 5. — Lines of Eqval Winter and Summer Temperature for Paris.

The mean direction of the winds in France has been computed by Kaemtz and Martens at S. 88° W. ; that is to say, they blow up the lower valley of the Loire. The proportions between easterly and westerly winds is as 100 to 152, that 37 10 FRANCE. between northerly and southerly winds as 100 to 103. The preponderance of westerly and southerly winds would be still more marked, did not the Pyrenees oppose an obstacle to their progress. Along the Atlantic seaboard north-westerly winds prevail, on the Channel south-westerly winds. Their direction, as a matter of course, is modified by local causes and the configuration of the land ; but thus much may be assumed as certain, that the atmosphere of France is being continually renewed from the west. In the valley of the Lower Rhone, which forms almost a world of its own as regards climate, the direction of the winds is quite different : they blow up and down this narrow valley, either from the Mediterranean or from the north. Between the Spanish frontier and the Rhone, as well as to the east of that river as far as the Hyeres, north-westerly winds predominate, whilst along the valley of the Rhone itself the prevailing wind blows from the north, in the direction of the Mediterranean. Thus, whilst the Atlantic slopes of France are exposed to a preponderance of sea breezes, it is the land winds which prove victorious on the Mediterranean slopes. The configuration of the soil exercises as great an influence upon the distribu- tion of the rain as it does upon the direction of the winds. The country, in that respect, may be divided into three zones. Summer rains prevail in the north and in the centre, as also in Germany and nearly the whole of continental Europe ; autumn rains prevail in the west ; and on the Mediterranean slopes two rainy seasons can be distinguished, viz. one in the beginning of the year, the other in autumn : summer rains are rare there. The amount of rain varies exceedingly in different localities. Along the sea it is generally abundant ; the quantity decreases as we proceed inland, but the mountains in the interior of the country form a second region where the pre- cipitation is considerable, and on a map of France showing the distribution of rainfall these mountain ranges stand out very distinctly. As a general rule the quantity of rain increases from west to east, and from north to south ; that is, in the direction in which the land rises. In the south, where the air owing to higher temperature is capable of holding a greater amount of moisture in suspen- sion, the rain after storms sometimes descends in torrents. Upon the whole, however, the rainfiiU near the Mediterranean is less than near the Atlantic, and the air there is drier, a feature sufiiciently explained by the prevalence of land winds. There are only three stations in France at which the annual rainfall approaches eighty inches. These are the Pyrenees of Gavarnie, which inter- cept the moist winds blowing from the Bay of Biscay ; the mountains of the Tanargue, between the sources of the Ardeche and Loire ; and the Alps to the north of Gap. On the western slopes of the mountains and on the plateau of Limousin the rainfall exceeds forty inches. It is least in a district embracing Meaux, Troyes, Epernay, and Compiegne, which is remote from the sea as well as from the mountain region, is badly wooded, and consists for the most part of chalk. At Dunkirk, likewise, it rains but little, for the winds prevailing there part with CLIMATE.— EIVERS. 11 their moisture whilst passing across England. From a careful computation made by M. Delesse it appears that the rainfall throughout France averages 30 -S inches. The number of rainy days varies quite as much as the amount of rain. At Abbeville rain falls on 175 days in the year, at Lille on 169 days, whilst Marseilles has only 55 and Hyeres 40 rainy days. As a rule the number •of rainy days decreases as we travel towards the south-east, and where this is the case the rains are proportionately heavy. Storms, which occur generally during summer, afflict as a rule the centre and the east of the country, and M. Becquerel has shown that they blow ordinarily along the great valleys. Speaking broadly, France may be divided into seven climatic regions, of which that of the great granitic plateau occupies the centre. Britany, in the north-west, is remarkable for its equable temperature , the northern region, named after its principal river the Seine, is distinguished by a paucity of rain ; while in the region of the Mouse and the Vosges the extremes between cold and heat are greatest. The three southern regions are distributed in an analogous manner. The climate of the Gironde and of the Rhone is mild and humid ; that of the Mediterranean is changeable ; heavy rains alternate with periods of drought, and the winds are high.* The climate of a country is reflected to a great extent in its rivers. Unless these are fed by glaciers or flow for considerable distances underground, they reflect the succession of seasons very fairly. Great is the contrast between the torrents of the Mediterranean and the rivers and rivulets of hilly Britany. On the southern slopes of the Cevennes, scorched in turn by the sun or lashed by showers of rain, the torrent beds, dry during the greater part of the year, are converted after rains into mighty rivers, sweeping before them vast masses of debris. These wadis of Languedoc differ most essentially from the quiet rivulets of Normandy and Britany, which flow steadily throughout the year, and scarcely ever overflow their banks. The rivers of France flow in opposite directions towards the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The Rhone, rising in a glacier like the Rhine, and flowing through a large lake, takes its course to the south. Where it traverses the plain which formerly was merely a gulf of the sea, it receives numerous tributaries descending from the Alps and the Cevennes, and when the alluvium brought down by it shall have filled up the Lion Gulf, it will number amongst its affluents Clta^tic Region.. ^J_^^ itS>S!\"\"^^ik,er. * Limoiisin (Limoges) .... 51-8 — — Britany (Brest) 5i-l 62-2 44-8 The Seine (Paris) .50-0 646 37-9 Vosges (Nancy) oO'O 65-1 35-2 Gironde (Bordeaux) .... 56-3 7M 43-0 Rhone (Lyons) .53-2 70-0 37-1 Mediterranean (Montpellier) .

On the other hand, the rivers flowing down the Atlantic slope take a divergent course, and a line drawn through their sources is much shorter than one con- necting their estuaries. As to Britany, it constitutes a hydrographical region apart; and neither its commanding position nor its excellent harbours have countervailed the disadvantage of its lying outside the great river systems of , France.

THE PREHISTORIC AGE OF FRANCE. 13 The rain which finds its way through rivers to the sea is one of the most powerful geological agents. The ravines and valleys of the Pyrenees, the Cevennes, the Alps, and the Jura exhibit its power of erosion : the layers of sand and mud deposited along the banks of the Loire after floods testify to its giving birth to new land, and at the mouths of the Ehone we may see how a river causes the land to encroach upon the sea. The fecund soil of the Limagne, Touraine, Agenais, and Bigorre, those gardens of France, is entirely a gift of the rivers. The rivers, owing to the fertility of their banks, have proved the most power- ful agents of civilisation in France, as everywhere else. In former times they alone were available for the transport of merchandise and travellers on a large scale, and most of the great towns grew up on their banks. Towns not situated on navigable rivers, such as Nimes, Montpellier, Dijon, and Reims, were mere stages on the roads connecting these river highways. Roads and railways have to some extent deprived the rivers of the importance they enjoyed in former times, and considerable towns have sprung up far away from them, near mines, mineral springs, or fine scenery.

Luchon are of this class. The rivers, on the other hand, are being rendered more useful to man from day to day. Canals are dug to connect them or to irrigate the fields in their vicinity, embankments are thrown up to regulate them, and their water is rendered available as a motive power. Still most of their water is allowed to run to waste, and the day is yet apparentlj^ very distant when they will be exhaustively utilised in the service of man. The Prehistoric Age of France.* France had its inhabitants long before the events of history were placed on record. Human bones mixed with those of animals, rude implements of peace and war, and rudimeutary works of art amply prove this. With Belgium and the basins of the Rhine it is probably richer in these prehistoric remains than any other country, and many caves and heaps of debris have become famous on account of them. Anthropologists are generally agreed that the most ancient examples of human * Hamy, \" Paleontologie humaine;\" Gabriel de Mortillet, \"Tableau archeologique de la Gaule ; \" Lartet et Chriaty, \" Reliquiie Aquitanicse ; \" Broca, \" Compte-rendu du Congrea intern, de Paria, 1867.\" 14 FEAJSTCE. workmanship are the flint implements discovered by M. Bourgoing near Thenay, in the valley of the Cher. In the tertiary age, when the contemporaries of acero- therium and mastodon fashioned these rude implements, the aspect of France was very different from what it is now, and there existed neither the same plants nor the same animals. Centxu-ies passed away, and the men who dwelt in the plains bordering upon the Somme and the Seine, on the plateaux of Central France, and along the foot of the Pyrenees had learnt to fashion flint implements of a superior kind, and with these they pursued the elephants, hippopotami, rhinoceroses, and other animals which at that time roamed over the lands of the Gauls. At a subsequent period, when the rhinoceros had been exterminated, when man had expelled the bears from the caverns to dwell therein himself, and when the horse, with the mammoth, was one of the commonest animals, these stone implements began to be fashioned in greater variety, to serve the needs of hunters, fishing, and domestic labour. Later still, the bones and horns of animals were made use of, and frequently the figures of animals and even of men were engraved upon them. Artists must have lived at that time, though their names are for ever lost to us. Ornaments and figures which they engraved upon their stag-horns are the same in style as those met with subsequently on the vases dating back to the age of dolmens, on the arms of the ancient Gauls, and even on some Gallo-Roman monuments. Once launched upon the path of invention, man never turns back. Some sort of relapse appears to have taken place after the reindeer age, but this applies only to the ornamentation, and may be accounted for by an inflow of immigrants inferior in civilisation to the older inhabitants of the country. At the same time new weapons came into use ; man had acquired the art of polishing stones, and of making durable earthenware. Later still he learnt to cultivate the soil, and to traia domestic animals. The old cave dwellings no longer sufficed for his wants, houses arose in the plains, and solid structures of stone were erected by the men of the neolithic age, wherein to deposit their dead. They threw up entrenchments as a defence against enemies, and those who lived along the margins of rivers or lakes erected their dwellings upon piles, thus securing themselves against unex- pected attacks. In France itself the^^e lake dwellings are scarce, but they abound in Switzerland. No written record or tradition reaches back to that neolithic aofe, but we know from the objects discovered in tombs and dwellings that bronze had come into use. Imported from abroad, we find it applied to the most varied uses, either cast or wrought. A new era began with the introduction of iron, which was fashioned not only into weapons, but also into tools of every description. Thenceforth human art and industry took a rapid development. The numerous grave-hills scattered over the country abound in curious objects deposited there by the relations of the defunct. History begins to dawn, and we find ourselves in the j)resence of those tribes of various races formerly known as Gauls. There can be no doubt that the most populous districts of modern France were also the centres of civilisation of the Celtic, Iberian, and Ligurian ancestors of the THE PREHISTORIC AGE OP PRANCE. 15 modern French, although no traces of them have been discovered there. Their towns have vanished, ruins have succeeded ruins, until all remains of the ancient occupiers of the land have been reduced to dust. If we would find traces of them we must penetrate into the woods, and into those remote parts of the country where the population has at all times been thinly sown. The heaths of Britany and the plateaux of Poitou still abound in dolmens and menhirs ; in the woods of Franche-Comte grave-hills are met with in thousands ; on the granitic soil of Central France we may still trace the pits which formed the underground story of the Gallic houses ; whilst the pine woods of the Landes abound in vast trenches (e/ofes), which mayhap sheltered the population of a village until it was driven forth by invading Celts or Basques. But these dwellings, remote as they were from the centres of civilisation, can hardly convey an idea of the con- Fig. 8. — Dol-er-Vekchant, or Merchants' Table, at Locmariaker. dition of the population of ancient France, any more than an idea of our jM-esent century could be obtained from the half-obliterated ruius of our out-of-the-way hamlets. Ever since the tertiary age the surface of France has been changing slowly through geological agencies, and without catastrophes. We may assume, there- fore, that the population of modern France has in its veins some of the blood of these ancient tribes. The invading conquerors of France have become amalga- mated with the tribes whom they found living there, and thus arose a race resembling a trunk with thousands of roots, and known as the French \" nation.\" \"We cannot otherwise explain the astonishing variety of types met with in the different provinces of France. As M. Andre Sanson says, \" We are the intel- lectual sons of the Aryans, but not their carnal sons.\" 16 FEANOE. The most ancient human remains hitherto discovered in France date back to the quaternary epoch, for miocene man, who wrought the tools discovered at Thenay, has left no trace. To judge from the skulls discovered under the lava of Denise, near the Puy-en-Velay, in Auvergne, the men of that period were long-skulled, but towards the close of the age of the mammoth and the bear, short skulls are first met with. Archaeologists are agreed that the men who dwelt in the caverns of the Pyrenees, on the Vezere and the Aveyron, were kinsmen of the Laps, Saraoyeds, and Eskimos. Their mode of life, their weapons and imple- ments, and even their style of ornamentation, all appear to support that conclusion. An invasion of barbarians destroyed the civilisation then attained, but gave birth in the end to a new era of civilisation much superior in many respects. The Inhabitants of France.* The Iberians are the most ancient inhabitants of Gaul known to history. They were kinsmen of those of Spain, who traded with Phoenicians and Greeks, and whom the latter looked upon as aborigines. These Iberians occupied the country between the Atlantic Ocean and the Garonne, as well as the valleys of the eastern Pyrenees. In the west they were associated with the Ligurians of the Mediter- ranean, and elsewhere lihey came into contact with Celtic or Kymric tribes. Though Latinised, they have in a large extent their race characteristics ; they have even retained their ancient appellation of Gascons and Basques, and near the Pyrenees they retain their old language. Basques, Bearnais, and Gascons can easily be distinguished from other Frenchmen ; they are full of natural grace, supple of limb and mind, gay when at work, brave, though boastful, talkative, and imaginative to the extent of sometimes allowing themselves to be carried beyond the bounds of truth. The Celts, a race quite distinct from the Iberians, occupied the country to the north of the Garonne. Most modern Frenchmen look upon these as their veri- table ancestors, though very little is known about them. Ancient authors can hardly assist us in elucidating this point, for they wrote about the regions beyond the Alps much as our ancestors wrote about Central Africa. Modern historians, led away by false patriotism or by a rage for classification, have still further obscured this question, which is only in recent times being cleared up by the discovery of arms, weapons, dwellings, and human remains hidden for agea beneath the soil. Williams, Edwards, and Broca have shown satisfactorily, from a comparison of skulls and bones thus discovered, that ancient Gaul was inhabited by two distinct types of man, in addition to Iberians. The first type is met with between the Garonne and the Seine. These Gauls, or Celts, as they were formerly called, were small of stature, of a brown complexion, and short- skulled, whilst the tribes in the north-east, whether we call them Belgs or Kymri, were tall, fair, and long-skulled. * A.

THE INHABITANTS OF FEANCE. 17 Ancient authors only describe these latter, probably because they were the most warlike. The men described by Ammianus Marcellinus, like the Gauls repre- sented by Roman and Greek sculptors, rather resemble Scandinavians, and they were certainly not the direct ancestors of the present inhabitants of Central France. Subjected tribes of a different type may possibly have lived amongst these Gauls of ancient authors, and been numerically superior to them. At present the physical type of the populations of Southern Europe prevails almost throughout France. We can hardly assume that a slight change in the climate, brought about by time and cultivation, should have exercised an influence sufficient to account for this southern type. Taken as a body, the French are in reality a brown-complexioned people, with heads round rather than oval, with eyes varying between black and Fig. 9. — Pkesumed Dispersion of the Aryan Races according to Ancient Authors. pale brown ; with a stature and muscular development rather below the average, but of strong constitutions and capable of resisting fatigue and privations. Of these ancient Gauls there now exist only geographical names and a few short inscriptions. To judge from these their language appears to have differed very much from the dialects spoken in Great Britain, and to have had more affinity with Latin. Still the Aryan nature of the language does not prove that the people who spoke it were of Asiatic origin. Omalius d'Halloy altogether denies that an exodus of Gauls took place from Western Asia, and the map of Aryan migrations prepared by Pictet, though of scientific value, cannot prove it. All we know is that the Gauls dwelt for some time in the valley of the Danube. There can be no doubt that we must trace the existing character of the popula- 18 FRANCE. tion of France back to the tribes who inhabited the country anterior to the historic epoch. Still we must not lose sight of the influence exercised by immigrants of foreign races. The Phoenicians confined themselves to a few factories along the shore of the Mediterranean, and were succeeded by the Greeks, whose colonies — Marseilles, Nice, Agde, and others — were of sufficient importance to enable them to exercise an appreciable influence upon the surrounding populations. Many Greek expressions have survived to our day, and the Marseillais have no doubt reason on their side when they boast of their Hellenic ancestors. The Romans, however, those merciless conquerors of the Gauls, exercised a far greater influence upon the formation of the French nation than did the Greeks. Italian colonists, many of them old soldiers, settled in the coimtry, and this immi- gration, going on for six centuries, led to so considerable an infusion of Roman blood that several towns in the south could fairly be described as daughters of Rome, and the entire population as Gallo-Roman. These physical influences, however, were far surpassed by moral ones. It was the Romans who introduced the ideas and civilisation of the East, and more than all, they made Latin the tongue of the entire country. Language is the mould of thought, and must influence most powerfully the mind of a nation. The French, speaking a Latin tongue, must therefore be ranged amongst the Latin races, in spite of their most diverse origin. Though belonging geographically to the Atlantic countries rather than to the Mediterranean ones, historically France forms a member of these latter, more especially since Algeria has become a French colony. Nevertheless, the barbarians, who after the fall of the Roman empire repeatedly invaded France, whether Franks from the Rhine, Northmen, or Huns from the plateaux of Asia, alwaj^s came from the North. Scandinavian Visigoths established themselves in the south of France, and more especially in the Narbonnaise, and soon adapted themselves to their Gallo-Roman surroundings. The Germanic Burgundians, who occupied Eastern France, are described hy their contemporaries as tull and strong, but at the same time good-natured. The Franks were far more harsh towards the tribes they conquered. In the end they gave a new name to transalpine France, and more particularly to that province of it which is known as He de France. M. Fustel de Coulanges does not think that those early German and Gothic invasions sensibly affected the character of the Gallo-Roman populations. The language and religion, social usages and political institutions, remained the same. But though the Germans never arrived in bodies sufficiently large to change the character of the people, their immigration continued for centuries, and in the end their influence upon its physique became very apparent. M. Broca, in his researches on the stature of Frenchmen, has shown this very clearly (see Fig. 10). The Normans, who settled in that portion of France now known as Normandy, likewise influenced the type of the inhabitants of Neustria. In the south of France \" sea-kings \" of quite a different kind put in an appearance. These were the Saracens, who maintained themselves for a considerable time on the coasts of THE INHABITANTS OF FRANCE. 19 ProYence. In the eighth century, when the Berbers invaded Europe in such overpowering numbers, these Saracens penetrated as far as the valley of the Loire, and perhaps even to Luxeuil and Metz, and the inhabitants of Verdun are said to have carried on a lucrative trade in slaves with them. Colonies of Saracens were established in many parts of France, and there can be no doubt that numbers of the Frenchmen now living in the basins of the Garonne and the Rhone are the remote descendants of Mussulmans.

The small figures indicate the exemptions granted per thousand on account of small stature. Since those invasions of Normans and Moors, the ethnical character of the popu- lation of France has undergone no wholesale change, for the influence of English settlers in Guyenne, of German lansqttenefs and rcihvs who remained in the country at the close of the religious wars, and of the Spaniards in Flanders and Franche- Comte, has been quite of a local nature. On the other hand, the vast peaceable immigration which has been going on for some time past is certainly bringing about changes, and in the presence of the cosmopolitan population of some of the 20 FEANCE. large cities, a stranger may well be puzzled to tell whether it is a Frenchman he has before him or not. It almost appears as if a European type were gradually coming into existence. In the meantime the population of France has been welded into a nation, and in certain respects this nation exhibits greater unity than any other. This cohesion is due not so much to the existence of a centralized government, but rather to historical events, community of interests and of language, and to the existence of a capital which is universally acknowledged as the common national centre. Ancient rivalries between the provinces of France have not, however, alto- gether disappeared. The Bretons, Basques, and Flemish have even retained their distinct language, and the peasants of some of the more remote districts can hardly be said to have been assimilated with the rest of the population. Throughout France, however, these local diversities are of a very subordinate nature, the influence of the great towns is increasing from day to day, and the landmarks between the old provinces have almost disappeared. Of all the inhabitants of France, those living respectively in the north and the south diSer most strikingly. This difierence is accounted for bj' the nature of the country, diversity of historical traditions, and the memories of struggles carried on in a past age. In a great portion of Southern France the Provencal and other dialects are still the dominant tongue, and about twenty years ago French was hardly known by the bulk of the population. But as a literary language these southern dialects have no future, and those even who speak them often hold them in contempt. On looking at the map it will be found that the dialects of Southern France, including the \" langue d'oc \" properly so called, Provencal, Dauphinois, Lyonnais, Auvergnat, Limousin, Gascon, and Bearnais, occupy very nearly one-half the area of the country. Nearly the whole basin of the Rhone, that of the Garonne, and the upper tributaries of the Loire belong to this half, and in the direction of Switzerland it extends even beyond the French frontier and comes into contact with German dialects. The wide range of these southern dialects proves the former preponderance of Southern France in the work of civilisation, but the \" langue d'oil \" is at present steadil)' gaining ground. Language constitutes the strongest tie between man and man. \"We may fairly say that the French language, the origin of which dates back a thousand years, gave birth to the French nation. Common woes may have engendered a sort of fellow-feeling amongst the diverse populations of ancient Gaul ; they nearly all combined in the time of Vercingetorix against their Roman oppressors. But Gaul was merely a geographical expression then, and modern France only dates from the time of the epic poems of the Middle Age. In the course of centuries this language, as well as the men who speak it, has undergone many changes. We can hardly conceive such a thing as an average Frenchman. Those who maintain that the national character has under- gone no changes ever since the Gauls appeared upon the stage of history are THE INHABITANTS OF FRANCE. 21 decidedly in the wrong. There may stiU exist features which recall the Gauls of Cajsar and Strabo, but can it be fairly said of modern French peasants what has been said of the Gauls, that \" they are a people of war and uproar, running through the world with swords in their hands, less, it appears, from avidity than from a vague desire of seeing, knowing, and acting ? \" If we would meet a typical Frenchman, we must searcn for him in a place offering every facility for his development. Such places are the large towns, and more especially Paris, to which original minds fly from the stifling atmo- sphere of small towns and villages. There the natives from every province come into contact and amalgamate : the babbling Gascons, ever in motion ; the men from the plateau, inured to hard work, and slow to make friends ; the people from the Loire, with their quick eyes, lucid intellect, and well-balanced tempera- ment ; the melancholic Breton, always living as in a dream, but full of tenacity in all concerns of real life ; the Norman, slow-speaking, circumspect, and prudent ; and the men from Lorraine, the Vosges, and Franche-Comte, who are quick- tempered and enterprising. All these Frenchmen mutually influence each other, and evolve what may be called the general character of the French people. It is no easy task to sit in judgment over a nation, Since the days of the illustrious Grimm, who denied \" every truly moral sentiment \" to Frenchmen, many foreigners, from envy or ignorance, have painted them in odious colours. On the other hand, there have been writers who have sought to elevate France above all other nations. As to French writers, they have been charged either with being prejudiced in favour of the nation to which they belong, or with unfairly under-estimating its merits ; and, indeed, psychology is one of the most difficult subjects of discussion. Speaking broadly, the character of the French exhibits a combination of northern and southern qualities. The country itself is intermediate between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, and its inhabitants form a link between the Eoman civilisation of the South, and modern times. The most diverse types are met with amongst the French, but, as a whole, they present a new type, in which classical features are replaced by mobility of expression, one-sided energy by varied aptitudes. As a rule Frenchmen, and more especially Frenchwomen, are most impressionable, and they are capable of fully reflecting the ideas conceived by other nations. It is thus that all the great movements of Europe have found a powerful echo in France, if they did not originate there. This explains too the universal character of the French revolutions. It was France which^ pro- claimed the \"Rights of Man,\" and posterity no doubt will praise her for it; it is France which does not allow its progress to be stopped by matters of detail, but always seeks for principles. It is only natural that a nation holding the position of an intermediary of ideas should be eminently sociable. A feeling of inborn goodwill attracts the Frenchman towards his fellow-men, a spirit of equity dictates his conduct \\ he obliges by forethought and captivates by amiability. He is discreet in all tilings, pleasing in dress and manners, without outraging good taste, and excels in the 22 FRANCE. art of conversation. The Frenchwoman is in these respects even a better repre- sentative of the national character. She is not only an excellent mother and housewife, but possesses social qualities of the highest order. She delights by her conversation, and constitutes the chief attraction of French society. It seldom happens that foreigners do not enjoy themselves in France, but a French- man scarcely ever feels perfectly happy in a foreign land, and no one feels more cruelly than he the bitterness of exile. The sons of Gaul are distinguished not only by quickness of comprehension and superior reasoning powers, but they are remarkable amongst all civilised nations for their tact and taste. For a long time they were looked up to as the arbiters in literature, and in certain departments of art they still stand unrivalled. Several of the neighbouring nations are indebted to them for a development of their art industries, and Paris still remains the high school of good taste. France is a busy beehive, as is shown by the immense quantities of French produce exported to other countries. In spite of the excessive subdivision of the soil, the peasant landowners have converted France into one of the most productive countries of Europe. Activity such as this not only testifies to the strength of family ties, but also to the personal worth of the workers. Moreover, the revivals which have succeeded each national disaster prove that the nation is still full of vigour, and fully capable of taking its part in the great works of humanity. But if Frenchmen have their virtues, they also have their faults. Their sociability often degenerates into undue familiarity ; clever talkers on every possible subject, they run the risk of becoming superficial ; men of taste and refinement, they are apt to sacrifice vigour and originality ; too observant of social propriety, they sometimes stifle the voice of their conscience ; members of society or of \" parties,\" they have not always the courage to assert their manly independence. But in these respects how many true men do we meet with in any nation ? But, in spite of all, France has exercised a most powerful influence upon the civilised world. Numerically the influence of Frenchmen grows smaller in proportion as the area held by civilised nations extends ; but moral and intellec- tual influences are not measured by numbers. The national life of France is as intense as that of any of her sister nations, and her past experiences will enable her to play an important part in the political and social evolution now impending. But even if France were to disappear from the world's stage, there would still remain the influence of the French language and literature. The vigour, grace, precision, and suppleness of that language have made it one of the most perfect vehicles of human thought. It has been propagated far beyond the territorial limits of the nation, and millions speak it, not only in the Latin countries, but in all other parts of the world. CHAPTER II. THE PYRENEES, THE LA^^DES, AND THE BASIN OF THE GARONNE. The Pyrenees.* HE regior of the Pyrenees constitutes a distinct and separate portion of France, whether we look upon its geology or the history of its inhabitants. From the very first they differed from those inhabit- ing the remainder of Gaul, and even now the Catalans of Roussillon and the Basques resemble in language and manners their neigh- bours of the Iberian peninsula. But it is principally because the Pyrenees form the northern edge of the Iberian plateau, which is geologically bounded by the lowland of the Garonne, that they form a region apart. The lowland referred to extends from sea to sea, and up to the tertiary epoch was occupied by a strait connecting the Mediterranean with the Atlantic Ocean. This ancient sea-bed has gradually been upheaved, and is traversed now by the Aude, the Garonne, and their numerous tributary rivers, joined more than two centuries ago by a navigable canal, affording communications between the two seas. This Canal du Midi may be said to form the southern Hmit of continental Europe, for the Pyrenees which rise beyond already belong to a world half African in its nature. The vast depression which separates the Pyrenees from the Cevennes is one of the great natural high-roads of France, which, however, is far less important than the great northern roads, which place Marseilles and Bordeaux in communication with Paris. Still a region which can boast of towns like Bordeaux and Toulouse, which enjoys a mild climate, and possesses a fecund soil, must exercise considerable local influence. The Pyrenees and the Alberes, which bound this southern region of France, extend like a wall from sea to sea. As compared with the Alps, the geological • H.

Its mountain masses are not separated by low passes, as in the Alps, and there is no difficulty in tracing the direction of the main range, which runs almost in a straight line from Cape Creus to the lower mountains of the Basque countries. The geological features are equally simple. Granites, apparently not of erup- tive origin, occupy the centre of the chain, and form many of the summits of the main ranfe. Schists and other ancient rocks connect these crystalline masses, whilst sedimentary strata succeed each other in regular order on both slopes, from triassic sandstones down to the alluvial soil deposited by the rivers. In spite of this general regularity, the chain of the Pyrenees presents s great amount of diversity if studied in detail. About its centre, where the head-waters of the Garonne take their rise, the main range consists of two parallel ridges joined together by a transversal chain. The northern ridge extends to the east, and forms the Mediterranean Pyrenees, whilst the southern stretches west towards the Fig. 11. — Profile of the Pyrenees. Horizontal Scale 1 : 4,000,000. Vertical Scale 1 : 400,000. P^'RENEES — AiUECC- ^OABONML H™PYKEKZtS '■ B.iy^Tnu; Bay of Biscay, and constitutes the Atlantic Pyrenees. Of these two chains the eastern is the least elevated, and the granite there is nearly always exposed ; whilst the more elevated summits of the western Pyrenees consist of schists and lime- stones. This shows that denudation has been going on more actively in the former, and in a large measure accounts for the striking contrasts in the aspect of the two extremities of the chain, and for the great variety of landscape met with when travelling along their northern foot from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic* The Pyrenees rise steeply from the Mediterranean, which, at a distance of only twenty-five miles from Cape Creus, has a depth of over 500 fathoms. Close to that cape rises the group of San Pedro de Roda, resembling a detached outwork con- nected with the frontier range of Alberes by a rugged ridge. The frontier range named gradually increases in height from 660 to 5,000 feet, as we proceed from Cape Cerbere to the mountains of Prats de Mollo and Campredon, and is indebted • Length of Pyrenees from Cape Creus to Cape Sainte-Anne, near Hendaye, 266 miles ; average breadth, exclusive of Spanish foot-hills, 51 miles; area occupied, 13,.563 sq. miles; average height, 3,940 feet (?) ; volume, 1,650 cubic miles.

Many roads lead across it, and have been used from the most ancient times. Near Amelie-les-Bains a wall most erroneously ascribed to Hannibal is pointed out ; at the Col de Pertus (951 feet) Pompey erected a trophy in commemoration of his victories, and Visigoths, Franks, and Moors crossed there after him. Numerous fortifications bear witness to the strategical importance of these passes of the Alberes. Collioure in France, and Fig. 12.^MoNT Canigou. Scale 1 : 240,000. 5 Miles. Rosas in Spain, defend the road along the coast. Perpignan and Figueras defend the outlets of the defiles, and the French fort of Bellegarde secures the important gorge of Pertus. At the j)resent time these passes across the eastern Pyrenees are no longer as important as they were when the Mediterranean was the centre of the civilised world, and must yield to the road in the west which joins Lisbon and Madrid to Paris.* * Altitudes in the Alberes :— Pic des Termes, 3,618 feet ; Col des Balistres, 853 feet ; Col de Banyuis, 1,182 feet; Col de Pertus, 951 feet; Couatouges, 2,724 feet; Col d'Ares, 4,920 feet. 38 FRANCE. Mountains of considerable elevation attach the Alberes to the main range of the Pyrenees, which is hidden behind the bold mass of Mont Canigou (9,141 feet). With its spurs and foot-hills this majestic summit occupies the entire area between the upper valleys of the Tech and the Tet. It is perfectly isolated on three sides, Fig. 13. — PuY DE Caulitte. Scale 1 : 240,000. , 5 Miles. and the summits which attach it to the main chain in the south are inferior to it in height. Its bold pyramid does not yield in grandeur to that of Mount Etna ; it is seen as far as Barcelona and Montpellier, and the astronomer Zach even claims to have seen its dark profile projected against the disc of the setting sun from Marseilles, a distance of 180 miles. Until recently it was held to be the THE PYRENEES. 27 highest summit of the Pyrenees. As a trigonometrical station it offers many advan- tages, and its sloj)es have proved a fertile field of exploration to botanists. The Pyrenees, to which is attached the Canigou, form one of the most barren and inaccessible mountain systems in the world. The passes leading across them are mere notches, cut to a depth of 600 to 900 feet at an elevation of about 8,200 Fig. 14. — The Defiles of the Aide. Scale 1 : 140,000.

Even the Puigraal (9,542 feet) rises but little above the extended rampart formed by the mountains. A deep depression, excavated in the granitic rocks by mountain torrents, separates it from another mountain mass farther north. This is the Col de la Perche (5,-322 feet), guarded on the French side by Montlouis (3,940 feet), and on that of Spain by Puigcerda (Puycerda, 4,074 feet), built on a knoll of 28 FRANCE. glacial origin ; and from it flow the rivers Tet and Segre, the latter a feeder of the Ebro. The sources of both these rivers lie on French soil, and the political boundary has been drawn in the most arbitrary manner. Some of the mountain valleys near the pass fairly deserve their cognomen of \" paradise of botanists,\" for curious plants foimd nowhere else in the Pyrenees may be gathered there. The granitic mountains to the north of the fertile district of La Cerdagne, on the Upper Segre, rise from a huge quadrangular plateau which gives birth to the head streams of the Tet, Segre, Ariege, and Aude, and is separated in the west from Andorra by the much-frequented Pass of Puymaurens (6,293 feet). The highest of these summits is the Puy de Carlitte (9,561 feet). At its foot detached masses of rock are piled up in chaotic confusion, covered in places with moss, but for the most part still bare of vegetation. Lakes and lakelets are scattei'ed over the plateau, and amongst these the Lanoux (black lake ?), 7,068 feet, is the largest, though by no means the most beautiful ; for its dark waters only reflect naked rocks and snows, whilst the lakes on the lower slopes are surrounded by verdant meadows and woods. Another lake, at the head of the Tet, emptied itself in the ninth century, and caused a fearful inundation. The mountaineers formerly looked upon the many lakelets scattered over the Carlitte as so many remains of the Flood, and Noah's ark they supposed to have stranded on the Puy de Prigue. The ground to the north and east of this granitic plateau descends gradually, sometimes forming terraces intersected by bold precipices. Some of these terraces are still covered with woods of beech-trees and firs, but elsewhere the forests have been destroyed, and the aspect of the mountains is forbidding. As in the French Aljjs, we meet with formidable defiles, or das, excavated by mountain torrents to a depth of many hundred feet. The most famous of these is the defile of the Aude, which even impresses persons accustomed to mountains. If we descend from the Baths of Carcanieres into this abyss, we almost fancy we have penetrated into the very bowels of the earth. Various passes lead across the spurs of Mont Carlitte. The Quillanne (5,644 feet), thus named after the town of Quillan, connects the valley of the Tet with that of the Aude. Another pass farther east is dedicated to Jau, or Jupiter (4,964 feet), but is hardly used now. Lower still is the Pass of St. Louis (2,254 feet), which joins the valley of the Aude to that of the Agly, and through which the road leads from Perpignan to Carcassonne. With it the Pyrenees terminate, for with the scarped Puy de Bugarach (4,038 feet), to the north of it, begins the region of the Corbieres, so remarkable on account of its geological formation, its coal beds, and bone caves, but deprived of verdure and running water, and difficult to traverse in summer, when its bleached rocks reflect the rays of the sun. These hiUs long formed the boundary between France and Spain, and the fort of Salses, which defended the road leading along their eastern foot, as well as the ruins of many castles, recalls the struggle for the possession of this country, which only terminated in the seventeenth century. Mount Alaric (1,970 feet), to the north of them, and close to the Aude, bears witness to the still more ancient contests THE PYRENEES. 29 between Eomans and Visigoth*. It is one of the few remaining links of the transversal chain which formerly joined the Pyrenees to the Cevennes. The Pyrenees of Ariege, occupying the country of the ancient Sabartes, are far more regular in their structure than the eastern extremity of the range. From the Pass of Puymaurens (6,336 feet) to the gorge of the Garonne — a distance of 110 miles — the main chain extends without a break. Its summits, amono-st which the Pique d'Estats (10,305 feet) and the Montcalm (10,102 feet) are the most elevated, occupy in nearly every instance the axis of this sierra. Mont Vallier (9,312 feet), which forms so striking an object when seen from Toulouse, is no exception to this rule. Huge blocks of weather-worn granite cover the Fig. 15. — The Isthmus between the CoRBiiKES and the Cevennes.

From a distance these look like grazing sheep turned into stone by some sorcerer, as the legends have it. The lakes which formerly lent a charm to this portion of the Pyrenees have long ago been drained. Only a few swamps are now left, and near these M. Garrigou has discovered the remains of pile dwellings dating back to the age of polished stone implements. But even without their ancient lakes these Pyrenees, with their simple profile, terraces, and verdant slopes, are a noble sight. They are tyjDical of the entire chain, and hence the name bireii or pireti, which in the valley of the Ariege was formerly applied to a sheep-walk in the mountains, transformed into Pyrenees, became general. 30 FEANCE. Two lateral chains run parallel with the Pyrenees of Ariege, the most elevated of which ramifies from Mont Carlitte, and to the north of the valley of the Upper Ariege attains a considerable height. Its culminating point, the Peak of Tabe, or of St. Barthelemy (7,704 feet), stands forth prominently. The mountaineers look upon it with dread, and on its summit may still be seen the traces of ancient excavations made by seekers after enchanted treasure. An inferior chain, farther north, cannot boast of summits covered with snow far into the summer, nor of the mountain pasture, lakelets, and limpid cascades of the Pyrenees. It is monotonous of aspect, of inconsiderable elevation, and in parts almost resembles the walls of a fortress. M. Leymerie, the geologist, has named it the Little Pyrenees. These parallel ranges belong for the most part to the cretaceous formation, and have been pierced by the rivers which descend from the snow-clad crest of the Pyrenees. The Ariege, having passed to the south of the range of St. Barthelemy, Fig. 16. — The Little Pykenees. Scale 1 ; 200,000. 5 Miles. the core of which consists of crystalline rocks, turns abruptly to the north, and enters the plain through the gorge of Tarascon. The Salat has excavated itself a passage through the granite of the gorge of Ribaouto, above St. Girons. The smaller rivers which rise on the northern slopes of the lateral chains likewise take their courses through gorges excavated in the tertiary soil, and one amongst them, the Arize, runs underground through the famous cavern of the Mas d'Azil (938 feet), scarcely a thousand yards in length, and passable on foot, except when the river is in flood. On leaving this tunnel the Arize propels a few water-miUs, and lower down passes through the picturesque gorge of Sabarat. The upper basins of the Ariege and the Salat abound in caverns. The \" galleries \" of Lombrives and Niaux pierce an entire mountain to the south of Tarascon. Equally curious is the cavern of Bedeillac, the traditional burial-place of Roland. These caverns have proved a rich field of exploration to anthropologists and geologists. Bones of animals now extinct, as well as traces of prehistoric ',''l\"''\"n\"l ; I' \"','\"1' ii I III II I ml iiiiiiiiitiiiii ■lit ii Jilv liililillliiilliililliliiB^^^ THE PTEEXEES. 31 man, have been discovered in them. Until recently many of these galleries were used as places of refuge. That of Ornolac, near Ussat, gave shelter to several hundred Albigenses, but the soldiers of the Inquisition built a wall across its entrance, and they all perished, as did the Greeks in the cavern of Melidhoni. To the zoologist these caves of the chalk mountains of the Ariege are more especially interesting, on account of the insects without eyes which have been discovered within them. The Central Pyrenees. — The gorge of Pont-du-Eoi, through which runs the Garonne, separates the Eastern or Mediterranean from the Western or Atlantic Fig. 17. — The MAi.AD£rTA.

The valley of Aran forms the marked feature of this central chain of the Pyrenees. Geographically this valley is part of the basin of the Garonne, but politically it belongs to Spain. To the west it is bounded by the giants of the entire range. From the hills around Bagneres-de-Luchon we are able to admire these mountains, with their forests, pastures, snow-fields, and glaciers. The latter resemble in every respect those of the Alps, but do not descend so far into the valleys. In the \" amphitheatre,\" or Cirque d'Oo (9,850 feet), we even meet with floating icebergs similar to those of Spitzbergen or Greenland. Formerly the glacier of Oo was far more extensive than it is now, and its ancient moraine, 5,900 feet lower 32 FRANCE. than the terminal face of the existing glacier, is 4,400 yards in length, on an average 1,640 yards wide, and 790 feet in height. The most elevated moimtains of the Pyrenees rise within the Spanish frontier. The group of the Maladetta, or \" cursed mountain,\" thus called on account of its desolation, terminates in a serrated crest, the principal \" needle \" of which still bears its ancient Iberian name of Nethou (11,170 feet). This peak was first ascended in 1842, but the region to the south of it was only revealed recently by an Englishman, Mr. Packe, who discovered there the largest lake of the Pyrenees, that of Gregonio, and the delightful meadows of the Malibierne. Mont Fig. 18. — Mont Perdu. Scale 1 : 100,000. 2 Miles. Posets (11,048 feet), on tiie west of the valley of the Esera, rivals its neighbour in height. It was first ascended in 1856. From its summit may be enjoyed what is probably the grandest panorama in the Pyrenees. Mont Perdu, the \" lost mountain,\" the third great mountain mass of the Pyrenees, rises likewise on Spanish soil. It was first ascended by the illustrious Ramond in 1802, and since then its amphitheatres or cirques have become the haunt of tourists. The limestone pyramid of Mont Perdu rises from an irregular plateau, cut up into terraces bounded by precipices, and dotted over by curiously shaped masses of rock. To the west the group is bounded by the famous \" Breach of Roland \" (9,197 feet), said to have been cleft by the paladin's sword (Fig. 19). THE PYRENEES. 33 Glaciers occupy the area enclosed between the rocky precipices. That between Mont Perdu and the crest of Estaube, to the north of it, covers an area of 1 -5 square miles, and within it is enclosed a lake, frozen almost throughout the year. The waters descending from the plateau have excavated immense cavities locally called ouks, or \"porridge pots,\" but more generally known as cirques. The largest of these amphitheatres is that of Troumouse, but the most admirable, the glory of the Pyrenees, is that of Gavarnie (Fig. 20), bounded on the one side by a perpendicular precipice 5,500 feet in height, on the other by rocky Fia:. 19. — The Breach of Roland. terraces. A magnificent waterfall, 1,38-1 feet in height, plunges down from the glaciers when the snow melts, but in winter this and the numerous minor cascades are converted into pillars of ice, which surround the amphitheatre like a colonnade of marble. The granitic peaks in this portion of the range are inferior in height to those formed of limestone. That of Neouvielle (Pic d'Aubert), the most remarkable of the former, only attains 10,144 feet, whilst the limestone masses of Pic Long (10,479 feet), and Campbieil to the south of it, almost equal Mont Perdu in 34 FRANCE. elevation, and are joined in the east to the Pic d'Arbizon (9,286 feet; and other summits looking down upon the valley of the Aure, which rival the Pic du Midi of Bigorre (9,437 feet) in beauty. This latter is separated from the main range by a low saddle, over which runs the road of the Tourmalet, and being thus isolated, the prospect from its summit is one of the most magnificent, extending from the Pic du Midi of Pau (9,463 feet) to the pyramid- shaped Mont Vallier. Fig. 20. — The Amphitheatre of Gavarnie. Neouvielle and the mountains in its vicinity are covered with boulders ; and the moraines of ancient glaciers bound the \" lakelets \" which fill depressions in the valleys. These glaciers have shrunk now to small proportions, but during the glacial epoch they covered a vast extent of country. The most important of them occupied what is now the valley of the Gave of Pau, as far down as Lourdes. Anciently it appears to have extended beyond Tarbes, but even if we credit it only with the dimensions given to it by MM. Martins and THE PYEENEES. 85 Collomb, it had a length of 33 miles, and spread over 500 square miles. It covered the site of the modern village of Gavarnie to a height of 4,430 feet, was 2,590 feet thick in the basin of Argeles, and 1,180 feet above the site of Lourdes. In comparison with this gigantic river of ice, the si'nieilhcs of Mont Perdu and the Mabore, the glaciers descending from the dark flanks of the Vignemale (10,795 feet), the most elevated summit of the French Pyrenees, and the patches of ice to the east of formidable Balaitous (10,421 feet), are of little note, for the whole of the existing glaciers of the Pyrenees hardly cover 20 square miles, and in no instance do they descend beneath 7,200 feet above the sea-level. To the west of the Balaitous the height of the Pyrenees decreases rapidly, and the Pic du Midi of Pau is the last of the great granitic peaks. With the pyramid-shaped Pic d'Anie (8,213 feet) begins the country of the Basques, who formerly believed that mountain to be inhabited by an evil spirit. Beyond Mont Orhy (6,618 feet) we only meet with hills traversed by numerous passes, amongst which the \" Gate \" of Roncevaux (3,600 feet) is the most famous. At the saddle Fig. 21. — Section of the Ancient Glacier of AROELfes. Scale 1 ; 60,000. According to MM. Martins and Collomb. fi, u u \"SO 1 Mae. of Aldudes the political boundary turns abruptly to the north, leaving to France only low spurs and outlying hills. One of these latter is the Rhune (2,950 feet), or \"angular rock,\" affording a magnificent prospect over the Bay of Biscay. Although the difference of latitude between the two extremities of the Pyrenees does not exceed 1°, they differ strikingly in climate and aspect. Near the Atlantic the mountains are almost wholly covered with mould, and, where trees are not met with, the soil is at all events thickly covered with shrubs and furze. Towards the Mediterranean, on the other hand, the rocks are barren. In the Western Pyrenees we might fancy ourselves in Scotland, whilst the aspres of Roussillon and the secanos of Catalonia resemble the arid hills of Greece. The granitic rocks which prevail in the east partly account for these contrasts, but the principal cause must be looked for in the rains. In the Basque country it rains abundantly, near the Mediterranean hardly at all, the boundary between the two districts being formed by Mont Carlitte. The snow-line descends rapidly as we proceed to the westward, and in the Mediterranean Pyrenees we meet 86 FRANCE. neither with glaciers nor with perennial snows. The snow that falls there soon disappears before the rays of the sun, the winds, and a hot south wind resembling the/of/iM of Switzerland, and locally known as autan.

The contrast between the two slopes of the mountains is even more striking than that between their extremities. On the French slope we meet with snow, THE PYEENBES. 37 ice, running streams, luxuriant meadows and forests, with numsrous villages scattered over the plain ; on the opposite slope the eye alights upon naked rocks, poor pasturage, and heaps of stone serving as human habitations. To the mountaineers the French slope is known as bach or hatcli — that is, \"lower\" or \" shady \" side ; the Spanish slope as soulane, or \" sunny side.\" On the latter the sun is more powerful and the rainfalls are less ; but man, by destroying the forests, has made himself an accomplice of a hostile nature. Wild beasts are more numerous there. The chamois (isard) abounds there ; wolves are plentiful, as likewise on the French slope ; and sometimes one hears of the mischief done by a bear. In the district of Capsir, in Roussillon, the lynx, the genet, and the marten are still seen, but several animals, including the stag, which were common in the Middle Ages, have disappeared. A few wild goats still inhabit the valleys of Ordesa and Malibierne, in Spain, but in France the last animal of the kind was killed in 1825. The geographical nomenclature of the French Pyrenees is Basque and Latin, but not Celtic, and we may conclude from this that the whole of the country was formerly inhabited by men of Euskarian race. The ancient language is still spoken, not in the less accessible portions of the Pyrenees, but in the open valleys of the west, where we meet likewise witli gipsies, cayofs, and cascarots living in separate communities. There are three dialects, viz. those of Labourd, of Lower Navarre, and of Soule. The Basque does not appear to have lost ground since the beginning of the Middle Ages ; but what the uncouth dialect of Beam failed to accomplish, French will no doubt succeed in, and no sooner will the Basques have learnt to speak two languages than they will neglect that one which proves least serviceable to them. Up to the present it was ignorance which protected Basque against the inroads of French, for one-half of the men and two-thirds of the women of the country are illiterate. Thousands of Basques migrate to the neighbouring towns of Bayonne, Bordeaux, and Toulouse in search of employment, or seek a home in the New World, where their number is probably greater than that of those who remain behind in the old country. Hostility to the conscription is one of the great motives of emigration, for the"
