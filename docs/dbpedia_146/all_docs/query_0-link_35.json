It is a varied course offering many situations of play. Indeed, between a go in the forest and a return more open, this 18 holes is technical and fun in all seasons.\n\nHistory\n\nBorn in 1952, at the will of the American soldiers based in Orléans after the Second World War, the Orléans-Donnery golf course still bears some traces of it, like its clubhouse, created by the army and still present. .\n\nThe legend of Arnold Palmer ... Young American soldier, the still amateur champion stationed in France would have given his opinion on the plans of the future course intended for the American soldiers. In view of the length of pars 5 of the outward journey, one might think so. More seriously, the layout of the initial nine holes is the work of a colonel of the NATO forces stationed in Orléans. He had been able to convince the owner of the castle, herself a golfer, of the interest of building a course on her land. Another story has it that the fairway of hole # 1, former hole # 6, an endless hole, could have served as an emergency landing strip in case of trouble at the nearby US air base. Inaugurated twenty years ago, the return was built by Olivier Van der Vinck, also author of the Cheverny golf course.\n\nCareer\n\nThe 18-hole Orléans Donnery golf course is set in the heart of a 27 hectare estate. The first 9 holes are scattered in the middle of the forest and will require a precise iron game. The last 9 holes with wider fairways will allow you to attack more and get some birdies without taking too many risks.\n\nIn the heart of the forest of Orleans, the course winds through the woods, which makes it its major difficulty, and requires a necessary game of precision as on holes n ° 5,6 and 7, all three in slight dog- leg with well defended greens. The n ° 14 is a pretty Par5 in S with a green finish surrounded by bunkers and a little water… Finally n ° 18 is the hardest, a long Par4 of more than 410m and a green with multiple slopes .\n\nThe technicality of the course comes from the few bunkers and water features arranged in sometimes formidable obstacles, requiring the player to be patient, thoughtful and perseverance. A real golfing challenge!\n\nTraining areas\n\nPractice: 26 positions including 11 covered\n\nPutting green\n\nPitching greens\n\nUpstream from the Valley of the Kings which stretches over the castles of the Loire, Sully-sur-Loire opened up to golf in the 9s.

At the gates of Sologne, within a club with a family and friendly spirit, the Golf de Sully sur Loire will seduce you\n\nThree 9-hole courses\n\n9 Holes, the Deer, Par 36, 3097 m\n\n9 Holes, Pheasants, Par 36, 2932 m\n\n9 holes, Les Sarcelles, Par 36, 2901 m\n\nWith three radically different 9-hole golf courses between the plain, the ponds, the forest and a few drops that one does not necessarily perceive at first glance, the Sarcelles, the Pheasants and the Deer are s' harmonize easily.\n\nBetween the wide fairways bordered by the high rough of the Sarcelles, the forest and dogleg holes of the Pheasants and the narrow alleys of the Chevreuils, scoring in Sully should be earned!\n\nAt the gates of Sologne, the calm of the course is a pleasure for all golfers. Moreover, it is possible to take a departure without waiting or booking ... A real luxury at an hour and a half from Paris.\n\nClose to Orleans and easily accessible, the Golf de Marcilly opened in 1986 and has a unique structure of 45 holes! This one deploys its greens and fairways in Marcilly-en-Villette, a French commune, in the department of Loiret in the Center-Val de Loire region.\n\nThis vast golf structure is available as an 18-hole championship course selected 5 times by the FFGolf for professional tournaments.

They are well defended by 103 bunkers of fine sand, but also by thick copses of heather, lilac, ferns and broom, which make them charming and difficult and compose, depending on the season, a symphony of colors and smells. .\n\nA great traditional golf course, Fontainebleau is considered by many players to be one of the most beautiful golf courses in Europe.
