        "text": "Jairus Banaji\n\nThe tract published below was written in India early in 1977, during the final months of the Emergency when theoretical work was a more or less enforced necessity, given that most practical activity had ceased. (A study that some of us did many years later showed that the massive strike wave of 1973–74 was flattened under the Emergency.) The essay was written as part of debates that had been ongoing for at least a year or more between comrades in Bombay, Delhi and Bangalore, and written as part of a transition in the life of their connected groupings from a strictly Leninist phase, when those of us in Bombay had called ourselves the “Revolutionary Bolshevik Circle”, to a phase when we began to refer ourselves as “the Platform Group” or “Platform Tendency”. The RBC had engaged in intense theoretical study and discussion, with the vague long-term aim of building a “party”. When this aim was finally given up, we had to look for more viable modes of political work, gravitating, inexorably, to the vast industrial areas of Bombay and Bangalore. Notions like the workers’ enquiry, “alternative” plans, and socially useful production became more meaningful than sectarian ideas of party-building, if only because they offered avenues to working with workers and unions that were more transparent and more immediately practical. One result of this phase of political reorientation was the Union Research Group (URG) which emerged from the end of the seventies and lasted for about ten years, after working with and helping to coordinate a very wide range of unions in the Bombay industrial areas. But this transition in perspectives never involved any attempt to move away from theory, on the contrary there was a very substantial production of theoretical work in areas like Marx’s crisis theory, the best Marxist understandings of fascism, domestic labour and the reproduction of capital, workers, unions and the more radical forms taken by the workers’ movement historically, Western Marxism, etc. As the essay itself shows, we read widely and wherever possible sought out literature in French and German which could be translated into English and discussed more widely. The essay itself attempted to argue that the relationship between theory and practice had to be rethought and mediated through some conception of how workers acquire a sense of themselves as making their own history and as bearers of a (still unfulfilled) historical mission, viz. that of emancipating humanity from the bondage of capitalism.\n\nMay 2020\n\n***\n\n“Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp things by the root. But for man the root is man himself.”\n\n(Marx)\n\n“I think that anyone’s political ideas … must be rooted ultimately in some concept of human nature and human needs. Now my own feeling is that the fundamental human capacity is the capacity and the need for creative self-expression.”\n\n(Chomsky)\n\n“Our differences are on subjects of some importance. The question at issue is whether the soul itself is entirely void, like a tablet where on nothing yet has been written … and everything marked on it comes solely from the senses and from experience, or whether the soul contains originally the principles of various notions and doctrines, which external objects simply recall from time to time, as is my view and that of Plato.”\n\n(Leibniz)\n\n“The truth of the hypothesis on the other hand lies in its perceiving that in the process of development the notion keeps to itself. It is this nature of the notion this manifestation of itself in its process as a development of its own self—which is chiefly in view with those who speak of innate ideas, or who, like Plato, describe all learning merely as recollection.”\n\n(Hegel)\n\n“This Platonistic element in Humboldt’s thought is a pervasive one.”\n\n(Chomsky)\n\n“We must look upon language not as a lifeless product but far more as a generative activity (eine Erzeugung)”\n\n(von Humboldt)\n\n“The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism—that of Feuerbach included—is that the thing, reality, sensuousness, are conceived only in the form of the object, or of contemplation, but not as human sensuous activity, practice (praxis), not subjectively.”\n\n(Marx)\n\n“The active creation of humanity has no other end than humanity itself. For humanity does not proceed outside itself while it is creating, nor does it produce anything new. Rather does it know that everything it creates by unfolding was already within it.”\n\n(Nicholas of Cusa)\n\n“The practical creation of an objective world … is proof that man is a conscious species-being… Man produces even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom from such need… In the same way as estranged labour reduces spontaneous and free activity to a means, it makes man’s species-life a means of his physical existence.”\n\n(Marx)\n\n“Practical philosophy, or, more accurately, the philosophy of praxis … this is the future fate of philosophy in general.”\n\n(von Cieszkowski)\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroducing the second edition of Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy, Engels writes, in 1888, “In an old notebook of Marx’s I have found the eleven theses on Feuerbach… These are notes hurriedly scribbled for further elaboration, absolutely not intended for publication, but invaluable as the first document in which is deposited the brilliant germ of the new world outlook”. By “outlook” Engels meant, of course, what Lenin will later call the “hypothesis” of “materialism in history”. The function of the Theses is thus determined. They lay the basis for the constitution of Marxism as a “scientific sociology”.This line of thought stretches from Lenin, through Adler, into Bukharin. Adler will put it very well. Marx realises the programme of Comte, or what Comte’s Positivism announces as a programme becomes, in Marx, a perfect science.Despite its greater sophistication, Adler’s conception is substantially the same as the one Bukharin will propose later. Historical materialism, Bukharin says, is the general theory of society and of the laws of its evolution. It is sociology.The Theses signal this turn. “Dissatisfied with philosophy, (Marx) throws himself into the hands of positive knowledge”.\n\nThe resistance that this conception will later encounter, in Gramsci, Lukács, Korsch, is too well known to recapitulate here. The conception of Marxism as sociology disintegrates the dialectic. And this line of thought stretches from the young Lukács into Sartre. Colletti will stand somewhere in between. There are “two aspects” in Marx, he says. “That of the scientist and that of the philosopher”.And all this then sounds very much like the efforts of Fichte, Schelling and late 19th century neo-Kantianism to overcome the dualism that permeated, infected and destroyed Kant’s system.\n\nThere is another reflection of this same fundamental ambiguity. How did Marx’s ideas evolve? There is, first, the thesis of continuism. The theory of alienation is then an early prefiguration of the notion of abstract labour. In this development, Marx only abandons the speculative dross of his “early” writings. Or, second, there is a thesis of rupture. Marx in 1844 has still to establish his entry into the domain of Science. The Marx who has forced this entry cares nothing for his youthful mysticism. Obviously, Colletti and Althusser represent these alternative conceptions, with different degrees of emphasis.\n\nBut the “ideas” of Karl Marx evolved in a more subtle and complex way, as, indeed, most “ideas” do. In this essay, I do not propose to enter into any of these disputes directly. Instead I propose to concentrate on a certain phase in Marx’s development which can be dated, quite precisely, to the short period that intervenes between the summer of 1844 and the spring of 1845.\n\nThe concentration of interest on this period specifically arises in the following way. An earlier attempt to determine the thoroughly “rationalist” content of Marx’s method from the Grundrisse on led into a short critique of Colletti. This argued that Colletti simply restated Marx’s critique of Hegel in empiricist terms. The effort, made afterwards, to trace the roots of Colletti’s diluted and implicit empiricism led back to Della Volpe. In Della Volpe, a new dimension of “Western Marxism” became immediately apparent. The critique of Hegel proceeded there in a manner that was astonishingly close to the general positivist critique of “metaphysics”. How was such a “coincidence” possible? Was it a coincidence at all?\n\nAnd how to account for the fact that the only element of continuity in Marxists otherwise as opposed to each other on practically everything else, as Althusser, Timpanaro, and Colletti, was their common obsession with and hostility towards “Hegelianism”? By the sixties, there were no “Hegelian” Marxists left any longer. The Frankfurt School had disintegrated long before that, degenerating from its earlier “philosophical” interests into “critical sociology”. The anti-positivising opposition of this period would go back much more emphatically to Husserl and Phenomenology than to Hegel and Rationalism. So, how could one account for the regroupment of Althusser and Timpanaro, otherwise so opposed, on a common platform? The answer, it seems, lay in the deeper concern with materialism itself.\n\nThis raises the more general question of why a “philosophical” tradition or outlook is at all important to the Marxist movement. Why should it not proclaim pragmatism as its philosophy?\n\nThus initially, or methodologically, the purpose of looking for a “philosophical” legacy that Marx leaves to us is to find some basis in terms of which the esoteric history of the Marxist tradition becomes comprehensible. Precisely this, after all, was the task that Marx undertook vis-à-vis Hegel’s system, and as early as his doctoral dissertation.\n\nOf course, a settling of accounts with the earlier generations of the Marxist movement is a vastly more complicated process, and one that presupposes other, more fundamental points of departure. But the abstract or philosophical moments of this critique are still essential. Take Marx himself. If, in The Holy Family, he traces the philosophical ancestry of the workers’ movement back to Locke’s empiricism, then this reflects, to him, not some arbitrary or whimsical presupposition. In Locke’sEssay, Marx sees a book that “systematized and theoretically substantiated the life-practice of that time”. Philosophy is seen here as a mediation between the “life-practice” of society in one epoch and the growth and development of the socialist movement in another.\n\nThis essay itself suggests no response to any of the questions raised above.\n\n“Metaphysics will be defeated forever”\n\nThe pages in which Marx and Engels establish this philosophical genealogy for the socialist movement are among the most important they ever wrote.\n\nIn Chapter 6 of The Holy Family, they say,\n\n“The French Enlightenment of the 18th century and in particular French materialism was … just as much anopen,clearly expressed struggle againstthe metaphysics of the 17th century, and against all metaphysics, in particular that of Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza and Leibniz… Seventeenth centurymetaphysics, driven from the field by theFrench Enlightenment, notably, by French materialism of the eighteenthcentury, experienced avictorious and substantial [gehaltvolle] restoration in German philosophy, particularly in thespeculative German philosophy of the nineteenthcentury”.\n\nThus a “metaphysics”, and meaning here mainly the tradition of classical rationalism, driven into retreat by French materialism, restores itself in an even “weightier” form in the tradition that Hegel will finally bind together. Or, 17th century classical rationalism restores itself in 19th century German idealism. But,\n\n“After Hegel linked it together in a masterly fashion with all subsequent metaphysics … the attack on theology again corresponded, as in the eighteenth century, to an attack onspeculative metaphysics andmetaphysics in general.” (All italics theirs)\n\nThat is to say, Feuerbach’s critique of Hegel has renovated the anti-metaphysical, or anti-rationalist, drive of the 18th century. And now (1844), given this historic renovation of the tasks of the Enlightenment, “metaphysics”\n\n“will be defeated for ever by materialism, which has now been perfected by the work ofspeculation itself and coincides withhumanism”.\n\nThat is, Feuerbach’s materialism is not just the abstract mechanical materialism of the 18th century, it has absorbed elements from the tradition of “idealism” itself, and thereby “perfected” itself. This materialism, Feuerbach’s, is a humanism, and it will defeat “metaphysics” forever.\n\nThe paragraphs that follow deepen the conception of materialism itself by drawing out its historical ingredients in a more explicit way.\n\n“There are two trends inFrench materialism; one traces its origin toDescartes, the other toLocke. The latter ismainly aFrench development and leads directly tosocialism”.\n\nThe empiricism of Locke, “civilized” and thus modified by the materialism of the Enlightenment, forms the philosophical starting-point of the socialist movement. Or, the socialist movement traces its philosophical outlook back to the fusion of the “worldly” materialism of the French and the “common-sense” empiricism of the English.\n\nBefore we come back to this text, take a look at the central point that this “common-sense” empiricism makes in the person of Locke, at the very start of his “long awaited” Essay. Locke spends almost the whole of book one attacking the theory that human beings are born with “innate ideas”. More specifically, he wants to attack the notion that there are certain rational dispositions or capacities or structures that humans are born with, and that only these dispositions or capacities or structures can account for the disparity between their “knowledge” and their “experience”. Now, Locke himself can really only begin to tackle this thesis by first reducing it to the thesis that “therefore” in the production of “knowledge” experience plays no role at all. But finishing his polemic, Locke writes, “Let us then suppose the mind to be…white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas”, that is, without any rational dispositions or powers.\n\n“How comes it to be furnished?… Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge?”\n\nOr, if there are no rational dispositions of any sort given prior to experience, how is knowledge possible?\n\n“To this I answer in one word, from Experience. In that all our knowledge is founded, and from that it ultimately derives itself… This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call “sensation”.\n\nThus, Marx and Engels are saying that sensationalism, or Lockean empiricism, forms a basic ingredient of the socialist movement. As against which, Locke’s contemporary Leibniz, steeped in the “metaphysical” (that is, rationalist) tradition then dominant but later in retreat, presents the theory of “innate ideas” as most classical rationalists from Descartes on actually understood and argued it;\n\n“The question at issue is whether the soul itself is entirely void, like a tablet whereon nothing has yet been written” or like Locke’s blank paper, or Holbach’s wax, “and everything marked on it comes solely from the senses and from experience, or whether the soul contains originally…principles…which external objects simply recall from time to time, as is my view and that of Plato”.\n\nThat of Plato, for he said, “all learning is merely a recollection” of what we already “know”. That is to say, experience is indeed indispensable in the production of knowledge, but it cannot by itself give rise to any knowledge. As Leibniz will say,\n\n“The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is, particular or individual truths”.[11]\n\nLeibniz alludes here to something I shall come to in a moment. But let me repeat, or summarise in advance, the content of the argument that will follow. If it is indeed “humanism” that is to defeat “metaphysics”, then this must be a doctrine or a theory that makes some assumptions about human nature. Or, humanism will make no sense if it has no conception of what specifically makes human nature human and not simply natural. But, already implicit in the two rival conceptions of the “problem of knowledge”, that of Locke and that of Leibniz, are two entirely opposed conceptions of human nature. And one of these, the doctrine of Leibniz and classical rationalism, ascribes to humans certain rational dispositions, or powers, or faculties, or principles which, they say, can alone account for human intelligence or knowledge. According to this view, human nature is rational nature, nature that is specifically human by virtue of that element of “spontaneity” or “creativity” that we shall call reason. (Thus, throughout this essay, “reason” is understood as the set of all those dispositions and powers that the classical tradition called “innate ideas”.)\n\nNow this precisely is not the view that either Marx or Engels accept, at least not in 1844. Rather, asThe Holy Family suggests in unmistakable terms, the conceptions of “knowledge” and of human nature in general developed there belong very much to the empiricist tradition. Later, I shall argue that theTheses on Feuerbach signal, however implicitly, a shift away from this position; that they propose a theory of knowledge in which the conception of human nature comes closer to the rationalist tradition in the same movement of thought that enables Marx, on the other hand, to supersede the epistemologies of both classical rationalism and classical empiricism. The notion of practice will dialecticise the opposition of “idealism” and “materialism”.\n\nTo return to Leibniz; in his reply to Locke, he already alludes to the latent defect of all empiricist theories of knowledge. “The senses never give anything but instances”, he says. The inexorable logic of Lockean empiricism is Humean scepticism. From that point, it will bifurcate either into “personalist” and religious conceptions of “truth” (e.g. Kierkegaard and later existentialism) or into the conventionalist or pragmatist notions of “truth”. All empiricism, pursued consistently, must arrive at one or other of these three tendencies.\n\nThe Renaissance, despite its own philosophical nuances, shared an “ideal of rational certitude” in common. It shared in common the conception that our knowledge of the world can be, or ought to strive to be, a knowledge founded on certainty. Whether, with Hobbes, one espoused a geometricist notion of the procedures of rational thought, or, with Bacon, imparted to the process of knowledge a generalising or inductivist structure; whether with Leonardo you believed that experience is the “mother of all certitude”, or, with Galileo, one identified “real” being with “mathematical being”—knowledge itself was defined, normatively, by the goal of certitude. Thus, whatever their general philosophical inclinations, Aristotelian or Platonist, or their conceptions of the proper “method” of reasoning, they all “agreed that in any case the methods of modern science are such as to ensure that the conclusions it yields shall have about them nothing merely tentative, hypothetical or problematic”.\n\nBut, with the triumphal march of empiricism initiated by Locke and Newton, this Renaissance ideal was quickly, and often only silently, abandoned.\n\nThe Renaissance itself had foreseen this inevitable tendency of all thorough-going empiricism. In the Aristotelian-empiricist notion of knowledge, Juan Luis Vives argued, “all universal principles are derived by us from particulars. Since these particulars are infinite in number, we cannot enumerate them all; but if one individual is lacking, the universal is not established”. And, from this, Vives concluded that there is therefore simply no solid foundation for a “demonstrative” science of nature.\n\nThe problem foreshadowed by Vives or Leibniz bears the name of the problem of induction. It was a problem that led Bacon to rework the whole method of induction on what he thought were more sophisticated foundations, foundations that rejected immediate sense-observations and turned, instead, to experimentally-mediated observation as the real starting-point of knowledge. For the method of induction by simple enumeration produces\n\n“conclusions that are precarious and exposed to peril from a contradictory instance; and it generally decides on too small number of facts and on those which are at hand”.\n\nIt was a problem that led Hume to develop this underlying defect of empiricism into radical scepticism. For, “even after the observation of the frequent or constant conjunction of objects, we have no reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyond those of which we have had experience”. It was a problem which, in the form in which Hume left it, inspired Kant to write the Critique of Pure Reason, in order to secure solid epistemological foundations for our knowledge of the world. Hume “gave himself up entirely to Scepticism – a natural consequence, after having discovered, as he thought, that the faculty of cognition was not trustworthy”.\n\nIn his preface to the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics Kant wrote,\n\n“In order to do justice to the problem, however, the opponents of this celebrated man (Hume) would have had to penetrate very deeply into the nature of reason so far as it is occupied solely with pure thought, something that did not suit them”.\n\n“I openly confess my recollection of David Hume was the very thing which many years ago first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations… a new direction”.\n\nThis “direction” would lead Kant to show, in his First Critique, that the very constitution of “experience” requires the intervention of “pure”, or a priori, principles of sensibility and the understanding. Finally, the same problem led to the disintegration and collapse of cognitive justificationism, of the view that knowledge is cognitively proven knowledge, and to the birth, early this century, of Poincaré’s conventionalism, Reichenbach’s probabilism, and Popper’s fallibilism, in short to the various modern bourgeois philosophies of science.\n\nSensationalism as an ingredient of Feuerbach’s ontological empiricism\n\nBy contrast, there is probably not a single passage in the whole corpus of his writing where Marx ever directly criticises the ideal of rational certitude, much less accepts a scepticist notion of our knowledge of the world. But, if Marx did endorse, to whatever degree, Locke’s conception of knowledge without ever consistently following through its epistemological implications, then this is so because he accepted empiricism, initially, not for its theory of knowledge at all, but at an entirely different level.\n\nIn the short history of philosophy that he and Engels present in The Holy Family, a heavy sense of contemporaneity dominates. In the attack launched by 18th century materialism on 17th century “metaphysics”, they see only a prefiguration of the attack that Feuerbach himself initiates in 1841 withDas Wesen des Christentums. It is Feuerbach’s image that stands in the background of their historical stage.\n\n“Philosophy was counterposed to metaphysics, just as Feuerbach in his first resolute attack on Hegel, counterposedsober philosophy todrunken speculation”.\n\nAgain,\n\n“But just as Feuerbach is the representative ofmaterialism that coincides withhumanism in thetheoretical domain”, and again, “But who revealed the mystery of the “system”? Feuerbach. Who annihilated the dialectic of concepts…?Feuerbach. Who substituted for the for the old lumber and for “infinite self-consciousness”…“Man”?Feuerbach, and onlyFeuerbach.”\n\nThat this fairly deep admiration for Feuerbach was not due simply to Engels or his collaboration with Marx is obvious if we glance, for a moment, at the Manuscripts that Marx had just finished writing before he worked with Engels onThe Holy Family. There he says,\n\n“Feuerbach’s writings are the only works since Hegel… to contain a genuine theoretical revolution”.\n\nSo, when, prophetically enough, as we shall see, they announced the final “defeat” of “metaphysics in general” at the hands of materialism, they announced the renovation, in Feuerbach, of the combined assault delivered much earlier by materialism on one side, empiricism on the other. They announced Feuerbach’s own programme:\n\n“Philosophy has to begin not with itself, but with its antithesis, with non-philosophy. This is our internal essence, which is ‘unphilosophical’, absolutely anti-scholastic and distinct from thought. This is the principle of Sensualism”.\n\nTo the abstract, semi-theological rationalism that Feuerbach sees in Hegel, he counterposes, in this principle of Sensualism, a sort of Lebensphilosophie that he callsUnphilosophie. This “unphilosophical” philosophy proceeds “from the truth and essentiality of the senses”. Reality, truth, require no mediation, says Feuerbach:\n\n“Only that is true…which needs no proof, immediately speaks for itself and carries conviction”.\n\nBut,\n\n“Hegelian philosophy lacks immediate unity, immediate certainty, immediate truth”.\n\nBeyond this sphere of immediacy, of the truth or the reality that is given to us in our experience of the world, in Sinnlichkeit,\n\n“Man has no idea, no conception, of any other reality”.\n\nMarx and Engels announced the victory of this “materialism” prophetically enough. For what Feuerbach said was then said again in different ways, by Kierkegaard on one side, defending Subjectivity, Faith, Passion, Lived Experience, and by Mach on the other. What Marx and Engels witnessed early in the 1840s was only the first of a whole series of attacks on “abstract” rationalism that will gain in polemical intensity only later, towards the closing years of Marx’s own life.\n\nFeuerbach’s critique of Hegel, to start with, was roughly contemporary with the efforts of Whewell and Mill to reargue the method of “eliminative induction”, or with Rankine’s own methodological anticipation of the later Positivist “philosophies” of science, and it preceded by barely twenty years the philosophical manifesto of positivism in Comte, or the fusion of positivism with natural science in Mach. If we then survey the whole 19th century from Herschel down to Poincaré we must definitely conclude that if the 17th century was a century of “metaphysics” and the 18th a century of “materialism”, thenthis 19th century was a century of empiricism.\n\nAnd no longer the simple, uninvolved, dogmatic empiricism of the classical period, but a more complex, splintered, ramified empiricism, branching out from the narrow concerns of “epistemology” into fields left uncultivated by its classical predecessors.\n\nFeuerbach himself is a case in point. Against “metaphysics in general” he opposes nothing so narrow or so circumscribed as a mere theory of knowledge (Locke, Hume), or a mere “methodology” (Whewell, Mill, Jevons) or a mere “philosophy of science” (Mach, Duhem). His opposition is more in the grand style of his own country, more “metaphysical”, so to speak. In sum, Feuerbach’s sensualism is not just empiricism pure and simple, it is an ontological empiricism, and it is this that accounts for the prima facie appearance that the concerns of Marx in 1843 and 1844 have little to do with empiricism as such, or that Marx’s thought had already moved into a sphere of its own.\n\nIt hardly needs to be established at length that Marx, like Hess and so many of the young Hegelians, was powerfully affected by Feuerbach’s sensualism. Marx’s early critique of Hegel was substantially only an elaboration ofmotifs that were central to Feuerbach’s own critique. This holds particularly for those themes or ideas in this critique that are today publicised (by Colletti and others) as specifically “Marxian”. Take the notion, brought back into focus by Della Volpe, that Hegel’s idealism depends crucially on a subject-predicate inversion and on the associated hypostatisation of the predicate. Already in theLectures on the Essence of Religion this motif is argued as follows,\n\n“Man separates in thought the predicate from the substantive [i.e. from the subject in its traditional Aristotelian conception – JB], the property from the essence… And the metaphysical God is nothing but the compendium, the totality of the most general properties extracted from nature which, however, man … reconverts into an independent subject or being”.\n\nAgain,\n\n“In religious ideas we have examples of how in general man converts this subjective into the objective, that is to say, he makes that which exists only in his thought, conception, imagination into something existing outside thought, conception, imagination”.\n\nApart from this specific criticism, there is the general “humanism” that underlies it.\n\n“The new philosophy makes human beings … into the sole, the universal, and the highest object of philosophy. It therefore makes anthropology, including physiology, into the universal science,”\n\n– a theme that runs through the whole of Marx’s Manuscripts.\n\nNow I want to argue that it was precisely the ontological depth of Feuerbach’s empiricism that attracted Marx and Engels. In contrast to classical empiricism, Feuerbach was no longer mainly interested in a problem of knowledge; and in contrast to the earlier “natural-scientific” materialism, his ontology was one centred in a fundamental way on the relation of man to nature. It is true that the revived physiological materialism of Büchner and others drew a part of its inspiration from Feuerbach himself,but Feuerbach would not accept this connection.\n\nEngels later describes the nature of the attraction that Feuerbach exerted on himself and Marx:\n\n“Then came Feuerbach’s Essence of Christianity. With one blow it pulverized the contradiction [of Hegelianism – JB]… Nature exists independently of all philosophy. It is the foundation upon which we human beings, ourselves products of nature, have grown up. Nothing exists outside nature and man,” adding, “Enthusiasm was general;we all became at once Feuerbachians. How enthusiastically Marx greeted the new conception and how much … he was influenced by it, one may read inThe Holy Family”.\n\nBut one could not simply absorb an ontology of the sort that Engels here describes, not even of the crudest sort represented by Büchner, Vogt and so on, without making some assumptions in the process about the “problem of knowledge”. So, it is worth looking a bit more closely at Feuerbach’s legacy.\n\nPrecisely because of its flaccid, ontological character, Feuerbach’s empiricism was far less precise, far more ambiguous or fluid, than the empiricism of Locke and the classical tradition. To start with, this fluidity was apparent in the very terms that were used to characterise the new “system” of philosophy. Feuerbach’s sensualism could just as well have been called his realism, or his realism his empiricism, or his empiricism his materialism, or his materialism his naturalism, or his naturalism his humanism. Whereas Marx accepted the Feuerbachian ontology mainly as a “consistent humanism or naturalism”, the later Marxist tradition, and this includes Engels, would see in Feuerbach mainly, or above all, a materialist.\n\nBut, secondly, this fluidity only underlined another, deeper characteristic of Feuerbach’s system. His renovation of the 18th century attack pushed into the background precisely those themes that had distinguished or even defined classical empiricism. It reversed the traditional order of priorities of the classical empiricists. The latter, mainly concerned with the problem of knowledge, would leave the task of elaborating an ontology consistent with their empiricist epistemological positions to the much later tradition, in our own century, of logical atomism. By contrast, Feuerbach showed practically no concern with that problem. But definite epistemological assumptions were incorporated in Feuerbach’s sensualism. For,\n\n“only thought which determines and rectifies itself by means of sense-perception is real, objective thought”.\n\nHis critique of Kant likewise proceeds from the idea that the “objectivity” of thought, or “truth”, derives from our perceptions of the world:\n\n“(for Kant) the objects of the senses are for the mind only phenomena, and not truth…What a contradiction, to sever truth from reality and reality from truth”.\n\nExpounding Feuerbach, and agreeing with him in this regard, Engels writes,\n\n“the material, sensuously perceptible world to which we ourselves belong is the only reality”.\n\nAnd Lenin,\n\n“Feuerbach advocates objective sensationalism, i.e., materialism”.\n\nSo, a philosophically implicit and unaggressive epistemological empiricism was one of the ingredients in Feuerbach’s many-sided legacy. And this is what accounts for the traces of an empiricist conception of knowledge in Marx, around 1844. It accounts for the fact that they are only traces, only implicit, sporadic, never consistently developed or reintegrated into the rest of his thought, and for the fact that they are traces of empiricism. So, in theManuscripts he writes,\n\n“Sense perception (see Feuerbach) must be the basis of all science. Only when science starts out from sense-perception … is itreal science”.\n\nAnd the Holy Family, following a month later, is more explicit. Here, Marx takes it for granted that\n\n“Man draws all his knowledge, sensation etc., from the world of the senses and the experience gained in it”.\n\nHere, he praises Bacon as the “real progenitor of all modern experimental science”, for whom,\n\n“Physics based upon sense-perception is the chiefest part of natural philosophy … According to him (sc. Bacon)”\n\nBut this is simply incorrect,\n\n“the senses are infallible and thesource of all knowledge. All science is based onexperience, and consists in subjecting the data furnished by the senses to arational method of investigation”.\n\nThis “rational method” is simply the method of induction itself.\n\n“Induction, analysis, comparison, observation, experiment are the principal forms of such a rational method”.\n\nHere he criticises Hobbes for “systematising” Bacon’s materialism (which, of course, he never did),\n\n“without however furnishing a proof of Bacon’s fundamental principle, the origin of all human knowledge and ideas from the world of sensation”.\n\nRather,\n\n“It was Locke who, in hisEssay on the Human Understanding, supplied this proof”.\n\nAs if all this is not enough, Marx and Engels then go on to endorse a conception of human nature for which\n\n“not only the soul, but the Senses too, not only the art of creating ideas, but also the art of sensuous perception, are matters of experience andhabit”.\n\nAnd from this it follows, quite consistently, that\n\n“the whole development of Man therefore depends on education andexternal circumstances”.\n\nOne consequence of accepting such a view is the fact that when, in the Manuscripts, Marx attempts to define human nature, he will fail.\n\nBefore we come to that, however, we should take up the cycle inaugurated by Feuerbach, but at a phase closer to the closing years of Marx’s life-time. The explicit recovery of the merely underlying or implicit moment of ”epistemologism” in the renovated empiricism of the 19th century comes only with Mach.\n\nMach’s critique of “metaphysics”, the late 19th century inauguration of the positivist reaction that extends all the way down to the Vienna Circle, coincides in a remarkable way with Feuerbach’s. Both Feuerbach and Mach share the same conception of “metaphysics” as an illusion of knowledge, a deception of the human spirit, a thinly disguised form of theology.\n\nMore specifically, the notion of “hypostatisation”, central to the Feuerbachian critique of Hegel (both in Feuerbach and in Marx) recurs with the same critical function, and the same decisive importance, in Mach, and, elsewhere, in the tradition of American pragmatism, e.g., Dewey. It was this side of Mach that exerted the deepest or most lasting influence on the Vienna Circle. A logical positivist (Philipp Frank) who lived through the formative period of the Circle, during which it was in the process of absorbing ideas from Mach, Poincaré and others, writes,\n\n“In my essay on the death of Ernst Mach, I characterized the enduring nucleus of Mach’s teachings as his struggle against the ‘idolization of auxiliary concepts’”.\n\nThat is, Mach’s struggle against the “hypostatisation” of concepts that in our judgements have a purely predicative function (e.g., Feuerbach, Della Volpe) or a merely heuristic value (Mach himself). For Mach the limits of a valid cognitive discourse were circumscribed around the hard core of its “descriptive” terms, that is, those terms either directly describing, or reducible to descriptions of, our sensations. The residue of “metaphysical” terms such as “force” was strictly speaking eliminable or, if retained, then retained by some criterion of conventionalism. Later in his life Cassirer appears to have come around to this view. By the thirties, neo-Kantism had degenerated into a form of crude positivism.\n\n“Cassirer repeatedly points out that science creates auxiliary concepts, such as force or atom, in order to be able to formulate conveniently the theories it has set up at a certain time, but that at later times these auxiliary concepts freeze into essences, ‘ontological concepts’”.\n\nHere, in the notion of concepts “freezing” into essences or becoming “ontological”,\n\n“there is hardly left any contradiction to Ernst Mach’s purely positivistic conception of science”.\n\nOf course, the only logically consistent programme that was ever advocated for the elimination of such terms (hypostatised concepts, ontological concepts, metaphysical terms, abstractions, etc.) was the one proposed by logical positivism, e.g., Neurath, Carnap, or later Craig. “Consistent” because at least in this less metaphysical tradition of empiricism an effort was made to install specific criteria of analyticity and of cognitive significance. For example, the programme of “elimination” was supported by the verificationist theory of meaning, though this itself, if pursued rigorously, would, as Wittgenstein realised, impart to all the most significant prepositions of any science a purely “hypothetical” value, for example, it would simply pulverise the notion of a “scientific” history, for what possible “primary experience” could one adduce to “verify” propositions in history, or, what possible “genuine propositions” could a science of history contain?\n\nBut Mach’s critique of “metaphysics” simply reiterated a conception that is there already at the heart of Feuerbach’s attack on “drunken speculation”. Certitude lies in “immediacy”, whether this is the immediacy of our “sensuous, physical existence” or the immediacy of our “sensations” as such. And characteristically, there is already in Feuerbach an element of conventionalism, for “love of convenience”, he says, is one of the reasons why “abstractions” that have no “objective validity and existence”are none the less proposed or entertained.\n\nIn their own way, and Feuerbach less consciously than Mach, both rediscovered a deeply and consciously anti-rationalist theme ingrained into the very structure of empiricist thought. Berkeley, for example, had no quarrel with the notion that our knowledge involves “general ideas”. To him such ideas were in themselves particular, and thus reducible. For example, the concept of a “triangle in general” would involve no more than the use of some particular triangle (i.e., the figurate conception of it) to “denote indifferently” a whole group of triangles. Berkeley’s attack was directed, rather, against “abstract general ideas”’ such as “force”, “attraction”, “corpuscules”, “action”, ”reaction”, “space”, “time”, “extension”. Ideas that were not only “general”, but involved, to one degree or another, abstraction from all concrete contents. Or take Newton. His whole polemic against “hypotheses”, the one that forms the successive versions of Rule IV of the Regulae philosophandi is rooted in an identical prejudice. “What is not deduced from phenomena [induced from them – JB] is to be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses have no place in experimental philosophy [science – JB]”. Of course, this is not how Newtonian science would itself proceed, and the function of Newton’sRules is thus a different one, a doctrinal attempt to bolster the method of induction. (cf. Feyerabend in n. 44.)\n\nBut Berkeley, Newton, Mach, the logical positivists are explicit and straightforward. This explicitness is closely related to the fact that they all consciously draw out their own epistemological positions. Not so the sensationalist epistemology of Feuerbach, or of Marx in 1844. This is neither very explicit nor consistent.\n\nThe later Marxist empiricism\n\nBut thirdly, again as a consequence of the Feuerbachian legacy, this same epistemological ambiguity, or shamefaced empiricism, permeates so much of the Marxist tradition of the following decades. It is this that accounts for the rather bizarre character of Lenin’s effort in Materialism and Empirio-Criticism.\n\nThis text, as we know, was directed polemically against Bogdanov and the Russian followers of Mach. Now Mach’s historical influence, e.g., his role in shaping the development of modern empiricism, was strictly tied in with the polemical thrust of his sensationalism, and not with the specific epistemological nuances that he gave to it. Mach survived into our own century as an inaugurator of the positivist reaction and not as a “Berkeleian idealist” or a phenomenalist. Mach’s later popularity was founded on his positivising conception of science, on the polemic that he built against “metaphysics”, on the solutions that he proposed to the confusions of contemporary mechanics, and not on the phenomenalist foundations of his empiricism.\n\nBut Materialism and Empiriocriticism was more interested in Mach’s phenomenalism. Lenin fought Mach for his “subjectivism”, or his “idealism” or his notion that our sensations are not “signs of things, but on the contrary, a thing is a thought-symbol for a compound-sensation of relative fixedness” (Mach).\n\nThis contradiction was, in many ways, an experimentum crucis of the philosophical strength built into Marxism. In Machism, Lenin, that is Marxism, confronted the one tendency that more than any other throughout that period, more even than Comte’s positivism, would exert a decisive influence on the trajectory of Europe’s philosophical thought over the next thirty years. A critique of Machism could only really proceed if it challenged Mach’s empiricism. But Lenin fought sensationalism with sensationalism. He fought “subjective” sensationalism with “objective” sensationalism. (These are his words.)\n\nIf, to Mach, objects were simply complexes of our sensations, or, more precisely, of our “sensory elements”, to Lenin these objects exist outside us in a reality that is given independently of our perceptions and we form a conception of them, or of reality, through the “mental pictures” or “images” that “arise exclusively from sensations”. Or, our ideas are “impressions”, in Locke’s terms, created in our minds by the impingement of the external world. Lenin says,\n\n“Our sensation, our consciousness is only an image of the external world, and it is obvious that an image cannot exist without the thing imaged”.\n\nNothing of the sort was “obvious”, for classical empiricism, proceeding from the same premises, drove itself, in different ways in Berkeley and in Hume, to radically different conclusions. At any rate, sense-perception is, or forms, or equips us with, a picture, or an “image” [Abbild] of the reality that exists outside us.\n\nNow this conception of our ideas of the world having the form of “pictures” was fairly common later in the 19th century. It recurs, for example, in the philosophical views of both Hertz and Boltzmann, Mach’s contemporaries. Mach’s sensationalism had led him to the view that “explanation is nothing but condensed description”, that the concepts and laws of science have a purely “summative” or “mnemonic” character and function. In terms that Bachelard will use later, Machism refuses to accept the notion of any sort of break between “sensory knowledge” and “scientific knowledge”. “If all the individual facts – all the individual phenomena knowledge of which we desire – were immediately accessible to us”, Mach writes, “a science would never have arisen”. Against which, Boltzmann argued as follows in one of his longer popular writings:\n\n“General phenomenology seeks to describe every group of facts by enumeration and by an account of the natural history of all phenomena that belong to that area, without restriction as to means employed except that it renounces any uniform conception of nature, any mechanical explanation or other rational foundation. This latter view is characterized by Mach’s dictum that electricity is nothing but the sum of all experience that we have had in this field and still hope to have. [This view sets itself] the task of representing phenomena without going beyond experience … but I think this is an illusion.\n\nNo equation represents any processes with absolute accuracy, but always idealizes them, emphasizing common features and neglecting what is different and thus going beyond experience. That this is necessary if we are to have any ideas at all that allow us to predict something in the future, follows from the nature of the intellectual process itself, consisting as it does in adding something to experience and creating a mental picture that is not experience and therefore can represent many experiences. Only half of our experience is ever experience, as Goethe says. The more boldly one goes beyond experience, the more general the overview one can win.”\n\nWhereas Mach traced the welter of confusions that mechanics had got into by the 1870s to the tendency to transcend the limits of “experience”, Boltzmann, in the introductory portions of the first volume of his Lectures on the Principles of Mechanics, published about ten years before Lenin’s polemic, wrote,\n\n“It is precisely the unclarities in the principles of mechanics that seem to me to derive from not starting at once with hypothetical mental pictures but trying to link up with experience from the outset”,a criticism that is strikingly similar in content to that which Marx directs against Ricardo and his “inability to forget profits” when dealing with value.\n\nSo, if Lenin referred to our “ideas” about the world as “pictures” or “mental images”, he did so in a quite different sense to Boltzmann’s. Lenin’s “pictures” were much closer, in their epistemological meaning, to Locke’s “impressions” than to Boltzmann’s “pictures” or to Hertz’s “images” [Scheinbilder]. And Boltzmann is a good example to take, because Lenin himself cites him, approvingly, against the Machists.\n\nNow, Lenin argues not only that our sensations are “images” of the external world, but that they “give us faithful images”. And he adds, “This is Materialism”. Or,\n\n“Our sensations give us an objectively true image of the external world”.\n\nLenin upholds the empiricist thesis in its strong form, in a form that goes beyond Bacon’s empiricism, for Bacon does not maintain, as Marx supposed him to, that “the senses are infallible”, but says, on the contrary, that\n\n“by far the greatest impediment and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetence, and errors of the senses”.\n\nIf it is not already obvious by now that, by “materialism”, Lenin understood a straightforward empiricism, then we must turn to other passages where the point is repeated even more clearly.\n\n“The first premise of the theory of knowledge undoubtedly is that the sole source of our knowledge is sensation”.\n\n“All knowledge comes from experience, from sensation, from perception”.\n\nIn these pages, Lenin will make one of his rare early references to Hegel, endorsing the latter’s conception of empiricism as the doctrine that “finds the truth in the external world”. Elsewhere, Lenin notes that the “doctrine that deduces all our ideas from the experience of the senses, reducing knowledge to sensations” is called sensationalism, and adds the further remark, from a “dictionary of philosophy”, that,\n\n“Objective sensationalism is nothing but materialism”.\n\nIn a less bland, or more involved, form the same espousal of empiricism runs through the later tradition of Marxist theory, closer to our time. The most important case of this is the Della Volpean school. It would be quite pointless to concentrate attention, in this respect, on Colletti, for the whole of Colletti’s critique of Hegel was forged by Della Volpe, much earlier, much more profoundly, with more sophistication, and with deeper insight. But before coming to Della Volpe, recall a central motif of Marxism and Hegel, the one that Colletti summarises in the view that,\n\n“Reality, in fact, is that which is objective, and the objective, contrary to idealism, is precisely that which is external to and independent of thinking subjectivity”.\n\nThe nucleus of this conception is discernible, almost word for word, in the positivising reactions unleashed by Mach himself. Abel Rey, a “neo-Positivist” who accepted Mach’s theory of knowledge, is quoted at length by Lenin in support of “materialism”. Lenin writes,\n\n“Let us take the basic concept, the concept of experience. Rey assures us that Mach’s subjectivist interpretation … is a sheer misunderstanding…\n\nBut how does Rey, who accuses only the fideists of distortion, but not Mach himself, correct this distortion? Listen. ‘Experience is by definition a knowledge of the object…Experience is that over which our mind has no command, that which our desires, our volitions, cannot control, that which is given and which is not of our own making. Experience is the object that faces the subject’”.\n\nAnd what is this view, Lenin then asks, if not materialism itself?\n\n“What penetrating genius Engels revealed when he dubbed the latest type of adherents of philosophical agnosticism and phenomenalism ‘shamefaced materialists’”.\n\nThat is to say, Machism is “shamefaced” materialism. For Mach is a sensationalist, that is, a materialist, but he distorts or covers up this materialism with phenomenalism.\n\n“The positivist and ardent phenomenalist Rey is a superb specimen of this type. If experience is ‘knowledge of the object’, if ‘experience is the object that faces the subject’, if experience means that ‘something external exists and necessarily exists’, this obviously amounts to Materialism!… We are told (by Rey) ‘The objective is that which is given from without, imposed by experience; it is that which is not of our making, but which is made independently of us…’”.\n\nTo repeat, Colletti says,\n\n“the objective is that which is external to and independent of thinking subjectivity”, Rey says, “the objective is that which is given externally, which is made independently of us”.\n\nThe conception of “objectivity” that unites the Marxist Colletti with the positivist Rey is the one that Hegel would call, in the minor Logic, the “common sense” notion of objectivity:\n\n“In the language of common life we mean by objective what exists outside of us and reaches us from without by means of sensation”.\n\nFrom Feuerbach’s sensualism, through the materialism of Lenin and the positivism of Rey and Colletti down to the naïve realism of common-sense,\n\n“Reality … is conceived only in the form of the Object” (Thesis 1), that is, as “the object that faces the subject” or as “that which is external to and independent of subjectivity”.\n\nDella Volpe is no longer concerned merely with these ontological conceptions of experience or objectivity. He recovers the classical interest in the problem of knowledge, and attempts to build an epistemology consistent with materialism. This entails a sort of synthesis of the decisive “critical” moments of earlier philosophical traditions. Specifically (i) of the various polemical refutations of the purely “negative” and even “romantic” conception of sensation characteristic of Platonism in general and of Hegel in particular, ranging from Aristotle’s critique of Plato, through Galileo’s critique of neo-Aristotelian apriorism and Kant’s refutation of Leibniz, down to Marx’s critique of Hegel;(ii) of the “negative” or falsificatory inductivism of Bacon, purged of its hypotheticism, the defect, for Della Volpe, of all positivist conceptions of science; and (iii) of a diluted and modified Platonism from which Della Volpe derives his “theory of reason”.\n\nI do not want to summarise this long and involved argument any more than is strictly necessary for the purpose of this essay, so I shall confine myself to the empiricist legacy in Della Volpe’s reconstructed materialism. To Della Volpe, or in the conception of “scientific method” that he outlines, through the symbol of Galileo – but, remember, this is Della Volpe’s Galileo, and there are many other Galileos – the “instance” or principle or moment of Reason, represented by our “hypotheses” or “deductions” [ragione,ossia idea-ipotesi], can never establish its “truth” or its “validity”, that is, the “hypothesis” can never establish itself as “causal law”, simply by reference to itself, or tautologically, or without reference to the opposing instance or principle of “matter” as against reason, or of “facts” as against “hypotheses”, or of induction as against deduction. The validation of a hypothesis as law, i.e. the proof of its truth, if it bypasses or ignores this recourse to experience, fails to avoid or to overcome the logical fallacy of consequents, or the fallacy of believing that because, if the hypothesis is true, certain facts should follow, the hypothesis is indeed true because those facts are found. Thus, a hypothesis, representative of “reason”, acquires the proof of its truth, or becomes a “law”, by recourse to “experimental” observations of nature. But experiments, representative of the claims of experience, or of the “discreteness” that characterises reality as against thought (cf. Feuerbach) are useless in this regard unless they conform to the “inductivist and empiricist principle of Bacon comprised in the notion of an ‘excluding instance’ or a ‘negative instance’”. Thus, for Della Volpe, experimental proofs proceed by disproofs. An experiment can only validate one hypothesised fact by “eliminating and refuting” other competing facts. Or, to relate this conception more closely to the bourgeois philosophies of science, Della Volpe retains a justificationist view of knowledge, but disposes of its abstract immediacy as a merely simple, direct, or unmediated intercourse with nature. He validates or endorses a type of justification that proceeds only “negatively”, as falsification, a type of proof that is solid only as disproof. For, “where a hundred instances will not prove a universal connection, one will disprove it. This is the cornerstone of Bacon’s method: maior est vis instantiae negativae”. “Facts cannot prove an hypothesis by their agreement with it [for this commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent – JB] except insofar as at the same time they disprove its rivals by their disagreements”. It follows also that, to Della Volpe, all necessity is “factual necessity”, or necessity characterised by the contingency of the empirical order. As contingent necessity, a “law” is something intrinsically “corrigible” or “perfectible” with none of the fixity that characterises “metaphysical” thought.\n\nDella Volpe’s conception of science is thus strikingly close to Popper’s. Both are fundamentally concerned with what Popper himself calls the “demarcation problem”, the problem of establishing criteria in terms of which science, or its discourse, can distinguish itself from “metaphysics” and other discourses. Both see the hallmark of scientific method and of scientific “rationality” in the subordination of our “rational” constructions to the test of “experience”. Both accept that “experience” can play this role only “negatively”, or as falsification. Both regard the “theories” and “laws” of science as merely tentative, or conjectural, so that between this conception and those of the Vienna Circle or Popper’s hypothetico-deductive empiricism only a nuance intervenes.\n\nAnd, in both conceptions, there lurks the silent threat of positivism. Popper will rebut this charge by recasting positivism as a theory of meaning, as verificationism. Della Volpe will distance his conception from positivism by supposing that all positivism is characterised by its “idolatry of facts and its repugnance toward hypotheses”. But all this might have carried conviction in the heyday of logical positivism with its anti-metaphysical “excesses”. Today, when this crusade has lost its original force and this classical, or rigorous, or pure, positivism has fragmented into the diluted, neoclassical, liberalised positivism of Hempel and others, both Popper and Della Volpe submerge in the general movement of modern empiricism, Popper as its liberal conscience, and its right-wing, Della Volpe as its metaphysical soul and its left.\n\nThe historical conjuncture that accounts for this strange, almost paradoxical convergence is something I shall not go into here. It is enough to note, for the moment, that both Popper and Della Volpe started their own speculations with Hume. With the breaks in justificationism that came towards the close of the 19th century, the problem of induction would again surface in an effort to reconstitute the legitimacy of empiricism.\n\nThus, Della Volpe could only secure the consistency of his epistemological construction, of the “functional reciprocity of reason and experience”, with the conception of “scientific method” proposed by him, and identified, symbolically, with Galileo, that is, with the “reciprocity of hypothesis and fact”, by subsuming, or accepting, or legitimising, a justificatory fallibilism, and thus presupposing the distinction between “fact” and “theory” that is common to all varieties of empiricism.\n\nThat such a distinction belonged centrally to the empiricist view of knowledge was already evident in the Marxist tradition itself when Lukács, for example wrote in an early essay, “The blinkered empiricist will, of course, deny that facts can only become facts within the framework of a system – he forgets that however simple an enumeration of ‘facts’ may be, it already implies an ‘interpretation’…”.With this, Lukács anticipated a point that would become cardinal to the renewed disintegration of the contemporary empiricist philosophies of science.\n\nDella Volpe, however, required precisely this distinction of observational/non-observational statements because the notion of some sort of “empirical base” was crucial to the structure of his epistemological argument. Without this, which moment, within the field of cognitive discourse, could correspond to the ontological instance of Matter, or to the epistemological principle of “sensation”? Della Volpe could preserve the ontology-epistemology as a self-contained system, but without Bacon’s principle and its underlying notion of an “empirical base”, science and ontology would remain incoherently connected, and the very notion of a “scientific ontology”, that is, of materialism, would then collapse.\n\nTake a final and less important case of empiricism in Marxist writing. This is Schmidt’s The Concept of Nature in Marx.In fact, Schmidt, when looking at Marx in 1844, will exaggerate his empiricism because of his failure to distinguish the sensationalist theory of knowledge from Feuerbach’s more wide-ranging, ontologising empiricism.\n\nHe says,\n\n“In taking this view [of nature as the sole object of knowledge – JB] Marx showed himself to be rooted in the sensualism of Feuerbach and in fact he proceeded from sense perception as the ‘basis of all science’”.\n\nBut Marx did nothing of the sort. He said that oneshould do so, and he referred to Feuerbach for authority. Schmidt is aware, naturally, of the central role that theTheses will occupy in the evolution of Marx’s thought. He is aware that the firstThesis makes what appears to be a concession to “idealism” (on this see below). Grasping instinctively, or intuitively, that this refers to the rationalist theory of knowledge, but committed, by virtue of an uncritical exposition, to the doctrinal assertion of empiricism in Marx, Schmidt compels his account to vacillate in a quite bizarre way between two opposed and conflicting conceptions of knowledge.\n\n“Since men are forced to rely on material which exists independently of them, there is in fact nothing in their minds but what was previously present to their senses, as sensualist philosophers maintained”, that is, as the classical empiricists maintained.\n\nHere Schmidt vindicates Locke against Leibniz. But, on the other hand,\n\n“Perception itself … is based on conceptual operations”.\n\nAnd this is more in the tradition of Kant, or of Leibniz, or of classical rationalism.\n\nThis confusion is then resolved by the argument, a strange one, that the rationalist, in this case Hegel’s,\n\n“inversion of the sensualist principle that ‘there is nothing in the senses which was not previously in the mind’ becomes truer with the transition to the bourgeois era”.\n\nOr,\n\n“[u]nder preindustrial conditions the objective, natural moments are dominant, whilst in industrial society the moment of subjective intervention asserts itself in increasing measure… Marx also grasped the epistemological content of this economic fact, as can be seen from the first thesis on Feuerbach”.\n\nThis is one way of resolving the philosophical confusions one gets into when he/she starts, as Schmidt does, with the piously doctrinal notion that there is a clear logical continuity in Marx’s development. Schmidt is forced to reconcile deeply conflicting conceptions, conceptions that divide Locke and Leibniz, and ignores the fact that Marx would later reject Feuerbach’s empiricism and describe his own connection with it as “very humorous”.\n\nNow, in all of the cases mentioned above (Lenin, Della Volpe, Schmidt, Colletti), it is a certain conception of materialism, one that Marx himself rejects in theTheses, that entails, or implies, the resumption of such empiricist positions. Hegel had already noted the internal connection when he called materialism of this stamp “Empiricism … systematically carried out”, that is, ontologically inflated and expanded into a conception of “reality” as a whole. In the Marxist tradition, this movement works itself out in reverse.\n\nSensualism and the rudiments of praxiology in the Manuscripts\n\nAs early as the Manuscripts Marx announces the programme of elaborating a “ consistent humanism” that\n\n“differs both from idealism and from materialism and is at the same time their unifying truth”.\n\nBut it will take Marx roughly a year, the year that leads from the Manuscripts to theTheses, to draw out the real nucleus of this conception, the “germs of a new world outlook” (Engels). In theManuscripts, Feuerbach is totally exempt from criticism, and the argument proceeds from strictly sensualist premises. The consequence of this is that, in terms of the argument that is actually developed there, Marx can only end with a distinctly Kierkegaardian conception of man as a “suffering being”, who, “because he feels his suffering … is a passionate being”. And, as in Kierkegaard, so in Marx, this “passion” becomes the sign par excellence of “la realité du vécu’’, maintained, in both, against Hegel.\n\nBut a “passionate” or a “suffering” being is still only a natural being. This is the inner dilemma of theManuscripts. They stand halfway between two distinct definitions of what it means to be human.\n\nThe attempt here to overcome the false and abstract opposition of “spiritualism and objectivism’’ centres firmly on the relation of man to nature. Marx must overcome the false separation of subject and object without validating the “mysticism” of a “subjectivity that encroaches upon the object”, without validating Hegel, or the “false positivism” of his system, or the “formal and abstract” conception implied in the dialectic of self-consciousness. This, then, is Marx’s first effort to establish a real, and not merely formal, or abstract, or logical, tautoheterology.\n\nFor Marx will not simply say, ”man is man”, and he does not want to say only that “man is nature”.\n\n“The true essentiality of any thing is not the predication of it as identical with itself, or as different, or merely positive, or merely negative, but as having its being in an other which, being its self-same, is its essence”.\n\nTo establish the human essence as this real tautoheterological identity, and no longer as formal or abstract tautoheterology, i.e. of a “consciousness” that forms “the totality of its moments”, Marx roots the principle of identity in the conception of nature as sensuousness. “But nature, too, taken abstractly, for itself, and fixed in its separation from man, isnothing for man”, or it is “devoid of sense” or “abstract nature, nature as a thing of thought”.Now, if we acknowledge that “sensuousness … is the essence of nature”, then it follows that nature is a human essence, and this “human essence of nature” is the “natural essence of man”.Thus the conception of nature as sensuousness dialecticises the opposition of man and nature. But secondly, or more specifically, the conception of nature as “sensuous consciousness andsensuous need”establishes “objectivity” as what it truly is, as a dialectic of intersubjectivity. This is not a simple reciprocal implication of subject and object, for objectivity is here constituted as a function of the determination of subjectivity as sensuousness. For, as a “natural”, “sensuous” being, man,\n\n“is a suffering, conditioned and limited being, like animals and plants. That is to say, theobjects of his drives exist outside him asobjects independent of him; but these objects are objects of hisneed, essential objects”.\n\nIn other words, to be “sensuous”, that is, “natural”, is “to have sensuous objects outside oneself, objects of one’s sense perception”, and, on the other hand,\n\n“as soon as there are objects outside me…I am another, a realityother than the object outside me. For this third object I am therefore areality other than it, i.e.its object”.\n\nThe identity of subject and object is thus established here not immediately, or abstractly, but through the specific conceptions of “objectivity” and “sensuousness” that Marx installs into the argument and through the dialectic that they operate.\n\nBut Marx remained thoroughly dissatisfied with this, for the mediated identity of subject and object accomplished by this argument still presupposed the abstract or immediate identity of man and nature. It presupposed a conception of man as a merely “natural, objective, sensuous being”, or a conception of human nature as merely sensuous nature, that is, nature. And that is why Marx will conclude these tortured and difficult paragraphs with the admission,\n\n“But man is not only a natural being, he is a human natural being; i.e. he is a being for himself and hence aspecies-being, as which he must confirm and realize himself both in his being and in his knowing”.\n\nWhat distinguishes man as specifically human? human nature as human nature, and not just nature? Marx realises that sensuousness cannot solve this problem. For,\n\n“human sense, in its immediate and objective existence, (is not)human sensibility and human objectivity”.\n\nThe clue to the answer that Marx will later elaborate lies already in the Manuscripts, but inconsistently. This answer is contained in the pages which say,\n\n“The practical creation of an objective world, thefashioning of inorganic nature, is proof that man is a conscious species-being… It is true that animals also produce. They build nests, and dwellings, like the bee, the beaver, the ant, etc. But they produce only their own immediate needs … they produce one-sidedly, while man produces universally; they produce only when immediate physical need compels them to do so, while man produces even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom from such need… Such production is his active species-life”.\n\nHere is the conception that will drive Marx, after the Manuscripts and over the year that follows, to break with the sensualism of Feuerbach. For if “man produces even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom from such need”, then there is in human nature an element that stands apart from the rest of nature, an element that we can call “creativity”, but creativity here not in any instinctual sense, but as a function of the capacity to think, imagine, and reason. For there is one other passage in Marx’s work where he returns to this motif of what is specific about human production, a well-known passage written many years afterwards, and there he will say,\n\n“But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax… Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials. And this is a purpose he is conscious of”.\n\nPrecisely because the concern of these two passages is essentially the same, it is the contrast between them that is striking. This lies in the introduction, into the later passage, of the notion of “purpose”, i.e. of Reason, as we shall see shortly.\n\nThe Manuscripts are halfway, I said earlier. They are halfway between their own embryonic praxiology and the inherited sensualism of Feuerbach. And this is a tension that Marx fails to resolve in theManuscripts. For, though he is aware that historicity is a basic dimension ofhuman nature, and though he says, towards the end of theManuscripts, “We shall return to this later”, in theManuscripts he does not return to this, he goes on to discuss Hegel, and that is where they end.\n\nBut, in Theses, he returns to this. And these, precisely, are theses onFeuerbach. They signal the resolution of that conflict which accounts for the peculiarly difficult and involved character of theManuscripts.\n\nTowards a conception of human nature\n\nHow, then, does Marx propose to overcome Feuerbach’s sensualism?\n\nThe First Thesis says,\n\n“The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism (that of Feuerbach included) is that … reality, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form of the object or of contemplation, but not as sensuous, human activity, practice, not subjectively”.\n\nI want to argue that this thesis is formulated so much in Feuerbach’s own terms, the terms with which Marx will have little to do later, that its real content is easily lost. For example, even here, inTheses that are critical of Feuerbach, there is the same, implicit, but, in this case, only superficial, equation of “reality” with “sensuousness”. Thus, he writes, “reality, sensuousness…”, still very much in the style and manner of theManuscripts. Again, he says, “sensuous, human activity”, and this suggests that the real difference lies between “contemplation” on one side, and “activity” on the other.\n\nTake Schmidt. His interpretation is very much the traditional one, and vitiated precisely by the shallow understanding of Marx’s meaning rendered almost inevitable by his (Marx’s) formulations.\n\n“In Feuerbach, man the species-being, provided with merely natural qualities, confronts the dead objectivity of nature passively and intuitively rather thanactively and practically… Feuerbach’s man does not emerge as an independent productive force but remains bound to pre-human nature.Physical activity does, it is true, presuppose this natural basis… Allwork is work on a fixed being”.\n\nAnd so on. Here the “practice” that Marx opposes as a superior principle to Feuerbach’s sensualism is conceived as “physical activity”, “work”, etc. But to state the difference in this way is to leave enough room for Feuerbach to accommodate to the Theses. This is why Schmidt will eventually reject his own critical positions on Feuerbach and decide that\n\n“the characterization given in Chapter One of Feuerbach’s role in Marx’s development would now be more positive. In a study of Feuerbach I have endeavoured to show that the very concept of “mediating practice” which Marx and Engels polemically turned against Feuerbach owes in fact a great deal to him”.\n\nBut this rests on Schmidt’s own failure to grasp the content of Marx’s thesis. If one interprets the allusion to the “active side” developed by “idealism”,\n\n“Hence … the active side was developed … by Idealism” as the conception that “the world is mediated through the Subject”, as Schmidt does, this settles nothing, for the crux of the distinction lies precisely in the nature of this “mediation”. For “production” in the narrow and false sense of “physical activity” is still, after all, very much a process within nature itself (physical, from physis, ‘nature’). “Animals also produce”, Marx wrote, and then went on to describe how human production, or production as ahuman activity, is something deeper or less limited than mere “physical activity”.\n\nThe real clues to the difference thus lie in the other terms:\n\n“The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism (that of Feuerbach included) is that … reality … is conceived only in the form of the object or of contemplation, but not as … human activity, practice,subjectively.”\n\nThat is to say, “reality”, which is “practice”, can only be understood “subjectively”, that is, in relation to a principle of subjectivity. Or, in the terms of my own argument, “practice” remains impenetrable if it is not grasped as implying, or asserting, a theory of human nature. To go back to the Manuscripts,history can only really become a principle in the argument if it is taken, or can be shown to be, or is understood as, a “confirmation and realization” of human nature, or of those “dispositions and capacities” and those “drives” that form man’s “species-powers”.[106]Or, history, to be really, or truly, the “process of self-creation of man”[107], must imply a notion of reality as “the confirmation of man’s essential powers”. It must be shown to be “the reality of his own essential powers”.[108]\n\nBut none of this can actually be established if we reverse the terms of Marx’s argument and conceive “practice” as mere “sensuousness”, that is, like Schmidt, accentuate only, or mainly, the sensuous (i.e. physical) determinations of human activity. For sensuousness cannot establish why, or how, in what respect, human nature ishuman.\n\nHere, Marx had simply no alternative. To break the vicious circle of the Manuscripts, he could only return to a conception of human nature that underlies not only the tradition of German “idealism” but practically the whole philosophical thought of the west. This refers, of course, to the definition, first proposed in this form by Aristotle, that\n\n“Man is an animate being endowed with the power of reason”.\n\nThat is, to a conception of human nature as rational nature that recurs, closer to Marx’s own time, in Kant.[109] And this enables us to see that the notion of “practice” not only remains impenetrable if it is not grasped as a theory of human nature, butcannot be grasped as a theory ofknowledge. The praxiology of Marx is thus an epistemological humanism, a fusion of moments that lie separate and external to each other in the classical tradition of philosophy.\n\nThus Thesis 2 (to which I shall return later) says,\n\n“Man must prove … the reality and power … of his thinking in practice”.\n\nThesis 8 that,\n\n“All the mysteries which lead theory into mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in thecomprehension of this practice”.\n\nThesis 1 will itself call practice, “practical-critical activity”.\n\nAnd earlier, in the Manuscripts, where this line of thought is already prefigured,\n\n“the history of industry and theobjective existence of industry as it has developed is theopen book of the essential powers of man, man’spsychology present in tangible form”.\n\nAnd, as we moveon into Capital, it is this line of thought that comes more sharply into focus, precisely in contexts that discuss production as a general human activity, and the specific character of production in bourgeois society.\n\nTautology and heterology in classical philosophy\n\nThe praxiology of Marx, sketched “hurriedly, for later elaboration”, still dense with the resonances of Marx’s fading Feuerbachianism, resumes the programme announced, but not accomplished, in the Manuscripts, viz. “consistent humanism”\n\n“differs both from idealism and materialism and is at the same time their unifying truth”.\n\nFirst, idealism. This was a term by which Marx referred indiscriminately to the whole tradition of classical rationalism, which in “separating thought from sense-perception”or in opposing “thought” to “sense perception” as a higher principle, validated the claims of Reason, or of the intrinsically rational determination of human nature, only “abstractly” or tautologically. One of the earliest and most definite expressions of this movement of thought is the Florentine Platonism associated with Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, a Platonism which, hostile to all empirical science, or, like Pico, consciously downgrading our perceptions of the world as intrinsically unstable and deceptive, fails to exert any decisive influence on the “New Science” of Galileo. Thus, if there is a Galilean Platonism, then this derives from the later, more rigorously mathematical and scientifically-oriented tradition represented by Tartaglia, reviver of Archimedes, and his pupil Ricci.\n\nDogmatism, or the tautology of reason, is the permanent temptation and latent tendency of the whole classical rationalist tradition. This rationalist tautology, grounded in the abstract separation of “thought” and “sense perception”, is in fact much less evident where it is generally sought, namely, in rationalist psychology and the thesis of “innate ideas” and must be found at a different level altogether. For the crude versions of the theory of “innate ideas”, the notion, in other words, that because innately humans are characterised by certain rational faculties, or powers, or dispositions, human “knowledge” is innate – this version is one that very few of the major rationalists will ever argue. Even Leibniz, a passionate proponent of this thesis, will agree that\n\n“the external senses are necessary to us for thinking, and, if we had none, we could not think”.\n\nLeibniz will then add, to clarify matters,\n\n“But that which is necessary for something does not for all that constitute its essence. Air is necessary for life, but our life is something else than air. The senses furnish us the matter for reasoning, and we never have thoughts so abstract that something from the senses is not mingled therewith”\n\nWhen we turn to passages of this sort, then the force of the critique that Kant later directs against Leibniz is undermined. When Kant says, “Sensibility is something quite positive and an indispensable adjunct to our intellect”,[116] this is something Leibniz would not have disagreed with.\n\nThat most rationalists were prepared to accept, even if only formally or abstractly, a tautoheterology of reason and experience, only shows that classical rationalism came much closer, despite its internal tendency, to a dialectical conception of knowledge than any of the numerous proponents of empiricism. But, at another level, the tautological character, or tendency, of classical rationalism becomes much more apparent. The methodologies proposed by it, identifying with the Renaissance ideal of rational certitude, in which Galileo saw the “equality” of the human intellect with the divine,find in mathematics, and particularly in geometry, but here only under the influence of the scientific revolution itself (cf. Kepler, ubi materia,ibi geometria), thenormative model of all human cognition, including, as we know, of the “moral” or human sciences (Hobbes, Spinoza). It is this aspect of classical rationalism that Lukács defines as its central characteristic in some of the most brilliant pages written by any Marxist on such questions:\n\n“The attempt to universalise rationalism necessarily issues in the demand for a system… The correct positing of a principle implies – at least in its general tendency – the positing of the whole system determined by it; the consequences are contained in the principle, they can be deduced from it, they are predictable and calculable… This notion of system makes it clear why pure and applied mathematics have constantly been held up as the methodological model and guide for modern philosophy”.\n\nWhat Lukács calls the “problem of irrationality”, that is, of the “intractability of given contents to the concepts of the understanding”, thus expresses the same tendency of thought that Marx sees issuing in the “false positivism” of Hegel’s system.\n\n“It is evident that the principle of systematisation is not reconcilable with the recognition of any ‘facticity’ [Tatsachlichkeit], of a ‘content’ which in principle cannot be deduced from the principle of form and which, therefore, has simply to be accepted as actuality [Faktizitat]… Instead it must be wholly absorbed into the rational system of the concepts of the understanding… In this event, thought regresses to the level of naïve, dogmatic rationalism”.\n\nWhat Lukács here calls the “postulate” of systematic rationalism, that is, of the deducibility of all contents from a “basic principle”, expresses only the aggressive claims of a Reason that seeks to establish its power, or validate its truth, tautologically, or by reference to itself alone. But, even here, it is necessary to recognise the tensions, or the subtlety, of rationalist thought. Take Spinoza. Like so many of the rationalists, he identifies the form of mathematical or deductive reasoning as the sole method of attaining “true knowledge”. But Spinoza is then aware that the proof of a theorem is not what makes the theorem true, and he introduces, therefore, the further idea that “it belongs to the very nature of thought” that we form “true ideas”. But because these conceptions are never very clearly separated, the argument is permeated by ambiguity.\n\n“It is clear…that certainty consists in nothing but the idea itself … certainty consists in adequate ideas. As truth needs no external sign, but it suffices to know the ideational essence of things (or what is the same, their adequate ideas) … it follows that the true method does not consist in looking for the signs of the truth of our ideas after we have acquired them, but in the methodical search for the truth, the adequate ideas”.\n\nThus, here the truth of our knowledge is something that requires no external procedure of verification, no reference to anything other than the idea itself. This whole process of self-validating thought begins not with “axioms”, for from these alone “the intellect cannot descend to the understanding of individual things, since axioms have reference to an infinity of things”, but with what Spinoza calls “definitions”:\n\n“The concept or definition of a thing must be such as to enable us to deduce from it all the properties of that thing so far, of course, as it is considered by itself alone and not in conjunction with other things. This can be illustrated by our definition of the circle”.\n\nBut how can we arrive at such “definitions”? Because, he suggests, “it is quite clearly the nature of a thinking being to form true or adequate ideas”, or, “truth” is given by “the nature and power of the intellect alone”.\n\nIt should be obvious, finally, that Marx saw in Hegel’s dialectic of self-consciousness precisely a tautology of this sort, of a “consciousness” that establishes itself as the “object”, or “establishes the object as itself”, and which, in superseding this objectivity and alienation, remains “at home in its other-being as such”.\n\n“Consciousness – knowing as knowing, thinking as thinking – claims to be the direct opposite of itself, claims to be the sensuous world, reality, life – thought overreaching itself in thought”.\n\nMarx is saying that Hegel’s dialectic is only formally, or abstractly, or falsely, tautoheterological. In fact, it is a tautology that leaves the moment of “otherness” – the sensuous world, reality, and so on – unvanquished and issues, therefore, in a “false positivism”. If you like, the “rational core” of Hegel’s dialectic, Marx argues, lies in its tautoheterological structure. Its “mysticism” consists in the fact that this is only “formally”, or “abstractly” a tautoheterology, for the “object”, or the moment of “otherness” [heteron] is only “objectified self-consciousness”, or the “movement” as a whole is only a movement of “consciousness”.\n\nThus, idealism develops the “active side”, or it asserts the principle of subjectivity, or of reason, but only “abstractly”, or formally, or tautologically.\n\nAgainst all of which stand materialism, empiricism, naturalism as tautologies of matter or experience or nature. Here “sense perception”, or “sensuousness”, or “objectivity”, or “nature” are separated from “thought” and exhaust it. This dogmatising empiricism which “conceives reality only in the form of the object”, as pure givenness or facticity, or as a world “in itself”, or as “underivable, primordial being”, this dogmatising empiricism is likewise, symmetrically, but more crudely, without any of the subtlety of rationalist thought, characterised by the following conceptions. By the notion, firstly, that all our knowledge has its sole “foundation” in “experience”. In Lenin’s words, that our “Sensations give us an objectively true image of the external world”. And, just as the dogmatising rationalism of the 17th century was eventually compelled to displace the function of securing “truth” for our knowledge from the form of reasoning itself to “intuition”, or to what Leibniz calls “the light born within us”, or (cf. Hobbes) to “definitions” understood as nominalist conventions, so the conception that our sensations are, on their own, or with the aid of induction, sufficient to render a “true” account of nature, or of the world, would have to rely on a naturalistic doctrine of observation, the pure form of which is discernible in “Aristotelian” empiricism. For,\n\n“[t]he demand that we base knowledge upon experience makes excellent sense in the Aristotelian philosophy where experience is defined as the sum-total of what is observed under normal circumstances … and what is then described in some ordinary idiom that is understood by all. Aristotelian empiricism, as a matter of fact, is the only empiricism that is both clear – one knows what kind of thing experience is supposed to be – andrational – one can give reasons why experience is stable…”\n\nCharacterised, secondly, by a methodology the reverse of pure deductivism, the method of induction, the specific hallmark of Newton’s empiricism with its desperate and contrived efforts to secure this doctrine against the claims of Reason, called “hypotheses”; e.g., the attempts that characterise Newton’s successive drafts of his Fourth Rule of conduct of empiricism. The first draft says,\n\n“In experimental philosophy [science – JB] one is not to argue from hypotheses against propositions drawn by induction from phenomena. For if arguments from hypotheses are admitted against inductions, then the arguments of inductions on which all experimental philosophy is founded could always be overthrown by contrary hypotheses. If a certain proposition drawn by induction is not yet sufficiently precise, it must be corrected not by hypotheses but by the phenomena of nature more fully and more accurately observed”.\n\nThis rule rests, in short, on the pure fideism of experience, that blind faith, as mystical and irrational as all faith, in the certainty, or the accuracy, or the reliability, or the veracity, of our “sensations”. The intensely dogmatic form in which Newton casts his Rules only indicates the anxiety that runs through the whole tradition of empiricism, so that, between a “demonstrative” science of nature, or a science founded on certainty, and the method of induction, there is an absolute contradiction that can be resolved only in favour of one or the other. Thus, whereas classical, 17th century rationalism sought to secure the ideal of rational certitude by generalising the model of mathematical proof, classical, 18th century, empiricism would abandon this ideal forever, in the direction of agnosticism, or conjecturalism, or probabilism.\n\nFinally, when “systematically carried out,” empiricism will end with its own metaphysics, absorbing man into nature, or mind into matter. This is as true of Feuerbach’s sensualism or of Lenin’s materialism in 1908, as of the earlier “crude, simple, metaphysical materialism” that Lenin himself rejects (18th century French materialism, 19th century German materialism). In its “systematic” form empiricism thus vacillates between a conception of theidentity of man and nature (or mind and matter) asserted as an immediate,abstract identity, cf. Marx himself in theManuscripts, and aheterology of man and nature, affirmed in the notion that though man is a “part of” nature, nature remains a force greater than man, a force that conditions him externally, a situation which ‘’imposes itself” on him; cf. Schmidt, “In the Marxist dialectic … it is non-identity” that is, heterology or difference, “which is victorious in the last instance”;or cf. Timpanaro, proponent par excellence,\n\n“If materialism amounted merely to the recognition of a reality external to the subject, then Plato, St. Thomas and all their followers would also be materialists”.\n\nA significant admission. But\n\n“Materialism is not just ‘realism’… By materialism we understand above all acknowledgement of the priority of nature over ‘mind’, or, if you like, of the physical level over the biological level, and of the biological level over the socio-economic and cultural level”.\n\nBut whichever form of this ontology one accepts, it remains true that reality is here “conceived only in the form of the object”, as an otherness, given, external and opposed to “consciousness”. In this materialism, the one that Marx attacks in Thesis l, empiricism thus reveals its true character as “a doctrine of bondage”.\n\nSo, in all these forms, or at all these levels, a dogmatic empiricism, and there can be no other sort, confronts a dogmatising rationalism in an insoluble problematic. Against both these, Marx proposes, as their superior or “unifying” truth, the conception of practice as a theory of knowledge, and of this practice as the necessary form in which human nature “confirms and realizes” itself, or those powers that define its species.\n\nIt follows also that, if Marx’s praxiology is to break with, or to overcome, or leave behind, the tautologies of Reason and Matter, then practice must be understood as a tautoheterology, or it must be understood dialectically. The rest of this essay is, then, basically about this.\n\nThe tautoheterology of “practice”\n\n(a) The Dynamic Rationalism of Entelechy\n\nWriting a history, in this case, the history of philosophy, Hegel faces the problem of defining “development”.\n\n“In order to comprehend what development is, what may be called two different states must be distinguished. The first is what is known as capacity, power, what I call ‘being-in-itself’ (dynamis). The second principle is that of being-for-itself, actuality (energeia)”.\n\nAnd these terms refer us back to Aristotle, in whose ontology all “being” [ousia] is conceived as “activity”. In the first place, “activity” in the Aristotelian-ontological sense, is simply the operation or functioning of “powers”, or capacities, or dispositions, or drives, that are in themselves merely innate, or implicit, or merely “potential”. And, conversely, “a thing can become only what it has the specific power to become, only what it alreadyis, in a sense,potentially”. But, secondly, for Aristotle, these “activities and functions are logically prior to powers”, that is, we can only understand “powers in terms of their operations. We understand the power of sight or vision in terms of the activity of seeing… We understand the power of thinking in terms of the activity of thinking”.\n\nOr, in Marx’s terms, without “industry”, or production, or human activity in the broadest sense, we could not know man’s “psychology”. It would not be an “open” book, and therefore not be a book that we could read at all. The human essence would remain impenetrable.\n\nThirdly, in the Aristotelian ontology, “activities” divide into two classes, those directed to an external end, and those comprising their “end in themselves”. Activities of the latter sort are “entelechic”, or they have their “end” [telos] within [en] themselves.\n\nSo, when Hegel defines “development”, he defines it basically in the precise sense the Aristotelians gave to “entelechy”. A “development” is an “operation” or a functioning of “capacities” that lie implicit within the process and constitute their “goal”. Hegel illustrates this with an “example”, but an important one, which should hardly be called just an example.\n\n“If we say, for example, that man is by nature rational, we would mean that he has reason only inherently or in embryo”.\n\nTo say that human nature is rational nature (as was said earlier) is to ascribe “reason” as an innate power or capacity to human beings. It is to say that “reason” is a species-power.\n\n“In this sense reason, understanding, imagination, will are possessed from birth”.\n\nYet crucially,\n\n“while the child only has capacities or the potentiality of reason, it is just the same as if this child had no reason”.\n\nThat is, a reason that is merely innate, or simply “potential”, is like no reason at all.\n\n“Reason does not yet exist in the child since he cannot yet do anything rational”.\n\nOr, being rational entails “doing” something rational. Or, a “power” that does not function or operate at all is as good as no power, for we would have no knowledge of it. To this principle, Aristotle’s, Hegel gives the name of “the principle of projection into existence”.\n\n“The principle of this projection into existence is that the power cannot remain merely implicit, but is impelled towards development”.\n\nOr, what is only “implicit” must become “explicit”, it must “operate” or it must develop.\n\nSo far, then, Hegel only repeats, or deepens, Aristotle’s conception. But now he adds a further determination, for,\n\n“That which is implicit comes into existence… It certainly passes into change, yet it remains one and the same, for the whole process is dominated by it”.\n\nSo “development” is tautoheterology, an identity of identity and difference, of the one and the many, and so on.\n\nTo define “powers” or capacities or dispositions in this Aristotelian-Hegelian sense is to constitute those powers, etc., as generative principles. It amounts to defining all development as a “generative process”. And this permits an extension of the argument.\n\nMarx says, all hitherto existing materialism conceives reality only “in the form of the object”. That is, as something finished, or dead, or external. Nine years earlier, in 1836, Wilhelm von Humboldt had proposed an identical criticism of the existing conceptions of language. He wrote,\n\n“We must look upon language [Sprache] not as a lifeless product [wie ein todtes Erzeugtes] but far more as a generative activity [eine Erzeugung]”.\n\nIt is of course from Humboldt, and from the whole rationalist psychology of the preceding epoch, that Chomsky will derive the notion of a “generative grammar”.The theory of “generative grammar” resumes, or recapitulates, the Aristotelian distinction between “powers” and “operation” as the (linguistic) distinction between “competence” and “performance”. “Competence” here refers to those rules of “universal grammar” internalised in the speaker’s mind as innate properties of human intelligence. Without such an innate schematism it would be impossible to account precisely for the creative, and, of course, rationally creative, aspects of language-acquisition and use. For example, by a fairly early age, children are capable of uttering novel sentences merely on the basis of the finite and grammatically degenerate sample to which they have till then been exposed. And, yet, even a native language is in a very real sense something that is learned. It follows that, in this case, the “innateness” hypothesis does not exhaust, or dispose of, the necessity for a theory of “performance”, but specifies in advance what sort of process “learning”, or the acquisition of language, is. The innate cognitive mechanisms, or principles, or “ideas” are only set into operation, or only become active, with experience. Thus, in this case, one is dealing with a dialectic of “competence” and “performance”, or of “powers” and “activities”, or, more generally, of reason and experience. In short, dealing with tautoheterology.\n\nThis connection between the rationalist theory of human intelligence, or the Platonic theory of learning, and development as tautoheterology is not an extrinsic or accidental one, for,\n\n“In the process of development the notion keeps to itself… It is this nature of the notion – this manifestation of itself in its process as a development of its own self – which is chiefly in view with those who speak of “innate ideas”, or who, like Plato, describe all learning merely as recollection.”\n\n(b) Intentions. Freedom as the Spontaneity of Reason\n\n“The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism … is that … reality is conceived only in the form of the object”.\n\nThat is, as an “objectivity” that is given, external to man, imposed on him, conditioning him. As the “objectivity” of postivising Marxism, or “of a world that stands opposed to us in its strangeness”. Hegel says this, and adds, it is a mistake to\n\n“regard the antithesis of subjectivity and objectivity as an abstract and permanent one. The two are wholly dialectical”.[138]\n\nBy which he means,\n\n“the object is not rigid and processless”.\n\nOr, put another way, the “object” is defined by its “rigidity”, by being the merely immediate, or given, or external, only in that conception of “objectivity”, or “form”, as Hegel here calls it, proposed by the “mechanical” view of nature.The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism, Marx writes, is that\n\n“reality is conceived only in the form of the object…not as human activity, practice”.\n\nAnd Sartre, correctly,\n\n“But if human reality is action, this means evidently that its determination to action is itself action. If we reject this principle, and if we admit that human reality can be determined to action by a prior state of the world or of itself, this amounts to putting a given at the beginning of the series. Then theseacts disappear as acts in order to give place to a series ofmovements”.\n\nThat is to say, we would then be defining reality as human activity only to reconstruct this “activity” in the conceptions of “mechanism” or in the “mechanical mode of inquiry”. And this would be to regress to the level of behaviourism, chief opponent of a modern rationalist psychology. Moreover, “if the"
