        "text": "The notion of 'educating the educator' appeared as part of Marx's posthumously published Theses on euerbach (1845), which criticizes the materialism of fellow Left Hegelian Ludwig Feuerbach for being merely contemplative [anschauend] \" and one-sided. It accounts for the sensuousness (Sinnlichkeit) of the world of our xperience and its impact on our consciousness, Marx argues, but fails to address the way our praxis constitutes his world. Feuerbach, thus, misses the fact that we are encountering ourselves, the outcome of our labor, when e encounter the world; what Georg Lukács will later describe as a condition of reification. Moreover, Marx ontinues, any materialism that overlooks the transformative role of our praxis—the negativity Hegel located at he core of subjectivity1—prevents us from grasping not only the truth of experience, but the significance of evolutionary praxis as well.2 We are thus limited to what Jacques Rancière calls \" impotent contemplation \" 3 nd Lukács describes as a \" fatalistic stance, \" 4 allowing us to do little more than interpret the world, when, as arx's famous eleventh thesis on Feuerbach proclaims, the task is to change it. Although the eleventh thesis continues to be the most famous, Marx's third thesis—wherein he asserts it is essential to educate the educator \" —arguably provides more insight into his critical project and the history G. W. F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, trans. A. V. Miller (New York: Oxford, 1977), para. 194. Hegel claimed that the proof of concepts is found in their actualization in the world—allowing immediate ertainty to become mediated truth—while Marx argued this actualization is the result of praxis, which is why he omission of praxis obscures the nature of truth. Jacques Rancière, The Philosopher and His Poor, trans.\n\nThe paper explores the “critical disciple” relationship that Marx claims to have had with Hegel at the time he was writing Capital, by focusing on the problem of the status of concepts and theoretical discourse. Using freely, for hermeneutical purposes, the three critical models developed by Marx in the course of his critique of Hegelian speculation in his 1843 manuscript Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie, the paper attempts to shed light on the content of Marx’s claimed “overturning” of Hegelian dialectic. Starting from the destitution of philosophy undertaken in the 1845-1846 drafts, we show that Marx identifies, at the very heart of the Hegelian philosophical discourse, an alienated relation to the concept, which we propose to name “concept fetishism”, based on a parallel with the analysis of commodity fetishism. We then analyse the strategies implemented by Marx in Capital to put to work the dialectical “method” elaborated by Hegel without falling back into this fetishism of the concept. From this point of view, Marx appears at the end of our analysis as a disciple of Hegel in that he takes up some of his conceptual and argumentative innovations ; but he appears as a critic of Hegel as far as the status of the theoretical discourse and the concepts by means of which the thinker tries to reconstruct and make sense of the concrete that he is trying to think are concerned.\n\nWe ignore the history of philosophy at our peril. Engels, who typically conflates Marx and Marxism, points to the relation of Marxism to the tradition while also denying it. In his little book on Feuerbach, Engels depicts Feuerbach as leading Marx away from Hegel, away from classical German philosophy, away from philosophy and towards materialism and science. This view suggests that Marx is at best negatively related to Classical German philosophy, including Hegel. Yet Engels elsewhere suggests that Marx belongs to the classical German philosophical tradition. In the preface to Socialism, Utopian and Scientific, Engels wrote: “We German socialists are proud that we trace our descent not only from Saint Simon, Fourier and Owen, but also from Kant, Fichte and Hegel” (Marx & Engels, Collected Works). In this paper I will focus on Marx’s relation to Fichte. This relation is rarely mentioned in the Marxist debate, but I will argue, it is crucial for the formulation of Marx’s position, and hence for assessing his contribution accurately. One of the results of this study will be to indicate that Marx, in reacting against Hegel, did not, as is often suggested, ‘leave’ philosophy, but in fact made a crucial philosophical contribution."
