        "text": "Friedrich Engels's Ludwig Feuerbach and the Outcome of Classical German Philosophy is one of the most important texts in the classical Marxist canon. Written in 1886, three years after Marx's death, Engels takes up the suggestion from the editors of Die Neue Zeit, the theoretical journal of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, to write a reply to C. N. Starcke’s recently published book on Ludwig Feuerbach. Similar to his book Anti-Dühring, the opportunity is used to flesh out, in an unprecedented manner, his and Marx's views on the influence of G. W. F. Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach's philosophy on their development of the dialectical materialist worldview–the Marxist outlook. In the present text, Dr. Thomas Riggins provides an illuminating exegesis of this seminal work, explaining with unmatched lucidity Engels' arguments and their philosophical context. In addition to Dr. Riggins’s detailed interpretation and the original Engels text, this book also includes a collection of three other important articles from Dr. Riggins on Engels's contributions to Marxism.\n\nPublished by the Midwestern Marx Publishing Press (ISBN: 979-8-218-95982-1) The publishing press of the MIDWESTERN MARX INSTITUTE FOR MARXIST THEORY AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS"
