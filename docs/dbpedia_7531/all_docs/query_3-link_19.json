        "text": "Marx and Engels on Philosophy\n\nEarly Philosophical Works.\n\nMarx: 1841 - 1845\n\nAnti-Schelling, 1841\n\nEngels’ response to Friedrich Schelling’s attack on Hegel, 1841. This work is recommended for the seasoned student of philosophy only. Wrriten before Engels had met Karl Marx, this is the earliest glimpse of how Marx and Engels arrived at their own approach to critique of Hegel’s philosophy.\n\nFor comments on this see The Expurgation of Hegelianism by Andy Blunden, 1999\n\nMarx’s Doctoral Dissertation, 1841\n\nEntitled “The Difference between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature”, this work is recommended for the seasoned student of philosophy only. In promoting Epicurus as against Democritus, we the young Marx already searching for a critique of Hegel. At the same time, in his exploration of these philosophers, Marx shows a profound understanding of the contradiction between the immediately given world of sense perception and the essence of our human relation with Nature.\n\nFor a short commentary on this see Marx’s Critique of Hegel by Cyril Smith, 1999\n\nCritique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, Marx, 1843\n\nMarx has copied each paragraph from the section of Hegel’s work on the State and written his annotations and commentary on it. This work shows the early development of Marx's criticism of Hegel, inspired by Ludwig Feuerbach, but with the outlines of his own critique beginning to appear.\n\nMarx further develops these ideas in On the Jewish Question, and you can read\n\nHegel's Philosophy of Right and other commentaries on Hegel's theory of the state:\n\nHegel's First System, Herbert Marcuse 1941; Hegel's Theory of the Modern State, Shlomo Avineri, 1972; Hegel's philosophy of State, Z Pelczynski, 1984; The Young Hegel, 1938\n\nEconomic & Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\n\nComment on James Mill.\n\nThis is the first statement of Marx's critique of political economy. If you were to read only one article on philsoophy, this would be it. In this work Marx shows how money intervenes in the relation of person to person and establishes itself as an independent power over and above people, but nevertheless is nothing but a human power. These ideas are further developed in the 1844 Manuscripts which follow, eventually finding their mature form in Capital. These manuscripts were not deciphered until 1932.\n\nSee Marx's Theory of Alienation by István Mészáros.\n\nFor a further exploration of the ideas in this note see the excerpt from discussion on the SPSM listserv by Juan Inigo\n\nPreface to Philosophical Manuscripts\n\nEstranged Labour\n\nPrivate Property and Communism\n\nHuman Requirements and Division of Labour\n\nThe Power of Money\n\nCritique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole\n\nStudy Guide\n\nFor recent commentary see: Knowledge and Human Interests by Jürgen Habermas (1968); Marx's Theory of Alienation by István Mészáros (1970); The Standpoint of Socialised Humanity by Cyril Smith (1998)\n\nIn the course of these manuscripts, Marx develops his critique of Hegel and of Ludwig Feuerbach and marks out the main outlines of his conception of communism. These are not easy reading, but you should return to them time and again as you learn more and more about Marxism\n\nOn the Jewish Question, 1844\n\nThis work is important for understanding the foundations of Marx’s view of history, the state and society.\n\nThis work comes out of Marx's earlier Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right. See: Hegel's Theory of the Modern State by Shlomo Avineri, and Marx's Theory of Alienation by István Mészáros.\n\nSee also, for a contrary view, Althusser on “The problem of Marx’s early works”\n\nThe Holy Family, 1845\n\nThis very polemical work written by Marx and Engels against the ‘Young Hegelians’ is hard going, but contains some readable passages. Try chapters II and III, and for a very brief history of philosophical materialism see Chapter VI\n\nTheses on Feuerbach, 1845\n\nIn this single most famous and important work of Marx on philosophy, Marx puts forward 11 short theses defining the foundations of his view of human knowledge, practice and history.\n\nSee Marxism and Philosophy by Karl Korsch (1923) and Evald Ilyenkov’s Dialectics as Logic and Idealism or Materialism?.\n\nStudy Guide\n\nThe German Ideology, Karl Marx & Frederick Engels, 1845\n\nThis work was never completed or published. Its early chapters contain important statements of Marx and Engels’ position on philosophical materialism, method of investigation, history, class, revolution, etc., etc. The remainder of the work is scattered with gems on subjects as diverse and language, technology, agriculture, etc., etc.\n\nStudy Guide\n\nLetter to Annenkov, 1846\n\nFamous letter cautioning against mechanical or formal conceptions of “productive forces” and explaining his dialectical approach to the conception of these relations.\n\nSee The Violence of Abstraction: 2 Productive Forces, by Derek Sayer (1987).\n\nWage Labour and Capital, 1847\n\nIn this first systematic elaboration of his critique of political economy, Marx develops the basic concepts. Chapter 5 in particular makes it clear how Marx understands the concepts of political economy as a mystification of the relationships between people.\n\nStudy Guide\n\nThe Nature and Growth of Capital\n\nHegel, Economics, and Marx's Capital by Cyril Smith (1998)\n\nPreparatory work and early chapters of Capital.\n\nMarx: 1852 - 1867\n\nThe Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, 1852\n\nThis study of the French Revolution marks a definitive point in the development of Marx and Engels' understanding of history and in particular the nature and position of the bourgeoisie. The first chapter in particular contains some famous formulations of the principles of historical materialism.\n\nStudy Guide\n\nChapter I.\n\nSpeech at anniversary of the People’s Paper, 1856\n\nA speech by Marx where he outlines in a popular form his ideas about the conflict between the productive forces and the relations of production.\n\nGrundrisse, 1857\n\nThis is Marx’s preparatory work for Capital. When it was first published until 1953 and translated into English in 1973, it was a bombshell, for it showed irrefutably that as late as 1857, Marx was still working through Hegel's concepts in the development of his analysis of bourgeois society. Almost 1,000 pages long and barely structured it is not an easy read. However, there are a number of passages which clarify Marx's views on a range of important methodological problems.\n\nThe following chapters are of particular interest:\n\nThe Method of Political Economy.\n\nProduction.\n\nThe General Relation of Production, Exchange & Consumption.\n\nSee Marx's Grundrisse and Hegel's Logic by Hiroshi Uchida (1988),\n\nDialectics of the Abstract & the Concrete in Marx's Capital by Ilyenkov\n\nPreface to the Critique of Political Economy, 1859\n\nThis Preface contains one of Marx’s most famous and succinct statement of his view of history and the meaning of philosophical materialism.\n\nSee Relations of Production, by Derek Sayer (1987).\n\nCapital, I, 1867\n\nThe First four chapters include a number of important observations on philosophy, and the Afterword contains a well-known statement of Marx's relation to Hegel.\n\nChapter One: Section 1, Commodities.\n\nChapter One: Section 2, The Two-fold Character of Labour.\n\nChapter One: Section 4, The Fetishism of Commodities.\n\nAfterword to the Second German Edition.\n\nStudy Guide\n\nFor various commentaries on philosophical aspects of Capital see:\n\nDialectics of the Abstract & the Concrete in Marx's Capital by Ilyenkov (1960), Marx's Capital, Philosophy and Political Economy by Geoff Pilling (1980), The Logic of Marx's Capital, by Tony Smith (1990)\n\nPopularisations.\n\nEngels: 1878 - 1886\n\nAnti-Dühring, 1877\n\nEighty per cent of this book is made up of exceedingly boring refutations of the views of the now long-forgotten Eugen Dühring. However, in winding up on each theme, Engels puts forward his own view, often in extremely succinct and highly readable form. The sections below deal with some classic themes.\n\nIntroduction: General.\n\nApriorism.\n\nFreedom and Necessity.\n\nDialectics: Quantity and Quality.\n\nDialectics: Negation of the Negation.\n\nTo get an idea of the controversy around some of Engels' formulations in this work see Leninist Dialectics & Metaphysics of Positivism, Ilyenkov 1979, Subject & Object In Hegel, Lukacs 1923, The Dogmatic Dialectic and the Critical Dialectic, Jean-Paul Sartre, 1960, Contradiction and Overdetermination, Louis Althusser, 1962.\n\nOn Dialectics, 1878\n\nSocialism: Utopian & Scientific, 1878\n\nThis pamphlet is a classic text, obligatory for all students of Marxism.\n\nStudy Guide\n\nSocialism.\n\nDialectics.\n\nHistorical Materialism.\n\nSocial Classes — Necessary and Superfluous, 1881\n\nShort sketch of the Marxist conception of social class.\n\nDialectics of Nature, 1883\n\nIn this controversial book by Engels, he explains the basic ideas of dialectics by demonstrating how these relationships are manifested in our understanding of Nature.\n\nRefer to the same works cited above in relation to Anti-Dühring, and the archive of a discussion list which includes a discussion around dialectics of nature.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nDialectics.\n\nLudwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy, 1886\n\nThis pamphlet, written by Engels after Marx's death, is probably the most readable, comprehensive and profound of Marx & Engels’ expositions of philosophy. The chapter on Feuerbach is not too interesting for us nowadays, but the other three together constitute a short three-part lesson in Marxist Philosophy.\n\nHegel.\n\nMaterialism.\n\nFeuerbach.\n\nMarx.\n\nRefer to the Ludwig Feuerbach Internet Archive.\n\nLetters on Dialectics, 1844 - 1895\n\nEngels’ fight against simplistic interpretations of Marx.\n\nEngels: 1890 - 1894\n\nLetter to Otto Von Bönigk, 1890\n\nLetter cautioning against metaphysical, formal or utopian conceptions of socialism.\n\nLetter to J. Bloch, 1890\n\nFamous letter cautioning against exaggerated or one-sided understanding of Marx's views on the materialist conception of history.\n\nLetter to Starkenburg, 1894\n\nLetter cautioning against a deterministic interpretation of historical materialism."
