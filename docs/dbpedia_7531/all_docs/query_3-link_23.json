        "text": "the very essence of things\", and (Selected Works, London: Lawrence & Wishart, Ltd., 1939, Vol. XI, pp. 81-82) that \"development is the 'struggle' of opposites\". (Ibid., p. 410.)\n\n[225]\n\n1 \"The dialectic of the concept itself became merely the conscious reflex of the dialectical motion of the real world.\" Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach . . . in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 453. See above, p. 209, note 1, and p. 222, note 1.\n\n2 Cf. George M. M. Cottier, \"La Philosophie de la praxis,\" Revue Thomiste, LV, no. 3 (1955), pp. 582-614.\n\n[226]\n\n1 \"The question whether objective truth is an attribute of human thought -- is not a theoretical but a practical question. Man must prove the truth, i.e. the reality and power, the 'this-sidedness' of his thinking in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking that is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.\" \"The philosophers have only interpreted the world differently, the point is, to change it.\" Theses on Feuerbach, II and XI, as an Appendix in Marx - Engels, The German Ideology, Parts I & III, pp. 197, 199. (Italics ours.) Cf. the common translation based on Engels' edition of the Theses in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. 471, 473.\n\n2 It is thus that in his Ludwig Feuerbach. . . (in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. 432-433) Engels explains that our knowledge concerning the chemical constitution of a given coloring matter is only verified when we are capable of producing the agent in question, and that it was the discovery of a hitherto unknown planet, whose position had previously been computed, which verified the Copernican theory. He might just as well like many a \"practical man\" who considers himself clever, invoke the example of Diogenes proving the reality of movement by walking.\n\n3 Cf. above, chap. VII, p. 133.\n\n[227]\n\n1 Cf. above, pp. 223-225. The way in which Marx and Engels, each in his own manner, explain the dialectical law of the transformations of property is a remarkable example of the inevitable arbitrariness we are speaking of here. (Cf. Karl Kautsky, Materialistische Geschichtsauffaussung, Berlin: 1927, I, pp. 133-134; Serban Voinea, La Morale et le Socialisme, Gand: La Flamme, 1953, p. 301.)\n\nFor Marx (Capital, Book I, vol. II, part viii, chapter xxxi, Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1954, Vol. I, pp. 761 ff.; cf. Value, Price and Profit, VII, in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. 313-314), the historical and dialectical point of departure is small enterprise, with private ownership by the worker of his means of production. Then comes the negation (primitive capitalist accumulation dissolves this form of private property and replaces it with concentrated capitalist private property). Then finally, the negation of the negation (ownership by the worker of the means of collective production).\n\nFor Engels on the contrary (Anti-Düring, p. 151), the point of departure is common ownership of land; then comes the negation (transformation into private property); then the negation of the negation (returning to common property of a superior type).\n\nThe subsequent developments of Marxism have amply illustrated this inevitable arbitrariness of the Hegelian organon. The work of M. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Les aventures de la dialectique, Paris: Gallimard, 1955, is particularly suggestive from this point of view.\n\n2 Cf. Andrei Zhdanov, in his Speech to the Philosophers (on the subject of Professor Aleksandrov's History of Philosophy), Bolshevik, 16 (1947), pp. 7-23. In this address Zhadnov recalls that, according to the teaching of Lenin, dialectical materialism carries the party spirit with it, so to speak, obliging us in every evaluation of events to take directly and openly the point of view of a definite social group\". Paragraph 42, quoted in \"Andrei Zhdanov's Speech to the Philosophers: An Essay in Interpretation\", by J. and M. Miller, Soviet Studies, Vol. I, no. 1 (June, 1949), p. 45, note 8.\n\nInsisting more than Marx and Engels had done on the importance of ideology, and on showing in the \"philosophy of praxis\" \"the ideology of the revolutionary workers' [228]\n\nmovement\" (H. Chambre, op. cit., p. 45), it is not surprising that Lenin turned out at the same time to be the prophet of \"party spirit\". It is in this same perspective that a Marxist author of recognized authority could write: \"Every philosophy is a 'politics', and every philosopher is essentially a politician.\" A. Gramsci, Il materialismo storico e la filosofia di Benedetto Croce, Turin: Einaudi, 1949, p. 45, quoted by H. Chambre, op. cit., p. 44.\n\nOn the power of the Marxist method to captivate minds, once they agree to \"play the dialectical game\", see the searching remarks of Louis Gardet in \"L'homme Marxiste\", Nova et Vetera, Oct. - Dec., 1955, pp. 252-254.\n\n[229]\n\n1 Cf.

Maximilien Rubel, Pages choisies pour une Ethique Socialiste, pp. xxii-xxix). One then disregards Marx's faith in the rationality immanent in the movement of history. When Marx writes (Poverty of Philosophy, ed. C. P. Dutt and V. Chattopadhyaya, New York: International Publishers, s.d., p. 147): le combat ou la mort, la lutte sanguinaire ou le néant [232] we have indicated in the text, what the Hegelian dialectic reset upon its feet taught Marx is at once and by the same means the inevitability of the heroic engagement itself of the proletariat in combat, and the essential role of this willing engagement in the very inevitability of historical movement. In the absence of any philosophical affirmation of freedom of choice (liberum arbitrium) and of any philosophical doctrine of moral obligation, obviously no valid theoretical solution of the antinomy was possible. Understandably the solution for Marx was, and could be, only practical. From the Marxian point of view, as Maximilien Rubel correctly writes (Pages choisies . . ., p. xxxi), \"the solution of theoretical antinomies is indeed possible only in a practical manner\" and this is precisely what the theses on Feuerbach state, notably thesis III: \"The coincidence of the changing circumstances and of human activity or self-changing can only be comprehended and rationally understood as revolutionary practice.\" As an Appendix to The German Ideology, Parts I & III, p. 198 (cf. the translation in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. 1, p. 472).\n\n1 Maximilien Rubel, Pages choisies . . ., p. xliv.\n\n2 Cf. Georges Lukacs, op. cit., p. 235.\n\n3 Capital, Book I, vol. II, part viii, chapter xxxi, ed. cit., Vol. I, p. 751.\n\n[233]\n\n1 It is curious to note that, according to Wetter (op. cit., p. 327), the way in which Soviet philosophers explain the category of necessity (as opposed to the fortuitous) allows us to glimpse a certain appeal to finality.\n\n2 \"The Meaning of Contemporary Atheism\", in The Range of Reason, pp. 106-107.\n\n3 Ibid., p. 108.\n\n[234]\n\n1 \"The Meaning of Contemporary Atheism\", in The Range of Reason, p. 112.\n\n2 \"As proletarian, man becomes the produce of his own product, he is reduced to the state of a simple cog in the immense machine which is greater than he is, and whose overall workings Marx is determined to grasp. Capital produces itself, or rather reproduces itself and grows; it is Capital which determines men, which determines the conditions of reproduction, of the nourishment or life of men as a group. But a moment comes when this alienation becomes a living contradiction. This moment is the moment of the proletariat. In the proletariat, and especially in the general proletarianization of society, man is no longer anything but the inert product of his own product. Now according to Hegel, the consciousness of man is 'absolute elasticity'. It cannot reconcile itself to perceiving itself as a mere thing. Its final state of inertia is therefore the condition of its own resurgence. That is why human consciousness regrasps itself in the proletariat and in the proletarianized Society. This class consciousness is at the same time a human consciousness, a consciousness which becomes creative of a new order. Communism . . . is the active negation of its negation, capitalism, but this negation of the negation is authentically affirmative. It is the idea realized, man deified or true man, who grasps himself as the creator of his history and the one who makes it.\" Jean Hyppolite, \"Marxisme et Philosophie\", Revue Socialiste, November, 1946, pp. 548-549.\n\n[235]\n\n1 Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, p. 102.\n\nIt is on this dogmatic theme that the Marxist philosophy of history depends -- and it is this which keeps it from being an authentic philosophy of history. If contemporary Marxists had an authentically philosophical view of history they would understand that all the uproar and all the agitation concerning the advent of the communist revolution into the world in the second half of the twentieth century only proceeds in reality from an ideological fixation. In actual fact, their revolution is no longer ahead of them, it is behind them, it has already taken place -- in Russia. And having taken place at this point in the world, it has taken place for the world, just as, having taken place in France, the French Revolution has taken place not only for France but for the world. No doubt the communist revolution can be extended, as has happened in China, but this process of extension is necessarily limited by the resistance of the areas of noncommunist civilization whose reactions of self-preservation have been awakened. Under these conditions, the historical process which will really take place is that according to which the noncommunist peoples must henceforth assimilate, each according to its own spirit and its own structures, the effects, the recoils, and the general results of the revolution of 1917, while the communist peoples, on their side, must stabilize themselves and evolve new internal structures proper to themselves.\n\n2 Cf. G. V. Plekhanov, Les questions fondamentales du marxisme, Paris: Editions sociales, 1950, p. 83: \"In his Philosophy of Religion, Oeuvres Complètes, vol. xii, p. 98, Hegel says: 'Die Freiheit ist dies, nichts zu wollen als sich,' that is to say: Freedom consists in willing nothing other than oneself . . . It would be the same for the proletariat, which would transform the means of production into social property and organize social production on new bases: it would will nothing but itself. And it would feel itself completely free. . . .\" (Italics ours.)\n\n3 Cf. Georges Lukacs, op. cit., p. 183.\n\n4 \"Freedom is the appreciation of necessity.\" Engels, Anti-Dühring, p. 125. The saying is taken up by Lenin -- \"Karl Marx\" (1914), in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 26 -- and is classic in Marxist authors.\n\n5 Cf. above, p. 234, note 2. This \"deified man\", or \"true man\", is what Marx called whole man (\"Man appropriates his total essence in a total manner, that is to say, as a whole man.\" Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, p. 106) -- the \"supreme instance\", as H. Lefebvre says (Le matérialisme dialectique, Paris: P.U.F., p. 149), of communist humanism.\n\n6 And even his absolute Knowledge: for the Hegelian Sage, who moreover abandons his subjective individuality, \"consumed like a gnat\", through the intuition of the eternal, is only the point of convergence of the history of man and the whole of philosophy.\n\n[236]\n\n1 \"M. Proudhon does not know that all history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature.\" Marx, Poverty of Philosophy, p. 124.\n\nMarx will similarly write in Capital, that in acting on the external world and changing it, man at the same time changes his own nature.\n\n2 This does not keep the essence of man, from which man is now alienated and which he must reconquer in the end, from being an important part of the Marxist system. But this essence (the word still had a completely Hegelian signification for the young Marx) is not at all a synonym of human nature: indeed it is nothing other than freedom in the Hegelian sense, the autonomy which will be fully realized in true man or deified man. \"Freedom is the essence of man,\" wrote Marx in the Rheinische Zeitung in 1842. (\"Debatten uber Pressfreiheit und Publikation der Landstandischen Verhandlungen\" [Rheinische Zeitung , 12 (May, 1842), no. 132] in MEGA, I, 1/1, p. 202.\n\n3 Cf. The German Ideology, Parts I & III, pp. 7 ff.; Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, pp. 75-76. Some Marxist authors will speak, for example, of the three distinctive traits of man, which are articulated language, abstract thought, and the fabrication of tools (cf. A. Pannekoek, Marxismus und Darwinismus, Leipzig, 1914. Marx himself, in Capital (Book I, vol. I, part iii, chapter vii, ed. cit. Vol. I, p. 179), described man, following Franklin, as a tool-making animal). But these characteristics have only a purely empirical significance for them, and are not the properties of a nature in the philosophical sense of that word.\n\nLet us add that Marxism seems to be totally ignorant of the authentic concept of nature (as an intelligible object immutable in its specific characteristics but existing in time); he regularly confuses this concept with that of a thing absolutely immutable and existing above time (like a separated Platonic type, or like the Kantian \"thing in itself\") and which can neither evolve, transform itself, nor progress inside its specific limits, nor permit a substantial transformation as a result of which the specific nature of the descendants of an organism will be other than the specific nature of the organism itself, as happens according to the transformist view. In fact, when Marxist authors attack the notion of nature, they most often appear to do so in the name of a transformism whose philosophical import is childishly conceived.\n\n[237]\n\n1 I.e., Gattungswesen. Cf. Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, pp. 76, 105, 158 (and the German text in MEGA, I, 3, pp. 87, 88); \"Zur Judenfrage\" [Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbuch, August - November, 1843] in MEGA, I, 1/1, p. 584.\n\n2 Marx to Ruge, May, 1843, in MEGA, I, 1/1, p. 562.\n\n3 Cf.

Cf. Engels, Anti-Dühring, p. 310.\n\n5 \"The first act in which the State really comes forward as the representative of society as a whole -- the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society -- is at the same time its last independent act as a State. The interference of the State power in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production. The State is not 'abolished', it withers away.\" Engels, Anti-Dühring, p. 307. Cf. Engels, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 182; The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, New York: International Publishers, s.d., p. 158.\n\n6 Cf. our work Humanisme intégral, chapter 1 (\"La tragédie de l'humanisme\"), pp. 16-42.\n\n[239]\n\n1 \"The individual is the social being.\" Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, p. 104. Cf. ibid.: \". . . the human essence of nature first exists only for social man; for only here does nature exist for him as a bond with man. . . . Thus society is the consummated oneness in substance of men and nature -- the true resurrection of nature -- the naturalism of man and the humanism of nature both brought to fulfillment.\" Cf. also Theses on Feuerbach (thesis VI): \"In its reality it [the essence of man] is the ensemble (aggregate) of social relations.\" As an Appendix in The German Ideology, Parts I & III, p. 198.\n\n2 Manifesto of the Communist Party, in Marx, Selected Works , Vol. I, p. 228.\n\n3 Cf. our study La personne et le bien commun, Paris: Desclée de Brouwer, s.d. [1947] (English trans.: The Person and the Common Good, New York: Scribners, 1947; London: Bles, 1957).\n\n4 V.I. Lenin, \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, revised trans., New York: International Publishers, 1934, p. 33 (cf. Lenin, Selected Works, London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1947, Vol. II, p. 594). Marx had written in Capital (Book I, vol. II, part iv, chapter xv, section 9, ed. cit., Vol. I, pp. 487-488): \"Modern Industry, on the other hand, through its catastrophes imposes the necessity of recognizing, as a fundamental law of production, variation of work, consequently fitness of the labourer for varied work, consequently the [240]\n\ngreatest possible development of his varied aptitudes. It becomes a question of life and death for society to adapt the mode of production to the normal functioning of this law. Modern Industry, indeed, compels society, under penalty of death, to replace the detail-worker of today, crippled by life-long repetition of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to the mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the different social functions he performs, are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers.\" Cf. The German Ideology, Parts I & III, pp. 74-75; Engels, Anti-Dühring, p. 320.\n\n1 \"The Meaning of Contemporary Atheism\", in The Range of Reason, p. 107.\n\n2 Cf. above, pp. 218-219.\n\n3 \"The Meaning of Contemporary Atheism\", in The Range of Reason, p. 107.\n\n[241]\n\n1 It was simply as a stylistic device and as a pure concession to current ideas (see his letter to Engels, November 4, 1864, in Marx - Engels, Correspondence, 1846-1895, Letter no. 71, p. 162) that Marx employed the words moral and justice in the \"Address and Provisional Rules of the Working Men's International Association\", and in the Preamble to the statutes (in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. II, 432-445).\n\n2 Op. cit., especially pp. 183-186, 294-306. On p. 308 the author writes: \"Thus Marx's conception of communism, born, like that of Hess and that of Engels, of a feeling of moral reprobation toward social injustice, evolved from idealism toward materialism, passing from the philosophical and moral level on which Hess operated to the economic and social level. . . .\"\n\n3 Karl Popper, in The Open Society and Its Enemies (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1950; London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1952), pp. 385-388 and 392-397, insists with great force upon the essential role of this background of moral indignation in Marx, however deeply he repressed it owing to his aversion to idle phrases and moralism, and however incompatible it was with the pretension to pure \"objectivity\" of a materialist \"science\".\n\nMaximilien Rubel also recognizes in Marx the existence of \"powerful ethical motivations\". (Pages choisies . . ., p. xv.)\n\n[242]\n\n1 Engels, Preface to the German Edition of 1883, Manifesto of the Communist Party, in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 193.\n\n2 Manifesto of the Communist Party, ibid., p. 212.\n\n3 In his article on Engels, Lenin notes that \"Marx and Engels were democrats before becoming socialists, and their democratic feelings, which made them hate the arbitrary in politics, were extremely strong.\" (V. I. Lenin, \"Friedrich Engels\", in Karl Marx et sa doctrine, p. 48. -- Cf. the translation in Lenin, Marx - Engels - Marxism, 2nd English edition, Moscow: Co-operative Publishing Society of Foreign Workers in the U.S.S.R., 1937, p. 57.)

Wetter (op. cit., p. 237), is very significant from this point of view.\n\n2 \"Only the marriage based on love is moral. . .\" Engels, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, chapter II, New York: International Publishers, s.d., p. 73. \"If Marx had a horror of the moralising verbalism of doctrinaire socialists, if he avoided employing in his writings such words as 'justice', 'duty', 'morality', etc. . . . -- terms which Proudhon had constantly abused -- it remains none the less true that the most objective sequences of his thought are embellished with value-judgments under their diverse forms. . . .\" Maximilien Rubel, Pages choisies . . ., p. xxvii.

'One believes one is saying something great,' Hegel remarks, 'if one says that \"man is naturally good\". But one forgets that one says something far greater when one says \"man is naturally evil\".' According to Hegel, evil is the form in which the motive force of historical development presents itself. This, indeed, contains the twofold significance that while, on the one hand, each new advance necessarily appears as a sacrilege against things hallowed, as a rebellion against conditions which, however old and moribund, have still been sanctified by custom; on the other hand, it is precisely the wicked passions of man -- greed and lust for power -- which, since the emergence of class antagonisms, serve as levers of historical development -- a fact of which the history of feudalism and of the bourgeoisie, for example, constitutes a single continual proof. But it does not occur to Feuerbach to investigate the historical role of moral evil.\"\n\n[247]\n\n1 \"A really human morality which transcends class antagonisms and their legacies in thought becomes possible only at a stage of society which has not only overcome class contradictions but has even forgotten them in practical life.\" Anti-Dühring, p. 105.\n\n2 \"Voprosy Filosofii (Problems of Philosophy), 3 (1948)\", summarized by J. and M. Miller in Soviet Studies, Vol. I, no. 3 (January, 1950), p. 227, note 20.\n\n3 Roger Garaudy, Le communisme et la morale, Paris, 1945, p. 17.\n\n4 Serban Voinea, La morale et le socialisme, Gand: La Flamme, 1953.\n\n[248]\n\n1 Humanisme intégral, pp. 61-62. A certain confirmation of these views is to be found in the rehabilitation of \"ideology\" accomplished by Lenin, and in the restitution of moral concepts (recast in dependency on the absolute primacy of the social) which is taking place in Soviet Russia. Although the realization of communism in Soviet society remains extremely far from the full realization promised to the human race by Marxism, what we have there is nevertheless a \"third phase\", which \"corresponds to the victory of socialism in the U.S.S.R. It is that phase in which the conscience of Soviet men is radically modified, in such a way that 'communist morality has become the morality of the whole Soviet society' [V. N. Kolbanovski, O Kommunisticeskoj morali, p. 109].\" (H. Chambre, op. cit., p. 267.)\n\n[249]\n\n1 \"Marxist ethics [has] objective and rigorous norms and principles derived from a scientific understanding of society\", and \"ethical relativism was important in the thought of Rosenberg and Goebbels\", wrote H. Shiskin in the Soviet periodical Voprosy Filosofii (cited by J. and M. Miller in Soviet Studies, Vol. I, no. 3 (Jan. 1950), p. 227). \"Communist morality is just, because scientific, that is to say, founded on Marxism. It excludes all 'subjective relativism'.\" H. Chambre, op. cit., p. 268 (summarizing G. M. Gak, Voprosy etiki v marksistiko-leninskoj morali). \"In the sphere of morality, there is no duality of truth\" writes Mr. Gak.\n\n2 \"L'oggetto del materialismo dialettico coincide perciò con l'oggetto delle singole scienze positive. La differenza consiste in ciò: che la dialettica materialistica (cioè la filosofia), si occupa di quest' oggetto in un senso molto piu universale . . .\n\n\"La dialettica materialistica ha un duplice oggetto: le leggi universalissime del pensiero umano e, nello stesso tempo, le leggi universalissime della realtà . . .\n\n\"Il materialismo dialettico è l'unità della logica, della dialettica e della teoria della conoscenza. Principio che fu già definito da Lenin 'della rnassima importanza'.\" G. Wetter, op. cit., pp. 234-236. These pages on philosophy and the positive sciences in the Soviet conception of philosophy are of major importance.\n\n3 The way in which Marxist philosophy understands the notion of essence is very significant in this perspective. \"Essence\" does not belong to a different order from \"phenomenon\", is, indeed, identical with it, being nothing other than the connection and internal necessity, expressed through the laws of science and those of dialectic, among phenomena, which, as simple empirical data and before being treated by science, are characterized as external, apparent, and fortuitous. Cf. G. Wetter, op. cit., pp. 302-306 on the categories Essence and Phenomenon.\n\n[250]\n\n1 Cf. below, chapter XI, pp. 287-289 and p. 288 note 1. Let us add that every truth, from the instant it is true, is eternal in a sense, even if it bears upon a temporary event or state. \"Robespierre will be overthrown tomorrow\" is a proposition which was true one day, but which has ceased to be true. But once the event has occurred, it will remain eternally true that Robespierre was overthrown on the 9th Thermidor, in the year 11.\n\n2 V. I.

It is likewise the division of labor which is responsible for the concentration of artistic talent in certain ones only, and of \"the subordination of the individual to a given art so that he is exclusively a painter, a sculptor, etc. . . . In a communist organization of society there are no painters; at most there are people who, among other things, also paint.\" Marx - Engels, Literature and Art, New York: International Publishers, 1947, p. 76 (from Deutsche Ideologie. Das Leipziger Konzil, III, Sankt Max, in MEGA, I, 5, p. 373).\n\n2 Capital, Book III, part vii, chapter xlvii, trans. E. Untermann, Chicago: Charles H. Kerr & Co., 1907, Vol. III, p. 954.\n\nOn the level of work imposed by need and external necessity \"freedom in this field cannot consist of anything else but of the fact that socialized man, the associated producers, regulate their interchange with nature rationally, bring it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by some blind power; that they accomplish their task with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most adequate to their human nature and most worthy of it. But it always remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human power, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can flourish upon that realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working day is its fundamental premise.\" Ibid., pp. 954-955. To this fundamental condition another is added in the communist society of Marxian utopia, namely, the interchangeability of functions in such a way that \"nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity\", and that the basis constituted by the realm of necessity is reduced to the fact that \"society regulates the general production\".

Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, p. 76: \"It is just in the working up of the objective world, therefore, that man first really proves himself to be a species-being. This production is his active species life. Through and because of the production, nature appears as his work and his reality. The object of labour is, therefore, the objectification of man's species life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he contemplates himself in a world that he has created.\" (From MEGA, I, 3, pp. 88-89.)\n\n10 Deutsch Ideologie.

Yudin, article on \"Ethics\", Handbook of Philosophy, p. 41.\n\n2 Cf. above, p. 249, note 1.\n\n3 After having quoted this assertion from P. Kolonickil, Kommunisticeskaja i moral' religioznaja (Moscow, 1952), p. 18: \"Everything that serves the cause of the people, the interests of the liberation of the workers, and the building of a classless communist society is absolutely moral,\" Father Henri Chambre writes: \"Let us underline this adverb bezuslovno: absolutely, without reserve. It is repeated in the next sentence, which tells us what is 'absolutely immoral'.\" (Op. cit., pp. 280-281.)\n\n4 Cf. above, p. 250.\n\n5 Cf. above, p. 247.\n\n6 Is such an ethical conception in incipient contradiction with Marxist morality as Engels characterized it in Anti-Duhring, as Father Chambre (op. cit., p. 282) maintains? We do not think so. Engels rejects all \"eternal, ultimate and forever immutable moral law\" (Anti-Duhring, pp. 104-105), but that does not mean at all that he rejects the unconditional character of the commandment prescribed for the individual at a given moment of development by class morality, and therefore the absolutely immoral character of the act in disaccord with this commandment.\n\n[255]\n\n1 Cf. above, p. 233.\n\n2 Concerning this point, see the penetrating remarks of Father Henri Chambre, op. cit., pp. 269-281.\n\n3 In connection with another subject (the Soviet theory of Law), Father Chambre, citing these lines from Hauriou: \"An established social order in practice always contains a certain amount of justice which is incorporated in it\", adds: \"The amount of justice incorporated in the Soviet order comes not from Marxist ideology but from the voice of natural law which subsists in the depths of the Russian human conscience in spite of every effort to destroy it.\" (Op. cit., p. 241.)\n\n3 Cf. above, p. 250, notes 2 and 3.\n\n[256]\n\n1 Galvano della Volpe, \"Originalita dell'Umanismo socialista\", in Studi filosofici, fasc. 1 (1948).\n\nOne might ask oneself if the repudiation of Stalin to which the Soviet government proceeded after the dictator's death will not have repercussions in the moral realm and is not the symptom of a significant evolution in Soviet ethics. This historical condemnation of Stalin does as a matter of fact very definitely involve questions of the crimes and injustices of which his regime was guilty, and these words seem to be employed in the sense in which they are normally understood by those who believe in absolute and universal moral values. Is this a sign that in spite of everything a rehabilitation of these values is going to occur, in keeping with the fact (pointed out above, p. 248, note 1) that the morality taught in the name of the Communist Party must henceforth, in Soviet Russia, be addressed not simply to the militant members of the proletariat in their class struggle, but to all the members of Soviet society? It is difficult to imagine that, under such circumstances, this morality would not tend to pass from the state of class morality to that of simple morality, or \"human morality\".\n\n2 Hence the \"absolutely moral\" or \"absolutely immoral\" acts which were spoken of above, p. 254, note 3.\n\n[257]\n\n1 Nicolas Berdyaev, The Realm of Spirit and the Realm of Caesar, chapter V, trans.

Lowrie, New York: Harper & Bros., 1952, p. 89; London: Gollancz, 1952.\n\n2 \"The only sense in which it is possible to show that something is good or bad, right or wrong, is by demonstrating that it accords or disaccords with the historical process, assists it or thwarts it, will survive or will inevitably perish.\" Isaiah Berlin, Karl Marx, 2nd ed., London: O.U.P., 1948, p. 140.\n\n[258]\n\n1 It is indeed significant that despite the hopes which he had put for a time in the Communist League, then in the Workers' International, the \"party\" in the name of which Marx spoke was in his eyes not a party in the ordinary sense of the wotd but a kind of invisible church whose self-constituted prophets were Engels and himself (cf. Maximilien Rubel, Pages choisies . . ., pp. xl-xliv).\n\n\"I am not a 'Realpolitiker',\" Marx indignantly wrote against the agreement which Lassalle tried to conclude with Bismarck (Marx to Kügelmann, February 23, 1865, in Marx - Engels, Correspondence, 1846-1895, Letter no. 81, p. 197). \"The honour of the workers' party demands that it should reject fancy pictures of this kind even before their hollowness is exposed by experience.\" Marx to J. B. Schweitzer, February 13, 1865, as cited by Marx in his letter to Engels, February 18, 1865, Ibid., Letter no. 80, p. 190.\n\n2 Cf. Georges Lukacs, op. cit., pp. 211-212.\n\n3 Ibid., p. 211.\n\n4 Ibid., p.212.\n\n[259]\n\n1 Cf. Georges Lukacs, op. cit., p. 213.\n\n2 Ibid., p. 214.\n\n3 \"The Marxist criterion of morality is the conformity of morality with the actual phase of development of the society in question.\" Chambre, op. cit., p. 268. \"The supreme criterion of communist morality is the struggle for communism.\" V. Prokof'ev, Dve morali, Moral' religioznaja i moral' Kommunisticeskaja (Moscow, 1953), cited by Chambre, op. cit., p. 280. All of these formulae are equivalents.\n\n4 Once the end is attained, there will still be history (cf. above, p. 218), but will there still be dialectic? Must it be said that since all opposition will have disappeared, that will be \"the death of the dialectic\" (cf. Chambre, op. cit., pp. 284, 508)? We think not. For though all opposition should have disappeared as among humans, still opposition, and therefore dialectic, could still reappear under other forms, as between humanity and nature, for example (particularly in view of the fact that nature carries with it the necessity of death).\n\n5 Cf. A. Cornu, op. cit., p. 405 (on the doctrine of Marx): \"In spite of its objective appearance, his doctrine is actually penetrated with finality; one feels in him as in Hegel a mystical faith which leads him to bend the fact towards the end which he assigns to them, and, though he likes to proclaim with Hegel that the march of history is an inevitable march, it is because he knows that this necessity constrains the fact to realize an ideal which is his own.\" (Italics ours.)\n\n[260]\n\n1 Cf. G. Wetter, op. cit., pp. 324-328. (But see also, in the same work, the remarks on page 327 concerning the element of finality which in spite of everything slips into the idea of the category of necessity as formulated by Soviet authors.)\n\n2 Cf. above, chapter IX, p. 206.\n\n3 Cf. above, chapter IX, pp. 206-207."
