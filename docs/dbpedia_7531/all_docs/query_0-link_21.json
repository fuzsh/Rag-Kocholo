        "text": "Friends, today on the “Word on Fire Show,” we kick off a new series of discussions called “Understanding the Present Moment.” Brandon Vogt and I will look at four massively influential figures who together help explain our present moment, how we arrived at where we are today.\n\nThe ideologies undergirding much of the unrest in our culture stem from these four thinkers: Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Foucault. Once we understand these figures and their key ideas, we will recognize them everywhere and be prepared to engage today’s challenges. In today’s first discussion, we focus on Karl Marx.\n\nA listener asks, what advice would you give to a man discerning the permanent diaconate?\n\nLinks\n\nRedeeming the Time: Gospel Perspectives on the Challenges of the Hour by Bishop Robert Barron"
