        "text": "15 Karl Marx and Scientific Socialism\n\nDr. Ritu Khosla\n\n1.1 Life and Work 1.2 Source of Marx’s Thought 1.3 The Character of Marxian Socialism 1.3a Dialectical Materialism 1.3b Historical Materialism or Materialistic Interpretation of History 1.3c Theory of Class war/ Class struggle 1.3d Theory of Value and Surplus Value 1.3e Theory of State and Revolution 1.4 Conclusion 1.5 Exercise to Do 1.6 References\n\nIn the Communist Manifesto, Marx proclaimed the democratic aim of a proletariat revolution. As per Manifesto, “The first step in the working class revolution is the raising of the proletariat to the position of the ruling class; the victory of democracy…..The proletarian movement is the\n\nconscious movement of the immense majority in the interest of the immense majority.”\n\nMarx talked about development of revolution two in phases. In the first phase, the bourgeoisie would undertake a struggle with feudalists. In this struggle the proletariat would lend their support to the bourgeoisie and later search for an opportunity to seize power from bourgeoisie. In the second phase of the revolution, the bourgeoisie that initially crushed feudalism would be destroyed by the proletariat with the help of left wing bourgeoisie components and these bourgeoisie elements would be later on rejected by the proletariat. After the throw away of the bourgeois state, the proletariat would still need the state. It will be a transitional, revolutionary stage in which the state will be dominated by the proletariat. The proletariat would strive to bring all means of production; industries, land, business, communications, transportation and commerce under the influence of state. The proletariat state would have a system of heavy and progressive income tax with elimination of child labour in factories, and provision of free education for all children in public schools. Marx believed that the ‘Dictatorship of Proletariat’ will be more democratic and liberal than the bourgeois democracy\n\nThe proletariats would later crush the opposing forces leading to the establishment of communistic society. Both Marx and Engels believe that following the proletarian rule, the state will wither away automatically with the extinction of all classes. The abolition of classes implies the abolition of the state, and in a society where there is no classes, there can be no state.\n\nIn the then formed communist society, everyone will work. However, the initial division of labour will disappear. The newly formed society will become a means to emancipation of men ‘by giving each individual the opportunity to develop and exercise all his faculties, physical and mental, in all directions, in which, therefore, productive force will become a pleasure instead of a burden. The new society will be based on the principle, “from each according to his capacity and, to each according to his needs.”\n\n1.4 Conclusion\n\nThe writings of Karl Marx moved around the questions of historical and economic theory and around the issues of economic and political strategies. He collected the philosophical material lying scattered and combined then to a systematic whole. His teachings became more or less a religion for millions of his followers. He combined his ideas with scientific aspects in order to generate weapons through which oppressed could fight against the oppressor. His ultimate focus, however, was in liberated and cultivated individuals. He believed that fairer and more productive economic arrangements are required so that every individual gets the time and opportunity for ‘free development, intellectual and social.’ Paying tribute to Marx Prof Laski writes, “The vital fact about him (Marx) is that he found communism a chaos and left it a movement. Through him it acquired a philosophy and a direction.”\n\nyou can view video on Karl Marx and Scientific Socialism\n\nReferences"
