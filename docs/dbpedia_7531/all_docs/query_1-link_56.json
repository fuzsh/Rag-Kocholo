        "text": "Living in London as a political exile, Karl Marx was heavily though not uncritically influenced by Ricardoâ€™s theories as he developed his own economic theory working in the Reading Room of the nearby British Museum.\n\nMarx lived for a time after arriving in London in 1849 at 4 Anderson St, Chelsea, before moving briefly to a German hotel in Leicester St, off Leicester Square, and then to lodgings at 28 Dean Street, Soho, which are marked by a blue plaque. In 1856 the family moved on to 9 Grafton Terrace in Kentish Town, in 1864 to 1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park and then in 1875 to 41 Maitland Park Road, Hampstead where he later died. The Reading Room where he worked (at seat G7) can be found in the atrium of the British Museum, within walking distance of UCL. An impressive monument can be found at his gravesite in Highgate Cemetery."
