        "text": "Grazia Deledda (born Sept. 27, 1871, Nuoro, Sardinia, Italy—died Aug. 15, 1936, Rome) was a novelist who was influenced by the verismo (q.v.; “realism”) school in Italian literature. She was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1926.\n\nDeledda married very young and moved to Rome, where she lived quietly, frequently visiting her native Sardinia. With little formal schooling, at age 17 Deledda wrote her first stories, based on sentimental treatment of folklore themes. With Il vecchio della montagna (1900; “The Old Man of the Mountain”) she began to write about the tragic effects of temptation and sin among primitive human beings."
