The essay discusses the persistent assumption whereby Serao’s novel Mors tua (1926) was the reason she “lost” the Nobel Prize to Grazia Deledda in 1927. Based on analysis of nomination letters and written reports in the Academy’s archive in Stockholm, the article also disputes the claims that Mussolini had something to do with Serao’s possible Nobel Prize.",
