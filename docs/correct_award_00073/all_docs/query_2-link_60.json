        "text": "Ashraf Siddiqui\n\nDoha\n\nThe Italian community in Qatar paid tributes to Grazia Deledda, the Italian Nobel Prize winner on literature, at the iconic Qatar National Library, a part of Qatar Foundation (QF).\n\nCelebrating the 150th anniversary of the Nobel laureate, the event was organised by Qatar National Library (QNL) in collaboration with Province of Nuoro and Qatar-based Obiettivo LLC.\n\nGrazia Deledda received her Nobel Prize for literature in the year 1926 for her inspiring writings on the life of her native island Nuoro, a province in Sardinia.\n\nLaura Bertuccioli, CEO of Obiettivo LLC, welcomed the guests and briefed them about the works of the revolutionary writer Grazia Deledda (September 1871-August 1936).\n\nThose present on the occasion included officials of QNL; Costantino Tidu, extraordinary administrator of the Province of Nuoro; Alessandro Aramu, journalist and writer; Valeria Pecora, essayist, journalist and writer; Artist Gavino Murgia and guests.\n\nTalking about the importance of cultural exchange, Laura Bertuccioli said she was honoured to have been a part of this wonderful event, celebrating a remarkable woman and author from her home country Italy.\n\nShe said that the celebration of different cultures is what brings people closer together and was happy to see a large participation of the local audience.\n\nThe anniversary celebrations saw events organised across the globe, including in Athens, Brussels and New York, and culminating in grand finale in Qatar.\n\nCommenting on the event Alessandro Aramu, Italian journalist and organiser of the year-long celebrations, said: “Today’s event in Qatar is the last in the rich programme of initiatives that has lasted over a year. It was a unique project that paid attention to every aspect of an outstanding author who had the undoubted merit of turning the world spotlight on Sardinia, thanks to unforgettable texts with strong emotional impact.”\n\nTalking to Qatar Tribune, Aramu said that the venue and timings of the event were selected thoughtfully as the whole world is watching FIFA World Cup in Qatar, adding that it was right time to project the great works of the Italian laurate.\n\nHe condemned all the negative propaganda against Qatar from certain quarters in the West.\n\nHe applauded whole arrangements for the World Cup, describing Qatar as a very clean country, with friendly and welcoming smiling local people.\n\n“This is my first visit to Qatar. It is an amazing country with iconic structures like of Qatar National Library,” he said.\n\nRenowned Italian author Valeria Pecora delved into Deledda’s work and highlighted her influence on Italian and international literature, discussing her literary style and analysing some meaningful excerpts in Italian and English.Pecora outlined parallelisms between Deledda and Arabian authors.\n\nTalking about the Deledda’s importance, Pecora said, “Grazia Deledda is the best-known Sardinian writer in the world. This tenacious and passionate writer allowed millions of readers to get to know Sardinia and especially Nuoro, her hometown and the places she described and loved deeply”.\n\nThe audience had the opportunity to experience the Sardinian’s culture beautifully described in Deledda’s works, through some of the island’s typical food and traditional clothing.\n\nMusic also played an important role during the event, with musician and researcher Gavino Murgia transporting the audience to a different time with a performance of traditional instruments and ancient sounds, an important part of Sardinian’s culture.\n\nA book on the inspiring works of ‘Grazia Deledda’ written by Dino Manca was donated to the Qatar National Library, inviting the local public to learn more about the Italian Nobel Laurate."
