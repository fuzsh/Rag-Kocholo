        "text": "Women who have won the Nobel prize for Literature\n\nCanadian author Alice Munro, renowned for her short stories, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature this year, marking it the 13th time in history that a woman has been given the award. Here's a breakdown of the other women who have won the prestigious award.\n\nHerta Muller, 2009:\n\nThe German-Romania writer is known for her poetic style of writing, often entrenched in social themes about her native Romania. Muller first broke through in 1982, with a collection of short stories called Niederungen (Nadirs) which was censored because of its autobiographical portrayal of the oppressive lifestyle in the Romanian countryside.\n\nMost famous work: Atemschaukel (The Hunger Angel) – the 2009 poetic novel told the story of a young man named Leo Auberg who is deported to a forced labor concentration camp in Ukraine.\n\nDoris Lessing, 2007\n\nThe English author (now 93) is the oldest person to win the Nobel Prize in Literature – but better late than never. Lessing broke out with her 1950 novel, The Grass Is Singing, about race relations in Zimbabwe (where she was mostly raised). Her work is mostly centered around political and feminist issues.\n\nMost famous work: The Golden Notebook – the 1962 novel about a woman keeping a record of her life in journals contained strong feminist and anti-Stalinist themes.\n\nElfriede Jelinek, 2004\n\nThe Austrian novelist and playwright was set to become a musician before discovering her passion for literature. Her debut collection, Lisas Schatten (Lisa's Shadow) in 1967, was well-received and set her on a path to literary fame. Jelinek's work is usually focused on female sexuality and is often considered controversial.\n\nMost famous work: The Piano Teacher – the 1983 novel is about a piano teacher who gets in a sadomasochistic relationship with her student.\n\nWislawa Szymborska, 1996\n\nThe Nobel committee described the late Polish writer as the \"Mozart of poetry.\" Szymborska often wrote on themes of war and terror, written in her humorous and ironic writing style. Her first published poem was 1945's I Am Looking for a Word.\n\nMost famous work: Dwukropek – the 2006 collection, the writer's last, was chosen the best book of 2006 in Poland.\n\nToni Morrison, 1993\n\nAmerican author Toni Morrison blends epic, poetic styling with plots that mainly center around African-Americans. Morrison's first book was 1970's The Bluest Eye, about a young black girl who wishes to have blue eyes.\n\nMost famous work: Beloved – the 1987 story about a tortured African-American woman named Sethe won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was turned into a film starring Oprah Winfrey.\n\nNadine Gordimer, 1991\n\nAlfred Nobel called Gordimer's work a \"great benefit to humanity.\" The South African-born writer focuses the bulk of her work on racial issues, such as apartheid in her native country. She gained an audience after her story A Watcher of the Dead was published in The New Yorker in 1951.\n\nMost famous work:The Conservationist – the 1974 novel about an rich white antihero living in South Africa was a joint winner of the Man Booker Prize for fiction.\n\nNelly Sachs, 1966\n\nThe German-born, Swedish-bred poet and playwright focused most of her work on Jewish grief after the Nazis came into power. She was known for her lyrical style of writing.\n\nMost famous work: Eli: A Mystery Play of the Sufferings of Israel – the 1943 play was the first Holocaust drama ever written.\n\nGabriela Mistral, 1945\n\nThe Chilean poet is the only Latin American woman to have won the Nobel prize. Mistral's poetic themes revolved mainly around Latin American identity and were written in a powerfully emotional and idealistic style, according to the Nobel committee.\n\nMost famous work: Desolacion (Despair) – the 1922 collection of poems was critically acclaimed.\n\nPearl Buck, 1938\n\nThe American-born writer spent most of her childhood in China, where most of her work is set. Buck was a prolific writer, penning more than 30 novels, plus biographies, autobiographies, non-fiction books and short story collections.\n\nMost famous work:The Good Earth – the 1931 dramatic novel about village life in China won the Pulitzer Prize for the novel and was a best seller.\n\nSigrid Undset, 1928\n\nThe Norwegian writer was experimental, occasionally writing in a stream of consciousness. Early on in her career, she became extremely interested in Medieval times and wrote many historical novels.\n\nMost famous work: Kristin Lavransdatter – the 1920 historical trilogy follows the story of a woman living in the 14th century. The trilogy was essentially the basis for Undset winning the Nobel prize.\n\nGrazia Deledda, 1926\n\nBorn in Sardinia, the Italian writer based most of her work on the people of her birthplace, focusing on themes of love, sin and family. She was the first Italian woman to win the prize.\n\nMost famous work: La Madre – the 1920 novel told the story of a Sardinian mother, whose son falls in love with a beautiful widow.\n\nSelma Lagerlof, 1909\n\nThe Swedish-born writer was the first woman to win the award. The Nobel committee described her work as lofty, vivid and spiritual, mostly known for her children's books."
