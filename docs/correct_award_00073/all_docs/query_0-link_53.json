Nobel Prize winner in 1926\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 620525\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library 2015 - https://copyrighthub.org/s0/hub1/creation/maryevans/MaryEvansPictureID/10073555\n\n1875 Best Nobel Peasantry Prize Sardinian Shawl Stories Winner 1926 1936 Grazia\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis evocative photograph captures the noble and introspective gaze of Grazia Deledda, the esteemed Italian writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1926. Born in 1875 in Nuoro, Sardinia, Deledda is best known for her poignant and authentic portrayals of Sardinian peasantry and rural life. In this image, Deledda is seen sitting at a table, dressed in a traditional Sardinian shawl, her long, grey hair cascading down her shoulders. She is deeply engrossed in a book, her expression one of quiet concentration and dedication. Deledda's literary career spanned over five decades, from the late 19th century to the 1930s. Her works, which often explored the themes of love, loss, and the human condition, were deeply rooted in the history and culture of her native Sardinia. Her most famous novels include \"Canne al vento\" (Reeds in the Wind), \"La sonnambula\" (The Sleepwalker), and \"Ecco la luna\" (Behold the Moon). Deledda's Nobel Prize win in 1926 marked a significant achievement for Italian literature and for women writers in particular. She was the first Italian woman, and the fourth woman overall, to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. Her legacy continues to inspire and captivate readers around the world, and her works remain an important part of Italian literary history.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
