        "text": "The childhood home of the Sardinian writer Grazia Deledda (awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1926) in Nuoro has been converted into a detailed museum that's worth a visit.\n\nOur visit to the Grazia Deledda Museum was rather by coincidence. We were on a bus visiting other sights in the area and as we were a bit ahead of schedule, they offered to make a stop so we could visit the museum. The group we were traveling with, about 20 in total, agreed and we paid a visit. We asked the driver if it was normal to stop at places off the established route and he said that, while not officially allowed, he liked to show people the special places of his native land.\n\nThis House-Museum in Nuoro took us back in time and helped us learn a bit more about the writer Grazia Deledda, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1926. The distribution of the furniture, the maintenance of the home, and the guided visit all helped create a really worthwhile experience. If you're unfamiliar with the works of the author, you'll want to read her entire collection after visiting this museum! Her books, by the way, are an excellent way to get a better understanding of Sardinian life before your visit. Oh, and there's a surprise during the visit. If you want to know what it is, well, you'll"
