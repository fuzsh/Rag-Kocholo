        "text": "Sardinia’s winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Find out more about Grazia Deledda and her island of Sardinia in my feature for Discover Sardinia magazine.\n\nDH Lawrence wrote the foreword to one of Deledda’s books in translation. ‘It is this old Sardinia, at last being brought to heel, which is the real theme of Grazia Deledda’s books. She is fascinated by her island and its folks, more than by the problems of the human psyche.’"
