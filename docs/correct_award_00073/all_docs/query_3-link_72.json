        "text": "Thursday 8 July, 6pm\n\nReadings by Antonella Anedda and discussion with Adele Bardazzi and Roberto Binetti.\n\nPlease note this event will be in Italian.\n\nThe Sardinian writer Grazia Deledda (1871 -1936) is the only Italian female writer to have ever been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. During this online event, the poet Antonella Anedda will read from her recently curated anthology, Come solitudine: storie e novelle da un’isola (Donzelli Editore) — a collection of some of Grazia Deledda’s best short stories, carefully chosen by Anedda with a particular focus on the ones set in Sardinia.\n\nJoining Anedda will be Adele Bardazzi (The Queen’s College, University of Oxford) and Roberto Binetti (St Anne’s College, University of Oxford) who will talk about Deledda’s work and will discuss the importance of Sardinia and its traditions in relation to her writing. They will also touch on some contemporary works by the likes of Antonella Anedda herself, and Maria Lai, among others.\n\nAdele Bardazzi is Extraordinary Junior Research Fellow in Italian at the University of Oxford , and she has been an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy since 2016. Her research focuses on modern and contemporary poetry, with a series of cross-disciplinary, comparative, and gender-orientated foci. In particular, her scholarship focuses on lyric poetry (with an emphasis on elegy), discourses of mourning and loss, and the cross-fertilisation between the verbal and the visual. Her first monograph, resulting from her doctoral thesis on Eugenio Montale, is currently under review by Peter Lang and another project on lyric poetry, the co-edited volume A Gaping Wound: Mourning in Italian Poetry, with Dr Francesco Giusti and Professor Emanuela Tandello, is forthcoming with Legenda in 2022.\n\nRoberto Binetti is a PhD student in Medieval and Modern Languages at the University of Oxford, where he works on a project on contemporary Italian women’s poetry and the reception of Gilles Deleuze’s thought. He is also Graduate Development Scholar and Tutor in Italian at St Anne’s College, where he teaches modules on Italian literature from its origins to the present day. His doctoral project, titled ‘Voices from a Minor Literature’, focuses on Italian women’s poetry in the 1970s and aims at reassessing this literary phenomenon in the light of its stylistic originality and problematic relationship with contemporary history. His research interests include the interaction of poetry with other ‘systems of meaning’ such as psychoanalysis, cultural history, ecology and ecocriticism.\n\nAntonella Anedda was born and lives in Rome and she is one of Italy’s most celebrated contemporary poets. She has published several volumes of poetry, including the award-winning Notti di pace occidentale (Donzelli 1999, premio Montale) and Salva con nome (Mondadori 2012, premio Viareggio-Rèpaci). Her work Isolatria: Viaggio nell’arcipelago della Maddalena (Laterza 2013), is a geographical and historical overview of La Maddalena, her family’s native region of Sardinia. Anedda has also worked as a journalist and in addition to being a an author she is a scholar, teacher and translator. Anglophone readers can find a selection of her poetry, translated by Jamie McKendrick’s, in the volume Archipelago (2014)."
