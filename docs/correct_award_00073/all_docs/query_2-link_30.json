        "text": "(1871–1936). Italian novelist Grazia Deledda was a major writer in the Italian verismo (“realism”) school, which sought to present life using direct, unadorned language, clear descriptive detail, and realistic dialogue. In her more than 40 novels, she often used Sardinia’s landscape as a metaphor for the difficulties in her characters’ lives. The ancient ways of Sardinia often conflict with modern values, and her characters are forced to work out solutions to their moral issues. Deledda was awarded the Nobel prize for Literature in 1926.\n\nDeledda was born on Sept. 27, 1871, in Nuoro, Sardinia, Italy. She married at a young age and moved to Rome, where she lived quietly, frequently visiting her native Sardinia. With little formal schooling, Deledda at age 17 wrote her first stories, based on sentimental treatment of folklore themes. With Il vecchio della montagna (1900; “The Old Man of the Mountain”) she began to write about the tragic effects of temptation and sin among primitive human beings.\n\nAmong Deledda’s most notable works are Dopo il divorzio (1902; After the Divorce); Elias Portolu (1903), the story of a mystical former convict in love with his brother’s bride; Cenere (1904; Ashes; film, 1916, starring Eleonora Duse), in which an illegitimate son causes his mother’s suicide; and La madre (1920; The Mother), the tragedy of a mother who realizes her dream of her son’s becoming a priest only to see him yield to his sexual impulses. Deledda died on Aug. 15, 1936, in Rome. Cosima, an autobiographical novel, was published posthumously in 1937."
