        "text": "Cosima by Grazia Deledda. 1988 Ithaca Press, second printing, 140 pages. Deledda was from Sardinia and wrote about small simple life on the island. According to the Paris Review, \"While she was not associated with the Italian feminist movement, the actions of her female characters suggest she considered marginalization to be heartbreaking, but not without certain liberties.\" Deledda won the Nobel Prize in 1926, the first Italian woman to do so. Cosima is an autobiographical novel about an aspiring writer and was published posthumously, per Deledda's intention.\n\nCondition: Good used copy, writing on last end paper.\n\n\"As it happens, it was a girl; but she wanted a little brother and had invented him, name and all.\""
