        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Literature 1926 was awarded to Grazia Deledda \"for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general\"\n\nGrazia Deledda received her Nobel Prize one year later, in 1927. During the selection process in 1926, the Nobel Committee for Literature decided that none of the year's nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel. According to the Nobel Foundation's statutes, the Nobel Prize can in such a case be reserved until the following year, and this statute was then applied. Grazia Deledda therefore received her Nobel Prize for 1926 one year later, in 1927.\n\nTo cite this section\n\nMLA style: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1926. NobelPrize.org.
