The birthplace of writer Grazia Deledda, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1926, dates back to the second half of the 19th century and is located in San Pietro, part of the oldest part of the town. It is a dwelling of the well-to-do in the Nuoro area, with three floors and inner courtyards on the first. Deledda lived there until her marriage in 1900 and was declared a national monument in 1968. The municipality of Nuoro then sold it to the Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico in 1979 for a token fee. ISRE immediately worked to turn it into a museum dedicated to the writer. Thanks to the generosity of the Madesani-Deledda family, a large number of manuscripts, photographs, documents and personal items were brought from Rome to Nuoro. In 2006, the collection was enhanced with numerous important documents. The aim is to offer visitors a journey through time, society and the places of the woman who, through her writing, made the culture and emotions of Barbagia, and the whole of Sardinia famous throughout the world.
