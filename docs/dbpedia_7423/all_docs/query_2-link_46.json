Note: Wi-Fi must be enabled to change most of the Wi-Fi settings described in this document. Attempting to change such settings while the Wi-Fi radio is disabled will return an error in the Result XML. Zebra recommends beginning any profile created to change Wi-Fi settings with a command to Enable the Wi-Fi radio.\n\nCAUTION: Some Wi-Fi parameters vary from conventions used by other CSPs:\n\nThe \"Enable\" and \"Disable\" settings in the Wi-Fi CSP control whether a user or administrator can \"turn on\" and \"turn off\" a feature or capability, or to set its state as \"active\" or \"inactive.\" Such terms in other CSPs refer to the feature's \"Usage\" setting, which can prevent access to the feature entirely.\n\nThe value \"0\" is used in Wi-Fi parameters to \"Disable\" a feature, select its default setting or \"make no change\" or \"do nothing\" to a setting. In most other CSPs, the \"0\" value is used to select the \"make no change\" option.\n\nParm Name: WiFiAction\n\nOption Name Description Note Status Requires 0 Do not change This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) causes no change to Wi-Fi settings; any previously selected setting is retained.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n1 Enable Turns the Wi-Fi radio On.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n2 Disable Turns the Wi-Fi radio Off.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nWi-Fi Sleep Policy\n\nUsed to select the state of the Wi-Fi radio when the device enters sleep mode. When Wi-Fi remains enabled during sleep, existing Wi-Fi connections are maintained as during normal operations. While preferrable for some situations, this mode can significantly reduce battery life.\n\nAndroid devices by default enter sleep mode after being idle for a specified period of time. While in this mode, apps run in a lower-power state.\n\nNote: This parameter cannot be configured in devices running Android 8.x and higher; Oreo locks the Wi-Fi radio into the \"AlwaysOn\" setting.\n\nParm Name: WifiSleepPolicy\n\nOption Name Description Note Status Requires 4 Do not change This (null) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) causes no change to the current sleep policy on the device; any previously selected setting is retained.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n0 AlwaysOn Causes the Wi-Fi radio to remain enabled when the device goes to sleep, providing running apps with uninterrupted access to Wi-Fi (NOTE- This is the permanent state of devices running Android 8.x Oreo).\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n1 PluggedIn Causes the Wi-Fi radio to remain enabled only when the device is plugged in and not running on battery power regardless of sleep state, providing running apps with uninterrupted access to Wi-Fi.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n2 NeverOn Causes the Wi-Fi radio to be disabled when the device enters sleep mode, dropping any existing Wi-Fi connection.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNetworks 'Available' Notification\n\nControls whether to display user notifications when unknown, open networks such as those offered by public Wi-Fi come into range of the device. If enabled, the user is presented with the opportunity to connect with such networks. This might be desireable for personal or dual-use devices, but could introduce vulnerabilities when connecting to non-secure or otherwise unknown networks. Zebra recommends disabling Network Notification on devices intended for use only on corporate Wi-Fi networks.\n\nParm Name: NetworkNotification\n\nOption Name Description Note Status Requires 2 Do not change This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) causes no change to the current network notification setting; any previously selected setting is retained.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n1 true Enables user notifications to be displayed when unknown, open networks come into range.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n0 false Disables user notifications when unknown, open networks come into range.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nWi-Fi Wakeup Enable/Disable\n\nThis is the On/Off switch for Wi-Fi Wake-up, which enables Wi-Fi to automatically connect when a previously connected network is detected. This feature can be used to help conserve battery power by enabling Wi-Fi only when known networks are in range.\n\nWi-Fi Wakeup requires the Android Location service and Wi-Fi scanning feature to be enabled on the device.\n\nParm Name: WifiWakeup\n\nOption Name Description Note Status Requires 2 Do not change This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) causes no change to the setting; any previously selected setting is retained.\n\nMX: 9.1+\n\n1 Enable Enables Wi-Fi to wake automatically when a previously connected network is detected.\n\nMX: 9.1+\n\n0 Disable Prevents Wi-Fi from waking up automatically.\n\nMX: 9.1+\n\nCountry Selection Auto/Manual (checkbox)\n\nControl the country-selection preference for network usage and Wi-Fi regulatory setting by the device. Check the box to select the country manually from the drop-down menu; leave the box unchecked to allow the network router or Wi-Fi access point to select the country using the 802.11d protocol.\n\nParm Name: UseRegulatory\n\nOption Name Description Note Status Requires checked UseRegulatory Permits manual country selection.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nunchecked Country Allows the country to be determined by the router.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCountry\n\nUsed to select country-specific Wi-Fi regulatory settings. Choosing \"AUTO\" enables selection through 802.11d, which configures the device to listen for a country-specific beacon. Using the AUTO setting, the device will not transmit unless it can successfully detect the country and use a frequency that is consistent with the country's Wi-Fi infrastructure. This setting is the least likely to violate country-specific regulations. Countries that do not support the 802.11d infrastructure must be selected manually.\n\nShown if: The \"Configure Country (Auto/Manual)\" box is unchecked\n\nParm Name: Country\n\nOption Name Description Note Status Requires AUTO AUTO (Use 802.11d)\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nDZ Algeria\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nAI Anguilla\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nAR Argentina\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nAU Australia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nAT Austria\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nAZ Azerbaijan\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nBS Bahamas\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBH Bahrain\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBD Bangladesh\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nBB Barbados\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBY Belarus\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBE Belgium\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBM Bermuda\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBO Bolivia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBQ Bonaire\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBA Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBR Brazil\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nBG Bulgaria\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCA Canada\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nKY Cayman Islands\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCL Chile\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCN China\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCX Christmas Island\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCO Colombia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCR Costa Rica\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nHR Croatia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCW Curacao\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCY Cyprus\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCZ Czech Republic\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nDK Denmark\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nDO Dominican Republic\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nEC Ecuador\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nEG Egypt\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSV El Salvador\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nEE Estonia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nFK Falkland Islands(Malvinas)\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nFI Finland\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nFR France\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nGF French Guiana\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nDE Germany\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nGH Ghana\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nGI Gibraltar\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nGR Greece\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nGP Guadelope\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nGU Guam\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nGT Guatemala\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nGG Guernsey\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nGY Guyana\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nHT Haiti\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nHN Honduras\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nHK Hong Kong\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nHU Hungary\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nIS Iceland\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nIN India\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nID Indonesia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nIE Ireland\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nIL Israel\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nIT Italy\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nJM Jamaica\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nJP Japan\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nJO Jordan\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nKZ Kazakhstan\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nKE Kenya\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nKR Korea Republic\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nXK Kosovo\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nKW Kuwait\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nKG Kyrgyzstan\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nLV Latvia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nLB Lebanon\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nLI Liechtenstein\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nLT Lithuania\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nLU Luxembourg\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMK Macedonia, Former Yugoslav Republic\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMY Malaysia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMT Malta\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMQ Martinique\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMX Mexico\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMD Moldova\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nME Montenegro\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMA Morocco\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nAN Netherlands, Antilles\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNL Netherlands\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNZ New Zealand\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNI Nicaragua\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNG Nigeria\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNU Niue\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNF Norfolk Islands\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nMP Northern Marina Islands\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nNO Norway\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nOM Oman\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPK Pakistan\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPA Panama\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPY Paraguay\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPE Peru\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPH Philippines\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPL Poland\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPT Portugal\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPR Puerto Rico\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nQA Qatar\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nRO Romania\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nRU Russian Federation\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSX St. Maarten\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSA Saudi Arabia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSN Senegal\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nRS Serbia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSG Singapore\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSK Slovakia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSI Slovenia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nZA South Africa\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nES Spain\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nLK Sri Lanka\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nSE Sweden\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nCH Switzerland\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nTW Taiwan, Province of China\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nTH Thailand\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nTT Trinidad and Tobago\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nTN Tunisia\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nTR Turkey\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nUG Uganda\n\nMX: 11.5+\n\nAndroid API: 30+\n\nUA Ukraine\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nAE United Arab Emirates\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nGB United Kingdom\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nUS U.S.A.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nUY Uruguay\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nVE Venezuela\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nVN Vietnam\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nVG Virgin Islands(British)\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nVI Virgin Islands(US)\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nRF Band Selection\n\nUsed to select which RF band(s) the device uses for 802.11 communications.

This protocol uses authentication to establish the entitlement of a device to join the network and then distribute necessary keys once this entitlement has been verified. Security information pertaining to the EAP type and authentication credentials to be used will need to be supplied to configure these networks.\n\nOpen network security is not generally advisable since no security credentials are needed to connect. If an open network is to be used, security can be added through VPNs, data encryption or other means.\n\nBasic security generally implements a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) or Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) key known to the device and the Wi-Fi infrastructure to encrypt data. These networks are more secure than open networks, but can be compromised if the keys are not handled securely and/or changed periodically.

In these cases, an Anonymous Identity can be sent so as not to disclose the actual Identity, password or other verifying credentials. A separate Anonymous Identity can be used only if the Authentication Server is set up to support it.\n\nIf no Anonymous Identity is specified, then the actual Identity is sent outside the tunnel, if required. This may still be secure since the password and/or other verifying credentials are always sent inside the tunnel (in modes that use a tunnel for secure credential delivery).

Encrypting a Password might be desirable as a security measure to prevent extraction and exploitation in case the XML is intercepted while in transit.\n\nA Password combines with an Identity to form an authentication credential for gaining access to a network. Authentication is required only when \"Enterprise\" is the selected Security Mode. All authentication types require a Password except EAP-TLS, which uses a client certificate.\n\nShown if: The Network Action is \"Add\" and the Security Mode is \"Enterprise\" and the Authentication is NOT \"EAP-TLS\"\n\nParm Name: ProtectPassword\n\nOption Name Description Note Status Requires 0 (unchecked) Passwords are stored in clear text on the device unless specifically encrypted using the Password Protect Encryption parameter.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\n1 (checked) Encrypted and clear-text Passwords are stored in a protected area on the device that is NOT accessible by users or unauthorized applications.\n\nMX: 4.2+\n\nPassword\n\nUsed to enter a Password to be used to connect to a network.

When Authenticating with EAP types other than EAP-TLS (which would not require a client certificate), a client is still allowed. In this case, the client certificate is used to authenticate the device to the authentication server as part of the establishment of the secure tunnel over which further authentication credentials is delivered. The client certificate does not need to be unique, even if the authentication credentials are. The use of a client certificate can introduce an additional level of protection by requiring a device to have a valid client certificate as well as valid authentication credentials. The client certificate serves as a first-pass filter.\n\nParm value input rules:\n\nString from 0–64 characters\n\nNOTES:\n\nApplicability of this Enterprise Authentication option might depend on the version of Android running in the device.
