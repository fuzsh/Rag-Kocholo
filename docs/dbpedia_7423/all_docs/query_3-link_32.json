        "text": "Design of the state flag\n\nThe flag of the state of Victoria is based on the blue ensign. It consists of a blue background with the Union Flag in the top pole-side quarter. In the background area there are five white stars representing the Southern Cross. Above the stars is a St Edward’s Crown.\n\nThe stars don't have an identical number of points. The variation in the number of points represents their relative brightness in the constellation.\n\nHistory of the state flag\n\nVictoria was the first Australian colony to have its own flag.\n\n1865\n\nThe Imperial Parliament in the United Kingdom passed the Colonial Naval Defence Act. This act empowered Australian colonies to provide, maintain and use vessels of war. As a result of this, each colony needed to have its own distinctive flag.\n\nIn December a dispatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies required that all colonial vessels of war wear a Blue Ensign with the seal or badge of the colony in the fly (the half of the flag furthest from the staff) and a blue pennant.\n\n1870\n\nOn 4 February the Governor proclaimed that the design of the Badge of the Colony of Victoria be of 'five white stars, representing the constellation of the Southern Cross'.\n\nOn 10 February the Argus newspaper reported the first flying of the Victorian flag:\n\n1877\n\nOn 12 November the Governor proclaimed a change to the design of the Flag of the Colony of Victoria:\n\n1901\n\nOn 19 September The Honourable Sir John Madden KCMG, Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria, informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that Victoria would now be referred to as a 'state' in place of the word 'colony'. He also advised that in the design of the state flag, the crown would take the form of the St Edward’s Crown.\n\nThe design of the state flag has not changed since.\n\nMore information\n\nOrganisations can be notified when flags should be flown at half-mast or flown for special events by joining the Victorian Flag Notifications Network.\n\nInformation about the Australian flag and a full range of national flag protocols can be found at the It’s an Honour website.\n\nFind out more about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags.\n\nDownload an image of the Victorian Flag:"
