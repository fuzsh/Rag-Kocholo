        "text": "It is believed among the people that red colour on the Serbian flag represents the blood shed for this country, the blue represents freedom, while the white represents mother’s milk feeding strong Serbian children.\n\nFlag experts believe that the colour symbolic is not related to our specific area and national experience, but view these meanings as universal. They offer an explanation according to which the blue colour is a symbol of fidelity and loyalty, and the white colour a symbol of purity and honesty.\n\nThe flag of the Republic of Serbia is used as:\n\nstate flag,\n\nnational flag, with the scale 3:2 (length according to height),\n\nstandard: state flag of square shape used by the President of the Republic and President of the National Assembly.\n\nOn the basis of the authority from the Law on the Appearance and Use of the Coat of Arms, Flag and Anthem of the Republic of Serbia, in 2010, the Government adopted the Decree on Determining the Standards of the Great and the Small Coat of Arms, the Standard of the Flag and the Note Recording of the Anthem of the Republic of Serbia.\n\nThe standards of the coat of arms and flag of the Republic of Serbia and the graphic standards for displaying the National Flag, the State Flag, the standards of the President of the National Assembly and the President of the Republic can be found here.\n\nThe Anthem of the Republic of Serbia is the festive song “Boze Pravde” the lyrics of which were written by Jovan Djordjevic in 1872, and the music was composed by Davorin Jenko.\n\nIt was accepted as the official anthem of Serbia on 8 November 2006.\n\nAnthem lyrics:\n\nGod of Justice; Thou who saved us\n\nwhen in deepest bondage cast\n\nHear Thy Serbian children's voices,\n\nBe our help as in the past.\n\nWith Thy mighty hand sustain us,\n\nStill our rugged pathway trace;\n\nGod, our hope; protect and cherish,\n\nSerbian lands and Serbian race!\n\nBind in closest links our kindred\n\nTeach the love that will not fail,\n\nMay the loathed fiend of discord\n\nNever in our ranks prevail.\n\nLet the golden fruits of union\n\nOur young tree of freedom grace;\n\nGod, our Master! Guide and prosper,\n\nSerbian lands and Serbian race!\n\nLord! Avert from us Thy vengeance,\n\nThunder of Thy dreaded ire;\n\nBless each Serbian town and hamlet,\n\nMountain, meadow, heart and spire!\n\nWhen our host goes forth to battle\n\nDeath or victory to embrace-\n\nGod, our Master! Guide and prosper,\n\nSerbian lands and Serbian race!\n\nOn our sepulchre of ages\n\nBreaks the resurrection morn,\n\nFrom the slough of direst slavery\n\nSerbia anew is born.\n\nThrough five hundred years of durance\n\nWe have knelt before Thy face,\n\nAll our kin, O God! Deliver\n\nThus entreats the Serbian race!"
