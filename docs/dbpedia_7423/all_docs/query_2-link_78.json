        "text": "Chapter 1. Plugin Basics\n\nThere is literally a plugin for almost anything you want to achieve in WordPress. A quick glance at the WordPress Plugin Directory will show you just how many options are available. Admin, Ajax, Comments, Google, Posts, Sidebar, Twitter, and Widgets are all so very well represented that finding the right one can be a full-time gig. Twitter alone has over 200 plugins dedicated to pulling, pushing, and searching through its masses of data. However, before we can auto-tweet a post, or dynamically interleave links to Amazon products, we have to comprehend how a plugin works, and more importantly, how to install and activate them on our blog.\n\nEvery plugin is written in PHP (an awesome open source programming language) and are usually accompanied by various other internet file types such as CSS, Javascript, XML, images, JSON files, and so on. Thanks to WordPress's open architecture, developers can inject their plugin's code throughout your blog without you having to touch a single line of code, unless, of course, you want to.\n\nIn this chapter, we cover the following:\n\nInstalling plugins\n\nHow plugins work\n\nTroubleshooting plugins\n\nSafety first\n\nIt's very much imperative to understand that plugins have the ability to affect virtually every part of your blog. If a plugin developer was feeling decidedly evil, he/she could create mayhem to your website with a few tiny lines of code. Make sure you trust the recommending source that's promoting a plugin before you install it.\n\nI personally recommend and reference almost exclusively throughout this book http://Wordpress.org/extend/plugins, the official Wordpress.org Plugin Directory. This self-policing community often provides very valuable and detailed pros and cons for almost every plugin, with the ability to sort by popularity, rank, and date released.\n\nAutomatic plugin installation\n\nOut of the box, WordPress comes with its own plugin app store, which allows you to search through a huge library of free plugins. To access WordPress's built-in plugin browser, click Add New under the Plugins menu. Once inside the plugin app store, you have the option to either search by keyword or name, browse by popular tags, or see the newest plugins added.\n\nAfter you search or browse by a tag, you will be presented with a list of plugins that are available for you to install from WordPress's Plugin Directory. Each will list its version number (the later the version, the more stable, usually), a community rating, a more detailed description, and an Install link.\n\nNow is a good time to remember that you are dealing with FREE software; what you are about to install will most likely offer NO guarantees or warrantees. Never forget that a plugin runs server-side code on your website, which means that a plugin can access your database(s), can read, write, and delete files, and even send e-mails from your domain.\n\nNote\n\nPlease read the reviews and listen to what the community has to say about the plugin you are about to install.\n\nIf a plugin is rated with 1 star by a lot of the community, it would be wise to keep your distance. But if a plugin has been installed 40,000 times and has a 3+ star rating, it's fair to say that it is trustworthy.\n\nClicking Install on this screen will not actually install the plugin; instead, it will launch a window that provides even more details about the specific plugin.\n\nPlugin detail\n\nThe plugin details pop-up window provides you with a deeper look into the plugin you are about to install.\n\nThe important areas to pay attention to are as follows:\n\nThe number of downloads shows how popular a plugin is.\n\nThe average rating shows you what the community thinks about the plugin.\n\nLast Updated date tells you if the project is still being actively worked upon.\n\nCompatible up to tells you if the plugin has been tested on your version or not. Keep in mind that a lot of plugins might not have been \"tested\" with your current version, but will still work.\n\nMany times, plugins require no additional setup or configuration, while others need a bit more tooling around to get running. If the developer provided Installation instructions, make sure to look them over to ensure that you're not getting in over your head. If you are happy with what you see, click the big red Install Now button.\n\nDownloading, unpacking, installing\n\nIf, after clicking the Install Now button, you make it through all of the steps and see Activate Plugin, you're in for a treat! Congratulations, your web host supports the Automatic Install of WordPress.\n\nActivating the plugin\n\nWhile you have installed the plugin, you aren't done yet! We still need to activate it.\n\nOnce you click Activate Plugin, WordPress will go through the process of turning the plugin on. Depending on what the plugin does, this process could include creating new database tables or setting up new folders and files.\n\nOnce activated, you still might be required to provide more information before the plugin can run properly. For example, if you're installing Alex King's Twitter Tools plugin, you'll need to provide your Twitter credentials before it can do any of its magic.\n\nConnection Information required\n\nIf, when you click Install Now, you see the Connection Information form, like the image in the next screenshot, then we have a little more work to do before we can start installing plugins automatically. However, you still have a chance to have \"Automatic Install\" if your hosting-provider allows it. Follow the next few steps to see if it's still a possibility. Don't worry if the next steps fail; we will still be able to install plugins quickly, just not as quickly as the \"Automatic Install\".\n\nIn this window, provide your Hostname, which will most likely be just your domain name. For example: icorbin.com (minus the http), your FTP username, and its password. Some installations might have FTP and SFTP for the connection type; if SFTP is available and it works when you click proceed, use it.\n\nIf your web host doesn't support this method, then we need to attack the problem without WordPress and instead use our own FTP client.\n\nManual installation\n\nIf you find that the Automatic Install feature isn't compatible with your web-hosting provider, then manual installation is the next best option. In this section, we will cover how to do it on both a Mac and PC.\n\nAt the highest level, manually installing a plugin will require you to connect to your web server, locate the WordPress plugins directory, and transfer a plugin that you have downloaded to your computer using either FTP or SFTP. Once you connect to your web server, you will need to locate your WordPress Plugin folder, which will most likely be in wp-content/plugins.\n\nManually installing a plugin with a Mac\n\nIf you do not currently have an FTP/SFTP application on your Mac, then I highly recommend Cyberduck, the best free FTP/SFTP client available for the Mac. You can download a free copy of Cyberduck from http://cyberduck.ch/.\n\nAfter launching the Open Connection, located in the upper-right hand side of the Applications window, the following screenshot will ask for the specifics on connecting to your website. This information can all be usually found in your web host's control panel or the initial setup e-mail you received when you created your hosting account.\n\nConnection Type: FTP, SFTP FTP-SSL. Which connection you should use depends on what your web-hosting provider supports. Almost all web hosts offer the less secure FTP protocol, but if you can, I would suggest connecting with SFTP (Secure FTP).\n\nServer: the domain name or IP address of your website.\n\nUsername: your FTP account username.\n\nPassword: your FTP account password.\n\nClick Connect.\n\nIf everything connects properly, you should see a list of files that exist on your website.\n\nBrowse to your plugin directory located at wp-content/plugins. This folder is where we will be putting any new plugin we want to install.\n\nTo save time, you can create a bookmark in Cyberduck, and save it on your desktop or Dock so you are only a click away from your plugin folder. To create a bookmark, select New Bookmark from Cyberduck's Action drop-down menu.\n\nTransferring a plugin\n\nOnce you have downloaded the plugin to your computer, you will need to move it over to your website. To do this, we will move the plugin (most likely a .ZIP archive) to your website's FTP directory. Using Cyberduck, we will extract the ZIP file on the server. Extracting archives on the server can save significant time, as we are only uploading one file opposed to the hundreds some plugins can contain.\n\nNow that we have the plugin's ZIP archive in the plugins directory, we need to expand it or unzip it. Cyberduck offers a super quick way for us to expand archived files like ZIP, TAR, and Gzip by right-clicking on your plugin and selecting Expand Archive.\n\nManually installing a plugin on Windows\n\nFor Windows users, I suggest the open source application called WinSCP—this great utility will allow you to connect to your server by FTP, SFTP, and FTP-SSL. To download WinSCP, visit http://winscp.net.\n\nOnce you have downloaded and installed WinSCP, launch the application, and you will be presented with the following screenshot:\n\nHost Name: The domain name or IP address of your website\n\nPort number: Leave this field as it is, as it will be set when we select a protocol in the next couple of steps\n\nUsername: Your FTP account's username\n\nPassword: Your FTP account's password\n\nNext click Login.\n\nIf everything connects properly, you should see the following screenshot, which will contain all of the files that exist on your website, in a similar fashion that Windows Explorer does.\n\nMost website providers keep all of the website files in a specific directory; our goal is to find this folder and proceed to wp-content/plugins. If you do not see wp-content, then look for a folder like htdocs, httpdocs, or www. Once you locate this folder, inside you should find the folders and files that make up your WordPress installation.\n\nOnce inside the plugins folder, we want to create a bookmark so that we can access this folder super quickly next time.\n\nActivating your plugin\n\nNow that we have installed the plugin on the server, either by using Cyberduck on the Mac, WinSCP on Windows, or old school SSH, we still have one more step to go, namely, to activate the plugin.\n\nTo activate our plugin, we will first need to visit our plugin browser by expanding the \"Appearance\" tab and clicking on \"Plugins\". The plugin browser will display all of the plugins that are currently installed—inactive plugins have a light gray background while active plugins are denoted with a white background.\n\nOnce you have located the plugin you just installed, click the \"Active Plugin\" link. WordPress will now go through the steps needed to get that plugin ready and roaring.\n\nOnce your plugin has been activated, you will need to determine if there are any additional steps required to complete the plugin setup. Some of the more complex plugins might require you to provide additional information or might need some special code added to your WordPress theme files. It all really depends on the plugin that you are installing. If you found the plugin through the WordPress directory, then you will most likely find instructions that will tell you exactly the steps you will need to take.\n\nEditing plugins\n\nIf you are a power user or someone who likes to get their hands dirty, you will love the Plugin Editor! This little feature allows you to see the raw source of the plugin, and even make changes to it (if you have set the plugins folder to writable). To learn more about file and folder permissions, head over to http://codex.Wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions.\n\nBy clicking through Plugins | Plugin Editor, you will be presented with the code for the main plugin file. If your plugin folder is writable, you will be able to make changes and click Save. WordPress has safeguards in place to ensure that if you happen to make a mistake with the plugin, that it automatically becomes deactivated. If, at any point, you mangle a plugin to the point where you can no longer fix it, simply delete the plugin and reinstall it."
