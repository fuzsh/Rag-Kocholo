        "text": "The concept of “conformance” is central to GS1 standards. A GS1 standard exists to define certain characteristics of an implementation created by an end user or solution provider. An implementation is said to conform to a GS1 standard if it satisfies the conformance conditions laid out in the text of the standard. The standard is written such that when multiple implementations are in conformance to the standard, those implementations are capable of interoperating in the way envisioned by the authors of the standard. Conformance is the soul of what a GS1 standard is intended to convey. It is therefore essential that a GS1 standard be clear and unambiguous in what it says about conformance.\n\nThe text of GS1 standards should be drafted to address the following aspect of conformance:\n\n■ The standard should clearly identify what types of implementation artefacts are subject to conformance to the standard. In other words, what are the things that can be judged as in conformance or not in conformance to the standard?\n\n■ If there are different ways to comply with the standard, the standard should clearly identify each conformance level or conformance option, ideally giving each a name that can be used in conformance testing reports to precisely indicate to what levels or options a given implementation conforms.\n\n■ Normative statements in the body of the standard should use the verbal forms SHALL, SHOULD and MAY as defined in the ISO Directives. Moreover, such statements should be worded so that it is clear how it applies to an implementation. Generally, this means the subject of these verbal forms should be “a conforming implementation” or a similar phrase.\n\nEach of these points is explained and illustrated in detail in the sections that follow.\n\n3.4.1 Identifying what may conform\n\nA GS1 standard should identify what types of things are subject to conformance to the standard. For a data standard, a conforming implementation might be a specific piece of data or an electronic document. For a barcode print quality standard, a conforming implementation might be a specific printed barcode. For a messaging standard, a conforming implementation might be the sender or receiver of a message, or the message content itself. For a software interface standard, a conforming implementation might be a software implementation on one side of the interface or the other.\n\nMany standards define conformance requirements for different implementation artefacts which interact according to the standard. In such cases, there are several types of implementations that conform to the standard, each conforming to different statements within the standard. For example, the Gen2 Air Interface Standard defines interactions between an RFID reader and an RFID tag. So there are two types of conforming artefacts, readers and tags and the standard includes some statements that define what it means for a reader to conform and other statements that define what it means for a tag to conform. Each normative statement in the standard should clearly indicate to which type of conforming artefact the statement applies (see section 3.4.3 The text of the standard that defines the conforming artefacts should be clearly identified and easily found in the standard document. A good way to do this is to have a section titled “Conformance.”\n\nHere are some examples of well-written statements of what artefacts conform to a standard.\n\nFrom the GS1 Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) 1.0 standard:\n\nA “CBV-Compliant Document” is a document that conforms to the schema and other constraints specified in [EPCIS1.0.1], and which furthermore conforms to all the normative language in this standard that pertains to a “CBV-Compliant Document.”\n\nThe CBV standard is a data standard, so it defines a document as an artefact that may be in conformance to the standard. Note that it also identifies conformance to another standard (EPCIS) as a condition for conformance to CBV, in addition to the statements contained in CBV itself.\n\nThe CBV standard also defines applications as another type of artefact that may conform:\n\nA “CBV-Compliant Application” is any application for which both of the following are true:\n\n• If it operates in a mode where it claims to accept a CBV-Compliant Document as an input, the application SHALL accept any document that is a CBV-Compliant Document according to this standard and furthermore in processing that input SHALL interpret each CBV identifier according to the meaning specified herein.\n\n• If it operates in a mode where it claims to produce a CBV-Compliant Document as an output, the application SHALL only produce a document that is a CBV-Compliant Document according to this standard and furthermore in generating that output SHALL only use CBV identifiers to denote their meaning as specified herein.\n\nThe Gen2 Air Interface Standard defines RFID Readers (called “Interrogators”) and RFID Tags as two types of artefacts that may conform. (In the example below, the word “protocol” refers to the Gen2 Air Interface Standard itself.)\n\n2.2.1 Interrogators\n\nTo conform to this protocol, an Interrogator shall:\n\n• Meet the requirements of this protocol,\n\n• Implement the mandatory commands defined in this protocol,\n\n• Modulate/transmit and receive/demodulate a sufficient set of the electrical signals defined in the signalling layer of this protocol to communicate with conformant Tags, and\n\n• Conform to all local radio regulations.\n\nTo conform to this protocol, an Interrogator may:\n\n• Implement any subset of the optional commands defined in this protocol, and\n\n• Implement any proprietary and/or custom commands in conformance with this protocol.\n\nTo conform to this protocol, an Interrogator shall not:\n\n• Implement any command that conflicts with this protocol, or\n\n• Require using an optional, proprietary, or custom command to meet the requirements of this protocol.\n\n2.2.2 Tags\n\nTo conform to this protocol, a Tag shall:\n\n• Meet the requirements of this protocol,\n\n• Implement the mandatory commands defined in this protocol,\n\n• Modulate a backscatter signal only after receiving the requisite command from an Interrogator, and\n\n• Conform to all local radio regulations.\n\nTo conform to this protocol, a Tag may:\n\n• Implement any subset of the optional commands defined in this protocol, and\n\n• Implement any proprietary and/or custom commands as defined in 2.3.3 and 2.3.4, respectively.\n\nTo conform to this protocol, a Tag shall not:\n\n• Implement any command that conflicts with this protocol,\n\n• Require using an optional, proprietary, or custom command to meet the requirements of this protocol, or\n\n• Modulate a backscatter signal unless commanded to do so by an Interrogator using the signalling layer defined in this protocol.\n\n3.4.2 Conformance levels and options\n\nMany standards, especially technical standards, are not monolithic, but instead define different modules of features that can be used for different applications. In this case, there may be implementation artefacts that do not conform to the entire standard, but which conform to selected parts of the standard. Of course, an implementation cannot pick and choose which parts it conforms to: the standard itself must define specific groups of features or options which must each be implemented in their entirety to claim conformance. When this is the case, a standard must clearly specify what are the available conformance levels and options, and what are the conformance requirements for each.\n\nFor example, the GS1 Application Level Events (ALE) 1.1 standard defines five different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). A given implementation of ALE may implement a subset of these APIs, but each API it implements must be implemented in its entirety to claim conformance.\n\nAnother example, the GS1 EPC Information Services (EPCIS) 1.0.1 standard defines a software messaging interface to which an implementation may conform. A large number of normative statements pertain to all implementations that conform to this interface. But the EPCIS standard offers a choice of message transport, based on HTTP or AS2. A conforming implementation may implement one or both of these message transports. These constitute conformance options.\n\nAnother example, the Gen2 Air Interface Standard defines a base level of functionality that all tags and readers must implement. Many features are optional in this base level of conformance. Annex N defines additional conformance levels; to qualify for any of these conformance levels a tag or reader must conform to specified normative statements that are otherwise optional in the base conformance level. A tag or reader may be tested to be in conformance to the base level, or may additionally be tested to be in conformance to one of the higher levels.\n\nAll conformance levels should be identified clearly, and it should be absolutely apparent which normative statements apply to which level. Ideally, each level should be given a name, so that it is easy to refer to it in a conformance testing report for any particular implementation.\n\n3.4.3 Wording of normative statements\n\nAt the heart of a GS1 standard are normative statements. A normative statement is a statement that defines the behaviour or otherwise places a constraint upon a conforming implementation. Collectively, the normative statements are what gives a standard force.\n\nIn GS1 standards, normative statements are written using the verbal forms described in section 7 of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 9th edition [ISODir2]. These include the words SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY. When these words are written in a normative statement, using the special meanings defined in [ISODir2], they are written in all capitals to distinguish them from ordinary English use of the same words.\n\nFor a precise definition of these verbal forms, see [ISODir2]. Briefly, their meanings are summarised as follows:\n\n■ SHALL means that all conforming implementations must do what the statement says, otherwise the implementation is not conforming. No deviation is permitted.\n\n■ SHOULD means that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable for a conforming implementation, without mentioning or excluding others. In other words, a conforming implementation is expected to do what the statement says, but might not if there is a good reason not to. It is similar to a MAY statement, but carries a stronger expectation that an implementation will usually do what the statement says.\n\n■ MAY means that a conformation implementation is allowed to do what the statement says, but it is not required to for conformance.\n\nThe most precise way to write a normative statement is to name a type of conforming artefact as the subject and one of the special words above as the verb; e.g., “A conforming implementation of this standard SHALL do …” This makes it very clear to what artefact a given normative statement applies, and offers a precise way to assess whether the artefact is in conformance or not.\n\nIt is less effective to make some concept internal to the standard be the subject of the verb. For example, imagine a hypothetical standard that defines an interface between an RFID Reader and an RFID Tag, in which there is a Read command defined. The following sentence does not follow the above guideline:\n\nThe address field of a Read command SHALL be less than 400.\n\nHere, the subject of the verb is “a Read command”. It is not clear whether this conformance statement applies to a conforming RFID Reader, a conforming RFID Tag, or both. It is also not clear what happens if this statement is violated. The following wording is much clearer because it makes the conforming implementation the subject of the verb:\n\nA conforming RFID Reader SHALL NOT issue a Read command whose address field is greater than or equal to 400. A conforming RFID Tag SHALL process a Read command whose address field is less than 400, and SHALL reject with error code 62 a Read command whose address field is greater than or equal to 400.\n\nRepetition of this style of sentence can become very tedious. Tables are a good way to avoid repetition, and with the appropriate introductory sentence can be just as precise:\n\nAll commands issued by a conforming RFID reader SHALL be as specified in the following table:\n\n[table goes here]\n\nA SHOULD or MAY statement indicates something that is optional; an implementation does not have to do what the sentence says in order to be in conformance. Quite often, there are optional features of a standard such that an implementation does not have to implement the feature, but if it does it has to do it a certain way to achieve interoperability. The correct way to write this in normative language is in a style similar to the following:\n\nA conforming implementation MAY implement the XXXX feature. If a conforming implementation implements the XXXX feature, it SHALL do YYYY.\n\nThis makes it very clear what is expected of an implementation if it implements the optional feature."
