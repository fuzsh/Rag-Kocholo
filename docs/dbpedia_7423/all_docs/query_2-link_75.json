current savedata in dev_usbXXX, use it with caution\n\nDownload someone else’s savegame for your game of your choice\n\nPut the savedata in your pendrive in “X:\\PS3\\SAVEDATA” (pendrive must be in FAT32)\n\nPut in the pendrive in the PS3\n\nSelect Network Tab > [★ Custom Firmware Tools] > PSN Tools > Convert Savedata\n\nWait until the conversion finishes\n\nOnce finished, copy your converted savedata throught XMB “Saved Data Utility (PS3)”\n\nLaunch your game and load your new savedata\n\nCreation of act.dat tutorial\n\nWARNING: The accountID is linked to savedata and trophies, so, if your current user already have a valid accountID and you overwrite it, you will be unable to use your trophies and savedata on that account until you restore the original accountID in xRegistry.sys.\n\nI recommend to use an empty account without trophies and savedata or an account without accountID.\n\nTo create a fake act.dat, Cobra 8.5 must be enabled, and your PS3 must have at least one account with a valid accountID and launch a game that requires a RIF/RAP license file.\n\nCobra will search a valid accountID in all existing accounts and create act.dat while the game is launched through the XMB. If no accountID is found, act.dat will not be created.\n\nYou can create a fake accountID (like reactPSN), to do this go to Network > ★ Custom Firmware Tools > PSN Tools and choose between “Create accountID” or “Overwrite accountID” (Be careful about the last option because if you already have a fake/real accountID it will be overwritten). It is recommended to use these options in an account that does not have an ID. The PS3 will restart if everything went well.\n\nThe tutorial would be the following:\n\nDownload your purchased PSN game from PS Store\n\nPut game RAP file in “X:\\exdata” or “/dev_hdd0/exdata”\n\nLaunch your purchased PSN game\n\nCobra will check if any of your PS3 accounts have accountID\n\nFaked act.dat will be created while the game is launching\n\nIf none of your accounts have a valid accountID you will need to create it. To do this log into the local PS3 account where you want to create the accountID. You can see if your current local account has an accountID choosing Network Tab > [★ Custom Firmware Tools] > PSN Tools > Show accountID.\n\nTo create a faked act.dat do the following:\n\nMake sure Cobra 8.5 is enabled\n\nSelect Network Tab > [★ Custom Firmware Tools] > PSN Tools > Create accountID\n\nSelect Network Tab > [★ Custom Firmware Tools] > PSN Tools > Activate account\n\nLaunch your purchased PSN game\n\nFaked act.dat will be created while the game is launching\n\nNow you have a faked act.dat and your local account is activated. The act.dat file works for every local account, you only need one file for all accounts.\n\nBlock PSN log in\n\nThis method is developed by @DeViL303, it will only work with Cobra enabled, Cobra will block log in on PSN/SEN while the CFW syscalls are enabled, to enable it again you need to disable CFW syscalls completely (you can do it with webMAN MOD, psnpatch, SEN Enabler, etc…).\n\nIf you want to disable this feature, simply use the option Cobra Tools > Disable PSN Protection and you will be able to log in with syscalls enabled. To enable it again use the option Cobra Tools > Enable PSN Protection\n\nThere is some information that need to be aware, are the following:\n\nThe accountID is directly linked to savedatas and trophies data. If you have trophies or savedatas in\n\nyour current local account, THEY WILL BE CORRUPTED after setting FAKE accountID. To fix this, copy the\n\nsavedata to the root of a USB, convert it and then copy it back through XMB in 'Game' tab. To fix\n\ncorruption in trophies you need to delete it/them. Is highly recommended to do this on a local account\n\nwithout trophies/savedatas\n\nThe FAN speed is constant when in a PS2 game, BE CAREFUL while selecting modes because it will not\n\nchange after the PS2 game is loaded. It is also static when choosing a mode in the \"Manual Speed\"\n\noption. All current speeds in xai_plugin must keeping a correct temperature in CPU and RSX\n\nDo not rename vsh.self manually and ALWAYS use the option for it in xai_plugin, it can cause that the\n\nPS3 can't load the XMB when you have full version of webMAN MOD, DEX Kernel and CEX vsh.self. The\n\nCFW has a protection to avoid this\n\nIf you want to install OtherOS on PS3's internal HDD you first need to go to Recovery Menu and select\n\n[Restore PS3 System], this will format the HDD and create a partition for OtherOS. Remember to make\n\na backup of all your data before\n\nDON'T TRY TO SWAP KERNEL WHEN YOU HAVE LOADED AN EXTERNAL KERNEL FROM USB/FLASH!!\n\nThis can cause brick and you may need a hardware flasher to repair the PS3\n\nYou can unload Cobra/plugins if you have any problem with them, for this you need to go to Recovery\n\nMenu and then reboot the PS3, this will disable both\n\nIt is recommended to ALWAYS activate the QA Flags, it is very important, it allows you to install CFW\n\nfrom versions prior to the one installed and also avoids issues\n\nIf you can't dump or make an ISO of your game disc in multiMAN, go to mmCM tab and select [Switch\n\nto multiMAN mode], this will reboot multiMAN and now you will be able to dump/make an ISO of your\n\ndisc\n\nOtherOS on PS3 with NAND is very dangerous if you don't know what you are doing (for example using\n\nthe wrong image to install petitboot), it can cause brick and the only way to repair it is with a hardware\n\nflasher. PLEASE USE IT WITH CAUTION!\n\nMake sure you are installing the correct image for OtherOS. xai_plugin tells you what image need to be\n\ninstalled too. For NAND you need dtbImage.ps3.bin.minimal and for NOR dtbImage.ps3.bin. If the\n\nwrong image is installed, it can brick on NAND, needing a HW flasher to repair it, in NOR you can fix it\n\nformatting the HDD\n\nIf your PS3 has a CFW noBD (in any of its variants) and latest versión of webMAN MOD (1.47.42 at the\n\ntime of writing this guide), there are chances that the PS3 can’t read an external devices (/dev_usb000,\n\n/dev_usb001, …) in the next two minutes. To fix this, go to webMAN Setup page, click on webMAN\n\nMOD Setup and check noBD patch and reboot the PS3, now it may read external devices\n\nEnable FTP and Disable FTP can fail randomly, if you want to use any of them wait a few seconds before using any again.\n\nThe option Check GPU/VRAM clock speed now should work fine without crashes\n\nIn PEX and D-PEX versión some of the debug options pressing triangle are missing because a/some\n\nfile/s hasn't been ported yet (needs a lot of research with XMB layouts, I have patched some of them\n\nbut others not, for example, trophies entries are messed up), those options are (maybe more):\n\n★ Check\n\n★ Owner Information\n\n★ Cancel Purchase\n\n★ Performance Bar\n\n★ No Memory Limit\n\nIf you have OtherOS/Petitboot installed it can created issues while loading PS2 games or rebooting the LV2, to fix this you need to use the option [OtherOS Tools > Set GameOS Boot Flag], now you can use the PS3 as always\n\nThe CFW is meticulously tested and no bugs have been found, but that does not mean that there are\n\nany or that it fails at any specific time. If that happens, contact me as soon as possible so that I can\n\nsolve it.\n\nIt is recommended to use webMAN MOD, especially with some PSX games that have libCrypt (Dino Crisis for example), and for PS2 games\n\nCredits and Acknowledgment\n\nCredits to Team Rebug, Team Cobra, @mysis, @Joonie, @habib, @aldostools, @haxxxen, @DeViL303, @zecoxao, @3141card, @Berion, @kakaroto, @KW, @naehrwert, @flatz, @DeanK, @Rogero, @Estwald, @sguerrini97, @TheRouLetteBoi, @bucanero and anyone who has contributed to the PS3 scene.\n\nThanks to @DeViL303, @Berion, @Brandon Stump, @jcorrea, @nhie07, @NSC-Modz, @LuanTeles, @thejavigames, @raidriar, @xiaoyang, @Zwei, @haxxxen, @RetroFan_90, @SpyroMancer, @patricksouza472, @MrYadro, @CFW-Us3r, @Andrio, @KcrPLo, @nur @Rakhmadi Rajab, @Lwiz, @Sheireen, @TheWizWiki, @A79266251, @EimGdt, @Kyan_dudl, @hackzy01, @kernaltrap, @wintr, @Paweł, @ORION_games_, @Mikeclan_, @MlK3YY_, @XxalexXrey, @MurilloMadriz, @ReinSertt , @vitormoraes1903 and all who helped me testing the CFW 4.91.\n\nIf I forgot someone, I apologize, there are many people in the PS3 scene and you are many people who\n\nhave helped me to test the CFW.\n\nDownload: MEGA FOLDER WITH ALL 4.91.2 CFW BETA VERSIONS JULY 14TH, 2024​\n\n4.91.2 BETA10:\n\n+ Added Extended Download Plugin by DeViL303\n\n+ Reverted CEX game_ext_plugin.sprx instead DEX to avoid issues with PS Plus\n\n4.91.2 BETA9:\n\n+ Fixed external kernel check when using the option [Swap Kernel] in PEX/D-PEX\n\n+ Fixed random blackscreen while enabling QA Flags\n\n+ Updated advanced QA Flags (thanks to Zecoxao and Soul)\n\n+ Fixed 0x800299D2 error code and blackscreen (Blu-ray/DVD playback in CEX/DEX mode)\n\n+ Updated [Toogle OFW Mode on Boot] option to allow to restore syscalls automatically\n\n+ Added PlayStation Home (by DeViL303)\n\n+ Added custom eula_cddb_plugin.rco (by DeViL303)\n\n4.91.2 BETA8:\n\n+ Updated Cobra payload loading at different offset in LV2 Kernel\n\n+ Re-compiled LV2 Kernel\n\n+ Re-compiled Cobra stage2\n\n+ Added LV2 Kernel external load check when using the option [CEX2DEX Tools > Swap Kernel]\n\n+ Added MD5 check for dtbImage.ps3.bin and dtbImage.ps3.bin.minimal files for OtherOS\n\n+ [XAI] Added new option to toggle between original libaudio.sprx and patched with third BT headset suuport (may fail with some)\n\n+ [XAI] Re-enabled [Toggle External Cobra] option in xai_plugin\n\n4.91.2 BETA7:\n\n+ Re-compiled LV2 Kernel\n\n+ Re-compiled Cobra stage2\n\n+ Added support for third party BT headset\n\n4.91.2 BETA5/6:\n\n+ Fixed error 0x8002F155 while installing PUP\n\n+ Fixed FAN max speed, now it shows 0xFF and 100%\n\n+ Temporary disabled \"Load External Cobra\"\n\n+ Reverted code for cobra in Kernel\n\n4.91.2 BETA4:\n\n+ Added option to enable full QA Flags\n\n+ Fixed xai_plugin description for IDPS/PSID/MAC spoofing from \"/dev_hdd0/tmp\"\n\n+ Added TTY output in socat using Cobra Debug\n\n4.91.2 BETA3:\n\n- New kernel/Cobra payload build\n\n- Fixed random freezes/crashes (Tested for several hours thanks to @ktemanuel)\n\n- Cobra updated to 8.5\n\n- Fixed blackscreen/freeze while launching PS3/PSP/PSX ISOS\n\n- Fixed freeze while installing PKGs from external exFAT/NTFS device\n\n- Reverted patch that caused problems while playing BD movies\n\n- Updated Trophy Unlocker to version 1.1\n\n- Created [noBD] variants for PEX and D-PEX\n\n- [COBRA] Added support for REDUMP ISOS decryption on-the-fly\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Opcode to toggle coldboot animation\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Opcode to toggle epilepsy warning\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Opcode to toggle gameboot animation and sound\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Opcode to toggle hidden trophy info\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Target Manager fix for DEX\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Added cellUsb000_mount_symbol\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Added usb_flag and no_cobra flags\n\n- [COBRA/XAI] Option to toggle PS2 disc icon (ISO/BIN.
