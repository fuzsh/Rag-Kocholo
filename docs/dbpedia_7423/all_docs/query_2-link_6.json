        "text": "Was this helpful?\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nThe feedback you submit here is used only to help improve this page.\n\nThat’s great! Thank you for your feedback!\n\nThank you for your feedback!\n\nAbout Editing Responses\n\nPerhaps you’d like to remove profanity, spelling errors, or sensitive information from a respondent’s text entry response. Maybe a respondent told you they answered a few questions incorrectly before they submitted their response. Response editing allows you to revise survey responses inside the Data & Analysis tab. Qualtrics even maintains the original data so you can revert to the original responses any time.\n\nQtip: If you have a respondent that needs to change many answers, try sending them a retake link instead. Note that while you can also export and import edited data, importing edits won’t change the original response, instead it will upload duplicates with different Response IDs and Recorded Dates.\n\nChanges made with response editing will be reflected in Results Dashboards, Results, Advanced-Reports, and in CX Dashboards. You can also export raw data with response edits using the default (Data Table) format.\n\nAttention: Response editing changes won’t be reflected in Crosstabs, but can be retrieved by API if you use Start Response Export, Get Response Export Progress, and Get Response Export File calls.\n\nEditing Individual Responses\n\nThis workflow describes how to edit a single response. You can also make edits to multiple responses before reviewing and publishing your changes.\n\nQtip: If you want to edit a certain question or embedded data field, you must add its column in the Data & Analysis tab. Columns may already be added by default.\n\nClick on the field you’d like to change.\n\nEdit your response. For multiple choice questions, there is a dropdown to select from. For text entry questions, you can type answers directly.\n\nClick out of the field to finish editing.\n\nQtip: When making edits, you can only input data that matches the field’s data type. For example, if you’ve created a text entry question with Numeric Validation, you’ll only be able to type in a numeric answer.\n\nClick Review and Publish to review the changes you made. Here you have the option to delete individual edits, revert all current edits, or publish your edits.\n\nAttention: Response edits won’t be saved automatically. You must publish your edits for them to be reflected in your dataset.\n\nOnce you’ve reviewed the changes, click Publish your Changes to save them.\n\nQtip: Your changes may take a couple minutes to appear in the data table. While they are processing, they’ll appear as pending requests.\n\nQtip: When making edits, you can only input data that matches the field’s data type. For example, if you’ve created a text entry question with Numeric Validation, you will only be able to type in a numeric answer.\n\nEditing Multi-Answer Questions\n\nSome questions allow respondents to select multiple answers. To begin editing these fields, click on the answer. You can then use the checkboxes to edit and remove answer choices.\n\nTo remove an answer, uncheck the answer choice you want to remove. To add another answer, select the checkbox next to the answer choice you want to add.\n\nEditing Multiple Responses\n\nThis option allows you to edit the same field for multiple responses at a time.\n\nSelect the responses you’d like to edit using the checkboxes to the left of each response. You can select all fields by clicking the checkbox at the top of the column.\n\nQtip: Adding filters to your Data & Analysis tab can help you narrow down what responses you want to select for editing. See our Filtering Responses page for instructions on building filters.\n\nClick the editing icon.\n\nWhere it says Field Name, select a field to edit.\n\nWhere it says Value, select or type in the new value.\n\nQtip: If you see a “replace existing values?” option, then you are editing a custom field.\n\nClick Update to save your edits.\n\nRestoring Original Data\n\nRestoring Data for a Single Response\n\nA gray triangle will appear in the upper-left corner of any response you’ve edited. Clicking this triangle will tell you when the data was edited and by whom.\n\nClicking the field also gives you the option to restore data.\n\nLocate the cell of data you’d like to restore to its original state.\n\nOn the top-left of the cell, click the gray triangle.\n\nSelect Revert to original to restore the original response.\n\nWarning: Once you revert your fields to the original data, your edits aren’t retrievable.\n\nRestoring Data for Multiple Responses\n\nIt is also possible to restore data for multiple edited responses at once.\n\nSelect the responses you’d like to revert using the checkboxes to the left of each response. You can select all fields by clicking the checkbox at the top of the column.\n\nQtip: Adding filters to your Data & Analysis tab can help you narrow down what responses you want to select for editing. See Filtering Responses for instructions on building filters.\n\nClick the revert icon.\n\nSelect the field you want to revert.\n\nClick Revert.\n\nFields That Cannot Be Edited\n\nNearly all question types and fields are editable via the response editing tool, including text entry questions, multiple choice questions, slider questions, and embedded data fields. However, the following types of data aren’t editable:\n\nSurvey metadata, such as response ID, start date, and other fields Qualtrics records automatically for your survey\n\nQtip: The only exception is User Language, which can be edited.\n\nThe Distribution Channel contact field\n\nViewing order data of randomized choices, questions, or elements\n\nHeat map questions\n\nPick, group, and rank questions\n\nFile upload questions\n\nSignature questions\n\nTiming questions\n\nMeta info questions\n\nFor Net Promoter® Score questions, groups can’t be edited, but you can change the numeric value, which will assign the Group accordingly.\n\nScores and scoring categories\n\nThe outcome of formulas and fields created through bucketing can’t be edited directly. However, if you edit the questions the custom variable is derived from, the outcome of the custom variable will change, too. Notice that when the height is modified in the example below, BMI changes to fit the new data.\n\nProjects Where You Can Edit Responses\n\nData & Analysis is available in many different types of projects. You can edit responses within Data & Analysis in the following kinds of projects:\n\nSurvey projects\n\nXM Solutions\n\nImported data projects\n\n360 projects\n\nQtip: See Managing Response Data (360) for more details.\n\nConjoint\n\nMaxDiff\n\nQtip: You cannot edit conjoint- or MaxDiff-specific data. Only additional survey content.\n\nWhile the functionality is technically available in other types of Employee Experience projects, it works a little differently. See Response Editing (EX) for more details.\n\nFAQs\n\n'>\n\nOnce you collect responses, they are stored in the Data & Analysis tab, where you can edit them, analyze them, export them, and more. This page describes how to manage response data for 360 projects.\n\nThe Export Data feature is used to download raw response data for use beyond the 360 platform. Exported data files allow you to view how each participant answered each question in a survey, and also include survey metadata (e.g., Recorded Date, IP Address, etc.).\n\nSurvey options is where you go to change many general survey settings, such as the timeframe the survey's available, the addition of a back button or visible question numbers, and more. To access these settings, click Survey options in the Survey tab.\n\nOnce you collect responses, they are stored in the Data & Analysis tab, where you can edit them, analyze them, export them, and more. This page describes how to manage response data for Engagement, Lifecycle, Pulse, and Ad Hoc Employee Research projects. For more details on each of these project types, see Types of Employee Experience Projects.\n\nImagine that you have a product used equally as often by men and women. But when your customer feedback on this product returns, 70% of your respondents were female, and 30% were male. If you were to present these results as collected, they would skew in favor of the women’s answers, even though they are only 50% of the target demographic.\n\nSometimes, you will want to work with only a particular subset of your respondents’ data. Maybe you just want to glance at the last 3 months of data, or you are interested in exporting only the responses given by single mothers aged 18-35. No matter how specific the needs of your study, with Qualtrics, you can build filters for your response data and save them for later reuse."
