        "text": "In 1252, King Alfonso III. married Beatrix of Castile, and from that time on the Castilian heraldry was combined with the Portuguese heraldry and was from 1383 even supplemented with the green lily-cross of the new dynasty of Aviz. The image of the coat of arms was then transferred to the flags. At that time a common practice.\n\nSource for image and text, and more information about the country and flag, also in English, at: www.flaggenlexikon.de and there under Kingdom of Portugal\n\nThe selection is preset to glossy polyester with side-ribbon and 2 metal eyelets, please note the alternatives. More information at the bottom of the page under 'Product Description' and 'Fastening Systems'.\n\nThe flag is especially manufactured for you.\n\nSet an example for the environment and social standards! The 3D label shows: Our flags are produced in Germany under optimal working and environmental conditions. These are products of very high quality in terms of workmanship and colour, which have - due to the printing procedure and the chosen materials - an above-average lifespan and, initially, also their price. Under normal application in outdoor use, however, you will enjoy it for approx. 5 years, and you will not need to buy another one so quickly! Save money and resources!"
