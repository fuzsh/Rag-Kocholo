        "text": "New Zealanders have voted to keep their national flag - which features the union jack - despite calls for it to be replaced with a silver fern. But where else does the flag of the UK still feature around the world?\n\nRed, white and blue. They're the colours of the union jack, the flag the United Kingdom has presented to the world since 1801. It features the crosses of three patron saints - George (England), Andrew (Scotland) and Patrick (Ireland - although since 1921 only Northern Ireland has been part of the UK). Its official name is the union flag, but the BBC refers to it as the union jack, as per common parlance.\n\nNew Zealand, after much discussion of whether the union jack represents a legacy of colonialism, has voted to keep it in the top left-hand corner of its own flag. But several other countries, states and territories continue to feature it.\n\nMore surprisingly, perhaps, Hawaii, external, which in 1959 became the 50th state to join the United States, also includes the union jack. This dates back to 1793, when British captain George Vancouver presented one (without the diagonal red cross of St Patrick, as this preceded the 1801 Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland) to King Kamehameha I. The union jack flew as Hawaii's sole flag until 1816, when red, white and blue stripes were added. It has remained a part of the flag.\n\n\"It might seem strange, as Hawaii was never British,\" says Graham Bartram, chief vexillologist at the Flag Institute, \"but it works as a symbol of friendship. What's interesting is that, when the union jack changed in 1801, so did the flag of Hawaii, even though there wasn't an official connection.\"\n\nTuvalu, in the south Pacific,, external dropped the union jack from its flag in January 1996 but reinstated it 15 months later, after Bikenibeu Paeniu was elected prime minister. \"It's the flag our people wanted in the first place,\" he said at the time. \"The new flag was never taken to the people for their views. This is the respect for the fathers of our nation. The flag is our symbol, a symbol of our unity.\""
