It will close the dialog only if there are no more edits.\n\nBug 798760 - SLR change reminder with value entry\n\nChange transaction state from Reminder to ToCreate when the user has provided the needed value and clicked OK.\n\nBug 798890 - Printing Problem\n\nBug 799087 - Import - Unbalanced (need acct) transactions now show in red (previously orange).\n\nBug 799090 - Right Clicking scheduled transaction\n\nEnsure that the selection highlight changes to the item under the pointer when right-clicking in the SX Editor.\n\nBug 799092 - GnuCash 5.4 leaves background process running on exit\n\nClear the schema_hash at app shutdown via gnc_prefs_remove_registered and make that function available to the Python bindings so that python programs can do so too.\n\nBug 799099 - Crash when trying to get quotes\n\nBug 799104 - \"Asset Chart\" broken\n\nBug 799108 - \"Since Last Run\" crashes if there are any errors creating a scheduled transaction\n\nCapture errors and display them in a dialog box instead.\n\nBug 799113 - \"Start Import\" button reports \"Failed\"\n\nBug 799121 - Parse error on CSV import on MacOS\n\nBug 799130 - split-register.c:1847:gnc_split_register_save: assertion failed: (xaccTransIsOpen (blank_trans))\n\nBug 799134 - Fails to build with GCC 14 (‘find_if’ is not a member of ‘std’; did you mean ‘find’)\n\nBug 799138 - Port to new Python C config API\n\nNote that this increases the minimum Python version to 3.8\n\nBug 799143 - FTBFS on 32bit architectures\n\nBug 799144 - Date Completion is broken after 5.4 upgrade\n\nBug 799148 - Reliable crash when saving a modified saved report configuration\n\nBug 799150 - Can't paste text (with Ctrl+V) in Notes field in Account Tree View\n\nBug 799151 - gnc_date_get_last_mday () does not account for leap years correctly.\n\nBug 799152 - normalize_reldate_tm() does not handle dates with months greater than 11 or less than -11 correctly.\n\nBug 799156 - normalize_struct_tm() does not normalize seconds,minutes, and hours correctly.\n\nThe following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:\n\nCancel the QIF import instead of inserting the default directory if the user cancels the file-selection dialog.\n\nMemory leak fixes\n\nRename the scheduled transaction edit/new/delete menus to resolve a shortcut conflict.\n\nAllow saving the sort column in the Since Last Run dialog\n\nEnsure that Print Checks obtains for the check amount the sum of all splits in the current register account and subaccounts.\n\nEnsure that report page actions are re-enabled after editing options. Some actions (Print, PDFExport, and Report Options) had been left disabled.\n\nEnsure GncDateEntry always reverts to today if the user enters an invalid date string.\n\nDirect cmake to find the base installed Python3 instead of the latest version installed. Reference Cmake Issue 24126, Cmake Issue 24878, and CMake merge request 8287. Note that this requires CMake 3.20 or later; users of older versions will still get the newest installed Python version.\n\nCI: Run distcheck on one workflow to catch quickly instances where someone adds a file but forgets to update the distribution.\n\nPrimarily of interest to developers: We've added a new CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, Asan, with two options -DLEAKS and -DODR, both of which default to OFF. This creates a non-optimized, with-symbols build with the Address Sanitizer hooks compiled in. While the primary motivation is a CI run to ensure that there aren't any memory allocation errors revealed in the test suite, this is also a useful build to use when debugging a segfault crash, many of which are caused by use-after-free errors. When building on non-Apple platforms -DLEAKS=ON will add leak detection, dumping a stack trace for the allocation of any leaked heap or free-store allocations. Similarly and on non-Apple platforms only -DODR=ON will log violations of the C++ one definition rule.\n\nAlso of interest to developers: A new cmake option -DCOVERAGE. When on and in a non-optimized build this will instrument the program and libraries to count usage for every source line. The option also adds three targets, lcov-initialize, lcov-collect, and lcov-generate-html. The primary motivation is to assess the completeness of tests in CI, see Coverage-HTML for the latest results.\n\nNew and Updated Translations: Chinese (Simplified), Croatian, Dutch, English (Australia), English (New Zealand), English (United Kingdom), Finnish, German, Gujarati, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish\n\nHelp translate GnuCash on Weblate\n\nKnown Problems\n\nComplete list of all open bugs.\n\nDocumentation\n\nNo changes were associated with bug reports between releases 5.4 and 5.5\n\nThe following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:\n\nEBICS: for business customers (of the bank) rather than business users.\n\ndocbook: additional entities for business GUI-elements\n\ndocbook: gnc-gui-*: Rename the scheduled edit/new/delete menus to match a change in the program.\n\nNew and Updated Translations: German\n\nGetting GnuCash for Windows and MacOS\n\nGnuCash is provided for both Microsoft Windows 8.1® and later and MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)® and later in pre-built, all-in-one packages.

Programming on GnuCash began in 1997, and its first stable release was in 1998.\n\nGnuCash 5.2 Released\n\nThe GnuCash development team announces GnuCash 5.2, the third release in the stable 5.x series\n\nBetween 5.1 and 5.2, the following bugfixes were accomplished:\n\nBug 777472 - reconcile does not work if transaction selected\n\nCheck that there's no outstanding activity in the current register page before starting a reconciliation. It is still possible to start modifying a transaction after the reconciliation window is open but this will stop the most common issue with the process. Starting a reconciliation from the account tree is left unprotected.\n\nBug 798564 - GnuCash is slow when there are a lot of open tabs/registers (37)\n\nLazily load registers as is already done with reports.\n\nBug 798597 - The word \"Separators\" needs two separate versions\n\nUse \"Character-separated\" when it's a choice between that and fixed field width and \"Select Separator Character\" when it's a heading.\n\nBug 798695 - Deleting everything from the \"Transfer\" cell after suggestions pop-up restricts search to the first 30 accounts\n\nSkip the search on an empty value and return all accounts in the combo box as it normally does if the account list is opened without searching for something.\n\nBug 798796 - Account list incomplete in report options\n\nAllow stock/fund accounts that are descendants of Bank accounts to be selected for the Advanced Portfolio, Investment Lots and Investment Portfolio reports.\n\nBug 798809 - Multicolumn report error when reopened after saving.\n\nBug 798839 - Edit -> Preferences string not translatable (reopened)\n\nBug 798862 - Merge identical strings (reopened)\n\nEnsure similar strings are identical and use double line view instead of double line mode.\n\nBug 798879 - RFE: [Transaction Report] add Running Total option\n\nBug 798885 - Accented character in folder name on Account Export (reopened)\n\nBug 798899 - Gnucash crashes during CSV import when using a template if the destination account is changed from one used in the template\n\nBug 798901 - Wrong value for very small prices from Finance::Quote.\n\nBug 798916 - Exchange rates fetched from openexchange off by factor of 10\n\nBug 798919 - Inconsistent signs in creating budget\n\nBug 798923 - OFX import is no longer matching security nor asking for stock account.\n\nBug 798930 - invoices won't sequence to the next number\n\nBug 798948 - XML file corrupted by saving twice in extremely short period\n\nBug 798952 - Unable to set day threshold or counters in properties.\n\nBug 798960 - Transaction completion horizontal scrolling opens without the new text being visible and remembers previous position/width\n\nBug 798966 - Uninitialised variable used in dialog-account-picker.c:dialog_response_cb()\n\nThe following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:\n\nThe type-ahead selection of transaction descriptions has been substantially overhauled based on extensive user feedback. Matches are now only on the beginning of words and are now sorted by age since last use. This both substantially reduces the number of matches and prioritizes the most recently used as being the most likely candidates for re-use. To help distinguish cases of long descriptions where the match would be outside the popup's viewport the viewport is automatically scrolled horizontally so that the end of the left-most (right-most in rtl languages) matches is centered in the view. Completion can be aborted with the <escape> key or a new Don't autocomplete selection that's the first entry in the popup.\n\nFix lockup on Windows in type-ahead selection of transaction descriptions.\n\nMore budget-module sign fixes and improvements.\n\nLots of memory-leak fixes, GLib modernization, and code cleanup by Richard Cohen, Simon Arlott, & Chris Lam.\n\nbugfix xaccTransGetTxnType: avoid returning TXN_TYPE_LINK incorrectly: A TXN_TYPE_PAYMENT will have non-APAR splits; a TXN_TYPE_LINK will not have non-APAR splits. This bug manifests as a regular TXN_TYPE_PAYMENT transaction being later voided being incorrectly changed to TXN_TYPE_LINK.\n\nIncluding brokerage fees in Money Out calculation (if not ignoring them) in advanced-portfolio.scm report and updating the \"advanced\" tests to reflect selling fees being included into the money out value\n\n[stock-txn-asst] Don't use the initial value in amount edit widgets unless they're valid.

In that case column heading remains \"Running Balance\" and balance forward is shown. Otherwwise column heading is renamed \"Account Balance\" and balance forward is not shown.\n\nAlso added missing code for Common Currency conversion.\n\nBug 797879 - [Transaction Report] running balance column not consistent with amount column for SAME transaction date\n\nBug 798461 - balance sheet shows positions with zero balances despite report options\n\nBug 798775 - Why is General Journal called \"Register\" in the tabs?\n\nBug 798802 - Online Price quote - Stocks not working GNU 5.0 Windows Bis\n\nBug 798802 - Online Price quote - Stocks not working GNU 5.0 Windows\n\nBug 798807 - Keyboard shortcuts not working\n\nBug 798808 - Saved reports shown on main menu\n\nBug 798810 - Income Statement (multicolumn) - account sorting is 'reversed' each time you restart.\n\nBug 798812 - crashes after I open a customer report and select…\n\nBug 798813 - Under File->Import, Missing OFX/QFX menu item\n\nBug 798815 - flatpak run --command=gnucash-cli cannot download quotes since 5.0.\n\nBug 798821 - Crash when running report in window\n\nBug 798834 - CSS-based Stylesheet Help Button not working\n\nBug 798839 - Edit -> Preferences string not translatable\n\nBug 798844 - \"Assign as Payment\" does nothing in 4.14 & 5.0\n\nBug 798845 - User Config and User Data link broken\n\nBug 798851 - Account Balance 'include subaccounts' not saved\n\nBug 798854 - Softkey 'Save Config' remains dark\n\nBug 798862 - Merge identical strings\n\nBug 798863 - Crash on clicking Settings button second time\n\nBug 798864 - Budget Reporting on select reports are wrong\n\nBug 798869 - Transaction Import MAP\n\nBug 798872 - Reload inoperative for reports\n\nBug 798877 - Program crashes upon selection of CSV profile\n\nBug 798885 - Accented character in folder name on Account Export\n\nBug 798886 - [Transaction Report] Subtotal upper headings do not follow font style of lower headings\n\nBug 798893 - several menu tip messages in reports are marked translatable but unused.\n\nBug 798894 - TOTD with ellipsis broken.\n\nThe following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:\n\nAdd filters to the File>Open dialog in File mode to show only files with GnuCash extensions, only those matching GnuCash's backup file pattern, or any extension.\n\nSelect the first result in the Customer/Vendor search box.

They're set to 23:59:59 local which is always >= neutral time at which prices and transactions are timestamped. Local noon is before neutral time for all time zones east of UTC+2.\n\nBug 798679 - Unicode normalization should be used for comparison but not stored.\n\nChange to NFC normalization for all comparisons because the Unicode meaning of compatible might collide with the user's intent.\n\nBug 798702 - Crash in gnc_plugin_page_focus_idle_destroy() closing a report before it completes.\n\nBug 798705 - ] New: UI string mismatch: OK vs. Next\n\nBug 798712 - Regional Decimal Point not recognized in budgets\n\nBug 798717 - Reports > Business > Fancy Invoice duplicates company details\n\nBug 798732 - : Type of balance carry forward accounts for german skr49 account template fixed\n\nBug 798734 - Aging Reports don't handle mixed currency payments and invoices without Trading Accounts\n\nBug 798734 - Aging Reports don't handle mixed currency payments and invoices without Trading Accounts\n\nBug 798737 - Minor grammatical error - 'for' missing in 'You will be asked a conversion rate for each.'\n\nBug 798740 - Build fails with gcc 13\n\nBug 798747 - Crash in Investment Portfolio report\n\nBug 798748 - Transaction Notes field's value does not appear in reverse transaction.\n\nBug 798754 - Build fails with gcc 13 and glib > 2.76\n\nBug 798759 - Register widths for 'with sub-account' not saved\n\nBug 798765 - Increase the limit for Maximum Slices in the Expense Piechart\n\nThe following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:\n\nBudget totals for one period would be wrong when increasing the number of periods.\n\nAllow C decls after statements, legal since C99.\n\n[kvp] Use static strings and boxed in gvalue_from_kvp_value.

Programming on GnuCash began in 1997, and its first stable release was in 1998.\n\nGnuCash 5.0 Released\n\nThe GnuCash development team announces GnuCash 5.0\n\nNew Features\n\nA new Stock Transaction Assistant to guide you through entering most investment transactions for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You can access it from Actions>Stock Assistant when the focus tab is the Accounts page or a Stock or Fund account register.\n\nA new Investment Lots report showing a graph of capital gains and losses in a period by investment lot. Note that if you don't use the View Lots dialog to manage capital gains and losses this report won't have anything to show you. Use Reports>Assets & Liabilities>Investment Lots to see the report.\n\nThe Online Quotes facility has been completely rewritten and the old gnc-fq-check, gnc-fq-dump, and gnc-fq-helper programs have been replaced with finance-quote-wrapper. The functions performed by those programs may now be accomplished by passing commands to gnucash-cli -Q, see gnucash-cli --help for specifics. The perl module requirements have changed with the rewrite: The new version doesn't need Date::Manip but needs JSON::Parse instead. gnc-fq-update has been, er, updated to reflect that.\n\nA new tab on the New/Edit Account dialog called More Properties includes entries to set a high and low limit on an account. That's coupled to a new column that's available on the Accounts Page, Balance Limit. If you set a high or low limit and the account balance falls above or below the respective limit an indicator will be shown in the Balance Limit column.\n\nThe description field quickfill in the register now displays a drop-down list of possible completions instead of just one inline completion.\n\nFile import menu items for the MT940, MT942, and DTAUS formats is replaced with a single Import from AQBanking that supports importing any file format supported by AQBanking, including the frequently requested CAMT. (Note that some CAMT profiles are under the XML format.)\n\nThe import matcher now permits editing descriptions, notes, and memo fields in the matcher window before creating the transactions. Right-click and select from the context menu.\n\nThe report generated by the Print Invoice button on the Edit Invoice tab can now be configured as a book option at the bottom of the Business tab; this permits selecting a saved configuration of one of the standard invoice reports. Another option enables a delay, during which a dialog box will appear enabling the user to select a different report. Note: When saving a configuration make sure that the invoice number is not set or you'll get that particular invoice instead of the one that you pressed the button for.\n\nSignificant Code Changes\n\nDeprecations (will be removed in GnuCash 6.0)\n\n_ (the alias for gettext. Use G_ instead\n\ngnc:make-account-list-limited-option\n\ngnc:make-account-list-option\n\ngnc:make-account-sel-limited-option\n\ngnc:make-account-sel-option\n\ngnc:make-budget-option\n\ngnc:make-color-option\n\ngnc:make-commodity-option\n\ngnc:make-complex-boolean-option\n\ngnc:make-counter-format-option\n\ngnc:make-counter-option\n\ngnc:make-currency-option\n\ngnc:make-date-format-option\n\ngnc:make-font-option\n\ngnc:make-internal-option\n\ngnc:make-invoice-option\n\ngnc:make-list-option\n\ngnc:make-multichoice-callback-option\n\ngnc:make-multichoice-option\n\ngnc:make-number-plot-size-option\n\ngnc:make-number-range-option\n\ngnc:make-owner-option\n\ngnc:make-pixmap-option\n\ngnc:make-query-option\n\ngnc:make-radiobutton-option\n\ngnc:make-simple-boolean-option\n\ngnc:make-string-option\n\ngnc:make-taxtable-option\n\ngnc:make-text-option\n\ngnc:option-set-default-value\n\ngnc:option-set-value\n\ngnc:option-setter\n\ngnc:option-value\n\ngnc:register-option\n\nThe invoice option to gnc:register-report-create-internal\n\nReport and Book Options\n\nThis major change will affect everyone who has written custom reports in Guile Scheme.\n\nThe report and book options code has been completely rewritten in C++ with SWIG providing Guile Scheme access for reports. The new design requires directly registering options with for example gnc-optiondb-register-string-option instead of calling gnc:make-string-option to create an option followed by gnc:register-option to insert it in the report's options.\n\nValue access is also changed: Instead of retrieving an option and then querying or setting its value with gnc:option-value one will query the optiondb with gnc-option-value, the arguments to which are the optiondb, the section, and the option name.\n\nSupporting the new options backend the options dialog code in gnc-dialog-options, gnc-business-options, and the new gnc-option-gtk-ui have also been rewritten in C++.\n\nOnline Price Retrieval\n\nAs noted under New Features the interface to Finance::Quote has been completely rewritten in C++ with much of the behavior previously coded in external perl scripts moved into GnuCash proper. This permits much better access to Finance::Quotes's facilities and in particular should provide much richer error reporting.\n\nStability Improvements\n\nThere are hundreds of small changes to prevent memory leaks, reduce unnecessary memory allocations, and fix compiler and static analyzer warnings.\n\nUse of deprecated API in C/C++ is now an error (with 3 exceptions), including for the minimum required version of GLib and Gtk.\n\nExtensive changes to the CSV importer, resolving most known bugs.\n\nRemove all unused variables and made an unused variable a compile error.\n\nMove all extern \"C\" declarations into the respective header files and remove extern \"C\" wrappers around #include statements.\n\nSeparate the scheme financial functions into a separate module so that all other scheme code can be banished from libgnucash to bindings.\n\nModernization\n\nThe menus and toolbars now use the GAction and GActionGroup actuation functions, replacing the deprecated GtkAction and GtkActionGroup APIs.\n\nThe experimental Register2 implementation is removed, as is the never-used Jalali calendar code and partly-written option code for creating a book currency.\n\nNew and Updated Translations: Chinese (Simplified), Croatian, Czech, English (Australia), English (New Zealand), English (United Kingdom), Hungarian, Japanese, Macedonian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian\n\nKnown Problems\n\nComplete list of all open bugs.\n\n.\n\nDocumentation\n\nConcurrent with the release of GnuCash 5.0 we're pleased to also release a new version of the companion Manual and Tutorial and Concepts Guide\n\nNote that the document formerly titled Help is now the Manual\n\nThe installation of the documentation has changed to match the XDG-Documentation recommendations so that recent releases of Gnome Desktop's Yelp can find it.\n\nGetting GnuCash for Windows and MacOS\n\nGnuCash is provided for both Microsoft Windows 8.1® and later and MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)® and later in pre-built, all-in-one packages.
