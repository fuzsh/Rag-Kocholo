But how is it made and what does it mean for the current policy debate? How can it be useful to businesses and Member States? What makes this yearâ€™s edition different?\n\nThe Commission invites you to have your say on the proposal regarding electronic version of the VAT exemption certificate until 13 September 2024.\n\nThe Commission has published a guidance document on the application of the rules of origin set out in the EU New Zealand Free Trade Agreement which entered into force on 1 May 2024\n\nThis week, from 1-2 July, Director-General of the European Commission Gerassimos Thomas led a mission of Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union (DG TAXUD) officials to New Delhi."
