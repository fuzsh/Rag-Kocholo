        "text": "This is an image policy of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki.\n\nGeneral\n\nAll images should preferably not be overprinted or watermarked (e.g. with a site or contributor name) and should be uploaded in PNG format.\n\nChecking for card images can be made at Special:PrefixIndex, by entering the beginning of the name of the file there. It can also be checked by looking through the set galleries or the individual card galleries.\n\nCard pages should use the most recent English print of a card, or the most recent Japanese print if the card has not been released in English yet. If the card is manga- or video game-only, an image of that card from the most recent series or video game it appeared in should be used instead, again in English if the media has had an official English release, and otherwise in Japanese. If the card is anime-only, an image of that card from the most recent series it appeared in should be used, this time in Japanese if the media has had an official Japanese release, and otherwise in English.\n\nPlease remember this website is a dynamic site and changes occur all the time; if your image is replaced because it does not fit the current image policy, please do not be offended. We are trying to collect the best Yu-Gi-Oh! images to improve our articles.\n\nNaming OCG/TCG card images\n\nGuidelines\n\nOCG/TCG file names are to be standardized as follows:\n\nCardName-SET-LN-R-ED-Misc.png\n\nCardName should reflect the name of the card's article. In the card name please spell it exactly as it appears on the card, including letters with diacritics and ligatures (Á Ǣ Æ) and characters from non-Latin writing systems (such as Greek).\n\nAll other characters should be omitted from the filename, including whitespace, dashes (- – — － −), wikimarkup characters (: ; # { [ | ] } *), and other punctuation and symbols (. , ? ! & \" ' ` 「 」 【 】 „ “ ~ @ $ ^ % / \\ ( ) ／ < > _ … ° ≈ ≠ ± × ÷ ← → ● • · § ∞ ¡).\n\nSET is the two to four character abbreviation used for the set's name (e.g., MFC for Magician's Force, 301 for \"The New Ruler\", etc.). Some early cards have no set abbreviation. In this case, certain \"in house\" abbreviations have been decided upon. These currently include:\n\nBooster 1 = B01\n\nBooster 2 = B02\n\nBooster 3 = B03\n\nBooster 4 = B04\n\nBooster 5 = B05\n\nBooster 6 = B06\n\nBooster 7 = B07\n\nVol.1 = V1\n\nVol.2 = V2\n\nVol.3 = V3\n\nVol.4 = V4\n\nVol.5 = V5\n\nVol.6 = V6\n\nVol.7 = V7\n\nStarter Box / Starter Box: Theatrical Release = SB\n\nStarter Box pre-order = SBP\n\nEX Starter Box = E\n\nOfficial Guide Starter Book = GSB\n\nDuel Monsters II tournament meeting experience = DME\n\nPremium Pack (Japanese) = P1\n\nPremium Pack 2 (Japanese) = P2\n\nLimited Edition = L1\n\nThe Valuable Book 1 = VB1\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters = G1\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters II: Dark duel Stories promotional cards = G2\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! True Duel Monsters: Sealed Memories promotional cards / Game Guide Promos = S1\n\nDark Ceremony Edition = DC\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters National Tournament attendance card / prize cards = T0\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters II: Dark duel Stories Duelist Legend in Tokyo Dome invitation cards / attendance cards / participation cards / prize cards = T1\n\nJump Festa 2000 promotional cards = JF00\n\nLN is a two-letter abbreviation indicating language/region.\n\nEN = English (worldwide release)\n\nEU = European-English\n\nNA = English cards with no language ID\n\nAU = Australian-English\n\nAE = Asian-English\n\nJP = Japanese\n\nCH = Chinese\n\nFR = French\n\nDE = German\n\nFC = French-Canadian\n\nIT = Italian\n\nKR = Korean\n\nPT = Portuguese\n\nSP = Spanish\n\nTH = Thai\n\nR is to indicate card rarity.\n\nGhost Rare = GR\n\nHolographic Rare = HGR\n\nUltra Parallel Rare = UPR\n\nSuper Parallel Rare = SPR\n\nNormal Parallel Rare = NPR\n\nUltra Secret Rare = UScR\n\nSecret Ultra Rare = ScUR\n\nSecret Rare = ScR\n\nUltimate Rare = UtR\n\nUltra Rare = UR\n\nSuper Rare = SR\n\nHolofoil Rare = HFR\n\nRare = R\n\nCommon = C\n\nDuel Terminal Secret Parallel Rare = DScPR\n\nDuel Terminal Ultra Parallel Rare = DUPR\n\nDuel Terminal Super Parallel Rare = DSPR\n\nDuel Terminal Rare Parallel Rare = DRPR\n\nDuel Terminal Normal Parallel Rare = DNPR\n\nStarfoil Rare = SFR\n\nED is the availability of the card. (This generally does not apply to Japanese cards, except for \"LE\" and \"DT\".)\n\n1E = 1st Edition\n\nUE = Unlimited Edition\n\nLE = Limited Edition\n\nDT = Duel Terminal Card\n\nSC = Strategy Card\n\nOther notes:\n\nIf the card was originally released before the Magic-Spell switch, and the card is distinguishable as a Spell version (for a non-Spell card, if it mentions Spell Cards in its effect or lore), add -Reprint to the filename. For example, Forest-LOB-NA-C-UE-Reprint.png\n\nIf the image is of a card's artwork from an official Konami website (for example, from the Noble Knight Showcase), the name should only use the OW tag (short for \"Official Website\"). For example, NobleKnightArtorigus-OW.png\n\nIf the image is an Official Proxy (meaning it depicts a card, but is not the official card), the rarity should not be inserted and \"OP\" should be appended to the end of the filename. Similar goes for Giant Cards, Case Toppers and Replicas, but those still list the rarity.\n\nUploading OCG/TCG card images\n\nUsers are to include the Template:OCG-TCG card image when uploading card images for licensing purposes.\n\n{{OCG-TCG card image | name = }}\n\nAn example would be:\n\n{{OCG-TCG card image | name = Dark Magician }}\n\nNaming anime and manga card images\n\nAnime card images names are to be standardized as follows:\n\nCardName-LN-Medium-S.png\n\nCardName is the English name of the card, and follows the same rules as for OCG/TCG card names above.\n\nLN is the two letter language code.\n\nJP = Japanese\n\nAE = Asian-English\n\nEN = English (Also includes cards from the English anime with no text.)\n\nMedium is the medium the card appears in:\n\nAnime\n\nManga\n\nS is the series.\n\nTOEI = Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei anime) and Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie\n\nDM = Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime) (known as Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters in Asia)\n\nMOV = Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light\n\nMOV2 = Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time\n\nR = Yu-Gi-Oh! R\n\nGX = Yu-Gi-Oh! GX\n\n5D = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's\n\nZX = Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL\n\nDZ = Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL\n\nAV = Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V\n\nIf an image of a card is unavailable, but an image of the monster itself is, such as in the form of a spirit or a hologram, add -NC to the filename. For example, AeroShark-JP-Manga-ZX-NC.png\n\nCards in galleries may also use other terms:\n\nDUB refers to card images used for non-Japanese airings. The United States has specific FCC regulations that prevent directly advertising to children, so 4Kids modified the card images to be more simplistic, and closer in appearance to their real-world counterparts, even if it made no sense from a rules point-of-view.\n\nNC means non-card, and provides a way to describe images of the card's physical appearance or effect on the playing field in the anime or manga.\n\nIf there are two card images that have different lores, the images can be distingiushed by adding a number at the end of the file name, like:\n\nXYZWings-EN-Manga-AV.png\n\nXYZWings-EN-Manga-AV-2.png\n\nXYZWings-EN-Manga-AV-3.png\n\nNaming video game images\n\nVideo game screenshots should be taken using the game's native resolution and aspect ratio, if possible. If a screenshot is taken in an emulator, the emulator's settings should be configured to display the game as close to its appearance on a physical console as possible (the color palette should be default; there shouldn't be any custom image border; resolution should be 1:1/100%; aspect ratio/display mode should be default; no antialiasing, anisotropic filters, interpolation effects, etc. should be used; and so on).\n\nFor reference, the native resolutions of some consoles are as follows:\n\nGame Boy and Game Boy Color: 160×144\n\nGame Boy Advance: 240×160\n\nNintendo DS: 2 x 256×192\n\nVideo game card image names are to be standardized as follows:\n\nCardName-Game-LN-VG.png\n\nCardName is the English name of the card.\n\nGame is which game the image was taken from; this is usually the same as the set abbreviation for the promotional cards included with the game or its guide (if any).\n\nBAM = Yu-Gi-Oh!
