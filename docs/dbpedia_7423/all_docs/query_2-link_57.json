        "text": "Basic Conventions\n\nA country’s balance of payments tracks payments to and receipts from nonresidents. According to the Manual, the balance of payments is “a statistical statement that systematically summarizes, for a specific time period, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world.” Various conventions for recording items in the balance of payments are presented below.\n\nThe Double-Entry Accounting System\n\nThe basic convention applied in constructing a balance of payments is the double-entry accounting system. Every transaction recorded using this system is represented by two entries with equal values but opposite signs, a debit (−) and a credit (+). Thus, by convention, certain items are recorded as debits and others as credits, as follows:\n\nExports of goods and services Credit (+) Imports of goods and services Debit (−) Increase in financial liabilities Credit (+) Increase in financial assets Debit (−) Decrease in liabilities Debit (−) Decrease in assets Credit (+)\n\nExports of goods and services Credit (+) Imports of goods and services Debit (−) Increase in financial liabilities Credit (+) Increase in financial assets Debit (−) Decrease in liabilities Debit (−) Decrease in assets Credit (+)\n\nWith double-entry bookkeeping, the sum of all credits should be identical to the sum of all debits, and the overall total should equal zero. In this sense, the balance of payments is always in balance. The example in Box 4.1 illustrates how a shipment of cars exported from Russia to Poland and involving a payment by a Polish importer through the banking system is recorded under the above conventions.\n\nSome key points in balance of payments accounting are:\n\nReal and financial transactions. “Real” flows involve transactions in goods and services (such as imports, exports, travel, and shipping). Such transactions contrast with financial transactions, or changes in levels of financial assets and liabilities (for example, the repayment of principal on an outstanding loan constitutes a reduction in a liability). Transactions in goods and services are recorded in the current account of the balance of payments. Financial transactions are recorded in the capital and financial account of the balance of payments.\n\nTransfers. Unrequited transfers across national borders are one-sided transactions. Suppose, for example, that the Japanese government donates to the Kyrgyz Republic buses for public transportation. To deal with such transactions, which involve no financial compensation, the balance of payments methodology includes a category called “transfers.” This convention allows one-sided transactions to be converted to standard two-sided transactions. The donated buses are recorded as an import (debit) in the accounts of the Kyrgyz Republic, having been “paid for” by a transfer (credit). More generally, all transfers with an economic value, when no quid pro quo is involved, give rise to a counterentry, either a current or a capital transfer. Current transfers include cash transfers, gifts in kind (such as food and medicines), contributions to international organizations, and remittances sent by workers residing abroad to families back home. Capital transfers may be in cash (investment grants) or in kind (debt forgiveness).\n\nErrors and omissions. In practice, accounts tend not to balance, largely because data are derived from different sources or because some items are underrecorded or not recorded at all. All balance of payments accounts contain the item “net errors and omissions,” which reflects errors in estimation and omissions of transactions that should have been recorded. Entries are recorded net because of the possibility that credit errors will offset debit errors—that is, an underestimation of exports may be partly offset by an underestimation of imports. Since credit and debit errors may offset each other, the size of the net residual cannot be taken as an indicator of the relative accuracy of the balance of payments statement. Nonetheless, large and persisting net residuals impede the interpretation and analysis of the balance of payments for an individual country. Analogously, at the level of the world as a whole, recording discrepancies in one country are not offset by under- or overestimation in other countries.2\n\nFlows and stocks. The balance of payments accounts record flows in two directions. These flows are distinguished from the stocks associated with a country’s international investment position—that is, the value of a country’s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis the rest of the world. The former are measured for a specific time period, whereas the latter are recorded at a point in time, often the end of the year. Two stocks discussed in this workshop are the level of international reserves (external assets of a country) and the level of external debt (a liability).\n\nBox 4.1.\n\nAn Example of Double-Entry Accounting\n\nRussia’s Accounts Poland’s Accounts Exports Credit Imports Debit Bank deposits increase Debit Decline in bank deposits Credit\n\nRussia’s Accounts Poland’s Accounts Exports Credit Imports Debit Bank deposits increase Debit Decline in bank deposits Credit\n\nResidency\n\nThe concept of residency in the balance of payments is based on the transactor’s center of economic interest, not on the transactor’s nationality. This practice follows the System of National Accounts (SNA) studied in Chapter 2. The main considerations relating to economic territory are as follows:\n\nIndividuals living in a country are generally considered residents if they have resided there for at least 12 months. Nonresidents include visitors (tourists, crews of ships or aircraft, and seasonal workers); border workers (who are considered to be residents of the country in which they live); diplomats and consular representatives; and members of armed forces stationed in a foreign country, irrespective of the duration of their stay.\n\nEnterprises are considered residents of the economy where they are engaged in business, provided they have at least one productive establishment and plan to operate it over a long period of time. Therefore, subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies are considered to be resident in the country in which they are located.\n\nGeneral government, including all agencies of the central, regional, and local governments, together with embassies, consulates, and military establishments located outside the country, are considered to be resident.\n\nTime Periods and the Timing of Recording\n\nIn principle, the time period for recording balance of payments flows may be of any length. However, it is usually dictated by practical considerations, especially the frequency of data collection. Many countries prepare balance of payments data annually because firm estimates for some balance of payments transactions are available only once each year. However, since other data (for example, for exports and imports) are often available quarterly and sometimes monthly, some countries prepare quarterly balance of payments data consistent with quarterly estimates of the national accounts.\n\nBy convention, both parties to an international transaction record it when there is a legal change of ownership. In principle, both parties record the same transaction simultaneously, according to the principles of accrual accounting (when transactions such as interest payments are due to be settled, not when cash settlements are made). In practice, trade, service, and financial transactions may be recorded at different times by the two parties, so that adjustments need to be made to the original data derived from trade returns, exchange records, or enterprise surveys.\n\nValuation\n\nA balance of payments transaction should be valued at the market price, which reflects the terms of a specific exchange between a willing buyer and a willing seller. The market price is distinguished from a general price indicator (such as a world market price) for a specific commodity.\n\nIn practice, this definition creates difficulties in recording certain transactions, including:\n\nBarter transactions, which involve a direct exchange of goods for other goods rather than for money;\n\nTransactions between affiliated enterprises (for example, profit transfers between a subsidiary and the parent company); and\n\nTransfers, which often do not have a market price.\n\nProxy measures are used to record these kinds of transactions. For example, bartered goods are valued at market prices.\n\nExports and imports are shown f.o.b. (free on board), or excluding the cost of transportation beyond national borders. Imports are usually recorded by customs on a c.i.f. basis (including the cost of international insurance and freight). However, in the balance of payments accounts, the insurance and freight components are recorded under “services.”\n\nUnit of Account\n\nSince transactions may be settled in any currency, an appropriate unit of account is required for recording balance of payments transactions. Although the national currency can be used, its analytical value loses significance over time as the exchange rate fluctuates. For this reason, balance of payments accounts are often expressed in terms of a stable foreign currency (such as the U.S. dollar or the SDR), facilitating comparisons across countries. The appropriate exchange rate (the market rate prevailing on the transaction date) is used to convert data from the currency used in a transaction into the unit of account currency.3\n\nBox 4.2.\n\nChanges in the 1993 Balance of Payments Manual\n\nManuals Area of Change Fourth Edition (1977) Fifth Edition (1993) Overall Only a statement on balance of payments flows.

Expanded coverage.\n\nNotions of Balance\n\nUnder the double-entry accounting system, the sum of credit items equals the sum of debit items, so that the overall balance is zero. How then is it possible to have imbalances—surpluses or deficits—in the external sector accounts? A surplus or a deficit arises when a given subgroup of external transactions (shown above the line) is distinguished from another subgroup of transactions (shown below the line). If the above-the-line transactions are in deficit, then the below-the-line transactions are in surplus, and vice versa.\n\nOne of the primary purposes of the balance of payments accounts is to provide an indication of the need to adjust an external imbalance. The decision on where to draw the dividing line for analytical purposes requires a somewhat subjective judgment concerning the imbalances that best indicate the need for adjustment. One approach involves distinguishing a subgroup of items that are autonomously determined from transactions that are determined by policy.\n\nThe trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods. From an analytical point of view, it is somewhat arbitrary to distinguish goods from services. For example, a unit of foreign exchange earned by a freight company strengthens the balance of payments to the same extent as the foreign exchange earned by exporters of goods. Nonetheless, the trade balance is useful in practice, since it is often a timely indicator of trends in the current account balance. The customs authorities are often able to provide data on trade in goods long before data on trade in services—which takes longer to collect—is available.\n\nThe current account balance, one of the most useful indicators of an external imbalance, is the difference between credits and debits of goods, services, income, and transfers.8 As explained below, the current account measures the component of the change in an economy’s net foreign asset position attributable to transactions in goods and services.\n\nA current account deficit does not necessarily indicate a need for a policy adjustment, since a deficit may be a temporary imbalance caused by a drop in export prices. But a current account deficit that persists necessitates policy adjustments, since a country cannot continue to finance deficits indefinitely by borrowing abroad or running down international reserves.\n\nThe overall balance equals the current account balance plus all capital and financial transactions that are not considered to be financing items. In analytical presentations of the balance of payments, changes in net foreign assets of the monetary authorities and nonautonomous financing items are placed below the line. The overall balance is an important indicator of the external payments position. Deficits are usually financed by a decline in net foreign assets that illustrates the extent to which the central bank has been financing payments imbalances (in the case of a fixed exchange rate regime) or regulating imbalances indirectly by intervening in exchange markets (in the case of a floating exchange rate regime).\n\nAnalyzing the Current Account\n\nThe key relationship between the balance of payments and a country’s aggregate income and absorption has been discussed in Chapter 2. Ex post, the current account balance is identical to the economy’s resource gap (as measured by the difference between economywide saving and investment). Thus,\n\nS−I=CAB=χ−M+Yf+TRf.(4.1)\n\nTherefore, any analysis of the current account of the balance of payments must consider how changes in saving and investment come about. As seen from equation 4.1, a change in the current account position (such as an increase in the surplus or a decrease in the deficit) must be matched by an increase in national saving relative to investment. Thus, it is important to understand how any policy measures designed to alter the current account balance (through, for example, exchange rates, tariffs, quotas, or export incentives) affect saving and investment behavior.\n\nThe current account also reflects the gap between income and absorption in the economy. Thus,\n\nGNDI−A=CAB.(4.2)\n\nAs this relationship indicates, improving a country’s current account balance requires that resources be released either through a decrease in domestic absorption relative to income or through an increase in national income relative to the rise in absorption. It should be noted, however, that equations 4.1 and 4.2 by themselves do not provide sufficient information for an analysis of the current account, because they do not reflect the various interactions and behavior of agents in the economy. For example, changes in absorption are influenced by changes in disposable income, so that equation 4.2 cannot be used to analyze directly the impact of a change in income on the external current account. The two equations nevertheless incorporate the basic macroeconomic framework in which the current account is embedded.\n\nBy definition, the current account balance is always matched by net claims on the rest of the world—in other words, the change in net foreign assets of nonbank entities or nonmonetary financial flows (ΔFI) and the change in net foreign assets of the banking system or monetary financial flows (ΔRES). This relationship, which is summarized below, derives from the balance of payments identity, which states that the sum of all credit items must be offset exactly by the sum of all debit items. Therefore,\n\n−CAB = ΔFI + ΔRES\n\nor\n\nCAB+ΔFI+ΔRES=0.(4.3)\n\nEquation 4.3 shows that the net provision of resources to or from the rest of the world—as measured by the current account balance9—is matched by a corresponding change in net claims on the rest of the world. For example, a current account surplus is reflected either in an increase in net official or private claims on nonresidents or in the acquisition of reserve assets by the monetary authorities. But a current account deficit implies that the net acquisition of resources from the rest of the world must be paid for by either liquidating the country’s foreign assets or by increasing its liabilities to nonresidents. Thus, the balance of payments identity shown in equation 4.3 can be viewed as the budget constraint for the entire economy.\n\nAs we have seen above, the current account reflects saving and investment of the government and nongovernment sectors. A given current account balance may be consistent with a number of combinations of private and public saving and investment behavior. For example, a deficit in the current account could stem from a private consumption boom or a sharp rise in investment or it could be brought about by a sharp deterioration in the fiscal position, with or without an improvement in private sector saving. Thus the current account balance per se, while an important indicator, is not, by itself, indicative of the need for policy action and even less of the appropriate policy response. It is nevertheless useful as a warning signal—a “red flag”—that alerts policymakers to the possibility of unsound policy. In all cases, the need for policy response and the choice of the appropriate policy will depend on a closer examination of the source of the imbalance.\n\nThe conventional view that a large current account deficit, whether originating in decisions of the private or the public sector, is a cause for concern and appropriate corrective action on the part of the government has recently come under some scrutiny in an influential paper. Max Corden10 analyzed the validity of the “new view” of the current account, viz. the view that if the current account deficit reflects entirely the decisions of private savers and investors, then it should not call forth any governmental policy response. As Corden noted, while the new view has an apparent plausibility in a world dominated by private capital flows, it needs to be heavily qualified on several counts. A private spending boom financed by capital inflows could be based on unsound judgments and could end abruptly. Private external borrowing can have spillover effects on other domestic borrowers, in effect, contaminating all debts by residents and therefore the risks of such contamination need to be watched by the authorities. The changes in the real exchange rate brought about as a result of the current account balance also need to be watched carefully by the authorities because they could reverse themselves and lead to general macroeconomic instability. In sum, the macroeconomic consequences of unsustainable current account imbalances are too severe for the authorities to take a “hands-off” attitude toward such imbalances. As a general rule, therefore, the “new view,” sometimes called the “Lawson doctrine,” is not valid.\n\nThis framework for analyzing the current account balance can be used in many situations independently of the exchange rate regime. For example, if the exchange rate is pegged, then the net demand or supply of foreign exchange at the pegged exchange rate will determine the reserve assets transactions (ΔRES). At the other extreme, under a pure float and with no official intervention, ΔRES = 0, and so CAB = −ΔFI. With a managed float, foreign exchange is bought or sold by the central bank in order to adjust the path of the exchange rate.11 Under a fixed-exchange regime and little capital mobility, countries can afford to run current account deficits only for a limited time period. If a country continues to run a deficit beyond what can be financed through sustainable capital inflows, sooner or later, expectations about an exchange rate devaluation will trigger a foreign exchange crisis well before international reserves are exhausted.12 This suggests that in the absence of capital mobility and under an exchange rate peg, the current account must be monitored closely so as to avoid a sudden speculative attack on a currency and a balance of payments crisis.\n\nFor a discussion of the issue of how to assess the sustainability of a current account position, see Box 4.6.\n\nIndicators of External Debt\n\nWhen a country borrows abroad, it must “service” the loan by paying interest at a rate specified in the loan contract and by paying back principal (amortization) over an agreed time period. The interest component is found in the current account (under “income, debits”), while amortization is recorded in the capital and financial account. In general, countries that have borrowed heavily abroad in the past must devote a sizable portion of their export receipts to servicing foreign debt, limiting the amount of foreign exchange left for financing imports. In assessing the cost of debt servicing, it is useful to relate these costs to total exports of goods and services.\n\nMeasuring the debt burden raises a number of complex issues. Conventionally, the debt burden is calculated as the stock of debt in relation to an index of available resources, such as exports of goods and services or gross domestic product (GDP). But such indices do not capture the impact of debt relief or of lower interest rates on the cost of servicing the debt. Conceptually, analysts should compare the present value of future debt servicing obligations with the present value of future export receipts. This approach requires a certain amount of information and can be sensitive to the discount rate used to calculate the present value. In practice, then, three ratios are used to analyze the debt burden:\n\nthe ratio of scheduled debt service payments to exports of goods and services, which measures the impact of debt servicing obligations on the foreign exchange cash flow;\n\nthe ratio of scheduled (or actual) interest payments to exports of goods and services, which measures the current cost of the debt stock; and\n\ntotal outstanding debt as a ratio of GDP (or of exports of goods and services), which reflects the long-term sustainability of the debt burden.\n\nThe World Bank’s debt reporting system uses critical values of two debt indicators to classify countries according to the severity of their indebtedness: the ratio of the present value of total debt service (PV) to GNP, and the ratio of the present value of total debt service to total exports.22 The indicators are based on the present value concept rather than the value of scheduled debt service in order to account for differences in the terms of the loans. A country is regarded as severely indebted if the present value of total debt service to GNP exceeds 80 percent or if the present value of total debt service to exports exceeds 220 percent.\n\nAlthough these ratios may be helpful in signaling possible debt problems, the economic circumstances of countries with similar ratios may differ. These ratios should therefore be used with caution and only as a starting point for a country-specific analysis of debt sustainability. A full assessment of a country’s debt position must take into account the overall macroeconomic situation and balance of payments prospects. Box 4.9 discusses the sustainability of external debt.\n\nAn issue of increasing concern has been the fiscal burden of external debt. In many countries with external debt difficulties, scheduled debt service payments absorb a major proportion of government revenues, reducing the government’s room to maneuver in terms of fiscal adjustment. External debt sustainability is therefore closely linked to fiscal sustainability.\n\nBox 4.9.\n\nThe Sustainability of External Debt\n\nA country’s external position is considered sustainable if the government can be expected to meet its external obligations in full without rescheduling its debt, seeking debt relief, or accumulating arrears over the medium or long term. The key indicators for assessing sustainability are:\n\nThe ratio of scheduled debt service to exports of goods and services;\n\nThe external financing gap that remains after allowing for expected inflows in the form of grant receipts, loan disbursements, and any commercial capital flows; and\n\nThe ratio of the net present value (NPV) of the debt to exports. The NPV is defined as the discounted present value of all future debt service payments due on existing external debt, relative to the discounted value of the export receipts.\n\nA country’s external debt position is generally considered sustainable over the projection period if scheduled debt service payments decline to 20–25 percent or less of exports of goods and services, if financing gaps are eliminated, and if the ratio of the NPV of debt-to-exports declines to below 200–250 percent of exports.\n\nThe concept of sustainability differs importantly from that of medium-term external viability, which precludes recourse to further exceptional financing (such as the use of IMF resources). If exceptional financing is necessary, a country’s external position cannot be regarded as viable.\n\nGross and Net Reserve Assets\n\nThe use of gross reserves has traditionally been the main source of financing balance of payments deficits and for supporting an exchange rate peg. In today’s world of floating exchange rates, however, many countries find other means of financing imbalances, including foreign borrowing or changing domestic policies. Thus, as they are acquired and used, gross reserve assets do not necessarily reflect the size of a payments imbalance. The monetary authorities may also have other motives for holding reserves—for instance, to maintain confidence in the domestic currency and economy, to satisfy domestic legal requirements, or to serve as a basis for foreign borrowing. Analysts should keep these considerations in mind in examining the reasons for changes in reserves. Net foreign assets are calculated as gross foreign assets minus foreign liabilities of the banking system.\n\nUsing Reserve Assets to Finance a Deficit\n\nFundamentally, the appropriateness of using reserve assets to finance a current account deficit rather than adjusting domestic policies depends on the extent to which the deficit is regarded as temporary or reversible. The size of a country’s reserve assets and its ability to borrow to supplement these assets limit the extent to which reserves can be used to finance a deficit. In the case of temporary shocks, such as poor harvests, reserves can be a useful shock absorber, allowing for a temporary excess of absorption over income. Reserves can also be used to finance a seasonal swing in the current account balance. If the current account imbalance is expected to persist, however, adjustment measures will be necessary. It is important to note that in practice, it is also difficult to judge ex ante whether a current account deficit is temporary or permanent. It may therefore be prudent to initiate some adjustment measures in conjunction with a drawdown of reserves (Box 4.8). Because reserve levels frequently function as signals to foreign investors indicating the policy and investment climate in the country (including the need for an exchange rate change), an adequate reserve level is important in sustaining investors’ confidence.26\n\nRecording Changes in Reserve Assets\n\nWith any definition of the overall balance, it is important to be clear about which transactions are included above the line and which appear below the line. From an analytical perspective, it is useful to group all autonomous transactions above the line and to place below the line transactions authorities control that can be used to finance autonomous flows. However, there are practical difficulties in distinguishing autonomous and policy-controlled transactions; for instance, two extremes of below-the-line classifications can be distinguished. One includes only movements in gross reserve assets held by the monetary authorities; the other, all transactions of the domestic banking system.\n\nUnder the first option, if changes in gross reserve assets are taken as the sole source of financing the above-the-line transactions, then any liabilities of the central bank are necessarily classified above the line. However, some central bank liabilities are special, in that they allow gross reserves to be reconstituted. For example, if a central bank decides to use IMF credit (recorded as an increase in liabilities), then gross reserve assets need not be run down. Another example of financing that augments reserves is borrowing abroad from a line of credit available to the central bank. It is therefore usual, in analytical presentations of the balance of payments, to include such reserve-related liabilities below the line. Thus, changes in net foreign assets are grouped below the line.\n\nBox 4.11.\n\nCapital Flows and the Balance of Payments\n\nIn recent years, capital flows have played an increasingly important role in the balance of payments of a number of countries. Capital flows, defined as the increase in net international indebtedness of an economy, are measured by the balance in the capital and financial account of the balance of payments (excluding reserve assets). In recent years, after a period of capital outflows and debt servicing difficulties, a number of developing countries in Asia and Latin America and some transition economies in Europe have begun to experience sizable capital inflows as nonresidents begin to invest in the economy and the flight of resident’s capital is reversed. These capital inflows have helped to finance larger current account deficits associated with higher imports and higher economic growth. It also permitted buildup of reserves- Despite these benefits, the sudden surges of these sizable inflows have also caused some concern for economic policymakers, because of the difficulties that large-scale inflows of capital can cause for the management of macroeconomic policy (see next chapter on Monetary Accounts and Analysis). There are four important concerns:\n\nCapital inflows can be temporary and hence quickly reversed.\n\nCapital inflows can induce growth in the money supply and cause domestic inflation to rise if the monetary authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market to buy the excess supply of foreign exchange. These inflationary consequences can be avoided if the intervention is sterilized.\n\nIf the monetary authorities do not intervene, the capital inflows can cause the exchange rate of the domestic currency to appreciate.\n\nCapital inflows can finance a temporary boom in consumption, which will eventually lead to a cutback in absorption in order to service the accumulated debt.1\n\nThe second option—which is based on a much broader definition of net foreign assets—includes all transactions of the banking system below the line. However, commercial banks are usually free to choose their foreign asset and liability structure, and such flows are driven largely by market forces (that is, are autonomous transactions). It is only when the central bank has direct and effective control over commercial banks and foreign assets that these assets can be considered for inclusion below the line. Including changes in net foreign assets of the banking system below the line provides a direct link between balance of payments transactions and domestic liquidity creation. Chapter 5 on Monetary Accounts and Analysis provides a fuller discussion of the link between the swings in total net foreign assets and the domestic money supply.\n\nAnalytically then, the most useful definition of the overall balance places all transactions that are under the direct control of the monetary authorities below the line. These transactions include changes in gross reserve assets held by the monetary authorities, and easily identified fluctuations in central bank liabilities used to finance the balance of payments.\n\nIt is important to remember that the overall balance is not necessarily determined by the trade and capital accounts. Indeed, as discussion of the monetary approach to the balance of payments in Chapter 5 makes clear, the opposite may be true. An increase in the demand for a country’s currency relative to other currencies may be reflected in an overall balance of payments deficit, in turn causing shifts in the current as well as financial and capital account balances. More generally, the changes in assets and liabilities of the banking system are closely linked to the overall balance of payments, and this link underpins the monetary approach to the balance of payments.27\n\nReserve Adequacy\n\nAlthough conventionally, the level of reserves has been assessed in relation to the projected total import bill of goods and services, more recent indicators of reserve adequacy have focused on financial vulnerability.28 Whichever indicator of foreign exchange adequacy is used, it is important to keep in mind that the nature of the exchange rate regime plays a part in determining the adequacy of the reserve level. Traditionally, as we have seen, the presumption has been that a country with a fixed exchange rate needs larger reserves than a country with a floating exchange rate regime, since reserves are the only cushion against shocks. However, in practice, if confidence in the authorities’ ability to maintain supporting policies is high, a country with a fixed exchange rate may not require large reserves to defend its currency. For example, the Polish authorities were able to maintain a fixed exchange rate in the early stages of their reform program in 1991 despite only a moderate level of reserves, because their economic policies commanded a high degree of confidence in financial markets. Even with a managed float, a lack of credible economic policies can quickly lead to capital flight and may deplete reserves, even if the authorities allow the exchange rate to depreciate. Thus, at a fundamental level, the credibility of the authorities’ economic policies and the confidence that market participants place in them are key to assessing the adequacy of reserves. Indeed, it is credible policies that allow the authorities to augment reserves by borrowing abroad at favorable terms; such borrowed reserves can potentially provide a major supplement to the country’s own reserves. In the case of Poland, the stabilization fund provided by the IMF played an important role in boosting the credibility of policies, although the fund was never used.\n\nReserves in Relation to Imports\n\nThis indicator measures a country’s gross international reserves in relation to its monthly import bill (annual import bill/12).29 Thus,\n\nGrossinternationalreservescoverageintermsofmonths=GrossinternationalreservesMonthlyimportbill.\n\nA general rule of thumb has been that gross reserves should be equal to at least three months of imports. Countries with six months of import coverage enjoy a relatively comfortable reserve position. However, this rule of thumb evolved during a period when controls on international financial flows were much more extensive than they are today. Therefore, in assessing the appropriateness of the reserve level, analysts should keep in mind a number of factors, including (i) the openness of the capital and financial account; (ii) the stock of highly liquid liabilities; (iii) the country’s access to short-term borrowing facilities; and (iv) the seasonality of imports and exports of the country.\n\nThe average level of import coverage, based on actual data for a sample of IMF members (excluding those whose external position is considered difficult) was 4.5 months of imports in 1994, appreciably above the three-month rule of thumb. However, the coverage level for the Baltic countries, Russia, and the other states of the former Soviet Union has been considerably lower, falling below the three-month benchmark in many cases.\n\nBroader Concepts of Reserve Adequacy\n\nIn recent years, as world capital markets have become increasingly integrated and the size and volatility of private capital flows have risen sharply, the traditional notion of reserve adequacy (three months of import coverage) is being reassessed by policymakers as well as economic analysts. This reassessment has been prompted, in part, by the speed with which even a sizable level of international reserves can be depleted in the face of a crisis in confidence and the associated sudden capital outflow, as was demonstrated in Mexico in late 1994 and early 1995.\n\nThe debate on reserve adequacy in a world of volatile capital flows has focused on indicators of financial vulnerability. In this context, it has been noted that analysts must consider not only traditional flow variables (such as the external current account balance and the fiscal balance) but also stock variables (such as the ratio of domestic money supply, expressed in foreign currency, to the foreign currency value of international reserves).30 The rationale behind this thinking is that international reserves are used to back domestic currency in the event of a crisis in confidence. Reserves also need to be considered in the context of the maturity structure of public sector liabilities. An excess of short-term liabilities in foreign currency increases a country’s financial vulnerability. The degree of openness of both the economy, as reflected in the ratio of external trade to GDP, and the external capital account is also important. It helps to determine the extent of a country’s exposure to risk from volatile capital flows and consequently affects the need for a larger reserve cushion to absorb unanticipated shocks.\n\nIn some cases, reserve holdings are related to the variability (variance) and/or volume of foreign exchange transactions. While these measures on their own are not good indicators of reserve adequacy, they are useful in assessing the need for reserves in countries with mature financial systems. A measure of reserve adequacy defined as the ratio of reserves to the monetary base has been found useful for countries desiring to shift to a fixed exchange rate in the form of a currency board. The rationale behind this indicator is that if gross international reserves are sufficient to cover base money, they provide a benchmark against which the adequacy of reserves to defend the exchange rate can be measured.\n\nIt should be noted that while the three-month import coverage and the monetary base rules tend, on average, to indicate that broadly similar levels of reserves are appropriate for countries with either pegged or managed floating exchange rates, most transition economies find the three-month rule overly demanding.\n\nThe quantitative indicators of reserve adequacy discussed above, while they provide useful rules of thumb, are not a substitute for a careful qualitative assessment of a country’s macroeconomic situation and policies and of the financial markets’ perception of those policies.\n\nExchange Rate Policy\n\nThe Polish authorities’ initial choice of a fixed exchange rate was motivated by a desire to provide the economy with a nominal anchor and thus to calm worries about emerging hyperinflation caused by sizable monetary overhang and impending price liberalization. At the same time, the authorities were concerned about maintaining the competitiveness of the traded goods sector, especially in view of the large external imbalance. They fixed the exchange rate at a level that required devaluing the zloty by over 31 percent in U.S. dollar terms. A parallel market responsive to market forces was allowed to operate alongside the official market.\n\nThe authorities initially regarded the exchange rate peg as provisional, but it turned out to be more durable than expected because of fiscal and monetary tightening and firm wage restraint. The increase in official reserves and the availability of the $1 billion Stabilization Fund also helped to underpin the exchange rate for over 18 months.\n\nThe peg to the U.S. dollar was changed to a peg to a basket of currencies in May 1991 in recognition of Europe’s increasing role in Poland’s trade, and the zloty was devalued by over 14 percent against the basket. The authorities soon recognized that because inflation was higher at home than it was among Poland’s trading partners, a fixed exchange rate would severely erode the country’s competitive position and place intolerable pressures on the balance of payments. The exchange rate regime was therefore changed again in October 1991, this time to a preannounced crawling peg. Under this system, the monetary authorities fix a preannounced path for the exchange rate involving periodic and predictable fluctuations. This system is especially suited to a country that does not wish to abandon the discipline of a fixed exchange rate completely but needs to prevent the erosion of competitiveness in the face of a relatively high domestic inflation rate.\n\nAn important issue in implementing a crawling peg regime is determining the rate of the crawl, or the rate at which the exchange rate is changed periodically. Matching the rate of depreciation to the projected inflation differential during the period is tantamount to targeting the real exchange rate and is sometimes known as a “passive” crawl. An “active” crawl keeps the rate of depreciation lower than the inflation differential, effectively conceding some loss of competitiveness but still putting downward pressure on the domestic inflation rate. Poland adopted an active crawl in October 1991, setting the rate at 1.8 percent a month, significantly below the projected inflation differential. The corrections were to take place daily rather than monthly to avoid sharp movements in the exchange rate.\n\nAs expected, Poland’s inflation rate remained higher than the rates in the countries with which it traded, leading to an appreciation of the real exchange rate under the new regime. To maintain the country’s competitiveness, in late 1991, the authorities adopted a policy of occasional discrete devaluations. In February 1992, the zloty was devalued by 11 percent and in August 1993, by 7.5 percent. The monthly rate of crawl was also reduced in August 1993, from 1.8 percent to 1.6 percent and later to 1.4 percent. Large capital inflows and associated monetary expansion have raised the exchange rate above its projected level recently, forcing the authorities to move to a managed floating regime that permits the rate to float by ±7 percent on either side of the official rate (see Chart 4.2).\n\nIn their efforts to reconcile the objectives of lowering inflation and maintaining competitiveness, the Polish authorities moved from a fixed rate pegged to the U.S. dollar to a rate pegged to a basket, then to a preannounced crawling peg, and finally to a managed float. Their exchange rate policy has broadly succeeded in remaining anti-inflationary while maintaining the external balance."
