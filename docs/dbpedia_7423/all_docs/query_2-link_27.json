        "text": "Prior to release R2015b thedeg2rad andrad2deg functions were part of Mapping Toolbox. In that release theymoved into MATLAB.\n\nAs another solution that avoids converting between degrees and radians, MATLAB also has functionssind andcosd for computing the sine and cosine of angles in degrees and those have been part of MATLAB for quite some time. [I don't remember exactly when they were introduced.]\n\nWhy did you usenargin andreturn when you wrote thisscript ?nargin is defined as being 0 withinscripts andreturn can lead to odd behavior when used within ascript .\n\nWhen I search around, it looks to me as if this code is ripped off fromhttps://github.com/biotrump/NPD/blob/master/NPDFaceDetector/DetectFace.m which is afunction not ascript . An example of calling that function is given in the comments there:\n\nI = imread('lena.jpg');\n\nload('model.mat');\n\nrects = DetectFace(npdModel, I);\n\nYou cannot just remove thefunction line from a function and assign to one variable and expect it to work.\n\nNote: if you pass in the name of a variable as the fourth parameter, then the function you posted will not set that variable to the result of the sum. If you want to return a value in MATLAB you need to code it on the left side of an \"=\" in the function line. For example,\n\nfunction s = test(num1, num2, small)\n\nload (small, num1, num2)\n\ns = sum(num1, num2)\n\nend\n\nThis is unlikely to work the way you want it. In order for the load() to work there, small and num1 and num2 would each have to be a character vector or else a scalar string variable, and num1 and num2 would have to be in the same form as valid MATLAB variable names. Those names would have to be found inside the .mat file named by the small variable.\n\nWith the form of load() you have used, MATLAB would normally \"poof\" the variable names into existence. However, when you use end matching a function statement, you make a promise to MATLAB that you will not poof variables into existence, and MATLAB is permitted to give an error or to ignore the magically created variables. Therefore after the load, num1 and num2 are probably going to continue to be the character vectors or string objects, and you would attempt to call sum() passing those in. sum() would give an error if the first parameter, num1 is a string object, but would be okay with num1 being a character vector. There are a limited number of character vectors or scalar string objects that are valid for the second parameter of sum(), namely 'all', 'double', 'native', 'default', 'includenan', or 'omitnan' . It would be surprising if you happened to name your variables any of those...\n\nyou are expecting that when your script calls ode45 and that ode45 calls Moles and that Moles calls fzero and fzero calls temp, that temp will somehow look all the way back up the chain to find values for xt P A B C to use in temp.\n\nThat never happens. There are no situations in MATLAB in which a missing named parameter has its value found by chasing up the chain of calls to find a variable with the same name as the variable.\n\nAnd if there were such an resolution operation, what would you do if it turned out that ode45 had variables named A and B and so those values ended up being used instead of following all the way back to the script? Such an operation would require that the child function (temp) know the name of all of the calling functions' variables so as to avoid an accidental name clash. This would be poor programming design.\n\nThis is why in all major programming languages, resolution of variables is either positional or lexical (controlled by where the variables declared).\n\nfirstly, i run this code which ask for image and i select image and it extract features. there are four images. i extract features of these four images by running this code four times ( i dont know this is right thing to do), it gives four .txt files.\n\nafter that i run the code i mentioned in previously , but that code gives error as i mentioned before.\n\nfirstly i run this code. it runs ok.\n\nclear;\n\nclc;\n\nclose all;\n\n[filename,path]=uigetfile('*.tif','Fingerprints');\n\nflag =1;\n\nfilename=strcat(path,filename);\n\nExtract_Features(filename,flag);\n\nthen i run this code\n\nthis below code i mentioned previously that gives error:\n\nfunction Extract_Features(filename,flag)\n\nimg1 = imread(filename);\n\nif ndims(img1) == 3; img1 = rgb2gray(img1); end\n\ndisp(['Extracting features from ' filename ' ...']);\n\nfir=ext_finger(img1,0);\n\nfir=fir(fir(:,3)<5,:);\n\nif flag ==1\n\nfigure;\n\nimshow(img1);\n\nhold on\n\nfir1=find(fir(:,3)==1);\n\nfir3=find(fir(:,3)==3);\n\nplot(fir(fir1,1),fir(fir1,2),'r+');\n\nplot(fir(fir3,1),fir(fir3,2),'bo');\n\nend\n\nfilename2=filename; filename2(end-1)='x'; filename2(end)='t';\n\nsave(filename2,'fir','-ascii');\n\nend\n\n>> Extract_Features\n\nThat is a mistake because you are not telling Extract_Features which file you want to process.\n\nYou already designed code to ask the user which file to process and then to automatically call Extract_Features to do the work on the file, so you should be running that code instead of running Extract_Features directly. So at the command line, give the name of the file that you wrote that starts with the line\n\nFor example if that code is stored in fingee.m then at the command line give the command\n\n>> fingee\n\nIn order to use movmean(), you have to pass in the signal whose moving mean is to be taken, and you have to pass in the size of the window. In your code, you are passing in only the signal, without the size of the window.\n\nIf you manage to fix that problem, then you would then be passing the result of movmean() into sqrt(), and you would be passing 'window' as the second parameter to sqrt(). However, sqrt() does not accept any options at all.\n\nThe code you probably want would be\n\nenvelope = sqrt(movmean(rec_EMG.^2, window));"
