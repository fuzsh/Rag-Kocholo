The data set contains recordings of dynamic hand gestures collected from human volunteers and is divided into eight subfolders.\n\nCreate a signal datastore that points to the files located in the download folder. Include subfolders in the search path.\n\nCreate a list of labels based on the filenames contained in the datastore. Extract only the substring of the filename that includes the gesture code (G1, G2, ..., G12). Verify that each of the eight subfolders contains one file corresponding to each gesture."
