Maybe you’ve waved a paper hand flag on Canada Day, or worn it as a pin on your jacket. Maybe you’ve even sewn one on to your backpack and travelled the world! Regardless of where you see it, the National Flag of Canada stands out both at home and abroad as one of the most striking and recognizable symbols representing Canada.\n\nBut has Canada always had its iconic red and white maple leaf flag to showcase itself to the world? It may surprise you to learn that our flag is relatively young and that it has an eventful history.\n\nWhile the quest for a national flag for Canada dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the flag as we know it today emerged from the major social transformations during the 1950s and 1960s in the lead up to the 100th anniversary of Confederation in 1967.\n\nSpecific etiquette and protocols apply to the National Flag of Canada. For example, the National Flag should never touch the ground.\n\nRead more about flying the National Flag of Canada.\n\nEarly flags\n\nThe royal union flag (Union Jack)\n\nThe Canadian Red Ensign\n\nAs Canada matured as a nation, it became more important to create uniquely Canadian symbols to represent the country. In 1921, King George V granted Royal Arms to Canada and the shield of Canada’s new official coat of arms took its place on the Canadian Red Ensign. It is this version of the Canadian Red Ensign that represented Canada during the Second World War.\n\nThe search for the right flag\n\nBeyond a new coat of arms, many Canadians also wanted a new, distinctive Canadian flag to represent them. Appeals for such a flag increased steadily in the early 20th century. But creating an entirely new flag was no easy feat. Which symbols could be chosen to represent and characterize Canada and its values?\n\nIn 1925 and again in 1946, attempts were made to consider possible concepts and designs for a new national flag. However, on both occasions the projects were shelved by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, mainly due to fears that the issue might lead to political instability. As a compromise, the Canadian government chose to keep the Union Jack as the national flag and to fly the Canadian Red Ensign from government buildings.\n\nIn the years following the Second World War, public opinion grew in favour of a new national flag, but the nation was divided. Canadians had fought and died under the Union Jack and the Canadian Red Ensign and many were still attached to these emblems and to their British heritage.\n\nCreating a new flag 1960-1965\n\nIn 1960, Lester B. Pearson, then Leader of the Opposition, declared that he was determined to solve what he called “the flag problem.” To Pearson, this issue was critical to defining Canada as a unified, independent country. As the newly elected Prime Minister in 1963, Pearson promised to resolve the question of a new national flag in time for Canada’s centennial celebrations in 1967.\n\nPearson began by proposing a concept for a new flag featuring a sprig of 3 red maple leaves, similar to those in the national coat of arms, on a white background bordered by 2 blue stripes. The heraldic expert and artist Alan Beddoe took Pearson’s concept and developed it into a design that became known as the “Pearson Pennant.”\n\nPearson recommended this design to members of Parliament in 1964, but his proposal was strongly opposed. Instead, a parliamentary committee was created and given a 6-week deadline to submit a recommendation for a national flag. Debate within the committee was fierce, divided between those who wished to retain the symbols that tied Canada to its colonial history, and those who wanted Canada to adopt its own symbols for the future. This period was known as the Great Flag Debate.\n\nThis poster illustrates some of the different ideas that were proposed over the years as a national flag for Canada.\n\nOn October 22, 1964, the committee voted in favour of Stanley’s single-leaf concept. Two months later the House of Commons approved, followed shortly after by the Senate. The persuasive leadership of John Matheson, M.P., one of the flag committee’s pre-eminent members, is often credited with achieving consensus within the committee and helping to end the Great Flag Debate in Parliament.\n\nOnce it was confirmed as the winning proposal, Stanley’s concept was refined by the flag committee’s graphic artists and other design specialists to create the final design of the National Flag of Canada that we use today.\n\nSee the section on the birth of Canada’s National Flag – Who’s who to find out more about the many people involved in the creation of the flag.\n\n1965: A new national symbol is raised\n\nVideo\n\nWhy the maple leaf?"
