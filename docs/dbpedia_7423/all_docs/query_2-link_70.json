        "text": "You can now build the Titanic if you are a great power and research certain technologies.\n\nImproved the probability of Argentina being formed, now if it reaches a certain year the AI ​​​​does not need all its cores to make the decision.\n\nChanged the Prussian flag to the one of the time.\n\nArgentina can now also be formed with Entre Ríos and Corrientes if you have all the Argentine cores.\n\nCreated decision to form the Golden Circle for the Confederate States if they win the civil war.\n\nNow viceroyalties can be formed if there are claimed provinces without colonizing.\n\nAdded set of decisions for the Tanzimat reforms for the Ottoman Empire, the vanilla decision can be made once all the decisions that will reorganize the country little by little have been made. Also, if this decision is not made before a 1885, the empire will be dismantled.\n\nAdded decisions for the colonization of the Congo by Belgium if the vote of the major powers decides to cede the territory.\n\nNow the British Raj's decision turns India into a dominion and names it \"The Raj\", as well as changing its color to dark red.\n\nNow the territories you get from the Conquest of the Chaco depend on the territories you own in the area (Bolivia and Paraguay can dispute their part of the Chaco, with the disputed territory being obtained by whoever makes the decision first, although both will gain cores)\n\nAdded decision to change the flag to that of Russia between 1880 and 1900 through reforms that can only be taken if Nicholas II rules.\n\nModified the flags of the Ottoman Empire, the Italian countries and Imperial Japan to be more pleasing to the eye.\n\nExpanded the options for conquering the desert to avoid bordergore in the Sahara (Now all the desert is conquered with decisions)\n\nAdded decisions to give territories to the Spanish viceroyalties if you conquer any of their cores after forming them, so that if you conquer Florida for example, you can give them to the viceroyalty of New Spain.\n\nCreated an annexation event for African countries if they are in a European's sphere, to prevent some uncivilized countries from remaining on the continent years after the Berlin conference.\n\nAdded 3 decisions to claim Byzantine territories, one to acquire cores in the Balkans, one to obtain them in the Anatolian peninsula, and one to completely dismantle the Ottoman Empire.\n\nViceroyalties can now be formed if there are uncolonized claimed provinces, to avoid having to wait for the division of the Chaco, for example.\n\nAdded the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire through a congress through which the Balkans can be liberated in different ways, by choosing a host for the conference and then choosing the way of dismantlement.\n\nAdded the decision to organize Vietnam and Laos.\n\nChanged the flag of the Byzantine Empire to the historical one, that is yellow and red.\n\nNow the decision to found the national bank grants you benefits such as being able to take out larger loans and import cheaper goods from other countries.\n\nReworked the system of changing governments through events, modified small tweaks for a better game experience and more control over the form of government.\n\nNow when you form the Byzantine Empire, you are given cores in Macedonia and Albania, but the decision decreases less infamy (-8).\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo can only be taken once and only if Mexico is not a puppet or sub-state of other nation.\n\nAdded possibility of a second Opium War if the United Kingdom wins the first one and conquers Hong Kong.\n\nImproved the event chain of the Beijing convention, creating a new event to inform Russia if China accepts the treaty in which it obtains the russian cores in Manchuria.\n\nAdded changes to France's government throughout the century, depending on support from liberals, reactionaries, etc...\n\nUncivilized reforms that give you tech points when conquering now give you 0.05% more.\n\nAdded imperialist expansion decision in Indochina for major powers, plus a CB that unlocks with the decision.\n\nThe decision to colonize Algeria now has a chance to cause a war with France, as an event now triggers for the African country when making the decision.\n\nDutch expansion events in Indonesia now create wars where the attacker is the Netherlands and not the native countries of the area, so their allies are now excluded of the wars.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire can now be formed with any germanic country (Yes, I've finally added it permanently)\n\nSome of the mod's decision images have been changed, improving immersion and quality.\n\nThe annexation of Egypt by the great powers after the Berlin conference can now provoke a war, as the annexation of Ethiopia, that was also reworked for this version.\n\nThe CB for establishing protectorate and demanding concession now have two phases, costing more infamy in early-game and reducing its cost in late-game.\n\nOptimized flags of some countries that were taking up a lot of memory, changed also the flag of Austria to a less coloured one.\n\nChanged UI of the trade section, now the resources are better organized and therefore there is more space in case I want to add more in the future.\n\nChanged distribution of the regions in the northeast of France, now there is one more region and the \"Franche-Comté\" has been replaced by \"Ardennes\".\n\nNow in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the territories that the USA conquers from Mexico that are not core US are returned to Mexican hands.\n\nNow it is more likely that you will get the Berlin Conference event for the scramble for Africa if you are rank 1.\n\nAdded rebels at the start of the 1836 campaign in the USCA, making it easier for it to disintegrate.\n\nIn Mozambique the life rating is now lower, so the colonization of the area does not start at the start of the campaign.\n\nAI now cannot use small conquest CB, and player can only use it with civilized countries if it is civilized and with uncivilized if it is uncivilized.\n\nAdded Boer Wars translation\n\nFixed bug with rare annexation of Japan by any country intervening in Boshin War\n\nFixed bug with Argentina or some silver countries not joining when forming silver viceroyalty with Spain\n\nTranslated NEUTRALITY_EFFECT\n\nMexican flag is now the historical one\n\nNow in the CB for acquiring allied cores, the claimed states are indicated in peace\n\nNow the Texas flag is historical\n\nChanged some brightly colored vanilla flags\n\nInvention events in the WW1 campaign for the UK no longer jump.\n\nAI now buys the Gold Coast if it has the Ashanti region in possession, otherwise it does not make the decision.\n\nChanged the name of the

return to your ally is indicated in the CB of conquering allied cores\n\nNow the capitals are set correctly when forming viceroyalties with Spain\n\nFixed decision to form Iberia (Now it is formed correctly)\n\nNow the province of Lima does not have 3 life_rating.\n\nFixed armies of the WW1 campaign\n\nOptimized code of some vanilla files, solving bugs, inconsistencies, etc...\n\nNow Panama is independent in the 1914 campaign.\n\nThe decision to Create Budapest now has a custom image and not the generic one in vanilla.\n\nIn the Hungarian Rebellion event, Hungary's capital is correctly changed to Budapest, preventing the game from choosing a random province\n\nAdded custom oob to Spain in the 1914 campaign, solving the bug of the isolated armies in the Caribbean islands and the Philippines.\n\nSome bugged names like the \"Covilha\" province in Portugal that messed up the game map have been changed and now do not cause bugs\n\nFixed vanilla translation error in the trade tab when hovering over the resource price\n\nEast Timor is now not a core of Portugal\n\nIn the rebellion between Krakow and Austria, Krakow now does not call its allies to war, thus avoiding a full-scale
