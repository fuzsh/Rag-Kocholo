        "text": "Displaying American Flags Alongside Other Flags\n\nThe display of the American Flag alongside other flags is permissible, provided it adheres to the guidelines outlined in the Flag Code. These guidelines are established to ensure that the American Flag holds a position of prominence among other flags. Serving as the emblem of the United States government, the flag symbolizes the highest authority on American soil. Notably, it is customarily positioned above church flags, with only rare exceptions. Browse our collection of high-quality American Flags here.\n\nUnited States Flag Code & Etiquette\n\nGuidelines:\n\nAnother nation's flag shouldn't be displayed on the same halyard as the American Flag.\n\nIn a group of state, local and/or society flags, the American Flag should be flown highest and in the center.\n\nThe American Flag should be hoisted first and lowered last, when flown with other flags on adjacent staffs.\n\nIf the American Flag is carried in a procession with other flags, it should be to its own right or in the center of a line of flags.\n\nIf a state, local or society flags are flown on the same halyard with the American Flag, the American Flag should be at the top.\n\nWhen the American Flag is displayed against a wall with another flag, it should be on the (flag's own) right with its staff in front of the other flag.\n\nWhen displayed with other flags, the size of the American Flag should be larger than the other flags or relatively equal to the size of the largest flag. Other flags should not overshadow the American Flag in any way.\n\nThe American Flag should be flown higher than lesser flags. If the flags are displayed on the same level, the American Flag should be flown to the (flag's own) right of all other flags. The right is a position of prominence.\n\nIf the flags of other nations are displayed with the American Flag, they should be of equal size and at equal heights on separate staffs at a time of peace. The American Flag should be displayed to the (flag's own) right but not higher than other national flags.\n\nExceptions:\n\nIn any nation the national flag must be placed in a place of prominence. The flag code only applies to flags flown on American soil.\n\nA church pennant may be flown above the American Flag if a church service is done by naval chaplains at sea for personnel of the Navy. After the service is over, the American Flag must again be placed in the prominent position.\n\nIn foreign waters or to salute a foreign country, the U.S. Navy may fly the country's national flag on the masthead of the ship. This is not a violation of the flag code because the code only applies to civilians (not the Navy), and also because the stern and gaff of a ship are more prominent positions to fly a flag.\n\nThe United Nations' headquarters may fly the flags of all 188 member nations in alphabetical order. Although it is technically located within the United States (banks of the East River in Manhattan), the headquarters is owned by all the members of the United Nations, so it is not considered to be American soil.\n\nHow Should You Hang an American Flag?\n\nThe proper way to hang the American flag both traditionally and vertically is always with the union or blue field with the white stars in the top left from a visitor's perspective. This arrangement emphasizes the significance of the union and the fifty states. Explore and purchase one of our most popular flags here.\n\nCan You Hang Other Flags with the American Flag?\n\nCertainly, it is permissible to display additional flags alongside the American Flag. However, adherence to flag code and etiquette guidelines is essential. On American soil, the American Flag should consistently hold precedence or importance over any other flag. Specifically, this implies that when presenting multiple flags with the American flag, none should surpass it in size. The American flag must occupy the furthest left position or the highest point when viewed from a visitor's perspective. Browse our selection of diverse military flags available to hang alongside the American Flag here.\n\nHow Do You Present the American Flag Alongside Flags of Other Nations?\n\nIf you wish to showcase your American flag alongside flags from multiple countries or another country's flag, the same etiquette and flag code apply. On American soil, the American flag takes precedence over the flags of other countries. This means that the other country's flag should neither be larger nor positioned higher than the American flag, whether on the same or a different flagpole. In times of peace, both flags should ideally be of the same size and at the same height. Moreover, when displayed together, the American flag should be to the left from a visitor's perspective. When raising and lowering the flags at the start and end of the day, the American flag should be raised first and lowered last when accompanied by the flag of another country. Explore our collection of international flags available for purchase here.\n\nWhen Flying Two Flags Which Side Does the American Flag Go On?\n\nOn American soil, the American flag assumes precedence over any other flag flown alongside it. In practical terms, this implies that, when displayed together, the American flag should usually be positioned to the left from a visitor's perspective in relation to another flag. Explore our range of American Flags here.\n\nIn What Sequence Should Flags be Displayed?\n\nThe sequence for displaying flags is as follows: when the American flag is on American soil, it always takes precedence, requiring it to be the most prominent and significant among a group of flags. This entails positioning the American flag as the largest (unless displayed with another country's flag, in which case they can be of similar size), furthest left, and highest up. Following the American flag (from left to right), you may display another country's flag, state flags, military and public service flags, local flags, and finally, a company flag. It is essential to note that while state flags and POW/MIA flags can share the same flagpole as the American flag, a company flag should never be on the same flagpole. This is in accordance with the flag code, which explicitly prohibits the use of the American flag for advertising purposes. However, if you do choose to display advertising flags separately, we have a large selection available here.\n\nHow Do You Display the American Flag with the Marine Corps Flag?\n\nWhen displaying the American flag alongside the Marine Corps flag, ensure that the American flag is positioned either to the left of the Marine Corps flag or on a higher flagpole. Additionally, it's important to observe that the Marine Corps flag should not exceed the size of the American flag. Shop Marine Corps Flags from The United States Flag Store here.\n\nReferences\n\nU.S. Code, Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 7\n\nThe Care and Display of the American Flag by the Editors of SharpMan 2004.\n\nCopyright Â© 2009 Online Stores PA LLC All Rights Reserved."
