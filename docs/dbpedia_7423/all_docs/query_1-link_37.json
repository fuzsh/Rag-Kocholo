If so, crowns on Portuguese national flags were \"royal open\" from 1495 (D. Manuel) to 1577 (D. Sebasti찾o), \"closed, with three stems\" from 1577 to 1667 (D. Pedro II), \"closed, with five stems\" from 1667 to 1833 (D. Miguel) and \"closed, with five stems and a red beret inside\" from 1833 (but maybe since before) to 1910.\n\nAnt처nio Martins, 10 February 1998\n\nRoyal standard of King D.
