Changes in the flag in 1667

According to Carlos Noronha (and later confirmed from several sources), the crowns used in Portuguese flags and royal coats of arms from 1667 on had 5 instead of 3 "stems". If so, crowns on Portuguese national flags were "royal open" from 1495 (D. Manuel) to 1577 (D. Sebasti찾o), "closed, with three stems" from 1577 to 1667 (D. Pedro II), "closed, with five stems" from 1667 to 1833 (D. Miguel) and "closed, with five stems and a red beret inside" from 1833 (but maybe since before) to 1910.
