Giuseppe Gallo was born in Rogliano (Cosenza) in 1954, he lives and works in Rome.

Giuseppe Gallo's training as an artist was strongly influenced by his father, a restorer and enthusiastic amateur painter.

In 1976 Giuseppe moved to Rome to study architecture. In the same year he held his first solo exhibition at the Galleria Ferro di Cavallo. After being initially attracted to conceptual art, he later turned to reviving traditional painting, concentrating in particular on informal work.

In 1979 he made his debut on the International art scene presenting his works at Europa 79, in Stuttgart. In that year he joined Nunzio and together they established a studio in the former Pastificio Cerere in Via degli Ausoni, in the Roman quarter of San Lorenzo.

He subsequently enjoyed a six-year collaboration with Galleria Ferranti, in Rome, from 1978 to 1984.

In 1984 he held a solo show at the Sperone Westwater, in New York, a gallery which exhibited his works regularly thereafter. In 1986 he was invited to the Venice Biennale, where he returned in 1990 with his own space in the Italian pavilion.
