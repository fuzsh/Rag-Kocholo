        "text": "Giovanni de’ Medici (born April 6, 1498, Forli, Papal States [Italy]—died November 30, 1526, Mantua, marquisate of Mantua) was the most noted soldier of all the Medici.\n\nGiovanni belonged to the younger, or cadet, branch of the Medici, descended from Lorenzo, brother to Cosimo the Elder. Always in obscurity and, until the 16th century, held in check by the elder line, this branch first entered the arena of history when the other was on the point of extinction. Its first major figure, in fact, was this valiant captain of the papal forces, Giovanni de’ Medici. His father was Giovanni, son of Pierfrancesco, who was the son of Lorenzo. Though christened Lodovico, the child took his father’s name of Giovanni, his father having died soon after his birth. Trained to arms from his earliest years, this youth inherited all the energy of his mother, Caterina, whose Sforza blood seemed to infuse new life into the younger branch of the Medici. Having first fought for Pope Leo X against Francesco Maria della Rovere (1516–17) and against the French (1521), he took service with the French in 1522, went over to the emperor’s side in 1523, but returned to the French service in 1525 (before the Battle of Pavia). In 1526 he entered the army of the League of Cognac against the emperor but was mortally wounded in battle near Mantua on November 25 and died five days later. His bande nere, or “black bands,” were named from the black banners that they began to carry in mourning for Leo X."
