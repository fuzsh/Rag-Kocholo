        "text": "On the five hundredth anniversary of the birth of Cosimo l de' Medici, the Island of Elba makes preparations to celebrate this important moment. For the 2019 edition, year when also the 450th anniversary of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was celebrated, the events concerning the celebration of \"Le Vie dei Medici\" (a project financed as a way of discovering and placing the correct value on the medici accomplishments, brought to life by the Region and in collaboration with Italia Nostra Toscana) will be particularly significant.\n\nCosimo l de' Medici was the second and last Duke of Florence, from 1537 to 1569, and when he was promoted from Duke of Florence to Grand Duke of Tuscany, he was the first Grand Duke of Tuscany, from 1569 until his death in 1574.\n\nHe was born in Florence on June 12th 1519 his father was Giovanni, known also as \"Bande Nere\", a descendant of the Medici family, and his mother, Maria Salviati was a direct descendant on her mother's side of the same family and also niece of Leone X.\n\nWhen his ancestor Alessandro de' Medici died, murdered by his cousin Lorenzino, Cosimo inherited the title of duke of Florence at the tender age of 17, despite his not being a direct descendant of the family. He quickly gained more and more political importance and in no time proved to have a passion for politics as well as a keen desire to expand to the point that the name Grand Duchy of Tuscany acquired the title of State - what today we know as Region - starting from diplomatic contacts and moving on to having palaces and fortresses built.\n\nCosimo l de' Medici has left ever lasting traces all over Tuscany, above all on the Island of Elba where he built Cosmopoli: one of the most magnificent and important fortress-cities in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe five hundredth anniversary of his birth is therefore a very important event for the Island of Elba so it will be celebrated with walks along the historical city, concerts, art exhibitions, congresses and historical re-makes so you can follow the steps taken in the creation of Cosmopoli.\n\nCalendar of the special events on the Island of Elba\n\nApril 28th at 16.30 - De Laugier Cloister\n\nPlacing of commemmorative marble (gift of the Institute of the Knights of Santo Stefano).\n\nMay 2nd and 3rd at 10.00 - Old part of Portoferraio\n\nGuided historical walk with Giuseppe M.
