        "text": "Our story begins back in the 1980s when Giuseppe, a winegrower’s son born in Veneto, set out on a journey to explore the wines of Italy. Like many young people in the region, he started to work in the vineyards at a young age. Harvest after harvest, his passion for wine grew.\n\nHe set off to train as an oenologist in Tuscany, the iconic region of the famous Chianti.\n\nOver the course of his travels, he gradually became a specialist in the terroirs of Italy. He also used his journeys as a means of finding the best crus in each region.\n\nIn Abruzzo, he encountered a renowned Michelin-starred chef who introduced him to culinary specialities and showed him how to extract the very best from the simplest of ingredients. This encounter made him realise that it was the quality of the base grapes that would produce the best wines.\n\nDuring his stay in Piedmont, he met a truffle producer and developed a passion for that product. What an amazing discovery! The age-old culture of truffle production and the excellence of the cuisine derived from it – this delicious, refined product cultivated by such simple people so close to the land and then enhanced even further by the very best chefs… it was an inspiration!\n\nHe then realised the importance of fully understanding the soil and the terroir when making quality products. Like grapes, truffles are the reflection of a terroir and define the very essence of a region.\n\nIn Emilia Romagna, Giuseppe made the acquaintance of an Italian family and was lucky enough to be invited to a family feast. La Mamma and la Nonna cooked together for the whole family… and what a treat it was!\n\nA platter of Prosciutto di Parma and Parmigiano Reggiano as antipasti whetted everyone’s appetite. The primo piatto consisted of a dish of pasta alla Bolognese, followed by the secondo piatto, a beautiful veal roast with oven-baked potatoes. And the cherry on the cake, the dolce: a delicious chestnut-based dessert. All washed down with Lambrusco dell’Emilia, of course!\n\nThis enjoyable occasion confirmed his taste for Italian-style conviviality and his desire to show the world that Italian food and wine can be accessible to everyone… provided that you’re a little curious!"
