The notes on the journey through France and Italy as far as Bologna and Florence are taken from the notebook in Gray's handwriting in the possession of Mr John Murray; the notes on Florence (from the Palazzo Pitti onwards) and Naples are taken from the reprint in D.C. Tovey's Gray and His Friends (which are themselves taken from manuscript pages in the possession of Eton College); while the notes on Rome are taken from Volume IV of the 1836 edition of John Mitford's edition of Gray's Works (for which there appears to be no manuscript source).\n\nThe objective in printing these notes has been to make them available in a research document. There is a case in such a document for an exact transcript but, in order to make the notes more readable, I have taken some typographical liberties, without altering the wording of the text.\n\nGray's punctuation, like that of many eighteenth-century writers, was idiosyncratic and unsystematic. He is particularly prone in these notes to the use of varying numbers of dashes to indicate breaks and pauses, without grammatical significance. I have, therefore, standardized these usages to one dash for each pause. His use of italics (underlining in the manuscript) is also irregular. I have therefore had to adopt my own system. In order to make the lists more readable, I have used italics (a) for titles, (b) for the names of artists, and (c) for words from foreign languages. I have also used bold type with placenames (on their first occurrence). The asterisks which appear are Gray's, presumably to indicate important works, though he also seems inconsistent in his use of them. Since Gray moves in and out of Latin and Italian with some frequency, assuming the reader's comprehension, these have also had to be accompanied sometimes\n\n7\n\nwith short explanations in square brackets. I have been obliged to omit some paragraph numbering, since it was unsequential in the original, and I have, on occasion, broken up stretches of writing into new paragraphs and set the lists of paintings into hanging paragraphs, with the objective of making the spread on the page both less daunting and more methodical. I have also varied the size of the font, using 12-point for narrative, 11-point in lists, and 10-point in notes. Finally, I have added end-notes to explain as many of Gray's references as I could; the only footnotes are Gray's own. The endnotes are not exhaustive or authoritative but are meant to indicate the extent of Gray's field of reference. The defence for them is that Gray is always allusive, in his prose as in his poetry, and that he offers the fullest rewards when the allusions are tracked down and the full range of his field of reference is revealed.\n\nAt times, Gray's notes on his tour, as they catalogue the paintings that he saw, have the limited interest of any list. His comments on paintings are often stylized and betray the prejudices of the period, but they are always thoughtful, often animated, sometimes challenging. There is scope in these lists for many errors, both by Gray, as he may have wrongly identified paintings, and by myself, as I stray out of my own literary specializations in attempting to cope with the names of painters unknown to me or now known by different names. However, what is extraordinary is the knowledge of this 23-year-old and the pertinacity and intellectual stamina of his exploration of Renaissance art. It is perhaps no wonder that his companion, Horace Walpole, seems eventually to have tired of this relentless daily examination of galleries and museums. I have done my best, with the help of Groves' Dictionary of Art and Bénézit's Dictionnaire des Peintres, to check, footnote, and list the artists that Gray mentions, though some have eluded me. Many of the palazzi that Gray visited have changed in use and many of the pictures that Gray saw are now relocated or scattered in galleries across the affluent western world; some will have been lost or destroyed. No doubt a thesis could be written on this diaspora.\n\nGray's notes (which were not intended for publication) do not have\n\n8\n\nthe original vision or illuminating diction of the notebooks of the travels in the Lakes or Scotland. But, besides having the historical value of an intelligent and early record of a Grand Tour, they do show aspects of Gray's character, his encyclopaedic knowledge, his familiarity with the classics, his interests in science, that are valuable in constructing the persona which we need to have in approaching his poetry. Reconstructing Gray's experience from this incomplete record also gives an opportunity to revisit places made too familiar by modern tourism and to recreate attitudes and sensations which have been left behind but which may still have their values.\n\nPerhaps this apologia amounts to saying that this is not a book to read, following the usual practice of that occupation, but it is a document that needs to be known about by eighteenth- century scholars and it does offer much as a resource.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI wish to thank Mr John Murray for his permission to transcribe and print the Gray notebook and Mrs Virginia Murray for her help in making the manuscript available. I should also like to thank Canon Walter Ewbank of Carlisle for his assistance in tracing and translating Latin and Greek quotations.\n\n9\n\n1.\n\nRHEIMS.\n\nCHIEF city of Champagne, 3rd in France for bigness, water'd by the little River Vele [mod.

Lay. An ugly old town, with suburbs bigger than itself.\n\nBeautiful way, commonly on the side of a hill, cover'd with woods, the river Marne winding in the vale below, and Côteaux cover'd with vines riseing gently on the other side: fine prospect of the town of Joinville, with the castle on the top of a mountain, overlooking it, dined at a village, called Vignoris [mod. Vignory]. Ruins of an old Castle on the brow of a mountain, whose sides are cover'd with woods.\n\nLangres. Lay au Cerf volant. A small city on a high hill. The Bishop is Duke, and Peer of France, the Cathedral, an ill-shaped old structure with one square tower, and one spire in front, dedicated to St Mammet - Tombs of the bishops, some of Bronze, but unadorn'd - that\n\n12\n\nof Card: Gesuves, with his figure of Bronze kneeling.\n\nEnter'd Burgundy at a village, called Ghil. Passed through a fine fertile plain by an Avenue of Lime trees, that leads to:\n\nDijon. - 4 days - a la Croix d'or. The Capital of the Dutchy, a very small, but beautiful city, of an oval form, full of People of Quality, and a very agreeable Society. Palais des États, a magnificent new building - the Vestibule, and grand Staircase fine - the Chappel small and unfinished, Altar of various beautiful marbles; Gates and wainscoting of handsome Menuiserie [carpentry] - Chamber of the States, Throne of blew velvet sprinkled with Gold Fleurs de Lis; Picture of the King under it. Palais du Roy, a large handsome structure, built in the beginning of the Late King's Reign on the ground, where stood the Palace of the ancient Dukes of Burgundy, a tower of the old building left standing from whose top you have a fine prospect of the City, and its Environs. The Duke of Bourbon is lodged here, when he comes every 3 years to hold the Assembly of the States, it is wholly unfurnish'd. Before it is The Place; lieing in a Semicircle, neatly built, a huge equestrian statue of Louis 14 of Bronze, in the midst of it. Into this leads on one side the Rue de Condé, a street of regular new Houses, 4 stories high, the entrance of every Shop is an Arch. Church of St. Michael, fine front in the latter Gothic taste. Church of the Cordeliers, much adorn'd, several handsome modern tombs. Church of the Bernardines, a neat Dome, cover'd with tiles of various colours. Abbey of St. Benigne, in it an ancient Christian church, composed of 3 vaults one upon another, that are supported by 104 pillars, forming a kind of Rotonda, which receives its light from an opening in the top.\n\nThe Chartreuse, a quarter of a mile out of the town thro' an alley of Limes. In their chappel are the tombs of Philip le Hardi, and Jean Sanspeur, Duke of Burgundy, with his Dutchess, Margaret of Bavaria, both these monuments are much in the same taste, the 3 figures are of\n\n13\n\nwhite marble, but painted to represent the life: the body of the tombs of black marble finely polish'd, and the sides adorn'd with hundreds of small figures, representing all the Religious Orders in various attitudes of Grief. The Parc, about a mile from the City thro' a double Avenue of fine Limetrees. It is a charming place, laid out into an Etoile with high hedges of Hornbeam, and Grass-Walks, a Mall, and a Parterre intermixed with tall Fir trees; on one side runs the River Ouche, across which is an old house of the Dukes, called La Colombiere, the other sides command a view of the town, and country adjacent.\n\nPassed thro' Nuys [Nuits St George] & Beaune, 2 small cities near which grow the best wines of Burgundy, a most fertile, & beautiful country cover'd with vineyards, & fruit-trees, went without stopping thro' Chalons sur Saône, a large city, tolerably handsome. Lay at Mâcon. From Chalons, hither, one has commonly in sight the Saône, glideing very slowly thro' a delightful country. From the top of Mount Tornus you have a noble prospect of that River with the province of La Bresse on the other side of it, & the town of Tornus with the rich Abbey of St Philibert below you.\n\nThro' Villefranche, a little City, but the capital of the Beaujolois. This Province, & the Lionnois are fine countries, laid out into enclosures, full chiefly of Hemp, Buck-wheat, and Maize, with some few Vines. A charming view in descending a very steep Hill just before you come to Lyons, of the Fauxbourgs of that City, the Saône, & the little mountains about it, covered with Convents, Houses and Gardens of the Bourgeois.\n\nLions. Lodged à l'Hotel de Bourgogne, pres de la Grande Place, a fortnight.\n\nPrincipal quarters of that great city lie in a Peninsula formed by the confluence of the Rhône and Saône, a Stone bridge of 18 Arches laid\n\n14\n\nover the first, which runs with extreme rapidity, and is full of Islands, joins this, and the Fauxbourg de la Guillotiere: another stone bridge, and 3 wooden ones over the Saône connect it with the rest of the City, and Suburbs, which lie mostly on the declivity of several very steep hills, the streets are generally extreme narrow & the houses high, but the whole enliven'd by its great Populousness & Commerce. The best prospects are from the Chartreuse, & St Marie de Fourviere. See Les Antiquités de Lyon par le Père Colonia en 2 vol: 12 mo.[duodecimo]\n\nL'Hotel de Ville\n\nLe College de Jesuites, leur Église, leur Bibliotheque, & leur Cabinet\n\nLa Place de Bellecour\n\nLa Mignature sur Fourviere\n\nL'Église des Carmelites &c. &c.\n\n15\n\n3.\n\nFrom Lyons to Geneva, thro' Dauphine and Savoy.\n\n5 Days, (en Voiture) & a half. First night at La Verpillier, a poor Village. 2nd Day entered Savoy at Pont-Beauvoisin, lay at Echelles. The road runs over a Mountain, which gives you the first tast of the Alps, in it's magnificent rudeness, and steep precipices: set out from Echelles on horseback to see the Grande Chartreuse2, the way to it up a vast mountain, in many places the road not 2 yards broad; on one side the rock hanging over you, & on the other a monstrous precipice. In the bottom runs a torrent, called Les Guiers morts, that works its way among the rocks with a mighty noise, and frequent Falls. You here meet with all the beauties so savage and horrid a place can present you with; Rocks of various and uncouth figures, Cascades pouring down from an immense height out of hanging Groves of Pine-Trees, & the solemn Sound of the Stream, that roars below, all concur to form one of the most poetical scenes imaginable: this continues for 2 leagues, and then (within a little of the mountain's top) you come to the Convent itself, which is only considerable for it's situation, & bigness. It contains about 100 Fathers, and Freres together, & 200 Servants. All is extremely neat, but in the greatest Simplicity; the Offices are remarkable for their contrivance, and cleanliness. 2 Fathers are appointed to entertain Strangers, if they please, dureing 3 days. They are served with Fish, Butter, Cheese, Fruits, and Wine, all perfectly good in their kind. We dined there, and returned in the afternoon to Échelles.\n\nPassed thro' a road made with infinite labour thro' a mountain called La Grotte. At the beginning of it, is erected a monument with an inscription, to inform you, it was done by Order of Charles Emanuel the 2d, D: of Savoy. Chambéri is a very little, and a very bad town, tho' the Capital of the Dutchy; the vale of Savoy, and the hills that confine it seem pretty well cultivated, and exhibit various agreeable\n\n16\n\nViews to the eye: the road very stony, and ill kept. Lay at Aix, once famous for its hot-baths; there are some Roman remains about them.\n\nCame to Annecy, where resides the exiled bishop of Geneva. It is a little city, situated upon a pretty Lake.\n\nComeing down from the mountains you have a fine prospect of the plain country, Geneva, and it's lake. The contrast between the poverty, and misery of Savoy, and the happiness of that little Republic is very strikeing. In one you see indeed beautiful vallies, but inhabited by nothing but ragged, and bare-footed Peasants, and those in no great number, in the other all is neat, and well-cloathed; the city itself has a compact, and military Air, and swarms with People, that have business in their faces. Part of it lies in an Island form'd by the Rhone, which seems almost as large here as at Lyon, and runs with an extreme rapidity. Geneva forms a semicircle at one end of the Lake, and from thence makes a very pretty appearance. The buildings are generally very neat, and substantial. The Greille [grating] and Ramparts are extremely pleasant for walking; the Lake, and its borders charming. They take Trout in it of 50 Pound weight, and more, which are sent ready dress'd by the Post into France and Spain.\n\n17\n\n4.\n\nTurin\n\nTurin - a week - á l'Auberge Royale. The straitness of the streets, which in the new quarter are wholly laid out by the line, as it contributes much to the beauty of this City, so it makes it appear much smaller, than it really it is, for at your first entrance you see quite through it. The Strada del Po is near ½ a mile long with a handsome Corndore [Arcade] on both sides from one end to the other, & is terminated by a fine Doric Gate, that leads to the Po, which runs not a quarter of a mile from the Town. Just on the other side of it is a Convent of Capucins upon an eminence, which commands a view of the City, but this & a Monastery (called La Superga, founded on a high hill & richly adorned with marble by the late Victor Amadeus after the Battle of Turin) I unluckily had no opportunity of seeing. the buildings here in general are of brick, either plaister'd or intended to be so (for in those that are not, the holes of the scaffolding are all left unstopt) & generally of some regular order, 7 Story high for the length of whole Streets: the Windows are oil'd Paper, which is often torn & has a very ill Effect to the eye. Many great Houses the Architecture but indifferent, but altogether makes a good Appearance enough. The prince of Cavignan's Palace is very vast. The Piazza di Carlo is a pretty Square: on two of its Sides are Portico's, surrounded by Bodies of regular building; on one of the other's the Church of St Christina, which is neat enough; & a View runs across it, quite from the Porta Nuova to the Palace of the King [Palazzo Reale]. This Palace is of brick, like to the rest, the front plaister'd, not very large; runs round one square Court, & a Garden behind it. The appartments are small, but as magnificent as Gilding, Inlaying, Mirrours, & Painting can make them. The parquets are indeed very fine, the Queen's Closet, & some other Rooms have fine inlayed Work of an Artist now liveing at Turin in Ivory, & Mother of Pearl upon Ebony. Here is a pretty numerous collection of Pictures, the most considerable of which are:\n\n18\n\nThe Rape of the Sabines - Paul Veronese.\n\nSolomon & the Queen of Sheba - Paul Veronese.\n\n2 very large Pictures, great number of Figures some fine, but little Grace or Propriety. there are some more of this Master.\n\nSeveral capital ones of Bassan, with Cattle, Poultry, & Rustick figures.\n\nSome of Titian, Portraits. These are in a Gallery with some Antique Busts, not considerable; at each end are Door-Cases with Pillars of a fine yellow Marble.\n\nIn several other Rooms:\n\nK. Charles the 1st of England standing, Whole Length, in the Habit of the Time - Vandike - a fine Picture. there is much Architecture in it, possibly of some other hand, but exceeding good.\n\nA Riposo; Boy Angels pulling Palm-Branches, which are all wither'd with the heat of the Sun, to shade the Madonna: a small Picture; very fine - Albano.\n\nRubens, embraceing his Wife, by himself. Half-figures.\n\nThe Elements of Albano. Greatly esteem'd, but I think not so fine as that above mention'd.\n\nMany others, called Vandyke, Titian, Rubens, &c. Several good Flemish & Dutch pictures. Many pieces of Solymini: his usual, unnatural, strange Colouring.\n\nIn a Cabinet of the King's Appartment:\n\nMiniatures; they are Portraits after Vandyke, Titian, &c by Padre Ramelli, a Religious now alive, inchased in the Wainscoting, some of 'em extreme beautiful: they are all he ever did.\n\nIn an Alcove, opposite to the Window, with Glass Doors, in a small round is fix'd in the Wall a Madonna with Angels, very beautiful, Carlo Marat.\n\nIn another Chamber:\n\nCharles the 1st's Children with a Dog. Vandike.\n\nThe Palace of the Duke of Savoy joins this; one of its Fronts is a good handsome Structure. Here many pictures are; of no value, except 4 great Views of a Palace intended to have been built at Rivoli; by Paolo Pennini.\n\n19\n\nJust by is the Royal Academy, 3 fine Galleries, one over another on two sides of a large Area are the Students' Lodgings, & the Appartments open upon them. Another side is fill'd by a building where the Archives are deposited: in one of the Rooms is kept the Isiack Table3 so well known. It was taken in Pope Clement the 7th's time in the Sacking of Rome, & carried to Mantua where it came into Cardinal Bembo's possession, who presented it to this Court. It is of a dark, Metallic composition with Silver Figures inlaid in it, & well preserved. Here are also many Volumes in MS: of Pirro Ligorio with Drawings after ancient Paintings & Bas-Reliefs: not very good, but rare. The 4th side is taken up by a noble Theatre, which the King is building. In the Strada del Po under a Portico, which runs round the Area of the University are fix'd in the wall many antique Inscriptions & Bas-Reliefs, that have been dug up hereabouts. Among them is one called a Bacchanal, but seems a Cassandra. She is naked, except a little loose Drapery, that falls from one Arm upon her legs. Her back is turn'd towards you but her head is thrown back so as to show a fine Profile; she kneels with one knee upon a square Altar, & holds in her hand a small figure of Pallas: behind her is a bust of an old Man on a Column. This Bas-Relief is of polish'd Pavian marble in a good Greek taste. Figure is not a foot high - All these antiquities are rang'd by C.Scipio Maffei.\n\nThe Church of St Phillipo Neri is building of white Marble; the Inside is finish'd, & beautifully adorn'd. The Court were at La Venerie, a Palace 2 or 3 Leagues from Turin.\n\nThrough Moncallier, which is a Palace, an ancient brick building on an eminence, where the Duke of Savoy then was - lay at Asti, a small City.\n\nPass'd thro' Alexandria, a large city situated on the River Tanaro in a rich & beautiful Plain, & strongly fortified. Here is held a famous Fair. Lay at Novi, the first Town in the Genoese State; it is well\n\n20\n\npeopled, & seem'd full of business. The road hither execrably bad, like most of those in Lombardy dureing the winter.\n\nPassed the mountains; a bleak & uncomfortable prospect of barren Tops of hills, the highest of 'em called the Bouquet, over which the road winds, supplies Genoa with that beautiful Marble, speckled with Green, White, & Black, which you see in their Churches, & Palaces: the Rocks, as you go along, appear all of that hue, & huge rough blocks of it frequently are seen at the doors of little Villages, that lie hereabouts. After you have passed this the Road runs thro' a Plain, full of vein'd Pebbles of several Colours. You cross the Torrent, called Ponziera (wch passes by Genoa) above 20 times & at last you come into the magnificent Fauxbourg of that City; I believe, it is a little mile long with many noble Villa's on either hand, with their gardens & marble decorations. There is a sort of Terrace here in use, that I have not before seen; on the top of their high walls next the street, runs a row of marble Columns of a regular order; between 'em are Statues, or Orange trees plac'd, & on them rests a frame of Trellis-work, which is cover'd with Vines, or Jessamine; these have a noble effect, as have the Porticoes, that many of their houses are flanked with; they are usually even with the 2nd Story, supported by tall pillars of white Marble; and Balustrades of the same, with cielings of Stucco, white figures on a grey ground: they look cool, & stately. The Gates are commonly lofty arches, thro' which you have a view of the Vestibule, the square area surrounded by galleries upon which the appartments open, with double flights of Steps, that lead up unto them, & another opposite arch, that discovers to you, either the gardens behind, or a Nich with a Statue, & Fountain, or some piece of painting in perspective to represent one or the other. This is the general form of their palaces both without & within the City, & some of them are wholly built of marble, as that of the Duke D'Oria in the Strada Nuova &c: others have their Porticoes, Stuccoes & Terrasses of it, as the Prince Doria's, the Pal: Durazzo in the Strada Balbi, & that which this last-named Family have bestowed on the Jesuits, where the\n\n21\n\n3 galleries are supported by 96 Columns of white marble, each of one single block; & all the magnificent Staircases, with two Lions on each hand of the principal one (they are big as the life, crouching, & in admirable taste) are wholly of the same materials. There are abundance more adorn'd in the same manner; & none at all, that have not the Door, & Window-Cases of it. The City surrounds its Port, which is semicircular, entirely, and appears from the Sea, like a most stately Theatre, it's houses and palaces, Churches, & Porticoes gradually rising one above another & intermix'd with Gardens & Terrasses full of Oranges, Vines, Lemons, & Cypress-Trees. The declivity of it's situation, tho' it adds much to the beauty of the prospect, is a great inconvenience in reality, the streets being all too narrow & too steep to admit of Coaches; however, they are always clean and well paved. The mountains, that rise close behind it, rather set off than diminish it's beauty by their naked & barren appearance. At the Western gate is a very high Watch-tower & from hence runs a handsome Terrace along by the Sea-side for a great way; here Coaches can drive & enjoy a noble view of a part of the City with that beautiful Bay, which is usually cover'd with Vessels of all Sizes.\n\n22\n\n5.\n\nGenoa\n\nAlla Sta. Martha. A week.\n\nThe next day was the feast of the Madonna della Vigne; we went in the morning to her Church: her Statue dress'd with jewels & altar finely lighted up. On the right side of the great Altar was a State for the Doge; he came, attended by the Senate. He was dress'd in long robes of crimson Damask, & a little Sattin Bonnet, his Pages of Honour wore short slash'd doublets of green & gold, & little Spanish Cloaks of Crimson Velvet laced: the Senate in black. A Lady of Quality set at a table to receive the charities for the redemption of Captives. Mass was celebrated to a fine Concert of musick; Agostini4, Scalzi5 & the Bolognese boy sung. The Churches of St Siro, & that of St Ambrosio called Il Giésu, are on the inside adorned with vast quantities of various Marbles, many of them exquisitely beautiful; the Columns of the first are remarkable for their diameter & height, and are all of as many single blocks of Carrara-Marble polished: the latter is cover'd with Mosaicks of many fine kinds of it.\n\nHere at one of the side Altars is a noble picture of Guido. The Assumption*. Above 20 figures near as big as life, fine airs of heads & expressions of wonder below. The Virgin in a bright heaven above with vast beauty & devotion in the face, her hands cross'd upon her breast; white drapery in great noble folds. Angels round her adoreing with such airs & faces as one sees only in this Master's works. The preservation & the light pretty good. It is a good deal resembling his fine one in Sr Robert Walpole's Collection, the subject there is called, Doctors disputeing on the Immaculate Conception.6\n\nIn the opposite chapel is, The St Ignatius Loyola*, of Rubens; that Saint is represented as cureing a Woman possessed. She is in violent convulsions, her head flung back all pale, with eyes full of rage & distorted features, & two Men hold her with extreme difficulty; another woman is\n\n23\n\nimploreing his assistance for her. He is in prayer looking upward with a chearful & confident air; some of his disciples stand on each side of him: these are somewhat raised above the rest of the figures. A woman with 2 children is stepping up towards them; her purple drapery particularly good. Another woman in the corner, stooping towards her child, which lies upon the ground, is a finely painted figure. It is a very fine picture.\n\nNear the great altar is another of Rubens, not good: I forget the subject -\n\nIn one of the most elevated parts of the City stands the Church, called Ste Maria in Carignano; you come to it over a bridge of 5 or 6 arches of a prodigious height; it is laid across a deep valley & looks nobly. This was built by the noble family of Sauli, as was the Church & 12 Canons handsomely endowed at the same time. It is a large fabrick with a Dome & two towers in front. The inside neatly but plainly adorned with Stucco: the altars of white marble, as are the Portal & the Balustrades that run round the outsides of the Cupola.\n\nAt the first altar is St Francis at prayers; his companion sleeping at a distance: it is a savage place & the colouring proper to such a scene - a good Picture - Guercino -\n\nMadonna with Angels, St Francis & St Carlo kneeling on each side, a dark strong manner. a little Cherub kissing the foot of the Virgin, is exquisite - G.C. Procaccino.\n\nThe next is somewhat of Cambiaso -\n\nMartyrdom of a Saint: they are drawing him up by the wrists with a Pully. The soul of some other saint (a young & graceful figure) born by Angels above, a woman sitting upon the ground turns aside her head to weep. Expression like the Domenichino, Colouring & Angels like Guido. Extremely fine - Carlo Marat.\n\nThe high Altar I do not remember -\n\nMagdalen dying: a Bishop is bringing her the Sacrament, an Angel holds a torch. She is quite pale & expiring, supported by Angels very good - F. Vanni.\n\nThe rest are modern hands, Franchescini, &c: Piola -\n\nUnder the Cupola are 4 Statues vastly large. 2 of them, the St. Christopher, & B. Alessandro Sauli are of Puget, & have a great air.\n\n24\n\nFrom the top of this church one has a noble view of the City, & the Sea: they say in a clear day, one may discover Corsica from it. The Church called The Annonciata is a fine structure not yet finish'd on the Outside; the Inside as rich as Gilding, Painting, & Marble can make it, over the great door is:\n\nThe Last Supper, very large & well preserved, a great many figures, 'tis dark but very fine - G. Cesar Procaccino.\n\nAll the other pictures are modern - Lomellini7 -\n\nSt Fillipo Neri is a very rich & beautiful Church, the Altars admirably disposed & adorned with Marble of all Sorts. Here every Sunday is an Oratorio - St Lorenzo, the Dome - a great Gothick Pile, built of black and white marble, laid alternately. The shrine of St John the Baptist here is very fine. St Francesco is another old church; on the left side, the next chappel to the high altar has a strange Picture, designed to represent The Immaculate Conception. The Virgin (a good figure) is standing in the Clouds, supported by Angels. Opposite to her is God the Father, flying down in an odd attitude: he is naked as far as the middle, & a little angel seems about to uncover him still lower. Below is a Dragon with 7 heads, & other allegorical representations, it is by Tintoret -\n\nThe two noblest Streets in Genoa are those called the Strade Nuova & Balbi. They are neither of them very long, or wide; but have on each side 6 or 7 of the most beautiful palaces.\n\nPalazzo Durazzo.\n\nThe view thro' this is vastly grand; it is very large, & abundance of noble appartments, exquisite marble Tables, Cabinets &c: here are several fine pictures, among the rest:\n\nSeneca dying*; pretty dark, strongly color'd, like the Carracci; the Philosopher himself is the least good figure, those that are supporting him,\n\n25\n\n& the others writeing down his words, are admirable; there are 4 or 5 of them, full as big as the life. The finest I have seen - Luca Giordano.\n\nIn the same room, & in a quite different manner are:\n\nSofronia & Olindo tyed to the Stake, Clorinda arriving8 - Ditto;\n\nPerseus with Medusa's head, many turned into stone - Ditto\n\nSeveral Rooms furnished with Paintings upon silk after Designs of Rafaël; they are the same with those of his Bible in the Vatican, but as large as life -\n\nThe Lady in green velvet & gold, Ritratto [portrait], whole length, Vandike.\n\nAdam & Eve, Cam. Procaccino -\n\nChrist* at the supper of Simeon, Magdalen anointing his feet. Many figures; the 2 principal ones very ungraceful. Paolo Veronese.\n\nA Gallery with a range of antique Statues on each side, Nymph & Satyr, the heads good - Mercury standing, a gentile figure. Less than life - Hebe, a goblet in one hand, grapes in the other, much discolour'd but the drapery very fine, & natural.\n\nIn another gallery among other things, are some small antiques about a foot & ½ high -\n\nA Laocoön. His 2 sons are here very young children, that which he raises up in one arm is admirable -\n\nRape of Helen; or else a Roman Soldier with a Sabine. He is carrying her off in his arms, & she seems not much unwilling. A very gentile Groupe.\n\nCleopatra naked; she is standing & applying the aspic to her breast. There is a largeness & want of delicacy in the limbs: the head & attitude extremely good. They are of white marble.\n\nPalazzo Balbi.\n\nThe furniture here also is of much beauty, especially the Marble. Among the Pictures, which are numerous, are:\n\nSt Matthew, an Angel discourseing with him. Infinite grace & loveliness - large as life - Guido -\n\n26\n\nSt John in the wilderness. A good figure: but not like the other it's Companion - Ditto -\n\nVenus asleep with Boys, big as the life. The Drawing not quite right & no great Grace. It looks like Guercino but is called, Annibal Carracci -\n\nAnother Venus reposing, not asleep, Small, very fine.\n\nSome of Titian's School -\n\nSt Jerom in the Desert, in his first dark manner - Guido.\n\nSt Francis at Prayers, fine - Agostino Carracci -\n\nJoseph in Prison, telling the Baker's fortune - Guercino.\n\nAndromeda, she is not naked but has a thin white drapery, her attitude wants dignity. Perseus in the clouds on the winged horse. Execrable! - Ditto -\n\nConversion of St Paul; a very large picture; figures all huddled together & Christ (as it were) tumbling out of the Clouds upon them. Vast want of dignity in the whole (as usual) but finely painted & with a force of colouring9 - Michelang: Caravaggio.\n\nA Christ bound, & crown'd with thorns - Vandike -\n\nChrist praying in the garden. Small; called Rafaël.\n\nMadonna, small, in a border of flowers - Vandike.\n\nHoly Family - Rubens.\n\nChrist, & St John, Boys - Small, very good, Rubens -\n\nFinding of Cyrus - Castiglione -\n\nPortrait of a Lady (same with that at the Durazzo, but sitting) - Vandike.\n\nA Doge of the family, half length, fine, Paul Veronese.\n\nA Man in armour, on horse-back. Very little - Vandike.\n\nHead of a Girl, a Ritratto, dark but exquisite - Ann. Carracci.\n\nIn the Gallery.\n\nLucrece, head & hands; such beauty, & dignity! It is divine - Guido.\n\nArtemisia10, it's companion, a fine face, but no expression. A Turbant on the head, & Goblet in the hand. Ditto.\n\nHoly Family - Rafaël.\n\nAnother - Correggio.\n\nAnother - Parmeggiano.\n\nAnother - Vandike.\n\nAnother - Castiglione.\n\nAssumption - Guido.\n\nA Saint - Ditto.\n\n27\n\nMan in Armour - Correggio.\n\nThese & last are small pictures, all of a size, all fine & kept cover'd with Glasses -\n\nTemptation of St Anthony, vastly comical; there are Devils in the shape of Church-Steeples, Hillocks, & Trees - Brueghel.\n\nVandike's Wife sitting, her child upon her knee, not handsome, they both have great Ruffs on -\n\nPortrait of One of the Spinola's in Armour, with grey hair, half-length, extremely good - Vandike -\n\nVandike himself. Same size. The gentilest attitude, & finest head in the world. Exquisite! It does not at all resemble that Sr Andrew Fountain11 has! T'is not so young, nor at all the same face -\n\nThere are several others of this Master in the Palace: he painted here 4 months -\n\nPalazzo Brignole.\n\nJesus driveing the buyers & sellers out of the Temple, a large picture - Guercino.\n\nRape of the Sabines - Tempesta.\n\nSofronia & Olinda - Cav. Calabrese -\n\nSt Sebastian, half-length, the same with the Grand Duke's, called also an original of Guido -\n\nJudith & Holofernes, an ungraceful picture - Paul Veronese.\n\nJacob* travelling with all his flocks - very fine. Castiglione.\n\nA Præsepe [manger scene], small, vastly pretty - Parmeggiano.\n\nNoli me tangere; same size; the airs &beauty exquisite. Albano.\n\nThese 2 little pictures are in one frame together -\n\nPortrait of Calvin, a head; 'tis a broad, plump face with a square white beard; very good - Holbein -\n\nSybils; heads they are called, Guido -\n\nMadonna; very brown & disagreeable - Andrea del Sarto.\n\nHoly Family - Carlo Marat.\n\nMan in armour with a Cupid; Woman with a bottle, a Satyr by her - Rubens -\n\nPortrait of a Boy, dark but very good, a head. Old Palma.\n\nA Holy Family - Ditto.\n\nMan playing on a Pipe. Much Nature - Il Capucino.\n\n28\n\nMan on horseback & Lady standing - Vandike - not his best -\n\nSeveral Portraits more of him, & Titian -\n\nThe Mezzanine appartments of this Palace are truly Italian, & contrived with much Taste for Coolness in a sultry climate. But just high enough to stand upright in, the cielings a little arch'd, the windows small, & the glass of them painted with Ivy & Vines twining irregularly about; Marble Pavements with fine fountains of the same disposed in Niches, Bathing Rooms, & Beds of Repose in deep Alcoves; the furniture Drawings, & Sketches; among the rest are those for the heads of the 2 Portraits above-mention'd - Vandike.\n\nNov. 28, 1739. Left Genoa; cross'd the mountains again, & came to Tortona. This City is one of K. of Sardinia's last acquisitions, & strongly fortified. 'Tis on an eminence. We did not enter it, for the gates were shut.\n\nThe vast plains of Lombardy were now begun; lay at Castel St Giovanni.\n\nPassed the famous river Trebia [now Trebbia]; the country on this side of it, where Scipio incamped, after Hannibal had crossed the Po, is still as Livy has described it12, loca altiora, collesque impeditores equiti, the more remarkable as the rest is a huge & very level plain. It was at this time so narrow & so shallow a stream that we crossed without a ferry in the Chaise; but the vast broad, & stony Channel of it, tho' then dry, was a sufficient intimation of it's bigness at certain seasons (all the other rivers we passed between this & Bologna were much in the same condition). On the other side of it is a naked plain for a little while, & beyond that Willows & Shrubs: here was the Scene of that Battle. There are in that plain some vestigia of an Aqueduct, 8 or 10 great ruinous masses of Brick, on which the Arches seem to have rose. Possibly it convey'd the water of that river to Placentia [mod. Piacenza]. We dined at that City, which makes a very mean appearance; here are some paintings at the Dome, & another Church, but I had not\n\n29\n\ntime to see them - passed thro' Borgo St Dennino, a town where the young Dutchess Dowager of Parma resides, ferried over the Taro, & arrived very late at night at Parma, which is 5 little miles further, stayed there one day.\n\n30\n\n6.\n\nPARMA\n\nThe City being all built of Brick (like the others in this part of Lombardy) & that not plaister'd, has but a smoky & melancholy appearance; there are few, or no good buildings in it: it is large, & the little R. Parma runs thro' the middle of it. The Dome is a great Gothick Structure, much unworthy of such hands as have contributed to adorn it. It is damp, & gloomy; the whole vault is painted; on each hand of the middle Isle are Histories in squares, & Heads included in a sort of Laurel Wreaths; these are in proper colours; the rest are Cariatides, Grotesques, &c: in Chiaro Scuro. The Cupola so much celebrated is indeed in a sad condition; great pieces of the mortar are peel'd off & what remains so spoiled, that it is with much difficulty one distinguishes any thing at all: so that the beauties of this great work of the Admirable Correggio are only to be seen at present in the Copies of the Caracsi, & the Prints. One part of it, the Saints that sit in the Pennacchi [pendentives or spandrels] of the Arches are in better preservation than the rest, (tho' they too are much hurt) & seem extremely fine; as do the Chiaro Scuro13 ornaments; some of which are of the Parmeggiano. In short it is a sight that gives me more concern than pleasure. In St Giovanni de Monte (another great Church) are his other great works; they are in a Cupola too; I believe somewhat better preserved but there is so little light, that it is absolutely impossible to judge of that beautiful colouring & those heavenly airs that comprise the principal part of this master's character. One may indeed perceive the incorrectness of the drawing; & to me I own the figures appear all too large for the place they are in, tho' that is not small, and they are seen at a vast distance.\n\nIn one of the side-chappels are kept 2 pictures also of Correggio; they are vastly esteem'd & in perfect preservation; small figures:\n\nDescent from the Cross [now known as Lamentation], &\n\nMartyrdom of Flavius & Placidia, in oil -\n\n31\n\nI do not see anything very remarkable in them, except the incorrect drawing.14\n\nOver a Door that goes into the Abbey is:\n\na St John, the Evangelist, sitting, his book in his hand, & the Eagle beside him - great Spirit - Correggio.\n\nFine Sacrifices in Chiao Scuro - Parmeggiano - these run along both sides of the middle Isle at a great height -\n\nAt the Church of St Antonio Abbate is the famous Altar-piece* of Correggio. It happen'd to be taken down, that somewhat might be done to the Frame, so we saw it in a room in what light, & as near, as we pleased. It is in perfect preservation except one place, which is not in any principal part of it; there are, I think, 6 figures, as big as the life. The Virgin is sitting in the middle; her head, & upper parts very good; the lower, which her drapery covers, & the foot that appears are manifestly disproportionate; the Bambino in her lap is not a beautiful child, but is exquisitely colour'd, & vast nature; it is stretching out both its hands to a smileing boy-Angel, that shows an admirable profile, & is turning over a book, which he holds to the little Jesus. This is on the Madonna's right side, & on the same, next the eye stands the St Jerom, a noble figure, in profile too; he is naked to the wast, & finely painted, in the corner you see the head of the Lion, that always accompanies him. On t'other side is the Magdalen, kneeling & kissing the Christ's foot. This figure is truly Correggio; the exquisite air of Sorrow & Beauty in the face, with that long flowing hair of a bright flaxen colour & the admirable Tints of the Flesh make the loveliest head (Profile) it is possible to see. The hand & little foot it holds, are the very utmost of Colouring; the drapery in great, & easy folds: in short this is the top figure in the picture: tho' here too the lower parts are too small & incorrect. Behind her is a Boy-Angel with the Phial of ointment. Divine!15\n\nAt the church of the San-sepolcro16; on the first altar, left-hand as you enter, is -\n\n32\n\nA Riposo, Joseph, gathering dates. The Christ & the Angels are exquisite - Correggio -\n\nOpposite to it.\n\nA Holy Family - very good - Girolamo Mazzioli. He was cousin to the Parmeggiano, & imitated him.\n\nMadonna della Steccata.\n\nHere are Half-Cupolas in this Church painted (it matters not by whom). They have absolutely no light at all. On one side of the Arch of the Chancell, in the bending of it, over the Organ is:\n\nMoses, breaking the Tables; it is in Chiao Scuro, painted to look like a Statue. I never saw a finer figure: prodigious Spirit & Dignity in the attitude! But at a vast height, & ill-seen17 - Parmeggiano.\n\nOpposite to it are the Adam & Eve of the same master; but I could perceive nothing of them, the place is so dark -\n\nThe Capucins.\n\nAt the High Altar:\n\nDescent* from the Cross. The Christ is the finest colour'd dead Body imaginable, & has an admirable Composure, & serenity of countenance; it rests on the knees of the Virgin, who faints away & is supported by Angels behind. An excellent picture - Annib. Carracci.\n\nSt Lewis, & the other Saint, on the sides are of Ludovico [Carracci]-\n\nIn a Vault of this monastery are the bodies of the Ducal family of Parma & Alexander Farnese among them; they are in wooden Chests painted & inscribed with their Names - At the Palace resides the old Dutchess Dowager of Parma, Mother to the Queen of Spain. There is nothing to be seen; for the famous Gallery of Paintings is all gone to Naples. The Theatre, which joins it, is still worth seeing for its spatiousness & contrivance, tho' much out of repair18 -\n\n33\n\nThe Villa Ducale is a little way without the Walls: it seems deserted & in bad condition enough. The apartments are little & unmagnificent; many rooms execrably painted, in 2 or 3 are Medallions, & small Squares with poetical histories by Parmeggiano: most of them unfinish'd; many ill-drawn & that could never have been good for any thing; none very extraordinary. At last you come to a small chamber, whose sides & ceilings are wholly painted in Fresco by Carlo Cignano. They are his last works & not quite finish'd, when he died. On the left hand of the door & the same side is the Story of -\n\nJupiter & Europa. The Bull is couching down & her Maids are placeing her on his back, others dressing her with flowers; their airs & looks are admirable & there are several fine heads among them; she herself is the least good, but there is an expression of Virgin-Modesty in her face. A Cupid has got astride a Goat & going a little way to the Sea upon it. A gentile thought!\n\nOpposite to it, is:\n\nBacchus & Ariadne. She is seated on the nuptial Couch, Venus is by her side with Cunning & Persuasion in her Countenance, one of her hands is around her Neck & with the other she leads Bacchus & presents him to her. Cupid too is hanging upon her & indeed she appears, if not consenting, at least stagger'd in her resolution. A Satyr, who kneels, holding back a Curtain, & looks her in the face with a Rustick Grin, is an exquisite figure both for expression, & painting. The Attendants of Bacchus are danceing on the Shore - This is the finest of all, & indeed it is extremely so.\n\nOn each side the Windows are:\n\nApollo & Daphne; he has caught her & she is takeing root & rises with a fine sweep - admirable. Cupid wrestling with a Satyr; he has got him down; at a distance is a little Nymph looking on. This Groupe is exquisite, as fine as possible! -\n\nOn the opposite Side:\n\nVenus in her Chariot, drawn by two Cupids, & two little Satyrs, that are prodigious good & make a beautiful Contrast. She herself is not so well; there are Nymphs, & Zephyrs danceing about her, some of which are very\n\n34\n\ngentile. Upon the whole this seems the worst picture of the five; but still it is good. The Ceiling is painted too in Compartiments, but I forget the Subjects - this noble room Richardson has not mention'd at all; I conclude he did not see it - The Latin Inscription made by Achillini in honour of Agostino, Wright19 has transcribed -\n\nPassed the River Lenza (anciently Nigella) [mod. Enza] over a very long bridge, which goes across the whole channel of it: the Stream itself one might jump over. At the hither end of this bridge is a white Marble Statue of St John Neopomucenus20, as large, or larger than the life. Passed thro' Reggio without stopping; the country all hereabouts & quite to Bologna is as fertile & well cultivated as possible, & must in summer afford the most beautiful view in the world; the fields are regularly planted with rows of Elms, Mulberry, & Olive Trees, & Vines running up every one of them. Between them is Corn sown & the hedges are many of them kept cut, as in a Garden, the roads are commonly quite strait, & very broad for leagues together; we came in the afternoon to Modena.\n\n35\n\n7.\n\nMODENA\n\nThat City makes at least as bad an appearance as Parma, & much in the same kind; only that here are Portico's running along all the Streets, which add somewhat to the view & keep it clean. Stayed there one day. The Duke lives here in a private manner; we were twice at the Palace [Palazzo Ducale, now the Accademia Militare] without seeing almost anybody but the Man who showed us the Gallery; & a Centinel at the outward Gate. It is a new handsome Building, not yet finish'd. The Gallery is one of the first Collections in Europe for Pictures21; it consists of 6 Rooms full & few trifles amongst them. Those, that were the furniture of the two first were unluckily taken down to be clean'd & we could not see them; the other four we saw twice over. Those I most particularly remember, are:\n\nIn the 3rd Room:\n\nHistory of St Roch, figures as large as life, & a great number of them, many fine expressions, but a dark unpleaseing colouring, & altogether not very agreeable. Annibal Carracci.\n\nOver against it hangs, what was painted to rival it:\n\nThe other St Roch*, about the same Size, & much like it in the Colouring. On one side of the picture next the eye a Woman lies dead (it is a Pestilence) & her Child (a little boy) just expiring, & turning its eyes towards her for assistance; there is a want of delicacy in the figures but the expression vastly strong & moveing - Camillo Procaccini -\n\nAbraham's Sacrifice. Isaac naked, bound & kneeling on the Pile, a fine figure; the head of his father is so too but he has a great fluttering scarlet drapery that hurts the eye excessively - Andrea del Sarto.\n\nA Physician, Ritratto, Head and hands, holding a book, great nature - Correggio -\n\nMars in armour, sitting, Venus with a Cupid standing, about a foot & ½ high - Benvenuto da Garofalo -\n\nMadonna, Head & Hands - Flamino Torre -\n\nHoly Family; these are at one end; at the other - a Lady, & men with\n\n36\n\nseveral Children (a Venetian family) kneeling; a long narrow Picture - Paul Veronese.\n\nSeveral Portraits - Titian & Vandyke -\n\n4th Room\n\nMadonna with many Saints - Guido -\n\nChrist & Saints; a Woman kneeling is presented to him by S. Carlo - Guido -\n\nThese are very large pictures in his first dark manner & have been much injured by the Damp.\n\nAdoration of the Magi: same shape with that in the other room - a fine picture - Paul Veronese.\n\nPeter denying Christ, the expression low, but vast force of colouring: the Maid, & the Soldier asleep in the chair are exquisitely painted - Mich: Ang: Caravaggio.\n\nMan, & Woman at Cards, 2 more figures, nothing can be finer in the kind, 'tis alive - Ditto -\n\nLast Supper. Small - Tintoret -\n\nThe Ceilings in this, & 2 or 3 more rooms have rounds with figures seen di sotto in su [from below upwards] & painted by Tintoret -\n\n5th Room\n\nOver the Doors are -\n\nA Venus lying along in the Clouds with a Cupid, & Doves - Annibal [Lud. & Agno.] Carracci -\n\nA Satyr (Pluto) sleeping (of Agostino) , & 2 more of the same size, of which this Satyr seems the finest. They are all foreshortened figures - Ditto -\n\nChrist in the Garden, sweating blood; a half figure; the face turned almost in profile, & one arm resting on a Boy-Angel - Ditto -\n\nMadonna with 4 Saints, big as life. His first manner, somewhat hard - Correggio -\n\nThe Apostles; Heads and Hands: the St Peter is exquisitely fine. He is looking up to heaven with an expression of heart felt sorrow, the Tears running down his Cheeks; and his hand beating his wither'd Breast. This and two more by Guido.\n\nThe rest, several of which are very fine, by Guercino.\n\n37\n\nMarriage of Cana*. Same shape with the 2 others: the Bride, a Profile of excessive beauty, her Mother (a fat old Lady, who calls for wine) & 2 Children at Play with a dog, are the very perfection of this master; there are a great number of other fine figures, an exceeding fine Picture! - Paul Veronese -\n\nA Magdalen. Half-figure. She is leaning on one arm, and looking a little upwards with an uncommon expression, much grief, but a mixture of indignation, that seems to say, why did you give me Passions? Her attitude, her Neck, & Drapery are as fine as possible. 'Tis vastly touching - Annibal Carracci.\n\nAssumption*. The Virgin is in the attitude of one flying, tho' there are Boy-Angels that support her. The Apostles below perfectly fine. Large as life - Annibal Carracci -\n\nMadonna* with Saints. A glorious Picture in the whole! The Angel with a book that lies upon the ground is prodigious life. The St John is a most noble, & beautiful Youth, but the St Matthew on the other side is the utmost Stretch of Painting, whether you regard the Air of the Head, the graceful Attitude, the Drapery in great noble folds; or the Strength of Colouring, it is a most perfect figure - Annibal Carracci -\n\nRichardson22 calls these Ludovico. But they are always reckon'd by Annibal; they say so even at Bologna -\n\n6th Room\n\nA little fat Boy, drinking and piping at the same time; an odd thought - Guido -\n\nOne wounded with Arrows; seems dead; a Physician busy in extracting them - Sebastian del Piombo [M. Caravaggio]23.\n\nA Valore (as it is called) an allegorical representation of Heroic Virtue under the figure of a young winged Person with Laurel Wreaths in an attitude of flying - very fine - Annibal Carracci.\n\nSt Francis, a head in Crayons, extremely good - Guido.\n\nL'Amorosa del Titiano, a Ritratto, in white Sattin, an Italian fan (à la girouette) [like a weather-vane] in her hand. Half-length.\n\nMadonna washing the Christ, the little St John pouring water & St Elizabeth holding linnen to dry him - extremely fine - Giulio Romano.\n\nWoman taken in Adultery*; many figures, & fine expression in their faces. It is very beautiful, & the style resembles the best of Paul Veronese, but the picture is said to be undoubtedly - Titian -\n\n38\n\nChrist rejecting the Tribute; only 2 figures; heads and hands. The expression of a majestick calm. Indignation such as arises in a generous mind when it sees through the little artifice of one that would betray it, is here seen in perfection: it is exquisite, & highly finished. there are two more of these at Florence, one (in small) in the Tribuna, the other at the Palace Pitti. They are originals too - Titian.\n\nSt Jerom at Prayers in the Desert*, finely drawn, & colour'd, his Lyon in the corner asleep, exquisite! - Rubens -\n\nDiana & Actæon. He is seen at a little distance - hastening away, & his horns beginning to sprout. Not far from him a most beautiful nymph is attempting to conceal herself in a bush which hides but very little of her; another who stands upto the breast in water, is plucking a branch of the same, & by so doing exposes her companion the more. On t'other side is the Goddess herself sitting on the bank, a most majestick figure; the expression of Shame less, than in her attendants, as knowing that she could bind him to eternal Secrecy: 5 or 6 Nymphs round her; some spreading a Veil of Linnen before her; others shifting for themselves; all in most gentile, & lovely attitudes. 'Tis a most exquisite performance of the amiable - Albano.\n\nRape of Proserpine: this is rather the occasion of the Subject, than the Subject itself. Pluto is seen at a distance carrying her off, & Arethusa attempting to stop his chariot. On the nearer ground is a Dance of little Loves round a statue of Cupid: they bear in triumph one of the Bidens [hoe or mattock], (the Insigne of Pluto), another the keys of Hell, a third the Garland of Flowers, that Proserpine had begun to weave, & in the Clouds Venus is reclined, kissing her Son. This picture is the other's Companion; I know not which is finest: they are both exquisitely so, & both equally finish'd & preserved. They are small figures in his lightest, neatest, loveliest manner, & nothing can be gentiler, or more poetical than the Design; as he was the Ovid of painting. This last is the same (some small difference in the Composition, & the size of the Figures excepted) with that celebrated one at the Pal: Sampieri in Bologna, but I own this here seems to me much preferable - [Albano].\n\nMadonna with Angels in a bright heaven above. St Geminiano & other Saints kneeling below; very bright & gracious - big as life - Correggio.\n\nMadonna* with St George & others. That Saint is standing, the monster's head bleeding at his foot; a figure very noble & full of spirit. The Boy on\n\n39\n\nthe foreground & the other that holds the Model of a church upon his head, are alive, & the very perfection of colouring - a most beautiful picture - Ditto.24\n\nThe famous Magdalen. A small figure lying on the ground, & reading. On the head, the neck, the hair & the arms, that support her head & book, are beyond all conception; it is a little Miracle of his incomparable Pencil, & deserves more praises than it has ever met with, as numerous as they are. This is shut up in the wall - Ditto.\n\nThe more famous Notte* [night-scene]. It consists of the Virgin, the Christ lying on straw before her; the Clown that stands upright; the younger one, who sits or kneels, & is talking to the old one concerning the wondrous birth; & a rustick Woman, that holds up her hand before her eyes, as dazzled with the amazeing Splendour, proceeding from the Child; besides these are Cattle, who partake of the Light, & are shown by it. beside the wondrous Clair-obscure so well known as the particular excellence of this glorious Picture; the expression in the faces of the Virgin, the young Shepherd, & the woman are exquisitely fine. The effect of this picture on the eye the moment you enter the room is surprizeing. The figures are less than life - Ditto.25\n\nThere are several Portraits of Titian & Vandyke &c.\n\nThe Beauty of the Country rather increases, than diminishes, as you go from hence to Bologna; but it is a beauty all of the same nature. That City does not at all strike the eye upon entering it, but rather has a mean & dirty appearance. Very few of the streets are without a Portico on each side, which, tho' irregular, is undoubtedly an ornament. But in general the buildings (some Palaces excepted) are very old & being of Brick, the whole has an air of Melancholy: neither does it seem so populous, as it is generally accounted. The Provisions & Fruits are as good as any in the World, & in the greatest Plenty imaginable -\n\n40\n\n8.\n\nBologna.\n\n12 Days, al Pelegrino26\n\nPalazzo Ranuzzi27.\n\nThis is a handsome Structure. The grand double Staircase & the Hall are very magnificent, & there are great quantities of fine old Plate, dispersed about the Appartments. Of many pictures that are here, I remember -\n\nA Ritratto: Woman's Head - Rafaël -\n\nTobias, cureing his Father's Blindness - Guido -\n\nMadonna, Head & Hands - Albano -\n\nThe Good Samaritan; fine in his manner - Spagnuoletto -\n\nLittle Christ Asleep - Carlo Cignani -\n\nA vaulted Cieling; in the Border, are Plays of Boys, some shooting, others with a Tiger, caught in a Net, &c. Exceeding gentile, & much like Cignani his Master - Cav. Franceschini.\n\nIn the Summer Appartments\n\nThe Coriolanus* of Lor. Pasinelli, the most considerable work of this Master, of whom I never saw anything, but at Bologna. The figures are big as life; & much fine expression -\n\nSt Jerom with an Angel; very large: a Sbozzo - Guido -\n\nRape of Proserpine & Rape of Helen: Companions - Luca Giordano\n\nSoldiers coming to murder Agrippina; she is saying, Uterum feri28. Great Spirit! - Guercino.\n\nPalazzo Sampieri.29\n\nThe Freezes, Sfondati [trompes d'oeil perspectives], & Rounds in the Cielings in this Palace are painted in Fresco by the Carracci, but I remember nothing very strikeing - Here is a large Collection of\n\n41\n\nPictures, which are now to be sold. Among others are -\n\nThe Rape of Proserpine, the same design with that at Modena, but that the figures here are larger, some small particulars in the design alter'd, & a few boys playing upon instruments added. This is what Richardson calls a Play of Boys: it is one of the most celebrated performances of the Albani. 900 Crowns (225£ Sterling) have been offer'd for it.\n\nThe Triumph of Venus upon gaining the Apple; a pretty gentile thought - Cav. Franceschini. This was done as a Companion to the former but should not appear near it -\n\nNoli me tangere30 - Annibal Carracci.\n\nWoman taken in Adultery - Ludovico Carracci.\n\nChrist & Woman of Samaria - Agostino Carracci.\n\nSt Jerom - Old Palma.\n\nMagdalen, a head - divine! Guido -\n\nThe Pool of Bethesda - Guido -\n\nProfile of an Angel - exquisite - Guido.\n\nAnother of the Madonna. But indifferent - Cignani.\n\nA Madonna - much like Guido - Elisa: Sirani.\n\nThe St Cecilia, copied; by Guido -\n\nAssumption, many small figures, very beautiful, not much finish'd. Done at 18 years old - Guido -\n\nTwo Women singing - Dossa da Ferrara -\n\nAbraham dismissing Hagar - Guercino -\n\nSt Peter & St Paul, large as life; extremely noble, & colour'd in a dark but warm Tint, like the best of the Caraches - Guido -\n\nGroupe of Boys, in white Marble - Algardi -\n\nAnother - Mazza -\n\nIn one of the Cielings in Fresco -\n\nHercules & Antaus - Guercino.\n\nPalazzo Zambeccari.\n\nThis is the largest Collection of Pictures in Bologna31; there are 22 Rooms full. They are to be sold; as is a part of the furniture, among which are the most beautiful Marble Tables I ever saw. Among the\n\n42\n\npaintings are -\n\n4 Pieces of Fish, Fowl, Fruits, & Flowers, by Mich: Angelo del Campidoglio.\n\n2 Small Landscapes with figures - Young Brueghel.\n\nOld Man's Head, Small, a Ritratto - Vandyke.\n\nSbozzo of the dyeing St Jerom - Agostino Carracci -\n\nAngel's Head, a Profile, very beautiful & Guidesco by Giovanni di Sola.\n\nDescent from the Cross - Paul Veronese -\n\nMadonna - Lisabetta Sirani.\n\nSt Jerom - Ditto.\n\nMagdalen - Ditto.\n\nThese are 3 large pictures; not bad, but incorrect.\n\nLot & his Daughters - Guercino -\n\nMadonna - Carlo Cignani -\n\nA Praesepe - Ludovico Carracci -\n\nHead of a Saint at Prayers - Guido -\n\nSta Clara & A Christ, Heads, on a Gold Ground, his Gothick Manner, as usual - Albert Durer -\n\nLucrece* dyeing - larger than life, a gross undelicate Style - Pelegrino Tibaldi -\n\nSt Francis Praying,* fine! - Guido -\n\nJudith & Holofernes - a most bloody & horrid expression, more fit for a Murtheress than an inspired Heroine; a good Picture notwithstanding that impropriety - wondrous Strength! M. A. Caravaggio -32\n\nOld Lady with a Book (his Mother) in Black, standing - a three-quarters length - vast Nature - Guido -33\n\nBirth of Christ - Ludovico Carracci -\n\nAbraham & the Angels - Ditto -\n\nJacob's Vision - Ditto -\n\nMoses breaking the Tables - Ditto -\n\nThese are much of a bigness; the figures about the size of Nic: Poussin's. I own, they none of 'em touch me extremely. The 2nd is the finest.\n\nMartyrdom of St Ursula*; a large Picture, vastly fine Expression, particularly of extreme Fear in those 2 Virgins, that are embraceing each other, & of Resignation, & pious Courage in the Saint herself - Lorenzo Pasinelli.\n\nMany Battles - Il Borgognone -\n\n43\n\nHead of a Young Man, Red Cap, & Feather, a Ritratto - great Life & Spirit - Guercino -\n\nDavid, bringing Goliah's Head to Saul, a dark strong manner like the Caravaggio - Guercino -\n\nVenus & Adonis, she is hanging upon him to detain him from the Chase; & Cupids are trying to hinder his Dogs from going too - small figures, a beautiful picture - Rubens -\n\nMagdalen with Boy-Angels - Albani -\n\nHead of St Francis in the Capucin's Dress, weeping, & praying; the expression is wonderfully fine - Domenichino34 - this & the Rubens are sold - it has a glass before it -\n\nMadonna in a bright heaven with numerous Angels adoreing; St Francis, St Domenic, & two others kneeling below. Small figures but highly finish'd; the grace & beauty of it is inexpressible - Albani - this also has a Glass - they have refused 200£ St for it -\n\nMadonna* - most divine expression - Domenichino - this they will not sell at all.\n\nChurch dei Mendicanti35\n\nHigh Altar:\n\nA Pieta*. The dead Christ laid at length, the Virgin standing with Angels about her; this is atop, below are Saints, Protectours of Bologna, adoreing. It is vastly large, & reckon'd the first Picture in Bologna of this great Master - Guido.\n\nAt a Side-Altar\n\nCapella dei Mercanti da Seta\n\nJob*, seated on a Throne, receiving the Presents made him after his misfortunes. A glorious Picture! The 2 naked figures with a Calf are exquisite; the airs of heads & beauty in perfection - Guido - Sr Robert Walpole has this in small, but in his first dark Manner -\n\nCapella della Compagnia de' Salavoli\n\nChrist*, calling Matthew from the Mony-Table, dark, but very fine - Ludovico Carracci -\n\n44\n\nCapella Monticelli\n\nThe well-known whimsical Picture of Joseph, begging Pardon of the Virgin for his unjust Suspicions; it is of - Alessandro Tiarini.\n\nChurch of St Domenico\n\nThis is a vast large building, old but gay & light enough. It is finely adorn'd throughout but particularly the -\n\nCapella di Domenico.\n\nAs large alone as some Churches. In the middle of it is the Shrine of that Saint, in which is his body. It is of pure white marble with Bas-reliefs, & small figures by several famous hands; among which, one of the Angels, that kneels, the St Petronius, the St Proculus, & St Francis, are of Michelangelo.\n\nThe Catino, or Half-Cupola, is painted in Fresco, where in a bright heaven are Christ & the Virgin, receiving St Domenic; many Angels playing on various Instruments, particularly Base-Viols, & Violins. 'Tis very fine in excellent preservation - Guido -\n\nCapella Bolognini.\n\nSt Thomas Aquinas writeing, a fine figure, several Angels, very poor - Guercino -\n\nCapella Solimei\n\nSt Raimond crossing the Sea upon his Mantle - bad enough - Ludovico Carracci -\n\nCapella Guidotti\n\nVery large & fine. In the vault is painted the Assumption - Colonna & Mitelli.\n\nOn the Altar is a Madonna in Rilievo, round which, as a frame, are 15 small Squares of Painting by several great Masters -\n\nThe Visitation - Ludovico Carracci.\n\nScourgeing of Christ - Ditto\n\nThe Assumption - Guido.\n\n45\n\nPresentation - Dionigi Calvart &c: &c:\n\nHere is the Monument of Guido and buried with him lies Lisabetta Sirani [\"his Scholar\" crossed out].\n\nIn this Chappel (in the beginning of December we were present at the Voto Publico. Mass was celebrated to a fine Concert of Musick before the Cardinals Lambertini & Spinola (Archbishop & Legate) & the Gonfalonier [chief magistrate] (Count Casprara) with the Anziani & Senate. After Mass 4 poor Maids dress'd in White & cover'd with long Veils of Lawn were led up to the Altar by as many Ladies of the first Quality, & presented to the Cardinals, who give them a Portion of 200 Scudi a-piece to marry, or go into a Convent -\n\nCapella Turrini\n\nSt Hiacynth, adoreing the Madonna36 - Ludovico Carracci -\n\nCapella Malveggi\n\nCommunion of St Catherine of Sienna, many Angels, in a Corregesco taste - Brizio -\n\nCapella Casali\n\nHere is a small monument of the 3 Carracci, a bust of Ludovico upon it -\n\nCapella Bero\n\nMassacre of the Innocents*. Extremely famous, the woman who sets upon the ground, her hands clasped together & both her children murder'd before her, is as fine as possible. The rest not very touching - Guido -\n\nThe Convent is very spatious; the Library, & the Atrio leading to it of a handsome design: on each side are painted the Actions of St Thomas by Franceschini, & others -\n\nMonache di Sta Agnese\n\nMartyrdom of St Agnes*. A much admired picture. The Saint herself is a mere Child & does not seem very correctly drawn: the Angel receiving the\n\n46\n\nChaplet above is execrable. A young woman & an old, she is speaking too, are indeed fine figures, but the expression has nothing particular in it; nor is the Colouring in general pleasing; it has somewhat raw & unnnatural - Domenichino.\n\nPalazzo Magnani37\n\nIn the Frize round the hall are painted in Fresco the principal Parts of the History of Romulus & Remus - The 3 Carracci - They are not in very good preservation, but enough still to show many noble Airs, & fine Groupes. The pieces are separated from one another by noble Terms in Chiaro-Scuro (Human figures capriciously situated) that are as fine as those at St Michele in Bosco, & better preserv'd by much. Over the Chimney is -\n\nThe Lupercalia, by Annibale -\n\nIn some other rooms are -\n\nAn Apollo sitting, various insignia of his Godhead round him - Annibal & Ludovico Carracci -\n\nCupid striveing with a Satyr; same design (tho' different figures) with that at Parma; the Cupid here is more robust & the Satyr a more capricious figure: it is undoubtedly prodigious good. Much bigger than life! This & the former are in Fresco; both preserved, tho' the building, where they originally were, was long since demolish'd. This last is of Agostino -\n\nA fine Magdalen, half-figure. Excellently coloured; not dark - Guercino -\n\nHoly Family - very fine! - Rafaël -\n\nChurch of Corpus Domini\n\nVery ancient & extremely large: round it are painted in Fresco the Actions of St Catherine Vigri, by Franceschini.\n\nCapella Angelelli\n\nSumptuously adorn'd with Marble; thro' a Grate in the Altar at certain times is shown the Body of St Cath. Vigri setting in a Chair, & richly dressed38. On one Side hangs -\n\nThe Resurrection; it is greatly esteem'd - An. Carracci -\n\n47\n\nHigh Altar\n\nThe Padre Eterno with Angels, St Francis, & St Clara in white Marble - Algardi & Mazza.\n\nCapella Monti\n\nDeath of St Joseph; the masterpiece of Franceschini -\n\nCapella Fontana\n\nChrist appearing in the Limbo - Ludovico Carracci -\n\nAssumption - Ditto -\n\nMuch admired; but so dark, I do not pretend to judge of them.\n\nPalazzo Publico\n\nThe Apartment of the Gonfalonier.\n\nThe famous Pallione39; it is extreme large; the Madonna, as lovely as possible, seated above on the Rainbow with Angels around her; below St Petronius in a rich Cope, St Domenic, & St Francis (3 exquisite figures) with St Francis Xavier kneeling; St Filip Neri, St Proculus, & St George, standing, & before them a model of Bologna. I never saw a more beautiful Picture - Guido - This is painted on Silk -\n\nThe Samson; he is refreshing himself with the miraculous Liquor out of the Jaw-bone, many Philistines lye dead at his feet: larger than life. A most exquisite figure, & in a noble attitude! It is much, & deservedly praised - Guido -\n\nA Head, called, Rafaël.\n\nSt John, young, in the Wilderness; disputes originality with that of the D: of Orleans, & that of the Great-Duke, but has the least pretence of the three - Rafaël -\n\nOver the Gate that opens upon the Gran Piazza is a fine Statue in Bronze of Pope Gregory 13: in an action of giveing his blessing. It weighs 11 thousand Weight, & was made by Alessandro Minganti, whom Agostino Carracci used to call Michelangelo Incognito -\n\nIn the middle of the Piazza is a noble fountain. Upon it a Colossal Statue of Neptune in the most majestick Attitude imaginable: it is prodigiously fine. Bronze. Giovanni Bologna.\n\n48\n\nChurch of St Giorgio\n\nCapella Guicchi\n\nBaptism of Christ*, God the Father above with Angels, very fine, a dark strong Colouring - Albani - It is the same almost with Sr Rob: Walpole's, but that is a light airy Colouring, more like the small pictures of this Master -\n\n4th Chappel on the right\n\nSt Philip Benizio kneeling before the Madonna & Angels - begun by Cantarini, finish'd by Albani -\n\nCapella Landini\n\nMadonna, with St John & St Catherine - Annibal Carracci -\n\nChurch of S. Gregorio\n\nCapella Grimaldi\n\nSt George with the Dragon* dead, Sabina released & running away frighted; in the upper part is St Michael precipitating the old Dragon; Angels pursuing the Devils, whom they beat with their fists. An odd Composition, but an exceeding fine Picture. The St George has a vast deal in the air, & attitude of Correggio's at Modena - Ludovico Carracci.\n\nCapella Locatelli St Felice\n\nThe St Guglielmo.* What the expression is, I cannot judge, as not knowing the History. There are many figures, & prodigiously fine - Guercino -\n\nPalazzo Tanari\n\nMany pictures - among the others are -\n\nBirth of Alexander; Diana is in the Clouds, as assistant at the Labour, & at a little distance appears the Temple of Ephesus on fire - not good40 - Lud: Carracci -\n\nMartyrdom of St Andrew, after that in St Gregorio a Monte Celio at Rome by Guido; same size - Cavedona\n\nScourgeing of the same Saint, after Domenichino - Ditto -\n\nMadonna in the Clouds on a Gold Ground, stippled, Small; very beautiful\n\n49\n\n- Albani -\n\nSolomon & the Queen of Sheba; as it is called but that is not the Subject; nor do I know what it is. There are two lovely figures, & she has a Crown in her hand, ready to put it, not on his head, but her own as it seems. Big as the life, & exquisitely fine - Guido -\n\nIn a small Gallery of Drawings\n\nDesign for the Pallione, very fine - Guido [Flam. Torri].41\n\nHead, Profile, seems a Magdalen, or the Woman taken in Adultery, Red & Black Chalk - Guido [Ditto]\n\nHead of a Susanna; it has a small Turbant, & is the same with the picture Ld Waldegrave42 has at Paris - Guido [Ditto]\n\nTwo more, very good - Guido.\n\nMany fine ones of the Carracci, Guercino, M:Angelo &c.\n\nPalazzo Aldravandi\n\nBoy-Angels with Instruments; a Sketch - Pasinelli.\n\nZephyrus, sitting on Clouds, a gentile Imagination, but languid faint Colouring - Giov. dal Sole -\n\nCleopatra dead; Augustus entering the Monument - Carlo Lotti.43\n\nThe Assumption*, very fine, but the Shades are exceeding black & without harmony - Guercino -\n\nBoy's Head, a Ritratto, admirable! An. Carracci -\n\nMarriage of St Catharine; the Bambino is exquisite but the St Catharine has the features of a Negro girl. This has a glass before it & is kept in a case with great Care - Correggio44 [Parmeggiano].\n\nCupid Asleep*. Very young; as large as life; the Colouring & harmony admirable! Beautiful to Perfection (now in England purchased by Strange45 for Sir L. Dundas) - Guido - cost 600 Secchins46.\n\nChurch of S. Giovanni In Monte\n\nIn the Inner Sacristy:\n\nMadonna, hands crossed on the breast - Albani.\n\nCapella Muratori\n\nSt Francis* kneeling with his hands clasped, adoreing the Crucifix; the\n\n50\n\nother Fryar, his Companion sleeping over his Breviary at a distance; a very fine Picture - Guercino -\n\nCapella Ratta\n\nMadonna of the Rosary; vast many figures huddled together & disagreeable Colouring; nor is the Drawing correct - Domenichino.47\n\nCapella Bentivoglia\n\nThe Sta Cecilia* - Rafaël - Still in good preservation. This celebrated picture to me does not seem to merit all it's fame. In the midst is that Saint, looking up to heaven, where are several angels singing & playing on instruments; she holds a small Organ in her hands, which she seems going to cast from her. This principal figure is rather ungraceful, than otherwise, the head is the best part of it. At equal distances on either hand of her, are St Paul, leaning on his sword, his hand at his chin, & seeming fixt in contemplation and Mary Magdalen, her face turned towards you, & the Vase of ointment in her hand. These are 2 noble figures indeed, especially the last, the head & neck very great Stile & much like the Antique: the Drapery in as large, & beautiful folds, as can be imagin'd. Just in the spaces between these two & St Cecilia, come in St John & St Austin, 2 perfectly insignificant figures in all respects, nor do any of the five seem to express any relation they bear to one another, any more than if they were in so many different pictures; besides the great regularity they are placed with, which savours a good deal of Gothicism; & the want of expression; there is a heaven atop with angels, that are extremely bad. This is kept cover'd over with another ordinary picture.48\n\nChurch of the Monastery of Sta Margherita\n\nThe Madonna*, St Margaret kneeling, an Angel bearing the Ensign of that Saint; St Jerom, & St Petronius. The Grace & Majesty of the Virgin, the beauty of the Angel & vast Gentleness of the kneeling Saint are beyond Expression. A most lovely Picture! - Parmeggiano -\n\nSt Margaret with the Dragon slain, St Austin, & St Benedict; the Madonna above. There are good things in it - Orazio Sammachini.\n\n51\n\nPalazzo Zani\n\nThe celebrated Madonna della Rosa. The little Christ lyes at his length in her lap naked, & is holding up a Rose to her, which she takes from him with a majestick Grace, that well becomes the Queen of Heaven, & Spouse of God, as they call her. She is not beautiful; but the Air of the head, & neck, & exquisite gentileness of the attitude with the lovely figure of the Bambino make up a most divine picture - Parmeggiano. It is to be sold, but they ask no less than 1000 guineas. I cannot help observing with regard to this & all other pictures of this master I have yet seen; that (tho' Colouring was certainly not his excellence) yet the Redness, & Rawness objected to him by Richardson, as the fault of his paintings, is by no means true; there is rather a remarkable Paleness in all his lights, which, if not quite natural, has something soft & not disagreeable to the eye in it -\n\nThe Hall & some other rooms in this palace have rounds in their Cielings in Fresco, but nothing very touching, tho' painted by Guido.\n\nPalazzo Monti\n\nHere is a collection of fine Pictures, but as they were taken down to clean, & all in confusion, I only remember -\n\nThe Stoning of St Stephen, a large Picture, vast numbers of little figures; fine! - Salvator Rosa -\n\nA Massacre, it's Companion - Ditto -\n\nAn Old Woman, who has left off Spinning to tell a Story with great earnestness to a young one, that is turned to hear her, but seems to have her mind employed about something entirely different. The great expression of nature made me take notice of it; they are little figures in a border of flowers, & done by Cav. Donato Creti, a master now alive at Bologna, & a Scholar of Pasinelli -\n\nNymphs bathing by Moonlight; Diana in the Clouds; most gentile Design! - Albani -\n\nVenus between Bacchus & Ceres; same with the famous one the Duke of Devonshire has. This does not seem much finish'd & has a Rawness - Albani -\n\nLiberality & Modesty, large as life; the expression of the two Virtues is\n\n52\n\nexquisite. Very fine, & gentile. The same with Sr George Oxenden's49 (Mr Furness's) wch is valued at £700 - (this is a copy) - Guido -\n\nHere they show you the 2 Coaches & Chariot the late Marquis had made at Paris to go Ambassadour into Poland with. They are in their kind vastly rich & handsome -\n\nAt the Palazzo Caprara50 are some Pictures; many fine Cabinets, & little Rarities, with a Profusion of Plate, & a Gallery adorn'd with Spoils taken from the Turks by the late General Caprara, disposed with much Taste & Fancy. The house itself is a noble building; the Master of it was Gonfalonier, when I was there -\n\nThe fine Drawings & Pictures at the Palazzo Bonfiglioli are all sold & dispersed. At the other Pal. Bonfiglioli, call'd Senatorio, are many good Paintings. At the Academy del Disegno are Pelegrino Tibaldi's works in Fresco, & some cielings of Primaticcio. Also a small collection of Antiques; there is a Priapus (a Term) [statue or bust] of Bronze, Small, of excellent workmanship -\n\nAt the Institute is a very noble collection of rarities, & disposed in many apartments with the greatest Order & Perspicuity. In one are samples of all kinds of Marbles, & Pretious Stones antique & modern. In another, Mineral productions, in another Birds & Insects, &c.\n\nSt Petronius is an old Building of a vast extent, only considerable on account of Cassini's famous Meridian Line51. The paintings are nothing remarkable, except the St Rocco of Parmeggiano; he is giveing his hand to kiss to the Patron of the Chapel. Figure larger than life, not very fine, nor correctly drawn -\n\nAbout half a mile out of Town is the Certosa, one of the largest & richest Convents of this Order; every fryar has his separate apartment, his Chappel, & Garden; but the Winter hinder'd us from seeing it in\n\n53\n\nit's beauty, yet everything appeared spacious & neat. In the Church are, as you enter, at the Altars on each hand of you -\n\nSt Bruno at Prayers* in the Desert, Madonna with angels above. A solemn, strong tint, & fine airs - Guercino .\n\nCommunion of St Jerom*: so much celebrated; perfectly fine, but the Saint does not seem near Death: a dark Colouring - Agostino Carracci -\n\nIn one of the private Chappels\n\nThe St John Preaching. Vastly fine, but too dark by much52 - Ludovico Carracci.\n\nThe Apartments design'd for Strangers are exceedingly well fitted up; handsome Beds, Lustres [glass balls], Marble Tables, Pictures, Drawings, & Figures in Bronze & Terra Cota -\n\nAt a like distance from the town another way is the rich Convent [monastery] of St Michel in Bosco, not that it is so magnificent, as the descriptions would make one imagine; it is a large handsome old building in a beautiful situation that commands a noble prospect of Bologna & the fruitful plains of Lombardy for many leagues round. You go up the hill by an easy ascent; it is cultivated to the very top, nor does there now appear any thing, that deserves the name of a wood, except here & there a thicket, one sees nothing but fruit-trees, & hedges.\n\nIn the Church. Over 4 Doors.\n\nFour histories, with little figures in as many Medallions, each supported by two Boy-Angels, great Spirit - in Fresco - Carlo Cignani.\n\nIn the Library\n\nSt Michael & the Devil, Bronze between 2 & 3 foot high - very fine - Cav: Algardi -\n\nThe Cortile\n\nThese noble works are now many of them quite gone; none but are\n\n54\n\nextremely damaged, & that partly by time, & partly by malice.53 It is a polygon of 8 or 10 sides; the pieces separated from one another by Terms of an admirable design; these by much are the best preserved parts; they are in Chiaro Scuro, & consist sometimes of a single figure, sometimes of several embraceing one another in capricious attitudes, & that shews great knowledge of Picturesque Anatomy. These are all of Ludovico Carracci. There are in all 37 Pictures, figures large as life -\n\nThose that are most distinguishable of the fine ones are -\n\nThe Turbantina. Sadly spoil'd but yet the fine head, that gives name to the piece still remains, & one sees many lovely airs, & attitudes. The colouring of the flesh is changed in many figures to a high Crimson - Guido -\n\nSt Benedict driveing away the Devil, who lies upon a great stone, & renders it immoveable. The figures that attempt to raise it with Levers, have been exquisite - Lud: Carracci -\n\nTotila54 kneeling before that Saint. The expression in his attendants & the figure of the young man that holds his furious horse, are admirable - Ditto -\n\nThe Mad Woman running to find him out. She is dress'd up in Straws & cut paper, with a whirligig in her hand, smileing at her own Conceits. A little boy & other people pursue her with great concern in their looks - Lud: Carracci -\n\nThe Lascivious Women in the Garden - Ditto -\n\nThe Dead Nuns riseing to hear Mass; very fine, but the people, who are present, do not appear surpris'd at it - Massari -\n\nThese are in a lamentable condition, that I have nam'd, but the rest are still worse -\n\nOne ascends the hill still, & comes to -\n\nThe Capucins, in whose Church is -\n\nThe Crucifix*, so much admired; it is a very noble picture; the St John is particularly excellent, I can't say the Virgin is so, nor has the Christ much expression. The head of the Magdalen is fine. The Sun strikeing through a Window upon it has in one place blister'd the colours - Guido.\n\nThe Portico, that leads to the Church of the Madonna di St Luca, is now finish'd, & makes an uncommon & beautiful appearance winding\n\n55\n\n(as it does) for the space of 3 miles upto the top of the Hill, on which that church stands.\n\nTo Florence [2 Days]\n\nBegun to pass the Appenine. Cloudy damp weather. Road paved & admirably kept; what one could see of the prospect less savage than the Alps, & agreeable enough; lay at Fiorenzuola, a Paltry & ill-provided village. Next morning cross'd the Giogo, vastly steep & dangerous, particularly the descent. View of the plains of Florence in comeing down from the mountains very beautiful! Many olive & lemon trees -\n\n56\n\n9\n\nFlorence\n\nThis City is paved wholly with flat stones, roughen'd a little by Art to make them less slippery. The Arno, which runs through it, tho' shallow, is of very considerable breadth, & cross'd by 4 Bridges.\n\nThe Ponte Vecchio remarkable for it's strength in having resisted the force of the river (which at certain seasons upon the melting of the snows is prodigiously rapid) at times when all the rest were carried away before it. This has shops on both sides of it, & sustains on 3 arches the Corridore which runs across it & joyns the Old Palace to the Pal: Pitti.\n\nThe Ponte a Santa Trinita, one of the finest in the world. It was built in Cosimo II's time, 1607, by Ammanati. It has 3 Arches turned in the form of a Hyperbola, very broad, & the whole is of white Marble55. At the corners of it are 4 Statues (the Seasons) of the same materials by Francavilla, Caccini, &c.\n\nThe 2 others are called the Ponte Rubaconte, & Alla Caraia.\n\nMany noble Statues & Buildings grace the principal parts of this City, one of the chief of which we may well reckon -\n\nThe Uffizi\n\nBuilt in the reign of Cosimo II's by Giorgio Vasari. It makes 3 sides of a Square, 2 of which are 210 paces each, the 3d (which joyns them) of only 70, & the 4th open to the Piazza del G.Duca. Below is a Loggiato (or Portico) running round almost the whole edifice, supported by Columns of the Doric Order, intermix'd with Pilastroni [pilasters], & Niches of a handsome Design in them. Under this Arcade\n\n57\n\nare doors of the Architecture of Buontalenti, Ammanati, &c. that lead to the several Offices of the Magistracy, which are kept here. Over the Porta della Suppliche is a Bust of the G: D: Francis by Giov: dell Opera. This Loggiato is surmounted on the 2 long sides by the Appartments of the G: Duke's Workmen; there are 33 windows on each side, & the 3d has 3 Arches open to the River with Balustrades. Under the middle one is a Statue of Cosimo II's in Marble by the famous Giovanni Bologna. One one side is Equity, on the other Rigour, by Vincenzio Danti - over all this runs the celebrated Gallery, the receptacle of the first Collection without dispute in the World. You enter it about the middle of one of the long sides, but first you go thro' the Lobby, in which are many beautiful Pieces of Antiquity; among others are -\n\nThe Two Wolf-Dogs, both in the same attitude, their ears pricked up, & mouths open, as if they were howling at the moon; rough & full of spirit, in a noble Tast, bigger than life -\n\nVase, on one of whose sides is the head of Galba, in Mezzo-Rilievo56. extremely fine!\n\nElements in Alto-Rilievo, large as life. I take it to represent only 2 of them. Earth is sitting in the middle; fruits in her lap, & 2 children in her arms; a Cow, & a Sheep with Flowers & Herbs about her. On one side is Water seated on a sort of River-Dragon with other Symbols; on the other, a figure they call air, but she has only a Swan, & another water-fowl near her with some rushes, & an urn with a stream flowing from it, which seems to denote Water too. It is somewhat stiff in general, but there are parts of it very fine -\n\nRoman Knight leading his horse, Alto Rilievo, as large as life. He is in a Tunic very succinct, it not reaching his knee, & over it a sort of Trabea [ceremonial robe], connected by a Fibula [clasp or brooch] on one shoulder; in one hand a hasta pura [plain spear], in the other his horse's bridle, the fore part of which appears, & is done with much Spirit. This is thought to represent the ceremony of a Transvectio [Crossing], when that Order past in review before the Censor at the closeing of a Lustrum [purificatory sacrifice]. At the top of the piece are two heads of a Man & Woman, the meaning of which is unknown. The whole is bold & good, & thought to be of Adrian's time -\n\n58\n\nHead in Alto Rilievo, an old face with a Phrygian Cap, white Marble on a black ground - Another in the same manner, resembles a Seneca, both fine but damaged -\n\nRape of Ganymede, Rilievo, small, fine, but much hurt -\n\nPriestess of the Goddess Fides; her hair veiled, & hands wrapped up in her Drapery; a small Statue -\n\nTwo Trophies of a noble fancy, unfinish'd by Mich:Angelo. They are set on antique Bases that have large Inscriptions. Abundance more such in this room, among which the famous ones in honour of Ap: Claudius Cæus & Q. Fabius Maximus,\n\nA Gladiatour in a posture of Defence. The Shield & sword that were in his hands are gone. Much spirit. Fronting this statue is another gladiatour made to answer it by Piamontini, a Sculptour now alive, no contemptible performance -\n\nThe Gallery\n\nIt runs over the whole building; in both the long sides you have windows on one hand, & at each end; on the short side are windows on both hands, so that it is as light as possible, & the Statues, which are ranged on each side, intermix'd with busts, show themselves to the best advantage imaginable. The Cieling, divided into a sort of Testudini [vault] is painted with small figures in Fresco, Allegories mixt with Portraits, & some Grotesques, next the Cieling hangs a row of Portraits, illustrious Men of all Nations, in plain black frames, & very ill done; & here & there Ritratti of the great Duke's family among them: the rest is only white-wash'd down to the Ground. First of the Statues in the order they stand, beginning on the right hand, as one enters -\n\nÆsculapius; leaning on one arm on a stump round which a Serpent twines, & in the other hand holding some medicinal Plant. His Drapery falls from the left Shoulder, so as to leave the Breast, & back with the right arm naked, & being gather'd up about his middle, falls down to his feet. A woollen Vitta [head-band] round the head; hair & beard pretty long à la Grecque but somewhat wormy. The workmanship is good & the attitude very easy. It is supposed to have made a Groupe with the figure of a\n\n59\n\nHygieia, as there are the remains of fingers on the right shoulder -\n\nThe Phrygian Commander, much larger than life. The Torso, or Trunk of this only is antique, & was undoubtedly part of an Atys, as he is seen on pretious Stones & Medals; a very thin & light drapery connected on the breast by a Medal-like Fibula, but open before, & discovering the Stomach, & Belly; a Sash, & Drawers button'd down each thigh, but discovering the bare flesh. The Sculptor, who has restored it, tho' with impropriety, has done it excellently well. He has given it one arm extended with a Truncheon, & a very gentile piece of drapery falling from the left shoulder, & hanging on the arm. The head with the Phrygian cap, & a little beard has a majestick frown, & an inexpressible Spirit in the eyes. An exquisite figure! -\n\nMarsyas.57 Hanging by the arms on a tree, & ready to be flayed. He grins with pain, & anger; every limb is on the stretch, the veins all swelled, & muscles strain'd. Legs & feet particularly fine. 'Tis certain the arms are too short & little. Prodigious fine!\n\nThe Bacchus, of Bronze. It stands, Isolato, alone at the end of this wing of the Gallery, in a wondrous gentile attitude, naked, & without any sort of symbol to shew who it represents, but it has always been taken for a Bacchus; the Museum Florentium say it can not be one, because the hair is too short; but it is very little shorter than that of the famous Bacchus with Ampelus58 in the Gallery. They name it a Deus Praestes, a genius that presides over cities. It is a masterpiece of art, & stands on another no less beautiful, the Pedestal of bronze made by Lorenzo Ghiberti; on two of its sides are lovely Bas-Reliefs, one the Triumph of Ariadne drawn by Tygers, & preceded by Satyrs dancing; the other, Sacrifice of a Goat; Ornaments of Ivy & Vines with Ram's heads at the Corners, exquisitely fine! This Statue, & Pedestal were in the Collection of Fr: Maria, Duke of Urbino -\n\nHere begins the shorter side of the Gallery, from the windows of which you have a charming Prospect of the City, & its Environs -\n\nTerpsichore; 2 feathers stuck in her hair, that look like horns, in one hand what seems to have been a Flute; with the other she holds up her drapery, which shews the Naked through very skilfully -\n\nThe Ganymede; not so large as life. The head, arms, & feet restored by Benvenuto Cellini; the rest antique in the softest Greek style, of polish'd Parian marble, exquisitely beautiful! The Italian Sculptor has added a head,\n\n60\n\n& arms, that humour with much art the general turn of the statue. He is holding at arm's length a little bird, & with the other hand restraining the Eagle, who is reaching out his neck to get at it. Divine!\n\nThe Chimæra; a Lyon out of whose neck grows the head of a goat, in a posture of defence, & wounded in two Places; so that it is probable some statue of Bellerophon59 went along with it. The workmanship is hard, & rude -\n\nVenus pulling a thorn out of her foot; much less than life, in a gentile & easy attitude; the design better than the execution. It seems unfinish'd & rough.\n\nClio; her hand resting on the Cithera [lute]; in an awkward posture, extremely bad in all respects -\n\nThe Tuscan Oratour, in Bronze of great antiquity; stands at the head of the other long side of the Gallery. His right arm bare (for the Tunice has no sleeves at all) & extended, as of one declaiming, the Toga thrown over the left shoulder, but his hand appears from under it. On the Limbus [fringe, hem] of his Garment are 3 lines of Tuscan Characters, as yet undecypher'd, very good, & full of Spirit -\n\nTwo square Columns of excellent workmanship, a bas-relief of armour finely thrown together runs from top to bottom of both these - in good preservation.\n\nVenus & Mars; she is restraining him from the war, one arm round his neck, the other on his breast; he reasons with her. The Mars is naked, a helmet without any Crest on his head; a short broad Sword hangs by his side in a belt from his right shoulder. This figure is finer than Venus, who is a little gross in the Style of Rubens; she has drapery from the middle downwards, & bracelets on her arms just below the shoulder, & Sandals on her feet -\n\nApollo Cælispex, for that it certainly is, as the Mus: Florent: names it, and not Prometheus, as it is vulgarly named; especially as P. Victor has mention'd a statue in Rome called by the aforesaid title near the Circus Maximus. It is vastly larger than life; of an unpolish'd Marble, & not of that hue most antiques have, which I take to proceed from its haveing been clean'd at the time it was transported (to preserve it from the injuries of the weather) from Boboli Gardens to this Gallery. He is looking up to heaven; & with one arm pointing thither, in the other he holds a lighted Fax [torch], & leans on the trunk of a tree. Nothing can be more easy than the attitude, nor more majestick than the figure, his long locks flow with wonderful\n\n61\n\ngrace on the shoulders, a part of them is tied up on his forehead in a sort of Bow-Knot - perfectly fine -\n\nMars; of Basaltes, an Ethiopian Marble of a dark grey colour a little inclineing to a green Cast, remarkable for its hardness; yet nevertheless this statue has been broke all to pieces, but is perfectly well set together again. A crested helmet on the head, & sword (the hilt only remains) in the hand, quite naked; a shield on the left arm. Vastly great style, & full of Spirit -\n\nGladiatour, a naked figure; the arms are modern & not good; the rest is excellent -\n\nA Bacchanal Woman, crown'd with Ivy, grapes in one hand, in the other a Thyrsus [wand], at least the remains of one, a bracelet on one arm, & girt under the breast. It is a good figure, but tame, & without enthusiasm.\n\nThe famous Bacchus & Faun of Mich: Angelo. He holds a Vase in one hand & grapes in the other, which the little Satyr is eating with vast pleasure behind him. The swimming of "
