        "text": "The two bathing scenes in the book of Judith are clearly connected, and compose a unit (Jdt 10:3; 12:8-9). Both episodes refer to a full-body immersion (περικλύζομαι, βαπτίζω) at twilight, which has to be concluded before dawn according Jewish sources. As the text uses the typical terminology \"de-scending\" into the house for a bath in the first place, and \"ascending\" from spring water in the second for purity reasons (καθαρά), with a prayer being uttered, it is most likely that the author meant to convey the idea that Judith was running a miqweh at home. This would explain the otherwise highly questionable use of precious liquid under the circumstances of a siege when water was rationed. The book's author describes his main character Judith within a proto-Pharisaic setup. A Jewish audience would have appreciated the cultic-ritual hints in the text, but the Hellenistic or Roman reader would have understood the bathing scenes as profane ones and considered the heroine as obsessive about her diet.\n\nThe apocryphal history of Judith and Holofernes has always attracted and fascinated artists and art lovers over the centuries. The reproduction, both of the beheading of Holofernes and of the moments before and after this act, are among the religious scenes most represented throughout the history of art (painting, sculpture, literature and music) surviving even and resisting until the twentieth century. Artists such as Palma Vecchio, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Donatelo, Botticelli, Gustav Klimt and many others contributed to this episode, which is part of Western cultural imagery, as a recurrent theme of the historiography of art, crossing the centuries and being an essential part of the construction of their own identity and western culture. The aim is to discover the bible story of Judith and Holofernes, and why the Baroque period, concreted by the Italian painter Michelangelo da Caravaggio and Artemisia Gentileschi was the liveliest period of the theme. Initial research was based on the book, Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art, written by Mary Garrard. Further research was expanded by reading primary sources, such as the Story of Judith in the books of the Christian Old Testament, and scholarly journal articles within the fields of the biblical Judith and Gentileschi’s life. I also take as a reference and which is quite important, since it complements and emphasises the explanation of these works and are Wolfflin's \"Fundamental Concepts of Art\", which is a generalisation that explains the artistic works of Baroque Five points of view, that are: the linear and pictorial, surface and depth, closed form and open form, plurality and unity, clear and indistinct. These elements as I had already mentioned, are important because in a way, complement and end up being a more concrete way of analysing such works. And finally, a reflection on the image of Judith rather than on the symbolic context, a look at women as such since those times, and their connotation."
