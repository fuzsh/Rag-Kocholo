        "text": "In 2013, the world celebrated the birth of the great names of opera: Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) and Richard Wagner (1813-1883). Born the same year, they both became pillars of opera in the 19th century. Yet, Wagner and Verdi never met. While Wagner was encountering great success with Der Ring des Nibelunge, Verdi was becoming a reference of the Italia opera thanks to La Traviata and Aida...\n\nThis performance was a first opportunity for Wagner and Verdi to \"fight\", on the occasion on of the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of their birth in Munich. They both are armed with an orchestra, supporters and works they composed.\n\nThe set design and assembly of characters is set up to reveal facial expressions through a clever multimedia projection. It is an amazing show, full of humor and poetry, is presented by Carlus Padrissa and the theater group La Fura dels Baus."
