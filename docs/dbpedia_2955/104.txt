Ali has been working in the media industry since 2015. Currently working in content production at Byrdie, she previously was the digital editor at L’Officiel USA. A fashion and beauty fanatic, Ali covers everything from show reviews to CBD skincare recommendations to the definitive way to one-up your friends rocking AirPods Pro. Her work also spans the lifestyle and culture umbrella: Think the Gossip Girl reboot, quarantine memes, and interviews with the likes of Irina Shayk and Crystal Moselle.

Beyond her published writing, Ali has experience behind the scenes in all aspects of digital publishing, from copyediting to social media management to SEO. Passionate about uniting audience interests with an established brand identity, her top priority is engaging more readers with content that captures the moment in an inclusive, intelligent way. Sometimes, she’ll make a Harry Styles meme for good measure.
