As an editor who moonlights as an author, Kasim Ali has both edited other people’s work and had his own work edited. In the workshop, Editing Your Work, he’ll focus on how to think about editing your own work, where to begin with it, and all the tips and tricks he’s learned over his career to wrestle your manuscript into shape.

Whether it’s problems with plot, structure, beginnings or endings, bring your work along to this workshop where Kasim will walk you through the struggles that every author goes through when editing.
