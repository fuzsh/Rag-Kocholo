        "text": "Oh how I miss Robert Rodriguez since his Sin City, and this time, he teamed up with Avatar‘s James Cameron in a movie that should be larger than life in this decade, Alita Battle Angel. The concept of Alita is firstly brought by Guillermo Del Toro, and James Cameron is so enthusiast that he even created the domain of battleangelalita in 2000. After the long delay, the director of Robert Rodriguez was selected in 2015, and James Cameron stated that he brings back the concept back to life.\n\nAlita Battle Angel was adapted from manga Gunnm by Yukito Kishiro. The movie takes place on the future, 300 years from The Fall, the war that brings the apocalyptic theme and left human divided by two living environments: the rich are living in their own creation of floating city called Zalem, and Zalem is of course, supported by the poor who lives in the remains of the earth, a post-apocalyptic earth called Iron City. In Iron City, lives our Mister Geppetto, called Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz), a cyber-surgeon at day, a knight-warrior at night. Dr. Ido is the one who found the remains of an ancient technology that he implants to prosthetic body once dedicated for her daughter. He later called the cyborg as his daughter’s name: Alita.\n\nAlita (Rosa Salazar in motion capture), half Frankenstein half Pinocchio in the body of female teenager, learns a lot about her new environment, including encounter a boy teenager named Hugo (Keean Johnson), whose looks and hair nearly makes me believe that hair care and skin care still do exist beyond post-apocalyptic era. The only ability that matter in Iron City is playing Motorball, a mix between Nascar and roller skating played by killer cyborgs, and the one who wins the games wins the ticket to Zalem. The master of the game here is Vector (the always charming Mahershala Ali) and his doctor Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), Ido’s evil ex-wife. Alita later learns her past as one of the member of ancient troops who possess ancient battle technique and ancient powerful energy source. She also learns her real enemy who lives in Zalem, Nova (Edward Norton in a glimpse).\n\nMiss Salazar, whose body we recognized lately in Netflix’s Bird Box, has finally graduated from supporting role into leading role, and her motion picture performance is one of the most impressive beside Andy Serkis’ (of course no one could be compared to him) and Benedict Cumberbatch as the dragon Smaug in The Hobbit. Miss Salazar is compelling as a fighter with the face of an angel, and her doe eyes do makes us believe that she is still a teenager behind her battle ability. She is backed by ensemble casts of Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Skrein, but the most compelling one of course, Mahershala Ali. Mr. Ali’s role might be a small role here, but his sophisticated style still steals our eyes as villain who has been possessed by an even more villainy character.\n\nAlita is enjoyable actually, although the story is not built strong enough to complete the whole actions. Believe me, you better watch this movie in IMAX 3D to get the whole thrill. Other than the actions, the story was not compelling enough as an origin story. There’s too many questions left after the story ends: what it’s like to be in Zalem? If Zalem is this movie’s definition of Eden, then the life on Iron City is not quite belieable to be the opposite of that. Hey, at the post-apocalyptic era, we still can see clear skies, the sun still shines brightly during the day and the condo from I don’t know, 300 years before, is still existing and well-functioned. So, if this movie is a social critic to establish the difference between the rich and the poor, it’s clearly missed the point. We cannot see the strong reason why people fight their way to go to Zalem. Moreover, what did Nova actually want? If this is a dystopia world where Nova rules all, he didn’t give clear reason why he didn’t want Iron City’s citizen to go to Zalem. Then what did Planet Mars and the moon have to do in Alita’s background? Or most important question of all, who is Alita in her previous life?\n\nThe answer might be left for the sequel, but that was the reason this movie is too rushed, too stuffed, and loaded with so many information we might need to see the sequel. And, if the Avatar sequel takes like forever to be made, we might need to wait longer to see Alita Battle Angel’s sequel."
