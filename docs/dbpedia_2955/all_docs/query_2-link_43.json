I work with clients worldwide.\n\nI edit stories about REAL PEOPLE like the residents in a small Adirondack town that are rallying to save their beloved Christmas theme park, pioneering AIDS activists from ACT UP fighting for their lives, or\n\na student from rural Sudan who founded a nonprofit to end violence in his hometown.\n\nI’m just wrapped up editing 5 seasons/26 episodes of Tell Me More with Kelly Corrigan for PBS."
