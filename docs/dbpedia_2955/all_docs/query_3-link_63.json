        "text": "5 simple tips to get you an edge in your next job interview. #1. You are a solution to their business problem, not a candidate asking for a job. Run this like a sales deal. You are the salesperson selling your resume. This alone will take you much farther. #2. Research the company. Use AI to run prompts on their website, public materials, and social media/ podcasts. Understand their mission and value proposition. Prepare a point of view for the job in question. #3 The Insider - Talk to your friends or connections about the job and the key requirements. Ideally, you should have a trusted person on the panel or inside the company #4. Write a thoughtful personalized thank you email by the end of the day and share some professional content that you discussed in the small talk. #5. Demonstrate genuine curiosity in each person you’re meeting with prepared questions tailored to their background #Bonus In virtual interviews, Join early and overdress by 10%. Your voice projection and the overall set-up create a great impression. Buy good quality speakers and camera. Remember not to forget #4 - the thank you note. Your best-case scenario should be to get the job and the worst-case scenario should be to leave a good impression. DM me if you need the prompts for research.\n\nI once had a client reject a candidate because the candidate discussed politics before an interview. ❓ What happened ❓ The client and candidate were on a video platform a few minutes early. They were waiting for the second interviewer to arrive, so they started chit chatting. The call was the day after a political debate and the candidate brought it up as an icebreaker. He shared his views on candidates, the overall status of the political party, and the overall election. The client politely tried to redirect the conversation back to something less controversial, but he didn’t outright ask for the redirection. The second interviewer joined the call and the interview started. So, was this bad practice? Should politics never be discussed in an interview? Why or why not? Does it matter that this was before the interview started? Here is why the candidate was declined: ✔️The role is in BD; the candidate should know that chit-chat is very important at all times (esp if they are selling to a potential customer) ✔️The candidate was not picking up on the cues from the interviewer that the topic should be changed ✔️The company has decided to remain neutral and not take a political stance; their statement is on their website that the candidate should have seen There were lessons for all of us involved: Candidate: Even if it’s a topic that you are passionate about, an interview, or in this case the pre-interview, is not a place to bring up a controversial topic. Instead, bring up something you have in common you found in your research (fav sports team, pets, a sport you both play, etc). Do I want you to be you? Of course! But let's find the right place and time for certain topics 💯 Client: Do not be afraid to quickly change the topic. It will not reflect poorly on your company. Recruiter: Be sure to remind your candidates that pre-interview chit chat is just as important as the actual interview. #Group928 #executivesearch #executiverecruiting #interviewskills #csuite #privateequity\n\nResearch the company Dive deeper than just their website, look at news releases, and social media platforms and even try networking to find out information from current and/or previous employees. Analyse the job description Here is where the company will outline exactly what they are looking for and you can utilise this to showcase how your skills and qualities align with what they are wanting. STAR method Situation Task Action Result The star method will allow you to give the interviewer clear context on a scenario that helps answer an interview question. Practice common interview questions Practising questions will help with clarifying your thoughts and reasoning for potential questions. Prepare questions to ask You should never answer “no’ when an interviewer asks if you have any questions. You can make a list of questions specific to the job and company to help prepare what you should ask should the question arise. #InterviewTips #TopTips #InterviewPrep #JobTips\n\nBefore your next virtual interview, don't make the same mistake that some candidates make! 🚨 I've seen it happen too many times - candidates who don't test their technology beforehand and end up struggling during the interview. You can almost feel their stress and anxiety, even through the screen! 🤯 — Like the candidate whose audio wasn't working, and they spent the first 10 minutes trying to fix it, looking really stressed and flustered. — Or the one who couldn't find the mute/unmute button. As a recruiter, I'm always happy to help, but I can tell that the stress and anxiety affect their performance. Don't let this be you! 🙅♂️ Prior to the virtual interview, make sure that you: ✅ Check if your audio and/or video are working properly ✅ Get familiar with the virtual interview platform and its tools ✅ Ensure that your device and browser are compatible with the platform By testing your technology beforehand, you can: 👉 Feel less stressed and more confident 👉 Be better prepared 👉 Have a smooth and professional virtual interview experience! Don't risk it - take the extra 10 minutes to test your tech. Your future self (and your potential employer) will thank you! Good luck! 💪 #jobsearch #virtualinterbiew #interviewprep\n\nInterviewer: \"What do you know about our company and what we do?\" Such a simple question, and one that most candidates will get asked. Here are some of the responses I've had in the last month about Benefex: \"A company that provides products and services\" 🤔 \"A software company that provides customer support\" 🤦♂️ \"An HR system\" \"I don't actually know\" 😅 One person said something generic, then clearly went on to our website and started reading chunks out to me during the interview. ⛔🤦♂️ Let's start with why companies ask this question, it's to gauge: 1️⃣ The level of understanding the candidate has of what the company does. This is two-fold. 1 to know what to tell them about us that they don't already know. 2 to see how well they've grasped our product/market/niche 2️⃣ The level of interest. If someone can't be bothered to quickly read your website or advert/spec, it's unlikely they have a specific interest in your company. Not a deal breaker (for me) but companies will always rather people engaged with what they do. 3️⃣ The level of prep/research. Knowing what the company does is a basic level of prep for an interview. If they've not done that, are they actually interested in the role or company? So what should a candidate do before the interview? 🤓 Prep!! Even if that is a few minutes browsing the website, you should be able to summarise in a sentence what a company does. Some of the responses I've had is where people have listened to podcasts of our founder, read articles about us/written by us, watched online videos. 🗣 Explain what the company does - that's the minimum. The best responses I get are where people talk about using a similar product to ours before, or link to personal experiences (good/bad) and why they feel a product like ours is needed. 💬 Explain why you applied. What was it about the role and/or company that made you want to apply? Show some genuine interest. TL:DR - spend at least 2 minutes before an interview to make sure you know what the company does. #candidates #interviewtips #interviewing #talentacquisition #hiring #recruitment\n\nReady to level up your interview skills?

I'll go first. This one I actually witnessed a manager ask when I was tasked with shadowing an interview to provide interview coaching to this manager. ⛔ \"Where do you live?\" I cringed when he asked it. Afterwards, I asked him why he asks this question and he said: \"It tells me a lot about where people choose to live.\" WTF? Many interviewers like to ask this question to get an idea of where a person lives in relation to the work location. However, it borders on illegal as it might allow you to make inferences about a candidate’s race or ethnicity and could be considered discrimination if you choose not to hire the candidate. 👉 Here's what you really want to know: You want to know if commuting will be an issue for the candidate, so you can ask this question differently: ✅ We expect our salespeople to be in the office X days per week. Is the commute into the office going to an issue for you at all? See the difference? What are some other ridiculous interview questions you've been asked? What are some cringe-worthy questions you regret asking in the past (don't worry, this is a safe space) If you liked this real story - you might like my book documenting my mistakes and learnings from 28 years of building sales teams at tech startups. 🆓 There's even a free sample to download. https://lnkd.in/gka6WYbY"
