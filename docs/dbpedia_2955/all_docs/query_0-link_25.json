To help answer all these questions and more, let me introduce “My First Film.”\n\nThis brand-new video podcast by Alec C. Cohen, supported by ProVideo Coalition, will have weekly guests who are established feature film directors detailing their experience making their first movie. They’ll talk through their background, how they got into filmmaking, their opinions on Film School, and what other decisions led up to the idea of their first film. Then we’ll deep dive into every step of the process: writing, development, pre-production, production, post-production, and distribution. We’ll also try and touch on how the success of their first feature led to their second feature and other creative ventures.\n\nMake sure follow My First Film wherever you get your podcasts as well as on YouTube!\n\nOn this episode of Editors on Editing, Glenn interviews Maurissa Horwitz.
