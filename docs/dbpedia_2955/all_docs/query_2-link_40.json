        "text": "In this class, you’ll learn everything you need to get started with Final Cut Pro, and how to take your editing to the next level. We’ll work together to create a YouTube-style video following a 3-part workflow.\n\nA-Cut Assembly – We’ll create our project, import our footage, and get to assembling the A-cut. We’ll learn how use In and Out points effectively, how to append footage to our timeline and how to cut out all the inevitable mistakes and pauses to form a sharp, snappy edit. And we’ll learn a tonne of keyboard shortcuts on the way to make the process as efficient as possible.\n\nB-Roll Shenanigans – With our A-cut sorted, we’ll make our edit more interesting by adding B-roll – second camera clips, titles, transitions, lower thirds, images, screen recordings and even handwritten animations.\n\nCoats of Polish – We’ll add background music to sound more pro, sound effects to our titles and transitions, vocal effects to our audio track (compression and EQ) and colour grading to give our edit the look and feel we crave.\n\nIf you’re a complete beginner to Final Cut Pro, we’ll ease you in with the basic fundamentals before getting fancy with transitions and animations. And if you’re an intermediate or an advanced user, hopefully you’ll find something here that’s useful (the iPad handwritten animation trick is pretty neat).\n\nWho am I?\n\nMy name is Ali – I’m a doctor working in the UK, and on the side I make YouTube videos about medicine, tech and productivity. I taught myself how to film and edit two years ago, and in that time my channel has grown to over 350,000 subscribers and generates more revenue than my full-time job as a doctor does.\n\nI often get questions on my videos asking for editing tips, or how I get certain effects like timestamps and animated handwriting, so I thought I’d put this course together to show the start-to-finish workflow of how I make my videos, and to hopefully help anyone interested in becoming a content creator."
