        "text": "Replying to @theslyeagle\n\nNot bad! Getting a ms request is a great sign, but agents can't always take the time they want to take to offer specific feedback in their rejections. Keep submitting! #askDVpit\n\nReplying to @peterwaynebooks\n\nFantastic! Sounds like you've grown as a writer. If any of the agents said in their rejections they're interested in seeing a revision, get back to them and let them know what you've revised. If not, it's time to research new agents or get to work on something new #askDVpit\n\nReplying to @LaurenAbramo\n\nSeconding this! And I'll add that sometimes manuscripts that you think you've given up on are exactly what your agent/editor will want to see and revise with you a few years down the road. Keep writing, write something new. #askDVpit\n\nReplying to @AshwinWijay\n\nLots of editors are eagerly looking for submissions to take their mind off *gestures at world.* Just think about whether you're up for navigating negotiations and contracts. If that sounds like a nightmare rn, holding off might make the most sense. If not, go for it! #askDVpit"
