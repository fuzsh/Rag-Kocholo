        "text": "Are you curious to see what it looks like behind the scenes of a professional photoshoot? Today we are giving you an exclusive BTS look into a work day with Ali Harper, an incredibly talented commercial, interior, and lifestyle photographer with years of experience creating beautiful stock images for labels and magazines alike. We were eager to find out more about her process - from what it's like working with a team, to her favorite gear, and her editing process. In this blog post, join us as we go behind-the-scenes and uncover valuable insights into the creative process used by Ali Harper at work!\n\nBehind most to all of Ali's beautiful images is her team. For smaller interior locations she is able to shoot alone but for the majority of her sessions she has a team there to make sure everything runs smoothly. Her team consists of an assistant, stylists — food, prop, even HMU, etc — and the most important member, the clients. Ali shares with us that the client has the most important vision and working closely with them allows her to bring that vision to life. Each member of her team is a leader in their craft and watching them work is similar to witnessing magic.\n\n\"Gah, I love my crew! It has taken me a long time to accept that as a photographer, you can’t do it all.\" -Ali Harper\n\nOne of the most daunting things about starting or elevating your photography career is figuring out what gear you should invest in. Ali Harper has given us a list of her tried and true equipment to help you narrow down your choices.\n\nA big change Ali recently made to her workflow was switching from Lightroom AI to Capture One. In the video below, Ali edits some of her recent interior and stock photography for us in Capture One. She gives us further insight on to why she made the switch and how Capture One has helped her save time editing. She is editing all of the images with her very own REFINED x Ali Harper Preset collection.\n\nWatch as Ali edits some of her recent interior and stock photography for us in Capture One using her very own REFINED x Ali Harper Preset collection."
