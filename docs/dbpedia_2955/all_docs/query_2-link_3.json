        "text": "I know my manuscripts are in good hands with Ali Williams. Her thorough work instils confidence in me, and more than that, she works with me within my voice and style. As a disabled person, her support and kindness reassures me that I’m safe working with her in providing any accommodations I need.\n\n​\n\nAli’s technical abilities, extensive knowledge base, balanced feedback, and authorial eye has vastly improved my work, and I trust her with anything I write. She provides an excellent service which I completely recommend.\n\nWhen you work with Ali, you're not just getting an editor, but a cheerleader too. Her enthusiasm and passion for stories is second to none.\n\n​\n\nShe was a joy to work with, offering great communication and a swift resolution to any of my questions. I am forever grateful for her guidance, and keep her advice in mind when working on all of my current projects\n\nAs a new author and a neurotic perfectionist, I was nervous about the editing process and what it would entail. However, after talking to Ali, I had faith that she would help me get my work to its best point.\n\nShe did and then some. Not only is she a treat to work with, but she’s also top notch at her work. She took what was a shining egg and she made that sucker glimmer. The turnaround was also fantastic. Highly recommend, but don’t keep her too busy, I need her!\n\nAli Williams is truly a gem! It was my first time working with an editor, and I have never felt more confident that my work was in good hands. Her thorough, professional manner and kind enthusiasm put me instantly at ease. I could feel from the get go that she ‘saw’ my authorial voice and was just as equally keen in helping me polish my craft.\n\nAli’s feedback is extremely nuanced and in-depth, and I can say without a doubt that her masterful technical skills and supportive advice have had a great positive impact on my work. I’d recommend her to all new budding authors who feel hesitant to share their work with anyone. You could do no better!\n\nI have 80 traditionally published novels – all with a team of professional editors and copy readers – and felt quite panicky when, after accepting an invitation to participate in an indie published anthology with other USA Today bestselling authors, I was faced with putting my work out to my readers without the security of my ‘team’ behind me.\n\n​\n\nThe only person I could think of that I could trust with my work was Ali Williams. Not just because of her qualifications and skills, but because she has a passion for the story. I trusted her to be honest to that passion. And she was. She read, not only with precision to grammatical detail and style, but with a critical eye to the integrity of the story. Many people have editing skills. Grammar and structure are things you can learn.\n\n​\n\nBut what Ali brings to the page, in addition to those learned skills, the ‘ear’ for the story, is far more critical to the success of a book. And not something you can go to school to learn. I am extremely grateful, as my book releases this week, that it has Ali’s seal of approval."
