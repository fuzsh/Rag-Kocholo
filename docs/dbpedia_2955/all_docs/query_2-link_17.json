        "text": "Ali (McCart) Shaw (she/her) thinks her love for the written word might have something to do with the pungent odor of ink from her parents’ printing press, which permeated her senses before she even knew how to read. She has a bachelor’s degree in English from Willamette University and a master’s degree in book publishing from Portland State University, where she now teaches Entrepreneurship in Publishing. She also spent two years as a bookseller and sometimes still itches to create front-of-store displays.\n\nAli founded Indigo in 2006 and has edited a diverse range of nonfiction authors from Ram Dass to Rodney King, from Chade-Meng Tan to Kim Barnouin, and many emerging writers. She began editing audiobooks in 2018 and launched audiobook production as an Indigo service in 2020."
