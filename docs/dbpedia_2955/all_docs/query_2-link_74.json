Yes, you have got it right!\n\nIn this article, we will walk you through how to create YouTube and social media platform videos with three trending video editing methods – Alex Hormozi Style, Ali Abdaal Style, and Mr. Beast Style.\n\nAlex Hormozi Video Editing Method\n\nLet us first discuss the Video Editing Method of Alex Hormozi Style. Before we delve into the details, let us shed light on the breakdown of his videos, wherein you will observe the Rule of Six philosophy being implemented to captivate the audience and keep them hooked on his videos.\n\nHe breaks down each scene into six pivotal categories, each carrying its own significance: Emotion, Story, Rhythm, 3D Space, Eye Trace, and 2D Plane Screen. For every video, emotion is an integral component to keep viewers engaged from the start.\n\nTo achieve this, riveting visuals should be incorporated into your videos, just like Alex Hormozi does. He has developed his remarkable, unique approach of judiciously using visual effects to engage with his audience emotionally.\n\nThe following are the elements to be noted to edit videos like Alex Hormozi:\n\nTalking Head Style\n\nThe foremost element you will notice in Alex Hormozi’s videos is that he speaks directly to the camera to create a personal connection with the viewers. It leads to holding onto the audience’s attention and keeps them hooked.\n\nIt develops a sense of human touch with every message he shares and the brand he promotes. It builds trust and confidence in the audience that a real person is talking with them, looking straight into their eyes through the camera and conveying a sense of authenticity.\n\nMost importantly, it signifies that the videos are not scripted and that the speaker is trustworthy.\n\nAlso, by using hand gestures, a perfect mix of tone, and facial expressions, talking-head videos become visually intriguing and enable content creators to add more variety to their videos, thereby serving their audience with unique and catchy content every time.\n\nMake sure to incorporate these points of talking-head style to captivate your audience from the beginning and keep them hooked till the end.\n\nCompelling and Peppy Captions\n\nAnother element you will observe in Alex Hormozi’s videos is how shrewdly he designs his captions to ensure they are compelling, peppy and focused on the queries searched by the users. Almost every caption is crafted cleverly, exhibits uniqueness and relevance, and conveys meaning to engage with diversified audiences.\n\nIrrespective of viewers’ backgrounds, tastes, and interests, his captions resonate with diverse groups. His captions have powerful punch and memorable punch lines on trending affairs and social media content to ensure they capture a mass audience’s attention.\n\nHis captions are primarily on topics containing inspiring stories, positive messages, and thought-provoking questions, and most importantly, they are concise and to the point.\n\nPlaying with Zoom Effects\n\nAnother component that makes Alex Hormozi’s videos stand out in YouTube feed is the clever use of Zoom in and out effects to a significant extent. You will notice that he zooms in on a specific aspect in his videos, such as facial expressions or an object, to emphasize its importance and draw viewers’ attention to it and make them delve more into the video.\n\nIt is a witty trick to make viewers curious about what will happen next and make them think deeply. This technique is effective when you want to convey a crucial message or a point.\n\nIn contrast, he shrewdly uses the zoom-out effect to make the audience feel excited that a new section will come up now, empowering them to offer a fresh perspective and refresh their attention.\n\nWe recommend using zoom-out effects for building a transition between shots or shifting focus to key portions. Zoom-in is perfect for creating a surprising element.\n\nDynamic Sound Effects\n\nLastly, you will have been enthralled by the dynamic sound effects incorporated in Alex Hormozi’s videos, wherein he gives an immersive experience for his audience and connects them on an exciting journey.\n\nIt is a potent tool, especially when you have to keep viewers hooked on your videos in storytelling parts and make them feel they are about to receive a heart-touching message at the end of the story related to their life experiences and current life scenarios.\n\nFor instance, sound effects like a clock ticking or a busy road or crowded street are ideal to take users back to early struggle days by creating an intriguing transition sound effect.\n\nYou can even use noisy office sounds or a triumphant effect to convey a monotonous corporate life and a sense of achievement.\n\nTo summarize, by incorporating the above four pivotal components of Alex Hormozi Style Video Editing Method in your videos, you will experience a tremendous positive response and quality upgrade in your content.\n\nAlso, Alex Hormozi has developed a framework called “Value Equation.” It is a formula to help content creators, YouTubers, and businesses optimize their value for maximizing profits.\n\nThe formula is as follows:\n\nValue = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) ÷ (Time Delay x Efforts and Sacrifices)\n\nIt means that to generate higher value for your video content, you must increase the quality of your dream outcome and achievement. In contrast, you should reduce the time and effort required for content creation.\n\nAli Abdaal Video Editing Style\n\nLet us discuss the Ali Abdaal Style Video Editing Method and incorporate the learnings to augment your users’ experience and engagement with YouTube videos. Before diving into his strategy, you will have decoded the secrets if you keenly watch and observe his videos.\n\nIt is the scripting strategy of his YouTube shorts that makes him a master at storytelling. For instance, if you carefully review his short video “The Region Beta Paradox” with millions of views, you can straightforwardly demystify how cleverly he uses captions to solve a myth, explain a theory, or convey a story to make his audience stay engaged to his videos.\n\nThe following are the components to implement in your videos from Ali Abdaal Style Video Editing Method:\n\nUsing Original Hook\n\nIf you watch his YouTube short “The Region Beta Paradox,” you will notice it begins with his original hook (Ali Abdaal Style), which fills the viewers with curiosity. He judiciously uses words such as “You” to captivate the audience’s attention. It makes them consider whether to continue watching the video in only a few seconds.\n\nAli Abdaal’s selection of topics makes his viewers immensely involved right from the first few seconds. It enthralls the exciting journey and adventure they are going on and unlocks answers and new experiences through different video levels.\n\nAlso, Ali Abdaal uses a catchy word to provoke curiosity in the viewers – “You might be suffering from it right now.” It indicates he is trying to touch the audience’s pain point from the first click, and the “suffering” hook undoubtedly fetches him a mass audience.\n\nSimilarly, you should develop a hook that touches your audience’s pain points to make them watch your videos till the end.\n\nExamples\n\nOne of the salient components you will observe in Ali Abdaal’s videos is the clever use of examples at different stages of videos to provide resolution to viewers’ daily life problems. It is the biggest strength of his videos – shrewdly using examples to explain complex theories and make people’s lives easier.\n\nHis real-life examples persuade the audience to visualize them and immerse them deeply in storytelling, leading to watching videos till the end. We recommend giving practical examples of viewers’ pain points and explaining theoretical information wittingly.\n\nMake sure the examples you mention keep the users hooked and use the word “suffer” to make them feel that this video is not only talking about their sufferings but also giving solutions. It increases the retention rate and makes viewers return to your channel for more helpful content.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nEvery video, be it short or lengthy, is incomplete without a quick recap. It is paramount to mention key takeaways by summarizing the video to make users feel confident that their time was worthwhile and that they derived valuable meaning and information.\n\nIt will persuade them to return for more content and explore your existing content. Also, you can play with viewers’ psychology by asking them to like, comment, and share the video if they found it helpful and learned something.\n\nAlso, ask them to subscribe to your YouTube channel for more beneficial videos. In every Ali Abdaal short, you will notice a quick recap of the points we mentioned.\n\nAsk Questions\n\nOne excellent thing about Ali Abdaal’s videos is that he plays with viewers’ mindsets and convinces them to drop a comment below the video to create an engagement. Also, it augments the retention rate of his videos.\n\nYou can incorporate this technique, as your videos will still play while viewers are commenting. The likes of their comments and your reply will make them return to the same video. The higher the playtime, the higher your videos rank in the YouTube trending feed.\n\nIt is a well-planned and thought-out strategy of Ali Abdaal to make his videos stand out from the rest.

Ali Abdaal primarily uses two editing software – Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. The following are the areas wherein these two tools come in handy:\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro\n\nIt is beneficial when you want to perform initial video editing, trimming and cutting clips, and compiling them according to the script to ensure they match with the storytelling. It has a user-friendly interface and is prominent among video editors.\n\nAfter Effects\n\nIt comes in handy after the video is edited and shots are lined up systematically. This tool enables you to create intriguing and catchy graphics, effects, and animations through its rich library of advanced effects and animations. It helps give a professional, captivating, and Midas touch to the videos.\n\nCutting and Trimming Shots\n\nThe next paramount step is cutting and trimming your footage by identifying unwanted content and discarding it along with unnecessary pauses, shaky takes, blurry shots, and blunders while speaking to ensure the video content is crisp and concise.\n\nIt is the same thing you will notice in Ali Abdaal’s videos wherein he keeps his YouTube short videos duration within the limit and delivers informative content by being to the point.\n\nRotoscoping\n\nIt is a valuable technique Ali Abdaal incorporates in his videos. He cut attention-grabbing subjects out of footage using the Roto brush tool in After Effects software to paint over the cropped subject to give a selection outline and an eye-catching appearance.\n\nIt is helpful to drive the audience’s attention to a specific object where the speaker wants viewers to focus to create excitement.\n\nIncorporating Special Effects\n\nThe next component to implement in your videos is adding special effects to make them look attractive and entice the audience. In Ali Abdaal’s videos, you will observe outstanding use of special effects, such as paper tear and text animations.\n\nWe recommend exploring the After Effects library to discover or create the ideal effects that align with your video theme.\n\nMake sure to add the selected effects above primary footage in video composition by positioning and scaling adjustment accurately.

For instance, in an informative video on a sensitive topic, the background music shouldn’t be a lofi or joyful.
