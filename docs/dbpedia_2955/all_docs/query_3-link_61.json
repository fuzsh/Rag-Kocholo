        "text": "Most library eTextbooks are considered “Unlimited User Access,” meaning that all UCF students, staff, and faculty can access the eTextbooks simultaneously. This access, however, does not extend beyond UCF. Only UCF constituents are permitted to access and use the library eTextbooks. If the license lists something different, like “12 Simultaneous User Access,” then only 12 people can look at the eTextbook at one time. OER are different and designated by an “Open” license: anyone and any number of people (even beyond UCF) can access and use the OER.\n\n“Subscription” and “Owned” refer to whether the library purchased access to the eTextbook (owned) or the eTextbook is available through a subscription. Owned eTextbooks are stable and will remain accessible to UCF indefinitely. Subscriptions, on the other hand, may end. Students and faculty using eTextbooks marked as being on a subscription should double check with their librarians to ensure access will continue for the entire semester."
