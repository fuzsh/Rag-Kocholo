I specialize in nonfiction, memoir, and children's, and I’ve helped hundreds of authors write their books, prepare their manuscripts and proposals to send out to publishers and agents, and polish their words for publication, whether through a traditional publisher or indie publishing. As of 2020, I am an audiobook producer too, also through Indigo.\n\n​Here’s a sampling of some of my editing projects:\n\nServices include writing coaching, developmental editing, line editing, and proofreading. I run all my editing work through Indigo, which offers a variety of professional services for authors and publishers. You can learn more at www.indigoediting.com."
