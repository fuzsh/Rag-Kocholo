        "text": "How do novelists conceive of whole new worlds in a matter of a few hundred pages? How do journalists approach and capture a tough news story? How does a screenwriter develop plots and characters eventually meant to be seen rather than read? When it comes to the many facets of the age-old art of writing, how a story is told is sometimes a story in and of itself.\n\nIn this Shondaland series, How I Wrote It, we’re asking writers of various genres and disciplines to discuss their relationship to their craft and tell us how they tell their stories — through moments of brilliance and creative hurdles alike.\n\nFor Farah Ali, writing came in fits and starts, but despite a back injury and a major loss, she found the threads of her story — with the help of nightly runs and an ever-evolving soundtrack of music. In The River, the Town, readers follow Baadal in Pakistan as he navigates the end of his family as he knows it, the catastrophic effects of climate change, love, and more.\n\nThe following essay is inspired by the poem “Thank You, Antidepressants” by Zeina Hashem Beck from her book O.\n\nThe first name that my novel had was Wants and Needs. I started its first pages in January 2019. I was chasing a voice, only I wasn’t sure what that voice sounded like, and whenever I captured it, it was the wrong one. This was my pursuit for the next six months — sentences written, then erased, or written and rearranged, on the first 10 pages of this book. All that remained constant was that there was a young man, barely out of boyhood, and this was his story.\n\nBy summer, I realized I had become stuck in a loop. I had to resort to tricks to ignore those 10 pages, put electronic space between me and them: I opened a new file to work on the rest of the story; I put that file into a different folder so I wouldn’t have to look at that other, older one. That summer, I went to a writers’ workshop, and for a week, more space was created between me and the novel — a break where I had the chance to make new friends. Back at home, I returned to the novel at a feverish pace, writing despite jet lag. The young man changed to a boy reaching adulthood, and stayed that way. His was the voice the story had needed. There was more forward motion in the narrative now. What had happened was that while I had been manically revising those earlier pages, the rest of the story had been taking a firmer shape in my mind.\n\nI wrote almost every day, long into the night. Sleep was the only hurdle. Then, that autumn, my father passed away, and I became aware that I was left holding strands of unfinished conversations with him and unresolved thoughts about him. I was also aware that there was nothing unusual or special about that or about the grief that I felt. So, I jumped back into regular life, but I was very conscious of a distinct Before and After. When I went for my first run, I thought, This is the first time I’m running since he passed away. When I opened the story file, I thought, This is the first time I’m writing since he passed away.\n\nFor the next few months, Television and Joy Division were what I listened to as I finished the novel. I expanded into different points of views. The boy had a mother, Raheela, who was often cruel to her son, though she loved him, and I wanted to know what her deal was. There was another woman, Meena, and it turned out that she had her own piece of history. The boy had friends, and sometimes they talked briefly about their families or money or love but did not — could not — fix one another’s troubles.\n\nI was also aware that there was nothing unusual or special about that or about the grief that I felt. So, I jumped back into regular life, but I was very conscious of a distinct Before and After.\n\nMeanwhile, a friend suggested I start teaching. “It would be good for you,” she said. So, I designed short syllabi and spoke to children about writing and characters. My friend was right — this was very good for me. I have always loved having conversations with children; all the clichés about how funny, smart, wise, and earnest they can be are true. By winter, I had finished a draft of the novel and sent it to a friend, a different one. I worked on the suggested edits and sent the revised draft to an agent who would become my agent. He had more suggestions but said there was no rush — if I need to take time after my father’s death, I should. I said, “I’ll have it all ready in just a couple of months.” I discovered Slowdive and Air, and they became part of what I listened to when I wrote. In the afternoons and evenings, I revised my pages, and at night I went running. Unknown to me, the discs in my spine had begun to slip.\n\nWhen occasional red-hot pain shot down my leg, I thought it was because I had poor endurance. I ran three times a week, sometimes four, never longer than five kilometers, and always at 10 o’clock or later. It isn’t so much that I love the dark; it is just that I greatly dislike being out in the sun. I became unable to sit for long periods of time, so I wrote while standing at my table. I sent the novel to my friends from the summer and to the friend who had read the first draft. I hounded them with worries that were plaguing me about my story: “Is this believable? I know these things are possible, people can be this way with each other, say these things to each other, but is it believable?”\n\nBy spring, the novel was mostly finished and needed final revisions. Then the Covid pandemic lockdowns began, and one night, a couple of weeks into the new, ghastly world, the discs in my spine achieved complete rupture, and I could not move. One doctor said I wouldn’t be able to run again. In the long hours of bed rest and lockdowns, I revised the novel. One evening, I could not work my way through a particular section. The more I tried to describe it, the deeper it got buried underneath the pile of my clumsy words. That night I rediscovered an old, beloved song: R.E.M.’s “E-Bow the Letter.” I spent the next many hours watching over and over again as Michael Stipe sang it with Patti Smith, with Thom Yorke. I wrote to a friend, the one who had read the first draft, about this and about the troublesome passage in my novel. I wrote to my writers’ workshop friends about what the upcoming summer or rest of the year was going to be like. Perhaps in doing all this, I got distracted from the part I couldn’t make better. And when I went back to it, I was able to meet it halfway.\n\nWhen a couple more months went by and the novel was truly finished and my pain medication had gone down to twice a day, I decided to try going for a walk. It was 11 at night. I put on my mask and stepped out into the muggy, stifling 40° Celsius heat of a Gulf summer. For about five minutes, I walked, and then I couldn’t help myself — I began to jog, and I was afraid it would set me back, but it also felt so very, very good.\n\nFarah Ali is the writer of the short-story collection People Want to Live.
