Yet at the top of his game, both Ali's personal and professional lives face the ultimate test.",

        "text": "\"I'm only 22 years old, I ain't got a mark on my face, I must be the greatest!\"\n\nWhy Mann would be interested in making this film is obvious: Ali is a perfect Mann protagonist, he perhaps more than any other of the people in Mann's films fights hardest for his right to self-identification, his right to be whoever he wants in this world. His right to be called by the name he decides, the right to not to compromise on anything. Mann's social critique in this film is also his harshest (at least directly), the majority of the film focuses on Ali's fight against not another boxer, but the United States Government.\n\nOnce again, (like every Mann film) the…\n\nI’m still learning how to write a narrative review, so in the meantime, I’ll make a few points.\n\n1. The opening montage—grounding Muhammad Ali in history and situating him in the context of racial violence, the civil rights movement, the Nation of Islam, and nascent black celebrity culture—is brilliant and brilliantly-edited, easily one of the best sequences of Michael Mann’s career. And the first fight of the film, Ali’s bout with Sonny Liston, is thrilling and impactful, with Mann emphasizing Ali’s might and grace.\n\n2. Easily Will Smith’s best performance, even if he is a little one note at times. Unfortunately, and this might be a weakness of the script as well as Mann’s approach to the material, Smith doesn’t…\n\nA fitting follow-up to The Insider, in a way. Where other Mann films show their protagonists and antagonists trapped in the insular world of their professionalism, these two films find their heroes subjected to the active hostility of an entire system. In Jeffrey Wigand’s case, it is the industry he served for his whole career, but for Ali, it is establishment society itself. As he says in one scene set during his forced suspension from boxing over his draft dodge, he fights the biggest opponent of his career, “the entire U.S. government.”\n\nThe opening segment of the film has remained blistering an incisive across all three of Mann’s edits of the picture. A collision of pop culture and social upheavals…\n\nAction!: MANN MEN - In the Heat of Digital Mike's Manhunt\n\nAnother film I'm relieved to find that it still works. Will Smith had been working on serious projects and discarding his Fresh Prince image for a while, but this role cemented his reputation as a serious, Oscar-worthy actor. And I wonder, half joking, half seriously, if the infamous \"slap\" at the Oscars was meant to serve as a reminder that, yeah, Will was fantastic in King Richards, but that he was truly getting that Oscar for this movie. It makes you wonder if the man was possessed by the ghost of Ali that night.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Smith is the one who keeps the audience enthralled throughout Michael…"
