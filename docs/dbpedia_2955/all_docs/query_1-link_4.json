COATES AWARD FOR STUDENT EDITING:\n\nIsaiah Clarke – Spanish Springs High School\n\nJamie Diaz – California State University Los Angeles\n\nAriel Emma Martin – Chapman University\n\nAmerican Cinema Editors (ACE) will honor The Woman King director Gina Prince-Bythewood with the ACE Golden Eddie Filmmaker of the Year Award, which “recognizes an artist who exemplifies distinguished achievement in the art and business of film.”\n\nACE is also honoring film editors Don Zimmerman, ACE, and Lynne Willingham, ACE, for their career contributions to film editing. All will be presented at the 73rd annual ACE Eddie Awards on March 5 at UCLA’s Royce Hall.\n\n“A versatile trailblazer from day one of her career, Gina Prince-Bythewood has consistently entertained us with intimate films and global blockbusters that explore the human experience through formidable female characters,” says ACE president Kevin Tent, ACE. “A champion of diverse, character-driven narratives, her latest film — The Woman King — is the crown jewel of a career spent pushing boundaries and telling stories that touch our hearts and minds. She is a proud supporter of the editing community, and we’re thrilled to honor her with the Golden Eddie.”\n\nKnown for her authentic, character-driven work, Prince-Bythewood has written and directed such feature films as Love & Basketball, The Secret Life of Bees and Beyond the Lights. Other projects include directing the action drama The Old Guard starring Charlize Theron. She won the Nancy Malone Directing Award from New York Women in Film and Television for her work on The Old Guard. The film is among the top 10 most popular Netflix films of all time, with Prince-Bythewood becoming the first Black female director on that list. Prince-Bythewood, who decided not to direct the sequel, is a producer on The Old Guard 2.\n\nRegarding Zimmerman and Willingham, Tent says, “These two extraordinary editors are responsible for editing some of the most entertaining, moving and thrilling movies and television shows of our time.”\n\nWillingham started her film career as an apprentice editor at Paramount Studios almost 44 years ago. Over her career, she has cut numerous television series, MOWs, miniseries and pilots. Some of her work includes the miniseries Revelations and Empire as well as the series The X-Files, True Blood, The Son, Bloodline, See, Your Honor, Ray Donovan and Breaking Bad. During her five-year stint on The X-Files, she was nominated for an Emmy and an ACE Eddie for the black-and-white episode “The Post-Modern Prometheus.”\n\nZimmerman began his film career as an apprentice editor in music and sound effects. His first job as lead editor was on Coming Home, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. Throughout his more than 50 years in the film industry, he has edited Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Nutty Professor, Liar Liar, Patch Adams, Night at the Museum, Men in Black 3, Heaven Can Wait, Rocky III, Rocky IV and A Walk in the Clouds.\n\nThe American Cinema Editors (ACE) have announced the nominations for the 72nd Annual ACE Eddie Awards, recognizing outstanding editing in 14 categories of film, television and documentaries. The winners will be announced live during the ACE Eddie awards on March 5, at the Theater at the ACE Hotel.\n\nThe ACE Golden Eddie Filmmaker of the Year Award — traditionally recognizing a filmmaker who exemplifies distinguished achievement in the art and business of film — will be presented to the Sundance Institute for their exemplary work to diversify cinema. Film editors Lillian E. Benson, ACE, and Richard Chew, ACE, will receive Career Achievement Awards for their outstanding contributions to film editing. The Anne V. Coates Award for Student editing will be announced later.\n\nHere are the nominees for the 72nd Annual ACE Eddie Awards:\n\nBEST EDITED FEATURE FILM (DRAMATIC):\n\nBelfast\n\nÚna Ní Dhonghaíle, ACE, BFE\n\nDune\n\nJoe Walker, ACE\n\nKing Richard\n\nPamela Martin, ACE\n\nNo Time to Die\n\nTom Cross, ACE, Elliot Graham, ACE\n\nThe Power of the Dog\n\nPeter Sciberras\n\nBEST EDITED FEATURE FILM (COMEDY):\n\nCruella\n\nTatiana S.

A film editor, music editor and teacher, probably the best way to describe him is beloved. Since the news broke of his sudden death while lecturing in Japan, there has been an unending outpouring of love and respect for the man who edited Sophie’s Choice and Heathers.\n\nWe, at postPerspective, want to pay tribute to Norm by sharing just a few memories from those who knew and loved him.\n\n“Ten years ago, I was working on one of my first large, public technology presentations. I was passed Norman Hollyn’s name as a good resource. We had never heard of one another let alone met one another. Nevertheless, he gave over an hour of his time on a Sunday afternoon to talk with me. The time he spent with me — a stranger seeking knowledge — is the embodiment of who Norman was as a human and educator. This one talk evolved into one of the most rewarding and important friendships I’ve ever had.\n\n“As profoundly sad as I am, I take solace in the fact that if his friendship meant this much to me, how important was his impact to the tens of thousands of people around the world that he inspired, educated and — yes — friended? Then I smile, because I know he’d have some self-deprecating quip ready as a retort.\n\n“I know when someone passes, it’s common to remind folks to tell the ones they care about that they are loved. In this case, I humbly ask that you reach out to your educators — the ones that inspire(d) you, made you a better person, and a student of the world.” — Michael Kammes, BeBop Technologies\n\n“Norm was not just a really good guy who gave so much back to the community. He was also a friend. What I will miss the most is his sharp New York wit. When he would sit on Editors’ Lounge panels, and also moderate some of them, he could be counted on to keep things snappy and humorous. We enjoyed the challenge of busting each other’s chops and then going out for a drink afterwards. He has left a very large hole in our community, and a hollow place in my heart.” — Terry Curren, AlphaDogs/Editor’s Lounge\n\n“I had the good fortune to first meet Norman about 20 years ago. He was always eager to share his knowledge and did so in a most caring way. When we first met, he handed me his book; then years later, as the digital age solidified, he handed me a revised copy! A lot of people in our industry claim to have written the handbook for post production, but Norman actually did. His passion and excitement for all things post was infectious, and I, like all who got the chance to know him, are better because of our experiences with him. He will be missed.” — Mark Kaplan, Technicolor Production Services\n\n“I’m feeling so comforted by reading the hundreds of stories and tributes about the wonderful Norman Hollyn. His life and interactions with those around him were uplifting, and the lessons he taught went beyond film, and encompassed friendship, mentoring, humor and inclusion. We will all continue to be inspired by him for the rest of our lives and I’m forever grateful. Thank you, Norm!” — Jenni McCormick, American Cinema Editors\n\nThe joke was: “You would say, ‘He couldn’t carry my scissors’ when you were talking about someone you didn’t think had the talent. Norm could carry all our scissors!” — Herb Dow, ACE\n\nIn honor of Norm, LinkedIn and Lynda.com have made his LinkedIn Learning course, Foundations of Video: the Art of Editing, available free for an entire month.\n\nAnd if you want some Norm wisdom, here he is talking to our Barry Goch at last year’s HPA Tech Retreat.\n\nMain Image Courtesy of Editor’s Lounge.\n\nThe American Cinema Editors (ACE) have set its lineup of editors for EditFest London, which takes place on June 30 at BFI Southbank. In addition to film panels, this year’s event will feature editors drilling down on their experiences editing television crime dramas, followed by a panel discussion focusing on the jump from assistant editor to editor.\n\nEditFest, which was launched in Los Angeles in 2008, allows attendees to talk with panelists and colleagues throughout the day, over lunch, and then during a post-event reception.\n\nThe editors at EditFest will share experiences and insights from their work on a variety of feature films, documentaries and broadcast and streaming content.
