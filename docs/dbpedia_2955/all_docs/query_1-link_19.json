His research spans various areas, including cooperative work, Dial-a-Ride scheduling, and studying generative algorithms via evolving flying machines in Minecraft. His work in evolutionary computation focused on improving generative AI to be better at content creation for video games. Alejandro developed a fitness function that successfully generated diversity and high-quality flying machines. Alejandro also led a project to implement and perform evaluation of a dial-a-ride scheduling problem, providing empirical insights to complement previous theoretical findings.
