        "text": "In April, Random House published an extraordinary novel with a mysterious his tory. “Ali and Nino” was orig inally published in Vienna in 1937 under the pseudonym Kur ban Said,. It was then forgotten until Jenia Graman, an artist who lived in Berlin during the 1930's, recently came across a Copy of the Viennese edition and translated it.\n\nWho was Kurban Said? An introduction by John Wain pro vides the meager information that could be pieced together. He was a native of Azerbaijan, the little Transcaucasian coun try adjoining Armenia and Georgia on the Caspian Sea where the story is set. He lived in exile in Europe, having ap parently left his homeland after it came under Soviet rule in 1920. To all appearances “Ali and Nino” was his only book. He was thought to have fled Vienna for Italy in 1937 when the Nazis came. His name and when and where he died were unknown.\n\n“One thing is certain: he had genius,” Mr. Wain rightly says. As a schoolboy in the dusty town of Baku before World War I, the young Moslem aristocrat Ali falls in love with Nino; an ex quisite Georgian princess whose Western outlook is utterly for eign to his. The story of their love and marriage, both funny and tender, is developed against a shifting background of Czarist, Turkish, Allied and Soviet control of Baku. Kaleidoscopic cross cultural allegiances become sharp‐edged political realities; the question of whether Baku is to belong to East or West is an swered with Ali's gallant, futile ‐death behind a machine gun as the Red Army moves in.\n\n“Kurban Said” makes the subtle, alien sensibility of the Moslem Ali both understandable and attractive. He is a Witty, delicate writer with complex resources of irony and passion, a sophisticated grasp of social change. The author of “A Passage to India,” you feel, would have admired “Ali and Nino.” Now two Azerbaijani living in this country have unex pectedly come forward with a highly plausible identification of Kurban Said. Mustafa Turkekul is a literary scholar, author of a monograph on the writers of his country killed in the Soviet purges of 1937 (“Huseyin Cavid,” Istanbul, 1963). Under the exigencies of exile, he works as an auditor in a Washington hotel. Josif Kahraman, a teacher, works as a radiologist in a Washington hospital.\n\nIt was Mr. Kahraman who called his friend's attention to a review in The Washington Star of a novel about their homeland. The two stayed up all night reading “Mi and Nino” and vouch for its authenticity (recognizable streets, palaces, traditions, family names). Their conclusion is that the book is unmistakably the lost work of a writer celebrated in Azerbaijan: Yusif Vezir, who signed his other books “Cemenzemenli.”\n\nCemenzemenli was born in 1887 in Shusha, the green, ancient city of “wonderful liars” to which Ali pays an affec tionate visit early in the novel (“‘We have everything! Walk through the town and look around—does anybody work? Hardly anybody! Is anybody sad? Nobody! Is anybody sober? Nobody! You'll be amazed, sir!’”). After his boyhood there, Yusif Vezir moved to Baku sometime around the turn of the century, finished his schooling and took a degree in law at Kiev.\n\nYusif Vezir was an aristocrat, a linguist, a precocious writer, a political activist. As a student he began to publish stories in Molla Nesreddin, a satirical magazine critical of the Czarist regime, patriarchal conservatism and religious fanati cism. He went on to publish a number of novels and tales between 1909 and 1915. When the short‐lived Republic of Azer baijan was established in ‐1918, he was Chief of Protocol in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (a role Ali performs in the novel with his dinner party for visiting British dignitaries); he then went to Istanbul as Ambassador to Turkey, leaving his wife and child in Baku. With the fall of the Azerbaijan republic and the Soviet takeover in 1920, he left Istanbul for Europe instead of returning home. For the next 10 years he lived first in Paris, then in Berlin and Vienna.\n\nHere his story diverges from the sketchy information about Kurban Said. In the early 1930's, at least five years before the Viennese publication of “Ali and Nino,” Yusif Vezir abruptly left Europe without a word to acquaintances there, and went home to Baku. He had been promised full amnesty by the Communist regime, but Mr. Turkekul believes he took the pre caution of leaving the manuscript of “Ali and Nino” in safe keeping with a friend.\n\nMr. Turkekul was a student at the University in Baku in 1935. He remembers Yusif Vezir Cemenzemenli as a handsome, very elegant man in his late forties, in frock coat and wing collar, whose lectures on literature attracted crowds of students in Baku and in Tiflis, where he commuted by plane. He was outspoken advocate of Azerbaijan's native literary tradition (during his ambassadorship to Turkey he had published a his tory of Azerbaijanian literature), and in the 1937 purge of writ ers, poets and intellectuals he was one of the first to be arrested and his works suppressed. By the time “Ali and Nino” was published in Vienna, Mr. Turkekul believes, its author was already under arrest at home and perhaps dead.\n\nIf the attribution to Cemenzemenli proves correct, “Mi and Nino” is not an autobiographical novel in the simplest sense. (Yusif Vezir was a decade older than Ali during the historical period of the novel, his wife, to the best of Mr. Turkekul's recollection; wasn't Georgian, etc.) But it is haunting to think of Yusif Vezir, in the comparative safety of exile, creating a young lion who declines to escape to Paris with his Nino and chooses to meet death on his own soil; and then to think of Yusif Vezir returning to Azerbaijan in middle age, to meet his own death at the hands of the same adversaries.\n\nCharlotte Mayerson, Random House editor of “Ali and Nino,” is already looking into the possibilities of translating Cemenzemenli. Since the post‐Stalin thaw his works have again become available in Azerbaijan, and an avenue is named after him in Baku. “Cennetin Kebzi” (“The Permit to Paradise”) is a comic novel that turns on a religious fanatic's promise, to a guileless hero, of entry into heaven. “Studentler” (“Students”) is an autobiographical novel about university life. “Kizler Bulagi” (“The Maidens' Spring”) is said to depict the wed ding rites of an ancient Turkish tribe with the exotic appeal of the sections in “Ali and Nino” about the poets' public con test in Shusha, the wedding visit to Nino's Georgian relatives, or the newlyweds' sojourn in Persia. There are several other novels and two collections of stories to be explored.\n\nWe may still find “Ali and Nino” to be its author's master piece—the perspective of exile having provided it with an ironic complexity and a unique appeal for Western readers. Both Mr. Turkekul and Mr. Kahraman insist this isn't so, that the suppleness, wit, humaneness and sophisticated art so ap pealing in “Ali and Nino” are characteristics of Cemenzemenli's untranslated works. Certainly “Ali and Nino” is such a dis covery that anything else its author may have written is worth investigating. The possibilities are exciting."
