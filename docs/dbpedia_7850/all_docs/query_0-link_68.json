        "text": "Sutter Street Theatre announces 2018 season\n\nBy: Telegraph Staff\n\nFolsom’s Sutter Street Theatre announced their 2018 season schedule this past Sunday, Nov. 5, during their annual Gala and Season Announcement Party.\n\nThe season is filled with a great variety of shows to appeal to all tastes in both the Off-Broadway Series and Family Series.\n\nThe season opens with the return of the Carsino Show, a takeoff on a mafia-style Johnny Carson show. The theater also has two original shows – Straight Camp and Choices, a show that will eventually travel to schools in their Breaking Boarders school program.\n\nThe Off-Broadway series brings you an Agatha Christie play, Murder on the Nile, the ever popular On Golden Pond, the very funny Duck Hunter Shoots Angel, Ken Ludwig’s delightful comedy Moon over Buffalo and a new play called The Kids Left, the Dog Died, Now What.\n\nThe theater is also bringing order lexapro online five musicals to the Off-Broadway Series including Spelling Bee and We Will Rock You. And of course, Evil Dead will be back for its eighth year as well as Holiday in the Hills to brighten your holiday season.\n\nIn the Family Series there will be five musicals including the charming Twelve Dancing Princesses, The Magic Toyshop and the hilarious play Humpty Dumpty is Missing or The Mysterious Case of the Fallen Egg, plus The Adventures of Sleepy Hollow.\n\nAmong the others, the popular Little Woman will bring its wonderful story to the stage.

In addition, the theater’s workshops will be performing Les Mis, Jr., 101 Dalmatians and Mary Poppins.\n\nAll shows are subject to obtaining final rights to produce so check the theater’s website at SutterStreetTheatre.com to confirm shows.\n\nReview by Gerry Camp\n\nAs always, the Sutter Street Theatre is great at musicals. And their newest, Larry King and Peter Masterson’s “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,” is up to their highest standards.\n\nIt’s the story of a brothel in the imaginary town of Gilbert, Texas in the 1970s (based on true events) which is a delightful place to work or visit. Presided over by Miss Mona (the wonderful Connie Mockenhaupt), under the protection of the sheriff (Connie’s husband Mike Jimena, who is perfect in the part and steals the show), the brothel’s “guests” include the mayor and the local football team, who look forward to their annual orgy as they make clear in a wonderful locker room dance.\n\nA local TV personality with a ridiculous head of hair (played way over the top by Jay Evans) decides to close down the business, causing panic among the working girls, the politicians, and the guests. Even the governor, a delightful David Valpreda, is upset, but like a typical politician, he does “The Sidestep,” which is a hilarious song and dance.\n\nHere’s what I liked about the show:\n\nAs Jimena said when introducing the play on opening night, Sutter Street Theatre is a family. As a regular, I was especially delighted to see family members I love having a great time. In addition to Connie and Mike, I especially buy lexapro without perscription enjoyed a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe best moment in the show came when Hannah Hurst, who has been excellent in dozens of shows, appears to apply to work. Dressed modestly, she seems totally inappropriate, and is told so by Miss Mona. Her back story is revealed in one tiny nod, the most moving bit of acting of the evening. She is given the work name “Shy.” Though the part is small, “Shy” is the character you’ll be talking about after the show.\n\nMy second favorite is Christopher Celestin, Elly nominated actor (and playwright!) who has been working behind the scenes too much lately. In this show, he steps in and out of four parts with the ensemble of young males, but in seconds in each scene he’s in he becomes the one you watch.\n\nMusical accompaniment is provided effectively by Cory and Kale Coppin. The songs, while not great, are often funny and pleasant. Mockenhaupt has the best, the show-closing “Bus From Amarillo.” Allison Gilbreath’s direction and the accomplished choreography by Connie Mockenhaupt and Dian Hoel ensure there is never a dull moment. The “working girls” at the Chicken Ranch are lovely and sexy, and their song and dance numbers imply they are happy in their chosen profession.\n\nClick Here to Purchase Tickets\n\nSUTTER STREET THEATRE SPOTLIGHTS AN AMERICAN CLASSIC\n\nReview by Gerry Camp\n\nFolsom’s treasure, Sutter Street Theatre, can seemingly do anything, from classic comedies, full-cast Broadway musicals, gross-out farces, and delightful family stories. And sometimes—not often enough, in my humble opinion—they tackle one of the great plays. This they’ve done by bringing us Thornton Wilder’s masterpiece, “Our Town,” playing through July 16.\n\nMost readers will know that the play depicts life in a small town, Grover’s Corners New Hampshire, in the early 1900s. It is presented on a bare stage—here all black—with few props, the actions being mimed by the cast. The play frequently reminds us that it is a play as the main character, known only as the Stage Manager, narrating the story, moving back and forward in the characters’ lives, speaks directly to the audience throughout.\n\nTo pull this off demands actors who become the characters, making the audience believe in their lives as the Stage Manager tells their stories, showing life’s universal patterns, their daily lives, love and marriage, and death.\n\nDirector Allen Schmeltz has assembled a cast who draws us in completely. James Gilbreath is warm and compassionate, with frequent gentle humor, as the omniscient Stage Manager. The focus of the story is on George Gibbs (Daniel Putman), the son of the local doctor (Keith Casey) and his wife (Jessica Plant), who falls in love with his next-door neighbor, Emily Webb (Lauren Tyner, who steals the show, positively glowing in the heart-breaking part).\n\nThe two mothers selflessly but unsentimentally manage cheap lexapro their families. Doc Gibbs is overworked, but has a moving scene with George when he suggests that he be of more help to his mother. Rich Kirlin is perfect as Emily’s father, especially when he has an awkward talk to George on the morning of the wedding, suggesting afterward that there should be a custom where the father of the bride is never alone with the husband-to-be. His scene before the wedding, in which he gives Emily to George, wonderfully conveys a father’s love and feeling of loss.\n\nMaybe I’m being a spoiler when I reveal that the third act is about Emily’s death at twenty-four in childbirth. Joining the other recent dead in the cemetery, she decides, against their advice, to go back and re-live her twelfth birthday. I defy anyone, whether you’ve seen the play before or not, to hold back tears as she learns that nobody realizes the beauty of life while they’re living it. She finally lets go, speaking the play’s most moving lines: “Good-by, Good-by world. Good-bye Grover’s Corners . . . Mama and Papa. Good-by to clocks ticking . . . and Mama’s sunflowers. And food and coffee. And new-ironed dresses and hot baths . . . and sleeping and waking up. Oh, earth, you’re too wonderful for anybody to realize you.”\n\nMany reading this will have seen the play before. Never mind; if you love great theater you owe it to yourself to see this wonderful production of one of the American theater’s greatest works.\n\nAudition Notice “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas”\n\nWhen: June 25, 7:00pm\n\nWhere: Sutter Street Theatre, 710 Sutter Street, Folsom CA 95630\n\nDirector: Alison Gilbreath\n\nPlease bring a prepared song (18 measures) with piano music or a CD.

Full of fun and gusto, it is a thigh-slapping, good natured little musical full of tuneful songs and bright, entertaining dances.\n\nBased on a true story, “TBLWIT” tells of the demise of a brothel, down a little dirt road near Austin that put Texas in the news several years ago when Larry King wrote up the incident in a magazine. The place was called the Chicken Ranch because the good ol’ boys who couldn’t pay real money settled their accounts with chickens. When a cornball TV personality from Houston started barking at Miss Mona’s high heels, he caused such a ruckus that the local politicos, most of whom were regular customers, forced the Sheriff to close the place.\n\nCasting:\n\nMiss Mona Stangley – this role is cast\n\nSheriff Ed Earl Dodd (baritone, 35-55) – The sheriff who has had a long-standing relationship with the Chicken Ranch and Miss Mona.

Of the dozen or more community theaters in this area, Sutter Street is the only one who year after year brilliantly puts full cast Broadway musical theater on its impossibly small stage.\n\nThis year’s offering is “Oliver,” Lionel Bart’s adaptation of Charles Dickens’ “Oliver Twist.” From this grim novel of orphans finding ways to stay alive amid slave-like workhouses and criminals Bart has fashioned a show, directed by Connie Mockenhaupt, with wonderful songs you’ll be singing all the way home. The workhouse orphans open with their desire for “Food Glorious Food.” Oliver (played with charming innocence and a lovely voice by Jonathan Matta), after asking for more gruel, is sold by pompous Mr. Bumble (Mike Jemina) to an undertaker and his wife (Sonny Alforque and Laura Smith): “That’s Your Funeral.” Bumble has a hilarious scene in which he attempts to seduce Widow Corney (Dian Hoel, usually Sutter Street’s choreographer and dancer who shows she’s also a terrific screamer): “I Shall Scream”!\n\nOliver escapes to London where he is befriended by Artful Dodger (Benjamin Matta) and welcomed into aging criminal Fagin’s youthful pickpocketing gang with “Consider Yourself.” Fagin (a sinister but charmingly seductive Chris Witt) and the gang suggest “You’ve Got to Pick a Pocket or Two.” Oliver earns the affection of the prostitute Nancy (the always glorious s Alison Gilbreath) and the suspicion of her big, dark, chilling boyfriend, thief lexapro Bill Sykes (a terrifying Jay Evans). Nancy’s soaring pledge of loyalty to Sykes, “As Long As He Needs Me,” is the musical peak of the show.\n\nOther musical highlights are Oliver’s yearning “Where is Love?” Oliver and the ensemble’s “I’d Do Anything,” and Fagin’s contemplation of reforming his life, “Reviewing The Situation.” Chris Witt as Fagin is new to Sutter Street, and his subtle performance steals the show! He has a long history in theater, and I hope he sticks around so we can see what else he can do.\n\nCostumer Eileen Beaver (with three helpers) as always does a wonderful job putting the cast of near thirty into period costumes. Set designer Mike Jimena has created a beautiful London skyline over London Bridge, which also becomes the enclosure of Fagin’s den, the Three Cripples Pub, and other locations through the use of moveable prop pieces. Mockenhaupt’s direction and vigorous choreography make sure the activity never slows. Audience members in the front row are literally inches away from flying arms and legs and occasionally flying bodies.\n\nThere is some graphic violence in this play. If bringing young children to a performance adults should be aware and prepare them. Those who know how superbly Sutter Street does musicals won’t need my recommendation, but if you haven’t seen them before, you won’t find a better evening of theater anywhere close by. But get tickets early; the show will probably sell out, as it surely should.\n\n“Holiday in the Hills,” A Folsom Tradition at Sutter Street Theatre\n\nReview by Gerry Camp\n\nFor many families, the holiday season is the time for traditions. For some families in the Folsom area, Sutter Street Theatre’s annual production of “Holiday in the Hills” is not to be missed. Written by the managing directors of Sutter Street, Connie Mockenhaupt and Mike Jimena, the show has just opened its eleventh incarnation.\n\nIn her “Director’s Notes” in the program, Mockenhaupt explains: “The story takes place in the late 1800’s right here on Sutter Street where the residents of the town and surrounding areas have gotten together to celebrate the Holidays. A lot of research went into the people and places that were here in the late 1800’s, give or take a year or two, and everyone you see was an actual resident or visitor to Folsom at that time of year.”\n\nSound like a boring history play? Nothing could be further from the truth. The research Mockenhaupt speaks of is all in the play’s Playbill, not on the stage. What is on the stage is the most scintillating evening of holiday-themed song and dance I’ve ever enjoyed. You won’t care that Kelly Mauro is playing the part of Elizabeth Hood, who operated the Western Exchange House. On Sutter Street’s stage Mauro, an Elly award winner, is a beautiful singer and spirited dancer, and she plays violin for a “hoedown” dance number. Her daughter Grace, also an Elly winner, is identified as Irma Levy, a talented young student, and Mauro’s eight-year-old daughter Annie, a charmer who steals the show for the second year buy lexapro escitalopram running, is identified as Fannie Hake, who became a famous Dance Hall Entertainer. But there is no “final exam” where you will be expected to name the characters. Instead, you will sit entranced at the beauty and charm of this family of performers.\n\nAnother family, frequent performers at Sutter Street, is the Matta clan, here represented by brothers Benjamin, Jonathan, and Joshua and sister Rebekah. Never mind who they are supposed to be playing, just enjoy their fantastic dancing and singing.\n\nDian Hoel is supposed to be stage performer Adah Isaacs, who performed tied to the back of a running stallion. At Sutter Street, Dian, in addition to performing in this show, is also the show’s choreographer, who has made the cast of 34 into professional-quality dancers.\n\nI can’t forget Connie Mockenhaupt, the show’s co-author and director, as the saucy Emma Spencer, the town madam, who flirts shamelessly not only with the men in the cast, but those in the audience as well. And Connie’s husband, Mike Jimena, holds the show together as Peter J. Hopper, the owner and editor of the Folsom Telegraph. His reading of “The Night Before Christmas” is always a highlight of the show. And John Wilder’s brilliant non-stop keyboard accompaniment can’t be topped.\n\nIf “Holiday in the Hills” is not one of your family’s annual traditions, perhaps it should be. See this year’s show and you’ll likely resolve to return next year and hopefully many years to come. It is the most fun show you’ll see this Holiday season! Oh, and you will be a participant in the show as well. Guaranteed."
