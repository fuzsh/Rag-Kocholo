Inspired by his TV hero, Patch bravely leads the charge when cold-hearted Cruella De vil and spot-obsessed artist Lars plot to round up all the Dalmatians in London. As Patch and Thunderbolt embark on a quest to save the dogs from Cruella, they discover their inner strengths and prove once and for all that Thunderbolt is a real-life hero and Patch is a true \"One-Of-A-Kind Wonder Dog!\"",
