        "text": "The Ultimate Disney MovieToons & DisneyToon Studios Animated Film Guide\n\n1990-1999 | 2000-2003 | 2004-2005 | 2006-2009 | 2010-2015\n\nBetween 1990 and 2015 the Walt Disney Company had two film studios using the Disney name. The prestigious Walt Disney Animation Studios made films that were classed as 'Walt Disney Classics' while the other animation studio, Disney MovieToons, later renamed DisneyToon Studios, had a more modest agenda. A division of Walt Disney Television Animation, it adapted Disney's popular television cartoon series and made sequels to recent Walt Disney Animation Studios films, largely as direct-to-video productions (sometimes using the title Disney Video Premieres) but occasionally their films were released in cinemas. This was because of a change in Walt Disney policy in the 1980s introduced by a new Chairman, Michael Eisner. He reversed Disney's decision not to make either animation for television or sequels. Since its foundation, Disney MovieToons had been headed by Sharon Morrill, the most senior woman at Disney.\n\nThe key to their ability to produce a vast amount of animation was outsourcing the work to newly-opened animation studios in countries all around the world . By utilising all these facilities they could churn out low-budget animated films quickly as the first half of a film may be made in one studio, for example Australia, while the second half was made in Japan. By 2000 Disney MovieToons had successfully released two films in the cinema to a modest reception and had an unprecedented success with direct-to-video film The Return of Jafar. Their outputs up to that date had all been inspired either by Disney Classic Animated Films of the 1990s or by their recent animated television series, such as The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1988-1991).\n\nCompetitors\n\nBy 2000 the animation landscape had completely transformed since 1990. There were now several animation studios, including Disney's prestigious friendly-rival Pixar. Yet in the competitive animated film market there were both winners and losers, including among big-named studios. Warner Brothers formed Warner Brothers Feature Animation and released Space Jam (1996), Quest for Camelot (1998), The Iron Giant (1999), Osmosis Jones (2001) and Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003). All but one of these films flopped: only Space Jam made a profit. Twentieth Century Fox founded Fox Animation Studios which made two films: the successful Anastasia (1997) and the disastrous flop Titan AE (2000). Fox also owned Blue Sky Studios, which started releasing CGI animated films in 2002. The biggest threat to Disney was DreamWorks SKG whose animation department was led by Jeffrey Katzenberg who had been Chairman of Film Production for Walt Disney during the 'Disney Renaissance', the successful period between the release of The Little Mermaid (1989) and Pocahontas (1995). Determined to compete with Disney head-on, it made animated films using traditional techniques, CGI and stop-motion. It even briefly competed against Disney MovieToons in the direct-to-video market, but Joseph: King of Dreams (2000) flopped and so plans to make more full-length direct-to-video productions were abandoned.\n\nDisney themselves seemed to have lost direction and competed by increasing the quantity and decreasing the quality of their animated films. This led to Walt Disney Feature Animation's films flopping or underperforming. Disappointments included Fantasia 2000 (2000), Dinosaur (2000), Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001), Treasure Planet (2002), Home on the Range (2004) and Chicken Little (2005). How would the fledgling, low-budget Disney MovieToons fare in a market where their big brother was struggling and Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox had failed? Especially at a time when the traditional cel animation style Disney MovieToons specialised in seemed to be supplanted by computer animation?\n\nThe Films\n\nBelow is a summary of the films made by Disney MovieToons during this period. Recurring characters and actors are shown in Bold as well as whether the films were released in the cinema or went direct-to-video. Please note that Disney use both numbers and Roman numerals interchangeably, so that a film titled 'II' on screen may have '2' on the front cover of home media releases and vice versa. Also mentioned is whether the films pass the Bechdel Test (this can be summarised as whether the film involves two or more named female characters who have a conversation together that does not include or mention any male characters). The film's European runtime is also included .\n\n12. The Tigger Movie (2000)\n\nDirectorJun FalkensteinReleaseCinemaPlotTigger is tired of being the only Tigger and wishes to find his family. Though winter is coming to the South of England, Tigger, Winnie-the-Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore try to find Tigger family members, only for Tigger to sink into depression. After Roo writes a letter supposedly from his family hoping to cheer him up, Tigger is convinced his family are coming to visit.

It marks the first time that the Sherman Brothers returned to Disney since Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), 28 years earlier. The Disney animators travelled to Sussex to ensure that the film reflected the real places that Christopher Robin knew, yet there are Americanisms such as US mailboxes rather than UK postboxes. The Hundred Aker Wood is also hit by an avalanche, which is not a phenomenon common to the Sussex countryside. John Fiedler is the only actor to have reprised his role from the first animated film.\n\nThe Tigger Movie enjoyed a highly-successful cinematic release and was the sixth most successful animated film of the year, ahead of bigger-budgeted films such as Walt Disney Feature Animation's Fantasia 2000, DreamWorks Animation's The Road to El Dorado and Fox Animation Studio's Titan AE, and behind only Disney's Dinosaur, Aardman's Chicken Run, Disney's The Emperor's New Groove, PokÃ©mon: The Movie 2000 and Nickelodeon's Rugrats in Paris. Not bad for a film originally conceived as a direct-to-video film to be titled Winnie-the-Pooh and the Family Tree.\n\n13. An Extremely Goofy Movie (2000)\n\nDirectorDouglas McCarthyReleaseDirect-to-Video Plot\n\nMax is off to university, finally able to live outside his father Goofy's shadow. The university has cult-like Frat Houses with strange ceremonies. One, Gamma Mu Mu House, traditionally wins everything and looks down on everyone else. Max and his friends PJ and Bobby challenge Gamma House, competing with them at the college's X Games â events include cycling, skateboarding and rollerblading â which Gamma have always won.\n\nGoofy, distraught that he is no longer living with Max, accidentally destroys the factory he works in and is unable to get another job as he does not have a degree. He therefore enrols in the same university, much to his son's dismay, particularly as Goofy uses it as an excuse to relive the 1970s, arousing the affections of the college librarian. The more Goofy tries to get closer to Max, the more Max tries to get away, until Goofy decides to compete in the X Games representing Gamma House. Who will win, father or son?\n\nLength79 minutes SettingFictional town of SpoonervilleAnimation TypeCelInspirationGoof Troop (1992-3)Characters\n\nGoofy, Max's clumsy, well-meaning father (Bill Farmer)\n\nMaximillan 'Max' Goof, perpetually-embarrassed son (Jason Marsden)\n\nBradley Uppercrust III, head of Gamma Mu Mu House (Jeff Bennett)\n\nPete, Goofy's neighbour and PJ's father (Jim Cummings)\n\nBeret Girl, mysterious beatnik poet and PJ's love interest (Vicki Lewis)\n\nSylvia Marpole, university librarian and Goofy's love interest (Bebe Neuwirth)\n\nPJ, Pete's son and Max's best friend (Rob Paulsen)\n\nRobert 'Bobby' Zimuruski, Max and PJ's friend (Pauly Shore)\n\nTank, member of Gamma frat gang (Brad Garrett)\n\nSoundtrack\n\n'Future's So Bright Gotta Wear Shades' by Pat MacDonald\n\n'Don't Give Up' written by Steve Bartek\n\n'Nowhere to Run' by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland\n\n'Pressure Drop' by Frederick 'Toots' Hibbert\n\n'Shake Your Groove Thing' by Frederick J Perrin and Dino Fekaris\n\n'You Make Me Feel Like Dancing' by Leo Sayer and Vincent Poncia\n\n'Come On Get Happy' by Wes Farrell and Danny Janssen\n\n'Knock On Wood' by Eddie Floyd and Stephen Lee Cropper\n\n'Right Back Where We Started From' by Pierre Tubbs and J Vincent Edwards\n\nSpin Off Of\n\nA Goofy Movie (1995) â 5 years earlier\n\nBechdel TestFail\n\nA heartwarming tale of parental relationships, this is one of only two DisneyToon Studios sequels to be rated as better than the original film .\n\n14. The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea (2000)\n\nDirectorJim Kammerud ReleaseDirect-to-VideoPlotOn the birth of their daughter Melody, Prince Eric and Princess Ariel sail to introduce her to her grandfather King Triton, ruler of the city of Atlantica. Morgana, a sea-witch, threatens to harm Melody unless she is given Triton's trident, which contains all the power of the ocean. Though Morgana is defeated, Ariel decides to build a giant wall around her castle in order to stop Melody from going to sea. After her 12th birthday Melody, tired of being lied to, flees to the sea and meets the manipulating Morgana. Morgana promises to turn Melody into a mermaid if she agrees to steal Triton's trident. Who will triumph?Length72 minutesSettingUnnamed mediÃ¦val coastal kingdom and AtlanticaAnimation TypeCelInspirationThe Little Mermaid (1837) by Hans Christian AndersonCharacters\n\nAriel, former mermaid and mother (Jodi Benson)\n\nMelody, Ariel and Eric's 12-year-old daughter (Tara Charendoff)\n\nSebastian, a crab (Samuel E Wright)\n\nMorgana, octopoid sea-witch (Pat Carroll)\n\nPrince Eric, Ariel's husband (Rob Paulsen)\n\nKing Triton, Ariel's father (Kenneth Mars)\n\nFlounder, a fish (Cam Clarke)\n\nScuttle, a gull (Buddy Hackett)\n\nUndertow, Morgana's giant shark (Clancy Brown)\n\nTip, an emperor penguin (Max Casella)\n\nDash, a walrus (Stephen Furst)\n\nGrimsby, butler (Kay E Kuter)\n\nChef Louis (Rene Auberjonois)\n\nMusicComposed by Michael and Patty Silversher unless stated\n\n'Down to the Sea'\n\n'For a Moment'\n\n'Tip & Dash'\n\n'Here on the Land and Sea'\n\n'Part of Your World' by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman\n\nSpin Off Of\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989) â 11 years earlier\n\nBechdel TestPass\n\nWho would have thought that Ariel would turn out to be an overprotective parent who builds a wall to keep her daughter inside the castle (which already had walls) and then never talks to her? The whole plot of the film revolves around Ariel never mentioning to Melody that there's an evil sea-witch after her and instead she repeatedly denies the existence of mermaids to her daughter even though she used to be one. The characters deserve better than this plot.\n\nMost of the original cast return. Pat Carroll had previously voiced Ursula (Morgana's sister). However, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return to play Prince Eric and Jason Marin was replaced by Cam Clarke as Flounder. Ben Wright, the original Grimsby, had died in 1989 and this was the final film for Buddy Hackett who played Scuttle.\n\n15. Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure (2001)\n\nDirectorsDarrell Rooney with Jeannine RousselReleaseDirect-to-VideoPlotTired of oppressive rules, regulations and 4th of July celebrations, Lady and the Tramp's son Scamp wants his own independence to live a life of freedom. He meets a pack of junkyard dogs led by Buster, who set him a series of challenges that will lead to his acceptance into the pack. Also in the pack is Angel, a young female dog he develops feelings for who longs to have a home of her own. Will Lady and the Tramp find Scamp, is Buster the hero that he believes him to be and is freedom really romantic? Will Scamp get damp and/or deny his father three times before dawn? Will Lady have any impact, no matter how microscopic, on the plot whatsoever?Length66 minutesSettingJuly 1911, New EnglandAnimation TypeCelCharacters\n\nScamp, Lady and the Tramp's mutt son (Scott Wolf, Singing: Roger Bart)\n\nAngel, Pomeranian/Chihuahua street dog (Alyssa Milano, Singing: Susan Egan)\n\nBuster, King of the Junkyard mutt (Chazz Palminteri, Singing: Jess Harnell)\n\nTramp, mutt and Scamp's father, former street dog (Jeff Bennett)\n\nLady, Cocker Spaniel and Scamp's mother (Jodi Benson)\n\nMooch, street Old English Sheepdog (Bill Fagerbakke)\n\nSparky, Irish Wolfhound (Mickey Rooney)\n\nRuby, street Afghan Hound (Cathy Moriarty)\n\nFrancois, street Boston Terrier (Bronson Pinchot)\n\nAnnette, Danielle and Collette, Scamp's sisters (Debi Berryberry and Kath Soucie)\n\nJim Dear, Darling, Lady and Tramp's owners (Nick Jameson and Barbara Goodson)\n\nTony and Joe, staff at Tony's Restaurant (Jim Cummings and Michael Gough)\n\nMusicComposed by Melissa Manchester and Norman GimbelSpin Off Of\n\nLady and the Tramp (1955) â 46 years earlier\n\nBechdel TestFail\n\nThis was the first time that Disney MovieToons released a film that was a spin-off of a film from before the Disney Renaissance. Not a single character in Lady of the Tramp II was played by the original cast. Made in Los Angeles, USA and Sydney, Australia, the look of this film is directly inspired by the original, with the backgrounds flawlessly recreated. The attention to detail ensures that this is not a bad film; however, it remains a superfluous one.\n\n16. Return to Never Land (2002)\n\nDirectorRobin Budd ReleaseCinema PlotWendy has grown up and is married with two young children, but she always believed in Peter Pan. During the London Blitz Wendy's husband has been enlisted in the army and her children are to be evacuated. Seeing the world at war, Jane has stopped believing in magic. She is kidnapped by Captain Hook, who mistakes her for Wendy, and taken to Neverland. There she is rescued by Peter Pan but, longing to go home, agrees to help Hook recover his treasure, on the condition he does not hurt a hair on Pan's head, in exchange for being returned to London. After Jane tells Tinker Bell that she doesn't believe in fairies, Tinker Bell's light is fading. Will Tinker Bell die? Can Captain Hook wrap Jane around his little finger - erm, hook? Will Jane become the very first Lost Girl? Will Peter Pan tell Wendy's daughter, 'Me Peter Pan, You Jane'?

Tinker Bell is modelling a new, yellow look. The character of Tiger Lily, central to Peter Pan, has been removed as the first film's stereotypical 'Indian' characters are now considered offensive.\n\nThe geography of London seems very distorted, with Tower Bridge and the Houses of Parliament next to each other. Similarly numerous historical mistakes are made in the opening scene set during the Blitz. Within the same day in the film we learn that Jane and her brother are to be evacuated (evacuations took place in September 1939 and September 1940) because of the London Blitz (which began in September 1940), yet the blackout is not in effect (blackouts were enforced in September 1939) and their father Edward drives a US-style truck (the first US troops arrived in Britain in January 1942).\n\nThough a fairly forgettable sequel, the film was the fourth most successful animated film of the year, behind only Blue Sky's Ice Age, Disney's Lilo & Stitch and DreamWorks Animation's Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. Costing only $20 million, it made more than Disney's Treasure Planet, which was made for $140 million.\n\n17.

Although the film is titled Dreams Come True, it is hard to see how the title actually applies. The person whose wish is granted is Jaq, who quickly regrets it. The potential romance between Anastasia and the Baker is left open-ended. With the exception of any fans of Cinderella who have spent 52 years wondering whether Cinderella prefers prunes or chocolate cake it is hard to see how this release can be anyone's dream come true. It was surprisingly successful but does not add anything to the story of Cinderella. None of the original film's cast reprise their roles.\n\n18. The Hunchback of Notre Dame II: The Secret of the Bell (2002)\n\nDirectorBradley Raymond ReleaseDirect-to-VideoPlotSix years after the events of the first film, Esmeralda and Captain Phoebus have a six-year-old son, Zephyr, who is Quasimodo's best friend. In the days leading up to Le Jour d'Amour, the Festival of Love, Sarousch's circus arrives in Paris. This coincides with a string of thefts. Sarousch dreams of stealing the biggest bell in Notre Dame, La FidÃ¨le, as it is made of gold and encrusted with giant jewels. He forces his reluctant assistant Madellaine to befriend Quasimodo, the bell ringer, and gain information from him. Yet once Madellaine looks beyond Quasimodo's appearance she discovers that there is more to him than at first appears. Will Madellaine betray Quasimodo and will Sarousch steal the bell or do the fandango?Length63 minutesSetting15th Century ParisAnimation TypeCelInspirationNotre-Dame de Paris, better known as The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo (1831) Characters\n\nQuasimodo, hunchbacked bell ringer (Tom Hulce)\n\nMadellaine, thief and circus assistant (Jennifer Love Hewitt)\n\nEsmeralda, gypsy married to Captain Phoebus (Demi Moore)\n\nSarousch, vain circus troupe leader and thief (Michael McKean)\n\nZephyr, Esmeralda and Phoebus' son (Haley Joel Osment)\n\nCaptain Phoebus, Captain of the Guard (Kevin Kline)\n\nClopin, leader of the Gypsies (Paul Kandel)\n\nVictor, a gargoyle (Charles Kimbrough)\n\nHugo, a gargoyle (Jason Alexander)\n\nLaverne, a gargoyle (Jane Withers)\n\nAchilles, Captain Phoebus' horse\n\nDjali, Esmeralda's goat\n\nMusicBy Walter Edgar Kennon unless stated:\n\n'Le Jour D'Amour' by Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn\n\n'An Ordinary Miracle\n\n'I'd Stick With You'\n\n'Fa-la-la-la Fallen In Love'\n\n'I'm Gonna Love You (Madellaine's Love Song)' - by Jennifer Love Hewitt and Chris Canute\n\nSpin Off Of\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) â 6 years earlier\n\nBechdel TestFail\n\nMade six years after The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the difference in the quality of animation is apparent as this film cannot match the original's dynamism. The story, in which Quasimodo finds a love interest, both rectifies and detracts from the original film's ending. Work on making the film began in 1999 but it took five years for it to be released. Almost the entire original cast returns for this film - Mary Wickes had died in 1995 while making the first film and Jane Withers finished her last lines uncredited. Here Jane Withers was fully credited as Laverne.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt was disappointed that her character, Madellaine, did not have a song when she was offered the role, especially as she was trying to launch a singing career. She therefore wrote a song for her character to sing, which made it into the film.\n\n19.

In fact the plot has much more in common with Disney film Bolt (2008), which is about a dog television star called Bolt in the real world who has adventures similar to this film's dog television star Thunderbolt and his adventures in the real world.\n\nITV, the UK's first commercial television station, launched in London in 1955. However, on launch, advertising and particularly sponsorship was strongly regulated. The US-style Thunderbolt's Adventure Hour is Sponsored by 'Kanine Krunchies' would not have been permitted under the 1954 Television Act as it would have broken the Independent Television Authority's regulations ensuring adverts and programme content were clearly separate.\n\n21.

His autobiography completely ignores the many years he spent being raised with the wolves and instead Mowgli only seems to remember the couple of days he spent with Baloo. Inexplicably Baloo's fur has all turned blue and animals seen in India now include African hippopotami and American ocelots.\n\nPopular film character King Louie did not appear in Kipling's novel but was created for The Jungle Book. In the 1960s Walt Disney had originally hoped that Louis Armstrong would play the role, just as he had hoped the Beatles would play the vultures. However, when it was realised that having a black man playing an ape might be interpreted as racial stereotyping, Louis Prima was cast instead. Prima died in 1978. In 1999, his widow Gia sued Disney for lack of royalties following the home media release of The Jungle Book and the use of the character in television series TaleSpin (1990), claiming that Jim Cummings was impersonating her husband's voice without permission. Disney settled out of court in 2001 and agreed not to use impersonations of Louis Prima's voice, which is why King Louie does not appear in The Jungle Book 2.\n\nThe Jungle Book 2 was the third most successful animated film of the year, behind only Pixar's Finding Nemo and Disney's Brother Bear.\n\n22. Piglet's BIG Movie (2003)\n\nDirectorFrancis Glebas ReleaseCinema PlotPiglet feels unappreciated when his friends say he is too small to help and goes for a walk by himself.

Unusually there isn't a narrator. Piglet's BIG Movie was the third Winnie-the-Pooh film released in cinemas following The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and The Tigger Movie, but the weakest to date. It nevertheless was the sixth most successful animated film of the year, behind Finding Nemo, Brother Bear, The Jungle Book 2, DreamWorks Animations' Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas and Warner Bros' Looney Tunes: Back in Action.\n\n23. Atlantis: Milo's Return (2003)\n\nDirectorsVictor Cook, Toby Shelton & Tad Stones ReleaseDirect-to-VideoPlotQueen Kida of Atlantis is using the crystal known as the Heart of Atlantis to restore the city to its former glory, but worries whether this is the right path. She and her husband Milo learn that Atlantean creatures and technology may be rampaging around the Earth and they reunite with Milo's former companions including Whitmore, Audrey, Vinny and Mole to investigate various monsters worldwide. These include the Kraken, dust coyotes, Ice Giants and Lava Creatures. Would these monsters have got away with it if it wasn't for the meddling kids?

When that film flopped, the spin-off series was cancelled, but three episodes had been finished. These episodes were combined and released as a direct-to-video sequel with new bookending and linking material. This just about works, although there is no denying that the whole is episodic in nature as the crew face three monsters in three different locations, suddenly switching from Atlantis to Norway to a desert in America's Southwest and then to Iceland. Michael J Fox was replaced by James Arnold Taylor as Milo and, as Jim Varney had died, Cookie was played by Steven Barr although he only appears in the middle instalment.\n\nThe Future\n\nIn 2003 Disney MovieToons transferred from being a division of Walt Disney Television Animation to become a division of Walt Disney Features under the name DisneyToon Studios. Though the standard of some of their output had been below what would be expected of anything associated with the Disney name, the studio now had a chance to develop its own identity, still led by Executive Vice President Sharon Morrill."
