        "text": "This research explores American art songs of the 21 st century. The paper provides a listing of 54 composers based in the United States and the art songs they composed from 2000 to 2023 which are available either through publishers or the composers' websites. The research is divided into three categories: art songs with piano, chamber works with voice, and works for solo voice and large ensemble. The paper also includes biographies of each composer. This research provides singers, voice teachers, and collaborative pianists a useful resource to gain familiarity with the American art-song repertoire of the current century.\n\nThis article calls attention to a database devoted to women composers and songwriters and points to a few of the historical issues that this database makes it possible to investigate. The focus is women who composed songs between roughly 1890 and 1930, and who published in the United States, Great Britain, and the British Commonwealth. When this article was written, the database contained more than 15,500 entries of songs and song publications by 1,607 women who wrote in all styles (including classical, popular, and a range of styles in between). It documents the extraordinary rise and decline of women song composers that occurred in the years before and after the First World War, to identify the leading composers and the most popular poets, and to discuss differences in the careers of American and British women songwriters. The thirty women with the best representation have at least eighty songs or song collections. At the top of the list are Liza Lehmann, Lily Strickland, Maude Valerie White, and Carrie Jacobs Bond. Winner of the 2014 Richard S. Hill Award, awarded by the Music Library Association for outstanding article on librarianship or article of a music-bibliographic nature.\n\nIt is apparent even to the casual observer that more women participate in American choral singing than men. Choirs at all levels struggle to recruit enough men to balance the legions of singing women. For this reason, American treble choirs are abundant. Yet, women may still feel marginalized in the choral world. Much work remains to resolve issues of opportunity for female conductors, visibility for female composers, equity for female academics, and access to quality treble repertoire. In response to the last challenge, this issue of the Research Memorandum Series highlights repertoire written for this underserved group. Dr. Jennifer Flory and Meagan W. Johnson present literature for treble choirs written by American composers in the last 30 years.\n\nEVALUATING APPROPRIATE REPERTOIRE FOR DEVELOPING SINGERS: AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN ART SONG ANTHOLOGY Finding appropriate and unique repertoire for the developing singer is a daunting task and ongoing challenge in the teaching profession. There are limited resources to help guide teachers in selecting varied, yet suitable repertoire that falls outside of the standard Western European musical canon. The early years, ages 17–21, are crucial to establishing a healthy and well-rounded vocal approach to singing, while also introducing the student to a wide variety of music. African-American art song is a great option for developing singers. Repertoire should allow a student to grow musically, vocally, and artistically according to the singer’s specific stage of learning and interests. Selecting repertoire through established criteria that considers the student’s personal and cultural interests (in addition to pedagogical needs) allows for a good foundation to support a healthy vocal developme...\n\nTHE AMERICAN ART SONG CANON continues to reidentify and rearticulate its borders and boundaries, and this organic process underscores the importance of including the works of a wide array of composers, including African American women. As scholar Helen Walker-Hill notes in her book, From Spirituals to Symphonies: African-American Women Composers and their Music, the first published songs by African American women appeared in 1870, but over a century later these works are woefully underrepresented in the repertoire. It is our hope that this brief introduction to some of the composers of this literature, spanning a broad spectrum from Florence Price to Nkeiru Okoye, will inspire inclusion of these songs into voice studios and performances. This rich oeuvre of music by African American women song composers is best contextualized within the complex social as well as musical experiences of African Americans. Africans were forcibly brought to this country under the institution of legalize..."
