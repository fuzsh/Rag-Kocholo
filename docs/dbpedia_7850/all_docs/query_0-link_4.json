        "text": "Richard Gibbs, composer and lyricist was born in Dayton, Ohio and raised in Florida. After graduating from Berklee College of Music in Boston, he moved to California to work as a keyboardist, collaborating with several popular artists during the 1970's and early 1980's, including Oingo Boingo (1980-84). Gibbs shifted to work in the film industry, first as an orchestrator and arranger for Danny Elfman, then on his own projects by the early 1990's. He scored the first season of THE SIMPSONS, which launched his successful career as a comedy composer. Some of his top box office movies include: DOCTOR DOLITTLE, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, 28 DAYS, BIG MAMA'S HOUSE, BARBERSHOP 2:BACK IN BUSINESS, and JOHNSON FAMILY VACATION. Gibbs wrote the score for 101 DALMATIANS II: PATCH'S LONDON ADVENTURE (2003)."
