She\n\nleaves her clothes on and lays her heart bare in this warm telling of her\n\nunsettling partnership with her own powerful, eloquent, recalcitrant body.\n\nFinding unexpected revelations in an airplane potty, a New Orleans nightclub,\n\nand in a spacious room at SF General – sipping coconut water – Kellita begs the\n\nquestion of her audience: in what ways do we force ourselves to digest the\n\nindigestible? And what happens when we\n\nstop? With two decades of international burlesque performance under her shimmy\n\nbelt, this is Kellita’s first full-length autobiographical-storytelling show.\n\n“I K(noW” focuses on mental, emotional and physical health in a way that’s not\n\njust a storytelling device but also an interactive learning platform.\n\n* “I K(no)W” is not a burlesque show *\n\nWhat genre is it?\n\nThink intimate-chat-with-a-friend meets TED Talk meets\n\nsecure attachment and autoimmume recovery lab.\n\nWhat they’re saying about “I K(no)W” in San\n\nFrancisco: “There are shows that are engaging or entertaining. There are\n\nshows that you talk about right after you see them but don’t ever think about\n\nagain. And then there are shows that start you thinking of everyone you can\n\nsend to see the show. Kellita engaged my heart, soul, gut and brain.

She is a founding and board member of the St. Louis Theater Circle.\n\nShe is retired from teaching journalism/media as an adjunct college instructor.\n\nBy Lynn Venhaus\n\nManaging Editor\n\n“Grease” may be the word, but I have one for the Stages St. Louis production:\n\nVivacious!\n\nThis funny and nostalgia look at 1950s teenagers and the\n\ndecade’s burgeoning rock and roll culture bursts with ebullient performers who\n\ndeliver the beloved songs with panache.\n\nThose songs never get old. “Summer Nights,” “We Go\n\nTogether,” “Greased Lightning,” “Born to Hand Jive” and “You’re the One That I\n\nWant” are among the catchy show tunes in the style of Buddy Holly, Little\n\nRichard and Elvis Presley that entice sing-a-longs. (And eager audiences are\n\nready).\n\nIntegrated with the snazzy dance numbers choreographed by Tony Gonzalez, and\n\ncostumes to match, they capture the look and sound of a bygone era — but also\n\na universal feeling.\n\nAnd certainly not that we were all the cool kids. Far from\n\nit.\n\nBy now, the worldwide smash hit is as familiar as your\n\nsenior year in high school. So why do people return over and over to watch high\n\nschool shenanigans?\n\nPhoto by ProPhotoSTL“Alone at the Drive-In Movie,” “Beauty School Dropout,” “Those\n\nMagic Feelings” and “It’s Raining on Prom Night” touch on all the fretting that\n\ncomes with being a teen, no matter what generation.\n\nMaybe it’s that sense of trying to fit in, to belong. That\n\nunderneath that tough T-Birds exterior are guys desperate to figure it out —\n\nmasking those insecurities (on display so well in James Dean’s “Rebel Without a\n\nCause”). And the Pink Ladies really wanting to be Gidget, but not letting on\n\nthey are afraid they don’t measure up.\n\nOn the surface, it is all fun times, that sweet flush of\n\nyouth during a more innocent time – but dealing with grown-up issues AND\n\nhormones.\n\n“Greaser” Danny Zuko (Sam Harvey) fancies “good girl” Sandy Dumbrowski (Summerisa Bell Stevens) one summer, and lo and behold, she transfers to his public high school, not the Catholic one. Whoa. Kind Frenchy (Lucy Moon) invites Sandy to hang out with the Pink Ladies, but rough-and-tough Rizzo (Morgan Cowling) is not nice to the new girl. Rizzo has her own issues with boyfriend Kenickie (Jesse Corbin), but school isn’t a high priority with anyone except Patty Simcox (Aisling Halpin) and nerd Eugene (Brad Frenette). “Grease” is a cultural phenomenon nearly 50 years old — and has been revised multiple times, with the most significant changes made in the 1978 movie, then adopted for a 1993 London stage version, which incorporated four chart-topping songs from the movie written by Barry Alan Gibb, John Farrar, Louis St. Louis and Scott Simon. This is the version Stages has the rights to, and it makes a difference.\n\nYou would not much recognize the original 1971 stage version,\n\nwhich has been sanitized from Jim Jacobs’ and Warren Casey’s initial effort\n\nabout working-class high schoolers in a Polish part of Chicago, based on\n\nJacobs’ alma mater in Cicero.\n\nPhoto by ProPhotoSTLThe duck-tailed, hot-rodding Class of 1959 of Rydell High\n\nresembled those ruffians, and the gum-snapping and hip-shaking Pink Ladies were\n\na combination of bad and mean girls. The raunchier version has been toned down,\n\nbut there are still the themes of peer pressure, teen pregnancy, gangs, class\n\nconflict, and good old garden-variety teen rebellion.\n\nThis cast, with a few who have been out of high school for some time, seem to\n\ngel well. They sure can shake, rattle and roll in their musical numbers, and\n\nexaggerate their characters for comic effect. Their school and home scenes,\n\nunder Michael Hamilton’s smooth direction, delve deeper into social\n\ninteraction, with different conversations and motives at play.\n\nWhile it’s obvious the cast is older, “Grease” isn’t a\n\nproduction that hinges on authenticity. Just go with the fantasy.\n\n(After all, back in my day, most of these people would have\n\nbeen considered juvenile delinquents, not people to emulate. And changing into\n\na sexy siren to get a guy? Oh dear. When would that fly today?)\n\n“Grease” did not become a massive hit because everyone’s enamored with\n\nhooligans. The modest musical parodying the 1950s had an eight-year run on\n\nBroadway and two popular revivals in 1994 and 2007, plus the movie is the no. 1\n\nmovie musical of all-time, not to mention all the productions in schools,\n\nregional and community theater.\n\nPeople can identify with awkward adolescence and ‘types’ – if you don’t\n\nrecognize yourself, you know others who do. The supporting cast is appealing,\n\nparticularly Patrick Mobley as shy Doody, eager to be a chick magnet with his\n\nguitar, and merry Brooke Shapiro as Jan, desperate to have a beau.\n\nPhoto by ProPhotoSTL\n\nMoon is terrific as Frenchy, and “Beauty School Dropout” is\n\none of this show’s highlights, in staging, choreography and costumes. Showing\n\noff her powerful pipes, Kendra Lynn Lucas is a showstopper as the Teen Angel.\n\nShe also doubles as Miss Lynch, but in a rather confusing development is flirty\n\nwith students.\n\nSteve Isom evokes those early rock ‘n roll disc jockeys in\n\nhis on-air patter and hosting dance contest duties as Vince Fontaine.\n\nJulia Johanos is admirable as a stylish Marty, who acts worldly\n\nolder on purpose, while Collin O’Connor is amusing as Roger of ‘Mooning” fame.\n\nFrankie Thams tries to be a rowdy Sonny.\n\nSummerisa Bell Stevens is a radiant Sandy, and after\n\nimpressive turns as Sophie in “Mamma Mia” and Doralee in “9 to 5,” she\n\ndemonstrates her vocal talents once again. She is at her best with “Hopelessly\n\nDevoted to You.”\n\nI didn’t feel the pairings of Danny and Sandy and of Kenickie and Rizzo were\n\nall that convincing, but their singing and dancing skills were dandy. Harvey\n\ndid a nice job with the ballad “Sandy,” and as much as Rizzo’s mean-spirited\n\n“Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee” annoys me, her “There Are Worse Things I Can Do”\n\nwas fine.\n\nThe rest of the energetic ensemble includes Bryan Purvis as Peggy-Sue, Madison Tinder as Doreen, Matthew Weidenbener as Frankie, Erik Keiser as Junior, Zach Trimmer as Johnny Casino and Tiger Brown as that fleet-footed Cha-Cha Di Gregorio. Lisa Campbell Albert did her usual stellar job as musical director, with orchestral arrangements by Stuart M. Elmore.\n\nThe cast certainly looks the part in their stunning vintage\n\noutfits, tailored to perfection by resident costume designer Brad Musgrove and\n\nhis crew. His choice of fabrics is spot-on and he has created looks that could\n\nbe straight out of the movies “Pillow Talk” and “A Summer Place,” or McCall’s\n\nmagazine, complete with bobby sox and saddle shoes.\n\nScenic Designer James Wolk makes interesting use of the\n\nspace with two staircases so that transitions are smooth, and he has built a\n\ncar – a red convertible that serves its purpose. He had me at hi-fi and 45s. Sean\n\nM. Savoie’s lighting design enhances it beautifully.\n\nThis “Grease” does what it’s supposed to do – present a time, a place and a feeling, and as a bonus, has the groove and meaning audiences want.\n\nStages St. Louis presents “Grease” through Aug. 18.
