DETAILED PLOT The Radcliffe family and their 101 Dalmatians are preparing to move to their \"Dalmatian Plantation\", a home in the countryside with plenty of room for all of them. However, Patch, one of the puppies, feels ignored and wishes to be unique like his television hero, Thunderbolt. While watching The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show. He is accidentally left behind when his family leaves for the plantation, so he decides to head for the audition to meet his hero and win a guest spot on the show, but fails to impress the producers. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt's \"trusty\" sidekick, Lil' Lightning, tells Thunderbolt the producers want to replace him with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A veritable reference book to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for the television star in his attempts at real-life heroics. Elsewhere in London, Cruella de Vil attempts to soothe her fixation on spots with the help of Lars, a French beatnik artist. In order to inspire him, she restarts her hunt for the Dalmatians, using a newspaper picture of Patch to find their new address. Patch's family finally becomes aware that he is missing and go back to London to find him. Cruella bails her former henchmen, Jasper and Horace, out of prison. She sends them in a stolen dog food truck to steal the remaining puppies. They succeed after dealing with Nanny, and they take them to Lars. When Cruella requests she be made a masterpiece from their fur, Lars angrily refuses, not wanting them to be harmed. Angered, she has him bound and gagged and returns to her original plan of making a Dalmatian fur coat. The imprisoned puppies use the Twilight Bark to send a distress signal, which is picked up by Patch and Thunderbolt, and they set out to save Patch's family. Lightning is horrified when he discovers Thunderbolt might actually become a hero and hurries to the warehouse where the puppies are being held. He convinces Thunderbolt not to use Patch's stealth plan, but to openly attack. Cruella appears, knocks Thunderbolt out, and locks Patch and Thunderbolt in a cage. Lightning sneaks in and reveals to Patch that Thunderbolt is a fraud. Patch is deeply hurt that Thunderbolt would lie, but soon realizes that their current situation was covered in one of The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour episodes, and manages to escape. Patch releases his family, but Thunderbolt stays in his open cage. Patch manages to trick Cruella, Jasper, and Horace into going downstairs, while the puppies escape through the building's roof. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt escapes from his cage and frees Lars. The puppies board a double-decker bus, but Cruella, Jasper, and Horace discover the escape and pursue them in their stolen truck, racing through the streets of London, and crashing through the filming of Lil' Lightning's new show. Cruella, Jasper and Horace finally corner the puppies in an alley. Patch tries to hold them off while the others escape, but they are undaunted. Luckily, Thunderbolt arrives, having been driven to the scene by Lars, and fakes a heart attack, distracting Cruella and causing her to knock out Jasper and Horace and incapacitate herself. Patch puts the bus into reverse, sending Cruella, Jasper, Horace, and Lil' Lightning scrambling into the River Thames, along with their stolen truck. Patch and Thunderbolt survey the scene, both letting out deep, heroic barks. The police arrest Lil' Lightning, Jasper, and Horace, while Cruella, now driven completely insane, is sent to a mental institution. Pongo, Perdita, The Radcliffes, and Nanny arrive, and Patch's parents tell him they are proud of him. Thunderbolt dismisses himself as just an actor, but says that Patch is \"a real, one of a kind wonder-dog\".\n\nCondition: Very good\n\nCase Type: Tall/DVD Case\n\nRating: G\n\nSubtitle Language: English & French\n\nCustom Bundle: No\n\nMPN: Multi Region Player Required To Play Outside Aust & NZ\n\nStudio: Walt Disney Studios\n\nRegion Code: DVD: 4 (AU, NZ, Latin America...)\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nLanguage: English & French\n\nRelease Year: 2003\n\nActor: Bobby Lockwood Barry Bostwick Samuel West Kath Soucie, Jason Alexander Martin Short, Jeff Bennett Maurice LaMarche\n\nFeatures: Lost To London Game, Making Of “Dogumentary”, Thunderbolt’s Dressing Room\n\nMovie/TV Title: 101 Dalmatians 02\n\nSeason: 02 - Patch’s London Adventure\n\nMusic Artist: Richard Gibbs\n\nVideo Format: PAL\n\nDirector: Jim Kammerud, Brian Smith\n\nSub-Genre: Fantasy\n\nCinematic Movement: Arthouse/Independent\n\nFranchise: 101 Dalmations\n\nEdition: Widescreen & Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\n\nType: Movie\n\nProducer: Unknown\n\nGenre: Adventure, Children's & Family, Comedy\n\nRun Time: 71 Minutes\n\nCountry/Region of Manufacture: Australia\n\nUPC: 9398520982038\n\nMore Like This PicClick Exclusive"
