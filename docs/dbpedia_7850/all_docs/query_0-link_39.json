        "text": "In the animated movie 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure released in 2002, we follow the story of Patch, one of the smallest and most adventurous puppies of the original 101 dalmatians. The movie begins with Patch feeling left out amid the arrival of Thunderbolt, a fictional dog superhero, in the canine world. Patch feels like he is the only one who doesn't have a talent or skill that sets him apart from the rest of his siblings.\n\nFeeling dejected and unimportant, Patch wanders off into the streets of London to pursue his dreams of becoming unique and famous. Along the way, he meets the notorious Cruella de Vil, who has just been released from prison and is ready to resume her plan of stealing puppies to make a new fur coat.\n\nDetermined to become a hero and save his fellow dalmatian puppies from Cruella's evil plan, Patch joins forces with Thunderbolt and two other pups, named Wizzer and Dipstick, who have also been living in the shadow of Thunderbolt's fame. Together, they embark on an exciting adventure across London to stop Cruella's evil plan and save the day.\n\nThroughout their escapades, Patch learns valuable lessons about friendship, teamwork, and the true meaning of being a hero. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt struggles with his inflated ego and obsession with fame, eventually learning to appreciate the value of true friendship and loyalty.\n\nThe movie features a star-studded voice cast, including Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, Jason Alexander as Wizzer, Martin Short as Lars, and Bobby Lockwood as Patch. It also brings back some of the beloved characters from the original 101 Dalmatians, including Pongo, Perdita, and Roger and Anita.\n\nThe animation style is inspired by the classic Disney style, featuring fluid movements and expressive character designs. The music score, composed by Richard Gibbs, is full of catchy tunes that perfectly accompany the upbeat and lighthearted tone of the movie.\n\nOverall, 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure is a charming and entertaining movie that will delight both children and adults alike. It's a heartwarming tale of friendship, bravery, and self-discovery that encourages viewers to embrace their uniqueness and believe in their abilities.\n\n101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure is a 2003 animated movie with a runtime of 1 hour and 10 minutes. It has received moderate reviews from critics and viewers, who have given it an IMDb score of 5.8."
