Parents need to know that 101 Dalmatians: Patch's London Adventure is a 2003 animated sequel in which Patch teams up with a TV star dog to stop Cruella from turning the dogs into abstract art. Expect a fair amount of cartoon violence and pratfalls, particularly in scenes in which the dogs watch a black-and-white TV show starring a heroic dog named Thunderbolt, who gets whipped by the villain on top of a moving train before tying up the whip around the villain's legs, causing him to fall inside of a train car with an angry bull. Outside of the TV show, Cruella is up to her old tricks, is shown knocking out a dog with a paint can, knocks her henchmen out with a tire iron, throws knives at a pretentious artist before leaving him tied to one of his canvases. Anita and Roger's maid hits the villains with a frying pan, before they retaliate by lowering her into a well and leaving her there. Cruella talks of ways in which the dalmatians might be killed (drowning, etc.), before suggesting that their fur be converted into artwork. Vehicle chase involving an out-of-control double-decker bus. Doggie delivery truck carjacked by the villains, who dress as women as a way to fool the driver. Dogs lured into the back of the doggie treat truck. Cruella always shown with a smoking cigarette in a holder. Brief shots of attendees of an art gallery opening holding cocktails.
