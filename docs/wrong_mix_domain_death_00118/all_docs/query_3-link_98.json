        "text": "Honored to share the importance of Goal Setting and Creating the Pathway to Success with my colleagues and peers at Global Summit in Nashville. Do you lean into your internal and external team? Do you maximize all the relationships you created in your life? The opportunities to serve others is endless as long as you are open minded. Elevate your life, Elevate others around you. Live the life you were meant to live, not only for you, but for your family, your team, your friends, and everyone you meet. #goalsetting #goals2023 #teambuilding #leadershipcoaching #leadershipdevelopment #serveothers\n\nHonored to have #ConversationsWithConnors featured in #podcastMagazine. https://lnkd.in/e4sUKQbF They say it takes a village. I say it takes your #networks And for that, there are just too many people to thank and pay homage too. 1st and foremost, Lori Lyons I appreciate you reaching out and providing the opportunity to be featured. Itâ€™s an honor and I think you did a wonderful piece. Not to mention, Iâ€™m a fan of #podcast magazine. How about my AMAZING guests.... I just happen to be the fortunate bloc that got to spend time with you all. I would be remiss to not give credit to so many of our supporters and loyal listeners. I appreciate you! #networkingWorks NetWorkWise #networking\n\nYou don't need to watch this if you are .01% of the planet. The irony is the .01% do this all the time and often identify it as one of the most important keys to their success. I'm talking about #networking and building real relationships that benefit others. The true irony is how it's you that is the ultimate beneficiary of rich relationships. PLEASE TAG someone that you know that does an excellent job of taking a proactive approach with their relationships and represents what it means to NetWorkWise #dontjustnetworknetworkwise #networkingWorks\n\nTOMORROW! We release our podcast interview with 1986 World Series Champion with the New York Mets Wally Backman! He is now the manager with Long Island Ducks Baseball. The episode is quite 'Amazin' Be sure to subscribe to our podcast so you don't miss this or future episodes. https://apple.co/2vhQf6p This episode will be available on 6/19. Adam R. Connors ðŸŽ™"
