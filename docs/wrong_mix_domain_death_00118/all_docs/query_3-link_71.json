        "text": "28 Jonathan Swift : Gulliver’s Travels\n\nMs.Renu Anna Boban\n\nThough Swift had written pamphlets in support of the Whig party, he fell into conflict with the party and changed his allegiance to the Tory party in 1710. He attacked the Whigs in the Examiner (a Tory periodical founded by Viscount Bolingbroke) and in a series of pamphlets. To this period belongs the Journal to Stella. It gives us glimpses of the inner Swift who was vain, arrogant, ambitious, crafty but none the less a generous and considerate friend and a loyal ally. When the Tory government fell from power in 1714, Swift’s writings lost popularity and he went to Dublin, where he became Dean of St Patrick’s. There he devoted much energy to Irish affairs and in the course of time attained extraordinary popularity. His Drapier’s Letters (1724) made him famous in Ireland. In 1726 Swift published Travels Into Several Remote Nations Of The World, which later became known as Gulliver’s Travels. It was so controversial that it was not published in a full, uncensored version until ten years later. Alexander Pope’s observation on the reception of Gulliver’s Travels was: “It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery,” and it is widely believed that it has never been out of print since then. The British author George Orwell declared it to be among the six indispensable books in world literature. Swift took up the cause of the impoverishment of Ireland by England, and wrote pamphlets such as the satire A Modest Proposal (1729), in which he suggests that the problems of famine and overpopulation in Ireland could be solved by selling the babies of poor Irish people as food for the rich.\n\nSwift’s friends remarked that he grew increasingly bitter with age. He suffered from congenital deformity and abnormality in the brain and became insane in the end. Swift died in Dublin on October 19, 1745. He wrote his own obituary, “Lines on the Death of Dr Swift,” which contained the following lines: “He gave the little wealth he had / To build a house for fools and mad, / And showed by one satiric touch / No nation needed it so much.”\n\nGulliver’s Travels is essentially a satire on human follies. Satire is a genre in which human or individual vices are exposed by means of ridicule, derision, burlesque, irony, or other methods, with the intention of bringing about improvement. It is usually witty, and often very funny. However, its purpose is not to make readers laugh but to criticise an event, an individual or a group in a clever manner. John. M. Bullitt in Jonathan Swift and the Anatomy of Satire (1966) says that, “In its most serious function, satire is a mediator between two perceptions-the unillusioned perception of man as he actually is, and the ideal perception, or vision, of man as he ought to be,”. According to J. A. Downie(Jonathan Swift: Political Writer, 1984), while in the first and second voyages the focus of the criticism is on the English society and man within this society, the third and fourth voyages deal with human nature itself. However, all these ideas overlap as the journey progresses. Much of the Lilliputian adventure is focused on the king’s court and courtly favours. The fickle-mindedness of the king comes out in the scene where Gulliver refuses to help him in his thirst for power. The courtiers are willing to jump over a rope to attain royal favours. The two political parties are differentiated on the basis of the heels of the shoes. This shows how little the difference between the Whigs and the Tories was. The Christian religious differences about whether the host was actually transubstantiated and became flesh or was a symbol is reduced to the petty quarrel between the Big- Endians and the Small-Endians. Though Lilliput has a set standard like any other country, Swift likens them to humans when they do not live up to their standards by exhibiting ingratitude for Gulliver’s help and accuse him of high treason. This incident provides the most bitter satiric attack on hypocrisy, ingratitude and cruelty. In the Brobdingnagian voyage, human pride in physical appearance is attacked through Gulliver’s perspective of the Brobdingnagians. The narrator’s own pride in himself and his country is reduced to ashes. Gulliver’s offer of gunpowder underlines the fact that he is a typical member of his race. He cannot understand the Brobdingnagian king’s refusal to accept his offer which will help him in overcoming his enemies. Here Swift alludes to the eagerness with which European nations would leap at such an offer as an aid to waging war against their neighbors.\n\nRicardo Quintana in his work The Mind and Art of Jonathan Swift (1965) mentions that the satire in the third voyage attacks both the deficiency of common sense and the consequences of corrupt judgment. The Laputan voyage mainly focuses on the criticism of intellectuals such as scholars, scientists, philosophers et al who are so caught up in theories and theoretical knowledge that they forget the practical side of life. The misuse of reason is elaborately described in the chapters referring to the experiments conducted at the Grand Academy of Lagado. The subject of immortality is brought out through the case of the Struldbrugs. According to Swift to live in perpetuity is equal to a living death. He affirms that superior reason and pride will not protect humans from the natural laws of physical death. Swift points to the fact that reason is not enough and immortality will only make things worse. The final voyage to the Houyhnhnms seems to argue that it is only properly developed reason that can uplift humans to their true potential. Ironically, it is the horse-like Houyhnhnms who possess this rather than the human Yahoos. Thus in the last voyage, “Swift is attacking the Yahoo in each of us”, says Ernest Tuveson in the edited work Swift: A Collection of Critical Essays (1964). This voyage also takes a dig at war, lawyers, money and most important of all – Imperialism. Swift implies that the real goal of imperialism is greed and not the upliftment of the less fortunate races and peoples. Thus by using the medium of satire, Swift wants the readers to be shocked out of their pride at being the so-called superior race.\n\nThe Brobdingnagians represent the goodness in mankind. They are big not just physically but also morally, large-hearted in spirit and soul. Vice has not yet spread to their government system. The Brobdingnagian King is shocked by Gulliver’s account of English politics and society and calls them ‘the most pernicious Race of little odious vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the Earth’. He refuses Gulliver’s offer of gunpowder as he cannot see any good coming out of it. Though the Brobdingnagians treat Gulliver kindly, yet they see him as an exhibit. This points to the relative and unreliable nature of power. William. A. Eddy in Gulliver’s Travels: A Critical Study (1963) says about this power equation, “The effect of reducing the scale of life in Lilliput is to strip human affairs of their self-imposed grandeur. Rank, politics, international war, lose all of their significance. This particular idea is continued in the second voyage, not in the picture of the Brobdingnagians, but in Gulliver himself, who is now a Lilliputian.” Thus the powerful Gulliver of Lilliput is powerless in Brobdingnag. Probably this was a warning of Swift to the English of his time that the arrival of a larger or more powerful country’s force could easily put an end to their dominance on the world stage.\n\nThe Laputans, engrossed only in mathematics and music, pay no attention to practical matters. The only result of their expertise in astronomy is their great fear of cosmic accidents. Their inattentiveness to their environment makes them incapable of normal conversation. Hence they require servants with “flappers” who strike their ears and mouth to alert them to listen or speak. The Laputan King lives on the floating island and does not care at all about what is happening in the country below. The Academy Professors of Balnibarbi plan reforms without considering their effects in the real world. The model for these professors are the scientists of the Royal Society of London for the Improving of Natural Knowledge as many of the experiments Swift mentions were either carried out or proposed by these scientists. Lord Munodi is the traditionalist who is against the unreliable theories of the Academy. Hence he has a fine, strong house and his estate and tenants are flourishing as opposed to the others who had followed the Academy’s reforms. The Struldbrugs are an immortal race of humans who age without dying, thus they instruct humans regarding the undesirability of immortality.\n\nAccording to J. A. Downie (1984), the Laputan society is an example of Swift’s point that an excess of speculative reasoning can also be negative by cutting one off from the practical realities of life which, in the end, doesn’t serve learning or society. Lord Munodi’s common sense and practicality makes him an ideal character for a ruler. But the Laputans view him as hopelessly backward and unfit to take care of his own property. The qualities possessed by the Houyhnhnms which give them the power to rule over the Yahoos can be seen in a different light when one thinks about the debate in the council over the very existence of the Yahoos.\n\nPride forms another important theme in the novel.According to John. M. Bullitt (1966) pride is what enables man to “deceive himself into the belief that he is rational and virtuous when, in reality, he has not developed his reason, and his virtue is merely appearance”. The Lilliputians are proud of their military. But a simple invasion by the humans can totally crush them. The absurdity of their misplaced pride is shown in the incident in which they arrange a military parade in view of Gulliver’s exposed nether regions. The stay with the Brobdingnagians shows the destruction of human pride and vanity in appearance. When Gulliver sees the bodily features and functions at a close range, he understands the unattractiveness of the human body with its pores and pimples. As William. A. Eddy (1963) says, “all the transactions of life, all passion, and all social amenities, which involve the body, lose their respectability in Brobdingnag.” The Laputans are proud of their knowledge in mathematics and music but they are impractical in doing everyday things like building a house, tailoring clothes or even in ruling the country. Their pride makes the countrymen starve to death. Their wives wait for a chance to escape from the floating island to the land below. Towards the end, Gulliver himself becomes a victim of pride when he rejects humanity on the ground that they are Yahoos. He turns a blind eye to the virtue of Don Pedro and he cruelly rejects his wife and family.\n\nIn the whole text of Robinson Crusoe, Defoe never mentions his hero’s bodily functions. But Swift in Gulliver’s Travels places considerable emphasis on the bodily and excretory functions of the hero. This provides a satirical counterweight to the tendency of his age which championed man as a rational creature. Swift was quick to remind humanity that they were made of the same skin, blood, and bone as the animals, and shared their basic needs, appetites, and functions. The rationality and superiority based on that are just layers of pretensions that cover this truth.\n\nIn Gulliver’s Travels Swift raises the question of the conflict between the individual and the society. During most of his travels, Gulliver does not become one with the society that he visits. Even when he returns to England, he is not interested in staying and leaves as quickly as possible. It is only in the country of Houyhnhnms that he wishes to stay, and be assimilated in to it. The Houyhnhnm country is unique because it subjugates the individual for the good of the society as a whole.\n\nresponse was different. He applauded Swift for his wonderful work. Gulliver’s Travels was noticed in the wake of the First World War. The violence of the war made the similarity between the humans and the Yahoos felt more than ever. Though the book had its defenders, most of them were disappointed with Swift’s supposed misanthropy. But he was a man who was not just aware of the flaws of his fellow beings but also of their virtues. Whatever the critics may say, nothing can efface Gulliver’s Travels from being one in the list of the world’s most famous books.\n\nyou can view video on Jonathan Swift : Gulliver’s Travels\n\nReference"
