        "text": "After the death of the original Blue Streak, a new criminal named Jonathan Swift took over the identity. This Blue Streak was among the villains who survived the Skrull tissue-grafting operation orchestrated by the crime mistress Ricadonna who offered Blue Streak this after freeing the villains from prison.[1]\n\nHe was briefly seen skating through New York City before being stopped by Spectrum and arrested.[2]\n\nBlue Streak later formed a group of criminals with suits similar to his, and called them the Fast Five. The first time they acted together, they robbed a bank in New York. People soon alerted the Mighty Avengers of their activity. They skated through the city before coming across Spectrum and separating to prevent capture. However, the rest of the Mighty Avengers took care of them separately.[3]\n\nBlue Streak and the rest of the Fast Five appeared as inmates at Pleasant Hill.[4]\n\nBlue Streak was later seen as a member of the Army of Evil."
