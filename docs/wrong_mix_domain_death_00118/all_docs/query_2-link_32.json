        "text": "Jennifer Walker\n\nDean of Admissions and Financial Aid\n\nI was born in Boston and raised just south of the city. I spent my undergraduate and graduate years in New York, earning a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's in organizational and industrial psychology. I truly enjoy getting to know more about you through your personal statements or chatting with you during a campus visit. I have been an athlete all my life and swam competitively throughout college.\n\nWhen I am not at work, I like to spend as much time as I can outdoors. I try to take one adventure trip a year in addition to leading a wilderness service trip. I look forward to helping you through the admission process.\n\nJonathan Aleshire\n\nDirector of Admissions\n\nTerritories: Colorado, New York (Manhattan)\n\nI grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and headed south to North Carolina for a BS in business and an MBA. After some time in New York City working with a nonprofit focused on civic engagement, I made my transition to the great work of undergraduate admissions, where I have spent the majority of my career.\n\nIf I am not at work, you'll find me biking/walking around Boston, attending symphony and theatre performances, or working on home renovation projects. I look forward to connecting with you to share the Brandeis story and community and to learn about you.\n\nHarry Bachrach\n\nAssistant Director\n\nTerritories: California (Southern), Massachusetts (Cape Cod and Islands), Nevada, Rhode Island\n\nA native of Watertown, Massachusetts, I joined the Brandeis Admissions team in 2022. Prior to arriving at Brandeis, I worked in undergraduate admissions and digital marketing at Reed College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively. Outside of the office, I enjoy maintaining an active lifestyle and tirelessly cheering on Boston's professional sports teams. I graduated with a BA from Wheaton College (MA) and an M.Ed. from Northeastern University.\n\nI look forward to welcoming you to campus, in person or virtually!\n\nDaisy Culleton\n\nAssistant Director\n\nTerritories: Massachusetts (Essex County), Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington D.C.\n\nI grew up in Boston, both in the city and in the suburbs, and it is safe to say I am a proud Bostonian. I attended Wheaton College where I majored in psychology with a double minor in general education and women’s and gender studies. In my undergraduate experience, I discovered my passion for supporting and advising students in the college process.\n\nOutside of work, you will find me going to concerts, attempting to cook, playing board games and enjoying a picnic in the Boston Public Gardens. What drew me to Brandeis is the university’s commitment toward ensuring that all students feel welcomed and accepted. I am grateful to be a part of the Brandeis Admissions team and I look forward to meeting you.\n\nEmma Daszkiewicz\n\nAssistant Director\n\nTerritories: Alaska, Montana, Oregon, Washington\n\nInternational Territories: North America, the Caribbean, Central and South America, East Asia (Japan, North Korea, South Korea), Southeast Asia, and Central, Eastern, Western, and Southern Africa, Oceania\n\nI was born and raised in Seattle, WA, and attended Macalester College, where I studied History, French, and Latin. Prior to joining the Brandeis team, I served two years of service with AmeriCorps and worked in admissions at Trinity College. I am excited to join the Brandeis team and support students from all around the world as they navigate the college admissions process.\n\nOutside of work you can find me hiking, bouldering, cooking and baking. I am always looking for new ideas and recipes to try. I also spend lots of time with my cat, Aragorn.\n\nSamantha Epstein\n\nAssistant Director\n\nTerritories: Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, New York (excluding New York City)\n\nI was born and raised on Long Island, New York (the longest island, as I like to say), and headed upstate for college. I graduated from Union College in 2021, double majoring in Sociology and Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies.\n\nIt was during my undergraduate experience that I began to develop a passion for higher education, and it has continued to grow. My favorite part of Admissions is the interaction with students and helping them every step of the way.\n\nOutside of the office, you can find me trying to find the best penne alla vodka in Boston, listening to Taylor Swift, and cheering on the New York Jets (an unpopular opinion in the New England area, I know).\n\nI’m excited to be a part of the Brandeis community and help you through this process!\n\nStephanie Gallery\n\nAssociate Director\n\nTerritories: Massachusetts (Quincy, Plymouth, Norfolk, Bristol, Milton, Lexington, Waltham, Worcester)\n\nBorn in Boston, I was raised on (not in) Long Island, New York in a small town called Centerport. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a BA in English and women, gender and sexuality studies. During my undergraduate career, I was extremely involved in the Admissions department, working both as a campus tour guide and an admissions fellow. I discovered a passion for higher education, and a strong desire to help students navigate the ever-changing landscape of college admissions.\n\nWhen I'm not in the office, you can find me exploring the streets of Boston, baking cookies and cheering on the New York Islanders. I am thrilled to be a part of the Brandeis Admissions team and look forward to meeting you.\n\nMolly Kantrowitz\n\nSenior Assistant Director\n\nTerritories: California (Northern), New Hampshire, Vermont, Wyoming\n\nI grew up in Syracuse, NY and attended Colgate University where I studied psychology. After college, I moved to Boston and worked as a recruiter for a nonprofit organization. My interest in undergraduate admissions began with my own college search and continued as I volunteered in my university’s office of admission as a tour guide. I am so excited to join the team and work with students as they explore all that Brandeis has to offer!\n\nOutside of work I enjoy watching/listening to musical theater, trying out new restaurants, and taking walks around my neighborhood.\n\nRobin Khadduri\n\nSenior Assistant Director\n\nTerritories: Massachusetts (Lowell, Concord, and Wellesley)\n\nI grew up outside New Haven, CT with one dog, five cats, and two guinea pigs. We were a family of competitive swimmers, and my parents shuttled us all around New England to swim meets. I spent four years in Maine at Bowdoin College and then moved to the midwest to the University of Chicago, where I earned an MA in Public Policy. After years in admissions at independent schools in the Boston area, I realized my true passion was in higher education and pursued an EdM in Higher Education from Harvard University. I raised three children in Needham and now spend my free time going for long walks, trying out new recipes, and traveling. In the summer I spend some time with family up on Lake Champlain, hiking the Adirondack Mountains, kayaking, and playing board games (my new favorite is Code Names). I look forward to introducing you to the fantastic Brandeis community and helping you through the admissions process!\n\nAarti Lamberg\n\nAdmissions Counselor\n\nTerritories: Delaware, Massachusetts (Boston and Cambridge), Oklahoma, Pennsylvania (Eastern), Texas\n\nLilly Lin\n\nAssistant Director\n\nTerritories: Arizona, Connecticut, New Mexico\n\nI grew up in Wayland, MA and graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges where I studied media production. I also played on the women’s lacrosse team and worked for the recreation department during my time there. My own experience with admissions counselors was a large factor in my college decision, and I am excited to return the favor to prospective students!\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy thrift shopping, fishing, skiing, and spending time with my dog. In the summers, I love to vacation in Maine. I’m so excited to tell you more about all that Brandeis has to offer, and I can’t wait to meet you!\n\nPan Luo\n\nAssociate Director\n\nTerritories: Maine\n\nInternational Territories: East Asia (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan), Central Asia, South Asia, Southwest Asia (including Israel) , Europe, and Northern Africa\n\nI was born and raised in Sichuan, China - a place that is known for its wildly different landscapes, extremely spicy food, and giant pandas. I came to the U.S. for the first time for a cultural exchange program in Rutland, Vermont at the age of 17. It was life changing for me because it pushed me outside of my comfort zone to learn and grow.\n\nIn 2015, I moved to the U.S. for a master’s degree in International Higher Education and Intercultural Relations at Lesley University, where I found my passion in international recruitment & admissions and intercultural communication. Since then, I have been committed to supporting international students by drawing on both my first-hand experiences and professional expertise.\n\nIn my free time, you’re almost guaranteed to find me either trying to replicate different types of cuisines in my kitchen or uncovering underrepresented stories while traveling. I look forward to getting to know more about you and supporting you through the admissions process.\n\nJulia Mayhew\n\nAssociate Director, Marketing and Communications\n\nA native of Lexington, Massachusetts, I earned my undergraduate degree in communication at the University of New Hampshire, and also hold a master's degree in educational leadership and policy studies from Boston University. I'm thrilled to be a member of the Brandeis Office of Admissions and love meeting students and families on and off campus. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time outside, cooking and reading.\n\nCarrie Peterson\n\nAdmissions Counselor\n\nTerritories: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey\n\nI grew up in the suburbs of Minneapolis, MN, and moved out east for college, where I graduated from Boston College with a BA in Applied Psychology and Human Development. Throughout my undergraduate experience, I worked in admissions as a student panelist and tour guide and became passionate about speaking with and advising prospective students throughout the college admissions process.\n\nWhen I am not at work, I am often trying new restaurants in Boston’s North End, spending time in the city with friends, or baking (my specialties are bagels and cinnamon rolls)! I’ve spent the last 20 years as a dancer, but I am now looking forward to some new hobbies like running and pickleball. I am grateful to be part of the Brandeis admissions staff, and I look forward to getting to know you and being a resource for your college admissions journey!\n\nScarlett Ren '24\n\nAdmissions Counselor\n\nTerritories: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania (Western), Puerto-Rico and US Territories, Wisconsin, West Virginia\n\nBorn and raised in Shanghai, China, I attended junior high and high school in Seattle, Washington, before moving to Boston for college. My 10-plus years of experience studying abroad have fueled my passion for learning about our world and its people. I graduated from Brandeis in 2024 with double majors in International and Global Studies and Anthropology, along with minors in Journalism and Religious Studies.\n\nDuring my undergraduate years, I worked as a tour guide, interview fellow, and an executive board member. Now, I am excited to continue being part of the team as an admissions counselor, expanding educational access to students around the world. In my free time, you can find me journaling, traveling, or playing tennis. Can't wait to meet you all!\n\nTaylor Woods\n\nAssistant Director\n\nTerritories: Georgia, Massachusetts (Western), New York (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens), South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah\n\nI was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, and I call Western Massachusetts home. For college, I headed to New York City where I graduated from St. John’s University with a BA in English and two minors in communication arts and linguistics. Post-grad, I came back to the Bay State to obtain my master’s in Education Policy and Analysis from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. I completed my graduate assistantship here at Brandeis in the Department of Student Engagement. This (along with my experience as a student ambassador at my own undergraduate institution), was where I discovered my passion for working with and alongside students in order to cultivate engaging and welcoming educational spaces. The admissions office allows me to work with both prospective and current students in doing this!\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy traveling both locally and out of state. I also enjoy cooking (a newfound hobby), reading, and shopping!"
