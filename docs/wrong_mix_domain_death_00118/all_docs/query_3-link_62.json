        "text": "“A Modest Proposal” by Jonathan Swift. Where to start? Note to you: If you did not read it already, you should do it NOW. It’s controversial, absurd, outrageous and mostly, genius. I wrote a paper on it, which is not my best stylistically, but I decided to share it anyways in order to raise awareness of his oeuvre.\n\nIn order to prevent drastic consequences caused by controversial discussions that emerge from a current political issue, one has to find balance between logic and emotion when arguing about the best possible solution. When we take a look back in history, there are several events where a nation was out of balance and unaware of their horrific condition and actions undertaken to help themselves. Instead of politicians, it often took a smart public figure that was able to use his or her words as a weapon against the ongoing madness. The unjust society of Ireland in the 17th century was not a society that the Irish author Jonathan Swift imagined. His writings in defense of the Irish population aroused from his anger over the rich accounting for the millions of starving people and immense poverty. With his satire “A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick” or simply known as just “A Modest Proposal”, he addresses the lost balance during this Age of Reason where logic dictated everything by providing a proposal that suggests the opposite of what he means. He therefore mirrors the political and social situation. While he presents himself as a pure rationalist with a lack of emotion, we can discover his concerns about his country between his lines. The irony he makes use of underlines his desperation.\n\nIn the following, I will examine how A Modest Proposal acted like a mirror for the society and politics within the context of the Anglo- Irish story.\n\nThe historical context behind the mirror\n\nJonathan Swift, born in Dublin in 1667, always deeply identified with Ireland, although he was not exactly Irish. His parents were English, his father died a few months before Swift was born and the fact of this parental absence seems to have gone deep into Swift’s temper and identity. He was also separated from his mother when he was a year old because his nurse kidnapped him and kept him with her in England for a few years with his mother’s approval. He attended the Trinity College in Dublin and was an average student. Most of Ireland was Catholic, without money, social credit or political power. Swift belonged to the Anglo- Irish minority, who represented the English ruling class.\n\nHe had been born into a culture of frightening political and religious insecurity.\n\nThe English civil war took place in 1641 and started out as a rebellion against Protestants that had spread all over Ireland. After an attack from the Catholics against the Protestants, King James I was executed and Oliver Cromwell, a vigorous Protestant, took power. As a revenge for the massacre caused by the Catholics, he suggested a program to get rid of all Catholic power and influence in Ireland, and was highly successful. The monarchy had been restored in 1660, only a few years before Swift was born, but the fear lingered. The disorder and blood of the civil wars were living memories for those only slightly older than himself. Like many of his generation, Swift saw constitutional upheaval and wars over religion as evil as no possible positive outcome could justify. Swift did not think that humans were good by nature, which is why it was so important to him to have a church that urges a person to do charity and be good to one another. He was a passionate Anglican and the church was equally important to him as the crown.\n\nDespite the fact that Ireland’s foreign and domestic trade did well in the 18th century, the country faced several obstacles and was far from becoming a secure nation. Bans and tariffs on woolens sold to England, the fluctuation of the Irish coinage value and the constant threat of war caused frustration within the population. The Catholics, the lowest social class in Ireland at the time, struggled with being able to meet existential needs. Most of them were occupied as farmers, textile workers or in some kind of service. Hence the fact that they battled severe poverty, stealing or begging on the streets was common. What raised Jonathan Swift’s concern the most during this critical time, was the ever growing birth rate among the lower class. Too many children were born and the parents were incapable of feeding them.\n\nSatire as a tool to mirror\n\nSwift began writing satires in his twenties and his uncomplicated and witty style is what made him become known as a literary genius from his first publications on. Instead of rhetorical language, he chose to write down what he had to say without any filter. His fellow Scottish rhetorician Hugh Blair said “His style is style is of the plain and simple kind; free from all affection, and all superfluity; perspicuous, manly, and pure” (241). Taking into account that he was always concerned about current politics and social situations, he used this genre as a moral suasion considering that satire is mostly drawn to authority. With this purpose of catching the intention of those in charge of the dilemma, a satire has to shock the readers. It has to cast doubt on a serious matter, an issue that the author finds unacceptable, but in a way that it brings light to the unfairness. Being a satirist definitely wasn’t as easy during Swift’s time as it is today. Due to being the Dean of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin and heavily involved in church, it was difficult for him to reconcile his career and his satires, which often contained an unpredictable danger. He addressed. This is why he published several of his works under a pseudonymous. Jonathan Swift rarely told the readers what he wants people to do, how he wants politicians to operate. Instead, he mirrors what he observes in politics and society.\n\nThe persona and its effects\n\nJonathan Swift’s satire A Modest Proposal suggests his contrived solution to the problem of children being born into poor families that are unable to provide for them: Simply eat them. There’s also ways to make use of their organs in other convenient ways, according to his proposal. As if the content wasn’t already repulsive enough, he delivers it in a cold, distant manner.\n\nThis distance is mainly created by his choice of the persona. To quote US professor Dr. Tim McGee, “The voice that Swift will employ, is the voice of the accountant. . . . He uses a voice that is completely impersonal. All he cares about is the facts, the statistics”. Swift offers a several calculations in this proposal. As an illustration, he starts out by stating his concerns about prostitution and begging, there are no absurd ideas so far that may catch the reader’s attention. But then he turns the point by starting to offer some calculations on its own: For about a year, a newborn infant can be supported on breast-milk and two shillings, an amount that can easily be obtained by begging. After this undemanding first year, Swift’s proposal goes into effect. “I propose to provide for them in such a Manner, as, instead of being a Charge upon their Parents, or the Parish, or wanting Food and Raiment for the rest of their Lives; they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the Feeding, and partly to the Cloathing, of many Thousands” (Swift, 0). He justifies this idea with simple statistical data, such as calculating the amount of children born of poor parents each year: The populations counts around 1.5 million with approximately 200,000 women who are in a child bearing age. 30,000 might be financially stable to raise their child, so there are 170,000 left of whom 50,000 will have a miscarriage or child death within the first year. That means according to his calculation, a total of 120,000 children are born to poor parents each year. He continues with his justification by asking the reader for an alternative to the problem. “The question therefore is, How this number shall be reared, and provided for, which, as I have already said, under the present Situation of Affairs, is utterly impossible . . . .” (Swift, 0). Given these numbers and reckoning, his overall choice of vocabulary appears depersonalized, such as calling the women “breeders” (Swift, 3). The calmness of this proposal, caused by the straightforward voice, almost makes the reader agree with what he says. But once you let every sentence sink in, you get the horror and grotesque idea behind these facts and statistics.\n\nHolding the mirror: Society and politics\n\nSwift points out numerous advantages of his proposal. For instance, he speculates that the number of abortions will reduce, since they sacrifice “the poor babes . . . more to avoid the expense, than the shame. . . ” (Swift, 3) of having unwanted children. Again, it becomes clear that he only focuses on the logic. According to him, getting rid of their expenses is a lot more important to the women than feeling some sort of shame or guilt for these unmoral practices. This fact contributes to the overall tone of the proposal, free of any sort of emotion. But every human’s brain has a so called ‘neural valence meter’, which evokes a leaning towards a positive or negative feeling about something we hear or see. It is therefore impossible for us to avoid emotions. When reading about his proposition to reduce prostitution by eating babies and thus ending the poverty problem in Ireland, we face an inner controversy. We ask ourselves: What is more immoral? Prostitution or eating out babies? But Swift doesn’t see a problem here. We sell our bodies to others in order to earn an amount that is barely enough to feed us? We might as well just eat our babies with the outcome of ending our hunger or increasing the economy by using their organs for the production of clothes. But the problem with having a sense for what’s good and bad causes us to feel ashamed anyway. Swift portrays the Irish as cannibals, including the Anglo- Irish, by writing “. . . a well grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor’s feast” (Swift, 3). This shocked the readers, especially the ruling class, to which this sentence was clearly addressed. He mentions the fact that the Irish nation was devoured, by explaining how the rulers dealt with elderly people. He claims that they didn’t require any care because death is already awaiting at their door. “It is very well known, that they are everyday dying, and rotting, by cold, and famine, and filth, and vermin” (Swift, 2). Given this attitude towards the older generation, this information leaves us little to the imagination of the critical condition the population was in.\n\nAfter going into great detail on how to prepare the baby in a delicious way, he writes: “I grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title to the children” (Swift, 3). In a literal way, this doesn’t make any sense. Have the landlords eaten their tenants? No, what he means in a metaphorical sense is that through the exploitation and the tax raise they have already devoured them anyways, they might as well have their children to eat.\n\nHis real proposal\n\nThe condition of his home country was not the Ireland that Jonathan Swift wanted to see. He saw the injustice, the people suffering and knew that they were treated wrong by the crown. Despite belonging to the ruling class and being strongly committed to the Crown and Church, he disagreed with their actions taken against the Catholics. He was aware of the many possibilities the authorities had in order to release this struggling population from their misery. But they didn’t do anything. His frustration can be found between the lines throughout this proposal by his way of arguing. When you have an argument you make your case. Do you totally ignore the counterpoint or do you address it? Usually you do the latter. The only counterpoint to his proposal that Swift addresses is the fact that this is the perfect solution for Ireland’s problems, but it might not work for other countries. Other than that, he states:\n\nTherefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our Absentees at five Shillings a pound: Of using neither Cloaths, nor household Furniture, except what is of our own Growth and Manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the Materials and Instruments that promote Foreign Luxury: Of curing the Expenciveness of Pride, Vanity, Idleness . . . . (Swift, 4)\n\nand the list goes on. As mentioned in the beginning of my term paper, he now says exactly the opposite of what he means. He doesn’t want anyone to tell him about all the other possible actions they could do, but aren’t doing. He is clearly trying to reach the authorities with this statement, the lawmakers, who are the ones in charge of the situation.\n\nConclusion…\n\nJonathan Swift is still remembered and celebrated as an Irish hero, despite being of English descent and an Anglican clerk. He was a fighter for justice who didn’t want to see a population group suffer for belonging to a different Church. To him, this was not about religion, about being wrong or right. To him, this was about humanity. A Modest Proposal\n\nseems to be an entertaining satire that makes us shake our heads and laugh about the absurd idea he came across with nowadays. But with some historical background knowledge concerning the Anglo- Irish relationship, Swift raises is voice in favor of the Catholics and their desperate cry for help. With his choice of expressing this desperation by writing a political satire, he created a masterpiece that will forever be remembered. It will continue to provide subject matter and discussions in universities all over the world. By his frequent use of irony, he has given us information about all the options that could’ve been considered to end this misery and tells us how ridiculous the rulers were for not realizing them. He holds a mirror in front of the situation and tells the facts straightforward. Since they are incapable of finding a humane solution, they might as well forget about charity and equality. There are inhumane ways to handle this inhumane situation.\n\nBibliography\n\n“A Modest Proposal, by Dr. Jonathan Swift”. Project Gutenberg. 27 July 2008. Retrieved 10 January 2012.\n\nBlair, Hugh.
