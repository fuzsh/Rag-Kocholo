        "text": "2. Jonathan swift and Tale of the Tub -Nidhi Jethava -Kishan Jadav\n\n3. About Swift’s life -Swift was born in Dublin, in 1667. -His father dying before Jonathan’s birth, the boy was thrown upon the charity of an uncle, who paid for his education in Ireland. - Pen name : Isaac Bickerstaff, M. B. Drapier, Lemuel Gulliver, Wagstaff, Esq. -Occupation : Satirist, Essayist, Political Pamphleteer, Poet, Priest. - Language : English -Alma mater : Trinity College, Doblin - Family : Father- Jonathan Swift Mather – Abigail Erick - Friends : Close friend Thomas Sheridan, Alexander Pope, John Gay, and John Arburthnot. - Education : the Kilkenny school, Dublin University ( Trinity College, Dublin) in 1682\n\n4. Notable Works 1. A Tale of a Tub (1704)– Ridiculed the extravagances of religion, literature, and academia 2. The Battle the Books(1697)- mock debate b/w ancient and modern authors 3. The Tatler – Popular English periodicals to which Swift contributed essays 4. Gulliver’s Travels (1720)– Swift’s satirical masterpiece written while living in Ireland 5. Modest Proposal – Published in 1729 and criticizes the English treatment of the Irish\n\n5. Major Concepts -Jonathan used satire to call attention to the social and political state of Ireland at his time. -A Modest Proposal is a satirical work about the poverty in Ireland. -Gulliver’s travels is satire about the state of English politics, law system, and education.\n\n6. Swift died on October 19, 1745. He wrote a Latin epitaph for himself, which Yeats translated into English : Swift sailed into his rest; Savage indignation there Cannot lacerate his breast. Imitate him if you dare, World- besotted traveller; he Served human liberty.\n\n7. A Tale Of Tub\n\n8. About A Tale of Tub - A Tale of a Tub, also published in 1704, written in 1696, is regarded by many as Swift’s best work. - It certainly reveals his power at its highest. - It is a religious allegory, perhaps suggested by the work of Bunyan, on three men 1. Peter- who stand for Roman Catholic Church 2. Jack – who represents the Dissenters 3. Martin – the personification of the Anglican and Lutheran Churches.\n\n9. - Each of the three has a coat left to him by his father, and they have many experiences, beginning with the changes that they make on the coats that have been left to them. - This book is attack on ‘enthusiasm’ of Roman Catholics and Dissenters alike, and culminates in a fierce attack upon jack.\n\n10. - But, though Martin escapes comparatively lightly, Swift’s contempt is poured on so many of the fundamental principles of religion that the book led many to suspect his own Christianity. - Indeed, the scope of the work widens until it becomes a merciless dissection of human nature in general, and of intellectual pride and religion hypocrisy in particular."
