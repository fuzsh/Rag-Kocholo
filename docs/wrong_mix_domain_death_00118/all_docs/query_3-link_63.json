        "text": "Man has always been seen as a reasonable creature whose actions are the manifestations of reason. As a matter of fact, the dominance of reason has resulted in the establishment of rules and norms that enhanced the superiority of man in general and the Western man in particular during the eighteenth century. Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, however, presents us with another picture. This essay will succinctly bring to the forefront this picture and show how Swift excelled in using some rhetorical devices like satire, irony, burlesque, and grotesque to castigate mankind. Key words: Horacian Satire, Juvenelian Satire, mankind, society, British literature.\n\nThe eighteenth century is known for the emergence of free thought, rationalism and critical thinking, and for the liberation of the arts and sciences from superstition. Jonathan Swift, being a devoted Anglican, was also a formidable critic of the Enlightenment thought, making his skepticism of modern learning a major theme in his writing. In Gulliver’s Travels Swift challenges the idea that truth can be empirically defined by a simple collection of facts, and he argues that humans are not rational animals. In a letter to Pope, Swift wrote that he has material towards a treatise proving the falsity of that definition animal rationale and to show it would be only rationis capax, i.e. capable of reason. This is especially evident in Part IV, in the land of the Houyhnhnms. I will focus on this last part of the Travels and will compare it to the empirical philosophy of John Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding. My aim is to discuss Gulliver’s shift to madness, following his inability to internalize the perceptions of the societies in which he happens to find himself and his irrational aspiration to become one of the “horses”. The current paper will concentrate on the interplay of truth and lies, central to Swift’s writing and language, as the tool for achieving a subtle irony, enhanced by Gulliver’s obsession with truth, self-deception, and constant contradictions. Arguably, the target of Swift’s satire are not lies, but the denial of lies and the pursuit of reason at all costs.\n\nGulliver seemed unremarkable, but diligent readers were quite eager to believe what he told them. The customary introduction of Gulliver's Travels of Lilliput enticed the readers into taking the hero and his judgment of his early career at face value. Swift almost makes us believe that Gulliver kept a diary of his activities. This would have preserved the spontaneity and surprise of each encounter, just like it was done in other travelogues and adventure tales of the era. Swift is conveying what he believed to be the most important form of truth, moral truth about human nature and human history, for which the fiction provides a vehicle, says Robert P. Fitzgerald1 ironically but just as but just as assertively. Swift acknowledged that he intended for his satire to \"vex\" the world, and it is undoubtedly in his tone that one can most clearly detect his aims. The most significant aspect that Dr. Bowdler brought up was probably not the foul language or the pornographic scenes2 but the sarcastic tone of Gulliver's Travels was altered from the original. The original's tone swings from mild comedy to outright disdain, but there is always some element of satire present. Dr. Bowdler made it into a children's picture book by removing the irony.\n\nJonathan Swift's satire Gulliver's Travels has always been subject of extensive research. However, some points are deserving of more discussion. The present essay aims to exploit those points, namely the languages invented by the author, tracing their possible origins and explaining their glosses as accurately as achievable, by researching the most relevant references available like Ehrenpreis (1948), Asimov (1980), Clark (1972) and Pons (1972), and investigating the relevant matters in his writing, hence providing a more specific study on Swift's memorable glossopoeias, which, in turn, will also corroborate to a wider understanding of the writer's satiric view, otherwise hidden in the author's neologisms. While this paper does not claim to have deciphered every and any 'artificial' word Swift coined, it has certainly contributed an enhanced comprehension of the glossopoeias found in the texts. General Terms-Literary Theory; English Literature; Jonathan Swift\n\nGulliver’s Travels (1726), by Jonathan Swift, is one of the classics of English literature, a biting satire of English customs and politics in particular and of human foibles in general. While literary scholars have traditionally agreed that, in Part IV of Gulliver’s Travels, Swift uses his elegant anthropomorphic horses and his filthy human-like Yahoos to reflect on society and human nature, some recent studies highlight Swift’s ecocritical concern with animal issues, focusing on how the behaviour of the noble horses challenges the conventional hierarchies of the anthropocentric view of the world and anticipates values that are prominent in today’s society. However, this article aims to show that what has traditionally challenged and disturbed readers, publishers and critics for many years is the presence of the other race of the animal world, the Yahoos. Analysing the reception of Gulliver’s journey to the land of the Houyhnhnms helps understand how Swift’s early ecocritical ideas..."
