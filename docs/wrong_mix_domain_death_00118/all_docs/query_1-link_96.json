        "text": "Timelines are in flux. Future unclear. Try again later.\n\nThe timeline of the Cyberpunk series has gone through many iterations, with new sourcebooks and games continually expanding on its world. This article covers the canonical timeline following events from Cyberpunk 2013 and Cyberpunk 2020, as established by R. Talsorian Games and CD Projekt RED in Cyberpunk RED and Cyberpunk 2077. Information about the non-canon Cyberpunk Version 3.0 and its alternate timeline can be found in that article.\n\nOther timelines are included within the Japan, China, Soviet Union, Korea, and Australia articles, as well as those for South-East Asia and Europe.\n\nSeries history[]\n\nReleased in 1988, the first Cyberpunk game, Cyberpunk 2013 introduced players to the world of the dark future. Three supplementary books were released, fleshing out the world and character roles.\n\nIn 1990, a second edition was released, titled Cyberpunk 2020, the timeline was moved forward 7 years to the year 2020. As a result much of the information from 2013 was greatly expanded upon, the setting of Night City became real and many of the corporations were given full backstories.\n\nIn 1993, the timeline was again pushed forward by another 7 years with CyberGeneration, which focused on supernatural abilities in a more dangerous world. The CyberGeneration series then turned into a spin-off in an alternate reality.\n\nIn 1997, the Firestorm books were published. These two—originally three—adventure books were meant to introduce the concept of the Fourth Corporate War to the player and move the story forward into the late 2020s-30s. The campaign pitched the player up against Arasaka, but with the help of many of the named characters throughout the series such as Morgan Blackhand and Johnny Silverhand. A third Firestorm book was planned but eventually became part of the Cyberpunk V3.0 rule book.\n\nIn 2005, Cyberpunk Version 3.0 was published. The timeline was pushed into the 2030s and was a direct followup to the events of the Firestorm series. In 3.0, the world had to deal with the fallout of the Fourth Corporate War and the Arasaka nuke in Night City, and the data corruption on the Net. Reviews were negative based on the setting change as well as some of the presentation elements in the book.\n\nIn 2013, Polish video game developer CD Projekt RED announced they had acquired the licence to develop video games based on the Cyberpunk series with creator Mike Pondsmith working closely with the Polish studio. Cyberpunk 2077 would move the timeline much further into the year 2077. The game had a full reveal in 2018, with players assuming the role of V, a lowly cyberpunk in Night City.\n\nMike Pondsmith later announced Cyberpunk RED, a new edition of the pen & paper RPG set sometime before 2077. As a result of the RED Edition and 2077, the timeline was significantly changed. Creator Mike Pondsmith has said the official timeline is up in the air in regards to the later editions. As such, elements of the Firestorm books and the Cyberpunk v3.0 books have been retired, though which elements are currently unknown.\n\nWith the release of the Cyberpunk RED Jumpstart kit, it is revealed that the Fourth Corporate War, the crash of the Net, and the Arasaka mini-nuke events all canonically occur. The World Book places the Fourth Corporate War as starting in 2021 but becoming official in 2022. The crash of the Net is caused by the DataKrash virus, triggered by a dead-man switch activated with the death of Rache Bartmoss, which happens in 2022. The Arasaka mini-nuke event is referred to as the \"Night City Holocaust\" and is shown to take place in 2023.\n\nRegional timelines[]\n\nGreater Europe Timeline: Future Past - Timeline of Europe (1990-2020)\n\nSouth-East Asia Timeline - Timeline of Southeast Asia (1940-2019)\n\nTimeline overview[]\n\nThe timeline of the Cyberpunk series diverges dramatically from our own around roughly the 1990s—although other divergences do occur well before then, albeit smaller in size and scope—where the fall of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War leads to a dissemination of nuclear weapons on the black market. Coupled with a US government \"deep state\" called the Gang of Four, the world soon finds itself in the midst of an economic crisis and the Collapse. Proxy wars, trade wars, and a resurgent Europe butt against the prevailing US world order. Eventually, brief nuclear exchanges and biological warfare around the globe cause the gradual decline of Western civilization. Societies collapse and many governments either dissolve or are reduced to reactionary, petty authoritarian states.\n\nIn the chaos, corporations fill the vacuum of power amidst a collapsing social order. Technological advances, unbridled from government oversight or ethical limitations, lead to hundreds of new inventions. As time wears on, some corporations become as powerful as the countries they are housed in. Ultimately, four corporate wars have occurred by 2023, each one becoming more overt and deadly than the last. The infamous Fourth Corporate War was brought to an end by the detonation of a nuclear bomb in the heart of Night City. The years that followed until 2045, the Time of the Red, were a period of global reconstruction as corporations and governments alike tried to recover from unparalleled economic and environmental damage. By 2077, corporate influence is more pervasive than ever, and fears of another devasting corporate war loom large on the horizon.\n\nLawlessness, chaos and technology. This is the world of Cyberpunk.\n\n1800s - 1980s[]\n\n1800s[]\n\nSasai Arasaka is born in the mid-to-late 1800's.\n\nYui is born.\n\nAkio Nagawa is born.\n\n1905[]\n\nSasai Arasaka gets married to Yui.\n\n1916[]\n\nThe Arasaka Corporation is founded by Sasai Arasaka.\n\n1919[]\n\nSaburo Arasaka is born.[1]\n\n1935[]\n\nAntonio Luccessi is born.[2]\n\n1939[]\n\nWorld War 2 begins.\n\n1942[]\n\nSaburo Arasaka is heavily wounded in combat.
