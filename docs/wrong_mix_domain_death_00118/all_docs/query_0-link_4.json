        "text": "New York, US\n\nNamed after Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver’s Travels, this iconic New York City Irish pub opened in 1995 and has since cemented itself as one of the best neighbourhood drinking dens in the city. The perfectly weathered interiors – characterised by a long winding bar, exposed brick walls, reclaimed church pews and tattered old barstools – draws creative types looking for a quiet place for smart conversation. Think civilised revelry, with no televisions to distract from human connections at hand. Drinks-wise, folks are choosing options from the extensive beer list (scrawled in white chalk on looming blackboards) or from the cornucopia of Irish whiskies that line the back bar. Those in the know will tell you the well-trained staff also pour one of the best pints of Guinness in the city.\n\nKey Information\n\nMon — Sun\n\n12122603600\n\nVisit Swift Hibernian Lounge's Website\n\nLocation\n\n34 E 4th St, NoHo, New York, New York, 10003"
