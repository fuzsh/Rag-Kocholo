Professor Sri-Kartini Leet, Head of School for Art, Design and Performance at Buckinghamshire New University, has been appointed as commissioned artist for Amersham Museum.

The project is co-funded by Arts Council England and The Rothschild Foundation and is part of a three-year partnership between Essex Cultural Diversity Project and Farnham Maltings.

The aim of the commission is to work with adults aged 30 and under, to creatively capture and present recollections and stories about Amersham from a diverse range of local people who have been born since the museum opened in 1991.

Over the next six months Professor Leet will explore the idea of locating one’s roots through significant memories, objects or places in relation to Amersham, and creating portraits of a diverse selection of those living in Amersham within their homes. This project extends Kartini’s research interests in our relationships with the environment and our homes, explored through photography; and the different ways domestic space can represent identity and a sense of cultural belonging.

Amersham residents will also play an active part in contributing to a visual archive through their selection of significant images and sharing the narratives relating to them.

The commission will culminate in an exhibition at Amersham Museum with the portraits capturing a different connection to place and growing on the museum’s collection of local stories.
