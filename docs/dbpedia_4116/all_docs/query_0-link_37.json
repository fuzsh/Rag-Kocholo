        "text": "RESULTS\n\nGenetic differentiation of Indochinese Lipinia\n\nSequence data: The final alignment of the COI gene contained 681 aligned characters, including 422 conserved sites and 257 variable sites, of which 252 were parsimony-informative. The transition-transversion bias (R) was estimated as 1.577 (all data given for ingroup only). Nucleotide frequencies were 22.72% (A), 28.92% (T), 27.86% (C), and 20.50% (G).\n\nGenetic diversity and geographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes: The phylogenetic analysis results of the examined Lipinia species are presented in . We also calculated a tree with more outgroup taxa, representing different groups of lygosomine skinks (Supplementary Figure S1).\n\nBoth the BI and ML phylogenetic analyses resulted in essentially similar topologies. Phylogenetic relationships within the genus Lipinia remained fundamentally unresolved in our analyses, whereas monophyly of species-level groups was highly supported (1.0/100, hereafter node support values are given for BI PP/ML BS, respectively) ( ). In the additional analysis involving more outgroup taxa, monophyly of the genus Lipinia was not supported, and all higher-level taxonomic relationships between this genus and other lygosomine skink genera (i.e., Lygosoma, Eutropis, Tropidophorus, and Sphenomorphus) remained unresolved (Supplementary Figure S1). Monophyly of the L. vittigera species complex was not supported in either analysis ( ; Supplementary Figure S1).\n\nOur analyses revealed unexpectedly high genetic diversity within the Indochinese Lipinia skinks, contradicting current taxonomy of the group. In Indochina, four major mtDNA lineages were recovered (lineages A–D; see for phylogenetic tree and for geographic distribution of revealed lineages):\n\n(1) Lineage from southern peninsular Thailand (Surat Thani Province), corresponding to L. vittigera sensu stricto (see below) (lineage C, see ).\n\n(2) Lineage from Kon Tum Province of Vietnam and adjacent part of Ratanakiri Province of Cambodia, corresponding to the spotted form of L. cf. vittigera (lineage B, see ). This lineage forms a well-supported clade with L. vittigera sensu stricto lineage C from southern Thailand (1.0/100).\n\n(3) Lineage recorded from lowland and hilly areas of central and southern Vietnam, as well as from across Cambodia, five-striped form specimens, corresponding to the traditionally recognized subspecies L. v. microcercus (lineage A, see ).\n\n(4) Lineage recorded from hilly areas in southern Vietnam and Cambodia, corresponding to the three-striped form of L. cf. vittigera (lineage D, see ).\n\nThe three mtDNA lineages of L. cf. vittigera recorded from Indochina, north of the Isthmus of Kra, correspond to distinct morphotypes and color forms and were never recorded in the same biotope. However, their ranges appear largely overlapping (see ) and the geographic distance between two localities where different mtDNA lineages/morphotypes occur is as little as 15 km (e.g., between localities 11 and 22 in ). While the five-striped form (lineage A, L. v. microcercus) widely occurs in southern Indochina from the central Annamites to southern Vietnam and Cambodia (possibly also penetrating into Thailand), the three-striped form (lineage D) is confined to hilly areas of southern Annam (Langbian Plateau), Cambodia, southernmost Vietnam (and possibly southeast Thailand), whereas the spotted form (lineage B) is restricted to a narrow area in the central Annamites on the border of Vietnam and Cambodia ( ).\n\nGenetic distances: The uncorrected P-distances among and within the studied mtDNA fragments for the examined Lipinia species are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Intraspecific genetic distances in all examined species were below the level P=3.5% (in the three-striped form, lineage D). The interspecific uncorrected genetic P-distances between Lipinia species varied from 7.1% (between L. noctua (Lesson) and Lipinia sp. from Palau) to 23.4% (between Lipinia sp. from Palau and spotted form, lineage B). Genetic differentiation among the four lineages of L. vittigera sensu lato from Indochina was surprisingly high and varied from 15.5% (between lineages B and C) to 20.4% (between lineages B and D). This degree of pairwise divergence is high, notably greater than the genetic divergence observed between many recognized species of Scincidae (e.g., Murphy et al., 2013; Nagy et al., 2012; Neang et al., 2018; Okamoto & Hikida, 2012).\n\nSystematics\n\nRecent study demonstrated that the genus Lipinia likely does not represent a monophyletic group, but rather is an assemblage of distantly related sphenomorphine skinks (Grismer et al., 2016; Linkem, 2013). Reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among members of the Lipinia assemblage would require much broader taxon sampling and a multilocus approach combining data from several mtDNA and nuDNA markers. In the present paper, we applied COI DNA-barcoding, which is a useful tool for uncovering cryptic diversity in squamate reptiles, including members of the family Scincidae. We did not aim to discuss phylogenetic relationships of Indochinese Lipinia or use COI-barcoding solely for assessment of their genetic diversity and distribution of mtDNA lineages.\n\nThe four mtDNA lineages revealed within the L. vittigera species complex were highly divergent, with uncorrected genetic distances exceeding P=15.5%. The PCA results corroborated these findings and indicated that each mtDNA lineage occupies a unique position in morphospace that did not overlap with any other species in the ordination of the first two principle components (PC) ( ). PC1 accounted for 28.24% of the variation in the dataset, with loading for snout-tympanum length, snout-forelimb length, head width, head height, and snout-vent length, whereas PC2 accounted for an additional 16.05% of the variation, with loading for frontonasal width, snout length, number of light stripes on dorsum and flanks, and head length ( ; Supplementary Table S3). These results suggest deep differentiation of the four Indochinese lineages of Lipinia skinks, not only in genetic, but also in morphological characters. Additional differences in morphological and color characters not amenable to statistical analyses are discussed in the comparison sections of each species and summarized in .\n\nTable 1\n\nCharacter\n\nLipinia vittigera\n\ns. str.\n\nLipinia microcercus\n\nstat. nov.\n\nLipinia trivittata\n\nsp. nov.\n\nLipinia vassilievi\n\nsp. nov.\n\nSVL35.5–37.830.1–41.931.0–44.439.4TaL/SVL–0.98–1.650.81–1.551.04TrunkL/SVL0.41–0.470.44–0.540.44–0.510.47SL/SVL0.15–0.160.09–0.160.09–0.170.11STL/SVL0.250.21–0.260.21–0.260.25SFIL/SVL0.40–0.450.34–0.440.39–0.430.41FLL/SVL0.23–0.240.19–0.360.25–0.350.33HLL/SVL0.29–0.300.24–0.430.28–0.450.44Frontonasal (W>L)NoYesYesYesPrefrontals in contactNo or slightlyYesYes or slightlyYesFrontal contacting supraoculars1+2+31+2 or 1+2+31+2 or 1+2+31+2Frontoparietals contacting supraoculars3+43+43+43+4Supraciliaries76–97–910–11MSR30–3228–3228–3228MDSR48–5248–5848–5856Ventrals5654–6656–7066Subdigital lamellae on 4th finger15–1618–2120–2614–15Subdigital lamellae on 4th toe22–2524–3229–3319–21Dark temporal markingsBlack mottling or irregular spotsWide black stripe, at least two times wider than DLLSNarrow black stripe ca. same width as DLLSNarrow black stripe ca. same width as DLLSMiddorsal light stripe (MDLS)Wide, 2-scales wideNarrow, 1-scale wideWide, 2-scales wide1–2-scales wideParavertebral dark stripes (PDS)Subequal to MDLS, continuing on tailWider than MDLS, continuing on anterior 3/4 of tailSubequal to MDLS, not continuing on tailSubequal to MDLS, not continuing on tailDorsolateral light stripe (DLLS)IndistinctDistinct with regular borders, 1-scale wideDistinct on head and anterior 1/3 of bodyDistinct, with irregular borders; 2-scales wideLateral dark stripe (LDS)Absent, irregular dark mottlingAlways distinct, broad: 2–3-scales wide, running from temporal area to anterior 3/4 of tail, forming row of ocelliNarrow: 1-scale wide, starting in temporal area and becoming indistinct in first 1/2 of bodyIrregular row of dark ocelli running from temporal area to groinLateral light stripe (LLS)IndistinctDistinct with regular borders, 1-scale wideIndistinctWide stripe (2–3-scales wide) with poorly defined bordersVentrolateral dark stripe (VLDS)AbsentNarrow (1-scale wide) stripe or row of dark ocelli between axilla and groinAbsentDistinct row of dark ocelli from lower jaw to axilla continuing to groin\n\nThe data on genetic divergence, together with congruent differentiation of mtDNA lineages in morphospace revealed by PCA and other morphological differences compiled below, support our hypothesis that at least four distinct species, as described in the following taxonomic accounts, should be recognized within the Indochinese members of the L. vittigera species complex, two of which appear to be new to science.\n\nLipinia vittigera sensu stricto (=Lygosoma vittigerum) (Boulenger, 1894)\n\nFigures 5A-B, 7A-B, 8-9; Tables 1, 2.\n\nChresonymy\n\nLygosoma vittigerum Boulenger, 1894, p. 615; Sworder, 1933, p. 102;\n\nLeiolopisma vittigerum — Barbour, 1912, p. 187;\n\nLeiolopisma vittigerum vittigerum — Smith, 1935, p. 306; Taylor, 1963, p. 1029; Bourret, 2009, p. 274;\n\nLygosoma (Leiolopisma) vittigerum — Smith, 1937, p. 224;\n\nLygosoma (Scincella) vittigerum vittigerum — Grandison, 1972, p. 82;\n\nLipinia vittigera — Greer, 1974, p. 11; Manthey & Grossmann, 1997, p. 266; Cox et al., 1998, p. 116; Grismer et al., 2002, p. 27; Pauwels et al., 2003, p. 28; Nguyen et al., 2005, p. 59; Das & Austin, 2007, p. 66; Grismer, 2011a, p. 149; Grismer, 2011b, p. 606; Chan-ard et al., 2015, p. 111;\n\nLipinia cf. vittigera — Teo & Rajathurai, 1997, p. 415;\n\nLipinia vittigera (?) — Onn et al., 2010, p. 140;\n\nLipinia vittigera vittigera — Das, 2010, p. 237; Grossmann, 2010, p. 2; Bucklitsch et al., 2012, p. 325.\n\nLygosoma vittergerum — Grismer, 2011b, p. 606 (ex errore).\n\nHolotype: MSNG 55855, adult male ( ), collected by Elio Modigliani from Sereinu (=Sipora), Mentawei, Sumatra (Indonesia) ( , locality 1). A re-description of the holotype was published by Bucklitsch et al. (2012).\n\nParatypes: None.\n\nDiagnosis: Based on the holotype, additional specimens examined from Penang (Malaysia) and peninsular Thailand (Appendix I) as well as literature data from peninsular Malaysia and Singapore (Grismer, 2011b): small (SVL to 44 mm) species of Lipinia, differentiated from congeners by the following combination of external traits: external ear opening present; lower eyelid bearing large transparent spectacle; 28–30 midbody scale rows; 48–56 middorsal scales between parietals and point above vent; 15–16 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; 20–26 lamellae under toe IV; prefrontals in punctiform or broad contact; seven supralabials, seven infralabials; broad middorsal light stripe from snout tip to tail base; two paravertebral dark stripes from supraoculars toward tail, continuing on anterior part of tail; flanks dotted brown, without any distinct dark or light stripes.\n\nEtymology: Although not stated by Boulenger (1894), the species name “vittigerum” is derived from Latin “vitta” for a head band used by Roman priests during rituals and “gero” (to wear), as a reference to the banded dorsal pattern of this species. Due to the feminine gender of the genus name Lipinia,the species epithet has to be adapted to “vittigera”.\n\nDescription of holotype: Measurements and counts of holotype are presented in detail in .

DTM, indistinct dark mottling in temporal region ( B, see D for the same specimen in preservative).\n\nType locality: Sereinu Island (=Sipura), Mentawai Archipelago, west of Sumatra; see Boulenger (1894) and Bucklitsch et al. (2012) for discussion.\n\nVariation: Measurements of the holotype and referred specimens are presented in . Certain morphological variation was found among the examined specimens. For example, the frontonasal width is smaller than its length in the holotype and specimen from Penang, Malaysia (ZFMK 48542), but width is greater than its length in the specimen from southern peninsular Thailand (ZMMU R-14477). In addition, the prefrontals are not in contact in the holotype, but are touching slightly in the Penang specimen (ZFMK 48542) and broadly contacting in the Thai specimen (ZMMU R-14477). The taxonomic value of these differences is unclear and requires broader molecular and morphological sampling from the Thai-Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\nDistribution: See .In mainland Southeast Asia, L. vittigera sensu stricto seems to be restricted to an area south of the Isthmus of Kra, though additional research on the Thai-Malay Peninsula populations is needed to confirm this assumption. Distribution of the species in peninsular Malaysia and its offshore islands was reviewed by Grismer (2011b). The species has been reported from: Peninsular Thailand: “Tasan, Isthmus of Kra” (Smith, 1935); Nakhon Si Thammarat Prov.: Khao Ram Rome Mt. (P. Pawangkhanant, personal communication); Surat Thani Prov.: Phanom (KUH 328480); Phanom Dist. (ZMMU R-14477; see material examined, Appendix I); Peninsular Malaysia: Pulau Pinang (Penang) (ZFMK 48542); Lata Tembaka, Terengganu; Jor, Perak, Kuala Teku, Pahang, Kepong and Ulu Langat, Selangor; and Endau Rompin and Gunung Panti, Johor (Denzer & Manthey, 1991; Grandison, 1972; Grismer, 2011b; Norsham & Ong, 2001; Onn et al., 2010; Smith, 1922; Tanner, 1953; Wood et al., 2004); Seribuat Archipelago: Pulau Aur and Pulau Babi Besar, Johor, and Pulau Tioman, Pahang (Grismer et al., 2006); Singapore (Baker & Lim, 2008); Mentawai Archipelago (Boulenger, 1894) (MSNG 55855); as well as in Sumatra and northern Borneo (Das, 2010). Distribution records from north of the Isthmus of Kra often lack a clear assignment to one of the former subspecies, i.e., L. v. vittigera or L. v. microcercus. Thus, those records need further research to verify species assignment (see account on L. microcercus stat. nov.). Smith (1935) and Taylor (1963) published several records of L. v. vittigera from northern and eastern Thailand: “Chantaboon (=Chantaburi); Rehang district; Meh Lem, Meh Wang in N. Siam”. However, without having seen the reference specimens, it is not possible to decide to which species of the L. vittigera complex those records belong.\n\nNatural history: Grismer (2011a, 2011b) summarized several field observations from peninsular Malaysia and its offshore islands, with the species occurring in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests (primary and secondary) from 0 to 600 m a.s.l., and with a preferred microhabitat including trunks of large trees up to a height of 10 m. Reproduction was described by Goldberg & Grismer (2014): gravid females were recorded in March; females lay two to three eggs; hatchlings were observed in July.\n\nRemarks: Our study suggests that the range of L. vittigera sensu stricto is restricted to the Mentawei Archipelago, Sumatra, the Thai-Malay Peninsula south of Kra Isthmus, and Borneo. The northern extent of its distribution is unknown and requires further studies. However, certain morphological variation was observed even within our limited sampling on L. vittigera sensu stricto. No data on variation of Bornean populations of L. vittigera are available. Grismer (2011b) reported color variation between specimens from Pulau Tioman, Pahang, which exhibited thin vertebral stripes only one scale wide, whereas specimens from peninsular Malaysia showed wider vertebral stripes, usually two scale rows wide. These data suggest that diversity of the L. vittigera complex in Peninsular Malaysia and Sundaland may still be underestimated. Thus, further morphological and molecular studies are needed to address these questions.\n\nLipinia microcercus stat. nov.

He treated this as a flexible adjective by adjusting it to the neutral gender of the genus name Lygosoma. However, such an adjective does not exist in the Latin language. The noun “cercus” is a Latinized version of the ancient Greek “κέρκος (kérkos)” in female gender, meaning “tail”. When used as a noun in apposition, the species epithet cannot be reflected and therefore must be used as “microcercus”.\n\nRedescription of holotype: Measurements and counts of holotype are presented in detail in . Head scalation of holotype is detailed in E–F. Adult male ( ), SVL 41.9 mm, TaL 44.5 mm.\n\nSnout acute, SL 6.2 mm; nostrils oriented laterally, oval, situated closer to snout tip than to orbit, END 2.5 mm; head long, almost twice as long as wide, HL 9.8 mm, HW 5.1 mm, HL/HW ratio 1.92, flattened, HH 3.3 mm, HL/HH ratio 2.97; rostral broad, visible in dorsal view, posterior border almost straight, contact zone with nasals slightly emarginated, frontonasal wider than long; frontal elongated, arrow-shaped, wider anteriorly; prefrontals large, in broad contact medially ( F), laterally and posteriorly in contact with loreals, enlarged presupraocular, first supraocular, frontal and frontonasal; two frontoparietals in broad median contact; interparietal arrow-shaped, wider anteriorly; parietals in contact behind interparietal, anteriorly in contact with postsupraoculars, nuchals, and frontoparietals; six nuchals; four supraoculars; one enlarged presupraocular, visible from above; seven supraciliaries; nostrils located within nasals; postnasal absent; two loreals, slightly elongated, second longer than first; two enlarged presuboculars, separating supralabials III and IV from eye; seven supralabials, supralabial V largest, in contact with orbit; three postsuboculars, separating supralabial VI from orbit; six postsupraoculars (pretemporals); one primary temporal; two secondary temporals, dorsal largest; two postsupralabials; lower eyelid bearing large transparent spectacle ( F); scales on upper row of lower eyelid small, 11 in number; mental wider than long; one postmental, in contact with first infralabial and anterior portion of second infralabial; seven infralabials; three pairs of chinshields, first pair in contact medially, second pair separated by one scale, third pair separated by three scales; external ear opening visible and subcircular (Figures 7E, 10E).\n\nBody slender, TrunkL 22.8 mm; head slightly distinct from neck and body; 56 middorsal scales from parietal to point above vent, scales in four median longitudinal rows enlarged; ventrals in 58 rows, counted from first postgular to preanal scales; body scales smooth, subcycloid; 28 scales around midbody; six slightly enlarged preanals; tail relatively long, TaL/SVL ratio 0.94, tip rounded; tail gradually tapering to point; median row of subcaudals enlarged; Limbs slender, pentadactyl, and clawed; forelimb and hindlimb meeting when adpressed; Subdigital lamellae under finger IV: 21 ( G); subdigital lamellae under toe IV: 26 ( H); all subdigital lamellae enlarged ( G–H).\n\nColoration in preservative: See ; MDLS whitish, from head to tail base, widening at point above vent and merging into light brownish coloration of tail. MDLS on midbody about one scale wide, covering interior halves of two paravertebral scale rows. Two brownish PVDS from snout to tail base, about two scales wide, continued by row of eight irregular brown blotches on both sides of anterior half of tail. Two fawn DLLS, starting on supraoculars, running down to point above vent, merging with MDLS and light brownish tail coloration. Laterally, on flanks, stripes sharply bordered by blackish brown LDS, starting at nostrils, extending to hind margin of hindlimbs. Ventral margin of LDS less sharp, sometimes frayed. LLS cream, only separated from light cream ventral trunk surface by faint narrow patch of brown spots (VLDS) between axilla and groin. DTM as wide dark band, about two times wider than DLLS above, running from posterior margin of eye to temporal region and further posteriorly on body flanks, joining with LDS ( E). Labials and surrounding of outer ear opening fawn white with some faint irregular brown pigmentation. Dorsal surface of tail light brown, becoming darker on lateral sides. Anterior third of tail with eight dark brown lateral blotches flanking light brown median tail surface. Dorsal surface of limbs brown, scattered with irregular darker spots. Toes and fingers light fawn with dark brown blotches on joints. Ventral surface of throat, trunk, limbs, and tail fawn, somewhat darker on tail and posterior part of trunk than on throat.\n\nColoration in life: Description of life coloration is based on an adult male specimen (ZMMU {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"R13698\",\"term_id\":\"766774\",\"term_text\":\"R13698\"}}R13698, Yok Don, Dak Lak, Vietnam), see E–F.

Selected traits and measurements are shown in . We also examined photos of type specimens of Lygosoma vittigerum kronfanum Smith, 1922 ( ) and Leiolopisma pranensis Cochran, 1930 ( ). In general, all examined specimens correspond quite well to the description of the holotype, although certain variation was observed in number of supraoculars contacting frontal and number of superciliary scales. Coloration features appeared quite stable within L. microcercus stat. nov. ( ). No statistically significant differences in morphological characters between sexes were observed.\n\nDistribution: Distribution is shown in . This species is known with certainty from central and southern Vietnam, Cambodia, and extreme south of Laos. As we tentatively synonymize Leiolopisma pranensis Cochran, 1930 from Tenasserim with L. microcercus stat. nov., its distribution may extend further westward to northern and western Thailand north of the Isthmus of Kra; occurrence of this species in easternmost Myanmar is expected ( ).\n\nIt is likely that the records of “L. vittigera“ from Tanintharyi Division of Myanmar correspond to this species; it was recorded from the following localities: Tavoy (=Dawei, Dewei) (Annandale, 1905); Yepone, Yebyu Township, Dewei Dist., Tanintharyi Div., Myanmar (CAS 243723); and Kawthaung Township, Tanintharyi Div., Myanmar (CAS 229605). However, the taxonomic status of these populations needs to be clarified.\n\nRecords of the genus Lipinia from Thailand require further specimen examination for correct identification; members of the L. vittigera complex were recorded from all over the country, including: Phetchaburi Prov.: Kaeng Krachan NP; Prachuap Khiri Khan Prov.: Pran (=Pran Buri) (USNM 75591); Kui Buri NP; Uthai Thani Prov.: Huai Kha Khaeng WS; Chiang Mai Prov.: Doi Angka Mt. (USNM 76850); Chiang Mai (FMNH 177050); Doi Suthep-Pui NP, Mae Takhrai NP (P. Pawangkhanant, personal communication); Nakhon Ratchisma Prov.: Mueang Nakhon Ratchisma Dist. (KUH 328481); Khao Yai NP; Nan Prov.: Tambol Auan, Amphoe Pua (FMNH 270715); Loei Prov.: Phu Kradueng NP; Saraburi Prov.: Muak Lek, Chet Sao Noi NP; Sa Kaeo Prov.: Pang Sida NP; Ubon Ratchathani Prov.: Ubon (FMNH 177615) (P. Pawangkhanant, personal communication). Further studies are essential to clarify species identity of the Thai populations of the L. vittigera complex.\n\nRecords of Lipinia from Laos are poorly documented but include Xepian NBCA, Champasak Prov. (Teynié et al., 2004). In addition to the localities presented in (see Appendix I for details), existing records from Cambodia (as L. vittigera) include: Pursat Prov.: Veal Veang, Phnom Samkos WS (NCSM 80292); Kratie Prov.: Sambour, Koh Kring Island (MVZ 258369); Kampong Speu Prov.: Phnom Sruoch Dist. (FMNH 261862); Ratanakiri Prov.: Ta Veng Dist. (FMNH 262984); Koh Kong Prov., Thmar Baing Dist. (FMNH 263362); Sihanoukville Prov. (FMNH 270597) (Stuart & Emmet, 2006; Stuart et al., 2006, 2010). Hartmann et al. (2013a) also mentioned a photo record of a Lipinia specimen from northwestern Kulen Prum Tep WS (KPWS, Oddar Meanchey Province, Trapeang, Prasat District: ZFMK-PA SE 30; N14.7467°, E104.8100°, 99 m a.s.l.); based on coloration this specimen can be reliably assigned to L. microcercus.\n\nIn addition to the localities verified by genetic and morphological analyses (see and Appendix I for details), L. microcercus stat. nov. was documented as L. v. microcercus from the following localities in Vietnam: Thua Thien-Hue Prov.: A Luoi (AMNH R-154622), Hue environs; Da Nang: Hai Van mountain pass, Bach Ma NP; Quang Nam Prov.: Hien, Nam Giang, Tay Gianh, Phuoc Son, Ngoc Linh NP; Kon Tum Prov.: Ngoc Linh NP, Kon Tum; Gia Lai Prov.: Buon Luoi (FMNH 252169), K Bang: SOn Lang, Chu Se; Dak Lak Prov.: Buon Ma Thuot (MVZ 222200), Yok Don NP; Lam Dong Prov.: Lang Bian, Da Ban, Bao Loc (USNM 90386), Cat Loc; Khanh Hoa Prov.: Hon Ba NP; Binh Phuoc Prov.: Nghia Trung; Dong Nai Prov.: Cat Tien NP, Ma Da; Ba Ria - Vung Tau Prov.: Binh Chau-Phuok Buu NP; Tay Ninh NP: Lo Go-Xa Mat NP; Kien Giang Prov.: Phu Quoc NP (Bobrov & Semenov, 2008; Nguyen et al., 2009). The record of “L. vittigera” from Ha Tinh Prov. (Vu Kuang NP) by Semenov (2001) is doubtful; see Bobrov (1992, 1995) and Bobrov & Semenov (2008).\n\nNatural history: A brief description of the biology of this species in Vietnam was presented by Bobrov & Sememov (2008) and Vassilieva et al. (2016). The species was recorded from diverse types of clear forest habitats, including disturbed areas and rural and suburban landscapes in lowland, hilly, and submontane regions up to 1 200 m a.s.l. (Vassilieva et al., 2016). It is an arboreal species, which can be quite common locally. Specimens were usually observed during the day while the lizards foraged on trunks of large trees or, occasionally, on walls of wooden buildings located within the forest or at forest edges. Occasionally, specimens were observed on the ground, presumably crossing from one tree trunk to another. These lizards are active at temperatures above 20 °C, and usual hide under bark or in small tree hollows on rainy days (Bobrov & Sememov, 2008). Diet includes spiders and various small insects; in Cat Tien NP, a male specimen (ZFMK 88969) was observed catching ants on the walls of a wooden stilt hut on the forest edge at Bau Sau Lake at a height of 5 m above ground. They are occasionally observed in groups of 2–3 on the same tree trunk. Waving movements of their brightly colored reddish or bright-orange tails is a commonly observed display behavior. They are oviparous, laying 2–4 eggs per clutch; hatching is observed during the rainy season. Sexual maturity is reached at the end of the first year, shedding occurs in January (Vassilieva et al., 2016).\n\nComparisons: Comparisons are based on original descriptions or descriptions provided in broader faunal and taxonomic publications (citations in the Materials and Methods section above).\n\nMorphological comparisons between the four members of the L. vittigera species complex from mainland Southeast Asia are summarized in . Lipinia microcercus stat. nov. can be differentiated from all other members of the L. vittigera species complex by the following opposing combination of characters (see for details): L. vittigera sensu stricto (Boulenger, 1894)from Peninsular Malaysia, Mentawai Islands, Sumatra, and Borneo: 15–16 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; MDLS broad (two scales wide) from snout tip to tail; PVDS not as broad as MDLS; flanks with dark and pale spots (LDS, LLS absent or indistinct); DTM present, indistinct dark mottling or spots; Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. (herein) from southern Vietnam, Cambodia, and eastern Thailand: 20–26 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; MDLS broad (two scales wide); PVDS not as broad as MDLS, not continuing on tail; LDS only present on anterior third of trunk; DTM as narrow black stripe about as wide as DLLS; Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. (herein) from central Vietnam: 10–11 supraciliaries; 14–15 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; 19–21 subdigital lamellae under toe IV; MDLS broad (two scales wide); PVDS not as broad as MDLS; LDS and VDSL dissolving into two rows of irregular dark blotches; DTM narrow black stripe, about as wide as DLLS.\n\nIn the following, L. microcercus stat. nov. is compared with other congeners bearing a light middorsal stripe by listing their opposing character combinations: L. albodorsalis (Vogt) from New Guinea: SVL to 54 mm; 22–25 midbody scale rows; dorsum pale yellow with dark lateral stripe; L. infralineolata (Günther) from Sulawesi and Sangihi Islands: SVL to 49 mm; 22 midbody scale rows; L. leptosoma (Brown & Fehlmann) from Palau Islands: 7–10 lamellae under toe IV; L. longiceps (Boulenger) from New Guinea, Fergusson, Misima, and Trobriand Islands: 24 midbody scale rows; snout strongly elongated; dorsum light brown with two dorsolateral stripes converging on tail base; tail golden yellow; L. macrotympanum (Stoliczka) from Andaman and Nicobar Islands: 21–23 midbody scale rows; prefrontals separated; hindlimbs and forelimbs not meeting when adpressed; L. miangensis (Werner) from Pulau Miang, Kalimantan Timur, Borneo: 24 midbody scale rows; back golden with two dark brown longitudinal stripes from snout to tail; L. nitens (Peters) from Sarawak, Borneo: SVL to 33.6 mm; external ear opening replaced by scaly dimple; back metallic green with pale yellow vertebral stripe; L. noctua from South Pacific islands (allochthonous) and Indonesia: Maluku and Papua Province; Papua New Guinea, Admiralty Islands, Bismarck Islands, and Solomon Islands: dorsum brown with light vertebral stripe, starting with wide and contrasting light spot on head; dark paravertebral stripes with irregular borders, often broken into row of irregular dark blotches; L. pulchella from the Philippines: 22–26 midbody scale rows; 24–31 lamellae under toe IV; only one light whitish stripe present on dorsum, from snout to tail tip, becoming yellowish from midbody toward tail; L. pulchra (Boulenger) from New Guinea: dorsum black with five greenish light stripes; L. rabori (Brown & Alcala) from the Philippines (Negros Island): SVL to 51.0 mm in males and 54.8 mm in females; 22 midbody scale rows; L. relicta (Vinciguerra) from Indonesia: Mentawai Archipelago, SVL to 56 mm; 20 midbody scale rows; 16–18 lamellae under toe IV; tail thick; light vertebral line present and labials each bearing small white spot; lateral dark stripe present from eye to insertion of hindlimbs; L. rouxi (Hediger) from New Ireland, northeast Papua New Guinea, and Bismarck Archipelago: dorsum brown, dark paravertebral stripes, with irregular borders, often broken into row of irregular dark blotches; L. septentrionalis Günther from Indonesia (Papua Province): 24–26 midbody scale rows; one cream vertebral stripe, broadening toward tail; L. subvittata (Günther) from Sulawesi, Java, the Philippines (Mindanao Island): SVL 47–56 mm; dorsal longitudinal stripes extending to forearm region; 22 midbody scale rows; L. vulcania from the Philippines (Mindanao and Luzon Islands): 17 lamellae under toe IV; limbs not meeting when adpressed; dorsum brownish, scattered with dark brown spots; dark lateral stripe, scattered with whitish or yellowish spots.\n\nThe following congeners can be distinguished from L. microcercus by the absence of a light middorsal stripe: L. auriculata (Taylor) from the Philippines (Negros and Masbate Islands); L. cheesmanae (Parker) from New Guinea; L. inexpectata Das & Austin from Borneo and its northern offshore islands; L. nototaenia (Boulenger) from West Papua; L. occidentalis Günther from Papua Province, New Guinea; L. sekayuensis Grismer, Ismail, Awangm, Rizal & Ahmad from Peninsular Malaysia; L. semperi (Peters) from the Philippines (Mindanao and Camiguin Islands); L. surda (Boulenger) from Peninsular Malaysia; L. venemai (Brongersma) from Indonesia: Papua Province; and L. zamboangensis (Brown & Alcala) from the Philippines (Mindanao Island).\n\nRemarks: Lipinia microcercus stat. nov. was ranked as a subspecies of L. vittigera (Boulenger, 1894)by Smith(1935). However, the genetic differentiation presented in this study as well as the morphological differentiation documented herein indicate that L. microcercus has to be treated as a valid species.\n\nRemarks on type locality of Lygosoma (Leiolopisma) microcercum Boettger, 1901 : Boettger (1901) noted the type locality as “Phuc-son in Annam”. A recent literature review enabled an exact localization of this village. The type specimen belonged to a herpetological collection sent to Frankfurt by the German naturalist Hans Fruhstorfer in November and December 1899. Hans Fruhstorfer travelled through Indochina for about three years (1899–1901), visiting all provinces of the so-called Union Indochinoise (Lamas, 2005). Though mainly focused on collecting insects and molluscs, Fruhstorfer also noted in his published travelogue (Fruhstorfer, 1905) several reptiles and amphibians. In the case of the holotype specimen of Lygosoma microcercum, a concurrent reference in Fruhstorfer (1901) can be ascribed, where he mentions a remarkable lizard: “Viel Aufsehen erregte der Fang einer Eidechse mit rothem Schwanz und drei goldenen Linien über dem Rücken, wahrscheinlich Lygosoma sanctum Dum.” (p. 130) (translation: “The catch of a lizard caused a certain sensation. It had a red tail and three golden lines on its back, probably Lygosoma sanctum Dum.”). This note, the only one which can be assigned to a specimen of the genus Lipinia, belongs to an entry from 24 November 1899 in “Phuc son, Gebiet der Moi” (Fruhstorfer, 1901). Fruhstorfer entered Annam at the harbor of Tourane (today Da Nang, Quang Nam Province) on 13 November 1899 and left for a collection trip (six weeks) into the hinterland of Tourane, to “Phuc son” and “Thu-bon” on 15 November 1899. Though Fruhstorfer’s transcription of “Phuc son”, which was adopted by Boettger (1901), slightly differs from the modern “Phuoc Son”, it can be stated with certain reliability that the type locality of Lygosoma microcercum can be restricted to the modern Phuoc Son District in Quang Nam Province, Central Vietnam ( , locality 6).\n\nTaxonomic status of Lygosoma vittigerum kronfanum Smith, 1922 : Smith (1922) described the new subspecies Lygosoma vittigerum kronfanum based on six specimens collected at “Daban, Langbian plateau, S. Annam in March 1918”. However, all diagnostic characters provided by Smith (1922) are within the character range of Lygosoma microcercum Boettger, 1901: TL 93 mm; SVL 34 mm; midbody scale rows 28–32; limbs overlapping when adpressed; prefrontals in contact, forming broad median suture; five “well-defined light stripes”. The description of coloration in preservative also fits the coloration pattern of L. microcercus stat. nov., as described above: “Black above, with 5 greenish-white dorsal stripes, namely, a vertebral one from tip of the nose to the root of the tail, a dorsolateral pair from the upper eyelid to above the thigh, and a lateral pair from the upper lip to the groin” (Smith, 1922, p. 209).\n\nSmith (1935) himself then placed Lygosoma vittigerum kronfanum into synonomy of Leiolopisma vittigerum microcercum (Boettger, 1901), referring to a personal comment of Robert Mertens (unpublished), the successor of Oskar Boettger in SMF in Frankfurt: “Dr. Mertens has compared my kronfanum with the type of microcercum, and has confirmed my suspicion that the two are identical” (Smith, 1935, p. 308). At least one paratype of L. vittigerum kronfanum is still present in today’s FMNH collection. The handwritten labels indicate that FMNH 196010 (see ) is one of four paratypes (collection numbers: 2453–2456) present in the private collection of Smith). The fate of the holotype (Smith’s private collection number 2417) and other paratypes remains unknown. Das (2010) erroneously listed L. v. kronfanum as a valid subspecies. Based on morphological accordance, we follow Smith (1935) in recognizing L. v. kronfanum as a junior synonym of L. microcercus (Boettger, 1901) stat. nov.\n\nTaxonomic status of Leiolopisma pranensis Cochran, 1930 : Cochran (1930) described Leiolopisma pranensis from Siam (now Thailand) based on two specimens, including the holotype USNM 75591 from Pran (now Pran Buri, Prachuap Khiri Khan Prov.) and paratype USNM 76850 from Doi Angka Mt. (Chiang Mai Prov.). Soon after, Smith (1935) synonymized this taxon with Leiolopisma vittigerum vittigerum, although without any justification for this decision. This opinion was later accepted by subsequent researchers (see Taylor, 1963, p. 1029).\n\nWe examined photos of the holotype ( ) of Leiolopisma pranensis Cochran, 1930, and we doubt that this taxon is close to L. vittigera sensu stricto. In general, external morphology of the holotype USNM 75591 agrees well with L. microcercus stat. nov. (see for comparison): SVL 38.0; TaL/SVL ratio 1.26; TrunkL/SVL ratio 0.53; SL/SVL ratio 0.12; STL/SVL ratio 0.24; SFIL/SVL ratio 0.37; FLL/SVL ratio 0.29; HLL/SVL ratio 0.39; frontonasal wider than long; prefrontals in contact (see D); frontal contacting 1+2 supraoculars; frontoparietals contacting 2+3+4 supraoculars; supraciliaries 7–8; MSR 30; MDSR 54; ventrals 56. In coloration ( ), the holotype of Leiolopisma pranensis is also similar to L. microcercus stat. nov. with narrow MDLS (one scale wide), PDS slightly wider than MDLS, not continuing on tail (although coloration on tail is possibly faded as the specimen appears slightly bleached); DLLS distinct with regular borders, one scale wide.\n\nHowever, the holotype of Leiolopisma pranensis shows some differences when compared with the holotype of L. microcercus stat. nov.: 14 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; 21 subdigital lamellae under toe IV; fifth supralabial not contacting orbit ( C); LDS dissolving into row of irregular dark blotches, not reaching groin; VLDS only present as narrow row of irregular small spots. Unfortunately, our phylogenetic analysis lacked samples from western Thailand, including the vicinity of the Leiolopisma pranensis type locality, so the taxonomic value of these differences is not clear and requires further study. Nevertheless, the available information indicates that Leiolopisma pranensis is notably different from L. vittigera sensu stricto and more closely resembles L. microcercus stat. nov. Further molecular and morphological data on Lipinia populations from western Thailand are needed for future research. We herein propose to place Leiolopisma pranensis Cochran, 1930 into tentative synonomy of L. microcercus (Boettger, 1901) stat. nov.\n\nLipinia trivittata sp. nov.\n\nFigures 6A-D, 7G-H, 14; Tables 1, 2.\n\nChresonymy\n\nLygosoma vittigerum kronfanum (partim) — Smith, 1922, p. 209 (tentative chresonymy; see taxonomic comment below);\n\nLipinia vittigera (partim) — Mahony, 2008, p. 239(?); Grismer et al., 2011, p. 62(?); Vassilieva et al., 2016, p. 167.\n\nHolotype: ZMMU R13920-58, adult female ( ), collected by Eduard A. Galoyan from a tree trunk in a pine forest in Chu Yang Sin NP, Dak Lak Province, Vietnam (N12.40611°, E108.35361°; 950 m a.s.l.) on 30 March 2013.\n\nParatypes: ZMMU R13920-55–57, three adult males with same collection information as holotype; ZMMU {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"R13449\",\"term_id\":\"766525\",\"term_text\":\"R13449\"}}R13449, adult male collected by Nikolay A. Poyarkov on the edge of a forest road in Dac Ca River valley, Bu Gia Map NP, Binh Phuok Province, Vietnam (N12.1931°, E107.2121°; 545 m a.s.l.) on 16 April 2009; ZMMU R13934-112, adult male, and ZMMU R13934-101, juvenile, collected by Eduard A.

Hartmann from Kulen Prum Tep WS, Preah Vihear Province, Kulen District (N13.8851°, E104.8820°; 70 m a.s.l.) on 10 July 2009.\n\nDiagnosis: Small (SVL up to 44.4 mm) species of Lipinia, differentiated from congeners by the following combination of external morphological traits: external ear opening present; lower eyelid bearing large transparent spectacle; 28–32 midbody scale rows; 48–58 middorsal scales between parietals and point above vent; 20–26 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; 29–33 lamellae under toe IV; prefrontals in broad contact; seven supralabials, seven infralabials; middorsal light stripe from snout tip to tail base; two paravertebral dark stripes, continuing on anterior part of tail; two dorsolateral light stripes, distinct on head and anterior third of trunk; narrow lateral dark stripe from loreals to anterior half of trunk.\n\nEtymology: The species epithet is an adjective in nominative singular (feminine gender) derived from the Latin “tri-” for three and “vitta” for a head band (see above), referring to its prominent three stripes (one light middorsal stripe and two dark paravertebral stripes) in dorsal view.\n\nDescription of holotype: Measurements and counts of holotype are presented in detail in . Adult female, SVL 44.4 mm (see ), TL 59.3 mm.\n\nSnout acute, SL 4.2 mm; nostrils oriented laterally, oval, situated closer to snout tip than to orbit, END 2.5 mm; head long, almost twice as long as wide, HL 9.2 mm, HW 5.3 mm, HL/HW ratio 1.74, flattened, HH 3.7 mm, HL/HH ratio 2.5; rostral broad, visible in dorsal view, posterior border of rostral waved, contact zone with nasals slightly emarginated; frontonasal wider than long; frontal elongated, arrow-shaped, wider anteriorly; prefrontals large, in broad contact medially ( H), surrounded by loreals, enlarged presupraocular, frontal, first supraoculars (punctiform contact) and frontonasal; two frontoparietals in broad median contact; interparietal arrow-shaped, wider anteriorly; parietals in contact behind interparietal, surrounded by postsupraoculars, nuchals, interparietal, and frontoparietals; six nuchals; four supraoculars; one enlarged presupraocular, visible from above; nine/eight supraciliaries; nostrils located within nasals; postnasal absent; two loreals, slightly elongated, second longer than first; two enlarged presuboculars, separating supralabial III and IV from orbit; seven supralabials, supralabial V largest, in contact with orbit; three postsuboculars, separating supralabial VI from orbit; six postsupraoculars (pretemporals); one primary temporal; two secondary temporals, dorsal largest; two postsupralabials; lower eyelid bearing large transparent spectacle; scales on upper row of lower eyelid small, 10 in number; mental wider than long; one postmental, in contact with first infralabial and anterior portion of second infralabial; seven infralabials; three pairs of chinshields, first pair in contact medially, second pair separated by one scale, third pair separated by three scales; External ear opening visible and subcircular ( G).\n\nBody slender ( A–B), TrunkL 22.4 mm; head slightly distinct from neck and body; 56 middorsal scales from parietal to point above vent, scales in four median longitudinal rows enlarged; ventrals in 66 rows, counted from first postgular to preanal scales; body scales smooth, subcycloid; 28 scales around midbody; four slightly enlarged preanals; Tail relatively long, TaL/SVL ratio 1.33, tip rounded; tail gradually tapering to point; median row of subcaudals enlarged; Limbs slender, pentadactyl, and clawed; forelimb and hindlimb meeting when adpressed; Subdigital lamellae under finger IV: 24 ( F); subdigital lamellae under toe IV: 32/33 ( G); all subdigital lamellae enlarged.\n\nColoration in preservative: MDLS whitish, from head to tail base, widening at point above vent and continuing on dorsal surface of tail. MDLS on midbody about two scale rows wide, covering both paravertebral scale rows. Two black PVDS from snout to tail base, about two scales wide, narrowing on tail base, running into thin brown stripe within anterior fourth of tail. Two fawn DLLS, starting on supraoculars, running down to point above forelimb insertion, merging with brownish flank on anterior part of trunk. LDS starting at nostrils, running out into diffuse stripe on anterior third of trunk. LLS and VLDS absent. DTM as narrow black stripe ca. same width as DLLS above, running from posterior margin of eye to temporal region and further posteriorly on body flanks, joining with LDS ( E). Labials, gular region, and flanks cream, scattered with brown pigmentation, darker on head, becoming lighter on flanks. Dorsal surface of tail whitish, lateral surface light brown. Dorsal surface of limbs light brown, scattered with irregular darker spots on hands and feet. Toes and fingers light fawn with dark brown blotches on joints. Ventral surface of throat, trunk, limbs, and tail white.

DTM as narrow dark brown stripe running from posterior corner of eye posteriorly ( B).\n\nVariation: For variation of traits in paratypes see . In general, members of the type series well agree with the description of the holotype. Certain variation was observed in prefrontal positions, which are broadly contacting with each other in most specimens, but slightly touching each other in ZMMU R-13934-101 and ZMMU R-13920-57 and are not in contact in ZMMU R-13934-112. Paratype ZMMU {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"R13449\",\"term_id\":\"766525\",\"term_text\":\"R13449\"}}R13449 has MDLS wider than PVDS and brighter orange coloration of tail, becoming light orange toward sacrum ( C). Paratype ZFMK 90419 shows a brighter coloration of light dorsal stripes, with dorsal tail surface being intensely orange. A specimen from Khao Soi Dao NP, Thailand ( D, not collected) shows a very similar coloration pattern, with even brighter orange-reddish coloration of tail and MDLS; based on this photo record, we assume that this specimen belongs to Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. We did not reveal any sexually dimorphic characters in this species.\n\nDistribution: Distribution of the new species is presented in . Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. is reliably reported from hilly and mountainous areas of southern Vietnam–Langbian Plateau and its foothills (Dak Lak, Lam Dong and Binh Phuok Provinces), as well as from the Bay Nui Hills in southern Vietnam (An Giang Province) and northern Cambodia: Kulen Prum Tep NP (Preah Vihear Province). Sequences of a tissue sample from a non-collected specimen originating from Phu Quoc Island of Vietnam confirm the presence of Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. on the island ( , locality 24). A photo record of Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. from Khao Soi Dao NP in Chanthaburi Province of eastern Thailand ( D) indicates that the range of the species is likely wider than currently known and possibly extends to the Cambodian part of the Cardamoms. Further studies are required to clarify the distribution of the new species.\n\nNatural history: Forest arboreal species, occurring throughout primary and old secondary montane and hill dipterocarp forests to disturbed forests, bamboo groves, and pine montane forests, known from elevations of 300 to 1 100 m a.s.l. In the type locality (Chu Yang Sin NP, Dak Lak Province, Vietnam), the new species was observed in montane pine forests dominated by Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gordon; and observed in the day climbing on logs or trunks of large trees while foraging for small insects (mostly ants). In Bu Gia Map NP, Binh Phuok Province, a specimen of the new species was collected on the ground while it was crossing a road in a bamboo grove at midday. In Cambodia, the female paratype was collected from the southeastern part of KPWS while it was actively foraging on a fallen tree trunk at midday in a disturbed semi-evergreen forest at 70 m a.s.l.; this locality is located ~60 km from the L. microcercus record in KPWS. Gravid females were not recorded. Juveniles were observed in May–June. Clutch size is unknown.\n\nComparisons: Comparisons are based on the original descriptions or descriptions provided in broader faunal and taxonomic publications (citations in the Materials and Methods section above). For distribution notes of each of the compared congeners, see the comparison section within the L. microcercus account above as well as .\n\nMorphological comparisons between the four members of the L. vittigera species complex from mainland Southeast Asia are summarized in . In general, Lipinia trivittata sp. nov.resembles the other members of the Southeast Asian L. vittigera complex. However, the new species can be differentiated based on the following opposing combination of characters (see for details): L. vittigera sensu stricto (Boulenger, 1894): 15–16 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; flanks with dark and pale spots; LDS absent or indistinct; Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. (herein): 10–11 supraciliaries; 14–15 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; 19–21 subdigital lamellae under toe IV; LDS and VDSL dissolving into two rows of irregular dark blotches; L. microcercus (Boettger, 1901) stat. nov.: MDLS narrow (one scale wide at midbody), PVDS continuing on tail; distinct LDS present from temporal region to anterior parts of tail.\n\nLipinia trivittata sp. nov.can be compared with other congeners bearing a middorsal light stipe by their opposing character combinations: L. albodorsalis: SVL up to 54 mm; 22–25 midbody scale rows; dorsum pale yellow with a dark lateral stripe; L. infralineolata (Günther): SVL to 49 mm; 22 midbody scale rows; L. leptosoma: 7–10 lamellae under toe IV; L. longiceps: 24 midbody scale rows; snout elongated; back light brown with two dorsolateral stripes converging on tail base; tail golden yellow; L. macrotympanum: 21–23 midbody scale rows; prefrontals separated; hindlimbs and forelimbs not meeting when adpressed; L. miangensis: 24 midbody scale rows; back golden with two dark brown longitudinal stripes from snout to tail; dark line from eye to insertion of forelimb; L. nitens: SVL to 33.6 mm; external ear opening replaced by scaly dimple; back metallic green with pale yellow vertebral stripe; L. noctua: dorsum brown with light vertebral stripe, starting with wide and contrasting light spot on head; dark paravertebral stripes with irregular borders, often broken into row of irregular dark blotches; L. pulchella: 22–26 midbody scale rows; and 24–31 lamellae under toe IV; only one light whitish stripe present on dorsum, from snout to tail tip, becoming yellowish from midbody toward tail; L. pulchra: dorsum black with five greenish light stripes; L. rabori: SVL to 51.0 mm in males and 54.8 mm in females; 22 midbody scale rows; L. relicta: SVL to 56 mm; 20 midbody scale rows; 16–18 lamellae under toe IV; tail thick; light vertebral line present and labials each bearing small white spot; lateral dark stripe present from eye to insertion of hindlimbs; L. rouxi: dorsum brown, dark paravertebral stripes, with irregular borders, often broken into row of irregular dark blotches; L. septentrionalis: 24–26 midbody scale rows; light middorsal stripe as well as brown paravertebral stripes each bearing narrow black contour; L. subvittata: SVL 47–56 mm; dorsal longitudinal stripes extending to forearm region; 22 midbody scale rows; L. vulcania: 17 lamellae under toe IV; limbs not meeting when adpressed; dorsum brownish, scattered with dark brown spots; dark lateral stripe, scattered with whitish or yellowish spots.\n\nRemaining congeners can be distinguished from Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. by absence of light middorsal stripe: L. auriculata; L. cheesmanae; L. inexpectata; L. nototaenia; L. occidentalis; L. sekayuensis; L. semperi; L. surda; L. venemai; and L. zamboangensis.\n\nRemarks: In his description of Lygosoma vittigerum kronfanum, Smith (1922) reported on geographic variation in number of stripes on dorsum in Indochinese Lipinia: in addition to the typical form (L. vittigera sensu stricto from Sumatra and Malayan Peninsula) with one distinct vertebral stripe on dorsum and Indochinese form (now treated as L. microcercus stat. nov.) with five stripes on dorsum, he reported a juvenile specimen from northern Siam (now Thailand) with three dorsal light stripes and stated that further sampling may show this three-striped form to be taxonomically distinct. We were unable to locate and examine this specimen; however, we assume that it may possibly represent the first discovery of Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. Some records of L. vittigera from Cambodia (Grismer et al., 2011:62; Mahony, 2008, p. 239) and southern Vietnam (Vassilieva et al., 2016, p. 167) may also correspond to this species, though this requires further confirmation.\n\nLipinia vassilievi sp. nov.\n\nE–F; I–J; ; Tables 1, 2.\n\nHolotype: ZMMU {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"R14604\",\"term_id\":\"768772\",\"term_text\":\"R14604\"}}R14604, adult male ( ), collected by Dimitry F.

The type locality of Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. is located in Chu Mom Ray NP in Kon Tum Province of Vietnam, a southern outcrop of the Central (or Kon Tum) Plateau of the central Annamites (=Truong Son mountains). Sequences of tissue samples from two non-collected specimens (tail tips) originating from Virachey NP, Ratanakiri Province in eastern Cambodia, confirm the presence of Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. in the country ( , locality 19); the Cambodian locality is situated about 50 km SW from the type locality. It is likely that the new species has a wider distribution extending to other areas of the Central Plateau foothills in central Vietnam, northern Cambodia, and, possibly, southern Laos (Champasak and Attapeu Provinces). Further research is needed to clarify the distribution range of Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov.\n\nNatural history: The holotype was collected under bark of a large tree close to a stream in a mixed montane polydominant forest at an elevation of 810 m a.s.l. Specimens from Virachey NP in Ratanakiri Province of Cambodia were recorded on the ground crossing a road.\n\nComparisons: The only specimen of Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. we were able to examine morphologically was the holotype; the two other samples of this species from Ratanakiri Province of Cambodia included in the phylogenetic analyses were tissue samples (tail tips), the respective voucher specimens were not collected. Comparisons are based on original descriptions or descriptions provided in broader faunal and taxonomic publications (citations in the Materials and Methods section above). For distribution notes of each of the compared congeners, see the comparison section within the L. microcercus stat. nov. account above as well as .\n\nMorphological comparisons between the four members of the L. vittigera species complex from mainland Southeast Asia are summarized in . The members can be differentiated by the following opposing combination of traits: L. vittigera sensu stricto (Boulenger, 1894): PVDS with straight margins on both sides; flanks with dark and pale spots (LDS, LLS absent or indistinct); Lipinia trivittata sp. nov.: 20–26 subdigital lamellae under finger IV; PVDS with straight margins on both sides, not continuing on tail; LDS only present on anterior third of trunk; L. microcercus (Boettger, 1901) stat. nov.: MDLS narrow (one scale wide at midbody), PVDS with straight margins on both sides, continuing on tail; LDS continuous, present from temporal region to anterior parts of tail.\n\nFurther, those congeners bearing a middorsal light stripe can be distinguished from Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. by the following opposing traits: L. albodorsalis: SVL to 54 mm; 22–25 midbody scale rows; dorsum pale yellow with dark lateral stripe; L. infralineolata: SVL to 49 mm; 22 midbody scale rows; L. leptosoma: 7–10 lamellae under toe IV; L. longiceps: 24 midbody scale rows; snout strongly elongated; dorsum light brown with two dorsolateral stripes converging on tail base; tail golden yellow; L. macrotympanum: 21–23 midbody scale rows; prefrontals separated; hindlimbs and forelimbs not meeting when adpressed; L. miangensis: 24 midbody scale rows; back golden with two dark brown longitudinal stripes from snout to tail; L. nitens: SVL to 33.6 mm; external ear opening replaced by scaly dimple; back metallic green with pale yellow vertebral stripe; L. noctua: dorsum brown with light vertebral stripe, starting with wide and contrasting light spot on head; dark paravertebral stripes with irregular borders, often broken into row of irregular dark blotches; L. pulchella: 22–26 midbody scale rows; 24–31 lamellae under toe IV; only one light whitish stripe present on dorsum, from snout to tail tip, becoming yellowish from midbody toward tail; L. pulchra: dorsum black with five greenish light stripes; L. rabori: SVL to 51.0 mm in males and 54.8 mm in females; 22 midbody scale rows; L. relicta: SVL to 56 mm; 20 midbody scale rows; tail thick; light vertebral line present and labials each bearing small white spot; lateral dark stripe present from eye to insertion of hindlimbs; L. rouxi: dorsum brown, dark paravertebral stripes, with irregular borders, often broken into row of irregular dark blotches; L. septentrionalis: 24–26 midbody scale rows; one cream vertebral stripe, broadening toward tail; L. subvittata: SVL to 56 mm; dorsal longitudinal stripes extending to forearm region; 22 midbody scale rows; L. vulcania from the Philippines (Mindanao and Luzon Islands): 17 lamellae under toe IV; limbs not meeting when adpressed; dorsum brownish, scattered with dark brown spots; dark lateral stripe, scattered with whitish or yellowish spots.\n\nThe remaining congeners can be distinguished from Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. by absence of light middorsal stripe: L. auriculata; L. cheesmanae; L. inexpectata; L. miotis; L. nototaenia; L. occidentalis; L. sekayuensis; L. semperi; L. surda; L. venemai; and L. zamboangensis."
