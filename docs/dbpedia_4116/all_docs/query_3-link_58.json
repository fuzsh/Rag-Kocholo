Primary source material chronicles not only the history of the MFAH, but also the artistic and cultural development of Houston. Material is also maintained from prominent artists, collectors, and figures such as the Art Guys, Manfred Heiting, Ima Hogg, and Sally Walsh.\n\nThe institutional records of the MFAH date from 1900, when the museum was founded, and include correspondence, schedules, subject files, program files, ephemera, and exhibition files. Generally, files are available for public research after 15 years, though access to some materials may be limited."
