        "text": "INTRODUCTION Relevance of the study. From the very beginning, the art museum as a social and cultural institution was perceived in terms of dominant ideological and philosophical paradigms of a specific historical and cultural era. The rethinking the art museum regarding its social role and purpose was determined by the external intellectual and political environment, according to dominant ideological and philosophical discourse. Now, in the absence of unified narrative about art museums, they determine the rhetoric of their own presentation “urbi et orbi”. This task became particularly important in the context of a globalizing market for museum services. In addition, in recent decades, art museums have competed with “themselves”, making their collections widely available due to their electronic versions. This put art museums in a fundamentally new situation, when it became impossible to rely only on the traditional motivation for visiting museum. The classical functions, such as collecting, storing, and exhibiting are not sufficient to ensure competitiveness and maintain social interest. This is especially important for those museums that fully or largely fund their budget with their own efforts. The dramatic changes in the cultural situation in which art museums find themselves now find theoretical comprehension in the works of museological theorists, museum specialists and representatives of other fields of activity related to museum practices. Thus, in 2010, a book by the American museologist N. Simon was published, in which the concept of “participatory museum” was used. The narrative of Participatory Museum was based on the analogy with communication that is typical for social networks. Unlike authors who focused on virtual communication of museums, such as J.T. Grabill, S. Pigg and K. Wittenauer, N. Simon included live communication in the concept of Participatory Museum, citing several modern examples in her book. The new phrase quickly came into museum discourse, and its conceptual content began to be actively developed by museologists. The results of such developments are published in the multi-authored monographs of American researchers “Participatory Culture: Museum as a Forum for Dialogue and Collaboration” and Russian authors “Museum as a Forum for Education: Game, Dialogue, Participatory Culture”. Another aspect of modern museum discourse was articulated by Denis Belkevich in the publication “Museum in Search of an Audience”. Analyzing the museum practices of leading art museums, he introduces the concept of edutainment: “education as pleasure”. This conclusion was made by the author based on the analysis of data from marketing research conducted concerning the motivation of art museum visitors. The cultural practices of European and American art museums with children's and teenage audiences, including in terms of their verbal presentation, were covered in articles by O. M. Goncharova. According to John H. Falk, Lynn D. Dierking and Marianna Adams, authors of the section “Living in a Learning Society: Museums and Free-choice Learning” in the book “A Companion to Museum Studies”, although constructivist learning ideas have been spreading in academic community for quite a long time, the behaviorist learning model continues to flourish in museums... Many museums, consciously or unconsciously, work properly, adjusting the lighting and creating the right labels, but some of them exhibit museum objects “with no strings attached”... However, the constructivist model understands learning as a contextual process. Prior knowledge, experience, interests and all motives consist of a personal context that is embedded in a complex of social and cultural and physical context ... in time and space. More typical is education of visitors in two parallel ways: (a) through study of global ideas; (b) study of specific, but usually idiosyncratic facts and concepts ... Recent research (Falk and Storksdieck 2005) helped to demonstrate how complex learning processes and results are in museums. One of the most recent publications – article by museologists Jessica J. Luke, Susan M. Letourneau, Nicole R. Rivera, Lisa Brahms and Sarah May – is devoted to the application of game practices in museum work with children, but specialized children's museums were the subject of their research. As Eilean Hooper-Greenhill writes in the study “Changing Values in the Art Museums: Rethinking Communication and Learning”, the development of new narrative in art museums requires new ways of thinking about collections and audiences, new ways of their integration based on a combination of knowledge, power, identity and language. According to T. Kubasova, the interactive expositions allowing visitors to involve all their senses in the process of cognition have become more and more popular in recent years. The museums overcome the barrier of “inaccessibility”, become closer and clearer. The informal learning through emotional involvement relieves stress before solving complex tasks, and the joy of victory encourages new achievements –– museum becomes a new space of education. Despite these and other publications devoted to study of museum sphere, specifics of modern cultural situation in which art museums work, the issue of rhetoric of art museum presentation and self-presentation that is formed in the social and cultural discourse and evolves with its paradigm changes remains unaddressed. Purpose of monograph section: to investigate changes in rethinking the art museum as an object of social and cultural discourse of modern era and to identify features of rhetoric of art museum as a subject of social and cultural discourse in modern globalized culture. Research methodology. To achieve this goal, a range of historical and cultural, social and philosophical methods based on a systematic approach was used. Scientific novelty. The historical and cultural analysis of changes in rethinking the art museum as an object of social and cultural dimension from the Age of Enlightenment to the rhetoric of art museum as a subject of social and cultural dimension in modern globalized culture. The evolution of art museum rhetoric from the articulation of its perception as educational institution and “temple of art” to the articulation of self-presentation as cultural space and social communication platform is determined. The art museums are moving to organization of museum communication based on social network design, which provides feedback to visitors and allows them to share their thoughts and impressions, providing the museum with the role of permanent newsmaker and platform where participants create the discourse inspired by visit to the museum. Conclusion. During the study period, the rethinking the art museum presentation as an institute of education and “temple of arts” changed to the rhetoric of self-presentation as a locus of the cultural space in which modern person meets the needs for self-realization, as well as social and cultural communication. Key words: art museum, rethinking, rhetoric, social and cultural dimension, social mission of art museum, museum communication. For citation: Goncharova O. M.
