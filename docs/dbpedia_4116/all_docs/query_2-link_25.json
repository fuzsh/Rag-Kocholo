        "text": "St Mary's CE Primary School in Amersham has celebrated its 150th anniversary.\n\nThe milestone was celebrated with a recreation of the parade, church service and tea party held to mark its opening in 1873.\n\nThe day began with headteacher, Julie Hills, ringing the newly refurbished school bell before staff, pupils, governors and school alumni – all dressed in Victorian fancy dress - paraded to St Mary's church in Old Amersham for a service of thanksgiving.\n\nThe procession was led by a banner - celebrating the school's vision of Courage, Respect and Opportunity - created by one of our parents, Mrs Williams, and included a leaf made by each of our children. The banner was held on a bespoke wooden frame crafted by Mr Latchford of Amersham's Men's Shed.\n\nDuring the service the children shared stories of their recent studies of Amersham's history which has been made possible by the support of Amersham Museum; recent alumni visits including by a member of the Thames Valley Police Mounted Section; and ceremoniously filling a time capsule with modern day memories to be buried on the school grounds.\n\nHeadteacher, Julie Hills said: \"We wanted to create a day to remember for all our children as well as marking this significant moment in Amersham's history. Seeing the whole school parading through Old Amersham dressed in Victorian clothes was very special.\""
