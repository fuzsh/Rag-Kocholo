        "text": "Tucked away in the south-east corner of Buckinghamshire, around eight miles from High Wycombe, lies Amersham – an ancient village on the London commuter belt.\n\nIts history dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, when it was known as Agmodesham. The Domesday Book records it as Elmodesham, meaning Ealhmund’s village.\n\nSixteenth-century poet and local historian John Leland called Amersham “a right pretty market town, well built with timber” – but this pretty hamlet has a dark history of horrific executions.\n\nREAD MORE: The Denham Massacre - one of Buckinghamshire's grizzliest crimes\n\nAmersham was once a hotbed of Lollardy, a proto-Protestant movement which criticised corruption and excess in the Catholic church, arguing that the Bible should be available in English for anyone to read.\n\nLollards railed against the worship of saints and veneration of icons, against expensive gold-plated decorations and against the practice of chantries, in which the wealthy paid priests to pray for them and their ancestors.\n\nThey also argued against transubstantiation, the belief that bread and wine consumed during Holy Communion literally become the body and blood of Christ.\n\nIn 1506 William Smith, the Bishop of Lincoln, sent investigators to root out the Lollards. Around 60 village residents were convicted of heresy, with each assigned a very public, humiliating and sometimes painful punishment.\n\nSome Lollards were made to wear a heretic’s badge while others were forced to walk around the market each week with a bundle of sticks on their shoulders, both sentences marking them out to their neighbours as troublemakers.\n\nA few heretics were branded on the cheek with a red hot iron, while others were imprisoned – one, named Thomas Chase, was tortured and died in prison three years later. Still more were ordered to go on a pilgrimage to Lincoln, around 120 miles away.\n\nBut a few were sentenced to death in the cruellest way. William Tylsworth was burned at the stake, on a hill high above the town. And in a particularly sadistic twist, his daughter Joan Clerk was made to light the fire which killed him.\n\nAs persecution of the Amersham Lollards continued, a sympathiser from Newbury in Berkshire helped several escape to East Anglia. But this ally, Thomas Man, was eventually arrested for assisting the heretics – he too was burned at the stake, in 1518.\n\nIn 1521 the new Bishop of Lincoln, John Longland, sought out survivors of the 1506 inquisition to see if they had kept their promises to renounce Lollardy.\n\nOne Amersham suspect, Thomas Holmes, gave up 60 of his fellow townspeople to save his own life.\n\nSix men and women sentenced to death\n\nA total of 200, about a quarter of the town’s population, were implicated in the heresy and six were sentenced to death – including the traitor Holmes.\n\nHe and Thomas Barnard, James Morden, Joan Norman, Robert Rave and John Scrivener were all subsequently burned at the stake, with Scrivener’s relatives forced to light his execution pyre.\n\nBishop Longland himself attended the executions and preached a sermon against reading the Bible in English, as the flames consumed their victims.\n\nThe last Amersham martyr\n\nThe last Amersham martyr was Thomas Harding. Originally tried in 1511, he promised to renounce his Lollard beliefs. In 1521 he was tried again and sentenced to wear a heretic’s badge.\n\nIn 1532 he was convicted of possessing Bibles written in English and was burned to death at Chesham, just a few miles from Amersham.\n\nJust two years later, Henry VIII broke with Rome and established the Church of England, to secure a divorce from his wife Catherine of Aragon.\n\nProtestantism was now the nation’s official religion and in 1539 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, decreed that every church should have a copy of the Bible in English – Lollard-friendly reforms which came too late for the Amersham martyrs.\n\nIn 1931 the Protestant Alliance erected a monument to these unfortunates at the hill on which they were burned to death.\n\n“They died for the principles of religious liberty,” it reads, “for the right to read and interpret the Holy Scriptures and to worship God according to their consciences.”\n\nTheir memory is preserved at Amersham Museum, which has large displays about the martyrs and puts on community plays depicting their lives and deaths.\n\nVisit its website to learn more, and for details of how and when you can visit."
