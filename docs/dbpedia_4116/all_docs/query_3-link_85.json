What do I need to do?\n\nCan I come to the Museum to do my own research?\n\n1. Can you help me find a particular quotation I saw at the Museum?\n\nThe Bible\n\nWhat have you done? Hark, thy brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground!\n\n–Genesis 4:10\n\nOnly guard yourself and guard your soul carefully, lest you forget the things your eyes saw, and lest these things depart your heart all the days of your life, and you shall make them known to your children, and to your children’s children.\n\n–Deuteronomy 4:9\n\nI call heaven and earth to witness this day: I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life—that you and your offspring shall live.\n\n–Deuteronomy 30:19\n\nYou are my witnesses.\n\n–Isaiah 43:10\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush\n\nHere we will learn that each of us bears responsibility for our actions and for our failure to act. Here we will learn that we must intervene when we see evil arise. Here we will learn more about the moral compass by which we navigate our lives and by which countries will navigate the future.\n\n–George H. W. Bush, 41st president of the United States, February 15, 1991\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nOut of our memory...of the Holocaust we must forge an unshakable oath with all civilized people that never again will the world stand silent, never again will the world...fail to act in time to prevent this terrible crime of genocide....we must harness the outrage of our own memories to stamp out oppression wherever it exists. We must understand that human rights and human dignity are indivisible.\n\n–Jimmy Carter, 39th president of the United States, at the presentation of the report of the President’s Commission on the Holocaust, September 27, 1979\n\nWilliam J. Clinton\n\nThis museum will touch the life of everyone who enters and leave everyone forever changed—a place of deep sadness and a sanctuary of bright hope; an ally of education against ignorance, of humility against arrogance, an investment in a secure future against whatever insanity lurks ahead. If this museum can mobilize morality, then those who have perished will thereby gain a measure of immortality.\n\n–William J. Clinton, 42nd president of the United States, at the dedication of the Museum, April 22, 1993\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nA desire for knowledge for its own sake, a love of justice that borders on fanaticism, and a striving for personal independence—these are aspects of the Jewish people’s tradition that allow me to regard my belonging to it as a gift of great fortune.\n\nThose who today rage against the ideals of reason and individual freedom and who seek by means of brutal force to bring about a vapid state-slavery are justified in perceiving us as their implacable enemies. History has imposed on us a difficult struggle; but so long as we remain devoted servants of truth, justice, and freedom, we will not only persist as the oldest of living peoples, but will also continue as before to achieve, through productive labor, works that contribute to the ennoblement of humanity.\n\n–Albert Einstein, from a translation by David Luebke of a passage from Albert Einstein’s Mein Weltbild (Amsterdam: Qerido Verlag, 1934), p. 133\n\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nThe things I saw beggar description...The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were...overpowering...I made the visit deliberately in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to “propaganda.”\n\n–General Dwight D. Eisenhower, in a cable message to General George C. Marshall on April 15, 1945\n\nHermann Göring\n\nI herewith commission you to carry out all preparations with regard to...a total solution of the Jewish question in those territories of Europe which are under German influence...I furthermore charge you to submit to me as soon as possible a draft showing the...measures already taken for the execution of the intended final solution of the Jewish question.\n\n–Hermann Göring, in a directive to Reinhard Heydrich dated July 31, 1941, as quoted in William L. Shirer’s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1960), p. 964\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\nThe great mass of the people...will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one.\n\n–Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf\n\nToday I will once more be a prophet: if the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevizing of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!\n\n–Translation from J. Noakes and G. Pridham, Nazism 1919–1945, Volume 3 (Exeter: University of Exeter, 1988), p. 1049\n\nI have issued the command—and I’ll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by firing squad—that our war aim does not consist of reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness—for the present only in the East—with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space (Lebensraum) which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?\n\n–Adolf Hitler, Obersalzberg, August 22, 1939, speech delivered by Hitler to the Supreme Commanders and Commanding Generals; as stated by Former Bureau Chief of the Associated Press in Berlin, Louis Lochner, in his book What About Germany? (New York: Dodd, Mead, & Company, 1942), p. 2. This particular language does not appear in any of the other primary source accounts of Hitler’s speech.\n\nAbba Kovner\n\nJanuary 1, 1942: Before our eyes they took away our parents, our brothers and sisters....\n\nOf those taken out through the gates of the Ghetto not a single one has returned....\n\nYou who hesitate, cast aside all illusions. Your children, your wives and husbands are no longer alive....\n\nHitler plans to destroy all the Jews of Europe, and the Jews of Lithuania have been chosen as the first in line. We will not be led like sheep to the slaughter! True, we are weak and defenseless, but the only reply to the murderer is revolt! Brothers! Better to fall as free fighters than to live by the mercy of the murderers. Resist! Resist with your last breath!\n\n–Abba Kovner, “A First Attempt to Tell,” in The Holocaust as Historical Experience, edited by Yehuda Bauer and Nathan Rotenstreich (New York: Holmes & Meier Publishers, 1981), p. 81.\n\nPrimo Levi\n\nMy number is 174517; we have been baptized, we will carry the tattoo on our left arm until we die.\n\n–Primo Levi, Survival in Auschwitz (New York: Summit Books, 1986), p. 27.\n\nPastor Martin Niemöller\n\nFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.\n\n–Attributed to Pastor Martin Niemöller, as stated in Franklin H. Littell’s foreword to Exile in the Fatherland: Martin Niemöller’s Letters from Moabit Prison, edited by Hubert G. Locke (Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdman’s Publishing Company, 1986), p. viii\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nWe who did not go their way owe them this. We must make sure that their deaths have posthumous meaning. We must make sure that from now until the end of days all humankind stares this evil in the face...and only then can we be sure it will never arise again.\n\n–Ronald Reagan, 40th president of the United States, at the cornerstone-laying ceremony for the Museum, October 5, 1988\n\nHannah Senesh\n\nBlessed is the match consumed in kindling flame. Blessed is the flame that burns in the secret fastness of the heart. Blessed is the heart with strength to stop its beating for honour’s sake. Blessed is the match consumed in kindling flame.\n\n–Hannah Senesh (1921–1944), Sardice, Yugoslavia, May 2, 1944\n\nMoses Schulstein\n\nWe are the shoes, we are the last witnesses. We are shoes from grandchildren and grandfathers, From Prague, Paris, and Amsterdam, And because we are only made of fabric and leather And not of blood and flesh, each one of us avoided the hellfire.\n\n–From Moses Schulstein’s (Moishe Shulstein’s) poem “I Saw a Mountain,” translated by Beatrice Stadtler and Mindele Wajsman in From Holocaust to New Life, edited by Michael Berenbaum (New York: The American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, 1985), p. 121.\n\nHarry S. Truman\n\nThere are left in Europe 1,500,000 Jews, men, women and children, whom the ordeal has left homeless, hungry, sick, and without assistance. These, too, are victims of the crime for which retribution will be visited upon the guilty. But neither the dictates of justice nor that love of our fellowman which we are bidden to practice will be satisfied until the needs of these sufferers are met.\n\n–Remarks to a delegation from the United Jewish Appeal on February 25, 1946, from the Public Papers of the United States, Harry S. Truman, January 1–December 31, 1946 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1962), p. 131\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nThe government of the United States...gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\n\n–George Washington’s letter “To the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island,” dated August 17, 1790\n\nElie Wiesel\n\nNever shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.\n\nNever shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.\n\nNever shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.\n\n–Elie Wiesel, Night (New York: Bantam, 1982), p. 32.\n\nYevgeny Yevtushenko\n\nThe wild grasses rustle over Babi Yar. The trees look ominous, like judges. Here all things scream silently, and, baring my head, slowly I feel myself turning gray. And I myself am one massive, soundless scream above the thousand thousand buried here.\n\n–Yevgeny Yevtushenko, The Collected Poems 1952–1990, edited by Albert C. Todd with the author and James Ragan (New York: Henry Holt, 1991), pp. 102–4\n\n[Back to top]\n\nOn November 1, 1978, President Carter established the President’s Commission on the Holocaust and charged it with issuing a report on the state of Holocaust remembrance and education in the United States. Almost a year later, on September 27, 1979, the President’s Commission presented their results and made four main recommendations:\n\nThat a living memorial be established to honor the victims and survivors of the Holocaust and to ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust are taught in perpetuity;\n\nThat an educational foundation be established to stimulate and support research in the teaching of the Holocaust;\n\nThat a Committee on Conscience be established to collect information on and alert the national conscience regarding reports of actual or potential outbreaks of genocide throughout the world; and\n\nThat a national Day of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust be established in perpetuity and held annually.\n\nIn 1980, Congress unanimously passed legislation to establish the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.

What is the story behind the Children's Tile Wall?\n\nIn 1990, under the leadership of Adeline Yates, wife of Congressman Sidney R. Yates, a group of Congressional wives and other women formed the Committee to Remember the Children, in honor of the estimated 1.5 million children killed during the Holocaust. They invited thousands of young students throughout the nation to help create this wall of remembrance. Children ages 6 to 16 created more than 3,300 tiles for the wall. The children recorded their impressions of the Holocaust on ceramic tiles that were then combined to create this permanent memorial. The tile wall is located on the Museum’s Lower Level.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n11. Who said, \"Thou shall not be a perpetrator; thou shall not be a victim; and thou shall never be a bystander\"?\n\nOn January 27, 1998, Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, delivered a speech to the German Bundestag in which he said, \"I come from a people who gave the Ten Commandments to the world. Time has come to strengthen them by three additional ones, which we ought to adopt and commit ourselves to: thou shall not be a perpetrator; thou shall not be a victim; and thou shall never, but never, be a bystander.”\n\nVariations of the quote have been used in many other contexts and attributed to various people. The quote does not appear on the walls of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The full text of Bauer’s speech to the Bundestag is available on the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website. The quote gained further attention when Professor Bauer included it in a speech delivered at the opening of the Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust on January, 26, 2000. The forum was attended by major dignitaries and leading figures in the field of Holocaust studies and remembrance and was covered by the international press. More recently, the quote was used in a United Nations discussion paper (external link) issued in connection with the observance of International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January 2006.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n12.
