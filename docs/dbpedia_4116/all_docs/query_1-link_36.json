        "text": "On the Weller family and their Amersham brewery:\n\nWeller's Brewery was right in the centre of Amersham, next to the parish church and straddling the River Misbourne. Set up in the 18th century it flourished, employing half the men in the town, but closed in 1929 on the death of George Weller. Its buildings were later converted into offices and residential flats.\n\n• More about the brewery's history is on the museum's website at Amersham brewery.\n\nRIGHT: A section of the\n\nbrewery building\n\nbefore its conversion.\n\nWilliam Weller, born in 1727, bought an interest in the brewery and two pubs in 1775. The family owned 142 pubs when the brewery closed 15 years later, more than a hundred in Buckinghamshire, the rest in neighbouring counties. The Wellers were known as 'good employers', setting up a fire brigade for the town, providing playing fields and supporting the bringing of the railway (beside which, of course, they built 'The Station Hotel').\n\n• More about the Wellers' involvement in the brewery and Amersham can be found on the museum's website at The Weller family.\n\nThe Weller family became prominent in Amersham, second only to the Drakes, who were lords of the manor. From 1830 John Weller lived in the Queen Anne house now known at 'Piers Place' but then known as 'The Firs'. This is number 130 at the western end of the High Street. The house is timber-framed but cased in brick, and today it is Grade II-listed.\n\n• More about this house and its later inhabitants is on the museum website at Piers Place.\n\nLEFT: The front of the house today, facing the High Street."
