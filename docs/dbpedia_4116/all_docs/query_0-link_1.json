        "text": "Funding of the arts has historically been complicated. Many museums have regained their visitor numbers as per pre-Covid-19, but visitors don't fund the majority of what is needed to keep museums open. Will the next generations philanthropic gaze produce enough funds to keep 'the arts' seen and heard? #art #music #museums #culture #funding #legacy #humanities \"The perpetually embattled realm of museums received a rare bit of good news this week. In its annual Visitor Figures survey, the Art Newspaper reported that many of the world’s top museums have seen their visitorship return to pre-Covid-19 levels.\" However, \"there is arguably greater financial trouble for museums looming in the future...the majority of this philanthropy comes from an aging cohort—for all the flack boomers get, they’ve played a substantial role in funding the arts. As the Art Newspaper pointed out in January, as this demographic begins to die out, younger members of the donor class have failed to pick up the slack.\"\n\n\"when it changes location within the building\". I think it is very important point and it is related to Archives and Records Management practices as well. In Archives, every movement of file, or item\" is documented. At least, it is correct when people follow the procedures. There are multiple entries that reflect the moving of file from location to location: File is in archival repository by defauld. File is signed out to researcher in the reading room - file is registered in \" File requests out\" - file is in \" in reading room\" - researcer signes on list of \"file use\" - file is back to repository - is marked as file back. Staff periodically review the book of files out and back in order to check what files are overdue. It is normal to put \"file out\" form in the box. However, all is correct when Archives have procedures and staff follow it. The same procedure is correct for internal work with file: file is signed out for cataloging, restoration, digitazation, exhibition, preparing responce FOI..... The process of trucking becomes much easier in case Archives have Barcodes practice.\n\nAn article from the #nytimes reported that both #museum #attendance and #memberships across the country are still significantly lower when compared to #preCovid, while #inflation is driving up the cost of everything from salaries to utilities to shipping #artworks, and so on. Most #cultural organizations are responding by raising #admission tickets. ... The trend started last July, according to interviews with nearly two dozen #culturalinstitutions, when the The Metropolitan Museum of Art — New York’s largest art museum — raised its adult admission price to $30, a $5 increase. Others followed, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, with the Art Institute of Chicago now one of the most expensive tickets at $32 for out-of-state visitors. https://lnkd.in/gcC_nBJN #museum #museums #institutions #community #west #AmericanWest #fundraising #experience #artandculture #artsandculture #nonprofit Western Museums Association (WMA) American Alliance of Museums CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUSEUMS Museums Association SoCal Museums MuseumWeek The Art Newspaper ARTnews LUISS Business School Luiss Guido Carli University Autry Museum of the American West\n\nI love bold ideas for reshaping the way we support arts & culture in our country. This is an interesting one: what if we funded operating costs as infrastructure? \"As with infrastructure projects such as the building and maintenance of highways, funding cultural institutions will directly support employment: Culture in the United States employs about five million people and pumps about $1 trillion into the economy annually. New funding would boost local economies, cultivate a more equitable arts sector, and promote and protect arts organizations in small and medium-size cities. It would help to disentangle larger arts institutions from the largess of wealthy individuals and corporations, which currently wield an inordinate and thorny amount of influence. (Think of the Sackler family.) And it could defang some of the most pernicious culture-war arguments against arts funding, since it’s much harder to object to paying to fix a museum’s leaky roof than to paying to exhibit a photograph.\" A good read! Thanks for sharing it Joe Waters!\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, most museum practitioners working today are not trained to invite and empower community members to be part of exhibition development processes. In fact, I see little recognition at administrative levels in museums that employee success in this area requires a specific set of skills that takes a lot of time, intention, and professional development to gain and that's in addition to whatever subject matter knowledge a position may require (a topic for another day). But I know from personal experience that good intentions coupled with poor training can cause harm. I love that Isabel Singer describes the inclusion of community voices as a continuum. The level at which a museum engages community voices ought to depend on the capacity they currently have to do the work as well as an honest conversation with community members about where they are on that continuum. But that should not be the end of the story. More training, more practice, more authentic relationship building over the long haul allows museums to grow, and the value and meaning it adds to our institutions is worth it.\n\nTen North Group (formerly Opa-Locka Community Development Corporation - OLCDC) and the City of Opa-locka are undertaking to advocate for Opa-locka to become the chosen city for the proposed Florida Museum of Black History. We've recently submitted a proposal to the Florida Museum of Black History Task Force in Tallahassee, highlighting the unique cultural significance and historical richness of Opa-locka, as well as the “why” of the city becoming the chosen location for this important institution (strategic location in greater South Florida, proximity to public transit and higher ed institutions, etc.). As part of this effort, the Division of Historical Resources (DHR) is seeking input from the public through a crucial survey. Your participation in this survey is vital to demonstrate community support for Opa-locka as the future home of the museum. Your input will help showcase the significance of establishing the museum at an existing 4-acre regional state complex in our downtown. Please take a moment to complete the survey by clicking on the link provided below: https://lnkd.in/e3-29-G7 We ask for you to complete the survey no later than this Friday, February 16 at 5 p.m., in advance of their next meeting on the 19th. Additionally, I’m including the survey questions below for your review: • What questions do you have about the proposed Florida Museum of Black History? • What kind of experiences should museum visitors have while touring galleries and exhibit spaces? • In addition to the topics listed in CS/HB 1441 (Chapter 2023-72, Laws of Florida), what other topics do you want to see in the Florida Museum of Black History? • What kind of facilities and services would you prefer to have available at the Florida Museum of Black History? • Where in Florida do you think the proposed Florida Museum of Black History should be located? • What are the key factors to consider while selecting a suitable site for the proposed Florida Museum of Black History? • What would be your top three reasons for visiting the proposed Florida Museum of Black History? • In your opinion, what are the most important factors to consider when planning for the proposed Florida Museum of Black History? • Do you have any other questions, comments, or concerns? Thank you for your participation and support in this endeavor. Together, we can work towards making Opa-locka the chosen city for the future Florida Museum of Black History.\n\nI couldn't decide which word to use to describe this experience.
