        "text": "Chiltern Open Air Museum is located near Chalfont St Peter and Chalfont St. Giles in the Chiltern Hills, Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe museum was founded in 1976 and aims to rescue and restore common English buildings from the Chilterns, which might otherwise have been destroyed or demolished. The buildings have been relocated to the museum's 45 acre site, which includes woodland and parkland. The collection has more than 30 buildings on view including barns, other traditional farm buildings and houses. The collection includes 16 buildings that are in storage and due for re-erection as and when the museum's funds permit. The museum is run by a small staff with around 200 volunteers.\n\nCurrent exhibits include a working nineteenth century farmyard and a village with its green, cottages, forge and chapel. Including also a reconstruction of an Iron Age house, a Victorian toll house from High Wycombe, a \"Tin Chapple\" from Henton and a Forge from Garston. A fine pair of cottages from 57 Compton Avenue at Leagrave, near Luton started out as a weather-boarded thatched barn with central double doors in the early 18th century. In the late 18th century the barn was converted into two labourers' cottages. Prefabricated post-war home - Universal House, Mark 3, steel frame clad with corrugated asbestos cement Buildings of interest are a 1940s prefab from Amersham.\n\nThey have a variety of special events and hands on opportunities and are shortly to introduce themed holiday activity weeks.\n\nThis page is a Quick Guide, the idea of Quick Guides is to allow very basic information and linking forward information to be added to the system rather than having to wait until a full location guide has been developed. It should therefore be considered a development stage rather than a finished objective. Once more information is known the objective is to create either a Location or Featured Location page which has two grids and far more information.\n\nPlease let us know any other information that we can add to the Further information and Planning Grids or page and any errors that you discover. Before making a long trip to any location it is always wise to double check the current information, websites like magazines may be correct at the time the information is written, but things change and it is of course impossible to double check all entries on a regular basis. If you have any good photographs that you feel would improve the illustration of this page then please let us have copies. In referring to this page it is helpful if you quote the CIN Page Ref at the bottom of the Planning Grid above. To print the planning grid select it then right click and print the selected area."
