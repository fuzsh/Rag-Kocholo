        "text": "Amersham Museum\n\nA dozen South Bucks Mensans made a private visit to Amersham Museum courtesy of Wendy Tibbits an active local member who works at the museum as a volunteer.\n\nWendy greeted us all in reception where we each made a Â£1 donation to the museum.\n\nThe museum is on 2 floors with an attractive herb garden to the rear where it was possible to sit and relax.\n\nThe museum covers all aspects of he history of Amersham and in particular on local trades and professions. There was also a lot to see and read about local natural history.\n\nOf particular interest to myself was the display about the coming of the railway to Amersham.\n\nAfter absorbing all the culture and history it was time to take a short walk to the Peking Empire where Jill Miller another active local Mensan, who knows the family that run the restaurant had ensured that we received a warm welcome.\n\nThe food and service were excellent as was the company.\n\nIf you have the chance to visit Amersham both the museum and the restaurant can be found in the \"Broadway\" in Amersham old town, a pretty thoroughfare with a number of interesting shops and pubs.\n\nAlistair Blackett"
