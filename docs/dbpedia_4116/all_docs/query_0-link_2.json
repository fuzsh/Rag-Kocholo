In 2017 the museum completed an expansion into the neighbouring building, resulting in new stores, a learning and exhibition space, improved facilities and a redisplay of the collection.\n\nThe collection was started before 1983, when no building had been identified as a location for a museum. The collection has always focused on items relating to the local area and now includes over 1,900 objects, 2,000 documents, around 5,000 photos, and reference collections of maps and books. There is an oral history collection comprising over 160 interviews.\n\nThe collection ranges from prehistoric tools, to 20th century objects relating to local industry and\n\nentertainment. The collection is housed in two dedicated stores in the museum, with some items stored in overflow spaces elsewhere onsite. There is no significant backlog and the museum is actively collecting to fill gaps, especially in developing the 20th century collection. There are active volunteer teams undertaking research, cataloguing and collections care. We receive regular enquiries about local history or requests to view the collection, particularly the archive or photographs. The museum has a regular programme of changing exhibitions, which draw upon the collection."
