        "text": "Charles Shipman Payson's gift of 17 artworks by Winslow Homer served as a catalyst for the museum's expansion, the addition of significant long-term loans, and a new modern era of impact and support.\n\nIn the 65 years between 1911 & 1976, the size and scope of the PMA’s exhibitions expanded markedly, and the limitations of the museum's exhibition space, storage, and administrative support became apparent.\n\nIn 1976, Maine native Charles Shipman Payson promised the museum his collection of paintings by Winslow Homer. Additionally and most critically, Payson identified the museum's physical limitations and generously gave toward the construction of a new building to be designed by Henry Nichols Cobb of I. M. Pei & Partners. The PMA broke ground on the Charles Shipman Payson Building in 1981, and within two years facility was opened to the public.\n\nJust 4 years after completing the restoration of the McLellan House, the PMA looked to expand its campus beyond Congress Square and downtown Portland for the first time, and purchased Winslow Homer’s Studio on Prouts Neck, Maine. This acquisition would serve as the impetus for a transformative new decade for the museum, with increased support, audience engagement, recognition of the PMA brand, and impact of the museum in the 21st century.\n\nOver the course of a six-year renovation project, the PMA restored the building to how it appeared during Homer’s lifetime and, in 2012, opened its doors to the public for the first time.\n\nIn conjunction with the studio’s inaugural season, the museum refreshed its identity with a new logo, updated design, and PMA brand, bringing it all together with one of its most successful exhibitions ever, Weatherbeaten: Winslow Homer and Maine. The exhibition broke attendance records and set a new precedent to what the museum could do in the years to come.\n\nSince the successful reopening in February 2017, and with a renewed focus on audience engagement and accessibility, the PMA has aimed to build on the new wave of energy and support at the museum. We have worked tirelessly to be be a brave space that champions freedom of expression. This has meant dedicating ourselves to presenting exhibitions and hosting programs that reflect the museum’s diverse communities and audiences, and to create experiences with art that strengthen bonds and bring us together.\n\nIn October 2019, the PMA took its latest big step: the purchase of 142 Free Street, a 19,158 square foot building directly adjacent to the museum’s Charles Shipman Payson building. The purchase provides the museum with flexibility for future opportunities in a developing city, and enables the PMA to secure the area around Congress Square as a center for arts and culture."
