        "text": "Taxonomic account\n\nOur analyses unambiguously placed the phylogenetic position of the newly discovered agamid from Laos as a member of the Diploderma+Pseudocalotes Clade, and strongly suggested that it represents a sister taxon of the genus Diploderma ( ). Morphologically, the Laotian agamid shares several characters considered to be diagnostic for members of Diploderma by Wang et al. (2019a), including dorsolaterally arranged scales on the dorsum that are enlarged and parallel to the vertebral crest; nuchal and dorsal crest scales relatively short and thick, not elongated into lanceolate spines; post-occipital and post-orbital spines absent; gular scales homogeneous in size, not decreasing in size medially; scales on jaws subequal in size; dorsal scales heterogeneous in size and shape, not regularly imbricate. At the same time, the specimen from Laos possesses a combination of morphological characters which separates it from members of the genus Diploderma, as well as all other genera within Draconinae, particularly its distinctively swollen tail base and by having enlarged heterogeneously-shaped keeled scales on the dorsal, lateral, and ventral surfaces of the tail base.\n\nA fully resolved taxonomic framework should ideally reflect phylogenetic relationships, while also maintaining stability and reducing the need for additional revisionary changes in the future (Vences et al., 2013; Wake, 2013). To avoid subjective instability, Vences et al. (2013) proposed several Taxon Naming Criteria (TNCs) for the assignment of Linnaean ranks to clades, and recognized three Priority TNCs (monophyly, clade stability, and phenotypic diagnosability) and several Secondary TNCs (time banding, biogeography, adaptive zone, and hybrid viability). The present evidence strongly supports the monophyly of the clade containing Diploderma and the newly discovered agamid from Laos, with the latter forming a lineage sister to Diploderma. In this case, three taxonomic decisions are available: (1) assign the agamid from Laos to the genus Diploderma; (2) recognize the newly discovered lineage as a subgenus of Diploderma; or (3) describe the agamid from Laos as a new genus. Following the TNCs of Vences et al. (2013), we argue that substantial evidence supports the third decision, and provide justification for this act below.\n\nAll three Priority TNCs are satisfied by recognizing the agamid lineage from Laos as a separate genus. The phylogenetic relationships within the Diploderma+Pseudocalotes clade are fully resolved based on the analyses from mtDNA and nuDNA data and dense sampling encompassing most of the genera in Draconinae. Moreover, the monophyly of Diploderma sensu stricto is robustly supported within all phylogenetic results. Both factors satisfy the first two Priority TNCs of clade stability and monophyly. The presence of a unique combination of morphological traits, such as the presence of a distinctly swollen tail base with heterogeneously shaped keeled scales, also distinguishes the Laos agamid from members of Diploderma and Pseudocalotes, thus satisfying the third Priority TNC of diagnosability.\n\nAside from the three Priority TNCs, our decision to recognize a new genus for the new Agamid from Laos satisfies several Secondary TNCs. Though we did not perform divergence time-estimates in the present study, it appears that the age of the radiation between Diploderma and the Laotian agamid is substantial. Several recent studies demonstrated that the split between Diploderma and Pseudocalotes likely occurred in late Eocene–early Oligocene (ca. 37.4 Ma in Grismer et al., 2016; ca. 33.5 Ma in Karunarathna et al., 2020), while the onset of intrageneric radiation of these genera took place during Oligocene (ca. 25.5–23.3 Ma in Grismer et al., 2016; ca. 21.7 Ma in Karunarathna et al., 2020). The divergence between Diploderma and the Laotian agamid may have taken place during the early Oligocene, which is notably older than the ages of several other draconine genera (e.g., the split between Sitana and Otocryptis (27.0 Ma), or the split between Ceratophora and Lyriocephalus+Cophotis (28.1 Ma); divergence estimates from Grismer et al., 2016). Furthermore, the new genus and species from Laos is known exclusively from limestone karst pinnacle habitats, which may represent a unique ecological specialization in Draconinae. To date, karst specialization has not been reported in any members of this lizard subfamily, including all species of Diploderma. Therefore, the recognition of the agamid from Laos as a distinct genus satisfies the Secondary TNCs of time banding and adaptive zone.\n\nThe cumulative evidence suggests that recognizing the Laotian agamid as a separate genus would not only enhance the diagnosability of the genera within the Diploderma+Pseudocalotes clade, but also better reveal possible unique ecological specialization and distinct evolutionary history. Therefore, we formally describe the newly discovered draconine lineage from Laos as a new genus below.\n\nLaodracon Gen. nov. Brakels, Sitthivong, Wang, Nguyen & Poyarkov\n\nDiagnosis: A genus of the subfamily Draconinae characterized by the following characteristics: body size moderate (male SVL 94.5–101.6 mm); tail base distinctively swollen at base; tail scales at swollen base distinctively enlarged dorsally and ventrally, heterogeneous dorsally and laterally, but homogeneous ventrally, all keeled and protruding with keels mostly misaligned; tympanum exposed; dorsal scales heterogeneous, strongly keeled, enlarged scales arranged in somewhat irregular dorsolateral series close to vertebral crest; nuchal and dorsal crest scales relatively short and thick, not elongated into lanceolate spines; post-occipital and post-orbital spines absent; gular scales mostly homogeneous in size, not decreasing in size medially; scales on the lateral surfaces of jaws subequal in size across gular region; no preanal or femoral pores.\n\nDistribution: To date, Laodracon Gen. nov. is known only from a single limestone outcrop at the Rock Viewpoint tourism concession area within Nam Sanam-Phou Pha Marn PPA., Khounkham District (hereafter Dist.), Khammouan Province, Laos ( ). This limestone massif represents the northernmost portion of the larger Central Indochina Limestone landscape which extends from southern part of Bolikhamxai Prov. in the north-west and extends into Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Quang Binh Prov., Vietnam, in the south-east. Therefore, it is possible that Laodracon Gen. nov. also occur in other karst area within this landscape in central Laos and adjacent areas of Vietnam.\n\nEtymology: The generic name “Laodracon” is a Latinized noun in masculine nominative singular form, which gives reference to its area of occurrence in central Laos. The word “dracon” is derived from Greek “δράκων” (drakon) meaning “dragon” or a “basilisk” and refers to mythological serpents; it is widely used as a part of genus-level names within the subfamily Draconinae. We recommend the name “Laos Karst Dragons” as common name of the new genus in English.\n\nComparison with other Draconinae genera in East and Southeast Asia: Laodracon Gen. nov. differs from its sister genus Diploderma by having a different tail shape at base (distinctively swollen at tail base vs. not swollen at all or only slightly swollen) and a distinct shape and arrangement of scales at the swollen site on the tail (scales distinctively enlarged, heterogeneous dorsally and laterally and homogeneous ventrally, all keels on individual scales cariante, protruding and misaligned vs. not enlarged or only slightly enlarged dorsally, mostly homogeneous, all keels carinate and not protruding; ). Additional comparisons between the type species of the new genus Laodracon Gen. nov. with 18 species of Diploderma distributed in Indochina, southern China and Myanmar are detailed below.\n\nA, B: Tail basis of D. splendidum (A: Kunming Institute of Zoology 040155) and Laodracon carsticola Gen. et sp. nov. (B: National University of Laos R.2022.01, holotype) is shown in dorsolateral (1) and ventral (2) views. Photographs by Kai Wang (A), and Nathanaël Maury (B).\n\nFrom the closely related genus Pseudocalotes, Laodracon Gen. nov. differs from by having a differential head shape (head wide and robust, HW 77% HL vs. head slender and narrow, HW<70% HL), a differential shape of nuchal crests (tall triangular shape vs. elongated lanceolate shape), more suborbital scale rows and a different shape of suborbital scales (4 rows, subequal in size vs. single or multiple rows, but medial row distinctively enlarged), and differential shape of gular and lateral jaw scales (homogeneous in size vs. decreasing in size medial posteriorly on gular, but increasing in size laterally on lateral jaw).\n\nComparisons of the new genus with other Draconinae genera occurring in the mainland Southeast Asia are summarized in Supplementary Tables S5, S6. Apart from the genus Phoxophrys, the new genus Laodracon Gen. nov. can be easily distinguished from the remaining genera in Draconinae by having a distinctively swollen tail base with enlarged, heterogeneous, strongly keeled, misaligned, protruding scales (vs. not swollen at base, scales either subequal in size, not protruding, or keels aligned and carinate). Furthermore, the new genus can be distinguished from Acanthosaura and Calotes by the absence of orbital and temporal spines (vs. presence); from Aphaniotis and Pseudocophotis by having an exposed tympanum (vs. concealed); from Bronchocela by having differential shape of dorsal scales (heterogeneous vs. homogenesous) and a shorter tail (TAL/SVL<3.0 vs. >3.0); from Cristidorsa and Japalura by the absence of V-shaped ridge of enlarged scales on the dorsum (vs. presence); from Draco by the absence of prolonged ribs, supporting a wing-like patagium (vs. presence); from Mantheyus by the absence of femoral pores and lacking a pouch-like skin extension on the belly (vs. presence); from Ptyctolaemus by the absence of three longitudinal gular folds on the each side of the throat area forming a U-shaped pattern (vs. presence); from Gonocephalus and Malayodracon by having dorsolateral series of enlarged scales (vs. absence).\n\nType species: The new genus currently contains a single species Laodracon carsticola sp. nov., which we formally describe below:\n\nLaodracon carsticola sp. nov.\n\n( – , Supplementary Figure S2; ; Supplementary Tables S5, S6)\n\nA: Macrohabitat of the new species on karst pinnacles.

Photographs by Nathanaël Maury.\n\nParatype: Adult male NUOL R.2022.02 (Supplementary Figure S2), collected on 2 February 2023 by the same collectors and at the same location as the holotype.\n\nDiagnosis: The new species is defined by a combination of generic characters of Laodracon Gen. nov. listed above, and additionally is characterized by the following combination of morphological traits: tail long, TAL/SVL 2.11; head robust, HW/HL 0.77; hind limbs thin, long, HLL/SVL 0.73; transverse scale rows around midbody 34; subdigital lamellae under fourth finger 15/15; subdigital lamellae under fourth toe 28/28; gular pouch present; transverse gular fold present, distinct; scales on ventral, lateral and dorsal surfaces of head and body strongly keeled; dorsal background coloration black, with three white cross-bands formed by a series of large blotches and irregular white spots; gular with thin, dark gray reticulated patterns and a median blue gular spot.\n\nDescription of holotype: Adult male in a good state of preservation; measurements and scale counts of holotype presented in . Body slightly compressed laterally ( ), SVL 101.6 mm; tail, forelimbs, and hindlimbs long and slender (TAL/ SVL 2.11, FLL/SVL 0.46, HLL/ SVL 0.73); head triangular, longer than wide (HW/HL 0.77, HD/HW 0.77, SEL/HL 0.3); snout projecting ( ), snout tip obtuse in dorsal ( ) and lateral ( ) aspects. Rostral scale rectangular, bordering five small postrostral scales. Nasal scale separated from rostral by two scales but in contact with first supralabial ( ); single group of enlarged, keeled scales at anterior and posterior edges of the orbit ( ); enlarged translucent scale above pineal foramen absent ( ). Tympanum exposed; supralabials slightly keeled, nine on both sides, four scale rows between orbit and supralabials. Mental pentagonal, contacting three scales posteriorly, of which median smallest ( ); infralabials keeled, eight on both sides, first pair of infralabials not in contact; scales on throat imbricate, homogeneous in size, strongly keeled, slightly smaller or equal to ventrals; transverse gular fold present ( ); gular pouch developed.\n\nBody scales on dorsum heterogeneous in size and shape, forming two irregular lateral rows of closely arranged slightly enlarged, strongly keeled dorsal scales ( ); each enlarged dorsal scale bearing single lateral keel; axillary scales fine, much smaller than remaining dorsals; 34 transverse scale rows around midbody. Nuchal crest scales tall, pointed-triangular, slightly larger, and clearly separated from dorsal crest scales ( ); dorsal crest scales triangular, pointing posteriorly, each bearing two lateral keels, much lower than nuchals, slightly raised posteriorly ( ). Ventral body scale count 28, homogeneous, all strongly keeled, imbricate, arranged regularly transverse rows. Dorsal, ventral limb scales strongly keeled, mostly homogeneous, except smaller scales around knee and elbow areas; 15/15 subdigital lamellae under fourth finger; 28/28 subdigital lamellae under fourth toe. Tail base distinctively swollen. At swollen site, dorsal and lateral scales heterogeneous in size, protruding, distinctively keeled, keels misaligned; ventral scales homogeneous, distinctively enlarged, in different shape to dorsal and lateral ones, keels carinate; 20 scales across the tail base; remaining tail scales much smaller, homogeneous, strongly keeled, carinate.\n\nColor of holotype: In life, head background coloration dorsally black, turning slate-grey on head sides and ventral surfaces ( –F).

Tail dorsally brownish-black with 13 transverse off-white to beige bands getting narrower towards the tail tip ( ). After six months in preservative the coloration pattern did not change; the bluish tint of the iris and gular regions faded to grey.\n\nVariation: Measurements and scale counts of paratype are presented in ; paratype male NUOL R.2022.02 shown in Supplementary Figure S2. Overall, the paratype NUOL R.2022.02 is quite similar to the holotype in external morphology and coloration; with exception of the following characters: supralabials are separated from orbit by 8/8 scale rows; 33 middorsal scales, 26 of which pointed; nuchal crest consisting of 12 enlarged scales, of which eight middle the largest; toe IV with 26/26 subdigital lamellae; ventral scales keeled, in 27 rows. The paratype has a partially everted hemipenes, paired smooth organs lacking spines or papillae (Supplementary Figure S1I).\n\nNatural history notes: Little is known about the biology of Laodracon carsticola sp. nov.. This species is currently only known from a single locality within the Nam Sanam-Phou Pha Marn PPA., Khounkham Dist., Khammouan Prov., Laos. Individuals were observed climbing or perching on the tops of sharp karst pinnacles ( ). Only a few sightings of the new species have been made. The first individual was observed and photographed on 27 August 2022 around 1500h by S. Xayyasith during a bird watching excursion ( ). The second individual (the holotype) was observed on 6 October 2022, around 1630h by a local guide while guiding a group of tourists at a zipline course, and subsequently collected. The paratype male was collected on 2 February 2023, at 1400h at the same spot on the top of a limestone pinnacle. These three individuals were spotted while crawling on steep karst pinnacles around 50–70 m above the ground. The body color of the new species—a contrasting combination of black and white blotches—corresponds with the color of the limestone karst rocks on which it lives and likely serves as a disruptive coloration. Indeed, when perching on top of limestone karsts, individuals of the new species become almost invisible in the mosaic of sharp shadows and light spots ( ) and are difficult to spot unless they start moving. Almost all body scales of the new species bear pronounced keels and carinae, which might assist in climbing steep limestone rocks or perhaps serve as wedging points into karstic cracks and crevices for defense. This agamid species appears to be rock-dwelling and is only sighted on top of the karst pinnacles of the limestone mountains high above the ground (ca. 30–70 m), similar to some arboreal canopy-dwelling agamids, that rarely ever venture near the ground. The local people said this species is rare and was never recorded outside the limestone habitat on the ground. According to the local people and the staff of the Nam Sanam-Phou Pha Marn PPA, the new species is active in the late morning (0900h to 1100h) and late afternoon (1500h to 1700h), with the peak activity period being the latter interval. The diet of the new species likely consists of ants (Formicidae), which were numerous during the daytime.\n\nOther reptile species that were recorded around the type locality (though on different elevations above the ground) of Laodracon carsticola sp. nov. include Cyrtodactylus lomyenensis, Gekko khunkhamensis Sitthivong et al., Lycodon banksi, Protobothrops sieversorum, and Trimeresurus truongsonensis.\n\nComparisons with Diploderma species occurring in southern China and Indo-Burma: Besides the morphological characters which define Laodracon gen. nov., Laodracon carsticola sp. nov. differs from all members of Diploderma from adjacent regions except for Diploderma dymondi, D. swild, D. panlong, D. varcoae, and D. slowinskii by having an exposed tympanum (vs. concealed); and from all but D. fasciatum, D. makii, and D. luei by a different dorsal ornamentation pattern in males (transverse bands vs. dorsolateral stripes).\n\nFor Diploderma that also have an exposed tympanum, the new species differs by having a distinct body ornamentation and coloration (black in background, with white transverse bands vs. white, gray, or brown in background, with green or yellowish green dorsolateral stripes) and by the presence of a reticulated dark gular pattern with a blue gular spot (vs. absence of gular spot or reticulated pattern, or gular spot in different color). In the three species of Diploderma with transverse bands on dorsum, Laodracon carsticola sp. nov. differs from D. fasciatum by having homogeneous gular scales (vs. heterogeneous); and from D. luei and D. makii by having a more robust head (HW 0.77 HL vs. <0.7) and by the presence of transverse gular fold (vs. absence).\n\nDistribution and biogeography: The new species is currently known only from the type locality within the limestone massif near the Rock Viewpoint, Nam Sanam-Phou Pha Marn PPA., Khounkham Dist., Khammouan Prov., Laos. It may also be distributed in adjacent limestone mountain areas such as Phou Nok Kok Provincial Protection Forest and Phou Hin Poun National Protected Area.\n\nConservation status: To date, Laodracon carsticola sp. nov. is known only from a very narrow area within Nam Sanam-Phou Pha Marn PPA., Khammouan Prov., Laos. Further research is required to clarify the extent of its distribution, population size and trends, and conservation status. We preliminary suggest the new species should be considered as Data Deficient (DD) following the IUCN’s Red List categories (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee, 2019).\n\nEtymology: The specific epithet “carsticola” is a noun in the nominative case singular used in apposition, derived from German “Karst” (originally from Latin “carsus”) used for “limestone landscapes” and “cola”, a Latin word meaning “resident”, “inhabiting” or “dwelling in”. The name is given in reference to the limestone mountain habitat of the new species. We recommend the names “Khammouan Karst Dragon” and “Chi Pom Pou Hin Poun Khammouane” for the common names of the new species in English and Lao languages, respectively."
