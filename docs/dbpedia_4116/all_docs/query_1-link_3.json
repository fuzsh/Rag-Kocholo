It is a hidden gem with a collection spanning 2,000 years of local history. There are hands-on activities and a packed programme of activities and events. The museum’s collection features a large and diverse collection of objects relating to local craft and industry, locally manufactured and produced toys and domestic goods. There is a substantial collection of documents, maps and photographs, and many of the museum’s photographs can be viewed in the museum. The museum building is the oldest domestic building in Amersham, part of a Tudor hall house. There is a wonderful garden full of herbs and plants with medicinal and culinary properties."
