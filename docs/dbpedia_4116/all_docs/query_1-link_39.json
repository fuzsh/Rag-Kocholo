        "text": "St Mary's primary school children explored the history and art of their local highstreet through illustrative activies with the support of The Arts Society Amersham and Community Grants. The children visited the the high street looking at the medieval houses, drawing details and looking at their construction. A collection of black and white photographs illustrating shops and trades people in the town in the 19th and early 20th Century in Amersham Museum's collection inspired the children to create three murals; Mr Green, the greengrocer, Mr Butcher selling meat and Mr Sweet from the sweet shop.\n\nSince the launch our of Community grants initiative, we've supported a wide range of activities. All of our Community Grants are intended to make a difference in the arts in our local communities and are made possible by the enthusiasm and hard work of our local Societies.\n\nTo find out more about our grants please click here.\n\nPhotos: The Arts Society Amersham"
