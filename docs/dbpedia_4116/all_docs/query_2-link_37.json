        "text": "There was a housing shortage after the Second World War, and prefabricated temporary bungalows (“prefabs”) were one solution.\n\nPrefabs were made using different materials to normal houses. The parts were ‘prefabricated’ (ready made in a factory, taken to the site and then put together), which is where the name comes from. 160,000 prefabs were made in the late 1940s.\n\nThey were only expected to be used for 10 years while “normal” housing was built – but many were still lived in up to the 1970s.\n\nWhy is the Prefab at the Museum?\n\nPrefabs weren’t made to last forever, so the Finch Lane estate was being demolished to build more modern houses. The Museum wanted one because lots of people remember them and they are an important piece of our local and social history. The prefab at the Museum was one of 46 on the Finch Lane Estate in Amersham.\n\nWhat is the Prefab Built From?\n\nThe prefab is built from 26 asbestos cement panels, bolted together on a wood and steel frame. This stands on top of a concrete base.\n\nThere were 18 different designs and our prefab is a Universal House Mark 3 design. It was made by a company in Rickmansworth and was originally built in 1947.\n\nTake a Look Around Our Prefab\n\nOur prefab resonates with lots of our visitors, generally, because lots of people know someone who used to live in one.\n\nHave a look at the video showing the interior of of our prefab and see if you can recognise any furniture that you may have seen in family and friends homes."
