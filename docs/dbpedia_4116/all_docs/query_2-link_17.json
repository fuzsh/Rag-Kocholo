        "text": "CHAIR FESTIVAL EVENT\n\nJoin at Amersham Museum to celebrate the history of chairmaking in the local area.\n\nProfessional chairmaker Jacob Marks from Bibbings and Hensby will be creating one of their signature stools by hand in the museum garden on Saturday 13, Friday 19 and Saturday 20 July. The finished stool will be added to Amersham Museum, for visitors to sit on and enjoy for years to come. Watch the transformation of raw material into a beautifully finished stool, while learning more about the history and techniques of traditional chairmaking.\n\nThis is a drop-in event during museum opening hours and is included with general admission to the museum..\n\nThis event is part of the Chilterns Chairs Festival, running through July in celebration of the unique chairmaking heritage of Wycombe and the local area. With a varied programme of events, you’ll learn how the industry grew from the local landscape into thriving furniture production which proudly continues today. Join us to celebrate the stories, the chairs and the surroundings which make up our history. There’s something for everyone, so get involved!"
