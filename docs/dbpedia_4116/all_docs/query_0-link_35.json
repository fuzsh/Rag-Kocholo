        "text": "By means of a case study, this article presents the need to develop a contextual museology that allows models of museum management to be adapted in times of transition or crisis. It also defends the need to implement knowledge-management processes that advocate systematising and documenting the memory of museum entities, which can in turn serve as a foundation for planning museum practices amid crises. Despite the challenges caused by its involuntary closure, for Colombia’s Centro de Museos de la Universidad de Caldas (Museum Centre at the University of Caldas) the pandemic became the ideal setting to carry out, behind closed doors, an assessment of 25 years of continuous work. What should be done with a closed museum? The institutional response was to begin an internal evaluation process to re-imagine the museum in a future era of post-pandemic work. The Centro de Museos therefore developed a new museum plan, financed by a grant from the Colombian government's Ministry of Culture. Turning to online modes of working posed a challenge on the implementation of participatory methodologies that were used at different organisational levels, such as the creation of collaborative murals, interviews and online discussions. These exercises made it possible to integrate different perspectives and visions of the museum and to recover lost memories that contributed to a new conceptualisation of the university museum.\n\nAll of those persons and institutions that have been involved in situations of violence, conflict or civil unrest, know perfectly that there comes a time when we, as museum workers, have to make difficult choices to control and shape the situation that we are immersed into. How should we, as cultural institutions, react to conflict in our communities? Which is our role towards our audiences? This paper reviews the case scenario that we lived in our museum, in hope that the achievements and mistakes we made in our way, could shine some light on the difficult role museums have when faced with a difficult situation.\n\nThe way museums present themselves to society nowadays does not match the definitions which have been ascribed to them. The majority of museums has adopted, even if automatically, a business-like behavior, in order to cope with the State’s economic and financial constraints. This has led them to create a new acting paradigm. With the collapse of the Welfare-State, also reflected in the lack of support to culture, those in charge of the cultural heritage were forced to innovate and to adapt themselves to different management models. A new concept of museum was created. We are now witnessing a new age in museology. As a result of these transformations, museums have become closer to local communities and more attentive to stakeholders, the interested parties. From this connection, emerged natural partnership and collaboration bonds, which can be referred to as strategic philanthropy or causes’ marketing. With this study we aim at showing how financial crisis is related to “cultural innovation”\n\nThis paper takes Greek philosopher Plato’s well-known observation that no living organism stays actually the same throughout its lifetime since its fundamental nature is instead continuous change, and applies it to museum institutions. Museum institutions might be regarded as living organisms as well and, from this perspective, we can ask what causes a museum to be perceived as the same museum over time. In so doing, we can thus also analyse the conditions under which the balance between stability and change breaks down. Combining contextual analysis and a case study approach seems the most promising strategy to address these questions. In this paper, we analyse the debate over the function and mission of museums in post-Unification Italy to show that museums can serve multiple purposes, purposes which in turn might shape museums’ collections, visions, and display and narrative strategies. We also present the analysis of a case study which not only demonstrates that museums never stay the same but also allows us to draft an analytical model according to which the substantial changes museums undergo or trigger in interaction with and relation to societal changes enable us to identify the fields of force in any given concrete situation in which museums are located and act as institutions.\n\nIn recent holocaust year, the COVID-19 crisis has deeply affected societies around the world, declining the global economy into a deep recession. With the majority of cultural institutions forced to close their doors, the museum and cultural sectors have been most affected. Despite the challenges posed by this unprecedented crisis, many cultural institutions and professionals have continued to serve as a source of resilience and support to communities, envisioning new strategies to provide access to culture and education in the context of containment measures. UNESCO has launched a study to assess, based on contributions from states and museum professionals, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 on museums and museum-like institutions. This initiative also seeks to understand how the sector has adapted to the constraints imposed by the pandemic and to explore ways of supporting affected institutions in the aftermath of the crisis. According to the survey it is found that museums have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 90% of them, or more than 85,000 institutions worldwide, having closed their doors during the crisis. The effect of these closures is not only economic but also social. Museums play a vital role in our societies, preserving our common heritage; it also provides spaces that promote education, inspiration, and dialogue. Based on values of respect and cultural diversity, museums strengthen social inclusion, promote creativity, and are conveyors of collective memory. Moreover, their role in the promotion of tourism is a key driver of sustainable economic development, both locally and nationally, which will be essential to overcoming the crisis in the coming months and years. The present paper's objective is to highlight how museums revitalize in the times of COVID-19. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the sources of revenue. As well as museums have overcome the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 but how they will manage and face the challenges of operating in a post-COVID-19 in the future."
