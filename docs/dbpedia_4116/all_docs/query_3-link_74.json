        "text": "The architectural plans for the Serralves Museum were first drawn up in 1991 by the architect Alvaro Siza. The new building was finally inaugurated in 1999, harmoniously integrated within the surrounding urban area and the pre-existing spaces of the gardens of the Park and Villa.\n\nA visit to the Museum always offers much more than the exhibitions alone. Itâs also an opportunity to discover the particularities of each space within this architectural work, that has a strong organizational structure and great flexibility and transformational capacity, enabling it to respond to the diversity and unpredictability of the contemporary art works on display.\n\nProject by Siza Vieira and an architectural programme with a wide range of different requirements.\n\nA key aspect was to ensure that the project forged a dialogue with the urban surroundings and Serralves Park. The buildingâs implantation site was chosen so as to create the least possible impact on the surroundings. The architect Ãlvaro Siza â who began working on the project in 1991 â was responsible for integrating a new building within a space that already had its own distinct layout and identity.\n\nInaugurated in June 1999, the museumâs building is constituted by a main body with two exhibition wings extending southwards. It thus has a very specific layout. In the words of the architect: \"The exhibition area was developed in a \"Uâ shaped layout, in order to enable the garden to enter inside the museum and minimise the buildingâs environmental impact.â\n\nThe relationship with the garden is achieved in function of the definition of the buildingâs overall layout. Ãlvaro Siza summarises this idea: \"For example, in the case of Serralves, with a delightful woodland in the vicinity, by putting an open patio here, the landscape enters within the building. Furthermore, the window takes full advantage of this factor. It brings the landscape inside.â\n\nHe continues, by explaining the buildingâs integration within the urban surroundings and Serralves Park: \"It was almost an impossible task to build the museum - because it couldnât influence either the street or the Park. It was therefore necessary to build a large scale building, that would have a minimal impact on the surroundings (a residential area with two-storey houses) and would be in harmony with, or complement, the high-quality garden .â\n\nAs a result he designed: \"A museum inserted within a pre-existing established garden â an exquisite garden.â"
