        "text": "Casablanca premiered at the Hollywood Theater in New York City on November 26, 1942, to capitalize on Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of French North Africa) and the subsequent capture of Casablanca.\n\nIt went into general release on January 23, 1943, to take advantage of the Casablanca Conference, a high-level meeting in the city between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Office of War Information prevented screening of the film to troops in North Africa, believing it would cause resentment among Vichy supporters in the region.\n\nIn its initial American release, Casablanca was a substantial but not spectacular box-office success, earning $3.7 million (equivalent to $47 million in 2020). A 50th anniversary re-release grossed $1.5 million in 1992. According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $3,398,000 domestically and $3,461,000 in foreign markets.\n\nCasablanca was nominated for Best Actor (Bogart), Supporting Actor (Rains), Cinematography - Black and White, Film Editing, and Score.\n\nIt won for Best Picture, Director (Curtiz), and Screenplay (Epstein, Esptein, and Koch)\n\nIn 1989, the film was one of the first 25 films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nIn 2005, it was named one of the 100 greatest films of the last 80 years by Time magazine (the selected films were not ranked).\n\nBright Lights Film Journal stated in 2007, \"It is one of those rare films from Hollywood's Golden Age which has managed to transcend its era to entertain generations of moviegoers ... Casablanca provides twenty-first-century Americans with an oasis of hope in a desert of arbitrary cruelty and senseless violence.\"\n\nThe film also ranked at number 28 on Empire's list of the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, which stated: \"Love, honour, thrills, wisecracks and a hit tune are among the attractions, which also include a perfect supporting cast of villains, sneaks, thieves, refugees and bar staff. But it's Bogart and Bergman's show, entering immortality as screen lovers reunited only to part. The irrefutible [sic] proof that great movies are accidents.\"\n\nScreenwriting teacher Robert McKee maintains that the script is \"the greatest screenplay of all time\".\n\nIn 2006, the Writers Guild of America agreed, voting it the best ever in its list of the 101 greatest screenplays.\n\n1998 AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies - #2\n\n2001 AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills - #37\n\n2002 AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions - #1\n\n2003 AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains - #4: Rick Blaine (hero)\n\n2004 AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs - #2: \"As Time Goes By\"\n\n2005 AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes - #5: \"Here's looking at you, kid.\"\n\n#20: \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\"\n\n#28: \"Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'.\"\n\n#32: \"Round up the usual suspects.\"\n\n#43: \"We'll always have Paris.\"\n\n#67: \"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.\"\n\nThese six lines were the most of any film (Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz tied for second with three apiece). Also nominated for the list was \"Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.\"\n\n2006 AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers - #32\n\n2007 AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) - #3\n\nCasablanca currently holds a 99% among critics on RT, a 100 score on Metacritic, and a 4.3/5 on Letterboxd.\n\nLike most film stars, Bogart seemed larger than life, but in person he stood 5' 8\" tall. Bergman, however, was almost two inches taller. As a result, director Michael Curtiz had Bogie stand on blocks or sit on cushions to make him seem taller than Bergman.\n\nAt the time Casablanca was made, censors used a heavy hand when it came to Hollywood films — and in a later interview, Julius Epstein remembered just how stringent they were. \"The main thing that affected our work in those days was that we were so handcuffed by censorship — remember, the nation shook when Clark Gable said 'damn' in Gone With the Wind,\" remembered Epstein, who said at the time you couldn't even show a woman getting divorced. Still, when they wrote Casablanca, they tried to sneak stronger language past the censors. \"I remember after a long time we could finally say 'hell.' But it had to be a sparse use of 'hell,'\" Epstein recalled. \"So what we would do was write fifty 'hells' and then bargain with them. We'd say, 'How about twenty-five?' We'd wind up with two or three.\"\n\nThe music for the film was written by Max Steiner, an Austrian-born, Hungarian-Jewish composer and arranger who gained fame for his score of Gone With the Wind and King Kong. The classic song \"As Time Goes By\" was included in the original play, but Steiner didn't like it and wanted it excluded from the film adaptation. But Bergman had already shot the scenes with the song and cut her hair for her next role, so they couldn't be re-shot, and the song stayed. After the movie was released, \"As Time Goes By\" spent 21 weeks on the hit parade. Steiner later admitted that the song \"must have had something to attract so much attention.\""
