        "text": "\"Classics!\" would be the word to describe the films coming to 4K this November, with restorations featuring cinema's most adorable trash-loving robot and a disco-dancing heartthrob who helped to define an era. There are also '90s favorites from Oscar-winning auteurs Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino, expertly restored for a whole new generation of cinephiles to discover, and one of the most beloved films of all time, a seminal Best Picture winner widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nHere are the titles being released in 4K UHD this month, and when you can add each to your collection:\n\nCasablanca\n\n\"You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss…\"\n\nConsidered by many as one of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood, Michael Curtiz's 1942 war-time romance Casablanca is about to be experienced like never before. Celebrating its 80th Anniversary, the film has stood the test of time, taking on a life of its own within popular culture thanks to its memorable characters, iconic performances, quotable lines, and rousing theme song. Set during World War II, the film stars Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid. Bogart plays expatriate Rick Blaine, owner of a nightclub in Morocco who discovers that his former lover Ilsa (Bergman) is in town with her husband Victor Laszlo (Henreid) — a Czechoslovakian resistance leader. With the German's hot on their trail, Isla seeks out Rick’s aid to help them get out of the country — the only question is, will he? Casablanca has it all. Drama, intrigue, humor, romance, action, and suspense. This is a masterpiece that epitomizes everything audiences love about going to the movies.\n\nThe film was nominated for eight Oscars and won three (Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay). In 1989, Casablanca was one of the first films ever selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nFor this new release by Warner Bros., Casablanca has undergone an extensive and meticulous restoration. This new 4K UHD Blu-Ray image was restored and remastered from a 4K 16bit film scan of the best-surviving nitrate film elements. These 4K scanned digital images went through a digital process to clean and repair the picture for a pristine UHD presentation and the images were then graded in High Dynamic Range for today’s premium display formats providing an unprecedented viewing experience. The film’s original mono audio track has been newly restored providing a richer level of clarity to the audio than previously possible.\n\nThis release is also packed with an extensive list of incredible features, including multiple documentary pieces, commentaries featuring Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer, deleted scenes and outtakes, trailers, an Introduction by Lauren Bacall, and more.\n\nAvailable: On 4K UHD Blu-Ray Nov. 8, also available on digital.\n\nSaturday Night Fever\n\nReleased in 1977, director John Badham's Saturday Night Fever exploded onto movie screens, becoming both a hit with critics and a smash hit at the box office. With its hypnotic dance sequences, the film catapulted John Travolta to stardom in his Oscar-nominated performance as Tony Manero, a young Italian-American from Brooklyn. Feeling directionless in life and struggling to break free from his working-class neighborhood, Manero finds solace on the weekends dancing at a local discothèque while social tensions simmer in the background.\n\nSaturday Night Fever's significance on popular culture cannot be understated, as it popularized the disco music era across the globe with its best-selling soundtrack, initiating collaborations between film studios and record labels to create pop songs to coincide with a film’s release — a staple of mainstream cinema throughout the '80s and '90s. Deservedly, the film was selected for preservation by the National Library of Congress in 2010.\n\nCelebrating its 45th Anniversary, Saturday Night Fever is being released in the 4K UHD format by Paramount Home Media Distribution. This new presentation features the original theatrical cut with both HDR10 and Dolby Vision while the accompanying Blu-Ray features the Director’s Cut of the film. Supplemental features include a commentary by director Badham, retrospectives Catching the Fever, Back to Bay Ridge, a '70s Discopedia, and more.\n\nAvailable: On 4K UHD Blu-Ray Nov. 8, also available on digital.\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nCelebrating its 30th Anniversary is Quentin Tarantino's energetic feature film directorial debut, Reservoir Dogs. Upon its release, this crime thriller shocked and rocked audiences as the world was introduced to Tarantino's filmmaking flair for genre storytelling, depictions of graphic violence, appealing ensemble casts, and his crackling use of language. And, as with all of his films, it's also backed up by one killer soundtrack.\n\nTold as a non-linear story, Reservoir Dogs stars Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and Harvey Keitel, as a part of a group of strangers who have been brought together by a crime boss to carry out a jewelry heist. But, when the job falls apart after an alarm gets tripped, a shootout ensues. The surviving members of the group then gather at a warehouse and suspect that one of them is an informant.\n\nMore than a cult film, Reservoir Dogs is a highly influential piece of filmmaking within the realm of American Independent Cinema crossing over to mainstream audiences —particularly on home video. This new release by Lionsgate Home Entertainment features a new 4K restoration with both HDR and Dolby Vision, and is complemented with a Dolby True HD 5.1 audio track. As a bonus, fans are treated to Deleted Scenes, and two featurettes, Profiling Res. Dogs and Playing it Fast and Loose. For collectors, a limited edition SteelBook is also available.\n\nAvailable: On 4K UHD Blu-Ray Nov. 15.\n\nMalcolm X\n\nFrom visionary director Spike Lee, 1992's Malcolm X brought one of the most provocative figures within Black liberation to the screen in this stunning biopic, featuring Denzel Washington's commanding Oscar-nominated performance as the titular civil rights leader. Based on his autobiography, Malcolm X spans his violent childhood at the hands of white-supremacists, to time spent in prison for breaking and entering, to converting to Islam, and finally to his becoming a Black Nationalist leader.\n\nLee's film was made with the filmmaker's closest collaborators and is an extraordinary achievement filled with nuance and style, delivering audiences a completely engrossing epic. Malcolm X is a stunning tribute to a man who, to this day, serves as a figure of strength and inspiration for countless minority groups around the world. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the National Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nFeaturing a new restoration supervised by cinematographer Ernest R. Dickerson, this new release of Malcolm X from The Criterion Collection features both HDR and Dolby Vision presentations of the film along with a 5.1 surround DTS Master Audio soundtrack. Supplemental features include a new conversation between Lee and journalist and screenwriter Michael Cooper, interviews with actor Delroy Lindo and composer Terence Blanchard, a \"Making of\" featurette, deleted scenes, filmmaker commentary, and the 1972 feature-length documentary Malcolm X, directed by Arnold Perl and narrated by James Earl Jones.\n\nAvailable: On 4K UHD Blu-Ray Nov. 22.\n\nWALL•E\n\nFrom their groundbreaking first feature, 1995's Toy Story, Pixar quickly became the staple of digital animated storytelling. Their 2008 sci-fi feature Wall-E is both an adventure film and a beautiful love story between two unlikely heroes. The film presents its audience with a life-less garbage-laden planet Earth in the twenty-ninth century, where the last operating trash-compacting robot goes about his business, cleaning up one piece of garbage at a time. When, however, he meets EVE, a fellow robot sent to detect new plant life on Earth, the pair are thrust into a quest to return life to a dying world.\n\nNominated for six Oscars, including Best Original Screenplay, Wall-E won for Best Animated Feature Film. Wall-E is both visually dazzling and thought-provoking. The film offers its viewers, young and old alike, a story of connection, along with an urgent message to take pause and appreciate the precious Earth.\n\nThis new special edition of Wall-E marks a first partnership between Disney and The Criterion Collection. The release features a brand new 4K UHD feature encode approved by director Andrew Stanton and is presented for the first time with both Dolby Vision or HDR10+ depending on your player’s capabilities. A Dolby Atmos sound mix completes the presentation of the feature. Criterion’s release comes as a three-disc set DigiPack set. Supplemental features include filmmaker commentaries, short films, essays, script notes, extensive behind-the-scenes pieces, a tour of Pixar’s Living Archive with Stanton, and much more.\n\nAvailable: On 4K UHD Blu-Ray Nov. 22.\n\nBy Adam J.
