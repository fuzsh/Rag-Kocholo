        "text": "1942\n\nCity Locations\n\nCalifornia (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio, Unique\n\nLocation Styles\n\nMoroccan, American Art Deco, Dated, Bohemian, Mediterranean, Plane Style\n\nAbout Casablanca\n\nCasablanca is a romantic drama that was released in 1942. Michael Curtiz directed it, featuring actors Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, and Paul Henreid. The story takes place in Casablanca, a city in Morocco under Vichy's control, in December 1941. The plot revolves around Rick Blaine, an American expatriate forced to choose between his love for an ex-partner, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and helping her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), escape the Nazi forces who have taken over Morocco in the wake of World War II.\n\nThe film begins with Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo and his wife, Ilsa Lund, arriving at Rickâs CafÃ© Americain in Casablanca to obtain documents allowing them to flee the country. Rick was previously in love with Ilsa, but she had left him without explanation when the Nazis invaded Paris.\n\nWhen they meet again in Casablanca, they discover that both have moved on with their lives - Ilsa is now married to Victor and has joined him in his fight against the Nazis. Despite this, there remains a spark between them as they contemplate what could have been if circumstances were different. Ultimately, Rick struggles to reconcile his feelings for Ilsa while aiding her husbandâs quest for freedom.\n\nCasablanca won three Oscars in 1944 for Best Director (Michael Curtiz), Best Picture, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Julius J. Epstein & Philip G. Epstein). It was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Actor (Humphrey Bogart), Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, as well as Music for its soundtrack, including âAs Time Goes Byâ performed by Dooley Wilson.\n\nThe success of Casablanca cemented Humphrey Bogart's status as a Hollywood star while also propelling Michael Curtiz into one of the foremost filmmakers during the â40s and â50s.\n\nCasablanca Locations\n\nCasablanca is a timeless classic, and the production of this cinematic masterpiece took place in two regions: the Warner Bros lot in Burbank and the Metropolitan Airport at Van Nuys near Burbank. Most scenes were shot on the Warner Bros lot, with some of the sets from previous productions reused to add an element of realism to the story.\n\nThe backdrop of these locations provides an interesting contrast between a bustling city center, an exotic desert, and a romantic coastal locale. The Casablanca production team also made use of pre-existing film sets, such as the railway station leftover from Bette Davisâ Now Voyager.\n\nThe arrival of Captain Strasser at Van Nuys airport is especially memorable due to its distinct atmosphere and detailed architecture that perfectly complements the scene's suspenseful tone. This airport is open to visitors today, albeit under different management. Guests often remark on its tip-top shape, considering it remains relatively untouched since filming took place almost 80 years ago.\n\nWhether you are a fan of Casablanca or not, visiting these locations could be worth your while. Those who appreciate cinema will find themselves immersed in nostalgic bliss whilst others can enjoy appreciating landmarks that span generations.\n\nThe unforgettable opening scene in Casablanca is set in a bustling North African port city filled with transients, refugees, and criminals who have all come to the city seeking something different. It starts with Nazi villain Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt) disembarking an airplane hangar at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys, which provides a powerful contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nAs his plane flies overhead, the citizens of Casablanca are seen going about their daily lives; refugees fleeing Europe, gamblers and crooks looking for a way out, and resistance fighters clashed down by oppressive forces. At the center of it, all is Rick's CafÃ© AmÃ©ricain, a swanky nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart).\n\nThe famous scene has become an unmistakable representation of Casablanca during World War II, capturing the essence of life in this chaotic yet vibrant city. It also serves as a reminder that no matter where we come from or our circumstances, we can still find hope and strength in each other, the very message that lies at the heart of Casablanca.\n\nDuring renovations, the famous airplane hangar moved from Van Nuys to a Los Angeles parking lot in 2007. It was recently saved from demolition, with plans underway to relocate it to the Valley Relics Museum.\n\nFor those interested in visiting this Casablanca filming location, Van Nuys Airport is easily accessible via several major highways including I-405 and US-101N. The airport is situated just east of Los Angeles International Airport and is serviced by several commercial airlines as well as general aviation facilities. Once there, visitors can take a guided tour through the airport grounds to get up close and personal with some of its most famed landmarks.\n\nCheck Calabasas Filming Locations\n\nIlsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) are buying letters, which are crucial for them to escape and pursue their work in America. The setting of this scene takes place in Casablanca, at Rick's CafÃ© AmÃ©ricain. It is Rick Blaineâs (Humphrey Bogart) business, and he previously had a romantic relationship with Ilsa.\n\nWhen Ilsa fell in love with Rick in Paris, she thought her husband had died. Later, she found out that her husband was alive and returned to him without offering Rick an explanation who felt betrayed by her sudden departure. Later, when the club closes, Ilsa tries to explain herself, but Rick is too drunk to listen and refuses to hear her out.\n\nThe cafe and street scenes were filmed at French Street on the Warner Brothers Burbank Studios lot. French Street is a block that features three-story residences and storefront film sets designed in European style. It also includes a landscaped park, an interior cafÃ© that used to film some of the Gilmore Girls scenes, and the toy store from the feature Small Soldiers.\n\nThe second floor of the building has French windows with shutters, and some also have wrought iron railings. On the third floor, a mansard roof includes dormer windows. Visitors can tour this location and take a walk down memory lane from Casablanca. The tour also takes visitors through other sets from films like Gone With The Wind and A Star Is Born among other classics.\n\nTo get to this location, go to Warner Brothers Studio Tour Hollywood, which is located 14 minutes away from downtown LA and 2 hours away from San Diego via the I-5 N road. Tickets can be purchased online or from their official box office and there are various tour options depending on what kind of experience visitors are looking for.\n\nBurbank Filming Locations Scout\n\nThe unforgettable farewell scene was a dramatic ending to the film. The scene unfolds on the tarmac of the airport, as Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Renault (Claude Rains) have just taken down Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and his men. Rick and Renault then make a pact to join forces in their fight against fascism and depart Casablanca together.\n\nThe memorable scene is filled with tension, emotion, and a strong sense of camaraderie between two unlikely friends. As Rick and Renault walk away side by side, they exchange one of the movie's most famous lines: \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" This heart-warming moment serves as a powerful symbol of hope amidst the oppressive political climate of World War II-era Casablanca.\n\nAn airport wasnât the setting of the scene but it was actually filmed at Warner Brothers Burbank Studios on Stage 21.
