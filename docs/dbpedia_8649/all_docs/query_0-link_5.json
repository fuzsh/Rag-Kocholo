        "text": "Should the production section writeup in the manual of style be changed to insert new proposed text --Deathawk (talk)\n\nProposed version:\n\nA production section should not be an indiscriminate list of news and trivia associated with the making of a film, but should instead focus on how the film was developed. The section should be limited to events that impacted the production, not merely day-to-day business operations.\n\nAlthough announcements to the public can be noteworthy, production sections should primarily cover events from a production standpoint. For example, dates of when plot elements, settings were added should not be included; instead, include how the noteworthy elements of the production came about.\n\nDetails about casting should concentrate on how actors were found and/or what creative choices they added to the production, over simply a listing of dates they signed on. When dates are included. context should be provided to explain how this fits in to the overall production story. It is usually inappropriate to list casting dates for every actor involved\n\nReadability should be given high priority. Avoid sentences with repetitive phrasing. Present information in a clear and logical manner. While there are occasions when exact dates are useful, editors should apply caution when using them, in most cases simplay adding the month and year will suffice.\n\nA production section should provide a clear and readable story of how the film was developed, setting out the key events that affected its production, without detailing all of the day-to-day operations or listing every piece of associated news and trivia. Try to maintain a production standpoint, referring to public announcements only when these were particularly noteworthy or revealing about the production process. Focus on information about how plot elements or settings were decided and realised, rather than simply listing out their dates. Add detail about how the actors were found and what creative choices were made during casting, only including the casting date (month and year is normally sufficient) where it is notably relevant to the overall production story This version will be updated occasionally as such the timestamp attached to it, is not accurate. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nPS: This RFC previously used an incomplete draft version, as such the discussion may make reference to a \"Copyedited version\" that was supplied by @SMcCandlish:, this is now the only version I'm using. My old version can be found here. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nPSS: This revision is now changed to one provided by @MapReader:, which is the non struck through one, I know this is confusing and I'll be putting up another RFC shortly but I want to put this info out there so we can all critique it. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nBackground Info:\n\nOver the past couple of years or so Wikipedia has gotten sloppy on making good production sections. Often times they consist of people reporting every little thing they can find from sites such as The Hollywood Reporter to Variety, even if these has very little encyclopedic value or is of any interest to the readers. Often these come attached in simple sentences that, for lack of a better term, we at Wikipedia refer to as Proseline. The results in sections that are at best poorly done. and at worst difficult to even decipher. Over the years I've chatted with various editors who hang around and edit film articles and the consensus seems to largely agree with me, even if we could not come to a consensus of how to fix it. Looking at the Manual of Style for film, I noted that there was no detailed information about how to write a production section, so the above is my proposal for one. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nSurvey\n\nSupport the version above, as of the 08:56, 2 November 2017 (UTC) timestamp (the \"re-copyedited version\", I guess). I think it accurately reflects the lengthy consensus discussions above and below, and concisely gets at the central issues raised.\n\nCollapse-boxing my previous !votes, about previous drafts.\n\nOppose, as no longer reflective of the consensus discussions on this page. Support the copyedited version now given above. I think this accurately reflects the lengthy consensus discussions above, and concisely gets at the central issues raised. [The text has been changed again in key ways that make me no longer able to support it; see below.] — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ< 08:22, 24 October 2017 (UTC) PS: I removed my copyediting commentary about the original, since it's been replaced. 08:22, 24 October 2017 (UTC); updated — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\n— SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nCopyedited version looks Ok to me MapReader (talk)\n\nPedantic point but can we replace \"impacted\" with \"affected\"? Using \"impact\" as a verb is journalese - \"affect\" is the simple, plain verb. Popcornduff (talk)\n\nGood catch. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nThis suggestion is not integrated into the draft at this point, but it's a trivial enough copyediting change it discussed below. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nOPPOSE: Everyone has a right to know about a lot of things on filming operations. If we make these changes, it could severely limit the things that everyone will want to know, such as filming locations, when certain actors joined the filming set and provides sources that will confirm all this information. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nOk,so one thing, I didn't catch in @SMcCandlish: version was the change to the Exact date part of it, which now reads \"Exact dates are usually not needed, except for the most significant production milestones and any unusual events that attracted coverage in reliable sources.}}\" That's actually fairly different from what I had in my draft version, which was \"Exact dates, are usually not needed unless there is a significance to it. the \"it\" in my version is referring to the date itself, rather than an event that falls on the date. With everyone's permission I would like to change that particular passage back. What I'm trying to avoid is people overusing exact dates, which I fear the draft as it stands now, somewhat encourages.\n\nI'll have to strike my support if we go that route. This guideline, which verges on a WP:LOCALCONSENSUS, a WP:PROJPAGE, cannot contradict policy; noteworthy and relevant facts with reliable sources are permissible in all articles (i.e., they survive the WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE test), and when they are events they are generally dated for context or they don't make much sense to the reader. E.g., the death of Vic Morrow while filming the Twilight Zone movie was a big-news event, strongly affected the production, and should have a date in the article on the film, otherwise it will be unclear when it happened in the production timeline. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\n@SMcCandlish: I see what you're saying and, yeah the Twilight Zone is a good example of when an exact date is necessary, but I worry that the current proposed wording, leaves too much room for interpretation. For instance, would casting a director count as a \"Significant production mile stone\" would casting the lead be a \"Significant production milestone\" in that the case we're back to using exact dates indiscriminately. Is there any way we could word it better? --Deathawk (talk)\n\nAlready covered by \"For example, dates of when plot elements, settings, or casting choices were revealed should not be included\". The flip side of \"writing policy is hard\" is \"well-written policy is airtight\". People like me from an actual off-WP policy analysis background treat this kind of material as a flowchart. and Gedankenexperiment with it, with every example type we can think of, identifying every loophole anyone's likely to find. It might be feasible to narrow the wording of \"the most significant production milestones\", but I'm not sure how. I'm also assuming good faith that it's generally going to be interpreted as intended and that people trying to WP:GAME it to include dated trivia will be rare and will get reverted. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nI guess what I'm worried about though is that the wording is not airtight though, the draft specifically mentions that we include information that \"impacted production\" so, even though we don't permit most announcements via this, we still have to deal with things such as directors coming on board on big films and when leads joined and that sort of thing. The current wording suggest that exact dates would be appropriate for those things, when in reality they're not. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nA way to approach this might be to identify that the only exacting dates that should be included, assuming the typical course of a film's production, is the period of filming and it's premiere dates. Approximate dates (read: Month, Year) are fine for nearly all other aspects (when writing started, when casting started, when post-production occurred) if there is nothing unusual about a film's making, and even in considering the casting aspects, rote announcements should not be dated. The only time more date detail seems to be necessary is when there is a notable external event or non-normal event that a fixing a date within the production section should be necessitated. --MASEM (t)\n\nOne thing I think we might want to consider is talking about how to talk about casting sections. I wasn't really going to say anything about it and bring it up later, but if we're stuck on current language of the draft, it may be worth revisiting. I kind of want to include language that discourages editors from going down the billing block and listing every date someone signed up, I proposed above that only a couple of the leads should be listed which we couldn't really come to a consensus on. I propose something like \"while it is ok to list when certain actors signed on, restraint should be employed to make sure that listing do not get excessive. Much more emphasis should be given to how an actor came to a part and/or what creative decisions they chose to make\" I'm going to ping @TriiipleThreat: who raised issues with my last attempt to cover this topic. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nComment: What is different about this proposal compared to what you stated in the #List of points to cover section above, where I and others opposed? And why shouldn't we include \"dates of when plot elements, settings, or casting choices were revealed\"? Why do you want us to state \"should not\" instead of having more lenient wording, as is common for guidelines? Flyer22 Reborn (talk)\n\nThe discussion surrounding the proposal died out, around the time I created the first \"Draft\" section. I waited around two weeks for anyone to voice any objections and even pinged people, although nothing ever came of this. I incorporated the issues that came up in the discussion into my draft, which eventually was finalized by SMcCandlish. The feedback I got, that was reacted strongly too, was the inclusion \"Do this, don't do this\" attitude. This version of the draft does not not incorporate such language, instead telling the overall goal, and then giving people leeway. You're right though, a ban on the casting info was included, that I did not notice, I have now deleted that wording, and I would ask that @SMcCandlish: or others include a proposal to change the language to make it less \"black or white\".\n\nAs for your other concern regarding when plot elements or setting were revealed. This is to keep the production section focused on production and not turn into a mere preview of what the film will turn out to be. For the most part these elements tend to be dated very quickly. For instance,a year from now it won't matter that \"In July 2017 it was revealed that X will take place in Y field\". If you were to read that in 2018 it would make you wonder why it was included at all. Furthermore it's not, at any point serving an encyclopedic purpose. That's not to say that you can't write about why this setting was chosen, and in fact the wording does encourage you to do so. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nThe problem, in my mind, is that everything is dated, whether it's important or not. It's a real problem that exists in many articles. The sections become difficult to read because the content is buried under so much useless information. NinjaRobotPirate (talk)\n\nYes, I understand the WP:Dated concern. Flyer22 Reborn (talk)\n\nRemoval of \"or casting choices were revealed\" makes the draft no longer reflect the concerns in the prior discussions that led to this draft, and also makes Deathawk's new concern raised in this thread (which was addressed by that wording) a concern again. I.e., it effectively sabotages the entire thing. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nWhile there was a consensus among a few editors (You, me and I think another person) it ran into problems when we went to get a broader consensus as can be seen by the responses by Triiiplethreat and Flyer22 in this thread, as such it was left out of the resulting draft I proposed up there. That said I think should address it. The problem I see is that the blanket ban is to broad I proposed wording above that would state: \"\"while it is ok to list when certain actors signed on, restraint should be employed to make sure that listing do not get excessive. Much more emphasis should be given to how an actor came to a part and/or what creative decisions they chose to make\" @TriiipleThreat: @Flyer22 Reborn: would you be ok with this wording? --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI would change \"For example, dates of when plot elements, settings were added should not be included; instead, include how the noteworthy elements of the production came about\" to \"For example, dates of when plot elements, settings were revealed should be avoid; instead focus on how and when the noteworthy elements of the production came about.\" Again we're not advocating the removal of all dates but any dates should reflect the events of production, not when they were revealed to the public. Also I preferred the previous wording \"Exact dates, are usually not needed unless there is a significance to it\" over \"Exact dates are usually not needed, except for the most significant production milestones and any unusual events that attracted coverage in reliable sources\", which is less specific and allows for more editorial discretion. As for casting sections, I understand what you are trying to achieve but this would probably be better handled on the local level as the significance of supporting characters and cameos greatly very from film to film. I don't think there is a one-size fits all solution.--TriiipleThreat (talk)\n\nRegarding this, yeah, I could support that. Flyer22 Reborn (talk)\n\nI can't. The casting dates stuff is key to the entire proposal, since it's mostly what triggered the discussion to begin with, and was the central concern about bad production sections for many of us. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\n@SMcCandlish: I wouldn't mind if we tightened up my wording a bit, so that it's somewhere between the two extremes. I think there are definitely some casting decisions when a date is notable, although editors are often guilty of going to the extreme end of this. I also realize that from experience such a ban would likely not survive a vote, leaving us back to square one. However, yeah if you have any ideas for wordings that take into account both ends of it. I'd love to hear it. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI think this has train-wrecked, and should be reproposed in a few months after people have had time to mull it over. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nI agree with SMcC. Film and TV articles in particular seem to suffer from editors who think every tiny detail is automatically relevant, correspondingly reducing readability and accessibility for the general user. The dates on which particular actors were cast for a film or series is cruft, pure and simple, and only of any interest if one part was filled particularly early, or one proved difficult to cast and was decided very late. Otherwise it adds nothing except words to an article about how a film was produced. MapReader (talk)\n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't agree with you both in some way, in fact, in most ways probably. I do think excessive cast listings in a lot of articles are ridiculous. However I do worry about what we'd be removing from existing articles especially when they don't have a specific casting section. For instance the search for Spiderman in the new Spiderman movie is pretty important, and the date that goes along with that I feel is an important part of that. I'm really searching for a happy medium between the two extremes, and if anyone has any suggestions I'd love to hear them. @Flyer22 Reborn: you mentioned something about \"more lenient wording\" what do you propose? --Deathawk (talk)\n\nYes, we do need some sort of restraint, otherwise we might end up with utterly insignificant \"information\" as to when and why Joe Blow was chosen to be best boy/dolly grip instead of John Q. Public. --Redrose64 🌹 (talk)\n\nMapReader, how are \"the dates on which particular actors were cast for a film or series\" cruft? Should readers not know that Emilia Clarke was cast as Daenerys Targaryen in 2010? Are we stating that it's something we should read in the character and actress articles? If we look at the Game of Thrones article, there are dates regarding when conception, development and production began. It also includes when the first and second drafts of the pilot script were submitted. I see no problem with any of that. I find none of it trivial. And that is a television show article. I don't see why film articles, which will likely have less dates to cover, should be any different. The Casting section of the Game of Thrones article only includes one date, however.\n\nDeathawk, all I am stating is that I am wary of \"should not\" wording for the guideline. I have no proposal, but I might suggest something here or there. If it's something like mentioning the publications or minor details that are not at all needed, I obviously agree that this has very little encyclopedic value and is of little to no interest to readers. Mention of a publication, for example, should only be included if needed. I suggest \"strongly discouraged\" wording for the guideline in cases of excess. If you look at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Medicine-related articles#Citing sources, we do use \"do not\" wording for some things considered excessive, and we state \"The text of the article should not needlessly duplicate the names, dates, titles, and other information about the source that you list in the citation.\" Similarly, WP:In-text attribution states, \"It is preferable not to clutter articles with information best left to the references. Interested readers can click on the ref to find out the publishing journal. [...] Simple facts such as this can have inline citations to reliable sources as an aid to the reader, but normally the text itself is best left as a plain statement without in-text attribution.\" On side note: There is no need to ping me to this page since it is on my watchlist. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 15:16, 26 October 2017 (UTC) Flyer22 Reborn (talk)\n\nWe have standards in WP that stop well short of accepting that every tiny piece of information about a film is relevant for inclusion in the article. For casting, I suggest that any dates need to be pertinent to some story about the production. For example, as I said, if a particular actor was cast first and the rest of the cast assembled around them, or if one role was filled at the last minute. Otherwise my point was that it is simply trivial to think that the particular casting dates for each role is of any significance MapReader (talk)\n\nOk so after hearing some concerns here is what I could come up with \"Details about casting should concentrate on how actors were found and/or what creative choices they added to the production, over simply a listing of dates they signed on. When dates are included. context should be provided context in order to explain how this fits in to the overall production story. It is usually inappropriate to list casting dates for every actor involved\"\n\nWould that suit everyone? --Deathawk (talk)\n\nOther than typo (repeat of \"context\"), it seems fine, but what I did in the earlier copyediting run was way more concise on this point. I would suggest restoring that, then adding any necessary clarification/exception to it. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nLooking at your draft, I feel almost that it was too concise, and it read like a blanket ban on all casting dates. I removed it after I got a complaint that seemed to also be concerned about this. Since we all can agree that castingcrufft is a big part about why we're here, I feel it should be thoroughly expanded so we're crystal clear on the methodology. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI would kind of like to bring in @BattleshipMan: to this conversation, He and I, around a year or two got into a disagreement over casting sections. So I would like to possibly hear his input in the matter. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nCasting sections are there for reasons. It tells you when they joined the movie and there, at times, tells you who replaced some actors who originally joined that particular movie. That's among the reasons why we need them. As for the production sections, sourcing is an issue. When there are at times when some sources can be deemed unreliable to Wikipedia standards, but that it tells you some things about the production of the movies that you never hear from other sources. We do need to work on the wording of them also. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nI'm not really clear from your writeu.if your for the proposed wording or against. If not do you have any ideas for improvement? --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI'm bringing in @Darkwarriorblake: to this conversation. I want to hear his input on this matter also. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nOk so I added the proposed text on casting to the page, since we're concentrating on it so much, I feel it would be disingenuous to not included it for newcomers to the discussion. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI've tried reading through all this text so I think I understand the issue but I may be wrong so forgive me. First I don't think most dates should be exact, it should be \"in October 2017\" not \"on October 22, 2017\", unless several notable things happen in the same month and hte dates are relevant, i.e. something else happened like a scandal or something notable that caused casting to be changed in hours or over a very extended period of time. Dates of casting can also be interesting, for example on The Shawshank Redemption my research revealed that William Sadler was approached to star in the film like 3 years before production began. But this is a rare example. Typical casting, especially for less blockbuster films probably isn't notable and certainly wouldn't need dating unless a singular role had a lot of casting issues where people were cast and dropped out for instance. I hope this is an actually appropriate answer to what is being asked. Darkwarriorblake / SEXY ACTION TALK PAGE!\n\nWell, for production settings like filming locations. It should be \"in early October 2017 to late November 2017, filming took place in whatever location\". Pre-production should state on who the writers are, who's been cast in the movie, which essential crew members like directors & producers joined the set and anything essential to the pre-production. How in wording should be discussed further. The wording in post-production sections that involves visual-effects and such should be discussed also. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nI think that the coverage should depend on the film, for instance if you get Zach Snyder for tentpole blockbuster, than yeah that should be included, but for your average middle of the road flick, where you've got a writer on board, I don't think that's necessary, and is kind of what left us here. That's why it's worded \"The section should be limited to events that impacted the production, not merely day-to-day business operations.\" because for one movie casting a character, or finding financing may be significant but for others it would be unneeded and trivial, and if we describe that in detail it could cause production sections to get lopsided. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nBut everyone has a right to know about production stuff and filming locations in a lot of films. Filming locations in the majority of the films are just trivial to many, but many news information have where the movie was being filmed in lot of films these days and everyone would want to know about that. Also when actors have joined the film is also necessary information that people want to know about from various sources. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nWe aren't Variety, or The Hollywood Reporter though , putting when a random celebrity joined into a movie, just because they did serves no encyclopedic purpose, and as has been discussed, muddles up the article and makes it hard to read for everyone else. WP:NotNews actually outlinses this very well Per that policy For example, routine news reporting on things like announcements, sports, or celebrities is not a sufficient basis for inclusion in the encyclopedia. While including information on recent developments is sometimes appropriate, breaking news should not be emphasized or otherwise treated differently from other information. --Deathawk (talk)\n\n@Deathawk: Look at Changeling, which is a featured article. Look at the production section and see for yourself. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\n@BattleshipMan:I think you and I may be talking about different things, because skimming over the production section everything seems noteworthy and everything accomplishes the \"production story\". The Writers are mentioned because there is significant context to put something in there about the writing, the distribution is discussed similarly because there are things to discuss. What I'm talking about is that often production sections are created with \"X joined on Y date, XXX company joined on YY date.\" and you go through it, and there isn't anything you can expand on. My text is against the latter not the former. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nOk so I think we may be ready to vote. I redid the exact dates statement which now reads \"While there are occasions when exact dates are useful, editors should apply caution when using them, in most cases simply suplyingthe month and year will suffice.\" I think this is better than giving a list of exceptions as I don't think we could all agree on, what the exceptions themselves were. If possible I would like to get voting going again. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nEveryone, listen up. Anyone who hasn't read this matter should read this and make a decision in the voting sub-section. Anyone who has read this should read it again and make a decision in the voting sub-section below. We need to invite everyone who does film articles and such. So use the ping template with the user's name to get them in this discussion, like with the reply to template. Write SUPPORT: and OPPOSE: and state your opinion after that. If undecided, write COMMENT: to state what you see on the issues about this matter are. Let's get voting. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\n@BattleshipMan: Three points. One, you can't make anybody do anything - this is a volunteer project - if they choose not to take sides, that's their business. Two, We don't need a \"voting\" section below, when there is already a \"survey\" section above. Three, {{ping}} and {{reply to}} are identical: one is a redirect to the other. --Redrose64 🌹 (talk)\n\nI honestly think your being a bit too harsh here. He meant it as a way of rallying users, not as a command (at least that's how I read it). I would state though, that the proposed text, should now speak for itself. If you're interested in Wikipedia beurocracy, then go ahead read the whole discussion, but I don't it's mandatory reading. I just don't want to turn people off of voting because of the wall of text. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nYeah, I meant as a way to rally users to make a decision on this matter in anyway I know how. Whatever you agree with it or not, we need to solve this issue with all the help we can get. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nThere are some other copyedits to make, e.g. replacing \"and/or\" with \"or\", and \"in order to\" with \"to\", but they don't affect the meaning. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nI changed the \"To\" the \"and/or\" I think needs to be there as I don't want people interpreting it as an either/or situation. Although like I said below I'm not going to put a fight about it, if others are strongly opposed to it. --Deathawk (talk)\n\n\"And/or\" is virtually never needed except in constructions where it is vital to stress \"A, B, or both A and B at once\", e.g. in statutory language or in a software functional specification. \"Or\" does not imply \"either/or\"; an \"either A or B\" construction does that. Otherwise, virtually every \"or\" in policy and guideline pages (and similar writing throughout English) would be \"and/or\" at nearly every occurrence, but people do not in fact write that way. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nIn my opinion \"Impacted\" carries a bit more weight than \"affected\". My main concern here is that as it currently sits, the wording causes editors to think more about what to add. However if is truly a sticking point, I can change it. --Deathawk (talk)\n\n\"Impact\" as a verb is journalese and advised against by the style guide of the Guardian, for example. It ain't plain English. Other editors might disagree. Popcornduff (talk)\n\nIt's not a sticking point for me. I ack Popcornduff's position and agreed at first, but impact as a verb has become fairly regular English, since at least the 1980s. I'm also skeptical that a valid approach is declaring it journalese then using a journalism style guide – which MoS is not based on – against it. Dictionaries do not treat it as substandard [1][2][3][4][5], though some think the transitive form is chiefly American. It's more important that we retain the emphatic nature of the point than split hairs about prescriptive grammar notions. There may be some other word or phrase we could use (\"strongly affected\"?). Just \"affected\" by itself is weak, vague, and subject to easy WP:GAMING (\"production was delayed for 2 hours, and that's an 'effect'\"). — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nThe Guardian tries to avoid journalese. See this piece from one of the style guide editors: https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2014/jan/10/mind-your-language-amid\n\nI think your feeling that \"impact\" has a different meaning to \"affect\", and especially your suggestion that \"impact\" is more precise, is dubious. It seems reasonable to me to call production being delayed for 2 hours an impact. If emphasis is important then \"significantly affected\" would be clear, plain English, and presumably uncontroversial. Regardless, this is probably a debate for another time. Popcornduff (talk)\n\n\"Significantly affected\" would work fine.\n\nOn the side matters: As for \"impact\", I didn't say anything at all about it being more \"precise\". It simply conveys a more emphatic sense; that which impacts something else is generally thought to have \"made a dent\" or \"left its mark\" in a palpable way; it's a figurative not literal usage (though a literal one exists, referring to compression; one of the dictionary sources illustrates this with an example about trampled soil). I decline to argue any further about the implications or acceptance level of impact. Your position that it's somehow substandard has been disproven, and various dictionaries do not treat it as merely synonymous with affected. If citing all of the leading online dictionaries back-to-back has no [ahem] impact on your perception of the matter, then probably nothing will. Two people, arguing past each other, one from a modern linguistic description perspective about actual usage patterns, and one from a Victorian-style prescriptive grammar standpoint about technicalities and how things \"should\" be, is just not a productive use of time. And it really doesn't have anything to do with MOS:FILM's purpose (or WT:MOSFILM's). I took at face value initially that impact as a verb might be considered substandard, but the evidence is strongly against that position when it's examined.\n\nI beg to differ about The Guardian; they're the no. 1 source in British/Commonwealth English for style quirks that are found almost exclusively in journalism. They may be avoiding some aspects of journalese, especially headlinese (thought it still happens: \"'He was happy' Trump calls for death penalty over New York attack\" borders on gibberish). However, they wallow in many of the \"sins\" of news style that are especially unencyclopedic, and have introduced new ones. It's part of their branding, exactly as conservatism or \"preservatism\" of mid-20th-century English shibboleths is a hallmark of The New York Times and The New Yorker, and integration of Internet and other techie jargon and online writing style into journalistic prose is a marketing mechanism of Wired. Numerous news (broadly defined) publishers have an explicit practice of trying to set themselves apart from the competition by using divergent style to appeal to specific audiences. This mutual inconsistency and non-neutral pandering effect (and practices that veer wildly from neologistic to farcically obsolete) is one of many reasons we don't turn to them for style guidance, except in the rare case that they're near unanimous on something, and academic style guides do not address that matter (as was the case with MOS:IDENTITY, though some of the academic guides, which have much slower publication schedules, are finally catching up, and happily are in agreement with journo style guides on how to write about transgender people).\n\n— SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nAgree with SMcCandlish. \"Impact\" is plain English where I come from. I also see no reason why we should be following any procedures from The Guardian here. However, I also think \"Significantly affected\" sound like a good alternative. Huggums537 (talk)\n\nSMcCandlish, I didn't mean to put words in your mouth about impact being more precise. But you said \"affect\" was vague, suggesting, to me, that you think \"impact\" is less vague.\n\nAs for the other stuff - I'd be happy to continue this discussion somewhere else, but if everyone else loves \"impact\", I can live with it. I've said my piece. Popcornduff (talk)\n\nAh, I see what you mean. I was being [wait for it] imprecise. I didn't really mean that the word \"affect\" was inherently vague, but rather that its interpretation in this context would be, and maybe \"vague\" wasn't even the right word, more like \"wishy-washy\". I was dwelling on potential for system-gaming and wikilawyering, which is something I do any time we're working with guideline material, since not considering that angle very frequently leads to problems from that direction. It's another WP:Writing policy is hard consideration. Sorry if I came off as testy; I think I was in a gruff mood due to extraneous concerns (irritating situation of a freeloader my housemate has had around in here for 2 months). — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nIt is becoming difficult to see what specific text we are being asked to support, or otherwise. Regarding the drafts above, I would make the point that it is better for an MOS to set out, as clearly as possible, the aspirations it expects editors to try and achieve, with any \"do nots\" contained within the text as warnings. An MOS that is forced to lead off with the specifics of what is not being sought is, in my view, a weak piece of guidance. MapReader (talk)\n\nThat's also a fair point. I'd be willing to help redraft in that direction (it's probably mostly a matter of shuffling the material around). I've already suggested in user talk that this RfC is a dead stick (for attempting to get a consensus to add something to the guideline – it has been quite helpful for getting input, which is what RfCs were originally for). It would be better to wrap this up (maybe by removing the RfC tag, and continuing to redraft here), then do a new RfC with a new draft that leads with \"do\" and follows with \"don't\", after we think it's a version that will garner support, and have that new RfC widely \"advertised\", e.g. at WP:VPPOL. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nMy chief concern with this, is that we're at a point with production sections where we do need to tell people what not to do. I don't really even think it's being bossy. It's just editors literally do not know what to include and what not to include. Thus I don't really want to create a draft that tiptoes around the issues that we have. Although I'd be willing to look at a draft version by @SMcCandlish:, but I remain skeptical that such an issue could fully resolve our problem. In the meantime I did take the RFC out, as I agree it's best to start again, after we've settled everything. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nSure, but the idea appears to be to lead with the \"do\" then follow with the \"don't\" – not to delete the \"don't. Most of MoS is written that way (and parts that are not get changed to be written that way); it's served us well. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nExactly. My point wasn't that we shouldn't include some \"do nots\" where they are important and relevant. My point is that leading off with \"don't do this...\" exposes a failure to set out a clear positive vision of what the section should ideally achieve. The latter is also the better approach for motivating editors, rather than immediately diving into a list of undesirable actions. Active voice is better than passive.\n\nAs SMc has already said, mostly we just need to re-order what we have, perhaps something like this: A production section should provide a clear and readable story of how the film was developed, setting out the key events that affected its production, without detailing all of the day-to-day operations or listing every piece of associated news and trivia. Try to maintain a production standpoint, referring to public announcements only when these were particularly noteworthy or revealing about the production process. Focus on information about how plot elements or settings were decided and realised, rather than simply listing out their dates. Add detail about how the actors were found and what creative choices were made during casting, only including the casting date (month and year is normally sufficient) where it is notably relevant to the overall production story. MapReader (talk)\n\nRight-o. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nI'm also good with that. I'll give it a couple days so that if anyone strongly objects to it, they can make their voices heard, and then I'll open a new RFC. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI like some of the current draft of the production section ideas and it should be less trivial. Key events like what happened on set and such should be like that. Information on how the plot elements and setting should be encyclopedic as possible as stated above. What I think we should do in the casting part is only allow on how the actors were found, who has joined the film and what casting changes were made to replace the ones who were originally cast in the film, among other things that are essential to the production. We also need to figure how to work on production of filming locations while provide sources that are reliable enough because in a A Good Day to Die Hard, it was filmed in Budapest which served as a stand-in for Moscow. In the 2016 film version of Pete's Dragon, it was filmed in New Zealand town which is used as a fictional Northeastern U.S. town. That's among of the production things we should talk about. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\n@BattleshipMan: What specific issues with the locations do you think should be addressed? Is there a problem with how we are reporting it? Is it not being reported? --Deathawk (talk)\n\nAnd \"what casting changes were made to replace the ones who were originally cast in the film\" is almost always trivia. It's not if someone died or was fired in mid-production and a stand-in replaced them, or the entire production was restarted, at least with regard to scenes with that actor. Otherwise, it's no different at all from something like \"When Tolkien was writing his Middle-earth stories, 'Gandalf' was originally going to be the name of one of the Dwarves\". It's \"What if ... ?\" trivia, and we just don't care. We'd only care if the production were announced with a particular actor, this changed, and bunch of RS wrote about the change, in depth. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nRereading what Mapreader wrote I really don't think the section on casting needs any significant revision. This seems like an argument over when and if casting changes are notable but the wording to the proposed version,\"Add detail about how the actors were found and what creative choices were made during casting, only including the casting date (month and year is normally sufficient) where it is notably relevant to the overall production story\" adequately, I feel, addresses the notability issue. We've explained what we want, and our striving for, so let the editors hash out whether the cast changes our appropriate for inclusion. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI get it here. I like the current draft for the production section. What I'm concerned about is how do we address when certain joined the particular film. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nI don't think it specifically needs to be addressed, because editors will just kinda add these things naturally. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nI want to add my support for the current suggested redraft of this as of my timestamp. However, i also want it to be clear that production tabs are difficult to flesh out in most cases because such thourough details of production are left out of the press unless awards consideration or something similar is in the works. Thusly, the only way to get a satisfying tab, length wise, is to stretch what we do get to know - which may not be much but in most cases, it has to do. In my opinion, if listing dates is all that can be done in the case of minimal press, then it is all that should be done. However, if more can be done, then more should be done. Trim the thicker pieces of meat and fluff some of the thinner ones. I think that is something that should be considered. Just my thoughts. One last thing, as far as dates are concerned. I think filming times should be exact. Casting should be more general. For example, the film commenced principal production on October 3, 2017 and Brad Pitt joined the cast in late September 2017. TheMovieGuy (talk)\n\n@TheMovieGuy: We can still manage this information without overstuffing it with dates though. For most big movies it still possible to come up with a production section that reads well,even before promotion begins. We recently both collaborated on The Happytime Murders article and I feel we got that looking good without needing to fill it up with excessive details. For smaller movies where there is nothing to report, there is nothing saying that we have to stretch out facts in order to fill it out. \\--Deathawk (talk)\n\nI'm in an agreement with TheMovieGuy regarding the filming dates should be exact and the casting should be more general. I think it makes the wording in production sections somewhat more encyclopedic. For example, Gerard Butler joined the cast in early September 2017. Bryce Dallas Howard joined in late September 2017. The film commenced production on October 4, 2017. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nConsidering that this will affect film articles, and that there is a lack of substantial support for the proposed changes, and that the RfC isn't even active anymore, I'm not sure that I can agree to go ahead with any changes. Not only are there barely any general film editors on board, there are barely any outside editors supporting whatever proposed wording. This discussion has floundered with things being thrown against the wall here and there.\n\nAnd, again, no need to ping me to this page. It's on my watchlist. Flyer22 Reborn (talk)\n\nI took out the RFC because I'm planning on making a new RFC in a couple days that will, I think be easier to read. I think there is, at least in this discussion, support for Mapreader version of the text, and right now what we're doing is just making sure that we're all on the same page so next time the RFC comes up, we don't have to get into these long drawn out discussions. --Deathawk (talk)\n\nThat is kind of a general concern. Not a lot of editors might support the proposed wording. This discussion is also been going on for so long. We don't even know how to resolve this. BattleshipMan (talk)\n\nOk question, if I opened up a new discussion thread and RFC, like in an hour or so. We're all cool with Mapreader's proposed text right? --Deathawk (talk)\n\nMore or less. I would change first \"story\" to \"narrative\" and second \"story\" to \"history\". WP doesn't write stories, that's what fiction writers and journalists do. Other than that, it seems good to me. PS: There's no need to say the time stamp shown is inaccurate; just replace the timestamp after revision. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nOr, better yet, add something like Revised: ~~~~~ at the end, and leave the original timestamp. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nFair points. I am quite happy for the RfC to run with SMcC's improvements, if no-one objects? MapReader (talk)\n\nAn issue that comes up with just about every superhero film is that there are some who want to give it a more specific genre in the lead (such as wanting to label Captain America: The Winter Soldier a thriller or Deadpool a comedy). Because it was decided at some point that only the primary genre should be listed as such in the lead, this practice is frowned upon around these superhero articles. I bring this up because there is currently a disagreement regarding the short film No Good Deed, which is about Deadpool. I have listed it as a superhero short, but another user believes it is primarily a comedy. I was hoping for some additional opinions on this matter. Thanks, adamstom97 (talk)\n\nDeadpool is not a comedy. Having jokes doesn't make something primarily a comedy. Darkwarriorblake / SEXY ACTION TALK PAGE!\n\nPlease be reasonable; there's having jokes, and being filled with jokes. The latter is what clearly makes a film comedic. By your logic, a WWII theme in Saving Private Ryan doesn't make it a war film. Also, to add onto OP's point, there's superhero short, and there's superhero comedy short (which is what was advocated). The terms aren't mutually exclusive. Whether something should only be labelled \"superhero\" ought to be done on a case-by-case basis. Snuggums (talk / edits)\n\nWP:FILMLEAD is pretty clear on the matter that only the primary genre or sub-genre should be listed in the lead (lest we end up with users attempting to add a laundry list of genres). So yes, \"superhero\" would be the correct usage, because I don't believe we should view \"superhero [insert other genre here]\" as a \"sub genre\". In this case, comedy can of course be mentioned elsewhere in the article, but the genre should still be superhero. - Favre1fan93 (talk)\n\nI have not seen any of the aforementioned films so I cannot comment on the applicability of the labels, but it is reasonable to also state the type of film (i.e. animated/silent/short etc) in the lead along with the primary genre so I don't see a problem with describing No Good Deed as a superhero short film, if that is indeed what it is. Betty Logan (talk)\n\nWhat do most of the critics think of the short? Do they consider it a superhero comedy or just a superhero short? The plot sentence written doesn't seem like it's developed to be funny. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nI think everyone sort of agrees that it is a silly little short that plays into the character's signature humour, just as the films do. The way I see it is that it definitely has major comedic elements, but that is because it is about Deadpool who brings those elements. So it is a comedy because it is a superhero short, which would make superhero the primary genre. To elaborate on one of my previous examples, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is widely considered to be a political thriller, but those elements come from the fact that Captain America is an inherently political character. So in that case, again, the specific genre happens because of the superhero elements and thus superhero is still the primary genre. - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nI'd leave No Good Deed as a \"superhero short\". Some of the online reviews call it a teaser, [6] [7] [8] short film [9] but I don't see comedy plastered all over it like Spy Hard or Spy (2015 film) would be for spy fiction. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\n@Adamstom.97: Late to the party, But I wouldn't regard a \"short film\" as a genre but rather a medium.--TriiipleThreat (talk)\n\nI don't think I was trying to use short film as a genre, the issue was more the \"superhero\" part and whether it should be \"superhero comedy\". - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nI am a little concerned that folks are too narrowly construing the guideline as a suicide pact. The bit about genre is meant as a guide, not a rule. Its meant to prevent editors stuffing a half-dozen genres into a film that may only peripherally cover one or two.\n\nCurrently, there is an article, The New Mutants where it is a horror film that uses the superhero genre as a base. There are actually more refernces noting it as a horror film than as a superhero film (which is odd in and of itself).\n\nThe point is, this appears to serve as an example which tests that guideline's hard and festness. Thoughts? - Jack Sebastian (talk)\n\nI personally do not feel that this example is any different from the other ones we have discussed here. It is clearly a superhero film that they have decided to make and present as a horror film, and all the reliable sources coming out since the trailer was released talk about taking the superhero genre in a horror direction, or putting a horror spin on the X-Men franchise. - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nBecause Adam forgot to mention it (oops?), I will point out that we are at odds on this genre issue at the aforementioned article. I think that as long as we aren't adding a shopping list of genres, listing the ones a film(/series/etc.) strongly belongs in is encyclopedic. As I said, interpreting a guideline as the law is stupid and nonconstructive, imo. - Jack Sebastian (talk)\n\nUhhh ... you are the one who brought the discussion here...\n\nAnyway, the problem of a special exemption from the existing guideline here (rather than the problem of multiple genres in general, which I haven't really put much thought into) is that we are indeed trying stop huge lists of genres, and if we start saying specific articles don't have to follow that, then what will be stopping others arguing about including multiple genres at other articles? And for what? It's not like the article absolutely needs to list both in the first sequence. If the film is introduced upfront as a superhero film, and then horror is focused on for the rest of the article, then that gives about an accurate representation of the film's status as you are going to get. It's not like there is an actual genre of films out there that is \"superhero horror\" films, that is still two separate things that should probably be discussed separately. - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nComment: Not all comic book film adaptations are of the superhero genre, such as Riverdale, which is based on the Archie Comics. That would mean comicbook is the primary genre, while superhero/horror would actually be the subgenres. I took a look at your disagreement over at The New Mutants. Are there any sources to classify The New Mutants as a comicbook-horror? This sounds much better to me than the very weird looking superhero-horror. Also, these arguments that WP:FILMLEAD should be misinterpreted as, \"only one genre allowed\" are inaccurate. From WP:FILMLEAD: \"At minimum, the opening sentence should identify the following elements:...\". The implied meaning of \"at minimum\" here is that the sentence should, at the very least, include all of the elements, but could include more. This implication is further substantiated by the very next sentence, \"For other applicable elements to add...\". Also, the arguments that the horror element is already discussed in the body, therefore is not needed in the lead, are not supported by WP:FILMLEAD. The guideline clearly supports the opposite. From WP:FILMLEAD: \"...provide a summary of the most important aspects of the film from the article body.\", \"Genre classifications should comply with WP:WEIGHT and represent what is specified by a majority of mainstream reliable sources.\" If there are roughly equal amounts of sources classifying The New Mutants as Superhero and/or horror, then it's unreasonable for us to make someone do OR/SYN to tally up the votes to see which one it should be because we don't think it should be more than one, or just because superhero-horror looks stupid since we've never seen anything like it before. Similarly, we can't call it a superhero ourselves just because we think it fits better. If the sources have enough weight to justify labelling it one or the other, then we have to be fair and respect the spirit of the guideline rather than the letter of the law, even though we may disagree. I think superhero-horror sounds just as ridiculous as the next person, but we can't judge by our personal opinions or preferences if there are valid sources involved that dispute our preferences. Huggums537 (talk)\n\nSources are referring to it as a superhero movie that is styled or presented as a horror film. And no one is suggesting that the lead not mention horror at all, just that it not be included in the first sentence since that would go against what our standard practice is (as far as my experience has shown me). - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nIt's entirely normal to list more than one genre when something is of a \"crossover\" nature, e.g. a comedy superhero film (see Mystery Men), or a sci-fi horror movie (see Alien (film)). We just don't want people stacking up a long list of genres of which the film has minor elements. I.e., yes, the guideline is not a \"suicide pact\" and per WP:LAYWER, WP:COMMONSENSE, WP:CONSENSUS, WP:POLICY, and many other pages is to be interpreted in the spirit in which it's intended, not by niggling over exact wording. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nI just wanted to add that those who argue we need to keep the list of genres from \"getting out of control\", are absolutely correct, but there are plenty of other ways to support that argument such as WP:NOT, or WP:CRUFT. However, WP:FILMLEAD is not one of the ways to support that argument, and this contribution is hardly a case of WP:INDISCRIMINATE, or any other breach of getting \"out of control\", especially if there are sources to back it up. One problem is the awful tendency of editors to project fear about \"what will happen if we allow this\" onto other editor's contributions without objectively evaluating just the contribution itself. They wrongly focus on the projection of fears when they should be focusing on the contribution instead. Let me abate everyone's fears. What will stop others from creating huge genre lists? Lots and lots of things will stop it: WP:OTHERCONTENT, lack of sourcing, and we already mentioned NOT, CRUFT, and INDISCRIMINATE, just to name a few. So, there are tons of ways to stop people from creating a huge list of genres. This should not even be an issue, and the contribution itself doesn't violate any of these. In fact, as SMcCandlish pointed out, it's not uncommon to have double genres listed. However, I am confused about the sourcing because Adamstom.97 claims sources refer to it as a superhero, while Jack Sebastian claims there are more sources that refer to it as a horror. This is a messy situation because I'm supposed to assume good faith on both parts. Ultimately, I'd have to say that I support a duel genre listing provided the sources support it as well. Although, I sincerely hope that the sources don't support it since superhero-horror is just unsettling to me, but hey, what's unsettling to me might be exciting to other folks. Huggums537 (talk)\n\nI am in complete agreement with both Huggums and SMcCandlish here. I think most of the ported concern was that horror was being removed due to an incorrect interpretation of both what is supposed to contain as well as a largely unjustified concern over multiple genres might degenerate into. I agree with Huggums that there are several bulwarks in place to prevent CrazyCruft™ from being slipped into the article. So, no worries there, unless someone is married to shoehorning an unnecessary genre into the article (usually without any RS).\n\nAnd if there was any concern as to if my argument was about which genre should be listed as primary, those fears are displaced. The Lede is an overview of the article. The fact that there are abundant sources noting that the film is a horror film that also deals with superheroes should be enough proof to warrant inclusion in the article. If there are sources in the article, then it is in the Lede. Period.\n\nLeastly, to forestall any future arguments that the film should be classified as 'supernatural horror' (as per films like Carrie (2013 film), [[The Craft (film)]), the clear argument against such was that the source material was drawn from the comics. - Jack Sebastian (talk)\n\nWhile I do support including more than one genre if there is sourcing to back it up, I could find no evidence whatsoever of your claims that Carrie (2013 film) and The Craft (film) had any source material that were drawn from the comics. This causes you to lose a certain amount of credibility with your arguments, and makes me want to choose Adamstom.97's interpretation of the sources over yours. You really should have chosen better arguments, especially since I'm already of the mindset that superhero-horror sounds kind of like CrazyCruft™ anyway... Huggums537 (talk)\n\nStriking previous comment. I obviously misunderstood the meaning of Jack Sebastian's last comment. Apologize for any confusion... Huggums537 (talk)\n\nOk, I took the liberty of actually looking at the existing sources within the article, and it looks to me like it is very obvious it was the intention of the creators to make The New Mutants a comic book horror flick. They even said as much. Yes, there are a minority of sources that call it a superhero movie, but the majority refer to it as a horror. Much to my relief, I found that at least four of the existing sources also refer to it as a comic book movie: [10] , [11] , [12] , [13]. I suggest we change the existing genre from superhero-horror to comicbook-horror, or something along the lines of comic adaptation-horror. Maybe even horror-comic book adaptation would work. This is much easier on the eyes and probably more appropriate since it doesn't look like there are going to be any \"superheroes\" saving the day in this movie. No costumes? Just a bunch of kids locked in a \"haunted asylum\" with powers they are only just beginning to understand? That doesn't sound like any superhero movie I've ever heard of, and if it's not a recipe for a horror flick then I don't know what is. The comics themselves might have been superhero related, but the film is most definitely a departure from that theme. Huggums537 (talk)\n\nIf people do think that we should not be calling this a superhero film, then is there any reason to go back and change other articles? Deadpool, for example? Do we still think that is a superhero film, or is it a comedy? As far as I can tell, the main criteria we have had for calling these \"superhero films\" is that they are based on superhero comic books. - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nI would also like to point out that the most recent source for New Mutants that we have (in the post-production section of the article) still describes it as a horror movie within the superhero genre, which is what I always intended to get across with my wording. I'm not trying to say that it isn't a horror movie, just that it primarily comes under the superhero genre. I am also opposed to some sort of \"superhero-horror\" or \"horror-comic\" hybrid title, as those indicate that there is such thing as the \"superhero-horror\" genre, which I do not believe there is. How about an alternative wording proposal that we can apply to other films if we feel it is apporpriate: The New Mutants is an upcoming American horror film in the superhero genre, based on the... I think that accurately reflects what the sources are saying. - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nI like where your proposed wording is going since it takes into account both representations of the horror, and superhero aspects of the sources. As far as No good Deed goes, it could be listed as many things; Superhero, comedy, short film, even fan film. Of course, only two of those labels can actually be considered genres. So, I like your idea for an appropriate alternative wording that can be applied to other films like No Good Deed, or Deadpool. Deadpool is pretty funny, which set it apart from all the rest of the superhero films that had been coming out. So, I think there should be some wording to reflect the comedy aspect of it, provided the sources support comedy being a genre of the film. Huggums537 (talk)\n\nI also like Adam's wording. I think this would work for the Halloween film articles, which list them all as slasher films. Maybe say \"Halloween (whichever film) is an American horror film in the slasher genre\"? Foodles42 (talk)\n\nSounds practical. \"Horror\" is over-broad as a genre per se; includes everything from zombie flicks and serial killer stuff, to ghosts and creepy aliens. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nAlright, I think I'll implement my wording, and then assume that no other article needs to change unless someone else takes issue with how they currently are (and then further discussion can take place). - adamstom97 (talk)\n\nI think that wording works out well, and is more clear for the reader. Good job. - Jack Sebastian (talk)"
