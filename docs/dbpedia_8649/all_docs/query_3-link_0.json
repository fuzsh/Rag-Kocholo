        "text": "2023 National Film Registry: Librarian of Congress Announces the 2023 National Film Registry\n\nNominations are now being accepted for the 2024 National Film Registry External\n\nDeadline for Nominations is August 15, 2024\n\nThe Library of Congress invites you to submit your recommendations for the 2024 National Film Registry. Public nominations play a key role when the Librarian and National Film Preservation Board are considering their final selections. To be eligible for the Registry, a film must be at least 10 years old and be \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nRegistry criteria does not specifically prohibit television programs, commercials, music videos or foreign productions, however, the original intent of the legislation that established the Registry was to safeguard U.S. films. Consequently the National Film Preservation Board and the Librarian of Congress give first consideration to American motion pictures.\n\nThe Registry is intended to reflect American society and the rich tapestry of American cinema since its inceptions around 1890. To that end, we strongly encourage the nomination of the full-range of American film-making: not just Hollywood classics or other well-known works, but also silent era titles, documentaries, avant-garde, educational and industrial films, as well as films representing the vibrant unmatched diversity of American culture, both in terms of content and all those who created these snapshots of America society: directors, writers, actors and actresses, cinematographers, and other crafts.\n\nLooking for ideas on possible films to nominate? Check this list of films for hundreds of titles not yet selected to the National Film Registry. View the complete list of films currently on the Registry.\n\nYou may recommend up to 50 titles per year through our online nomination form External."
