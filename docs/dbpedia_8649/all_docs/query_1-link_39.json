        "text": "The Orpheum Theatre now offers cashless concessions, a cash-free experience where only card and mobile payments are accepted. This allows for limited direct contact between guests and employees and expedites the purchasing process for all guests. For guests who prefer to pay in cash, a Cash-To-Card option will be available to exchange cash for a loaded Visa card (currently available in increments of $25 and $50). The prepaid Visa cards are available at no extra cost and can be used at all Orpheum concessions and bars. Any remaining balance left on the card can be used anywhere that Visa is accepted worldwide.\n\nCOVID-19 Event Day Info\n\nPlease visit our COVID-19 Info page to familiarize yourself with our new health and safety measures and “What To Expect” prior to attending an event at the Orpheum Theatre.\n\nSome of the health and safety measures we’re implementing will include:\n\nContactless ticket scanning.\n\nStaff and volunteers will regularly wipe down and disinfect high touch point areas.\n\nHand sanitizer stations will be located throughout the theatre.\n\nAll staff, volunteers, and contractors will routinely wash/sanitize their hands.\n\nCashless concessions and bars.\n\nAny updates to these procedures will be noted and updated here and on the COVID-19 Info page.\n\nCOVID-19 Warning\n\nWe are enhancing our health and safety measures for patrons, volunteers, staff, and visiting artists.\n\nAn inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present.
