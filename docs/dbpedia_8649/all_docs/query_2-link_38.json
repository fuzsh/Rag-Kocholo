        "text": "Among the works that entered the public domain on January 1, 2023, the movie Casablanca certainly attracted a lot of attention.\n\nRightly so. It’s one of the best loved Hollywood films of all times. In 1977, it was the most frequently shown movie on U.S. television.\n\nThe Tomatometer on the Rotten Tomatoes site, which aggregates reviews for movies and TV series, gives it a score of 99% (134 reviews).\n\nThe Writers Guild of America West considers its screenplay the greatest of all time.\n\nThe film achieved a \"near-perfect entertainment balance\" of comedy, romance, and suspense.\n\n— Bob Strauss (April 10, 1992), Still the best: Casablanca loses no luster over time. Los Angeles Times\n\nSource: Wikipedia Casablanca (film)\n\nAuthorised adaptations\n\nA movie like Casablanca actually comprises multiple artistic works: the screenplay, the movie as an adaptation of that screenplay, plus the stage play that inspired it.\n\nVarious other adaptations of the original screenplay were authorized and produced, including for radio in the 1940s and for television in the 1950s and 1980s. In 1998, Warner also authorized the publication of Michael Walsh’s novel As Time Goes By based on the screenplay.\n\nIn order for those adaptations to be produced at that time, permission was needed from the copyright owners and, undoubtedly, copyright royalties had to be paid.\n\nNow, 70 years after the death of screenwriter Philip G. Epstein in 1952, the screenplay for Casablanca can be used freely and without limitation by anyone.\n\nWhy does copyright exist?\n\nCopyright is intended as a way to protect the ability of copyright owners to generate revenue from their creative content. The copyright owners are usually the authors and their heirs.\n\nAnother motivation behind the Copyright Act is to promote the creation of new content.\n\nLet’s be clear: ideas, facts and raw data aren’t covered by copyright.\n\nWhen a work comes into the public domain\n\nWhat happens when content enters the public domain and becomes copyright-free?\n\nYou don’t need permission to reproduce or use content in the public domain.\n\nThose works are free to be copied, shared, developed, adapted or used by everyone without having to request authorization or pay any copyright royalties.\n\nMoral rights expire at the same time\n\nEven though the moral rights related to a creative work can’t be assigned, they expire at the same time as the right to control the use of the content after the work comes into the public domain.\n\nAt that point, the content can be misappropriated or distorted. In other words, it can be used in a way that’s contrary to the original creators’ intent.\n\nExample of misappropriation: associating a work with a cause that wouldn’t be endorsed by the artist who originated that work, such as a progressive song being used in a right-wing politician’s campaign.\n\nRead more: Stop the music! Chorus of artists tell Trump to tune it down\n\nHow to calculate when a work will enter the public domain\n\nIt’s important to understand that the time limit for copyright protection varies according to the territory where it’s applied (rather than the author’s country of origin).\n\nDepending on the country, copyright lasts for the author’s lifetime plus 30, 50, 70 or 90 years.\n\nLocal legislation may contain other provisions, particularly if the rights are held by a corporate entity.\n\nDate of the author’s death or the work’s publication?\n\nIn the U.S., the screenplay for Casablanca became copyright-free 70 years after Epstein’s death.\n\nInstead, the date could have been 95 years after the work’s publication.\n\nIn the United States, copyrights owned by an author generally last for 70 years after the death of the author, while a corporation’s copyright lasts 120 years from creation or 95 years from publication, whichever expires first.\n\nCelebrating A Treasure Trove — The Public Domain, The TEDx Vienna Magazine\n\nCasablanca’s copyright wasn’t renewed\n\nSurprisingly, the copyright on the hit film released in 1942 was never renewed. If it had been, copyright protection would’ve lasted 95 years and the work wouldn’t have entered the public domain until 2037.\n\nAnother unexpected fact: in Canada, the movie has been in the public domain since 2003!\n\nUntil very recently, copyright protection in Canada expired 50 years after the author’s death.\n\nHas this changed with the new legal provisions that came into effect on December 30, 2022?\n\nPublic domain on hold in Canada\n\nIn 2018, Canada signed the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement, which contained clauses calling for standardization among the three countries’ copyright regimes.\n\nUnder the agreement, Canada was required to amend its copyright legislation by December 31, 2022 to make the term of copyright correspond to the author’s lifetime plus the 70 years following their death.\n\nWhen the federal government adopted the Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures, it included a provision extending copyright protection for 70 years after the author’s death.\n\nThat means no new works will come into Canada’s public domain for the next 20 years!\n\nRead more: Copyright will soon be extended in Canada\n\nThis change isn’t retroactive\n\nHere are some real-life examples to illustrate how it works: creative works by Quebec poet Hector de SaintDenys Garneau, who died in 1943, have been copyright-free for 20 years and will remain in the public domain because the change to Canada’s Copyright Act isn’t retroactive.\n\nHowever, works by Italian writer, journalist and painter Dino Buzzati, who died in 1972, would previously have come into the public domain in Canada on January 1, 2023 but will now have to wait until January 1, 2043.\n\nAlso, when counting 70 years, the timeframe doesn’t start until the year has ended. Works such as Lord of the Rings by Tolkien, who died in 1973, would’ve entered the public domain in Canada on January 1, 2024 but will now remain protected by copyright until January 1, 2044.\n\nThe same applies to Pablo Neruda and Picasso, who both died in 1973. Their works won’t become copyright-free for another 21 years."
