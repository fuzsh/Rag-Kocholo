        "text": "Sometime in the sixties, a mythic event occurred in Harvard Square. At the Brattle Theatre, during a showing of “Casablanca,” the sound failed in the last scene, and the assembled worshipers, speaking as one, intoned the famous final line: “Louis, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.” It’s just possible that the story is true. In the entire history of American cinema only a few other movies—“Gone With the Wind,” “The Wizard of Oz,” “The Godfather”—have been loved as much and as well as “Casablanca.” After seeing it on television for years, or suffering through a chewed-up print in a broken-seat revival house, moviegoers will have a chance to witness a freshly struck print this Wednesday, March 21st, on large screens. “Casablanca” is seventy years old. For one day, it will be playing all over the country. It’s worth going: the most familiar movie in the world is still fresh; it has so many little busy corners to nestle in.\n\nThe universal adoration has been produced by an unrepeatable combination of impudent wit and doomed romanticism, all of it held together by voluptuously emotional anti-fascist sentiment. Politically, “Casablanca” is a very knowing film. Several people in the movie refer to the not-so-hidden earlier activities of Humphrey Bogart’s saloon keeper Rick Blaine—running guns to Ethiopia and fighting in Spain on the Loyalist side (“and well-paid for it each time,” as he acidly notes). The vast American theatre audience of the forties (eighty to ninety million people a week) was expected to know what all that referred to, and why it was the right (that is, left) and smart thing to do in the thirties. Rick helped Haile Selassie take on the Italian fascists, and helped the Spanish Socialists fight Franco. Among other things, the movie is a desperate appeal to the honor of the French, who had gone down meekly before the Nazis, and a poke in the ribs to sleeping Americans: Get into this war and win it. “Casablanca” was completed in 1942, but it’s set in December, 1941, the time of Pearl Harbor.\n\nAs for myself, everything I know about history is derived from the prologue. A slowly spinning globe sits in a fleecy tuft of clouds, and a dour March of Time voice outlines the refugee situation during the war. We see documentary footage (the trudging homeless) and an animated map—an inky line movies from Paris to Marseilles, from there to Oran, and finally to Casablanca, where the lucky ones escape via Lisbon and the rest “wait…and wait…and wait.” Stranded (“I will die in Casablanca”), they congregate at Rick’s American Café, a vast white stucco cavern, with arches, interior rooms, potted palms, a bar, a bandstand, an upstairs office. It is the Big White Nightclub of so many Hollywood movies in the thirties and forties movies, made exotic by men in fezzes. A more astonishing collection of scoundrels, innocents, and cynics has never been brought together in one place. There are refugees and black marketers, defrocked bankers and resistance fighters, gamblers, floozies, French colonial policemen, American and Spanish entertainers, and, eventually, Nazi officers (who in reality never set foot in Casablanca). It is all of Europe, monitored by a cynical American and his black sidekick at the piano (the very talented actor Dooley Wilson, who was taught to sing for this movie, with memorable results). Except for an earnest young wife who is willing to sell her virtue to get herself and her husband out of Casablanca, there isn’t a dull one among them. “Casablanca” is the most sociable, the most companionable film ever made. Life as an endless party.\n\nThe opening scenes are a series of preposterously barbed encounters. All these people are stranded in unoccupied France—colonial Morocco—with its unfathomable protocols of safety and risk. Fascists and anti-fascists insult one another and get away with it. It’s almost a sport: who can make the most insinuating remarks? Rick’s old girlfriend Ilse Lund (Ingrid Bergman) shows up with her noble resistance-fighter husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), and they, too, immediately go to the café and trade insults. All of this is nonsense, of course—no underground leader would show up in a tropical white suit in a night club with his gorgeous wife on his arm—but the movie takes place in a magic space, the blissful imagining of big-studio Hollywood, a playground for the knowing, the sexual, the witty, the risk-takers.\n\nConrad Veidt’s Major Strasser, an elegant Nazi with precise diction, keeps hissing threats at Laszlo, but Strasser’s power is limited. Casablanca is actually run by two men of the world, the corrupt prefect Louis Reynaud (Claude Rains) and Rick, the American freebooter; and it’s swayed by a minor deity, Senor Ferrari (Sidney Greenstreet, who wears a fez and speaks in a British accent). Ferrari proudly refers to his elevated status as “the head of all illegal activities in Casablanca.” Clearly a man of substance, it’s his party, too. Everything is negotiable in Casablanca, where the sternest idealism and the most obvious larceny are in constant touch. We want the world to be like this—fast, allusive, morally compromised, and noble at the same time. Every night, Rick the alcoholic saloon keeper puts on a white dinner jacket and presides over his tumultuous playpen.\n\n“Casablanca” was based on “the world’s worst play” (according to James Agee)—an unproduced work, “Everybody Comes to Rick’s,” by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. An anonymous Warner Bros. story analyst in New York, reading it in manuscript, nevertheless reported the alluring presence of “sophisticated hokum.” The most important producer at Warner, Hal B. Wallis, who had just signed a deal giving him unlimited control over the pictures he worked on, began assembling a script. The usual accounting of this tortuous process goes like this: Screenwriter Casey Robinson fleshed out the romantic entanglement of Rick and Ilse; the twin brothers Julius and Philip Epstein worked on the structure; and Howard Koch handled the politics and toned everything up. The men gathered at Wallis’s farm, in the San Fernando Valley, and blended the different parts together. (Koch remained with the production and re-wrote parts of it as it was shot.) Wallis dismissed the studio’s gruesome initial choice of actors (Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan), got turned down by George Raft (who was offered the part of Rick), and then traded, for one picture, Warners’ star Olivia de Haviland to David O. Selznick for the young womanly Swedish beauty Ingrid Bergman. Finally, with Bergman and Bogart, who was grumpy and dissatisfied, in tow, he began production in Burbank, in April, 1942. The Warners staff director, Michael Curtiz, an exiled Hungarian Jew, was in charge.\n\nThat mélange of screenwriters produced some adorably terrible lines, including the much appreciated “Victor, please don’t go to the underground meeting tonight.” But it also produced such famous bits of insolence, as the exchange between Rick and Louis (“I came to Casablanca for the waters.” “Waters? What waters? We’re in the desert.” “I was misinformed.”), and, of course, the single best use of the passive voice in movie history: Rick plugs Strasser, and Renault says to his men, “Major Strasser has been shot. Round up the usual suspects.” As the production moved along, no one knew how the story would end—an uncertainty which, it is commonly believed, enhanced Ingrid Bergman’s anxiety, playing into her extraordinarily touching performance. Wallis and Curtiz eventually agreed to shoot Howard Koch’s preferred ending, with distraught Ilse, still in love with Rick, going off with Laszlo to America, and Rick and Louis going off together into the fog. (In Morocco? Fog? Never mind.) Wallis himself apparently wrote the closing line. In the end, the American cynic, the selfish bastard who “sticks his neck out for nobody” but gets things done, agrees to fight the Nazis. The Axis powers are doomed.\n\nIn real life, the place that everybody came to was Hollywood in the thirties and forties. In the fascist period, Los Angeles was the arts capital of the Western world. Stravinsky and Schoenberg and Otto Klemperer were there, as well as Thomas Mann, Bertold Brecht, Lion Feuchtwanger, Hanns Eisler, and many, many others. The studios were crawling with European musicians, actors, and directors. Wallis put together the staggering cast, which included Peter Lorre, Greenstreet, Veidt (who had been a major star in Germany), Marcel Dalio (the star, a few years earlier, of Renoir’s “Rules of the Game”), Leonid Kinsky (the lecherous bartender), and S. Z. Sakall (the chubby waiter Karl), mainly out of Warners’ pool of contract players. The commissary at lunch, with its mix of nationalities and accents, may not have been all that different from Rick’s Café. The people there are all desperate for work, desperate to find a home, yet happy to be alive and stuck in an absurdly sunshiny place in a naïvely optimistic country. The combination of European bitterness and American joy made “Casablanca” possible. America will save Europe. American movies will save Europe. When Victor Laszlo leads the demoralized French in the “Marseilles,” and even Yvonne, the chippy who is sleeping with a Nazi officer, joins in, the stoniest intellectual collapses in tears. It never fails, no matter how many times you’ve seen it. Kitsch has never been so powerful.\n\nKenneth Tynan called the movie “a masterpiece of light entertainment,” which, I think, strikes exactly the right note. You can’t take any of “Casablanca” seriously—but then, you are not meant to. The breathless excitement of the last third, with its reversals at gunpoint, is laughably melodramatic, and you laugh at yourself for being so caught up in it. Michael Curtiz, a very skilled director, keeps the camera moving through the café, rushing from table to table like an eager waiter. In the Paris flashbacks, he sustains the high-romantic tone of ardor and rain-soaked disillusion. He’s good at all the small atmospheric things going on in corners—the people selling each other something or desperately drinking or gambling. The closeups of Bergman, lit by cameraman Arthur Edeson (who also shot “The Maltese Falcon”), are uniformly ravishing. The general level of craftsmanship and Burbank Orientalism is superb. It would be hard, however, to see much of Curtiz’s point of view in the material. The auteurs of “Casablanca” are Hal Wallis and the long-ago big studios themselves—their atmosphere and talents, with corruptions and generosities all mixed together—what André Bazin called “the genius of the system.”"
