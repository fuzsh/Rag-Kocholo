        "text": "Casablanca is widely remembered as one of the greatest romance films of all time, and with good reason. The relationship between Rick and Ilsa is one of the most memorable romances in the history of Hollywood. Full of iconic lines and moments, the scenes between the couple make for one of the most justifiably tragic love stories on film, and all accompanied by the melancholy tune: ‘As Time Goes By’.\n\nYeah, Casablanca is a romance all right, but, as always, there’s a lot more to it than that.\n\nSee, genre, as it applies to film, has less to do with the setting, and more to do with the events of the film itself. The themes, the story, the ideas in a film are more intrinsic to it’s genre than where (or when) the film is set in. The way to discover a genre has more to do with what type of story it is than the setting of the story.\n\nSuch is the case for Casablanca.\n\nCasablanca displays elements belonging to a wide variety of genres, including romance (obviously), drama, war, thriller/suspense, film-noir, and even a dash of comedy here and there. You see, no film possesses the qualities of only one genre, but it’s rare that a film covers quite so many as this one does. That’s why today, we’re going to be going through each genre that this film contains shades of, and seeing how they apply. More specifically, seeing which genres are the primary genres for this movie, and which are not.\n\nLet’s start with the oddball: Comedy.\n\nMost people would be very hard pressed to call Casablanca a comedy by any stretch of the word. Most of the film, and the characters within, are very grim, and for good reason: World War II is on the horizon, and Europe is already suffering under German occupation. There doesn’t really seem to be much of a source for laughs.\n\nHowever, one of the greatest things about Casablanca is a razor-sharp script that’s packed to bursting with great, quips, usually courtesy of Rick or Captain Renault. The humor, while delivered in the driest fashion, is just what’s needed to ease the tension of the film, and sometimes is enough to get a genuine laugh out of the audience, but again, no one would make the mistake of calling Casablanca a comedy.\n\nA film-noir on the other hand? There’s a much stronger argument for that.\n\nThe term ‘film noir’ most closely translates to ‘dark film’, and is a category of film known for including elements like cynical protagonists, dark lighting, and an extremely pessimistic outlook. If that’s the criteria, Casablanca would seem to more than fit the bill, with one of the most cynical protagonists in film history and an intially incredibly bleak viewpoint. But there’s one problem with that.\n\nCasablanca, while starting out as a dark, pessimistic look at the world in the face of World War II, ends as an idealistic film with a romanticist protagonist. While one could argue that it starts out as a film-noir, there’s no doubt that it becomes something else by the end. Rick’s change from cynic to idealist is one of the most memorable aspects of the film, firmly placing Casablanca in a realm totally different from that of the film-noir by the end, even if it was one in the beginning.\n\nHow about thriller?\n\nThere is a lot of suspense in this film. The characters (and the audience) have a lot to worry about, and there are some pretty big stakes here, all boiling down to the central concern: Will Ilsa make it out of Casablanca, and if so, with who? There are a lot of possible outcomes to be had, and the audience is on the edge of their seat to see what happens to the letters of transit, and the characters who are after them. Like I said, there’s a lot of suspense in the film, but the thing that prevents Casablanca from being a thriller is simply that it’s not the focus.\n\nSo what is the focus?\n\nThe focus of Casablanca is in its characters, the personal relationships between them, and how they deal with the oncoming threat of war. The friendly-enemy dynamic of Renault and Rick, the love Ilsa has for both Victor and Rick, the relationship Victor has with Ilsa; this film is about people, and how they relate to one another. It’s a very character-driven piece, and as a result? The film is a drama.\n\nTechnically, Casablanca is a drama/war/romance film, and as a matter of fact, that’s incredibly accurate. The interpersonal dynamics between the characters drive the film, but it is, of course, the romance that the plot is really centered around.\n\nLove changed Rick Blaine’s life, for the better, overall. It is his love for Ilsa that shapes and drives his character through most of the film, leading to his decision to be more involved in the world’s problems. Like I said at the beginning of this article, it is their love that gives us the most memorable scenes in the film. While the drama provides the background driving force, it is the romance angle that is the main thrust of the film, the emotional punch that the viewers feel at the end.\n\nThe odd-genre-out would seem to be war. After all, there are no battles, and the heroes are not soldiers, at least, not at the moment. So, why war?\n\nFor the same reason it’s a drama: that’s the focus of the movie.\n\nUnlike some films set in the 1940s, there is no plot for Casablanca without the war. Every action taken by the characters is a direct result of the German invasion and occupation. It is the reason the characters are in Casablanca in the first place, and the reason they cannot leave. It was the war that tore Rick and Ilsa apart, and the war that brought them back together, and it is the war that forces Rick to take a stand in the world’s affairs and pick a side. The oncoming storm of World War II drives the interpersonal conflict and drama, which drives the romance plot. It’s a domino effect of genres, and it’s extremely effective.\n\nBut there is one other way to tell what genre your film is, and that is quite simply: the protagonist. In this case, it’s Rick Blaine.\n\nThe definitive test for what genre a film is has, in my opinion, quite a lot to do with what type of protagonist your story has, and how they interact with the story. In the case of Rick Blaine, it can be very easily argued that Casablanca is a film noir after all. He’s even played by Humphrey Bogart, the king of film-noir. He’s even shot using the same camera-tricks used for other film-noir films at the time. But for the same reasons I listed above, Rick is prevented from being a film-noir protagonist by his own character development. By the end of the story, he is no more a neutral cynic, he is an involved idealist, a romanticist, a crusader for the Good Side.\n\nSo, what kind of protagonist is Rick?\n\nA dynamic one.\n\nLike I said, the character of Rick goes through a bit of development throughout the story of Casablanca. He interacts with plenty of different characters in very distinct ways, and his relationships with all of them are perfectly realized, and his internal struggles are perfectly clear to the audience without any explanation, as is his love for Ilsa.\n\nIn short?\n\nRick Blaine, while beginning the story as a traditional, film-noir-esque character, ends it as a dramatic, dynamic character, driven by love and the oncoming war. An idealist, returning to his roots and fighting on the side of the angels. As a result, Casablanca is a romantic war drama, focusing equal attention on each genre, while also mixing in a few flavors of other film styles for added distinction. There really is something here for everyone, and it’s that, combined with a winning script and great characters, that have allowed this movie to hold up as well, and as long, as it has.\n\nStay tuned for next time, when we’ll be discussing the many interesting characters that wander in and out of Rick’s during the course of the film. Thank you all so much for reading, and don’t forget that the ask box is always open for questions, comments, or just to say hi. I hope to see you all in the next article!"
