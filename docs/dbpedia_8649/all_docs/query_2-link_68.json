        "text": "Shot 1: As we all know Casablanca was and still is one of the most famous movies. In shot one the cinematography utilize many different techniques. For example, in shot one I see a medium shot and a low medium angle when Victor and Rick were talking or arguing. Another, strength of Casablanca is the black and white lighting. In my opinion, the director made a crucial decision in shot one, the performance of both Victor and Rick standing in front of the frame with great lighting and few shadows behind. As viewer, I did notice loudness and sounds in the background however, it didn’t bother me because I was concentrated listen to Victor. In shot one I can tell Victor Laszlo face expression of anger against Rick Blaine. Referring to the lighting …show more content…\n\nIn shot two we see a long medium shot giving the focal length in the distance from the center of the lens to the point where the men were sitting and standing. In shot two, as viewer I notice many different things were happened. First, the solder men seen to stand-up and started to sign against the other group of people. Second, the lens has a specific depth of field, the distance within the bartender can be photographed in the sharp focus. I think the director used the Mise-en-scene technique of low-key lighting which creates stronger contrast and sharper, darker shadows. The lightning frame only focus on the main characters in the scene it’s very visible the shadows outside of the frame. As the solder move his hands the lighting on his face does not change, which enable the audience to notice a barely change in his face expression of anger and pride. The power of sound in shot two seen to be external diegetic sound. The diegetic sound in Casablanca has made the music as the main object of the scene because the music was used as identity of themselves. We were able to seen the instruments in the story space as diegetic. In shot two, viewer can actually see the piano as diegetic. The sound was added to make the experience of watching Casablanca more realistic. The director of Casablanca used the technique of shot/reverse-shot pattern. Once the 180 line has been stablished from one cut to …show more content…\n\nIn Shot eighteen we seen Yvonne in a close-up shot being emotional and crying. The frame of the close-up point out a portion of the face and isolates an objects. Also as mention before the facial gesture of Yvonne crying makes us to believe of what she was feeling. In this shot there were no objects or any other visual information in the background away from the face. In addition, frontal lighting eliminates most of the surface shading which it gives Yvonne a soft glamour. I would think the director used a fill lighting technique in shot eighteen. In this shot the sound can be interpreter in many different ways. First, mixing sound which each song takes place within different pattern which it kind overlap the sound from one song to another song. Second, we can assumed the sound can be external diegetic or nondiegetic. As we heard the music out of the frame but we also see Yvonne signing as diegetic. However, nondiegetic sound because we actually don’t see the instruments within the shot although we heard the external sound. Therefore, shot eighteen can be either nonscreen or onscreen sound. We also see a nice change cut. The editing in shot eighteen of Casablanca is essential especially because it shows the transition from one shot to the next shot. The editing technique in shot eighteen makes us wonder why Yvonne facial expression of sadness and crying. I felt"
