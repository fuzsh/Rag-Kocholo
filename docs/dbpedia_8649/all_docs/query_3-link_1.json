        "text": "Nominations are now being accepted for the 2022 National Film Registry\n\nThe 2023 deadline for nominations is August 15, 2023.\n\nThe Library of Congress invites you to submit your recommendations for movies to be included on the 2023 National Film Registry. Public nominations play a key role when the Librarian and Film Board are considering their final selections. To be eligible for the Registry, a film must be at least 10 years old and be \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nThe Registry is intended to reflect American society and the rich tapestry of American cinema since its inceptions around 1890. To that end, we strongly encourage the nomination of the full-range of American film-making: not just Hollywood classics or other well-known works, but also silent era titles, documentaries, avant-garde, educational and industrial films, as well as films representing the vibrant unmatched diversity of American culture, both in terms of content and all those who created these snapshots of America society: directors, writers, actors and actresses, cinematographers, and other crafts.\n\nNominate\n\nYou may recommend up to 50 titles per year through our online nomination form.\n\nUse of the online form is preferred; however, to submit via regular mail, please send your nominations to:"
