        "text": "Welcome to my National Film Registry Fan Site. This website is in no way associated with or endorsed by the National Film Registry, the National Film Preservation Board, or the United States Library of Congress. I’m just a Film Registry enthusiast who wants to share his passion.\n\nIf you are wondering what the Library of Congress National Film Registry is all about, please check out the official Film Registry website, the Wikipedia page, and the other sites listed on my Links page. The aim of this site is to provide information about all of the titles on the Film Registry, especially where they are available on home video formats or online. For now, I don’t plan to list when and where the titles are playing theatrically or streaming.\n\nI’ve been carefully following the National Film Registry since its inception in 1989. Like most cinephiles, I love lists of movies, but the Film Registry has stood apart from the majority of film lists because of its breadth; it has its share of classic Hollywood titles, of course, but the National Film Preservation Board and the Librarians of Congress have clearly made an effort to include more esoteric fare than “best-movie” lists tend to contain. Yet while many of the Registry’s more obscure titles are available on a home video format or online, some of them remain difficult to find. This website is intended to make the search easier.\n\nThroughout the site, each title is followed by the year the film was released and the year it entered the Film Registry, e.g. Casablanca (1942/1989).\n\nHOME VIDEO RELEASE CALENDAR\n\nAll titles are US releases unless otherwise noted.\n\nNovember 19, 2024: Criterion releases William Wyler’s Funny Girl (1968/2016) on Blu-ray Disc and as a 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray Disc combo.
