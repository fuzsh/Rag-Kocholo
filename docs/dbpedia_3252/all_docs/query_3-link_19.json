In what as an all-Italia final, Milan defeated Juventus on penalties after an extra-time which ended in a 0-0 draw. This was its sixth ever UCL title and the Rossoneri won it after a gap of nine years. Ancelotti also won the Coppa Italia that season.\n\nAC Milan - 2006/07\n\nThe last UCL title won by AC Milan was also under the charge of Ancelotti in the year 2007. It was the seventh ever final for the Rossoneri as it faced Liverpool in Athens. Milan was down by three goals at halftime before it made a stellar comeback and dragged the match onto penalty shootout, which it won 3-2.\n\nMilan finished fourth in the league after facing an eight-point deduction due to the Calciopoli scandal making the UCL the only title it won that season.\n\nReal Madrid - 2013/14\n\nIt was the first season at Madrid for Ancelotti and he kicked things off with winning the Copa Del Rey and the UCL Final. Real faced its local rival Atletico Madrid in the final in what was one of the most exciting finals in the competition’s history.\n\nAtletico was ahead by one goal till the 90+3’ but a Sergio Ramos header in the dying embers of the game dragged the match onto extra-time. Real scored three more in extra-time to win its 10th UCL title.\n\nReal Madrid - 2021/22\n\nBoth Madrid and Ancelotti’s last UCL win came in the 2021/22 season, the first season of his second stint with the club. Real edged past Liverpool by one goal in the final to lift its 14th European Cup. Ancelotti also won the LaLiga with the club that season.\n\nReal Madrid - 2023-24\n\nAncelotti won his fifth Champions League title with Real Madrid this season as it beat Dortmund 2-0 at the Wembley stadium. Madrid remained unbeaten in Europe throughout the season.\n\nChampions League titles as a player\n\nAncelotti has won the ULC twice as a player, both with AC Milan in the 1988-89 and 1989-90 season."
