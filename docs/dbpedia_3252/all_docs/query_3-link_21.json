        "text": "24.07.2024 Italy: AS Roma reveals design for new stadium!\n\nAS Roma executives met with the mayor of Rome today to discuss progress on planning a new stadium for the club. Plenty of visuals were also officially unveiled. What will the facility look like?\n\n13.06.2024 Italy: Alarm ahead of Euro 2032. Will Italy lose hosting of tournament?\n\nThere are eight years left until Euro 2032. For most, this is a long time, but for Italian clubs and cities, who need to renovate their facilities, it can be a tense time. All the more so as only three stadiums are ready at the moment. Could the poor condition of the arenas put Italy's hosting of the tournament in risk?\n\n12.06.2024 Italy: Serie A stadium attendance during 2023/24 season\n\nThe Serie A playoffs are now over, so it's time for a stadium recap of the season. And this one surprised with the best attendance in 27 years. 3 teams surpassed the magic barrier of one million spectators, including Inter and AC Milan, who played a fierce Milan derby for the highest attendance, decided by a minimal difference.\n\n26.04.2024 Italy: How much have Serie A stadiums earned in 2023?\n\nThe Italian league is ranked among the prestigious \"Big 5\" - a group of Europe's best leagues. Despite this, in terms of revenue, Serie A stadiums lag behind venues in England or Spain, as the Calcio e Finanza portal has shown by publishing the revenue brought in by Italian arenas in 2023. The gap between the bottom and the top of the ranking is huge, but the battle for 1st place was fierce.\n\n01.09.2023 Italy: Stadio Olimpico will undergo renovation before the European Championships\n\nWhat does the future hold for one of Italy's most recognisable venues? Should it tremble for its existence, like San Siro until recently? It turns out that there is no need for fear. Rome's arena will additionally soon undergo a series of upgrades.\n\n15.04.2023 Euro 2032: Explore Italy's bid\n\nThe Italian Football Federation has presented a list of ten stadiums to host the 2032 European Championship. Provided, of course, that UEFA grants Italy the rights to host its flagship tournament. Here is Italy's bid to host Euro 2032.\n\n30.12.2022 Italy: Roma turns up the pace of the design work\n\nFans still have to wait a while for the detailed design of AS Roma's new stadium. The club's general manager Pietro Berardi assures that the pace of work on the plans is lightning fast and all the cards will soon be laid on the table.\n\n15.10.2022 Rome: AS Roma's new stadium. When and at what cost?\n\nThe long-awaited project is nearing implementation. Although the \"Wolves\" will still have to wait to take the first kick there, the initial financial predictions for the construction and a realistic date for the arena's commissioning have emerged.\n\n12.08.2022 Italy: Here are the 2022/23 Serie A stadiums!\n\nThe previous weekend saw league games kick off in 3 of Europe's TOP 5 leagues. After France, England and Germany, it is time for the Italian Serie A, which will inaugurate the campaign on Saturday, August 13. Meet all the arenas where the rivalry for the scudetto will take place!\n\n18.07.2022 Italy: AS Roma confirms plans to build new stadium\n\nAS Roma has just announced that it will present a feasibility study of its plans to build a new stadium, to the city council in Rome. The site chosen for the new arena is located in Pietralata borough of 'the Eternal City'. It is a site that belongs to the municipality and is not subject to any legal restrictions.\n\n26.05.2022 Rome: First reports on AS Roma's new stadium\n\nThe saga of building a facility for the footballers from the Eternal City continues in full swing. The club's owner, American billionaire Dan Friedkin, has shown the design of the stadium in the new location. This is good news for Giallorossi supporters, but there is still a long way to go.\n\n21.02.2022 Euro 2032: Italy wants to host Euro four years later\n\nIt is possible that in ten years time we will experience the excitement of the European Championship played at Italian stadiums. The local federation has announced that it focuses on its efforts to organise Euro 2032. That means that Italians have abandoned their bid to host the championship in 2028.\n\n17.11.2021 Rome: Lazio's new home at Stadio Flaminio?\n\nNot only AS Roma is willing to build its own stadium. Lazio's authorities are also in favour of relocation from Stadio Olimpico. One of the options considered is the venue where “Biancocelesti” used to play.\n\n23.09.2021 Rome: Upcoming elections to affect AS Roma's stadium plans\n\nGiallorossi are determined to move out of Stadio Olimpico and erect its own facility elsewhere. Perhaps the breakthrough will come after elections in October.\n\n08.04.2021 Euro 2020: What capacities will stadiums have?\n\nWill Bilbao and Dublin lose their hosting rights? Some media outlets got into speculations about potential replacements but it seems to be far from decided. Here’s what we know about Euro 2020 venues allowing fans inside.\n\n30.11.2020 Rome: AS Roma’s problems with location of new stadium\n\nThe chances of building a new AS Roma stadium in Tor di Valle are decreasing. It turned out that the legal status of the land in that location is not fully clarified. Club owner Dan Friedkin looks more and more favourably towards Stadio Flaminio, the venue where the Romans played in the 1989/90 season.\n\n09.07.2020 Rome: Can it be true? Roma stadium just a vote away\n\nThis project has been ongoing for 8 years now and not one brick has been laid. But perhaps now, finally, after so many hurdles, AS Roma will be allowed to start construction in Tor di Valle."
