        "text": "Eight journalists attended the annual pre-season sit-down with the Manchester United manager at UCLA on Thursday.\n\n“Where is your shirt?\" Erik ten Hag asked one of the more flamboyantly dressed correspondents who had opted for uncharacteristically understated attire.\n\n\"No way, no way,\" Ten Hag laughed. \"You are in Manchester and it's raining and you're coming over here. Now he's here, it's a white shirt. Colourful shirts and now he's showing off. You want to provoke!\"\n\nTen Hag generously spoke for 36 minutes with the dedicated correspondents in the JD Morgan Center about a range of topics.\n\nREAD MORE: United issue major Malacia update\n\nREAD MORE: United not changing transfer plans over injuries\n\nHere is the transcript in full:\n\nHow's the tour going, how are you feeling?\n\nTen Hag: Good, it's a positive tour so far and I think, yeah, it's a pre-season. I think we made some foundations.\n\nAnd how about the injuries, how are you feeling about Hojlund and Leny?\n\nYeah, I'm waiting for this question, of course. But that's part of football, that's part of top football especially, that you come into, you go to the edge, every player has to go to the edge and yeah, then injuries are not avoidable. But of course, we have to be ready as a club and as a team to cover this and the players are dealing very well with this setback. They are very positive, they are already recovering and they will return.\n\nDo you think that would accelerate some recruitment plans possibly, given their two significant injuries?\n\nNo, no.\n\nDo you think that's a shift? Because obviously there's a new structure here now, is it a new way of working?\n\nNo, this will not change anything. We have a plan and we stick to the plan.\n\nIt won't change who stays either?\n\nNo, no. We have a plan and we will execute the plan, how we have that in our minds. So we will continue this.\n\nWhen we saw you win the FA Cup, we weren't sure whether we'd be sat here with you again.\n\nNo!\n\nWe're very glad we are. You didn't know either. I know you spoke about it in the interview with AD, but how difficult was that period for you, that period of uncertainty and how pleased are you to still be here?\n\nI was never distracted from the mission. So I came here two years ago and this group of players hadn't won any trophy for six years. I said we are also on a mission and we are here to win and be building and that we knew before us that it will not come overnight. We have to work very hard and we will have to deal with setbacks during that time.\n\nThe first season I think was very successful, with two finals. We won one, we lost one - we should have won that one - and we were third in the league. And we came far in Europe, we played over 60 matches. Then last season, there were a lot of setbacks, that was clear. But by the end we got rewarded, because we kept believing and we won an amazing trophy and so we have a foundation.\n\nI think in the summer, many positives are there, with the new leadership group who will help give us a better foundation, a structure, that will help our team. We have some new coaches which gives us, not a better dynamic, but a different dynamic, innovations, new ideas, a new dynamic, new energy, and I think then we can make progress to get to the next level.\n\nYou mentioned that a couple of times, you came in and the team hadn't won for six years. Do you think that has maybe been lost a little bit?\n\nI think it tells something about the abilities from that dressing room and so before me there were also good managers. But at the end of the day, it's the quality from the players, who form a team that can lead to success. But when the ability in the dressing room is not there, you can't achieve anything.\n\nAnd, of course, you need team cohesion, that makes a difference. But when in the base the qualities are not there in the dressing room, it's impossible to achieve success, because no manager makes from a worse footballer a good footballer.\n\nDid you think that's what you would found when you came here, that the ability just wasn't in the dressing room?\n\nIt was not at the level required for Manchester United. You can develop players and you can develop, of course, a team that often goes hand in hand. But the potential must be there, otherwise you can't, as a manager, as a coaching staff, as a backroom staff, you can't build this when the potential is not there.\n\nHow do you rate this current squad then?\n\nI think we've caught up and so we see we're capable of competing with the best teams in England. Then you are trying to compete with the best teams in the world, and there are some teams like Real Madrid of course, a very good team. But the Premier League is a very high level and we are capable of competing with them, which is very good.\n\nBut our challenge is now to do this more consistently. How we do it has a lot to do with culture, winning culture, to build this. I feel that we built a foundation now, with the new leadership group, with the coaching staff and with new players coming in.\n\nEverything's moving forward now Erik, with the new leadership group. It looks like a more dynamic team now in terms of the overall structure, you've done some good deals, the way you've done them and who you've got in. With the changes to the structure and the coaching team everything looks good, but in terms of trust how comfortable are you given they were having conversations with other managers in April and May?\n\nI'm very comfortable and also at that time I felt very comfortable because I believe in myself. But of course it will help if there is very good communication and of course it’s helpful when you feel the backing from the leadership group.\n\nThat helps because then you know where you're building to, that you do it together. When you are in a very good, very strong bond that gives you confidence, gives you belief. Also the dressing room, they will feel this, they will feel this strong belief that will bed into the dressing room and they bed it into the pitch.\n\nDo you feel stronger now in your position than you’ve ever felt?\n\nI felt always strong because I believe in myself. I believe that even in difficult circumstances that I can manage a team in a strong mentality. I believe that I can manage a team in winning positions but of course it will really help when around you there are strong people with great abilities to help you.\n\nThen the processes can speed up and you can get to higher levels. So if we can do this together we achieve quicker but also higher levels.\n\nWith regard to that, would you have preferred a longer contract because an extra year didn’t feel like massive backing?\n\nNo, I wanted this. So I think two years in football is already a long time and in two years we will see what we have built on top of what we have achieved now.\n\nYou say you wanted two years, but why do you not want four because it's more security?\n\nNo, I don't need that. I don't need that security.\n\nDid you expect to get a new contract or did you always think it would be them triggering the extension?\n\nFor me it's important that we are together and that we are working together and when you work together you are in good moments together but also in bad moments. When it's being questioned in the surrounding then of course that will flow into a team and that is not helpful in achieving success.\n\nFor myself I don't need this because I have enough security in my life and in my career and I have enough belief that I know when I have a team I will achieve success.\n\nWhen you talk about being together when there are problems, are you confident that if you do have a difficult start to the season or if there are bumps in the road that you will still have that backing?\n\nYes. I feel that we are building something and that the people around me, we are in the same boat. But of course, it's always a proven point when the case is there. But what I hope is that we avoid this.\n\nYou’re going to need that patience and understanding if you’re going to build a team around young players like Mainoo, Garnacho, Hojlund and Yoro?\n\nThat's a fair point. We have to build and we have a group of players who are very talented and we are happy to have those players and I think also they are really Man United players. There are players who have an X-factor but they are young. They already have the experience of how to win a trophy and we have to build on that but with young players it will go with ups and downs and we have to realise that.\n\nEveryone has to realise this in this club internally but also you [the media] should realise this externally. It's normal that it will not only go this way [up] with young people, young players especially. Sometimes they will have a drop off and then it's about do they have the character to bounce back and to achieve against high levels?\n\nYou’ve said you agreed with Ralf Rangnick’s assessment about the club needing “open heart surgery” and you’ve said it will take time. Do you know how many more players you need and how many more windows you need to feel you can challenge for the title?\n\nWhat I said, that assessment at that time I think was to make. Because we needed to catch up and this club needed to catch up and I think the last two years, we won the trophies and now we have restructured. So we are now in a better place. This is the fifth window but we never used the winter window so far.\n\nFirst year we only took loan players, this season we didn't use it. There you have to also do your deals and use those windows but do strategic deals to go faster in the season or faster in the project. In that time, you have to assess if it's possible and you have to deal with financial rules as FFP and maybe you are not able or capable to do those deals but we didn't use them so far in the winter.\n\nSo you're maybe like still five, six, seven players and two windows away from really being able to create that two outstanding players in every position type that you need?\n\nI don't want to talk in numbers, a lot of the time when we are in the winter then you have to assess the process again. Where are we? How is the team performing? How do individual players, how do they progress? And so what is necessary and what can we do?\n\nBut I think a club as us always have to look for better. But in the winter, to make big changes that's also not required. Because it's very difficult because you don't have time to build them in. But strategic or do one or two things because you have a problem as we did two years ago when we loaned because we had problems in the striker position - we did Wout Weghorst - and Marcel Savitser because Christian Eriksen had an injury. They were two very good signings who were very helpful to achieve the success for that season.\n\nThe reaction to you after the FA Cup final from the fans was overwhelmingly positive, it must have been even quite emotional when you lifted the trophy given that you'd finished eighth in the league and the last Dutchman who didn't do very well in the FA Cup got booed when he went up to lift it, Louis van Gaal. But the reaction to you was very different, you had the support of all the fans. Do you think that maybe turned a lot of people's thinking at the top in the club but also gave you a sort of a new boost that you felt that the most important people maybe were behind you?\n\nI feel that especially the fans who attended our home and away games that there is a very strong bond between the team and those fans and that we are really there together and they understand very well the position we are in as a club. And if we fight together that is the way to achieve it because those fans can create an ambience, it's amazing and then amazing things can happen.\n\nFor instance, like the game against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-final. There was a vibe and we are all long in football but it's not so often you feel that vibe and if we can create that more often that is absolutely helpful to get a team into high levels.\n\nAnd that vibe also comes with how you play. Not every manager since Sir Alex has played thrilling football but you at your best seem to and is that an important thing for you to keep that connection with the fans?\n\nI think absolutely. We want to play really proactive, aggressive football and I think attacking football and what is embraced by the fans and share this emotionally with the fans.\n\nOne of the players you've got back available now is Jadon Sancho, how's your working relationship with him given what happened last season?\n\nWe left this behind us and we said everything about this, we know from each other what the standards are and how we want to work, how we want to collaborate and we need a good team there for you. We just spoke about the standards, the levels, the abilities, when I took over. You need good players to construct a good team and he's definitely a very good player.\n\nAnd something that the fans keep asking as well: did he actually apologise to you?\n\nI think we said everything about it. So we left it behind us and I think in our statement there was everything and it was clear and obvious.\n\nI'm sure there are many reasons why what happened last season happened Erik but there were some key players who probably didn't perform to the levels that you would have hoped them to. The likes of Marcus Rashford, Antony, Mason Mount, for different reasons each of them. How important is it this season that those players, and others like them, step up to the plate and play the way that we know that they can play?\n\nFirst of all we need them, so the availability of the players should be better. The players have to take responsibility, we as staff have to take responsibility to do this together. The leadership plays also a role in this to set the right culture and then the players, we have more and a higher rate of player availability because when you have got a squad where you can make choices, you can make selection, that improves your levels and then you have a better chance, you win football games and then it's about going more into a positive than what happened last season, going into a negative. And then again this group of players is then capable of competing with the best teams.\n\nCan I ask about the coaching, Erik? How much of the changes were because of what you evaluated and how much was it because of what Ineos evaluated?\n\nI think first it was individual elements, that people made the choices to want to play, go into different roles and then also I think it was good to create a new dynamic. We are in a process and when you go to the next step in the process, it's good to bring in new energy and new dynamics and a requirement also from different skills. We reviewed it and we decided to bring in some different profiles.\n\nWhat did you think when Ineos were looking at potential replacements?\n\nWhat I think is that I want to collaborate. So togetherness, because I know when you are together you achieve more success and I am here to win. But we want to win, so I have to feel this and when I feel this, we will win. We have good people. With highly competent people, they will contribute to more success and I don’t think negative.\n\nSo regarding your question, I don’t think negatively. If this or if this. I feel positive and I feel very aligned. They are here, we are building those relationships and, as I said, we have to prove this point during the season and the next coming years, how strong we are.\n\nDoes this feel like a fresh start?\n\nNo, but that is not on me. What I feel is, so many people advised negatively when I started in this club. And I could have gone into projects with much better conditions, with much better structures but I choose this: Man United. I feel this is my club. And I want to go for this challenge, although I knew this is very tough, this is very hard.\n\nBut you only know when you are in and there are some challenges here. But already, we overcame many obstacles and we have to beat even more but, and I said it also in the spring, I feel we are in the right direction. And even in the summer I think many positives happened that we can accelerate this process.\n\nJamie Carragher was critical of your set-up last season, particularly the gap between the midfield and defence. The structure was completely different in the FA Cup final. What's your view on what Carragher said and do you think there will be tweaks to your team that you discuss with the new coaches and Jason Wilcox?\n\nNo, not in particular. So we will always be criticised. We are Man United and there is no other club that is criticised like Man United. You will always find in one game where you play a bad part where you find deficits in our game. Last season, when we hadn’t the players available and there were no patterns and fell off, we had to adjust our game model because every week we had to adjust our line-up, different personnel.\n\nWe had 33 different back fours. What do you think? That the patterns are there? I saw the same what he saw. But I also know and we proved it not on one time but on a more consistent basis, we can play very compact and we are capable that we can build a foundation and be very successful. So the criticism, he can tell or another one can tell. But when we look at it and analyse it, we are very capable and we showed that not only in the game against City. True, we achieved a very high level. But also in many more other games where we achieved high levels and had a good foundation.\n\nFerguson came through a tricky spell in 1989-90 to win the FA Cup. You've come through a tricky spell and won the FA Cup. Could history repeat itself?\n\nHistory but I don’t dream. We have to live today and build a future but don’t look too far ahead. We have that foundation, I think we are in the right direction, the process. For half an hour now we are discussing. But we have to do better. We have to make improvements because many clubs around us also improve and they also have the financial conditions to ground very good teams and clubs. So, in history, probably it was a two-horse race. Now we’re talking about seven or eight clubs capable of developing very strong teams.\n\nHow is Rashford?\n\nYou have seen him. He got a knock.\n\nHow bad is it?\n\nI think not too bad. It’s within the 24 hours but I think he will progress quickly from this knock.\n\nAnd on him, he obviously had a very disappointing season last season. There were things off the pitch with him partying. He lost his place in the Euros. Can you get him back to the player he was two years ago? He looks to have the appetite, which we saw last night against Real Betis, but have you seen a difference in him? Is he determined to get back to his best and back with England?\n\nOf course, but he has to prove this point. We will set the conditions and he is very capable of doing this. Not last season but the season before, he scored 30 goals, so when he is in the right vibe, then he has such a high potential. And when he is really in that mood, then our game model will provide him the conditions to score again 30 or even more goals.\n\nIsn't it down on him to always be in that mood? It shouldn't just be when the fancy takes him. That's his job, right?\n\nHe should fight for it, but we are not robots. We are dealing with human beings. And everyone, you are not always on your best! (Laughs.)\n\nEver since you came in, you were very clear about discipline being one of the key things you wanted to instil in the squad. I'm not talking about one incident in particular, but there have been incidents of ill-discipline within the squad. Has that disappointed you that even last season, you've been here for 18 months, that these things were still happening and you were still having to sit in front of us and talk about nightclub visits and people being late for training and that kind of thing?\n\nI think when you want to play in top football nowadays, you need discipline on and off the pitch. It was always important, but it gets more and more important now because it's the survival of the fittest.\n\nYou are not a robot, you are not a machine. No one is. You can only deliver the levels of performance when you do the things right. When you don't do the things right on and off the pitch, then you can't perform.\n\nCasemiro had a bit of a dip last season, Erik. He didn't play in the FA Cup final. How is your relationship with him and how do you think he will play for United this season?\n\nYou have to make choices. We need a squad, and at that time also we needed a squad and what was needed for that particular game. But he is a very important player. He is a leader and he can make a difference for our team. I talk in general, but it is for all the players. When they are needed … no-one can play every game, it's impossible.\n\nDo you expect him to stay though, Casemiro?\n\nAll the players who are there, if they want to play for us, want to play for the badge and they have the quality, then I hope they keep contributing to our team. We have seen that Casemiro in his career is so successful. For instance, in the previous season, he was so important to achieve all the success we had there. So when he is on this level, he is a very impactful player for us.\n\nIs Tyrell Malacia ok? Because it's been such a long time since he last played for the club and you expected him back in January and then he had that setback.\n\nHe is now in a good place, but he is not here because I only took players who could play games or be available for team training. He is not that far, but he is now in a progress situation. At a relatively short notice, he can again return into team training and then into team performance in games.\n\nWhen do you think that might be?\n\nI think it would be possible in two months.\n\nJust finally on Marcus, just going back to that point, the best players deliver season after season. You've seen with Marcus in that season when he scored 30 goals that there is a capability there to be a world-class player. Yet he has never ever put together back-to-back seasons. It's always a good season and then he goes off and then he comes back again and then he goes off. Why is that? He's not 21 anymore. Why has he not been able to do that?\n\nI think it's a question for Rashy, if that’s your assessment. So I don't know if that's a really clear pattern, but for me it’s now important and so he is capable of being that impactful player. If he is doing, then for our team he’s such an important player because goals obviously make a difference. I expect him to be that player in this season.\n\nWe spoke to Harry Amass last night. He's only 17 years old. Is next season too soon for him or could he play at Old Trafford next season in the first team?\n\nWe have to make progress, but we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years, for instance two years ago, Garnacho last season. We had it during last season with Kobbie, but he is not that far now at this moment. But if we train him well, if we coach him well, then in three months it's possible that he can be on that point."
