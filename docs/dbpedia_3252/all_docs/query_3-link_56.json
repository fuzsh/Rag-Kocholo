        "text": "Bronze medallist at Tokyo, the “Les Bleues” hunt for their first-ever golden glory in 2024. And, as host nations this time around, hardly anyone would write them off to realize their quest. Especially now that they have made it to the quarterfinals yet again. While the fans would be excited about what the roster can bring to the table, a spare of thought should also be given to the group handling the coaching responsibilities. Leading the charge for them is Senegal basketball icon Jean-Aime Toupane.\n\nGetting assisted with the expertise of 3 assistant coaches David Gautier, Gregory Halin, and Catherine Melain, Toupane is deemed as the man for the job as per the President of the French Basketball Federation Jean-Pierre Siutat. But, before diving into his coaching background, it is worth a look at how his playing days spanned out.\n\nJean-Aime Toupane as a baller\n\nHaving had the opportunity to spend some time in the middle as a player, the 66-year-old has the required tools to inculcate a winning culture. After representing the Senegal national team in the 1978 World Cup in Manila, he realized that he could make the most of his playing abilities elsewhere. And, that’s when Toupane decided to migrate to France and turn pro.\n\nInitially participating in the French second division, he developed his skills further until in 1984 AS Monaco scouted him. For 4 years, he provided his valuable services and then made a switch to Mulhouse and stayed there for 2 seasons. He had the best 2 seasons of his professional career with the club averaging 15.8 points in 1989-90 and 14.4 in 1990-91.\n\nTrying out his luck for the top French league by associating himself with Gravelines (15 points per game in 1991-92) in 1991 and then moving back to Mulhouse, it was in 1995 that the first division club Lyon provided him the big break. Unfortunately, producing only 6 points per contest during the one season made him end his career at Spacer’s de Toulouse. This made him shift his focus towards utilizing his mentoring skills for the best.\n\nToupane’s transition into a coach\n\nCommencing his coaching profession by associating himself with Toulouse, his tenure at Clermont-Ferrand however, helped him build a considerable reputation. Promoting the club from third to the second division and then to the first was perhaps one of the defining moments of his career. Consequently, this earned him an assistant coach position in the French men’s national team at the 2005 European Championships. After aiding the team to secure a bronze he held on to that position for 2 more years.\n\nThen, in 2008-09, first division club Pau-Orthez offered him a position to be head coach. Unfortunately, this association couldn’t last for long as 6 consecutive defeats compelled the ownership and management to fire him. Following this, he had to wait for 4 years before second-division club Hyères-Toulon required his services. But, he moved to first division club Olympique d’Antibes the very next season. Although, winning just 1 out of the 9 fixtures opened the exit doors for him at the club.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued his national duties simultaneously. Seemingly, he spent a substantial amount of time with the French men’s U20 national team. Under his leadership, France won the U20 European Championship in 2010. In addition to this, they were runners-up twice and finished 3rd in 2011 and 2017. The illustrious list of international players under his wing was Antoine Diot, Kevin Séraphin, Thomas Heurtel, Andrew Albicy, Evan Fournier, Léo Westermann, Élie Okobo and Amine Noua.\n\nThis piqued the interest of the French Basketball Federation and paved the way for him to join the women’s national basketball team.\n\nTaking over the Les Bleues at a critical stage\n\nFilling the shoes of Valerie Garnier who led the team to a bronze medal in the 2020 Olympics and a fifth consecutive silver medal at the FIBA Women’s EuroBasket, three flagship tournaments awaited Jean-Aime Toupane. “The French women’s team is taking a new direction with the appointment of Jean-Aime Toupane at its head,” Jean-Pierre Siutat said in an official statement. “We are convinced that he will be able to lead Le Bleues to the highest level, up to our ambitions, three years before the Olympic Games in Paris”.\n\nUnder him, FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2023 Qualifiers was a walk in the park. Soon after, they made it to the semi-finals of the competition but lost against the reigning champions Belgium. Nonetheless, they managed to secure a bronze medal by defeating Hungary 82-68.\n\n“Jean-Aime has experience, a perfect knowledge of the top level and a culture of winning – essential for such a position”. This is the reflection of the President of the French Basketball Federation Jean-Pierre Siutat about Jean-Aime Toupane. And indeed he is making his basketball IQ and aptitude do all the talking for him. It will be worth watching if he can help the “Les Bleues” realize their Olympic dream.\n\nStay tuned for more such updates. And join us for the exciting second episode of the “Dual Threat Show”. Our host BG12 sits down with Georgia Bulldogs star and Mountain West All-Freshman Team Selection, Asia Avinger."
