        "text": "35 goals were scored on Europa Conference League matchday one, with İstanbul Başakşehir and Villarreal both contributing four to that tally.\n\nDjurgården, Slovácko, Ballkani, Vaduz, Žalgiris Vilnius and RFS all got off the mark in, what was, their first-ever outings in a UEFA group stage.\n\nBizarrely, no goals were scored in Group F, but that statistical quirk will surely change in Stockholm or Ghent.\n\nBelow are previews of all 16 fixtures.\n\nGroup Tables:\n\nGroup A: İstanbul Başakşehir vs Fiorentina\n\nEdinburgh, 8th September 2022.\n\nYoussouf Ndayishimiye of Istanbul Basaksehir scored his sides 2nd goal celebrating with his team mates during the UEFA Europa Conference League match at Tynecastle Park, Edinburgh.

Picture credit should read: Neil Hanna / Sportimage (Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nWill İstanbul Başakşehir pull clear at the top of Group A?\n\nOn matchday one, the Grey Owls demolished Heart of Midlothian 4-0 at Tynecastle and, in truth, it could’ve been more.\n\nThis is the Orange-Navy Blues’ fourth UEFA group stage, all since 2017, overcoming Maccabi Netanya, Breiðablik and Royal Antwerp to get here.\n\nİstanbul Başakşehir lost their only two previous encounters with an Italian club, beaten 3-0 and 4-0 by Roma three years ago, but will be hopeful of a better result this time.\n\nFiorentina meantime were also expected to be battling at the top of this section, but stumbled in their own group opener.\n\nWhen Antonín Barák broke the deadlock at Stadio Artemio Franchi, I Viola looked set to comfortably see off RFS.\n\nBut the Virslīga champions, against all odds, equalised late and left Florence with a point.\n\nThen, on Sunday, Vincenzo Italiano’s team lost 2-1 to Bologna, leaving them 11th in Serie A.\n\nSo, perhaps, Fiorentina aren’t going to cruise through as they return to UEFA competition after five years away.\n\nWho will leave Başakşehir Fatih Terim Stadyumu victorious?\n\nGroup A: RFS vs Heart of Midlothian\n\nRead more about RFS vs Heart of Midlothian by clicking here.\n\nIf Heart of Midlothian hadn’t realised the Europa Conference League group stages would be a step up in difficult level, they certainly have now.\n\nOn matchday one, Hearts were demolished 4-0 by İstanbul Başakşehir at Tynecastle on a gloomy, grey evening in Edinburgh.\n\nPathetic fallacy in real life.\n\nThe Jambos have now lost all three European fixtures this season, having been beaten twice by FC Zürich last month.\n\nAt least Robbie Neilson’s team are facing a completely hopeless outfit in this game, right?\n\nWell, RFS are making their debut in a UEFA group stage, with the Virslīga champions widely expected to be Group A’s whipping boys when the draw was made.\n\nOn the contrary, the Latvian side held Fiorentina to a 1-1 draw last Thursday; Andrej Ilić cooly slotting home a late equaliser at Stadio Artemio Franchi.\n\nThis was a major shock, given that Viktors Morozs’ team were incredibly lucky to oust Linfield in the play-offs, prevailing on penalties.\n\nBack at Skonto stadions, will RFS claim a famous victory, or will Heart of Midlothian win on the road?\n\nGroup B: Silkeborg vs West Ham United\n\nRead more about Silkeborg vs West Ham United by clicking here.\n\nLondon Stadium, London, UK. 18th Aug, 2022.

Europa Conference League football West Ham versus Viborg FF: Gianluca Scamacca of West Ham United wins the header and scores for 1-0 in the 23rd minute Credit: Action Plus Sports/Alamy Live News (Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nWest Ham United are clearly the best team in this group, so will they make it two wins out of two in Denmark?\n\nOn matchday one, despite being a goal down at half time, the Hammers fought back and beat FCSB 3-1 at the London Stadium.\n\nJarrod Bowen lashed home a penalty before Emerson bundled in his first for the club, with Michail Antonio rubber stamping the victory in stoppage time.\n\nDavid Moyes’ men reached the Europa League semi-finals just last season and now, in a lower-tier tournament, are certainly aiming to go all the way.\n\nGiven that the Irons were not in action at the weekend, expect Moyes to name a very strong side ahead of Sunday’s trip to Everton.\n\nWest Ham have already won in Denmark this season, easily beating Viborg 3-0 three week ago, but should face a tougher test just 22 miles south at JYSK Park.\n\nSilkeborg, as a newly-promoted club, came third in last season’s Superligaen, meaning they are back in Europe after 21 years away.\n\nKent Nielsen’s team took on Anderlecht seven nights ago ago and, after competing on an even keel for long periods, were eventually undone by a late penalty.\n\nHaving lost to HJK in last month’s Europa League play-offs, Silkeborg are now winless in nine European fixtures, dating back 24 years.\n\nSo, a comfortable West Ham victory seems likely at Silkeborg Stadium.\n\nGroup B: FCSB vs Anderlecht\n\nMeanwhile, after their credible showing at the London Stadium, FCSB will be looking to get off the mark.\n\nWhen Andrei Cordea fired the fallen Romanian giants in front against West Ham, they were dreaming of a famous victory, but no dice.\n\nBack at Arena Națională, Nicolae Dică’s team will feel this is a more realistic opportunity to claim some points.\n\nRemember, FCSB reached two European Cup Finals in the 1980s, beating Barcelona in 1986 before losing to A.C. Milan three years later.\n\nThese days, the Red and Blues are just delighted to be competing in their first UEFA group stage since 2017.\n\nFCSB have only lost three of their last 14 European home games, so will their decent record stand firm here?\n\nAnderlecht meanwhile are looking to move onto six points after beating Silkeborg on matchday one.\n\nFelice Mazzù’s team looked set to be frustrated at Lotto Park, until Fábio Silva’s emphatic late penalty snatched the points.\n\nNow, if the Purple and Whites could win in Bucharest, they’d already been in a great position to reach the knockout stages for the first time since 2016/17.\n\nGroup C: Hapoel Be’er Sheva vs Villarreal\n\nVillarreal’s A.

Morales celebrate after scoring the 3-1 goal during PLAYOFF CONFERENCE LEAGUE match between Villarreal CF and Hajduk Split at Ciutat de Valencia Stadium.

Picture date: Thursday August 5, 2021.\n\nAfter both Group F matches finished goalless on opening night, will there be more excitement this time?\n\nFor Shamrock Rovers, they were very frustrated not to beat Djurgårdens IF in Dublin, failing to beat an inspired visiting goalkeeper.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hoops lost all six matches when they last featured in a UEFA group stage 11 years ago.\n\nSo, the League of Ireland Champions have already improved on that, now seeking a famous victory in Belgium.\n\nGent meantime were probably satisfied with the scoreless draw they earned against Molde at Røkkeløkka.\n\nDe Buffalo’s are competing in a sixth group stage in 12 season, topping their group 12 months ago before falling to PAOK in the round of 16.\n\nIn fact, Gent have lost both European home matches in 2022, despite being unbeaten in six during the previous calendar year.\n\nSo, will it be a famous night for the travelling Rovers supporters at Ghelamco Arena?\n\nGroup F: Djurgården vs Molde\n\nDjurgården too were pleased to get off the mark on matchday one, doing so on the road in their first-ever group stage fixture.\n\nThe Swedish club won all three home matches during qualifying, overcoming Rijeka, Sepsi OSK Sfântu Gheorghe and APOEL.\n\nSo, they’ll hope Tele2 Arena become a bit of a fortress.\n\nMolde though will certainly be the toughest test Djurgårdens IF have faced in Europe for almost two decades.\n\nThe Norwegian club reached the Europa League round of 16 just two seasons ago, with this their fourth UEFA group stage.\n\nThis will be Molde’s first visit to Sweden since their first-evameer g in UEFA competition, a 6-0 drubbing by Öster in 1975.\n\nFast forward 47 years, will Erling Moe’s men be too strong in Stockholm?\n\nGroup G: Slavia Prague vs Ballkani\n\nPrague, Czech Republic, Thursday. 24th Feb, 2022.
