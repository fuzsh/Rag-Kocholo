Initially known as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, it adopted its current name, the Champions League, in 1992.\n\nThe tournament initially featured just 16 teams but has since grown, with plans to expand from 32 to 36 European clubs for the 2024-25 season.\n\nDominant Countries\n\nOut of the 536 teams that have participated, only 23 clubs have won the tournament. Spain leads with 19 titles, won by just two clubs: Real Madrid (14 titles) and Barcelona (5 titles).\n\nEngland follows with 15 championships, Italy with 12, Germany with 8, the Netherlands with 6, and Portugal with 4. Additionally, clubs from France, Scotland, Romania, and Serbia have each won the tournament once.\n\nReal Madrid's Recent Decade of Success\n\nReal Madrid will seek to add another star to their impressive record, especially notable over the past decade. Los Merengues won the first five European Cups consecutively between 1956 and 1960, then won two more titles in 1966 and 1998.\n\nIn the new millennium, they have been dominant, winning the tournament in 2000, 2002, and five of the last ten tournaments, including a three-peat from 2016 to 2018, and also in 2014 and 2022.\n\nBorussia Dortmund's Achievements\n\nBorussia Dortmund won the trophy in 1997, defeating Juventus 3-1 in Munich. Dortmund also reached the Champions League final in 2013 but lost to Bayern Munich.\n\nReal Madrid's Rare Losses\n\nWhile it may be hard to believe, Real Madrid has also lost a Champions League final three times: in 1962 (to Benfica), 1964 (to Inter Milan), and 1981 (to Liverpool).\n\nAs these two giants prepare to clash at Wembley, the world eagerly anticipates another unforgettable night in the history of the Champions League.\n\nChampions League Winners\n\nEsta es la lista de ganadores de la Champions League desde 1956 hasta 2023:\n\n2022-2023 Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\n\n2021-2022 Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool\n\n2020-2021 Chelsea 1-0 Manchester City\n\n2019-2020 Bayern Munich 1-0 Paris Saint Germain\n\n2018-19 Liverpool 2-0 Tottenham\n\n2017-18 Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\n\n2016-17 Real Madrid 4-1 Juventus\n\n2015-16 Real Madrid 1-1 (5-3 pen.)
