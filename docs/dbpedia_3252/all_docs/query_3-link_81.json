(Not all contributions can be used)\n\n2245: In the face of some severe criticism, I'm going to produce a star man of the night - it's clearly Mexican Carlos Vela, who's a bit special. He's not only \"broken the seven\" (it'll catch on), he's \"obliterated the nine\" (it'll never work) after a stunning hat-trick against Sheffield United. Think that's silly? Then get involved...\n\nRate the players\n\n2232: A disappointing end to the night for fans of cupsets, but I think we've had enough top-class entertainment tonight don't you? Congratulations to those teams through to the fourth round, just pray you don't draw Arsenal's scary kids at the Emirates. Danny Baker's still going on 606 on BBC Radio 5 Live, by the way. See you tomorrow, crew.\n\n2228: Full-time Sunderland 2-2 Northampton - Sunderland win 4-3 on penalties\n\n2227: Full-time Stoke 2-2 Reading - Stoke win 4-3 on penalties\n\n2225: Stoke have missed now and so have Sunderland!\n\n2224: Reading have missed an early peno, as have Northampton.\n\n2222: \"Stoke and Sunderland to lose.\"\n\nBluechamps on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nWho are you, Stevo?\n\n2217: Full-time at the end of extra-time at Stoke and Sunderland. Both are going to penalties, watch this space...\n\n2216: Heading for penalties at Stoke and Sunderland. Meanwhile, I've just read the half-sentence \"the long ball rubbish played by Clough's men\" on 606. That's the most stupid thing I've ever seen written by anyone in all my life. You know who you are. You should be utterly, utterly ashamed of youself.\n\n2213: I've just seen some still pictures of the Rodrigo Possebon injury. It looks worse from every different angle and every time you see it. What a pity for the 19-year-old.\n\n2211: \"A mate of mine tried to tell me Jack Wilshere will be England's Cesc Fabregas. Every time I've seen him for Arsenal's academy/reserve side and their pre-season friendlies, he's reminded more of Andres Iniesta than Fab.\"\n\nWeAllDreamOfATeamOfCarraghers on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nI love Iniesta. I wish you hadn't got me started. What a gorgeous footballer.\n\n2207: If you fancy venting your spleen tonight (and I'm not good enough for you), get involved with the maverick Danny Baker on 606 on BBC Radio 5 Live. He's just started, so fill your boots. I'll be here until the games at Stoke and Sunderland finish, of course.\n\n2204: So we've still got two games going on in extra-time, at the Britannia Stadium between Stoke City and Reading and at the Stadium of Light where Sunderland are taking on Northampton. They're both still 2-2, if you were wondering.\n\n2200: \"Spitefulness is so unattractive in a man!\"\n\nSara from Mansfield, reading online in Dusseldorf, via text\n\nConsider me told.\n\n2157: Full-time at Manchester United and they have beaten Middlesbrough 3-1 in a game overshadowed by what could be a serious injury to youngster Rodrigo Possebon. We'll try to keep you posted.\n\n2156: \"Well we (Arsenal) have never won the European Cup like Forest and it's thanks to them that we wear red!\"\n\nMark, Basingstoke, via text\n\nTrue. Arsenal play in red because Forest gave them a set of shirts. Same as Juventus play in black-and-white because Notts County gave them shirts. Nottingham took football to the rest of the world, it just forgot to bring it back...\n\n2153: GOAL Man Utd 3-1 Middlesbrough\n\nBoro have imploded at Old Trafford and it's a David Wheater mistake this time, a terrible backpass putting Nani through and the Portuguese flier rounding the goalkeeper and slotting into the net. Game over.\n\n2151: Liverpool have sneaked past Crewe at Anfield, 2-1. Meanwhile, Man Utd go close to adding another at Old Trafford through Carlos Tevez, but they've probably already done enough.\n\n2148: \"Forest were once like Arsenal? (ForestEgg, 2128) Ha ha... I think I've heard Forest fans come out with just about everything now. You've found your level boys... deal with it.\"\n\nMark, Mansfield, via text\n\nYep, good work Mark. Did Mansfield end up losing their Blue Square Premier game away at Altrincham tonight, by the way?\n\n2146: \"I have just congratulated Gavin Strachan for his BBC Blog on Facebook! And he replied! I'm starstruck.\"\n\nVeronsTasche on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nSo you should be, he's a legend that boy. Everyone should read his blog - it really is a cracking effort.\n\nWelcome to the Gavin Strachan blog\n\n2143: Goalscorer Ryan Giggs is taken off at Old Trafford as Angolan Manucho comes on. Standing ovation for the Welsh wizard.\n\n2143: \"Praise be that games are only 90 minutes long.\"\n\nAndy, Sheffield, via text\n\nNo prizes for guessing you you support, mate.\n\n2141: Full-times are coming in and there are two cupsets to speak of so far, with Burnley beating Fulham 1-0 at Turf Moor and Rotherham seeing off Southampton 3-1 at the Don Valley Stadium (not Millmoor, definitely not Millmoor).\n\n2138: GOAL Sunderland 2-2 Northampton\n\nWouldn't you just know it? Anthony Stokes bags his second of the game with a header and we're heading for extra-time at the Stadium of Light.\n\n2137: GOAL Man Utd 2-1 Middlesbrough\n\nVeteran winger Ryan Giggs eases the nerves at Old Trafford with what may turn out to be a winner, a great strike from the Welshman.\n\n2135: GOAL Leeds 3-2 Hartlepool\n\nLooks like being a late winner, Andy Robinson curling the ball in from the right-hand side of the penalty area.\n\n2134: GOAL Burnley 1-0 Fulham\n\nLate, late drama at Turf Moor and it's Championship 1-0 Premier League. Super-sub Jay Rodriguez does the damage with two minutes to go.\n\n2133: \"That Pogatez should be banned for life. He has broken the boy's leg. It's a disgrace, a total disgrace and you label it 'poor'. I suggest you rephrase that.\"\n\nTrev, via text\n\nI probably should rephrase it. But people will see it soon enough. I think Emanuel is going to suffer for that challenge.\n\n2132: GOAL Arsenal 6-0 Sheffield United\n\nMexican wonderkid Carlos Vela beats Nicklas Bendtner to the hat-trick and probably sets the seal on another wonderful night for the Gunners.\n\n2129: GOAL Sunderland 1-2 Northampton\n\nBack in it, Roy Keane's boys. The Northampton defence gets into a horrible mess and Sunderland striker Anthony Stokes is on hand to get the Black Cats back into the game.\n\n2128: \"To be fair to Stevo it's not easy being a Forest fan. I also act like an Arsenal fan sometimes, it's because they remind us of what we once were.\"\n\nForestEgg on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nLove you, son. I almost wish I hadn't spent £27 on Forest 0-0 Charlton on Saturday.\n\n2126: GOAL Sunderland 0-2 Northampton\n\nCupset, cupset, cupset. Colin Larkin, scorer of the first Cobblers goal, gets in a cross and Luke Guttridge gets his name on the scoresheet with a right-foot finish.\n\n2125: Massive apologies to Rotherham. They are of course playing at the Don Valley Stadium. But thanks for not completely slaughtering me!\n\n2123: SENDING OFF\n\nEmanuel Pogatetz has been shown a straight red card at Old Trafford for a foul on Rodrigo Possebon. It's a poor challenge and the Austrian can have few complaints.\n\n2123: \"Is Stevo a real gooner or one of those plastic fans that like Arsenal \"because they play great football\"?\"\n\nSlabber on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nOh please. Yeah, I'm so embarrassed I go on about Arsenal because on nights like tonight they play the kind of football every team in the world should aspire to. So sue me. Oh, and I'm a Forest fan. For the 7,000,000th time. Jeez.\n\n2120: Cristiano Ronaldo has been taken off at Old Trafford, with Carlos Tevez coming on. Not a bad replacement, in fairness.\n\n2119: GOAL Stoke 2-2 Reading\n\nThe Championship side are back on level terms thanks to youngster James Henry's second goal of the evening, this time a lovely left-foot 20-yarder.\n\n2118: SENDING OFF\n\nStephen McPhail is dismissed for a second bookable offence for Cardiff, this time on Jordi Gomez.\n\n2117: GOAL Rotherham 3-1 Southampton\n\nSurely that's game over at Millmoor? Drewe Broughton bags his second goal of the game from 12 yards and Southampton have got it all to do again.\n\n2116: GOAL Liverpool 2-1 Crewe\n\nBrazilian midfielder Lucas eases some nerves at Anfield, rising high to head home past a static visiting defence.\n\n2115: GOAL Watford 1-0 West Ham\n\nJan Lastuvka comes out for a high ball, misses it and the ball hits Hayden Mullins and goes into the West Ham net. Oh dear.\n\n2113: GOAL Man Utd 1-1 Middlesbrough\n\nAdam Johnson silences Old Trafford with a cracking volley - with his right foot, mind - that hits Wes Brown and flies into the United net.\n\n2111: \"I'd love Arsenal if I weren't a very jealous Liverpool fan.\"\n\nLarrySanders on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nThere's always someone better off, always someone worse off.\n\n2108: GOAL Rotherham 2-1 Southampton\n\nLifeline for the Saints, who have had a shocking start to the new season. Stern John, who has just come off the bench, scores a belter from 25 yards, right into the top corner.\n\n2106: \"As good as Arsenal are, the Blades look like they've got stage fright. Against a bunch of kids. How does that work? It's enough to make grown men start arguments with kids cheering the Gunners, which is happening all around me!\"\n\nMagowan, via text, at Arsenal\n\nStill, it only cost a tenner, son.\n\n2104: GOAL Rotherham 2-0 Southampton\n\nCupset on the cards big time here, as Danny Harrison hits a snap-shot into the Southampton net from 25 yards to double the Millers' advantage.\n\n2103: GOAL Leeds 2-2 Hartlepool\n\nWe're all-square at Elland Road again and it's big striker Enoch Showumni who gets Leeds level.\n\n2101: GOAL Arsenal 5-0 Sheffield United\n\nDunno what to say. Jack Wilshere, the 16-year-old, gets himself on the scoresheet at the Emirates - has £10 ever been so well spent as it has by the Arsenal fans tonight?\n\n2100: GOAL Swansea 1-0 Cardiff\n\nThe hosts are ahead in the south Wales derby and it's Jordi Gomez who gets the goal, his left-foot, 20-yard free-kick clipping the heels of Gavin Rae and flying into the Bluebirds' net.\n\n2058: Jason Scotland goes down under a challenge from Cardiff's Roger Johnson in Swansea, but the referee does not give the penalty.\n\n2058: \"United's kids are playing some great stuff and the Stretty is bouncing. Bring on the Manucho express! Cho Cho!\"\n\nJamie, from OT, via text\n\n2056: \"You're happy Crewe have equalised? While also salivating over Arsenal and Ronaldo? Your bias is showing. Not that you'll print this.\"\n\nNoel, via text\n\nThere's always one, isn't there...\n\n2054: GOAL Arsenal 4-0 Sheffield United\n\nThis is getting ridiculous. Carlos Vela, highly rated and in stunning form tonight, races through the Blades defence and with only Paddy Kenny to beat, he cheekily chips the ball over Paddy Kenny. This boy's a Mexican magician.\n\n2053: GOAL Stoke 2-1 Reading\n\nMamady Sidibe gets the Premier League side back in front, hammering a left-foot shot into the net from a tight angle.\n\n2051: I must just mention that Sunderland are now my 'default' team in this season's competition, after they luckily dumped out my boys Forest last time around. Must be why they're losing, then...\n\n2049: \"Stevo once again overlooking the biggest shock of the night, Northampton beating Sunderland! Why do you always overlook us?\"\n\nKent_Cobbler on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nMe, overlook Northampton? Cobblers.\n\n2047: As 16 teams come back out for the second half, it's interval time at Old Trafford and Anfield.\n\n2045: I love the Carling Cup. Arsenal's kids on fire, Ronaldo back in action, Crewe equalising at Anfield. It's all good.\n\n2041: \"First start of the season and Ronaldo's at it again, Old Trafford is booming for a Carling Cup tie and a man just fell down the north stand stairs. This is what Tuesdays are made for.\"\n\nCallum, OT, via text\n\n2038: \"Honestly, how are these kids not in Arsenal and United's first teams? United have been incredible so far. It's like watching one of those all-star matches. Arsenal too, unbelivable. These kids have to play more.\"\n\nZippy, George and Bungle on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\n2035: \"(See 2020 and 2010) Fastest crocodile 11mph, Usain Bolt 23mph.\"\n\nFrom Mark in Swindon, via text\n\nHaha. I can assure you mate, my colleague is not in the same league as Usain Bolt!\n\n2033: Jason Scotland goes perilously close to breaking the deadlock in Wales, but it's still goalless between Swansea and Cardiff.\n\n2031: GOAL Stoke 1-1 Reading\n\nJames Henry scores from the spot for the Royals after a foul in the box on Andre Bikey.\n\n2030: GOAL Arsenal 3-0 Sheffield United\n\nMagnificent. Arsenal have wrapped it up already, this time Nicklas Bendtner setting up Mexican striker Carlos Vela to superbly curl the ball around Paddy Kenny and into the net from 10 yards.\n\n2028: GOAL Arsenal 2-0 Sheffield United\n\nA joy to behold, Arsenal. Aaron Ramsey goes on a fabulous run forward and his cute pass tees up Nicklas Bendtner to pick his spot and shoot into the corner of the net. Glorious.\n\n2026: GOAL Man Utd 1-0 Middlesbrough\n\nRyan Giggs swings in a corner and that man Cristiano Ronaldo rises high, powering a header into the Boro net.\n\n2024: GOAL Liverpool 1-1 Crewe\n\nWell I don't think anyone saw that coming. Crewe win a corner and Diego Cavalieri makes a fine stop to keep out a header before Michael O'Connor gets them back on level terms.\n\n2024: \"(See 1959) I'm at Anfield tonight and the bloke behind me keeps looking at me. I think I've scored here.\"\n\nUsman at Anfield, via text\n\n2020: \"(See 2010) Crocodiles can't run that fast really. They can only run in a straight line and only for a short distance. Steve Irwin taught me that.\"\n\nAdam, Tunbridge Wells, via text\n\n2018: GOAL Leeds 1-2 Hartlepool\n\nRemarkable. Joel Porter makes himself a hero by skipping past a couple of Leeds defenders and smashing a shot into the net from 25 yards out. Cracking goal, cracking tie.\n\n2017: GOAL Arsenal 1-0 Sheffield United\n\nA deserved lead for the Gunners and it is Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner who puts them in front with a lovely side-foot shot past Paddy Kenny from 20 yards. Classy finish.\n\n2015: \"My first week as a student in Cardiff and what a first game to follow the Bluebirds!I Should be out partying but I'd rather follow this game!\"\n\nChris in Cardiff, via text\n\nIt's been a lively start too, with both sides trying to get forward. Jay Bothroyd sees a shot well-saved by Swansea keeper Dorus De Vries.\n\n2014: GOAL Liverpool 1-0 Crewe\n\nGood early start for Liverpool at Anfield, defender Daniel Agger curling a 25-yard free-kick into the top corner.\n\n2011: Arsenal are cranking up the pressure at the Emirates and Paddy Kenny has to be alert to keep out a shot from Johan Djourou.\n\n2010: \"Who would win in a fight - Stevo or a bear?\"\n\nthick-as-a-brick on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nI'd have to say a bear, unless that particular bear was rubbish at fighting. That reminds me, a colleague once claimed in the office that he could out-run a crocodile...\n\n2008: GOAL Rotherham 1-0 Southampton\n\nThe League Two team get us really in the cupset mood by going ahead against Southampton, Drewe Broughton scrambling the ball home from two yards.\n\n2006: GOAL Sunderland 0-1 Northampton\n\nCupset chance. The much-changed Wearsiders have not started well and they go a goal down at the Stadium of Light to their League One opponents, Colin Larkin putting the Cobblers in front.\n\n2001: The games at Old Trafford and Anfield get under way.\n\n2000: GOAL Leeds 1-1 Hartlepool\n\nRobert Snodgrass scores his second goal of the season, slotting into the back of the net after a defensive mistake from the visitors. Back on level terms at Elland Road.\n\n1959: \"I'm at Anfield tonight and I'm sat behind a man who looks just like the guy from DIC, the group supposedly wanting to buy out our American owners. Is the deal still on?\"\n\nPete, via text\n\nYou tell me pal - surely you've got to ask him?\n\n1955: GOAL Stoke 1-0 Reading\n\nFirst blood is drawn at the Britannia Stadium and it's the Premier League side who edge in front, thanks to Vincent Pericard heading in a corner.\n\n1954: \"I am SO pleased for Ben Amos tonight. He goes to my school and is a real inspiration. He has already got some England youth team caps and now to get his first Manchester United senior appearance, I am thrilled for him.\"\n\nMustardo on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nAltogether now, aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh.\n\n1952: \"It's my birthday today, 37 years young! Perfect prezzy would be for Arsenal and Man U to lose and Liverpool to win. C'mon the Reds, the Blades and the Boro.\"\n\nKing Rich, Windermere, via text\n\n1947: GOAL Leeds 0-1 Hartlepool\n\nThe visitors have gone in front in tonight's League One derby and this would be a bit of a shock. It's Ritchie Jones who puts Hartlepool ahead with a far post header past Casper Ankergren.\n\n1945: Eight of tonight's games are due to get under way.\n\n1944: Fulham boss Roy Hodgson has shaken up his team for their trip to Burnley, making eight changes, with only Paul Konchesky, Andy Johnson and Zoltan Gera staying in the team after the 1-0 defeat at Blackburn on Saturday.\n\n1943: Ben Amos starts in goal for Man Utd tonight. \"He was born in April 1990,\" says a colleague of mine. \"Making him 28\". Look, we all make mistakes.\n\n1940: \"(See 1908) Oi! If you're going to have a cheap dig at Chelsea at least have the sense to pick a poor year for us. Chelsea finished fifth in 1989-90, two behind Arsenal . Man Utd were 13th that season.\"\n\nBenches boy, via text\n\nHaha. You guys tonight...\n\n1936: \"Boro, to win, at Old Trafford, with United fielding Cristiano Ronaldo? Tell me Stevo, are you under a lot of stress at work?\"\n\nUNITED TILL I DIE on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nHaha. Not really. I just love cupsets, me.\n\n1933: I've got to point you all in the direction of our brand new signing at BBC Sport - much-travelled-midfielder-with-a-famous-dad Gavin Strachan, who will be writing his own blog for us throughout the season. I know what you're thinking, but give him a go. I've just read his first effort, and it's a very, very good start. Fill your boots...\n\nWelcome to the Gavin Strachan blog\n\n1930: Stevo's Carling Cup Predos:\n\nArsenal 3-1 Sheffield United\n\nBurnley 2-0 Fulham\n\nLeeds 3-0 Hartlepool\n\nLiverpool 2-1 Crewe\n\nMan Utd 2-3 Middlesbrough\n\nRotherham 1-2 Southampton\n\nStoke City 1-2 Reading\n\nSunderland 4-0 Northampton\n\nSwansea 2-1 Cardiff\n\nWatford 1-3 West Ham\n\n1928: \"My dad was playing for Oldham that night! I was there, anyone else out there?\"\n\nAnonymous, via text\n\nYou largely need to tell us A) Who you are and, crucially, B) Who your dad is. Also (see 1912), my gaffer H has just asked me to remind people that Scarborough beat Chelsea in the League Cup that year. See how the mighty were rubbish?\n\n1926: It's change o'clock at the Britannia Stadium as Stoke axe eight players from their last Premier League games and Reading a remarkable 10 from their last Championship match. That was the game when the ref gave Reading a goal for a shot that went 10 yards wide, by the way.\n\nLeague says no to Watford replay\n\n1923: Team news from Anfield and Daniel Agger is in Liverpool's central defence, while keeper Diego Cavalieri, right-back Phillip Degen and striker David Ngog are also in the starting line-up, making their full debuts. Steven Gerrard is missing altogether, but Fernando Torres and Robbie Keane are on the bench.\n\n1921: \"My dad desperately tried to get tickets for the Swansea-Cardiff game tonight, but had no chance. Thank the lord - or I may not have been seeing him again! Expect one hell of a derby - Swansea and Cardiff is the fiercest rivalry in British football.\"\n\nCardiff Hotspur (Tottenham 'til I die) on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\n1919: Marton Fulop, Phil Bardsley, Danny Collins, Grant Leadbitter, Andy Reid, Carlos Edwards, David Healy and Daryl Murphy all get starts for Sunderland tonight, but derby hero Michael Chopra is on the bench.\n\n1916: \"The Carling Cup is only unimportant to the top four who devalue the competition and deprive ticket-buying customers by fielding second-string sides. What happened to fines for fielding weakened teams?\"\n\nSteve, Swindon, via text\n\nNot sure I agree with that. I mean, look at Arsenal. Their kids have been good enough to get to the final, so it's not their fault if teams can't beat them. It would be nice to see Man Utd have a decent run, though. Cristiano Ronaldo starts tonight, by the way.\n\n1912: My gaffer tonight, let's call him H, tells me he was at Boundary Park 19 years ago to see Frankie Bunn smash in six for Oldham against Scarborough in a 7-0 romp. That was in the third round of the League Cup. More of the same tonight, please.\n\n1908: \"(See 1900) Er... Luton Town and Oldham. Not exactly the Big Four, Stevo.\"\n\nSeaside_Exile on 606\n\nJoin the debate on 606\n\nYep, not 'Big Four', largely because English football didn't have a 'Big Four' back then. Tell you what - you have a look back in the record books and tell me how good Chelsea were in those days. A different time...\n\n1907: Arsenal, apparently, are playing their youngest ever side tonight against Sheffield United. Including Jack Wilshere, the 16-year-old midfielder. Blimey.\n\n1905: But enough about me. Let's get in the mood for an awesome night of cup drama. \"Will there be any Carling Cupsets today?\" I hear you collectively ask. Well, Stevo's Predos will be along at 1930, so go with the opposite of those bad boys and you might be on to a winner. Meanwhile, let's get some banter started, yeah? Text me on 81111 and get involved on 606. I'm waiting...\n\nJoin the debate on 606"
