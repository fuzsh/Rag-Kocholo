        "text": "The era when several European and foreign-language actors and actresses became household names in the U.S, has long been gone, although there are still a few exceptions. But if you consider Pola Negri (Poland), Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman (Sweden), Marlene Dietrich and Luise Rainer (Germany), Leslie Caron (France), Audrey Hepburn (The Netherlands, although born in Belgium), and Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida (Italy), those are just a few of the most prominent and enduring continental stars who made it overseas, while later on, let’s say from the 1960s, only a few European stars such as Claudia Cardinale joined their ranks in America. Also Elke Sommer, born Elke Schletz in Berlin in 1940, managed to follow in their footsteps.\n\nDefinitely something to talk about with Ms. Sommer when I got to spend an afternoon with her at her home in 2003, after being introduced to her by a mutual and beloved friend, casting director Marvin Paige (1927-2013).\n\nMs. Sommer, it’s quite an accomplishment to follow in the footsteps of these renowned actresses. How did you manage to do that?\n\nYou know, I’m a very down-to-earth country person. I think the fact that so few people made it here in America since those big stars is because they maybe were trying too hard. I remember talking to Senta Berger; she was very eager to make it here. She wanted to get an agent, a manager,… and I said, ‘Senta, if it is supposed to come, it will come.’ I guess the total honesty, perhaps naivité, in whatever I was doing, in whatever movie I did, helped me a lot. Not once in my whole life have I been bothered by a director, a producer or an executive of a studio in any way or form. I never was a victim of the casting couch, I never had to turn anybody down, slap anybody’s hands or walk out on anyone. Maybe I still have that kind of naivité, I don’t know. But I do know I still have that enjoyment of work, of life. And I think the Americans like less complicated things; they like honesty, they are open about things. I guess that is why they accepted me.\n\nWhen you planned to become a diplomatic translator for the UN, you were sidetracked into a modeling career; that led to your German movie debut in Georg Tressler’s “Das Totenschiff” [1959]. In the following years, you appeared in more than twenty European films in supporting and leading roles opposite actors like Horst Buchholz, Adriano Celentano, Gert Fröbe, and Alain Delon. You already had a very interesting career before coming over to America, didn’t you?\n\nBefore I went to America, I had worked in Spain, Italy, and then in England, where I made “The Victors” [opposite her contemporary Romy Schneider] for producer Carl Forman. I never had time to think really; I always worked, and I did it as well as I possibly could. Throughout my career, I was always very humble about it to be able and work from the very beginning. Besides doing favors for my English producers, playing a cameo, a baroness or something—because they were my friends—I always worked with total innocence and big, open eyes and ears to learn from everyone, whether it was an electrician, the star or the director, and I never pursued an acting career. I think that makes a fantastic amount of difference: I became a part of this business without being instrumental of wanting it badly. For my first movie in 1959, I got paid five thousand Marks, and as I had enrolled already at the University, I thought this would pay my entire first year so I wouldn’t have to work on the side to pay my college. Then the second movie came along, and I did as well as I could, that’s for sure. But quite honestly, I did it for the money.\n\nWhat was life like for you and your family back then in Germany?\n\nWe lived in poverty. At one point, I milked ten cows a day for seven days a week for a few Marks to get some money. Then my father [a Lutheran Minister] passed away when I was fourteen and until I started working as an actress, we lived on seventy Marks a month. So I was very fortunate when I started acting.\n\nWhich picture brought you to the U.S.?\n\n“Das Mädchen und der Staatsanwalt” [a.k.a. “The Girl and the Prosecutor,” 1962] with Wolfgang Preiss, which was shown in Los Angeles for the Golden Globes. Producer Pandro S. Berman had seen it—he was impressed with her screen persona and was convinced she would be perfect as the Swedish diplomat in “The Prize.” When I first met him, he had like eight or nine Oscars on his mantlepiece [laughs]. Anyway, somehow he got my number in my house in Germany, and one day he called me. My mother said, ‘Elke, there’s someone from Los Angeles on the phone.’ ‘Los Angeles?!’ So I said, ‘Hello?’ ‘Are you Elke Sommer?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Would you like to star in a picture opposite Paul Newman?’ I said, ‘Sure, I’d love to.’ ‘But is it really you?’ he asked. He was concerned and also wanted to be assured that my English was okay, and he asked when I could come over, he would send me the tickets, etc. Once I arrived here, my first encounter with the American way of filming, preparing shots, and shooting scenes was quite different from what I was used to in Europe. We had rehearsed “The Prize” like a play. [Director] Mark Robson would make sure the camera would be over there, rehearse our positions, prepare the close-ups, etc. It was completely the opposite of what I had done before: I had just come from Berlin, doing a movie of the week, and we had shot twenty-eight pages a day from 7:30 in the morning until 9:30 at night. In America, things had to be perfect while I’m not a perfectionist at all, I like little flaws. It’s like having a new car: if it doesn’t have one little bent, that makes me nervous. If it has one little bent and the second one comes, it’s not so bad.\n\nWere you welcomed and embraced by the American audience as their new star?\n\nYes, although my own ambition was primarily to be a good actress. There were parts out here I would have loved to play, but as the business is mostly run by Jewish people, I did get some unfair reactions. People would say things like, ‘You know, I lost my father in Auschwitz or in Dachau,’ things like that would happen. I tried to get it out of my mind because I did not feel guilty in any way—besides the tremendous collective guilt we have anyhow, being totally 100 percent German-born and tracing my family back up until the year 1125. I do know for a fact that my dad was in no way connected with all that, and we also suffered tremendously during those years. But still, after many years, you have to pay for it. And believe me, I did pay for it, and it broke my heart. The fact that I happened to be German was hindering me. It wasn’t an open hostility. I was always easygoing. I get along with everybody. I’m funny and bright, I can talk to people, and I have a lot of very good Jewish friends. But in isolated occasions, I found that, even though I was perfectly right for a part and would have been able to do a fantastic job, they preferred someone who was not German. This may be the reason why so very few post-war German actors and actresses made it over here since then—except for someone like Jürgen Prochnow, who’s the only one I can think of out the top of my head who has a name over here, not a household name, but a name. That has a lot to do with it, I think. But there’s also another reason why so few Germans made it here in America. The talent that accumulates here in LA from all over the world is absolutely incredible—they come from Sweden, from Denmark, from Poland, from Russia,…—they know what they’re doing. They have diction lessons, dancing lessons, singing lessons, while in Germany, the talented actors have the talent for acting. But the big misconception in Germany is that if you’re, let’s say, a comedian—to me, the hardest thing to do because of the timing—it didn’t mean that much if you could make people laugh. That’s why I also appeared on the stage, both in drama and comedy, to show them that I was able to act.\n\nWhat about Curt Jurgens, who worked steadily in the U.S.?\n\nCurt Jurgens and also Gert Fröbe were very good at what they were doing, but they were not diversified because they never learned how to be diversified. You couldn’t put Curt Jurgens in a musical; he was always the actor. When I first came here, I felt totally inadequate. Everybody took lessons, they had lots of hair. They were slim. They had long legs. They had their teeth fixed; they had like sixty-four teeth [laughs]. I always felt they were physically much superior to me. So one day, when I was doing “The Prize,” I was sitting next to Mr. Berman in the commissary where we were having lunch, and I saw these beautiful women coming in. I said, ‘Pandro, why did you call me in Germany when you got all these beautiful women here at the studio?’ And he said, ‘You have to look at the screen. Behind you there is an aura. I can’t explain it, but you got it and they haven’t, despite all their beauty, their physical charms, and their features.’ That was a very nice thing to say.\n\nYou then appeared in several films, from the comedy “A Shot in the Dark” [1964, the second film in the Pink Panther series] to Norman Jewison’s comedy satire “The Art of Love” [1965] or “The Money Trap” [1966], with Glenn Ford played a policeman-turned-thief with Elke Sommer as his wife and Rita Hayworth in a supporting role as an old girlfriend of Ford. It seems you were never typecast.\n\nThat’s right, but I always adored comedy, and lucky for me, “A Shot in the Dark” has become a classic. It has happened frequently that I am on a golf course, for example, with the regular crowd on Tuesdays, and from a distance, I hear someone yelling, ‘Hey Maria Gambrelli! How are you!?’ [Maria Gambrelli is the part she played in “A Shot in the Dark”]. It makes me feel very privileged—all of the “Pink Panther” films were very good, and I’m very happy that a lot of people say “A Shot in the Dark” is the best, which I think is very true. I once did a series up in Jasper, a little Canadian village in British Columbia, and in a theater, they showed “A Shot in the Dark.” The whole cast and crew went to see it, so I had to go too. And I liked it! Peter Sellers had this enormous tragedy which made this genius timing; even though I was very young and inexperienced compared to him, God had given me something to at least hold up with him, and even in some very few miniscule moments even be better. We had our lines to say, we rehearsed, but we also improvised within the scenes. He would say something, or I would start saying something, and he would pick up on it. The chemistry was there, and you don’t know if it is luck or something. We weren’t soulmates or anything, we had completely different lives, but we were interested in the same things. He was a very tragic person who had very good friends; he was full of energy, and had this wonderful and bright mind, combined with a sense of humor which was so right on. That makes you a very good dramatic actor and a comedian as well, which people appreciate all the more. It’s very easy to make you cry; it’s hard to make you laugh. And can actors who can make you cry also make you laugh? Unfortunately, many of them can’t, and this is something you cannot learn, but Peter Sellers had it all.\n\nLater on, looking at the roles you played then, you also showed you had progressed as an actress, didn’t you?\n\nYou have to progress. I also worked on the stage, and about five years ago, I directed a play. There was this actor who hardly looked at me because I am a woman, and he didn’t want to be directed by a woman. Through my male assistant, I tried to explain to him that he had no feeling for comedy. He had the most wonderful lines to say, but he wouldn’t move in the lines, and he was always very surprised when I got incredible laughs. I told him, ‘The house has to come down when say these lines, but you screw it up because you don’t listen to me.’ And then, I think during the third performance, he did it the way I asked him to.\n\nHow do you look back to all the roles you played so far?\n\nI did them without ever being groomed into that part or into that type of character. Everybody always said I was a sex symbol—okay, I posed for Playboy; my ex-husband took the pictures, and they are great. But Rita Hayworth or Ava Gardner, for example, they were sex symbols; they were icons to me. Or Bette Davis, she didn’t have the most beautiful face, but what an incredible power! She didn’t have to be perfect; she didn’t have to be gorgeous with silicons put in compared to what’s happening today. If I have to pick an actress I really like and makes films now, I would say Meg Ryan because what you see is what you get. She’s lovely. She can act, she is honest. I can totally identify with her work. But today everything is very short-lived, I believe—unless you’re a star like Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock, of course. With a lot of today’s actresses, their acting is great, but somehow I miss something, the sincerity maybe. I was in the medium stage, between the really big studio stars, who were created by the studios, and today’s stars. I was never created, whereas today, they create in another way, a sort of desperation about the fame. We worked, went home, cooked dinner for our husbands and families, and sometimes went out. But it wasn’t like, ‘Who has the biggest bust?’ And today, they do make wonderful movies—coming from abroad, you always have and had to pay your dues to work in this country because for each one of you, there are fifty others waiting in the wings. A lot of Europeans who came over here twenty years ago, are still waiting for their break. They’re still going to classes, and nothing will ever happen. One can still go to college at the age of forty and get a bachelor’s degree, just in case. I never had that drive. Let’s say Richard Zanuck would be sitting over there in a restaurant, two tables further. I wouldn’t get up to go to the bathroom, just that he might notice me. If he’d come over, that’s wonderful, but I’d never cross the street to get any advantage or work.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt has to do a lot with the way you were brought up, what your father was like, what your family was like, what your own personal pride is. Suppose somebody would say to me, ‘My goodness, you were the most gorgeous thing anyone ever laid their eyes on,’ well, I never thought of myself like that at all. One day, a gentleman from the German magazine Der Spiegel interviewed me and asked, ‘How does it feel to know that two million men—or something like that, I don’t know the exact number he used—around the world go to sleep and think of you?’ I said, ‘What do you mean, how does it feel?’ You know, that’s a thought which is so strange to me and so totally unrealistic.\n\nWhen Playboy magazine celebrated its forty-fifth anniversary, you were voted among the sexiest actresses of the century, ranking at number 39, before Marlene Dietrich [#32]. Did that have any effect on you?\n\nLet me tell you this. One of the reasons why I also paint, is because it is something I can do by myself. I get the idea, execute the idea, and it becomes full of life, full of love, brightness, and color. My whole life, I have been directed, I have been produced, I spoke the lines written for the character. I was always playing, and the only thing I could bring was my energy. So what is it, this sex appeal? Why was I voted in this list of most sexy women? It’s not because of my looks or anything; it’s because of the energy. People are sexy—although I hate that word—because of their energy. You can have the most beautiful person in the world, she can be perfect, but maybe nothing comes across, nothing you want to live with or nothing you want to hold. It’s an energy that comes from the inside, from your heart, from your soul, or from your intelligence.\n\nAnother important instrument for any actor is the voice?\n\nAbsolutely. I made it a point to never watch anything I have done, besides having to dub sometimes, like “The Oscar,” for example [dubbed in German]. It is something I always tried to do whenever I could because I think the voice is incredibly important to an actor. It is as important as your acting or as your looks. People have told me they saw my movies where I didn’t have the time to dub myself, and they said, ‘We couldn’t watch it, Elke.’ The Germans used to give me a very high voice, a blonde voice, and it ruined everything. So yes, the voice is extremely important.\n\nIn the 1980s, you hosted a TV show on PBS called ‘Painting with Elke Sommer’ and wrote a book, also called ‘Painting With Elke Sommer’ [1984], demonstrating various materials, techniques, etc. That’s a second career to you?\n\nPainting is very individual, and I found out that it’s a very quiet, introvert occupation. I can sit there for six, seven hours without going to the bathroom, without drinking or eating anything, just totally engrossed in my painting. When it’s finished, when it has become a product, it is not a co-production, not the result of a collaboration between actors. It is all mine. That gives me a lot of pleasure, and I’m proud of it. It is the ideal antipole to acting, which is very public.\n\nBeverly Hills, California\n\nMarch 2003\n\n“A Shot in the Dark” (1964, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nDAS TOTENSCHIFF (1959) DIR – PROD Georg Tressler SCR Hans Jacoby (novel by B.
