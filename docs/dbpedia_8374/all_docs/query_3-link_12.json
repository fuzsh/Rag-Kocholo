        "text": "About the Event\n\nThe Deutsche Oper Berlin presents Strauss's 'Intermezzo' in a production by Tobias Kratzer.\n\nNew opera material for a new time — this was not only sought by the avant‐gardists in the 1920s. Old master Richard Strauss went even further and not only brought a story from modern life onto the stage, but also, barely veiled, his own married life. The marital war between a successful music director and his wife, triggered by a harmless misunderstanding, is the dominant theme of the comedy INTERMEZZO, which premiered in 1924.\n\nBut unlike 'neutoners' such as Hindemith, Krenek and Schönberg, Strauss did not create a new musical language for his contemporary opera, but instead endowed his marital crisis story with an orchestral opulence that need not fear comparison with successful pieces such as DER ROSENKAVALIER and ARABELLA. And with the composer's wife Christine, he created another stage‐dominating female figure, in whose Straussian expansive vocal lines there is not only room for outbursts of temperament, but also space for the shadowy zones of unexpressed longings. service of a High Romantic expressivity.\n\nIn German, with German and English surtitles."
