        "text": "French publications\n\n2020\n\nBourgeois, Bertrand. Petits poèmes à voir: de la bambochade textuelle aux pochades en prose (1842-1948). Hermann, 2020.\n\nProse poetry contributes to the reversal of Ut Pictura Poesis in 19th Century French Literature. Rather than using ekphrasis to imitate painting, the prose poem competes with minor visual arts through an appropriation of their generic denominations (sketches, still life, etc.). From the rediscovery of Rembrandt in the 19th Century to Kupka’s experimentations, light and colour are two major obsessions of visual artists which also fascinate poets of the time. Their rhetoric becomes plastic in order to transform chiaroscuro and colours into poetic figures. From Aloysius Bertrand to Francis Ponge, this monograph revisits the history of the 'poème en prose' as a genre defying established literary classifications. It does so by scrutinising how poets turn visual motifs (the window, the mirror, the eye) into the textual signs of poems to be seen rather than read.

Figures du départ dans la novela sentimental traduite en français (première moitié du XVIe siècle),” in Labère, N. and Pierdominici, L. (eds.,). A tant m’en vois. Figures du départ au Moyen Âge. Aras Edizioni, 2020.\n\nThe farewell scene plays an essential role in Renaissance sentimental fictions. Be it the separation of lovers, or the farewell to family or relatives, it constitutes the apogee of the story and most often closes the narration. Its stakes are not only narrative, but also moral, and stylistic.

(eds.,). Ethical Futures and Global Science Fiction. Palgrave Macmillan, 2020.\n\nEthical Futures and Global Science Fiction explores the ethical concerns and dimensions of representations of the future of global science fiction, focusing on the issues that dominate utopian, dystopian and science fiction literature... The volume delves into a range of ethical questions of immediate contemporary relevance, including environmental ethics, postcolonial ethics, social justice, animal ethics and the ethics of alterity.

Routledge, 2020.\n\nDutton, Jacqueline. “The four pillars of utopian wine Terroir, viticulture, degustation and cellars,” in Dutton, Jacqueline and Howland, Peter (eds.,) Wine, Terroir and Utopia: Making New Worlds. Routledge, 2020.\n\nHowland, Peter and Dutton, Jacqueline. “Making new worlds: The utopian potentials of wine and terroir,” in Dutton, Jacqueline and Howland, Peter (eds.,) Wine, Terroir and Utopia: Making New Worlds. Routledge, 2020.\n\nWine, Terroir and Utopia critically explores these three concepts from multi-disciplinary and intersecting perspectives, focusing on the ways in which they collide to make new worlds, new wines, new places and new peoples. Wine, terroir and utopia are all rooted in natural, spatial and temporal realities, yet all are unable to exist without purposeful human intervention. This edited volume highlights the theoretical and analytical lens of diverse scholars, who critically discuss a dazzling array of intersecting realities and imaginaries – economic, political, cultural, social and geological – and in doing this challenge many of our deeply-held responses to utopia.

Anarchism became the creative and destructive principle of the avant-garde movements that arose from the ever more acute crisis of the European order and civil society of those years. The avant-garde moment, carried by a European intelligentsia between aesthetic protest and political revolt, aimed at overcoming the boundaries between art, life and politics and sparked a search for new possibilities in art as well as for new, anti-bourgeois, social and sexual liberation promising forms of life, from artist colonies to political communities.

Palgrave, 2019.\n\nThis book presents a dynamic history of the ways in which translators are trusted and distrusted.

By examining theories of trust from sociological, philosophical, and historical studies, and with reference to interdisciplinarity, the authors outline a methodology for approaching translation history and intercultural mediation from three discrete, concurrent perspectives on trust and translation: the interpersonal, the institutional and the regime-enacted.

Brill Academic Publishers, 2020.\n\nIn A Grammar of Lopit, Jonathan Moodie and Rosey Billington provide the first detailed description of Lopit, an Eastern Nilotic language traditionally spoken in the Lopit Mountains in South Sudan. Drawing on extensive primary data, the authors describe the phonology, morphology, and syntax of the Lopit language. Their analyses offer new insights into phenomena characteristic of Nilo-Saharan languages, such as ‘Advanced Tongue Root’ vowel distinctions, tripartitite number marking, and marked-nominative case systems, and they uncover patterns which are previously unattested within the Eastern Nilotic family, such as a three-way contrast in aspect, number marking with the ‘greater singular’, and two kinds of inclusory constructions. This book offers a significant contribution to the descriptive and typological literature on African languages.

Translinguistics: Negotiating Innovation and Ordinariness. Routledge – Taylor & Francis, 2020.\n\nTranslinguistics represents a powerful alternative to conventional paradigms of language such as bilingualism and code-switching, which assume the compartmentalisation of different ‘languages ’ into fixed and arbitrary boundaries. Translinguistics more accurately reflects the fluid use of linguistic and semiotic resources in diverse communities. This ground-breaking volume showcases work from leading as well as emerging scholars in sociolinguistics and other language-oriented disciplines and collectively explores and aims to reconcile the distinction between ‘innovation’ and ‘ordinariness’ in translinguistics.

Tense and Aspect in Second Language Acquisition and Learner Corpus Research. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2020.\n\nThe expression of temporal relations, notably through tense and aspect, is central in all processes of communication, but commonly perceived and described as a major hurdle for non-native speakers. While this topic has already received considerable attention in the SLA literature, it features less prominently in recent corpus-based studies of learner language. This volume intends to close this gap. More information...\n\n2019\n\nBarwick, Linda, Green, Jennifer and Vaarzon-Morel, Petronella (eds.,). Archival returns: Central Australia and beyond.

There are chapters on phonetics and phonology, socio-phonetics, lexicon and discourse-pragmatics as these elements are core to understanding any variety of English, especially within the World Englishes paradigm. It then considers what are arguably the most salient aspects of variation within Australian English and finally focuses on historical, attitudinal and planning aspects of Australian English.

De Gruyter Mouton, 2019.\n\nMurrinhpatha is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in a region of tropical savannah and tidal inlets on the north coast of the continent. Some 3000 speakers live mostly in the towns of Wadeye and Nganmarriyanga, though they maintain close ties to their traditional lands, totems and spirit ancestors. Murrinhpatha word structure is highly complex, and quite distinct from the better-known Pama-Nyungan languages of central and southern Australia. Murrinhpatha is characterised by prolific compounding, clitic clusters, cumulative inflection, irregular allomorphy and phonological assimilation. This book provides a comprehensive account of these phenomena, giving particular attention to questions of morphological constituency, lexical storage, and whether there is really such thing as a ‘word’ unit.

Oxford University Press, 2019.\n\nThis book has two goals, each related to the validity of language assessment. The first goal is to explore the difference between fairness and justice in language assessment. The authors distinguish internal and external dimensions of the equitable and just treatment of individuals taking language tests which are used as gatekeeping devices to determine access to education and employment, immigrant status, citizenship, and other rights. The second goal is to show how the extent of test fairness can be demonstrated and improved using the tools of psychometrics, in particular the models collectively known as Rasch measurement.

Typological Studies in Language 118, 2018.\n\nThis chapter investigates evidentiality and egophoricity in Sherpa, spoken in eastern Nepal. It seeks to build on existing accounts of Sherpa evidentials through an investigation of what triggers evidential and egophoric markers. I show that in some instances the trigger appears to be grammatically and temporally-based, in others it is speaker knowledge or evidence-based and in others it is motivated by the volitionality of the agent. The relations between each of these factors is examined here as part of an overall investigation into the Sherpa verbal system.

University of Toronto Press, 2020.\n\nControl and Resistance reveals the various ways in which food writing of the early-Franco era was a potent political tool, producing ways of eating and thinking about food that privileged patriotism over personal desire. The author examines a diverse range of official and non-official food texts to highlight how discourse helped construct and contest identities in line with the three ideological pillars of the regime: autarky, prescriptive gender roles, and monolithic nationalism. Official food discourse produced an audience with a taste for local foodstuffs, and also created a unified gastronomic space in which regional cuisines were co-opted for the purposes of culinary nationalism.

Due precisely to this marginalised position within the literary system it has never been possible to speak of a homosexual genre; Critical accounts of modern Spanish literature have considered this dispersion as a sign of poor aesthetic or intellectual quality. The main idea of this book is precisely that there are structures that connect these texts to each other, structures that are clearly perceived through an intertextual awareness and repetitive procedures: insistence on similar arguments, construction of a series of typical characters, recurrence of certain metaphors, tendency to use certain formal moulds, etc. This type of literature, then, is endowed with a certain generic unit, based not only on the common use of the homophobic theme, but on the recurrence of certain formal features.

Its objective is twofold: to delve into the discourses and figurations of gay, lesbian and trans masculinities through very diverse documents, with a clearly interdisciplinary will, in order to illuminate a reality scarcely served by the human and social sciences in Spain. It is especially pertinent to introduce and value the productivity in this context of a concept such as \"masculinity\", which should be associated with the power structures derived from the legitimation of patriarchy, for the analysis of \"sexual dissidence\" in our recent history.

Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2016.\n\nThis comprehensive assessment of transpacific economic integration explores the many ways that new approaches to multilateral cooperation, and notably the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), are transforming the regional landscape. Reflecting diverse views on the merits of new and wide-ranging agreements, the authors consider: To what extent will the TPP facilitate the US \"pivot\" to Asia at a time when China, not a TPP member, is attempting to shape regional economic dynamics?

Australian-Latin American Relations: New Links in A Changing Global Landscape. Palgrage MacMillan, 2016.\n\nUntil recently, Australia and Latin America were considered irrelevant to one another. The prevailing perception in Australia had been that Latin America was too remote, disconnected, and politically irrelevant to warrant serious scholarly or public attention. This pioneering interdisciplinary book ventures into the new space of Australian-Latin American relations, exploring multiple dimensions of the rapidly changing landscape within a global context.

Images of Women in Hispanic Culture. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016.\n\nThis book studies the ways traditional polarized images of women have been used and challenged in the Hispanic world, especially during the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century by writers and the media, but also in earlier time periods. The chapters analyze the image of women in specific political periods such as Francoism or the Kirchners' administration, stereotypes of women in films in Mexico and Chile, and the representation of women in textbooks, among other topics.

Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016.\n\nMany \"translation solutions\" (often called \"procedures,\" “\"echniques,\" or \"strategies\") have been proposed over the past 50 years or so in French, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian, English, Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian, Czech, and Slovak. This book analyzes, criticizes and compares them, proposing a new list of solutions that can be used in training translators to work between many languages. The book also traces out an entirely new history of contemporary translation studies. More information...\n\n2015\n\nAnderson, Lara. \"Spain,\" in Saler, M. (ed.,). The Fin-de-Siècle World.

Brepols Publishers, 2015.\n\nThe subject of this monograph is protest music and 'dissident' composers and musicians during the twentieth century, with a particular focus on the forms with which dissent may be expressed in music and the ways composers and performers have adopted stances on political and social dissent. In the present volume, twenty-one articles by scholars of different nationalities explore not only the way in which protest music is articulated in artistic-cultural discourse and the political matter, but also the role it played in situations of mutual benefit.

Vol. 24 Vigo Academia del Hispanismo, 2015.\n\nThe essays gathered in this volume interrogate from several angles the images of a reconstructed Spain that Spanish cinema of the last years of the 20th century and of the first decade of the 21st century transmits to national and international audiences. Different meanings of the term image and its different uses are addressed, in a deliberate attempt to problematize apparently stable notions such as country image, national reputation, stereotype, and cultural perception.

And Translation Changed the World (and the World Changed Translation).

Whether by conflict or cooperation, translation has played a major role in the evolution of societies and it has evolved with them. This volume offers different perspectives on, and approaches to, similar topics and situations within different countries and cultures through the work of young scholars. More information..."
