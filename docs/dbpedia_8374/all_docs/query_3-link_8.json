        "text": "The first English language scholarly collection of articles on the leading Berlin based German artist and film-maker Ulrike Ottinger. The articles engage with the full range of the works, from the early Berlin feature films of the 1970s and .'80s to the ethnographic documentaries also including the art exhibitions, photography shows, installations, and artist books. The book brings together feminist film theorists with art historians and cultural theorists, each with a distinctive and detailed perspective on the queer fabulist genres of Ottinger now in her 80s.\n\nList of Figures\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nIntroduction – Angela McRobbie\n\nPART ONE: The Wide Expanse of Work\n\n1.

This monumental collection of essays and commentaries offers an essential tribute to Ottinger’s importance. Accessible, enlightening and scholarly, the breadth and comprehensiveness of Angela McRobbie’s Ulrike Ottinger: Film, Art and the Ethnographic Imagination, will undoubtedly introduce her work to new audiences. This important book achieves two striking things: it demonstrates how contemporary Ottinger will always be and cements her legacy and reputation as one of the most significant and influential artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.'\n\nStella Bruzzi FBA, Dean of Arts and Humanities and Professor of Film Studies, UCL\n\n'The wonderfully heterodox nature of Ulrike Ottinger’s work is captured here by leading scholars from a number of fields, lending this collection of essays a prismatic quality. Paying homage to the variety of form, from film and photography to sculpture and installations, and always with an eye to artifice, what comes into focus above all else is Ottinger’s unending romance with performance and provocation. The currents of thought travelling through these essays explore the ways in which the performative in Ottinger’s work meets the particularity of place, only to confound the idea that one is fluid and the other fixed; indeed, a documentary may turn out to be a fable, and often does. Much more than a guide to Ottinger’s prodigious output, although it serves that purpose too, this book provides a timely critical engagement with one of the most prolific and singular artists of our times.'\n\nJanet Harbord, Queen Mary, University of London"
