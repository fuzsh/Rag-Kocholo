This demonstrates your willingness to step out of your comfort zone and contribute to the company's success. 💡Share Innovative Ideas Bring fresh, innovative ideas to the table during meetings. Being a source of creativity and innovation can set you apart and show your dedication to driving the company forward. 💃 Showcase Team Contributions In the words of Billy Flynn from Chicago, give them the old razzle-dazzle. Highlight the achievements of your team and give credit where it’s due. This not only shows that you are a team player but also reflects positively on your leadership and collaborative skills.

Before heading into the weekend, I wanted to share these quick thoughts. LinkedIn can be a lonely place for a job seeker or someone struggling professionally. However, it’s also a great place to put a little love out there. Here are a few ways to show some love on LinkedIn. None of these gestures need to take more than one minute. Endorse a skill on someone's profile. Write a recommendation for a colleague or connection. These can be incredibly helpful when they are looking for their next job. Comment positively on someone's post. Comments are currently the gold standard of social engagement, so take a few extra seconds after slamming that like button. Thank someone publicly for their help or mentorship. Send a personalized connection request with a note. Engage with a company post you admire or support. Share a success story about a project or collaboration. Participate in a LinkedIn group discussion related to your field. Post a shoutout to a colleague or connection for their work. Offer to help someone with a job search or career advice. Congratulate someone on a work anniversary. Recommend a book or resource that you found valuable. Introduce two connections who could benefit from knowing each other. Share your professional milestones with gratitude to those who helped you along the way. Send a thank-you message after a meeting or event. Many times, tons of work goes into organizing events! Highlight a team achievement or project success. To amp it up, tag individuals with thoughtful notes on their unique impact. Share a testimonial about a product or service you used. Express appreciation for someone's post or content. Update your profile to reflect recent achievements. Engage with posts from industry leaders and influencers. Reach down the ladder. Offer to mentor someone in your field. Share positive feedback from clients or customers. How do you show kindness to your colleagues, friends, or even your boss? I'd love to know!

Let me explain. A few nights ago, I was up late scrolling through my Facebook, like you do. I found this clip from a coaching session I did a few years ago. My client, a successful and accomplished professional, was still convinced that she had conned dozens (if not hundreds!) of people into thinking she deserved to be where she was. Instead of celebrating her achievements, she had a script of excuses that explained why she got this far. 🃏 “I tricked them.” 🍀 “I got lucky.” 🔎 “They hired me without looking too closely.” 📸 “They didn’t see the full picture, or they would have chosen differently.” We all know about imposter syndrome—if not by name, then we know it by reputation. Often, as an outsider, I find it easy to see other folks' strengths. The more challenging job is convincing them that those strengths are on display for all to see! 🍭 So, I tried feeding the Imposter some Sweets. We all have strengths and weaknesses. However, the weaknesses tend to speak much louder within our heads. In this particular session, I urged this client to make a list of her strengths or her “sweet spots.” These are the things that come easier to her. A great example that came to my mind was Whitney Houston singing The National Anthem at the 1992 Superbowl. While many (and I mean MANY!) have struggled to sing that song, Houston sings it beautifully—and she knows it. I linked to the video of her singing in the comments because it’s…incredible. Instead of obsessing over what’s challenging in our careers, let’s lean into our sweet spots. What are some skills that come easier to you? Let me know in the comments!

Specifically, I want to dip back into meaningful career conversations to initiate at work. The third conversation (after exploring your career path and values) is about your expectations. 📰 What to Talk About: Talk about the future. Specifically, address what your goals may be, how your company can empower you to reach them, and what \"it means\" to achieve success—both from your perspective and the perspective of your organization. 🗣️ Who to Speak to: This is one of those conversations that you should make time to have with your boss or manager. 🌎 What to Explore: This is one of those career conversations you can have at a macro- and micro-level. Macro Expectations at Work •What do we know about the history of my role? What did other employees manage or achieve optimally in this role? •What will a successful first year look like for someone in this role? •What are the three main priorities for this role? Micro Expectations at Work •What is the goal of this specific project? •What impact is my contribution expected to make? •How will I know I was successful in this meeting/on this phone call/in completing this project? ❓Why This Conversation: If you have this conversation when starting a role, you can set your career expectations early. You can cooperatively understand the \"why\" in all efforts by speaking with your boss or manager. Like many of these career conversations, use this talk to open yourself up to future conversations about expectations—especially when adjusting or modifying them. Stay tuned for more important career conversations, or find a link to the full guide to career conversations in the first comment! #careerconversations #professionaldevelopment\n\nWe’ve all heard the phrase, “It takes a village.” Usually, it references the community support needed to raise children. It got me thinking about building a “career village” complete with all the folks who help us through our careers! I have definitely received help, guidance, mentorship, and a listening ear from these villagers throughout my career! 🏛️ Mayor (Mentor): Guides you with wisdom and experience. 🧙🏼 Village Witch (Tough Boss): These “witches” are responsible for “scary” events in your career that ultimately became colossal learning experiences. 💞 Matchmaker (Recruiter): Finds the perfect job opportunities for you. 🥐 Baker (Cheerleader): Provides the sweetest treats through morale boosts and celebrations! 👫 Fellow Villager (Professional Peer): Shares experiences and offers mutual support. 💡 Inventor (Career Innovator): Encourages creative and innovative thinking. Do any of these seem familiar to you? Who am I missing? I’d love to know what “villager” has been most helpful in your career! Click the link in the comments to access the full list of \"career villagers\"\n\nI’m excited to be filming the final lessons in my new program “Revolutionize Your Career: from the inside out”! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️This will enable me to offer the same quality of training we do for corporations directly to individual consumers. Over the last 10 years I’m proud to have worked with 1000s of learners from some of the most recognizable brands around the world. However, I continuously had to turn away individuals who reached out to me directly asking to participate in our AccelerateME program. 🎬Filming the last set of lessons of this special program knowing it would be for those who need and want it most really energized me! I’ll post when the program is live! 🗓️ #careerdevelopment #careergrowth #accelerateme #promotion #careerchange"
