Experts from the areas of fashion, media, literature, music, politics, education, and travel report on their projects in Africa/with African partners or topics, providing insight into everyday life, work practices, and basic personal questions. In dialogue with the audience they will present ideas, theses, and consequences for exerting positive influence on the collective production of images.\n\nCinema & Film Festivals\n\nWhen was the last time you saw an African film?

He works with small farmers in Kenya to develop on-site perspectives, and his educational work is concerned with global trade structures, the living conditions of children and adults, as well as with racism.\n\nTravel\n\nCan tourism be used ‘politically’– to the advantage of a progressive perception of Africa?
