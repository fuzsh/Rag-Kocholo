        "text": "The English language instructors in general and linguists in particular across the kingdom of Saudi Arabia are seriously speculating, debating and engaging their attention with the challenges of how to motivate the ever increasing number of students entering into colleges who are psychologically, socially, and academically unprepared for the demands of college life. Needless to say, one of the important factors in realizing educational objectives in learning English as a second/foreign language is the role of the students' motivation within the educational set up. Motivating students is one of the major challenges language instructors face. The poor performance of students towards educational aims and objectives may be associated to the low motivation of the students. De-motivation in learning a new language is a natural and common phenomenon. The case of unmotivated students open a Pandora's Box of questions: What are the possible strategies that can be applied in the class to improve the students' motivation? In a broader perspectives what are the factors responsible for affecting on the students' motivation in learning English as a foreign language in the colleges and Universities? The opinions of the linguists as well as the second/foreign language pedagogues are different about the role of motivation in academic achievement. However, the common opinions emerged in the past and a majority of them agreed that most successful techniques ELT teachers can use to motivate students include engaging their interest; demonstrating the relevance of what they're learning; displaying enthusiasm for what we're teaching; establishing challenging, and employing a variety of instructional strategies.\n\nLanguage is the unique phenomenon that man uses to communicate various life experiences, information, feelings, moods or ideas. The system of morphemes and phonemes within it make an utterance meaningful. Debates over the strategies to be implemented in the acquisition of a language have reached its zenith during the modern times. Language learning should be a natural process and proficiency in the different skills of the language is significant. Language acquisition device (LAD) and the age of the learner is significant in language learning. Proficiency in a language can vary according to the need of the learner- Second language (L2) or foreign language (FL). Different genres of literature can be used as a means to imbibe language. The role of the teacher in teaching a foreign language like English at different levels is highly demanding. Progressive modern teaching is activity based, skill oriented and demonstrative giving emphasis to uniqueness and creativity of the learner...\n\nEnglish as a Foreign Language (EFL) is an expanding field of research that has been prompted by the adoption of English as the international language of the world. Non-native speakers have their share of needs, perceptions, and preferences for their learning process that is currently under extensive research. Since EFL is applied in different countries, the instructors are advised to retain a measure of flexibility that can accommodate these dissimilarities as well as the changing face of the 21st-century classroom. Furthermore, EFL is a mixture of speaking and writing skills, so it is important to provide for both needs as some who have one preference over the other. Levels of education will exhibit variable needs and difficulties within the parameters of EFL, so educators are encouraged to account for them while preparing their curricula. Students often cite the lack of time and proper teaching strategies as hindrances for advancing in their EFL courses. They demand a more critica...\n\nNowadays, the English language is inarguably a lingua franca. Teaching English to non-native English speakers/students plays a special role in contemporary development of English. A huge body of terminology was invented in order to name and describe modern domains of English teaching: English as a Foreign/Second Language (EFL/ESL), Teaching English as a Foreign/ Second Language (TEFL/TESL), Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), English for Academic Purposes (EAP), Non-native English-speaking Teachers (NNEST), Native English-speaking Teachers (NEST) and so on. This article mostly deals with EFL/ESL environment listing and describing the results of some empirically based studies that are on increase especially in the last decades. The research findings were divided into three groups: those of the primary school, high school and university level of schooling. They revealed the importance of teachers’ speed and clarity while talking in English using genuine English during teaching, the quality of a proper feedback, students’ attitudes towards English, their level of motivation, and so forth. Additionally, several tools for measuring EFL/ESL related topics were listed and briefly described. At the end of this review article, some obstacles have been provided while teaching and learning English as well as several recommendations."
