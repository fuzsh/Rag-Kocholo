        "text": "Stephen Knight\n\nEnvironment\n\nI am a long-term environmentalist living in modest accommodation that is entirely self-sufficient, with no connection to utilities such as electric, natural gas, water, rubbish, and sewer services. Nature is my living room. My off-grid lifestyle reduces my impact on the environment and Earth's natural resources. I have always had a passion for nature and the outdoors, which sparked my interest in environmental issues and conservation. Our planet and humankind face a series of environmental challenges or problems, but one issue dominates the environmental arena: climate change. I am supposed to be hopeful the world can achieve \"massive changes\" to combat climate change and be inspired by Swedish eco-activist Greta Thunberg and environment movements such as Extinction Rebellion (XR). Be thankful, governments, private sector players, and international bodies such as the United Nations (UN) are taking the issue seriously and will take drastic action against climate change. Hang out the bunting and put on the party hats, folks. There is only one problem, my background is in environmental science and scepticism is embodied in the scientific method. I like to 'look behind the curtain' in search of the truth rather than just accept the 'stage presentation.'\n\nWe are told the climate emergency or crisis is about \"saving the planet,\" but it is about other three-word phrases, which are the real green deal. The third and final article in this series focusing on climate change, follows-on from my two previous articles: Flight Shaming is Illogical - The Ethics of Air Travel; and Sun Rising Over Global Warming & Carbon Dioxide Debate. Before I break-down what the so-called climate emergency is about, it is important to reiterate the key points from the previous articles and provide some background to the climate emergency declaration.\n\nSettled Science Nonsense\n\nThe public are not supposed to question the climate emergency because we are told the science is settled and we must act now, but real science is never settled, nor is scientific truth determined by consensus or political ideology. How can the science be settled when the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not adequately considered the role of solar energy in explaining increased temperatures and only consider those data sets and studies that support their chosen narrative (e.g., human-generated CO2 is the primary cause of global warming)? The UN body's conclusions are about forcing a so-called scientific consensus and steering the narrative.\n\nA recent study by a team of two dozen international scientists totally contradicts the conclusions of the IPCC. The peer-reviewed findings show that warmer temperatures in recent decades might be caused mainly by the Sun and not carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Many other scientific papers have refuted the primary claim of climate change activists that CO2 causes global warming. The concept is simple, climate change is almost entirely impacted by the Sun. No one could state this better or more authoritatively than the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). I am looking at a screenshot of a page removed from the NASA website in 2011 (readers may request a copy via email) and here is the first paragraph of text explaining the primary forcings of the Earth system: “The Sun is the primary forcing of Earth’s climate system. Sunlight warms our world. Sunlight drives atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. Sunlight powers the process of photosynthesis that plants need to grow. Sunlight causes convection which carries warmth and water vapor up into the sky where clouds form and bring rain. In short, the Sun drives almost every aspect of our world’s climate system and makes possible life as we know it.\" You can be the judge of why this page was removed. My guess is explaining how the Sun is the ‘driver of climate’ is not something NASA (during the Obama administration) wanted to have in the public domain and blocked it from public view when pushing for global CO2 taxes.\n\nThe public should ignore the sphere of hot plasma 864,000 miles in diameter at the centre of the Solar System and believe a natural gas which makes up just 0.04% of the atmosphere is 'driving the climate' and causing global warming. Believe that we should attempt to reduce human emissions of CO2 and thereby stop global warming and climate change. The problem is anthropogenic global warming (AGW) and the \"CO2=BAD\" narrative pushed by governments and the media is grounded in political ideology, not science. Climate alarmism is entirely dependent on graphs and computer models which rely on cherry-picked or corrupt data. Hans von Storch, one of the world’s leading climate modellers, has shown the models supporting these forecasts are, for 98% of them, false. The \"consensus reality\" is not scientific truth, so we really are living in an age of collective eco-insanity. What you can rely on is NASA when they stated on their official website that \"the Sun drives almost every aspect of our world’s climate system.\" So why do we constantly hear the global temperature is rising due to human-generated CO2 and why is CO2 the great villain of global warming alarmists? What is more, why declare a climate emergency when there is no convincing evidence indicating there is anything like a climate catastrophe or that human-generated CO2 is causing global warming and destroying the planet? 1,200 scientists and professionals reiterated this point recently by signing a World Climate Declaration to say \"There is No Climate Emergency\".\n\nClimate of Fear\n\nFor the past 50 years, we have been told incessantly that it is our “last chance” to “save humanity” before \"climate change will destroy us.\" In 1972, half a century ago, Maurice Strong, first UN Environment Programme director, warned the world “we have ten years to stop the catastrophe\" (image above). In 1982 his successor, Mostafa Tolba, the then head of the UN Environment Programme told the world we had until the turn of the millennium before dealing with “an environmental catastrophe as irreversible as any nuclear holocaust.\" As 1990 rolled around Tolba said we had just five years, “otherwise we’d lose the climate struggle.\" Generally, UN climate change doomsday warnings have predicted a \"decade to save planet\" since the early seventies, including the latest 10-year race to save the planet. The global warming / climate change \"hustle\" has always entailed convincing populations that a massive intervention is necessary to stave off the imminent collapse of all life on Earth.\n\nThe hysterical and purposely provocative language coming from the UN today via the IPCC is designed to cause fear, especially among young people. It is a successful PR strategy. To reinforce the routine UN warnings that we have just a decade to \"save the planet\" we have the weight of scientific opinion. 11,000 scientists from around world signed a petition declaring a global climate emergency in 2019 but eagle-eyed readers spotted Professor Micky Mouse and Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore - of Harry Potter fame - among the names. As Josh K. Elliott states, “what kind of Mickey Mouse operation allows a fictional character to pretend he is a scientist?” These and other names have now been scratched from the doomsday declaration published in the journal Bioscience, but this fiasco demonstrates there is no quality control in climate science, and we should be sceptical of any non-peer-reviewed study signed by random scientists. Despite this study being as meaningful to the climate debate as Walt Disney's animated film \"Fantasia\" its goal is to help instil fear and guilt in citizens. If you are not scared, they cannot sell you a solution. This is why the environmental movement XR used sound bites such as \"this is an emergency\" or \"we now have 11 years in which to act on climate\" in 2019. Likewise, why Greta Thunberg used the slogan \"panic like your house is on fire\" to \"sound the alarm\" on climate change. The language used is revealing and has a purpose. Emergency mode means urgency and nations even adopting a “war-like footing” to tackle the climate emergency as argued by Prince Charles when opening the COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on 1 November 2021. A “vast military-style campaign” to address urgent environmental issues. This urgency becomes global so that governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and corporations will all direct immediate funding towards unlocking trillions of capital needed to \"save the planet\" (which translates as: save/reboot capitalism).\n\nThe big problem is that manufactured fear is wreaking havoc on the health and psychological well-being of children of all ages. I recall watching a young girl break out in tears because she believed we only had 11 years to save the planet at a climate protest in London in 2019. Many adults are not capable of dealing with the constant barrage of fear by government and media (intentional psychological warfare) so imagine what impact this is having on children? Climate alarmists are basically engaging in child abuse. It is no wonder record numbers of antidepressants are being prescribed to young children or that \"four in ten young people around the world are hesitant to have children,\" according to the Guardian. Eco anxiety or climate anxiety is most prevalent in today's young people. The long-term psychological damage from the \"climate of fear\" will be immense. The future is less frightening if you separate fact from fiction. How many young people from around the world are aware that every ‘crisis’ put forth by the UN since the early seventies was invented? 50 years of failed eco-apocalyptic predictions! Fear and propaganda are consistently used to manipulate public opinion and if you swallow the 'fear pill' you will be unable to process what is really going on.\n\nFollow The Money\n\nThe climate emergency is about the \"green\" transformation of the global financial system. When the most influential multinational corporations, the world’s largest institutional investors including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, the UN, the World Bank, the Bank of England, and other central banks line up behind the financing of such arbitrary aims as a \"net zero\" economy, it is time to 'look behind the curtain' to the actual agenda. The picture that emerges is the attempted financial reorganization of the world economy for the benefit of the world’s most powerful private banks and financial institutions, under the guise of promoting sustainability. Just look at who are the co-chairs for a new financial alliance for net zero emissions, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ): Mark Carney and Michael Bloomberg. I mean honestly, Mark Carney is going to help save the planet. GFANZ can cloak itself in lofty rhetoric of “saving the planet,” but its plans ultimately amount to a corporate-led coup that will make the global financial system even more corrupt and predatory.\n\nA shadowy cabal of bankers, investors, traders, etc, are seeking to make colossal profits from the \"green\" bonanza. A whole new era of Wall Street cunning trickery under the guise of \"fighting climate change.\" BlackRock has been fuelling the multi-trillion \"green\" transformation on Wall Street, \"one of the biggest transfers of capital the world has ever seen.\" The climate emergency is clearly about rebooting the global capitalist economic system rather than saving the planet. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - a collection of 17 interlinked objectives adopted by the UN in 2015 - are essentially about creating new markets, rather than the ostensible goal of ending poverty, protecting the planet, and spreading peace and prosperity to all people by 2030. One example is the Biden administration throwing $3.5 Billion at an unnecessary program to capture carbon \"pollution\" from the air when his country is literally falling apart with many cities dealing with a surge in shanty towns. An obscene waste of money for a non-existent problem. CO2 is not a pollutant, but the essential ingredient for photosynthesis on which all life on Earth depends.\n\nA lot of people are getting rich off the global warming / climate change industry, and there are many examples of fraud and abuse. Remember Obama’s $80 billion clean-technology program and the failure of photovoltaic panel-maker Solyndra? The Californian solar energy firm (that had close ties to the Obama administration) pocketed $500+ million in federal loans but did not create one solar panel or green job. A popular song and jazz standard composed by George Gershwin comes to mind: \"Nice Work If You Can Get It.\"\n\nOne of the most famous and successful “warming hustlers” is former United States Vice President Al Gore, enabling him to buy a $9 million house on the coast! This is the guy who in 2006 told us there will be a 20-foot rise in sea level “in the near future” and warned the world in 2009 of an “ice-free” Arctic within the \"next five to seven years.\" It is fair to say his predictions were not as alarmist as then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicting that the world had only 50 days (50 days!) to save the planet from global warming in 2009, but his predictions of impending disaster have fallen somewhat short of the mark. Some people must have doubted making it to the year 2022, given the alarms he was sounding in 2006's An Inconvenient Truth! Polar bears too are doing fine despite the movie's claims that they would die due to a lack of sea ice, and the ice fields on Kilimanjaro are still here despite Gore saying in 2006 that “within the decade there will be no more snows of Kilimanjaro.”\n\nGore stirs up fear about a coming climate apocalypse to serve his own agenda and is undoubtedly a representative for globalists. I am old enough to remember Gore's speech on Iraq and Saddam Hussein's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction. Blatant lies to justify military intervention and regime change in the region. I pointed this out at the time and various other inconsistences in his climate change narrative. The inconvenient truth is Gore's agenda is political and economic. \"One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore... one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy\" - Ottmar Edenhoffer “World Expert,” IPCC panellist and Director of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change.\n\nGore is feeling the climate crisis so hard he can see the dollar signs! Gore was worth less than $2 million in 2001, by 2012, it was estimated he had racked up a nice neat $100 million. He amassed his fortune by investing in green companies (aided by Federal government) and by jetting around the world, giving speeches about mitigating global warming and reducing CO2 emissions! He has an estimated net worth of more than $300 million in 2022. Not bad for someone who never cared much about making money. Do not be deceived, Gore is a son of privilege and is to the manor born. He benefited richly from his father's financial savvy and all his business schemes which included running a gasoline station, a coalmining subsidiary, and owning Occidental Petroleum Corporation shares! Gore trashes the oil industry but has been financed by the business he so abhors.\n\nFinancialization of Nature\n\nThe climate emergency is about the financialization and privatisation of nature, sold as the New Deal For Nature (NDFN). By turning nature into a commodity, it can be used to keep the current economy booming under the guise of protecting the environment and preventing its further degradation. The new unlocked asset classes are significantly larger than the asset classes of the current economy. Predatory Wall Street banks and financial institutions see the natural world as an enormous feeding ground. Their plan is not just to dominate the human economy, but the entire natural world. They want to steal nature and squeeze it for profit. All done with collusion of environmental NGOs and the big green lie that it is \"for nature!\"\n\nThe natural processes on which life depends are being re-framed as assets, which will have owners. Those “owners” will ultimately have the right, in this system, to dictate who gets access to clean water, to clean air, to nature itself and at what cost. People will be charged for things that are not currently monetised, such as going for a walk in the forest. Bankers plan to take ownership of nature under the guise of \"saving\" it and promoting \"sustainability.\" If those with money will own nature, what lies in store for Indigenous and tribal peoples? The NDFN will harm those best placed to protect biodiversity. The NDFN is self evidently a swindle and is clearly about business and not about protecting nature. It rescues the very system destroying nature. 'Business for nature' is probably one of the greatest oxymorons ever. By assigning monetary value to nature, it enables polluting industries to continue business as usual by engaging in net zero activities such as offsetting CO2 emissions. This framework provides a licence to keep polluting.\n\nWhitney Webb has authored two incisive and thoroughly researched articles deconstructing the iterations rolled out in late 2021 by the UN and GFANZ that illustrate the 'Green New Steal' in stark order. Cory Morningstar, a Canadian independent journalist, best describes the financialization and privatisation of nature, by stating: \"The commodification of the commons will represent the greatest, and most cunning, coup d’état in the history of corporate dominance – a fait accompli extraordinaire of unparalleled scale, with unparalleled repercussions for humanity and all life.\"\n\nThe NDFN is undemocratic (e.g., no consultation with the wider public) and one of the biggest threats to our natural world. Thank you, Greta Thunberg, Jane Goodall, and David Attenborough, for doing the marketing/branding for the financialization and privatisation of nature on behalf of the WEF, UN, financial institutions, powerful corporations, and conservation NGOs, including the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).\n\nBusiness as Usual\n\nThe climate emergency enables the same interests responsible for destroying the planet to usher in a new era of exploitation. How would you manufacture consent to continue (accelerate) the destruction of planet Earth under the guise of saving it? A looming climate catastrophe fits the bill, doesn't it? Is this why there has been minimal backlash against Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Michael Bloomberg teaming up to drill for about $1.4 trillion worth of rare natural resources (for electric car batteries) on Greenland's pristine land? If you believe these three billionaires genuinely care about nature and saving the planet, then I have a lovely condominium for you on the dark side of the moon.\n\nOur governments keep telling us they care about the environment but ignore corporations strip-mining the world's seabed’s. Once this massive habitat is gone, it is not coming back. The consequences of underwater mining programmes are unimaginable. If it were really about CO2, you would not allow such operations as approximately one-third of the CO2 generated on land is absorbed by underwater organisms. Ocean microbes are essential to human and planetary health. One of the key arguments for this destruction is to acquire the metals needed for green power (e.g., electric vehicles and batteries). Seabed mining to save the planet! Destroying the environment to save the environment! It is utterly ridiculous. I guarantee the people trying to pass themselves off as the planet’s saviours will not save it. They are predators with a history of exploitation. They conveniently ignore the fact that tens of thousands of children are being forced into slavery working in the Congo's cobalt mines to extract the mineral that is required to create the batteries for powering this technology. They want you to believe the electric car is ethical and green. However, \"the scramble for battery metals threatens to replicate one of the most destructive dynamics in global economic history\" - Cobus van Staden. The people that buy into electric cars think they are 'green,' but, on the contrary, they are indirectly exploiting and destroying the lives of the people in Africa and Latin America. Many areas in these two regions of the world are an environmental disaster because of the mining industry. South America's 'lithium fields' reveal the dark side of our electric future.\n\nIf those pushing the green agenda genuinely cared about people and the planet, they could have made efforts to reduce food miles, provide universal access to clean water and sanitation, or put the idea of 'planned obsolescence' on the scrap heap long ago. Moreover, why aren't many of them right now calling for regional and local community-owned ecological food systems, considering the cost and reliance on nitrogen fertiliser, and the impact of industrial agriculture on the soil, water, and the atmosphere? The reason being is that they are onboard with dismantling the current food supply and replacing it with a new food system, such as the European Union (EU) funded synthetic and digital urban food system (Cities2030), which will track indoor farming and synthetic meat from laboratory to plate and sewers. Another example of replacing natural systems with techno-chains and smart packaging is the IBM Food Trust. The globalist elite are currently using the supply chain crisis to usher in AI-driven agricultural supply chains.\n\nTransformation of Society\n\nThe climate emergency is a political strategy to transform global society. They need to convince us ordinary folk to make untold sacrifices to \"save our planet.\" Do as Michael Bloomberg says and take the bus to help fight climate change. The fact that he owns 3 planes, 2 helicopters, 6 boats, 11 houses, and 42 cars is irrelevant! No, it is you and me who must forfeit our individual freedoms to meet \"climate change targets\" and change our behaviour. We must accept limited energy, carbon taxes, social carbon credits, travel restrictions, less meat, and concepts such as the 15-minute city. Get off our land and hurry along to the nearest human settlement zone (smart city) to save the planet. Eat lab-grown meat, insect burgers, Bayer CRISPR-modified soybeans, and drink cockroach milk to save the planet. Sterilize ourselves and stop having children to save the planet. Stay at home on Sundays and worship \"Gaia\" to save the planet. The Pope and Greta Thunberg called for a Sunday “Green Sabbath” in 2020 but this seed was planted at a subconscious level 13 years ago in the Guardian: \"we can and should restore Sunday to a day for Gaia, a day for the Earth.\"\n\nThe climate agenda is clearly being used to transform the world we live in. A world in 2030 according to WEF Young Global Leader and Danish MP Ida Auken, where you will own nothing and have no privacy. Her article (“Welcome To 2030: I Own Nothing, Have No Privacy And Life Has Never Been Better”) was published in Forbes, and by the World Economic Forum in November 2016. I leave it to your discretion as to whether her and the WEF's vision is wonderful and desirable, or a dystopian hellscape. Does this article give us a unique insight into the dystopian, centrally planned future institutions like the WEF are planning for everyday people (e.g., a world with no privacy, no private property ownership, with compulsory digital IDs, digital currencies, and social credit scores)? I have always interpreted UN SDGs and Agenda 2030 to mean a heavily technocratic future, where the true intention is to monitor, control, and direct all life on the planet. I agree with Alison McDowell’s view that powerful interests are using the SDGs “to mask their plans to remake the world as a digital panopticon.”\n\nIt is understandable why some people will dismiss my translation of SDGs and Agenda 2030, such as the goal to track and monitor our every move or transform the food system, but you just need to read their own writings and watch their propaganda videos, including the WEF's \"8 predictions for the world in 2030\" or a report that slipped largely under the radar, entitled 'Absolute Zero: Delivering the UK’s climate change commitment with incremental changes to today’s technologies.' You do not need a crystal ball to see what globalists and their minions have in store for humanity. Their vision spells the end of modern civilization. The Absolute Zero document says they really do want to end all commercial air traffic (keep the skies clear for their private jets), really do want you to stop eating meat (consume meat-like substitutes that are grown in their labs), and really become perpetual renters on the real estate market (no more home ownership), by 2050. Can you see how the flight shaming movement is part of the transformation process? This is about the ability to live our lives and the range of options that people will have in the future.\n\nThe zero-carbon future they want for us means control of populations, smart cities, hyper-surveillance, no private vehicles, no private property, no farm animals, no flying, and state dependence. They basically want to eliminate all productive human activity by the year 2050. We must understand the reality underneath the flowery philanthropic language of the zero-carbon agenda: austerity and technological enslavement. According to the UN, two thirds of the world population will live in human settlement zones (smart cities) by 2050.\n\nGlobal Land Grab\n\nThe climate emergency is a global land and resources grab. To stop the \"extinction crisis\" and address the \"climate crisis\" we apparently need to hand over 30% of the Earth. Create protected areas and no-go-zones to \"save the planet.\" Another big green lie with zero respect for Indigenous peoples’ rights or their contribution to biodiversity conservation. Once again, I must ask why we are not targeting those who have played a major part in the environment’s destruction (e.g., bankers, corporations, and the military industrial complex)? The biggest land grab in history will dispossess millions in Africa and Asia in the name of \"conservation.\" Watch what happens to the all the land when the local people are pushed off by force, coercion, or bribery.\n\nThe conservation industry is not what it seems and some of the largest NGOs are serving the richest people in the world. NGO's have become a key tool of global dominance, regularly collaborating with oil, gas, and mining interests to remove Indigenous peoples from their lands. The WWF works under the cover of “conserving nature\" but they are rotten to the core and are reliant on corporate money. They have forged alliances with powerful businesses which destroy nature and use the WWF brand to \"greenwash\" their operations. The WWF has been accused of funding, equipping, and working with paramilitary forces accused of beating, torturing, sexually assaulting and murdering scores of people in national parks across Africa and Asia. They have also been accused of paying activists to set fire to the Amazon Forest. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro accused Leonardo DiCaprio of \"giving money to set the Amazon on fire.” Imperialism still has the world in its grip, grabbing land, destroying cultures and communities, trampling over humankind and the rest of nature in the pursuit of endless profit. One cannot separate climate change from imperialism. They are effectively using the climate crisis as justification for stealing millions of acres of land and making large parts of the world off-limits to ordinary people. A Coup d’état of nature – led by the non-profit industrial complex.\n\nFourth Industrial Revolution\n\nWe find ourselves on the doorstep of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), which is very worrying indeed because of the forces driving it forward. The 4IR is backed by some of the world's most ruthless billionaires and corporations. The WEF 'fleshed out' the 4IR on their website and via video in 2016. The UK government within a policy document from 2019 stated the 4IR \"is characterised by a fusion of technologies – such as artificial intelligence, gene editing and advanced robotics – that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological worlds.\" The 4IR essentially aims to merge the natural and digital worlds via technology. Much like COVID, the climate crisis is being used as the justification for implementing the 4IR and the digital transformation of the economy and society. A tech-driven \"New Normal.\" It will impact everything you do, and how you do it.\n\nThe use of technology is an integral component of many proposed mitigation measures, and solutions to tackle the climate crisis (e.g., transitioning to net zero). The global capitalist elite are unlocking trillions of dollars for new investments and infrastructure to fund the 4IR. Greta Thunberg and XR are helping to manufacture consent from the public for the 4IR. A \"crisis\" fast-tracks societal acceptance of \"problem-solving technologies\" to halt climate change. The \"revolution\" is being marketed by Klaus Schwab as an \"empowering, collaborative, and sustainable foundation for social and economic development, built around shared values of the common good, human dignity, and intergenerational stewardship.\" Beneath this promotional language the 4IR represents the biggest ideological mugging in a generation, which will have very real consequences for us, other species, and the planet. There is nothing to be found within the 4IR that will benefit nature and places such as the Amazon will merely become a tremendous source of biological assets and ecosystem services, serving global markets. The public will be told the world’s largest tropical forest needs to embrace the latest technological advances to protect it, but it is a smokescreen to plunder nature and put her on the blockchain.\n\nHigh-tech innovation and the \"blurring of lines\" mean an increasing artificial and synthetic world (e.g., robotics, forest biotechnology, gene editing, gene patenting, etc). Global elites not only want to take complete ownership of the planet and do whatever they want with it but take ownership of all organic life. Whitney Webb states the 4IR is a war \"against life itself\" and it is about \"synthesising synthetic life with organic life.\" It will eliminate \"organic life on a massive scale.\" The 4IR will eliminate and replace organic life. How can anyone who is genuinely concerned about the planet not be alarmed about the formation of genetic, synthetic creations of all sorts. Natural life hangs in the balance.\n\nWho stands to make a large profit from the 4IR? None other than Gail Bradbrook, the digital inclusion strategy specialist at Citizens Online. She and many of those in her business networks stand to 'make a killing' from the 4IR because they are heavily invested in fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) and satellite industries. Is this why Bradbrook did not say anything about all the trees being axed by councils and Network Rail across the UK to make way for 5G? 5G is the fundamental platform for the 4IR (to monitor people and nature) and will bring online the Internet of Things (IoT), an integral part of the \"connected economy.\" 5G and the IoT are enabling the 4IR. The IoT is a digitally connected universe of everyday physical devices (e.g., washers, dryers, heaters, air conditioners, refrigerators, toasters, television sets, etc). Ask yourself why they want to bring hundreds of billions of new devices online considering the possible health dangers, the enormous amount of energy needed, and the damage done to the environment (e.g., up to 10 million trees have been felled in the UK by Network Rail under the guise of ending the nuisance of leaves on the line). The UK has lost a large amount of woodland in recent years, including 14 million trees that were cut down in Scotland to make way for wind farm projects! How ironic, the region that claims to be leading the world in fighting climate change has led the world in destroying the natural environment. The UK is one of the least wooded countries in Europe and one of the most nature depleted countries in the world.\n\n5G and the IoT is essential infrastructure for the technocracy to track, trace, and database everyone in real time and impose complete command and control of the population. All the devices will record (spy on) your interactions with them and observe your energy use. Devices could also register \"symptoms\" and trigger a mandatory doctors visit. But do not worry, you will not have to leave your house, the diagnosis will occur on a screen or via holographic technology, and then the \"medicine\" will arrive at your door. Did you know that during the platinum jubilee celebrations in the UK, the crowds were cheering and waving at a hologram of the queen as she drove through London in a golden carriage? People do not want to float in a passive electronic dead sea or need any of their devices connected to the internet, the need is at the top. Can you see the implications of being surveilled by the IoT, while being dependent on Universal Basic Income (because the 4IR has automated your job), with a cashless payment system, social credit system, and other digital infrastructure in place? There will be consequences if you voice opposition to something you find abhorrent (e.g., energy rationing, carbon emission rights, etc).\n\nIf governments were really looking out for our interests they would not roll out or have rolled out 5G (under the cover of lockdown in many locations around the world) without adequate evaluation of the effect of this powerful technology on human health, other animals, and the environment. The deployment of 5G constitutes a massive experiment on the health of all species. Research has already shown previous cellular technology to be an important threat to human health. 5G is not one step up from 4G, it is vastly more powerful and will saturate us in millimetre microwave radiation. This exposes us to an extensive list of adverse biological effects. All the public need to know is that 5G provides greater speed in the transmissions and they can download a movie in seconds! Little do they know that 5G contains the blueprint of a future only an elitist club of globalists want.\n\nWhen the IoT connects with your body, the result is the Internet of Bodies (IoB). The IoB is an extension of the IoT and basically connects the human body to a network through devices that are ingested, implanted, or connected to the body in some way. Once connected, data can be exchanged, and the body and device can be remotely monitored and controlled. We are already seeing people sporting wearable devices (e.g., smart watches), and later generations of this technology will go inside or be melded together with the human body. The transformation of the human species through bio-digital technologies. Privacy is of paramount concern and being connected the internet opens the possibility of being hacked. Add the movie 'Possessor' to your watchlist if you have not seen it.\n\nMelisa Dykes expresses what many people are thinking about these so-called advances in technology in a 30-minute video entitled: \"WEF: Smart Phones Will Be INSIDE People by 2030.\" Smartphones will be obsolete by 2030 according to Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark, due to the advent of newer technology and 6G. Lundmark believes \"these things will be built directly into our bodies.\" This is not as far-fetched as it may sound. Elon Musk’s company Neuralink has been working on creating brain-computer interfaces, enabling someone, for example, to use a smartphone with their mind. Ray Kurzweil, futurist, and a director of engineering at Google, said \"nanobots will plug our brains into the web by the 2030s\" back in 2015. So, who is ready to have a chip implanted in their head? I assume those who are already turning into cyborgs thanks to things like smartphones (which they cannot drop or operate without), or stampede down streets and through parks in search of a Pokémon will be in the queue. Some people are addicted to technology and are excited by new technological advances and trends. Some of what we see happening now is a precursor for virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and 4IR technologies in the 5G/6G era. VR-based glasses will become a more commonly used interface in 2030. It is easy to foresee some people losing the boundaries between the real and virtual world or preferring the virtual world over family and friends.\n\nKlaus Schwab told attendees at his World Economic Forum in Davos (May 2022) that \"the future is being built by us,\" but it is a nightmarish future where we are ruled by technocratic elites in a scientific dictatorship. Zbigniew Brzezinski called it nearly half a century ago in his book, 'Between Two Ages - America's Role in the Technetronic Era.' The future is a transhumanist hell where humans are merged with robots and turned into commodities for elite profit. That is what we are potentially handing down to our children under the guise of fighting a climate crisis (and virus). Make no mistake, transhumanism is the dominant ideology of the 4IR, and the aim is to merge humans with innovative technologies and change who we are. This official Government of Canada publication from February 2020 reveals the agenda: Biodigital Convergence. They are openly discussing the transhumanist agenda, but many will choose to dismiss this information as a conspiracy theory. The bottom line is that this agenda will ultimately bring about the extinction of humanity as a species.\n\nPeople would never accept the eugenics-inspired transhumanist world of artifice, surveillance, control, and exponential profit if given a choice, hence, the relentless brainwashing propaganda and smokescreens of fighting a climate crisis (and virus). Without “emergency” justification, people were never going to go along with their warped scheme. This is how the global ruling elite are imposing their favoured society on the rest of us. The 4IR will only benefit those already deeply nestled in the global halls of power, an ultra-wealthy clique that want to take total control over every aspect of our world, our lives, and our bodies. The WEF is one of the driving forces of the transhuman agenda, but the epicentre of the worldwide transhumanist movement is Silicon Valley, led by pseudo-scientific thinkers like Ray Kurzeil, and billionaire tech leaders including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.\n\nWellcome Leap’s alarming “1kD” project indicates that key to this agenda is the conditioning and control of children from an early age. Viewing what has been done to children over the course of the past few years, I would say they are being entrained to accept transhumanism (e.g., dehumanization, isolation, transgender propaganda, a high-tech and increasingly digital existence, etc). We are on the road to transhumanism.\n\nThe Dark Side\n\nEnvironmental movements such as XR encourage apocalyptic thinking, including overpopulation fears. The threat of a climate crisis is being exploited by XR and others to instil fear and their warnings have a strange death cult reverberation (e.g., no more children). You may know a couple that have been chastised for having children or a couple that have abandoned plans for a family because of the climate crisis. It is easy to see how people navigate their feelings when they contemplate planetary death.\n\nPutting XR's unrealistic demands to one side (e.g., net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025), their antics are not only irresponsible and often weird (e.g., dancing around a stem of broccoli in a weed-induced or psychedelic frenzy) but have the hallmarks of a cult. Do you remember when Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of XR, called for a mass ingestion of psychedelic substances in 2019? Cults and psychoactive substances, especially psychedelics, are irrevocably tied. These substances are powerful catalysts of social affiliation, enculturation, and belief transmission. They cause profound distortions in a person's perceptions of reality. Interestingly, Bradbrook called for the mass ingestion of psychedelic substances shortly after the release of the movie 'Midsommar' in the UK. Another movie to add to your watchlist if you have not seen it. Be warned, the movie is disturbing, and it traumatized my partner for several days! Psychedelics played a part in the founding of the XR movement, according to Bradbrook.\n\nThe other co-founder of XR is Roger Hallam, who is fond of saying \"I look at the sky and I see death,\" and once referred to the Nazis' industrial-scale murder of Europe's Jews as \"just another fuckery in human history\". In his long essay entitled \"Advice to Young People, as you Face Annihilation,\" which he wrote while in prison, he states: \"a gang of boys will break into your house demanding food. They will see your mother, your sister, your girlfriend, and they will gang rape her on the kitchen table. They will force you to watch, laughing at you. At the end, they will accuse you of enjoying it. They will take a cigarette and burn out your eyes with it. You will not be able to see anything again. This is the reality of climate change.\" I could provide more examples that demonstrate the co-founder of one of the world’s largest environmental movements is clearly deranged, and even dangerous.\n\nI recommend every \"rebel\" look more closely at the characters steering this movement (e.g., Bradbrook's links to global corporations and business networks), and the financing of this movement. Grassroots indeed. The size and speed of the XR campaign combined with blanket media coverage prove its not organic. Has any \"rebel\" ever asked themself why they get so much media coverage when other environmental activists do not get any? Anyway, I digress! Back to the important stuff... the strange death cult reverberation. If XR's deathly propaganda has not got you thinking (e.g., their demands would impose the most disturbing form of austerity imaginable on people across the world), how about the Red Brigade? There is something eerie about their slow-motion street theatre and public ceremonies. They drape themselves in robes resembling blood, paint their faces white, and often have the XR logo and skulls on the palms of their hands. The \"skull and crossbones\" symbol is an old international symbol for death. The stickers that said \"Corona is the cure. Humans are the disease\" (posted on lampposts in the East Midlands, UK) may have been fake, but XR’s misanthropy is real. They delight in terrifying people and encouraging an apocalyptic fascination with overpopulation.\n\nIf you look at the origins of environmentalism (The Club of Rome) and refer to page 75 of their publication 'The First Global Revolution,' it appears that the agenda was invented with the clear intention of being anti-human! “The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.” I do not know how you interpret this paragraph, but it appears that to justify an attack on \"humanity itself\" they needed an imagined threat (e.g., global warming). \"This is now being rolled out as the Great Reset and the net zero carbon ruse\" - F. William Engdahl.\n\nIt is worth noting how many figures, institutions, and publications such as the Club of Rome's 1972 publication, 'The Limits to Growth,' cite population control as a measure to limit CO2 emissions and global climate change. Population control has long been a high priority for the UN, and some say an essential requirement of sustainable development initiatives. The population explosion has always been cited as the underlying cause of the human impact on biodiversity and on climate change. There is an obsession with the Malthusian population thesis, compounded by the likes of Paul Ehrlich, who in 1968 wrote ‘The Population Bomb.’\n\nPopulation control entered the UN agenda as a eugenics issue by virtue of Julian Huxley's involvement with British Population Investigation Commission and the Eugenics Society. In 1954, the Rome conference promoted the concept of fertility as an economic factor. Joan Veon, an accomplished international finance, and government reporter, who attended over 100 UN and UN-related meetings all over the world, including the 1992 “Rio Earth Summit” meeting in Rio de Janeiro and 1994 UN meeting in Cairo, said population control was an organizing principle of the UN. This has been confirmed by other long-time attendees at UN meetings such as Marc Morano, publisher of the award-winning ClimateDepot.com, and the documentary film 'Climate Hustle.'\n\nThe Global Biodiversity Assessment of 1995 was a follow-up to the Rio Conference in 1992 and concluded that: \"A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material standard of living would be 1 billion. At the more frugal European standard of living, 1 to 3 billion would be possible. An 'agricultural world,' in which most human beings are peasants, should be able to support 5 to 7 billion people.\" The optimum world population according to the UN is 1 billion. A number mentioned by other 'experts' such as Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a German atmospheric physicist, climatologist, and long-standing member of the IPCC. “In a very cynical way, it’s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something - namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people” - Hans Joachim Schellnhuber. Jane Goodall at Davos in 2022 stated: \"all these (environmental) things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.” The world population 500 years ago is estimated to be between 420 and 540 million — 6.7 billion fewer people than today. She would like to see the global population reduced to approx. 500 million, for environmental reasons.\n\nInteresting number when you consider the Georgia Guidestones that were in Elbert County, Georgia, USA. Some people believe this mysterious monument on which were carved ten “commandments” for a “New Age of Reason” revealed the globalist agenda. The first inscription on the upright stones was: \"maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\" Other inscriptions mentioned guiding reproduction wisely and not being a cancer on the Earth. Is there a covert group intent on limiting the human population of Earth to less than half a billion people (500 million) or was the monument put there to guide humanity after a calamity? Was the huge granite monument just a sick joke? Either way, the \"American Stonehenge\" with inscriptions meant to conserve nature essentially promoted eugenics and genocide. Amazingly, the Georgia Guidestones were bulldozed after sustaining considerable damage in an apparent bomb attack while writing this section of the article. How freaky is that! Anyone want to take a guess why someone would blow up a monument that advocates depopulation and eugenics?\n\nWhether you believe population control/depopulation is part of the overall global environmental agenda or not, the fact is rapidly declining birth rates do point to a population implosion. Partly driven by the UN's constant press releases about the world's population, including the latest one predicting the global population to hit 8 billion on 15 November 2022. Yet, the world's population is growing at its slowest pace since 1950. One country that talks about the population crisis as much as anyone is Japan, with one paper recently calling for the declaration of a “declining birth-rate state of emergency.” Elon Musk says low birth rate could see Japan \"cease to exist\" if the declining birth-rate trend continues. Japan's population fell by 644,000 in 2021 – the eleventh consecutive year that population has decreased. A declining population and plummeting fertility rate are not a unique Japanese phenomenon. Falling fertility rates mean nearly every country could have shrinking populations by the end of the century. 23 countries, including Italy, Spain, Portugal, South Korea, and Thailand, are expected to see their population more than halve by 2100. Humanity will be a lot smaller and older than it is today. There is no doubt whatsoever that the drop in live births, combined with the sudden rise in extra non-COVID deaths among adults, means a reduction in the global population. We are looking at a depopulation event.\n\nThere has been a wave of \"unexplained\" extra deaths from causes other than COVID-19 in many countries throughout the world. Given the correlation with the \"vaccine\" rollout and the information given on adverse event reporting systems (VAERS, Yellow Card, EudraVigilance) any link between the correlation is not even being asked – even if only to explain and dismiss it. Mass media is brushing off these extra deaths as an \"unexplained surge” and a \"mystery.\" The COVID-19 \"vaccines\" combined the introduction of new mRNA \"vaccines\", plus disastrous COVID-19, agricultural, energy and monetary policies over the last several years, will certainly takes it toll on the global population.\n\nA better and more accurate description of these novel mRNA COVID \"vaccines\" is experimental COVID mRNA gene therapy jabs or shots. Stefan Oelrich, president of Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division, said that the mRNA COVID-19 shots are \"cell and gene therapy\" marketed as \"vaccines\" to be palatable to the public, at a 2021 Global Health Summit. Oelrich stated that they probably would have had a 95% refusal rate if not for a \"pandemic\" and favourable marketing. They certainly should not be called a \"shot of love\", as the National Health Service (NHS) did in a desperate marketing ploy on Valentine’s Day!\n\nFrom the release of The Club of Rome's Limits to Growth report in 1972, to the roll out of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in recent years, to the \"climate emergency\" brought about by Greta Thunberg and XR in 2019, we have been watching the unfolding of an anti-human \"green\" agenda. Many people are starting to wake up to the fundamental truth that the \"green\" agenda is attacking the lives and livelihoods of average working citizens. Decarbonization is strangling food production. Exactly why people are rising in solidarity with Dutch, German, Italian and Polish farmers. They are not taking the controlled demolition of farming and the world economy lying down. We are in the initial stages of a great battle between the free people of the world and the technocrats, who are trying to usher us into their Brave New World. A battle between the freedom to farm, travel and live our lives as we wish, and our self-appointed rulers and their technocratic system of control. What James Corbett calls the \"2030 Agenda for Sustainable Enslavement.\" The UN and WEF are behind the global war on farmers. The Rockefeller Foundation, which released a report on how to “Reset the Table” in 2020 is also a key player. Are you growing your own food and stockpiling supplies? China has stockpiled more than half of the world's maize and other grains for good reason.\n\nThe realization dawns that \"protest\" movements such as XR are harming ordinary people and hurting the environmental cause, which should not be of any surprise because the UN and XR are the same operation. XR demands are in line with aims of the UN Agenda 2030 (e.g., its taxation, restrictions, and smart cities agenda, etc). XR are controlled opposition and a fake environmental protest movement, backed by the state and globalists. The very definition of an Astroturf movement (e.g., astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants). Gail Bradbrook gave the game away in a Sky News interview in 2019, when she stated: “the politicians behind the scenes, including this current government are telling us they need a social movement like ours to give themselves the social permission to do the necessary.” The quote is at 5.23. There you have it. Straight from the horse's mouth. Why do you think many of XR's large donors wish to remain anonymous? Donations have been pouring into XR's bank account, enabling them, for example, to pay their activists up to £400 a week to cause chaos on the streets of the UK. XR are advancing the goals of “Sustainable Development” and UN Agenda 2030, and the net zero agenda. The globalists need XR to implement their policies. The truth is many \"rebels\" have been brainwashed and joined an eco-cult. You just need to sit down and discuss the \"environment\" to realise they are often poorly informed and merely repeat XR narratives like parrots. This was picked-up by Dan Wootton of GB News when he interviewed an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson in April 2022, stating: “these people do not know what they are talking about, do they? It’s like a cult, it’s like you’re all brainwashed.\" Environ-mental movement. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to back up their apocalyptic claims, and as Molly Lipson states in her recent article 'Why I lost faith in Extinction Rebellion,' \"their proposed solutions are not solutions at all\" and \"XR’s fundamental strategy seems to rely on the system itself.\" Bingo! She also states within the article: \"Though it pains me to say it, even our beloved David Attenborough supports the eugenics-based, ecofascist ideology that states the key cause of climate crisis is overpopulation.\"\n\nThere are many elite proponents of eugenics and population control/depopulation (e.g., Stanley Johnson, David Attenborough, Bono, Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, David Rockefeller, George Soros, Ted Turner, etc). Prince Philip and Jeffrey Epstein were once in this club. We have a comparable situation with those involved in vaccines. The developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID shot have previously undisclosed ties to the re-named British Eugenics Society as well as other Eugenics-linked institutions such as the Wellcome Trust. Some of those involved in the COVID shot race also have ties to dystopian, transhumanist technologies such as implantable nanoparticles and bio-brain interfaces (e.g., DARPA, Synchron). Does it fill you with confidence that a research arm of the United States Department of Defence (DARPA), an organization well-known for ruthlessly pursuing dystopian, transhumanist technologies, jump-started technologies and nurtured companies that were at the forefront of the response to the pandemic? DARPA was instrumental in the development of RNA shots. Do you think mRNA shots and future biomedical technologies in the name of a declared \"health crisis\" are part of a plan to modify homo sapiens? Are mRNA COVID shots (cell and gene therapy) part of a larger agenda that encompasses eugenics and transhumanism? Through human engineering scientists can, for example, make people intolerant to meat.\n\nAn Integrated Agenda\n\nWhy am I mentioning COVID (and shots) in an article about the climate emergency? Well, COVID and the climate crisis are two sides of same imperial coin to accelerate the 4IR, the consolidation of markets, finance, and power, etc. It is a coordinated global agenda to totally transform the world - the Great Reset. Both the COVID-19 \"pandemic\" and the climate emergency have been utilized to implement broader agendas openly stated by Klaus Schwab and others. Is the book (COVID-19: The Great Reset) written by Klaus Schwab that describes how a mild virus will be used to reset the world a \"coincidence theory”? These ambitions and plans preceded the COVID-19 \"pandemic\" and climate emergency, but both are being used to sell these huge transformations (e.g., like a marketing scheme) to the public as solutions to a \"crisis\". Create a problem, agitate the public, and offer a solution that would not have been easily introduced without the previous two steps. Would many of the public have taken an experimental \"vaccine\" with no long-term safety data or liability for manufacturers (for a virus with a 99+% survival rate), without the vicious campaign of fear and use of behavioural science strategies? Pandemics should not require the State rule by fear, intimidation, and propaganda. The mass media purposely elevated levels of fear, anxiety, and stress to manufacture consent and compliance (lockdowns, social distancing, mask-wearing, etc). Likewise, climate hysteria is being used to control and coerce the masses; terrorize everyone into accepting the solutions put forward by the UN, WEF, Wall Street, predatory corporations and the billionaire class that will allegedly save us and the planet. It is not surprising why many people are putting their faith in the same shadowy cast of characters who have wreaked havoc on the environment considering the tsunami of climate propaganda. Much of the madness of the previous few years has been about implementing the WEF’s Great Reset program under the guise of ´fighting a virus’ and the 'climate crisis'.\n\nCOVID and climate change are inextricably linked as can be seen through concepts such as One Health, which can be described as \"an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems.\" I hope you can see how this new framework and globalist approach can be used to steer policies (e.g., ban ‘free-range’ farming to reduce risk of animal-borne pandemics). Just watch the development of this recent tweet by Hillary Clinton: \"The climate crisis is a public health crisis.\" It will probably go something like this: \"Many people died due to the heatwave so climate change is a public health crisis like COVID-19... maybe we should have climate lockdowns.\" Use the powers acquired through COVID and apply them to climate change seems to be the message behind that tweet. Progressives will use COVID-19 lockdowns as the precedent for climate lockdowns. Mass media is already suggesting the next global health crisis could be sparked by climate change (e.g., microbes locked in Tibetan glaciers could cause a new wave of pandemics), and have been linking the two together (e.g., climate change may spark the next zoonotic pandemic). There has been concerted effort to rebrand climate change as a public health problem, rather than an environmental problem. Researchers from the University of Cambridge claim that global heating could trigger an extinction-level pandemic as soon as 2070! They need people to feel “an increased level of personal threat” and that's why governments and mass media are going all guns blazing on the dangers of climate change (e.g., alarming statistics, dire warnings about blistering heat and people dying, etc). Totally manufactured of course, like virtually all the wildfires in Greece during the 2021 summer heatwave. Activists want to add climate change as a cause of death on death certificates (but did they die within 60 days of it being hot?), and we have already seen a doctor diagnose an elderly patient as \"suffering from climate change.\" Climate change you see is now a direct threat to you. It is a public heath issue. If the public swallow this nonsense, they had better be prepared for the inevitable outcome.\n\nThe most obvious COVID-climate connection is the self-proclaimed \"climate tsar\" is also the self-proclaimed \"pandemic tsar.\" It is amazes me that some people continue to think Bill Gates, who prior to COVID was an evangelist for Monsanto, actually cares about public health or the environment. How can people ignore the fact that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation partly hosted Event 201 in October 2019, a high-level pandemic exercise which involved a new coronavirus, months before the outbreak of COVID-19, (The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also participated in a Monkeypox wargame exercise in March 2021, that gave a pandemic outbreak date of 15 May, 2022), that GAVIs mission is to specifically secure the \"health of vaccine markets,\" or that during a 2010 TEDTalk presentation called \"Innovating to zero,\" he introduces a mathematical equation to calculate the amount of global emissions and how to lower it. Part of that equation included the size of the global population. \"The world today has 6.8 billion people. That is headed up to about 9 billion,\" Gates said. \"Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%.\" His presentation focused on lowering CO2 emissions down to zero involved the global population! He explains in his book 'How to Avoid a Climate Disaster' what you can do now to fight climate change, while owning a slew of gas-guzzling vehicles, a private jet, a fleet of private helicopters, and living in a 66,000 square foot mansion worth $127 million! A true model of \"environmental friendliness.\" Gates funds the media and an army of fact checkers to protect his image as an amiable, generous philanthropist, but nothing could be further from the truth. Is Gates the biggest private owner of farmland in the United States because he has \"green fingers\" or cares about farming? No, a technocratic takeover of the food production system is underway, and the end game is tucking into Gates & Co lab grown meat and GMO plant-based kibble, and the supply chain being on the blockchain (e.g., phase-out animal agriculture and real food, phase-in fake food). Did he purchase a COVID-19 test company with \"philanthropist\" George Soros to help stop the spread of the virus? This is the guy who funded the secret use of “birth-control” vaccines in Kenya, and unauthorised clinical trials in India which killed tribal girls. Exactly why #ArrestBillGates trended on Indian Twitter. One thing is clear – billionaires such as Bill Gates are the most dangerous virus of all. Follow this billionaire’s breadcrumbs and you will have many valid questions to ask yourself. For example, Gates met with Jeffrey Epstein (a convicted sex offender, fascinated by eugenics), many times, but why?\n\nDistorting The Truth\n\nTo convey the sense of emergency and portray an imminent climate crisis, activists, the media, politicians and even scientists often make exaggerated claims and overplay natural variations in the weather to mislead the public. They are always linking climate change to the latest extreme weather event or wildfire, using the language of fear, terror, and disaster. Evoking fear about climate change is a common tactic (e.g., alarmism). Distorted climate change claims and lurid predictions such as increasing wildfires are a hallmark of the climate emergency, but the data and evidence often tell a different story.\n\nI was in Greece last summer (2021) where 80+ wildfires broke out within the span of 24 hours. Fear-mongering apocalypse porn filled the airwaves for days. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the fires showed \"the reality of climate change.\" The fires showed the reality of the green agenda, badly weakened firefighting services, and government mismanagement. It is no wonder angry Greeks were criticising the government response after wildfire devastation. The truth is virtually all the fires were started deliberately so any link to climate change was political, not factual. A number of arrests were made, and people charged with arson. Like other politicians around the world, Kyriakos Mitsotakis is using climate crisis rhetoric to transform his country at the behest of his masters.\n\nYes, Greece did experience a heatwave last summer, but this has occurred in previous years such as in 2007. I was on holiday in Greece that year and the temperature soared to 47C on one summer day in August! There were also numerous wildfires in 2007. The government and media narrative in Greece during the summer of 2021 could not have been any more simplistic - the heatwave equals climate crisis - but what amazed me is how many people believed it. The fires occurred at the same time there was extreme cold and sub-zero temperatures in Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. Was this a result of the climate crisis? Greece is known for frequent heat waves and for wildfires, but climate change was not on the agenda in the past.\n\nIt is worth noting during Grand Solar Minima that cooler phases are historically prone to drought as jet streams move to new locations with singular heat waves and wildfires due to the ‘Equatorial Vortex’ pulling warm air from equatorial bands to northern latitudes. This could explain why Greece experienced an intense heatwave in the summer of 2021.\n\nI saw a similar thing play-out in Australia. Many people conveniently blamed climate change for the wildfires in 2019-2020, but the drought and accompanying firestorm was due to the deliberate mismanagement of land and water. The country has been deliberately \"dried-out\" through flood plain harvesting, the building of private dams, selling-off water to foreign interests, etc. China is the largest foreign stakeholder of Australian water. The \"greens\" were largely to blame for increased bushfire risk because of the party’s opposition to hazard reduction burns, particularly in national parks (e.g., they stopped controlled burns because they were worried about climate change!). The Australian forestry expert David Packam warned many years ago, that unless dangerous environmentalist ideology was abandoned and the brush was managed, a fire catastrophe was inevitable. The Volunteers Fire-fighters Association of New South Wales said: \"it is high time bureaucrats and politicians stopped blaming climate change for a bushfire crisis that is very much of their own making.\" Likewise, Senior Deputy Captain Murray Drechsler blamed government for Australia’s bush fire crisis and stated: \"the government isn’t working for the people. It’s working for big business and corporations.\"\n\nWhat do the wildfires in Australia and Greece have in common? Government mismanagement, media fear porn, and arson. It is unclear how many fires were deliberately or recklessly lit in Australia (75% according to Heather Wheeler, a UK government minister), but numerous people were charged with arson. A 2008 study found that in Australia about 85% of landscape fires are triggered by human activity, including arson.\n\nThe Australian public were told the fires were fuelled by \"record-breaking temperatures,” but the country has been hotter in the past. The 1895-1896 and 1938-1939 heatwaves were intense, and hundreds of people died on both occasions. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Australia, which was 50.7C, was set on 2 January 1960. So, what caused the 1960 heat? The record temperature was allegedly matched in January 2022 in the remote West Australian town of Onslow (registering 50.7C), but we must be cautious about weather stations based at airports with hot jet engines, heat-radiating tarmac, and concrete. It is easy to weaponize the weather in the political interests of the green and net-zero agenda. What caused the coldest July (2022) in a decade? Alice Springs recorded 15 straight nights below zero – setting a record run of freezing nights for the Northern Territory.\n\nReal Green Deal\n\nThe climate emergency must be recognised for what it really is: a threat to the future of our planet and the health and well-being of people around the world. It is the ultimate Orwellian inversion, cynically waged under the deceptive guise of 'saving the planet.' I have attempted to unravel the true intentions of the 'emergency' declaration and have highlighted the key elements of the climate agenda, which has nothing to do with atmospheric warming or greenhouse gases such as CO2. Mikhail Gorbachev was correct in 1996 when he stated that \"the threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key to unlock the New World Order.” The New World Order has been rebranded and repackaged as The Great Reset (aka 4IR, GND, NDFN, etc). There are other elements (three-word phrases) that have not been included in this article because of time limitations and the desire to publish to avoid outdated content, but these sections might be added later (e.g., the climate shenanigans are also geared towards advancing us down the road to global governance and a global \"green\" religion).\n\nThe global GND and the NDFN is about obtaining the social license required to re-boot / save the failing global capitalist economy, and monetising nature (new/emerging markets). To usher in an unprecedented new era of growth. If it really were about the environment or saving the planet, the policies would be the opposite of what the UN, the GND and the NDFN propose. Climate capitalists must be laughing their heads-off at all those gullible eco-activists who think they are protesting to save the planet when they are protesting to save the very same system that has caused untold death and destruction. The system that we should be erasing from the face of the planet. The GND (UN Agenda 2030 under another name) will rob the public (pensions, spending on public services, etc), and pass on enormous debt to our children. The climate change policies Greta Thunberg, XR and other activists are pushing for are not about \"saving the planet\" or a \"sustainable future\", they are about controlling the human population, controlling the world's resources, centralising power, creating/redistributing wealth, a new way to loot, and saving the banks from otherwise imminent doom. Greta said so herself: \"If we can save the banks, we can save the world.” The phrase “blah blah blah” was given new meaning last year by Greta Thunberg, who used it to denounce hollow words about climate change, but the rallying cry really does have sticking power when it comes to all these promises of just transitions, new deals, green deals, or build back better (BBB) plans. They should all be taken with an exceptionally large pinch of salt. They are hollow empty words of intent that mask the true intentions. We need a phrase to denounce the hollow words rolling from the mouths of Al Gore, Klaus Schwab, Prince Charles and other peddlers of doom and climate propaganda.\n\nThe UN, WEF and their ilk are aiming for absolute control over the human population and the world's resources. Governments are not listening to real science, looking at evidence, or using common-sense because it is not in the script. Those holding certain positions of power know this is not about a climate crisis. The strategically orchestrated campaign is about everything mentioned above (e.g., the Great Reset, UN Agenda 2030, 4IR, GND, NDFN, the preservation of capitalism and global economic growth, etc). An attempted global capitalist coup on a scale never imagined.\n\nThe UK emits barely 1% of global CO2 emissions, so what is the point of committing to net zero emissions when China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world (approx. 29%) – is not really doing anything? Look up how many coal plants the UK has compared to China. China is building hundreds of new ones at home and abroad which will still be running in decades to come. The UK shutting down their remaining plants to 'save the planet' demonstrates the futility and forlorn ambition to reach net zero. The UK government is selling the country out from beneath the feet of its own citizens.\n\nSome academics and analysts believe the globalist \"utopia\" is not about masses of renewable energy (e.g., solar farms, wind turbines, water turbines, hydrogen, etc) to cut CO2 emissions, but rather, it's about getting national governments on the planet to commit to lowering energy production by a significant and destructive percentage in the coming years to \"save us from a horrible fate.\" The theory goes that globalists want a global energy-management network as a solution to climate change, which they will manage. They will mandate far lower energy-use levels throughout planet Earth, region by region, nation by nation, and eventually, citizen by citizen. Control and slavery imposed through energy, and that they argue is this the globalist’s long-term goal and Holy Grail.\n\nFar lower energy-use levels fit with the zero-carbon agenda, and what many of those advancing this agenda strongly desire: the deindustrialization of the most advanced economies, a calculated decades-long strategy as Maurice Strong said, to bring about the collapse of industrialized civilizations. To turn the present world industrial economy backward. Some argue this is an essential part of a Great Reset transformation under the Agenda 2030: UN Global Compact for Sustainability. Are globalists using the climate emergency as a smokescreen for a “deindustrialisation” agenda? Are we currently watching the deindustrialization of Germany in real time? Germany is committing economic suicide at the behest of the 'Davos set' via energy and climate policy and Washington by cutting off natural gas supplies from Russia. Green policies were behind the fall of Sri Lanka. Apparently, the 17 SDGs are the world’s best plan to build a better world for people and our planet by 2030 (sarcasm).\n\nThe implications of dismantling the industrial world are enormous, including economic chaos, mass unemployment, poverty, hunger, starvation, and death. It is obvious it will be much easier for globalists to control societies that are poverty-stricken, abject, shuffling along a bleak path to nowhere. A \"model of scarcity.\" This model (with or without a collapsing energy system) means millions of people will starve or freeze to death. Presumably, those who are always talking about overpopulation and advocate depopulation, would welcome that.\n\nI find it interesting that biologist Richard Dawkins and behavioural scientist Magnus Söderlund both put forward the idea of cannibalism as a solution to the climate crisis. \"Eat human flesh to fight climate change\" or are we being 'conditioned' for extremely tough times and Soylent Green? Another movie for your watchlist if you have not seen it. This 1973 movie about an innocent police officer (Charlton Heston) who stumbles on the truth was set in the year 2022! There are other old movies (e.g., The Road) and forthcoming movies such as 'Bones and All' that is headed to the Venice Film Festival that are about cannibalism. The coverage this topic is getting lately suggests the name of the game is normalisation. Why is the establishment promoting total degeneracy? Why did a Swedish company make a plant-based burger that tasted like human flesh? There is certainly much more going on here than a lot of people can grasp.\n\nTake Responsibility Now\n\nWhat we have learned from COVID is that many people were not capable of dealing with the onslaught of fear, propaganda and gaslighting by government and mass media. In the UK, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and the Behavioural Insights Team deliberately ramped-up fear in the population (a psychological attack). Fortunately, many people have wised-up to authoritarian psychopath and 'Great Reset' architect Klaus Schwab, and 'overhype' experts and pharmaceutical industry 'shills' such as Dr Anthony Fauci. Fauci, the man who used acid to destroy a region of monkeys’ brains to magnify terror, and who is behind other horrific experiments involving animals. It is especially pleasing to see people recognise that WEF/globalist lackeys are running their country and waging war on their own people (e.g., Jacinda Ardern). Klaus Schwab has openly stated the WEF have penetrated governments with its young global leaders, like Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau. That is how the WEF control world policies. We need to tear down these institutions and power structures. These people and their allies 'pulled the wool over people's eyes' during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, so do not trust their science. The UK government imposed a nationwide lockdown and COVID restrictions largely based on the fraudulent use of the PCR test and flawed scientific modelling (e.g., Neil Ferguson's and SAGE's pandemic predictions). Imperial College London (ICL) fantasies were directing UK and US government policy. ICL collaborated with the Absolute Zero document mentioned earlier! I will give you one guess who is funding ICL (yes, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), which thus explains the exaggerated forecasts and false science? In the words of George Carlin: \"It's a big club and you ain't in it.\"\n\nFuture generations are depending on us to build an alternative to their technocratic vision and make their bone-chilling vision for the future unworkable through mass non-compliance. Non-compliance, learning, an ever-expanding collection of resources, and awareness-raising is the Achilles heel of this agenda. Our elected leaders are clearly not up to the task of defending our rights and liberties on their own accord, we must demand it, and refuse to comply with any tyrannical proposals. Humanity is on a slippery slope but the reason we can succeed is that the agenda is anti-human (e.g., UN Agenda 2030, brain chips, CBDC social credit surveillance state, etc). The technocratic system goes against nature itself. It must surely fail. The true agenda should now be apparent to even the most ardent doubters. Green policies are clearly not about saving Mother Nature. You need to get tested for brain worms if you believe the same people responsible for destroying our environment are now honestly serious about saving it. The “sustainability” narrative and the other justifications are a tool to gain control over people, food, and agriculture, etc. If we go along with the climate emergency, we are handing over the planet on a silver platter to people who will destroy it and will destroy us as a species.\n\nSee beneath the veil of the mind control, manipulation and deception that renders us dependent on a system that cares not for our well-being. I think some people's real fear is the enormity of the deception and the depth of the horror it represents (e.g., the climate emergency is a smokescreen for a diabolical ulterior agenda). I appreciate these are challenging times and we will be distracted by the tough times ahead (e.g., cost of living crisis due to rising food and energy prices amid rapid inflation and increasing debt), but this is a battle we cannot afford to lose. The mask is coming off the green agenda and despite the best efforts of Google, Apple, Facebook, YouTube, etc, (all partners of the WEF), people are seeing it for what it really is. We must keep the momentum going. \"Success is like a snowball... You gotta get it moving and the more you roll it in the right direction the greater it gets” - Steve Ferrante.\n\nIf people call you a \"climate denier\" for following actual science and seeking out hard evidence, as opposed to relying on multi-million dollar funded, contrived computer modelling projections, skewed media coverage, or the views of so-called environmental movements such as XR, then so be it. The driving forces behind climate alarmism are self-evident. You can use the five types of evidence defined by climate alarmists: 1. Computer models - reality; 2. Hot weather - global warming; 3. Cold weather - climate change (or global warming); 4. All weather - climate crisis; 5. Historical evidence - anecdotal; or analyse and evaluate the facts to form a clear, rational, and evidence-based judgement. Critical thinking has always been and will always be the enemy of ideologically motivated actors with an agenda to make sweeping changes to culture and society. You should be suspicious of any environmental movement that consists of mostly white, privileged, middle-class posh people, that never mentions war and the military industrial complex, China, or solar activity. No, it is your fault for existing, breeding, and making the climate change with your evil CO2 breath. These people are a menace to good sense, rationality, truth, and progress.\n\nThose who like to lecture us about how we need to modify our behaviour to fight climate change often fail to practice what they preach. They fail to live by the eco-friendly lifestyles they advocate. The eco-activists who recently disrupted Liz Truss’ leadership hustings, demanding that a new Prime Minister implement a Green New Deal, are globetrotters who have logged thousands of air miles visiting Malaga, Marseille, Prague, Slovenia, Tanzania, Canada, Djibouti, South Africa, and Brussels. Isn't that a little hypocritical? There are many Hollywood A-listers, tech billionaires, politicians and celebrities who have been caught being hypocrites when it comes to helping the environment. Living on this Earth is not an environmental crime, and you should not have to pay to offset your carbon emissions or modify your behaviour because you only have a certain amount of carbon emission rights. You may lose a few friends for saying what is on your mind but as John Lennon once stated: \"being honest might not get you a lot of friends, but it will always get you the right ones.\" Life's too short and there is too much at stake to keep walking on eggshells.\n\nStand firm against the dissemination of propaganda by mass media and environmental extremists. The goal is to become an autonomous critical thinker, independent of the corporate machinery. The global corporatocracy goal is to promote a dumbed-down society in which they are free to manipulate facts, increase profits, and maintain the status quo. Do not allow Bill Gates to buy your reality through his funding of media outlets like the BBC and Guardian. As Edward Bernays once stated: \"it is they who pull the wires that control the public mind.\" Be part of the mass movement against this insidious agenda before the noose tightens around our necks and we find ourselves in the clutches of a technocratic system of control. A future of abject poverty and slavery while the elitists continue to live their lives of unimaginable comfort and wealth. They want to install themselves as the undisputed rulers of the world. Political power and decision-making must flow from above, from “those who are wiser.” There will be no left and right, but up and down. Them and us. The jigsaw is falling into place (e.g., humanity being pushed into digital cages), but will we tip the table and scatter the pieces all over the floor? We have reached a \"tipping point\" for humanity and planet Earth. The Earth and the entire solar system are saying awaken and raise your vibration. Mother Nature and all her children need you more than ever.\n\nThe climate emergency narrative must crumble, as must the green lunacy such as advocating for war to save the planet, or taxing farmers for cow burps and farts. What are they going to vilify and go after next? We must try and derail the real green agenda and the transhumanist 4IR.\n\nWe might not be able to stop humanity sleepwalking into an Orwellian nightmare. In that case, we work towards building a parallel society and self-supplying communities of like-minded people. I am sure there are many other people who wish to remain human and be connected to nature, and who value freedom over slavery, and liberty over tyranny. Many people have already left the concrete jungles and headed for greener pastures because they understand exactly what the WEF, the UN, and their cartels are seeking to create. It will not be easy existing ‘outside of the system’ and there will be many challenges along the way, but it might be our only hope of survival and way to protect the things we cherish (e.g., freedom, liberty, happiness, etc). This of course is a worst-case scenario, and we shall see how this plays out. These are undoubtedly defining moments for humanity (and Mother Nature). How many people are not prepared to go gently into the dystopian, post-human, metaversal, globalized, totalitarian night? Will our children continue to share love, joy, and laughter at Christmas, or will they reside in the digital dystopia of a smart city, where they worship “Gaia,\" the Superclass, Robots or AI Gods? It does feel like we are in the initial stages of an extremely long episode of 'Black Mirror,' but I hope for the best in these increasingly turbulent times. Now is the time for a People’s Reset.\n\nInsightful Quotes\n\n\"Depending on which published data and studies you use, you can show that all of the warming is caused by the sun, but the IPCC uses a different data set to come up with the opposite conclusion.\" - Ronan Connolly, Ph.D.\n\n\"The computer models just weren’t reliable.

You dress like the tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube. You even think like the tube. This is mass madness. You maniacs. In God's name, you people are the real thing. We are the illusion.\" - Howard Beale\n\nPublished in August 2022"
