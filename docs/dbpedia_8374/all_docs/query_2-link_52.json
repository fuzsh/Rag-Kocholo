        "text": "Friedrich Kittler (1943-2011) was a literary and media scientist [Medienwissenschaftler]. His research focused on technical media [Technischen Medien] and cultural techniques [Kulturtechniken]. Kittler's theory shies away from the Frankfurt School and hermeneutics of Gadamer and Habermas, the dominant literary scientific frameworks in Germany of the 1970s and 80s. Rather, it draws from Heidegger, Foucault (discourse analysis, archaeology), Lacan (the orders of the real, symbolic and imaginary), and Shannon (information theory), but also from Hegel (Seinsgeschichte), Nietzsche (genealogy), Derrida, Turing (universal machine), McLuhan, Virilio, and Pynchon.\n\nFlorian Cramer wrote about his legacy: \"Kittler never had a chair for media studies, but for literature and later aesthetics. His main concern–and partial success at least in the German-speaking humanities–was to establish technical media (in the sense of information technology) as a fundamental paradigm, if not a fundamental ontology, of cultural history and humanities. In this sense, Kittler's insistence on media was comparable as well as in competition to the insistence on the sign in structuralist semiology, and the earlier insistence on geist (spirit) in Hegelian intellectual history, or the insistence on culture in cultural studies. He proposed a Kulturwissenschaft based on an ontological techno-materialism as a counter-model to cultural studies based on cultural materialism. Not unlike German punks in the early 1980s in their provocations against hippies, he liked to insist on the position that would upset old-style humanities and liberal leftists the most.\"[2]\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nEarly years[edit]\n\nFriedrich Adolf Kittler was born in 1943, in Rochlitz, a small town in the vicinity of Dresden in Saxony in what was soon to become East Germany. His father, a teacher, had lost most of his students to the war and took to lecturing his children instead, with the result that, already at the age of 7, Kittler was able to recite long passages from Goethe’s Faust off by heart. His elder half-brother Wolf was a former wireless operator who drew on his wartime expertise to assemble illegal radios using parts scavenged from abandoned military aircraft.[1][2]\n\nIn 1958, the family fled to West Germany, and settled in Lahr, a small town in the Black Forest near Germany's western border. There he went to a natural sciences and modern languages Gymnasium (1958–63). One of the reasons for the relocation to West Germany was his parents' wish to secure for his children the kind of university education that could not be had in the East.[3]\n\nFreiburg (1963–87)[edit]\n\nIn 1963, Kittler enrolled in German, Romance studies, and philosophy at the Albert-Ludwigs University in Freiburg, where he was to remain, first as a student and then as a teacher, for almost a quarter of a century.[4]\n\nAmong his preferred authors at the time were Heidegger and Nietzsche, although Kittler rarely mentioned or quoted Heidegger before the 1990s. He also turned towards new French poststructuralist theorists: Foucault, Lacan, and Derrida despite the fact that their introduction into Germany was met with rather harsh critique.[5] Still, for Kittler, \"the import of Foucault and Lacan rests on the fact that their writings allow possible ways of returning to Heidegger without naming him.\"[6]\n\nFreiburg's location allowed the young Kittler to undertake fortnightly excursions to nearby Strasbourg in France to attend lectures on Lacan; and it was a factor in securing Lacan's much-anticipated trip to Freiburg in January 1975. A few years later Derrida made an appearance and gave a lecture that was translated and edited by Kittler, but while the two over the years enjoyed a cordial relationship, their intellectual differences were so great that they could only be covered by the catch-all label of poststructuralism. The most sought-after theorist was Foucault, but he declined all Kittler's invitations; they never met.[7]\n\nKittler graduated in 1972, and in 1976 he received his doctorate in philosophy after a thesis on the Swiss 19th-century writer Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. Between 1976 and 1986 he worked as an academic assistant at the university's Deutsches Seminar.\n\nHis Habilitation, Discourse Networks 1800/1900 (1984), became one the first influential large-scale German engagements with so-called French theory (along with Klaus Theweleit's Male Fantasies which drawn from Deleuze and Guattari, and was produced by the same German department).[8] Its German title, Aufschreibesysteme, a term lifted from the memoirs of the schizophrenic Daniel Paul Schreber, designated for Kittler the \"technologies and institutions that allow a given culture to select, store and produce relevant data\" (p 501; p 369).\n\nLecturing in the States, Paris, and Basel (1982–86)[edit]\n\nHe had several stints as a Visiting Assistant Professor or Visiting Professor at universities in the United States, such as the University of California, Berkeley (1982), the University of California, Santa Barbara (Visiting Professor, 1986 and 1987) and Stanford University (1982–83). In 1983–86 he was Membre associé at the Collège international de philosophie, Paris; and in 1986 a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Basel, Switzerland (1986).\n\nFrom 1986 to 1990, he headed the Federal Research Initiative (DFG)'s Literature and Media Analysis project in Kassel.\n\nBochum (1987–93)[edit]\n\nIn 1987, Kittler transferred to the Ruhr University in Bochum which had been at the forefront of the German reception of Foucault.[9] He served there until 1993 as Professor of Modern German Literature.\n\nHe was awarded the \"Siemens Media Arts Prize\" [Siemens-Medienkunstpreis] (1993) by ZKM Karlsruhe for his research in the field of media theory.[3]\n\nBerlin (1993–2011)[edit]\n\nIn 1993, he was appointed to the chair for Media Aesthetics at the prestigious Humboldt University in Berlin. There he held four classes, History of Media and Science (traditional German Oberseminar), UNIX Programming (included handling the command line interface and C programming), and other two on varying subjects.[10] He retired in 2008, but stayed at Humboldt as Endowed Guest Professor in Media Philosophy funded by the German conservative yellow press publisher and billionaire Hubert Burda.\n\nHe was recognized in 1996 as a Distinguished Scholar at Yale University and in 1997 as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Columbia University in New York.\n\nEuropean Graduate School (2005–11)[edit]\n\nBetween 2005 and 2011 Kittler was also a professor at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.[4]\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nAmong Kittler's theses was his tendency to argue, with a mixture of polemicism, apocalypticism, erudition, and humor, that technological conditions were closely bound up with epistemology and ontology itself. This claim and his style of argumention is aptly summed up in his dictum \"Nur was schaltbar ist, ist überhaupt\"—a phrase that could be translated as \"Only that which is switchable, exists\" or more freely, \"Only that which can be switched, can be.\" This phrase plays both on the concept that in principle any representation can be presented according to the on/off binary logic of computing. Kittler goes one step further by suggesting that, conversely, anything that can't be \"switched\" can't really \"be,\" at least under current technical conditions. He invoked this doctrine on his deathbed in 2011. Dying in a hospital in Berlin and sustained only by a medical instruments, his final words were \"Alle Apparate ausschalten\", which translates as \"switch off all apparatuses\".[5]\n\nWork and its importance[edit]\n\nFriedrich Kittler is seminal in the new approach to media theory, studying the \"technological media\" [Technischen Medien], that grew popular starting in the 1980s.\n\nHis Habilitation thesis became his first major work (1985; 1990 in English). Its German title, Aufschreibesysteme, a term lifted from the memoirs of the schizophrenic Daniel Paul Schreber and translated as Discourse Networks, designated for Kittler the \"technologies and institutions that allow a given culture to select, store and produce relevant data\" (p 501; p 369).\n\nKittler's central project is to \"prove to the human sciences [...] their technological-media a priori\" (Hartmut Winkler), or in his own words: \"driving the spirit out of the humanities\" [\"Austreibung des Geistes aus den Geisteswissenschaften\"], a title that he gave a work that he published in 1980.\n\nKittler sees an autonomy in technology and therefore disagrees with Marshall McLuhan's reading of the media as \"extensions of man\": \"Media are not pseudopods for extending the human body. They follow the logic of escalation that leaves us and written history behind it. (Kittler, \"Geschichte der Kommunikationsmedien\", in: Jörg Huber, Alois Martin Müller (eds.), Raum und Verfahren).\n\nIn simple terms Kittler's thesis could be summarized as stating that our knowledge (and what we believe to be true) is critically dependent on the cultural techniques that we use.\n\nConsequently, he sees in writing literature, in writing programmes and in burning structures into silicon chips a complete continuum: \"As we know and simply do not say, no human being writes anymore. [...] Today, human writing runs through inscriptions burnt into silicon by electronic lithography [...]. The last historic act of writing may thus have been in the late seventies when a team of Intel engineers [plotted] the hardware architecture of their first integrated microprocessor.\" (Kittler, \"Es gibt keine Software\", in Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften).\n\nKittler's techno-materialistic view on manifestations of the culture was in the 1980s followed by students and young scholars in the humanities called the Kittler-Klüngel (and later, mockingly, the Kittlerjugend [Kittler Youth]). Kittler's students included media theorists such as Bernhard Siegert, Bernhard Dotzler, Cornelia Vismann, Markus Krajewski, Norbert Bolz, Wolfgang Ernst, and Claus Pias.\n\nHe deposited his collected works to the German Literary Archive in Marbach. The catalog includes unpublished manuscripts, earlier versions of his published works, part of his library, and correspondence between him and fellow authors such as Foucault and Derrida. Selected objects are shown in the permanent exhibition at its Museum of Modern Literature.[6]\n\nKittler scholarship[edit]\n\nKittler's most productive biographer and interpreter is Geoffrey Winthrop-Young, a professor of German in Vancouver, who had Kittler as one of his instructors during his MA studies in Freiburg (1980-85). Since 1999 when he co-translated and penned an introduction to his book Gramophone Film Typewriter, he wrote two book-length introductions to his work (one in German[11], another in English[12]), co-edited two special issues of journals, and wrote papers on his biography and introduction to his work (with Gane)[13], early work as poststructuralist literary theorist[14], reception in North America[15], his own encounters with Kittler[16], and a book chapter about cultural techniques[17].\n\nThere is no journal dedicated to his work, however a book on \"Kittler Studies\" was published in 2015, entitled Kittler Now[18].\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nWorks[edit]\n\nGeoffrey Winthrop-Young, \"On Friedrich Kittler's 'Authorship and Love'\", Theory, Culture & Society 32:3 (May 2015), pp 3-13, HTML.
