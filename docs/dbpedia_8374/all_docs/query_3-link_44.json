The appearance of a major new study on pain language, Chryssoula Lascaratou’s The language of pain, presents an opportunity for a review of the book in the context of an overview of this highly complex inter-disciplinary field. The quantitative, word-based MsGill Pain Questionnaire is summarized as a diagnostic instrument from the point of view of language, and compared to Lascaratou’s corpus-based investigation of the use of pain language in Modern Greek conversations between doctors and patients. The focus of this research is on the lexicogrammatical structuring of pain language, and the representation of pain in terms of cognitive metaphors.",
