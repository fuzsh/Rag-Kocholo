        "text": "In the spirit of transparency, and in our effort to inform and engage legal experts and fair-minded citizens in the travesty of justice being perpetrated against Professor Yunus and his colleagues, we have translated the entire judgment/verdict against him that was handed down on January 1, 2024 into English. Preceding that is a short summary and analysis of the verdict. Some of the tables in the verdict have not transferred perfectly, but each and every word has been translated and should be understandable, despite the formatting issues, which we will try to resolve in order to make this even more clear and accessible.\n\nAnalysis of the case against Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus, Mr. Ashraful Hasan, Mrs. Nurjahan Begum and Mr. M. Shahjahan\n\nSheikh Merina Sultana, judge of the 3rd Labour Court, Dhaka, issued an 84-page judgment on 1 January 2024 in the case against Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus, Mr. Ashraful Hasan, Mrs. Nurjahan Begum and Mr. M. Shahjahan.The complainant in the case was S. M. Arifuzzaman, who was a Labour Inspector under the Department of Inspection of Factories and Establishments, Dhaka (a government office). Mr. Arifuzzaman passed away after filing the case and was substituted by another Labour Inspector, Mr. Toriqul Islam, who also testified as prosecution witness no.1. There were three other prosecution witnesses and all of them were Labour Inspectors employed by the government.\n\nThe counsel for the complaintant were two Senior Advocates, Mr. Korshed Alam Khan and Mr. Syed Hayder Ali, who were engaged specially for this case. These counsel do not appear before the Labour Court ordinarily, rather Mr. Khan regularly represents the Anti-Corruption Commission and Mr. Ali is a prosecutor in the International Crimes Tribunal.\n\nThe case was filed by the complainant under Section 303(e) and 307 of the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006. Section 303(e) provides that if any person wilfully fails or neglects to maintain or send any plan, list, record, register, information, report or other document required to be maintained or send under the Act or any rules, regulations or schemes, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 (six) months, or with fine which may extend to 5,000 (five thousand) Taka, or with both. According to Section 307, if any person contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of this Act or any rules, regulations or schemes, and if no other penalty is provided therein for such contravention or failure, he shall be punished with fine which may extend to 25,000 (twenty-five thousand) Taka, which is equal to US$228.\n\nThe judgment states that the case was filed by the Labour Inspector following his visits to the office Grameen Telecom on multiple occasions. There is no finding or observation in the judgment nor in the witness testimony to the effect that any of the inspection or case was initiated pursuant to any complaint from any employee of Grameen Telecom. None of the employees were called as a witness in the case.\n\nThe judgment notes that in response to the substantive allegations brought by the Labour Inspector, Grameen Telecom issued specific replies and pointed out how the company was in effect providing all applicable employment benefits to the employees as per the Bangladesh Labour Act, even though the company had its own service rules. For example, the judgment notes that according to Grameen Telecom, the company provides 30 days of annual leave, whereas the Bangladesh Labour Act requires only 14 days of annual leave; thus, the company provides more benefits than is required. However, the court did not take that into consideration rather arrived at a finding that the accused parties did not comply with the Labour Act.\n\nThe judgment has reproduced the letters issued by the Labour Inspector’s to Grameen Telecom and Grameen Telecom’s replies to each of the allegations. For instance, in response to the allegation on absence of a Workers’ Profit Participation Fund, the company explained in its response that the company’s position was that since it was a non-for-profit company, its profit was not eligible for distribution, and that the issue was subject-matter of another set of litigations that are pending before the Labour Court. The company assured that it would take necessary steps on the basis of the final decision in those litigations, and that this position had already been communicated to the government.\n\nHowever, the Labour Court did not find any of Grameen Telecom’s response to be worthy of consideration, rather simply endorsed the Labour Inspector’s position that none of the replies was satisfactory. The Court convicted the accused persons of all the accusations that were brought against them and held that all the allegations were proved beyond any doubt. The Court handed out the maximum period of imprisonment and the maximum amounts of fines that could be ordered against the accused persons under Section 303(e). Under Section 307, the Court ordered the maximum amounts of fines that could be ordered against the accused persons under that provision.\n\nWithout prejudice to the contention that WPPF was inapplicable to Grameen Telecom, Grameen Telecom, in fact, settled the WPPF claim of the employees in separate proceedings even before the judgment of the Labour Court. Furthermore, Professor Muhammad Yunus and other non-executive directors, who have been convicted in these proceedings, did not have any involvement in the day-to-day management of the Company. It is very unusual for Labour Court to impose custodial sentence on such non-executive directors, and also given that they did not have any previous conviction.\n\nThe Labour Law Judgment, Translated into English, Appears Below:\n\nForm No. (J) 3\n\nJudgment Header\n\nThird Labour Court\n\nDhaka\n\nPresent: Sheikh Marina Sultana\n\nChairman\n\n(District and Sessions Judge)\n\nThird Labour Court, Dhaka.\n\nJudgment date: 01-01-2024\n\n17 Poush 1430 (Bengali year)\n\nBLA (Penal) Case no.: 228/2021\n\nSection: 303 (E), 307 Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006\n\nPlaintiff (State)\n\nS.M.

Ibrahim —– Representing the Defendants\n\nJudgment\n\nThis is a Complaint Case filed under Sections 303 (E) and 307 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006. The plaintiff’s complaint petition in brief is that, the plaintiff is an inspector according to the power given to him by Section 319 (i) under the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, and thus entitled to exercise the power. The plaintiff found the respondents’ company, Grameen Telecom, in violation of the Sections 303 (E) and 307 under the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 during a firsthand inspection on 09/02/2020 and 16/08/2021. During an inspection of the respondents’ company on 09/02/2020, the plaintiff found violations, in addition to other violations, regarding not making the intern labourers/employees permanent after the end of their internship according to law, providing paid annual holidays, encashing holidays and non-payment of cash against holidays to the labourers/employees of the company, not forming the labour participation fund and welfare fund and non-contribution of 5% of the net profit to the two above-mentioned funds and to the fund formed under the Labour Welfare Foundation Act, 2006 in the specific ratio (of 80:10:10) and thus sent a letter, Memo no. 3982/N.M.W/Dhaka dated 01/03/2021 via registered post to the respondents, demanding the rectification of the obtained violations. The reply later provided to the office of the plaintiff by the respondents on 09/03/2020 was not satisfactory. Another letter, Memo no. 7263/N.M.W/Dhaka, dated 19/08/2021 was sent via registered post following another inspection on 16/08/2021 as directed by the higher authorities. But, according to the contents of the above-mentioned letter, the response filed by the respondents after the rectification of the violation of the Section/Act was considered unsatisfactory by the plaintiff and thus finding the respondents disrespectful of the Labour Act, the inspector filed a case in this court on 09/09/2021 against the respondents for violating Sections 4(7)(8), 117, 234 and Act 107, claiming the respondents have committed punishable offence under the Sections 303(E) and 307 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006.\n\nIn lieu of the said complaint by the plaintiff, a summon was issued and duly served. On surrendering to this court on 02/11/21 and 26/04/22 and requesting for bail, the respondents were granted it by the court. Later, on 06/06/2023, the complaint was lodged, according to the Sections 303 (E) and 307 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, in the presence of the respondents. On reading out and explaining the formed complaint to the respondents, they pleaded innocence and asked for justice.\n\nIn order to prove the accusation, the government side produced 04 witnesses and submitted Exhibits-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9. The verbal witnesses produced by the government were questioned by the respondents’ side. At the end of the testimonies of the government’s witnesses, the respondents were examined under the Penal Code 342. The respondents plead innocence and conveyed not to examine the clarifying witness, and submitted the written note and other documents.\n\nThe assumptions about the Defence Case derived from the kind of questioning of the government’s witnesses, are:\n\nThe plaintiffs are not actively involved in the violations mentioned in the complaint letter, Grameen Telecom appoints labourers according to their own rules of appointment, Grameen Telecom gets the work done from them on the basis of agreement with Grameen phone activity and Nokia phone and the labourer’s term of contract is increased along with the increase in the term of agreement with Grameen phone and Nokia and holidays are approved according to its own terms of employment and labourers are made permanent according to its own terms of appointment in Grameen Telecom and the company’s profits cannot be shared by the not-for-profit company and its members registered under Section 28 of the Grameen Telecom Company Act, 1994. Further, if there is any violation under Sections 4(7) and 4(8), 117, 234, there is a civil remedy for it, then criminal proceedings are not maintainable. The respondents have not violated the provisions of 4(7)(8), 197, 234 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 and Rule 107 of the Bangladesh Labour Rules, 2015 and the statements of the plaintiffs and the statements of the witnesses are not correct.\n\nPoints to be considered\n\nHave the allegations of violation of Rule 117, 234 and Rule 107 according to the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 brought forth by the State against the accused have been proved beyond reasonable doubt?\n\nAre the accused punishable for the violation under the Sections 303 (E) and 307 of the said Act?\n\nDiscussion and decision\n\nPoints 1 and 2 to be considered are related to each other and are taken together to facilitate discussion and decision-making.\n\nS.M. Arifuzzaman, the plaintiff of the case, died after filing the Labour Inspector (General) case; Tariqul Islam, Labour Inspector (General) gave verbal testimony in place of the original plaintiff as PW-1 on behalf of the plaintiff and Md. Hadiuzzaman, Md. Enamul Haque and Md. Mizanur Rahman gave verbal testimony as PW-2, 3 and 4 respectively and the witnesses were empowered by the Inspector General to show the notification 1 dated 24/1/17 in this regard, Copy of the notice sent to the respondent on 01/03/20 with registered letter – Exhibit 2, the respondent replied on 09/3/20 Copy of the said reply – Exhibit 3. Inspection Checklist Exhibit 4 and signatures of the Inspectors 4 (1), 4 (2), 4 (3), 4 (4), 4 (5), on 19/08/20, original copy of the notice to the respondent company Exhibit 5 and signature of plaintiff 5 (1) in the notice and signature of the new inspector Exhibit 5(2), 5(3), 5(4), 5(5), copy of the respondent’s reply dated 29/08/21 Exhibit 6, complaint petition and signature of plaintiff therein respectively Exhibit 7, 7(1), Office Order of the Inspector General dated 06/07/22 Exhibit 8 and Attested Photocopy of Contractual Appointment Exhibit 9, Attested Photocopy Dr. Deepa Dutta, Assistant Inspector General’s Signature Exhibit 9(1) submitted the marked papers!\n\nComplaints against the accused persons S.M. Arifuzzaman, Labour Inspector, Directorate of General Mills, Factories, Companies, Dhaka, on 09/02/2020 and 16/08/2021 of Grameen Telecom, whose chairman Professor Dr. Mohammad Yunus accused no. 1, Managing Director Md. Ashraful Hasan accused no. 2, Director Mrs. Nurjahan Begum accused no. 3, and Director Md. Shahjahan accused no. 4. During the inspection of the directors, the probationary period of the officers/employees of the company has not been made permanent according to the provisions of the law, the officers/employees working in the company have not been given annual leave with wages as per the provisions of the law, leave encashment and cash against leave, labour participation fund and welfare fund have not been formed and 5% of the net profit has not been contributed in the fund formed under the said two funds and the Workers Welfare Foundation Act 2006 (80:10:10). Hence, it was observed that it is a violation of the provisions of the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006, Bangladesh Labour Rules 2015, by which the accused have committed offences punishable under Sections 303 (E) and 307 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006.\n\nThe statements made by the verbal witnesses of the state in their statements and cross-examination are the same which are as follows:\n\nPW-1 mentioned in his statement that the main plaintiff of the case was Labour Inspector (General) S.M. Arifuzzaman. He died on 14/09/21. He was empowered by the Inspector General and sued. In this regard, I have submitted a notification dated 24/01/17. Exhibit 1.\n\nThe plaintiff filed the case that “the inspectors shall exercise the powers under Section 31955) mentioned in section 3 of the second page of the notification”.\n\nThe plaintiff visited the respondent company Grameen Telecom on 09/02/20. A letter was sent to the respondent by registered post on 01/03/20. I submitted a copy of the notice. Exhibit 2. The respondent replied on 09/03/20. I submitted a copy of the response. Exhibit 3.\n\nThe plaintiff again visited Grameen Telecom on 16.08.21. Visit checklist was submitted. Exhibit 4.\n\nOn finding violation of the Labour Act during the inspection on 19/08/21, a notice was issued to the respondent company. I submitted the original copy of the notice along with the postal receipt. Exhibit: 5. The notice has the signature of the plaintiff. Signature: Exhibit 5(1). I know the plaintiff’s signature. It is the signature of the plaintiff. Postal receipt Exhibit 5(2), the respondent replied on 29/08/21. I submitted a copy of the response. Exhibit 6.\n\nI submitted a photocopy of the trade license of the respondent company. 5 pp.\n\nThe plaintiff filed this suit against the respondents after finding violation of the Labour Acts. This is the petition, the signature of the plaintiff. I know the plaintiff’s signature.\n\nExhibit 7.7(1)\n\nNeeds to be considered.\n\nThe Inspector General issued an office order on 06/07/22 and after the death of the plaintiff, I was entrusted with all the activities of this case. I filed an office order. Exhibit 8\n\nThe witnesses here stated during the questioning,\n\n“This case has been filed in the 3rd Labour Court on 09/09/21. Four witnesses have been accepted in the case. They are Labour Inspector (General) Md. Hadiuzzaman, Labour Inspector (General) Md. Tariqul Islam, Labour Inspector (General) Md. Enamul Haque, Labour Inspector (General) Md. Mizanur Rahman and I am also a witness. I am included as witness No. 2. The plaintiff was Labour Inspector (General) S.M. Arifuzzaman. I have come today to testify as a plaintiff. As the original plaintiff, S.M. Arifuzzaman died of a heart attack on 14/09/21, the Inspector General’s Office ordered me with responsibility to conduct all the activities of this case. The plaintiff died soon after the case was filed. I was given the responsibility on 06/07/22. It is true that the proceedings of the case continued from the time the plaintiff died until I was given the charge. The truth is that the case is going on for 10 months. I do not know whether anyone else has been appointed before I was given the charge. It is not true that we were not interested in conducting the case for 13 months after the plaintiff died. I did not apply to the court to become plaintiff on the basis of the office order after the plaintiff died. As a plaintiff, I did not file any petition as a witness today and did not inform the court. Not True. Exhibit – 8. The document was fabricated by myself and the Inspector General. Not true. I am not legally the plaintiff in this case. In all the court orders, no order has been issued to add me as a plaintiff. It is not true that the testimony given as a plaintiff is inadmissible or according to the order of the Honourable court, the statement made standing in the witness box without being a plaintiff is legally inadmissible or the Exhibits submitted by the plaintiff are also not admissible to the court as an Exhibit of the plaintiff. It is true in this petition the plaintiff is an inspector empowered under section 319 (1) of the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006, and it is written on behalf of the state he is entitled to give power in this regard. Section 319 (1) gives the inspector powers only to inspect. True 319 (1) The inspector does not have the power to file a case. True Section 319 (5) gives the power to file a case. The only power given to the Chief Inspector is not true. The Chief Inspector may grant powers. It’s not true, I said it wrong. As per my Exhibit 1 The Inspector-General has the power to file cases in the Labour Court, empower other Sub-Inspectors and Inspectors under him. True The Inspector-General has the power to file case and he may delegate the power. The plaintiff has the capacity to file a case, hence the copy of the notification was not submitted to the court. I first submitted the true notification (Exhibit 1) to the Honourable High Court dated 08/08/23. I filed it in the Quashment. I do not remember the case number. It is true that it has been filed in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 41984/2023. The plaintiff had no jurisdiction to file the suit as the plaintiff did not submit a copy of the notification (Exhibit 1) at the time of filing the suit. It is not true that the filing of the case is not correct at the time of filing the case or because an affidavit was not filed in the High Court or the office order regarding the responsibility of conducting the case was not given to me.\n\nWhile testifying on 24/1/17, I submitted the notification which has been marked as Exhibit 1, in that case the objection of the opponent is not acceptable because the said notification has been uploaded on the website.\n\nEarlier copy of the notification was not submitted before the Court.\n\nIt is true that the Court is outside our administrative system.\n\nAfter the death of the plaintiff, by the order dated 6/7/22 responsibility was given to me, the office order which is identified as the Exhibit 8, in that matter objection of the respondent is not acceptable.\n\nThe first allegation of the plaintiff is violation of Section 4(7)(8) of the Labour Act is not to make the workers /employees of the establishment permanent in accordance with the provisions of the law at the end of probationary period.\n\nThe second allegation is violation of Section 117 and Rule 107 that the workers /employees are not given annual leave with wages, leave encashment and cash against leave as per the provisions of the law.\n\nThe third allegation is violation of Section 234 that the Workers’ Participation Fund and Welfare Fund has not been formed and 5% of the net profit is not deposited in the said Leave Fund and the Workers Welfare Foundation as per Act 2006 at the specified rate (80:10:10)!\n\nIt is true that, in the petition, the defendants do not have any design, list, registered documents; reports or other petition documents are not preserved purposefully or failed to submit or misrepresented as per the Labour Act or rules; such allegation is not mentioned.\n\nBut I sought justice according to 303(3). It is not true that I wanted justice for allegations which were not made. The plaintiff did not sue on his own capacity, it was done on behalf of the Department of Factories.\n\nThe defendants in the case are No. 1 Professor Dr. Mohammad Yunus (Chairman), No. 2 Managing Director Mr. Mohammad Ashraful Hasan, No. 3 Director Mrs. Nurjahan Begum, No. 4 Director Md. Shahjahan, respectably all of them Chairman, Managing Directors and Directors of Grameen Telecom. Grameen Telecom is an organization. My complaint against the company/organization is true. It is true that Grameen Telecom has not been accused separately.\n\nI have accused the ones who run the company/organization. I have done the Masters. I have an understanding of the Labour Acts and Labour Regulations.\n\nI know about the organization and the company. I have a clear idea about the structure of Grameen Telecom. It is true that that any company/organization may have its own set of regulations, subject to the approval of the Inspector General.\n\nIt is true that the defendant has to apply for sanction. It is true that the petition must be submitted with the necessary documents including Memorandum of Articles and Associations. It is true that the respondent has sent its own recruitment rules regarding the appointment of Grameen Telecom employees to the office of the Inspector General on 28/02/18 for approval which we came to know through the reply of the respondent dated 9/03/20. I cannot say whether the Inspector General has taken action according to the Labour Act in response to the petition of the respondent. That is not my department. I have come today to testify, with the permission of the Inspector General. I have been asked to testify about the allegations. Exhibit 3 said nothing separately. I, being the plaintiff due to the death of the plaintiff, being empowered to testify, submitted Exhibit 3 at the time of testimony. In the action taken by the respondent on 01/03/20, no 1 thereof, in the action taken on 28/02/18 I did not submit the letter given by the respondent to the Inspector General, the copy of which was said to be “copy of the letter attached”. In column 3 of Grameen Telecom’s reply to 09/03/20, it was written that according to the rules of the organization, the Telecom employees were given appointment letter (sample attached) and identity card with photo (sample attached). It is true that the said attached sample is not submitted to the Court. Section 4 of the True response has already been written in the service book of the employees as per the rules (sample attached). It is true that the sample is not submitted. In point 5, the daily attendance of the employees is collected through the attendance software of the automated system (sample attached) and using the attendance book. It is written that overtime sheets are used for drivers and messengers (sample attached). The sample was not submitted to the court, true. True that in section 6 of the reply, after completing the probationary period, the employees are entitled to earned leave and enjoy self-paid leave if necessary. The rest of the leave is encashed every three years according to the rules of the organization. It is written that leave encashment information is stored (sample attached). I did not submit samples, true. It is true that I went to Grameen Telecom as an inspector. I went a total of 2 times. The inspection checklist has to be filled up during the inspection, true. First visit on 09/02/20, true. The checklist was made on that date. Due to the death of the plaintiff, there is no checklist for that date. Therefore, I could not submit it. The checklist was signed by myself and my colleague Sapna Rani. The true checklist is a prescribed form from the Ministry of Labour and Employment. We fill the form as labour inspectors to inspect Factories and Establishments. It is written on the second page of Exhibit 4, that the manpower is 61 men, 06 women, total 67, true. It is written permanently at the top in this column, true. That is where I filled up. If the defendant wants a copy of the checklist, I will give him a copy, where our signature is. Exhibit 4. In the case of A.S.M. Arifuzzaman, the signature of the plaintiff, Md. Hadiuzzaman, Mizanur Rahman, Md. Tariqul Islam (myself) and Md. Enamul Haque.\n\nThe checklist was written on 16/08/21. The seal of the original plaintiff SM Arifuzzaman is given. Signed by Md. Nazmul Islam, Managing Director, Grameen Telecom, Grameen Bank Complex, Mirpur-2, Dhaka and Shahidul Ferdous, Nazia Afrin (GDL) on behalf of Grameen Telecom. That Grameen Telecom’s round seal is given in the checklist given to the respondent in the last paragraph, is not true. S.M. Arifuzzaman signed the checklist given to the respondent, true. It is true that there is no signature of anyone except S.M. Arifuzzaman. It is not true that fraud has been committed to trap the Nobel Laureate Dr. Mohammad Yunus and others. Exhibit: 4 A copy with the signature of only S.M. Arifuzzaman has been provided to the defendants because the respondent took it quickly before the work was completed. It is true that that the checklist has the signature of Arifuzzaman. Later, Arifuzzaman put the seal, true. It is not true that we have forged the checklist to trap Dr. Md. Yunus or we will be punished for it.\n\nThe company is registered according to the trade license on the petition of the person in the name of the organization. It is true that Section 312 deals with offences committed by companies in Labour Acts. True that if the company commits an offence, its directors, partners and other representatives, who are actively involved in the management of the company, are deemed to have committed the crime. Section 336 of the Act provides for penalty in case of failure of the Board of Trustees with respect to contribution and welfare funds. This suit has been filed for the crime of the person. The culprits are No. 1 Chairman of Grameen Telecom Dr. Mohammad Yunus, No. 2 Mr. Md. Ashraful Hasan, No. 3 Mrs. Nurjahan Begum, No. 4, Dr. Md. Shahjahan. There seem to be 12 or 13 directors of the organization as per the article of memorandum. Out of the four, the rest were not charged. Out of 12/13 people, Chairman Dr. Muhammad Yunus, Managing Director and 2 Directors have been chosen as accused. 2 directors have been accused and not the other directors. Because their names came up during the checklist. We filled out the checklist form. Grameen Telecom did not. True that Md. Ashraful Hasan, Managing Director is written on the first page of the checklist under number 2. True that the 5th page of the Checklist has the signature of Mr. Nazmul Islam as Managing Director. According to the trade license of the company, the name of Nazmul Islam has been changed to Md. Ashraful Hasan as Managing Director. Hence, Ashraful Hasan has been made an accused as the managing director.\n\nAmendment in Trade License is written on 24/12/20. It is true that I have mentioned change in name of the managing director instead of change in name of the taxpayer. Nazmul Islam signed as managing director and accused Ashraful Islam as managing director. According to the information of the organization authorities, the name of Md. Ashraful Hasan has been written as the Managing Director. The organization has acknowledged this by signing the respondent checklist. Those whose signatures are on the checklist, give us the names on behalf of the organization. Nazmul Hasan gave us the information of the checklist. I do not know why he himself signed as managing director. It is not true that I have accused Mr. Ashraful Hasan as the Managing Director since he is close to Dr. Yunus.\n\nI do not know whether Mrs. Nurjahan Begum is 70 years old. I did not see her before she was accused. I do not know whether the elderly Md. Shahjahan is paralyzed. I did not see him before filing the case. The organization authorities named the two people while making the checklist. We did not write any letter to know who the director is and who is the chairman. Mr. Nazmul Islam did not give us any letter telling us who the chairman is. Md. Nazmul Islam, Shahidul Nazia Ferdous, Nazia Afrin have named the chairman and directors. True that I have the names of the directors as per the Article of Memorandum. Despite the name in the Articles of Memorandum, the name of someone cannot be included as a responsible person based on the words of others, it is not true. Because the paper they gave us could be corrected, we took the names from them. The managing director has not given any letter that the names of the board of directors have been changed or may be changed. I have made accused in the checklist, signed as managing director and claimed that I recognize Ashraful Hasan as the managing director. Because Nazmul Islam has signed page 5 of the checklist and admitted that all the information in the checklist is correct. True that the signature of the owners and inspectors is required after preparation of checklist, It is not true that the signature of the owner and inspector is mandatory. Signature of the owner is mandatory. Then, it is mandatory for both parties to sign the checklist. It is not true that Nazmul Islam signed the checklist on the basis of being the managing director. On page 5 of the checklist, the managing director is not supposed to sign in place of myself and signature of the informant on behalf of the management. Although I know that Ashraful Hasan is the Chairman of Grameen Telecom, it is not true that I have purposefully shown Mr. Ashraful Hasan as the Managing Director with the intention of showing him involved with Grameen Telecom.\n\nIt is not true that Mrs. Nurjahan Begum and Mr. M. Shahjahan Managing Directors of Grameen Bank organization, were the only Nobel Laureate of Bangladesh and they served as consultants on the rank of directors of Grameen Telecom in their spare time but according to the Labour Act they are not associated with this organization or I have purposefully included them as directors in this case. Because according to the information received from the authorities of the organization, I have included them. It is true Dr. Muhammad Yunus is the Chairman of Grameen Telecom. It is true that the chairman is responsible to preside over board meetings. I have not submitted any paper in regards to Dr. Mohd Yunus being actively involved in any work of Grameen Telecom. It is not true that Dr. Mohammad Yunus is the honorary chairman of Grameen Telecom or he is responsible for guiding only Grameen Telecom or Grameen Telecom is a non-profit organization which is covered under Section 28 of the Companies Act. It is not true that the Memorandum of Articles of the Company is to be submitted to the Department of Mills and Factories for its identity. True that mills factories and inspection organizations being government organizations, all companies have to submit their memorandum of articles. However, not all organizations have to submit. It is not true that I filed this case at the instigation of those who do not like Dr. Mohammad Yunus. Ashraful Hasan, Mrs. Nurjahan Begum, Mr. M Shahjahan are very close to Dr. Muhammad Yunus, so I have made them accused in this case or none of the 14 accused are involved in any work of Grameen Telecom or I have written their names in the checklist excluding the real active directors for the purpose of conspiracy against them or if Grameen Telecom was really guilty, then I would definitely have filed a case or checklist against Grameen Telecom and its Managing Director, Mr. Mohammad Nazmul Islam. As it is clearly evident from the checklist that Dr. Muhammad Yunus, and 3 others are our targets. According to the checklist, Grameen Telecom has not committed any crime, so I and we witnesses have submitted the checklist fraudulently to the court with the intention of humiliating them by tampering with the checklist\n\nIt is true that the address of Grameen Telecom written in the checklist was not the same at the time of inspection, but the address of Grameen Telecom was not changed in the document of the organization. We visited Telecom Bhavan, 53, Baksnagar, Zoo Road, Mirpur, Dhaka 1216. The plaintiff filed a suit on 09/09/21. The address of the defendant in the case mentioned is Grameen Bank Bhavan, Plot No. 6, Barabagh, Mirpur, District Dhaka 1216. I have not written the address of 53 Baksnagar, Zoo Road in this case. I do not remember how many floors the Grameen Telecom building has.\n\nEstimated it could be 12/13 floors. I did not see any factory of Grameen Telecom there. There are offices of various organizations of the Grameen Group. We did not go to the factory, went to the organization. It is not true that there was no irregularity in the organization or this case was filed only to defame Dr. Muhammad Yunus.\n\nIt is true that during the first inspection on 09/02/20, I went to the address given in the complaint petition. We have never visited any of the Telecom factories for inspection. Went to Grameen Telecom. Some documents are missing since the plaintiff is dead. Official documents are kept in the office. It is not true, that no violation of the Labour Act was found in the first inspection, so did not prepare any checklist on 09/02/20 or submit the checklist to the court for that. After one year 6 months and 8 days of the first inspection, the second inspection was done. If there were irregularities in the first inspection on 09/02/20, then the inspection would not have been done after one year, 6 months and 8 days, would have visited within a short period of time, not true because we have to inspect many organizations. It is not true that Dr. Muhammad Yunus was our target, so we went to inspect again on 16/08/21 in a planned way.\n\nOur office does not have a separate document security system. I prepared a checklist on 09/02/20, therefore there is no office order. Non-availability of the checklist was not communicated to the development officer through office notice. Checklist is a public document. No GD entry has been made regarding loss of checklist. I received the responsibility after the plaintiff died. The checklist dated 09/02/20 was not considered necessary for the case since it was the second inspection checklist. It is true that I found the checklist dated 16/08/21 to be an important document for filing the case. It is not true that the checklist was tampered or so it is important. I do not know the name of other director apart from the 3 accused directors in the case. I did not even know at the time of filing the case. On 09/02/20 while preparing the 1st checklist, at the time of 2nd inspection, while preparing the 2nd checklist, I saw the names of other directors in Article of Memorandum. Dr. Mohammad Yunus is the Chairman of Grameen Telecom and no work of Grameen Telecom is done without his permission. This is the Article of Memorandum, the decision of various board meetings. I do not have any such paper that he has ordered to do so and I have not submitted any such paper in the court at the time of filing the case. I did not mark the Exhibit by submitting any paper to the court. It is not true that Dr. Mohammad Yunus was not directly involved in the violation of the Labour Act, but I implicated him, or he did not violate the Labour Act, so I did not submit the relevant documents. It is true that none of the accused in the case has submitted papers regarding violation of Labour Acts.\n\nIt is not true, that despite his non-involvement, I have filed a case against him under the pressure of higher authorities. It is true that no one can be prosecuted without evidence but the accused have been sued on the basis of the information found in the checklist during the inspection. Evidence of violation is also found in the defendants’ reply.\n\nAfter the first inspection, a notice was issued to the defendants on 01/03/20. In the notice, the owner/managing director/manager of Grameen Telecom, Plot 6, Barabagh, Mirpur, Dhaka is written. It is true, that apart from 4 accused, there are a few more names in the notice. It is true that except for 4 defendants, i.e. Mr. Parvin Muhammad Naznina Sultana, General Manager Nazmul Islam, no one has been accused. It is not true that I said that I do not know the name of any director outside the checklist and petition that is false. It is not true that the persons mentioned in the notice are related to Grameen Telecom or as our target, 4 persons have been targeted and requested for checklist.\n\nThere were 9 charges against the defendants in the notice dated 01/03/20. I did not file a case on 9 charges. It is true that I have filed a case on 3 charges. It is not true, that there were no other charges beyond the 3 charges. The subsequent replies made by the defendants included some samples indicating that the defendants had amended some of the charges and some were under process. It is not true that I have filed a case through an incomplete investigation.\n\nIt is not true that the statement dated 05/09/23 that we have accused those by whom the company/organization is run. It is true that Grameen Telecom is not run by the four accused or is run by the Grameen Telecom Board of Directors.\n\nHowever, the 4 accused are part of the Board of Directors. It is not true that despite having 12/13 board of directors in Grameen Telecom, we purposefully did not make them accused, but under pressure from higher authorities, we accused those close to Dr. Muhammad Yunus.\n\nIt is not true that in spite of section 3 of the Labour Act, the appointment of every worker and other matters related to it will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Act, but instead of making Grameen Telecom the accused, 4 people have been accused.\n\nIt is not true that I have purposefully accused 4 people excluding the Board of Directors. It is not true that under sections 3, 234, 312 of the Labour Act, no person can be accused except the organization, yet 4 people were accused purposefully.\n\nIt is not true that the case has been filed a case against a person as the organization did not violet the law or I would have filed a case against the organization if it had really violated the law. It is not true that the defendants had no personal liability. Because they are the directors of the organization.\n\nIt is not true that the 4 defendants including Dr. Yunus were not responsible for the permanent employment of the workers, annual leave with wages, guaranteeing the profit of the workers, or the responsibility of the Grameen Telecom organization or knowing that, I have filed a case against the 4 people on purpose. The statement is correct that the name of the managing director Nazmul Islam was changed to Ashraful Islam on 24/12/20 after amending the trade license. It is true about change in name of the taxpayer on trade license on 24/12/20. True that it is mentioned about Ashraful Hasan instead of the former taxpayer Nazmul Islam. It is not true that in the order dated 24/12/20 of Dhaka North City Corporation, the defendant appointed Ashraful Hasan as the managing director despite knowing that the next taxpayer Ashraful Hasan has been appointed instead of the previous taxpayer Nazmul Islam.\n\nAccording to the information provided by the organization, Ashraful Hasan has been made an accused and the authorities of the organization signed the checklist and in response to the respondent along with us on 25/02/21, Mr. Md. Ashraful Hasan was written as the Managing Director at number 7 in the part of the members present at the 102nd meeting of the Board of Directors. A copy of the reply was not submitted to the court. It is not known how many labour inspectors are there in Dhaka district. On 16/08/21, we 5 labour inspectors went to Grameen Telecom. They were S.M. Arifuzzaman, I myself Tariqul Islam, Md. Hadiuzzaman, Md. Enamul Haque, Mizanur Rahman. We are all Labour Inspectors (General) and of equal rank. We went for the inspection on the instructions of the Deputy Inspector General. We were appointed by the Deputy Inspector General. The jurisdiction of Mirpur region was determined by the Deputy Inspector General of myself and others of S.M. Arifuzzaman.\n\nThere is no mention of the checklist in the case petition true, but it is in the list. The list is submitted in court. It is true that the chairman/managing director/director is mentioned in the notice dated 19/08/21. It is true that only 4 defendants were not given notice in this notice.\n\nIt is true that the plaintiff found violation of the following rules of Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 and Labour Rules 2015 during the inspection of the company on 09/02/20 and 16/08/21. It is true that the plaintiff and others with him are not mentioned here. According to the description of Exhibit 2 petition, the notice of on-site inspection of the plaintiff on 09/02/20 is true. It is true that this notice does not have the signature of the plaintiff. It is true that this notice is signed by myself and Swagri Rani Addya. On 09/02/20, I went to inspect by the Deputy Inspector General’s order. After this inspection, a notice was issued to the Managing Director/Director of Grameen Telecom on 01/03/20.\n\nIt is true that this notice described the inspection of 09/02/20. No copy of the notice has been given to the Deputy Inspector General for reference. It is not true that the description of the notice dated 01/03/20 does not match with the inspection mentioned by the plaintiff on 09/02/20. It is true that the notice is not signed by the plaintiff and the copy of the letter signed by the plaintiff has not been sent to the Deputy Inspector General. It is not true that the original notice claimed in the petition of the plaintiff was not filed in the court as Exhibit 2. It is not true that if the original notice was filed, there would have been no material to charge against the accused, and so I concealed the original letter and presented the forged letter as Exhibit 2. Because the respondent has given a reply with the signature of the managing director as per the said notice. We submit the inspection report to the Deputy Inspector General. It is true that the Deputy Inspector General ordered to issue notice after seeing the report. He ordered the plaintiff. Exhibit 2 notice was not submitted by the person directed by the Deputy Inspector General. At the time of giving the notice, I had jurisdiction in the concerned area and the plaintiff was not responsible for that area. The copy was not sent to the Deputy Inspector General since it was not signed by the plaintiff. It is not true that myself and Swapna Rani Adya have hurriedly issued the said notice on own initiative. It is not true that the plaintiff single-handedly inspected the respondent organization on 16/08/21. Someone from the inspection team is the plaintiff. It is true that it is not written in the petition that inspection was done by the inspection team on16/08/21. The plaintiff inspected the defendant’s organization on 16/08/21 with the permission of the Deputy Inspector General. It is true that he issued a notice on 19/08/21 with the permission of the Deputy Inspector General. It is true that the plaintiff has signed according to the rules on the right side of the notice and below it is dated in Bengali and English. It is true that Bangla 4 Bhadra. 11428 and below 19 August 2021 is written. It is true that Letter No. is written in the notice. It is true that a copy is also given to the Deputy Inspector General. It is not true that Exhibit 2 Letter No. is not given. It is true that after the signature of the plaintiff in the notice, the signature of Md. Hadiuzzaman, Md. Enamul Haque, Md. Tariqul Islam, Mizanur Rahman and date is given. It is not true that in this letter after the name of the plaintiff, the signatures of 4 others have been tampered with. It is not true that I am involved in the tampering. It is not true that I tampered, created and submitted to stand as a witness against 4 people including Dr. Muhammad Yunus, to implicate him in a false case or submitted it as Exhibit 5. True Exhibit 6 Reply of the respondent to the notice dated 19/08/21. Reply given by Mr. Nazmul Islam, Managing Director, Grameen Telecom. It is true that there were 8 violations in the notice dated 19/08/21.\n\nViolation No. 1 was Section 3, Rule 3, The complaint was that there are service rules (service rules) regarding the employment of workers which are not approved by the Inspector General. The reply of the true opponent was that Grameen Telecom has its own policy for proper management of operations which has been sent to the inspector general’s office on 28/02/2018 for approval (copy attached) but so far we have not been informed by the said office.\n\nIn view of your receipt of this question, Grameen Telecom’s recruitment policy and related policies have been sent to your office again on 25/08/21 (copy attached). It is true that I have not filed the copy of the copy attached in the reply with Ex-6,\n\nViolation No. 2 was the fact that workers/employees of the establishment were not made permanent as per the law at the end of the apprenticeship period of Section 4(7)(8). It is true, in the action taken the defendant replied that Grameen Telecom was a not-for-profit company created under Section 28 of the Companies Act. As per the prevailing recruitment rules of the organization, the workers are made permanent at the end of the apprenticeship period. All the workers and employees of the organization are appointed on contractual basis.\n\nViolation of Section no. 3 (Substituted for Section 5) 35, Rule 19, it is true that the employment letter of the worker/employee of the violating organization is not provided as per 19(4) of Bangladesh Labour Rules, 2015 and the identity card is not provided as per Form No. 6 of Bangladesh Labour Rules, 2015. Exhibit 6. True that in the system adopted, it is written that every worker and employee of Grameen Telecom has been given ID card and the register is being maintained in Form 6 (a). As per 19(4) of Bangladesh Labour Act 2015 sample of appointment letter is given for your approval (copy attached). Form no. 6 (a) is maintained in the Register (copy enclosed). It is true that the attached copy was not given with Exhibit 6.\n\nViolation No. 4 Section 6. Rule 2021, No. 7 of Bangladesh Labour Act 2015 has not maintained the service book of officers/employees. In the system adopted, the workers are maintained in the employee service book. It is true that it is written in the attached sample. I have not submitted the true copy.\n\nViolation No. 5 Section 95(1), Rule 23- As per No. 8 of Bangladesh Labour Act 2015, it is true that the worker/employee register is not maintained. In the duly adopted action, it is written that the register is maintained (copy attached) is being preserved as per Form no. 8. True attached copy is not submitted.\n\nViolation No. 6, Section 46, 47, 48 Rule 38, 39, No information/register has been maintained regarding maternity welfare facilities for women workers, employees working in the organization. It is true that in the system adopted, it is written that the register regarding maternity welfare facilities for women employees working in the organization is being maintained.\n\nViolation No. 7, Section 117, Rule 107 – Provision of annual leave with wages, encashment of leave and non-cash payment against leave to the workers/employees working in the organization and as per the system adopted, this leave is earned for the first time after 6 years of receipt of contract employment. 1 month’s basic salary can be taken in lieu of leave. 1 month’s basic salary shall be paid against accrued leave after every 3 years. However, in all these cases, a minimum of 60 days of earned leave must be accumulated. In the light of the decision of the 102nd Board meeting, the existing rules have been amended and made effective as per the provisions of the Labour Act from 1 January 2021 (attached to the extract of the Board meeting). In the light of this decision, payment against accrued leave to all eligible as on 31/12/20 is under process. It is true that it is written that the provision of leave under the Labour Act, 2006 has been introduced with effect from 1 January 2021.\n\nViolation No. 8, Section 234 Labour Participation Fund and Welfare Fund is not constituted and 5% of the net dividend is not deposited in the fund constituted as per the Leave Fund and Labour Welfare Foundation Act, 2006 at the specified rate (80:10:10) and in the system adopted, the Grameen Telecom Company’s warranty is limited by section 28 of the Act, 1994. Not-for-profit company profits are not distributable. In the present context, therefore, WPPF is not applicable to Gramin Telecom. It may be noted here that a total of 107 officers/employees of Grameen Telecom have filed a case against the organization for the benefits of WPPF. The case is currently pending in the 3rd Labour Court. If the judgment in this case is promulgated, you will be informed about it and necessary steps will be taken to implement the promulgated judgment. It is also noted that the People’s Republic of Bangladesh Government Ministry of Labour and Employment has been informed in this regard through letter DDC/MDS/2021-504 dated 21/08/21. A copy of which is attached for your reference. It is true that this is written It is true that the attachment Exhibit 6 is not submitted in court. It is true that in view of the reply, it is written that “your kind consideration of the 3 documents is requested”. We have considered the documents. It is true that no letter was given to the respondent after consideration. No documents regarding consideration have been submitted as Exhibits in the court.\n\nFrom the 8 violations of the respondent, after carefully considering their replies and documents, a case was filed for only 3 violations. It is not true, without considering the reply of the respondent, I have arbitrarily and hastily filed a case to harass Dr. Yunus and 3 others with him without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves or to humiliate them in the country and outside the country.\n\nIt is true that Exhibit (Exhibit 1) dated 24/01/17 will not be filed in court just by uploading it on our website. It is not true that I lied about what Ashraful Islam, who signed the checklist, said as Managing Director. It is not true that, I have accused under the pressure of special circles, even though I have not seen the cases of the defendants before. True that Section 4(7) of the Labour Act states about permanent workers association. It is not true that the provisions of 4(7) and 4(8) have not been violated by the respondents. True that 4 (8) has given the association of workers. It is not true that if the employment of the worker is not permanent, the Labour Act will be violated. There is no such provision in 4(7) and 4(8) of the Labour Act. True that 4 (7) and 4 (8) is not about crime. True that 4 (7) and 4 (8) of the Labour Act do not contain the fact that it will be a crime if it is not observed in these two sections. It is true that at the time of filing the case, there is a further condition in section 4(8) that even if the confirmation letter is not given at the end of the apprenticeship period or at the end of 3 months extension, according to the provisions of sub-section (7) the employment of the concerned worker will be considered as permanent. The respondents wrote in reply that they have appointed the workers on contractual basis and also sent the sample along with us. It is true that in the notice dated 01/03/20 the above was mentioned in column 2. True that, in reply of the defendants (Exhibit 3) it is stated that “As per the employment rules of Grameen Telecom, all the workers are appointed for 3 years and provided with provident fund, gratuity, earned leave like permanent employees. This employment contract is renewed every 3 years. It is noted that Grameen Phone’s original work is Polyphone activities and providing after-sales service for Nokia mobile handsets, managed through contract with Grameen Phone and renewed every 3 years. Similarly, after sales service of Nokia handsets is managed through contract with Nokia and can be terminated by either party on 3 months’ notice as per Nokia contract. Since Grameen Telecom does not have any permanent operations and its business activities are conducted on the basis of contracts with various parties, for the work that is being contracted, the manpower required according to the type of business needs to be employed in the light of the special skills and requirements.\n\nIt is true that in the notice dated 19/08/21, it is again stated that the employment of the officers/employees of the organization has not been extended on completion of the apprenticeship period. True that the defendant has replied to this notice on 29/08/21. True that in the reply, the defendant said, “The Grameen Telecom Company is a non-profitable company created under Section 28 of the Act.” The organization makes contractual appointments”.\n\nIt is true that even after mentioning the measures taken in response to the reply dated 09/03/20 and the notice dated 19/08/21, without taking them into consideration and stating that there is any objection or violation regarding compliance, no notice was given before the case. Because in response to the notice dated 19/08/21 sent to Grameen Telecom on 01/03/20, the respondent repeated the same statement and failed to obey the law and violated the law. It is true that we have not visited the respondents’ organization to inspect their claimed compliance after the respondents’ reply of 29/08/21. It is not true that a case was filed against the respondent without inspection. I have visited the respondents’ organization 2 times before.\n\nIt is true that no worker has complained to us that the jobs of the workers have not been made permanent. Even though there is no complaint from the workers, we carried out the inspection because the organization has to be inspected according to the Annual Performance Agreement. It is true that a case cannot be filed without further inspection if any complaint has been complied with Grameen Telecom has been inspected 2 times and their response shows fraud and negligence. After examining the reply of the respondent, the case was filed. Attachment given with reply. I have checked the true attachment and have not submitted it to the court. It is true that no one has ever been brought before the court for the permanent employment of Grameen Telecom workers. It is true that that there was no court order to make the employment of any worker of Grameen Telecom permanent in view of any petition of ours. It is not true that Gramin Telecom had no order to make the workers permanent, violation of which constituted a criminal offence. Because the Directorate of Factories after inspecting the factory, finding the factory and the organization violated the Labour Act, if the case is filed in the court, the court will give an order. We have not taken any steps to resolve those Grameen Telecom workers whose jobs have not been regularized and Grameen Telecom. A case was filed without taking the initiative of settlement in the course of action. It is not true that whereas as per section 4(8) the company has not made the employees’ employment permanent but their employment has been permanent after a certain period of time, the case has been filed knowingly or there is no expediency in the case.\n\nThe case is filed because the respondent has made contractual appointments. Not true that the respondent has appointed the workers on temporary contractual basis as per 4(d) of the Labour Act or since the activities of Grameen Telecom are on temporary contractual basis, all its workers have been appointed on temporary contractual basis or accordingly the contract of the workers is renewed along with the renewal of the contract of Grameen Telecom. Or payment of gratuity, allowance, accrued leave provident fund etc. is made to the workers as any permanent worker or Section 3 of the Labour Act is not applicable to the organization. I have filed a complaint under Section 117 of the Labour Act. I have related all the sub-sections in section 117 because the respondent has violated the Labour Act and labour rules and has not kept the register in accordance with the rules. It is not true that my statement is not consistent with Rule 107. True that Rule 107 deals with calculation of annual leave, cash payment of accrued leave etc.\n\nIt is mentioned in 177(7) that if a worker applies for accrued leave, if the employer does not do so, the said leave shall be added to the limit specified in sub-section (5) or (6) for the respective worker.\n\nNo worker has complained to us in this regard. It is not true that if a worker of Grameen Telecom applies for accrued leave and it is not granted, then his leave shall be added as per law in addition to the limit mentioned in (5) and (6), should be added according to law. But in its reply dated 09/03/20, Grameen has said that after completing the apprenticeship period and on becoming regular, the employees get the earned leave and the need is encashed. Again, in the reply dated 29/08/21 it said that 1 month’s basic salary can be accepted in lieu of accrued leave for the first time after 6 years of contractual appointment. Thereafter 1 month’s basic salary will be paid against earned leave after every 3 years, but in this case minimum 60 days of earned leave must be accumulated.\n\nIt is true that 117 (1) is applicable to adult workers. True that Section 117 (2) shall apply to minor workers. It is true that Grameen Telecom has no child labour, 117 (1)(a) will apply to Grameen Telecom case. It is not true that as per 117 (5)(b) of Labour Act minimum 60 days is mentioned. It is true that in response on 29/08/21, it has been stated that their existing law regarding earned leave has been amended as per the decision of the 102nd Board meeting and the Labour Act has been implemented with retrospective effect from 01/01/21.\n\nIt is true that it is also written in view of your notice dated 19/08/21. Not true that there is no violation of rules with respect to granting of earned leave. Even if the accrued leave is not paid to the worker on specified time which is in 117 (5)(b) provisioned as per the respondent, it is not true that I have made false allegations against the defendants.\n\nIt is true that it is not said in the petition of the case that fraud and negligence were found in the criminals’ reply and in our 2 times visit. Not true. There was no violation in the attachment of the reply of the defendants and therefore I have not filed the affidavits with the reply. True it is not there in the labour law that contract-based employment cannot be given. In case of Grameen Telecom, contract-based employment is a crime because Grameen does not have registration of contractual employment, it is not known whether Grameen Telecom has applied for registration. True in response to the notice dated 01/03/20, Grameen Telecom mentioned on 01/03/20 that Grameen Telecom does not have any permanent activities and on the basis of contract with various organizations, Grameen Telecom hires workers on contractual basis according to the type of business. Grameen Telecom applied for registration on 28/02/18 which is mentioned in their reply and as mentioned it was not informed to Grameen Telecom and again on 25/08/21 Grameen Telecom applied for approval with attachment in reply which is not true. Because what is required for contract base recruitment, Grameen Telecom did not do that. They have requested for the approval of employment regulations. It is true that as per 3(1) of the Labour Act there is a provision that the organization should have its own employment regulations. The employment rules contain all the matters related to the contractual appointment or regular appointment of the organization or separately, the law does not mention about the contractual registration, it is not true. Not true according to the Labour Act, the petition is supposed to be disposed of within 90 days of the petition, but by not doing so the mills directorate has violated the law. It is not true that the order is aggrieved and cannot be appealed, so we did not give the order or we did it inspired by the purpose or the labour inspector instead of law protector became a law eater in this case. True section 117 does not deal with maintenance of register. Not true Section 117 relating to all the sub-sections of this Act against the defendants cannot be sued under Section 117. Where section 117 applies, the relevant sub-sections shall be attached. It is not true when we filed the case, we did not have general knowledge about this matter, have filed the case in this regard at the instigation of special circles.\n\nThe 3rd allegation against the defendants in the petition of the case is violation of Section 234. Complaints have been brought after reviewing these laws while making the complaint. It is true that it is mentioned in Section 236 that if the provisions of Section 234 fail to be complied with, then the Directorate of Inspection of Factories and Institutions will order to comply within a specified period. Grameen Telecom has not been directed to comply with Section 236 within a specified time. Because Grameen Telecom in its reply dated 09/03/20 pointed out that Grameen Telecom Company Act does not have provision for payment of dividend under section 28 of Grameen Telecom Companies Act and therefore WPPF is not applicable to Grameen Telecom. Again, in reply dated 29/08/21 said Grameen Telecom is limited by guarantee under Section 28 of the Grameen Telecom Companies Act, 1994, not-for-profit company whose dividend is not distributable so WPPF is not applicable to Grameen Telecom and further said that there is a case pending in court in this regard. The cases filed by the workers are part of the government’s 80:10:10 by law, that’s why government filed a case, which is under trial. In reply dated 09/03/20 and 29/08/21 of the defendants, as per section 28 of the Grameen Companies Act provision of dividend payment is not applicable therefore WPPF is not applicable to Grameen Telecom, hence we have not given directions under section 236 (1) is not true. It is not true that, as is mentioned in the reply of the defendant dated 09/03/20 and 29/08/21 the Grameen Telecom Company being a not-for-profit company WPPF is not applicable to them is accepted by us and by law has not given instructions under Section 236 (1)or Section 236 (3), in case of failure to pay the fine of Taka 1 lakh, we have not made arrangements to impose a fine of Taka 5,000/- daily or order of the payment within 60 days or collect this amount as per the Public Demand Recovery Act. It is not true that because the Inspector General did not fix the time specified in 236 (1), or because of penalty, the respondent was deprived of the opportunity of 45 days and 30 days to apply for reconsideration under section 236 (4). It is true that the exercise of the power of Section 319 (5) is specifically inserted in Section Nineteenth Section 4(7), (8), 117, 234 Sections 4(7), (8), 117, 234 of the charges brought against the accused for use in respect of offences, punishments and procedures; not true, but what is contained in 303(E) and 307 mentions the punishment for other offenses 4(7)(8), 117, 234, therefore I complained under section 303(E) and 307. It is true that I have asked for punishment as requested for the violation of the sections, which are not mentioned in Chapter Nineteen.\n\nI have been in the Directorate of Inspection of Factories and Institutions since August 2015. It is true that this organization is under the Ministry of Labour and Employment. I do not know whether the Directorate of Factories and the Directorate of Labour are following the labour laws. As far as I know Chapter Thirteen deals with the Directorate of Labour. It is true that as per 319 (5), the Directorate of Factories is empowered to file a complaint against an individual in the Labour Court. It is true that Chapter Twenty-nine is about crimyself and conflict. It is true that 319 (5) about offense is related to the fact, true that apart from Chapter Nineteen, Sections 4(7)(8), 117, 234 of the Labour Act are not marked as offences. It is not true that as Section 4(7), (8), 117, 234 is not a section on crime, therefore these sections are not applicable to other offenses under Section 307.\n\nIt is true that 8(7)(8) provides for civil remedy and section 117 provides for civil remedy. It is true that as per 234, civil remedy is given in Section 236. It is true that CBA works on behalf of workers in mills and factories. There is a labour and employee trade union in Grameen Telecom. We did not speak to the trade union for their opinion during the inspection of the organization. It is not true that according to the law, the Directorate of Inspection of Factories and Establishments can file only criminal cases, but not civil cases. It is not true that as per 4(7)(8), 117, 234, being a civil offense, the labour department has the sole right to take action on trade union matters in the interests of workers. It is not true that Section 4(7)(8), 117, 234 is a civil violation and we do not have legal jurisdiction to file a criminal case against the defendants for the said violation or if the violation is related to trade union, I do not know whether it is a labour department matter. It is not known whether a permanent worker can form a trade union or whether a trade union can be registered. It is not true that I said I do not know even though I knew. It is not known whether the Grameen Telecom Workers Union has filed a 12-point claim or industrial dispute under Section 210 of the Labour Act with the Managing Director on behalf of the workers. It is not known whether the claims are described in Sections 4(7)(8), 117, 234 of the said 12 points. Not true that I lied. It is not known whether the trade union filed a case in the Third Labour Court regarding the said claim on 19/12/19. I came to know that the workers filed a case. It is not true that we do not have jurisdiction to inspect the organization while the case is pending in the labour court or while the case filed in the Labour Court regarding the attestation letter of the Department of Labour was pending after the workers of Gramin Telecom applied to the Directorate of Labour, the Department of Mills had no legal authority to inspect the same on 01/03/20 and 19/08/21 or file a harassment suit on the false allegations by making the so-called inspections in violation of the labour laws.\n\nThe number of workers of Grameen Telecom is 67 according to the last inspection. It is true that the Labour Act provides the number of workers. It is true that as per the law, it is our responsibility to protect the interests of the workers. I cannot name any worker who was working at Grameen Telecom during the inspection. It is not true that Gramin Telecom is not an industry related organization. Grameen Telecom has no industrial plant. When I visited Grameen Telecom last time, I got to know 67 workers according to the number of workers they said. True that there is a record of Grameen Telecom in the Directorate of Inspection of Factories and Establishments. According to the records of Grameen Telecom in our company, I do not know the number of workers at this moment. It is not true that the record mentions 67 officers/employees out of which 9 are workers. It is true that Grameen Telecom is a merit-based organization, where most of the workers are officers. Workers as per the labour law. At the time of last inspection on 16/08/21, there were 09 workers or among them 5 drivers and 4 messengers or 5 drivers respectively: Khalilur Rahman, ID No. 2, Md. Rahim ID No. 381, Md. Sohrab Hossain Khalifa ID No. 152, Md. Sadiq ID No. 185, Md. Nazrul Islam ID No. 339, I have no information about it. It is not true that messenger worker Abul Hasnat ID No. 3, Md. Abdur Rauf ID No. 29. Md. Nizam Uddin ID No. 1, Md. Nasir Uddin ID No. 242. Because, 67 of them are workers. It is not true that except for 9, the remaining 58 officers are not workers. It is not true that the alleged fake inspection list was created on 16/08/21 by concealing the names and designations of Managing Directors, Managers, Deputy Managers, Assistant Managers, Senior Officers, Officers, Assistant Officers, total 58 persons, by falsely arranging and showing 9 workers (5 drivers) 4 (messengers), total 67 persons as workers: purposefully filed a false case against Grameen Telecom. It is true that in the petition of this case filed by the plaintiff on 09/01/21, during the on-site inspection of the defendant organization by the plaintiff on 09/02/20, the above violations were found along with other violations. It is true that a notice was sent by the plaintiff on 01/03/20 to rectify the said violation. It is true that it is also mentioned in the petition that according to the content of the said letter, the violated section and rules have been amended and the reply given on 09/03/20 is not satisfactory. Other than the sections mentioned in the defendant’s reply petition, the rest of the sections and rules of the notice were amended and were under process. It is true that it is mentioned in the petition that the plaintiff inspected the site again on the instructions of the higher authorities and sent a registered letter on 19/08/21.\n\nIt is true that it is also mentioned in the petition that plaintiff thinks the defendant’s reply dated 29/08/21 is not satisfactory. In view of the plaintiff’s notice, the defendant has amended some of the violated sections and rules, but some of them are still in process. In the reply dated 09/03/20, the violated section 5 was amended. The rest were under process. In reply dated 29/08/21, section 3 was in process and the Sections 5, 6, 46, 47, 48 were amended. In the reply dated 09/03/20 and 29/08/21, the section which is under amendment and process is not specifically mentioned in the petition. True that, in reply to the notice dated 01/03/20, it is mentioned in the petition that the defendant responded by amending the violations on 09/03/20. But it is taken that the reply is not satisfactory. True that, in the view of the notice dated 19/08/21, in the defendant’s response dated 29/08/21, the reply was given by amending the provisions of the violated sections of the notice. It is written in the petition that the reply was not satisfactory. It has been stated in the petition about the matters that were violated. True that, the plaintiff wrote in petition “It appears that defendant is not respecting prevailing labour laws”, it is not true that the plaintiff has not firmly asserted. True that, the plaintiff has stated in the petition that the plaintiff thinks the defendants have committed offenses punishable under Sections 307 and 303(E) of the Labour Act (Amendment) 2013. Not true that, it is said the Plaintiff does not firmly believe. It is not true that the defendants have not violated any provisions of the sections of the petition or therefore the defendants have not committed the crime of being punished for the violation of the said law or no reason has arisen to issue an order to amend the alleged violations mentioned in section 310 by fixing the time limit or there is no need to issue such an order to the defendants. True that, it is stated in Article of Memorandum 5.5 of the defendants that all the income of Grameen Telecom will be used for various important purposes but no bonus or profit will be given to anyone. True that, it is written that no dividend will be given to any member or anyone at the time of registration. Chief officer of Grameen Telecom is Managing Director /Chairman. It is not true that I did not say that the permission of the Labour Department should be obtained as per 3(a) of the Act in case of contractual employment. True that, I did not accuse the organization. It is not true that I have filed a case against the Honorary Chairman and others for harassing at the instigation of others without accusing the organization.\n\nPW-2 mentioned in his statement, “I am working as Deputy Inspector General of Labour (General), in the Directorate of Inspection for Factories and Establishments. As a member of the team formed by the office on 12/08/21, I inspected Grameen Telecom, Mirpur on 16/08/21 with other members of the team. During the inspection, I started working in the light of the notice given on 09/02/20. A notice was sent to Grameen Telecom on 19/08/21.\n\nWe found the same violations mentioned in the 2020 notice during the 2021 inspection. Grameen Telecom replied to the notice on 29/08/21. In response, Grameen Telecom mentioned that they recruit on contractual basis. I submitted a certified photocopy of a contractual appointment dated 17/11/16. Attested on 13/09/23, Exhibit 09, Attested by Dr. Dipadatta, Assistant Inspector General, I know the signature of the attester. Signature Exhibit 91)\n\nIn the reply dated 29/08/21, Grameen Telecom wrote that temporary workers are made permanent at the end of the tenure. All are contractually employed. This is a violation of the labour law. It also said in the reply that annual leave is encashed after 3 years and 1 basic salary is paid. This is also a violation of the labour law! In the reply, it was also there that the case regarding profits is in the High Court. The case is about the workers’ share. We have demanded the share of the Workers Welfare Foundation, which Grameen Telecom has never deposited. The calculation is 80:10:10. A case was filed on 9/9/21 regarding the above 3 violations. A remedy is desired for the respondent having violated the labour law. This is my testimony.\n\nHere, the witness stated in the cross-examination:\n\n“When I inspected Grameen Telecom on 16/08/21, I had no idea about the structure and functioning of Grameen Telecom. Inspected to get the idea. Grameen Telecom is a commercial enterprise. I do not know at this point whether it was a commercial enterprise under any law. Grameen Telecom is Grameen Phone’s partnership company, they do the activities related to Nokia handsets like after sales service, sales (according to them). This matter itself was in the official record. I do not know if Grameen Telecom does after sales service of Grameen Phone or Palli phone. It is true in section 3 of the Labour Act that the organizations which cannot directly comply with the provisions of the Labour Act can have their own service rules. As per Section 04, contractual appointment cannot be given. Not true that, not mentioned. True that, Section 4 of the Labour Act mentioned the classification of workers and does not say anything about contractual employment. Nowhere in the Labour Act it is said that contractual appointments can be made. I do not know whether it is said that contractual appointments cannot be made. My title is Labour Inspector (General). I have to conduct the labour inspection under labour laws. Not true that, I went to visit Grameen Telecom without any idea about the labour law or said that contractual appointment, without any idea at the behest of the higher authority, is a violation of the labour law. True that, in the copy of the contractual appointment I have submitted, it is written that the contractual appointment of the assistant officer will be effective for 3 years.\n\nGrameen Telecom’s activities are contractual, so they appoint on a 3-year contractual basis, it is written in the appointment letter. True that, it is written in the appointment letter that if your overall activities during the apprenticeship period are not satisfactory to the authorities, the tenure will be increased further. What will be the pay scale of the job is mentioned in the appointment letter. It is not true that under the contractual activities of Grameen Telecom, the officer of my submission appointment letter is a permanent officer of Grameen Telecom, no letter was given to make the worker permanent. In the view of the appointment letter dated 17/11/16 (Exhibit: 9), I do not have any paper at this time whether the candidate’s job has been regularized or what has been done or whether his job was going on. I did not say from the assumption that the officer on the appointment letter was not made permanent later. Learned from Grameen Telecom’s reply that none of the workers of Grameen Telecom are permanent workers. True that in reply dated 29/08/21 to the notice dated 19/08/21 of Grameen Telecom, regarding the permanency of the jobs of the workers and employees, the business has mentioned that according to the law of the not-for-profit company organization created under Section 28 of the Grameen Telecom Company Act, the workers have been made permanent at the end of the apprenticeship, all the workers of the organization have been appointed on contractual basis. It is not true that the jobs of the workers have been made permanent, so the workers are working under the pay scale as permanent employees. It is true that Grameen Telecom’s reply dated 29/o8/21 said that every officer and employee of Grameen Telecom has been given ID card and a register is maintained in Form 6 (A). According to the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, Amendment 2015, Rule 15, 19 (4), the appointment letter is given in your office for approval. Copy attached. It is true that did not submit that copy. Not true that the ID card is not issued to the worker until his employment is permanent.\n\nViolation of section 4(7)(8) of the Labour Act is mentioned in the petition. According to Workers 4 (8), although no worker is made permanent, they will be considered permanent workers according to the provisions of the law. It is true that according to the reply dated 29/08/21, Grameen Telecom gives earned leave after every 3 years, it is a violation of the labour law, I have said in the testimony. The date was not 29/08/21 in the reply of year 2020, in the reply of year 2021 for the first time after 6 years. It is true that in column 4 of Exhibit 9, it is mentioned that the officer can enjoy 20 days casual leave in every year and 30 days earned leave in a year after apprenticeship as per the rules of the company. According to the Bangladesh Labour Act, 1 day leave is earned after every 18 days. It is true that in that case, 14 days in a year, including public holidays. Not true that Grameen Telecom has given 30 days earned leave more than the leave prescribed by law. Not true that according to Grameen Telecom’s own service rules, 90 days are earned in 3 years, out of which 60 days are accumulated and 30 days are encashed, which according to the labour law, 7 days out of 14 days are accumulated in a year and 7 days are encashed or 21 days are encashed in 3 years or Grameen Telecom gives 9 days more than the labour law.\n\nIt is not true that I lied. Half is to be encashed but Grameen Telecom does not do that. It is not true that the workers of Grameen Telecom are merit-based employees and they are developed through training, so the merit-based employees need to have a longer period of service, so after 6 years of the contractual appointment, 1 month’s salary will be paid for the first time myself and then 1 month’s basic salary will be paid against the earned leave every three years, but in this case, a minimum of 60 days earned leave has to be accumulated or because of doing so, the employees of Grameen Telecom receive 6 basic salaries in addition to 10 earned leaves in 10 years. No worker of Grameen Telecom has complained to us that they are not getting earned leave. It is true that it is mentioned in section 117 (7) of the Labour Act that if a worker applies for earned leave, but if the leave is not granted, it shall be added to the concerned worker’s account in addition to the limit of of sub-section (5) and (6). It is true that it is said that the net profit was not deposited in the funds of the Workers’ Welfare Foundation as 80:10:10. Not true that the not-for-profit company created under section 28 of the Grameen Telecom Companies Act, 1994, whose profit is not distributable, or WPPF does not apply to the workers of Grameen Telephone or 80:10:10 is not applicable for Grameen Telecom. True that Section 232 of the Bangladesh Labour Act provides that the participation of workers in the profits of the company shall be applicable to the establishments engaged in this industry. Not true that, Grameen Telecom does not work as a factory, so Section 232 will not apply to Grameen Telecom. According to Section 233 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, Amendment 2013, Grameen Telecom does not do work related to industrial activity or Grameen Telecom does not do the activities related to the industrial work declared by the Ministry of Labour and Employment SRO 336-Act/2013 dated 7 October 2010, so the share of the net profit as dividend 80:10:10 in section 232 of the workers, it is not true that share of net profit, the provision of payment to the Participation Fund, Welfare Fund and Workers Welfare Foundation Fund will not be applicable. It is not true that “false testimony was given, or the statement is false, fabricated baseless or despite not having knowledge about Grameen Telecom’s activities and labour laws, company laws, I have given this statement at the instigation of vested quarters and to protect the interests and defamation of Mohammad Yunus and three others”.\n\nPW-3 mentioned in his statement, “As a member of the inspection team, I along with other members of team inspected Grameen Telecom, Mirpur, Dhaka on 16/08/21 in the office order of the Directorate of Inspection for Factories and Establishments, Deputy Inspector General’s Office, Dhaka dated 12/08/21.\n\nDuring the inspection, other members of the team paid tribute to the late Labour Inspector S.M. Md Arifuzzaman, Labour Inspector Tariqul Islam, Labour Inspector Hadiuzzaman, Labour Inspector Mizanur Rehman and I signed the inspection checklist. During the inspection by the then inspection team on 09/02/20, emphasizing on the violation of specific section 09 and rules of Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 and Bangladesh Labour Rules, 2015, I started the inspection procedure. We verify the written reply of the organization authorities in 2020 and the inspection theory and data dated 16/08/21. In view of this, the inspection team sent a notice to Grameen Telecom on 19/08/21 from the Directorate of Inspection for Factories and Establishments recommending the implementation of specific section 8 and rules of Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 and Bangladesh Labour Code 2015. The notice was signed by all the members of the inspection team. On 29/08/21, the Grameen Telecom Authority submitted a written reply to the notice to the Directorate of Inspection for Factories and Establishments, Deputy Inspector General’s office, Dhaka. The written reply dated 29/08/21 is found to be consistent (the same) as the written reply of 2020. From this, it is evident to the inspection team that Grameen Telecom does not respect the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 and Bangladesh Labour Rules 2015, in this context, the late Labour Inspector S.M. Arifuzzaman filed a complaint with the Honorable Third Labour Court on 09/09/21, mentioning specific 3 sections and rules of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 and Bangladesh Labour Rules 2015. Grameen Telecom Company violated the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 and Bangladesh Labour Rules 2015 mentioned in the petition of the case. Justice requested against the company according to the law and rules for the violation. This is my testimony.\n\nHere, the witness stated in the cross-examination:\n\n“We, the 5 members of the inspection team inspected Grameen Telecom, Mirpur on 16/08/21. The inspection team was formed by our Deputy Inspector General. Among the 05 members, the team leader was the late labour Inspector S.M. Arifuzzaman. The order was issued on 12/08/21. The order specified the date on which the inspection should be done. I do not know whether the order of the Deputy Inspector General dated 12/08/21 has been filed in this case. I am aware of the petition of the case. In the petition dated 12/08/21, there is no mention of the order for the formation of a team of 5 inspectors and S.M. Arifuzzaman, the team leader.\n\nS.M. Arifuzzaman, the team leader of my so-called team consisting of five inspectors, is the complainant of this case. In the petition, the plaintiff did not mention that a team of 5 members accompanied him to the said inspection. It is true that in the petition, the plaintiff has mentioned that the organization has been inspected by the plaintiff. It is not true that according to the plaintiff, 5 of us were not on the inspection with the plaintiff. It is true that It is written in the petition that the plaintiff inspected the Grameen Telecom Company on 16/08/21 under the direction of the Deputy Inspector General. It is true that according to the order of the Deputy Inspector General, 5 of us, along with the plaintiff, inspected the Grameen Telecom organization. It is true that we inspected with the plaintiff. It is not true that on 16/08/21, remaining 4 did not go for inspection of Grameen Telecom organization without the plaintiff. It is not true that on 16/08/21, the plaintiff went for inspection Grameen Telecom alone or we 5 members did not go together for inspection or the plaintiff signed the checklist alone or the other 4 of us did not sign the checklist or therefore, the checklist provided to Grameen Telecom did not have the signature of any member other than the plaintiff or even the plaintiff’s seal was not given below the signature of the plaintiff. It is not true that the last paragraph in the checklist prepared on 16/08/21 was completely empty and many of the other parts of paragraphs were empty, which is a conspiracy by us 4 inspectors and chief inspectors in connivance and filled through fraud and using his seal below the signature of the plaintiff, completed the check list to prove the false allegations against the accused. It is not true that the inspection dated 16/08/21 was done only by the plaintiff or only the plaintiff Arifuzzaman had the authority to give notice dated 19/08/21 or therefore, the notice dated 19/08/21 was to be given by the plaintiff or the notice dated 19/08/21 has been signed by the plaintiff or the copy signed by the plaintiff was given appropriately to the Deputy Inspector General or we, the other 4 labour inspectors, illegally signed next to the first signature of the letter. It is not true that if we had signed according to the rules, then while sending the copy to the Deputy Inspector General, there would have been the signatures of 4 of us plaintiffs. It is not true that our actions prove that we have done everything fraudulently. It is not true that apart from the plaintiff, the remaining 4 signatories (in the checklist) the labour inspector did not go to the site. The statement of the plaintiff regarding the inspection of Grameen Telecom on 16/08/21 is correct. The office we inspected was Mirpur, Baksnagar. Zoo Road is longitudinal in the north south. The Grameen Telecom building is a multi-storied building, estimated to be 15 floors. I do not know if there are any other offices in this building. I cannot remember, to which floor I went to. Used the elevator. I do not remember for which floor I used the elevator. We sat in the conference room. There was no factory where we sat. In my view, it was an office. We went there and made the list.\n\nI listed 67 people who were employed. According to the information provided by the company, 67 people are employed. There were 4/5 people from the organization. Do not know what designations they are. There was one whose name was Nazmul Islam. That time, did not know his designation. Do not know how square foot the office is. The people I saw were sitting at the desk, working. It is not true that I gave false information. It is true that I did not go to Grameen Telecom, Plot No. 6, Barabagh, Mirpur, Grameen Bhavan. It is true that I did not go to the address written at the beginning of Exhibit 4. It is not true that in the first part of the checklist, in the general information in column A, the full name of the address where I went was Grameen Telecom, Barabagh, Plot No. 6, Mirpur, Dhaka Grameen Bank, Housing Complex, Dhaka as per the statement in the checklist. It is not true that I did not go to the site or because I did not go to the site, I do not know the designation of any officer there. I went to the office of Baksnagar Zoo Road in Mirpur and saw the working environment, health environment of the workers. I went to this address and saw the workers working. I did not ask if they were officers or workers. I do not know whether the building I have been to is the most modern building in the country. The elevator I went to was taken by the operator. I do not know who is the elevator operator in the building. I parked the car and went to the elevator. I made an entry of the name, address at the security point. I cannot say how many elevators the building has. The staff of the organization took me, I do not remember to which floor they took me in the elevator. It is not true that I did not go there, therefore I cannot say. We did not inspect all the rooms. It is not true that we did not go for the inspection of Grameen Telecom organization. Had I gone, I would see everything. It is not known whether the inspection dated 09/02/20 was in accordance with the order of the Deputy Inspector General. I have learned about the violations of the sections and rules during the inspection on 09/02/20 in their written reply and data analysis. I did not visit for the inspection dated 09/02/20. Tariqul Islam, Swapna Rani Adya, i.e. inspectors of the area, were in that inspection. True that There is no mention in the petition that Tariqul Islam and Swapna Rani Adya went for the inspection on 09/02/20. It is true that it is written in the petition that the plaintiff has inspected the above organization on site on 09/02/20. It is true that according to section 3 of the Labour Act, any organization can have rules of Labour appointment for the appointment of workers and there is no rule that can be less favorable to any worker than the labour law. It is true that Section 4 of the labour Act mentions the classification of workers, the period of apprenticeship and the provision of temporary workers. It is not true that Grameen Telecom appoints temporary workers on contractual basis under section 3 and section 4 (5) of the labour Law. Since Grameen Telecom does not have its own permanent activities and it operates on a contractual basis, I do not know whether all their employees are appointed on contractual basis under contractual work. In response to 09/03/20, Grameen Telecom said in this regard that according to the appointment rules of Grameen Telecom, the appointment is given for 3 years and benefits like entitled gratuity, earned leave, etc. are provided like permanent workers.\n\nIt is mentioned that this contract is renewed every 3 years, the main work of Grameen Telecom is to operate after sales service activities of Palli phone and Nokia handsets on the basis of agreement with Grameen Phone and the contract is renewed after 3 years. Similarly, after sales service of Nokia handsets is operated through contract with Nokia and both parties can terminate the operation of the agreement with 3 months’ notice. It is true that since Grameen Telecom does not have any permanent activities and operates through agreements with various organizations, therefore, whenever an agreement is made with any organization, the manpower has to be recruited accordingly, hence the workers of Grameen Telecom are appointed on a contractual basis. It is true that before going for inspection of Grameen Telecom, we, the team members, studied which all topics are to be seen. It is true that it is written in the petition, that the violation mentioned in the notice dated 01/03/20 was amended and reply was given on 09/03/20. According to the Labour Act, Grameen Telecom did not make any amendment. Employment rules not approved by the Director General, workers’ jobs were not made permanent according to Section 4(7)(8) of the Labour Act, workers’ leave was not encashed under Section 117 of the Labour Act, Section 223 of the Labour Act has not been implemented৷ I do not know which of the violations found in the inspection on 09/02/20 have been amended. In context of notice dated 19/08/21 in the plaintiff’s statement, I do not know, which all amendments did not satisfy the plaintiff in response of the organization dated 29/08/21, true, Section 4 (8) of the Labour Act states that, even if the apprentice worker’s job is not permanent, after a certain time, the job will become permanent as per law. No worker of Grameen Telecom has made an application to us saying that, their jobs were not made permanent. We did not find anyone named Sadman Shakib in front of us during the inspection. It is true that according to the provisions of the labour Act i.e. Section 4 (8), all the workers of Grameen Telecom have become permanent. It is not true that I lied that Grameen Telecom workers are not given annual leave. It is not true that workers of Grameen Telecom are given annual leave beyond the leave prescribed by law | It is true that if a worker seeks annual leave under section 117 (7), if the organization does not grant it, it will be added as leave in addition to the limit mentioned in 117 (5) and 117 (6). It is not known whether any worker of Grameen Telecom has asked for earned leave. I do not know what will happen if participation fund is not funded. It is true that any company or board of trustees failing to comply with the provisions of section 234 will get the benefit under section 236. No notice has been given under section 236 (1). It is true that Section 236 (2) does not say anything to the organization in relation with the provision. It is true that the organization did not comply with the Public Demand Recovery Act. It is not true that we have taken action against Grameen Telecom to cover up our failure. No case has been filed seeking the direction of the court to comply with the said 3 sections. I cannot say how many of the 67 workers are women and how many are men.\n\nI cannot tell you how many employees, how many officers are there. Grameen Telecom is a merit-based organization, most of which are officers and educated, trained and when we did the inspection, there were only 9 workers or we have filed case showing everyone as worker, not true.
