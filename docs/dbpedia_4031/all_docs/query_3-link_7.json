        "text": "Few dream of making it to the Olympics. Even fewer can dream of winning a gold and breaking the Olympics record, like Joseph did. But what Joseph did was show us what it means to have the hunger to excel. To go beyond what others think we are capable of. And to make our own dreams, big or small, come true. What Aug 12, 2016 also showed was how sports has the power to unite Singaporeans. Nothing compares with the screams of joy around the island the moment Joseph touched the edge of the pool ahead of the legendary Michael Phelps and other stars. Thank you, Jo. Thanks to your parents, May and the late Colin Schooling. And thanks to those who coached Jo from his earliest days. Including Vincent Poon, who first taught him to swim as a giggling 3 year old, and to be fearless against the bigger boys. You raised us all. Photo credit: Sport Singapore\n\nüì∞The latest edition of our #newsletter is here! üèÖJust over a month from today, 200+ teams will take the stage at the #Olympic Games 2024 in Paris. One of world sports' most ancient and prestigious contests, we will surely be glued to our screens as the tournament unfolds. The Indian contingent and its medal hopefuls too have set their sights on achieving sporting excellence when it matters the most. Sustaining high performance at one of the highest levels of sport is not an overnight task. Reputations can be made and unmade by the margin of a second, obscuring the years of preparation that preceded a contest. In this edition, our writers each examine high performance in sport from a different angle, exploring what it takes to build a robust system that delivers consistent results. üí´Imran Nadaph helps aspiring sports #leaders with a framework to unlock their own potential while nurturing the next generation of champions in Indian sports üèÖRajaraman G tracks the Indian contingent's preparation for the Olympics, highlighting all that sports governing bodies have been doing to back their athletes üèÜCol. Kumar Anupam zeroes in on key factors and strategies that can help India tap into its true potential, and excel at the Olympics Games for the years to come üèìMamata Prabhu takes us into the mind of an elite coach, and shares her insights to help coaches improve their craft üí•We're thrilled to feature original sports #research in an Indian setting! Col. Amarjeet Singh and Capt. Ashwini Trichal evaluated 235 sportspersons from 6 Olympics disciplines of a shooting high-performance centre for their study on skills transfer in sport. We feature some of their conclusions in this edition's Learn With ELMS. P.S. Sports leaders and administrators wanting to sharpen their high-performance skills - applications for the 6th edition of the High Performance Leadership Program will open soon!
