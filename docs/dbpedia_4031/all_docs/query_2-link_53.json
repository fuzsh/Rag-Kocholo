        "text": "Born into a challenging life in Algeria, “The Eagle” Mohamed Younes Rabah has emerged as a rising star in the world of Muay Thai.\n\nRaised in a crowded household with eight siblings, Rabah’s father, a dedicated teacher, worked tirelessly to support the family. Living in a modest home with his grandparents and other relatives, he understood the value of hard work and perseverance from an early age.\n\nDespite the popularity of soccer in his homeland, Rabah’s dreams took a different turn when he stumbled upon a small gym that offered kickboxing classes. Drawn to the discipline and intensity of martial arts, he soon realized that he harbored a burning desire to follow in the footsteps of his idol, the legendary kickboxer Badr Hari.\n\nWith financial constraints pressing upon him, Rabah started working at a young age to support both himself and his family. His determination to pursue his dream of becoming a world-class athlete only intensified with each passing day.\n\nThe Algerian’s talent did not go unnoticed. French-Algerian star Mehdi Zatout recognized Rabah’s potential and took him under his wing. The veteran provided his young charge with the opportunity to train at his gym in Thailand.\n\nWith Zatout as his coach, “The Eagle” compiled a perfect 13-0 record, and that led to a golden opportunity with ONE Championship. In a twist of fate, he was chosen as a replacement to face former ONE World Title challenger Saemapetch Fairtex in December 2023. He seized the chance of a lifetime, authoring a first-round knockout victory over the revered Thai superstar.\n\nNow, with the chance to prove that his triumph was no fluke, Rabah faces Saemapetch once again at ONE Fight Night 19 on Prime Video this Friday, February 16."
