        "text": "A court in Bangladesh has sentenced the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to six months in jail for violating the country's labour laws.\n\nProf Yunus' supporters say the case is politically motivated.\n\nThe acclaimed economist and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom - one of the firms he founded - were found guilty of failing to create a welfare fund for their workers.\n\nAll four deny any wrongdoing and have been granted bail pending appeals.\n\n\"As my lawyers have convincingly argued in court, this verdict against me is contrary to all legal precedent and logic,\" Prof Yunus said in a statement released after the verdict.\n\n\"I call for the Bangladeshi people to speak in one voice against injustice and in favour of democracy and human rights for each and every one of our citizens.\"\n\nThe 83-year-old Yunus, known internationally as the \"banker to the poor\", is credited with establishing a pioneering system of micro-finance loans helping to lift millions out of poverty.\n\nProf Yunus and his Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their pioneering work in 2006."
