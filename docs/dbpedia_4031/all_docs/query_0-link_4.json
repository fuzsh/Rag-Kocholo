All these\n\nefforts to showcase creative potential in turn build their capacities\n\nto convey their thoughts cogently and grow into responsible and\n\naccomplished persons in their lives.\n\nI trust that a good number of students and other members of\n\nacademic fraternity shall compete to have their professional and\n\nliterary contributions accepted for publication in the forthcoming\n\nissue of this e-magazine and I hope âSABZARâ with its quality\n\ncontent will emerge as a popular magazine among the students\n\nand other readers.\n\nI convey my best wishes to the Director, National Institute of\n\nTechnology, Srinagar and to the editorial team and wish them\n\nsuccess in their endeavours.\n\n(Manoj Sinha)\n\nEducationâs purpose is to\n\nreplace an empty mind with\n\nan open one.\n\n(Malcolm Forbes)\n\nP:08\n\nMessage\n\nI delightfully welcome you to the 2020-21 issue of our annual\n\nmagazine Sabzar.

Our Institute magazine Sabzar has been around for more than half a century. Sabzar in\n\nseveral languages connotes green. This name was coined for our magazine when people were yet\n\nto realize the importance of going green and benefits of green technologies for sustained living\n\non earth. âGo for Green Technologiesâ are the words echoing in almost every corner of the world\n\nin present day scenario due to such issues as climate change, global warming and sustainability.\n\nSabzar is a reminder to all of us of our responsibilities as engineers, innovators and scientists\n\nto look towards greener ideas, greener technologies and greener innovations. I am immensely\n\ndelighted that our latest issue of Institute annual magazine Sabzar 2020-2021 in e-form is at our\n\nfinger touch. The aim of our magazine is not to look for masterpieces of art of writing or storey\n\ntelling rather to carve spaces for those who may occasionally try their tryst with expression of ideas.\n\nInstitute magazines are meant for hunt of such treasure troves of hidden talent which our students\n\ninnately possess, that needs to be groomed, cultivated, and tapped. Sabzar provides one of the\n\nplatforms for such a milieu and an appropriate environment for nurturing our budding engineers\n\non a free and fair ground to express their way of looking at things. An honest, innocent and straight\n\nforward perception of sweet and sour faces of life from our young generation is always providing\n\na flavor of serendipity with the articles which are appearing in this issue of our magazine. You will\n\ndefinitely find in these pages some glimpses of talent that our Institute is bestowed with, in the\n\nform of several contributions. After reading the magazine, you will be with some questions, with\n\nsome answers and with some random thoughts. I am sure that we have been successful in inviting\n\na large spectrum of articles with diverse themes which like a rainbow has become conspicuous by\n\nits wonderful details. The colors and contours of contributions in this issue are immensely vibrant\n\nand self-explanatory. The extraordinary efforts of students for writing the articles for Sabzar is\n\nappreciated given that exams were hanging around like a sword of Damocles. Their hard work\n\nand cooperation coupled with lot of efforts of editorial team has really been praiseworthy and\n\noverwhelming resulting in the present issue of Sabzar.\n\nThe real challenging tasks of this issue of Sabzar 2021, from its inception to the final print were\n\nexecuted by Dr. Jaya, Dr. Ravi, Mr. M. Zehab and Mr. Syed Hadi. This required perseverance, patience\n\nand taste for artistic aspects of this literary work. All of them displayed enormous willingness to\n\ncooperate at all stages of this mammoth task. Words alone are not enough to express my gratitude\n\nto all the pains they took smilingly while donating a lot of time for this activity.\n\nBest wishes\n\nProf (Dr.) G.

But as aptly written by Emily Dickinson in the\n\nquoted lines, hope is ever-present in the human soul. NIT Srinagar\n\nfamily cradled hope in these tough times and continued to be\n\ncreative with words and imagination. This hope broke the walls of\n\ndespair, took the shape of words, and came out on the pages of\n\nour annual magazine Sabzar. Therefore, I share my delight with the\n\ninstitute fraternity at the publication of its 2020-21 issue.\n\nOn this occasion, I thank the Honâble Director of the Institute\n\nand Sabzarâs patron Prof. (Dr.) Rakesh Sehgal for rekindling hope\n\nin us and initiating this massive task. I am grateful to Prof. (Dr.)\n\nG. A. Harmain, the Editor-in-Chief, under whose expert guidance\n\nthe magazineâs publication was made possible. I also express my\n\ngratitude to Dr. Ravi Bhushan, Associate Editor for his hard work\n\nand coordination. I greatly appreciate the hard work, dedication,\n\nand promptness shown by Mr. Prabh Karan Singh and Ms. Ayushi\n\nChaudhary, members of the student editorial team for assisting me\n\nin the compilation of the articles.\n\nI congratulate the authors, the editorial team, and the Institute on\n\nthis proud moment and thank them for making me a part of it.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nDr. Jaya Shrivastava\n\nâHopeâ is the thing with\n\nfeathers â That perches in\n\nthe soul â And sings the tune\n\nwithout the words â And\n\nnever stops â At all â\n\n(Emily Dickinson)\n\nDr. Jaya Shrivastava\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nP:13\n\nThe way to get started is to quit\n\ntalking and begin doing.\n\n(Walt Disney)\n\nDeepak Meena\n\n2018BCIV103\n\n13\n\nP:14\n\n16-22\n\n23-44\n\n45\n\nDisclaimer: The ideas and opinions expressed are the sole responsibility of the authors and the\n\neditors do not bear any responsibility in this matter.

I am\n\nthankful to Dr Ravi Bhushan and Dr Jaya Shrivastava,\n\nour Associate Editors, who ensured successful\n\ncompletion of the magazine. Their efforts, sincerity,\n\nand methodical way of working in a team milieu\n\nwere very impressive and made the magazineâs\n\npublication a pleasant experience.

Without their help, the magazine would\n\nhave taken much longer time towards its completion.\n\nI would like to extend a thanks to some of the\n\nstudents namely, Mir Faizan, Hafeez Raza, Basar\n\nQari and Kamran Elyas for their unconditional\n\nsupport particularly for providing the photographs\n\nof different events of the college which made the\n\nmagazine more memorable.\n\nI am also thankful to my wife for her cooperation and\n\nhelp.\n\nProf. (Dr.) G A Harmain\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n45\n\nP:46\n\nLife is like riding a bicycle. To\n\nkeep your balance you must keep\n\nmoving.\n\n(Albert Einstein)\n\nTanveer Gulzar\n\n2019BMEC010\n\n46\n\nP:47\n\n47\n\nP:48\n\nManik Showkat\n\n2019BMEC055\n\nThe current outbreak of a deadly virus has affected\n\nevery stratum of human life, including swotting up\n\nfor acquiring knowledge and skills. Every sector is\n\nminimizing its repercussions by switching towards\n\nan online framework. The current education system\n\nof India, which is highly dependent on an offline\n\nframework, is also struggling in developing ways\n\nto switch towards cloud-based learning. As most\n\nof my academic peers from other continents had\n\nalready switched to online learning platforms, seeing\n\ntheir progress in that field made me think that learning\n\nonline is far better than learning offline. Being a frosh at NIT\n\nSrinagar makes me competent to form my opinion regarding\n\nthe experience with offline as well as online learning and I must\n\nsay it has been quite appalling for me to study in the online\n\nenvironment. Although offline learning has its demerits, the\n\nstructure and ethos on which the online learning platform is\n\nbased have their shortcomings. In this essay, I will argue why\n\noffline learning is better than online learning in Kashmir.\n\nOnline learning platforms are based upon integrated sets of interactive online services, also known\n\nas learning management systems (LMS). Companies providing these services are improving the\n\nLMS now and then thus making it more user-friendly and effective at the same time. This seems to\n\nbe an appropriate solution in these circumstances for almost everyone, including the educational\n\ninstitutes for providing education and study material for its enrolled students. But the users face\n\ndifficulty when the internet speed is reduced owing to 2G Network services. As per a survey, the\n\nminimum bandwidth requirement for online learning is 1.5Mbps (both upload and download speed)\n\nand providing even 0.4Mbps on 2G network spectrum: which is implausible, is considered to be an\n\nachievement for telecommunication companies. As a consequence of this, professors and students\n\nspend twice more time than others using the same for uploading/downloading a 10 MB file. Thus,\n\nthis limitation makes it quite impractical for a student to study online as âtime is moneyâ.\n\nThe predominant impediment of offline learning is infrastructural burdens. To run an Educational\n\nInstitute, some prerequisites need to be sufficed, such as having a building. In addition to this,\n\nWhich is\n\nBetter\n\nOnline Vs\n\nOffline\n\nLearning Experience\n\n48\n\nP:49\n\na well-established framework is also\n\nrequired. When all this is achieved,\n\nthen only the institution is capable of\n\ndelivering knowledge and skills to its\n\nstudents. Most colleges in India are\n\nalready established in accordance with\n\nan offline framework. As a result, the\n\nacademic staff is adroitly familiarized\n\nwith this environment and curriculum.\n\nUpgrading to an online framework\n\nwill require re-establishing some of\n\nthe pillars of the existing framework\n\nand training its academic staff before\n\nadapting to the new framework to\n\nwork efficiently. All these processes\n\nare tedious thus affecting studentâs\n\nacademic performance\n\nThe pre-eminent advantage of offline\n\nlearning over online is character\n\ndevelopment, also reckoned as âThe\n\nCollege Lifeâ. The curriculum of most of\n\nthe online courses is static and moored\n\nwhilst in offline mode, not only does\n\na student attend classes for course\n\nstudy but also participates in various\n\nactivities (such as student governance,\n\nathletics, academic and professional\n\nactivities, volunteer and service-related\n\nactivities, multicultural activities and\n\nother such activities) which, most of\n\nthe time have nothing to do with the\n\ncourse itself. Social interaction and\n\nadopting a group study environment\n\nare some of the most quintessential\n\nsoft skills students develop in their\n\ntenure at college or university as they\n\nare essential to interact productively\n\nand acquire leadership qualities and\n\nteamwork ethics. Attending an offline\n\ncourse has the advantage that there\n\nis a fixed area of study, thus getting a\n\nsense of productivity and also getting\n\na lot of things done due to peer\n\npressure. Lastly, the professorâs realtime interaction with students provides\n\na chance for them to exchange\n\ndoubts, ideas, and views effectively,\n\nthus enabling real-time performance\n\nchecking.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that both\n\nonline, as well as offline learning\n\nplatforms, have their merits as well\n\nas demerits. Regardless, online\n\nlearning is more practical nowadays\n\nas institutes are switching towards it\n\nin the current scenario. In my point of\n\nview, some beneficial factors of online\n\nlearning should be incorporated with\n\nthe existing offline framework as it is\n\nin human nature to disrelish novelty,\n\nso itâs for the best to have the best of\n\nboth worlds. I will leave with a thought\n\nthat âwe should always keep a balance\n\nbetween novelty and familiarityâ.\n\n49 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:50\n\nSanna Showkat\n\n2019BELE010\n\nI took the one less travelled\n\nby, and that has made all the\n\ndifference.\n\n(Robert Frost)\n\nLESSONS LEARNT\n\nTHUS FARâ¦\n\nhen the tide is against you, there is a prevalent belief that you must flow with it.\n\nThe issue here is that you have no control over the direction of your life, which\n\nleads to a state of hopelessness. I was a firm believer in this myth and thought it\n\nwas the best course of action. It hit me really hard when I started contemplating\n\nthe very meaning of my life. It was then that I realized that if you get caught in a tide it only\n\nbrings you to a shark-infested ocean, it becomes irrelevant to go with the flow, and not fighting\n\nto change your fate is pointless. Since then, Iâve made a conscious effort to take control of my life\n\nrather than allowing external events to define the terms. Iâve attempted to share the lessons Iâve\n\nlearned thus far in the âjugglerâ known as life in the content that follows.\n\nâWe should not forget that only the dead fish swims with the stream.â\n\nYOU ARE YOUR OWN BEST FRIEND\n\nAlways make time to speak to yourself, no matter how busy your life is. Give yourself constant\n\npep speeches; this will enhance your confidence and make you feel relevant in this haze known as\n\nsociety. Beyond encouraging self-talk, talking to yourself out loud in an instructive manner helps\n\nimprove problem-solving and task performance cognitive capacities. So, if youâre looking for that\n\nitem in the grocery store that you simply canât seem to find, talking to yourself out loud can help\n\nyou find it faster. It is because of the feedback hypothesis. Remember and respect the fact that\n\nyou began your life alone and will end it alone, so you should never feel inferior or strange.\n\nTRY TO FIND MEANING IN LIFE\n\nConsider your life to be a projectile. Spend some time figuring out what is important in your life\n\nand why it is vital, as an aimless projectile serves no purpose. What do you want to accomplish in\n\nyour life? What are your aspirations? What brings you joy? Your sense of purpose in life provides\n\nyou guidance in how you wish to conduct your life. You will spend the rest of your life aimlessly,\n\nwandering with no direction, concentration, or purpose if you donât find meaning. This is where I\n\nrecall an incident from my sisterâs life, âWhen you have goals, you begin to learn and acquire all\n\nof the relevant talents available.â\n\n50\n\nP:51\n\nMAKE YOUR LIFE A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE THAT YOUâLL REMEMBER AND DONâT FORGET TO SAY, âGOSH! THAT WAS A\n\nRIDE!â\n\nAs I always say to myself, âTake a jump and a net will appear to\n\ncatch you.â This is a reminder that the first step is sometimes the\n\nmost difficult to take, so always remind yourself that once you jump\n\nforward, there will always be a net to keep you in safe havens. Itâs\n\nincredible how a small decision can have such a profound effect\n\non your life. So donât be afraid of falling; simply leap and a net will\n\nappear.\n\nACCEPT YOURSELF\n\nYou are the only one who can make a difference in your life! And in\n\norder to make that transformation, you must first accept yourself as\n\nyou are. There will be times in your life when you will be rejected,\n\nand there will be individuals who donât like you. Accepting and\n\nloving oneself makes it easier to move on in life. You will live a\n\nlife of dissatisfaction and discontent if you constantly put yourself\n\ndown and wish you could be better. Find your courage, embrace\n\nyourself, and take a risk by doing something insane and unheard\n\nof. Remember, this is merely your brain playing a joke on yourself\n\ncalled the âSpotlight Effectâ. Donât worry about what others think\n\nor whether itâs the proper thing to do. If something feels right in\n\nyour heart, act on it and go live the life you want.\n\nQuoting my personal experience, I often would put a lot of\n\npressure on myself for getting everything right and trying to excel\n\nin everything but that was impossible. I wanted to be a âpanto\n\nmathâ but with time I realized I cannot be that. I blamed myself\n\nfor not achieving everything and for not doing things right. And\n\nthen, I would spend days in regret and self-introspection. But one\n\nof my old friendâs advice came to my rescue, which was âDonât try\n\nto be so harsh with yourselfâ. I started to accept things and I read a\n\nlot about self-acceptance. Thatâs when I understood âAcceptance\n\nis the keyâ. People who live in a fantasy world generally fail.\n\nThe greatest approach to live without regret is to live in a state\n\nof awareness, experiencing life with what is happening and\n\nembracing it. It is not acceptable to want something that is not\n\nachievable but accept it nevertheless; people push their emotions\n\nand appear strong or as if everything is normal even though it is\n\nnot, and saying it positivity is not correct.\n\nLIVE LIFE IN THE MOMENT\n\nAs clichÃ©d, as it may sound, living in the now, is a concept that\n\nis simple to understand but difficult to put into practice. We can\n\nbecome so preoccupied with our troubles and dissatisfied with the\n\npresent that we miss out on the unique beauty of the present.\n\nRemember that we only have one life to live, so why not make the\n\nmost of it and make every second count? Youâll defeat a âGenghis\n\nKhanâ-like life problem if you fight every minor war in your head\n\nevery second. Experiencing happiness at the moment involves\n\nappreciating and showing thanks on a daily basis. We experience\n\njoy and satisfaction when we assist those in need. This is what\n\nliving in the now is all about; donât miss out on these opportunities\n\nbecause youâre too preoccupied with your quest for happiness.\n\nFinally, I believe that regression is the most harmful thing you can\n\ndo to yourself. Consider your life to be a game of choices with\n\nan endless number of possible outcomes. If you make a decision,\n\nstick to it and think practically so that if it doesnât work out, you\n\nmay change your mind and break the cycle. Incorporate these\n\nexperiences into your life and learn from them so that you can\n\nalways resist the destructive flow.\n\nâIf youâre insecure and weak enough to go against the tide, guess\n\nwhat?â So is the rest of the world. Do not undervalue yourself and\n\noverestimate the competitors. You are way better than you think\n\nyou are.\n\n51 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:52\n\nMATERIALISM\n\nAND\n\nWORLDLY AFFAIRS\n\nAzlan Rashid Magray\n\n2020BMEC090\n\nhis article discusses how modern times have corrupted human ideology and\n\nbehaviour towards each and every aspect of life. None of the times has witnessed\n\nselfish and materialistic behaviour to the extent that we are facing in these times. This\n\nis indeed an alarming situation and each one of us has to wake up before itâs too late.\n\nWe have a mind-boggling chemical in our brain called âDOPAMINEâ. Our emotions, behaviour,\n\nand sense of pleasure are controlled by the D4 receptor of dopamine. Scientific research has\n\nproven a massive rise in the secretion of dopamine from the last generation to the present one.\n\nIt has risen from 0.1 nmol/L of the last generation to 400 nmol/L of the present one, a massive\n\nincrement of 4000 times. This is the major reason we are witnessing depression patients at\n\na very young age like 14 or 15. Nothing in this world satisfies them and they either become\n\ndruggies or commit suicide. The asset of a society is its youth. 95% of our youth is involved\n\nin individualism. The only thing they can see is the world revolving around themselves. The\n\nselfishness, this sort of socially anxious attitude has done this drastic change in dopamine\n\nsecretion.\n\nWe all are aware of the best scientist to ever walk on the face of this Earth, Isaac Newton. What\n\nis He famous for? Was he a multi-Billionaire? Is He famous for his looks? No, he is famous for\n\nhis discoveries and inventions that made an impact on the lives of billions of people. The entire\n\nworld is benefitted from his mind-blowing work. He worked hard for the betterment and the\n\nbenefit of this society, not for making money and getting fame all around the world. This is the\n\nvision we are lagging in the present-day youth. The lust of making money, being famous allaround social media and the lust of trying each and every latest gadget has put our youth into\n\nthe darkest times. There is no end to these lusts. Let me quote an example that all of us can\n\nfeel. Uploading a photo on a social media platform and getting 1 like on it releases dopamine\n\nequivalent to one sip of marijuana. On uploading another picture there will be an urge of 2\n\nlikes, not getting those 2 likes will put me in anxiety and stress as the level of dopamine is not\n\nmet. This is how it works in other aspects of life. No amount of material wealth can satisfy their\n\nhearts and minds.\n\nAll this is more dangerous to human health than any sort of pandemic or disease. Mental\n\nhealth is above everything. We need to have some awareness programmes, some counseling\n\ncenters, some real motivational speeches to at least decrease this life-threatening issue to\n\nsome extent. Letâs come and work together for this noble cause.\n\n52\n\nP:53\n\nANXIETY\n\nAND\n\nDEPRESSION\n\nUzma Iftiykhar Wani\n\n2020BCIV018\n\nhis line is a clear-cut solution in itself. People suffering\n\nfrom anxiety and depression should read this and\n\ntheir illness should be cured. Is that the case? Is there\n\nsomeone in your midst who was suffering from this illness\n\nand was told not to worry and get better? If you feel so, you are\n\nsadly mistaken. It is equivalent to saying to a person with a broken\n\nleg that he needs to cheer up and itâs all in his head.\n\nDepression is a mental disorder where you donât care about\n\nanything and as a result, you are tired of the world for no\n\nreason. And anxiety, on the other hand, is caring way too much\n\nunnecessarily. Now having depression and anxiety â a blend of\n\nit is like going through âsomething.â Itâs like fighting a war inside\n\nyour head where you are your enemy. Mental pain makes you\n\nexhausted more than any other pain. Its repercussions are grave.\n\nEverything seems colorless, it feels like life has been sucked out\n\nof everything, you are drained beyond imagination and the worst\n\nthing of all is that you canât get it out. You are afraid and skeptical\n\nwhether anyone would get what you are trying to convey. So as a\n\nresult, you keep everything to yourself and keep on suffering and\n\nthe pain only worsens. When youâre anxious, you canât breathe,\n\nyour chest tightens, you want to vent out but it feels like the pain is\n\nconsuming you from inside and itâs getting the better side of you.\n\nThis is just a glimpse of what a person suffering from anxiety and\n\ndepression must be going through. Trust me, this is just a drop\n\nfrom the ocean of emotions they are going through. You actually\n\ncanât explain what exact complications you are facing and thatâs\n\nwhy you need someone, anyone who can help you out.\n\nReminiscent of death, pain is inevitable. Anyone can be going\n\nthrough anxiety and depression, but it is up to the person whether\n\nor not he/she will choose to suffer. Nevertheless, we live in a world\n\nwhere it is easier to say that you have a stomach ache than when\n\nyou are going through depression. I fail to understand the criteria\n\nyou need to fulfill to be ill. Why this infringement? The world is\n\nmoving towards a change but our society is still dilly-dallying.\n\nYouâd come across people who donât know what mental health\n\nactually means. Youâll also come across people who will look down\n\nupon people with mental issues. We ought to get it into our heads\n\nthat depression and anxiety donât mean an unsound mind. These\n\nare just cruel diseases that affect the mind. The world needs to\n\ndevelop a mindset where everyone is allowed to be messed up and\n\nhas the right to treatment, without being called an exaggerator.\n\nTherapy should be normalized as a necessity, not a luxury.\n\nWhen the eerie black clouds descend, a wind will strike and make\n\nthem vanish eventually. You just need to give it a head start. You\n\nare bent, but you are not broken. Thereâs light inside of you. All\n\nyou need to do is embrace it. Talk to someone, donât bottle up\n\nyour emotions, and donât pretend to be okay. Itâs okay to not be\n\nokay. The sun will shine bright on you, despite the dark night you\n\nhad. Having superpowers is easy but it takes courage to be a\n\nhuman being. Be tender of yourself. Instead, adore your delicate\n\nimperfections.

You matter and it only gets better\n\nonce you get better.\n\nâWorrying does not empty tomorrow\n\nof its sorrows,\n\nit empties today of its strengths.â\n\n53 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:54\n\nTHE\n\nPERFECTIONIST\n\nSheikh Mohommad Wasif\n\n2018BCHE006\n\nhe computer revolution that occurred during the 1980s\n\nsaw the emergence of various big companies like\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, etc., all of which\n\nhave shaped human lives and control a mass amount of\n\npopularity. We all know that those who built these companies were\n\nexceptionally genius as they broke common norms and opted for\n\nsomething different than what society intended for them. These\n\npeople, what we now call entrepreneurs, are a beacon of hope for\n\nnew generations.\n\nAmong these great achievers was Steve Jobs. Although adopted\n\nand a dropout, Jobs managed to build not just one but three big\n\ncompanies, two of which have been a hallmark for the rest. Yes, I\n\nam talking about Apple and Pixar, your daily hardware driver and\n\ncontent creator. Jobs had an exceptional personality, to what his\n\nclose colleagues coined as Jobs distortion field. As a child, Jobs was\n\ninterested more in electronics and he and his friend Steve Wozniak\n\nused to build little circuit boards. Although Wozniak was the technical\n\nhead, Job was the one who used to market it. Before college Jobs\n\nwas shy but later on adapted to being bossy and influencing.\n\nAlthough Jobs was enrolled in Reedâs College, he dropped out\n\npretty quickly. At college, he made some new friends that enhanced\n\nhis business skills and he got to learn certain calligraphic skills. But\n\nJobs was looking for something different. From living in a rented\n\napartment and sometimes having very little to spend, he tapped the\n\nidea of making a perfect set of computers and with his friend Steve\n\nWozniak started Apple from his parentâs garage.\n\nInitially, named Apple Computers, Steve made some extremely\n\nexciting computers that quickly gained popularity among the young\n\ngenerations. Steve Jobs was obsessed with perfection. His every\n\nproduct whether it be his first Macintosh or a Mac-Book was carved out\n\nfrom Jobsâ perfectionist view. He was the one to break the rules and\n\nunder his leadership Apple for the first time brought GUI (Graphical\n\nUser Interface) to the computer industry. Although GUI was not\n\noriginally an Apple innovation, Jobs with his witty instincts brought\n\na revolution in the computer industry. Later on, many companies like\n\nMicrosoft followed the path. Later in his career, Jobs was fired from\n\nApple for being too bossy. Jobs felt a punch to his stomach as he\n\nwas betrayed by the same family he had built from scrap. But Jobs\n\ncontinued his journey, to what he recalled as âJoining the Dotsâ\n\nand went on to form two new organizations, Next and Pixar. As he\n\nstruggled with his new entrepreneurial adventure, Apple computers\n\ndidnât fare well too. At Apple, sales decreased and many critics saw\n\nit as an end to Appleâs domination over the computer industry. As\n\nthe last move, Apple bought âNextâ and brought Jobs back into the\n\ncompany. During the same time, Pixar had partnered with Disney\n\nand released its first animated movie using the high-end technology\n\nJobs had built during his âNextâ adventure. After that, there was no\n\nturning back for Steve Jobs. Jobs worked very hard to rebuild Apple\n\nand simultaneously supervised Pixar movie production. Apple under\n\nhis leadership went to build iMac, iPod, iTunes, and later on iPhones.\n\nJobs also supervised some great blockbusters like Toy Story, Cars,\n\nFinding Nemo, all of which have broken box office records. Pixar was\n\nlater bought by Disney making Jobs one of the highest shareholders\n\nof Disney. As Jobs was fighting cancer, he simultaneously saw the\n\nmarketing and production of iPhones and iPads, and later on when\n\nhe was no longer fit to work, he recommended Tim Cook to be\n\nmade CEO of Apple Inc.\n\nSteve Jobs is regarded as one of the finest tech-revolutionists as he\n\nshaped the computer industry during the early 80s and 90s. It is his\n\ngenome that Apple still follows and has incorporated into itself by\n\nmaking one of the best products and services one could ever get\n\nin the tech industry. Itâs said âSteve Jobs never died, he still lives\n\nin every Apple product people useâ and it is his legacy that Apple\n\nfollows strictly.\n\nby making one of the best products and services one could ever get\n\nin the tech industry. Itâs said âSteve Jobs never died, he still lives\n\nin every Apple product people useâ and it is his legacy that Apple\n\nfollows strictly.\n\n54\n\nP:55\n\nMunazzah\n\n2020BELE053\n\nSIMPLICITY\n\nA PART OF FAITH\n\nimplicity is a word that itself reflects its beauty. Simplicity\n\nis one of the characteristics of Islam. It is an attribute of a\n\nbeliever. It is a very important virtue of Islam. Simplicity is\n\nthe key to our religion. We should implement simplicity in\n\nevery matter of our life. Our beloved Prophet Mohammed (Peace\n\nbe upon him) stresses us to live our lives simply and easily. Living a\n\nsimple life is an easy and better solution for worldly worries. When we\n\ngive preference to a simple living, then we are not involved in living\n\nup to societyâs expectations. Our main focus must be our Lord and\n\nhis teachings, not the opinions of other people. If we live with this\n\nmindset that what other people would think about us, we will waste\n\nevery minute of our precious time. What society will think or say is\n\nnot our concern. We should not worry about others, rather we should\n\nthink of living a simple life. Living a simple life can make us feel calmer\n\nand less stressed. This is the reason why most of the people in the\n\npresent era feel depressed and stressed because they live their lives\n\naccording to the expectations of others.\n\nWhen we live a simple life it ensures us that we are grateful for each\n\nblessing that Allah has granted us. In simple lives, we think about the\n\nblessings of the Almighty like our family, our homes, and the food we\n\nare blessed with. In normal lives, we didnât notice these blessings.\n\nHowever, the more we will realize and consider these blessings, the\n\nmore we get to know how merciful our Lord is.\n\nWe should always keep this faith in our mind that this materialistic\n\nworld is temporary and when we remember this thing we will always\n\ntry to live a simple life and we will avoid expecting things from this\n\nmaterialistic world and its materialism.\n\nThere are a lot of benefits in living a simple life and one of them is\n\nthat our physical health will never get affected because we will avoid\n\nstressing about such a life which puts us under unended pressure.\n\nThis world is full of stress. It keeps adding miseries and problems to\n\nour lives that we sometimes feel like ending our lives by opting for an\n\nevil like suicide.\n\nConfidence is another virtue of living a simple life because we never\n\ncompare ourselves with others and we\n\nwill know our self-worth. We detach\n\nourselves from the expectations of what\n\nsuccess means in society. We should\n\nlearn to understand the meaning\n\nof success in this world. Success\n\ndoesnât live in hoarding money.\n\nSuccess doesnât mean holding\n\na great job. Success doesnât\n\nmean having fancy things in\n\nlife. Being successful is being\n\ncontent. Being successful is\n\nbeing happy. Being successful\n\nis being healthy. You should\n\nnever try to compare success\n\nwith having worldly pleasures.\n\nIf we donât live life in a\n\nsimple way, things will get\n\ncomplicated and this will\n\nlead us towards the chains of\n\nmaterialism. Our focus will shift\n\nfrom a God-oriented life to a\n\nmaterial existence. Living life\n\naccording to the ways of God is\n\nliving a simple and successful life.\n\nCreating a narrow space for yourself\n\nout of the material life is what makes\n\nus the slave of others and this world.\n\nIf your life adopts simplicity as a factor\n\nto live peacefully, your faith is an easy task\n\nfor you. If you are shackled by the desires of this\n\nworld, it indeed becomes difficult to attain your faith.\n\nLet your prayers lead your life and raise your status in front of our\n\nLord, not in front of people.\n\n55 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:56\n\nental illness circumscribes all those conditions which\n\nhave a direct or indirect impact on the brain of a person.\n\nSince the brain is an organ where all the thought\n\nprocessing occurs, any defect in the brain alters a\n\npersonâs way of thinking and behavior. Like every other organ in\n\nour body, the brain is also one of the organs of our body. And\n\nsometimes, the organs of our body become afflicted with diseases\n\nand we visit the doctors who specialize in that particular organ\n\nand get ourselves treated at the earliest. But when it comes to\n\nthe brain - the organ which suffers during various mental illnesses,\n\nwhy does our attention become indifferent? Why are we reluctant\n\nto visit a psychiatrist? Why donât we disclose when our dear ones\n\nsuffer from any psychiatric illness? Why do we let them suffer? The\n\nsole answer that I can offer for all the questions that I posed above\n\nis âSocial Tabooâ. In our societies that claim themselves to be\n\nmodern, psychiatric illness is considered taboo.\n\nOurs is a fast, technology-laced generation and so our workload\n\noften burdens us and we happen to succumb to various mental\n\nconditions like Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorders,\n\nbipolar disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression,\n\nmood disorders, eating disorders, and many more. One of the\n\nmost common mental disorders is an anxiety disorder which is\n\nan umbrella term including many disorders: Generalized anxiety\n\ndisorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic\n\ndisorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Social anxiety\n\ndisorder. All these disorders are curable, if not curable at least\n\nthere are ways that can alleviate the severity of symptoms and a\n\npatient can live a normal life.\n\nThe root cause of this taboo is an age-old stereotype that people\n\nhave had been associating with these disorders. In our valley, when\n\nsomeone starts to yell, starts prophesying, does things that are not\n\nexpected of a normal human being, our simplest solution to this\n\nstumbling block is a religious and spiritual leader. We assume on\n\nour own that this abnormal behavior of the person must be because\n\nof an evil eye, black magic, etc. I do not deny the existence of\n\nsuch things but these solutions may not always help and can put\n\na person in serious jeopardy. A proper check-up by a psychiatrist\n\ncan do wonders. Sometimes, even a conversation, counseling,\n\nand cognitive therapies prove very beneficial, let alone medicines.\n\nThey have the specialization, knowledge, and experience of all\n\nsuch disorders. They might act as angels in hauling your dear ones\n\nfrom the dark looming clouds brimming with mental sickness. Dear\n\nfriends, what is stopping us? Who is stopping us? We are often\n\nreluctant in getting better treatment for such disorders because we\n\nthink what people will say if they see us visiting a mental hospital;\n\nwhat a shame it will bring? We will be looked down upon, our\n\nrelatives, neighbors, and friends will sever their ties with us. This\n\ntaboo is especially worse for females, yet another form of gender\n\nbias. When an unmarried woman suffers from this illness, her illness\n\nin no case is let out. This disorder of hers is kept cryptic just because\n\nher parents fear that nobody will marry their girl if somehow, they\n\ncame to know of her mental illness. She is being locked in a room\n\nso that no one will be able to witness her abnormal behavior\n\nwhich will otherwise cause them to answer a series of questions.\n\nBorderline personality disorder, historically and even presently, is\n\na disorder that has met with widespread misunderstanding due to\n\nsurplus stigma. We should learn that we are answerable to none\n\nother than our creator. Moreover, mental illness is not a sin and\n\na person suffering from it is not a sinner. So, there should be no\n\nplace for indifference and anathema for such patients. Anyone can\n\nbe a victim of this disease at any time. So, we ought not to ridicule\n\nanyone suffering from the same disorder. Marriage is not more\n\nimportant than the life of a person. Our life is our greatest gift.\n\nWe canât control death, which is so inevitable but we can make\n\nNoesheena Zaffar\n\n56\n\nP:57\n\nmuch of our life by means of love. Concern and\n\ncare for the ones suffering from mental illness is\n\nthe best manifestation of oneâs love. Let us not\n\ndeprive our dear ones of this beautiful token of\n\nlove. Come on! Letâs think and ponder for a while,\n\nare these really the reasons which should halt our\n\nsteps moving towards a psychiatrist? Are these\n\nlame, filthy excuses more important than the life\n\nand health of our dear ones? I do believe our\n\nanswer will always be a big âNoâ. We are taught\n\nfrom our childhood that if wealth is lost, nothing\n\nis lost; if health is lost something is lost and if the\n\ncharacter is lost, everything is lost. We have an\n\nopportunity, where we can save ourselves and\n\nothers from losing this something, so why not avail\n\nourselves of this favour? Why not reap the fruits of\n\ntechnology and knowledge that comes in addition\n\nto all those burdens of the modern age? We have\n\nall the resources, we have all the expertise, but\n\nit is just our mindset that keeps us away from its\n\nbenefits. Letâs change our mindset, letâs break the\n\nage-old stereotypes which come in our way and\n\nstop us from helping our dear ones.\n\nWe donât become modern by following the latest\n\nfashion trends; we become modern in a real sense\n\nwhen we modernize our thoughts towards a better\n\ndirection. We say that person is rich just on the\n\npecuniary basis, but we need to question; Has this\n\nperson got rich thoughts enough to fill the poor,\n\nempty brains? Letâs normalize mental illness. The\n\nbrain is an organ just like other organs in a body.\n\nIn fact, the brain is a superior organ not because\n\nit is positioned on top of our body forming a\n\ncrown and declaring Kinghood; but because it is\n\nour brain that controls everything that our body\n\ndoes. It orchestrates various processes occurring\n\nin our body. So, this organ not only demands cure\n\nand attention when sick, but it calls for extra care\n\nand concern, it being the master of the body. Our\n\nbody follows our brain which is a hub where our\n\nthoughts are weaved. We hit the gym because we\n\nwant our bodies to be strong. Which exercise are\n\nwe doing to ensure the health and strength of our\n\nbrain? It too demands attention. Mental peace is\n\nwhat our generation is lacking and what it aspires\n\nfor.\n\nWhen we are mentally ill, we end up altering our\n\nbehaviour, thinking, and mood. Sometimes, it\n\nbecomes difficult for the sufferer and others to\n\neven diagnose the disorder. Mental illness is not\n\nvisible in most cases like other diseases. As such,\n\nthe sufferer is not given any liberty, not given\n\nany sick leave, not given any care. This can be\n\novercome by analyzing behaviour of persons we\n\ntalk to on a daily basis. If their behaviour appears\n\naltered or abnormal in the slightest possible way,\n\nwe should consult a specialist and prevent any\n\nseverity later.\n\nIn the book Homo Dues, Yuval Noah Harari\n\nmentions that more suicides are being committed\n\nin developed countries than developing countries.\n\nThis somehow shows comfort and money does not\n\nensure true peace to oneâs mind. Peace of mind\n\nhas nothing to do with money. You might not be\n\nhaving a single penny in your pocket but you might\n\nbe having peace of mind which actually counts in\n\noneâs happiness. We should not devalue our life by\n\ncommitting suicide. Prior to such thoughts, visit a\n\npsychiatrist. You will surely be benefited because\n\nsuicidal thoughts are not a manifestation of a\n\nhealthy mind and so I consider it to be no different\n\nfrom a mental illness. The people with this illness\n\nsuffer in sheer silence and they do guard their\n\nreputation for sanity. Kindly, understand their\n\nstruggle.\n\nOne thing that often wounds me is whenever\n\npeople say the word âMental hospital.â This word\n\nin itself feels so horrible, let alone the disease and\n\ntreatment. Not everyone that visits this place is a\n\nmad or mental person. Some disorders are too\n\nmild to be compared to madness. Letâs not be\n\nharsh to sufferers of this kind. We have learned\n\nsome etiquettes, like, we no more say maid, we\n\nnow say domestic help. This is humbler, isnât it?\n\nLetâs learn one more etiquette, stop saying mental\n\nhospital and start saying psychiatric hospital,\n\nsounds humbler, isnât it?\n\nOur country is progressing in ample sectors\n\nand we want it to reach the zenith of success.\n\nThis would be ensured when we have a strong\n\ngeneration with healthy brains. It all starts there\n\nin that distally positioned head. Letâs make brain\n\nhealth a priority. Letâs efface all the taboos, let\n\nus break the stereotypes and rise above such\n\nnugatory forces which halt our progress, which\n\nthreatens our survival, and most importantly which\n\ndiminishes our peace of mind.\n\nJust a closing thought by Bill Clinton that should\n\nclose all the doors promoting mental illness\n\nassociated taboo:\n\nâMental illness is nothing to be ashamed of but stigma and\n\nbias shame us all.â\n\n57 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:58\n\neminism is undeniably the most misunderstood concept around the globe. People\n\nignorant of feminism grow aversion towards it, as they fear feminism will deprive men of\n\ntheir control and economic opportunities and lead to women being vulgar and uncivil.\n\nRegrettably, even people who preach feminism to others, sometimes lose the thread. It is\n\nquite unfortunate that most people are angrier at imperfect feminism than they are at systematic\n\nmisogyny.\n\nFeminism is just a belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. At its\n\ncore, feminism is about equality of men and women but not âsamenessâ as most people offer\n\nup the argument that women are not the âsameâ as men, as their bodies are built differently.\n\nIgnoramus people with such a mindset believe that strength should be the unit of human rights,\n\nhowever, these people or as one could call them âhypocritesâ fail to show this prejudice between\n\ntwo men if one of them were to be faint-hearted or frail.\n\nMen, who from a young age are inculcated with gender roles, develop low regard for the opposite\n\ngender. Boys from an early age are taught to be strong and bullheaded. They are not allowed to\n\ncry or express their emotions. While, girls are instructed to be good-looking and submissive. Girls\n\nare tamed and tutored, time and again which not only crushes their self-esteem but also fills them\n\nup with insecurities.\n\nVictim blaming, sexist comments, wage gaps, harassment and rapes, female infanticide, and\n\ndomestic violence are some other follow-ups of a society without feminism. A lot of people today\n\nthink that feminism has gone toxic but I believe that women have been put down for so long that\n\nSyed Baseerat Shah\n\n2020BCIV017\n\nI re b el , therefore I a m...\n\nNo country can ever truly flourish if it\n\nstifles the potential of its women and\n\ndeprives itself of the contributions of half\n\nof its citizens.\n\nMichelle Obama\n\n58\n\nP:59\n\nwe need to go a little bit extreme towards the opposite direction because otherwise,\n\nmen arenât going to meet us in the middle. Moreover, centuries-old misogyny that\n\nhas manifested in patriarchy, belittling of women, and what not â more than enough\n\nreasons for the blood to boil, give rise to voices for equality; that is referred by toxic\n\nmasculinity as the âmisuse of feminismâ.\n\nWomen need to stand up for themselves and others need to stand alongside them.\n\nWomen need to have the freedom of choice and that is what feminism is all about.\n\nOnly by acknowledging this will we be able to create a better world. We need to teach\n\nour young girls to be strongly opinionated, demand respect, and leave the table when\n\nit no longer is being served. Every person needs to be a feminist because it is the only\n\nway to maintain balance in humanity. We need feminism because gender roles are\n\ndreadful and dowry still burns down families. I need feminism because I do not need\n\nto be âfair and lovelyâ and it is impossible to achieve unrealistic standards of beauty\n\nset by our society. I need feminism because I canât walk down the street alone at dusk.\n\nI need feminism because I am a human and deserve to be treated as one.\n\n59 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:60\n\napier mÃ¢chÃ© is a handicraft of Kashmir\n\nthat is used to make decorative\n\narchitecture using paper pulp. This\n\ncraft mainly originated in Iran and\n\nwas brought along to Kashmir by the Muslim\n\ncraftsmen accompanying Mir Syed Ali Hamdani\n\n(ra), who spread Islam across Kashmir in the late\n\n14th century. These craftsmen were also wellversed in other handicrafts like woodcarving,\n\ncopper engraving, and carpet weaving. PapiermÃ¢chÃ© was formally introduced in Kashmir in the\n\n15th century by Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin Budshah,\n\nwho encouraged the local youth to learn the\n\ncraft from Persian artists. Thus, it later became\n\nthe main occupation of the people of Kashmir.\n\nPapier-mÃ¢chÃ© is based primarily on paper pulp,\n\nwhich is attractively coloured and designed,\n\nmostly in the form of vases, bowls, cups, lamp\n\nbases, boxes, trays, bangles, and many such small\n\nobjects. This craft was also used for many items\n\nsuch as tables, tableware, plaques, screens, and\n\ncabinets. Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© handicraft, along with\n\nbeing used to make specific decorated items,\n\nwas also crafted on layers of polished paper,\n\nor smoothly finished surfaces created by using\n\npaper pulp. The Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© work was also\n\napplied on wood to make pillars, ceilings, and\n\nwalls. It can be seen in the Madin Sahib Mosque,\n\nadjacent to our school. This mosque was built in\n\nthe year 1444 A.D. This work can also be seen\n\nat the ceiling of Shah Hamdan Mosque and\n\nthe Shalimar garden, both located in the city of\n\nSrinagar.\n\nThis tradition of using Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© continues\n\nto be in practice even today. It serves as the\n\nmain source of income to the lower-middleclass families of the society. Papier-mÃ¢chÃ©\n\nitems are made by the artists in their homes\n\nand workshops, in Srinagar and other parts\n\nof the valley. The artists sell their handiworks\n\nto wealthier businessmen, who later sell\n\nthem at a larger commercial scale. These are\n\nmarketed primarily within India, although there\n\nis a significant export value in the international\n\nmarket. Sadly the artists themselves get little\n\nvalue for their goods and mostly live hand-tomouth.\n\nOne of my neighbors, name withheld, is a PapiermÃ¢chÃ© artist. He is mostly sitting at his home,\n\ncrafting Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© items. He spends most\n\nof his time working, but still earns a very little\n\namount of money. He owns a small one-story\n\nhouse and has one son and three daughters.\n\nWhen I recently asked him about his profession\n\nand income, he said, âI have been in this\n\nprofession since I was 18 years old. I learned this\n\ncraft from my father. He was a known artist back\n\nthen. It has been 36 years since then. But lately I\n\nhave become tired of it. I face many difficulties.\n\nI have more workload and very less income. I\n\nhardly afford two meals a day for my family. I\n\nhave three daughters who are yet to be married.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? â. When asked about\n\nhow he sold his products, he replied, âI sell my\n\nproducts to some local businessmen at a bargain\n\nprice. I cannot sell them directly in the market\n\nSyed Aga Hadi Riza\n\n2018BECE002\n\nPapier-MÃ¢chÃ©\n\nTHE DYING ART\n\n60\n\nP:61\n\nbecause I donât have a shop, and nor do I have the capital to get a shop on rent.\n\nI am helpless, having no option but to sell my handiworks to these businessmen\n\nat a cheap rate.â When asked whether he wanted his son to pursue his profession,\n\nhe wailed, âNot at all, I would never want my son in this profession. I would rather\n\nprefer him begging than being a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© artistâ. When asked about what they\n\nwould require to have a better life, he answered, âIf we could sell our goods directly\n\nto the customer. If only we could have some money to set up a shop or a factory. The\n\ngovernment gives out loans and all, but it hardly helps the needy. It only helps the rich\n\npeople. If only we could get a normal respectable life, I would have been satisfied.â\n\nThis is the case of one of the many Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© artists of the valley, who can hardly\n\nmake their ends meet. They face many difficulties and major hardships. Thus, they\n\ndiscourage their children from taking it up as a profession. As a result, the art of\n\nPapier-mÃ¢chÃ© is decreasing day by day. And there is a distinct possibility that this\n\ncraft will become extinct very soon.\n\nSo, as such, there is a dire need to preserve this craft at all costs. The\n\ngovernment has taken up the initiative by protecting the artists under\n\nthe Geographic Indication Act 1999 of the Government of India.\n\nThese handicrafts have been registered by the Controller\n\nGeneral of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks during the\n\nperiod from April 2011 to March 2012 under the title\n\nâKashmir Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© â. The state government has also\n\nset up J&K Arts Emporiums all over the country. Lately,\n\nit has even been included as a curriculum subject in\n\nschools.\n\nDespite these efforts by the government, more needs\n\nto be done at an individual as well as collective level.\n\nThere needs to be general awareness among the masses.\n\nThe artists should be given more protection. The artists\n\nshould be given loans or should be rented shops for less\n\nmoney. They should get the publicity they deserve. More\n\nproducerâcustomer interactions should be encouraged. In a\n\nnutshell, all the efforts need to be put in place in order to\n\nsave this art, to save our culture.\n\nPaper-machie was formally\n\nintroduced in\n\nKashmir in the 15th century by\n\nSultan Zain-ul-Abidin Budshah\n\n61 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:62\n\nKing Midas wishes for the transformation of everything he touches into gold.\n\nWhen he touches his daughter, she transforms into gold. When he touches his\n\nfood, it turns to gold. This is a lesson taught in many myths that tells us that if\n\nwe want to develop a highly successful optimization process to maximize any\n\nobjective, we must ensure that our description encompasses everything we care about.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the science of making machines intelligent. It is the technology\n\nof the future that is going to revolutionize how we live. We have seen it in movies,\n\nwe have fantasized about it, and we have read books about it. In fact, for the last\n\n100 years or so, these two words put together make everybody feel amazing.\n\nSome feel it will really enhance their lives, some feel it is the final frontier while\n\nsome call it the Holy Grail. The growth of artificial intelligence over the years has\n\nprofound implications, particularly when it comes to questions of power and this\n\nis what you will come across through this essay.\n\nOnce there is superintelligence, humanityâs fate may be determined by how the\n\nsuperintelligence acts. Machines will then be better than humans at innovating, and they\n\nwill do so on digital timelines. This essentially amounts to a telescoping of the future.\n\nConsider all of the insane technologies that you might have believed humans could have\n\ncreated in the fullness of time: a cure for aging, colonization of space, self-replicating\n\nnanobots, or uploading of human minds into computers, and other science fiction-y things\n\nthat are inconsistent with the laws of physics. There is a great possibility that all such things\n\ncould be developed by a superintelligence, and it could happen quickly. A superintelligence\n\npossessing such technological maturity would be tremendously strong, and it would not be\n\ndifficult for it to achieve any of its goals. We humans would therefore live in a future fashioned\n\nby the desires of this A.I. Imagine we assign an AI the task of making humans smile. When the\n\nAI is weak, it does useful or humorous things that make the user grin. When the AI becomes\n\nsuper clever, it learns that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal: take over the\n\nglobe and implant electrodes into human face muscles to produce perpetual, beaming grins.\n\nOne could argue that if a computer started poking electrodes into peopleâs faces, we would\n\njust turn it off. This is not always easy to do if we have grown dependent on the system, for\n\nexample, where is the internetâs off switch?\n\nMACHINES USING\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nCan Become a Threat to Human Society\n\n62\n\nP:63\n\nScientists have warned that rapid advances in AI development will\n\nresult in unemployment. Humans will be replaced by intelligent\n\nmachines in all sectors of the economy. This is because machines\n\nwill be able to outperform humans in the execution of many\n\nactivities. Consider what would happen if the unemployment\n\nrate rose from its current levels. Poverty, starvation, illiteracy,\n\ndependency, crime, and life expectancy would all rise, among\n\nother things. AI has made a lot of people redundant; there is no\n\ngoing away from it. AI and robotics put together have the potential\n\nto completely destroy economies and jobs. With even 10% better\n\nAI, 700 categories of jobs will be made redundant. Every manual\n\nlabor job will be redundant. Most thinking jobs will be redundant.\n\nConsider the possibility that Artificial Intelligence is in charge of\n\nthings like weaponry and weapon control systems. This would\n\nimply that they are capable of attacking a variety of targets without\n\nthe assistance of humans. This might lead to the emergence of\n\na global weapons race, which would be exceedingly disastrous.\n\nSophisticated systems are reliant in todayâs modern civilization,\n\nwhich are prone to collapse in unforeseen and complex ways.\n\nNuclear power reactors may melt, deepwater oil wells may blow\n\nout, requiring an extended period of time to be resealed, and\n\nrockets may explode. Intelligent machines are also prone to failure\n\nin a variety of capacities.\n\nScientists and technologists have expressed their concerns about\n\nthis issue. Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, has expressed\n\nhis concerns about AI on several occasions. According to\n\nhim, there is a greater reason to be concerned about the issue\n\nbecause it will have a greater detrimental influence on humanity\n\nthan most people expect. Stephen Hawking, a cosmologist and\n\ntheoretical physicist has also warned of the impending dangers\n\nthat will result from the use of AI in\n\nweapon development. Elon Musk\n\nconsiders artificial intelligence to be\n\nan âexistential concern.â A philosopher\n\nnamed Nick Bostrom has written a\n\nbook in which he explains how and why\n\nartificial intelligence is catastrophically\n\ndestructive to humankind. This is just\n\na small sample of those who believe\n\nAI poses a threat to humans. These\n\nfolks are well-informed on science and\n\ntechnology, and their opinions should\n\nnot be dismissed.\n\nAI is a threat to humanity, and\n\nthe sooner people adopt this\n\nviewpoint, the better the odds\n\nof discovering ways to keep\n\nAI from making human life\n\nunpleasant. We should\n\nnot become slaves to\n\nAI. Instead, we should\n\nregulate AI, making\n\nsure that we reduce its\n\npotential to destroy\n\nthe entire mankind.\n\nThis will be a favor\n\nthat we will be\n\ndoing to ourselves\n\nas well as our future\n\ngenerations.\n\nPrabh Karan Singh Jolly\n\n2020BMEC063\n\n63 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:64\n\nith the emergence of Coronavirus, the\n\nworld witnessed many drastic changes\n\nin its different structures. It changed\n\nour lives in such a manner that we had\n\nnever imagined. It was a mere nightmare for us. It has\n\nbeen more than a year now living under such miserable\n\ncircumstances. Covid-19 affected each one of us in its own\n\nway. On the Global level, it affected the economic sector\n\nmostly, closed many industries, many businesses, and\n\nwhatnot. The students for that matter are the ones who\n\nsuffered the most. They are the ones who have to face\n\nnew challenges every now and then. And because of this\n\ngrowing mental pressure, we are observing an increase in\n\nthe anxiety and depression cases now among students.\n\nDue to the advent of the pandemic, the teaching process\n\nwitnessed a major change. It witnessed a shift from the\n\nreal mode to the virtual one. Everything whether classes,\n\nexaminations, webinars, etc. paved its way through the\n\nvirtual mode. Although school-going kids were made\n\nto adjust with the ongoing norm for the college-going\n\nstudents, it was not an easy task to abide by, observing a\n\ndrastic change in their ongoing schedule. This is the age\n\nwhere a student yearns for exposure, to get familiar with\n\nnew things, to indulge in different activities, and to study\n\nhard in order to make a worthy career. Unfortunately, all\n\nthese valuable things were put to an end by this very virus.\n\nAnd thus, students had to accept the unacceptable norm\n\nof online learning. As there is a considerable amount\n\nof difference between face-to-face learning and online\n\nlearning, the very first problem faced by the students is\n\nlack of concentration. As we know that mobile phones\n\nbecame the medium and the most reliable source for\n\nonline education, so it is very difficult for the students to\n\nconcentrate through the very same medium that was a\n\nmere distraction for them prior to online teaching. One\n\neasily loses concentration and thus anxiety increases by\n\nover thinking and that is why a person is not able to focus\n\nin the same way as in the real mode.\n\nAnother cause for the growing anxiety is the online exams\n\nitself. As, in offline exams, one is willing to give his best in\n\norder to score well and thus one prepares in a strategically\n\nprofound manner but on the contrary, in the online\n\nexamination one faces many challenges as in whether to\n\nkeep oneâs conscience or go with the flow.\n\nAlso, with the implementation of the lockdown, academic\n\npressure led to its peak. As there is no other activity to\n\ndo, all the time gets consumed in all this stuff. Thus, one\n\nis not able to handle this much pressure due to which we\n\nnowadays observe a lot of suicides or suicidal attempts\n\ncoming up. College is the place where a person can\n\ncomprehend the new challenges as he meets his friends,\n\ninteracts face to face with the teachers, performs different\n\nactivities due to which for a glimpse of time he/she can\n\nescape from his sorrows. But due to the lockdown one is\n\nall alone and is not able to escape from what is bothering\n\nhim.\n\nThus, I strongly believe that there should be a balance\n\nin everything. If there is no stability then one thing gets\n\ndominant over the other. So, students should try to create\n\na balance between their academics and their personal\n\nspace. As we are stuck in this condition, we should try\n\nour level best to face it and thus not let the ghosts of\n\nanxiety or depression haunt us anymore. We canât let it\n\nruin our beautiful life to such an extent that we would\n\nfind ourselves in a cage with the key of happiness lost\n\nsomewhere in the dark.\n\nThe writer is pursuing\n\nB. A (Honors) in English Literature from\n\nCluster University, Srinagar\n\nHurmat Altaf\n\n[email protected] INCREASING ANXIETY\n\nAmong Students During Lockdown\n\n64\n\nP:65\n\nomeone has rightly said that\n\nâStudents are the future\n\nof the nation.â In India, the\n\nstudent decides his/her career\n\nafter the 10+2 level. There are many\n\ncareer options such as Engineering,\n\nmedicine, law, economics, etc. Most\n\nstudents go for that career option\n\nthat their parents compel them to\n\nand donât care about their genuine\n\ninterest. How can a student excel in\n\nthe study if he is not fascinated with\n\nthe subject? According to a recent\n\nreport, most of the students in India go\n\nto the engineering (Civil) branch, and I\n\nam also one among the whole mass.\n\nI would be discussing the academic\n\nscenario of my area, which I think\n\nwould apply to most of the fields.\n\nCivil engineering is one of the most\n\nexciting branches to study, only if\n\nwe can relate it to the things around\n\nus, such as roads, buildings, bridges\n\nto railways, airports to tunnels, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, what is taught inside\n\nthe four walls of the classroom is\n\nthousands of formulae, equations,\n\ntons of theory, and mathematics.\n\nThe only thing they forget to teach\n\nus is how this knowledge applies to\n\nthe outside world of the classroom.\n\nThe education system should give\n\nsuch an academic environment to\n\nthe faculty and the students that they\n\nare able to apply their expertise and\n\nknowledge in the real world. It should\n\nenable teachers to bond with students\n\nand aid learning. Students should be\n\nencouraged to raise questions. What\n\nis taught in the classrooms should be\n\nrelated to real life problems. Students\n\nshould be at the center of an education\n\nsystem instead of the faculty, the\n\nadministration and the curriculum. The\n\nsystem should enhance our critical\n\nthinking ability, inculcating a strong\n\ndesire for learning and exploring new\n\nideas and techniques.\n\nEach student is a flower and every\n\nflower adds beauty to the garden.\n\nEvery flower is beautiful in its own\n\nway. You canât say Rose is better\n\nthan Hibiscus both have their own\n\nproperties, color etc. Each flower has\n\na different requirement to attain its\n\nbeauty. Similarly, each student needs\n\nto be approached differently to attain\n\nhis/her full potential. Itâs well said that\n\nâComparison is a thief of joyâ by\n\nTheodore Roosevelt. As one flower\n\ncanât be compared with another, the\n\nsame holds good for a student.\n\nNote: Itâs my personal experience and\n\nmay vary\n\nNuman Khurshid\n\n2020MCIVST011\n\nEducational\n\nsystem\n\n65 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:66\n\nKhazran Khan\n\nCO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\n\n& Engineering Students\n\no-curricular activities play a vital\n\nrole in the lives of students. But\n\nwhen it comes to engineering\n\nundergraduates, it takes a secondary\n\nplace in their busy schedule. Focusing 24 x 7 on\n\nstudies, swotting to achieve excellence, burning\n\nmidnight oil for better CGPA has secretly\n\nengulfed many golden opportunities in their\n\ncareer-oriented life. Educational institutions\n\nshould also emphasize on studentsâ involvement\n\nin co-curricular activities.\n\nCo-curricular activities fuel our learning by\n\nstimulating innovative thoughts, improving our\n\nsocial skills, helping us to enhance our leadership\n\nand teamwork qualities, and developing better\n\nsocial relations with each other. Nevertheless,\n\nto mention that the present-day generation\n\nis showing least interest in other activities as\n\nequally shown by those in authority. There\n\nare many extracurricular activities for aspiring\n\nengineers and what matters is not the number\n\nof activities but the participation of students in\n\nthem. Honestly, from the day students opt for\n\nscience stream to the day when they step into\n\ncolleges; rarely has anyone among them shown\n\na keen interest in extracurricular activities. And\n\nthe very few who have shown interest, are still\n\nwaiting for the opportunity from the other side.\n\nAn old saying goes: âAll work and no play make\n\nJack a dull boy.â Sadly, students are so mugged\n\nup with academics that most often they forget\n\nthat during interviews it is not just their grades\n\nbut their oral communication skills, attitude,\n\nmaturity and other qualities which prove\n\nbeneficial in their placement and jobs.\n\nThe question that arises here is what fruit will it\n\nyield if you nourish a plant properly but donât\n\nprovide it with an environment necessary for its\n\nsurvival? We all are like those plants, nourished\n\nby the good hands of our teachers, yet when it\n\ncomes to our existence on our own; we lack the\n\nbasic skills which might have been inculcated in\n\nus during curricular activities. There are many\n\nextracurricular activities that management\n\nshould focus on, keeping in consideration the\n\nnecessity of interacting more with the outside\n\nAuthor is an engineering student at\n\nIOT Zakura, Engineering campus of KU\n\n66\n\nP:67\n\nworld and facing the real challenges in the long\n\nrun. Volunteering in NGOs, internships, debates,\n\nand discussions, managing events, and seminars\n\nsetting clubs for reading, writing, music and\n\npainting, competitions and quizzes, learning a\n\nnew language, and tournaments can prove very\n\nfruitful in the future for engineering students. It\n\nwill not only upgrade their morale but will teach\n\nthem the skills of sportsmanship, hard work,\n\nfriendship, teamwork, leadership, and boost their\n\nknowledge in one way or the other.\n\nThe primary concern of our educational system\n\nshould not just revolve around academics\n\nand grades. Many students despite being\n\nextraordinary in studies donât get selected\n\nin reputed companies because they lack the\n\nfundamental skills of co-curricular activities. The\n\npresent-day youth show a keen interest in social\n\nmedia and regardless, that itâs just a waste of\n\ntime and nothing else. Getting involved in cocurricular activities would not only help them\n\nin becoming better versions of themselves but\n\nwill definitely help in dragging them out from\n\nthe world of social media and gadgets. Surely\n\nthe ongoing pandemic has put a pause in these\n\nkinds of activities but there are certainly many\n\nalternatives to keep these things moving on the\n\ntrack. Conducting online debates, quizzes and\n\nother adventurous things will surely make them\n\nfall in love with learning. In this way, engineering\n\nStudents will relax their minds and experience\n\nmany things from this, which ultimately will result\n\nin better education. In the words of Aristotle: âThe\n\nquality of life is determined by its activitiesâ. Cocurricular activities are instrumental for drawing\n\nout the best potentialities of Students. All the\n\ninstitutions particularly those dealing with aspiring\n\nengineers should try their level best to implement\n\ncertain co-curricular activities in their schedule.\n\nWhile drafting the best for their students, there\n\nis an urgency to give a thought to extracurricular\n\nactivities. Thatâs what Albert Einstein quoted:\n\nâEducation is not the learning of facts. Itâs rather\n\nthe training of the mind to thinkâ. The more we\n\nthink, the more we can replace our empty minds\n\nwith open ones.\n\n67 WALK IN TALKS\n\nP:68\n\nI\n\ntâs been a while now, but I still remember that day vividly.\n\nWith rain pouring down, and water pooling on the streets,\n\nI drove through to Hazratbal, as if all alone in the whole\n\nworld. It was certainly cold and I was shivering down to\n\nmy legs, not because of the chilly weather, but due to the\n\nanxiety that had been filling me since the last few months.\n\nAs I entered through the main gate, I found it wide open,\n\nwithout any guards to ask me about my whereabouts. I had\n\nbeen here before, for the counseling, for completing the\n\nadmission formalities, and even sometimes just for the sake\n\nof it. And every time, I had been stopped at the main gate,\n\nquestioned, and then let in. But this time around, it was not\n\nthe case. There was no one to stop or question me, as if on\n\na cue. I entered the premises and drove to the hostel to pick\n\nup my friend. He entered my car drenched to the skin. He\n\nhad to walk through a pond that had been created overnight\n\nby rain, just to get to my car at the hostel gate. And then\n\nwe headed towards the main building, not knowing a thing.\n\nWe met some students there, who were as clueless as us,\n\nwandering around the corridor wanting to know more. We\n\ncouldnât find anyone who would hold our hands and drag\n\nus to the classroom, as had been the case till date. This was\n\nwhen I realized that my school life was over, and college life\n\nhad just begun. Yes, this was my first day at NIT Srinagar. It\n\nhad always been a dream of mine to become a part of this\n\ninstitute. Ever since being a kid, I heard my father talk about\n\nhis memories of REC Srinagar, as it was then called. I was\n\nalways intrigued and dreamt of following in the footsteps of\n\nmy father to join this premier institution. I was here at last,\n\nfeeling as if I had conquered the world.\n\nâI have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not\n\nto falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have\n\ndiscovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one\n\nonly finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have\n\nTh\n\ne Jo\n\nu\n\nr\n\nn\n\ne\n\ny\n\nthrough NIT S\n\nr\n\ninagar\n\nSyed Aga Hadi Riza\n\n2018BECE002\n\n68\n\nP:69\n\ntaken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious\n\nvista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have\n\ncome. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom come\n\nresponsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk has not\n\nended.â ~ Nelson Mandela\n\nThis was the beginning of my journey through NIT Srinagar. I\n\nhave come a long way since. We didnât have any classes on the\n\nfirst day, with everything being disrupted due to the tumultuous\n\nweather. Our first class started the second day, but most of us\n\nwerenât allowed in, as we were two minutes late, and that meant\n\ntwo centuries, when it came to our teacher, Dr. G.R Khan. He\n\nwas certainly strict with the timings, and with many other things,\n\nbut thatâs what made him one of the best. The day had started\n\nbadly, but it ended on a high note, especially for me, as I was\n\nelected as the CR of my class. I had always been in the role\n\never since kindergarten, So, it was definitely gratifying for me to\n\nbecome one here as well. I have always felt that the purpose of\n\nlife is to worship God and help others. I always strive or at least\n\ntry to be of any use to others, whether through any of my words,\n\ndeeds or actions. So, being in these leadership roles has always\n\nbeen my priority, as it gives me the ability to help as many\n\npeople as possible, and that remains my primary goal in life. Our\n\nfirst semester in college has been the best till date. I got to meet\n\nnew people, make new friends, participate in various activities,\n\nattend classes regularly, play football, celebrate various events\n\nand have so much fun overall.\n\nIn the second semester, I got more busy, with the responsibilities\n\nnow starting to take up more time. I was chosen as the\n\nManagement Coordinator of Techvaganza 2019, the annual\n\ntechno-cultural festival of NIT Srinagar, despite being in the\n\nfirst year of my college. Everything that I remember about the\n\nsecond semester starts and ends with Techvaganza. From the\n\npublicity part to the creative part and everything in between,\n\nI spent most of the time with things that had something to do\n\nwith this college fest. Itâs not that I missed classes or something,\n\nbut the time that I usually spent with my friends was now gone.\n\nThey often reprimanded me for it. But looking back, I have no\n\nregrets. I learned so much during that time that I feel has shaped\n\nme and it would be useful to me for the rest of my life.\n\nThen came about the third semester of our college life. We\n\ncould only have one class before the fateful day of 5th August\n\n2019, when we were given pre-planned holidays that we werenât\n\neven aware of up until that time. I spent around three months at\n\nhome, without any connectivity to others for the major part. We\n\nwere finally called back to the institute on October the 20th. It\n\nwas like a breath of fresh air. I could meet and greet my friends,\n\nmates and teachers after being confined at my home for so\n\nlong. But we couldnât spend a lot of time on the campus, just\n\n40 days, before the harsh winter kicked in, and we were forced\n\nto end the session, with the final exams being postponed to the\n\nspring of next year.\n\nIn March, we returned after a winter vacation of three months,\n\nwhich I had spent interning at IISc. Bangalore. We went\n\nthrough our pending exams, and the date for the start of our\n\nnext semester was fixed. But alas, it wasnât to be and that day\n\nnever came. It has been almost 18 months since then. I have\n\npassed my 4th, 5th as well as 6th semester, and am preparing\n\nfor the mid term exams of my 7th semester. It has been online all\n\nalong since. The classes, the exams, everything has been done\n\nvirtually for the past year and a half. Now, I am in my fourth\n\nyear of college, the last year of this happy-go-lucky life. I am\n\n21 but I feel like an old man now, with so many people adding\n\nhonorifics while calling out my name. I am a Campus Recruitment\n\nCoordinator now, responsible for bringing more placements for\n\nmy fellow mates and coordinating the same with them. I am\n\ngearing up for the final"
