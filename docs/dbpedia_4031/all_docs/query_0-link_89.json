Nine of them were killed in an attack on Imambargah Hur during Fajr prayers at Alfalah Colony and four others were shot dead outside a Sunni-sect madressah at North Karachi. The Friday killings in Karachi brought the number of those killed during the current year in sectarian attacks in the country to 95, which include the murder in Multan of a person belonging to a religious group on Friday. According to eye-witness accounts, some 19 people were in the mosque when the assailants opened fire at 5.42am. They fired some 500 rounds at intervals. The Pesh Imam of the Hur Mosque, one of the injured, said the worshippers had just stood up for the prayers when the attack came. Highly agitated protesters later in the day set on fire at least one vehicle and caused damage to many other vehicles by pelting them with stones. Besides, there took place an exchange of fire between unidentified people and police. The protesters set up bonfires in the middle of railway tracks. In the evening, two unidentified assailants equipped with automatic weapons and riding a car opened indiscriminate firing on the people coming out of Jamia Farooqia near Shafiq More in North Karachi, resulting in the instant death of three persons. Unknown assailants made their escape good. Shops and markets remained closed in the area since the morning and area was tense. The police and law enforcement agencies took up the position in the area to control the situation. Shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in all the Shia-dominated localities of the city such as Ancholi in Federal B Area. On Tuesday Secretary General of Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan, Syed Khurhshid, was gunned down in Dera Ismail Khan, along with daughter and a guard. His killing led to widespread protest demonstration in the city. The Divisional President of TJP Gujranwala, Ijaz Hussein Rasool Nagri, was shot dead outside his residence by unidentified assailants on Thursday. His five-year-old daughter was also injured in the attack.

The 39-meter-long craft, which was fitted with the latest electronic warfare system, including surface-to-surface Chinese-made missile capable of hitting the enemy targets over 100 kms, was the first such vessel built at the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works. It has been designed by the Pakistan Navy with assistance from China. Speaking at the commissioning ceremony, President Mohammad Rafiq Tarar emphasised the need for having a strong navy to serve the cause of peace. \"The best way in which we can serve the cause of peace is by removing the temptation from the minds of potential aggressors by maintaining a strong posture,\" said the president while emphasising that Pakistan had no hegemonic or aggressive designs. He said that having a strong navy was Pakistan's fundamental right and endorsed Pakistan Navy's warship construction programme through resources available at the Karachi Shipyard. Describing the construction of the missile craft at the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works a \"significant milestone\" ,President Tarar noted that the shipyard in collaboration with the Pakistan Navy was in position to offer to build submarines and warships for friendly countries.

The army chief was talking to newsmen at a reception at the Chinese embassy on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of People's Republic of China. He was asked whether Kargil was a misadventure. Gen Musharraf was asked: \" Are you comfortable with the prime minister?. \"He replied: \" Yes, very comfortable.\" Asked to comment on a government's notification regarding his confirmation as Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Gen Musharraf, who was looking calm and confident, said it was the government's decision. To a question whether he was visiting garrisons to pacify the jawans over Kargil, the COAS said he had been visiting his troops and holding frank talks with them. \"It is the moral duty of an army chief to visit troops to congratulate them on their performance and success\". He agreed with a questioner that Kargil had helped project the Kashmir issue, and expressed the hope that \" the Kashmir issue would be settled in near future\". Asked whether the troops had been withdrawn during the Kargil crisis, \" at your behest, for Pakistan troops were unable to fight\", he said: \" If an army chief says like this about his troops then he should resign\". Responding to a question, Gen Musharraf ruled out an inquiry into the Kargil issue. He said:\" There is no need for any inquiry because it was not a failure, rather it was a great success and we have learnt from it\". He hoped that the government would take a decision about signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the best national interest. Asked if there was any pressure from the army on the government not to sign the CTBT, Gen Musharraf said: \"No, there is no such pressure. But the armed forces strongly believe that the government would take a decision about signing the treaty ( CTBT) in the best national interest\". When his attention was drawn to press reports that the COAS had suggested to the government to withdraw Mujahideen from Kargil, he termed them incorrect.

His tenure as both the COAS and the CJCSC will now end on October 6, 2001. General Musharraf, who was made the COAS and the acting CJCSC when General Jehangir Karamat had resigned from the two posts in October last year, has been confirmed as the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee by the president under Article 243(2)(c) of the Constitution of Pakistan on the advice of the prime minister. The Article 243(2)(c) of the Constitution says, \"the president shall subject to law, have power to appoint (on the advise of the prime minister) the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the Chief of the Army Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff, and determine their salaries and allowances\". This clause which earlier had given the discretion in this respect to the president had been amended suitably to provide for the advise of the prime minister in such appointments when the 13th Constitutional Bill was passed by the parliament in early 1997. The decision to confirm the COAS in the position of the CJCSC has come in the wake of two meetings which Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Federal Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan had held with the COAS, first on September 22 and again on September 24. These meetings between the COAS and the prime minister's two closest confidantes, one being his own brother and the other the brother of the defence secretary, were being viewed here as highly significant as they had closely followed the US State Department's warning (on September 20) to \"political and military actors\" that the US would \"strongly oppose\" any attempt to overthrow the government. In the aftermath of the Kargil crisis, reports had been circulating in the media that the prime minister and the army chief had developed serious differences. However, quarters close to both had strongly contradicted such reports. \"Now when the general has been made the full-fledged Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, rumours of differences between the two will hopefully come to an end,\" a source close to the government said. App adds: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has extended the tenure of the additional charge of the office of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC), held by General Parvaiz Musharraf, the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), upto October 6, 2001. An official notification issued here Wednesday said that the additional charge was originally assigned to him until April 8, 2000. Commenting on the decision, a spokesman at the Prime Minister's office expressed the hope that the \"step will once and for all set at rest the uncalled rumours and speculation about the change of command in army, that certain vested interests were fanning in pursuance of their political agenda.\" DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 990930 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Special envoy on Kashmir: Pakistan hails US lawmakers' move ------------------------------------------------------------------- ISLAMABAD, Sept 29: Pakistan on Wednesday welcomed the US legislators' move, urging the Clinton Administration to appoint a special envoy on Kashmir as a \"positive development\" and described it an \"important signal\" underlining the urgency of resolving the Kashmir dispute. A Foreign Office spokesman, commenting on the move by influential US senators and congressmen, stated that the \"major powers' role on the Kashmir dispute and this option were overdue for a long time as Kashmir was the oldest issue on the UN agenda.\" \"This is a positive development. We will welcome this,\" he said when contacted to comment on the American legislators' letter sent to President Bill Clinton, asking him to appoint a special envoy on Kashmir and propose strengthening the UN Military Observers Group to monitor the situation along the Line of Control. The spokesman described the development as an important signal to the US administration on the Kashmir issue, saying that Washington had been playing a very active role on international issues since the end of the Cold War. He referred to America's influential role in the Middle East peace process, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo and more recently East Timor. The spokesman also described the move as an important signal for New Delhi which should realise that if India did not solve the issue \"there will be international involvement.\" On its part, the spokesman said, Islamabad had been asking New Delhi to enter into result-oriented negotiations for the settlement of the Kashmir dispute as well as called for international involvement on the issue. The Foreign Office spokesman said Pakistan had been all along canvassing with the US Congress and the American legislators's stress on the resolution of the Kashmir issue was in line with Islamabad's stand. The letter, signed by more than 60 American lawmakers, including powerful Senator and Chairman Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, described Kashmir as \"the most dangerous nuclear flashpoint in the world today.\" Reminding President Clinton of his commitment to take a personal interest in encouraging India and Pakistan to resume and intensify their dialogue on Kashmir, the US lawmakers called for his timely intervention to help defuse the crisis in Kashmir. The spokesman also appreciated the role of American Pakistani community in this regard and said they actively lobbied with the US legislators. The US legislators have written that the envoy could recommend him \"ways of ascertaining the wishes of the Kashmir people and reaching a just and lasting settlement of the Kashmir issue.\" -APP DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 990929 ------------------------------------------------------------------- US wants Pakistan, India to hold direct talks ------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED NATIONS, Sept 28: Secretary of State Madeline Albright urged Pakistan and India - South Asian rivals who conducted landmark nuclear tests last year - to resume a direct dialogue on bilateral issues like Kashmir soon after a new Indian government takes office next month. Albright also pressed Pakistan to make good on a commitment to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) banning nuclear tests, a US official said. She also expressed concern over anti- democratic trends in Pakistan and resisted Islamabad's call for an early further easing of U.S. sanctions. The U.S. position was conveyed in a 45-minute meeting between Albright and Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz that the U.S. side later described as \"frank,\" diplomatic code word for tough and pointed. Albright met her Pakistani counterpart after holding talks with Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh on the fringes of the U.N. General Assembly. In her meeting with Aziz, she objected to the Sept. 25 arrest by Pakistani police of several hundred people prior to a planned demonstration in Karachi, officials said. They said she reinforced a State Department statement accusing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government of attempting to \"suppress a peaceful protest\" and expressing fresh concern about \"mass arrests of opposition political party members in connection with peaceful demonstrations.\" \"We support the strengthening of democracy in Pakistan and call upon Prime Minister Sharif and his government to carry out their responsibility to preserve the rights of free speech and peaceful assembly,\" it said. U.S. officials told Reuters recently that in addition to concerns about government repression, they were worried about possible attempts by the army and political opponents to overthrow Sharif's government. But Albright's focus on Monday was on government behaviour, the senior official said. Before the meeting, Aziz publicly announced that, despite a promise last year, Pakistan could not yet sign the CTBT because of a \"coercive environment.\" This referred to U.S. sanctions imposed because of Pakistan's nuclear programme. Albright urged Pakistan to sign and ratify the treaty soon and told Aziz that because lifting sanctions depends on action by the U.S. Congress, \"it is not possible ... to give assurances,\" the official said. She noted that since last year's nuclear tests, the United States had gone out of its way to help Pakistan, easing restrictions on trade assistance, reimbursing Islamabad for an aborted purchase of F-16 jets and supporting international loans to help boost Pakistan's troubled economy. \"So we believe that we are already moving toward that less coercive environment and we hope Pakistan would be able to respond with concrete steps of its own,\" she said, according to the senior official. No date was set for Clinton's visit, the first to South Asia by a U.S. president in two decades. But U.S. officials have said they are looking to arrange the trip as early as January and no later than March. A firm date, and other fundamental decisions, are not expected until after a new Indian government takes office next month.- Reuters DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 991002 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Pakistan links CTBT signing to lifting of sanctions ------------------------------------------------------------------- WASHINGTON, Oct 1: Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said on Thursday Pakistan would not sign an international treaty banning nuclear weapons tests until the United States further eased economic sanctions. Addressing the Woodrow Wilson Centre think-tank, he denied Pakistan had added new conditions to its position, although some American analysts say that is what has happened. \"There is no change in our position,\" Aziz insisted. \"Pakistan is ready (to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) in an atmosphere free from coercion,\" he said, referring to long- standing U.S. economic sanctions imposed because of Islamabad's nuclear weapons programme. The minister, in the United States for the opening of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, said his government was looking for quick passage by the U.S. Congress of a new law providing a five- year waiver of some sanctions and repeal of others. This would allow Pakistan to acquire military spare parts and defence equipment needed to \"maintain the credibility of our conventional defence,\" he said. \"Such removal of the coercive environment will, in turn, enable our prime ministers to build domestic support for adherence to the CTBT,\" he said. Aziz charged that religious fundamentalism had much greater popular support in India than Pakistan and he accused India's ruling BJP party of \"systematic violence and murder\" against Muslims and other religious minorities. He denied that extremist groups, including bin Laden's, were part of a cohesive network and said the Taliban were not engaged in terrorist activity. Aziz also argued that the United States could help counter extremism in South Asia by generating economic development in Pakistan and Afghanistan.-Reuters DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 990929 ------------------------------------------------------------------- LoC crossing: India hopes Pakistan will restrain Kashmiris ------------------------------------------------------------------- NEW DELHI, Sept 28: India hopes Pakistan will not allow freedom fighters to cross the military line of control into disputed Kashmir region, a senior official said on Tuesday. \"Our feeling is that Pakistan will not act so rashly as to allow them to cross the Line of Control but if they do, we are prepared for it,\" India's National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra told the television channel Star News. The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which wants independence for Kashmir, has said thousands of unarmed supporters will cross onto occupied Kashmir on Oct 4 to draw attention to its cause. Mishra said it was a matter of concern for India. \"It's a matter of concern if they try to cross and you shoot at people, obviously it is a matter of concern if you have to do that....but we're prepared for it,\" Mishra told Star News. Mishra said India was not worried about news reports that Pakistan planned a test firing of its Ghauri III missile on Wednesday, and said Islamabad ruin its economy if went ahead with the project.- Reuters DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 990930 ------------------------------------------------------------------- GDA leaders ask Nawaz to step down immediately ------------------------------------------------------------------- Correspondent MULTAN, Sept 29: Leaders of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) on Wednesday said that Nawaz Sharif should step down immediately as he had committed the offence of high treason by taking extra- constitutional measures, damaging the institutions of Judiciary and armed forces and because of his failure on all fronts. They said that if Nawaz did not resign, people would oust him. The demand was made at the end of a three-hour rally which started from Nawan Shehr Chowk and terminated at Daulat-Gate Chowk after passing through Abdali Road, Pul-Shawala, Bohar-Gate, Shaheen- Market, Haram-Gate, Pak-Gate, Khuni-Burj and Delhi-Gate. The rally was led by Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan (PDP), Imran Khan (PTI), Allama Tahir-ul-Qadri (PAT), Rao Sikandar Iqbal (PPP), Asfand Yar Wali (ANP), Mairaj Muhammad Khan (QMA), Khurshid Shah, Makhdoom Amin Faheem, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani (PPP) and Hamid Nasir Chattha (PML). The gathering was dominated by PDP and Awami Tehreek activists. The PPP and Tehrik-i-Insaf supporters were also in large number. Allama Tahir-ul-Qadri said the statement of the State Department regarding the role of armed forces in Pakistan was an interference in the country's internal affairs and an attack on the sovereignty, independence, prestige and security of Pakistan. He alleged that the Nawaz government was using police and law- enforcement agencies against the opposition. He said the electronic media was also being misused by the rulers for personal coverage. He said the higher courts should take notice of extra- constitutional steps of the PML government, particularly in Sindh, usurping of human rights, gagging the Press and negating the rights of expression. He said the government did not appoint the judges of the Supreme Court in the light of judgment of March 20, 1996. He further said that about 30,000 people were recruited on contract basis on the recommendations of MPAs and MNAs which was a violation of the Civil Services Act, 1976. Allama Tahir-ul-Qadri said that Punjab chief minister had ended the authority of the centre by inviting foreign investors directly to the Punjab. Tehrik-i-Insaf Chief Imran Khan said that the days of the present rulers were numbered. Now even the United States cannot save Nawaz, he said. He said that Nawaz Sharif was ready to accept the Indian hegemony in South Asia by signing the CTBT unilaterally. He said that corruption had increased while Nawaz wanted to sell out Pakistan like a sick unit and a sense of deprivation was developing among the smaller provinces. He ruled out the possibility of an in-house change. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan enumerated the objective of the rally and said the massive turnout, inspite of scorching heat in Multan, had established that people did not want to see the PML government in power any more.

Ms Naheed Khan, Munawwar Suharwardy, MPA Abdul Khaliq Juma of the PPP and Senator Atfab Ahmed Shakih of the Muttahida were granted bail against a surety of Rs 20,000 each by Additional District and Sessions Judge South, Abdul Rasool Memon. The opposition leaders were sent to jail by the administration to thwart anti-government rally on Sept 25. Senator Shaikh, who was realised from Landhi jail, said he was kept in \"solitary confinement\" for six days during which even his wife was not allowed to meet him. Deploring the government, he claimed that out of vengeance his wife was not allowed to see him and was told that it was \"not the policy.\" He said that violation of section 144 was not such an offence. Senator Shaikh said the food was hopeless and the general condition in the jail was appalling and unhygienic. He alleged that the new in charge of Landhi jail had been deputed by Syed Ghous Ali Shah to do manipulate things according to his wish. Senator Shaikh deplored the government action of suppressing the voice of dissent. He said that despite production orders by the Senate chairman, he was not sent to Islamabad to attend the session commencing on Thursday and the authorities delayed the bail formalities. The judge issued a common order disposing of bail application of Munawwar Suharwardy, Abdul Khaliq Juma, Nahid Khan and Aftab Shaikh, against whom a case under section 188 PPC had been registered. The applicants had been declined bail by SDM Civil Lines vide order dated Sept 27. The judge observed that allegations against them briefly were that they were the active members of the procession on Sept 25, which was in violation of the section 144 Cr.P.C. Pursuant to the registration of the FIRs, various persons having affiliation with the political parties were arrested. Many of them were granted bail but the above mentioned leaders were refused bail mainly on the ground that main role had been assigned to the present applicants. The judge in his ruling said he had heard the counsel for the applicants and the deputy district attorney, Miss Zainab Hamirani. The later \"frankly conceded to the grant of bail\", the judged said.

The federal government, after taking possession of the road, will hand it over to the Fauji Foundation for its conversion into a six-lane Motorway. Malik Aslam, NHA Member (Motorways), told Dawn on Thursday that there some bottlenecks which he hoped would be cleared within a week or so. The government has signed a contract with the Fauji Foundation for the conversion of the four-lane Super Highway into a six-lane motorway at an estimated cost of Rs 8 billion. The concession agreement for handing over the road to the Fauji Foundation for 25 years was signed on June 21, 1999. The road, according to the government, will be converted into a motorway on build, operate, transfer (BOT) basis. The government of Sindh has been opposing the conversion of the existing road into a motorway. It has taken the plea that the province will be deprived of one source of revenue generation. It is learnt that negotiations on Sindh's demand that the federal government should pay \"lease money\" for getting possession of the road will continue. The federal government, which is of the view that the Super Highway is already a federal road, has not so far committed anything in this regard. The federal government is seeking mutation of the land as the contractor required the document to raise finances. According to the existing arrangement, the Sindh government collects toll tax from the road users. The contractor, Fauji Foundation, will start collecting toll tax on the existing four lanes. It will construct two additional lanes and fence the road. Informed sources said that the issue pertaining to toll tax collection from Super Highway and Sindh government's share from the tax has yet to be resolved. Sindh government which is already faced with financial crunch has reportedly pleaded with the people at the helm of affairs to sort out the issue of toll tax collection prior to formal handing over of Super Highway to National Highway Authority or Fauji Foundation so that the province might not lose a handsome amount of revenue which it generates from toll tax charged from vehicles plying on it. Elaborating, the sources said that advisor to the prime minister for Sindh affairs, Syed Ghaus Ali Shah, who has already discussed the issue with prime minister recently, will shortly visit Islamabad for the resolution of toll tax issue.\n\n=================================================================== BUSINESS & ECONOMY 990929 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Economic revival: Cabinet body for cut in interest rates ------------------------------------------------------------------- Ihtashamul Haque ISLAMABAD, Sept 28: The cabinet committee, constituted for economic revival, has recommended revival of viable sick industrial units, bringing down interest rates of the banks and removing multiplicity of taxes. \"The cabinet committee invited here on Tuesday many top international bankers and sought their recommendations to drastically revive the economy of the country\", said Deputy Chairman Planning Commission Ahsan Iqbal. He told Dawn after the meeting, during which prominent exporters and senior officials of the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) were also present, that the cabinet committee has formulated new recommendations as to how to revive the sick industrial units, cut down the interest rate of the commercial banks and reduce the number of taxes. \"We are still in the process of finalizing our recommendations to be shortly placed before the cabinet for final approval\", Ahsan Iqbal said who is also the chairman of the Programme 2010. To a question, he said it will take maximum a week or ten days to finalize the recommendations by the cabinet committee. For increasing exports, the committee proposed recruitment of highly proficient staff with requisite expertise, setting up of export cells by commercial banks, shifting of roles of Pakistan missions from politics to economics and improvement in skills of Pakistan work force in export-oriented industries. The meeting was chaired by the Federal Minister for Water and Power Gohar Ayub Khan in the absence of Minister for Finance and Commerce Ishaq Dar, who is currently visiting the United States.

Under the agreement, official sources claimed, the government intends to fix raw cotton minimum procurement price at Rs835 per 40kg and lint price at Rs1936 per bale. Under the agreement, sources added, federal government has constituted a high-level committee under the chairmanship of federal minister for food, agriculture and livestock Abdul Sattar Lalika with the mandate to review the cotton situation after every 10 days and take decisions to protect the interest of all the parties. Sources said Punjab chief minister was made chairman of a cabinet committee on cotton on Wednesday to resolve the cotton price issue within 24 hours. He held a meeting on Wednesday night at Islamabad, which was attended by MNAs from cotton belt, Chairman Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) and officials of both the miniseries of commerce and agriculture. Sources said after long deliberations and discussion, all the participants agreed to fix the procurement prices of raw and lint cotton \"in the best interest of the country\". It has also been decided that on federal government's behalf, Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) would procure cotton from the growers at fixed price of Rs835 per 40kg and will further sell it to the ginners at appropriate price. When contacted by Dawn, a member of this new cotton committee and PML MNA who refused to be identified, confirmed the news of agreement between the APTMA and growers' representative. However, when pressed he refused to divulge information about this agreement saying \"all the participants were strictly directed by Shahbaz Sharif that no one but the prime minister himself would announce the details\". To a question that weather the agitating growers who were demanding Rs1000 and above for 40kg raw cotton will accept this agreement, he replied that whatever they (MNAs lobby) could do, they have done so in the best interest of both the country and the growers. He was of the view that cotton growers also needed to understand that the prices of cotton at international market are getting depressed day by day. So this price formula was favourable for the growers in these circumstances. Our Staff Reporter from Karachi adds: Government has fixed the minimum procurement prices for both phutti (seedcotton) and lint cotton at Rs835.00 and Rs1,936.00 per 40kg, respectively, but APTMA bosses opposed the move terming it an \"official intervention in free cotton trade\". Representative of the spinners opposing the move said APTMA would give its view after holding a general body meeting. According to reports reaching here APTMA highups held their meeting to finalize a consensus on the issue but details were not available as it was in session. The Trading Corporation to which the job of procurement is said to have been assigned will enter the market after phutti or lint prices fall below the minimum price of Rs835.00 and Rs1,936.00 per 40kg but it may keep off the market when prices seek higher levels depending on supply and demand factors, market sources said. \"Let the government procure cotton to benefit growers and ginners but allow us duty-free import on lint\", a spinners is reported to have told the meeting. The local prices are claimed to be higher than the foreign ones.

An official of the embassy's economic division said Mr Dar was involved in intense negotiations, sometimes on a one-to-one basis, with Hubco high-ups.\"At one stage he asked the finance secretary and the Pakistan Embassy's economic counsellor to leave the room,\" the official told Dawn. Some sketchy outlines of the deal revealed by the official indicate that Mr Dar is trying to agree with Hubco on a formula to stagger the payments over a period of time so that the debilitating impact of the payment is not felt in one go. \" They are discussing how the payments could be made in instalments, over an agreed period, without cutting down the amounts that have to be paid to Hubco,\" the official revealed. The formula was to make the payments that had been contracted with Hubco but over an extended period of time, the official said. Asked about the progress in talks with the IMF, Mr Aziz told Pakistani correspondents, present in the embassy, that he had no information about Mr Dar's talks with the IMF, World Bank or Hubco.

The aircraft, acquired by Raji Airlines, promises to rock the already shaky aviation market at a time when things had finally started to improve for other carriers in the business. The same day, officials at the national carrier, PIA, unveiled a massive discount scheme for its customers as another intense air fare war was triggered off by the re-entry of Raji Airlines, which again promises to offer cheap rates to the travelling public. Fare wars are not new to Pakistan ever since the government opened up the domestic aviation sector in 1993 to local carriers. Since then, a number of airlines have come, and some have even gone, because of the stiff competition prevalent. In the case of Raji Airlines, it closed down operations after a year of service in 1994 because of various reasons. After five years of planning and subsequent reorganization, the airline has once again surfaced. The man behind Raji Airlines, Captain Aijaz Rab, insists that his airline's real competition is not in the sky but firmly on the ground. Rab's strategy is to get railway passengers to pay a little more for sake of safety, convenience and time, and fly with his airline instead. While this may seem strange in other countries, the fares charged by Pakistan Railways for its airconditioned coaches is barely 30% lower than what domestic air carriers say they will be charging the travelling public. Raji Airlines plans to break the Rs 2,000 barrier between Lahore- Karachi sector for a one way ticket: a fare that competitors are unable to offer. It is mavericks like Rab of Raji, Tabani of Aero Asia and Faizi of Bhoja Air who are making a place for themselves through sheer grit and determination, without help from official quarters. The local airlines are already facing up to the pinch of the new entrant, Raji Airlines. While domestic air travel has been growing at an impressive rate in Pakistan ever since the sector was opened up to private operators in 1993, it is still not that big to cater for the national carrier and four private carriers. This is reflected in the load being carried by all the carriers, which is lower than the business they were doing in their initial years. With cut throat competition, the passenger emerges the winner. But that only happens when the regulatory body ensures that the airlines are not cutting corners that may affect flight safety. In this area, the CAA has been seen to be partial to PIA. A fact that the other airline companies vocally attest to privately. The senate's standing committee on aviation has alluded to this fact in its meetings in July and has once again told the CAA that no compromise should be made on the safety angle of aircraft. In the case of PIA, its marketing strategies have not been able to press home its advantages as the biggest carrier in the business. A widely publicised plan to run flights between Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore on an hourly or two-hourly basis fell flat after flights were operated largely empty in the first few months forcing the management to abandon the idea. In 1998-99, the opening of the northern gateway - which allowed foreign airlines to directly service stations like Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar, led to a 15% decline in the domestic passenger market. Similarly, the Lahore-Islamabad motorway has affected air traffic between the two cities. PIA says that it controlled the lion's share of the market with 70.5% share on domestic routes while Aero Asia had 17.5%, Shaheen Airlines 5.5% with Bhoja having under 5% market share. Notwithstanding the fact that airline travelling public has increased substantially, this has not necessarily meant better loads for operating airlines.

Official sources said here on Friday that the government is actively considering to levy 15 per cent duty along with 10 per cent general sales tax on imported commercial oilseeds. Sources said the prime minister Nawaz Sharif has already sought a report from the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) regarding duty structure after cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Sources added the prime minister was approached by those PML MNAs/ ministers who have oil mills to get the duty imposed on oilseed import. Under the present tariff structure, the import duty on oilseed will be zero, if LC price of imported commodity is $240 or more per metric ton, sources added. Sources claimed that the federal government has learnt that oilseeds importers are over-invoicing all imports at $240 and above per metric ton irrespective of international prices which are reportedly lower presently to avail zero duty benefits. A ministerial source claimed that the issue of zero import duty was raised by the minister of state for foreign affairs, Mohammad Sadik Khan Kanju, who told the cabinet on Wednesday that import of oilseeds under zero duty regime would play havoc with the local oilseed development programmes. Meanwhile, sources said following the reports of imposition of duty on oilseeds import, both the Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers' Association (PVMA) and All Pakistan Solvent Extraction Association (APSEA) have suddenly become active to get their own ends met and have contacted the government to get their points of views accommodated. Sources said the PVMA that is demanding imposition of import duty on oilseeds, in a letter addressed to the federal minister for finance and commerce, Ishaq Dar has advocated fixation of tariff on import of commercial canola/rapeseed and sunflower. It said the issue of oilseed import at zero tariff was adversely affecting incentives given to the local growers in the form of crop support price. Meanwhile, official sources said the All Pakistan Solvent Oil Extraction Association in a communication to the government has strongly opposed this proposed imposition of import duty saying all the solvent units were already running under capacity due to limited availability of local oilseed crops. The zero duty regime, the association claimed had greatly helped revival of sick solvent units in the country.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also authorised to allow subsequent disposal of these goods n terms of SRO 505 (I)/88. It has been observed that the Ministry also issues exemption certificates in respect of goods imported by organisations other than diplomats and diplomatic missions like foreign dignitaries, NGOs and other foreign-assisted welfare projects. In some cases, the Ministry has allowed such permissions even without payment of Customs Duties and other taxes. Such permissions are not covered by the Rules of Business and do not come within the ambit of any Act of Notification.

The last official rate was quoted at Rs4,732 per 10 grams on September 25, 1999, General Secretary of Karachi Saraf and Jewellers Group, Haji Mohammad Farooq told Dawn. He said the international price has now settled to $300 per ounce on Thursday after surging to $321 per ounce on Wednesday. The international market jumped to $292 per ounce on Tuesday as against $288 per ounce on Monday. Some 20 days back, the precious metal was quoted at $255 to $260 per ounce in the world market. The trading in the bullion hall in Sarafa, he said, may remain suspended until the international rates are not settled. Haji Farooq said that jewellery sales have also been affected in the last few days and customers are waiting for a price plunge. Owing to absence of any official rate, jewellers in the city have been fleecing consumers by charging higher rates.

It further stated that under F.E. circular No. 19 of July 8, the diplomatic missions can use the special foreign currency accounts for making payment to the diplomatic officers and home-based members of the mission staff and by international organisations for making payment to their expatriate employees in foreign currency or for credit to a convertible rupee account. The following amendment has been brought by the SBP in its circular: The Diplomatic Missions accredited to Pakistan and International Organizations in Pakistan are permitted to maintain special FCAs for receiving funds from abroad. Receipts into these accounts will not be required to be surrendered by the Authorized dealers to the State Bank and the Authorized Dealers may retain such balances in their Nostro accounts in addition to their trading Nostro limits.-APP DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 991001 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Govt, oil firm reach price accord ------------------------------------------------------------------- Bureau Report ISLAMABAD, Sept 30: The government has agreed to a price formula with an international oil and gas company, LASMO, which has declared its discovery as \"commercial\" in Bhit field, Sindh, with estimated gas reserves of 700 to 800 billion cubic feet. The development is being viewed by the industry experts as a \"breakthrough\". The government and the exploration companies were engaged in discussion for agreement on producer gas prices for the last several months. The dispute had retarded the commercialisation of vast natural reserves. Talking to Dawn, Dr Gulfraz, Secretary Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (P&NR), said that the government had reached an agreement \"in principle\" on producer price with LASMO for purchasing gas from its discovery in Bhit. \"We only asked them to share the windfall profit in case of crash of prices of oil in the international market,\" he said. LASMO has declared the \"commerciality\" of its discovery and its production of gas will start in October 2001. Discoveries of two other companies - BHP and Tullow Pakistan - are also in advance stages but they are yet to declare their \"commerciality\". He said that the government was fully committed to petroleum policy 1994/97 as well as the agreement with the petroleum companies. According to the agreed pricing formula, the government has provided floor price of US$10 of oil per barrel to the company. If the price of oil remained within US$10 to $15, the price provided in Petroleum Policy 1997 would be applicable.

The returns are to be filed for the assessment year 1999-2000. To give a final shape to these arrangements a delegation of Income Tax Bar Association, Karachi (ITBA) headed by its President Abdul Wahid Tejani held a meeting with the Commissioner Income Tax Zone 'D', Akhter Jamil who is working as a coordinator to facilitate taxpayers in the last two days. Normally, in the last days there is always a rush of taxpayers for filing their returns and the authorities make extra arrangements to dispense off with the load of work within the stipulated time. Likewise, under an arrangement the income tax authorities on Wednesday, Sept 29 will accept returns up to 3pm in their respective circles/zones. Thereafter, the returns will be accepted on the ground floor of the Income Tax Building where special zonewise counters will receive the returns up to 8pm. On the last date i.e. Thursday, Sept 30, zonewise counters erected on the ground floor of the IT Building located at Shahrah-e-Kamal Ataturk will start receiving tax returns from 9am till midnight. However, it is also informed that on both days (Sept 29-30) the returns will continue to be collected in the respective circles as well. It has also been agreed that all returns filed under USAS will be received without disputing the same and no return will be returned for whatsoever reason.

The recent increase in sectarian killings did worry investors as it could further destabilize the law and order situation, both in Punjab and Sindh, and leading among them are watching the developing situation very carefully. 'But what worried them most is the fear of retaliation by the other sect and that could aggravate the law and order situation', said a leading floor broker. However, the market managed to recover from the early lows thanks to the revival of strong speculative support in the leading shares, notably Hub-Power and PTCL. The KSE 100-share index early was down over seven points but mid- session strong short-covering in Hub-Power and PTCL allowed the market to finish on a relatively improved note. It was last quoted at 1,198.10 as compared to 1,199.29 a day earlier, showing a fractional decline of 1.19 points. The modest fall at the weekend session and the relative strength of leading base shares reflects that the opening next week could be on a high note. The total market capitalization also showed a modest decline at Rs 324.887bn as compared to Rs325.201bn a day earlier as some of the heavily-capitalized shares, notably Fauji Fertiliser suffered modest fall. Analysts said investors are a bit optimistic about the settlement of the Hubco issue in next week's Washington meeting between its officials and the WAPDA chief and are not inclined to unloading positions but most of them rather buyers. 'The market is literally a hostage to the Hubco issue and until its resolved the market might continued to give a volatile performance', they added. A cash dividend at the rate of 25% for the year ended June 30, '99 by Pakistan Refinery despite a substantial decline of over Rs2bn in its sales was well-received in the rings as was reflected by a good gain of 70 paisa in its share at Rs21.90. Leading shares, notably Dadex Eternit, Shell Pakistan and KASB & Co led the list of gainers, rising by Rs3.10 to Rs4.00 followed by Capital Asset Leasing, Security Leasing, Reliance Cotton, Reckitt and Colman and H.M.Ismail Textiles, which posted gains ranging from one rupee to Rs3.00. DIVIDEND: Pakistan Refinery cash at the rate of 25% for the year ended June 30, '99.\n\nBack to the top\n\n=================================================================== EDITORIALS & FEATURES 990926 ------------------------------------------------------------------- The faultline ------------------------------------------------------------------- Ardeshir Cowasjee LAST week my subject was the uneducated of our government who indiscriminately squander the money of the poor and deprived of their country and who qualify their so doing by claiming it is within their discretionary powers, that it is their 'entitlement.' It is their entitlement, they say, to build motorways whilst the people have no drinking water. It is their entitlement to travel the world on sightseeing trips in special flights whilst there is no money to educate the millions of illiterates at home. The feedback from the majority was the simple question: Who and what is an educated man? Education, it is said, is the means by which the wheat is separated from the chaff, by which the finest mental and moral qualities of an individual are brought to the fore, by which the latent is converted into the active, and by which empathy towards the feelings of others is created. According to the Upanishads, educated is he who can distinguish the real from the unreal, light from darkness; education in the final analysis elevates a man from death to immortality. What our prime minister finds difficult to understand is that respect cannot be demanded, that it has to be commanded, and that whatever he may do he cannot buy goodwill. Yet again, he has childishly attempted to bribe the press. His Media Maestro Mushahid invited a team of pressmen, sixteen in all, to Lahore to play cricket against the Lahore Gymkhana XI on September 11. The national carrier, PIA, which every prime minister considers to be his or her own personal airline, was ordered to transport the sixteen from Karachi to Lahore and back at the people's expense. The Press XI scored 185 runs whilst the Mian's Lahore Gymkhana team were restricted to 88 all out, of which the Mian himself scored 52. The journalists were accommodated at Faletti's at our cost, transported around Lahore at our cost, and reportedly gifts in cash and kind were distributed. Each run scored by the Mian probably cost us in the region of Rs.20,000. One comment made by an educated man after the match was over: The poor people of this nation pay for Nawaz Sharif's victory - the elections; for his retreat - Kargil; for his defeat - on the cricket field. Educated Governor Kamal Azfar's donation to the Karachi Golf Club was also made at his 'discretion' out of his discretionary funds. Professor Ahsan Rashid, chairman of the Poor Patients 'Aid Society of Karachi's Civil Hospital had often appealed to Kamal for funds which he was never given. Would an enlightened educated man not rather have given to the poor sick and dying than to the rich healthy golfers? Educated Globetrotter, Rhodes Scholar Wasim Sajjad, chairman of the most honourable Upper House is on the trot once again, leading a delegation of elected representatives to a conference in the Carribean and last week was living it up in Port of Spain. He may well be on his 100th jaunt since he became the chairman of the Senate. Now to the serious trot, that of Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif. We heard he was off to the US to meet with software experts and genetically engineered seed merchants in the interests of investment. But he went straight from the airport to dine with Strobe Talbott and to complain about the corrupt, toothless and spineless opposition and the army, both of which he said were trying to oust, by unconstitutional means, his family's good government. The usual noises were made by anonymous Americans announcing that the US is all for democracy and is averse to the toppling of democratically elected governments through force (the army). But the American support of democracy can be highly pragmatic. For years they supported the King of Kings, the Shah of Shahs in SAVAK-dominated Iran, and when he was deposed and dying they would not allow him into the US. Memories are short and people may have forgotten how difficult it was for the Shah's family to find a six- foot by two-foot piece of ground in which to bury him. For years the Americans supported General Manual Ities Morena Noriega's form of democracy in Panama, they supported General Ugarte Augusto Pinochet in Chile, they tolerated for 32 years General Suharto in Indonesia, and for eleven long years in Pakistan they gladly supported General Zia-ul-Haq and his 'democratic' rule. Our weak and corrupt governments will always fear the army, famously termed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as being the only disciplined party of the country, its largest and most rich. Nawaz Sharif has more to fear as he has amended the Constitution and blocked all constitutional means available to the people of ousting him. By demoralizing the army and not abiding by the conventional line of seniority, he has weakened his safety net. He did not trust General Jehangir Karamat, so he had to go, and with him the two most senior generals. Soon after he appointed General Pervez Musharraf as COAS, he was overtaken by feelings of discomfort and made it clear that he would like to move him up a notch into the powerless redundant higher seat of the Joint Chief. News from the ranks has it that Nawaz Sharif would be most comfortable with a man down the line, General Ziauddin, an engineer and once Private Secretary to COAS Aslam Beg, who he has appointed as his eyes and ears to head the ISI. Last week, Ziauddin was on a 'routine' visit to Washington whilst Shahbaz Sharif was there. A news report of September 23 in this newspaper told us that General Aslam Beg \"was especially concerned over the visit of the director-general of the ISI and asked: 'what is he trying to gain for himself?'.\" What the Americans do not realize is that our army can act without staging a coup. In 1993, did not COAS General Abdul Waheed Kakar go to dine with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and before pudding was served did not both president and prime minister 'constitutionally' resign? Under the present circumstances the Americans will back any form of democracy sufficiently powerful to be able to curb nuclear proliferation, theocrats, fundamentalists, the Taliban, freedom fighters and Jehadis more commonly known to them as terrorists. The double-headed West, America and Europe, with which Japan and Russia are aligned, fear militant (or resurgent) Islam, as does our good friend China. Some 50 independent Islamic states allow themselves to remain disunited. Many buy arms from the West which they sometimes use against each other. They control much of the oil reserves and the Organisation of Islamic Conference could have a voice in world affairs but because of its own inability does not. Writing in The Times (London) on September 20, on forecasts of the worldwide conflict on the Islamic faultline, Lord William Rees- Mogg, a former editor of that newspaper, is chillingly accurate : \"The world is full of violence. There are the massacres in East Timor; the murder of 300 Russians by terrorist bombs probably related to Chechnya; the ethnic cleansing of the Albanians and then of the Serbs in Kosovo . . . . the grumbling confrontation in Kashmir between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers . . . . . \"Kashmir is a conflict between the resurgent Islam of Pakistan and the resurgent Hinduism of India. Chechnya is a conflict between Islam and Russia. Kosovo is an even more extraordinary situation, a conflict between Islam and Slav Orthodoxy . . . . \"The West is seen as double-headed between the United States and Europe; Islam has no core country, which makes it more difficult to relate to from the outside. Islam and the West, in different ways, present the world with the greatest difficulties. \"Muslims are expected to make up about 30 per cent of the world's population by 2025 . . . . the danger lies in the reaction between the revival of the Islamic confidence, backed by a growing population, and the fears of the neighbouring civilisations. All the neighbouring civilisations feel potentially under threat. The West is concerned about oil, nuclear proliferation, immigration, the survival of Israel, and human rights. . . . \"India fears Pakistan and potentially the alienation of the 100 million Muslims in India itself. China is concerned about Central Asia and about the Chinese in Indonesia. The non-Muslim population of Sub-Saharan Africa has anxieties as well. . . . .\" We in Pakistan are dependent upon the West. Prudence demands that we trim our sails.

By sheer chance, my attention was drawn to an article on Edward Said published in this newspaper's weekly Review section. Since Said had delivered this year's Eqbal Ahmad Lecture (Kofi Annan was the speaker last year), apart from being a panelist in the following day's symposium, I would have written about him anyway, but the contents of the article were so disturbing that I have decided to devote this column to the famous Palestinian's on-going tribulations. I had heard about a scurrilous attack launched on Said by a paid Zionist hack, but had not realized the nature and viciousness of the whole thing. While all Dawn readers are familiar with Said's erudite and incisive writing that has graced these pages for the last few years (due largely to his long and close friendship with Eqbal), all of them may not know the full extent of his scholarship, the breadth of his interests, or the lofty position he occupies in the world of letters. To introduce Edward Said more fully, I can do no better than quote the first paragraph from Ed Vulliamy's recent article: \"To take an axe to Edward Said is to swipe at one of the more fruitful and elegant trees in the orchard of human intellect. Said is one of the leading literary theorists of our century, a commentator on music - opera in particular - a historian, pianist and political essayist. Most famously, he is the world's most instantly recognizable and tenacious exponent of the Palestinian cause. He is the living example of that maxim coined by Theodore Adamo, another radical refugee who came to New York, then from the Third Reich: 'For a man who no longer has a homeland, writing becomes a place to live'.\" In a sense, people like Said, Chomsky and Eqbal Ahmad have lived on the fringes of American academia, largely marginalized because of their fierce and unflinching support of causes that have often run counter to the mainstream. They have been far too brilliant and eloquent to completely ignore, but they are not sought out by the media for their views on the issues of the day, and nor are they invited to give their advice in the formulation of American policy.The present furore in much of the western press was triggered by an article by an unknown American-Israeli researcher called Justus Weiner published in a little-known right-wing American magazine Commentary. Basically, Weiner alleges that Said and his family were not refugees from Palestine and he had not attended the Jerusalem school that he had. In short, Said's whole life was a lie. While Weiner was 'researching' Said's life, he never once spoke to the writer. The researcher is a paid employee of the Jewish Centre for Public Affairs that is generously supported by Michael Milken, the junk-bond 'king' who was jailed in 1991. Basically, this shabby but shattering attempt to discredit Said is aimed at diminishing the Palestinian claim to the right to return to their homeland. This right, denied by the Israelis, is expected to figure largely in the negotiations on Jerusalem's final status. If Said, the most articulate and respected advocate of Palestinian rights, can be shown to be a liar, then obviously, other Palestinians can hardly be expected to be truthful about their claims. For years, Zionists have based their claim to Palestine partly on the fiction that it was an empty, barren wasteland that they have peopled, watered and made to flower. The motto of these latter-day colonialists was \"A land without a people for a people without land.\" To make this happen, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were brutally terrorized and bullied into fleeing their homes. Ultimately, history and demography have been re-written to the point where eminent Palestinian families like the Saids are being told that they did not actually have anything to do with Jerusalem. While this row engages those on both sides of the Palestinian fence, another controversy concerning Jerusalem rages at the heart of the American corporate world. It seems that the UAE has taken grave exception to a Disney display that shows Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Not having lifted a finger to prevent this from becoming a ground reality, this show of Arab indignation and empty bluster is surprising. It is true that symbols can be powerful weapons in the hands of the dispossessed, but the weak should choose their battles with care. There is no way in which Disney can afford to go against Zionist wishes and succumb to the hollow threat of an Arab boycott. These two distant but parallel events demonstrate simultaneously the weakness of the Arabs and the power Israel has come to acquire in the western establishment. Even people of goodwill can begin to doubt Said's integrity after reading an account of the controversy. Given his ongoing battle with leukemia and the fact that he does not have vast resources behind him, he cannot afford to take Weiner and Commentary to court and sue them for libel. Had Arabs been really sincere in their support of the Palestinian cause, this would have been the perfect opportunity for them to underwrite Said's legal expenses. This case - and not the futile battle against Disney - would have been worth fighting and winning. But the sad truth is that most of those who are now threatening Disney with dire consequences are very uncomfortable with educated and cultured Palestinians like Edward Said whom they regard as dangerous radicals and uncompromising democrats. Yasser Arafat and his comrades must be chuckling on learning about Said's discomfiture. For years, he has opposed the flawed peace the PLO has accepted, and has been harsh in his criticism of the Palestinian authority's undemocratic and repressive methods. In his Eqbal Ahmad Lecture titled \"Embattled landscapes, unresolved geographies\", Edward Said spoke eloquently and passionately against partitioning land to keep different peoples apart. He quoted the example, among others, of the subcontinent where although Hindus and Muslims now live in separate countries, they remain nonetheless locked in hostility. But I fear that while Palestine may still be an embattled landscape, it is now a resolved geography.

No one in the army was planning a coup. Having had its fill of knocks this year, the army command was in no mood to add to its troubles. There was accordingly no reason for the US administration to issue the statements it did admonishing the army against any extra- constitutional steps. That these statements were insulting to Pakistan is beside the point. They were plain gratuitous and quite uncalled for in the circumstances. The Americans went ahead nevertheless. One reason for this was that they were dealing with Pakistan and not a country like China. Insulting Pakistan in this fashion is a risk-free business as could be seen even in this case with not a squeak of protest from any official quarter. Indeed the army chief, who has received a crash course in diplomacy this year, was at pains to say that in the American statements the army was not mentioned. Maybe so but then are we to assume that when speaking of extra-constitutional steps the State Department had the Punjab Police in mind? As for the government, far from protesting or saying (perish the thought) that the Americans had better mind their own business, it was scarcely able to hide its glee. While it said nothing, it required no mind-reading to see that its leading lights took these statements of support as more shining examples of Shahbaz Sharif's role as a diplomatic trouble-shooter. The Punjab chief minister - who, when the history of these times is written, will be remembered as someone who excelled in every job except his own - was in Washington at the time talking to the Americans. What picture of impending doom did he sell Talbott, Inderfurth and company in order to get these statements of support? And, since the Americans usually do not offer free lunches except when they are comprehensively duped (which is not as rare as some might suppose), what was offered in return? But this is empty speculation. The main thing is that 111 Brigade was not about to move out of its barracks and head in the general direction of Islamabad. A coup was not being planned. The army as an institution was not thinking of a takeover. But the heroes of the mandate, slaves to their instincts and ever averse to letting sleeping dogs lie, were itching to manufacture another crisis. They wanted to make the army command carry the can for this summer's adventures and for this purpose were obsessed by the thought of doing another Jahangir Karamat, this time on his successor. Jahangir Karamat's successor, as even his fervid admirers will perhaps acknowledge, is no Clausewitz. But neither is he a Baji and so when the hustlers of this government, their style not much different from that of the lower ranks of the New York mafia, let out subtle hints that it was time for another move-over in Rawalpindi, the incumbent dug in his heels and refused to budge, much less to be browbeaten. This is all there was to the great crisis of confidence between GHQ and the government in Islamabad and if it has been defused it is no thanks to the Americans. This crisis was never about to get out of hand in the first place. Unless, to be sure, Ambassador Milam is privy to darker secrets than most of us are aware of. Now of course with Parvez Musharraf's confirmation as Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, for the next two years - that is, contemporaneous with his term as army chief - this tinpot crisis has come to a whimpering end. In their enlightened self-interest both the heroes of this summer's adventures remain in their respective positions. On the domestic front this is the first check Nawaz Sharif has received since the beginning of his tenure. He had his way over the 13th Amendment which stripped the president of his powers to dismiss the National Assembly and appoint the service chiefs. He saw off Leghari and Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah when the fight with the Supreme Court erupted in the latter half of 1997. General Jahangir Karamat left as army chief when his statement in support of a national security council received wide publicity. But he has not been able to have his way in the present instance. This should act as a salutary check on Nawaz Sharif's marked preference for riding roughshod over everything. Provided of course that he has learnt his lessons. Otherwise there is likely to be more of the same. It can well be asked as to why the government had to dither for so long before putting an end to the uncertainty clouding its relations with GHQ? But for the government to have acted in timely and sensible fashion would have been to betray its own hallowed style of working. Right from the start this government has displayed an unquenchable desire to first manufacture a crisis and then, when the damage is truly advanced, to be struck by doubt and vacillation. Mian Nawaz Sharif's Blair House visit is of course without any parallel in recent times since it has rewritten the rules of diplomacy. But its purpose was beguilingly simple: to control the consequences of a blunder which the prime minister himself had had a hand in creating. The purpose of Shahbaz Sharif's recent visit to Washington was no different: to solicit American help for getting out of another self-created mess: namely, relations with the army. Irony must remain the dominant quality in this entire picture. Here is a country flexing its nuclear muscles and braying from the house-tops that its defence has become impregnable (a word much beloved of the Pakistani psyche). The same country prostrates itself before the US even when it catches a minor cold. So much for sovereignty and national self-respect. And here is a prime minister whose most famous line remains that he will take dictation from no one. He is also someone who believes, and whose fawning courtiers keep reminding him in case he ever forgets, that God Almighty has made him prime minister for the performance of some great deed. While what that great deed may be is yet to be revealed, the Lord's chosen instrument has demonstrated time and again that when the going gets tough he is ever ready to take dictation from Washington. So much for self- independence. These days it is tough being a Pakistani and a proud man at the same time. As if it was not enough for the government to be making a monkey of itself before the Americans, Benazir Bhutto is doing exactly the same. Read her articles (she having become quite a journalist) and her public statements and it is clear that she is not trying to sell herself to the people of Pakistan (that, obviously, being a waste of time) but to her friends in Washington who she thinks will somehow bring her back to power. Everyone with an eye on the future is building up the dangers of fundamentalism and portraying himself or herself as the last great defender of 'liberalism' in Pakistan. To secure a handout, to get a reprieve from their troubles, or even to get a mildly sympathetic audience with some middle-ranking official in the State Department, Pakistan's representatives, in government or in opposition, will do almost anything. At least there is one consolation in this. False pride we keep only for the people of Pakistan. Abroad we present ourselves in our true colours. Anyhow, one crisis for now is over but the itch to manufacture fresh ones remains. So till the next crisis, whenever it comes, things are going to be dull in the Republic. With Benazir abroad and not likely to return in a hurry, there is only going to be Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif and the indispensable Saifur Rehman on one side (these three effectively constituting the government as we know it) and the charismatic figure of Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan on the other. Not much to take us through the cheerless winter that looms ahead.\n\n=================================================================== SPORTS 990930 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Wasim retained as captain for entire international season ------------------------------------------------------------------- Samiul Hasan KARACHI, Sept 29: Wasim Akram was retained as Pakistan captain for the entire 1999-2000 international season, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) ad hoc committee Mujeeb-ur-Rehman said here on Wednesday. Mujeeb also announced Moin Khan as his deputy for the season in which Pakistan will play Tests against Australia (three), West Indies (three) and Sri Lanka (six). Besides, Pakistan will also play a triangular series in Sharjah, Australia and West Indies. He said the ad hoc committee made the decision in the background of Pakistan's performance under Wasim Akram's leadership. Under Wasim Akram, Pakistan this year drew the two-Test series with India in India, won the Asian Test Championship, triangular series in India and Sharjah, reached the final of the World Cup and finally white-washed the West Indies in Toronto. \"Wasim and Moin make an ideal combination and we are not ready to bring changes for the sake of change. Our objective is to see Pakistan be the best team in the world and these two men are capable of fulfilling that ambition,\" he said. Akram, who later arrived for the opening ceremony of the cricket academy, said he was delighted. \"Every time I am entrusted with the job, I feel delighted. I think I am matured enough to lead Pakistan to victories in Australia and then the West Indies which has never happened in the past. \"And reason for my success is that every player gives me his best. I feel proud to captain the team which has immense talent and world class players,\" he remarked. Mujeeb, when asked that the judicial commission is yet to submit its findings to President Mohammad Rafiq Tarar, said the recommendations of Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum will be respected. Mujeeb also defend his decision to suspend Wasim alongwith Ijaz Ahmad and Salim Malik and later reinstating them. \"I suspended the three players and I am the one who lifted the suspension. But what I wanted to achieve from it, I have achieved.\" He, however, did not elaborate what was the objective behind the suspension of three players.

Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Guest appreciated the efforts of the Pakistan Sailing Federation (PASF), for promoting water sports at the National and International level. Earlier in his welcome address, the President of PSAF, Admiral S.A. Baqar, highlighted the achievements and efforts made by the Pakistani sailors and said that this was indeed a historic occasion that the country was hosting the biggest ever sailing event in the history of Pakistan. Sailors and officials from the 13 participating countries were led in a march past by the Peoples Republic of China, followed by Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Kuwait, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Pakistan's Asian gold medalist and last year's Asian Games silver medalist Lt. Cdr. Mamoon Sadiq, took the oath on behalf of the participating sailors. Pakistan losing the Enterprise gold to South Korea last year in Bangkok, made a splendid start by picking up the first two spots through Lt. Zahid and Mohammad Riaz and Lt. Cdr. Mamoon Sadiq and Shahbaz Ahmed, regulating the Asian gold medalists Yoon Gil Chung Jin and Jin Young Lim to third position. The Sri Lankan pair of Lalin Jirasinga and D. Balasorriya were fourth in the far distance with Japan's Hayakawa Naomichi and Yanga Yukiko fifth and Thailand's Vinai Vongtim and Niwat Triyot sixth. When the race began, very strong South Westerly monsoon winds blowing at over 20 knots, very unusual at this time of the year, made the sea pretty choppy. Lt. Zahid and Mohammad Riaz took the lead closely followed by the Asian gold medalists Yoon Gil Chung Jin and Jin Young Lim. Lt. Cdr. Mamoon Sadiq and Shahbaz Ahmed, strong contenders for the gold, were third. It soon became a three boat race, but Lt. Zahid and Riaz managed to hold on to their early lead. Trying every trick in the bag, Lt. Cdr. Mamoon and Shahbaz managed to pass the Korean pair and stayed in the second spot until the race was over. In the Optimist Class, the Japanese boys made an immediate impact clinching the first position through To Ian with compatriot Ishikawa Yuyu finishing a close second and Chen Chief of Chinese Tapei third. Pakistan's Shehryar Iqbal a lightweight had a hectic time in the choppy sea and was forced to retire from the race. The other participant Saad Afsar, in with a great chance for a medal, had a good start, lying a close fourth behind the two Japanese and the sailor from Chinese Taipei. Saad was moving smoothly throughout the race until his boat began to take in water and trying desperately hard to stay in contention, he began to bale out the water that cost him valuable time that sent him down to sixth position behind Joo Wan Lee of South Korea and Xu Yuan of Singapore. In the girls section, Nurul Ain of Malaysia sailing with effortless ease, bagged the top spot and was followed home by Thailand's Sasithon Isawapa and Toh Liying from Singapore. Malaysia's Nurul Maisara was fourth. Pakistan's Mariam Arshad, also vying for a medal along with Lisa Mobin, had a disasterous start lying last when the race began. But she soon recovered to move into third place behind Singapore and Malaysia. Moving comfortably, Mariam tacked but a big gust of wind caught her sail and she capsized. Righting her boat she was stalled for a long time as she began to bale out water from her boat. After about 10 minutes, Mariam continued the race and soon moved among the front runners. But with water filled into her boat once again, Mariam was stalled for the second time. After a sausage and a triangle, Mariam was in contention once again and managed to finish the race in fifth place. After Mariam capsized, Lisa moved into the second spot and just when it seemed she would take over the lead, the spirit adjuster in her boat broke and she was forced to retire from the race. Lena on the other hand competing in the European Class was a close second behind Lee Tan-Lin Chrislin from Singapore. But with the wind getting stronger she capsized. It took her about 15 minutes to right her boat again in the rough sea and the wind blowing strongly. Just when it looked that she had overcome the hazard, her boat capsized once again and she had to be picked up by the rescue boat as her boat drifted away from her. With Lena out of contention, Lee Tan-Lin Chrislin, had little difficulty in winning the race. South Korea favourites in the 420 Class in the male section, displayed their immense talent when Kyu Tae Park and Chang II Sung finished first ahead of the Hong Kong pair of Lui Kam and Tong Ping Shun. The Razak brothers Sahril and Sharul grabbed the third spot. In the Ladies section of the 420 Class, the Koreans were once again in the forefront through Suk Kyong Kim and Jung Eun Her, who pushed the Hong Kong girls Evergreen and Yan C. Han down to number two.

Saeed Anwar, Inzamamul Haq, Waqar Younis and Akram Raza denied the charges during the course of cross-examination held at the Lahore High Court, registrar Abdus Salam Khawar said from the Punjab metropolis. Rashid Latif, who has refused to retract his allegations, was also cross-examined by Tariq Raheem and Azmat Saeed, counsel of Wasim Akram and Salim Malik respectively. Arrest warrants for Zahid Fazal were issued when he failed to appear before Justice Qayyum. He has been instructed now to appear on Sept 28 along with former captain Imran Khan. The four players were summoned after Rashid Latif submitted five audio cassettes to Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum. The cassettes carried conversation regarding the alleged fixing of a match against Australia at Colombo in 1994, Salam Khawar said. In the cassette, Salim Malik was heard offering Rashid Latif to become a party to match-fixing (against Australia). Rashid informed the honourable judge that the offer was made in the presence of the five players. On the basis of the audio cassettes and Rashid's pin- pointing the players, they were summoned for cross-examination, Salam Khawar said. Salam Khawar, however, said during the cross-examination, the four players vehemently denied Rashid Latif's claim. \"During the examination, the four players said Rashid was a liar while Rashid said the similar words about the four players,\" Salam Khawar added. \"The judge had prepared certain questions after listening to the audio cassettes. Those questions were placed before the four players,\" Salam Khawar said. He said Inzamamul Haq informed Justice Qayyum that he had aggregated 175 odd runs in that tournament but could not recall his contribution in the match against Australia. Waqar Younis was questioned how many wides Wasim Akram bowled in that match. \"Waqar also couldn't recall.\" \"Saeed Anwar informed the judge that he only came to know about match-fixing through Rashid Latif. He further said that he has never been offered bribe to play badly,\" the registrar added. On the summoning of Zahid Fazal, Khawar Salam said it has been alleged that the player was 12th man in the match against Australia and allegedly carried a message from the dressing room to Saeed Anwar. Imran Khan, Salam Khawar continued, has been asked to appear to make clarifications regarding his statement. \"Since Justice Qayyum is reading all the statements as he is finalizing his report, he might have observed some discripency in Imran Khan's statement.\" On Sept 28, Tariq Raheem and Azmat Saeed will examin Rashid Latif on the basis of the audio cassettes, a copy of which was delivered to the two lawyers. Another copy of the audio cassettes has been delivered to Ata-ur- Rehman who will also appear on Sept 28 to explain his position.

In his order, Mr Justice Rasheed A. Rizvi also admitted the petition of the KCCA challenging its suspension by the PCB ad hoc committee for regular hearing. \"The (above) suit is to be fixed for regular hearing within six months for which office is directed to fix this suit for framing of issues and for hearing of other applications on Oct 7,\" Justice Rasheed ordered. Justice Rizvi also directed the KCCA to ensure holding of free and fair elections as per its bye-laws/regulations in most transparent manner and on the due date. The high court order said \"in view of the allegations of the defendants (PCB ad hoc committee), it will be open to them to take action afresh as provided in Article 37 but strictly in terms thereof and after fulfilment of the requirements of the principles of natural justice,\" Justice Rasheed said in his 17-page decision. DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 990927 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Pakistan's squash squad touches rock-bottom ------------------------------------------------------------------- A. Majid Khan Pakistan youthful squash team, captained by world number 13 Amjad Khan, had never been strong contenders for wining back the world squash team title which we had won the sixth time when it was led by Jahangir Khan in the 1993 in Karachi. The virtual capitulation in Cairo however, came as a shock as we were relegated from Division A to Division B and finished 12th in the 29-nation world championship. The 1993 team, besides Jahangir Khan, then included Jansher Khan, Zarak Jahan Khan and Mir Zaman Gul. It was a formidable combination but after the retirement of Jahangir, Pakistan lost the team title at Cairo in 1995 when Jansher Khan captained the team which included Zarak Jahan, his younger brother Zubair Jahan Khan and Mir Zaman Gul. Later on the world open champion Jansher Khan neither defended his title nor he accompanied the Pakistan team to the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur where both the World Open and the team event were staged because of a legal tangle with his ex-Malaysian wife. In 1998 Pakistan met with a great setback as Jansher Khan had both his knee operated and even after required rest he could not regain his complete fitness and form. Pakistan's new look side, with Amjad Khan, who made his first appearance at the 1997 in Kuala Lumpur world team championship, with Zubair Jahan his captain along and Umer Zaman and Kumail Mahmood, the team finished sixth and thus we remained at least in the top eight countries which form Division A. The latest performance in Cairo is the worst in the 32-year history of the team event. Now Pakistan has to regain its lost status in the Division A when the championship will be held in 2001. Sixth seeded Pakistan was placed in the four-team Group-A which included second seeded Australia, third seed Canada and ninth seed Finland, who were promoted to top eight on the basis of their 1997 championship performance. Shahid Zaman, though in the team, watched the matches from the sideline and Amjad, Mir Zaman and Mansoor played the group matches. Pakistan lost the opener to third seeded Canada by 0-3 even in the absence of world number one and top seed Jonathan Power who was injured in the world open semifinal against Ahmed Barada of Egypt, preceded by the world team championship. Amjad Khan, who had beaten world number 14 Graham Riding in last year's Pakistan open final in Karachi, suffered straight three games defeat against the Canadian. World No. 64 Mansoor Zaman after taking the opener lost to world Number 46 Kelly Patrick by 17-3 and world No. 44 Mir Zaman Gul suffered a big humiliation losing to world No. 140 Shahier Razik by 2-3 in five games. It was an unexpected defeat of Mir Zaman who was the most experienced and seasoned campaigner but betrayed lack of match fitness as he lost the fifth game at 1-9. In the second match Pakistan was defeated by former world champions and second seed Australia by 0-3. Amjad Khan was beaten in straight games by world No. 11. Dan Johnson. Immensely promising Mansoor Zaman, ranked 64th snatched a game from former world champion Rodney Eyles (world No. 12) before losing a close fight by 1-3. Australian world No. 15 Paul Rice also outplayed Mir Zaman Gul in straight games. As anticipated Pakistan disposed of Finland by 2-1 as Amjad Khan defeated world No. 30 Juha Ramumolin in straight games and Mansoor Zaman dropped a game before recording a 1-3 victory over world No. 54 Olli Tominen. However Pakistan suffered heavily when Mir Zaman Gul, (world No. 44) was defected in straight games against world No. 69 Mik Monto. Pakistan was ouster from the Division A as Finland had lost to Canada by 1-2 and we were beaten by the Canadians by 0-3. It was the first time that Pakistan suffered the humiliation of relegation. Mir Zaman Gul, who had passed his best after remaining in the international circuit for about 13 years, turned out to be a big disappointment at Cairo. It is a different matter that the seasoned players of the country compete in the minor tournaments of prize money of US dollars 10,000 and 8,000 to improve their world rankings. The Cairo championships showed that youngsters, lower in ranking, also lacked in stamina and total match fitness which they have to improve through hard training under the guidance of really committed coaches, not seeking joy ride trips. ------------------------------------------------------------------- You can subscribe to DWS by sending an email to <subscribe.dws@dawn.com>, with the following text in the BODY of your message: subscribe dws To unsubscribe, send an email to <unsubscribe.dws@dawn.com>, with the following in the BODY of you message: unsubscribe dws ------------------------------------------------------------------- Back to the top.\n\nDawn page"
