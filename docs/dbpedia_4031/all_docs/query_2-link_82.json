        "text": "By Press TV Website Staff\n\nWith just over three months left for the Paris 2014 Olympics, calls have grown louder and wider for the ban and boycott of Israel from the marquee sports competition over genocide in Gaza.\n\nHuman rights campaigners have been running a campaign that calls for a ban on the Israeli regime-affiliated teams from participating in the Paris Olympics and other international sports competitions.\n\nLast month, the Palestine Football Association (PFA) urged the world football's governing body FIFA to impose a ban on the Israeli football team amid the ongoing genocidal war in Gaza.\n\n\"The entire football infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed or severely damaged,\" read the letter. \"The loss of innocent lives, including no less than 99 footballers, the destruction of homes... Are clear violations of international law.\"\n\nThe letter came days after iconic Palestinian footballer Mohammed Barakat, who played for Ahly Gaza and Palestine national team, was killed when his house in Khan Younis city was bombed by Israel.\n\nA campaign calling for a ban on Israel from the Paris Olympics has been underway since January when more than 300 Palestinian sports clubs, youth centers, and civil society groups launched it.\n\n“We […] call on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to apply its principles and fulfill its obligations by banning Israel from the next Olympic Games to be held in Paris in July 2024, until it ends its grave violations of international law, particularly its system of apartheid and its ongoing genocide in Gaza,” said the campaign in a statement.\n\nThe Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25), a pan-European political movement founded in 2016 by a group of European politicians, also launched a petition in early January calling on sports governing bodies to suspend Israel and had already gained over 92,000 signatures last month.\n\nThe campaign has gradually picked pace but the international sports governing bodies remain unfazed, revealing blatant double standards and indifference to the genocide against Palestinians, which has already killed more than 34,000 people since October 7.\n\nAmong the victims have been at least 97 athletes, 32 officials and technicians, and 18 scouts.\n\nDozens of others have been injured and many others have been arrested and the sports infrastructure has been damaged during this period, according to the Palestinian Football Association.\n\nThe association released a list of Palestinian athletes killed, injured, and detained since October 7, 2023, by the Israeli regime. It, however, may not include the names of all victims.\n\nAthletes:\n\n1. Abdul Hafez Al-Mabhouh - Judo\n\n2. Basem Al-Nabahin - Basketball\n\n3. Nazir Al-Nashash - Football\n\n4.
