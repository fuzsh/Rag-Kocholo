        "text": "Welcome to Sports Politika, a media platform focused on the intersection of sports, power and politics. This outlet was founded by investigative journalist and researcher Karim Zidan and relies on the support of readers like you.\n\nIf you have not done so already, please consider becoming a paid subscriber. We are currently offering a 25% discount on annual subscriptions to celebrate our one year anniversary.\n\nOn Monday, April 15, the Palestinian Football Association announced that three children from the Al-Wahda Sports Academy had been killed during Israeli raids in Deir al-Balah, located in the heart of the Gaza Strip.\n\n“We announce the martyrdom of players Sami Bilal Abu Issa and Muhammad Bilal Abu Issa,” Al Wahda Academy announced on its Facebook account, which followed up by announcing the death of Adam Ramez Nabhan in another Israeli bombing. “Our hearts break for their loss.”\n\nThe three children—the youngest of whom was was four years old, with the other two aged six—are among the hundreds of Palestinian athletes who have been killed since the war broke out between Israel and Hamas on October 7, 2023.\n\nLater that same day, the PFA revealed that at least 182 athletes and sports officials had been killed amid Israel’s destruction of Gaza, including no less than 28 children.\n\nAn overwhelming number of the athletes killed were members of Gaza’s once vibrant football ecosystem. Among the notable names is Hani Al-Masdar, a former player and manager of the Olympic team, and Mohammed Barakat, Gaza’s first centurion of goals and a former national team player known as the “Legend of Khan Younis.”\n\nIsrael has also destroyed or partially dozens of football facilities in Palestine since the start of the war. These include all of Gaza’s professional football stadiums, as well as the PFA headquarters, which was also targeted by Israeli airstrikes.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller facilities and dirt pitches have been transformed into makeshift refugee camps, field hospitals, and mass graves.\n\nThe PFA has since circulated a list of Palestinian athletes killed, injured, and detained since October 7, 2023, by the Israeli regime. And though the list is not complete due to the number of bodies which remain missing or unidentified, it includes the names of 97 athletes, 32 officials and technicians, and 18 scouts. It also includes the names of injured athletes, as well as those who have been detained by the Israeli regime.\n\nThe entire list can be viewed below.\n\nAthletes:\n\n1.
