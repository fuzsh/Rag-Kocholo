This statement is\n\nmeant to fullysummarise the reason behind the outrage that arises in\n\nPakistan and other partsof the Muslim world whenever some provocative\n\n\"artist\" decides to express hisfreedom of expression and \"expose\" Muslims\n\nas anti-democratic.A simplistic interpretation of an intricate issue.Ther\n\ne is no denial - and no shame - in the fact that most Muslims hold\n\ntheirProphet in the highest regard. Despite the continued decrease in the\n\nnumber offaithful in increasingly secularised Western societies, Muslims\n\nare clinchingeven tighter to their faith. However, while the outrage over\n\nthe latesttransgression by some Facebook user and his \"Everybody Draw\n\nMohammad Day!\" mayappear as a straightforward news story - that of Western\n\nvalues vs. Muslimnarrow-mindedness - the true underpinnings of the outrage\n\nis suspiciouslymissing.The naive depiction by Western media makes it easy\n\nfor freedom of expressionenthusiasts to condemn Muslims for yet again\n\nfailing the democracy test.The latest Facebook episode is a remake of the\n\nsame old story. Someill-intended \"artist\", under the guise of freedom of\n\nspeech, takes on aconfrontational mission, knowing fully the response such\n\nan act would generate,and perhaps the lives that would be lost. Muslim\n\nmasses, predictably, res pondthrough angry protests, burning flags,\n\ndenouncing America, Israel, Zionism,Facebook, Youtube and so on.\n\nStrangely, the very governments that areconsidered US allies tend to be at\n\nthe forefront of condemning the\"blasphemous\" provocations. Muslim masses\n\nare thus exploited on all fronts: Bythe media, by anti-Muslims, by\n\nrightwing forces in the West and by their owngovernments.This, in turn,\n\ngives more ammunition to the Islamaphobes who constantly try tofan the\n\nflames in order to validate their racist perception of Muslims.The likes\n\nof Daniel Pipes, Alan Dershowitz and other \"experts\" invade TVscreens and\n\ntake on the responsibility of lecturing the world on Islam. Theyuse the\n\nsame reductionist and racist language they have utilised for yearsunder\n\nthe guise of academic jargon.Why, however, are these \"academics\" and\n\n\"intellectuals\" eager to discreditIslam? And why are Muslims playing right\n\ninto their hands?It behooves us all to remember that some of those who\n\nchampion freedom ofexpression are selective in their advocacy. Freedom of\n\nexpression becomesimportant when the holiest symbols of Islam and its\n\nProphet are paraded,ridiculed and stereotyped. However, these very\n\nadvocates are enraged when theopinions being expressed are inconsistent\n\nwith their own agenda, which isovertly militant and hegemonic, and refuse\n\nto take into consideration anyhonest opinion on Israel and its war crimes\n\nagainst the Palestinians.One needs to repeat the way respected South\n\nAfrican Judge Richard Goldstone,himself a Jew, was depicted for pointing\n\nout the horrendous crimes committed inGaza during Israel's recent war.\n\nMoreover, these individuals seem completelyoblivious when Muslims are\n\ndenied the right to express their own values.When, for example, was the\n\nlast time a rightwing fanatic stood up for a Muslimwoman's right to cover\n\nher hair or face?It must be stated, however, that discrediting Muslims and\n\nIslam is not a randomstrategy. It goes very much in tandem with an\n\noverriding agenda that hasoccupied the thinking of many rightwing and\n\nZionist ideologues for years,especially following the wars in Afghanistan\n\nand Iraq, and the rise ofanti-immigrant and anti-Muslim fervor in various\n\nWestern countries.The aim is to dehumanise Muslims, to make them seem less\n\ncivilised and thusless worthy of rights. In other words, Muslims cannot be\n\ntreated using the samestandards that apply to Westerners, because they\n\nhave failed to subscribe toWestern values.The angry protests in Pakistan\n\nare supposedly proof of this. This makes wareasy and sanctions morally\n\njustifiable.Why are Muslims playing right into this scenario? Actually,\n\nthey are not,although it would seem otherwise. The fact is that many\n\nMuslim nations arecaught between two layers of oppressions: That of\n\noutsiders - wars andoccupation, interference in their countries' affairs,\n\nall forms of humiliationand exploitation - and internal pressures -\n\ncorruption, oppress ion and denialof rights, including, yes, freedom of\n\nexpression, speech, assembly anddemocracy itself.Under these external and\n\ninternal pressures, Muslim societies embrace eventighter their everlasting\n\nIslamic symbols. Islam, for many Muslims, representsmore than just a way\n\nof life and an answer to unworldly questions. It alsoprovides hope, and it\n\nhelps maintain a level of solidarity and societalcohesion. The harder\n\npeople's lives become, the more impoverished, oppressedand abused, the\n\nstronger their faith grows.Considering all this, insulting Islam,\n\ndepicting the Prophet in degrading (orany other) ways, bashing Islamic\n\nsymbols and values is equivalent to denyingMuslim masses their last and\n\nonly chance at dignity and hope.Those who are under the impression that\n\nMuslims are opposed to freedom ofexpression are only seeing a small part\n\nof the picture. Those versed in historyunderstand that it was Muslim\n\nadvancements in science, art and literature, andtheir most impressive\n\ntransl ations of the great works of ancient civilisationsthat allowed\n\nEurope to bask in the sun of its Renaissance. Moreover, those whoare\n\nsensible enough to see the big picture will understand that when\n\naPakistani woman chants \"Death to Facebook\" - as pitiful and confusing as\n\nsuchphrase may sound - she is not actually referring to a social\n\nnetworkingwebsite. Far from it, especially since numerous Muslims have\n\nutilised Facebookto share their own ideas with the rest of the world. What\n\nthe woman is chantingagainst is the manipulation of freedom of expression\n\nto further humiliate herpeople.She is standing in solidarity with European\n\nMuslim communities who are under amost intense attack on their civil\n\nrights and liberties. She is angry at thewar in Afghanistan, the constant\n\nbombing of innocent people in Pakistan, theoccupation of Iraq, the rape of\n\nwomen and the parading of naked prisoners andthe siege in Gaza. She is\n\nangry about the Western double standards regardingdemocracy , about her\n\nown oppression and her people's misfortunes.

Dialogue: Clear Dir ection\n\nAccording to the joint statement, the US-India strategic dialogue covered\n\nwide-ranging areas, including the promotion of global security and\n\nantiterrorism, arms reduction and nuclear nonproliferation, trade and\n\neconomic relations, energy security, climate change, agriculture,\n\neducation, and science and technology.\n\nBOTh sides reemphasized their common interests and values during the\n\ndialogue, indicating that they will strengthen cooperation in security and\n\neconomic fields and will unfold cooperation in maintaining global security\n\nand promoting global economic development. The two countries will also\n\nstrengthen cooperation on Afghanistan, antiterrorism and other issues\n\nwithin bilateral and multilateral frameworks.\n\nAnalysts pointed out: The outcome of the just-ended US-India strategic\n\ndialogue lies in charting a clearer direction for the future development\n\nof bilateral relations. Both sides made it clear that their development of\n\nbilateral relations is \"of important significance to global peace,\n\nprosperity and stability in the 21st century\" which has obviously raised\n\nthe position of US-India relations. India: Hopes To See Greater Importance\n\nAttached\n\nThere was a lack of mutual trust between the United States and India\n\nduring the Cold War period in the last century. Relations between the two\n\ncountries have seen great improvements since George W. Bush visited India\n\nand signed a cooperative agreement on the civilian use of nuclear energy\n\nas president of the United States in March 2006.\n\nBefore this dialogue, some Indian media said there were signs of the\n\ncooling of US-India relations after US President Barack Obama took office\n\nlast year because India was virtually left out of the policies of the\n\nObama administration toward Afghanistan and Pakistan. The United States\n\ndoes not attach sufficient importance to India's \"position as a major\n\npower\" and overlooks the role it can play in global secur ity. Neither has\n\nit clearly indicated its support for India becoming a permanent member of\n\nthe UN Security Council.\n\nAnalysts pointed out: India's biggest hope in this dialogue was to make\n\nthe United States clearly recognize its position as a major power,\n\nrecognize that it should play a leading role in South Asia and occupy an\n\nimportant position in Asia as a whole, and hope that the United States\n\nwould pledge its support for India to become a permanent member of the UN\n\nSecurity Council.\n\nSome Indian media said at the end of the dialogue that India was quite\n\nsatisfied with the outcome of the strategic dialogue and believed that\n\nrelations between the two countries was entering a warming up period, that\n\nIndia's position as a major power was gradually being recognized by the\n\nUnited States, and that the two countries can unfold cooperation in\n\nvarious fields on a new level. United States: Appeasement and Wooing\n\nHillary Clinton said on 3 June that many Indians th ink that the United\n\nStates only sees India in the context of Afghanistan or Pakistan, while\n\nsome people in the United States think that \"India has not fully embraced\n\nits role in regional or global affairs.\"\n\nAccording to analysts, Obama was trying to appease and woo India through\n\nthis strategic dialogue. Quoting an official of the Obama administration,\n\nThe Washington Post said that Obama was trying to und erscore the fact\n\nthat the United States \"attaches importance\" to India when he \"broke\n\nconvention\" of his own accord by suggesting that he would attend and\n\naddress a reception to be given by Hillary Clinton for visiting Indian\n\nofficials on 3 June.\n\nObama's speech was full of \"highly complementary\" remarks. He said: India\n\nis indispensable to world security and prosperity and US-India relations\n\nwill become the \"decisive partnership\" for the 21st century. Obama also\n\nsaid: The partnership between the United States and India has been\n\nstrengthened like never before through the strategic dialogue mechanism\n\nand India is \"indispensable\" to the United States.\n\nUS Analysts said: The Obama administration is putting increasing emphasis\n\non diplomacy and multilateral cooperation and regards India, which has not\n\nyet signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as an\n\n\"important player\" in US efforts to address many global issues. India is\n\nof great importance to the United States in the fight against extremists\n\nin Afghanistan and Pakistan and plays an important role in global trade\n\nand climate change.\n\nHowever, some analysts also pointed out: Although there are many common\n\ninterests between the United States and India in international and\n\nmultilateral spheres. India is still skeptical and has reservations about\n\nthe strategic intentions of the United States in South Asia. Although\n\nthere are points in common between the two countries in their actual inter\n\nests in Asia, there is still wrestling, both overt and covert, between\n\nthem.\n\n(Description of Source: Beijing Xinhua Domestic Service in Chinese --\n\nChina's official news service (New China News Agency))\n\nMaterial in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the\n\nsource cited.

Pakistan will now be more hopeful than\n\never about gaining a strategic debt in Afghanistan and using the Afghan\n\nissue for its interests. It will be able to manoeuvre in a larger arena\n\nunopposed.These two senior government officials quit so that the armed\n\ngovernment opposition could see the government's green light more clearly\n\nand extract more concessions.However, it can be claimed with certainty\n\nthat this step will not be enough for the hungry wolf of terrorism and it\n\nwill demand more sacrifices from the nation even if sacrifices include\n\njustice.The problem does not lie in individuals and key positions. The\n\nproblem stems from the lack of desire and will of the president and the\n\nmental illness of th e political system to prevent this fatal disease. It\n\nis clear that Mr Karzai wants to restore peace. However, the tools and\n\nmethods he is using to achieve this objective are inappropriate, emotional\n\nand unrealistic. For example, the most recently held consultative peace\n\njerga was opposed more and more and claimed more sacrifices with the\n\npassage of time.We are grateful to the courage and bravery of security\n\nofficials and hope that the president will also force persons close to the\n\ngovernment and civil servants whose complacency and incompetence have\n\nseverely damaged the government's reputation and harmed our national\n\ninterests to quit. This, as Mr Saleh has said, will shake the system and\n\nforce those who have monopolized political power and plundered wealth to\n\nvacate their positions for more qualified and deserving\n\npersons.(Description of Source: Kabul Cheragh (Light) in Dari --\n\nEight-page independent daily, publishes political, social and cultural\n\narticles; sometimes critic al of the government)\n\nMaterial in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the\n\nsource cited.

Consequently, it emphasises the importance of\n\nengaging foreign powers for advancing US interests instead of relying\n\nprimarily on the American power to realise its strategic objective s. This\n\nis in marked contrast with the Bush administration's cowboy foreign policy\n\nwhich de-emphasised the need for engaging foreign countries and relied on\n\nthe use of the American military power in the pursuit of the US strategic\n\ngoals. President Obama also appears to have watered down the doctrine of\n\nunilateral pre-emptive military intervention which was the linchpin of his\n\npredecessor's National Security Strategy. While the Obama administration\n\nreserves the right to act unilaterally, if necessary, after exhausting\n\nother options, it gives the assurance that such unilateral actions would\n\nconform to standards that govern the use of force. Thus, Obama's National\n\nSecurity Strategy on the face of it constitutes a refreshing change from\n\nthe bull-in-a-china shop type of diplomacy pursued by his predecessor, as\n\nevidenced by his invasion of Iraq and his handling of the war in\n\nAfghanistan.\n\nThere is no denying the fact that the US by far remains the greatest\n\nmilitary and econo mic power globally. Its economy accounts for roughly a\n\nquarter of the world GDP. Notwithstanding its relative economic decline\n\nbecause of the rapid economic growth of other countries like China and\n\nIndia, the US will maintain its dominant economic position in the world in\n\nthe first half of the 21st century and may be even later for quite some\n\ntime. The Chinese economy will catch up with the US economy in dollar\n\nterms only by the middle of the 21st century. But the US GDP per capita\n\nwill still remain far ahead of that of China both in dollar and purchasing\n\npower parity terms. The US is the most powerful military power currently\n\nand the only country which has the capability to project its military\n\npower in the remote corners of the world. The US advantage over others is\n\nmultiplied if one takes into account its commanding position in what\n\nJoseph S. Nye, Jr., calls the soft power. So it would be a serious mistake\n\nto minimise the importance of the US in the foreign policy calcula tions\n\nof any country including Pakistan.\n\nWhile the US is likely to remain the most powerful country in the world in\n\nthe foreseeable future, it is faced with several emerging challengers, the\n\nmost important of whom is China which has recorded economic growth rates\n\nof over nine percent a year for almost three decades. Besides China, other\n\ncountries whose economies have done well include Brazil, India, South\n\nKorea, Russia and South Africa. If one takes into account these economies\n\nas well as those of Japan and Germany, it should be obvious to any\n\nobserver that economically speaking the world is already multipolar. In\n\nthe military field also, the balance will slowly change to the\n\ndisadvantage of the US as other major powers, particularly China, increase\n\ntheir military expenditures to reflect their growing economic strength and\n\nto protect their expanding global economic interests.\n\nAs the relative economic and military strength of the US changes to its\n\ndisadvantage a nd the power of its competitors' increases, the\n\ninternational order will inevitably undergo a fundamental change\n\ndiminishing gradually the US ability to impose its will on the rest of the\n\ninternational community and to influence international events. This trend\n\nwill manifest itself in structural changes in international security,\n\neconomic and commercial institutions to reflect the changed global\n\neconomic and military realities. In some ways this process has already\n\nbegun as evidenced by the Chinese demand for a new international reserve\n\ncurrency, the growing importance of G-20 and the demand for the reform of\n\nthe UN Security Council. It is, therefore, a strategic imperative for the\n\nUS to bring its foreign policy objectives within the reach of its power by\n\nlowering its sights, by emphasising the use of political or diplomatic\n\nmeans over the use of military for their realisation and by carrying the\n\ninternational community with it rather than working in defiance of its\n\nwill. Th e US inability to recognise the limitations of its power may lead\n\nit to misadventures like the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and confront the\n\ninternational community with one crisis after another.\n\nThe perusal of President Obama's National Security Strategy shows that the\n\nUS is in the process of absorbing the implications of the limitations of\n\nits power. This is shown by the emphasis it places on the use of\n\ndiplomacy, the engagement of the international community, the adherence to\n\nuniversal values and the need for the modernisation of international\n\ninstitutions, the strengthening of international norms and the enforcement\n\nof international law in the conduct of the US foreign policy. It calls for\n\nespecially close interaction with what it calls the \"key centres of\n\ninfluence\" in the 21st century including China, India and Russia. It also\n\nrecognises the importance of close relations with growing economies like\n\nBrazil, South Africa and Indonesia.\n\nAs for terroris m, Obama's National Security Strategy lays down the broad\n\nobjective of disrupting, dismantling and defeating Al-Qaeda and its\n\nviolent extremist affiliates. The strategy urges that in Afghanistan the\n\nUS should deny Al-Qaeda a safe haven and deny the Taliban the ability to\n\noverthrow the Afghan government. It also mentions the ongoing cooperation\n\nbetween the US and Pakistan in addressing the local, regional and global\n\nthreat from violent extremists. While the US resolve to defeat Al-Qaeda as\n\na terrorist organisation and prevent another terrorist attack on the US\n\nfrom Afghanistan is unexceptionable, it seems that Washington is also\n\ntrying to impose a government of its own choice on the Afghan people in\n\ndisregard of the ethnic and tribal composition in Afghanistan, the social\n\nand cultural values of the Afghan people, and the compulsions of the\n\nregional security environment. Similar efforts by the British and the\n\nSoviet Union to bring Afghanistan under their control failed earlier .\n\nIran and Pakistan faced the same experience in 1990's in their misguided\n\nattempts to support and establish governments of their choice in\n\nAfghanistan. The US, despite its superiority in military and economic\n\npower, is likely to meet the same fate unless it changes course.\n\nIt appears that the implications of the limitations of the US power and\n\nthe past Afghan history have not fully sunk in the consciousness of the\n\nAmerican foreign policy and security establishment. What the objective of\n\ndurable peace in Afghanistan demands is not the imposition of a government\n\nof Washington's choice on the Afghan people through the use of force but\n\nrather national reconciliation in Afghanistan and the establishment of a\n\nnew political order in which the different Afghan ethnic communities and\n\ntribes including the Pashtuns, the Tajiks, the Hazaras and others get\n\ntheir due share in power. This requires political engagement rather than\n\nthe use of brute force as the US appears to be doing .\n\nThe writer is a retired ambassador.\n\n(Description of Source: Islamabad The Nation Online in English -- Website\n\nof a conservative daily, part of the Nawa-i-Waqt publishing group.\n\nCirculation around 20,000; URL: http://www.nation.com.pk)\n\nMaterial in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the\n\nsource cited.

He added that the\n\nIsraeli government was allowing only 25 percent of the required food items\n\nthere.\n\nJI Vice President Sirajul Haq urged President Zardari, Prime Minister\n\nYusuf Raza Gilani and all the political party leaders to follow Turkish\n\nPrime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and announce taking relief goods to Gaza.\n\nHe said revival of the alliance of religious parties in the prevailing\n\ncircumstances was indispensable, adding that the alliance should not be\n\naimed at formation of the government but for the supremacy of Islam.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, senior member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl Hafiz\n\nHussain Ahmad said Darul Uloom Haqqania, Akora Khattak, had no link with\n\nthe assassination of Benazir Bhutto, but such evidences could be traced to\n\nthe President House.\n\nHe warned if any seminary was targetted, the entire religious forces would\n\nstand up in its support. He alleged the US had opened a new front against\n\nthe religious seminaries, which is why accusations are being levelled\n\nagainst Darul Uloom Haqqania.\n\nThe JUI-F leader also criticised M ian Nawaz Sharif for his statement in\n\nsupport of Qadianis. \"Mian Sahib does not think before he speaks. He\n\ntermed Qadianis as his brothers and now he is regretting it,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed the need for reunification of the religious parties.

NSS seeks to purport the US perspective on its\n\nimmediate and long term goals in the international arena and, auditing its\n\nnational capabilities and foreign policies in order to achieve these\n\ngoals. Such a document - the 2010 NSS - under the new administration of\n\nPresident Obama has just been released. The 2010 NSS is important because\n\nof the excruciating nature of the contemporary period. The US is fighting\n\nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and is also engaged in state building\n\nefforts in these countries. Moreover, the 2008 global financial crisis has\n\nhad a crippling effect on the US economy, currently suffering under a debt\n\nof more than 10 trillion dollars. It is further complicated by issues such\n\nas non-proliferation, climate change and food security. Moreover, the\n\nperiod of relative decline of the US is concomitant with the rise of other\n\ncenters of power such as India and China.\n\nThe NSS of President Obama is significantly different from that of\n\nPresident Bush. The document portrays a picture of a self-reflective US\n\nwhich understands its own strategic limits. The stress on economic\n\nresuscitation, invocation of international institutions and norms of\n\nbehavior and, multilateral approaches to solve international problems\n\nprovide a glimpse of the shift from the neo-conservative agenda of his\n\npredecessor. It also, unlike the hard-headed militaristic approach of\n\nPresident Bush, undermines excessive use of force. In clear terms, it\n\nlaments the flawed approach of the earlier administration saying \"over the\n\nyears, some methods employed in pursuit of our security have compromised\n\nour fidelity to the values we promote, and our leadership on their\n\nbehalf.\"\n\nHowever, from an Indian standpoint, three issues which the NSS addressed\n\nare crucial. First is the ongoing strategic engagement between the two\n\ncountries and its future trajectories. The NSS has called India, along\n\nwith China and Russia, as one of the '21st Century Centers of Influence',\n\na clear recognition of the growing stature and role of India in the\n\ncontemporary global order. Invoking the 'shared interests and shared\n\nvalues' of the two nations, underpinned by their democratic credentials,\n\nthe document seeks to build on the strategic partnership whose foundat\n\nions were laid by President Bush. This is also evident in Under-Secretary\n\nBurns' speech at the Council of Foreign Relations on the eve of the\n\nIndo-US strategic dialogue. NSS seeks India to contribute to \"global\n\ncounterterrorism efforts, non-proliferation, and help promote\n\npoverty-reduction, education, health and sustainable agriculture.\"\n\nSecond, is the Af-Pak policy. Underlining the grave threat which terrorist\n\norganizations such as al Qaeda pose to the US national security and\n\ninternational peace, it calls the region the 'epicenter of violent\n\nextremism practiced by al Qaeda'. It clearly states that \"al Qaeda's core\n\nin Pakistan remains the most dangerous component of its larger network\".\n\nHowever, the NSS has solely focused on al Qaeda leaving out any mention of\n\nvarious proxy organizations which work on its behalf. This is problematic\n\nfor India, since terrorist organizations such as Jaish-e Mohammed and\n\nLashkar-e -Taiba, operational in Paki stan, have inextricable links with\n\nal Qaeda. The report also commits the US to long term engagement in the\n\nAf-Pak region. State-building in Afghanistan and democracy promotion in\n\nPakistan are two important components of this extended engagement program.\n\nIt also commits the US to foster Pakistan's capacity to target violent\n\nextremists within its borders which clearly means that Pakistan's military\n\nwill be a key constituency in this region. However, this leads to a\n\ncontradiction since any strengthening of democracy would be antithetical\n\nto the interest of the military, as has been the case in the history of\n\nPakistan. In all, if that is so, the US trying to walk on a very thin\n\nrope.\n\nThe final issue is concerning China. The report acknowledges the\n\nleadership role of China at the world stage. It seeks to cooperate with\n\nthe Asian giant on areas such as global economic recovery, climate change\n\nand nonproliferation. The report also states clearly that the US has ce\n\nrtain disagreements with China, especially mentioning the issue of Human\n\nRights and proclaims that the US will not hesitate in expressing its\n\nreservations on the same. On the surface, the US may portray a picture of\n\nnot compromising when it comes to its core values of Human Rights and\n\nDemocracy. However, in reality, the US is in no position to take a very\n\ndetermined stand on these issues in wake of its strategic limitations in\n\nthe contemporary period.\n\nThe NSS has emphasized upon the importance of the Indo-US strategic\n\nrelationship calling the two countries partners in the global arena. The\n\nNSS not only recognized India as an emerging leader but also tried to\n\nclearly delineate the responsibilities such a scenario brings forth. To\n\nthis effect it stated \"we value India's growing leadership on a wide array\n\nof global issues, through groups such as the G-20 and will seek to work\n\nwith India to promote stability in South Asia and the world.\"\n\n(Descripti on of Source: New Delhi Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies\n\nOnline in English -- Website of independent think tank devoted to studying\n\nsecurity issues relating to South Asia.
