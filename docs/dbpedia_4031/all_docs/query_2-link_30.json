        "text": "Younis was a Watson College faculty member from 2004–13, and taught at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) from 2013–21.\n\nWhat’s it like to return to Binghamton?\n\nFor my family and me, Binghamton has always been our home, and that is why we stayed connected with the area, the people and the University through the years during our overseas spell. When we decided to move back, it felt like returning home after a long trip.\n\nWhat’s been the biggest change while you were gone?\n\nThe expansion of the campus at the new engineering complex looked astonishing to us. To see this growth in the buildings, facilities and people in that complex in less than a decade is truly amazing.\n\nWhat’s the biggest difference between teaching in Saudi Arabia versus the U.S.?\n\nObviously where I was, KAUST, you get to see a different pool of people of different cultural backgrounds. Binghamton itself is known to be very diverse, so it was interesting to see another example of a diverse campus but with more influences from Europe, the East and the Middle East.\n\nWhat did you miss most about Binghamton and Watson College?\n\nThe family environment. Despite the college’s growth, it has been nice for me to see that the college kept its warm family feeling, where everyone feels connected and knows everyone. People here are very supportive and welcoming. Yes, the weather here is much colder than where I came from, but the warm feelings of being surrounded by nice, energetic people is unique and rarely found elsewhere."
