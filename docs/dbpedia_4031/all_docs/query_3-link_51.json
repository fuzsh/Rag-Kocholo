        "text": "Michael Trick, Dean\n\nDudley Reynolds, Senior Associate Dean for Education\n\nUndergraduate Programs Office: CMB 1101\n\nwww.qatar.cmu.edu\n\nCarnegie Mellon University in Qatar is Carnegie Mellon's first and only undergraduate branch campus. Since 2004, it exists as part of a collaborative effort with the Qatar Foundation to bring outstanding American educational programs to the Middle East.\n\nDegree Offerings\n\nCarnegie Mellon University in Qatar offers four academic programs: Biological Sciences, Business Administration, Computer Science, and Information Systems. To examine the requirements for those degrees, see their respective main campus college sections elsewhere in the Undergraduate Catalog. The purpose of this section is to describe the CMU-Q policies that are independent from those of the Pittsburgh campus and outline procedures that are common to students in all programs in Qatar.\n\nMajor Sample Schedules\n\nSample schedules for how CMU-Q students normally track through the academic programs can be found on the CMU-Q website as follows:\n\nBiological Sciences\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nComputer Science\n\nInformation Systems\n\nBusiness Administration Concentrations\n\nThe concentration allows students to gain knowledge and expertise in a particular area of business practice. The concentration coursework prepares students with the knowledge and skills for their career pursuits. Completing a concentration is part of the degree requirements. Students are encouraged to declare their concentration by the end of their sophomore year.\n\nCourses taken to meet concentration requirements are not allowed to double count toward any other BA degree requirements, including the minor requirement. The following concentrations may be completed at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar:\n\nAccounting\n\nBusiness Analytics and Technologies\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nFinance\n\nGlobal Economics and Business\n\nMarketing Management\n\nOperations Management\n\nStrategic Management\n\nInformation Systems Concentrations\n\nAs an Information Systems major, you will select a focused concentration to provide a deep dive into a subject that interests you consisting of a minimum of three 9 unit courses and a 12 unit project or research course (39 units total). Currently approved IS Concentrations on the Qatar campus include:\n\nInformation Security & Privacy\n\nThe Information Security & Privacy concentration is designed to expose students to the key technical, process, and policy aspects related to information security and associated privacy concerns. The student who completes this concentration will have a solid foundation in the area and will be prepared to continue developing expertise through graduate school or their professional career.\n\nData Science\n\nThe Data Science concentration is designed to capitalize on the continuously expanding quantity of data generated through our interconnected information systems and prepares the student to understand how to store, process, retrieve, and analyze data to derive insights and improve decision making for individuals, organizations, and society. The foundation developed in this concentration prepares the graduate to assist organizations to capitalize on the data they generate as well as to support research projects either as a graduate student or within their chosen profession.\n\nDigitization\n\nThe Digitization concentration is designed to prepare the student to understand and effectively innovate with information systems to support entrepreneurship, organizations, or society. The graduate with this concentration will often find themselves working in a larger organization or creating new organizations that capitalize on the benefits of information and information systems.\n\nIn addition to the approved concentrations, a student may choose to instead complete an approved minor or second major, or work with their advisor to develop a plan for an independent concentration.\n\nAdditional Major in Information Systems\n\nStudents who elect Information Systems as an additional major must fulfill all Information Systems degree requirements, including prerequisites, Professional Core, Disciplinary Core, and Concentration Area requirements. With respect to double-counting courses, the program will allow up to two courses to count between the additional major and a primary major. Students should begin planning their additional major as early as possible, as the Information Systems core courses are sequential, and are often the constraining resource for completion of the major.\n\nOnly one course can be double-counted between the Information Systems major and a minor.\n\nMinors\n\nIn addition to the major degree programs, Carnegie Mellon also offers a number of minors. Minors typically consist of six courses that provide the student with substantial exposure to the core of that academic discipline. As with the major programs, the requirements of these minors are set by their respective departments on the main campus:\n\nArabic Studies (advisor: Ezzohra Moufid )\n\nBiological Sciences (advisor: Mohamed Bouaouina)\n\nBusiness Administration (advisor: Serkan Akguc)\n\nCognitive Neuroscience (advisor: Jennifer Bruder)\n\nComputational Biology (advisor: Giselle Reis)\n\nComputer Science (advisor: Giselle Reis)\n\nEconomics (advisor: Agustin Indaco)\n\nGlobal Systems and Management (advisor: Daniel Phelps)\n\nHistory (advisor: Ben Reilly)\n\nInformation Systems (advisor: Daniel Phelps) [only offered in Qatar]\n\nMathematical Sciences (advisor: Hasan Demirkoparan)\n\nMedia and Politics (advisor: Kira Dreher)\n\nMultidisciplinary Energy Studies (advisor: Serkan Akguc) [only offered in Qatar]\n\nNeuroscience (advisor: Nesrine Affara)\n\nProfessional Writing (advisor: Thomas Mitchell)\n\nPsychology (advisor: Jennifer Bruder)\n\nTech Entrepreneurship (advisor: Nui Vatanasakdakul)\n\nAcademic Standards and Actions\n\nAcademic Standards\n\nCarnegie Mellon University in Qatar complies with common University policies unless otherwise noted. The curriculum requirements for the Biological Sciences, Business Administration, Computer Science and Computational Biology, and Information Systems majors are set by the respective departments of the Mellon College of Science, Tepper School of Business, the School of Computer Science, and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy on the main campus. At the university level, the same academic standards, policies, and actions apply to all programs at CMU-Q as at the Pittsburgh campus.\n\nGraduation Requirements\n\nResidency\n\nCandidates for a Bachelor's degree must complete a minimum of four semesters of full-time study, or equivalent part-time study, comprising at least 180 units of coursework at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nCumulative QPA\n\nTo be eligible to graduate, undergraduate students must complete all course requirements for their program with a cumulative Quality Point Average of at least 2.0 for all courses taken. For undergraduate students who enrolled at Carnegie Mellon as first-year students and whose first-year grades cause the cumulative QPA to fall below 2.0, this requirement is modified to be a cumulative QPA of at least 2.0 for all courses taken after the first year. Note, however, the cumulative QPA that appears on students' final transcript will be calculated based on all grades in all courses taken, including the first year. Some programs may have additional QPA requirements in order to graduate. Students are encouraged to confirm all graduation requirements with their academic advisor.\n\nUniversity Honors\n\nStudents maintaining a cumulative QPA of at least 3.5 after seven semesters of full-time enrollment (consecutive or otherwise) or raising their QPA to 3.5 upon completing their graduation requirements in their final semester will graduate with University Honors.\n\nDean's List\n\nStudents earn Dean's List recognition in a given semester by achieving one of two minimum standards. They must either 1) earn a semester QPA of 3.75 or higher (while taking at least 36 factorable units and receiving no incomplete grades), or 2) earn a semester QPA of 3.50 or higher (while taking at least 45 factorable units and receiving no incomplete grades). The CMU-Q Dean's List is calculated uniformly for all students across all majors and may differ from criteria followed for these majors on the Pittsburgh campus, where the criteria vary across colleges.\n\nAcademic Actions\n\nAcademic Actions are a part of a process designed to help students who are not meeting standards for satisfactory academic progress be successful. Students will be informed by a letter from the Senior Associate Dean for Education if an academic action has been taken in their regard. The letter will identify individuals and resources that can help them address barriers to their success. Academic Actions may be taken for students carrying either a full-time course load (defined as 36 or more units) or a part-time course load (defined as fewer than 36 units).\n\nFailure to Meet Minimum Standards\n\nAcademic Actions may be taken if students fail to meet minimum standards toward their degree, defined as follows:\n\nFirst-year students: a semester QPA of at least 1.75.\n\nBeyond the first year: a semester QPA and a cumulative QPA (excluding the first year) of at least 2.0.\n\nStudents who begin a semester enrolled in 36 or more units and later drop below 36 units are subject to academic actions regardless of their semester QPA.\n\nProbation\n\nProbation occurs when a student's semester record fails to meet the minimum standards described above. The term of a probation is one semester as a full-time student. Students will return to good academic standing if they complete at least 36 units under the following circumstances:\n\nFor a first-year student, probation is removed at the end of the second semester if the second semester’s QPA is 1.75 or above.\n\nFor students in the third or subsequent semesters, probation is removed if they raise their cumulative QPA above 2.00, and achieve a semester QPA of 2.0 or higher (excluding the first year).\n\nProbation Continued\n\nOccasionally, a student's probation may be continued if the student's cumulative record does not meet minimum standards, but his or her semester record suggests that the student may do so by the end of the next semester. This action is normally taken only when a student's semester QPA is above 2.0 but their cumulative QPA is not yet above 2.0.\n\nSuspension\n\nA student who fails to meet the minimum standards described above at the end of the probation semester may be suspended.\n\nA first-year student may be suspended if the QPA from each semester is below 1.75.\n\nA student in the third or subsequent semester of study may be suspended if the semester QPA or the cumulative QPA (excluding the first year) is below 2.00 for two consecutive semesters.\n\nSuspension is typically for a minimum of one year. While on academic suspension, students are considered to be on a mandatory \"leave of absence\" and are governed by College and University policies concerning leaves of absence. Per university policy, students on suspension may not attend classes, live in university-related housing, or have on-campus employment.\n\nAt the end of their suspension period, the student may petition to return to CMU-Q by:\n\nsubmitting a petition to Return from Leave of Absence form to the Enrollment Services Manager in Qatar;\n\nproviding evidence in writing to the Senior Associate Dean for Education that they have fulfilled return conditions specified in the letter informing them of their suspension (if any) and have taken convincing steps to ameliorate the cause of the suspension. The student must demonstrate that they are better prepared to perform above the minimum standards for graduation than before they were suspended; and\n\nresolving any outstanding financial obligations.\n\nStudents will be notified by the University Registrar’s Office once their petition has been approved and their enrollment status has been updated to “eligible to enroll.” Students coming back from suspension are placed on Probation for the semester of their return.\n\nDrop\n\nA student who fails to meet minimum standards at any point after returning from a suspension is subject to a drop action. A drop action is a permanent severance; the student is required to follow University procedures for departing from campus and may not enroll again in the future.\n\nThe typical progression of academic actions is Probation, Suspension, then Drop. Because the intent of all academic actions is to take measures that are in the student's best interest, the school may bypass one or more of these steps in an unusual case and suspend or drop a student without prior probation.\n\nOther Regulations Affecting Student Status\n\nAdding a Class\n\nStudents may add classes to their schedule under the following rules:\n\na full-semester course through the first 10 class days of the semester.\n\na half-semester (mini) course may be added through the first 5 class days of the half-semester when the course is offered.\n\nDropping/Withdrawing from a Class\n\nStudents may drop or withdraw from a class as prescribed by the university’s policy for doing so: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html\n\nCourse Overloads\n\nA maximum load for a CMU-Q student is 51 units. In order to overload (i.e., take more than 51 units but no more than 63), a student must have attained a QPA of at least 3.0 in the previous semester, or have a cumulative QPA of 3.0. Approval by the student's advisor is required to upload up to the maximum (63 units). A student wishing to pursue more than 63 units must petition the Senior Associate Dean for Education to do so.\n\nNon-Carnegie Mellon Courses\n\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon transcript will include information on such courses as follows:\n\nCarnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university’s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA.\n\nAll other courses will be recorded on the transcript indicating where the course was taken, but no grade will be reported. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.\n\nNote: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere with prior approval; however, they will not receive transfer credit.\n\nCross Registration\n\nCourses offered for cross-registration are those taken through an agreement with Texas A&M University at Qatar; Georgetown School of Foreign Service in Qatar; Northwestern University in Qatar; Virginia Commonwealth University in Qatar; and Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar. Full-time students at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar can take up to one class a semester at these schools. Cross-registration requires the completion of a cross-registration form with the appropriate signatures from the home and host institutions. Completion of the form does not guarantee a space in the requested course. The cross-registration agreement only applies during the regular academic year; normal course transfer rules apply in the summer.\n\nCourse Transfer\n\nStudents may receive credit for courses taken outside of Carnegie Mellon if they successfully petition the Senior Associate Dean for Education in advance for permission. Students must take these courses for a letter grade and instruction must be in English for non-language courses. Credit (but not the grade) will normally transfer for courses with a grade equivalent to at least a “B.” The class's course description must be a close match to a Carnegie Mellon course or material covered in a range of Carnegie Mellon courses and from an accredited institution. Students may not receive credit for any courses taken on-line unless there is some safeguard to ensure that the actual student took the course (e.g., a proctored final taken under supervision at CMU-Q).\n\nStudents may not receive credit for more than five non-CMU courses during their undergraduate career as a Carnegie Mellon student. Classes taken prior to enrolling in Carnegie Mellon, during study abroad semesters, and as cross-registration with other Education City schools do not count toward the course transfer limit. All students must meet the University's residency requirement of completing at least 180 units of Carnegie Mellon coursework.\n\nCampus Exchange and Transfer\n\nCampus Exchange\n\nCMU-Q and Pittsburgh students in good academic standing (not on Probation/Suspension) may study on the other campus for one semester on a space available basis and with the approval of both the home and host departments. Space constraints on both campuses may force programs to limit the number of students who can exchange in any given semester. CMU-Q students may study abroad for a second semester at another institution (not CMU Pittsburgh) if an appropriate additional study abroad opportunity arises and their academic advisor agrees.\n\nSummer studies in Pittsburgh are not subject to any constraint other than not being on Suspension or Leave of Absence.\n\nTransfer\n\nInternally between majors at CMU-Q\n\nStudents may transfer between majors at CMU-Q on a space-available and academic performance basis. Students interested in transferring should consult with the Senior Associate Dean for Education and the Area Head of the new major. First-year students may not apply for transfer until they receive their spring mid-semester grades.\n\nBetween CMU-Q and Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh\n\nDecisions about transfers to any major in Pittsburgh will be made by the receiving department in conjunction with the Vice-Provost for Education. Transfers are only possible under specific conditions and for study beginning in a fall semester. Students interested in transferring to a major in Pittsburgh the following academic year should consult with the Senior Associate Dean for Education in Qatar as early as possible in order to understand the conditions and process for applying.\n\nTransfers to CMU-Q from other Universities\n\nTransfer students from other universities must apply through the Admissions Office at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar. The Admissions Office, the Senior Associate Dean for Education, and the Area Head for the desired program will determine if there is space available and if the student's past academic performance warrants admission."
