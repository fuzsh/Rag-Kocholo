With resources vast, a land of gold, and precious gems in its hold, Africa's wealth, a sight to behold, a tapestry of stories yet untold. From the earth's deep veins, it gives its gold, Chromium, platinum, treasures to be sold. Cobalt, diamonds, in abundance, they're found, In Africa's sacred ground, where wealth does abound. In its embrace, a bounty of arable land, Where fertile soil meets the farmer's hand. A cradle of life, where rivers gently flow, Freshwater sources, a gift from nature's flow. Soccer's rhythm, Africa's heart does beat, In every corner, in every street. Players of skill, with talent so immense, Grace Europe's fields, in a global dance. But a question lingers, an unspoken plea, Why do African coaches find it hard to be free? To share their wisdom, their football creed, In Europe's leagues, where dreams take seed. Imagine a world where African might, Stadiums gleam, a breathtaking sight. Players paid as equals, their talents prized, In Africa's leagues, where dreams realized. No more reliance on foreign shores, To teach our youth, to open doors. Champions league, where stars align, In Africa's glory, they all will shine. Thomas Partey in South Africa's sway, Mo Salah in Al Ahly's array. A continent united, as one they stand, In Africa's embrace, a new dreamland. With Dr. Motsepe and CAF's might, We'll see the day, we'll take the flight. To rise above, to break the chain, In Africa's glory, we'll reclaim the reign. Imagine Kylian Mbappe in our embrace, Neymar dreaming of an African place. It's time for Africa, the world to see, The dreams we hold, the possibilities. In unity, strength, and boundless grace, Africa's rise, a glorious embrace. A continent's dream, a future bright, In Africa's heart, we'll reach new heights. So let's believe in what can be, In Africa's rise, in unity. A continent's dream, a destiny, In Africa's embrace, we shall be free.

We need move move beyond surface dynamics of partnership rhetoric and explore what is going on beneath to gain a balanced perspective 📄The article presents a new theoretical framework which enables scholars to theorize and critically reflect on constraining issues of power (e.g. neo-colonial, asymmetrical power relations) as well as enabling manifestations of power (e.g. social capital) and unpack a more holistic understanding power in future research #sportfordevelopment #sportbusiness #sportmanagement #international #partnerships #power #powerto #powerover Carnegie School Of Sport\n\n\"Football in the Balkans I: Internal Views, External Perceptions\", eds. D. Wojtaszyn, M. Melichárek is the 8th volume in the series South-East European History, edited by Mihai Dragnea and published by Peter Lang on behalf of the Balkan History Association (BHA). The volume is devoted to the phenomenon of football in the Balkans and provides an interdisciplinary perspective on the political instrumentalization of football and its social significance in the region. In doing so, it offers readers an in-depth look at Balkan societies and the determinants of their political and social functioning. The topics are geographically wide-ranging, covering Greece, Romania, the former Yugoslavia and the states that emerged from its disintegration: Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Across these regions, the contributors cover issues including the legitimacy of power, political manipulation, problems of political transition, corruption, collective identity, nationalism and antagonism between the Balkan nations, and armed conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Collectively they offer a number of fresh perspectives in conveying a sense of the complexity and diverse historical experiences of football across the Balkans. The volume which is a project of the Balkan History Association is aimed at a wide academic audience as well as journalists, analysts, and enthusiasts of sport and the Balkans. A second volume focusing on other neighboring areas (“Football in the Balkans II: A Social and Political Phenomenon”) is in preparation. Table of Contents Football between History, Politics, Society, and Culture: Introduction (Dariusz Wojtaszyn, Maroš Melichárek) A Popular Game in Dracula’s Land? A Socio-Historical Overview of Romanian Football (Andrei Antonie) From Commons to Commodity and Back Again: Football’s Great Transformation in Post-socialist Romania (Răzvan Papasima) Yugoslav Football from Tito’s Death to the Breakup of Yugoslavia: Situation and Problems in the Climate of Political Conflict (Davor Kovačić) Football and Politicians: Tito, Tuđman, and Milošević and Their Political Instrumentalization of the Social Phenomenon of Football (Maciej Górski) Competing for the Nation on the Football Pitch: Ideology and Sports in Mostar (Giordano Merlicco, Danilo Kovač, Luca Alteri) Greek Football of the 70s and 80s in the Memories of Polish Coaches and Footballers (Artur Pasko) The Odyssey of Greek Football: Politics, Corruption and the Spirit of Division (Theofilos Pouliopoulos) Conclusions (Dariusz Wojtaszyn, Maroš Melichárek) https://lnkd.in/dMXEXuBp\n\n2024 Conference heads up - Political Studies Association: Sport and Politics - (21-22 March 2024) Call for Abstracts The Moray House School of Education and Sport at the University of Edinburgh is pleased to announce that we will host the 2024 Political Studies Association (PSA) Sport and Politics Group annual conference on 21-22 March. The theme of this conference is “Sport in the Age of Geopolitical Crisis”. The neoliberal international order has been facing challenges from several fronts, and this situation is escalating the level of conflict in different regions. The recent wars in Ukraine and Israel and the military tensions in the South China Sea represent the current world politics in flux. Sport is, by no means, immune to such a political climate. 2024 is the year of the Summer Olympic Games, and the IOC is still debating the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris 2024. The Chinese city of Hangzhou has recently hosted the Asian Games, and through this event, China demonstrated its sporting and technological might to its continental neighbours. Saudi Arabia has been exploiting sport as a means of accumulating its soft power assets, and the presence of the Saudi Pro League and the LIV Golf in the global sport industry is causing some strain on the established sporting markets in the West. At this juncture, the 2024 PSA Sport and Politics Group conference invites abstracts that discuss the connections between sport and cultural, national, regional, and global politics from several different perspectives. We welcome an abstract from any social sciences and humanities disciplines. Please submit your abstract (250 words maximum) to https://lnkd.in/ex72JrBc by 17.00 (GMT) on 20 December 2023. Key Dates: Abstract Deadline: 20 December 2023 Abstract Outcome: 15 January 2024 Registration Deadline: 26 February 2024 Venue: Moray House School of Education and Sport University of Edinburgh Scotland Please contact Jay Lee (J.W.Lee@ed.ac.uk) or Pippa Chapman (pippa.chapman@ed.ac.uk) should you have any questions. Conference fees and keynote speakers will be confirmed in January 2024. We expect the amount of the registration fee is likely to be in the region of £100.\n\n⚽ 🔬 The Nobel Prize VS Football 🔬⚽ 🌟 The Nobel Prize stands as a beacon of global unity and progress, like the appeal of sports like football or the Olympics, but in science and intellectual achievement. It's a boarderless celebration for our collective hunt for knowledge and to always do better. 👉 Just as sports unite fans and athletes worldwide, the Nobel Prize brings together the brightest minds, irrespective of nationality or background, in a shared pursuit of discovery and innovation. It's a proof of what we can achieve when we collaborate. 👉 By honoring groundbreaking work in fields like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economic Sciences, the Nobel Prize underscores the diverse ways in which science and thought leadership contribute to society. It's a reminder of our potential as a global community to overcome challenges and create a better world. 👉 Beyond recognizing individual excellence, the Nobel Prize symbolizes our universal aspirations. It's an encouragement for future generations to dream big, be creative, and work together towards common goals. ❗Remember❗ 🌟 Embrace curiosity, support collaboration, and celebrate the achievements that move us all forward, together. 🌟 Thanks, Coly-boys Filip Klementsson and John Gundberg, for posing with me! #nobelprize #senseofbelonging #science #together #cooperation #sharing\n\n\"I am the Lorax, and I speak for the trees.\" - The Lorax, Dr. Seuss While I was not in attendance at the QUT (Queensland University of Technology) business leaders forum yesterday, I do want to take up Cindy Hook's provocation to \"speak up\". For the last 3 years, various impacted communities across Brisbane have already been speaking up regarding the various negative educational, social, environmental, and economic impacts of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics & Paralympics. These games were premised on the \"New Norm\", an opportunity to rethink the old Olympics legacy which has bankrupted host cities, left legacies of underutilised white elephant stadia, and never properly accounted for the many other negative environmental and social impacts of this mega-event (e.g. displacement of homeless peoples, driving inflation and housing unaffordability, etc.). Yet, to most of us on the ground, it seems that many in government and on these various boards want to continue the legacies of old, rather than treating this as a genuine opportunity to exercise a vision in how the Olympics, and sports and megaevents in general, can transform into a greener and more socially positive experience for *all*. It's 2024, we are in the midst of a cost of living crisis, inequality is on the rise, and the world is continuing to deal with the increasing consequences of climate change. We can ill-afford to keep sinking increasingly limited resources into rebuilding massive stadiums and tearing up green space while doing so, and I personally feel that it is irresponsible for modern leaders to be encouraging such. For more background, this Federal Parliamentary Library report by Rodney Bogaards makes for sobering reading: \"Based on this history, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether the benefits of the Brisbane Olympics in 2032 will outweigh the costs to the community, even with the ‘New Norm’ changes.\" https://lnkd.in/gqbyG3Nx\n\nWhen you spend weeks and more weeks on one specific project and then realize you just handed it in... We all know this surreal yet satisfying feeling. If then, some time later, you are still happy with the result, you know it was most likely a job well done. (Or you might have a distorted perception of your work. But that's another story.) The Activity Report 2023 of the International Alumni Center gGmbH (iac Berlin) was such a project. It has now been published in digital and print form and features an intro to #relational #approaches and why they are relevant to #philanthropy as well as a deepdive on the topic of #ecosystem #catalyzation - an approach that allows foundation to better understand their role in and responsibility for resilient ecosystems. There are also practical examples of the application of relational approaches, such as: 💡 #decentralization and #peer2peerLearning in the #BoschAlumniNetwork 💡 the #strength of #UnlikelyPartnerships found in the Global Diplomacy Lab (GDL) 💡 #BridgeBuilding in times of #polarization and #division by the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley Working on this publication with such an inspiring team of colleagues near and far has been a true pleasure. Many thanks to everybody involved! If you're intrigued now to download, read, and perhaps share the iac Berlin Activity Report 2023 as well - it would be our pleasure. You'll find the digital version at: https://lnkd.in/e-JMCXXD"
