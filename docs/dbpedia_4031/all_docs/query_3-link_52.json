        "text": "Equity, Diversity and Inclusion at Vanderbilt\n\n2019–20 Report\n\nA MESSAGE FROM UNIVERSITY LEADERS\n\nTo the Vanderbilt community,\n\nNow more than ever, Vanderbilt is uniquely positioned to address society's most pressing challenges. This is due to our world-class research, our collaborative culture—and perhaps most important—our mission to provide an empowering education that enriches lives. Positive change is most palpable when we expand our ways of thinking, open our minds to new perspectives, resist simplicity and experience belonging in new ways. This can only happen when people from diverse backgrounds come together, and when everyone is positioned for success.\n\nThe stories and achievements in this report reflect Vanderbilt's commitment to these values, all of which are fueled and made stronger by diversity and inclusion. The accomplishments detailed herein, some launched in 2019–20 and some continuing successfully from past years, are sources of pride for our community, but they are also a reminder that there is always—and by necessity—more progress to be made. As a university committed to bettering our society, we must always ask ourselves: How can we do more? How can we drive tangible and lasting change?\n\nThese questions resonate now more than ever, at the end of a year that has brought profound challenges—from acts of violence and injustice to the particular obstacles and inequities brought to light by COVID-19. This report illustrates our resilience throughout these difficult times. It shows our capacity for thoughtful action, compassionate dialogue and determination. And, in so doing, it inspires us to continue to address challenges head-on, and to always strive to do better.\n\nAs with any major endeavor, we can only foster meaningful diversity and inclusion together—as one community, One Vanderbilt. We urge everyone to join us in acknowledging what we have achieved and continuing to make active and enduring change. We are optimistic for our future, and committed to the dialogues, the collaboration, and the hard work that will continue to drive us forward.\n\nVanderbilt must be the institution guided by its natural proclivity to wed education to inspiration, as a means to challenge young diverse minds in a social and morally purposeful manner to address society's greatest challenges.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel Diermeier\n\nChancellor\n\nSusan R. Wente\n\nProvost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs\n\nAndré L. Churchwell\n\nVice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion; and Chief Diversity Officer\n\nCLIMATE AND CULTURE\n\nCultivating Inclusion and Empowerment\n\nVanderbilt's collegial culture is at the heart of everything we do: from establishing new committees and task forces devoted to furthering equity, diversity and inclusion, to hosting events such as the Chancellor's Lecture Series that bring new perspectives to our community, to commemorating historical milestones that spotlight our nearly 150 years of history. Together, these priorities—as evidenced by further examples from the past year, below—reinforce the unique climate of our present moment, and the values that will continue to set Vanderbilt apart for years to come.\n\nCelebrating History and Progress\n\n2019–20 marked significant milestones for longstanding programs, including the 35th anniversary of the Bishop Joseph Johnson Black Cultural Center at Vanderbilt and 30 years of impact from the Posse Scholars program.\n\n260\n\nstudents actively impacted by the Vanderbilt Posse Scholars program since its founding\n\nVanderbilt commemorated the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting American women the right to vote through collaborative events with the Nashville Public Library, participation in the \"I Ring the Bell\" campaign, a virtual discussion about women of color and civic engagement, and many other events.\n\nAs part of the 2019 Reunion festivities, the Office of the Chancellor unveiled the second cohort of Vanderbilt Trailblazer portraits, which recognized selfless pioneers within and beyond the Vanderbilt community: Kate Lupton, Dorothy Phillips, K.C. Potter, David Williams II, and Muhammad Yunus.\n\n\"These Vanderbilt Trailblazers shaped the roadmap through which we can all continue to explore, seek improvements and drive positive change in the world. Through their courage and conviction, they opened doors for others to follow, and, in doing so, they made us a stronger and better university.\" — Susan R. Wente, Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and then-Interim Chancellor, during October 2019 unveiling of 2019 Vanderbilt Trailblazers portraits\n\nKate Lupton\n\nDavid Williams II\n\nK.C. Potter\n\nDorothy J. Wingfield Phillips\n\nMuhammad Yunus\n\nAs part of the 2020 MLK Commemorative Series, Vanderbilt community members retraced moments of local civil rights history with original Nashville Freedom Rider Kwame Lillard.\n\nStudent-athletes, faculty, staff, coaches and community members—including Nashville mayor and Vanderbilt alumnus John Cooper, MBA'85, and public officials—gathered in February 2020 for the dedication of Perry Wallace Way, a street near Memorial Gymnasium that was named in honor of Perry Wallace, BE'70, the first Black varsity basketball player at Vanderbilt and in the SEC.\n\nVanderbilt Athletics hosted the David Williams Fall Classic, a baseball game in partnership with the University of Michigan and the Negro League Baseball Museum. Vanderbilt also paid tribute to David Williams II, the first African American athletics director in the Southeastern Conference, by naming the campus recreation and wellness center in his honor in fall 2019.\n\nVanderbilt celebrated the landmark opening of the National Panhellenic Council Community House, a prominent new gathering space in the redesigned West End Neighborhood for the historically African American fraternities and sororities at Vanderbilt, in October 2019.\n\n140\n\ndiversity-related stories published through MYVU in partnership with the Division of Communications, in the 2019–20 academic year, highlighting Vanderbilt's initiatives, research and community efforts to foster a more inclusive and welcoming community\n\nNew Conversations and Perspectives\n\nVanderbilt's 2020 MLK Commemorative Series in January was one of the most highly attended to date. The four-day series of events featured keynote speakers Janelle Monáe and Yusef Salaam, in addition to a series of interactive \"teach-ins,\" a community-wide Joint Day of Service, spearheaded by the Office of Active Citizenship and Service (OACS), and other inclusive events.\n\n500\n\nstudents from Vanderbilt and neighboring institutions brought together to engage in service to the Nashville community for the 2020 Joint Day of Service\n\n\"As [Martin Luther King, Jr.] recognized, only love can defeat hate and only light can conquer and erase darkness. We should never demonize a race or people or person, but seek to understand them.\" — Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion André L. Churchwell, during kickoff of 2020 MLK Commemorative Series\n\nThe 2019–20 Chancellor's Lecture Series, hosted by then-Interim Chancellor and Provost Susan R. Wente, focused on the theme of \"Culture of Respect, Culture of Caring.\" Distinguished speakers included author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, actors and activists Terry Crews and George Takei, and former U.S. ambassadors John Bolton and Susan Rice, among others. Starting in 2019, the Faculty Senate also hosted community discussions following the lectures, to further explore the scholarship and take-aways from each speaker's conversation.\n\nAll three of the Ingram Commons Lecture Series—the Lawson, Crawford and Murray Lectures—featured special guests discussing equity, diversity and inclusion. Speakers included Kwame Anthony Appiah, author of The Lies That Bind: Rethinking Identity, the 2019–20 Commons Reading; Supriya Vani, human rights defender, international journalist and author of Battling Injustice: 16 Women Nobel Peace Laureates; and Anthony Abraham Jack, assistant professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and author of The Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges Are Failing Disadvantaged Students. Both Vani and Jack received Patterson Fellowships to stay for up to a week at Vanderbilt's residential colleges, enabling them to discuss their work and interact regularly with students.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nGeorge Takei\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nVice Chancellor for Administration Eric Kopstain, Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Dr. André L. Churchwell and Interim Associate Vice Chancellor for Human Capital and Business Services Laura Nairon hosted a series of listening sessions for Vanderbilt University staff throughout the 2019–20 academic year. The listening sessions provided opportunities for staff to discuss their experiences on campus, the culture of working at Vanderbilt, and ways to create a more equitable and inclusive working environment at the university.\n\nAs part of the Dean's Diversity Lecture Series, Peabody College welcomed a range of distinguished guests, from \"father of environmental justice\" Robert Bullard to Spencer Foundation president Na'ilah Suad Nasir. The Dean's Diversity Lecture Series is one example of bold conversations taking place in Vanderbilt schools and colleges. The Divinity School, School of Nursing, Law School, School of Medicine and others each host lectures related to diversity and inclusion.\n\nNa'ilah Suad Nasir\n\nRobert Bullard\n\nBettina Love\n\nArun Gandhi\n\nThe Vanderbilt Divinity School hosted a virtual social justice conference titled \"Medical Apartheid Revisited: Pandemic, Politics and Priorities.\" The conference focused on inequities surrounding COVID-19 and featured a keynote address by award-winning medical writer Harriet Washington.\n\nUniversity leaders hosted a Memorial Service Against Racism to honor George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and the countless lives lost due to racial injustice. The livestreamed June 2020 event garnered hundreds of virtual participants across the Vanderbilt community.\n\nAlso in June, Vice Chancellor André L. Churchwell organized a webinar for chief diversity officers from across the Southeastern Conference.

Below are highlights of the new and ongoing work being done across campus to support diversity at Vanderbilt.\n\nCollege and School Programs\n\nThe College of Arts and Science's Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-PhD Bridge Program is a national model of how a research university can partner with historically Black institutions to create a unique pipeline to address academic and career path needs for underrepresented groups. The program is a nationally recognized leader in developing top talent among underrepresented groups in STEM, providing numerous support services and resources for students as they consider a career in academia or the workforce.\n\nThe Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-PhD Bridge Program, launched in 2004, focuses on increasing the number of underrepresented groups earning Ph.D.'s in astronomy, biology, chemistry, materials science and physics. After 16 years, 145 students have enrolled in the program, 107 master's degrees have been awarded, 101 students have bridged to Ph.D. programs, and 36 students have earned the Ph.D., 28 of those from Vanderbilt.\n\nThrough the Global Oral History Project at Vanderbilt University Blair School of Music, students create oral histories of local musicians from Nashville's diverse musical communities, which are stored in the Wilson Library Global Music Archive.\n\nVanderbilt Law School recently announced a 1Levate Leadership Program for first-generation, underrepresented and nontraditional students, which is the first leadership program of its kind in the country, supporting these students in a cohort. The group will receive special mentorship from local attorneys and current students, access to roundtables with high-profile figures, and training to become leaders.\n\nThe Owen Graduate School of Management's Turner Family Center for Social Ventures focuses on initiatives and programming to alleviate poverty through market-driven forces. Many of these initiatives are community-based efforts to engage students with diverse community organizations. Projects are also facilitated by 100% Owen, a student service club. That work was expanded in 2019 when the Center for Social Ventures launched a Board Fellows program that places Owen students on the boards of local nonprofit organizations for a year.\n\nTo instill sensitivities that are essential to culturally competent health care, the School of Nursing requires all faculty and students to participate in the Community Action Poverty Simulation. The simulation enables participants to \"walk a mile in the shoes\" of those facing poverty and consider the challenges that millions of low-income individuals must face and then discuss the potential for change within their local community.\n\nWomen's Initiative\n\nWith the launch of Women's Advancement and Equity (WAVE) councils (one led by faculty, students and postdoctoral scholars and one led by staff) in 2018, the university reinforced its commitment to continue supporting women at Vanderbilt. In the 2019–20 academic year, the councils conducted surveys, town halls and listening sessions to gather input from the community that will inform the development of innovative solutions and practices to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to succeed, no matter what gender they identify with.\n\nProvost's WAVE Council – Women's Advancement and Equity\n\nSteering Committee Chair (2019–20)\n\nCindy Kam, William R.

HPAO also offers interview workshops, mock interviews and a peer-mentoring program for students to prepare for the interview process. A new workshop was developed to help students prepare for virtual interviews used by most medical schools during 2020.\n\nChanges to the structure of the Health Professions Advisory Office have significantly impacted the overall outcomes for Vanderbilt students applying to allopathic medical schools, such as an 80% acceptance rate for all allopathic medical schools and an increase of 28% acceptance in underrepresented minority students and those from low socioeconomic status families. In AY 2020, 82% of applicants identified as racial or ethnic minorities.\n\nThe Global Education Office (GEO) investigated and adopted new practices to successfully recruit more diverse candidates, both for full-time staff positions and among their undergraduate and student workers. GEO staff also underwent professional development geared specifically toward better supporting students with autism who may require special assistance when navigating travel, then incorporating that into how the global safety team handles advising and crisis situations.\n\nIn addition to launching an internal Inclusion and Outreach Committee with diverse membership, aimed at better supporting our diverse student population, the Global Education Office conducted interviews with returnees that focused on diverse student experiences on-site, as well as tailored global safety guidance and advising for first-generation students, female students, students of color and LGBTQI+ students. Resources for identity and culture are also provided to the students.\n\nThe Office of Active Citizenship and Service staff reviewed all program materials to ensure that readings included and emphasized authors of color.\n\nThe Office of Active Citizenship and Service includes a two-hour equity training in all Local OACS DIVE and Global Service Immersion programs and is currently developing a service-learning toolkit with resources on community engagement and equity.

The staff were instrumental in supporting Vanderbilt's announcement of enhanced adoption, fertility and surrogacy benefit programs in June 2019 to better support all eligible employees, as well as the upcoming Gender Affirmation Tool Kit for managers to better support their employees during gender transition. In 2019–20, LGBTQI Life reached more than 3,500 individuals through events such as Affinity Groups, National Coming Out Day, Home for the Holidays, Faculty/Staff Engagement Receptions and HIV testing. The office also completed 67 trainings on issues of gender and sexuality for classes, student leaders, offices and groups across campus and in the community.\n\nOn the second annual Black History Immersion Excursion in February 2020, 46 students and 16 faculty and staff chaperones toured Alabama and New Orleans and learned more about the racial history of slavery, key moments and individuals in the civil rights movement, mass incarceration and voting rights. The Bishop Joseph Johnson Black Cultural Center collaborated on the event with the Department of African American and Diaspora Studies, the Student Center for Social Justice and Identity, and the Office of Housing and Residential Experience. The Black Cultural Center offers more than 100 programs annually, reaching more than 4,500 students.\n\nImprovements to physical spaces on campus are enhancing accessibility for all community members, following the principles regarding diversity and inclusion that guide FutureVU, the university's land use planning initiative.

At Vanderbilt, this is our greatest asset, and also our urgent obligation.\n\nVanderbilt is always committed to doing more.

We must do whatever it takes to create an environment where students can learn and grow to their full potential, and where diverse faculty and staff can come together to make our university stronger. This is how we will set a positive example, and maximize our impact on our fellow citizens.\"—Chancellor Daniel Diermeier\n\nBack to Top"
