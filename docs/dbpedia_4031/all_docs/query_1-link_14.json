        "text": "As in the crisis of 1970, Bangkok once again stepped in to save the noble cause after both Singapore and Islamabad (Islamic Republic of Pakistan) had to pull out as host for the 8th Asiad due to political and financial reasons. For the Kingdom of Thailand , it became her 3rd Asiad as host in a span of 12 years. It was agreed that in order to save the Asiad, participating countries / NOCs share the cost of organizing the Games. Also, the exclusion of Israel and Taiwan drew hostile reactions from international sports organizations. In medal tally, China returned to the Games with astonishing gusto, bagging 151 medals and closing in on Japan . South Korea , North Korea and Thailand showed their strength, but it was evident for many that Japanese supremacy was coming to an end.\n\nParticipating Nations\n\n25\n\nParticipants\n\n3842\n\nSports/Events\n\n19\n\nAthletics, Swimming, Soccer, Tennis, Basketball, Volleyball, Table Tennis, Cycling, Boxing, Wrestling, Weightlifting, Fencing, Shooting, Gymnastics, Hockey, Badminton, Archery, Bowling and Sailing.\n\nWas originally awarded to Islamabad , Pakistan but due to political and financial issues the Games were shifted to Bangkok , Thailand.\n\nIsrael was shifted to Europe.\n\nNew affiliated member Country's (NOCs): Syria , UAE, Bangladesh , Lebanon , Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n\nArchery and Bowling new sports.\n\nThe top three winners were: Japan , China and Korea.\n\nMedal Tally of VIII Asian Games\n\nRank\n\nNation\n\nMedals\n\nGold\n\nSilver\n\nBronze\n\nTotal\n\n1\n\nJapan\n\n70\n\n58\n\n49\n\n177\n\n2\n\nChina\n\n51\n\n55\n\n45\n\n151\n\n3\n\nSouth Korea\n\n18\n\n20\n\n31\n\n69\n\n4\n\nNorth Korea\n\n15\n\n13\n\n15\n\n43\n\n5\n\nThailand\n\n11\n\n11\n\n20\n\n42\n\n6\n\nIndia\n\n11\n\n11\n\n6\n\n28\n\n7\n\nIndonesia\n\n8\n\n7\n\n18\n\n33\n\n8\n\nPakistan\n\n4\n\n4\n\n9\n\n17\n\n9\n\nPhilippines\n\n4\n\n4\n\n6\n\n14\n\n10\n\nIraq\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n12\n\n11\n\nSingapore\n\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\n7\n\n12\n\nMalaysia\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n6\n\n13\n\nMongolia\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n9\n\n14\n\nLebanon\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n2\n\n15\n\nSyria\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n16\n\nMyanmar\n\n-\n\n3\n\n3\n\n6\n\n17\n\nHong Kong\n\n-\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n18\n\nSri Lanka\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n2\n\n19\n\nKuwait\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n1\n\nTotal\n\n201\n\n198\n\n226\n\n625\n\nPakistan Medal Tally in VIII Asian Games\n\nS.No.\n\nDiscipline\n\nMedals\n\nGold\n\nSilver\n\nBronze\n\nTotal\n\n1.\n\nAthletics\n\n-\n\n1\n\n-\n\n1\n\n2.\n\nBadminton\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3.\n\nBoxing\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n6\n\n4.\n\nHockey\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n5.\n\nLawn Tennis\n\n-\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n6.\n\nYachting\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n7.\n\nWeightlifting\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n1\n\n8.\n\nWrestling\n\n-\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTotal\n\n4\n\n4\n\n9\n\n17"
