        "text": "One significant personal milestone seemed to have been wholly overshadowed in the aftermath of Pakistan’s stunning 24-run defeat in the final Test on their recent tour to Zimbabwe.\n\nWhile criticism continued to pour in after the unexpected debacle in the second Test at Harare, very few cared to remember the majestic feat of Younis Khan reaching the important landmark of 7,000 Test runs.\n\nThe former Pakistan captain, now acclaimed as a master batsman and a highly respectable statesman in a side which often struggles to post big totals in the highest form of the game, got to the coveted landmark during the course of scoring 77 in the first innings of the second Test at the Harare Sports Club to become just the fourth Pakistani after Javed Miandad, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf to join the elite group — the 43rd player in this category of Test batsmen.\n\nThe Mardan-born right-handed run machine, who will celebrate his 36th birthday on Nov 29, has been a model of consistency almost throughout his 13-year international career with an imposing tally of 7058 runs in 84 Tests.\n\nHe may not be as brutal as Inzamam or as elegant as Yousuf at the crease, but like the legendary Miandad, Pakistan’s highest accumulator of Test runs thus far, Younis is a tenacious individual who thrives in times of crisis.\n\nWhen the chips are down, Pakistan invariably look to the dependable Younis to lift the team out of trouble. And seldom has he let his country down.\n\nEver since Misbah-ul-Haq was entrusted with the Test leadership after the infamous Lord’s Test spot-fixing saga surfaced in August 2010, he has banked heavily on Younis to provide solidity from the No 4 slot.\n\nA close glance at Younis’ track record makes very impressive reading to say the least. Four double centuries — including a match-winning 200 not out in the first Test against Zimbabwe of the latest series — among 22 three-figure knocks sit equally with the achievements of Zaheer Abbas and Yousuf while Miandad’s six multiple tons lead the way for Pakistan.\n\nMoreover, only the iconic figure of Hanif Mohammad (337 v West Indies at Bridgetown, 1958) and Inzamam (329 v New Zealand at Lahore, 2002) better his 313 that Younis plundered against Sri Lanka at Karachi in 2009. Younis’ average of 51.89 is the third best for Pakistan among the batsmen who have played a minimum of 20 Test innings.\n\nOnly Miandad (52.57) and Yousuf (52.89) have averaged more for their country, while Inzamam is the other player to average 50 or more (50.16). Statistically, Inzamam (25), Yousuf (24) and Miandad (23) have scored more Test hundreds than Younis for Pakistan with Saleem Malik’s 15 being the next best.\n\nDespite a topsy-turvy period in the early phase of his Test career — which saw him scoring 107 in the second innings on his debut game against Sri Lanka at Rawalpindi in 2000 — Younis enjoyed a remarkable sequence from 2004 to 2011 when he averaged over 50 in every single calendar year, the only exception being 2008 when, curiously enough, Pakistan didn’t play a single Test match!\n\nTo maintain that kind of consistency for seven years is a superhuman effort indeed that even Miandad, Inzamam and Yousuf failed to achieve during their illustrious careers.\n\nYounis, often underrated when compared with modern-day greats of the game, even surpassed the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis, Kumar Sangakkara, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Virender Sehwag, Mahela Jayawardene, Kevin Pietersen, Michael Hussey and Rahul Dravid as well as compatriot Yousuf in the eight-year period during which he scored at an astounding average of 62.84, amassing 4525 runs in 45 of the 65 Tests Pakistan figured in between 2004 to 2011. South Africa’s Kallis lies second in terms of averages (61.45) with Sangakkara a close third at 60.27 in that period.\n\nYounis’ nine second innings hundreds are the highest tally for Pakistan and the 11th best among all batsmen in Test history. In the fourth innings Younis merits special mention since he is among a rare club of just five batsmen to have scored four centuries.\n\nIn the list of batsmen with 7,000 or more runs, Younis is the 14th quickest to get there, requiring 148 innings (Yousuf needed 139 innings, Miandad 145 and Inzamam 158), while Wally Hammond of England achieved the feat in the least number of innings — 131.\n\nBut when it comes to the number of matches, Younis is the 10th fastest behind Sehwag (79 Tests), Sir Garfield Sobers (79), Hammond (80), Gavaskar (80), Matthew Hayden (80), Yousuf (82), Dravid (82), Sangakkara (83) and Brian Lara (83).\n\nThe value of Younis as a match-winner is simply immeasurable. Among the ‘Big Four’, Younis has accumulated 3082 runs in Pakistan’s 31 Test victories at a magnificent average of 71.67 with 10 hundreds. Inzamam tops the group with 4690 runs at 78.16 with 17 three-figure knocks in 49 wins. Miandad scored 2923 runs (average 59.65 with 10 hundreds) in 39 victories while Yousuf contributed 2789 runs (average 53.21 with eight centuries) in 34 wins.\n\nCurrently confined to playing Test matches, Younis is Pakistan’s seventh highest scoring in One-day Internationals with 7,014 runs in 253 matches and won his last cap against South Africa at Benoni in March this year. In addition, Younis had modest success in Twenty20 Internationals (442 runs in 25 games) and last played in this format in December 2010 on the tour of New Zealand.\n\nOf late Younis, who led Pakistan to their only ICC World Twenty20 title when England hosted the event in 2009, has rarely appeared in public and shuns the media. On return from Zimbabwe, Younis dodged the electronic media present at the Quaid-i-Azam International Airport and scurried home in a flash while the TV reporters and cameramen tried in vain to approach him.\n\nKnowing the man and his moods eversince he started playing first-class cricket in late 1998, one can have nothing but praise for Younis for being a wonderful servant of Pakistan cricket."
