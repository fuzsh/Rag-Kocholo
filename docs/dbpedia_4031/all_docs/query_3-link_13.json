        "text": "With just nine days to go until the start of the 2024 Paris Olympics, athletes from Team GB have been gearing up for the Games - and many are travelling from Yorkshire to compete.\n\nAmong them are former medallists including Harrogate diver Jack Laugher, Leeds mountain biker Tom Pidcock and Otley road cyclist Lizzie Deignan.\n\nOver the years the region has produced champions who became household names, such as Jessica Ennis-Hill and the Brownlee brothers, but a new generation is hoping to make their mark this summer.\n\nYorkshire is represented in a number of the major events and disciplines, including the showpiece men's 100m sprint.\n\nTeam GB's only representative in the shot put is former bricklayer Scott Lincoln from Northallerton, who didn't even have the right footwear when he first started competing.\n\nHe attempted to qualify for the Rio Games in 2016 while still an apprentice at his father's construction firm, and made his debut at Tokyo 2020.\n\nHe is hoping to make the podium in Paris after he took the bronze medal at the last Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe 31-year-old was selected after winning his 10th consecutive British outdoor title and meeting the Olympic qualifying standard.\n\nHe said he was \"excited\" for his first experience of a Games without Covid restrictions.\n\nHis shot put career began in school competitions.\n\nHe said: \"It's easy to think, when you're at school, that you're a big deal throwing 3m more than your classmates.\n\n\"Then I got to the English Schools, which was the biggest competition of the year, and I turned up in skateboarding trainers, absolutely clueless.\n\n\"I remember the first guy smashing the 19m box at the side, and I thought jeez, he even has proper shoes for throwing in!\"\n\nAnother of the region's hopefuls is Sheffield sprinter Louie Hinchliffe, whose story has been described as a \"sporting fairytale\".\n\nHe grew up in Crookes and attended Notre Dame High School, where he excelled in athletics and golf. After a year at Lancaster University, Hinchliffe was recruited by the University of Houston's track programme, where the head coach is nine-times Olympic champion Carl Lewis.\n\nHe has since won the US collegiate 100m title and the British Championships.\n\nIf he came through the heats in Paris, Hinchliffe would be only the second British athlete in 25 years to reach the men's 100m final. The most recent, Zharnel Hughes at Tokyo 2020, was disqualified from the race.\n\nHe said: \"Carl has made a massive difference. He's a nine-time champion, you just have to be an open book and take in all the advice he gives you.\n\n\"He'll make jokes and he'll also be hard on you when something isn't right. He keeps me on the right track.\n\nHe added: âIt means everything to be going to Paris.\n\n\"I will go with the attitude that I can win. I seem to do well in the high-pressure situations, so who knows.â\n\nLong-distance runner Emile Cairess will make his Olympic debut in Paris and compete in the marathon.\n\nHe grew up in Saltaire and attended Bradford Grammar School, which has a history of producing distance runners.\n\nThe 26-year-old's mother Alison, an art teacher, introduced him to running as a child.\n\nHe trains on Baildon Moor and along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and represents Bingley Harriers.\n\nHe came to wider attention in 2023 when he overtook Mo Farah in the London Marathon, and this year he came third in the elite men's race.\n\nCairess is the second-fastest British marathon runner of all time.\n\nMolly Thompson-Smith, 26, specialises in the combined boulder and lead, a discipline set to make its Olympic debut at Paris 2024.\n\nShe said her drive to compete at the Olympics comes from a desire for change, as well as success.\n\nShe grew up in London but trains in Sheffield, and as one of few black climbers on the global circuit said she wants to \"be that role model, that athlete I wish I had when I was a kid\".\n\nIn a recent interview with BBC Newsbeat, Thompson-Smith said she was taken aback by research suggesting people who take part in climbing overwhelmingly come from white backgrounds.\n\nThe Leeds Beckett University study, published in 2021, found people from black, Asian and minority backgrounds only make up about 7% of participants in the sport.\n\n\"I'm always pretty shocked when I hear the stats about participation within climbing,\" she said.\n\nThe Halifax middle-distance runner became UK champion in the 800m in 2022, but his chance at the World Championships was lost when a blood clot in his calf left him unable to compete.\n\nHe even spent time in a mobility scooter and further injury problems persisted last year, but he made a comeback at the British Championships this year, finishing second in the 800m to qualify for Paris.\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, external, X (formerly known as Twitter), external and Instagram, external.
