        "text": "Within the popular music industry in United States during the 1980s, a new kind of music developed by DJ Kool Herc (born Clive Campbell) known as hip-hop or rap emerged. The industry has grown exponentially since its forthcomings in about 1980. Unfortunately, the industry has been highly concentrated primarily among several large companies throughout its twenty-five year history. Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group are these three dominating companies in the popular music industry, and clearly so in the hip-hop and rap genre. These companies have the most power to distribute the music of their artists and promote the artists through various mediums of entertainment. This study seeks to expose the level of concentration among labels and companies throughout the history of hip-hop and also provide a breakdown of dominating labels and companies throughout this twenty-five year period. This breakdown will analyze data from Billboard Charts from 1990 to present and draw on several studies. The Billboard data reflects the high level of control exercised by these companies, but does not incorporate the propaganda put forward by these organizations to promote songs, whether it be for radio airplay, internet advertisements, or selling fan apparel that inadvertently promotes albums or artists.\n\nBut back to some history first. Back to DJ Kool Herc’s creation of hip-hop. Hip-hop, from the beginning was strongly focused on self-expression, whether that be through rapping, breakdancing, DJing, or writing graffiti. With such control by large companies to potentially alter pieces by artists and tweak messages put out to the public, this self-expression of even the most groundbreaking artists is called into question.\n\nAfrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, and Grandmaster Flash were the first real players in this newly-developed genre. Prior to the nineties, the first few biggest album releases were Run DMC’s self-titled debut album (the first album in rap to achieve gold status), the Fat Boys’ debut album, Whodini’s Escape, and LL J Cool’s Radio; all of these releases came out 1984, aside from LL J Cool’s work. For the most part during these years, rap remained relatively underground and was rarely taken that seriously. During these years leading up to Hip-Hop/Rap as an acknowledged chart genre on Billboard, the development of drum machines with synthesized tones and textures, unlimited new possibilities were unveiled to create faster, instrumentals. With the upcoming of artists like KRS One, Rakim, Treacherous Three, Grandmaster Caz, Masterdon Committee, T La Rock, Kool G Rap, and Big Daddy Kane to redefine lyricism in rap. LL J Cool, Run DMC, Beastie Boys, MC Hammer, Young MC and Salt-N-Pepa all had album releases just on the brink of hip-hop’s breakthrough into common pop culture.\n\nWith the beginning of the Billboard Rap Chart, the 1990s was the “Golden Age” of hip-hop, with an explosion of artists with widely varying styles and characteristics of songs. In the 1990s, dominating artists consisted of Dr. Dre, Salt-N-Pepa, De La Soul, Heavy D, Kwame, MC Hammer, Queen Latifah, Monie Love, N.W.A., Slick Rick, 2 Live Crew, Public Enemy, a Tribe Called Quest, Mariah Carey and Cypress Hill, among others. Notorious B.I.G., Tupac, Public Enemy, Queen Latifah, and other political artists brought ideas of peace and love to a culture often thought of to encourage competitive edge and crudeness. Hip-hop and rap has served as a political vehicle since its conception.\n\nClosing out the 90s charts were artists such as Whitney Houston, Puff Daddy TLC, Usher, Dru Hills, Destiny’s Child, and R. Kelly, and others previously listed. Moving into the 2000s, the phenomenas of Jay-Z, Outkast, Alicia Keys, Nelly, 50 Cent, Beyoncé (now independent of Destiny’s Child), Ludacris, Jagged Edge, Twista, Kanye West, Chris Brown, Rihanna and Lil’ Wayne, among others. There was certainly variety in the charts to a degree, but not the same kind of variety seen in the 1990s, especially the early 1990s, as there was an explosion of various takes on songs with the new genre. The close of the first decade of the 21st century saw several new artists make their way to the top, such as Drake, T-Pain, Robin Thicke, and Trey Songz.\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have been few phenomenas free of major labels, but there have been exceptions. Among Billboard favorites there are Alicia Keys, Chris Brown, Lil’ Wayne, Kanye West, Drake, 2 Chainz, Rihanna, Macklemore, Nicki Minaj, Wiz Khalifa, Eminem, and most recently, the Weeknd. Arguably some of the most revolutionary rappers of today’s era, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Childish Gambino, and Mac Miller all are signed to major labels under these three companies. Childish Gambino has tweeted about difficulty with his label Glassnote Records, implying in his tweets that he isn’t happy about his relationship with his label. Donald Glover writes, “We were told a lot of things were gonna happen and they were all lies. so im done. someone buy me out of this contract.” Then subsequently he writes, “a lot of people came around after our first week sales. all those people are welcome now. def jam, atlantic, whatever” (Phaneuf). Donald Glover comes out and says that things aren’t happening the way he was promised, which could occasionally happen. Def Jam is also part of Universal’s stable, as well as Glassnote, and Atlantic is under Warner’s.\n\nRecent independent rap artists such as Macklemore, Chance the Rapper, Danny Brown and Tech N9ne who broke out post 2010 are some of the few strong exceptions, but due to the social media and internet, record labels are limited in some ways with their control over the artists they sign, but don’t limit themselves much. Chance the Rapper, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Kanye West, and Childish Gambino have political messages built into many songs. The only independent of the big three is Chance the Rapper, who has refused to sign to a major label. These exceptions occur but in terms of the Billboard Rap Chart, after 2010, Young Money Records almost without failure controls the hits. The 2013 Macklemore hits “Can’t Hold Us” and “Thrift Shop” were the largest and most crucial exceptions to this domination. Yet somehow, even with these two hits, Universal had a hand in 20 of the top 25 hits in 2013. (Hubbell) The concentration of hits in Rap Charts has increased ever so steadily, to the point where there have been two songs reaching the number #1 spot in 2015 that haven’t stayed there for at least five more weeks, something that would have been utterly unheard of in the early nineties. This greater focus on hits and the ability for hits to remain on the chart for so many weeks makes record labels very selective of what songs they pitch to radio stations for play time, and the songs that the most people are expected to enjoy are supported, but these are not necessarily the best songs, as will be discussed later.\n\nOn Billboard, in order to accurately represent how certain artists and certain labels do in terms of mass media successes, each week has a single song that is at the top of the chart for hip-hop and rap, and these songs have been recorded along with artist and that specific week’s date. In this list of songs, almost 70% of songs that have made it to the number 1 spot weekly have already achieved this status, and since 1989, only 203 artists have made songs that have risen to the top of the chart and remained there for multiple weeks. These artists almost without exception have signed to labels under Universal, Sony, or Warner.\n\nTracking the successes of labels and artists can also be done by taking the chart for the top 50 tracks each year, giving a bigger picture as to the dominating artists in the year. In a study of these tracks on Billboard charts, from 1989 to the present, the top 15 most successful labels are listed in a table ranked by weighing each label’s charted tracks by track rankings #1–50 and by the number of weeks charted.\n\nEach of the top fifteen ranked labels can be separated into four categories: belonging to Universal Music Group, belonging to Sony Music Entertainment, belonging to Warner Music Group, or owned by none of the above companies. Universal Music Group owns Def Jam Records, Shady Records, Cash Money Records, DTP Records, Young Money Records, Loud Records, Priority Records, Bad Boy Records, Ruffhouse Records and Roc-A-Fella Records. Sony Music Entertainment owns Columbia Records, and Jive Records. Warner Music Group owns Grand Hustle Records, and Atlantic Records, but is also a distributor of Tommy Boy Records — the only independent label in this list of the top 15 most successful labels. Easy visual ways to see this concentration is by showing each companies total charting tracks and consecutive weeks, as the number of artists does not necessarily have a correlation with that label’s success. (Daniels & Beacham)\n\nThe data that Figures 1 and 2 yield show the huge control that Universal Music Group can exercise on much of the hip-hop music industry. Warner Music Group and Sony Entertainment Music almost sweep up the rest of the industry based on these charts, especially considering Warner Music Group has a hand in the distribution process for the lone independent label of the list.\n\nFor both studies done in the above pie charts and the below line graphs, the artist to song comparisons are almost identical and for all intents and purposes, the differences are negligible. More and more indie rap labels have been created, beginning especially in the 1990s, but has steadily increased with the steady increase of large company labels. This growth is approximately equal proportionately, therefore this data can be considered a loose representation of the control each of these companies can exercise on the popular rap industry.\n\nAs we can see from the data in these two charts, there has been a downward trend over the years from originally a large variety of songs charting at the #1 spot. In the early 1990s, only a few songs each year remained in the #1 spot for more than a week, but as time moved on into the late nineties more than half of the songs reaching the #1 spot remained on the chart for more than a week. Moving into the 21st century shows an ever-increasing amount of time songs tend to remain in the #1 position on Billboard’s charts. Songs tend to remain on the top of the chart for about 3 weeks or more after about 2002. The same general trend is true of the artists of these songs, although there is greater concentration in artists as very occasionally an artist will have multiple hits chart the #1 ranking in a single year.\n\nThe sole differences between these two are slight differences in a couple numbers, but what can be taken away from this is that the diversity in popular songs in hip-hop and rap has drastically declined. Not only has this diversity declined in popularity, but it has also declined in terms of the diversity of musical elements between songs, such as artists imitating previous hits to an extent with similar chord progressions, styles, or rhythms. Shazam is a music-identification app, which was developed to serve its owner by recognizing any playing song. Shazam collects the data from all of these requests for what song is playing, suggesting that people who like that song, and show enough interest to find out what that song is, potentially to listen to it again in the future. Shazam then sells this data, and the purchasers are the companies that can afford it, such as the Big Three. Shazam has 450 million users worldwide, and 90 million monthly active users, which is certainly a considerable base of the online world. Warner has deal with Shazam that gives Warner the ability to heavily promote its existing artists on Shazam as well as the creation of a joint record label that signs artists discovered through the app. (Karp)\n\nShazam sees about 20 million searches a day, and through this discovery process, labels have developed ways to predict how a song will do. The songs that sell are the songs that the record companies are most interested in finding, and those songs that do best are the songs that the most people like, therefore using services like Shazam allows for labels to collect data and pitch songs that resemble previous hits. All of the Big Three can exercise the control on the market by promoting the songs that they expect to be the most popular hits, rather than the best songs they produce. This creates limitations not only on what we could hear from certain artists, but what kind of songs and artists will be put visibly in front of us, and which will be left unheard of. (Thompson)\n\nA last consideration of mine regarding the data analysis from Billboard is its accuracy, credibility and how it is determined, thus if it is the best (or even if it is the best, if it is a reliable) source for determining the controlling companies in terms of success rather than revenue. My answer to this consideration is it is credible, and its the best and most comprehensive tool we’ve got. The company Billboard seeks to chart all music in terms of popularity, and uses the following general guidelines for doing so (as described in their FAQ): “Billboard publishes a host of charts that are individually or collectively based on key fan interactions with music, including album sales and downloads, track downloads, radio airplay and touring as well as streaming and social interactions on Facebook, Twitter, Vevo, Youtube, Spotify and other popular online destinations for music. These measurements are tracked year-round by Billboard and its data partners, including Nielsen BDS, Nielsen SoundScan and Next Big Sound.”\n\nAs Thompson writes, “Next Big Sound, a five-year-old music-analytics company based in New York, scours the Web for Spotify listens, Instagram mentions, and other traces of digital fandom to forecast breakouts. It funnels half a million new acts through an algorithm to create a list of 100 stars likely to break out within the next year. “If you signed our top 100 artists, 20 of them would make the Billboard 200,” Victor Hu, a data scientist with Next Big Sound, told me. A 20 percent success rate might sound low, until you gaze out at the vast universe of new music and try to pick the next Beyoncé.” This thought provides me with confidence that between the three of these sources, while the algorithms created to quantify the combination of all of these variables seems difficult to formulate from an outsiders perspective, Billboard conclusively provides the best data possible for analysis of dominant companies in the industry, as each of the above companies use practically all available data for music analysis to tell which songs are at the peak and on the rise of hip-hop culture.\n\nReferences:"
