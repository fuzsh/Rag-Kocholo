        "text": "Enchanting\n\nEnchanting first signed to Guwup in 2020 and appeared on the Gucci Mane Presents So Icy Summer album alongside K Shiday on the project’s cut, “Left on Read.” The same album would yield her debut single, “No Luv,” which featured her new labelmates Shiday and Big Scarr, along with Gucci and Key Glock.\n\nBut the Fort Worth, Texas artist’s life was cut short after she died at age 26 in June. As per an official statement from Enchanting’s team, the artist had been taken off of life support following a drug overdose.\n\nPooh Shiesty\n\nPooh Sheisty is probably the most famous artist on this list. Pooh inked his deal with The New 1017 Records in 2020 after multiple collaborations with Gucci and other associates in the years before the signing. And from 2020 to 2022, Sheisty was hot as fish grease, hopping on songs with Lil Baby, Jack Harlow, Gucci, 42 Dugg, and even Lil Durk— with whom he shares his biggest hit, 2020’s “Back in Blood,” which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. The following year, Pooh dropped his debut commercial mixtape in February 2021, Sheisty Season, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200.\n\nBut later that year, legal woes hit the artist as he was arrested in June in connection to a strip club shooting. He was then indicted in connection with a 2020 shooting in Bay Harbor Islands, Florida, and then held without bond in July. After pleading guilty to federal conspiracy charges in January 2022, Pooh Sheisty was then sentenced to 5 years in prison in April of that same year.\n\nBig Scarr\n\nBig Scarr signed to 1017 Records and delivered his debut for the label on the compilation album, Gucci Mane Presents: So Icy Summer in July 2020. From there, the former 2022 XXL Freshman kept that momentum going as he hit the booth and created “SoIcyBoz2” alongside Pooh Shiesty, Foogiano, and Tay Kieth, which earned him his first RIAA-certified gold plaque. The Memphis rapper followed up with his debut mixtape, Big Grim Reaper, in April 2021 and found success on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at No. 25. However, his life was unfortunately cut short, as Scarr died at the age of 22 after suffering from a drug overdose in December 2022.\n\nFoogiano\n\nFoogiano inked his deal to Gucci in 2020, who became synonymous with his single “Molly (Baby Mama),” which dropped that same year. Gutta Baby, his debut album, was then released towards the end of that year. But his high wouldn’t last for long, as a month later in December 2020, the rapper, né Kwame Khalil Brown, was detained for possession of a weapon. During the hearing, the rapper had his bail set at $50,000, was told he had to wear an ankle monitor, and was instructed to remain in Georgia. However, Foogiano would burn off his ankle monitor, an action that led to a warrant being posted for his arrest, which then transpired in March 2021 after being on the run for 90 days. Brown was then handed a 5-year prison sentence in May 2021.\n\nHotboy Wes\n\nWes rose to fame as a part of The New 1017 Records when he signed with Gucci Mane in July 2021 and released a slew of tracks, including “My Lil Dance,” “Rolling Loud,” and “Free Speech.” But his momentum came to a halt various times, including after getting arrested in 2020 for allegedly running the mother of his children off the road and almost into a cement wall while children were in the car, per KWTX. Wes had another run-in with the law in 2022, being arrested for robbery, per Fox, and later that same year for possession of marijuana, per KWTX. And then, in 2024, Hotboy Wes‘ flame was permanently extinguished when the rapper was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison in January 2024 for multiple felony counts, including violence against the mothers of his children, per KWTX.\n\nK Shiday\n\nK Shiday is a San Antonio, TX-born rapper who was also inspired by ’90s R&B. She claims that her inspiration to make music comes from Aaliyah and Joe. But music isn’t her only passion. The artist managed to become a drill sergeant in the US Army and even snagged a bachelor’s degree in Justice Administration.\n\nIn 2021, though, her dream of becoming a rapper came true when Gucci signed her and made her the first lady of the New 1017 Records. She made her debut on Gucci Mane Presents So Icy Summer, much like most of the new roster. But Shiday was dropped from the label in 2022 for undisclosed reasons and later spoke about it that year in an interview with Revolt.\n\n“It was a struggle, I felt it was so much time from when the people saw me being with my last label and stuff like that,” she said. “The time frame from when I dropped was like.. now I gotta go in and grab my supporters again and show them… it was probably a little confusing for some of them.. now its all about being consistent and not going ghost.”\n\nRoboy\n\nRoboy hails from Tampa, FL, and was inspired by ’90s R&B and early 2000s Hip-Hop. He managed to get Gucci’s attention with music established over the years, and he signed with Gucci in 2021 as the mogul began piecing together the new roster for his label’s reemergence.\n\nHowever, controversy quickly grabbed hold of Roboy, as some mistook a random man for him in a photo with a queer person, leading the ignorant to assume he was queer, as well. Roboy denied it was him in the photo and referred to the man in the picture with a gay slur, stirring discourse within the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nHe then aimed his sights at Gucci Mane, claiming that the 1017 chain that he gave him was fake. In that deleted IG post, he revealed that he was dropped from the label. Shortly after, Ro was then arrested in March 2022 for multiple charges in Florida, including burglary and having a concealed weapon.\n\nHoodrich Pablo Juan\n\nWhile Hoodrich Pablo Juan started pursuing music in 2014, he got his big break after he inked a deal with Gucci Mane‘s New 1017 Records in November 2022. In 2018, Juan began garnering immense buzz in the underground Hip-Hop scene with his single, “We Don’t Luv Em,” which featured his future boss.\n\nBut shortly after signing his record deal, Pablo Juan was hit with a RICO for violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act in December 2022. The rapper wound up taking a plea deal and was ultimately sentenced to 15 years, with only five years to serve. He was also hit with a $2,000 fine and will have to stay on probation when he eventually comes home."
