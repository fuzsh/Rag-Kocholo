We have the most fantastic talent at Atlantic, 300, and Elektra, from superstars to baby bands, from expert execs to young people just starting out in the business.\n\n“I want them all to feel that this is the best place to do bold, brave, creative work, and build real careers. Iâm so proud to be in it with them, shoulder to shoulder, every day.\n\n“Iâd like to thank Craig and Kevin for being my partners, Max and Steve for their leadership, and our allies across the industry who help us bring great music to the world.â\n\n“We have the most fantastic talent at Atlantic, 300, and Elektra, from superstars to baby bands, from expert execs to young people just starting out in the business.

This new role only hints at the full scope of her influence and impact across our industry, but itâs still much deserved recognition of her dynamic leadership at our company.â\n\nLousada added: âJulieâs strengths, combined with Craigâs extraordinary creative talents, make them one of the outstanding partnerships in the history of music. Weâre all extremely fortunate to be working with them as they write the next great chapter in the Atlantic story.â\n\nâJulieâs a force of nature â a fearless champion of original talent, a mentor to countless artists and executives, and the visionary behind game-changing moves, such as Atlanticâs early embrace of streaming and the spin-off of the Elektra Music Group.”\n\nMax Lousada, Warner Music Group\n\nJulie Greenwald, a New York native, began her music career in 1992 at Def Jam Records.Â Six years later, she was charged with overseeing the entire marketing department of the newly formed Island Def Jam Music Group (IDJ).\n\nIn 2002, Greenwald was named President of Island Records/EVP of IDJ, becoming one of only three women holding that title at a major record label.\n\nGreenwald joined Atlantic Records as President in 2004, and according to WMG, “quickly became the architect” of the companyâs marketing and digital strategies, “revitalizing and remaking Atlanticâs culture for the 21st century”.\n\nIn 2009, her accomplishments were recognized with her promotion to Chairman and COO of Atlantic Records.\n\nGreenwald has been selected five times as Billboardâs Women in Music Executive of the Year, more than any other person, andÂ has also been featured as one ofÂ The Hollywood Reporter’s âPower 100 Women in Entertainment,âÂ ForbesâÂ âPower Women to Watch,â and onÂ Newsweek’s âWomen in Leadershipâ roster.\n\nThe announcement of Greenwald’s promotion to Chairman and CEO of Atlantic Music Group comes three months before the arrival of Robert Kyncl as Warner Music Group’s new CEO.\n\nFormer YouTube exec Kyncl will spend January 2023 as co-CEO of WMG alongside current Warner Chief Executive, Steve Cooper.\n\nOn February 1, 2023 Kyncl will become sole CEO of Warner Music Group and will assume Cooperâs seat on WMGâs Board of Directors.Music Business Worldwide"
