        "text": "I’ve noticed that a lot of creative minds struggle with one specific issue: since they mostly think artistically and not analytically, they cannot ‘translate’ the brilliance that’s in their head into a tangible idea that is presentable to the world — and logically makes sense.\n\nThey expect — and maybe are convinced — that ‘their art will speak for itself’.\n\nWhy is this a con, you ask?\n\nWell, because, first and foremost, only you know what’s in your head and others don’t; your vision needs to be transferred from the ‘idea space’ into the ‘real world’, where people can see it, read it, touch it, talk about it and 1reference it.\n\nBut, most practically, except for making music, you also need to get deals, talk with venues, negotiate payments, propose partnerships, get clients and ask for support (funding or infrastructure). You are a Musicpreneur. In the aforementioned occasions, business-oriented entities (such as venues, accountants, brands, and so on) often can’t digest creativity easily. They need a helping hand — and maybe a drop of rationality: analytical plans, coherent presentations, proof that your concept works, projections for the future, and, mainly, ‘what’s in there for them.’\n\nHere we are. In a world where the creative/analytical sides are more and more and more intertwined, we creatives need to find the balance and convergence zone between them two. ‘I will do it because we have to’ is not enough anymore.\n\nWe Musicpreneurs need to embrace and develop our analytical thinking, not merely our creative thinking.\n\nAs a Visiting Lecturer in the University of Westminster, I learned a lot about the subject analysed in the current essay. Yes, I was experienced in managing my projects and putting my vision into words (as one musician said ‘You’re really good in taking big concepts and summing them up in one sentence!’), but teaching the subject helped me put together a sequence of actions for the music students to define, refine and present their musical projects. I was impressed by their progress.\n\nI thought I should share this body of knowledge with you, since it has become more and more essential for modern musicians — despite the fact that it was unnecessary in the past.\n\nIf there’s a little voice in you, screaming that all this is pointless and you can do better without it, I’ll tell you one thing. The world is changing and we need to adapt to survive. Don’t close the doors of knowledge — there might be something interesting on the other side.\n\nAnd, if you’re still with me, let’s find out. This is how you can ‘translate’ your vision for everyone to understand and talk about. Time to get analytical.\n\nHere we are, with a sparkling desire to take our ideas and put them into words (or images, videos, multimedia presentations etc.), for everyone to understand and talk about. If it feels daunting, I get you. Because it is — every start is!\n\nBut fear not. In this stage, pen and paper are your friends. No electronic devices are needed — they will work negatively and will disorient you. Your goal here is to connect with your creative brain and ask a few questions to it. It will respond to you only if there is elimination of noise — and being in a singular mode will help you a lot. Don’t feel ashamed to externalise your crazy ideas; the paper you will write on will be only for you to see.\n\nThe key idea at this point is: “How do I want to ideally see myself a year from now?”\n\nLet’s do this.\n\nTake an empty sheet and start writing ideas about your project. Nothing should be omitted at this point. The more you write, the better. Let your pen flow freely and write down every idea, word, sketch that comes in mind when you’re thinking about your project’s vision. You want to create a map of your brain, a cloud of words and signs and symbols that reveals what’s in your creative mind. No need for order at the point, just beautiful chaos. If you want to organise the chaos a little bit, start clustering these ideas together in groups that make sense for you.\n\nOnce you’ve exhausted writing your mind out, it’s time to give a working title to your project.\n\nI’m sure you’ll change its wording completely by the end of the process. That’s fine. Your goal here is to put some words together, because they will help your project become a referable entity — names always help do that.\n\nFor instance, if your project’s vision is to get your next album released, you could call the project ‘Album release in 2016’ or something similar. As you see, there’s no need to be sophisticated. Be simple (even simplistic will suffice).\n\nNow that you have a working title in front of you, it’s time to start questioning your project’s vision. Again, don’t get too strict here; only you are allowed to see what’s on this paper.\n\nA few questions that will help you do that:\n\nWhat is the purpose of my efforts?\n\nIt will help you define what this project means for you. Did you have a life-changing moment and you want to honour it through this album? Do you want to simply discover yourself by putting together new sounds? Have you always delayed putting an album together, but now you’re determined to finally take action? You get the idea. Be honest, be vulnerable, be YOU, and write down the purpose of your endeavours.\n\nWhat is the main goal of the project?\n\nIn tangible figures, what would you ideally like to achieve with the project? Back to our album release again: is it to sell many copies (that’s a bit outdated ☺)? Is it to reach 10,000 new fans in Europe? Is it to get professional feedback by 3 music executives, so you can make your sound better? Write down one or two goals for this project.\n\nWhat makes the project interesting?\n\nThis is a tricky question. Most projects are valuable for us, but not so much for others; we find them inherently interesting, otherwise we wouldn’t have pursued them in the first place. Think about it: if there was an article headline about your project, would you click it? If not, what are the Interesting Factors of your project that would make the others notice it? Write a few Interesting Factors down.\n\nNow that we have our purpose, goals and Interesting Factors, time to get a bit pragmatic with ourselves:\n\nWhy will the project work?\n\nI’m sure you start your project because you are confident about its success. What do you think the main drivers of your project’s success will be? Are there any particular strengths that will make it unlikely to fail: your ambitious character, the strong team behind the project, partners that are too big to fail, an innovative idea, available infrastructure that will make things easier?\n\nDon’t focus on weaknesses; strengths will drive your project forward.\n\nEvery project, company or artist has weaknesses. Nobody’s perfect, after all. Even successful artists have tons of weaknesses. Guess what? They focus on their strengths instead. Do the same and write them down.\n\nGreat progress so far. Now, let’s see what’s next.\n\nWhat is your business structure?\n\nYour project will bring lots of value to different groups of people. Who are the people that will benefit from your endeavours? What kind of value will they get? Will there be an exchange, mainly of value-for-money? Think about the project’s main goal, and write down how this exchange of value will help you reach that goal.\n\nA basic business infrastructure will help your project stand strong in the real world as a commercial entity — because, one way or another, we all conduct commerce at some point.\n\nGreat, you’re written down lots of important elements of your project so far. We’ll keep being in a draft mode, but we’ll now brainstorm on more practical issues: resources, actions, proof, and problems. They will help us become a bit more realistic about our project.\n\nWhat resources do you need to get started?\n\nFor instance, money, team, infrastructure, network, patience, time etc. Do you have any disposable resources already? Time to question them: if you’re working 9–5, will you have enough time to spend on building your vision?\n\nWhat actions should you take next, before you get the project started?\n\nYou might not be ready to start your project, because you’ll need to fix some pending problems first, or get more experience, or improve your skills, or quit your job… You get the idea.\n\nWhat proof of concept do you need to show?\n\nIf your project’s goal is to get funded by a startup accelerator, they’ll first ask whether you’ve had business results in a small scale. Likewise, music supervisors need you to prove that your music is sync-able. If you want to build a bigger audience, you will need to prove that you are already liked by a small, devoted fanbase. And so on. Proof of concept helps people overcome their objections and get involved in your project.\n\nAny problems you might need to solve during the project?\n\nYour vision’s journey might be unpredictable, but your project definitely has more well-defined boundaries, providing space for predictions. Can you make a list of potential problems that might appear along the way? This way, you will be able to identify potential threats and will be ready to make more well-informed judgments on your project’s feasibility.\n\nGreat stuff so far, you’ve done lots of progress. Well done.\n\nYou are a couple of steps before the end of this stage. At this point, it will be useful to identify how everyone else will be able to participate in your project. When you see a new app, it says ‘download on App Store’, when your favourite artist releases an album, it reads ‘buy now on www.awesomeband.com’ etc. My point is:\n\nMake it easy for people to help you and get involved.\n\nIf you want a supervisor to listen to your music and give you feedback, you don’t want them to jump through hoops to do so. How easy is it for people to join your project? Is it clear, easily understandable, and maybe prominent?\n\nFinally, time to finish our brainstorming session by reading everything we’re written before. Start underlining key phrases or words that your project couldn’t do without. Once you’ve done so, think about this:\n\nHow could you describe your project in one simple sentence?\n\nCan you describe its essence and make it sound interesting, informational and human-like? If you had 5 seconds to talk about your project, what words would you choose to use?\n\nThe initial attempt to write the 1-sentence pitch might fail, because it’s the most difficult concept of this essay. Don’t be discouraged, though. You’ll make it perfect as you come along. The whole point is to write something — anything — so you can get started and use it as foundation for future improvement.\n\nAnd… that it! The phase of defining your project is over. By now you are more likely to have a better understanding of what you are putting yourself through ☺ To sum up, this phase includes:\n\nBrainstorm & mindmap\n\nFind main subject & working title\n\nPurpose, main goal, Interesting Factor\n\nWhy it will work (main factors of success)\n\nBusiness structure\n\nResources needed, actions to take, proof needed, problems to solve\n\nHow do people get involved?\n\n1-sentence pitch\n\nThat was the hardest part. Well done. Have a break, maybe a week off!\n\nBack from your week off? Great. Time to start refining your project.\n\nYou know what? That should be a piece of cake. After completing the stages #1 and #2, it is likely that you now have a clear understanding of your project’s image, how it fits into the world, its weaknesses, its allies and its purpose.\n\nThings will get interesting now. Time to get a bit social. We’ll share the project with the world. After all, it’s awesome and the world would love to learn about it, right?\n\nBut first, I have some good and bad news for you.\n\nThe bad news first: your first presentation will suck. Draft presentations always do suck. But that’s the point; you can fine-tune them by practicing, getting feedback and tweaking them.\n\nThe good news? Everyone else sucks too, but they don’t do anything about it. That’s why you’ll be smart and persistent. You’ll learn to overcome your fear of public speaking (pub fact: it’s the #1 fear in the world!) and will make sure your fabulous project is communicated properly. Every great communicator and visionary has gone through this. After all, the first two stages gave you all the information and tools you need to create a highly persuasive presentation. So, no excuses.\n\nAfter lots of practicing, pitching, learning through workshops, more practicing, more pitching, getting feedback, refining-studying-refining, messing up, getting disappointed, getting back to my feet again, pitching again, and so on, I discovered a sequence that works really great when it comes to talking about a project.\n\nThere are two templates: one for presenting and one for pitching.\n\nBoth of them end up with you asking your audience to take an action (Call To Action or CTA), with one major difference: pitching is a proposal for partnership or commercial deal with urgency embedded in it, while presenting is a narration that invites the audience to join a journey and engage in a long-term relationship.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, pitching is more rational and all about the benefits that the audience will get, while presenting is more engaging, creating empathy and connecting with the human side of the audience.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign, a deal with a venue or a publishing contract proposal would be pitching, while asking to join a mailing list, give feedback, engage on social media or take part in a sequential campaign (free course, email sequence or viral campaign) would be presenting.\n\nLet me remind you:\n\nYou will only include the absolutely necessary information in it.\n\nThis is just an initial presentation of your project; if the individuals are interested in knowing more, they can then engage further with you by taking the CTA you propose.\n\nAnother essential reminder:\n\nThere is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ presentation.\n\nIt always has to be tailored according to the audience you’re talking to. The same project could be pitching or presenting for different audiences. Examples: Venue owner — pitch to hire / Audience for free show — presentation to join. Publishing company — pitch for deal / Hardcore fans — presentation for feedback on demos.\n\nLet me share these insights with you. Ready?"
