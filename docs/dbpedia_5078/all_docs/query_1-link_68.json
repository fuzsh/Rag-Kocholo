        "text": "The music industry has continued to rally and support Black Lives Matter, equality and justice. As protests continue for Black lives and defunding the police, members of the industry have brought their activism to their companies, Congress and the streets.\n\nDays ago, high-profile artists and top music companies signed an open letter to Congress urging for the “quick passage” of the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 in the House of Representatives. The letter stated, “We applaud the provisions to ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, to establish a national police misconduct registry, to collect data and improve investigations into police misconduct, to promote de-escalation practices, to establish comprehensive training programs, and to update and enhance standards and practices.”\n\nLeading music companies and creatives joined in signing the letter like Universal Music Group, Rihanna, Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion and hundreds more. Rolling Stone reports the House is expected to reach a decision later this week.\n\nOne day before this letter to Congress was delivered, a group of music professionals formed the Black Music Action Coalition, an advocacy organization in alliance with The Show Must Be Paused. “Our highest priority at this moment is to meet with each company’s CEO, senior management and your newly formed foundation boards to mutually develop a plan to address the deeply rooted systemic racism in our industry,” BMAC’s open letter to partners and executives said.\n\nWeeks ago, Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang—who are two Black music industry executives at Atlantic Records and Platoon, respectively—founded The Show Must Be Paused. This initiative aims to hold all in the music industry accountable “who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people.”\n\nAs the music industry was urged to pause for #BlackoutTuesday and reflect on the killings of Black people by police, black tiles with related hashtags flooded social media. Since then, Thomas and Agyemang’s work has inspired more action throughout the industry.\n\nRecord label and publisher BMG announced in a statement that it began a review of previous contracts. BMG emphasized its dedication to reaching an action plan within 30 days that addresses previous wrongdoings and equality for Black artists. “Racism and social injustice exists in all 12 countries in which we operate. We need to play our part in tackling it. Each BMG office will create a plan to do so,” the statement said.\n\nArt is activism too. Many have released music in shaped by the energy of the past month. Lil Baby’s “The Bigger Picture” ascended to the top of the charts. Meek Mill’s “Otherside Of America” has also struck a chord with many. Other music includes Anderson .Paak’s “Lockdown” and “What Do You See?” by Dayne Carter and juneyouare, for example.\n\nThe fight for Black lives and equality is not a trendy moment but an ongoing struggle. As the music industry continues to charge for justice, progress is being made, but more is needed. Such a time may evoke the emotions Sam Cooke sings in his iconic anthem, “A Change Is Gonna Come.”"
