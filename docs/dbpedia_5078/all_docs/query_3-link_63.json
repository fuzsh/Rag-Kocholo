        "text": "There’s no doubt Australian music has its back against the ropes right now. Even with the ARIAs just gone celebrating the country’s music landscape at large, there are still mounting issues ranging from venue closures to waning support – which has almost made many artists want to get out of the industry entirely. Still there’s also no doubt that Australian music will continue to come back out swinging when it’s painted into a corner. There’s simply too much at stake.\n\nREAD MORE: G Flip on their new album ‘Drummer’, their six ARIA nominations and becoming the queer non-binary rolemodel they always wanted\n\nAs 2023 draws to a close and we look ahead to the new year, here are 13 albums that are set to keep the first quarter of 2024 a busy period of concentrated Australian music listening (plus two that will no doubt take the country by storm whenever they show up).\n\nWhat’s on offer here is an array of different genres, sounds, cultures, approaches and journeys. Some acts are just beginning, eager to make a name for themselves and rise through the ranks. Others are veterans, who have had their moment in the sun but are still working to build their already established legacy. Some take to loud guitars to express themselves, others to Ableton. Some sing in English, others in Indigenous language. Some albums want you to dance, others want you to think; some might even get away with doing both at the same time.\n\nNo matter their differences, however, every album is a reflection of the bigger picture of Australian music – testament to its diversity, ambition and overall quality. Whether you’re after the next big thing or are curious to see if those that have been round the block a few times have still got it, there’s plenty to dig into here. Let’s get stuck in.\n\nDavid James Young"
