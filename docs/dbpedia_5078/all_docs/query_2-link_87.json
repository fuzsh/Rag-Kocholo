        "text": "Michael Powers, President of Bigger Picture Group Artist Ventures, today announced the hiring of EJ Bernas as Director of National Promotion. In the new role he will oversee radio promotion efforts for Bigger Picture artists Craig Campbell, Chris Cagle, D. Vincent Williams, Rachel Bradshaw, Ryan Kinder and Chris Janson, and assist in promoting Atlantic Records artist Zac Brown Band.\n\n“We didn’t know whether to sign EJ to our artist roster or our executive staff, we only knew that we had to have him and we could figure the rest out later,” said Powers. “Either way, our Twitter numbers are on the rise.”\n\nWith more than 10 years of experience in country radio promotion, Bernas has been involved in hits by George Strait, Gary Allan, Lee Ann Womack, Josh Turner, David Nail and Ashton Shepherd. He was most recently VP of Music and Entertainment for the Tin Roof Corporation. Prior to that he spent eight years at Universal Music Group as Senior Director of Southwest Promotion for MCA.\n\nVice President of Promotion Matt Corbin added, “I’m very excited that my first hire as VP of Promotion is EJ Bernas. He’s a great leader and motivator that will help this company move forward.”\n\n“I wasn’t sure I was going to have this opportunity,” said Bernas. “I was lucky to have been able to take some time away from promotion and explore another side of the business; to take a step back to reflect and refresh. The passion for music has always been there for me, and this is the moment I have been waiting for. To be a part of this team and to work with the people who are leading the company, to be a piece of this puzzle, it’s amazing.”"
