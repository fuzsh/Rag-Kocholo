        "text": "Itâs important to know that the history of library music and the mainstream is not normal. This is because library music is not normal.\n\nFirst of all, when I get asked to sum up or explain what library music is, I simply state that âit is it non-commercial music made for economic use in film, TV and broadcasting.â\n\nThe key part of that statement is ânon-commercial.â Itâs not made for sale like other types of music. You are not supposed to be able to buy it. Howâs it made? Well, itâs created by specialist companies that ask composers to produce music for specific concepts â music for drama, or comedy, sport, nostalgia, or France or even the future â that they then package, then send out to broadcasters, production companies or anyone who might just use it in an advert, a film trailer, broadcast or a new TV show.\n\nAnd why, when they could use just modern pop or some hipster urban lark? The purpose of library music for the production companies is that it is a total joy to use. They donât have to ask permission or negotiate prices with artists and publishers. They just pay the standard rate-card prices based on usage, and everyone is happy. As a result of this brilliant background musical library music is everywhere: on cookery shows, on the news, selling you crisps. You just donât know it. It has also been a sonic playground for some of the worldâs more interesting composers â and some of the most fascinating and influential music of all time sits on library music LPs.\n\nTo get to where it is today, we have to rewind to the early, pre-internet 1990s, a period key to understanding library music now. And we have to go into Soho, in Londonâs West End. It was a place full of record shops, charity shops and also production companies, film companies, editing suites and the like. Itâs where I would go on a daily basis to look for music. The secondhand vinyl shops were fabulous, with places like Reckless, Soul Jazz and Jam Records regularly sending out staff to the USA and Europe to bring back boxes of rare soul, funk, Latin and jazz. Also, independent dealers and diggers would meet in the streets and coffee houses to swap, trade and sell rare hip records, rumours and gossip.\n\nAt the time, I was into film music and TV music. Iâd never really got into pop, rock or any of the bigger collecting scenes. Iâd grown up watching lots of experimental TV throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and lots of late-night films, too â that was the music I craved. So in Soho Iâd be buying the cheap junk, the OST LPs not really on the record-collecting radar. But having spent several years buying this stuff I still couldnât find exactly what I was really after â the kind of experimental music Iâd hear in late-night educational science broadcasts, the music Iâd heard in Public Information films, the scores in 1960s porn, sleaze and horror.\n\nTrust me, Iâd really tried to find it. In Soho and at London record fairs and markets Iâd meet similar-aged, similar-dressed and similar-minded music buyers, normally always on our knees on the floor looking at the junk LPs. People like Martin Green, a DJ who had started a hip club called Smashing; the Karminskys, a duo who were playing out killer lounge music to lively crowds; and Fraser Moss, a collector and fashion designer. Weâd all be seeking out the same sort of old strange TV sound, but didnât really know exactly where it all was.\n\nOne evening, late 1995, I was digging about in Jam Records. I came across an LP called Dramatics Electronic. On the front was a set of badly drawn instruments. There was a composer name Iâd never heard of, Frank Gartner. A tracklisting was written on the front, and on the back was the tracklisting again in four languages. The titles were pushing my buttons â âRadar Blips,â âDance Of The Ions,â âNuclear Wash.â It looked like an educational LP or something. It certainly wasnât normal. I bought the record, took it home and listened. It was exactly the music I had been after â late-night music from science programmes. It was weird, faceless, different.\n\nThe Super Sounds Of Bosworth LP was issued in 1996 by Trunk Records. It was the first-ever commercial library compilation. Even though the Rough Trade shop thought it was a weird hoax of made-up bands and new music trying to sound old, it brought together listeners of jazz, electronics, experimental music and even those looking for weird breaks. It also came hot on the heels of The Sound Gallery, a landmark compilation of easy listening issued in 1995. Using the EMI vaults, DJs Martin Green and Paddy Whittaker had pulled together a superb collection of loungecore classic from EMIâs Studio 2 series, but had also added a dose of KPM library cues, from LPs Martin had found for pennies on his notorious digging escapades. Together, these two compilation LPs created a strange bridge inviting adventurous listeners to cross over into the world of library music.\n\nAt the same time this was happening, the library music world was also changing. This was a business that had been going since the turn of the century. In the mid-â60s there were a handful of large library music companies, pressing the music on 78 rpm and 33 rpm vinyl. By the 1970s the number of companies had increased tenfold. Many library companies were based in London, Paris, Cologne and Rome, and had produced fine catalogues of music and distributed it all across the TV-watching world. But by the late 1980s there were hundreds of library companies producing masses of new music, and production company vinyl shelves were bulging but redundant. Library music had all gone to CD â it was quicker, easier to use, and hey, who the hell wants old library on modern adverts or in the latest TV drama? So by the mid-â90s, these production companies and broadcasters started to dump their obsolete vinyl. This rare, non-commercial music was, for the first time, making its way onto the streets and into shops.\n\nThis coincided perfectly with a handful of slightly odd record collectors who grew up not knowing they had listened to this library music, not knowing that it was library music, and actually wanting to hear and buy this library music. A perfect storm of sorts was building. Especially in Soho, where lots of the old TV production houses were, and they were throwing it out, literally onto the streets.\n\nThe day I issued The Super Sounds Of Bosworth I got a call from a man at the BBC who said heâd skipped thousands of library records a couple of months earlier from the BBC LP archive. I started hearing from other library geeks too. And from then on a quietly growing group of collectors would slowly put together a rather strange picture of the international library music scene â the labels, the key records, the wants lists, the unanswered questions, like whatâs the library bossa nova track used in John Carpenterâs Dark Star? Weird old TV themes were being rediscovered and collectors were realizing that sex, horror, kung fu and classic â70s cop shows had wall to wall library music. So more compilations started to appear from the UK, France, Italy, Germany and then the USA. A whole sample scene was developing too. A bigger picture of library music history and influence was emerging and prices by the year 2000 were rocketing. Â£500 for Drama Suite 1&2, Â£400 for Feelings, Â£300 for Rhythms.\n\nThe internet had also now opened things up, and an international scene for finding these rare records was available to anyone who knew key terms or labels. For the group of early library collectors this offered up chances to find new old labels and to take chances on cheap unknown LPs. By 2005 Iâd issued a book, the first ever on library music, pooling resources from the earliest and best library music collectors here in the UK. The book, published by Fuel and called The Music Library, threw an amazing catalogue of 500+ library LPs and labels out into the world, alerting new collectors and graphic hounds to a still quite hidden musical universe. It also highlighted that their usage and music defined an era of soundtracks and musical education for a whole generation.\n\nThe genre grew further, then like many scenes seemed to fade out a little as record-buying butterflies flew to hipper scenes. But the hardcore remained, and by 2014 I felt that the library music scene was going a bit crazy once more. For some key LPs prices were hitting Â£1,000-plus, and a new group of collectors, especially in the USA, were happy to drop thousands upon thousands on hard-to-find âtrophiesâ and then were posting them up online. Also, ten years on from The Music Library book Iâd seen a big jump in knowledge, labels and LPs, so I put together a larger, fully expanded new version of it.\n\nAnd now, in 2019, we have a library music film, sold-out live shows by British library legends, more reissues than ever and maybe even more in store for us all.\n\nIn 25 years of collecting library music I have learnt a lot. And Iâm still learning. And still buying it, too. In short, library music from the golden era â the midââ60s to the midââ80s â offers dedicated listeners the most extraordinary and rich vein of sound and music, one full of joy, pure creativity and sonic risk-taking like no other. But no vocals."
