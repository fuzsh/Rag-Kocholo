        "text": "Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande scored the most nominations for the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced today.\n\nThe superstar singers are up for seven awards for their collaboration, “Rain On Me,” with Gaga earning two solo nods for artist of the year and best quarantine performance. Meanwhile, Grande’s nods include two nominations for her Justin Bieber collaboration “Stuck with U,” which is up for best collaboration and best music video from home.\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic that has kept musicians and their fans at home as people are encouraged to continue social distancing to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, MTV has added the best music video from home and best quarantine performance categories to this year’s awards.\n\nOther top contenders this year include six-time nominees Billie Eilish and The Weeknd, with Taylor Swift up for five awards for her videos for “Lover” and “The Man” off of her Lover album.\n\nFor the top prize of video of the year, Gaga and Grande’s “Rain on Me” will face off against Swift’s “The Man,” Eilish’s “everything i wanted,” The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights,” Eminem featuring Juice WRLD’s “Godzilla” and Future featuring Drake’s “Life is Good.”\n\nFans can vote here for their favorites across 15 gender-neutral categories, with voting for best new artist remaining active into the awards show.\n\nViacomCBS Media Networks’ president of music, music talent, programming and events Bruce Gillmer said in a statement that fans can expect “a show that celebrates the powerful unifying force of music.”\n\nThe 2020 VMAs are set to take place in New York City, with performances from iconic locations across the five boroughs, designed “to honor the spirit and resilience” of the city hit particularly hard by the pandemic this spring. Elements of the ceremony taking place at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, meanwhile, will take place with “limited or no audience,” according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who revealed the show’s Barclays Center location at a briefing last month. Still, the VMAs will be the first event to take place at the Brooklyn arena since the pandemic forced the closure of live-entertainment venues, and cancellation of concerts and other events, including professional sports, in New York.\n\nAfter a particularly rough experience with the pandemic, with as many as 11,000 new cases a day in April, New York has seen the number of daily new coronavirus cases decline since then and stay below 1,000 a day for the past month.\n\nThe VMAs were last held at the Barclays Center in 2013 with last year’s ceremony taking place across the river at New Jersey’s Prudential Center.\n\nThe 2020 MTV Video Music Awards will air live on Sunday, Aug. 30 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nA full list of this year’s VMA nominees follows.\n\nVIDEO OF THE YEAR\n\nBillie Eilish – “everything i wanted” – Darkroom / Interscope Records\n\nEminem ft.
