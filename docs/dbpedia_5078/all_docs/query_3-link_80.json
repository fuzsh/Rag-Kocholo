        "text": "Another month has passed us by, and August brings us closer to the end of the season. However, several new tracks and albums have dropped to lift our spirits. With brand new projects like Khalid's Sincere, Maren Morris' Intermission, and 49 Winchester's Leavin' This Holler, the beginning of August promises bright things ahead.\n\nA slew of singles dropped, too, from exciting collaborations like Charli XCX's \"Guess\" remix with Billie Eilish and Jessie Murph's new track with Teddy Swims to new offerings from Big Sean, Jhené Aiko, Jelly Roll, Suki Waterhouse, and more. Whether you're looking for full projects or a few new playlist additions, you will not be disappointed.\n\nAs you prepare to close out summer, be sure to check out these 10 new songs and albums.\n\nCharli XCX & Billie Eilish — \"Guess\"\n\nJust 24 hours after Charli XCX set the internet ablaze with a tease of her next collaboration, she not only unveiled the special guest, but she also dropped the track as a New Music Friday-eve gift: a remix of \"Guess\" with her fellow pop queen, Billie Eilish.\n\nThe pulsating song keeps the same club-ready aesthetic of the original from Charli XCX's brat, but taps into the sexual fluidity of Eilish's HIT ME HARD AND SOFT with the \"LUNCH\" singer adding a new verse (fans particularly went into a frenzy over Eilish's line \"Charli likes boys but she knows I'd hit it\"). The track offers a raunchy brand of girl power, further emphasized by the underwear-strewn video, as the unworn undergarments will be donated to survivors of domestic violence through I Support the Girls.\n\nKacey Musgraves — 'Deeper into the Well'\n\nSeven-time GRAMMY-winner Kacey Musgraves is expanding the well she first introduced in March. With the release of Deeper Well, Musgraves showcased a softer side of herself that she discovered during periods of self-introspection following significant changes in her life.\n\nNow, with Deeper into the Well, she takes us further along on her journey. Musgraves gave a taste of the additional seven songs with the release of her single \"Irish Goodbye,\" which narrates the tale of someone struggling to find forgiveness for someone who abruptly left. The extended edition also includes two new features, \"Perfection\" with Tiny Habits and \"Superbloom\" with Leon Bridges.\n\nThe release comes one month before Musgraves is set to kick off her Deeper Well World Tour in Pennsylvania; she'll hit cities on both coasts, and conclude in Nashville in December.\n\nRead More: For The Record: Why Kacey Musgraves' Timeless Album Golden Hour Still Shines 5 Years Later\n\nSaweetie — \"My Best\"\n\nMaintaining her message of confidence and self-worth, Saweetie releases \"My Best,\" an unapologetic anthem that emphasizes knowing your worth and surrounding yourself with people who prioritize your best interests.\n\nThe music video visually represents Saweetie's personal growth, both as an individual and as an artist. Shot at hometown landmarks like her high school and childhood neighborhood, she invites fans on a nostalgic journey of introspection — while also reminding them to stay true to themselves.\n\nLearn More: Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee: Saweetie On Her Long-Awaited Album Pretty B^^^^ Music & Why Women Rappers \"No Longer Need A Co-Sign\"\n\nTones and I — 'Beautifully Ordinary'\n\nFour years after her smash \"Dance Monkey\" took over the world, Tones and I releases her second studio album, Beautifully Ordinary. The follow-up to 2021's Welcome to the Madhouse, the 16-song project reflects the artist's growth, exploring themes of nostalgia, love, and self-acceptance. Each song invites listeners to embark on an emotional, personal journey with Tones and I, offering a source of catharsis for those who relate to her experiences.\n\nTones and I first gave listeners a taste of the project in June with lead single \"Dance With Me,\" a track that delves into themes of heartbreak and desperation. Despite its underlying message of loneliness, the track retains Tones and I's signature upbeat rhythms and vibrant instrumentals — and the rest of Beautifully Ordinary follows suit, offering intimate and heartfelt narratives through her radiant musicality.\n\nSam Smith — 'In The Lonely Hour (10th Anniversary Edition)'\n\nCelebrating the six-times-platinum debut album that catapulted them to stardom, Sam Smith is releasing the 10th anniversary edition of In The Lonely Hour. This special edition features a reimagined version of their classic \"Stay With Me,\" and a brand new track, \"Little Sailor.\"\n\nThe original project launched Smith's career into the stratosphere, receiving critical acclaim and earning them four golden gramophones at the 2015 GRAMMYs, including Best New Artist.\n\n\"I feel so incredibly lucky to be celebrating this milestone with you,\" Smith wrote on Instagram. \"My team and I have created this beautiful anniversary edition for us all, and for the last 10 years.\"\n\nLearn More: 9 Times Queer Artists Made History At The GRAMMYs: From Elton John's Collab With BSB To Kim & Sam's \"Unholy\" Union\n\nKiller Mike — 'Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints'\n\nFresh off going three-for-three at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Killer Mike delivers another potent project, Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints. A follow-up to his autobiographical album 'MICHAEL', the 10-song collection dives deeper into his personal narrative, offering an epilogue filled with introspection and celebration — including the poignant track \"HUMBLE ME,\" which reflects on his arrest after winning his GRAMMYs in February.\n\nKiller Mike provided fans with a gift, releasing the album as a free download for the first 48 hours. In support of the release, Killer Mike electrified audiences with six performances over three nights at the legendary Blue Note jazz club in NYC, including a live-streamed show that attracted nearly 100,000 viewers. This project is a testament to Killer Mike's ongoing dialogue with his audience, addressing both tribulations and triumphs. As the tour continues with a stop at Lollapalooza just one day after the album's release, fans can engage further with tracks like \"NOBODY KNOWS\" and \"HIGHER LEVEL,\" which offer a glimpse into the rapper’s evolving journey and continued impact on hip-hop.\n\nTiera Kennedy — \"Cry\"\n\nStill riding high from her vocals featured on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER, country star Tiera Kennedy releases her latest single, \"Cry,\" which samples Justin Timberlake's 2002 Timbaland-produced hit \"Cry Me A River.\" It's another taste of Kennedy's forthcoming debut album, which she dubs \"R&B/country.\"\n\n\"I've been really inspired by the music I grew up listening to,\" Kennedy shared in an Instagram video. \"Timbaland had a hand in a lot of those songs.\"\n\nKnown for her distinctive approach to blending genres, Kennedy invites listeners to immerse themselves in her world of creative storytelling with her latest track. \"Cry\" explores the narrative of someone who has made their bed and has to lie in it, while Kennedy has already moved on.\n\nExplore More: A Brief History Of Black Country Music: 11 Important Tracks From DeFord Bailey, Kane Brown & More\n\nGryffin — 'PULSE'\n\nReturning with his third studio album, electronic artist Gryffin embarks on a new era and unveils a fresh side of his artistry with PULSE. The 14-track album features collaborations with a range of artists, including Rita Ora, Disco Lines, MAX, and more.\n\n\"PULSE is a return to why I fell in love with dance music in the first place, and this is the most creatively inspired I've felt in years,\" said Gryffin on Instagram. \"I can't wait for you all to hear the new sound and feel the passion I've put into these tracks.\"\n\nJohn K — \"Lost\"\n\nAfter more than a year of not releasing music, John K is back with a new single, \"Lost.\" It's a song that vulnerably reveals feelings of completeness after finding the right person — a fitting narrative for the happily married singer, who is expecting his second child with his wife, Lenée. . Becoming a father is one of the several major life changes John K has experienced in the past few years, all of which have shaped his upcoming music and brought his musical artistry to the next stage.\n\n\"I was writing with the aim of challenging myself to do something I hadn't done before,\" John K said in a press statement. \"I shattered the box of what I thought I had to be, and it allowed me to get to deeper levels of honesty and really gain even more confidence. I took risks, and I honestly expressed myself.\n\nJack White — 'No Name'\n\nAfter releasing two albums within four months in 2022, Jack White has essentially gone silent since — until now. Just two days after announcing his sixth studio album, No Name, the rock icon unveils his latest masterpiece.\n\nThe 13-track album stays true to White's DIY philosophy, with the recording, production, and mixing all handled by the artist himself at his own Third Man Studio. Even before the album dropped on Aug. 2, reviews were already glowing, with Variety calling it the album \"fans have been lusting for\" due to its parallels to the rip-roaring rock of his former band the White Stripes — but \"without seeming retro or leaning too heavily on nostalgia.\"\n\nExplore More: Songbook: A Guide To Jack White's Musical Outlets, From The White Stripes To The Dead Weather & Beyond\n\nBootsy Collins — \"Pure Perfection\"\n\nAhead of his forthcoming album, Album of the Year #1 Funkateer, Bootsy Collins has released \"Pure Perfection,\" a smooth, sultry track featuring German rapper FANTAAZMA and rapper Giz. The track also features one of the funk icon's legendary alter-egos, \"Bedroom Bootsy,\" who brings a sultry tone to the tune.\n\nDue Oct. 25 (the day before Collins' 73rd birthday), Album of the Year #1 Funkateer includes an 18-song track list with contributions from Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and more. And if the smooth, thumping vibe of \"Pure Perfection\" is any indication, the funk vet is ready to take fans on a trippy musical journey — one that only Bootsy Collins can moderate.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWarren Zeiders' Big Year: The Country Star Recounts His Journey From 'Pretty Little Poison' To 'Relapse'\n\nWatch MonoNeon Share His Bass\n\nLiving Legends: Beres Hammond On His Enduring Career, Timeless Music & 'Brand, Jamaica!'\n\nGet Ready For Fool In Love Fest With This Soulful Playlist: Hits & B-Sides From Chaka Khan, Thee Sacred Souls, Smokey Robinson & More\n\n10 Ways Oasis' 'Definitely Maybe' Shaped The Sound Of '90s Rock\n\nThree months after OneRepublic began promoting their sixth album, Artificial Paradise, in February 2022, the band unexpectedly had their biggest release in nearly a decade. The pop-rock band's carefree jam, \"I Ain't Worried,\" soundtracked Top Gun: Maverick's most memeable scene and quickly became a global smash — ultimately delaying album plans in favor of promoting their latest hit.\n\nTwo years later, \"I Ain't Worried\" is one of 16 tracks on Artificial Paradise, which arrived July 12. It's a seamless blend of songs that will resonate with longtime and newer fans alike. From the layered production of \"Hurt,\" to the feel-good vibes of \"Serotonin,\" to the evocative lyrics of \"Last Holiday,\" Artificial Paradise shows that OneRepublic's sound is as dialed-in as it is ever-evolving.\n\nThe album also marks the end of an era for OneRepublic, as it's the last in their contract with Interscope Records. But for the group's singer, Ryan Tedder, that means the future is even more exciting than it's been in their entire 15-year career.\n\n\"I've never been more motivated to write the best material of my life than this very moment,\" he asserts. \"I'm taking it as a challenge. We've had a lot of fun, and a lot of uplifting records for the last seven or eight years, but I also want to tap back into some deeper material with the band.\"\n\nAs he's been prepping Artificial Paradise with his OneRepublic cohorts, Tedder has also been as busy as he's ever been working with other artists. His career as a songwriter/producer took off almost simultaneously with OneRepublic's 2007 breakthrough, \"Apologize\" (his first major behind-the-board hit was Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\"); to this day he's one of the go-to guys for pop's biggest names, from BLACKPINK to Tate McRae.\n\nTedder sat down with GRAMMY.com to share some of his most prominent memories of OneRepublic's biggest songs, as well as some of the hits he's written with Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift and more.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Apologize,\" 'Dreaming Out Loud' (2007)\n\nI was producing and writing other songs for different artists on Epic and Atlantic — I was just cutting my teeth as a songwriter in L.A. This is like 2004. I was at my lowest mentally and financially. I was completely broke. Creditors chasing me, literally dodging the taxman and getting my car repoed, everything.\n\nI had that song in my back pocket for four years. A buddy of mine just reminded me last month, a songwriter from Nashville — Ashley Gorley, actually. We had a session last month, me, him and Amy Allen, and he brought it up. He was like, \"Is it true, the story about 'Apologize'? You were completely broke living in L.A. and Epic Records offered you like 100 grand or something just for the right to record the song on one of their artists?\"\n\nAnd that is true. It was, like, 20 [grand], then 50, then 100. And I was salivating. I was, like, I need this money so bad. And I give so many songs to other people, but with that song, I drew a line in the sand and said, \"No one will sing this song but me. I will die with this song.\"\n\nIt was my story, and I just didn't want anyone else to sing it. It was really that simple. It was a song about my past relationships, it was deeply personal. And it was also the song that — I spent two years trying to figure out what my sound was gonna be. I was a solo artist… and I wasn't landing on anything compelling. Then I landed on \"Apologize\" and a couple of other songs, and I was like, These songs make me think of a band, not solo artist material. So it was the song that led me to the sound of OneRepublic, and it also led me to the idea that I should start a band and not be a solo artist.\n\nWe do it every night. I'll never not do it. I've never gotten sick of it once. Every night that we do it, whether I'm in Houston or Hong Kong, I look out at the crowd and look at the band, and I'm like, Wow. This is the song that got us here.\n\nBeyoncé — \"Halo,\" 'I Am…Sacha Fierce' (2008)\n\nWe were halfway through promoting Dreaming Out Loud, our first album. I played basketball every day on tour, and I snapped my Achilles. The tour got canceled. The doctor told me not to even write. And I had this one sliver of an afternoon where my wife had to run an errand. And because I'm sadistic and crazy, I texted [songwriter] Evan Bogart, \"I got a three-hour window, race over here. Beyoncé called me and asked me to write her a song. I want to do it with you.\" He had just come off his huge Rihanna No. 1, and we had an Ashley Tisdale single together.\n\nWhen you write enough songs, not every day do the clouds part and God looks down on you and goes, \"Here.\" But that's what happened on that day. I turn on the keyboard, the first sound that I play is the opening sound of the song. Sounds like angels singing. And we wrote the song pretty quick, as I recall.\n\nI didn't get a response [from Beyoncé after sending \"Halo\" over], which I've now learned is very, very typical of her. I did Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé \"II MOST WANTED\" [from COWBOY CARTER] — I didn't know that was coming out 'til five days before it came out. And when I did \"XO\" [from 2013's Beyoncé], I found out that \"XO\" was coming out 12 hours before it came out. That's how she operates.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Good Life,\" 'Waking Up' (2009)\n\n[\"Good Life\"] was kind of a Hail Mary. We already knew that \"All the Right Moves\" would be the first single [from Waking Up]. We knew that \"Secrets\" was the second single. And in the 11th hour, our engineer at the time — who I ended up signing as a songwriter, Noel Zancanella — had this drum loop that he had made, and he played it for Brent [Kutzle] in our band. Brent said, \"You gotta hear this drum loop that Noel made. It's incredible.\"\n\nHe played it for me the next morning, and I was like, \"Yo throw some chords to this. I'm writing to this today.\" They threw some chords down, and the first thing out of my mouth was, [sings] \"Oh, this has gotta be the good life.\"\n\nIt's the perfect example of, oftentimes, the chord I've tried to strike with this band with some of our bigger records, [which] is happy sad. Where you feel nostalgic and kind of melancholic, but at the same time, euphoric. That's what those chords and that melody did for me.\n\nI was like, \"Hey guys, would it be weird if I made the hook a whistle?\" And everyone was like, \"No! Do not whistle!\" They're like, \"Name the last hit song that had a whistle.\" And the only one I could think of was, like, Scorpion from like, 1988. [Laughs.] So I thought, To hell with it, man, it's been long enough, who cares? Let's try it. And the whistle kind of made the record. It became such a signature thing.\n\nAdele — \"Rumour Has It,\" '21' (2011)\n\n\"Rumour Has It\" was the first song I did in probably a four year period, with any artist, that wasn't a ballad. All any artist ever wanted me to write with them or for them, was ballads, because of \"Halo,\" and \"Apologize\" and \"Bleeding Love.\"\n\nI begged [Adele] to do a [song with] tempo, because we did \"Turning Tables,\" another ballad. She was in a feisty mood [that day], so I was like, \"Okay, we're doing a tempo today!\"\n\nRick Rubin was originally producing the whole album. I was determined to produce Adele, not just write — because I wanted a shot to show her that I could, and to show myself. I stayed later after she left, and I remember thinking, What can I do in this record in this song that could be so difficult to reproduce that it might land me the gig?\n\nSo I intentionally muted the click track, changed the tempo, and [created that] whole piano bridge. I was making it up as I went. When she got in that morning. I said, \"I have a crazy idea for a bridge. It's a movie.\" She listens and she says, \"This is really different, I like this! How do we write to this?\"\n\nI mean, it was very difficult. [But] we finished the song. She recorded the entire song that day. She recorded the whole song in one take. I've never seen anyone do that in my life — before or since.\n\nThen I didn't hear from her for six months. Because I handed over the files, and Rick Rubin's doing it, so I don't need to check on it. I randomly check on the status of the song — and at this point, if you're a songwriter or producer, you're assuming that they're not keeping the songs. Her manager emails my manager, \"Hey, good news — she's keeping both songs they did, and she wants Ryan to finish 'Rumour Has It' production and mix it.\"\n\nWhen I finally asked her, months later — probably at the GRAMMYs — I said, \"Why didn't [Rick] do it?\" She said, \"Oh he did. It's that damn bridge! Nobody could figure out what the hell you were doing…It was so problematic that we just gave up on it.\"\n\nOneRepublic — \"Counting Stars,\" 'Native' (2013)\n\nI was in a Beyoncé camp in the Hamptons writing for the self-titled album. [There were] a bunch of people in the house — me, Greg Kurstin, Sia — it was a fun group of people. I had four days there, and every morning I'd get up an hour and a half before I had to leave, make a coffee, and start prepping for the day. On the third day, I got up, I'm in the basement of this house at like 7 in the morning, and I'm coming up with ideas. I stumble across that chord progression, the guitar and the melody. It was instant shivers up my spine.\n\n\"Lately I've been losing sleep, dreaming about the things that we could be\" is the only line that I had. [My] first thought was, I should play this for Beyoncé, and then I'm listening to it and going, This is not Beyoncé, not even remotely. It'd be a waste. So I tabled it, and I texted the guys in my band, \"Hey, I think I have a potentially really big record. I'm going to finish it when I get back to Denver.\"\n\nI got back the next week, started recording it, did four or five versions of the chorus, bouncing all the versions off my wife, and then eventually landed it. And when I played it for the band, they were like, \"This is our favorite song.\"\n\nTaylor Swift — \"Welcome to New York,\" '1989' (2014)\n\nIt was my second session with Taylor. The first one was [1989's] \"I Know Places,\" and she sent me a voice memo. I was looking for a house in Venice [California], because we were spending so much time in L.A. So that whole memory is attached to me migrating back to Los Angeles.\n\nBut I knew what she was talking about, because I lived in New York, and I remember the feeling — endless possibilities, all the different people and races and sexes and loves. That was her New York chapter. She was so excited to be there. If you never lived there, and especially if you get there and you've got a little money in the pocket, it is so exhilarating.\n\nIt was me just kind of witnessing her brilliant, fast-paced, lyrical wizardry. [Co-producer] Max [Martin] and I had a conversation nine months later at the GRAMMYs, when we had literally just won for 1989. He kind of laughed, he pointed to all the other producers on the album, and he's like, \"If she had, like, three more hours in the day, she would just figure out what we do and she would do it. And she wouldn't need any of us.\"\n\nAnd I still think that's true. Some people are just forces of nature in and among themselves, and she's one of them. She just blew me away. She's the most talented top liner I've ever been in a room with, bar none. If you're talking lyric and melody, I've never been in a room with anyone faster, more adept, knows more what they want to say, focused, efficient, and just talented.\n\nJonas Brothers — \"Sucker,\" 'Happiness Begins' (2019)\n\nI had gone through a pretty dry spell mentally, emotionally. I had just burned it at both ends and tapped out, call it end of 2016. So, really, all of 2017 for me was a blur and a wash. I did a bunch of sessions in the first three months of the year, and then I just couldn't get a song out. I kept having, song after song, artists telling me it's the first single, [then] the song was not even on the album. I had never experienced that in my career.\n\nI went six to nine months without finishing a song, which for me is unheard of. Andrew Watt kind of roped me back into working with him. We did \"Easier\" for 5 Seconds of Summer, and we did some Sam Smith and some Miley Cyrus, and right in that same window, I did this song \"Sucker.\" Two [or] three months later, Wendy Goldstein from Republic [Records] heard the record, I had sent it to her. She'd said, very quietly, \"We're relaunching the Jonas Brothers. They want you to be involved in a major way. Do you have anything?\"\n\nShe calls me, she goes, \"Ryan, do not play this for anybody else. This is their comeback single. It's a No. 1 record. Watch what we're gonna do.\" And she delivered.\n\nOneRepublic — \"I Ain't Worried,\" 'Top Gun: Maverick' Soundtrack (2022)\n\nMy memory is, being in lockdown in COVID, and just being like, Who knows when this is going to end, working out of my Airstream at my house. I had done a lot of songs for movies over the years, and [for] that particular [song] Randy Spendlove, who runs [music at] Paramount, called me.\n\nI end up Zooming with Tom Cruise [and Top Gun: Maverick director] Jerry Bruckheimer — everybody's in lockdown during post-production. The overarching memory was, Holy cow, I'm doing the scene, I'm doing the song for Top Gun. I can't believe this is happening. But the only way I knew how to approach it, rather than to, like, overreact and s— the bed, was, It's just another day.\n\nI do prescription songs for movies, TV, film all the time. I love a brief. It's so antithetical to most writers. I'm either uncontrollably lazy or the most productive person you've ever met. And the dividing line between the two is, if I'm chasing some directive, some motivation, some endpoint, then I can be wildly productive.\n\nI just thought, I'm going to do the absolute best thing I can do for this scene and serve the film. OneRepublic being the performing artist was not on the menu in my mind. I just told them, \"I think you need a cool indie band sounding, like, breakbeat.\" I used adjectives to describe what I heard when I saw the scene, and Tom got really ramped and excited.\n\nYou could argue [it's the biggest song] since the band started. The thing about it is, it's kind of become one of those every summer [hits]. And when it blew up, that's what Tom said. He said, \"Mark my words, dude. You're gonna have a hit with this every summer for, like, the next 20 years or more.\"\n\nAnd that's what happened. The moment Memorial Day happened, \"I Ain't Worried\" got defrosted and marched itself back into the top 100.\n\nTate McRae — \"Greedy,\" 'THINK LATER' (2023)\n\nWe had \"10:35\" [with Tiësto] the previous year that had been, like, a No. 1 in the UK and across Europe and Australia. So we were coming off the back of that, and the one thing she was clear about was, \"That is not the direction of what I want to do.\"\n\nIf my memory serves me correct, \"greedy\" was the next to last session we had. Everything we had done up to that point was kind of dark, midtempo, emotional. So \"greedy\" was the weirdo outlier. I kept pushing her to do a dance record. I was like, \"Tate, there's a lot of people that have great voices, and there's a lot of people who can write, but none of those people are professional dancers like you are. Your secret weapon is the thing you're not using. In this game and this career, you've got to use every asset that you have and exploit it.\"\n\nThere was a lot of cajoling. On that day, we did it, and I thought it was badass, and loved it. And she was like, \"Ugh, what do we just do? What is this?\"\n\nSo then it was just, like, months, months and months of me constantly bringing that song back up, and playing it for her, and annoying the s— out of her. And she came around on it.\n\nShe has very specific taste. So much of the music with Tate, it really is her steering. I'll do what I think is like a finished version of a song, and then she will push everyone for weeks, if not months, to extract every ounce of everything out of them, to push the song harder, further, edgier — 19 versions of a song, until finally she goes, \"Okay, this is the one.\" She's a perfectionist.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Last Holiday,\" 'Artificial Paradise' (2024)\n\nI love [our latest single] \"Hurt,\" but my favorite song on the album is called \"Last Holiday.\" I probably started the beginning of that lyric, I'm not joking, seven, eight years ago. But I didn't finish it 'til this past year.\n\nThe verses are little maxims and words of advice that I've been given throughout the years. It's almost cynical in a way, the song. When I wrote the chorus, I was definitely in kind of a down place. So the opening line is, \"So I don't believe in the stars anymore/ They never gave me what I wished for.\" And it's, obviously, a very not-so-slight reference to \"Counting Stars.\" But it's also hopeful — \"We've got some problems, okay, but this isn't our last holiday.\"\n\nIt's very simple sentiments. Press pause. Take some moments. Find God before it all ends. All these things with this big, soaring chorus. Musically and emotionally and sonically, that song — and \"Hurt,\" for sure — but \"Last Holiday\" is extremely us-sounding.\n\nThe biggest enemy that we've had over the course of 18 years, I'll be the first to volunteer, is, this ever-evolving, undulating sound. No one's gonna accuse me of making these super complex concept albums, because that's just not how my brain's wired. I grew up listening to the radio. I didn't grow up hanging out in the Bowery in CBGBs listening to Nick Cave. So for us, the downside to that, and for me doing all these songs for all these other people, is the constant push and pull of \"What is their sound? What genre is it?\"\n\nI couldn't put a pin in exactly what the sound is, but what I would say is, if you look at the last 18 years, a song like \"Last Holiday\" really encompasses, sonically, what this band is about. It's very moving, and emotional, and dynamic. It takes me to a place — that's the best way for me to put it. And hopefully the listener finds the same.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWarren Zeiders' Big Year: The Country Star Recounts His Journey From 'Pretty Little Poison' To 'Relapse'\n\nWatch MonoNeon Share His Bass\n\nLiving Legends: Beres Hammond On His Enduring Career, Timeless Music & 'Brand, Jamaica!'\n\nGet Ready For Fool In Love Fest With This Soulful Playlist: Hits & B-Sides From Chaka Khan, Thee Sacred Souls, Smokey Robinson & More\n\n10 Ways Oasis' 'Definitely Maybe' Shaped The Sound Of '90s Rock"
