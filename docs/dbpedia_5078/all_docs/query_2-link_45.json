        "text": "NEW YORK – On November 18th, Atlantic Records/Home Grown/Big Picture will release Zac Brown Band’s ‘The Foundation,’ a collection of 12 songs that draw inspiration from the band’s Southern roots and everyday life experiences. It’s music that resonates no matter where you call home.\n\nZac Brown Band’s signature sound is equal parts country, bluegrass, southern rock, pop and reggae. Lead by the tenacious Zac Brown, the band possesses awe-inspiring musicianship, skillful songwriting and dynamic live performances that have been embraced by audiences across the country. “Chicken Fried,” the album’s first single - which sold almost 150,000 downloads in the first five weeks and currently ranks #6 on Billboard’s Hot Country and #36 on Billboard Hot 100 – has already established the band as a radio favorite. Watch the “Chicken Fried” music video, directed by Clifton Collins Jr. at:\n\nhttp://www.cmt.com/videos/zac-brown-band/289363/chicken-fried.jhtml\n\nProduced by the legendary Keith Stegall (Alan Jackson, George Jones), ‘The Foundation’ features “Whatever It Is,” a ballad about the bewildering power of love, “Toes,” an ode to the pleasures of beach life; and “Free,” which has turned into an audience anthem during recent tour stops.\n\nZac Brown Band performs upwards of 250 dates a year and has played more than 3,000 shows in their career and shared the stage with bands such as Sugarland, Alan Jackson, Los Lonely Boys, The Allman Brothers, Willie Nelson, B.B. King, ZZ Top and Etta James. The band's aggressive touring has helped them develop a fanatical grassroots following by winning over believers one person at a time.\n\n“Zac Brown Band is a self-made American success story,” said Atlantic Records Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman. “They’ve built up a phenomenal grassroots base with music that cuts across musical boundaries and walks of life to speak to the hearts of people everywhere. They are the perfect band for our times, with the songs, the musicianship, and the power to become a major presence. I am thrilled to welcome Zac Brown Band into the Atlantic family, and we are looking forward to joining forces to take their career to new heights.”\n\nZac Brown Band is: singer/guitarist Zac Brown, fiddler Jimmy De Martini, bassist John Hopkins, guitarist/organist Coy Bowles and drummer Chris Fryar.\n\nSince recording ‘The Foundation’ Zac Brown Band has also engaged Keith Stegall’s Nashville-based Big Picture Entertainment Group, and its subsidiary Bigger Picture Promotion, led by Michael Powers and Jeff Solima, in spearheading radio promotions.\n\nZac Brown Band is managed by ROAR, a Beverly Hills, California-based talent and brand management company with offices in Nashville, Atlanta and New York.\n\nFor more information on Zac Brown Band, please contact Rebecca Shapiro (rshapiro@shorefire.com) or Elizabeth Lutz (elutz@shorefire.com) at Shore Fire Media, 718.522.7171 or Sheila Richman at Atlantic Records, 212-707-3063 sheila.richman@atlanticrecords.com or Liz Norris at ROAR 917-755-1005 norris@roar.la ."
