        "text": "On February 15, Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) opens offices at 580 5th Ave. in New York City and is declared operational. Neville Miller becomes President, Kaye is elected operating head and attorney, and experienced broadcaster and sales executive, Carl Haverlin, is hired to direct station relations.\n\nIts open door policy sets it apart. BMI welcomes all individuals, regardless of their chosen musical genre, and, unlike ASCAP, even if they have no established successful material.\n\nAt the time, most music on radio is performed by live orchestras and entertainers. BMI immediately begins providing new repertoire for radio broadcasts, printing one new popular song a day and 25 new arrangements of public domain music. BMI rapidly builds its catalog, establishing itself as a competitive source of music. Prominent Tin Pan Alley publisher E.B. Marks is one of the first firms to leave ASCAP and join BMI. The firm’s arrival swells the number of BMI-licensed copyrights, as do Latin, blues and country music songs published by Ralph Peer, whose international catalog proves especially valuable in helping BMI get started. Other major name publishers to join include M.M. Cole and American Music.\n\nBy September, BMI has 220 full-time employees. America has about 800 radio stations and by year’s end a total of 660 stations have signed with BMI.\n\nOn October 15, BMI holds its first stockholders’ meeting and reports that it has obtained the performing rights to more than twenty-five thousand compositions.\n\nASCAP’s five-year radio contract runs out at midnight on December 31, and except for about 200 small stations that had worked out license agreements, broadcasters can no longer use its music. The press calls it a “blackout” or “ban,” but it is, in fact, illegal for broadcasters to air ASCAP music. For most of the following year, most radio stations use only BMI-licensed songs or public domain material.\n\nIn May, the radio industry reaches a settlement with ASCAP, ending the 11-month battle and returning ASCAP’s music to America’s airwaves. With settlements reached, some radio leaders question the need for BMI. Others, though, see the need to continue opening doors for new music. Carl Haverlin tours the nation as Director of Station Relations, convincing hundreds of radio stations to renew their BMI licenses, as well as signing up new stations. Haverlin also spearheads BMI’s quest to license more non-radio venues for music, such as hotels, nightclubs and skating rinks.\n\nRobert J. Burton, a Columbia Law School trained attorney and copyright expert, joins BMI as Junior House Counsel.\n\nBMI offices open at 1549 North Vine Street, Hollywood, California, strategically located near all the major motion picture studios, the NBC and CBS radio network offices and the major nightclubs of the day.\n\nThe designation “rhythm & blues” makes its appearance in Billboard, laying to rest the derogatory designation “race music” that had been used to categorize blues and other black musical forms. Racial segregation of music consumers and producers still exist, but the acceptance of black music by white listeners helps erode long-standing social barriers. BMI stands virtually alone in representing the performing rights of R&B creators and publishers, licensing more than 90 percent of R&B radio hits on a weekly basis.\n\nGospel musicians like Tommy Dorsey grow more popular than ever. Gospel, R&B and country musical influences fuse to give birth to a new genre that will sweep America and the world – rock and roll. BMI represents virtually all of the founders of the genre.\n\nSpeaking at a Grand Ole Opry celebration in Nashville, Carl Haverlin sees the future of music “seeking its own level. . .an amalgamation of musical styles has begun, and it will end with American music finding its own unique character.”\n\nApproaching its 10th anniversary, BMI salutes its broadcast heritage by hosting a dinner for broadcast shareholders attending the annual NAB convention, beginning a tradition that continues to the present day.\n\nFor the first time, BMI music takes the top three places on Billboard’s “Honor Roll of Hits.”\n\nBMI is asked to provide the banquet entertainment for the annual broadcasters’ convention in Chicago. The show is built around the then-current hit “Tennessee Waltz” and features Roy Acuff, Pee Wee King and His Golden West Cowboys, Red Foley, the Dinning Sisters and other stars from Nashville. It is the first time that country music has been presented to an audience of the nation’s leading broadcasters and ad agencies.\n\nThe BMI Student Composer Competition is established in cooperation with music educators and composers. Cash prizes are awarded to encourage the creation of concert music by student composers and to aid in their musical education. The Student Composer Awards are still held annually and are celebrating their 62nd anniversary this year.\n\nAs country, R&B, and rock and roll surge on the airwaves, BMI music begins to dominate the charts. BMI songs capture the first 5 places on Your Hit Parade in March 1952. Cashbox magazine, a successful competitor to Billboard, puts BMI music at 81.8 percent to ASCAP’s 18.2 percent in the pop, country and R&B categories that are favorites on America’s jukeboxes, a sudden and dramatic reversal of roles for the two performing rights organizations.\n\nThea Zavin joins BMI as Resident Counsel and heads the company’s Legal Department for many years. Throughout her nearly 50 years of service, she leads the support of copyright protection on behalf of songwriters and publishers, also serving as President of the Copyright Society of the USA and a member of the CISAC (International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) Legal and Legislative Committee and the Copyright Office Advisory Committee.\n\nRay Charles starts recording with Atlantic Records, by then a small record label that could give special attention to the promising artist. Charles, like Sam Cooke, brings gospel fervor to R&B, changing the sound of that genre forever with hits like “I Got a Woman” and “What’d I Say.” Frank Sinatra once called Charles “the only genius in the business.”\n\nIn what music historians call “the War on Rock and Roll,” a group of 30 ASCAP songwriters calling themselves “the Songwriters of America” initiate a $150 million anti-trust action against BMI, NBC, CBS, ABC, RCA Victor Records, Columbia Records, and 27 individuals, claiming that a conspiracy of broadcasters and record manufacturers was keeping “good music” from being recorded and played on the air. Their sweeping charges could not be substantiated, and, more than 15 years and millions of dollars in legal and research fees later, the suit was dismissed with prejudice - meaning that it couldn’t be brought again.\n\nIn the interim, the plaintiffs continued their efforts to grab headlines and the attention of Congress. They found a sympathetic ear in Congressman Emanuel Celler, Chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. In hearings conducted during this time, the Songwriters of America made impassioned accusations against BMI, condemning rock and roll and all the music that BMI represented. Dozens of BMI writers and publishers - including Governor Jimmie Davis, Sam Phillips, Nat King Cole and opera singer Anna Moffo - rallied in BMI’s defense, appearing before the Congressional committee and writing letters of support. After dozens of witnesses and 1,200 pages of testimony, the anti-BMI bill stalled in the Senate sub-committee and died. Undaunted, and with continued backing by the ASCAP writers, the Celler Committee, without specific recommendations, referred the matter to the Justice Department, which declined to pursue it in the courts.\n\nThe war on BMI and rock and roll continued into the early 1960s with a Congressional investigation into “payola” - paying disc jockeys to play certain records - an investigation that some hoped would implicate BMI. It did not.\n\nBMI holds its first annual Country Awards event, a luncheon featuring live music by Nashville’s best musicians. Awards are presented to country music writers and publishers; Hank Williams is the event’s big winner. The BMI Country Awards are not only the first to salute country songwriters, but the first to honor Nashville music makers in any way.\n\nBrian Holland, member of the legendary songwriting and production team Holland-Dozier-Holland (HDH), joins BMI. Fellow HDH member Lamont Dozier joins BMI a year later, followed by Eddie Holland in 1963. Together, they amass 28 Top 20 hits in three years for Motown acts like the Four Tops and the Supremes, including “Stop! In the Name of Love.”\n\nSam Cooke, a young gospel singer and budding entrepreneur raised in Chicago, forms his own BMI publishing company, management company and record label, paving the way for future generations of music moguls to do the same. Four years later, after writing and recording the inspirational song about the black civil rights movement, “A Change Is Gonna Come,” he is fatally shot in a Los Angeles motel under mysterious circumstances. The outpouring of grief in the African-American community is overwhelming, and Lou Rawls, Bobby “Blue” Bland and Ray Charles sing at his funeral.\n\nBMI President Del Bryant and other senior executives head to Washington with 2012 BMI Country Songwriter of the Year, Luke Laird, and multi-GRAMMY nominated Claude Kelly to educate Congressional policy staff, legislators and Washington lobbyists on the craft of songwriting and the value of music.\n\nBMI makes enhancements to BMI Mobile app to enable writers to easily access and manage their BMI-related business needs on an iPhone, iPad or Android mobile device.\n\nBMI moves up once again, ranking #26 for technology leadership in InformationWeek’s list of Top 500 Innovative Companies.\n\nBMI reports record-setting revenues and royalty distributions for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Revenues increased by $45 million, a 5% gain over the prior fiscal year, exceeding $944 million.\n\nDel Bryant announces his retirement after 42 years of continuous service to the Company. The BMI Board of Directors unanimously elects Michael O’Neill as CEO, effective September 16, 2013. O’Neill joined BMI in 1995 as Director, Group and National Accounts, and had most recently held the post of Senior Vice President, Repertoire and Licensing. Bryant serves as BMI’s President until June 2014, when O’Neill succeeds him, assuming the additional title of President.\n\nBMI generates total revenues of $1.013 billion, the highest in the Company’s history and the most public performance revenue generated for songwriters, composers and publishers by any music rights organization in the world. This year also marks BMI as the first U.S. PRO to achieve digital revenue which exceeds $100 million. In addition, BMI distributes and administers $877 million to its affiliated songwriters, composers and music publishers, the Company’s largest distribution ever.\n\nBMI wins its rate court battle against digital giant Pandora in landmark case, protecting public performance royalties for songwriters, composers and publishers.\n\nNearly 13,000 BMI affiliates use BMI’s online tool to make their voices heard to the U.S. Department of Justice opposing an interpretation of BMI’s consent decree that would require 100% licensing.\n\nBMI breaks revenue records for the third consecutive year, generating $1.130 billion to end its 2017 fiscal year. The company also distributes and administers $1.023 billion to its songwriters, composers and publishers, becoming the first performing rights organization in the world to deliver in excess of $1 billion to its affiliates.\n\nBMI and ASCAP join forces to create a single, comprehensive database of musical works from their combined repertories that will deliver an authoritative view of ownership shares in the vast majority of music licensed in the United States.\n\nBMI wins round one of its litigation against the U.S. Department of Justice on its interpretation of BMI’s consent decree involving fractional versus 100% licensing.\n\nBMI continues to break revenue records, generating $1.199 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The company also distributes and administers a record $1.118 billion in royalties to its songwriters, composers and publishers, an increase of $95 million over 2017.\n\nMichael Collins joins BMI as Vice President, Government Relations, re-establishing a dedicated presence for BMI in the DC area. Collins leads BMI’s efforts to protect the rights of its songwriters, composers and music publishers at all levels of government, both federally and in states across the country.\n\nAfter BMI wins round one of its litigation against the U.S. Department of Justice on the subject of fractional versus 100% licensing, the DOJ appeals the decision and BMI again prevails, confirming that BMI is free to continue to engage in the industry-wide practice of fractional licensing. This development definitively ends litigation between BMI and the DOJ in this matter, and represents a significant victory for songwriters, composers and publishers, as well as the music industry at large.\n\nThe Music Modernization Act is signed into law, updating U.S. copyright law for the digital age. Representing the most meaningful music licensing reform in decades, the legislation provides several provisions that benefit songwriters with two that directly affect their performance rights. The first is that all future rate court cases involving BMI will be assigned to a judge from a rotating “wheel” of judges—rather than being assigned to a single judge—for the purpose of settling rate disputes. This is the manner in which most court cases are assigned and will ensure that the randomly-assigned judge will have access to a broader range of evidence to consider when setting a rate for digital services. The second, the “benchmark” provision, allows benchmark rates within the industry to be considered in the rate court process so that rates are more consistent across platforms.\n\nAlex Flores joins BMI as Senior Vice President, Creative. Based out of the company’s Los Angeles office, Flores oversees the Creative teams in BMI’s seven offices in New York, Los Angeles, Nashville, Austin, Atlanta, London and San Juan, helping support the Company’s songwriting community while cultivating key industry relationships.\n\nBMI ends its fiscal year once again breaking revenue records with $1.283 billion, distributing and administering $1.196 billion to its songwriters, composers and publishers. These results mark the most reported public performance revenues and highest royalty distributions of any music rights organization in the world.\n\nThe Department of Justice begins a new evaluation of the future of BMI and ASCAP’s consent decrees following Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ Antitrust Division Makan Delrahim’s review of all long-standing decrees in the U.S. As a result, BMI President & CEO Mike O’Neill and ASCAP CEO Elizabeth Matthews issue an open letter to the industry putting forth a proposal for consent decree reform.\n\nBMI opens a new creative office in Austin, marking the company’s first office in Texas and first new creative office in over 20 years. The new office allows BMI to work directly with songwriters, composers, and other music professionals in the Austin music community to help enhance their ability to earn a living in the industry. The office is led by Texas native Mitch Ballard, Senior Director, BMI, Austin, under the direction of Clay Bradley, VP, Creative, Nashville.\n\nAs part of the ongoing DOJ review of the nation’s oldest consent decrees, Senator Orrin Hatch initiates a symposium entitled “Music Licensing in the 21st Century,” in which BMI President and CEO Mike O’Neill participates. Held by the Hatch Center, which is the policy arm of the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation, the symposium focuses on striking a balance in music licensing and creating an environment in which both businesses and creators can thrive.\n\nBMI quickly responds to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic by seamlessly transitioning all team members to working remotely and continues to successfully serve its affiliates and licensees. BMI accelerates royalty payments to its affiliates to give them some peace of mind during a tumultuous time, while our Licensing team works with our General Licensing customers as they face the shut-down of their industry. The company also joins forces with other songwriter organizations urging lawmakers to include financial assistance for music creators during the crisis. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is signed into law by President Trump and addresses the devastating economic impact of the pandemic with several important provisions aimed at helping many people, including music creators. As part of BMI’s outreach to our affiliates, the company also creates a Resource Center to help songwriters and others in the industry navigate the challenges brought on by COVID-19. The online hub provides updated information on BMI royalty payments, important legislation, references for federal and state agencies offering aid to those most affected, as well as tips for staying creative.\n\nBMI and the Radio Music Licensing Committee (RMLC) settle rate court litigation dispute and enter into a new multi-year deal covering the 2017-2021 period. The new license means a rate that reflects the strength of BMI music and the number of radio plays it receives, which is higher than any other performing rights organization.\n\nBMI breaks records for the sixth straight year and distributes $1.233 billion in royalties to its songwriters, composers and publishers, $37 million more than 2019.\n\nIn a joint effort, BMI and ASCAP announce the launch of Songview, a comprehensive data platform that provides music users with an authoritative view of copyright ownership and administration shares in the vast majority of music licensed in the United States.\n\nFollowing the murder of George Floyd, a powerful movement for social and racial justice sweeps the nation. BMI stands with the Black community and takes action to drive change. Gospel great Bebe Winans joins the Company as a consultant, lending his guidance and perspective to help BMI navigate the changing times and continue its efforts to be a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace. Among the steps taken, the Company also establishes a program with paid time-off for BMI team members to volunteer at organizations within their communities that support voting rights, underserved populations and social justice reform. In addition, BMI donates $275,000 to multiple organizations dedicated to advancing social equality and racial justice.\n\nAfter initiating a review of the nation’s oldest consent decrees two years prior, the DOJ formally closes its review of the PRO decrees and takes no action to modify or terminate them but leaves open the possibility of changes in the future. Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, Makan Delrahim, makes several important pivotal statements in his remarks: Songwriters are the backbone of the music marketplace and must be paid fairly; blanket licensing is incredibly efficient; ASCAP and BMI are innovating to serve the needs of the industry; greater competition and not compulsory licensing is the answer; and the value of music is best decided in a free market.\n\nSandye Taylor joins BMI as Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer responsible for leading BMI’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategy to support the company’s Core Values, build on BMI’s commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace, and guide an equitable approach to attracting, retaining, and advancing diverse talent.\n\nBMI joins the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other music industry groups to release a statement of support for the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package (American Rescue Plan Act of 2021), which is signed into law by President Biden. The Act offers sweeping support to many individuals economically impacted by the pandemic, including music creators, copyright owners, and other small businesses."
