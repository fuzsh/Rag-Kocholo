        "text": "Industry Vet to Lead Company Strategy Across All Formats\n\nGreg Dorfman has been promoted to Executive Vice President, Promotion for Elektra Music Group (EMG). Dorfman, who has been with the Warner Music (WMG) family for over 25 years, will now oversee the day-to-day operations of EMG’s promotion department, including the Elektra, Fueled By Ramen, and Roadrunner labels. Based in New York, Dorfman reports to EMG Co-President Mike Easterlin.\n\nDorfman, who first joined the Elektra label in 1994, most recently served as EMG’s Senior Vice President of Alternative Promotion. Among his many accomplishments, he led the company to back-to-back No. 1 market shares at Modern Rock radio in 2019 and 2020, and currently has the format’s No. 1 song with All Time Low’s “Monster,” which has topped the chart for 12 weeks. Dorfman has also played an instrumental role in breaking major artists such as Twenty One Pilots, Panic! At The Disco, Paramore, and Young The Giant.\n\n“Dorf is one of the best in the business – a true champion for our artists who is loved and respected by the radio community,” said Mike Easterlin and Gregg Nadel, Co-Presidents, Elektra Music Group. “He’ll be bringing his deep experience and expertise to this newly expanded leadership role, serving as EMG’s boots on the ground across all formats, while continuing to strategize, problem-solve, and motivate our amazing team. We’ve both worked with Dorf for over 15 years, and couldn’t be happier for him.”\n\n“Warner Music has been my home since I started in the business, much of that time with Elektra,” said Greg Dorfman. “But I have to say that the past two years, since the launch of EMG, have been among the most exciting and rewarding of my career. We have the most amazing roster making the most incredible music, supported by a passionate team that always puts our artists first. I want to thank Mike and Gregg for this fantastic new opportunity.”\n\nDorfman began his music career doing Northwest Regional promotion for Warner Records before moving to sister label Elektra, and later relocating to New York to run Elektra’s Alternative Radio department. In the wake of the merger of Elektra Records into Atlantic Records in 2004, Dorfman held posts at the company’s Lava and Fueled By Ramen/Roadrunner labels. In 2018, with the launch of the new Elektra Music Group as a stand-alone company within WMG, Dorfman became part of the new label group’s founding team."
