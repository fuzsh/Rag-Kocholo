They’re best known for their experimental psychedelic electronic, as well as their alternative rock. They’ve since expanded with subsidiary labels, Acute Records and Paw Tracks.\n\nCarpark Records\n\nP.O. Box 42374\n\nWashington, D.C. 20015\n\nU.S.A.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: Contact Page\n\nFat Possum Records\n\nNotable Artists: The Black Keys, Ann Peebles, Courtney Marie Andrews, Hoops\n\nFat Possum Records is a local giant in Oxford, Mississippi, with a long history of signing blues artists since 1992. Most recently, the record label has sought out younger talent for music promotion, signing on well-known names like The Black Keys and Hoops, to name a few.\n\nFat Possum Records\n\nP.O. Box 1923\n\nOxford, MS 38655\n\nPhone: 662-234-2828\n\nWebsite: Contact Page\n\nLion Bold Records\n\nLion Bold Records is a unique alternative to traditional record labels. Lion Bold Records is classified as a \"farm label,\" meaning that they discover some dynamite talent from across the country and focus on artist development rather than signing already established acts. Just as a farmer plants seeds and waters them so they can grow, Lion Bold Records only works with a small lineup of artists who are 100% dedicated to finding success in the music industry.\n\nThe best part is, they invest in you 1:1 just like an artist manager so that you learn the skills you need for a lifetime of music success. If you are an artist looking for a way to develop your career, don’t hesitate to reach out to our friends at Lion Bold Records.\n\nUntil then, keep growing your audience every day here with training at the Indie Music Academy!\n\nWebsite: Contact Page\n\nRough Trade Records\n\nNotable Artists: The Strokes, Arcade Fire, Alabama Shakes, Sufjan Stevens\n\nRough Trade Records hails from London, UK, and was founded in 1978 in the backrooms of a record store. Specializing in punk rock and early-post punk, they’ve carried big names like The Strokes, Warpaint, and Arcade Fire.\n\nRough Trade Records\n\n66 Golborne Rd\n\nLondon\n\nW10 5PS\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: Contact Page\n\nIsland Records\n\nNotable Artists: Demi Lovato, Florence + The Machine, Jessie J, AlunaGeorge, Annie Lennox\n\nJust one look at their roster and you might think that Island Records is the best indie record label out there. But in spite of their famous catalog of artists, their roots are purely indie. Island is an offshoot of Universal Music Group, founded in Jamaica in 1959 and later merging with Def Jam Records. While their roots may have been Jamaican, they’ve since morphed into a powerhouse of multi-genre talent with big and small names alike.\n\nCheck out their FAQ for demo submission instructions.\n\nGlassnote Records\n\nNotable Artists: Childish Gambino, CHVRCHES, Mumford & Sons, Secondhand Serenade\n\nWith a fiery roster of young talent, it’s no wonder that Glassnote Records has been hitting it out of the park with artist selection. Though it’s a relatively young label, having started in 2007, it’s turned new artists like Mumford & Sons and Childish Gambino into household names. All the same, they have stayed primarily as a hub for indie rock and alternative hip-hop.\n\nGlassnote Records\n\nAttn: Demo Submissions\n\n770 Lexington Ave\n\n16th Fl\n\nNew York, NY 10065\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: About Page\n\nXL Recordings\n\nNotable Artists: Adele, Radiohead, M.I.A., Vampire Weekend, Tyler the Creator, Azealia Banks\n\nXL is an independent British label that also has fingers in nearly every genre of music when it comes to their choice of artists. They started in 1989 as a hub for rave and dance music and later chose to broaden their horizons and develop more original artists. They catapulted into fame in the 2000s with successful artists and hot debut albums like The White Stripes, M.I.A., Jack White, and Adele. They’re still going strong to this day.\n\nTheir submissions open and close: Check to see if they are currently accepting.\n\nDomino Recording Company\n\nNotable Artists: Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, Dev Hynes, The Kills, Julia Holter\n\nArt Pop and folk music are Domino Recording Company’s strongest suits, with such names as the ones listed above. Founded in London in 1993, Domino has grown into a high profile label that isn’t afraid to try experimental artists.\n\nSubmit Via Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/dominorecordco\n\nRead their demo submission policy here.\n\nYoung Turks\n\nNotable Artists: Jamie xx, Koreless, Sampha, Jessie Ware, NOLIFE\n\nYoung Turks was founded in 2003 as an offshoot of XL Recordings (sound familiar?), but has since grown into a fully-fledged independent label. They’re also unique in that they dabble in hosting radio shows, aside from music.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://theyoungturks.co.uk/\n\nRead more about Young Turks, or see where to submit your demo.\n\nStones Throw\n\nNotable Artists: Madlib, J Dilla, Mndsgn, Aloe Blacc, Savath & Savalas\n\nHailing from Los Angeles, Stones Throw has morphed into a hip-hop, psych rock amalgamation, but thrives on the experimental.

Even better, all their music is free for your listening pleasure, which is even more unique in this industry.\n\nYou can check out their About Page to learn more about Humble Beast.\n\nEpitaph Records:\n\nNotable Artists: Social Distortion, Alkaline Trio\n\nEpitaph Records has been around since the early 90's and is one of the most popular indie-rock record labels in the world. Their talent roster extends far beyond indie-rock nowadays and they have created a name as one of the most influential labels in Los Angeles today. Check them out below.\n\n2798 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles CA, 90026\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: www.epitaph.com\n\nOnce again, we want to make sure you are fully prepared before you submit your demo to a record label. Now that you have 10 labels you can reach out to, let’s make sure you’re ready.\n\nBelow, I offer some helpful insight, to help you be 100% confident that a record label will see that you have been focusing on the right things in your music career, and you offer them more than just some songs.\n\nHow to Get Ready as an Artist for a Demo Submission\n\nIf a label wanted your demo, would your music career be irresistible or forgettable?\n\nThe answer is obvious!\n\nYou need to make their mouths water at the A&R office when they hear about you!\n\nLabels are looking for so much more than a song ... they are looking for the full package.\n\nA money maker.\n\nAn artist with a career they would bet on.\n\nWhen labels receive a demo, they will also take a look at every other aspect of the artist’s career.\n\nIf they like what they HEAR, they also need to like what they SEE.\n\nFrom the fancy suit and tie major record label execs to the boutique independent record label owners, these music industry players will be taking a look at you as an artist as a potential “investment” for their company.\n\nThey want to spend money on you so that they can make MORE money in return as business profits.\n\n(You become famous in the process, pretty awesome right?)\n\nBeyond the songs they hear, they want to see that you have all aspects of a promising career in place — not just just great music but also a savviness in music marketing.\n\nTo get a bird’s eye view of your music career, a record label will be combing through your:\n\nSocial Media Engagement\n\nSpotify Streams & Monthly Listeners\n\nFan Engagement (Comments and Email Subscribers)\n\nPast and Future Concert Schedule\n\nProduct Creation / Merchandise\n\nWebsite Branding\n\nYour Artist Image\n\nIf a label senses you focus more on IG captions and selfies than building long-term fan loyalty, they are most likely going to pass.\n\nRemember: “Actions speak louder than words”\n\nThat’s what you need to hold to if you want to succeed, but ACTION is only as good as what you FOCUS on.\n\nI know we’ve kept things friendly and informative up until this point, but my goal is to push you to be the best you can be.\n\nIf you’re willing to go a little deeper with me, I have some tough questions that all of us have to ask ourselves as artists.\n\nBrace yourself, are you ready?\n\nWould a record label be impressed with you as an artist, if they judge you based off of everything EXCEPT your music?\n\nWould they like what they SEE and not just what they HEAR?\n\nIf you lack confidence when answering these questions, this doesn’t mean you make bad music. It could just mean that you need to shift your focus.\n\nPerhaps the truth is that we’ve focused too much on creating music, but not tending to the rest of the picture.\n\nSometimes the truth is not as fun to face.\n\nWe prefer to lie to ourselves to avoid the pain of reality.\n\nBut since you’re here I know you CAN handle the truth.\n\nThe hard truth is that if your music career is not appealing to labels, it’s because you've been focused on the wrong things.\n\nBut don’t fret, there is hope!\n\nIf your music career isn’t where it needs to be, what’s the solution?\n\nHere at the Indie Music Academy, we can teach you EXACTLY what to focus on and build a career that will leave no room for doubt.\n\nWe have free training that is designed to focus on areas for growth and development in the same way that an athlete would target her 5 most important muscle groups.\n\nIf your focus is on actions that actually build a successful music career, then in time you will have a winning career record labels won’t immediately pass on.\n\nIt's time to train all the weak spots in your music career with these free resources:\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to Collecting Music Royalties\n\nEssential Industry Contracts, like a Work for Hire Agreement\n\nThe Spotify Playlist Marketing Gameplan\n\nPlus a Bonus Music Marketing Workshop\n\nThese are the areas that labels see when they're considering signing you on as an artist. And all of these are covered inside The Indie Vault.\n\nAre you ready to take your music career to the next level and prepare for that record deal? Click the link below to get started:"
