        "text": "Shaking Things Up\n\nCollege of Education alumni reject the status quo and take steps to change the world through activism and community involvment.\n\nRaising Issues, Unlocking Potential\n\nMaking a difference, One Person at a Time\n\nDedicated to the Community\n\nEnough Love to Go Around\n\nBuilding Character\n\nBuilding Bridges, Energizing Counselors\n\nModeling Good Service\n\nGiving Back, Moving Forward\n\nRaising Expectations\n\nEncouraging Women to Choose Politics\n\nShining Light on Mental Illness\n\nRaising Issues, Unlocking Potential\n\nAlisa Meggitt (BA ‘02) teaches her students to change the world.\n\nFor the past four years she has introduced her sixth graders to issues such as child labor, world hunger, ageism, and factory farming. Through talking about issues in class, learning from guest speakers, and participating in long-term projects outside of school, the students learn about problems in their world and how they can help.\n\nFour years ago, Meggitt’s students raised $3,500, which she took to her former Peace Corps village in Senegal, Africa, to coordinate draught rescue and relief efforts. They also contributed 210 pounds of school and medical supplies for the village of 400 people.\n\n“They literally rescued this village,” Meggitt said. “The students bought them seeds, medicine, everything they needed to get back on their feet.”\n\nThey also sent school supplies to children in Thailand after the devastating tsunami in 2004.\n\nThe students have hosted four public access television shows about causes that matter to them. They’ve made frequent visits to the local homeless shelter and retirement homes. They even persuaded the Iowa City City Council to pass a proclamation on child labor.\n\nThe sixth-grade teacher at Lucas Elementary School in Iowa City likes to walk the walk outside her classroom, too. She was a Peace Corps volunteer, participated in United Nations conferences on the environment and development in Rio de Janeiro, worked for the White House Federal Environmental Executive, has traveled to Vietnam and Honduras to volunteer with kids, and has been active in Sierra Club, which honored her with the Environmental Educator Award.\n\n“I live in the world’s most powerful country and my government and my own personal actions have a profound impact upon people all over the world,” Meggitt said. “Because of this, I feel a permeating obligation to give a voice to those who don’t have one. As an American citizen, I am blessed with the opportunity to advocate for justice on a wide spectrum of issues.”\n\nA child labor group that formed through an after-school project in Meggitt’s class two years ago continues to be active.\n\nSpencer Lundquist is one of some 30 eighth graders who are still part of the group called Children Helping Innocent Laborers Democratically, or CHILD. He said Meggitt’s enthusiasm for activism helped him become an activist as well.\n\n“We picked up many things from all of Ms. Meggitt’s experiences,” Lundquist said. “She is such a great teacher, it’s almost like you can’t describe her in words. You just have to meet her.”\n\nHe said Meggitt connects with her students by taking them seriously.\n\n“I think kids are tired of being treated like kids,” he said. “Kids are looking for an outlet to express themselves and do something and I think she provides an amazing outlet for that. She has such a positive impact on kids, making them want to look beyond themselves.”\n\nThis year, Meggitt’s students compiled a list of some 87 issues they were concerned with, everything from acid rain to campaign finance reform.\n\nMeggitt stood at the front of the classroom, a poster reading, “10 two-letter words to live by: If it is to be it is up to me” behind her, and announced the eight top issues from that list: factory farming, child labor, teachers’ salaries, animal testing, animal abuse, gas prices, racism, and the rising cost of college tuition.\n\n“I know that these are big issues, that they all mean a lot to you,”\n\nMeggitt said. “Focus on the one where you see yourself making a change.”\n\nThe class voted again and came up with its top choice: factory farming.\n\nOnce the issue was decided, Meggitt organized after school meetings, brought in experts, and divided the students into committees. Some children focused on fundraising, some researched, others tackled education and outreach, and still others focused on political strategies to address the issue.\n\nThe students spoke out against factory farming at monthly legislative forums in Iowa City where all of Johnson County’s state legislators meet with citizens to talk about activities at the capitol and listen to residents’ concerns."
