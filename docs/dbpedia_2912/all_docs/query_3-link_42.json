The students raised $3,149 and families donated more than 15 boxes of supplies to aid the drought-stricken town of Ndiouffene, Senegal. Press-Citizen/Matthew Holst\n\n\"We hope it will inspire more people to fund-raise,\" said Lukas, 10.\n\n\"Because if we were in that position, it would be hard for us,\" Erik said, finishing his twin brother's sentence. \"We're really lucky to have all this stuff.\"\n\nSince late January, Lukas, Erik and other students at Shimek hit the streets and braved the winter weather to sell items and solicit money for Ndiouffene - a rural village in Senegal. The school raised $3,149 through bake sales, auctions and donations.\n\nThe \"Circle of Kindness\" project started when Shimek teacher Alisa Meggitt suggested the school implement a relief effort in Senegal. Meggitt, who lived in Senegal from 1996-97 as a member of the Peace Corps, said the country is in the grips of a drought - possibly the worst in 30 years.\n\n\"I lived through a drought in '97,\" Meggitt said. \"Our animals died, huts collapsed and the kids got really, really sick. This year's drought is a lot worse. In light of what's going on in the world, I thought we should grow our circle of kindness and help out.\"\n\nFunds to provide medicine, education\n\n Shimek Elementary students raised $3,149 through bake sales, auctions and donations to aid Ndiouffene, a rural village in Senegal, Africa. The village is in the grips of a drought - possibly the worst in 30 years.\n\n Education in Ndiouffene is limited to villagers who can afford the annual $7 fee for school supplies.\n\n Shimek teacher Alisa Meggitt estimates that funds and supplies will provide every student in the 400-person village with several years of school supplies and treat hundreds of sick children.\n\nIn addition to the money, several Shimek families donated more than 15 boxes of medical and school supplies, clothing and other items.\n\nFifth-grader Max Caballero was busy packing and taking an inventory of the items collected Thursday. The 10-year-old carefully divided up the items into categories before placing the supplies in boxes.\n\n\"It (the project) is important because there is a drought,\" he said. \"It's fun because I like to organize.\"\n\nMeggitt said she plans to return to Senegal in June to deliver the money and the donated goods. She estimates that the funds and supplies will provide every student in the 400-person village with several years of school supplies and treat hundreds of sick children.\n\nEducation in Ndiouffene is limited to villagers who can afford the annual $7 fee for school supplies, Meggitt said. As for the $3,000, she said such an amount of money is unheard of in the village and likely exceeds the total kept at the local bank.\n\nThere will be an afternoon assembly at the school today to recognize the students' accomplishments. Meggitt said the Shimek students and parents went above and beyond what was expected of them.\n\n\"They exceeded our expectations,\" she said. \"I thought we would only raise $200.\"\n\nShimek Principal Charlie Towers called the project a rousing success, because it not only raised a substantial amount of money for people in need, it also taught the students life lessons.\n\n\"I think it really promoted to our students the kinds of effects we can have in enriching other people's lives,\" he said.\n\nWhen this story was prepared, here was the front page of PCOL magazine:\n\nThis Month's Issue: August 2004\n\nTeresa Heinz Kerry celebrates the Peace Corps Volunteer as one of the best faces America has ever projected in a speech to the Democratic Convention. The National Review disagreed and said that Heinz's celebration of the PCV was \"truly offensive.\" What's your opinion and who can come up with the funniest caption for our Current Events Funny?\n\nExclusive: Director Vasquez speaks out in an op-ed published exclusively on the web by Peace Corps Online saying the Dayton Daily News' portrayal of Peace Corps \"doesn't jibe with facts.\"\n\nIn other news, the NPCA makes the case for improving governance and explains the challenges facing the organization, RPCV Bob Shaconis says Peace Corps has been a \"sacred cow\", RPCV Shaun McNally picks up support for his Aug 10 primary and has a plan to win in Connecticut, and the movie \"Open Water\" based on the negligent deaths of two RPCVs in Australia opens August 6.
