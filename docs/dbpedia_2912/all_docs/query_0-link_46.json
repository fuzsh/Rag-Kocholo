        "text": "Courtesy Meggitt\n\nMeggitt has signed a five year contract with Bell Textron Inc for an estimated value of $73 million, to supply composite de-icing propeller rotor blankets, heated spinners, fairings and pendulums to the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey.\n\nThe V-22 Osprey is a unique military platform designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. Meggitt’s electro-thermal ice protection components are constructed from composite material with embedded thermal technology.\n\nTony Wood, Chief Executive, Meggitt said, “The Osprey is an iconic platform and we are grateful for the trust that Bell has once again placed in Meggitt to provide composite solutions that greatly enhance flight safety, efficiency and performance.”\n\nKnown for its specialised extreme environment engineering for the aerospace, defence and energy markets, Dorset headquartered Meggitt operates in North America, Europe and Asia, employing more than 12,000 people at over 40 manufacturing facilities and regional offices worldwide."
