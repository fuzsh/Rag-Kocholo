We have developed close working relationships and have a shared vision of the many advantages that SAW technology offers to customers in this rapidly changing sector.\"\n\nPierre-Alain Brodard, Acting SVP, Engine Sensing Meggitt, added, “We are excited about the collaboration with Transense. Their unique technology has the potential to become a great addition to our Engine Sensing portfolio. It fits perfectly with our strategy to support our Engine OEM customers with unparalleled sensing and monitoring solutions that are enabling the sustainable aviation of tomorrow.”"
