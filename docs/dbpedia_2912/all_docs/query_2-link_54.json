Our lawyers are well acquainted with aviation wordings and their interpretations in the industry and by U.S. courts. We also understand the business relationships and have been counted on to provide cost-effective counseling and resolution for over three decades. Moreover, our experience against all major policyholder counsel have made us the choice to defend against contentious, high-value coverage disputes when alternative resolutions fail. For example, we have defended insurers' interests concerning coverage litigations over environmental damage at airports across the U.S. and Caribbean, the failed Boeing 702-series satellites and, most recently, exposure claims made under the Alien Tort Statute by over 2,000 Ecuadorians arising out of aerial spray operations to eradicate drug crops in Colombia.\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems\n\nThe Aviation Practice Group at Locke Lord remains at the forefront of advising and protecting the interests of leading aerospace industry participants, and their insurers and reinsurers —including:\n\nAll manner of aircraft and component part manufacturers\n\nAircraft owners and operators\n\nLessors\n\nAirlines\n\nAirports\n\nIn line with its long-standing tradition, Locke Lord has been examining the proposed integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), inclusive of the particular vehicles (UAVs or “drones”) and their operators, into U.S. airspace and has been actively assisting commercial and insurance clients on the developing legal and regulatory issues in this exciting and fast-changing area. As a full-service law firm with a broad base of experience assisting all manner of aerospace companies and market professionals, Locke Lord’s aviation group is uniquely suited to advise clients in the continually emerging UAS market.\n\nThe team of professionals at Locke Lord involved with UAS issues represent a wide range of backgrounds with specific and substantial experience in aviation matters, including:\n\nLitigation\n\nTransactional\n\nRegulatory\n\nCommercial\n\nPrivacy\n\nCyber\n\nInsurance\n\nThe group includes lawyers that are also aerospace engineers, pilots and former UAV program management specialists providing clients a knowledgeable perspective of not only the legal issues but also the technical and practical aspects of operating UAS. As the use of UAS continues to increase and spread in the United States and across the globe, through our network of offices, Locke Lord is well positioned to assist both existing operators and new industry entrants wherever their needs may arise.\n\nThe FAA and civil aviation authorities of other nations are faced with not only addressing the safety and regulatory issues implicated with integrating a new class(es) of air vehicle, but also the increasing industry pressures to do so quickly. Staying abreast of these dynamics to best position clients to thrive in and positively influence this area is a primary focus of Locke Lord's Aviation Practice Group."
