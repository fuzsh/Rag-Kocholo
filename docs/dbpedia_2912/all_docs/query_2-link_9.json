        "text": "Georgia is the ideal place for aerospace companies to find research partnerships and to hire skilled workers. More than 200,000 Georgians work in aerospace-related occupations, from aerospace engineers to machinists to CNC tool operators. New engineering graduates enter the field each year, including those from Georgia Tech — one of the leading producers of aerospace engineers in the country.\n\nMiddle Georgia State University is one of only nine institutions in the U.S. to offer degrees in aviation ranging from master's degrees to one-year certificates. These FAA-certified programs focus on maintenance, flight training and air traffic control collegiate training. Over the past five years, Middle Georgia State University has produced more than 650 graduates with aviation credentials.\n\nThe Technical College System of Georgia offers a variety of aerospace-related degree and certificate programs to both develop a pipeline of qualified workers and enhance the skills of existing workers. Programs include two-year degrees, one-year diplomas and fast-track certificates in many relevant fields. For more information on Georgia’s technical college system, visit www.tcsg.edu.\n\nEnriching this constant stream of new graduates is a number of veterans who are discharged from our military bases each year. All are well-trained and highly disciplined, and companies like Pratt & Whitney and Gulfstream are proud to have a contingency of veterans as part of their workforce.\n\nAdditionally, Georgia offers qualifying companies access to customized workforce training at no cost. Continuously ranked the No. 1 workforce training program in the nation, Georgia Quick Start is the premier partner for developing and delivering the needed talent for the aerospace industry.\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, our universities and colleges spent $2.7 billion in research and development (R&D), an increase of 23% from FY16. Research is the backbone of the Georgia Tech Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, which spent more than $163 million on R&D expenditures in FY2019. Active research programs include multidisciplinary projects in:\n\nAerodynamics and fluid mechanics\n\nAeroelasticity and structural dynamics\n\nPropulsion and compulsion\n\nStructural mechanics and materials\n\nSystem design and optimization\n\nThe Center of Innovation for Aerospace actively supports high-growth potential aerospace companies, using state-backed resources to provide access to academic intellectual capital, advanced university research and industry expertise.\n\nPrivate sector companies in Georgia are also very active in aerospace R&D. Generation Orbit, for example, is developing the X-60A which will serve the hypersonic flight test and suborbital research communities with an affordable air-launched single-stage liquid booster."
