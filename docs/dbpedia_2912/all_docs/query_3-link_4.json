        "text": "Meggitt has confirmed that jobs could actually be LOST under plans to create a new âsuper siteâ on the edge of Coventry.\n\nA leaked company memo seemed to suggest that the move could potentially create hundreds of new roles , but it now appears thatâs not actually the case.\n\nStaff at the aerospace companyâs Meggitt Control Systems department, in Holbrook Lane, Coventry , will be at risk of losing their jobs after the Telegraph discovered the work will be moved to the companyâs sister site in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, in the USA.\n\nIt is understood about 100 employees will be affected by the departmentâs move, although the company insists it will seek to re-deploy those affected into the new Â£130m site being created at Ansty .\n\nA leaked memo, from chief operating officer Tony Wood, revealed by the Telegraph yesterday stated the new site at Ansty would âprovide longer employment security and growth for up to 1,000 colleagues.â\n\nBut it now appears this refers to a plan to âsafeguardâ jobs by moving employees from three existing sites, due to close under the Ansty plan, rather than an intention to create new roles.\n\nThe companyâs sites due to close are Holbrook Lane, Coventry; Wharfdale Road, Birmingham; and Maidenhead.\n\nJobs moving to the USA\n\nA spokesman for Meggitt confirmed some existing Coventry roles would be moved to the States under the plans.\n\nHe said: âFor Meggitt Control Systems Coventry, the decision has been made to transfer all current manufacturing and support activities to our sister site in North Hollywood, this will create a Centre of Excellence for valve production.\n\nâWe expect the transfer of the MCS Coventry valve production processes and associated facilities will be completed in 2019. This means we would be closing the MCS Coventry facility at that time.\n\nâDuring the two year period of transition the company will actively endeavour to re-deploy those at risk into the proposed new super site at Ansty Park.\n\nâThe company are optimistic that we will be able to redeploy the workforce for those who wish to be part of this proposed investment, our intention is to retrain as many colleagues as possible as opportunities arise.â\n\nPotential redundancies\n\nAsked what would happen if employees felt unable to relocate to the new site at Ansty, a spokesman for Meggitt said: âWe are now going into formal consultation with our employees and union reps on the proposed transformation.\n\nâAt this time we are unable to comment on job numbers. Once we have completed our consultation period with the workforce we will have a better understanding of the impact on the workforce numbers.\n\nâOur announcement today will potentially safeguard up to 1,000 jobs in the UK Aerospace industry. Meggitt aim to transfer as many colleagues as possible to the new facility who take the option to move across to the super site at Ansty Park.\n\nâWe fully appreciate that not all our colleagues may wish to transfer for a variety of reasons, the company would look to minimise any job losses and would prefer to avoid any redundancies.\n\nâWherever possible, the company would seek to offer options on voluntary redundancies to those who express an interest at an appropriate stage in the transition, but the company would not expect to be able to release people with a redundancy package in the short term.â\n\nWhy is a new âsuper siteâ being built?\n\nAccording to the leaked company memo: âIt aims to bring together a range of our manufacturing operations, aircraft braking systems, control systems, customer services and support, and corporate shared spaces - putting people at the heart of our operations and enabling teams to work more efficiently within a world-class aerospace engineering and manufacturing environment.\n\nâOur purpose is three-fold: to strategically position the business to enable future growth, to create a catalyst for our journey towards world class operational performance and, ultimately, to accelerate our innovation technology through market leading research and development.\n\nâThe investment will consolidate our position as a UK market leader in the aerospace supply sector.â\n\nWhat will be built there?\n\nPlans for the new site include an engineering and manufacturing Centre of Excellence and a new, purpose built capability for aerospace thermal management technology - already supported by the UK Aerospace Technology Institute with a research and development award of Â£3.7m.\n\nHow long will the move take?\n\nThe transition is expected to take place over the next two years.\n\nInformal discussions with staff and unions have already begun and formal consultation will now take and continue until early 2018.\n\nThe intention is for the Ansty site to be operational by the end of 2019.\n\nLooking for a job?
