        "text": "LOS ANGELES – A Ventura County engineering company is accused of not properly paying its information technology workers for their overtime work.\n\nBrook Trout filed a complaint on behalf of himself and others similarly situated on Oct. 7 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Meggitt-USA Services Inc. alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and California Labor Code.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that between 2014 and 2016, he worked for more than 40 hours per week without being paid any overtime compensation. The plaintiff holds Meggitt-USA Services Inc. responsible because the defendant allegedly failed to pay overtime premiums at a rate of time-and-one-half and failed to provide proper pay stubs.\n\nThe plaintiff requests a trial by jury and seeks damages for unpaid overtime wages of $5 million for the class, liquidated damages in an amount of more than $5 million for the class, restitution and disgorgement, all legal fees and interest and any other relief as the court deems just. He is represented by Michael L. Tracy of Law Offices of Michael Tracy in Irvine."
