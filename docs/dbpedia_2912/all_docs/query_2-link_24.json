        "text": "So here I sit in the San Diego International Airport. All alone at 10 pm on a Saturday night, waiting for my last flight home. A series of storms across the US has thrown off many travel plans (including mine) and as a result, I am sleeping in the airport on this final trip. The more I think about it...I think it is a fitting finale for my exit from the company. I have worked for Meggitt as an HR Manager for 7 years. Fun times indeed. However, back in 2019 I got the opportunity to be sent to Europe for 3 weeks to become a certified facilitator, trained by Senn Delaney to deliver High Performance work Culture training materials to our employees. That opportunity opened doors for me that would change my life forever.\n\nAs a result of becoming a certified facilitator, I was asked to do 2 jobs at one time...for a long time. In the beginning I continued to be the HR Manager for the Danville, KY site and traveled around the country training employees. Ultimately my efforts lead the company to offering me a newly created position of Training Manager for Meggitt USA, my favorite job to date. During these past 4 years I have traveled to Danville, Miami, Akron, Cincinnati, Erlanger, Troy, Simi Valley, Irvine, San Diego, Portland, North Hollywood & Rockmart in the US. Along the way I got the opportunity to meet thousands of people. I got to learn what makes them tick. Why they think the way they do. Why they have their unique perspectives. I learned way more from them and in some ways...we taught each other.\n\nWhen you spend time getting to know the people around you it opens your mind to thoughts never considered. You learn that while everyone is different...in many ways, we have so much in common with one another. We have shared experiences in which we can relate to one other with and build our relationships to deeper levels based on those common events and feelings. Some people choose to focus on the differences between our fellow brothers and sisters and only think about the negatives. Others identify those differences and choose to focus on the positives. While everyone has the ability to identify those differences...not everyone has the will or the desire to use that information, learn from it, build upon it and grow. I wonder why that is?\n\nWithout getting too deep in this article, my experience over the past 4 years facilitating HPC concepts has me thinking about the people I met along the way. The many long lasting relationships I have developed. The lessons they taught me and the fun times spent with them. I find myself sad that I am leaving all of that behind. I know that most of these folks I will never get to physically see them again. Never get to shake their hand, share a laugh and a smile. But I am old enough to know that people enter your life for a season and for a reason. Then seasons change. And now, it is time for my seasonal change. I don't know if the season I exit now is winter, spring, summer or fall...but I know it was joyful and brought me happiness.\n\nAnd now I think about the season yet to come...which will it be? What will it bring? Who will I meet? What else will I learn? How different will it be? The not knowing is all part of the fun I guess. Kinda like a kid at Christmas, opening up a new gift that you have no clue what it is. Could be a game, clothing, a gift card with cash or a lump of coal...you just don't know until you open it.\n\nBut before I leave Meggitt and dive head first into the new season, I just want to say \"Thank you\" to everyone I had the pleasure to meet and work with. I appreciate your friendships and the lessons you taught me. And now, to share that learning with others...for their benefit. Whoever they may be and I await whatever they will teach me."
