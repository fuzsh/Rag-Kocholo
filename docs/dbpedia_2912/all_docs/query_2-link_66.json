Whether it’s the technology we develop, the way we manufacture our products or how we run the business, our thinking keeps us ahead. Over the next five years, we’re industrialising more than 1,800 new parts on 15 platforms. And because we’re more agile than the giants of the aerospace world, there’s a lot more room to make your mark. Get onboard at Meggitt and you will help design the future. Pioneers in technology In each of our key capabilities, we are number one or two in the world. Our Applied Research Technology strategy looks 20 years into the future, guiding our investment to make sure we stay ahead. The results speak for themselves: RD projects in areas like mission-critical ice protection are winning funding from global leaders in government, universities and business. What does that mean for you? Tough challenges, state-of-the-art technologies and seasoned mentors. Quieter, lighter, fewer parts 3D printing in action High pressure air travelling through traditional bleed air valves is one of the biggest causes of noise at landing and take-off. Graduate engineers Scott Lathrope, Matt Scovell and David Skolnik are developing a radical new design for GE. It’s based on a fir-cone design which can cut noise and weight. “Our team was tasked with generating and evaluating new concepts enabled by additive layer manufacture (ALM),” says Lathrope. “This design was one of the first. And what we learn about ALM on this project, we’ll apply elsewhere: heat exchangers, brake manifolds, integrated metal matrix composites and sensors housings could all benefit.”\n\n7. 5Meggitt graduate opportunities Pioneers in manufacturing Tomorrow’s factories will be intelligent and highly responsive —smart components will find their own way to becoming products using the Internet of Things to talk to machines and people. Meggitt is leading the way, bringing Industry 4.0 to aerospace with a ground-breaking combination of smart tools and big data. We call it M4 and we believe it will enable us to double revenues in UK civil aerospace and increase employment by 50% by 2025. Pioneers in business The Meggitt Production System (MPS) equips each of us with a set of tools to maximise performance and creativity wherever we work, streamlining our efforts from boardroom to factory floor. So whatever your role, you’ll look for better ways of working each and every day. And if your idea can be scaled up, we want you to test it out, spread the word and keep on improving it. Raising our game in Singapore Meggitt’s new Singapore facility was designed for Lean and had some of the group’s highest operations performance. But since MPS kicked off in 2013, it’s hit a whole new level. Performance rose across the board during 2014—on-time- delivery (OTD) for Rolls-Royce, for example, was 98-100% from July to December. To boost performance even further, ambitious targets were set for 2015. “So far this year, we’ve seen zero accidents and cut defective parts per million by 50% to a record 174. OTD for maintenance repair and overhaul is up 6% at 98%. Supplier performance is at 97%, 2% above target. All that adds up to a strong financial performance too—we are now 5% above our projected EBIT,” says James Mariadass, Director of Operations. “The aim is to continue getting better, month in, month out.” Benchmark of the future A ground-breaking intelligent workbench is the first step in bringing M4 to life. Brainchild of Group Technology Director, Keith Jackson and graduate engineer, Tom Newman, it was designed by Meggitt graduates on placement at the UK’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre. Smart, flexible fixturing, laser projection and data capture will drive a quantum leap in output, quality, repeatability and traceability. • laser and video guides show operators which parts to pick, place and fit in sequence • built-in cameras connect operators to experts for training and problem solving in real time • cameras keep detailed records throughout assembly, enhancing traceability and capturing ideas for improvement • research continues into integrating future technologies such as machine vision and smart glasses 00 REVIEW | SUMMER 201512 I magine a world where an operator assembling a product is more like a highly-skilled surgeon in a state-of-the- art operating theatre. His—although of course it’s just as likely to be her—working environment is adapted to his individual needs and preferences. He’s slightly long- sighted so the light is set a little brighter, just as he likes it. He’s taller than most of his colleagues, so he is working at a greater height to save his back. As he’s an experienced operator, the assembly instructions on his screen scroll down at just the right speed, faster than for a beginner. When the screen is switched off he sees an image that he chose himself. Parts are handed to him at the correct time and in the correct order by a desktop robot that knows exactly which nut or bolt is needed next. This operator is skilled in assembling more than one product. The workbench on which he is assembling it is adapted to multiple components, so whilst that morning he will be assembling an electric actuator (Meggitt’s eBrake®), later in the day he’ll be building a bleed valve. The workbench allows him to work quickly and accurately. All the information from the build is recorded and logged electronically and fed back to the engineering team. This may sound fantastic but it is not as far off as you might imagine. A Meggitt team based at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) in Sheffield has been hard at work for the last year, creating an intelligent workbench, called the Closed Loop Adaptive Assembly Workbench—or CLAAW. It is the first step in a project to improve production output, quality, flexibility and traceability in component assembly. The first step towards bringing M4 to life, the CLAAW workbench, has been designed by a Meggitt graduate team at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre. With its smart features and new technologies, it will bring radical changes to component assembly. We meet the CLAAW research team and find out how their work is pushing the boundaries of technology. Benchmark of the future —the Closed Loop Adaptive Assembly Workbench Team CLAAW: Chief Technology Officer, Keith Jackson with graduate engineer Tom Newman, AMRC technician, Jon Hall and graduate engineer Rémy Trang FACTORIES OF THE FUTURE | BENCHMARK OF THE FUTURE\n\n8. 6 Meggitt graduate opportunities Develop your strengths at the cutting edge From aircraft brakes that stop 60-tonne aircraft coming into land at 200 mph to the peppercorn-sized sensors that detect aircraft flutter, Meggitt engineering solves some of the world’s toughest problems, bringing convenience, safety and security to millions of lives. With a good degree from a top university, you’ll already have a solid idea of your strengths. But with a whole career ahead of you, you need to explore before you sharpen your focus. In everything we do, we aim to be number one or two in the world—that means more than 25 extreme environment capabilities to pit your wits against, world experts to mentor you and tough international assignments to test your mettle. Electric combination breaks the ice Ice build-up on aircraft can lead to loss of control and loss of life. Building on 50 years’ experience in ice protection, recent research into ultra-low power de-icing systems helped us beat the industry favourites to lead a €6 million European Union research project. Our existing solution cuts 50% of the energy consumed by a traditional bleed air system. We’ve now got a 90% reduction in our sights. Braking news We are the only experienced total braking system supplier worldwide. With 60+ tonnes coming into land at 200 mph, brake temperatures can soar up to 2000ºC—hotter than a space shuttle on re-entry—and if a wheel locks for more than a second, the tyre will blow. Yet, thousands of aircraft all around the world land safely on Meggitt wheels and brakes every day. More air pushing the blade, less going around it Sounds like a simple brief but it’s taken 30 years and the most advanced sensors in the world to deliver it. Using a unique application of microwave sensing, we can now tell clearance control systems how far to shrink the gap between turbine tip and fan casing to within 0.25mm of blade contact. The result? 1% increase in fuel efficiency, 10% reduction in noxious emissions. This is Pluto calling Back in 2005, we shipped an order of cabling from California. 10 years and three billion miles later, the first images of Pluto captured by the New Horizons space probe were beaming back to Earth through its wires. Lightweight and proven in the harshest temperatures, Meggitt’s silicon-dioxide insulated communication cabling can be found on almost every extreme environment platform.\n\n9. 7Meggitt graduate opportunities Mission-critical measurement Our sensors have been prized by flight test engineers on every major military aircraft since 1947. The Joint Strike Fighter is no exception. Tiny variable capacitance accelerometers pepper its hot surfaces. They are able to compensate for temperature-related errors occurring between, say, vibration measurement at room temperature and 105˚C at the speed of sound. The global error is below 2.5%—a remarkable achievement for a commercial production unit. Taking the heat Next generation aircraft engines run more efficiently so there is less fuel available to cool engine oil but they also run at higher temperatures. At the same time, smaller engine cores and bigger fans leave less space for mounting heat exchangers. Meggitt graduates are helping to develop a compact aluminium aerospace heat exchanger using a pioneering etched plate additive layer manufacturing technique. “If we can solve the diffusion bonding and chemical etching challenges,” says graduate Farhana Zaman, “We hope to use the same technology to create novel captive voids or access ways in aluminium structures without compromising the strength of the material.” Saving sight, treating cancer Piezoceramic components developed by Meggitt in Denmark are at the heart of a new medical technology for treating glaucoma and hard-to-reach cancer tumours. High intensity focused ultrasound, as it’s known, creates a very high energy density which can target and heat tissue with great accuracy. A two-minute procedure could reduce the pressure on the optic nerve within the eyeball that causes blindness in glaucoma —a disease that affects 60 million people worldwide. Smart engineering in action: (top to bottom) Meggitt accelerometers remain accurate at the speed of sound; piezoceramic components are helping millions of glaucoma patients see clearly; thousands of aircraft every day land safely on Meggitt brakes; turbine tip clearance sensing can increase jet engine fuel efficiency by 1%.\n\n10. 8 Meggitt graduate opportunities The Graduate Programmes Cutting-edge technologies, expert mentoring, international placements, on-the-job and formal training—our three-year graduate programmes give you all the challenges and support you’ll need to become a world-class leader in your field.\n\n11. 9Meggitt graduate opportunities The Engineering Programme Design your own future Meggitt is global number one or two in more than 25 aerospace and energy capabilities.

That’s my perfect week. At Meggitt, I get it month in, month out.\n\n19. 17Meggitt graduate opportunities Out of the lab, into the factory E xtreme environment engineering requires a complex combination of cutting-edge research and smart industrialisation. “It’s fast and it’s demanding,” says Maxime Dempah, “But if you really want to push yourself as an engineer, there’s no better training ground.” I loved my time at university. I was in a new country, at one of the best places in the world to study composites. I grew massively as a result, both as an engineer and as a person. I wanted to find that same experience in my first job. I could have found something safe in my field but I feel more alive when I’ve got something new to tackle. Two years into the programme at Meggitt, I’ve definitely taken the big leaps I’d hoped for. Take my first placement, for example. Tomorrow’s aircraft, like Lockheed’s SR-72 concept, could eventually fly at Mach 6 (4,500 mph). And that of course means higher operating temperatures and pressures than ever. New composites will be required for many components, everything from engine and door seals to structural components. Competition is hotting up. Out of the lab, into the factory Some of our composites can withstand 1100°C for 15 minutes but continuous use, hour after hour, is another matter. My job was to find and develop a relationship with a suitable academic partner and create a novel composite material with next-generation thermal resistance and structural properties. After looking at a number of institutes, I found an excellent team working in precisely this area at Georgia Tech. Initial discussions went well and under their guidance and feedback I started developing molecular modelling programmes capable of predicting the electrical and mechanical properties of nano-composites. The idea was to develop a virtual lab to accelerate development. A lot of the research focused on organic chemistry and although I’d studied this in graduate school, I had to relearn some theory and then apply it in practice—quite a different matter! There are very few companies who lead in their field where you get this kind of opportunity as a graduate. I spent the first six months benchmarking before moving on to testing samples. Ordinarily, you switch to a new placement after nine months but I felt there was much more I could do at MPC and asked to stay for my next one. That’s typical here—you have immediate access to senior management so there’s always room to adapt if the reasons stack up. I’m happy to say that after 18 months we successfully evaluated a new composite for continuous 700°C heat and plans are underway to develop a product for market. Stretched and stretched again To give myself more of a challenge and explore new areas, I asked for a second project. I was tasked with developing an anti-static polymer to reduce the risk of fire in aircraft fuel cells or airframes struck by lightning. Customers have different needs and we researched a variety of nanoparticles to deliver a range of conductivity from 105 to 109 ohms/cm. Every two weeks, I also reviewed any new research relating to the technology used in our products at Meggitt Polymers Composites. I’d circulate anything of interest—it was very stimulating and also the perfect antidote to the more stressful project work. Once people know your skillset, you get other requests too—another graduate asked for advice on his project, automating non-destructive evaluation (NDE) for a major Boeing project. There are always opportunities to explore new things here or apply what you’ve learned in new ways. Manufacturing the future Six months ago, I moved to the UK for my third placement. The role is similar—research, test and deliver—but the technology totally different. Heatric are world leaders in diffusion bonded heat exchangers for the energy sector. They’re part of a group-wide effort to develop an advanced heat exchanger for aerospace using a pioneering etched plate additive layer manufacturing (ALM) technique. A succession of graduates have worked on the project and we’re making good progress. I’m now evaluating a third-party ultrasonic diffusion bonding technique that will allow manufacture from aluminium, the ideal choice for its strength-to-weight ratio. Again, it’s a technology that is still in the lab but if we can industrialise it successfully, it could be a game changer. For me, it’s this kind of opportunity that makes the programme stand out. Meggitt have an extraordinary range of cutting-edge capabilities. There’s always potential to take the latest research and take the technology to the next level. As a graduate, you’re tasked with making that happen. It’s the perfect way to explore what’s on offer across the business and decide where you want to take your career.

The Graduate Programme gives talented young engineers the chance to develop a broad range of technologies at a higher level than the bigger players in the industry. Meggitt gets a high return on investment. The grads get the experience of a lifetime.” There’s an amazing variety of RD projects happening under the Meggitt umbrella. My first placement was at our specialists in power products and wireless technology in Arizona. They’re a world leader in lithium ion (Li-Ion) battery systems for aircraft engine start and back- up power. I was researching state-of-charge and state-of-health monitoring. A lot of work had been done from the electrical perspective but not much looking at the electrochemical properties of the battery cells. That’s where I came in. Want to lead? Join a leader Reporting directly to the Chief Technical Officer, a world expert in this area, I worked with a small team to determine our initial direction. After reading the latest research on the subject, we began designing a new state-of-charge algorithm and wrote a series of procedures to test the battery’s properties. The Li-Ion project was the best introduction to commercial RD I could have had—technically demanding and plenty of responsibility, but short enough to see the process more or less from start to finish. The team added the final touches just after I left and the product is now on the market. It was a very fulfilling start in an area I never thought I’d be in. The programme has continued to surprise with new paths and high- level exposure. I went to Los Angeles to present on the Li-Ion project to the presidents of a number of Meggitt businesses, for example. There’s often good exposure in the industry too: one of my mentors chairs SAE International’s Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) Committee. I travelled with him to a conference in France and presented our paper on aerospace Li-Ion RD work at the end of my first year. Learn and deliver My second placement was at a Meggitt company in Oregon specialising in power conversion and generation. I was tasked with designing a multi-million dollar project, definitely a first! But by working with senior management, I completed the proposal and the president of the business signed it off. For my next stint, I moved to our Danish facility specialising in piezoceramic materials. Talk about diverse experience. My final placement brought me to Meggitt’s specialists in potentiometers and position sensors in Spain. It’s 50% automotive and a high-volume operation, very different from my earlier placements. I’m running several exciting RD projects, exploring how new combinations of materials can extend product life and open the door to new markets. But that’s only my official role here. As a graduate, you build up experience and contacts as you move around the company. By the end of the programme, you’re in a unique position. You can see synergies between the different businesses and you’re expected to suggest new approaches. In addition, I’m working on some supplier and manufacturing issues, helping to implement part of the Meggitt Production System at this facility, and researching new technology partners in Switzerland, Germany, Israel, Italy and more. Make it happen With a PhD in materials, there were various industries and companies that captured my interest but choosing Meggitt was one of the best decisions I ever made. It feels like I’ve squeezed several lifetimes into my three years here. Moving from Arizona to Oregon, then to Denmark and Spain has been challenging but immensely rewarding. Each place has brought new projects, a new lifestyle and a new network. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. But you’ve got to be proactive. You’ve got to be agile. You’ve got to be creative.

As the demand for lighter, smaller and simpler sensors grows, the opportunities for micro-engineers are exploding. Blaise Guélat got the chance to put his learning into practice and design his first product as soon as he arrived at Meggitt. Meggitt has been a world leader in sensing for decades. So to walk in the door and get the opportunity to design a microelectromechanical (MEMS) tilt sensor felt like a big challenge. They’re mainly used in train control and positioning systems to maximise capacity and uptime for operators and they’re also used in the test industry. The existing mechanical sensing element was about 5x4 cms with a complicated structure housing the sensor in oil to prevent shock. With MEMS technology, you can get it down to a few millimetres square. My first task was to review the sensors on the market and test their accuracy. Our expertise isn’t in sensor design and manufacture but in creating a highly accurate product for a specific extreme environment application. The main challenge was compensating for the inevitable inaccuracies you get even in the best sensors, due to temperature and vibration. Smaller, cheaper—and more accurate I led the project, bringing together people from across the company: the full spectrum of engineers—electronic, mechanical, system, PCB design and process—as well as supply chain, sales and marketing. For me, the signal processing was a big challenge —I had very little experience in that field. However, we were able to successfully apply Meggitt’s pioneering digital compensation technology and the product, due for launch in 2016, has short scale accuracy of ±0.0007g (±0.7mg). Overall, it was a brilliant introduction to commercialising cutting-edge technology—it had applied research, project management and product development. And the fact that I’d come in right at the start of the project meant I could take the process right through to a first prototype. Software challenge My second placement took me from France to Meggitt Avionics in the UK; they’re a global leader in air data systems and flight deck instruments. I was tasked with developing a new algorithm to improve attitude and heading accuracy on our secondary flight display unit— they gather data from sources such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers to give pitch, yaw and heading angles in one digital display. I researched a variety of the latest papers on the subject before deciding on a statistical approach known as Kalman filtering. It uses a series of measurements observed over time—including statistical noise and other inaccuracies—to produce estimates of unknown variables that are more precise than anything based on a single measurement. It’s used fairly widely—in navigation systems for aircraft and the International Space Station, for example, as well as drones and smartphones—so it’s not hard to find the logic and equation. Adapting it for a specific use, on the other hand, is complex. I’d had some experience with coding but there was a lot to learn. I delivered a working algorithm by the end of the placement, however. And based on that, the team has gone on to use a Kalman filter approach which is now being fine-tuned and integrated into the hardware. Innovation lab One of the best things about the programme are the weeks of training you get between placements. In addition to workshops in areas like communication and leadership, graduates get together with the Group Director of Engineering, the Group Chief Technology Officer and a number of other experts for lectures and site visits to explore a specific technology. But this isn’t just to get us up to speed. Graduates play a really important part in Meggitt’s Applied Research and Technology strategy: we’re here to help test out new technologies and develop synergies across the group’s different capabilities. You’re given a design challenge to solve in teams. In one of my weeks, for example, we focused on 3D printing and started work on a new design for an aircraft engine bleed valve to reduce noise. It’s now being developed for GE and the project has evolved into a test bed for 3D technology across the business (see p.4 for the full story). These weeks really are a big leap forward. You’re with a group of very talented engineers from all over the world, so you learn a lot technically. But they’re more than just colleagues—I’ve made some great friends. I had high hopes of the programme professionally, but I had no idea how much my world would expand. Left: The International Space Station uses Meggitt high resolution proximity sensors to boost precision in scientific experimaents: our sensors are also used to detect tiny movements in the Louvre pyramid. Graduates play a key strategic role: we’re here to help test out new technologies and develop synergies across the group’s different capabilities.\n\n24. 22 Meggitt graduate opportunities Braking new ground From top secret prototypes to global product development, Marc Greenshield’s high-speed career never stands still.

But I doubt many people know what’s really involved. Did you know that aircraft brakes can hit 2000°C, for example? That’s hotter than a space shuttle on re-entry. I get the opportunity to work on these issues every day. Our biggest challenge is to combine high performance and reliability with the lowest possible weight so the aircraft uses less fuel. Top secret assignment In 2004, Cassidian—the makers of the Tornado and the Typhoon— came to us with a new, top-secret brief. They were making a prototype of an unmanned aircraft designed to test reconnaissance, targeting and battle damage assessment technology. We were only given what we needed to know. No more. We didn’t even know what it was going to look like. Our first challenge was to define exactly what Cassidian wanted. Barracuda, as it came to be known, was a test bed for new technologies. One focus was to replace hydraulic technology wherever possible with electric alternatives. New technologies, new opportunities It was the first unmanned aircraft and the first electric brake we worked on, so inevitably a number of unexpected problems arose. Yet we were still up against a very demanding schedule. I’ll never forget the moment when we saw the aircraft for the first time. It was assembled in a remote location in Germany and it’s a formidable looking machine to say the least. I visited the site a lot when we were working on integration and the German engineers were extremely professional—as demanding and exacting as you might expect. We were confident our product would deliver, however, as we’d been investing in electric braking research for nearly ten years. We built on our expertise in performance, weight and reliability as well as working to simplify overall systems architecture on the aircraft. There were many tests in Germany and Spain as the maiden test flight approached. We didn’t know exactly when it would be—that was secret too—but when we finally heard the news, we were delighted. Barracuda had successfully completed a 30-minute flight and, as we discovered later, our equipment had performed perfectly. Global strategy development As I have moved up the company, I’ve gone from working on specific projects like Barracuda to play a more strategic role. I now focus on global product development within Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS). We’ve spread our design and manufacturing globally to reduce costs and extend our working day. We now have a large number of MABS design engineers in our facility in Bangalore, for example. That frees up our most innovative engineers in Europe and the US to develop the technologies and products of tomorrow. And our increased network also helps us find the best experts wherever they are around the world. The future of braking We’ve got huge opportunities for new graduates, particularly as we expand into nose wheel steering, landing gear control and tyre pressure monitoring systems. There are big challenges for engineers as the complexity of our systems and their integration increases. I’ve spent my whole career here and even as we’ve grown to be a world leader in more and more areas, the attitude has always been the same: if you’ve got good ideas and you want to get ahead, you step forward. The support and the opportunity are always there. If you’ve got what it takes, Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems is one of the best places around to bring a career in aerospace up to top speed.

So perhaps it’s not surprising I went into software development. I never thought it would take me quite so far though—from India to California, France and Spain. It’s been a fabulous journey. After I left college, I worked for a big public sector engineering business, Hindustan Aeronautics. I was surrounded by fine minds and the technology was incredible but working in the public sector was slow and frustrating. I joined a start-up software development firm and we did a lot of work for Meggitt Safety Systems (MSSI), writing software for their smoke and fire detection systems. From components to systems At that time, although the products had a good reputation and lots of great customers, Meggitt was only producing fire and smoke detection components. In 2004, we won a contract to supply the Airbus A380. It’s one of the world’s biggest passenger aircraft and its fire protection system was the biggest systems development project MSSI had won up to that point. However, there was no internal process for systems development at the time. They offered me the opportunity to come over to California and set up the processes and tools required to integrate our system on the aircraft. I leapt at the chance! In the cockpit I visited Toulouse several times in my first year to work on integrating our system and sat in one of the first A380 cockpits. I was amazed to get this kind of exposure to a world-beating customer. Not only that, we seemed to get on really well. I used to joke with them, ‘You guys like me more than my boss does!’ With that kind of experience and good relationships in place, I was able to play a big role in winning more business from Airbus. We were asked to supply the same system for their A400M, a military transport plane manufactured in Spain. It was another huge learning curve for me. I helped train the local team and really enjoyed the challenge of getting to grips with a new culture. Even though the project was slowed right down because of other problems at Airbus, it was a great experience. Better tools, faster development After concentrating on a Boeing project for two years, in 2008 we were asked by Airbus to supply the A350 but this time the stakes were much higher. First of all, the A350 uses an Integrated Modular Avionics system. That means they needed our software to run not on our own box but on their hardware which hosts multiple systems. So the integration is much more complex. Secondly, we proposed using a new software development tool which would model the software and save time and money by automating much of the coding. It was an off-the-shelf tool but we needed to spend a lot of time getting used to it and learning the new tools and the processes involved. Best-in-class suppliers I went to Toulouse three times to convince them we could do it. Eventually they agreed. Within six months, our system passed three of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) software audits. Given just how important it is to minimise the risk of fire in the air, they’re some of the most stringent in the world. So we were really proud. It had been extremely hard work but it was a huge milestone. Three months later, we were ready to deliver the first lab system. From the A380 to the A350, we managed to cut the software manpower and the initial development time by 50%. Airbus were so impressed that they invited us to a number of user groups to share our approach with their other suppliers. Even EASA said we were one of only very few suppliers at this level. Bigger roles, bigger goals Each time I’ve been ready for more, I’ve found the right opportunity at Meggitt. As I gained more experience as a manager, I hired a number of graduates directly out of college and helped to train them up. On top of that, we acquired a company in 2011 which specialises in fire extinguishing technology. I’m playing a role in integrating our engineering team with them. Overall, my work on process deployment and efficiency improvement has been widely recognised and in January I was promoted. I’m now in charge of applying the same kind of processes and tools from software development across the whole of Meggitt Safety Systems engineering—systems, mechanical and hardware too. It’s a huge challenge but it’s the right time. “If we want to be a world-class supplier, we need world-class talent,” says Director of Software Ravi Shivappa. Have you got what it takes?\n\n28. 26 Meggitt graduate opportunities Dominique Vez Applied Research Technology Manager, Meggitt Sensing Systems, Switzerland and Denmark Profile Joined: 2005 Manages: 5 Interests: Mountaineering, skiing, cycling, tennis, retired skydiver (220 jumps) 2005 Senior Engineer in Sensing Technologies, Sensor Engineering Department 2007 Head of Technology Innovation, Sensor Engineering Department 2009 Head of Product Management, Energy Department 2010 Manager Applied Research Technology, Switzerland and Denmark 2012 Applied Research Technology Manager, Meggitt Sensing Systems, Switzerland and Denmark Education Physics MSc, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne PhD (Semiconductor Laser Physics), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich Executive MBA, Management of Technology, Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Lausanne, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne Swiss laser physics specialist Dominique Vez switched to engineering after his PhD. Today, he’s in the innovation hot seat.\n\n29. 27Meggitt graduate opportunities I was wary of the engineering giants—you get too specialised, compartmentalised. R ight through my degree, my PhD and the first four years of my career, my focus was on semiconductor laser physics rather than engineering. I was doing some fascinating research on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, really cutting-edge work, and there were plenty of wonderful opportunities. But when I looked ahead, I was worried that my focus was too narrow. Maybe being a researcher pure and simple wasn’t right for me? There was another big factor: ever since growing up next to an airfield, I have been fascinated by planes. My instinct told me to reconsider my future. Global, cutting-edge and just the right size So I took the plunge and started looking for the right company. It had to be a leader in its field and it had to be international. But I was wary of the giants—you get too specialised, compartmentalised. I wanted a company where I could clearly see how my work contributed to the bottom line. Meggitt looked like it had all those things. Today, I’m glad to say it still does—even more so, in fact. Maybe even more so now. Luckily, they were interested in my broad technology background as a physicist. And it was clear that I had the analytical skills and drive to get on. I definitely needed them. World-class customers, world-class training Within a year of joining, I was working on a breakthrough technology development project for Rolls-Royce in the UK. They wanted to develop a tip-timing measuring system to monitor blade vibration in the fan and first compressor stages of aero-engines. Working with an engineering team in Switzerland, we developed a high-bandwidth measuring chain (sensors and conditioning electronics) based on our eddy-current sensing technology. We then took it to Rolls-Royce in Derby for further laboratory validation testing before final engine testing in one of their engine test facilities. They were very pleased with the promising results obtained. Working so closely with such a prestigious customer—and in a different culture—taught me so much. It’s the best kind of training. Grow your own career When I first interviewed with Meggitt, we discussed the possibility of doing an MBA after my first couple of years and I started that in 2008. It was extremely hard work but it fitted directly with where I wanted to take my career, concentrating on the strategic management of applied research and technology development. I suggested my thesis should focus on researching the overarching framework, organisational structure and related processes required to do that more successfully within our business. In addition, I analysed how 50 other engineering companies in the aerospace and energy industry sectors handled this and then made recommendations about how much we should invest in Meggitt Sensing Systems. Shortly after I finished my MBA, I was promoted to Applied Research Technology Manager—exactly where I wanted to be—so all the hard work was worth it. Mission-critical challenges One of the recent technology developments I have initiated is a wireless tyre pressure monitoring system for aircraft landing gear. The benefits of such a system include improved operational safety, lower operation and maintenance costs, and potential tyre life-time extension. It also eliminates wiring harnesses all along the landing gear and therefore reduce system weight. The engineering team is working with a Swiss research organisation and one of our biggest customers will follow our progress very carefully. It’s fascinating. Looking ahead, there are plenty of challenges. As the aerospace industry consolidates, our customers want to deal with fewer suppliers. That means we don’t just need the leading solutions in our proven areas. We need a broader spectrum of technology across the board. So the question of how we innovate, how we acquire or develop new technology and how we protect it is more critical than ever. That means I’m always in touch with fascinating developments all round the world, both within Meggitt and at leading research labs in Europe and North America. I travel quite a lot and work with people from many backgrounds and cultures. I can’t think of any other aerospace company where I would have this breadth of opportunity. Right: Thinking in action: Next-generation products such as wireless tyre pressure monitoring help new aircraft like Bombardier’s C-series achieve better operational safety, lower costs, and longer tyre life-times.\n\n30. 28 Meggitt graduate opportunities Profile O ur customers want fewer, higher performance suppliers. To hit their ever more stringent quality and delivery standards, every one of us needs to continuously improve their game. The Meggitt Production System is the way to do it. Group Operations Director Amir Allahverdi and Meggitt Production Systems Director Louis Chavez talk about what they learned at GE and Honeywell and what happens when you turn a business on its head. Amir: Back when I was studying aeronautics at Wentworth in the ’80s, I ran a sheet metal press for industrial heating equipment. I pressed metal, ran copper tubes through it, water tested it and piled it up, day after day. I was doing 10 hours’ overtime a week, building too much and building it the wrong way. There was a better, faster way but nobody asked me: ‘Hey, what do you think?’ There was no system, no process, no supervision and no leadership. Louis: Sounds like a classic worst case scenario. Even if you’d managed to improve on what you were doing, your product would most likely run into trouble elsewhere because there was no leadership or system in place. When I was an engineer at Honeywell in the ’90s, I had no awareness of how the things I was doing, or not doing, had an impact on the factory floor. We’d design something for a Boeing or a Lockheed and get it operational on a few test planes. But then we’d move straight on. It was only when I became general manager of Honeywell’s military avionics division that I could see the whole picture. Producing the best technology in the world doesn’t matter if you can’t manufacture it to the required quality day after day and get it to the customer on time. Interestingly, though, half of all production issues are not found amongst the machines and materials. Bad or confused sales and order entry flows can cause chaos. You have to make sure that everyone from sales to shipping is aiming at the same thing. Amir: But change is such a complicated thing, isn’t it? I had a few bosses who said ‘go kick ass and fire a few people’. But I quickly realised that if you drive too hard, you get a one-time result followed by burn-out. I was lucky enough to learn how to get it right at the hands of a master. At GE in the ’80s and ’90s, Jack Welch built on what Motorola had developed with Six Sigma to transform an underperforming, very traditional American company into one of the largest in the Fortune 100.

It was about single-mindedly driving whole systems—people, parts and processes. I will never forget the discipline of going into work every day at 5 am and saying: ‘OK, where are the parts and where are the people?’ We solved problems at our daily production meetings in real time. Louis: That sounds like total common sense, of course. Where else would you want to solve things? Yet everyone knows how traditional organisations work: directors at the top, shop floor at the bottom, as if everything exists to support the work of the boardroom. To make sure that problems are visible and solvable at the most efficient level, you’ve got to turn the pyramid upside down. Re-locate the centre of the universe at the point where things are actually being made—the shop floor. Amir: Yes! Something very exciting happens when you devolve decision-making to the right level. More people make suggestions about how to improve things because they know they’ll get listened to. Even better, their ideas will get acted on. People take more pride in what they do. They try and beat their own record. It’s personal. Louis: But to make that happen in a global business with nearly 50 sites and 11,000 people is complicated. You need a set of processes which are robust enough to support change but flexible enough to work in many different environments. Amir: More than anything else, you’ve got to engage people. When Lean first became fashionable, the experts would come in with all the buzzwords—kaizen, pokayoke, kanban, andon and all the rest—and write up the policies. It would work fine for a while. But three years later, you went to the same factory and found things had fallen apart, the supervisor had left, the production line had lost its disciplines and quality had taken a nosedive. ‘Thou shalt do it that way’ is no good. Continuous improvement has to come from within. Louis: And now we’ve got processes in place to support that. Perhaps the single most important thing we have in the Meggitt Production System (MPS) is a series of interlocking meetings at the start of each day which flow accurate performance and operational information up and down and side to side in each of our businesses. Each production cell, maybe five or so people, meets first thing every morning for 10 minutes. ‘Did yesterday go according to plan?’, they ask. If not, it’s ‘Where are the gaps? What’s being done about them, who’s doing it? What help do we need? What’s expected today and what’s due tomorrow?’ Cell leaders then report in to their managers, escalating anything the cell can’t solve for itself. These managers go on to meet the value stream leaders before they, in turn, meet the site leaders. All along the way, any issues are written down on notice boards for all to see. By 9.30 am, the plant leadership knows exactly what happened yesterday, who is working to close the performance gap, when it will be done and what help they need. Amir: I’ve found that these daily layer accountability (DLA) meetings, as we call them, can take a bit of getting used to. Coaching is critical as most people can be suspicious around change. I was at AlliedSignal when the Honeywell integration happened. One of my roles was to improve and standardise production systems at 17 sites across Europe from the company’s Swiss hub. It wasn’t easy to deal with the suspicion in one factory that a rise in efficiency meant job losses or that analysis of existing processes was a lever to modify employee terms. Sometimes the only way to allay fears is to get on with it and show the results. Louis: When we started, I used to ask site leaders how much of their time they spend on the shop floor. They’d say ‘5%, maybe ten’. And when I used to say ‘Tomorrow it will be 50,’ they’d think I was crazy. But the best answers are often tucked away inside the head of the person who lives the problem every day. Frequently they either don’t know it or someone is not listening to them. It’s a Lean leader’s job to help them release the power of what they’ve really got up there. Amir: I remember how people would say ‘How will I find the time to do my real work?’ I’d flip that and say ‘This is your real work. Do it properly and you’ll free up hundreds of hours of ad hoc meetings and waste.’ That used to get a smile! Louis: As organisational capability has matured, we get as much as 90% of challenges solved at the first cell level. Amir: That’s because we’ve fundamentally changed the way people think and, just as importantly, feel about their work. We’ve learned that from the Japanese—finally! Some people think it’s extraordinary that companies like Toyota open their doors to factory tours. But the thing is, even if you take all the tools and processes from a successful business, it’s very hard to replicate culture. It is in the hearts and minds of every employee. Louis: We’re definitely getting there. There are lots of examples of how we’ve created our own mature culture right across the group. Look at what they’ve achieved already at the Meggitt Sensing Systems site in Fribourg, Switzerland: on time delivery is up to 96% and they’re now focused on slashing inventory by 50%. Amir: Once we have a full group-wide production system in place, in ‘carpetland’ as well as in manufacturing, all Meggitt facilities will be equipped to hit the performance standards our customers are demanding. And that’s crucial: we’re now at a point where key customers can be serviced by several group facilities. A shortfall in the performance of one detracts from the reputation of another. Yet we’ve shown time and again that once we’re all on the same page, we improve across cost, delivery, inventory, quality, productivity, and safety—the six fundamentals of performance excellence. Louis: And over the whole group, that really adds up. All from ensuring that every single one of our people has the chance to do things better. Amir: Imagine if all revolutions could deliver that, what would the world look like then? Louis: One step at a time, my friend! One step at a time.\n\n32. 30 Meggitt graduate opportunities Arjun Chandar Operations Graduate, Meggitt Control Systems, California, USA Joined: 2014 2014-2015 Meggitt Sensing Systems, Irvine, California, USA 2015 Meggitt Control Systems, North Hollywood, California, USA Education MEng in Manufacturing, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA BSc in Mechanical Engineering and Business, Economics and Management, California Institute of Technology, USA Interests: sports (especially basketball), television drama, politics, finance Profile You need to get people motivated and then make sure they really understand the processes—it’s 70% people, 30% tools.\n\n33. 31Meggitt graduate opportunities A rjun trained as an engineer but realised towards the end of his degree that design wasn’t his strongest suit. “Analysing data, looking at how a business is run overall and working with people to improve complex processes is what I enjoy. Setting up and running factories was an obvious way to put these strengths to work and build on them.” After doing a master’s in manufacturing at MIT, I heard about the Operations Programme at Meggitt. It looked good on paper and a year in, it’s proving a perfect way to put my theoretical knowledge into practice. The Meggitt Production System (MPS) has been put together by a world-class team of operations experts who developed their expertise at places like GE, Honeywell, Rolls-Royce and UTC. It’s up there with the best systems in the world but implementation is still a work in progress. As a graduate, you’re here to learn but also to make things happen. As you tackle a range of tough challenges, working closely with everyone from group leadership and senior management to operators on the shop floor, you get an exceptional opportunity to grow into a global leader. Tough challenges from aerospace giants My first placement was at Meggitt Sensing Systems in Orange County, California. I was involved in nearly 40 line items of activity during my first placement, but spent most of my time on five main projects. One was to help improve a production line for two oil-level sensors used on the Airbus A320. The goal was a 25% cut in overall labour time per unit, with a stretch target of 50%. I ran the kaizen to make that happen. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned here is how you balance the immediate needs of a business with long-term improvements. There are always going to be problems, often urgent ones, but you need to work out how to turn them into opportunities—that’s the only way to sell change to very busy people. I spent two months preparing for the kaizen, building bridges with the key stakeholders across all the different disciplines. In some cases, I had to persuade some of the most senior people to take time out to take part. That can be daunting at first but my intuitive sense of how to win people over has improved rapidly. You’d be pretty stuck without that in this role. Running the training workshops before the kaizen was a great opportunity to get people excited. MPS gives people at every level the tools and processes to solve problems for themselves. I’ve been surprised how critical the social side is though. During the kaizen, we quickly understood the batch size on this line was too big. We cut it down by 75% and worked up very precise standard work documentation. Next came cross-training so that everyone within the cell understood each stage of production. When you’re just out of school, you see things with fresh eyes. That perspective is extremely valuable and it’s one of the reasons graduates are here. So you’re expected to act on it. Take the traditional Lean view that being able to switch between parts in a particular cell is a virtue. In this case, I argued that work in progress in line for every part creates too much inventory and it’s better to time the line for one part at a time. It was unorthodox but here, it was the right approach. Eight weeks after the kaizen, we had reached 20% improvement in labour time per unit, 80% of our overall improvement target. Two months later, at the end of my placement, we hit a 33% improvement overall. Taking on the strategy Discussing the second placement with my mentors, we agreed it was time to balance out the crucial firefighting experience in my first placement with a more strategic role. So when I moved to Meggitt Control Systems’ factory in California—a similar sized operation to my first placement but with higher margin products—my initial task was to work with the programme management team and implement MPS in the new product process. The most important job was to create a daily stand-up meeting for the function. Many production systems have them but the Meggitt version, daily layered accountability (DLA), transforms a stand- up from a communications tool into a mechanism for running the whole business. You can read about DLA in detail in Meggitt’s OPEX magazine [www.meggitt.com/OPEX] so I won’t go into detail here, but the challenge at this business was major turnover in management at the site a few months before I arrived. It was a very busy time for them but I could see how important a broader DLA kaizen would be for senior management. After a few months, the continuous improvement team was convinced of the need for site-wide DLA improvement. It then took about a month to plan the event and persuade senior management to participate. In the meantime, Louis Chavez—Group Director for MPS (see p.28 for profile) and my mentor—visited the site to assess the status of DLA. I got a masterclass in how to combine warm-hearted encouragement with a frank assessment of the problems at hand. We finally ran the kaizen the other day and it really helped to highlight how critical it is for management to take time out and get the business processes properly in place. Easy for me to say, I know— I don’t have all the other pressures of running a factory on my plate. At least, not for a few years anyway. But I’m looking forward to that challenge when it arrives. The Operations Programme here gives you the training, the experience and the contacts you need to take on managing a factory fast. You have to jump in at the deep end and work out where you can be most useful. But if you’re good at that, you can learn quickly and make a big impact at the same time.
