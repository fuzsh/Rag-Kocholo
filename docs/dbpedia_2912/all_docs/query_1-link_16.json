        "text": "To celebrate National Aviation Day, we're going to test your knowledge... Last month, we partnered with Air France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance to roll out a Blockchain-based Track and Trace platform for aircraft parts, ensuring that serialized part data is easily accessible and traceable, both on and off aircraft. With over 100,000 flights per day, that's a lot of parts to track across a lot of planes - but just how many commercial flights do you think there are in the sky at any one time? Let us know your guess below. ⬇️ #NationalAviationDay #Aviation #SkyThread\n\nAmelia Earhart is one of the most celebrated pioneers in aviation history, setting a series of records and world-firsts almost a century ago. At Parker, we proudly honour the past while building a better future. Learn more about our next-generation technologies: https://prker.co/3zPett7 #AmeliaEarhartDay #Aviation\n\n12 days to go until Farnborough International Airshow. We’re thrilled to be returning, and here’s a sneak peek behind the scenes as our chalet comes together. Follow Parker Aerospace for more updates as the countdown continues, and we look forward to meeting you there! #FIA2024 #ApexofAviation\n\nJumpstart your career with an apprenticeship at Parker Aerospace.

Developing the Ebrake® wasn't without its challenges, including EMI compliance, high vibration levels, and rough handling during ground manoeuvres, but our team continually tested and refined. Today, our latest advanced design is used on the Airbus A220 and the electronic actuator is one of the most compact, yet efficient of its kind. Find out more: https://prker.co/3yzVCBD\n\nMeet our Braking Systems Division, comprised of just under 1000 employees at five sites across America, Mexico and the UK. The map below shows the locations of each site and what they produce – from carbon manufacturing to wheels and brakes manufacturing - there’s nothing that the team can’t do to achieve the extraordinary for our customers and partners. Learn more about our Braking Systems Division here: https://prker.co/4bpx8d6 #Aerospace #Aviation #BrakingSystems\n\nWe are the premier global leader of braking systems for commercial, business and military aviation. Our people, together with our breadth of differentiated technologies, ensure that we continue to shape the future of aviation in partnership with our customers. Find out more about our #BrakingSystemsDivision below. #BrakingSystems #Aviation #Aerospace\n\nIn case you missed it, we've joined the HyFIVE Consortium alongside Parker Aerospace, and a host of industry and academic partners. Together, we'll help to develop a world-leading hydrogen fuel system and supply chain supporting zero-emission aviation in the 2030s. The project is supported by the ATI Programme, a partnership between the UK’s Department for Business and Trade, the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) and Innovate UK (UKRI), and we’re excited to play our part.
