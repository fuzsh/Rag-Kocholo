        "text": "Overview of the Meggitt fit-out\n\nClegg was appointed as the principal contractor to fit out listed aerospace and defence sector manufacturer and FTSE 100 company Meggitt’s brand-new facility.\n\nLocated in Antsy Park, Coventry, the works were completed in two phases including the modification of the new manufacturing facility to receive production equipment, which was transported over from the old site. This involved dozens of different manufacturing cells being transferred in a sequence specified by Meggitt’s production plans.\n\nThe innovative facility aims to combine a range of operations – such as aircraft braking systems, control systems, customer services and support and corporate shared services – all within a leading aerospace engineering and technology environment.\n\nComplex building service requirements were managed and installed by Clegg to provide supplies and suitable working conditions for each manufacturing cell.\n\nThe 440,000 sq. ft. facility now houses an R&D hub, which Meggitt believes has created up to 1,000 jobs on the site. The milestone move was Meggitt’s largest global infrastructure project, as the firm looks to position itself for further growth."
