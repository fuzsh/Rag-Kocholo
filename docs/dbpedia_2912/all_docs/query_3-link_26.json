        "text": "By Alisa Meggitt, Iowa City\n\nI am writing to express my enthusiastic support for Mandi Remington as a candidate for the Johnson County Board of Supervisors. Mandi’s dedication to social justice in our community over the years has earned my respect and endorsement in the upcoming June 4 Democratic Primary Election.\n\nMandi Remington embodies authenticity in both her words and actions, drawing from her own life experiences that are often underrepresented in local government. As a single mother raising three children on a modest income, a survivor of domestic violence, a recipient of social services, and a renter, Mandi fearlessly speaks truth to power, shining a light on issues that may otherwise remain obscured.\n\nMandi’s leadership within CCAN, a local social justice network, demonstrates her ability to lead with calm, organization and reason, allowing diverse voices to be heard and considered in the policy-making process at the highest levels of government.\n\nIn times of injustice, Mandi has consistently stood up for marginalized communities. Whether it was advocating for LGBTQ+ rights in the face of legislative assaults or fighting for essential food programs for families in need.\n\nIn a landscape where promises are plentiful but action is scarce, Mandi stands apart. She refuses to be shackled by the constraints of conformity or the allure of acceptance. Instead, she stands firm in her convictions, demonstrating a rare courage to challenge the status quo and disrupt injustice head-on, even when doing so is uncomfortable or unpopular."
