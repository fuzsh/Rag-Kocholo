        "text": "The culture of MRO providers, opening their businesses in Miami-Dade County, began many years ago, when MIA was the home base for major airlines like Eastern and Pan Am. Some of the most talented mechanics and technicians in the industry came here to the tropics to work and never left. Many of them added to Miami-Dade’s aviation industry’s resources by opening their own small local shops.\n\nFrom those beginnings, Miami-Dade’s aeronautical educational ecosystem has developed and evolved to support the industry needs. Maintenance training can begin in high school. The George T. Baker Aviation School has been around since 1958 and is operated by Miami-Dade Public Schools. There is the Eig-Watson School of Aviation at Miami Dade College; Florida Memorial University’s Department of Aviation and Safety and Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University Miami Campus.\n\nMiami-Dade has attracted leading aviation MRO (maintenance, repair, operations) providers from around the world due to the city’s access to international markets, creating one of the largest MRO cluster of companies in the US. They include: AAR, Air France Industries, Satair, Meggitt, and home-grown HEICO.\n\nMiami is the home of the largest number of flight simulator facilities in the Americas.\n\nBoeing’s 134,000 square foot facility in Miami-Dade County is the company’s largest flight simulator training center in their global network. It trains more than 4,500 students a year who come from all over the world with 17 full-flight simulators\n\nAirbus has a 110,000-square foot flight simulation facility in Miami to train A320, A330, A340 and A350 pilots.\n\nFranco/Italian aircraft manufacturer, ATR trains its pilots in Miami as well, The company just recently relocated its Americas headquarters from Virginia, to Miami, where its facility is equipped with a brand new Full Flight Simulator (FFS) for the ATR-600 series aircraft.\n\nAdditionally, Pan Am Flight Academy, now owned by All Nippon Airways, has been in Miami since 1980 and continues to provide training support for airlines and aviation professionals.\n\nMajor cargo airline Atlas also conducts its flight training operations in Miami\n\nWhat does this mean to the local economy? Boeing estimates that its Training Center alone is responsible for 80,000 hotel room nights a year. At an average cost of $273 per day, these pilots in training generate more than $21.8 million to the Miami-Dade economy.\n\nParts distribution is one of Miami-Dade’s strongest industry subsectors. The community’s decades long aviation history combined with its central location, easy global access and strong logistics infrastructure, makes stocking and supplying parts and equipment for the aerospace industry a natural fit. As an example, KLX Aerospace Solutions Group which chose Miami to be its global headquarters, has more than 1 million items in inventory, ships between 6,000 to 8,000 worldwide packages to customers every day. It employs 2,000 people in 65 locations around the world.\n\nOther Aviation Parts Distributors that operate out of the Miami:\n\nAir Parts and Supply Company\n\nTropical Aviation\n\nAviation Distributors\n\nMiami International Airport is the only airport in the Western Hemisphere to be designated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a Pharma Hub and only the second in the world (Brussels is the other). In 2015, MIA organized its logistics providers including airlines, ground handling companies and freight forwarders to undergo the CEIV program. MIA’s pharma trade has increased 62% to nearly $3 billion.\n\nTo maximize the opportunity, MIA launched a historic alliance with the Brussels Airport to create Pharma.aero association to build a global network of airports dedicated to growing the international pharm industries.\n\n“MIA has demonstrated great vision and leadership in encouraging CEIV certification for cargo operators,” said Nick Careen, IATA Senior Vice President, Airports, Passenger, Cargo and Security. “The airport’s commitment to CEIV Pharma is yet further proof of the importance of this certification scheme to raising standards and quality across the cold-chain freight network. By putting CEIV Pharma Certification at the heart of their operations, cargo stakeholders will ensure that Miami becomes a destination of choice for these high-value shipments.”"
