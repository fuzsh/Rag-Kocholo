These industries provide high-paying, career-oriented jobs, with opportunities for advancement, and support continued innovation. Additionally, Marana’s geographic position relatively close to the rapidly-growing electric vehicle manufacturing and semiconductor industries in the Phoenix area and Pinal County set it up to be an attractive location for suppliers and customers of these industries.\n\nTransportation, Logistics, and Distribution\n\nMarana’s position straddling approximately 20 miles of Interstate 10, just northwest of Tucson and only 90 minutes south of Phoenix, makes it strategically optimal for manufacturing, transportation, and logistics operations.

Hydronalix, ATAG, PowerPhotonic, and Global Water Resources are prominent among these establishments, each contributing to the town’s dynamic growth trajectory and being the existing tenants of the industrial facility SAMTEC.\n\nWithin Sahuarita’s economic landscape framework, the mining sector assumes a pivotal role, featuring the operations of two major copper mining entities, Freeport McMoRan, and ASARCO.

Another major economic engine is agriculture. The central to western area of the county is home to hundreds of family, corporate and university based farms supporting various types of agricultural products including Pima cotton, hay, sorghum, millet, corn, sheep, dairy & feeder cattle and several varieties of fruits and vegetables.\n\nManufacturing and Distribution Hub\n\nManufacturing and major distribution firms are centered along Pinal County’s main traffic corridors of Interstate 10 (California to Florida), Interstate 8 (Pinal County to San Diego) and US Route 60. Transportation corridors in the county also include the Union Pacific Sunset Line (Long Beach to El Paso) and Copper Basin railroads. With the proposed development of a 950 acre Union Pacific Railroad rail park locating near Red Rock, and close to I-10 and I-8, Pinal County has a great opportunity to create a major multi-modal warehouse/distribution network along with opportunities for the location of national and global rail-served manufacturing operations."
