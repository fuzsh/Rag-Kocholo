Aerospace company Meggitt is expanding its footprint here with a new factory being built at Prospero Ansty.

The purpose built 440,000 sq ft building represents one of the largest industrial projects in the Midlands in more than a decade. It sees Meggitt centralise its operations at Ansty Park as part of a Â£130m investment.

The Meggitt facility is located on Prospero Ansty, a new phase of the highly successful Ansty Technology Park, next door to Rolls Royce Aerospace.

Meggitt worked with local planning authorities on this site and their existing site elsewhere in the area.
