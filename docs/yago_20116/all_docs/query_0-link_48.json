        "text": "John Wayne was a brilliant actor best remembered for his embodiment of a strong cowboy. The actor’s off-screen life was equally defining of his existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, in Winterset, Iowa. He attended the University of Southern California in 1925. During summers, he worked at the Fox Film Corporation as a propman.\n\nDespite his humble beginnings, Wayne would become one of the most popular actors of the 20th century, with his legacy in American film still remembered today. It was when he met director John Ford while working as an extra that he got his big break.\n\nPublicity portrait of John Wayne.

Nonetheless, he persisted as a cinematic icon in the land of Hollywood.\n\nJohn married his first wife, Josephine Saenz, on June 24, 1933. The couple had four kids together: Michael, Toni, Melinda, and Patrick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHIS PUBLIC AFFAIR\n\nTheir marriage was troublesome, with Wayne's affair to lusty German film star Marlene Dietrich no secret. They starred in the 1940 film \"Seven Sinners,\" and the man had fallen madly in love with his co-star.\n\nTheir affair lasted for three years, and it was reported that he did not care who knew about it. They were seen kissing over dinner at restaurants and nightclubs before Deitrich left him for actor George Raft and France's biggest movie star, Jean Gabin.\n\nJohn Wayne and his wife, Esperanza Baur arrive at the \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" premiere. | Source: Wikimedia Commons By USMC Archives, CC BY 2.0\n\nHIS SECOND MARRIAGE\n\nWayne and Saenz officially parted ways in 1944 after he was unable to make enough time for his family. After the divorce, the actor met his second wife, Esperanza Baur Diza, aka Chata, while he was vacationing in Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple got married on January 17, 1946, in California. Although their chemistry was quite strong, Wayne and Chata had a difficult marriage from the very start.\n\nJohn Wayne filming the movie \"Legend of the Lost\", Tripoli, circa 1956. | Source: Getty Images\n\nTHEIR ROCKY RELATIONSHIP\n\nWayne was always dedicated to work and tried to spend time with his four children with Saenz. He and Chata did not have any children.\n\nAfter years of a tumultuous relationship full of alcohol-fueled arguments, the couple separated in May 1952. By spring of 1953, Chata requested a restraining order to be placed against Wayne for alleged violence, also demanding $9,000 as monthly alimony as opposed to Wayne’s $900 offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDEFENDING HIMSELF\n\nUltimately, Wayne defended himself, and the preliminary decision was in favor of the actor. At the time, this was what he had to say:\n\n\"I never at any time during our marriage struck my wife . . . I will add that many times I had to protect myself from her temper--I call it 'womanhandling.'\"\n\nAfter their separation, he got married to his third wife, Pilar Palette, and the pair had three more children – Ethan, Aissa, and Marisa. During his later years, he focused his work on his advocacy, particularly on finding a cure for cancer.\n\nOn June 11, 1979, Wayne died of stomach cancer in Los Angeles, California. Previously, he successfully battled lung cancer in 1964 by having a lung and several ribs removed."
