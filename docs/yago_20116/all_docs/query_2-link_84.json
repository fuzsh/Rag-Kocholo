        "text": "1950s\n\nOn his yacht off the coast of Marina del Rey in the 1950s, Wayne is joined by his son Patrick (left) and daughter Toni, two of the four children he had with his first wife, Josephine. The boy in the middle is Stern's son, Philip, who grew up to become a pilot and was killed in a crash in the early '60s.\n\n\"This one is a little painful to look at,\" Stern says.\n\n1956\n\nWayne gazes lovingly at his daughter Mary Antonia \"Toni\" Wayne on their way to her 1956 wedding to Donald La Cava in Hollywood. \"He was a good father in the sense of generosity and attention he paid his kids,\" recalls Stern, who was the wedding photographer. \"He also was very aware of publicity and all that, and those pictures appeared in the press.\"\n\n1957\n\nWayne, who would campaign against smoking after he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1964 and had a lung removed, has a cigarette while in costume on the set of Legend of the Lost, in which he starred with Sophia Loren. They shot in the Libyan town of Ghadamis, which, Stern recalls, Wayne insisted on calling \"God damn it!\"\n\n1965\n\nWayne gathers his extended family at his Marina del Rey home. Wayne, who was married three times, had seven children — four from his marriage to first wife Josephine Alicia Saenz, daughter of the consul general of Panama in the U.S., and three with Pilar — and 21 grandchildren. His second wife was Mexican actress Esperanza Baur.\n\n1969\n\nIn 1969 on the set of True Grit, for which he'd win his best actor Oscar. Wayne clowns around in costume, minus Rooster Cogburn's eye patch. Not known for his sense of humor, he normally wouldn't do anything like this. \"It's out of character for him,\" says Stern.\n\n1969\n\nWayne looks in on Ethan and Marisa, two of his three children from his marriage to Pilar, as they arrive to visit him in Colorado during the filming of True Grit. They had just flown in by private jet. Explains Stern, \"He almost always had his family come to location. He had an aircraft like a station wagon to take the family with him.\""
