His acting career got started in 1929 when a broken collarbone from a body-surfing accident abruptly ended his football scholarship as USC.\n\nInitially working for the Fox Film Corporation, he appeared mostly in small bit parts. His first leading role came in Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail (1930), which led to leading roles in numerous B movies throughout the 1930s, many of them in the Western genre.\n\nWayne's career took off in 1939, with John Ford's Stagecoach making him an instant star. He went on to star in 142 pictures.\n\nEarly Life\n\nWayne was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907 at 224 South Second Street in Winterset, Iowa. The local paper, Winterset Madisonian, reported on page 4 of the edition of May 30, 1907 that Wayne weighed 13 pounds at birth. His middle name was soon changed from Robert to Mitchell when his parents decided to name their next son Robert. Wayne's father, Clyde Leonard Morrison (1884–1937), was the son of American Civil War veteran Marion Mitchell Morrison (1845–1915).

A local fireman at the station on his route to school in Glendale started calling him \"Little Duke\" because he never went anywhere without his huge Airedale Terrier, Duke. He preferred \"Duke\" to \"Marion\", and the nickname stuck. Wayne attended Wilson Middle School in Glendale. As a teen, he worked in an ice cream shop for a man who shod horses for Hollywood studios. He was also active as a member of the Order of DeMolay, a youth organization of the Freemasons. He played football for the 1924 league champion Glendale High School team.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nWayne was married three times and divorced twice.

Esperanza and John were married on January 17, 1946, in Long Beach, California.\n\nTheir marriage was rocky and volatile from the start because she was reportedly jealous of his devotion to his work and to his four children; they had no children of their own. \"Our marriage was like shaking two volatile chemicals in a jar,\" Wayne said.\n\n3rd Marriage: Pilar Pallete\n\nPilar Pallete (1928) was a former Peruvian actress and third wife of the American actor John Wayne.\n\nHe had three more children with Pilar: 3\n\nAissa Wayne (1956)\n\nJohn Ethan Wayne (1962) - an American actor, He played Little Jake, the grandson of his father's title character in Big Jake.\n\nMaria Wayne (1966)\n\nChildren\n\nOffspring of John Wayne \"Duke\" and Josephine Alicia Saenz (1908-2003) Name Birth Death Joined with Michael Wayne (1934-2003) Mary Antonia Wayne (1936-2000) Patrick Wayne (1939) Melinda Wayne (1940)\n\nOffspring of John Wayne \"Duke\" and Pilar Pallete (1928) Name Birth Death Joined with Aissa Wayne (1956) John Ethan Wayne (1962) Maria Wayne (1966)\n\nSiblings\n\nOffspring of Clyde Leonard Morrison (1884-1937) and Mary Alberta Brown (1886-1970) Name Birth Death Joined with John Wayne (1907-1979) 26 May 1907 224 South Second Street, Winterset, Madison County, Iowa, United States 11 June 1979 Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, United States Josephine Alicia Saenz (1908-2003)Esperanza Diaz Ceballos (1926-1961)Pilar Pallete (1928) Robert Emmett Morrison (1911-1970)\n\nReferences\n\nwikipedia:en: John Wayne\n\nOfficial website\n\nJohn Wayne Cancer Foundation\n\nJohn Wayne Cancer Institute\n\nFBI file on John Wayne\n\nBirthplace of John Wayne official website\n\nJohn Wayne at Find A Grave #1079"
