        "text": "Many have never understood it but the 6ft 4in famous American actor John Wayne has raised many eyebrows about the authenticity of his height. When he was a rookie in Hollywood and about to play the role of a cowboy, he would have been considered so small that he had to ride a small horse to help him look taller. It was then claimed that the secret of her tall height was discovered as a 4-inch lift fitted into her shoes.\n\nPrior to his demise, the veteran entertainer appeared in over 75 films which were mostly war and western films. He portrayed characters representing a heroic American and was able to achieve iconic status in the American entertainment industry.\n\nJohn Wayne Bio\n\nThe eldest son of Mary and Clyde Morrison (pharmacist) was born on May 26, 1907 in Winterset, Iowa, as Marion Robert Morrison. and Grand Duke. He even dubbed himself Duke Morrison in one of his early movies.\n\nJohn attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles where he was very active in football. While a college student, he worked as an animator at the Fox Film Corporation during the summers and later developed a lasting friendship with film director John Ford. Ford began giving him small roles in 1928 and his big break came in 1930 when he was cast as the lead in The Great Path. It was on the set of this film that his name was changed to John Wayne.\n\nJohn starred in 60 more films over the next eight years, but his place in the American entertainment industry was established with his role as Ringo Kid in Stagecoach (1939). From there, it grew by leaps and bounds with each successive year.\n\nHis family – wife and children\n\nJohn left a record of three marriages during his lifetime, he married Josephine Alicia Saenz on June 24, 1933. Before their divorce, which took place on December 25, 1945, they already had four children – Patrick and Michael (son ); Melinda and Anthonia (daughters).\n\nHis next marriage attempt was to former Mexican actress Esperanza Baur, their nuptials took place on January 17, 1946 and ended in November 1954 without any children. Her divorce from Esperanza was the most tumultuous, she was always jealous of John’s alleged extramarital affairs and tried to shoot him one night when he was coming home late.\n\nJohn Wayne had three more children namely; Marisa, Ethan and Aissa from his third marriage to Pilar Wayne. The couple married on November 1, 1954, and although he separated in 1973, they remained married until his death on June 11, 1979.\n\nIn 1985, his children came together to establish the John Wayne Cancer Foundation in honor of his father’s charitable contributions to the fight against cancer. The organization aims to provide needed assistance to cancer programs and the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John’s Health Center.\n\nWas he gay?\n\nThe question of whether the famous actor wasGay has a simple answer: with three marriages to three wives and seven biological children, there is no reason to believe that he was in love with men. Also, he had several high profile affairs both before and between his marriages. All of his affairs were confirmed to have been with the opposite sex.\n\nthe size\n\nThe actor with the distinct walk like a cat stood at a height of 1.93m (6ft 4in). However, his height has always been a controversial topic, with many attributing his tall build to a 4-inch riser he fitted in his shoes. Either way, his height most certainly dropped to just over 6 feet. His last listed weight was 212 pounds.\n\nJohn Wayne’s Death\n\nIn his last film, the iconic actor was cast in The Shooter (1976) as an aging machine gunner dying from the ravages of cancer. He portrayed the John Bernard Books character who wished to spend his final days in peace, but was embroiled in one final showdown. And lo and behold, fiction became reality in 1978, when the veteran actor was diagnosed with stomach cancer.\n\nIn an effort to fight the disease, John Wayne enrolled in a cancer vaccine study, but sadly, he died on June 11, 1979 in Los Angeles. The Hollywood giant was buried at Pacific View Memorial Park Cemetery in Corona del Mar, Newport Beach. In his honor, the United States Congress awarded his family a Congressional Gold Medal in 1980, and within the month of his death, the government renamed the Orange County airport in his honor. In 1990 and 2004, the movie icon was featured on a postage stamp, and his induction into the California Hall of Fame was completed in 2007."
