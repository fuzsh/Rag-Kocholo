        "text": "[JOHN WAYNE]\n\nThese rare and revealing documents are the correspondence of the lawyers and other people involved in the divorce of actor John Wayne and his second wife Esperanza Baur, including Wayne's attorney Frank Belcher and Baur's attorney Jerome Rosenthal. She has signed 5 documents (as Esperanza Wayne and Mrs. John Wayne); John Wayne's lawyer has signed three in his name.\n\nDocument archive. Collection including 21 documents, 28 pages in all, most 8½x10¾. The content may be summarized thus: 1) Three typed letters dated 1953 October 27, signed\"Esperanza Wayne\", with a handwritten signature guarantee signed by her lawyer, Jerome B. Rosenthal. All three are signed for John Wayne by his lawyer Frank B. Belcher. These letters assign proportional segments of Esperanza Wayne's pending alimony payments from John Wayne, payable to three separate lawyers/law firms. 2) Two typed letters (1953 March 10 and June 22) from Jerome Rosenthal, whose law firm was now handling Esperanza's divorce, to her previous lawyers, defining the terms for sharing the fees from the pending divorce settlement. These are signed by Rosenthal but also by \"Mrs. John Wayne\". 3) Two typed letters to Rosenthal from lawyers in Chicago, apparently personal friends, congratulating him on the publicity and fees from the Wayne divorce proceeding. Individual readers may decide for themselves to what extent these letters are written \"tongue in cheek.\" 4) Two unsigned internal memos (1955 June and July), addressed to Jerome Rosenthal, citing court precedents to refute any challenge from John Wayne's lawyer Belcher regarding the legality of assigning alimony payments to a third party. 5) Several file copies of letters addressed to Esperanza Wayne at a hotel address in Mexico City, sending her small checks and requesting that she sign various release forms. All are dated in September 1956. The irony here is that Esperanza Wayne had been dead for 18 months, having succumbed to a fatal heart attack on March 11, 1955. 6) A file copy of a letter from one Norman Goodman to John Wayne's lawyer Belcher (1956 December 15), forwarding to him a \"30-day letter\" from the Internal Revenue Service to Esperanza Wayne, notifying her that she owed $7,362.83 in back income tax from 1953. A newspaper photo of Mrs. Wayne with lawyer Rosenthal, originally attached to one of the personal letters to him, is also included here. These unique documents are a treasure trove of information about the John/Esperanza Wayne divorce. JOHN WAYNE (1907-1979, born Marion Michael Morrison in Winterset, Iowa) appeared in more films (over 250) than any other star.Best known for his roles in Westerns and war movies, he was the embodiment of the American hero in over 200 films, fighting (on screen) for his country in many of them. Wayne's long list of Westerns includes Stagecoach (1939), which made him a star, Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), Rio Grande (1950), Hondo (1953), Rio Bravo (1959, which Wayne and director Howard Hawks remade as El Dorado in 1967 and Rio Lobo in 1970) and The Shootist (1976, his last film). Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1949 for The Sands of Iwo Jima, Wayne was awarded the 1969 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn in True Grit. John Wayne was married three times (all to Latinas). He met ESPERANZA BAUR, a Mexican actress, while on vacation, and married her on January 17, 1946 (less than four weeks after his divorce from his first wife, Josephine Alicia Saenz). John and Esperanza Wayne never appeared in a film together, and she made no films after their marriage. The marriage was stormy, Esperanza resenting Wayne's devotion to his career and to his four children by his first marriage. The couple separated in May 1952, trading accusations of infidelity, drunken violence and emotional cruelty. They were divorced on November 1, 1954, but Esperanza had previously begun receiving alimony payments, as noted in these documents from 1953. She was reported in Time Magazine (October 10, 1953) to be driving a pickup truck, her Cadillac having been repossessed, and to be preparing a request that her monthly alimony payments be raised from $1,100 to $9,000. Esperanza Wayne returned to Mexico City, where she died of a heart attack on March 11, 1955. Blue and black ink marks and lead pencil notations, all in unknown hand. File holes at top edge and from various letterheads, single-sided, some carbon copies (but signatures are in ink). Lightly toned, soiled and creased. Staple holes near top edge. Staples are rusted. Lightly discolored from newspaper photos. Pages are folded multiple times and unfolded. Light tears along edges. Overall, the documents are in fine condition.\n\nThis website image may contain our company watermark. The actual item does not contain this watermark"
