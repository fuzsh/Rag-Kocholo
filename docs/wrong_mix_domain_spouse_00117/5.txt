You might have seen those memes about how the icons of 2007 making a comeback is proof that nature is healing.

It involves a picture of Lindsay Lohan (starring in a movie and newly engaged), Paris Hilton (recently married) and Britney Spears (free of her conservatorship and engaged) all sitting in a car. Now, there’s another Queen of the 00s to add to the comeback list: Avril Lavigne.

The Sk8r Boi singer blessed 2007 with the appearance of bright pink highlights and seemed to change up their placement or colour every other month.

Here she is making an appearance with pastel pink highlights in April 2007 – with matching pink eyelashes, of course:

Not long after, she had a little peek of hot pink dip dye on one side of her hair:

Then in August, the pink dye moved up to the top of her hair and sat right at the front, framing her face:

Where it stayed in November 2007, too:

But over the years, Avril eventually phased out her pink hair and seemed to settle on keeping it blonde all-over. Here she is in September this year at the MTV Video Music Awards:

But now, something incredible has happened.

Yep, Avril has brought her pink hair back. I repeat, the dip dye is back, guys!!!

Attending the Variety Hitmakers Brunch, where Avril presented Olivia Rodrigo with the Songwriter of the Year Award, the rock singer was sporting her iconic dip dye locks, this time in a gorgeous bright pink hue that transported us right back to 2007.

Avril shared pics from the day on Instagram, which included a snap of the singer with Olivia and Lana Del Rey – the iconic trio we never knew we needed. In the caption, she wrote: "Surrounded by badass bitches today. Congrats to all the Hitmakers ! @variety".

Maybe nature really is healing, guys…
