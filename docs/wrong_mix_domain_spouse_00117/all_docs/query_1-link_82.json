        "text": "Travis Kelce’s previous comments about “breeding” earlier this year have sparked controversy amid his ongoing romance with Taylor Swift. The Kansas City Chiefs star, 34, first made the remarks about starting his own family during a February “Mom & Dad” episode of his and his brother Jason Kelce’s podcast, New Heights. The episode resurfaced after a source claimed to Yahoo Entertainment that Swift and Travis Kelce “have talked about kids” within the next year.\n\nIn the episode of his podcast, the Philadelphia Eagles star asked his mother, Donna, which of her two sons she was “rooting for,” as the Eagles and Chiefs were preparing to play against each other in the Super Bowl at the time. “You’ve said in the past to both of us that you root for me because I’ve given you grandkids,” Jason said. He has three children: daughters Wyatt, four, Elliotte, two, and Bennett, seven months. “I’ve always known that you root for Travis. So who do you actually root for?”\n\nAfter Jason asked his mother again who she was rooting for “in a battle to the death” between the brothers. Mama Kelce came back at Jason by asking if she and her husband, Ed Kelce, were stranded in the middle of the ocean, who he would save on his boat if there was only one choice. Jason said he’d save her “in a heartbeat.” While Donna said she couldn’t pick which of her sons to root against, Jason then joked, “Remember if you choose me, Wyatt and Elliotte grow up without a father.” Travis then chimed in to joke about wanting to hurry up to start his own family. “I gotta start breeding,” he said. “I’ve gotta start breeding, to all the breeders out there.”\n\nRELATED: Swifties Think Taylor Swift’s Earlier Songs Refer To Travis Kelce\n\nJason then responded to his brother’s remark with: “Please don’t.” Donna commented, “Wait until you find the right person. Find the right person.” Despite his family’s pleas, Travis doubled down on his plan and stated: “I’m gonna find a breeder, and I’m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.”\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, Swifties had mixed feelings about Kelce’s comments, as his romance with Swift looks to be getting more and more serious. One person wrote: “Forever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private. It’s what makes Travis Kelce’s statements from earlier this year about ‘finding a breeder’ cringe. You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.” Another person said: “i ain’t a swiftie but don’t have to be one to be weirded out about travis kelce calling women ‘breeders’ [nauseuos emoji] that ain’t it dude.”\n\nMeanwhile, some folks came to the football star’s defense, writing: “‘Travis Kelce JOKED that he has to start breeding’ Have you seen videos of him with his nieces? He’s the fun uncle, they LOVE him. It wasn’t a diss on women, it was a sibling diss on his brother who has 3 kids. If he thought of women as breeders, he’d be Nick Cannon.” Another person wrote: “It’s really sad that some people are so desperate to $#1+ on someone else that even the most harmless of comments said in jest are pointed to as some sort of horrible social misstep.”\n\nCelebrity Breakups and Divorces of 2023\n\n2023 has seen a lot of celebrity deaths — and deaths in love due to breakups. Some couples have called it quits after years of being together. New relationships formed that looked as though they were meant for each other.\n\nWe’ve all wished for some relationships to have stayed together, despite not knowing what goes on behind closed doors. Celebrities are a prime example of not knowing what they are like in real life versus the facade of a perfect relationship they put out there.\n\nSometimes, fans are more upset than the celebrities who are going through the breakup! When Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn called it quits after 5 years together and a rumored secret marriage, fans professed they gave up on love entirely. Others used the breakups as a way to bash celebrities. Ariana Grande’s divorce announcement to Dalton Gomez caused viral videos of her alleged years of cheating on partners. As for the couples who share children together, our hearts broke for the ones we thought were happily ever afters.\n\nTake a look below at all the major celebrity relationships that have come to an end in 2023.\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
