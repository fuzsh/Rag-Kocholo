        "text": "(COLD OPENING) President Bush's press conference\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Good to see Parnell's Bush impression finally in a different setting from the boring behind-the-desk bits.\n\n- The reporters and their questions were funny.\n\n- Tina in a sketch!\n\nLowlights:\n\n- Rachel as Helen Thomas kinda made me miss Ana Gasteyer.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- The frozen stone look on Jeff's face in the background during the entire sketch cracked me up for some reason.\n\n- I'm surprised Jimmy didn't play the president of the Tom Cruise Fan Club, since he did a Tom Cruise impression before.\n\n- Tracy in that wig made him look like his Woodrow character.\n\n(MONOLOGUE) The male cast sings \"We Belong\" to Salma Hayek\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Edward Norton's cameo.\n\n- The guys looked hilarious dressed in those 80's outfits, especially Tracy.\n\nLowlights:\n\n- Not that funny; they've already done the \"male castmembers try to impress the female host\" monologue way too many times before.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- At first, I thought that was Seth under that costume, not Edward Norton. Speaking of which, I'm surprised he hasn't hosted yet.\n\n(SKETCH) \"Top O' The Morning\"\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The viper on the jukebox.\n\n- The \"Irish bone in her body\" joke.\n\nLowlights:\n\n- This sketch was more acceptable when it was kept in the post-Update slot. I don't think it's gotten good enough yet to be pushed all the way up to right after the monologue.\n\n- The midget/leprechaun bit fell flat.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- None.\n\n(TV FUNHOUSE) \"Are You Hot?\"\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Smigel makes up for his lackluster return last week with this. A great \"Are You Hot\" parody and the various classic cartoon characters were hilarious.\n\nLowlights:\n\n- The ending was dumb.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- Smigel actually got the real Lorenzo Lamas to do his own voice-over. I guess if Smigel could get Jared Fogel to do his own voice-over in one cartoon, he can get anybody.\n\n(WEEKEND UPDATE) Fallon & Fey, Fericito & Lupe, Avril Lavigne, Gollum\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Tina's Freedom Kissing joke.\n\n- The \"Jimmy and Tina Yelling at America\" rant. That's the classic Jimmy & Tina that this season's Updates need more of.\n\n- Fericito! I love this character, and it's good to see it back again after hearing it got cut a lot of times since the John McCain episode. Salma was also a good addition as Fericito's wife.\n\n- Amy was hilarious as Avril Lavigne.\n\n- Tina's All My Children joke.\n\n- Jimmy's guitar songs are good.\n\nLowlights:\n\n- Tina's farmhouse joke.\n\n- The Gollum segment was nothing but a recycled bit from the Superbowl special.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- Tonight, the end-of-Update cameo guy comes out in baggy clothes and takes Jimmy's pencil. Possibly the funniest cameo from him yet.\n\nBest Lines:\n\n- Will Forte as reporter Kevin Miller: \"Kevin Miller, online masturbator dating service. Do you believe that there is someone out there for everyone, and if so, is there a match for a man like Saddam Hussein?\"\n\nChris Parnell as George W. Bush: \"Kevin, I believe there is a match for everyone. However, until Saddam Hussein learns to be honest with himself, he will never have a successful relationship.\"\n\n- Horatio Sanz as chubby guy from Ain't it Cool News: \"I have a serious question. How kick-ass is the new Matrix trailer?\"\n\nChris Parnell as George W. Bush: \"It is the opinion of this administration that it is totally kick-ass.\"\n\n- Jimmy Fallon as Patrick Fitzwilliam: \"There's a bloody viper wrapped around the jukebox. He keeps playing \"Crocodile Rock\", I can't take it anymore!\"\n\n- Salma Hayek as Rosa: \"'Can't hold our liquor'?! Hey, I'm Mexican - I piss lighter fluid.\"\n\n- Tina Fey: \"In protest to France's opposition to a U.S. war in Iraq, the U.S. congress' cafeteria has changed French Fries and French Toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast. Afterwards, the congressmen were so pleased with themselves, they all started Freedom Kissing each other.\"\n\n- Horatio Sanz as Vasquez: \"Why don't you come back to my place and make some macaroni and cheeses? Then we can watch Cartoon Network, and you can rub my feets.\"\n\nJimmy, Horatio, and Fred were the main castmembers of the night. After being used a lot last week, Darrell goes back to suffering from Hartman-and-Nealon-Syndrome (i.e. long-time veterans not having anything left to do in their last season). Parnell YET AGAIN had more voice-overs than actual appearances. I keep pointing this out because although he indeed has a great and unique announcer's voice, he's an even better performer and should have much more appearances than voice-overs. If you do a count of all his sketches from this season so far, I bet half of them are only voice-overs. And this is the first in a long time where Maya had this little amount of sketches in an episode."
