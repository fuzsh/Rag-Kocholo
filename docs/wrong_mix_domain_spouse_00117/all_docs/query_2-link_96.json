        "text": "If only the initial denial that Eva Longoria was divorcing Tony Parker had been true for longer than a day, this week would have been about nothing but romance and wedding bells and the British monarchy.\n\nAnd the surging Tea Party, of course.\n\nBut the rumors were true and yet another golden couple made it nowhere near their golden anniversary (i.e. five years, Hollywood standard time).\n\nSPLIT OF THE WEEK: A fairytale wedding is no guarantee that the match is made in Grease heaven. Eva Longoria dropped her hyphenate like it was hot in filing for divorce from NBA star Tony Parker, who, like so many others before him, apparently was lulled into a false sense of texting security. He pleads innocent to cheating in the particular case of a former teammate's wife, but even if he didn't violate the marital code in that instance, he may have violated the bro code.\n\nUPSET OF THE WEEK: Bristol Palin still being on Dancing With the Stars wasn't that big a deal, until she knocked Brandy out of the running! The audience emitted an audible gasp, the contestants were stunned, Maksim Chmerkovskiy made no pretense of being cool with it, and now the FBI are investigating how an envelope full of powder (luckily just talc) ended up in the mailroom. Before she danced for her spot in the final, Bristol opened up to E! News about the controversy, the so-called conspiracy and life in general. Next week is the finale, also featuring Jennifer Grey and Kyle Massey. Care to cast your vote now ?\n\nTHOROUGHBRED ENGAGEMENT OF THE WEEK: Prince William has finally offered to make an honest royal of trendsetter Kate Middleton after roughly eight years of dating, giving her his late mum's ring and everything! Do you understand what a big deal this is?!\n\nCIVILIAN ENGAGEMENT OF THE WEEK: Like her supportive ex, Jessica Simpson is ready to give the newlyweds thing another try, too, accepting a proposal from retired footballer Eric Johnson (who isn't a poor social climber, for those of you who were wondering). In case it seems like he put a ring on it rather fast ( not Xmas fast, though), consider this: LeAnn Rimes' ex-husband, Dean Sheremet, is also planning to take the plunge again after being divorced for about five minutes. (On the flip side, Ali and Roberto plan to just be engaged for now.)\n\nSUPERHERO ENGAGEMENT OF THE WEEK: Watch With Kristin was thrilled to report that wedding bell s are part of the future for Clark and Lois on Smallville--even if it's a future viewers just have to trust in if the series signs off before \"I do's\" are said.\n\nPHOTOS: Get the week's hottest pics\n\nBABY BOOM: Pink admits she's aglow with expectancy...Chris Daughtry and wife Deanna welcomed twins Adalynn and Noah...Paulina Rubio and hubby Nicolas Vallejo welcomed their first nio, Andrea...Rachel Zoe admits to baby-bumpin'...Jen Schefft and hubby Joe Waterman welcomed daughter Mae Elizabeth...Ne-Yo and girlfriend Monyetta welcomed a daughter...Kelly Preston still bumpin', not birthin'.\n\nROMANCE FILES: Michael Phelps dipping into the dating pool with Brittny Gastineau...Kellen Lutz and AnnaLynne McCord still spending time together despite the breakup...Julianne Hough sings Ryan Seacrest's praises.\n\nDONE DEALS: Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley's divorce finalized...Sofia Vergara finally dating a single gentleman.\n\nTALKING TURKEY: Demi Lovato is in \" good spirits \" and committed to treatment, but would really like to be outta there by the holidays. Her parents will be going to her for Thanksgiving, at least.\n\nPOTTER'S FIELD: Leak, shmeak! Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 was a raging success at midnight, if not quite the draw that were New Moon and Eclipse...Daniel Radcliffe expounds on former costar Robert Pattinson (one of the grown-up Potter hotties) and kissing Emma Watson...Will Deathly Hallows get the Return of the King treatment ?...Do you want more Harry Potter books ?...Regardless, watch our replay of the film's New York premiere right here!\n\nHOT HOT HEAT: Ryan Reynolds is the sexiest man alive, per People, which means he showed great foresight in marrying Scarlett Johansson, aka GQ's Babe of the Year.\n\nKEEPING UP: Kendall Jenner has it in the bag thanks to Kim Kardashian.\n\nA SITUATION: DJ Pauly D's fans caused a ruckus at the University of Rhode Island when he made a surprise visit at a friend's dorm.\n\nFWIW, JK: Bristol Palin apologized on behalf of her and sister Willow for lashing out on Facebook at a few folks who didn't think Sarah Palin's Alaska was top-notch entertainment. Actually, Willow (or, there's always the possibility, a hacker) used a couple of gay slurs, but Bristol isn't running for public office and therefore felt no need to apologize for that part per se.\n\nSPEAKING UP: Oksana Grigorieva discussed the Mel Gibson Tapes on Larry King Live, saying she recorded her ex's rants so that she could both encourage him to get help and give her mother evidence to go on in case something happened to her. Meanwhile, the L.A. District Attorney's Office is looking into who leaked gobs of Gibson family court documents to the press.\n\nRIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES: Veteran Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was gunned down in her Mercedes Benz on the streets of Beverly Hills after attending the Burlesque premiere.\n\nTV LAND: Tyra Banks makes directorial debut...Top Chef: Just Desserts picks first winner...Medium canceled after seven seasons...
