        "text": "Taylor Swift’s State-by-State ‘Eras’ Popularity Revealed; Delaware Makes Rare Choice\n\nTaylor Swift has solidified her status as a beloved pop icon, and her success speaks for itself. With her iconic global Eras Tour and her strategic decision to re-record her initial six albums, her entire discography has garnered renewed attention from a broader audience.\n\nAcross the internet, Swifties have been associating their life experiences with specific Taylor Swift eras. Shane Co., a private jewelry company, set out to determine which Taylor Swift era is the most popular in each state.\n\nTo identify the most favored Taylor Swift era in each state, they analyzed Google Trends search data, which highlighted the era that consistently received the highest search interest since her debut in 2006. This analysis included all ten of her albums and all 57 of her released singles on Google Trends, tracing geographical trends dating back to the year of her debut singles and album.\n\nAre you ready for it?\n\nAccording to their research, Taylor’s third studio album, Speak Now, is the go-to choice in 14 states. That includes Michigan, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and New Jersey.\n\nInterestingly, Taylor’s home state, Tennessee, showed a greater interest in her 1989 era than in the albums she released while residing there, as the study pointed out. Other states, such as Pennsylvania, New York, and Rhode Island, appear to share this sentiment.\n\nNow, when it comes to the Lover era, only five states seem to be super into it. These states include Wyoming, Ohio, New Mexico, and Nevada. Meanwhile, folklore holds the top spot in 13 U.S. states.\n\nMidnights stands out as the album that didn’t manage to secure a win in any state. Notably, this album marked a historic achievement for Swift, as it positioned her as the first artist in history to claim all 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nWhen it comes to Red popularity, it was rare, but Delaware was there as the only state to prefer the album.\n\nThis study also dives into various other insights about Taylor Swift, including the standout albums and songs that dominate the music landscape in each state. Take a look at their other findings with the complete study here.\n\nAll The Celebrity Cameos In Taylor Swift’s Music Videos\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
