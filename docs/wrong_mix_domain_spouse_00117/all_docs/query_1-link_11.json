        "text": "A rep for the Newsroom actress and the Philadelphia Fusion president confirmed to ET in August 2020 that the two broke up amicably at the end of 2019. The pair was first linked in December 2018, after they were spotted holding hands while out in Los Angeles. Munn made her relationship Instagram official in November 2019, after attending her friend's Day of the Dead celebration. US Weekly was first to report the split. ET spoke with Munn about her relationship with Roberts in November 2019. At the time, the 40-year-old actress said she was already living her \"happily ever after.\" \"I've really come to a realization with myself that I'm already in my happily ever after. And if I want to have kids or want to get married then I'll do that, but it has to add to my life, you know? Everything has to add to my life,\" she said.\n\nWhile answering fan questions on her Instagram Stories in late December, the former Teen Mom OG star revealed she isn't dating anyone at the moment. \"Are you dating anyone?\" the fan asked bluntly, to which Palin replied, \"Noo.\" The revelation came just over one month after Palin and Moore, a former quarterback for Texas A&M University, went public with their relationship via Instagram on Nov. 16. At the time, they both shared a since-deleted photo of themselves hanging out on the sidelines of an Aggies football game. This marked Palin's first publicized romance since ending her marriage to Dakota Meyer in 2018, and Moore's first since finalizing his divorce from Makenzie Hausenfluck, his wife of over a year, in August.\n\nA source confirmed to ET in late December that the \"Sorry Not Sorry\" singer and the 25-year-old model had broken up after a short romance. The news came after Lovato deleted all photos of her former beau on her Instagram. A source told People that Lovato is \"concentrating on herself and her work right now, as well as focusing on her relationship with God. She’s excited for what this next chapter in 2020 will bring.\" The two were last seen together celebrating Friendsgiving. The former couple made their relationship Instagram official in early November, turning heads when they shared synchronized posts cuddling up to one another and confessing their love to the world.\n\nThe 39-year-old actor and 31-year-old singer have broken up after just over one year of dating, Us Weekly was first to report. A source told ET there was nothing dramatic and that they remain good friends. ET has reached out to their reps for comment. Last October, a source told ET that Channing and Jessie were dating after his split from his ex-wife, Jenna Dewan, in April 2018. A month after the report broke, Jessie said she was \"disappointed\" at those comparing her to 39-year-old Jenna. Throughout the course of their relationship, the two had been publicly supportive of one another, including Instagram pics Tatum took of the British singer performing at the 2019 Rock in Rio festival in Brazil and sweet PDA pics.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey stars have officially split, a source told ET in mid-December. Teresa and Joe, both 47, have been married since October 1999 and have four daughters together, Gia, Gabriella, Milania and Audriana. \"Teresa has been living the life of a single mother ever since Joe was incarcerated,\" the source said. \"She has dedicated herself to her children, her career and has focused only on that. She always knew there was a possibility that Joe would get deported but it all happened so fast after his release. Teresa is very realistic about the past. She has known for a while that things weren’t going to work out between them. Their marriage had been through far too much for them to start over. She's ready for a new start for 2020.\" ET has reached out to Teresa and Joe's reps for comment.\n\nTension between the pair was obvious when the two had a joint Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen interview in October. Joe was interviewed via satellite from Salerno, Italy, where he was living at his grandmother's house after being deported. Teresa and Joe both accused one another of cheating while they each spent time in prison for fraud charges, though they also both denied it. Teresa also said she didn't know how they could make the marriage work because of their trust issues as well as the physical distance between them, not to mention the fact that they've both changed since serving time in jail. They did reunite in Italy with their kids in early November, however.\n\nThe Bachelor in Paradise favorites have broken up. In Instagram posts with matching captions on Dec. 10, the formerly engaged couple announced that they have decided to end their romantic relationship. \"One of the many lessons this life has taught us is that it’s okay to be stubborn in the pursuit of happiness. To fight for what is real and good, and that often times the hardest thing and the right thing are the same,\" the caption read in part. \"We’ve reached a point in our story where we agree it’s best to go our separate ways. We have chosen to love and respect each other as friends because that’s the base of our relationship, and it’s what is most natural for us.\" The former couple's engagement was shown on the September finale of BIP. The rocky moments that plagued their time on the dating show, though, became more evident during the reunion portion of the finale when, despite still being engaged to Bukowski at the time, Morton said she was \"exhausted\" by the whole thing.\n\nThe This Is Us star filed for divorce from his wife in Los Angeles on Nov. 22 after two years of marriage. The actor listed irreconcilable differences as the reason for the divorce from the Selling Sunset star, per documents obtained by ET, and listed July 8 as the date of separation. A week and a half after Hartley filed, Stause responded with her own filing for dissolution of marriage, also citing irreconcilable differences, according to court documents acquired by ET though she listed their date of separation as the day he filed for divorce, not July. Interestingly enough, the two still very much appeared to be together after July 8, for example, when they posed on the red carpet together at the 10th Annual Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic in Los Angeles on Oct. 5. A source tells ET that Stause was blindsided by Hartley's divorce filing. Hartley met the Kentucky native on the set of The Young and the Restless and after nearly three years of dating, the actor proposed. They tied the knot at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, California, in October 2017.\n\nIn matching Instagram posts on Friday, the couple, who tied the knot in 2011, announced that they are splitting up. The news comes just over two months after Amurri, 34, and Martino, 38, announced that they're expecting their third child in spring 2020. \"Our family is starting down a new path. After a lot of thoughtful consideration, and work on our relationship, we have made the difficult decision to lovingly part ways as a couple,\" the pair captioned a smiling shot of their family. \"We are committed to, and excited about, raising our three beautiful children as close friends and deep partners, and we have the utmost respect for one another. We feel so grateful for the wonderful gifts we have created and received throughout our decade together. We have realized over time that the best path to happiness for us as a family is in this different direction, and we look forward to forging ahead into a new beautiful relationship. We appreciate your support and understanding as we navigate this new transition for our family.\" Amurri, who's the daughter of Susan Sarandon, and her soccer analyst husband already have two children, Marlowe, 5, and Major, 3. The pair welcomed Major after suffering a miscarriage in 2015.\n\nThe country music icon has called it quits with her wildlife photographer beau after two years together, a rep for the country singer confirmed to ET on Nov. 5. \"Skeeter and I broke up in May, so, unfortunately, we will not be spending [the holidays] together,\" McEntire told US Weekly. \"We still talk and we’re friends, but just decided to go our separate ways.\" Back in April, McEntire gushed about Lasuzzo while talking with ET ahead of the Academy of Country Music Awards, saying, \"We're having a great time, traveling the world and seeing things and having fun.\" McEntire met Lasuzzo in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and they started dating in 2017.\n\nKnowles and her husband of almost five years are going their separate ways. The 33-year-old singer announced the news via Instagram on Nov. 1 and shared that she and 56-year-old music video director split earlier this year. The \"Don't Touch My Hair\" singer still calls Ferguson a \"phenomenal man\" and says he changed her life. The two started dating in 2008 after being introduced by Janelle Monae and tied the knot in Novemver 2014 in front of family and friends at the Holy Trinity Church in New Orleans. Knowles was previously married to Daniel Smith, with whom she shares her 15-year-old son, Daniel Julez J. Smith Jr. The two divorced in 2007 after three years of marriage.\n\nThe BH90210 actor took to Instagram on Oct. 31 to announce that he and his wife are separating. \"It is with a heavy heart that I tell you Erin and I are splitting up,\" he wrote. \"With our hectic work schedules we could not be busier, and over the last few years have grown apart. She is one of the most incredible women I have ever met and the best mom to our kids.\" The pair -- who tied the knot in May 2010, in a ceremony in Newport Beach, California -- share two daughters, 8-year-old Mia and 6-year-old Penna. This is the New Jersey native's second split after his divorce from playboy model Nikki Schieler in 2002 after nearly five years of marriage.\n\nThe former Teen Mom 2 star is moving on from her husband after a tumultuous year. The 27-year-old reality star took to social media on Oct. 30 to share her decision with her fans. \"I've mostly kept off social media the past few days because I've been focused on making some big life decisions,\" she wrote. \"I've lived my life on camera since I was 17 years old. And a lot of it hasn't been pretty. But it's been my life.\" She went on to say that time away from Teen Mom 2 since her firing in May has allowed her to reexamine her life and choices. \"I know I need to make changes. I'm starting that now,\" she wrote. \"The kids and I have moved away from David. Nobody gets into a marriage expecting it to end but I know that's what is best for me, and for my kids. Today I've filed papers to start that process.\" She told her fans that she and her three children are \"doing great,\" teasing, \"You'll hear from us again soon.\" Evans has three children; she shares daughter 2-year-old daughter Ensley with Eason, 5-year-old son Kaiser with ex Nathan Griffith and 10-year-old son Jace with ex Andrew Lewis.\n\nThe Bachelor in Paradise couple has ended their engagement, they announced on Oct. 30. Burnett and Haggerty were Bachelor Nation's first same-sex relationship; their historic proposal aired on the season 6 finale of BiP in September. \"What has always been at the forefront of our relationship is love and care for one another. Our priority is doing what is best for us. With a heavy heart full of love for one another we have decided it is best for us to take a step back from our relationship. We ultimately want what is best for us in the long run and for us right now, that means being apart and growing individually,\" Burnett wrote in part on Instagram, with Haggerty posting an identical statement on her account.\n\nThe Claws actress took to Instagram on Oct. 30 to announce that she and her husband of eight years were splitting up. \"We believe in the beauty of truth. Always have,\" the post read. \"Our truth is that in this season of our lives, we are better friends than partners in marriage. Our union was such a gorgeous ride. And as we go our separate ways now, we feel fortunate for the love we share -- present tense.\" ET has reached out to the actress' rep for comment. Nash called her Malibu wedding to Tucker, an electrical engineer, a \"dream come true\" in an interview with Life & Style magazine in 2011. Her good friend, Sherri Shepherd, was a bridesmaid, while singer Brandy performed \"At Last\" for the couple's first dance. ET last spoke to Nash at the 2019 Emmys in September, where she brought along a gal-pal.\n\nThe former baseball pro filed for divorce on Oct. 25, according to Us Weekly. ET has reached out to the couple for comment. After news of their split broke shortly after their five-year wedding anniversary, Jim defended himself amid reports that he and his wife split due to his alleged infidelity, as Us Weekly previously reported that the pair broke up after the Real Housewives of Orange County star accused her husband of cheating on her with one of their nannies. ET has reached out to the couple for comment. The pair originally tied the knot in 2014 and share 2-year-old daughter Aspen and 16-month-old twin boys, Hayes and Hart.\n\nThe couple shared a joint statement to social media on Oct. 17 -- almost 10 years to the day they wed in 2009 -- announcing that they were splitting amicably. \"Twelve years ago we fell in love and became partners. We joined our two amazing families, had countless laughs, made wonderful friends and were blessed with incredible opportunities,\" the statement read. \"Today we take our next step together, but on separate paths. We will always be grateful for the love we've shared and will always work together to raise our two beautiful dogs. We will be taking time to rediscover ourselves in this transition and we thank you for your patience and support in giving us the space to do so.\"\n\nThe pair's relationship has likely come to an end. A source tells ET that the former couple -- who share a 1-year-old daughter, Ariana -- will not get back together following Ortiz-Magro's arrest for alleged domestic violence earlier this month. The source says that the duo, who have not spoken since the night of the alleged incident, is dealing with the aftermath of their latest ordeal the best they can. The source claimed, however, that their friends consider the pair's relationship toxic and think that nothing good will come of it.\"They are over for good,\" the source said. Ortiz-Magro, the source added, is \"100% committed to doing what’s best for his daughter and is cooperating with law enforcement and the legal teams involved.\"\n\nPreviously, Ortiz-Magro and Harley had a tumultuous end to 2018, calling it quits briefly before New Year's Eve and then getting back together, only to end the year by getting in another massive scuffle, leading to their latest breakup. The combative couple reportedly got into a screaming altercation that allegedly got physical, one source told E! News.

They were last seen together in public at the premiere of Scott's new Netflix documentary, Travis Scott: Look Mom I Can Fly, in August, where they packed on the PDA on the red carpet and coddled their 20-month-old daughter, Stormi Webster. Jenner and Scott first sparked romance rumors in April 2017. For over a year before their split, the couple was continuously the focus of engagement rumors and took to calling each other \"husband\" and \"wife,\" prompting many fans to believe that they'd secretly gotten married. Earlier this year, the pair weathered a supposed cheating scandal when Scott faced rumors and allegations of cheating, which he vehemently denied. ET has reached out to reps for both Jenner and Scott for comment.\n\n\"Kylie and Travis haven’t been together as a couple for roughly a month, but they’re on good terms,\" a source told ET on Oct. 2. \"The couple has been hot and cold since their last breakup, and haven’t been able to fully get on the same page again. They are both extremely busy with different schedules and since Kylie found out about Travis messaging another girl on Instagram, the rebuilding of trust has been hard. Although they aren’t together now, they’re both open to getting back together in the future. Above all, Kylie and Travis know their priority will and always has been Stormi.”\n\nThe Food Network star and author and the New York governor have broken up after 14 years together, multiple sources report. \"Over the recent past, we have realized that our lives have gone in different directions and our romantic relationship has turned into a deep friendship,\" the couple said in a joint statement on Sept. 25, which was first reported by Zack Fink via Twitter. \"We will always be family and are fully supportive of each other and dedicated to the girls.

I ask for our privacy to be respected moving forward.\" The couple married in a sunset ceremony in St. Lucia in June 2017 and welcomed their first child, Brooklyn, in November 2018. In a statement to People, Daly said, \"I have come to the difficult decision to separate from Kenya at this time.

During an interview with current DWTS champ Bobby Bones, Alaina shared that she doesn't \"have a boyfriend anymore.\" \"I mean, there's, like, no big story,\" she explained. \"We were like, best friends before we dated, and we’re still best friends. It just didn’t work out. I guess that’s how dating goes, right?\" The Bobby Bones Show was also where Alaina initially confirmed her relationship with Crist back in May.

According to multiple reports, the two ended their relationship in May. ET has reached out to Foxx and Holmes' reps.
