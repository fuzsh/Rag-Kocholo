        "text": "Thank you for a really thoughtful post. I'm so happy when replies add something substantial to the conversation. I'm curious if anyone else has follow Ms. Phair's closely enough to comment on this post. I do remember having friends who knew her back at Oberlin lo these many years. First it was Ms. Phair as the post-Oberlin It Girl of the massified hipster underground; 20 years later it's Ms. Dunham. How interesting.\n\nI won't quote it again, but I just have to say that Sean's post is by far the single best post I've ever read at SH.tv. Well-written and totally spot-on.\n\nI actually discovered Liz via the self-titled album, so I don't have the attachment to Guyville that most fans do (although \"Stratford-On-Guy\" is one of my favorite songs of all time). I think it's fantastic and especially impressive considering it was her debut, but there are a couple of songs I could take or leave. But I genuinely love the self-titled album. I heard \"Why Can't I\" and thought it was ok, but I couldn't get it out of my head. Somewhere or other I found a stream of the full album and was instantly hooked. I was a 14/15-year-old guy who'd never been in a relationship, so I can't point to any reason why it connected with me so much but a decent percentage of those songs still resonate with me. As a teenager, songs like \"Rock Me\" and \"Favorite\" had a forbidden fruit sort of appeal, and they eventually shifted from guilty pleasures to shameless fun pop songs for me. Over the years, songs like \"Red Light Fever,\" \"Friend of Mine,\" \"Good Love Never Dies,\" and especially \"Extraordinary\" have become increasingly meaningful as I've gained more life experience and gotten some more maturity in my attitudes towards people, women in particular.\n\nThat album is much less vapid and shallow than people will ever give it credit for. It's a departure, no doubt about it, and I certainly can understand why it turned people off. But you look at things like the ridiculous 0.0 review from Pitchfork, and it's obviously just a kneejerk response from someone who not only never gave it a chance; they were determined to hate it so much that they overlooked its legitimate faults in favor of excessive and pedantic criticism of minor subjective flaws. Liz didn't betray anyone, least of all herself, but the reaction to this album was so visceral that it became hard to take it seriously.\n\nAfter that, even for a fan of the self-titled album, Somebody's Miracle was a bit of a letdown. I think Liz described it as a \"f***ing compromise disaster,\" which I think is a pretty accurate summary. There are good songs on there, but from a production standpoint, nobody seemed to know what direction they were going in. It seemed like they wanted to step away from the pop sheen of the self-titled but still keep it polished, but it wound up feeling like an unfinished demo. Ironically, the acoustic versions I've heard of songs from this album (especially \"Count on My Love\") really blow the album versions away.\n\nAs for Funstyle, the straightforward songs like \"Miss September\" and \"Satisfied\" are pretty stellar, and I can't deny my love for \"Beat is Up.\""
