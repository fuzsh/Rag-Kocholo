        "text": "Concert Review\n\n3 Doors Down\n\nSeneca Niagara Events Center\n\nNiagara Falls, NY\n\nSaturday February 8, 2014\n\nReview/Photos: Joseph Suto\n\nLiving in western New York can be quite trying during the early months of the year. The harsh winter we have experienced so far has made many suffer from symptoms of cabin fever. So when the Seneca Niagara Events Center played host to an acoustic performance by 3 Doors Down Saturday evening, people came out in droves. The tour, called Songs From The Basement, gave the setting a homey feel with couches on both sides of the stage for some lucky fans to experience the band in a whole different light.\n\nThe current lineup of 3 Doors Down features vocalist Brad Arnold, guitarists Chris Henderson and Chet Roberts, bassist Justin Biltonen and drummer Greg Upchurch. Arnold was extremely talkative during the show as he had fun ribbing on a few band members as well as telling some stories about the songs themselves.\n\nThe band sprinkled in songs from all five of their studio releases as well as some surprise cover choices. “The Dance” by Garth Brooks was an unanticipated choice as Arnold called it his favorite song of all time when he introduced it to the crowd, causing a loud ovation. The band also gave us their spin on the Metallica classic “Nothing Else Matters” which sounded amazing.\n\nSome other highlights included the band’s three top 10 smashes “Kryptonite,” “When I’m Gone” and “Here Without You.” Another song that went over very well with the capacity crowd was “It’s Not My Time” from the band’s self titled 2008 release.\n\nWhile the band has gone through a few member changes over the past couple of years, their current lineup’s performance Saturday evening was nothing short of amazing. The impeccable sound of the Events Center made you think you were in the Casino’s other venue The Bear’s Den, for a brief moment. Seeing the band perform in a cozy acoustic setting helped heat things up even if for only one evening.\n\nSet List\n\nFather’s Son\n\nLet Me Be Myself\n\nBe Like That\n\nNot Enough\n\nLanding in London\n\nThe Dance (Garth Brooks cover)\n\nWhen You’re Young\n\nLet Me Go\n\nPages\n\nAway From the Sun\n\nIt’s Not My Time\n\nDuck and Run\n\nLoser\n\nKryptonite\n\nEncore\n\nNothing Else Matters (Metallica Cover)\n\nHere Without You\n\nWhen I’m Gone\n\nSpecial thanks to Tony Astran for all his help in allowing us to cover the show\n\nFor more information on shows at Seneca Niagara Casino click here"
