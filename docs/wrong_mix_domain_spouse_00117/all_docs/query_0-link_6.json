        "text": "Real Housewives of New Jersey's Melissa Gorga and her husband Joe locked happy in love as they packed on the PDA while arriving to the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nAs the duo shared a passionate kiss ahead of the star-studded award ceremony on Sunday evening, all eyes were on the 43-year-old reality star, who rocked a semi-sheer beige jumpsuit, with an open back, covered in jewels.\n\nShe completed her sexy ensemble with a few layered silver necklaces, diamond stud earrings and plain open-toed heels, which displayed her simple white pedicure.\n\nThe mother-of-three's dark brown hair cascaded down her back in loose curls and her glamorous makeup look, consisting of a sultry grey smoky eyeshadow, nude lipstick and highlighter to enhance her beautiful features.\n\nHer longtime spouse, who she wed in 2004, wore a casual white t-shirt, black pants and chunky sneakers to the event.\n\nEarlier this month, the duo skipped his sister Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas’ wedding amid 'completely ridiculous' rumors that she cheated on him.\n\nMultiple sources previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Melissa, Joe, 42, and Teresa, 50, had a massive row while filming the most recent Real Housewives Of New Jersey finale over cheating accusations.\n\nA source close to the situation has denied these reports after it was claimed on social media that Melissa had an affair with Nick Barotta - who is also married - and they called the rumors 'completely ridiculous' and said that Nick had been 'close friends' with Melissa and Joe for years.\n\nSources previously described Teresa's shouting match with Melissa as ‘a crazy situation’ that was the last straw for Melissa and Gorga, who opted to skip her wedding over the weekend to Ruelas.\n\nThe same source described the confrontation as a 'step too far for Joe.' He subsequently reposted a photo Melissa posted to Instagram of the couple partying at home with friends on the day of Teresa's wedding, but he added the confrontational caption, 'blood doesn't make you family.'\n\nOne of the biggest honors of the night will go to Nicki Minaj, who will be honored with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\n\nThe 39-year-old rap megastar will be presented with the highly-coveted trophy that is given to recording artists for outstanding contributions and profound impact on music video and popular culture.\n\nNicki will also be performing a medley of some of her greatest hits influenced by her catalogue of music videos.\n\nRock legends the Red Hot Chili Peppers will also perform as they are to be honored with the Global Icon Award.\n\nThe recognition celebrates 'an artist or band whose unparalleled career, continued impact and influence have maintained a unique level of global success in music and beyond, leaving an indelible mark on the music landscape.'\n\nAs for the regular awards, there is a three-way tie for most nominations between Lil Nas X, Kendrick Lamar, and Jack Harlow.\n\nThe three hip-hop acts are followed closely by Doja Cat and Harry Styles who received six nods each.\n\nThere is quite the field among those nominated for five awards as that list includes: Billie Eilish, Drake, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and The Weeknd.\n\nThe most nominated group or duo were K-pop sensations BTS who earned four.\n\nMTV expanded the number of nominees for its top award, video of the year, to seven for the very first time in its 39-year history.\n\nArtist of the year, best collaboration, and best alternative have also been expanded to seven nominees.\n\nTop prize of the night, video of the year, features quite the field including Doja Cat – Woman, Drake ft. Future & Young Thug – Way 2 Sexy, Ed Sheeran – Shivers, Harry Styles – As It Was, Lil Nas X, Jack Harlow – Industry Baby, Olivia Rodrigo – brutal, and Taylor Swift – All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version).\n\nIf Lil Nas X wins he will be the first artist to ever win back-to-back awards in the sought-after category.\n\nBad Bunny is the first ever Latin artist to be nominated for artist of the year as he will face Ed Sheeran, Drake, Styles, Harlow, Lil Nas X, and Lizzo.\n\nThere is also the video for good category which is for the best video with a message as the nominees include Kendrick Lamar - The Heart Part 5, Latto - P****, Lizzo - About Damn Time, Rina Sawayama - This Hell. and Stromae - Fils de joie.\n\nA new category that has been added this year is best metaverse performance with nominees including BLACKPINK The Virtual | PUBG, BTS | Minecraft, Charli XCX | Roblox, Justin Bieber – An Interactive Virtual Experience. Rift Tour ft. Ariana Grande | Fortnite, and Twenty One Pilots Concert Experience | Roblox.\n\nMusical performances will also be a massive part of the event as Lizzo is set to perform 2 Be Loved (Am I Ready).\n\nK-pop megagroup Blackpink will also be performing their megahit single which was just released titled Pink Venom.\n\nAnitta, J Balvin, Kane Brown, Jack Harlow, Khalid and Marshmello, Måneskin, and Panic! At The Disco will all be hitting the stage during the show."
