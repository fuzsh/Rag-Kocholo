They share two sons; the \"Marriage Story\" director-writer also has a teenage son with his first wife, actress Jennifer Jason Leigh.\n\nKeep reading to see who else got married this year…\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more fun celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nIn November, \"Two Broke Girls\" and Marvel actress Kat Dennings married rocker Andrew W.K. at their Los Angeles home, the couple confirmed to Vogue in December, sharing pictures from their nuptials.\n\nThe pair — who went public with their romance in May 2021 — exchanged vows in front of just 15 guests including good friends Macaulay Culkin and Brenda Song.\n\n\"About three years ago, Andrew had come to visit me for the first time. At the end of his trip, we couldn't imagine ever separating. We actually proposed to each other in the kitchen at the exact same moment,\" Kat told Vogue.\n\nThe actress, who wore a lacy vintage Alexander McQueen look on her big day, created everything for the ceremony herself. \"I wanted our wedding to feel completely different from an 'industry event' in every way,\" she told Vogue. \"I even handmade all of our wedding florals, aisle pieces and our ceremony arch, which took three entire days. I wanted to be hands-on with the entire experience and feel like we had built our moment together from scratch.\"\n\nMORE: Celeb engagements of 2023\n\n_\n\nActress Vanessa Hudgens and professional baseball player Cole Tucker are married!\n\nThe \"High School Musical\" star and the athlete exchanged vows on Dec. 2 in Tulum, Mexico.(Vogue has the photos from the jungle-inspired nuptials.)\n\nThe bride wore a custom Vera Wang cowl-neck dress for her ceremony then changed into a second look by the designer for their reception.\n\nThe couple's romance was revealed in early 2021 and they announced their engagement in February 2023.\n\nMORE: Celeb engagement rings revealed\n\n_\n\nAfter months and months of speculation, Adele has confirmed she's married to sports agent Rich Paul, Instagram gossip site Deuxmoi reported in November. While attending friend Alan Carr's comedy show in Los Angeles, Adele revealed during a fun-spirited outburst that she'd tied the knot. \"I was at Alan Carr's comedy show in LA tonight and Adele was in the audience. Alan asked the crowd if anyone got married recently and Adele shouted 'I did,'\" the alleged witness wrote to Deuxmoi.\n\nAnother audience member said the comedy show was \"small and intimate,\" adding, \"When he asked if anyone got married recently she yelled 'I did.' Super cute all around and was super sweet but [Adele] dipped right before [the show] ended.\"\n\n_\n\nFormer \"The Bachelor\" franchise host Chris Harrison and \"Entertainment Tonight\" personality and producer Lauren Zima are now husband and wife. \"We're married,\" they captioned a wedding photo on Instagram — People magazine has more pics — adding, \"Let the journey begin…\"\n\nTheir first wedding took place in Napa Valley, California — where Chris proposed two years earlier — on Oct. 14. That ceremony was \"emotional\" and \"jubilant,\" the couple told People. Then came a \"blowout bash\" at a ranch in Austin, Texas — where the couple now lives — on Nov. 4.\n\n\"As much as we wanted an intimate weekend for our wedding ceremony in Napa, we also wanted to celebrate getting married with all the great friends we have — hence this bigger party,\" Lauren said. \"Doing the second event in Austin gave us the ability to include all of our friends, and also made sure that we didn't leave our wedding feeling like we didn't even see any of our loved ones — a story we've heard before.\"\n\nMany familiar faces were on the guest list for the newlyweds' Lone Star state events that included a \"Bachelor World\" reunion: Wells Adams and wife Sarah Hyland, Ben Higgins and wife Jessica Clarke, Arie Luyendyk Jr. and wife Lauren Burnham, Sean Lowe and wife Catherine Giudici, JoJo Fletcher, Trista Sutter, Colton Underwood and husband Jordan C. Brown, Bob Guiney and wife Jessica Canyon and more.\n\n\"They say everything's bigger in Texas, and that's what we're leaning into,\" Chris told People.\n\n_\n\nOn Nov. 5, TMZ reported that country music star Zac Brown is once again a married man: The Zac Brown Band frontman married model, actress and stuntwoman Kelly Yazdi on Aug. 31 in Coweta County, Georgia, according to a marriage certificate obtained by the webloid.\n\nThe wedding confirmation comes a little more than a year after Kelly was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her left hand. The couple's engagement was ultimately confirmed in December 2022.\n\nIt's the second marriage for Zac, whose 12-year union with first wife Shelly — with whom he has five kids — ended in 2018.\n\n_\n\nSurprise! \"This Is Us\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" star Milo Ventimiglia quietly married model Jarah Mariano earlier in 2023, Us Weekly confirmed on Oct. 30.\n\nNo other wedding details were shared, though Us has a wedding photo.\n\nThe actor and the beauty were first linked in 2022.\n\n_\n\nOn Oct. 25, \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" alum Albie Manzo married Chelsea DeMonaco in the Italian countryside overlooking the hills of Umbria, People magazine — which has wedding pics — confirmed. The former \"Manzo'd With Children\" star's bride also shared photos from their nuptials on Instagram.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Bravo star Caroline Manzo's son and his new wife celebrated with a reception for 85 friends and family members featuring a menu stacked with pizza, lamb skewers, mini burgers, fried ricotta, salami table, risotto, pasta, beef, eggplant and fish as well as Aperol spritz cocktails and Italian lemon sodas, People reported.\n\nThe newlyweds have been together since 2019.\n\n_\n\nFrances Bean Cobain is married!\n\nThe only child of late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and Hole frontwoman Courtney Love wed musician and skateboarder Riley Hawk — the son of skateboard legend Tony Hawk and his first wife, Cindy Dunbar.\n\nTMZ reported that the wedding took place in Los Angeles on Oct. 7 and was officiated by Frances's godfather, R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe.\n\nThe celebrity scions have been together since at least early 2021.\n\nAccording to TMZ, this is Riley's first marriage and Frances's second: She filed to divorce musician Isaiah Silva in 2016 less than two years after they exchanged vows. A battle over one of her late rock icon father's guitars made headlines as their split played out.\n\n_\n\nMusician Wolfgang Van Halen – the son of late music star Eddie Van Halen and actress Valerie Bertinelli – married longtime love Andraia Allsop at home in their living room surrounded by 90 friends and family members on Oct. 15, then headed to the backyard for a reception.\n\nThe date's a special one: It marked eight years since their first date took place on Oct. 15, 2015.\n\nThe bride walked down the aisle with her father to Dean Martin's \"Everybody Loves Somebody,\" while the groom – the frontman in the band Mammoth WVH – walked down the aisle with mother Valerie to a song his dad, Eddie, wrote for him. \"The song that my father had written for me, it's an instrumental piece called '316,'\" Wolfie told People magazine, which has photos from the couple's big day.\n\nAndraia told People she also had \"little memory charms with a picture of Wolfie and his dad on it\" made as a surprise gift for the wedding party to wear with their boutonnieres, corsages and bouquets so that everyone could \"think of him throughout the day.\"\n\nNew mother-in-law Valerie also lent Andraia a necklace to wear on her wedding day – a piece of jewelry that Eddie had given to the \"Once Day at a Time\" actress before they divorced. Eddie died three years ago in October 2020 after a lengthy cancer battle.\n\n_\n\nOn Oct. 20, \"Bachelor in Paradise\" season 7 stars Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs announced that they tied the knot a week earlier — less than a month after the former \"The Bachelorette\" star gave birth to their son, Benson Lee Jacobs Kufrin. \"10/13/23 | Mr. & Mrs.,\" the couple captioned a series of photos from their wedding day.\n\nBecca later took to her Instagram Story to share more details, including how they planned a simple ceremony in about two days: After giving up on plans to wed earlier in the month because they were too tired with their newborn, they picked Friday the 13th since it was \"a fun day to tie the knot.\" They then signed their marriage documents at a San Diego courthouse and had a five-minute ceremony at the Hotel Del Coronado \"over burgers and a mezze platter,\" Becca shared, adding, \"'twas glorious.\"\n\nThe couple got engaged — twice — in 2022. Becca proposed to him in May and Thomas popped the question to her in October.\n\n_\n\nCountry music star Billy Ray Cyrus and Australian singer-songwriter Firerose — who's nearly three decades his junior — tied the knot on Oct. 10 following an engagement of a little more than a year.\n\nThe age-mismatched duo — he was 62 when they said \"I do\" while she was reportedly somewhere in her mid-30s — shared the happy news on Instagram, captioning a slideshow of wedding photos, \"10/10/23 will always be the beautiful, joyous day that our two souls united as one in holy matrimony. It was the most perfect, ethereal celebration of love we could have ever imagined. For both of us to hear the preacher say, 'Billy Ray and Firerose Cyrus… I now pronounce you husband and wife,' that was the sacred moment our new forever began. Long Live Love!\"\n\nFirerose is just a few years older than Billy Ray's oldest biological children: son Christopher Cody Cyrus and daughter Miley Cyrus, who were both born in 1992 and in their early 30s when their dad wed for the third time. She's either the same age or a few years younger than his two adopted children — daughter Brandi Cyrus, who was born in 1987, and son Trace Cyrus, who was born in 1989 — whom he raised as his own after he married his second wife, Tish Cyrus, in 1993.\n\nBilly Ray and Firerose, who became songwriting partners during the pandemic, took their long-term friendship to the next level after he and Tish called it quits for good in the spring of 2022.\n\nTish remarried just a month before Billy Ray, exchanging vows with \"Prison Break\" actor Dominic Purcell at daughter Miley Cyrus's Malibu home in August 2023. (More on that later!)\n\n_\n\nFormer \"Teen Wolf\" star Tyler Posey married musician Phem (real name: Olivia Marsico) at a private meditation garden in Los Angeles's Pacific Palisades area on Oct. 14.\n\nThe couple and their guests — including stars Bella Thorne and Avril Lavigne — celebrated at a reception at Duke's Malibu. The groom's cousin, actress Elizabeth Posey, shared wedding photos on Instagram.\n\nThe actor-musician proposed on a beach in Cambria, California, in February 2023 after two years of dating, ETOnline reported.\n\n_\n\nOn Sept. 9, Marvel actor Chris Evans married actress Alba Baptista at their Boston-area home, People magazine reported.\n\nWedding guests included Chris's Marvel co-stars including Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Hemsworth. John Krasinski and wife Emily Blunt were also there, according to People.\n\nPage Six further reported that Chris and Alba were planning to throw a second wedding celebration in Europe. \"There is going to be a second gathering in [her native] Portugal for members of Alba's family who couldn't be in Massachusetts,\" a source said, adding that it was expected to happen in the days after their American wedding. \"Then they'll depart from Portugal for their honeymoon.\"\n\nDuring a New York Comic Con appearance on Oct. 14, People reported, Chris finally publicly confirmed that he's now a husband and called their two weddings \"wonderful and beautiful.\"\n\n\"It's a lot planning a wedding. For those of you who are married you know it takes a lot out of you,\" he added. \"But now that we're through that, we've just been enjoying life, gearing up for autumn, my favorite season. Now we're just relaxing and enjoying life and reflecting.\"\n\nThe \"Avengers\" actor and the \"Warrior Nun\" actress's romance was publicly revealed in November 2022. The pair did not announce an engagement before they married.\n\n_\n\nA \"Sister Wives\" star is a wife again! Christine Brown — who ended her polygamist marriage with Kody Brown in November 2021 — married David Woolley on Oct. 7. The couple made things official in a large ceremony in Moab, Utah, in front of 330 guests including their combined 14 children (David, a widow, is a father of eight and Christine shares six children with Kody).\n\nDavid revealed it was important to his new bride to have a big wedding, telling People magazine, \"She wants to be able to wear a white dress and walk down the aisle with her dad… She never got to do [that with] her first marriage.
