        "text": "Can You Believe This Sheet?\n\nBS SHOW BIZ BUZZ:\n\n✳ Simon Cowell has allegedly snubbed Brit singer Cheryl Cole’s invitation to join her for her $75,000 30th birthday bash last night in Los Angeles. She’d reportedly hoped it would be the perfect opportunity to end their long-standing feud. The pair famously fell out when Simon dropped her as a judge on the US version of “The X Factor”, replacing her with Nicole Scherzinger. Cheryl subsequently refused to rejoin the British version of the show.\n\n– “Sunday People”\n\n• Zach Braff, Lena Dunham, and Melissa McCarthy have been named to the inaugural list of ‘Innovators Who Are Changing Hollywood’. Former “Scrubs” star Braff is selected for popularizing crowd-funding entertainment projects on Kickstarter.com. “Girls” creator Dunham is chosen for paving the way for other female TV writers.

Ballantine Books has announced it will not publish “Paula Deen’s New Testament: 250 Favorite Recipes, All Lightened Up”. It declined to elaborate on why it decided to scrap the book by the queen of Southern cooking, but there’s no doubt it’s related to her recent highly publicized use of a racial slur. “Paula Deen’s New Testament” was intended to be the 1st book in a 2-book deal with Ballantine.\n\n– Reuters.com\n\n✳ Chilean actor Pedro Pascal has been cast in a key role for the upcoming season of fantasy TV series “Game of Thrones”.

Pascal will make his series debut in the 4th season of the drama, due to air on HBO in 2014.\n\n– EW.com\n\n✳ 43-year-old singer-actress Jennifer Lopez has only been dating 26-year-old Casper Smart for 18 months but has reportedly told pals she’s so in love that she doesn’t need a prenuptial agreement before she ties the knot with the back-up dancer. An inside source says it’s J-Lo’s way of convincing herself, her exes, and the world that Casper is not just a rebound like some critics claim. Lopez insists that their love is real, the source says, just like she did with Marc Anthony … and Cris Judd … and Ojani Noa. You know what they say – 4th time’s a charm!\n\n– “OK!

A few highlights …\n\n✓ All-Time Best TV Series … “The Wire” (2002-08).\n\n✓ All-Time Best Movie … “Citizen Kane” (1941).\n\n✓ All-Time Best Album … “Revolver” by The Beatles (1966).\n\n✓ All-Time Best Book … “Anna Karenina” by Leo Tolstoy (1873-77).\n\n✓ All-Time Best Play … “Death Of a Salesman” by Arthur Miller (1949).\n\n– ContactMusic.com\n\nSCIENTISTS SAY:\n\nA compendium of recent ‘discoveries’ …\n\n• Scientists say … that two-thirds of adults tilt their heads to the right when they kiss. We owe this valuable knowledge to a researcher in Germany. (In a related story, it is very easy to get a research grant in Germany.)\n\n• Scientists say … men get dumber as they get older. Research presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science shows that men lose large chunks of brain cells and several points of IQ between the ages of 18 and 50. (Wow that’s scary, considering the average 17-year-old guy is a complete moron.)\n\n• Scientists say … we spend about 30% of our waking hours using some form of media exclusively. Ball State University researchers have also found we spend another 39% of our time using media while also doing another activity, such as listening to radio at work. (Or texting about a TV show we’re watching while working on a laptop and checking email on a tablet.)\n\nHOW TO PICK UP WOMEN:\n\nAccording to the Neil Strauss book, “The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists”, making moves on women is both an art and a science. Among the many rules of the game …\n\n• Show no interest at first, followed by intense attention. This is called the ‘push-pull’.\n\n• Never stoop to buy your target a drink, let her buy you one.\n\n• Toss in a casual insult (a ‘neg’) that conveys lack of interest. (“Those are nice nails; are they real?”)\n\n• Lie about having to leave soon in order to the target’s anxiety. This false time constraint conveys a sense of immediacy. (“I’ve only got 10 minutes. Can I share them with you?”)\n\n• Always get her phone number.\n\n– CP\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe word ‘jaywalking’ is derived from the American slang ‘jay’, a popular term in the early 20th century meaning a rustic newcomer unfamiliar with city ways. (In other words, a ‘rube’.)\n\n– BBC.co.uk\n\nBS CHRONOMETER 07.01.13\n\nTODAY’S CELEBIRTHDAYS . . .\n\n1945 [68] Deborah Harry, Miami FL, classic rock singer (Blondie-“Call Me”, “Heart of Glass”)\n\n1952 [61] Dan Aykroyd, Ottawa ON, movie actor (“Driving Miss Daisy”, “Blues Brothers”)/ex-TV comic (“Saturday Night Live” 1975-79)\n\n1967 [46] Pamela Anderson, Ladysmith BC, TV personality (“Dancing With the Stars” 2012, 2010)/movie actress (“Borat”)/former TV actress (“Baywatch” 1992-97)/model (6 “Playboy” covers)/ex-Mrs Rick Saloman (2007-08)/ex-Mrs Kid Rock (2006)/ex-Mrs Tommy Lee (1995-98)\n\n1977 [36] Liv Tyler (Rundgren), NYC, movie actress (“The Incredible Hulk”, “Lord Of the Rings” trilogy)/daughter of Aerosmith’s Steve Tyler & former “Playboy” playmate Bebe Buell\n\nTODAY’S BS REASONS TO PARTY . . .\n\n• “Canada Day”, the country’s national day which celebrates nationhood in 1867.
