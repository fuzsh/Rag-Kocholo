        "text": "Credit: Shutterstock (3)\n\nTaylor Swift's Celebrity BFFs Through the Years\n\nSince becoming a global superstar, Taylor Swift has amassed quite the crew of celebrity friends. The Grammy winner aligned herself with the likes of Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid and Karlie Kloss in the early 2010s. That exclusive squad eventually evolved to a smaller, tight-knit group. “In my 20s I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend,” Swift wrote in a May 2019 Elle essay. “So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone.” Swift noted the importance of “learning the difference between lifelong friendships” and “situationships,\" explaining, “It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships.” She realized true friends were “the ones who stuck around” through highs and lows. “I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I'm #canceled,” she wrote. “They were there in the worst times and they’re here now.” Scroll down to see Swift’s A-list BFFs through the years!\n\nCredit: Jeff Vespa/WireImage\n\nJessica Chastain\n\nThe pair were spotted smiling together at the 2014 Golden Globes, and then the Oscar winner was seen rocking out at Swift's Eras Tour in Mexico City in 2023.\n\n“She’s actually really sweet … the best, it’s crazy,” Chastain said of Swift during a December 2023 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “I met her in 2011 at the Met Ball, and we were both — it was, like, the first year I was invited to the Met Ball. First year I had movies out and we were both sitting next to each other.” Chastain had “just gone through a breakup” and chatted with Swift about the split.\n\n“We went and danced together. It was such a fun night,” the actress shared. “Then, the next day, I had an e-mail from iTunes that said, ‘Taylor Swift,’ whatever. I just thought it was a Taylor Swift album. She had made me a breakup playlist that she sent me.” Chastain called the gesture “the sweetest thing.”\n\nCredit: James Devaney/GC Images\n\nMiles and Keleigh Teller\n\nMiles and Keleigh, who tied the knot in 2019, both appeared in the November 2021 music video for Swift’s Red (Taylor’s Version) vault track “I Bet You Think About Me,” which was directed by Blake Lively.\n\nMiles portrayed a groom haunted by memories of Swift, the ex he let get away, on his wedding day. Keleigh played his wife and mouthed “thank you” when Swift presented her with a gift box containing a red scarf, an iconic piece of Swiftie lore from the Red song “All Too Well.”\n\n“So grateful for @Miles_Teller for being the greatest dance partner and friend to me,” Swift wrote via social media after the video’s release. “And @keleighteller, who is the coolest living human on planet earth. The bride was willing to risk it all 🥰🧣.”\n\nMiles later revealed that his wife had gotten emotional on the set of the project.\n\n\"When we were shooting the music video, Taylor played for Keleigh the ‘All Too Well (10 Minute Version)' for the first time,\" he told E! News in July 2022. \"Keleigh was just looking at Taylor in her wedding dress and Taylor and I dancing while she was listening to ‘All Too Well,' the new one, and she was just bawling her eyes out.\"\n\nIn December 2023, Swift was spotted in Manhattan with Miles, Keleigh and Selena Gomez on the eve of her 34th birthday.\n\nCredit: Getty Images (2)\n\nSophie Turner\n\nWeeks after Joe Jonas (who dated Swift when they were teenagers) filed for divorce from the Game of Thrones alum in September 2023, Swift and Turner were spotted dining together in New York City. It was their first public outing, but the pair previously exchanged compliments via social media.\n\nWhen Swift released Fearless (Taylor’s Version) in 2021, she dropped the song “Mr. Perfectly Fine” — a “vault track” that seems to be about Jonas. Turner shared her thoughts via her Instagram Story at the time: \"It’s not NOT a bop.\" Swift shared the post via her own profile, writing, “Forever bending at the knee for my queen of the north.”\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\nJack Antonoff\n\nThe duo seemingly met at the 2012 MTV European Music Awards, and they began their prolific songwriting relationship in 2013 with the track \"Sweeter Than Fiction\" (written for the movie The One). Antonoff, who was dating Swift's pal Lena Dunham at the time, went on to write three songs with Swift for her album 1989, including the hit \"Out of the Woods.\" He has worked on every subsequent Swift album, including her re-recordings.\n\nAntonoff's two Album of the Year Grammy Awards were won for Swift's 1989 and Folklore.\n\n“@taylorswift , from 1989 to here ... goddmann. you are the one who let me produce records first,\" Antonoff wrote via Instagram in a tribute to Swift after scoring their Folklore Grammy in 2021. \"Before you i just “wasn’t a producer” according to the herbs. i just wasnt let in that room. then i met you, we made out of the woods and you said, “that’s the version” and that changed my life right there.\"\n\nHe later appeared in her 2022 music video for \"Bejeweled\" and made a May 2023 appearance at the Eras Tour as a guest performer.\n\nSwift was spotted at his New Jersey wedding to Margaret Qualley in August 2023.\n\nCredit: Christopher Peterson / SplashNews.com; Gregory Pace/Shutterstock\n\nSuki Waterhouse\n\nThe Daisy Jones and the Six actress has been close with Swift since the mid-2000s. In October 2016, Waterhouse was spotted among Swift’s squad going to a Kings of Leon concert. Us confirmed in June 2019 that Swift and Waterhouse went on a double date with Joe Alwyn and Robert Pattinson in Hollywood. (Swift and Alwyn called it quits in April 2023.)\n\nIn August 2023, Swift gushed over Waterhouse’s talent as a singer and sang her praises for being a loyal friend. \"Suki has always seemed like she stepped out of a time machine. Her music is so raw and hopelessly romantic because that's how she moves through the world,” Swift told Ssence. \"When we hang out, I often come away wondering how someone can be simultaneously spontaneous and free — and also preternaturally wise. She is the wildest person I know who I would also trust to keep any secret.\"\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for iHeartRadio\n\nPhoebe Bridgers\n\nBridgers was featured on the song \"Nothing New\" from Swift's rerecorded album Red (Taylor's Version), which was released in November 2021.\n\n“I think that the specificity of Phoebe’s lyrics and the vulnerability she expresses in her voice when she delivers them is what makes her music so deeply impactful and moving for me as a fan,” the \"Maroon\" musician told the Los Angeles Times for its April 2022 profile of Bridgers, who was one of many artists opening for Swift on her Eras tour.\n\nIn March 2023, the \"Motion Sickness\" singer presented Swift with the Innovator Award at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. In her introduction, Bridgers gushed about her fellow songwriter's authenticity.\n\n\"Taylor has always told the truth. She’s written songs from exactly where she is. Her music shifted genre in the same way life does —in the same way being 16 is totally incomparable to being 18, 22, 25, 28. I’m grateful that I’ve grown up in a world with Taylor Swift in it. Or, ‘The World (Taylor’s Version),'\" she said.\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nThe \"Summertime Sadness\" singer has a featured appearance on Swift’s Midnights album on the track “Snow on the Beach.” She also cowrote the song.\n\nDuring Swift’s Eras Tour concert in Las Vegas, she gave a shoutout to her pal while introducing her “Snow on the Beach” live rendition. “I just think she’s the best that we have,” she gushed about Del Rey in March 2023. “So I think we need to make it a priority, as a group, to stream, buy, support this album and this artist.”\n\nCredit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nDylan O'Brien\n\nThe Teen Wolf alum was Swift's \"first choice\" to star in the \"All Too Well\" music video, and the pair formed a tight bond as they worked on the project together. \"I had a feeling he would be great at ad libbing and adding nuance to his character, which enriched the story tenfold,\" the \"Nothing New\" singer wrote in an email to Bustle in March 2022. \"He absolutely blew me away and I feel really lucky that I gained such a great friend from the experience too.\"\n\nO'Brien was equally effusive about his new BFF, praising her for allowing him and costar Sadie Sink to contribute to the creative process with the dramatic post-dinner party argument. \"For someone who’s that meticulous, she’s so trusting. ... Everything was planned to be to music,\" he told the outlet. \"But then when we played out that scene [with dialogue]. [Taylor] immediately marched over and was just like, ‘This is it. I’m going to play this in the video.’ The confidence to just identify that in the moment on set and take in what we were bringing to it [shows how] she’s so sound with relationships and her instincts.\"\n\nThe \"All Too Well\" short film star made a subtle appearance on Swift’s Midnights album in October 2022. In the song, “Question…” clapping can be heard, and the album's credits reveal that O’Brien, Swift’s brother Austin, music producer Jack Antonoff and his sister Rachel proves the sound effect. The actor also played the drums on the track “Snow on the Beach.”\n\nCredit: Instar (2)\n\nZoë Kravitz\n\nWhile filming The Batman in London amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Kravitz and Swift were in the same pandemic pod. NYT Magazine editor Jake Silverstein later told Women's Wear Daily that Taylor helped Kravitz with a virtual photoshoot.\n\n\"Zoe was being very strict about it anyway because she's shooting a movie,\" Silverstein said. \"And Taylor Swift was in her pod and willing to assist.\"\n\nWhile the singer got a \"special thanks\" shout-out in the December 2021 issue, she also gave Kravitz's performance her approval in March 2022 during the movie's opening weekend.\n\n\"@zoeIsabellaKravitz IS THE CATWOMAN OF DREAMS,\" Swift proclaimed via her Instagram Story alongside a photo of Kravitz as Catwoman on a movie theater screen. \"The Batman was PHENOMENAL!!!\"\n\nIn October 2022, it was revealed that The Batman star cowrote and provided background vocals on Swift’s opening track, “Lavender Haze.”\n\nThe pair were seen hanging out in New Jersey at Jack Antonoff and Margaret Qualley's rehearsal dinner in August 2023.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nAvril Lavigne\n\nSwift and Lavigne weren’t always besties. In fact, in August 2015, the “Sk8er Boi” singer seemed to shade the “Blank Space” artist via Twitter after Swift appeared to like a Tumblr post unfavorably comparing their meet and greets. But the singer-songwriters quickly squashed any beef a few days later when Lavigne joined the Pennsylvania native on stage to perform “Complicated” during the 1989 tour. Swift called the 2000s hit a “brilliant pop song” at the time — and she is still singing the Canadian guitarist’s praises nearly seven years later. In March 2022, following the release of Lavigne’s album, Love Sux, the “I’m With You” singer showed off a bouquet of flowers from Swift via Instagram. ”Avril, Been dancing around my kitchen to your fabulous new album!! It's AMAZING, like you,\" read the attached note. \"Your forever fan, Taylor.\"\n\nCredit: Richard Young/Shutterstock\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\nThe “Déjà Vu” singer, who describes herself as a Swift “fangirl for life,” sparked a friendship with the Grammy winner after dropping her first single, “Drivers License,” in January 2021. After hearing the track, Swift wrote Rodrigo a letter and sent her one of her rings as a gift.\n\n\"I don't want to divulge too much because it's really sweet and personal, but she talks a lot about how, I think, you make your own luck in the world,\" the Bizaardvark alum told Billboard in its May 2021 cover story. \"I don't know, she put it so eloquently, and when I say it now ... it's not as cool.”\n\nRodrigo later gushed about Swift after meeting her at the 2021 BRIT Awards in May. \"It's so nice to be welcomed into the music industry and so great to be supportive of other women,\" she told Variety in August 2021.\n\nCredit: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock\n\nCamila Cabello\n\nSwift has been a good friend to the former Fifth Harmony member over the years, throwing her an 18th birthday party and later inviting her to serve as an opening act on the Reputation tour.\n\nIn August 2021, Cabello revealed that she thought of Swift as her \"fabulous godmother\" after her guidance helped her find her way professionally.\n\n\"I started out and I was a teenager when I met her, like 18 or something, and she always gave me great advice,\" the \"Havana\" singer told Entertainment Tonight at the time. \"She was always really supportive of me and really nurturing and sweet. So in the industry, I would say her.\"\n\nCredit: Raymond Hall/GC Images\n\nKarlie Kloss\n\nThe “Enchanted” singer and Kloss enjoyed an all-girls California road trip in 2014 and have been photographed several times in NYC. “I think she’s the coolest girl,” the model told Us at the 2013 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. “She’s a great role model, and I love her music.” However, Swift and Kloss reportedly had a falling out in 2019 after the musician called out the entrepreneur’s friend Scooter Braun for purchasing her masters. Fans later speculated that the Grammy winner’s Evermore song “It’s Time to Go” — which included the lyric “When the words of a sister come back in whispers / That prove she was not in fact what she seemed” — was about Kloss.\n\nCredit: Anna Webber/Getty Images\n\nEd Sheeran\n\n“She would be there if everything ended for me,” Sheeran told Rolling Stone in March 2017. “Taylor is kind of an anomaly in that sense. She’s omnipresent because she’s the most famous woman in the world, so she can’t make the decision to not be in the press. I always stick up for Taylor.”\n\nThe British crooner sang with Swift on \"Everything Has Changed\" before he joined her Red tour in 2014. He later appeared on her 2017 song “End Game” while she appeared on his 2021 track \"The Joker and the Queen.\"\n\nCredit: NPG.com\n\nDianna Agron\n\nSwift and the Glee actress have been photographed several times together since 2012. The duo caught a showing of The Hunger Games that March and played dress-up for Shirley MacLaine's 78th birthday the following month. \"We dressed up full-time fancy,\" Swift captioned a snapshot on Instagram.\n\nIn May 2023, Agron told Rolling Stone that she thought speculation that her relationship with Swift was romantic was entertaining. \"That is so interesting,\" she said. \"I mean, there have been many stories about my dating life that are so wildly untrue. That's funny.\""
