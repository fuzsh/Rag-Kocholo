        "text": "December is going to be a very busy month for pop singer Britney Spears. Her new album, Britney Jean, will be released on December 3 and her “Britney: Piece of Me” engagement at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas kicks off December 27. E! cable television channel is filming Spears as she prepares for the two-year residency. The 90-minute documentary, “I Am Britney Spears,” airs on December 22. E! says the special will give fans “an intimate look at one of the most overexposed yet under-revealed stars of today as she faces one of her biggest challenges ever while finishing her album, shooting videos, doing press -- and being a mom.”\n\nEminem Dominates Billboard Chart\n\nRapper Eminem sold 792,000 copies of his new album The Marshall Mathers LP 2 its first week of release. That gives him the Number One spot on this week’s Billboard 200 chart and the second-biggest sales week of 2013. Only Justin Timberlake opened with a higher number. His 20/20 Experience sold 968,000 copies. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 is Eminem’s seventh Number One album.\n\nIn addition to Eminem’s Number One debut, three other albums make Top 10 entries on this week’s Billboard 200 chart. Celine Dion comes in at Number 2 with Loved Me Back To Life, Avril Lavigne’s self-titled fifth album debuts at Number 5, and PTX: Vol. II by Penatonix lands on the list at Number 10.\n\nPennell, Robichaud Among 'The Voice' Finalists\n\nFans of the NBC reality show The Voice have chosen their Top 10 finalists.

The songs took off, and the show idea never came to fruition. Now that our songs have merged with a Broadway show, we’ve come full circle.” “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” officially opens on January 12, 2014.\n\nLatin Recording Academy to Honor Miguel Bose\n\nOn November 20, the Latin Recording Academy will honor Spanish singer, author and actor Miguel Bose as its Person of the Year. He’ll receive the award at a star-studded concert and tribute gala in Las Vegas. Gabriel Abaroa Jr., President/CEO of The Latin Recording Academy said in a statement, “As a truly international organization, The Latin Recording Academy looks to honor individuals who have made an extraordinary global impression on music and culture, and this year we take great pride in honoring a very talented performer and philanthropist whose immense talent and generosity have had a profound impact. We look forward to paying tribute to one of today’s most respected and avant-garde artists as well as a man whose selflessness has benefited many around the world.”\n\nOver the years, Bose has donated his time and money to various charitable organizations, social projects and environmental causes. His Foundation Paz Sin Fronteras (Peace Without Borders) fights for the right to live in peace.
