        "text": "Hugh Jackman and Deborra-lee Jackman Separate After 27 Years\n\nHugh Jackman and his wife of 27 years, Deborra-lee, are separating. In a statement to People Friday (September 15), the couple says: “We have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth. Our family has been and always will be our highest priority. We undertake this next chapter with gratitude, love, and kindness. We greatly appreciate your understanding in respecting our privacy as our family navigates this transition in all of our lives.”\n\nThe statement, signed “Deb and Hugh Jackman,” concludes: “This is the sole statement either of us will make.” The Australian natives share two children together, Oscar, 23, and Ava, 18. They met on the set of the Australian mini-series Corelli in 1995. Deborra was already an established actress at the time, with the role being Hugh’s first professional job following drama school. Jackman has said he “always loved acting, but when I started at drama school, I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn’t coming right to me.” The actor stated that “Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of” the show, which only lasted one season. Less than a year later, the two tied the knot on April 11, 1996.\n\nOn their 27th wedding anniversary this year, the Logan star posted a heartfelt message to Deb, 67, and their bond on Instagram. He wrote, in part, “I love you so much. Together we have created a beautiful family. And life. Your laughter, your spirit, generosity, humor, cheekiness, courage and loyalty is an incredible gift to me. I love you with all my heart.” Their last red carpet appearance was at the Met Gala in May. In July, the pair attended the men’s finals at Wimbledon.\n\nCelebrity Breakups and Divorces of 2023\n\n2023 has seen a lot of celebrity deaths — and deaths in love due to breakups. Some couples have called it quits after years of being together. New relationships formed that looked as though they were meant for each other.\n\nWe’ve all wished for some relationships to have stayed together, despite not knowing what goes on behind closed doors. Celebrities are a prime example of not knowing what they are like in real life versus the facade of a perfect relationship they put out there.\n\nSometimes, fans are more upset than the celebrities who are going through the breakup! When Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn called it quits after 5 years together and a rumored secret marriage, fans professed they gave up on love entirely. Others used the breakups as a way to bash celebrities. Ariana Grande’s divorce announcement to Dalton Gomez caused viral videos of her alleged years of cheating on partners. As for the couples who share children together, our hearts broke for the ones we thought were happily ever afters.\n\nTake a look below at all the major celebrity relationships that have come to an end in 2023.\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
